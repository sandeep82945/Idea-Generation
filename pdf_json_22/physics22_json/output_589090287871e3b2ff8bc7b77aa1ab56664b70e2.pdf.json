While egular size ETG are not rare at low and high- z, one cannot say he same for the compact massive red nuggets. The red nuggets are ather abundant at high redshifts. For instance, Saracco, Longhetti & argiulo ( 2010 ) reported a comoving number density of compact alaxies at 0.9 < z < 1.92 of 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 for M \u2217/M > \u00d7 10 10 . Barro et al. ( 2013 ) plotted the evolution of the number denity across different redshifts, finding that the number density, n , of ed nuggets peaked at a look-back time of 8 Gyr ( z = 1), with n peak \u2248 .5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 . Ho we v er, re gardless of the assorted size and mass riteria used to define red nuggets, it has repeatedly been claimed hat these objects are virtually non-existent at z \u223c 0 (Trujillo et al. 009 ; Taylor et al. 2010 ). The sharp decrease in the compact massive alaxy population indicates a drastic change in galaxy structure o v er his period of time. Ho we ver, disagreement among observ ations (e.g. rujillo et al. 2007 ; Valentinuzzi et al. 2010 ; Poggianti et al. 2013a ) ed to debates o v er whether there is indeed a drop in the number of ompact massive quiescent systems across time.\nThe structure of an ETG is often o v erlooked and o v ersimplified. any are misclassified as purely elliptical (E) galaxies while in eality, most ETGs contain a disc (Capaccioli, Held & Nieto 1987 ; arter 1987 ; Nieto et al. 1988 ; Capaccioli et al. 1990a ; D\u2019Onofrio t al. 1995 ; Graham et al. 1998 ; Emsellem et al. 2011 ; Scott et al. 015 ); either a large-scale disc making it a lenticular (S0) galaxy, r an intermediate-scale disc making it an ellicular 2 (ES) galaxy Liller 1966 ; Sa v orgnan & Graham 2016b ; Graham 2019 ). Given hat different structures, for example, triaxial spheroids or relatively at discs, form via different physical mechanisms, advances may be ade by not simply treating galaxies as if they are single-component ystems but rather examining their bulge/disc nature and the role of 0 and ES galaxies in the grand scheme of galaxy evolution. 3\nFrom a random incomplete sample, Graham, Dullo & Sa v orgnan 2015 ) reported a lower limit to the volume number density for ocal compact massive spheroids in fair agreement with some of the umber densities reported for compact massive galaxies at high- z see also de la Rosa et al. 2016 ; Costantin et al. 2020 ). Here, we nvestigate the issue more thoroughly, using a mass and a volumeimited sample of nearby galaxies combined with a careful, homoeneous, physically moti v ated 4 multicomponent decomposition of heir surface brightness profile. We do this to detect and quantify the rimary spheroidal component, a.k.a. bulge. While we do not advocate any particular origin for the high- z red uggets, we do note that some bulges may form in other ways. For xample, star-forming clumps may form in turbulent discs at highedshift before migrating inwards to form the bulge (e.g. Bournaud,\nThe concatenated name (elliptical + lenticular) \u2018ellicular\u2019 was introduced or the ES galaxy type in Graham et al. ( 2017 ). Those unfamiliar with the historical disco v ery of, and continuity between, he different morphological substructures in large, high surface brightness alaxies may like to refer to the galaxy classification grid presented in Graham 2019 ). It builds upon past works by better recognizing the range of disc sizes n ETGs, which can also contain bars. Rather than randomly/automatically fitting two or three S \u0301ersic components, e fit physical structures such as bars, ansae (e.g. Martinez-Valpuesta, napen & Buta 2007 ), discs, etc., as detected through imaging and kinematic ata.\nd v\n2\nT M p\n5\ni\nnuary 2024\nlmegreen & Elmegreen 2007 ; Elmegreen, Bournaud & Elmegreen 008 ). This process does not preclude subsequent disc accretion and rowth but it does start with a disc rather than the monolithic collapse f a spheroid. In addition, discs (with and without a stabilizing dark atter halo) can experience instabilities leading to bars, which can n turn experience instabilities of their own, leading to the formation f buckled bars often with distinct (peanut shell)-shaped structures nown as pseudobulges (e.g. Bardeen 1975 ; Hohl 1975 ; Combes & anders 1981 ; Combes et al. 1990 ). While both low-mass classical ulges and pseudobulges can rotate and have a S \u0301ersic index for their ight profile around 1 (Graham 2015 ), the bar + pseudobulge has a tenency to result in elongated isophotes having a maximum B 6 Fourier armonic term at around half the length of the bar (Ciambur 2016 , nd references therein). 5 Classical bulges, bars and pseudobulges, nd discs are known to coexist (e.g. Norman, Sell w ood & Hasan 996 ; Erwin et al. 2003 ; Athanassoula 2005 ). In our multicomponent ecompositions, we focus on reco v ering what would be considered he \u2018classical bulge\u2019. We will present the decompositions of the alaxy light in a forth-coming paper which will compare the sizes nd masses obtained from fitting a single S \u0301ersic function, a S \u0301ersic lus an exponential function, and our multicomponent analysis used ere to obtain the spheroid size and mass. In Section 2 , we describe the data selection of local galaxies hat potentially contain a compact massive spheroid. Section 3 goes hrough the process of galaxy model fitting and some of the nuances f multicomponent decomposition. In Section 4 , the spheroid mass unction, the spheroid size\u2013mass relation, and the number density of ocal compact massive spheroids are presented. A comparison with ocal spheroid and high- z samples are shown in Section 5 . Based n the newly found local spheroids, we discuss the implications or galaxy evolution as a whole in Section 6 . We summarize our ndings in Section 6.5 . Finally, in a set of appendices, we provide n accounting of distance corrections (Appendix A ), assumptions o v erning our adopted mass-to-light colour relations (Appendix B ), ost galaxy sample (Appendix C ), and structural parameters for the ocal spheroids (Appendix D ).\nThroughout this paper, we assume the following cosmographic arameters: H 0 = 68 km s \u22121 Mpc \u22121 , m = 0.3, and = 0.7. The bsolute magnitude of the sun ( M ) in i \u2212band is set to 4.53 (in B mag). Unless otherwise stated, all bulge parameters ( R e , \u03bce , and ) correspond to the geometric-mean axis ( R eq = \u221a R maj R min , aka he equi v alent axis) which is equi v alent to a circularized form of the sophotes.\nDATA\nn Section 2.1 , we explain the parent data selection process. ection 2.2 briefly describe the images sources.

The galaxy images should also be f sufficiently high spatial resolution for us to properly separate the ubstructures such as discs and bars from the spheroidal components. his limits our sample\u2019s maximum co-moving distance to approxmately 100 Mpc, because, beyond this point, the multicomponent ecomposition becomes challenging with \u223c1 arcsec seeing. We elected to use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000 ) hotometric data because of its wide sk y co v erage of \u223c14 555 deg 2 Aihara et al. 2011 ), and its completeness of galaxies at the bright nd ( m i \u2032 < 23 mag) of the galaxy magnitude distribution. Our sample election is based on the NASA-Sloan ATLAS catalogue, 6 a data set hat consists of information from the SDSS DR8 (Aihara et al. 2011 ), ASA Extragalactic Database (NED; Helou et al. 1991 ), 7 Six-degree ield Galaxy Redshift Surv e y (Jones et al. 2004 ), Two-degree Field alaxy Redshift Surv e y (Colless 1999 ), ZCAT (Huchra et al. 1983 ), nd ALF ALF A (Gio vanelli et al. 2005 ). The catalogue pro vides a ist of unique objects as they remove all the redundant data and stars hat were previously misclassified as galaxies. It contains 145 155 alaxies within a redshift z \u223c 0.055. From the parent sample, we limit the angular boundaries to 39 \u25e6 < R . A . < 214 \u25e6, and (1a) < Dec < 55 \u25e6.

It contains 55 370 alaxies and captures 8.5 per cent of the sky, or a solid angle of .07 sr. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the angular selection. The rea contains notable supergalactic structures such as the Virgo and oma clusters.\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nht tp://www.nsat las.org/ http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu\nb\nZ\nT\n.2 The imaging data\nur imaging data come from SDSS i -band images. We decided o use i -band photometry for its smaller galactic extinction. The nitial flux of the objects was previously measured with a single  \u0301ersic component fit by the SDSS pipeline. The NASA-Sloan TLAS catalogue provided the flux in the ugriz bands in units of anoma g gies . The SDSS magnitude of a galaxy in the AB magnitude ystem (Oke 1974 ) is:\n= [22 . 5 mag ] \u2212 2 . 5 log 10 ( f ) , (2) here f is the flux of the object in nanoma g gies and [22 . 5 mag ] is he photometric zero-point magnitude for all bands in the SDSS. The seeing for each galaxy was estimated by using the Image\neduction and Analysis Facility ( IRAF ; Tody 1986 , 1993 ) function mexam . We typically measured 5 or 6 stars randomly distributed\nn each frame. The imexam task was used to fit a Gaussian unction to each star. The median value of the full-width at halfaximum (FWHM) was used to represent the seeing of the frame. he measurements are listed in Column 8 of Tables C1 \u2013C3 .\n.3 Stellar masses\nespite slight differences in definition between studies, compact assive galaxies generally have a stellar-mass larger than M \u2217/M (1\u20137) \u00d7 10 10 . We will focus on local host galaxies with a total\ntellar mass of M \u2217/M 1 \u00d7 10 11 , in order to find compact massive pheroidal components. The determination of the stellar mass deends heavily on different factors, including the initial mass function IMF); stellar population synthesis (SPS) models; the treatment of ust attenuation; and the fine-tuning of the age, metallicity, and eddening parameters. While it is a common practice to obtain he stellar mass by fitting a stellar model to the spectral energy istribution (SED) of the galaxy light, it is not quite appropriate for ur purpose. Having the galaxy SED does not provide us with the ass-to-light ratio ( M \u2217/ L ) of the spheroid, which would require a tructural decomposition in many bands to provide the SED of the pheroid.\nWhile bulge + disc fits in many bands are increasingly produced n scale (e.g. Kennedy et al. 2016 ), the proximity of our sample, n which bars and rings are resolved, mandates the implementation f multicomponent decompositions. To date, these are performed anually rather than automatically, which allows for greater care nd recourse to additional information, such as kinematic maps in he literature. Given time constraints, we elected to focus on the ecomposition of i -band images (described in detail in Section 3.3 ). t has also been shown that the i -band mass-to-light ratio M \u2217/ L and g \u2212 i ) relation has a low scatter intrinsically (Taylor et al. 2011 ).\ne use the galaxy colour, rather than the full SED, as a proxy for the pheroid colour when estimating the spheroid M \u2217/ L ratio.\nWe utilize several mass-to-light versus ( g \u2212 i )\u2013colour relations MLCRs), \u03d2 i ( g , i ), available from the literature and applicable o the i -band magnitudes: Zibetti, Charlot & Rix ( 2009 , hereafter 09); Taylor et al. ( 2011 , hereafter T11); Into & Portinari ( 2013 , ereafter IP13); and Roediger & Courteau ( 2015 , hereafter RC15). ll of these works assume an exponentially declining star formation istory (SFH \u221d e t / \u03c4 ) in their models. The following equations can e used to calculate the host galaxy total stellar mass, and later the ulge/spheroid stellar mass:\n09 : log 10 \u03d2 i ( g, i) = 1 . 032( g \u2212 i) \u2212 0 . 963 (3a)\n11 : log 10 \u03d2 i ( g, i) = 0 . 700( g \u2212 i) \u2212 0 . 680 (3b)\nI\nR\nG s 0\nb K B g W t t >\nt u z t T s e ( r v a o\n8\nA 9\nt e a M i S\nt e e o M\n2\nW m t ( 1 e s\nt N t 1 T o ( m c\no m c\na s d c t\np m t C ( g o M g a T c i p\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January\nP13 : log 10 \u03d2 i ( g, i) = 0 . 985( g \u2212 i) \u2212 0 . 669 (3c) C15 : log 10 \u03d2 i ( g, i) = 0 . 979( g \u2212 i) \u2212 0 . 831 (3d) iven the conditions on their respective assumptions, each MLCR elf-reported to have the following intrinsic dispersions, Z09: 0.10\u2013 .15 dex, T11: 0.1 dex, IP13: 0.13 dex, and RC15: 0.14 dex. For our sample, the galaxy ( g \u2212 i ) colours exhibit a familiar imodal distribution (Tully & Verheijen 1997 ; Blanton et al. 2003 ; auf fmann et al. 2003 ; Strate v a et al. 2003 ; Baldry et al. 2004 ; alogh et al. 2004 ; Brinchmann et al. 2004 ). The most massive alaxies occupy the \u2018red\u2019 distribution, centred at ( g \u2212 i ) \u223c 1.2 mag. e demonstrate the log 10 ( M \u2217/ L )-to-( g \u2212 i ) relations for the four equaions in Fig. 2 . Within our sample\u2019s colour range ( \u223c1.2 \u00b1 0.04 mag), he MLCRs yield decreasing M \u2217/ L ratio in the following order: IP13 RC15 > Z09 > T11. Given the goal of this work is comparative in nature, it is important o know the stellar mass relative to the high- z galaxies. While the nderlying assumptions in calculating the stellar masses of highgalaxies have varied from paper to paper, we attempt to make he comparison using the MLCR best matches their assumptions. 8 hroughout this work, we present the result mainly using RC15 tellar mass for the sake of consistency. It represents an intermediate stimation between the lowest (T11) and the highest estimation IP13 9 ). Moreo v er, RC15 hav e the same priors as some prominent ed nuggets studies (Barro et al. 2013 ; van der Wel et al. 2014 ; an Dokkum et al. 2015 ,, etc.), namely the Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF nd the Bruzual & Charlot ( 2003 ) SPS. That being said, the effect f using a different M \u2217/ L ratio prescription should be considered\nThe theoretical background for each MLCR is discussed in detail in ppendix B . Considering there are many S0 and S galaxies in our sample, we apply he disc-model equation from IP13 (see their table 5). Although, the two quations in IP13 (in their tables 3 and 5) for ( g \u2212 i ) colour would return similar result. We provide several estimates of the stellar mass, with the LCRs from IP13 yielding the highest masses here. It is noted that this s not an extreme mass estimate, with MLCRs from Bell et al.

Having several stellar mass estimations allow us to xamine the potential bias inherent in the choice of stellar mass stimation measurement. We shall explore how the number density f the embedded compact massive spheroids may change for each LCRs, later in Section 5.4 .\n.4 Distances\ne try to account for the peculiar velocity influence on distance easurements. There are several empirical methods to approximate he distance of nearby galaxies: the Tully\u2013Fisher (TF) relation Tully & Fisher 1977 ), fundamental plane (Djorgovski & Davis 987 ), and velocity field reconstruction (Peebles 1989 , 2001 ; Phelps t al. 2006 ; Shaya & Tully 2013 ). To construct our volume-limited ample, the procedure involved several steps.\n(i) Redshifts. We commenced this project by first calculating he distances using the corrected redshift (ZDIST) available in the ASA-Sloan ATLAS catalogue. The redshift values are based on he Mark III Catalogue of Galaxy Peculiar Velocities (Willick et al. 997 , hereafter W1997), obtained using the TF or D n \u2013\u03c3 relation. his catalogue provides a Malmquist bias-corrected distance based n the velocity field provided by the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey Fisher et al. 1995 ) density field. The initial distances and stellar ass estimation are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 as grey rosses. (ii) A broad mass\u2013distance sample selection boundary. We select ur initial galaxy sample for further examination using the broad ass\u2013distance selection criteria (blue line) in the upper left-hand orner of Fig. 3 , satisfying the arbitrary condition\nlog 10 ( M \u2217/ M ) > 10 + (0 . 014 \u00d7 Dist. ) , (4) nd Dist. < 115 Mpc. This is intended to produce a manageable ample size of galaxies for us to further check if redshift-independent istances are available on NED. There are 708 data points (green rosses) remaining after imposing the mass\u2013distance sample selecion boundaries.\n(iii) Updated redshift-independent distances. Each of these green oints w as check ed in NED to see if there were redshift-independent easurements. We primarily focused on obtaining distances related o stellar phenomena, such as surface brightness fluctuation (SBF), epheids, Supernovae Ia (SNIa), the tip of the red giant branch TRGB), etc. When such measurements were not available for a alaxy, we resorted to using the velocity correction from NED, based n the linear infall velocity model in Mould et al. ( 2000 , hereafter 2000). This model corrects for the influence imposed by major ravitational bodies, namely the Virgo Cluster, the Great Attractor, nd the Shapley supercluster. he revised distances are shown as the coloured dots and purple rosses (labelled \u2018New Distance\u2019, see Column (4) in Tables C1 \u2013C3 ) n the lower panel of Fig. 3 . 10 One can see changes from the upper anel. F or e xample, one can see how the Virgo Cluster at \u223c17 Mpc aterializes from the data, and quite a number of galaxies escape he blue-line selection boundary. One can similarly expect that some alaxies initially outside of the blue-line selection boundary (and gnored by us) would be shifted inside. We mitig ated ag ainst this y limiting the final selection to galaxies in three regions, which\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n0 Note that, because we rely on redshift independent distances measured sing stellar information, our distance is luminosity distance. Although, in his redshift range (0 < z < 0.025), luminosity distance and comoving distance re similar.\nM\nc o s b\nB\nB\nB\nW p o F\na t a t ( d t T w M l a t G s v ( fi\ni c ( g\nb a B d d a 8 \u2018 r s t\nu d\n1\np\nFigure 3.

Within the broad mass\u2013distance selection boundary ample of 708 galaxies, we defined three volumes, aka bins, to acquire oth a manageable 11 and useful number of galaxies.\nin 1 : M \u2217/ M ( IP13 ) 5 . 0 \u00d7 10 11 , 75 Mpc < Dist. < 110 Mpc (5a)\nin 2 : M \u2217/ M ( IP13 ) 2 . 0 \u00d7 10 11 , 45 Mpc < Dist. < 75 Mpc (5b)\nin 3 : M \u2217/ M ( IP13 ) 1 . 0 \u00d7 10 11 , Dist. < 45 Mpc . (5c)\ne chose these arbitrary bins to include the massive galaxies that otentially host a massive bulge ( M \u2217/ M > 10 10 ). The data points f each bin are highlighted in different colours in the lower panel of ig. 3 . (iv) Further refinements. In this step, we further checked the ppropriate distance of each galaxy in the three bins. In addition o the redshift-independent measurements, as well as the W1997 nd M2000 velocities, we collected another independent set of disances using the newly available Cosmicflow-3 distance calculators Kourkchi et al. 2020 ). The Cosmicflow project uses a collection of iverse distance measurements (Tully et al. 2008 , 2013 ) to derive he velocity and density field fluctuations in the local Universe. heir two online calculators provide a distinct approach for galaxies ith Dist. < 38 Mpc and distances greater than this and up to 200 pc. In the former case, the velocity field is based on the noninear numerical action orbit reconstruction in Shaya et al. ( 2017 ) nd the velocity model of Tully et al. ( 2014 ). For the latter case, he distance is inferred from the 3D linear velocity field model in raziani et al. ( 2019 ), with an emphasis on mitigating inherent biases uch as Malmquist bias and the lognormal distribution of peculiar elocities. The main advantage of Cosmicflow is the large library 17 647 individual galaxies) of distances from which the velocity eld is constructed.\nArmed with 3 to 4 distinct distance estimations for each galaxy n our set of three bins, we found that no matter which distance is hosen, all of our sample lies within the three bins selection volume within 110 Mpc). The sample provides a good representation of alaxies within these boundaries.\nThe distance we used for the calculation is chosen on a casey-case basis. The z-independent distance is prioritized if they are vailable. We ha ve 20 and 1 z-independent distances in Bin 3 and in 1, respectively. Unless the measurement has a significant error or isagrees significantly with the other measurements, z-independent istance is used (in total 18). When z-independent distances are not vailable, we resort to using the Cosmicflow-3 distances (in total 1). There are a few of Cosmicflow-3 distances that fall within the triple-value\u2019 region, as the Virgo Cluster bends the distance\u2013velocity elation into a cubic function and returns three distinct distance olutions. In such cases (in total, only four galaxies), we choose he W1997 distances instead.\nThe final distance we used in the calculation is shown in Colmn (2) in Tables D1 \u2013D3 , and the details of specific cases are iscussed in the Appendix A . After eliminating all the false samples\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n1 By the term \u2018manageable\u2019, we are referring to the workload required to erform careful multicomponent decomposition.\nb g p l\nstars or galaxies with obviously wrong v elocities), this leav es us ith 115 galaxies spread o v er three bins.\n.5 Volume-limited galaxy sample\ne defined the bins in a manner that would produce a manageable ample size for careful multicomponent decomposition work. The olume of each bin and the total surv e y volume are shown in Table 1 . t is labour intensive to create a detailed decomposition. As we will iscuss in Section 3.3 , the process involves manual attention and ross-referencing evidences from the literature. While it would be est to conduct large-scale studies on all the local massive host alaxies, the current limitation in automatic decomposition programs revent us from doing so. We mitigate the challenge by limiting a ocal volume with respect to the rele v ant mass range.\nTable 1.

This ensures the inclusion of even the least likely (the east massive) candidates within our stellar mass selection criteria. or easy comparison across different MLCRs, we present a table f conversion, the lower mass limit for each bin across the four LCRs in Table 2 . As one applied another MLCRs instead of P13, the galaxies stellar mass within the three bins decreased by oughly a fixed amount ( \u03b4M \u2217/ M ). 12 The lower mass limits for ther MLCRs are obtained by reducing the IP13 lower mass limits y \u03b4M \u2217/ M . Ultimately, the choice of MLCR would not affect he analysis. As we mo v e forward to discuss in RC15 stellar mass erms, the lower mass boundaries of the host galaxies are now 3 . 4 \u00d7 0 11 M , 1 . 3 \u00d7 10 11 M , and 6 . 7 \u00d7 10 10 M for Bin 1, 2, and 3, espectively. Given each bin\u2019s differences in the lower galaxy mass that was ncluded, throughout this paper, the result of each bin is presented eparately. Tables C1 \u2013C3 show the galaxies\u2019 basic information from he three bins. M E T H O D O L O G Y his section showcase our data processing methods, including the eduction process (Section 3.1 ), modelling of the galaxy image Section 3.2 ), and the multicomponent decompositions (Section 3.3 ). ased on the result of the decomposition, we explore several mportant aspect about the embedded spheroids such as: the spheroid olour (Section 3.5 ), mass (Section 3.6 ), and size (Section 3.7 ). dditionally, we reclassify the morphology for each galaxy based n our multicomponent decompositions (Section 3.4 ). .1 Data reduction\ne obtained cutout images of the galaxies from the SDSS DR12 cience Archiv e Serv er (SAS). 13 Each frame spans 2048 pixels \u00d7 489 pixels (819 . \u2032\u2032 2 \u00d7 595 . \u2032\u2032 6). The flux originates from multiple ources, including the Poissonian background noise plus the signal\n2 While \u03b4M \u2217/ M is different for each galaxy, the deviation is insignificant. he deviation between the maximum and minimum \u03b4M \u2217/ M is equal to .087 dex for Bin 1, 0.01 dex for Bin 2, and 0.002 dex for Bin 3. 3 https://dr 12.sdss.or g/bulkFields ,\nhttps://dr 12.sdss.or g/sas/dr 12/boss/photoObj/frames/301/\nw c m I w\n\u03c8\noming from foreground stars and our target galaxy . Naturally , the istribution of the pixel intensity values in frames with a sufficient eld-of-view to capture the sky background will be a combination f a symmetrical Poissonian bell curve (random noise) centred on low photon count, plus pixels with target-galaxy light stretching o brighter intensities. We define our sky value as the median of the oissonian distribution and subsequently subtract it from the frame Almoznino, Loinger & Brosch 1993 ; Davis, Graham & Cameron 019 ; Sahu et al. 2019 ). The use of wide-frame cutouts resolves the reported SDSS sky ubtraction problem in the SDSS DR8 (Blanton et al. 2005 ; West 005 ; Bernardi et al. 2007 ; Lauer et al. 2007 ; Hyde & Bernardi 009 ; West et al. 2010 ; Blanton et al. 2011 ). The SDSS standard hotometric pipeline (Lupton et al. 2001 ) estimates the background rom a 100 arcsec \u00d7 100 arcsec frame and subtracts it from the mage. In the case of large extended local galaxies, such an approach ill result in o v ersubtraction because the frame is not wide enough o reach beyond the galaxy. Since our frame is significantly bigger han the target galaxy, the sky subtraction issue is under control.\nAfter the sky subtraction, the images proceed to a masking proceure. It is important to mask out the excess light from foreground stars nd nearby galaxies because they can prevent the fitting algorithm Section 3.2 ) from creating an accurate model for the target galaxy.\ne divided the masking process into two stages.\n(i) First, we exclude the majority of the bright sources using the Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996 ) automatic process. The rogram identified the contamination by threshold sigma detection. hile it is good at tracking isolated sources, SExtractor is not as f fecti ve in deblending overlapping objects, in particular, foreground tars in front of a galaxy along the line of sight. We handle this issue hrough the second stage: manual masking.\n(ii) Additional foreground objects are identified by human eyes nd concealed using the polygon tool from DS9 (Joye & Mandel 003 ). We masked the bright sources, as well as the dust lanes that nfluence the stellar light.\nWe construct the mask using the IRAF function mskregion . ombining both the automatic and manual masking, all the irrele v ant bjects are ef fecti v ely remo v ed from the frame.\n.2 Isophotal fitting\nhe galaxy images are modelled with the isophotal fitting program SOFIT (Ciambur 2015 ). The method was first described by Carter 1978 , 1987 ) and implemented by Jedrzejewski ( 1987 ). It has since een a staple technique in modelling early-type galaxies, most otably through the IRAF package ellipse . The algorithm fits a eries of nested isophotes centred around the peak brightness region. t performs a least-square fit on each isophote with intensity, I ( \u03b8 ), xpressed by the Fourier series: ( \u03b8 ) = \u3008 I ell \u3009 + \u2211\nn\n[ A n sin ( n\u03b8 ) + B n cos ( n\u03b8 ) ] , (6)\nhere \u3008 I ell \u3009 is the average intensity, A n and B n are the harmonic oefficients of n th order, and \u03b8 is the azimuthal angle. ISOFIT ade two significant changes to the Jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) algorithm. t replaces the azimuthal angle ( \u03b8 ) with the eccentric anomaly ( \u03c8), ith the following relation:\n= \u2212 arctan ( tan \u03b8 1 \u2212 ) , (7)\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nFigure 4.

The ( | I err / I | ) ratio is defined by I err = \u03c3/ \u221a N , where \u03c3 is the standard deviation and N is the number of pixels comprising the isophotal ring at a given radius.

The incorporation of the ellipticity information in the eccentric nomaly gives us a better description of the shape of each isophote, n particular those that have high . It substantially improves the odelling of edge-on disc galaxies and those with elongated bars. iven the dramatic improvement, ISOFIT additionally allows more igher harmonic coefficients, with amplitudes A n and B n typically symptoting to zero by n 12. The high-order Fourier coefficients apture the radial perturbations of each isophote. Each integer n epresents a specific type of deformation from a perfect ellipse. or e xample, A 4 and B 4 describe the amplitude of a four-cornered eformation of an ellipse, in turn showing the \u2018boxyness\u2019 and discyness\u2019 of the isophote. As illustrated in Ciambur ( 2015 , fig. 4), he high-order ( n \u2265 6) coef ficient re veals additional information bout a galaxy that is rarely studied, i.e. the B 6 profile captures peanut shell)-shaped structures nestled around bars (Ciambur & raham 2016 ; Ciambur, Graham & Bland-Hawthorn 2017 ; Saha, raham & Rodr \u0301\u0131guez-Herranz 2018 ). The 2D intensity map described by the ISOFIT task is comprised f a series of 1D radial distributions, capturing the surface brightness, llipticity, position angle, and Fourier harmonic terms. The ratio of he model error I err = \u03c3/ \u221a N to intensity ( I ) at each isophote is\nhown in Fig. 4 , where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the pixel values data) about the 2D reconstruction of the image created with the RAF task Cmodel (Ciambur 2015 ) and N is the number of pixels in ach isophote. R max is the cutoff radius to which we modelled each alaxy. 14 While the model error-to-intensity ratio increases with raius, they do not deviate much from I err / I = 0, with most points having I err | / I < 0.02. The error from the isophotal fitting is small and the urface brightness information is well captured by the fitting process.\nIt is common in the community to use 2D fitting algorithms such s GIM2D (Simard 1998 ), GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002 , 2010 ), BUDDA de Souza, Gadotti & dos Anjos 2004 ) and IMFIT (Erwin 2015 ), to\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n4 For further information on the galaxy size, see Appendix C .\nW ( c\nt 2D analytic functions directly on to the image. While there are ros and cons concerning whether 1D profile or 2D image analysis s more adequate (e.g. Ciambur 2016 ), we favour the use of the bo v e-mentioned 1D radial brightness profiles. As shown in van der arel, Binney & Davies ( 1990 ) and L \u0308asker, Ferrarese & van de en ( 2014 ), some triaxial spheroids exhibit twisting in their position ngle (PA) and ellipticity profile. The aforementioned 2D codes annot account for the shape changes because they assume a fixed A and for each galaxy component. Furthermore, Sa v orgnan & raham ( 2016a ) conducted an empirical comparison between 1D nd 2D methods on the same galaxies and remarked on some key dvantages of the 1D approach. With the 1D radial profiles, weak eatures such as embedded discs and small bars were more visible. he changes in the PA, , and harmonic coefficient profiles can ignify the presence of these components. They also found that the D routine has a substantially harder time converging to a meaningful olution. We, therefore, adopted the more manually intensive, but also ore reliable, 1D approach o v er the automated 2D approach. A few of the galaxies from our three bins had to be excluded from he analysis due to various reasons:\n(i) edge-on galaxies with substantial dust co v ering the centre of he galaxy (see Section 3.2 );\n(ii) galaxy pairs where the gravitational interaction significantly istorts the structure of both galaxies; or (iii) unique cases for which the fitting program failed to produce convincing 2D model.\nUltimately, we have reliable data for 27, 24, and 52 galaxies in Bins , 2, and 3, highlighted as red, blue, and black in Fig. 3 , respectively. 2 galaxies are rejected in our analysis. We have listed the perceived Hubble types by their (de Vauouleurs et al. 1991 , hereafter RC3) classifications in Column (8) f Tables C1 \u2013C3 . For each bin, they are Bin 1 (E: 13, S0: 6, and S: ), Bin 2 (E: 9, S0: 7, and S: 8), and Bin 3 (E: 6, S0: 18, and S: 28).\n.3 Multicomponent decompositions\nn this section, we present the justification and describe the decompoition process. The projected radial intensity profile I ( R ) of a spheroid r bulge can be described by the S \u0301ersic ( 1968 ) function, expressed n Graham & Driver ( 2005 ) as:\n( R) = I e exp { \u2212b n [ ( R\nR e\n) 1 n \u2212 1 ] } , (8)\nhere R e is the ef fecti ve \u2018half-light\u2019 radius, n is the S \u0301ersic index, I e s the surface brightness at R e , and b n can be obtained by solving (2 n ) = 2 \u03b3 (2 n , b n ), involving the complete and incomplete Gamma unctions. The surface brightness profile is calculated by substituting ( R ) into the following equation:\n( R) = zp \u2212 2 . 5 log 10 [ I ( R)\nps 2\n] , (9)\nhere zp is the zero-point magnitude and ps is the pixel angular size. Man y conv entional studies perform Bulge + Disc decompositions nvolving a S \u0301ersic R (1/ n ) -bulge plus an exponential-disc (e.g. Anredakis, Peletier & Balcells 1995 ; Seigar & James 1998 ; Iodice, \u2019Onofrio & Capaccioli 1999 ; Khosroshahi, Wadadekar & Kemhavi 2000 ; D\u2019Onofrio 2001 ; Graham 2001 ; M \u0308ollenhoff & Heidt 001 ; Simard et al. 2002 ; Allen et al. 2006 ; Simard et al. 2011 , etc.). hile a gravitationally bound system can be broken into rotational disc) and triaxial, pressure-supported components (bulge), in the ase of a galaxy, there is an extra layer of complication.\nTable 3.

F or instance, massiv e alaxies often have a depleted core (King 1978 ; Trujillo et al. 2004 ), here the light in the centre is fainter than what a S \u0301ersic function redicts. Bulges/spheroids are also known to rotate. Some rotate along their hort axes (Binney 1978 ; Miller 1978 ). There are evidences where pheroid rotate around both major (Davies & Birkinshaw 1986 , 1988 ; ranx, Illingworth & Heckman 1989b ; Jedrzejewski & Schechter 989 ) and minor (Schechter & Gunn 1979 ; Efstathiou, Ellis & Carter 980 ; Davies et al. 1983 ; Bender 1988b , 1990 ; Bender, Saglia & erhard 1994 ) axes. Discs also often exhibit bending in their outer region (van der ruit 1987 ; Pohlen et al. 2004 ; Erwin, Beckman & Pohlen 2005 ), lassified by the different behaviour as either Type I (no bend), II a downward-bend), and III (a temporary upward-bend). Moreo v er, ubstructures such as nuclear discs, intermediate-scale discs, and uclear stellar clusters also e xist. The y can contribute an indelible mount of stellar light to the galaxy. For years, these extra features have moti v ated the use of multicomonent decompositions for well-resolved galaxies (e.g. Martin 1995 ; rieto et al. 1997 ; Aguerri, Beckman & Prieto 1998 ; Graham, Jeren & Guzm \u0301an 2003b ; Laurikainen, Salo & Buta 2005 ; Laurikainen t al. 2010 ; Vika et al. 2012 ; L \u0308asker et al. 2014 ; Sa v orgnan & Graham 016a ; Davis et al. 2019 ; Sahu et al. 2019 ). Indeed, Stone et al. ( 2021 ) oncluded \u2018that two-component fits (e.g. S \u0301ersic plus exponential) are nsufficient to describe late-type galaxies with high fidelity\u2019.\nIn addition, one need to be cautious while modelling with S \u0301ersic unction. A part of its usefulness comes from the function\u2019s flexibility. t is able to fit a range of light profile shapes. The flexible nature, o we ver, also presents a problem. If one ignores a prominent ubstructure, such as a bar or an outer ring, the fitting code will ttempt to compensate by bending the S \u0301ersic function, intended to escribe the bulge, upward at the tail end, leading to a higher S \u0301ersic ndex n and radius R e than is correct for the bulge. Therefore, in a ounterintuitive sense, the most accurate way to model a spheroid s to not solely focus on the S \u0301ersic component but also account for otentially biasing substructures. With that in mind, we proceed to odel galaxies\u2019 structures. We use the program Profiler (Ciambur 2016 ) to perform he decomposition. The analytic functions in Profiler that ere used to depict the different galactic structures are listed in able 3 . W e start our fitting using ISOFIT \u2019s major axis surface rightness profile, where the galaxy components often appear more\nrominent than in comparison with the geometric-mean axis. 15 he key to the decomposition is to identify deviations in the arious 1D profiles for each galaxy, such as their surface brightess, position angle, and ellipticity profiles. Each component that e include in the fitting process has a corresponding physical ubstructure that is visible and identified in either the 2D image r (more readily) the 1D profiles. We additionally spent some ime scouring the literature for additional evidence to justify the nclusion of components. This typically included confirmation of ars already detected by others or rotating discs seen in kinematic ata. To illustrate the process, here we present a case study using the lateype galaxy NGC 4045. In Fig. 5 , we present the ISOFIT modelling esult. In the bottom row, from left to right, they are the image f NGC 4045, the model produced by the ISOFIT model, and he residual by subtracting the image by the model. The top row llustrates a 1D representation of the image, model and residual, by veraging the pixel value along the vertical direction. One can see he ISOFIT model has done a marvellous job capturing the surface rightness profile of the galaxy. Fig. 6 shows the decomposition for NGC 4045 along its geometricean axis, a.k.a. equi v alent axis, R eq . The galaxy has a small bulge dashed-dotted red curve), a large extended broken disc (blue curve), nd a bar (orange curve; see Erwin 2005 ; Erwin & Debattista 013 ; D \u0301\u0131az-Garc \u0301\u0131a et al. 2016 ; Font et al. 2017 , 2019 ). Along he and PA profiles, there are two \u2018bumps\u2019 at R eq \u223c 3 arcsec nd 7 arcsec, corresponding to the inner spiral arm-like structures. omer \u0301on et al. ( 2014 ) classified NGC 4045 as a (R \u2032 1 L)SAB(rs , nl)ab alaxy containing two outer rings and a \u2018nuclear lens\u2019. 16 Upon closer nspection (see Fig. 7 ), there are two dust lanes obscuring the light t \u223c7\u20138 arcsec (see also Erwin & Sparke 2002 ), resulting in a dip n , making the isophote appear more circular. We modelled the uclear lens with a S \u0301ersic function (dashed red line) with a very ow S \u0301ersic index ( n \u223c 0.01). The strong position angle (PA) twist t R eq \u223c 27 arcsec coincides with the small bump in . This feature ssociated with the bar and ele v ation in \u03bc is an \u2018 ansae \u2019, where the ar transitions into the disc rotation. Finally, the outermost plateau f \u223c 0.4 beyond R eq \u223c 40 arcsec is the projection of the inclined, otationally supported disc (see Erwin et al. 2005 ; Erwin, Pohlen & eckman 2008 ). We use an broken exponential model for this disc, lus a Gaussian function to account for the brightening in \u03bc at R eq\n43 arcsec, which thereby captures the weak spiral arm within this isc. Failing to account for the elongated bar structure in NGC 4045 ould result in the fitted S \u0301ersic function substantially o v erestimating he mass and size of the spheroidal component of this galaxy. As hown in Column (9) of Table C1 , our sample has a range of orphologies. Our decomposition experience also reveals that the outer compoents can significantly affect the estimation of a bulge. That is, if a rominent structure in the outer region of a galaxy, such as a strong piral arm or disc truncation, is not considered, then the parameters f the disc will be distorted. Like a domino effect, an incorrect disc odel impacts upon the S \u0301ersic model at the centre, changing its arameters to compensate for the ill-modelled disc. We analysed 103 galaxies with the same indi vidual le vel of ttention to detail, following that done by Davis et al. ( 2019 ) and Sahu\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nFigure 5. NGC 4045, an example of an early-type spiral galaxy.

The previous morphologies were etermined by visual inspection of photographic images (Dressler 980 ; Sandage, Binggeli & Tammann 1985 ; Binggeli, Tammann & andage 1987 ; de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991 ), which can drown out feaures and limit the accuracy of the past classifications. For instance, a aint disc in an early-type galaxy can be hard or impossible to see in mages at certain fixed contrasts. In the case of a face-on disc, from photograph, it is very difficult to distinguish a barless lenticular alaxy from an elliptical galaxy. For this reason, in our search for ompact massive spheroids, we have not restricted the initial galaxy ample to galaxies classified as either lenticular or spiral. Many, and no doubt most, galaxies classified as elliptical are either enticular or ellicular galaxies with discs and bulges. Analysing the urface brightness profiles is much more reliable for identifying host alaxy substructures due to the bumps and bends in the profiles. Our ecompositions, therefore, provide a more complete picture of the ost galaxies than past visual inspections. The new information will e particularly valuable to understand the morphological evolution f galaxies. Among the 28 initially elliptical galaxies (E, according to the C3), 64 per cent (18/28) of them are relabelled as lenticular galaxies S0). Two of the original S0s are now classified as ellicular galaxies ES): NGC 3805 and NGC 5382.\nWe present one such \u2018elliptical galaxy\u2019, NGC 4008, to illustrate hy we reclassified it as an S0 galaxy instead of an E galaxy. GC 4008 was classified as an \u2018E5\u2019 in RC3. Fig. 8 shows the galaxy, ur model, and our residual image of NGC 4008. The galaxy has central stellar velocity dispersion of \u03c3 0 \u223c 208\u2013240 km s \u22121 (Faber t al. 1989 ; Simien & Prugniel 2002 ). In its ellipticity profile ( , iddle panel in Fig. 9 ), one can see that the ellipticity reaches \u223c .4, and the surface brightness profile ( \u03bc, top panel in Fig. 9 ) has smooth exponential decline from R eq \u223c 20 arcsec. Although the A and B 4 seem to be featureless, the galaxy has clear signs of an xtended disc. Simien & Prugniel ( 2002 ) found the stellar velocity o be v = 123 km s \u22121 at R = 10 arcsec (in major axis) and appear o keep rising beyond this point. We first tried to use a S \u0301ersic bulge lus an exponential disc to model the galaxy, but we found that it can\ne better described with a bulge (top panel in Fig. 9 , red line) and Type III exponential disc with a slight slope difference separated t R eq = 35 arcsec (top panel in Fig. 9 , blue line). The final fit is an xcellent agreement with the isophotal model and has a root mean quare residual rms = 0.0516 mag arcsec \u22122 (see the middle panel n Fig. 8 ). This decomposition also aligns with Simien & Prugniel 2002 ), who show that at R eq > 10 arcsec, NGC 4008 transitions rom bulge-dominant to disc-dominant. The presence of an extended isc means NGC 4008 is not an \u2018E5\u2019 but an \u2018SA0\u2019 galaxy. There are 7 other galaxies similar to NGC 4008 where we reclassified them s S0.\nTwo other galaxies are worthy of note. NGC 4459 was the only alaxy originally labelled as an S0 prior to our changing it to an 2 designation. It contains a nuclear disc in the centre, as reported\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nb ( S b d t t e w t\nN N t N N l fi e o c B 9\no E v r \u2018 m t g a t C s c c k e o d m\n3\nL a t e 2 s w c o\n1\nN a w N\ny a r\nb s m n g O v e\n( K \u223c r g c m s b\nm t r s m s a T b b b t e\ng ( ( m s P e m i c b r\nt h d s i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ny Peterson ( 1978 ) and Krajnovi \u0301c et al. ( 2011 ). Guti \u0301errez et al. 2011 ) has suggested that it contains a Type III antitruncated disc. a v orgnan & Graham ( 2016a ) broke down the galaxy into a S \u0301ersic ulge, a Gaussian nucleus (for the nuclear disc), and an exponential isc. Ho we ver, the neighbouring disc galaxy is likely the main conribution to the light in the \u2018extended disc\u2019 at large radii. As we limit he fitting range to within 77 arcsec along the major axis, a nuclear xponential disc and a S \u0301ersic bulge are found to suffice. Additionally, e sustain the E classification for NGC 2872, but it is noteworthy hat it contains a dusty nuclear disc (as shown in Tran et al. 2001 ). In summary, only eight elliptical galaxies (NGC 2832, NGC 3615,\nGC 3812, NGC 4073, NGC 4261, NGC 4555, NGC 4889, and GC 5444) in our sample are devoid of (detectable) discs, while hree of them have nuclear discs (NGC 2872, NGC 4459, and GC 4494) and two have intermediate-scale discs (NGC 3805 and GC 5382). The abundance of pure elliptical galaxies is much ower than the morphologies previously indicated. In total, it leaves ve E galaxies in Bin 1, three in Bin 2, and three in Bin 3. True lliptical (E + ES) galaxies occupy only \u223c13 per cent (13/103) f our sample, 17 and they are only \u223c0.46 per cent (13/28) old E lass objects. This equates to an E + ES galaxy number density in ins 1, 2, and 3 of 1 . 84 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 , 3 . 39 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 , and . 20 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 , respectively. This result is comparable to the ATLAS 3D kinematic analysis f 260 nearby early-type galaxies (Cappellari et al. 2011a , b ; msellem et al. 2011 ; Krajnovi \u0301c et al. 2011 , 2013a ). Studying a olume-limited sample within < 40 Mpc, Emsellem et al. ( 2011 ) eveal only \u223c14 per cent (36/260) of their early-type galaxies are slow-rotators\u2019, defined by a luminosity weighted specific angular omentum \u03bbR \u2264 0.1 (see Emsellem et al. 2007 ). They found hat one-third ( \u223c34 per cent) of the previously classified elliptical alaxies are slow rotators, and \u223c47 per cent (17/36) of them contain kinematically distinct core (KDC). We share a mutual sentiment hat reclassification is needed for many early-type galaxies. Indeed, appellari et al. ( 2011b ) advocated the kinematic classification cheme from Bender ( 1988a ) and Capaccioli & Caon ( 1992 ) to orrect for the misunderstanding caused by the old visual-based lassification. Although, as illustrated in Bellstedt et al. ( 2017 ), this inematic scheme fails to accommodate the ES galaxies which are ither fast or slow rotators depending on the radial extent of one\u2019s bservations, it does help identify which early-type galaxies have iscs and therefore require a decomposition to measure the size and ass of the spheroidal component.\n.5 Spheroid colours\nocal early-type galaxies typically, although not univ ersally, e xhibit ne gativ e colour gradient such that the y are redder in their centre than heir outskirts (e.g. Franx, Illingworth & Heckman 1989a ; Peletier t al. 1990 ; Gargiulo et al. 2012 ; Peletier et al. 2012 ; Marian et al. 018 ). In the absence of substantial dust and gas, a ne gativ e gradient uggests younger (more blue) stellar population in the outer regions, hich can be a sign of inside-out disc gro wth. Ho we ver, from galaxy olour profiles, it can be problematic to readily establish the colours f the individual o v erlapping structural components. For instance, a\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n7 Among the true ellipticals, there are six cD galaxies: NGC 2832, NGC 4073, GC 4874, NGC 4889, NGC 4914, and NGC 5444. NGC 4914 is relabelled s a SAB0 galaxy, for its weak bar (Buta et al. 2010 ) and an extended disc ith \u223c 0.4. Informed by the three components model by Dullo ( 2019 ), GC 4874 is now labelled as SA0 (see later in Section 4.1 ).\nc a w s g h a\noung nuclear disc can make a galaxy core colour blue and result in more positive galaxy gradient than compared to the surrounding ed quiescent spheroid (e.g. Graham et al. 2017 ).\nWhile we would like individual g \u2212 i colours for the bulges, or etter yet, the spectral energy distributions of the bulges for use in oftw are lik e MAGPHYS (da Cunha et al. 2012 ) to obtain the stellar ass, we make use of the galaxy colours, recognizing that there is ot a big difference between bulge and disc colours of early-type alaxies and early-type disc galaxies (e.g. Peletier & Balcells 1996 ). ur galaxies have a mean g \u2212 i colour of \u223c1.2, in accord with the alue reported in Fukugita et al. ( 1996 ) for what they thought were lliptical galaxies, but undoubtedly included many S0 galaxies.\nIn general, the bulges of galaxies are redder than their discs Bothun & Gregg 1990 ; Peletier et al. 1999 ). For bright red galaxies, ennedy et al. ( 2016 , see their figs 10\u201313) find u \u2212 r bulge colours 0.5 mag redder than the disc colours, although they remind the eader that they performed a bulge-disc decomposition of every alaxy reg ardless of whether there was a ph ysical need for two omponents. As such, their colour difference will also capture etallicity gradients in disc-less elliptical galaxies. Ho we ver, for ome of our galaxies with bulges, their galaxy g \u2212 i colour might be luer (a smaller value) than the bulge colour. Our use of the galaxy colour in the MLCRs to derive the stellar ass of the bulge might, therefore, underestimate the stellar mass of he bulges. Although, Vika et al. ( 2014 , see their fig. 10 and table 2) eport that E-S0-Sa galaxies tend to have bulges and discs with a imilar ( g \u2212 i ) colour (see also Peletier & Balcells 1996 ). Using orphologically classified galaxies, they find it is the Sb and later piral galaxies that have notably bluer discs than their bulges, with verage ( g \u2212 i ) disc colours that are 0.3 mag bluer than their bulges. hroughout this work, we use the galaxy colour as a proxy for the ulge/spheroid colour. The effect of underestimating how red any ulge is will be to underestimate the M \u2217/ L ratio assigned to that ulge and thus underestimate the stellar mass of that bulge. That is, he number density of local, massive, compact spheroids will not be rroneously o v erestimated due to this issue.\nIn an effort to check on this matter, in Fig. 10 , we compare the alaxy ( g \u2212 i ) gal colour with the SDSS point-spread function (PSF) g \u2212 i ) PSF colour. Fig. 10 re veals ho w some galaxies with a global g \u2212 i ) gal \u223c 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 mag have relatively blue cores. The PSF agnitude is obtained by fitting a point-spread function to the light ource, stars, and galaxies alike (see in Stoughton et al. 2002 ). A SF is a good description for point sources like stars, but not so for xtended sources like galaxies. The PSF fit on the galaxies should ainly sample the spheroidal part of the galaxies. PSF size variation s biased to the red. We highlighted those with unique central omponents in Fig. 10 . The sample with a nuclear disc is marked with lue crosses. Other prominent central components, such as nuclear ings, secondary bar, and AGN are marked with cyan crosses.\nAll of this simply provides a rough guide for what the error in he spheroid colour may be. Of the 103 galaxies in our sample, 69 a ve PSF magnitude a vailable in the NED data base. The median ifference between ( g \u2212 i ) gal and ( g \u2212 i ) PSF is 0.09 mag and the tandard deviation \u00b10.26 mag. Most galaxies reside at 1.0 < ( g \u2212 ) gal < 1.5 along the dashed centre line. Some of the major outliers an be explained by the influence of prominent central components, s evidenced by the four galaxies at ( g \u2212 i ) PSF < 0.9 mag and the one ith ( g \u2212 i ) PSF > 1.8 mag. One outlier deviates from the centre line ignificantly at ( g \u2212 i ) gal \u223c 1.8 mag and ( g \u2212 i ) PSF \u223c 0.8 mag. This alaxy is UGC 8736 (marked with a red cross in Fig. 10 ). Its image as sev ere fore ground contamination. The galaxy is situated next to bright star. We suspect its PSF colour might not be accurate due to\ns e\n( g s r t g t\n3\nM e F h B d T s H m l\nu\n\u03b4\nw u c\n1\nN s l m s\nFigure 11.

The galaxy ( g \u2212 i ) gal colour provides a reasonable stimation of the spheroid ( g \u2212 i ) for our purpose. Given that galaxies do not have g \u2212 i colours redder than \u223c1.5 e.g. T11), we recognize the five galaxies 18 in our sample with a \u2212 i colour of \u223c1.8 as erroneous, perhaps due to dust or a poor ingle S \u0301ersic fit to obtain the g \u2212 and i \u2212 0band magnitudes. We eset these galaxies g \u2212 i colour to 1.5 so as to not o v erestimate he stellar mass-to-light ratio used and thus not o v erestimate the alaxies\u2019 stellar mass. We mo v e on to calculate the stellar masses of he spheroids accordingly. .6 Spheroid masses ultiple high- z red nugget studies (Barro et al. 2013 ; van der Wel t al. 2014 ; van Dokkum et al. 2015 ) use the SED fitting code AST (Kriek et al. 2009 ) to determine the stellar masses of their igh- z galaxies. These works assume the Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF and ruzual & Charlot ( 2003 , hereafter BC03) SPS, with a variety of ust extinction treatments. Among the available MLCRs, only the 11 and RC15 relations are constructed with these priors. For the ake of simplicity, the result will be presented in RC15 stellar mass. o we ver, to ensure the result is not biased by the choice of stellar ass measurements, the effect of using the different MLCRs will be ater discussed in Section 6.1.2 . Our final uncertainty on the stellar masses have been calculated sing the following error propagation equation: log 10 M \u2217 = \u221a ( \u03b4m 2 . 5 )2 + ( 2 \u03b4D D ln (10) )2 + ( \u03b4\u03d2 \u2217 \u03d2 \u2217 ln (10) )2 , (10)\nhere \u03b4D is our assumed uncertainty in the distance, \u03b4m is our ncertainty in the bulge apparent magnitude, and \u03b4\u03d2 \u2217 is our unertainty in the M \u2217/ L ratio.

The outliers does not alter the number of compact massiv e pheroids, nor the shape of the spheroids distribution in any significant way.\nb\nt fl h ( m\ns determined by the component modelling process. The unknown e generac y amongst components is the primary source of error. As xplored in Sa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016a ), adding or subtracting a alaxy component can change the spheroid parameters. Based on our xtensiv e practical e xperience with the fitting routine, and informed y the results of previous studies (Sa v orgnan & Graham 2016a ; avis et al. 2019 ; Sahu et al. 2019 ), we have assigned a probable agnitude error of \u03b4m = 0 . 3 mag for all of our spheroids. This level f uncertainty encapsulates the average error commonly encountered hroughout the combined efforts of this work and its predecessors. he uncertainty in the mass-to-light ratio is taken to be the intrinsic catter of each MLCR, as recorded in Section 2.3 . The error in istance is taken directly from their respective measurement sources see Appendix A ).\n.7 Bulge sizes\ne present the bulge/spheroid size (in equi v alent axis, R e, Sph ) istribution in Fig. 11 . The spheroids from Bin 1, 2, and 3 are epicted with red, blue, and black filled histograms, respectively. he median size \u3008 R e, Sph \u3009 for Bin 1, 2, and 3 are 1.7, 1.2, and 0.8 kpc, espectively. The majority of our spheroids (96/103, 93 per cent) are maller than R e , Sph < 7 kpc.\nOver time, as the stars in galaxies evolve and eject their stellar inds, the amount of dust builds up, at least in late-type galaxies here dust sputtering does not operate efficiently. While the presence f dust is known to reduce the apparent bulge and disc magnitudes, nd increasingly so with a more edge-on disc inclination ( i ), the mpact on the ef fecti ve half-light radius of the bulge is not well nown. An investigation of how R e changes with i , at different avelengths, w ould be welcome. Ideally, this information would e known for different galaxy morphological types. The dust is known to be more centrally concentrated in galaxies han in their outskirts. Qualitatively, this acts to reduce the inner ux relative to the outer flux, which has the effect of increasing the alf-light radius of the galaxy, and the disc component of the galaxy e.g. Graham & Worley 2008 , see their fig. 2). It is not known how uch the apparent half-light radius of the bulge increases, ho we ver,\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nFigure 12. SDSS i -band Bulge-to-Total ( B / T ) flux ratios.

The MASSIVE surv e y (Veale et al. 2017 ) confirms our stellar mass calculation, where in their table 1, NGC 3158 and NGC 4874 reports a galaxy stellar mass of M \u2217, gal / M \u223c 1 . 05 \u00d7 10 12 and M \u2217, gal / M \u223c 9 . 54 \u00d7 10 11 , respectively. Similar to our classification, Veale et al. ( 2017 ) labelled NGC 3158 as a \u2019fast rotator\u2019. For NGC 4874, according to the multicomponent decomposition in Dullo ( 2019 ), it contains three components, an inner coreS \u0301ersic bulge, an intermediate component, and an outer exponential halo. The intermediate component is dominant between \u223c10 and \u223c100 \u2032\u2032 . In their F 606 W \u2212 F 814 W colour map (their fig. 2), the colour becomes gradually bluer towards larger radii. We found that an exponential component can describe the intermediate component well. The outer envelope comes into play beyond our cut-off radius of 90 \u2032\u2032 in the major axis and was therefore not required in our decomposition 20 Some (13/103) galaxies are below our lower mass selection limit in ( M \u2217/ M (RC15) = 6.7 \u00d7 10 10 ). This is somewhat expected because SDSS i \u2212band total galaxy magnitude is measured using a single S \u0301ersic function, while ours is measured by a multicomponents model (Bulge + Disc + others). For galaxies with prominent discs (S0 & S), a single S \u0301ersic model can o v erestimate the size and luminosity of the galaxy (see later in Fig. C1 ). The implication of which, ho we ver, shall be better explored in future works.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nhe effect is such that we may be underestimating the true number of ocal, compact spheroids. Combined with potentially underestimating the masses of the ulges, we mo v e forward in the knowledge that we are presenting conserv ati ve estimate of the number density of compact massive pheroids. That is, these potential biases do not act to o v erestimate he number density. RESULTS e present our result in the following subsections: Section 4.1 howcase the bulge-to-total flux ratio ( B / T ) newly obtained from mulicomponent decomposition; Section 4.2 shows the bulge/spheroid ass function; and Section 4.3 present the size\u2013mass relation of the ocal spheroids and the number of compact massive spheroids under ifferent definitions. .1 Bulge-to-total ( B / T ) flux ratios\ne present the i -band bulge-to-galaxy flux ratios in Fig. 12 , plotted gainst by their morphologies. Our flux ratios are the observed no internal dust correction) ratios taken from the equi v alent-axis ecompositions. F or simplicity, we hav e applied the same M \u2217/ L ratio o all galaxy components; this poses a slight limitation and is an rea where future impro v ements can be made. Ho we ver, we note hat the (dust-free) colours of bulges and discs are, in general, not oo dissimilar from each other in massive disc galaxies (Peletier & alcells 1996 ). As such, the M \u2217/ L ratio will typically, although ot necessarily, be similar. The grey points indicate the bulge-tootal ( B / T ) flux ratios for individual galaxies while the red line is he median ratio in each subgroup. We obtained a disc-dominated edian \u3008 B / T \u3009 \u00b1 1 \u03c3 \u2248 0.33 \u00b1 0.15 for the S0 galaxies (49 in ample). Our spiral galaxies exhibited a notably lower median ratio f \u22480.13 \u00b1 0.12, (41 in sample). In both cases, the barred galaxies onsistently have a lower B / T ratio than the unbarred galaxies.\nIn Table 4 , we present the median \u3008 B / T \u3009 \u00b1 1 \u03c3 value for each orphological type from each bin. The two unbarred ES galaxies\nave an average \u3008 B / T \u3009 \u00b1 1 \u03c3 \u2248 0.86 \u00b1 0.02. While this simply\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\neflects the range of masses and galaxy types, it is important for nderstanding the transition from galaxy to spheroid mass at the igh-mass end of the galaxy stellar-mass function. Our inclusion of minor components, such as nuclear discs, spiral rms, lenses, and secondary bars can change the B / T ratio. This is not o much because of the flux held in these components but because f how their presence can skew the galaxy decomposition if they are ot properly accounted. Although one may expect this to decrease he B / T ratio, it is more complicated than that. For example, the more ophisticated models, which can involv e truncated-e xponential discs ather than a single exponential disc model, can result in a fainter entral disc surface brightness and thus a greater assignment of flux to he bulge if the single-disc model was biased by the outer disc profile.\ne have 32 truncated discs in our sample: 14 Type II (downwardending) and 18 Type III (upward-bending) discs. Echoing the same oint made by Kim et al. ( 2014b ), which claimed that ignoring Type II isc breaks will result in an \u224810 per cent decrease in the B / T ratio, e agree that broken, and inclined, exponential disc models play n important role in correctly modelling a galaxy . Contrarily , the pplication of these more sophisticated disc models to Type III discs an be expected to decrease the B / T ratio, compared to the result sing a single exponential model, if the single-disc model is biased y the outer disc slope. In Fig. 13 , we show the distribution of B / T ratio and the tellar mass of the spheroids ( M \u2217, Sph / M , upper panel) and the alaxies ( M \u2217, gal / M , lower panel), separated by their morphology. he outliers: NGC 3158 (S0), and NGC 4874 (S0) 19 are labelled ndividually in the lower panel. Similar to Fig. 12 , E + ES galaxies ccupy the high B / T region, between 0.8 B / T < 1.0, while S0 nd S galaxy have a B / T 0.6. Note that E galaxies do not ave B / T = 1 exactly due to the presence of nuclear discs and ther components. Regardless of their B / T ratio and morphological ype, most 20 of our galaxies span the galaxy stellar mass range of \u00d7 10 10 M \u2217, gal / M (RC15) < 1 . 5 \u00d7 10 12 . It appears that many 0 galaxies, as well as a smaller amount of S galaxies, can be as assive as M \u2217, gal / M (RC15) > 2 \u00d7 10 11 . Spheroids follow a positive orrelation between B/T ratio and spheroid mass by morphology here S galaxies tend to have less massive bulges than S0 galaxies see the upper panel of Fig. 13 ). The lack of a strong correlation between B / T ratio and galaxy stelar mass is reminiscent to the result from M \u0301endez-Abreu et al. ( 2017 ), here they performed detailed 2D multicomponent decomposition\nTable 4. The Bulge-to-Total ( B / T ) flux ratio of our galaxy sample.

The rather low median / T ratio ( B / T \u223c 0.1\u20130.3) in both massive S0 and S galaxies reflect\nreality that stellar discs and their induced structures take up the ajority of the mass budget (see also, Laurikainen et al. 2005 ).\n.2 Spheroid stellar mass function\ne present the high-mass end of the local bulge/spheroid stellar ass function in Fig. 14 . It includes bulges in the mass range \u00d7 10 9 M \u2217/M (RC15) 1.5 \u00d7 10 12 . To our knowledge, hese results are the first of their kind derived from highly detailed, ulticomponent decompositions on a volume- and mass-limited ample. For each Bin (1 to 3), the mass function is constructed y counting the number of spheroids per 0.3 dex range in mass, then ividing that number by 0.3 and by the volume of the associated Bin 1 to 3).\nBased on the B / T flux ratios from Section 4.1 , we use the individual alaxy B / T ratios in each bin to estimate the median \u3008 B / T \u3009 \u00b1 1 \u03c3 range or each bin. They are:\n(i) Bin 1 ( \u3008B/T \u3009 \u223c 0 . 33 \u00b1 0 . 32) : E (5), EAS (1), SA0 (13), SB0 2), SA (1), SAB (3), and SB (2);\n(ii) Bin 2 ( \u3008B/T \u3009 \u223c 0 . 29 \u00b1 0 . 30) : E (3), EAS (1), SA0 (9), SAB0 1), SB0 (2), SA (2), SAB (1), and SB (5); and\n(iii) Bin 3 ( \u3008B/T \u3009 \u223c 0 . 21 \u00b1 0 . 22) : E (3), SA0 (14), SB0 (8), SA 10), and SB (17).\nWhile we have a well-defined stellar mass \u2018selection limit\u2019 for he galaxies, it is unclear to what completeness the spheroid mass unction is co v ered belo w this limit. Spheroids/bulges more massi ve han the \u2018selection limit\u2019 cutoff are of course accounted for, but ince we did not sample galaxies below the limit, the spheroid mass unction is only \u2018partially complete\u2019 at lower masses. For instance, massive galaxy of M \u2217, gal \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 11 M with B / T = 0.1 will a ve a b ulge of M \u2217, Sph \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 10 M , below our selection limit. ur sample provides a good representation for embedded spheroids oming from galaxies more massive than 6 . 7 \u00d7 10 10 M (RC15), but ncreasingly less so for less massive spheroids. For example, a less\nassive galaxy ( M \u2217, gal \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 10 M , outside of the limit) with a ulge-to-total ratio B / T \u223c 0.5 will also have a spheroid of the same tellar mass as abo v e ( M \u2217, Sph \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 10 M ), but it will not be in ur sample. We refer to the region below the \u2018selection limit\u2019 as the partially complete region\u2019. The number of spheroids found in this ass range represents a lower limit to the true number. We estimate a rough lower bound to this \u2018partially complete region\u2019 y multiplying the galaxy mass limit (see Table 2 ) by the average B / T \u3009 ratio for the galaxies with masses greater than this limit. This rovides the following rough lower bound to the spheroid stellar asses (when using the M / L prescription from RC15) for each bin: .12 \u00d7 10 11 M (Bin 1), 3.77 \u00d7 10 10 M (Bin 2), and 1.54 \u00d7 10 10 M Bin 3). Between the galaxy mass limit and these lower values, ur spheroid mass function is only partially complete. Abo v e the alaxy mass limit, our numbers are complete. The galaxy mass selection limit\u2019 has been depicted by the colour-coded solid bars,\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nFigure 14. The local bulge/spheroid \u2018stellar mass\u2019 function, with the stellar mass defined using the RC15 MLCR. The red, blue, and black points represent the spheroid sample from the three \u2018galaxy mass bins\u2019 1, 2, and 3, respectively (see Fig. 3 ). The spheroid stellar masses are divided into 0.3 dex mass bins. The error bars represent the Poisson error. The cyan dashed line, labelled \u2018 n Sph \u2019, is the lower limit of the number density for each mass interval, obtained by summing up the total number of spheroids in each interval and dividing it by the total volume of our selection space. The purple dashed line, labelled \u2018 < 2 kpc\u2019, is the same as the cyan line but including only the spheroids with R e < 2 kpc (in equi v alent axis). The three colour-coded bars in the bottom right represent the mass range of confidence, in which the solid bars depict the mass \u2018selection limit\u2019 from the host galaxies, and the transparent bars depict a \u2018partially complete\u2019 region. The points in the \u2018selection limit\u2019 are plotted in solid circles, the ones in the \u2018partially complete\u2019 region are in half-filled circles, and the ones below these regions are in open circles. The spheroid mass function is complete down to each host galaxies\u2019 \u2018selection limit\u2019 where all the hidden spheroids within this range are accounted. In the \u2018partially complete\u2019 region, our sample includes all spheroids coming from high-mass galaxies ( M \u2217/ M 0 . 7\u20133.0 \u00d7 10 11 ) with low B / T ratios, but not the spheroids coming from low-mass galaxies ( M \u2217/ M \u223c 0 . 18\u20131.5 \u00d7 10 11 ) with high B / T ratios. Since Bin 1 has a volume of 3 . 25 \u00d7 10 5 Mpc 3 , 1 object per 0.3 dex range of spheroid mass will give a number density of \u2248 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 .

The data points abo v e he \u2018selection limit\u2019 are shown with solid circles, while those in the partially complete region\u2019 are shown using transparent half-filled ircles, while those less massive than that are depicted using open ircles. Given that Bin-1 has a volume of 3.25 \u00d7 10 5 Mpc 3 , a count of 1, , 3, or 4 objects per 0.3 dex range in spheroid mass will result in a umber density of \u22481, 2, 3, or 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 . The number ensities coming from the smaller volumes of Bin-2 and Bin-3 will e roughly 3 and 10 times greater for the same number of objects per .3 dex in spheroid mass. As can be seen in Fig. 14 , there is a rising umber density from \u223c2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 at 10 12 M , to \u223c10 \u22124 pc \u22123 dex \u22121 at 10 11 M , and reaching \u223c10 \u22123 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 by 0 . 7 \u00d7 0 11 M . Bin-3, which is more complete at lower masses, reveals a ower limit to the number density of \u223c10 \u22123 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 at 10 10 M .\nWe present the o v erall mass function across the three bins using dashed cyan line in Fig. 14 , obtained by summing up the number f spheroids in each mass interval from all three bins and dividing hem by the total surv e y volume (4 . 76 \u00d7 10 5 Mpc 3 ) and then by .3 dex.

To etter explore the situation requires us to next look at the size\u2013mass iagram.\n.3 Size\u2013mass relation of the local spheroids\nn the top left-hand panel of Fig. 15 , we show the distribution of ocal spheroids in terms of their (equi v alent axis) ef fecti ve half-light adius R e, eq and their stellar masses derived from the RC15 MLCR, ssuming a BC03 SPS. The spheroids are colour-coded according o the volume-bins (1, 2, and 3) shown in red, blue, and black, espectively. We plot our spheroids against the opaque grey cloud of he general population of bright SDSS galaxies, consisting of both arly- and late-type galaxies. It is clear that, for a given mass, the ocal spheroids are considerably more compact than most galaxies. s expected, the spheroids extracted from Bin 3, with their lower alaxy mass-boundary, occupy the lower to the medium mass range, nd the giant spheroidal elliptical galaxies reside in the (high mass)\u2013 large radius) region of the diagram.\nIn the other panels, we report the number density ( n (Mpc \u22123 )) ased on different selection criteria. The arbitrary selection boundary ften contains a diagonal line separating the sample into \u2018compact\u2019 nd \u2018non-compact\u2019 systems, with a lower mass limit.\nThe compactness criteria are as follows:\nnras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\ne s\nl\nT ( r s t l\nb\nR\nN c o t t T i\nD\nl\nU s t d e\ne\nl\nT B a f c f p o a t\ns\nR\nB o o s 2 v G\n9 d 3\ng l 1 m o l 7 d\nr < o l s t s a h (\nm w F 2 n a s t 4\ng a a t s e ( f\n5 M\nI i t m t a e\n5\nW s w s N F\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n(i) In the middle left-hand panel of Fig. 15 , we applied the Barro t al.

While having discussed the ifferent choice in the mass limit, we set it to the lowest limit for asier comparison with Barro et al.

(14) his selection criteria are constructed based on the argument that the arro et al. ( 2013 ) boundary is not restrictive enough because it will lso include 60 per cent of the star-forming galaxies, which have a actor of two bigger ef fecti ve radii than the quiescent galaxies. It ould enhance the \u2018progenitor bias\u2019, where the quenching of starorming compact galaxies may inflate the number density of the assi vely e volving quiescent galaxies. It does not, ho we ver, concern ur sample because the stellar population of local bulges has exist for long time (MacArthur, Gonz \u0301alez & Courteau 2009 ). It is unlikely he quenching process between 0 < z < 1.0 to produce such system.\n(v) In the bottom right-hand panel, we select the compact pheroids via the Graham et al. ( 2015 ) selection conditions (grey):\nM \u2217/ M > 7 \u00d7 10 10 e , major / kpc < 2 . 0 . (15)\nuilding on Graham ( 2013 ), Graham et al. ( 2015 ) furthered the proof f concept for this study as it supplied generic selection criteria n small, but massive bulges in the local Universe from different tudies (Seigar & James 1998 ; Graham 2001 ; M \u0308ollenhoff & Heidt 001 ; Balcells, Graham & Peletier 2007 ; Laurikainen et al. 2010 ; an den Bosch et al. 2012 ; Dullo & Graham 2013 ; Sa v orgnan & raham 2016a ). They found 21 small, but massive spheroids within\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n0 Mpc and gave an initial (lower) estimate of the volume number ensity n \u223c 6 . 9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Mpc \u22123 (or per unit dex stellar mass, it is . 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 ) as a lower limit for such systems. While we have focused on galaxies more massive than 10 11 M , iven that the presence of a disc results in a bulge-to-total ratio ess than 1, we have uncovered some spheroids less massive than 0 11 M . Although our spheroid sample is incomplete below this ass, we are able to obtain lower limits to the actual number density f compact spheroids defined by a range of selection criteria in the iterature which have encompassed masses down to 1, 4, 5, and \u00d7 10 10 M . It must, therefore, be kept in mind that the number ensities, from our three bins, shown in Fig. 15 are lower limits. The majority of the spheroids (66/103) lie within the size\u2013mass ange 0 . 4 kpc < R e < 6 . 0 kpc and 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217/M (RC15) 2.5 \u00d7 10 11 . The lower bound simply reflects the mass boundary of ur host galaxy sample and reveals that some galaxies have B / T ratios ess than 0.1. The scatter along either the size or mass axis is rather mall in this region. With (geometric mean)-axis half-light radii less han \u22481 kpc and stellar masses M \u2217, sph < 2 \u00d7 10 10 M (RC15), the catter is much more prominent. This variation of scatter is less pparent when using the major-axis size, as shown in the lower leftand panel of Fig. 15 . We include this because van der Wel et al. 2014 ) used the major-axis galaxy sizes for their investigation.\nConsiderable effort has been made searching for the ultracompact assive galaxies (UCMGs) in the local Universe, defined by as those ith M \u2217, gal / M > 8 \u00d7 10 10 and R e < 1 . 5 kpc (Trujillo et al. 2009 ; err \u0301e-Mateu et al. 2017 ; Tortora et al. 2018 , 2020 ; Scognamiglio et al. 020 ). These objects are extremely rare compared to the regular red uggets, with the number density of n UCMG \u223c 1\u20139 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Mpc \u22123 t z < 0.5 (Tortora et al. 2018 , 2020 ). In our sample, there are two pheroids that satisfy the UGMG definition, giving a lower limit to he number density of ultracompact massive spheroids of n c , Sph \u223c . 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Mpc \u22123 . We provide an assortment of information in Tables D1 \u2013D3 rearding our spheroid sample. The parameters of the S \u0301ersic functions re listed in Columns (4)\u2013(6). Column (7) gives the spheroid pparent magnitudes as measured by Profiler . Column (8) lists he absolute magnitudes of the spheroids, based on the distances hown in Appendix A . The magnitudes are corrected for galactic xtinction from Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis ( 1997 ). Columns (9)\u2013 12) tabulate the spheroid stellar masses, obtained using each of the our MLCRs (Equation Array 3).\nCOSMI C E VO L U T I O N O F C O M PAC T ASSIVE SPHERO IDS\nn this section, we compare our local spheroids with the red nuggets n low-to-intermediate- z (Section 5.3 ) and high- z (Section 5.2 ) from he literature, as well as the embedded local bulges obtained by other\nultidecomposition works (Section 5.1 ). Subsequently, we are able o plot out the potential evolution of compact massive spheroids cross cosmic time. The effect of adopting a different M \u2217/ L ratio is xplored in Section 5.4 .\n.1 Low redshifts ( z < 0.03)\ne have compared our local spheroids with the bulges from other tudies of z \u2248 0 galaxies. We have a preference for decompositions ith a similar degree of detail. Rele v ant studies of the galaxy ize evolution (e.g. Trujillo et al. 2006 , 2007 ; Taylor et al. 2010 ; ewman et al. 2012 ; McLure et al. 2013 ; Damjanov et al. 2014 ; ang et al. 2015 ) have measured the ef fecti ve radii and stellar\nFigure 16.

Both bulges and elliptical galaxies are included.\nm b p b o t a w i d\nS h 3 s b\np a D b P h e b r b d\ns r t s t\no b\ns b y ( t o p S t f t d 0 t t W d\nM e ( I S h c m r\n5\nT b o ( d s w t t\nm i t b e ( w e e D\nf m b i o u t i t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nasses of local early-type galaxies, but not their bulges nor the ulges of any massive early-type spiral galaxies. This may have revented them from establishing the evolutionary pathway taken y the high- z compact massive galaxies. The underlying assumption f those w orks w as the preservation of the morphological types hroughout their evolutionary history. Due to our different approach, comparison with the galaxy sizes and masses from those studies ould be of limited value to test our theory. We can, ho we v er, e xplore f our bulge sizes and masses agree with those from multicomponent ecompositions of local galaxies. Several studies of supermassive black hole scaling relations (e.g. a v orgnan & Graham 2016a ; Davis et al. 2019 ; Sahu et al. 2019 ) ave performed a similar style of careful galaxy analysis using IRAC . 6 \u03bcm images of galaxies in the local Universe. Fig. 16 shows the ize\u2013mass distribution of our spheroids (red points) and the local ulges and giant elliptical galaxies from these studies.\nSa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016a ) obtained their surface brightness rofiles via IRAF task ellipse from 66 early-type host galaxies nd measured the sizes and masses by using a bespoke fitting code. avis et al. ( 2019 ) and Sahu et al. ( 2019 ) extracted their surface rightness profiles with ISOFIT and performed decompositions via rofiler . The Davis et al. ( 2019 ) spheroids are from 44 spiral ost galaxies, while the Sahu et al. ( 2019 ) spheroids are from 40 arly-type galaxies. These studies examine each galaxy on a casey-case basis and assign physical components (e.g. bars and ansae ather than random S \u0301ersic components) when modelling each surface rightness profile (see the appendices of the respective papers for etailed discussions on each galaxy). Despite the decompositions being conducted by different peronnel, the resulting distribution of bulge sizes and masses appear emarkably consistent. The high-mass end of the near-linear distribuion in Fig. 16 resembles the bright arm of the spheroid distribution een in Graham ( 2013 , see fig. 1). Here, we mainly want to illustrate he consistency across the different studies; that is, there is no unusual\nffset in our sample, nor sign of dichotomy. The implications of this ulge/spheroid size\u2013mass diagram shall be explored in future work.\nIn passing, we briefly note that we may be seeing evidence for a teepening of the relation at high masses. This is expected for mergeruilt elliptical galaxies for which the mass scales with \u03c3 2 R eq / G et \u03c3 barely increases o v er the value in the progenitor galaxies e.g. Volonteri & Ciotti 2013 ). Also at play is the influence of he intracluster light (ICL) surrounding BCGs, and we may have v erestimated the galaxy sizes at the top-end. Driver et al. ( 2007b ) roduced a B -band bulge luminosity function from two-component  \u0301ersic + exponential fits (Allen et al. 2006 ) at 0.013 < z < 0.18. While hat work contained no dust corrections, fig. 2 from that work reveals, or their brightest bulges, a declining number density at M B = \u221220 o \u221220.75 mag (AB magnitude system) \u2013 where S0 galaxies likely ominate and there is no substantial dust \u2013 of around 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 to .5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 de x \u22121 . F or M B, = + 5.44 mag, and M \u2217/ L = 8, his roughly corresponds to 1.2\u20132.4 \u00d710 11 M . Their number density, herefore, o v erlaps well with our result at a similar mass in Fig. 14 .\ne do, ho we ver, find the same number density at 5 \u00d710 11 M in our ata, while Driver et al. ( 2007b ) has no bulges at these higher masses. Our number density drops to \u223c0.2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 dex \u22121 at \u2217, Sph \u223c 10 12 M . The absence of the highest mass bulges in Driver t al. (2007b ) may be due to the \u2018logic filter\u2019 employed by Allen et al. 2006 ) for identifying the more secure bulge + disc decompositions. t meant that the ES galaxies, and importantly perhaps some misfit 0 galaxies, remained in the single-component E galaxy bin at these ighest masses. Resolving this is, ho we v er, be yond the scope of the urrent investigation. Ho we ver, it is important to note that in this ass range, there are only two spheroids in our sample. It reflects the eality that spheroids with mass M \u2217, gal / M \u223c 10 12 are rare indeed.\n.2 High redshifts (1 < z < 3)\nhe different selection criteria for compact massive systems have een used to illustrate the migration pattern of galaxy distributions, v er cosmic time, in the size\u2013mass diagram. As shown by Barro et al. 2013 ), van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ), and van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ), with ecreasing redshift, less and less galaxies occupy the \u2018compactness\u2019 election boundaries. Damjanov et al. ( 2015a ) demonstrated that hile the actual number densities are different \u2013 depending on he selection criteria for compact massive systems \u2013 the o v erall rend/reduction with time remains.\nWe have compared the number density of our local, compact assive spheroids with that of compact massive galaxies in the ntermediate and high redshift Universe. Fig. 17 shows the evoluionary trend of number density for compact systems across time, ased on four different compactness criteria, from top to bottom: quations ( 11 ) (top), ( 12 ) (upper middle), ( 14 ) (lower middle), and 13 ) (bottom). To represent the high- z (1.0 < z < 3.3) red nuggets, e have included the number density trends from three works: Barro t al. ( 2013 ) (green diamonds in the top panel), van der Wel t al. ( 2014 ) (blue diamonds in the upper middle panel), and van okkum et al. ( 2015 ) (orange diamonds in the lower middle panel). For intermediate redshifts (0.2 < z < 1.0), we included the data rom Damjanov et al. ( 2015a ). They applied se veral dif ferent size\u2013 ass sample selection criteria to their data. Their evolutionary trend ased on the Barro et al. ( 2013 ) size\u2013mass selection criteria is plotted n the top panel (see fig. 9 in Damjanov et al. 2015a ), and that based n the van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) selection criteria is shown in the pper middle panel (see fig. 12 in Damjanov et al. 2015a ), while hat based on the Damjanov et al. ( 2014 ) selection criteria is shown n the bottom panel (from fig. 11 in Damjanov et al. 2015a ). These rends are marked with red diamonds ( ) in Fig. 17 . In addition,\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nFigure 17. The number density of compact massive systems across cosmic time, based on four different size\u2013mass selection criteria or defining boundaries. It shows the evolution of compact objects from the literature, marked in diamonds ( ) under the Barro et al. ( 2013 ) boundary (top panel, in green, from their fig. 5), the van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) boundary (upper middle panel, in blue, from their fig. 13), the van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ) boundary (lower middle panel, in orange, from their fig. 19), and the Damjanov et al. ( 2014 ) boundary (bottom panel, in red, from Damjanov et al. 2015a , fig. 11). The red, blue, and black circles ( \u2022), at z \u223c 0, represent the number densities from Bins 1, 2, and 3, correspondingly. The error bars of our compact massive spheroids are assumed to be Poissonian. The horizontal black line, labelled \u2018 n c, Sph \u2019, is the lower limit of the number densities across the three bins, and the red line, labelled \u2018 n E + ES \u2019, is the lower limit for the true elliptical galaxies and ellicular galaxies in the three bins (given by equation 16). In addition, the Damjanov et al. ( 2015a ) compact sample (lower panel) is additionally shown by the red diamonds ( ) in the top and upper middle panels, while the Poggianti et al. ( 2013b ) compact sample is marked with a purple diamond ( ) in the top panel. The number density of the compact massive galaxies from Charbonnier et al. ( 2017 ), defined using the van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) and van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ) criteria are depicted by the cyan diamonds ( ) in the upper middle and lower middle panels, respectively.\nt m s e b o g 0 e c F\nl a b a i ( a c p d b m I s f o \u2018 r t B p\ns b s 1 t \u2018\nn\nn\nn v a l ( N t t K F h o m\n2\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nhe number density provided by Poggianti et al. ( 2013b ) is included, arked by the purple diamond ( ) in the top panel. The sample election criteria from Barro et al. ( 2013 ) was used by Poggianti t al. ( 2013b ). Because the other three criteria were not implemented y Poggianti et al. ( 2013b ), we do not include their data in the ther panels. Charbonnier et al. ( 2017 ) selects for compact massive alaxies in the SDSS Stripe 82 (CS82, Moraes et al. 2014 ) surv e y at .2 < z < 0.6. Their number density trends, based on van der Wel t al. ( 2014 ) and van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ) criteria, are presented as yan diamonds ( ) in the upper middle and lower middle panels of ig. 17 , respectively. In Fig. 17 , the three colour-coded circles ( \u2022) at z = 0 are our ower limits on the number density of compact massive spheroids, s obtained using the different selection criteria applied to our three ins. In all the panels, Bin 3 tends to have the highest number density, nd Bin 1 the lowest. This is a result of the bin design. As Bin 3 s complete down to the lowest host galaxy stellar mass ( M \u2217/ M IP13) \u223c1 \u00d7 10 11 ) compared to Bin 2 ( M \u2217/ M (IP13) \u223c2 \u00d7 10 11 ) nd Bin 1 ( M \u2217/ M (IP13) \u223c5 \u00d7 10 11 ), we are able to capture more ompact massive spheroids in Bin 3. Note that in the lower middle anel (van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ) criterion) of Fig. 17 , the number ensities of all three bins are closer than the other panels. This is ecause van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 )\u2019s criterion selects only for highass spheroids and red nuggets with M \u2217/ M (RC15) 4 \u00d7 10 10 . f relatively low-mass (1 \u00d7 10 10 M \u2217/ M (RC15) 4 \u00d7 10 10 ) ystems are also included, such as when using the selection criteria rom Barro et al. ( 2013 ) and Damjanov et al. ( 2015a ), an abundance f low-mass compact massive spheroids can be found in Bin 3. These red pebbles\u2019 are more likely to live inside of galaxies within the mass ange of 6 . 7 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217, gal / M (RC15) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 11 . As a result, here is roughly a factor of 10 more compact massive spheroids in in 3 in the upper- and lower middle panels than the top and bottom anels in Fig. 17 . For the sake of discussion, we categorise the number density of our pheroids into n c, Sph and n E + ES . In Fig. 17 , across all four panels, the lack horizontal line (\u2018 n c, Sph \u2019) depicts the total number of compact pheroids from all three bins divided by the volume V = 4 . 76 \u00d7 0 5 Mpc 3 (our sample volume encompassed within 110 Mpc), while he red horizontal line (labelled \u2018 n E + ES \u2019) is the total number of the true ellipticals\u2019 (E) and elliculars (ES) divided by this volume V :\nc , Sph = ( N c , Sph , Bin1 + N c , Sph , Bin2 + N c , Sph , Bin3 ) /V (16a)\nE + ES = ( N E + ES , Bin1 + N E + ES , Bin2 + N E + ES , Bin3 ) /V . (16b) These two values depict lower limits to the number densities. For\nc, Sph , it is the lower limit of compact massive spheroids based on a olume-limited sample of galaxies with M \u2217 > 6.7 \u00d7 10 10 M (RC15) nd within a distance of 110 Mpc. The value for n E + ES represents the ower limit to the true number density of elliptical (E) and ellicular ES) galaxies that can be found abo v e M \u2217/M (RC15) \u223c6.7 \u00d7 10 10 . ote that n E + ES, Bin3 is likely to be close to the true value because rue elliptical galaxies tend to be massive; that is, ETGs less massive han 6.7 \u00d7 10 10 M tend to be S0 galaxies 21 (Emsellem et al. 2011 ; rajnovi \u0301c et al. 2013a ; Cappellari et al. 2013 ; Cappellari 2016 ). or Bins 1 and 2, we may have missed some E galaxies due to the igher stellar-mass selection criteria required to keep the number f galaxies requiring careful multicomponent decomposition at a anageable level.\n1 Our E + ES galaxy with the lowest stellar mass is roughly \u223c 0 . 7 \u00d7 10 11 M\nm a s t h w v n o\ns f e f h l t\n5\nA t t D q C t c s o\ne a t s I n t s t e t p l o t t o\na ( a fi a 1 e g l ( h a\nq a t fi t t g fi\nS fi o o\n5\nO d m R d c g p p n d\nD s a F f r s a l a m s s i\nt c s T i b f d t i\ns e t f t e h l\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nFrom Fig. 17 , it is apparent that the definition of \u2018compact and assive\u2019 makes a difference to the reported number density (see\nlso, Charbonnier et al. 2017 ). F or the less restrictiv e size\u2013mass ample selection criteria (Barro et al. 2013 ; Damjanov et al. 2014 ), he number density of compact massive spheroids is consistently igher than the number density of elliptical galaxies ( n c, Sph > n E + ES ), hile applying the more restrictive criteria (van der Wel et al. 2014 ; an Dokkum et al. 2015 ), the two numbers are comparable ( n c, sph E + ES ). This is, in part, because n E + ES does not depend on any size r mass selection criteria, unlike n c, sph (see Fig. 15 ). The discrepancy between the restrictive and the less-restrictive ize\u2013mass sample selection criteria in use in the literature is inormative. It means that among the local compact systems, the lliptical galaxies and high-mass spheroids ( > (4\u20137) \u00d7 10 10 M ), ormed via an E-to-E process or disc-cloaking, respectively, may ave occurred with similar frequency. The disc-cloaking process is ikely the dominant mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within he stellar mass range 1 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217/ M (RC15) < 4 \u00d7 10 10 .\n.3 Low-to-intermediate redshifts (0.03 < z < 1)\ns a bridge between the local spheroids and the high- z galaxies, he information from intermediate redshifts provides insight into he transitioning process. In Fig. 17 , we compare our results with amjanov et al. ( 2015a ). They studied the number density of uiescent, compact massive galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.8 from the OSMOS field (Leauthaud et al. 2007 ). While they acknowledged hat most of their sample exhibited a Bulge + Disc structure, they oncluded that the single S \u0301ersic profile captures the size of the pheroids well in this redshift range, with perhaps just a slight v erestimation in size. This sample\u2019s number density shows consistency with the Barro t al. ( 2013 ) and van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) high- z sample\u2019s peak bundance (see the top and upper middle panels in Fig. 17 ). In he upper panel of Fig. 17 , the data from Damjanov et al. ( 2015a ) traddles the region between our Bin 2 and Bin 3 number densities. t is also more abundant in comparison to the red nuggets\u2019 peaks umber densities at z = 1.2, and z = 1.7. The lower panel shows he trend in number density, with redshift, using the size\u2013mass election criteria from Damjanov et al. ( 2014 ). Unfortunately with his selection, the complete set of data is not available, and Damjanov t al. ( 2015a ) only show a partial result that they selected from he COSMOS quiescent galaxies classified as point sources in the hotometric SDSS data base. Their fig. 11 depicts only a lower imit to the number density at intermediate-redshift. Nonetheless, ur number of compact spheroids is vastly more numerous than the rend shown in the bottom panel. The matching number densities with he high- z data led them to conclude that the number of compact bjects does not depend strongly on redshift. Both Valentinuzzi et al. ( 2010 ) and Poggianti et al. ( 2013b ) have rgued for a constant compact quiescent galaxy number density see also Saracco et al. 2010 ). Valentinuzzi et al. ( 2010 ) found substantial number of compact quiescent galaxies in the WIdeeld Nearby Galaxy-cluster Surv e y (WINGS; F asano et al. 2006 ) t 0.04 < z < 0.07. They reported a minimum number density of . 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Mpc \u22123 and possibly up to 1 . 3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 Mpc \u22123 in cluster nvironments. Crucially, the majority (67 per cent) of their compact alaxies are S0. In the P ado va Millennium Galaxy and Group Cataogue (PM2GC; Calvi, Poggianti & Vulcani 2011 ), Poggianti et al. 2013b ) found n \u223c 4 . 23 \u00d7 10 \u22124 h 3 Mpc \u22123 at 0.03 < z < 0.11. We ave plotted their number density in the top panel of Fig. 17 (marked s ) for comparison. Both studies acknowledge that more compact\nuiescent galaxies were found in dense cluster environments (see lso, Tortora et al. 2020 ). Indeed, Damjanov et al. ( 2015b ) highlighted he environmental dependency of compact galaxies in the COSMOS eld. At intermediate- z, the compact quiescent galaxies align with he high-density regions (see their fig. 8). Although, it is important o note that this might simply be a result of more massive quiescent alaxies (of all sizes) living in cluster environments compared to the eld (Tortora et al. 2020 ). The depth and field-of-view in our parent sample selection (see ection 2 , and equation 1) is wide enough to co v er both clusters and elds. It captures the small Virgo Cluster o v erdensity at a distance f 17 Mpc and a slight void at 40\u201360 Mpc. We explore the influence f the Virgo Cluster has on our analysis, later in Section 6.4.3 .\n.4 Variation arising from different MLCRs\nne of the uncertainties on our, and everyone\u2019s, spheroid number ensity comes from the adopted MLCRs and thus the stellar mass easurement. For Figs 14 to 17 , we presented the result using the C15 MLCR. Here, we will explore the consequences of applying ifferent MLCRs. Fig. 18 shows the number density of the local ompact spheroids (marked with a \u2022) and the ellicular and elliptical alaxies (marked with a ) based on the four different MLCRs resented in Section 2.3 and the four different selection criteria resented in Section 4.3 . We have also highlighted the maximum umber density of red nuggets from various works with colour-coded ashed lines. Using the size\u2013mass selection criteria from Barro et al. ( 2013 ) and amjanov et al. ( 2015a ), the number densities of compact massive pheroids are higher than elliptical + ellicular (E + ES) galaxies, for ll four MLCRs (see the upper green panel and the lower red panel in ig. 18 ). Applying the more restrictive size\u2013mass selection criteria rom van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) and van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ) educes the number of compact massive spheroids included in the ample selection boundaries (see the upper middle panel shaded blue nd the lower middle panel shaded yellow), lowering it to roughly ess than or equal to the fixed number (density) of E + ES galaxies mong our sample of 103 galaxies. When using the T11 stellar asses, no compact massive spheroid was found with the restrictive ize\u2013mass selection criteria. Ho we ver, when using the higher IP13 tellar masses, the observed number densities of compact spheroids ncreased to greater than the number of E + ES galaxies, in all criteria.\nThe comparison showcases how the number density varies under he different stellar mass measurement and compactness selection riteria. Importantly, the MLCRs from T11 and RC15 assume the ame IMF and SPS as used by those studying the high- z red nuggets. he result from the less restrictive boundaries in the size\u2013mass plane s consistent when using these two MLCRs. With the more restrictive oundaries in the size\u2013mass plane, and since no compact system was ound using the MLCR from T11, we can conclude that the number ensity of local \u2018compact massive\u2019 spheroids is subject to the paricular M \u2217/ L ratio employed. Resolving this, beyond having reported ts impact, is clearly outside the scope of the current investigation.\nOur results are, ho we ver, robust when using the more inclusive ize\u2013mass selection criteria from Barro et al. ( 2013 ) and Damjanov t al. ( 2014 ). For all stellar mass estimates, we found a consistent rend of n c, Sph > n E + ES . Considering that n c, Sph is just a lower limit or the local compact massive spheroids, while n E + ES is close to the rue value, our result calls for a reevaluation of the nature of the sizevolution experienced by red nuggets. At a minimum, disc growth as to play an essential role in shaping the high- z galaxies in the ower mass range (1 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217/ M (RC15) < 4 \u00d7 10 10 ).\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nFigure 18.

Our trend between the bulge, aka spheroid size, nd mass agrees well with data from comparable, multicomponent ecomposition analyses of nearby galaxies. That is, we do not detect\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nny systematic bias in our measurements. We derive a lower limit o the number density per unit volume of (hidden) compact massive pheroids using four different size/mass selection criteria, giving c, Sph \u223c (0.17\u20131.20) \u00d710 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 . We additionally examined how c, Sph changes when adopting the four different MLCRs. We found hat if only high-mass spheroids ( M \u2217/ M (RC15) > 4 \u00d7 10 10 ) are onsidered, n c, Sph can be either lower, comparable or higher than E + ES . The uncertainty in stellar mass makes estimating the correct umber density challenging. In the case of low-mass spheroids (1 \u00d7 0 10 < M \u2217/ M (RC15) < 4 \u00d7 10 10 ), such an issue does not exist. In what follows, we further compare local compact massive pheroids with distant red nuggets, and we address proposed sizevolution hypotheses based on the results from our findings.\n.1 Differing evolutionary views, definitions, and assumptions\n.1.1 Alternative evolutionary processes\nere, we provide a brief overview of different conjectures regardng the size-evolution pathway taken by high- z compact massive uiescent galaxies.\n(i) Compact massive quiescent galaxies experience rapid size volution, an E-to-E scenario rujillo et al. ( 2007 ) plotted the half-light galaxy radii of local, uminous galaxies with S \u0301ersic indices n > 2.5. These galaxies are factor of four larger than the compact spheroidal-like systems t z \u223c 1.5. From this, they concluded that the z \u223c 1.5 compact assi ve galaxies e volved through dry mergers with themselves, .e. equal-mass major mergers without star formation. van Dokkum t al. ( 2008 ) reported a typical growth in galaxy half-light radii by factor of 5\u20136 since z \u223c 2.3. They found that only 10 per cent f the massive spheroid-like galaxies at z \u223c 2.3 had galaxy sizes qual to that of elliptical galaxies of comparable mass at z \u223c 0. hey, therefore, argued against \u2018monolithic collapse\u2019 as the formation hannel because they found only 10 per cent are fully assembled by \u223c 2.3. They noted an array of processes to possibly explain the size rowth, including dry mergers, satellite accretion, expansion after ass loss from stellar winds, and the arri v al of new, larger galaxies ince z \u223c 2.3 on to the red sequence. he notion of major mergers driving size evolution has been heavily hallenged. The observed number of major mergers (1:1 to 1:4 mass atios) is too low to explain the change in number density of massive log 10 ( M \u2217/M ) \u2265 11.1) galaxies (Man, Zirm & Toft 2016 ). Taylor t al. ( 2010 ) found no galaxies in the SDSS DR7 with comparable izes to the van Dokkum et al. ( 2008 ) and Damjanov et al. ( 2009 ) red uggets at higher redshifts. They also argued against stochastic major ergers as the critical driving force for the size evolution in earlyype galaxies because it will result in some galaxies (those which xperienced man y mergers) having masses larger than observed n the local Universe. Carrasco, Conselice & Trujillo ( 2010 ), who tudied eight massive galaxies at 1 < z < 2 from the POWIR urv e y (Conselice et al. 2007 ), reported extreme compactness within < 2 kpc (higher than the stellar densities of local galaxies). ith similar reasoning as Taylor et al. ( 2010 ), they advocated that inor mergers and accretion are more likely the cause of the size rowth. hile some kind of E-to-E scenario is widely accepted in the ommunity (e.g. Buitrago et al. 2008 ; Bezanson et al. 2009 ; Hopkins t al. 2009 ; Szomoru et al. 2011 ; Newman et al. 2012 ), the mechanism hich supports a dramatic E-to-E size growth remains a subject f debate. Fan et al. ( 2008 ) had proposed that through mass loss\n( a e a d t ( m t t S 2\no s ( t e \u2018 n e g f h a 0 i ( t s 1 g\nt G e ( ( c a g w s 6 w t r h T u i g f 1 n e g t d b i\n6\nT g o a d (\ns ( f i f l l s ( \u2018 t T a t S t p b l m f ( c\ns a g e e 2 e u h e f g 2 ( a d o o\ne o I a t a 2\nb\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nstellar winds, AGN jets), galaxies e xperience adiabatic e xpansion s the new gravitational equilibrium relaxes. Ho we ver, adiabatic xpansion has been called into question by numerical simulations, s Ragone-Figueroa & Granato ( 2011 ) found galaxies \u2018puffing-up\u2019 ue to stellar winds occurs when the stellar population is younger han the formation of the red nuggets (by 0.5 Gyr). Hopkins et al. 2009 ) and Bezanson et al. ( 2009 ) advocated that, through minor ergers and accretion, red nuggets may build up a low-density hree-dimensional envelope which hides the compact galaxies as he core of a larger elliptical galaxy (see also Hopkins et al. 2010 ; zomoru et al. 2011 ; L \u0301opez-Sanjuan et al. 2012 ; Oogi & Habe 013 ). (ii) Compact massive quiescent galaxies experience only a mild, r no, evolution and now reside in local galaxy clusters: an E-to-E/S0 cenario. Galaxy cluster)-focused studies at intermediate- z have challenged he universality of the significant size-growth scenario. Valentinuzzi t al. ( 2010 ) and Saracco et al. ( 2010 ) report on the abundance of compact\u2019 galaxies in cluster environments and postulate that red uggets live in dense environments nowadays. Similarly, Poggianti t al. ( 2013b ) found that the fraction of local compact massive alaxies are three times higher in clusters than in the field, arguing or the scenario of mild evolution (by a factor of \u223c1.6 in size) for igh- z red nuggets. Damjanov et al. ( 2015b ) echo the same point s they subsequently found compact massive quiescent galaxies at .1 < z < 0.4 in the COSMOS field (Scoville et al. 2007 ) resided n denser environments than other quiescent galaxies. Carollo et al. 2013 ) argued that the addition of more large newly quenched earlyype galaxies, as time progresses, is responsible for the apparent ize evolution (a.k.a., the \u2018progenitor bias\u2019, van Dokkum & Franx 996 ; Saglia et al. 2010 ). In this picture, the size growth of quiescent alaxies since z \u223c 2 is of secondary importance.\n(iii) Compact massive quiescent galaxies experience size evoluion via disc growth: a disc-cloaking (E-to-S0/S) scenario raham ( 2013 ) and Graham et al. ( 2015 ) expanded the possible volutionary channels, where instead of only considering elliptical E) galaxies as the end product of red nugget evolution, lenticular S0) and early-type spiral (Sa) galaxies may arise by cloaking the ompact spheroid with a large-scale disc built through minor mergers nd gas accretion. Upon entering a cluster of galaxies with a hot X-ray as halo, any future disc growth via gas accretion and star formation ould naturally be curtailed. The hypothesis of disc-cloaking was upported by a reported lower-limit to the number density of n \u223c . 9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Mpc \u22123 , based on 21 local compact massive spheroids ithin 90 Mpc (Graham et al. 2015 ). It was a lower-limit because he volume was not sampled completely; the 21 systems simply epresented spheroids that had been reported in the literature as aving small sizes and high masses and were known to the authors. heir finding was further supported by de la Rosa et al. ( 2016 ) sing the automatic Bulge + Disc decompositions of local galaxies maged by SDSS (Mendel et al. 2014 ). From a sample of SDSS DR7 alaxies and a surv e y area of 8 , 032 deg 2 at 0.025 < z < 0.15, they ound a number density of local compact bulges ( n \u223c 0.28\u20133 . 12 \u00d7 0 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 ) comparable with the number density of the distant red uggets across multiple size\u2013mass sample-selection criteria (Barro t al. 2013 ; van der Wel et al. 2014 ; van Dokkum et al. 2015 ). Because alaxies can have (truncated) non-exponential discs and more than wo components, such as bars and rings, etc., automated Bulge + Disc ecompositions often fail to provide a reliable measurement of the ulge size and luminosity, which is why we undertook our careful nvestigation.\n.1.2 Differing selection criteria and assumptions\nhe criteria of selecting for the parent sample, measurement of the alaxies\u2019 properties, and the definition of compactness, vary from ne study to another. It will be a monumental task to homogenize ll the data presented in the literature. Instead, we provide a brief escription of various approaches and assumptions commonly made see Table 5 ), and we highlight a few potential causes of discrepancy.\nParent sample: The majority of studies select their parent galaxy et based on the galaxies\u2019 stellar masses, redshifts, and star formation or its proxies, e.g. colour-colour selection). Sometimes the sample is urther restricted by morphology or brightness concentration (S \u0301ersic ndex). Column (2) in Table 5 summaries such unique conditions or several studies. Trujillo et al. ( 2007 ) divided their sample of uminous galaxies into \u2018spheroidal\u2019 (S \u0301ersic index n > 2.5) and \u2018discike\u2019 (S \u0301ersic index n < 2.5) to illustrate the stronger size evolution in pheroids, and the lack thereof in disc galaxies. The Bezanson et al. 2009 ) local sample is morphology-dependent, using the apparent E\u2019 galaxies from Tal et al. ( 2009 ). Some studies did not construct he parent sample based on star formation (Trujillo et al. 2007 , 2009 ; aylor et al. 2010 ), where both quiescent and star-forming galaxies re considered. The sample from Carollo et al. ( 2013 ) is based on he ZEST + morphology classification (an upgraded version from carlata et al. 2007 ), from which they select both massive earlyype (\u2018E/S0\u2019) and late-type (\u2018Sa\u2013cd\u2019) galaxies. Studies that have a arent sample inclusive of all morphologies would not be biased y an E-to-E scenario presumption. Although, depending on the ower mass threshold in their \u2018compactness\u2019 criteria, individual works\night be probing a different population of red nuggets. Indeed, or instance, applying a higher mass selection from Trujillo et al. 2009 ) ( M \u2217/ M \u223c 8 \u00d7 10 10 ) would return a lower number density ompared to that of Poggianti et al. ( 2013b ) ( M \u2217/ M \u223c 10 10 ).\nSize measurements: The method of size measurement varies lightly between studies. The most commonly used method is fitting single S \u0301ersic R 1/n model to the surface brightness profile of the alaxies (e.g. Daddi et al. 2005 ; Trujillo et al. 2007 , 2009 ; Bezanson t al. 2009 ; Valentinuzzi et al. 2010 ; Cassata et al. 2011 ; Mancini t al. 2010 ; Saracco et al. 2010 ; Poggianti et al. 2013a ; Barro et al. 013 ; van der Wel et al. 2014 ; van Dokkum et al. 2015 ). From this, the f fecti ve radius R e (essentially the half-light radius R 1/2 ) is generally sed to represent the size of a galaxy in discussions. Some studies, o we ver, fit the de Vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) R 1/4 model instead. For xample, Taylor et al. ( 2010 ) rely on the parametric measurements rom Strauss et al. ( 2002 ), who used an R 1/4 model to describe the alaxy surface brightness profiles (see also section 3.2 in Taylor et al. 010 , for a rele v ant discussion). F or red nuggets, Damjano v et al. 2009 ) fit the R 1/4 model to their MUNICS (Drory et al. 2001 ) data nd both R 1/4 and R 1/ n models to their GDDS (Abraham et al. 2004 ) ata. If one assumes an R 1/4 model, the ef fecti ve radius could be v erestimated if the galaxy has a S \u0301ersic index n < 4. In Column (3) f Table 5 , we list the measurement method. The colour of an image also affects its size measurement (Kelvin t al. 2012 ; Vulcani et al. 2014 ; Kennedy et al. 2016 ). In Column (4) f Table 5 , we show the band in which the study was conducted. mportantly, the size of early-type galaxies is smaller in the red band s compared to the blue band. As seen in La Barbera et al. ( 2010 ), here is a size decrease by 30 per cent from g - through K -band, and 25 per cent decrease from the H 160 to the r 625 filter (Marian et al. 018 ). Stellar mass: The galaxy stellar mass can be estimated via broadand SED fitting (e.g. Daddi et al. 2005 ; Longhetti et al. 2007 ; Kriek\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nTable 5.

( 2007 ) divided their sample into two groups: the \u2018spheroidlike\u2019 (S \u0301ersic index n > 2.5) and \u2018disc-like\u2019 ( n < 2.5); [h] : Saracco et al. ( 2010 ) selects for galaxies from Giavalisco et al. ( 2004 ) and excluded those with S \u0301ersic index n < 2; [i] : Cassata et al. ( 2011 ) select only the galaxies with a spheroidal morphology under visual inspection, which are the \u2018galaxies with no signs of asymmetry and centrally concentrated\u2019 (see their section 2 ); [a2] : Bezanson et al.

One uch factor is the assumed stellar population model. Most works in able 5 use the Bruzual & Charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population model, xcept for few studies: Valentinuzzi et al. ( 2010 ) uses the Maraston 2005 ) model, where the influence of thermally-pulsating asymptotic iant branch (TP-AGB) stars are considered; Saracco, Longhetti & ndreon ( 2009 ) and Cassata et al. ( 2011 ) use the updated Charlot & ruzual models from 2008 (CB08) and 2009 (CB09), respectively. ccording to Wuyts et al. ( 2007 ), assuming a Maraston ( 2005 ) model v er the Bruzual & Charlot ( 2003 ) model will result in a factor of 1.6 ecrease in stellar mass. Meanwhile, Salimbeni et al. ( 2009 ) found a .2 dex decrease in estimated stellar mass if one adopts CB09 rather han the Bruzual & Charlot ( 2003 ) model.\nAnother factor is the choice of the initial mass function (IMF). ere, we only show, in Column (5) of Table 5 , the IMF used in the\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n2 Among the works listed in Table 5 , only Poggianti et al. ( 2013b ) did not erform SED fitting. Their data source from the PM2GC surv e y (Calvi et al. 011 ) estimates the galaxy stellar mass via the Bell & de Jong ( 2001 ) M / L elation.\nT o m d l i\nespective studies for reference purposes. The Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF s the most widely-used and also the most bottom-light compared to he other contemporaries. The CANDELS-based (Grogin et al. 2011 ; oekemoer et al. 2011 ) size evolution studies (Barro et al. 2013 ; an der Wel et al. 2014 ; van Dokkum et al. 2015 ) all assume the habrier ( 2003 ) IMF. Ho we ver, some lo w-to-intermediate redshift tudies (Bezanson et al. 2009 ; Valentinuzzi et al. 2010 ; Poggianti t al. 2013b ; Carollo et al. 2013 ) instead assume the more bottomeavy Salpeter ( 1955 ) IMF, or the pseudo-Kroupa IMF (Kroupa 001 ) rather than the Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF. Using a Chabrier ( 2003 ) MF will yield 0.24 dex less mass than the Salpeter ( 1955 ) IMF Salimbeni et al. 2009 ). A bottom-heavy IMF could result in higher tellar mass, and therefore, more spheroids will be included by the compact massive\u2019 selection criteria.\nCompactness criteria: As discussed in Section 4.3 , the comactness criteria are usually somewhat arbitrary or it borders the istribution of the general galaxy population\u2019s size\u2013mass relation. he lower mass limit, in particular, can alter the number density f \u2018compact\u2019 systems in one\u2019s sample.

If a study assumes a bottom-heavy IMF and a lower mass limit, ne can expect a higher reported number density.\n.2 The possibility of E-to-E evolution\nur work is fundamentally different from the previously mentioned orks. By not treating galaxies as single-component systems, our\nnalysis provides additional information on the galaxies\u2019 structural eatures. Based on the RC3 morphology, the frequency of alleged \u2018E\u2019 alaxies in our local sample is abundant. Ho we ver, after performing nalysis and decomposition of the galaxy light, the number of lliptical galaxies is revised downward, already weakening the arguent that the high- z red nuggets transformed into today\u2019s elliptical alaxies, simply because the actual number of elliptical galaxies is parse. Only 13/28 originally labelled \u2018E\u2019 galaxies are true ellipticals 11E + 2ES, see Section 3.4 ). This reflects revelations from a quarter f a century ago, whereby the true number of pressure-supported lliptical galaxies was found to be notably lower than previously hought (e.g. D\u2019Onofrio et al. 1995 ; Graham et al. 1998 ).\n.2.1 The morphology of host galaxies with an embedded compact assive spheroid\nhe literature abounds with examples of what were formerly elliptical alaxies that are reclassified as disc galaxies. Early examples are GC 4111 (E7 \u2192 Sa: Adams & Seahes 1937 , their p.31) and GC 3115 (E7 \u2192 S0: Burbidge, Burbidge & Fish 1961 ). Our results cast doubt on the evolutionary scenario of red uggets transforming into elliptical galaxies. In Fig. 19 , we plot the eometric-mean, i.e. circularized, half-light radius and total mass of he host galaxies, shown by the green plus signs (\u2018 + \u2019), and their espective embedded spheroids (shown by the solid red circles). The hree prominent outliers are marked with red hollow circles. 23 The ample shown here are the 55 spheroids that satisfy the compactassive selection criteria of Barro et al. ( 2013 ), the most inclusive riteria. We divided the sample into two categories, they are:\n(i) spheroids embedded in lenticular galaxies 24 (\u2018S0 hosts\u2019, see he upper panel in Fig. 19 ); and\n(ii) spheroids embedded in spiral galaxies (\u2018S hosts\u2019, see the lower anel in Fig. 19 ).\nNone of the compact massive spheroids, as identified using the election criteria of Barro et al. ( 2013 ), are pure elliptical galaxies. A ignificant number of compact massive spheroids with stellar masses bo v e (4\u20135) \u00d7 10 10 M come from S0 host galaxies, while those with tellar masses lower than (4\u20135) \u00d7 10 10 M are slightly more likely to ome from a spiral host galaxy . Additionally , none of the 11E + 2ES alaxies (when using the T11, Z09, or RC15 mass prescriptions)\n3 For the sake of mimicking how most studies measure galaxy size, we se a single S \u0301ersic function to measure the host galaxy\u2019s ef fecti ve radius, lthough we know it is not the best measurement for some galaxies (see also ppendix C ). Case in point, the three outliers are NGC 3158 (S0), IC 983 S), and NGC 3646 (S). All have a disc component with a rather shallow rofile and large scale length h > 20 kpc. Combined with a prominent bulge, his creates a curvature in the surface brightness profile that requires a single  \u0301ersic function with an exceptionally high index ( n > 5). This highlights a roblematic issue with the conventional method of measuring galaxy size and hall be pursued further in future work. 4 The morphologies here refers to the reclassification we introduced in ection 3.4 .\nhighlighted the three prominent outliers with red hollow circles.\ns t i e\n2\n3 D r t\n9 January 2024\natisfy the \u2018compact-massive\u2019 selection criteria of any paper. 25 What his means is that all of our compact massive spheroids are embedded nside either S0 or early-type S galaxies; none are compact massive lliptical galaxies, although a few such galaxies do exist locally.\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\n5 Only when applying the highest stellar mass estimation (IP13), did we find , 3, and 4 \u2018compact massive\u2019 galaxies when using the Barro et al.

( 2009 ) proposed an evolutionary pathway for red uggets, where, through dry minor mergers, the high- z compact alaxies develop a pressure-supported 3D envelope to become the ores of today\u2019s elliptical galaxies. This is a different evolutionary ath to acquiring a rotating 2D disc to become the bulges of today\u2019s enticular galaxies. The answer to differentiating between these two volutionary paths depends on understanding the surface density rofiles of massive local galaxies as a function of radius. One can also esort to kinematic information to ascertain the presence of a rotating isc. Hopkins et al. ( 2009 ) investigated 180 early-type galaxies from auer et al. ( 2007 ) and Kormendy et al. ( 2009 ), and found similarities etween the inner part, \u223c(1\u20135) kpc, of the local early-type galaxy ight profiles and the distant compact massive quiescent galaxies in he sample of van Dokkum et al. ( 2008 ). Earlier in the same year, ezanson et al. ( 2009 ) had reached a similar conclusion, stating that he inner ( R < 1 kpc) stellar densities of local elliptical galaxies re similar to the high- z red nuggets. Possibly due to the difficulty istinguishing E from S0 among ETGs, papers advocating for an Eo-E evolution kept emerging (e.g. Oldham et al. 2017 ; Tortora et al. 020 ; Zhu, Ho & Gao 2021 ), despite the fact that the similarity of he profile\u2019s inner density did not actually pro v e the proposed E-to-E volution o v er an E-to-S0 evolution. Arnold et al. ( 2011 ) suggested inor mergers were building a pressure-supported halo around GC 3115. De, Chattopadhyay & Chattopadhyay ( 2014 ) reported tructural similarity in the inner part at radius R < 1 kpc of local arly-type galaxies with the red nuggets at 2 < z < 7, and virtually no orrelation at R > 10 kpc. Ho we ver, information on the z \u223c 0 number ensity of S0 galaxies with compact massive cores is needed. This equired identifying which early-type galaxies are S0 or E, or ES.\nWhile the studies mentioned abo v e pro vide a le gitimate argument or the inside-out growth scenario, our result provides additional nsight into the nature of this evolution. Those studies generally id not attempt to separate the early-type galaxies into a disc lenticular) and no-disc (true elliptical) systems. By and large, they ssumed evolution into larger pressure-supported systems rather than ntertaining the notion of substantial disc growth to create a different ype of galaxy with significant ordered motion. Barbosa et al. ( 2021b ) onducted a detailed kinematic and population analysis on a bona de elliptical, NGC 3311, and found a compact core, a high- z \u2018relic\u2019 alaxy, is hidden inside R < 2 kpc. Similar studies would be much elcomed to confirm an E-to-E transition. Our bulge-to-disc and isc-to-total ratios reveal that the discs, and their bars and ansae, re nowadays the dominant mass component in many local massive alaxies. This has considerable implications on many fronts, such s the inferred dark matter haloes of massive early-type galaxies mplied from their central velocity dispersion, \u03c3 , via the expression \u223c \u03c3 2 R e, gal (e.g. Poincare & Vergne 1911 ; Zwicky 1937 ; Po v eda 958 , 1961 ). Obviously, the larger R e, gal radii, which are dominated y the size of the disc, is not applicable for use in this expression for virialized, pressure-supported galaxy.\nHopkins et al. ( 2009 ) used data from Kormendy et al. ( 2009 ), a elected set of 27 elliptical (E) galaxies from the Virgo Cluster and ith very few massive galaxies ( M \u2217 > 3 \u00d7 10 11 M ). They modelled ll the E galaxies with a single S \u0301ersic fit. Ho we ver, upon inspection, ome of these galaxies exhibit features which may be a signature f a rotational component. For instance, there is a rising ellipticity profile in IC 3381, IC 3490, IC 3509, NGC 4387, NGC 4482 GC 4486 and NGC 4636, a typical sign for an extended disc; high llipticity section ( > 0.4) in the profile: NGC 4464, NGC 4467, GC 4478, NGC 4515, and NGC 4621 which could indicate the\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nxistence of intermediate scale disc. Hopkins et al. ( 2009 ) also sed data from Lauer et al. ( 2007 ) based on 219 early-type galaxies aken from different sources (Lauer et al. 1995 ; Faber et al. 1997 ; uillen, Bower & Stritzinger 2000 ; Ravindranath et al. 2001 ; Rest t al. 2001 ; Laine et al. 2002 ; Lauer et al. 2005 ). In terms of orphologies, roughly half of the sample was thought to be \u2018E\u2019, quarter of them \u2018S0\u2019, and the other quarter \u2018BCG\u2019 according to he RC3 classifications. Most BCGs are ellipticals, yet without a\nulticomponent analysis of kinematic data, the nature of the alleged E\u2019 galaxies is not confirmed.\nThe local galaxy sample used by Bezanson et al. ( 2009 ) came from al et al. ( 2009 ), with well-defined distances (15 Mpc < Dist. < 0 Mpc) and absolute magnitude ( M B < \u221220 mag). They pointed ut half of their sample exhibits morphological disturbance features, uch as shells and tidal tails, implying heavy interactions with their nvironments.\nDe et al. ( 2014 ) supports the 3D envelope scenario based on the hree-S \u0301ersic-component decompositions by Huang et al. ( 2013 ) on he Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey data (Ho et al. 2011 ). The 94 alaxies they investigated used to model listed as \u2018E\u2019 in the RC3 lassifications. Huang et al. ( 2013 ) used three S \u0301ersic functions to escribe the inner, middle, and outer region of the galaxy. They found high correlation between the inner region of the local galaxies and he high- z red nuggets but not the outer region, hence concluding he red nuggets went through a multistage buildup in an insideut manner. This, ho we ver, does not rule out disc gro wth. Indeed, as uang et al. ( 2013 ) pointed out in their table 1, the following galaxies ave an edge-on disc: ESO 221-G026, NGC 3585, and NGC 7029, nd these: IC 4797, NGC 584, NGC 3904, NGC 4033, NGC 4697, GC 6673, NGC 7145, NGC 7192, NGC 7507 are possibly S0 alaxies. Instead of a multi-layered elliptical galaxy, there could be any S0 galaxies in the mix, and the inner region of these galaxies s, in fact, the bulge. As we have established in Section 3.4 , without exploring the alactic substructure, the morphology of early-type galaxies is often istaken. Instead of comparing the high- z quiescent galaxies to rue elliptical galaxies, the comparisons are essentially being made sing many local lenticular galaxies. It is likely that many of the lle ged low-density 3D env elopes are actually 2D rotating discs seen omewhat face-on. Rather than evidence of 3D envelope growth, any of the galaxies used in the abo v e studies instead support the D disc cloaking process.\n.3 Disc growth\n.3.1 Evidence of disc accretion\nyman- \u03b1 gas clouds are observed within 500 kpc of high- z galaxies f all types (Wakker & Savage 2009 ; Prochaska et al. 2011 ; Thom t al. 2011 ; Stocke et al. 2013 ; Tumlinson et al. 2013 ). For instance, ouch \u0301e et al. ( 2013 ) used a background quasar to trace the nearby as (damped Lyman absorber 26 kpc away) of a star-forming galaxy t z = 2.3 with a typical rotational disc, according to its kinematics F \u0308orster Schreiber et al. 2009 ). The kinematics of the gas shows a ignature of cold accretion, where it appears to be low-metallicity, colanar, and co-rotational compared to its disc. In the local Universe, occato et al. ( 2013 ) examined the two counter-rotating discs in both GC 3593 (S0/a) and NGC 4550 (S0), where the secondary discs iffer from the primary discs in metallicity and stellar populations. hey fa v our a scenario of gas accretion forming the second disc 2\u20137 Gyr ago.\na e d i d d\nt K \u223c \u223c F a B s ( e\ng p a c 2 e e T i e A t h e l a m g\nt t e \u2018 i K a h T 8 a\ng s r B S s s\n2\nd t\ng t g ( o a r r f n\n6\n6\nI ( C e m v S ( R N e h ( v B s o T a r s a s ( I v g\ng p ( o fi t 2 F C b m I m\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nHigh- z red nuggets are reported to have reached their peak bundance at z \u223c 1.2\u20131.6, and dropped in number ever since (Barro t al. 2013 ; van der Wel et al. 2014 ; van Dokkum et al. 2015 ). The isappearance of these galaxies through the growth of discs may nvolve the creation of star-forming galaxies (should much of the isc stars be built from accreted gas) or not (when the bulk of the isc is built from accreted galaxies with little gas). There is an abundance of evidence from different approaches hat confirm the prominence of discs in local early-type galaxies. aviraj et al. ( 2007 ) investigated the UV and optical photometry of 2100 SDSS early-type galaxies at 0 < z < 0.11 and found at least 30 per cent exhibit recent ( \u223c1 Gyr ago) star formation activity. abricius et al. ( 2014 ) performed a detailed analysis of NGC 7217, spheroid-dominated galaxy (classified as an early-type spiral in uta et al. 1995 ) with two distinct rotational components. The active tar formation of the rotational structures suggested an ongoing re)growth of the stellar disc. While this process is truncated in cluster nvironments, it can still occur in the field (e.g. Graham et al. 2017 ).\nWhile \u2018cosmic noon\u2019 has passed, and there are less substantial cold as clouds nearby for galaxies to accrete, it is an ongoing, downsizing henomenon. The kinematics of the gas shows a signature of cold ccretion, where it appears to be low-metallicity, coplanar, and orotational compared to its disc (see also, Kacprzak et al. 2010 , 015 ; Stewart et al. 2013 ; Nielsen et al. 2017 ; Martin et al. 2019 ; Zabl t al. 2019 ). Davis et al. ( 2011 ) examined the gaseous content of local arly-type galaxies with CO and H I interferometric observations. he kinematic misalignment between the gas and stellar components mplied that 42 per cent of the gas in field galaxies (fast rotators) is x situ in origin, namely from cold accretion and minor mergers. 26\nlatalo et al. ( 2013 ) investigated the morphology of molecular gas hrough CO imaging by the CARMA ATLAS 3D surv e y, finding alf of the 40 CO-rich early-type galaxies exhibit a CO disc. They stimated (with a correction factor from Kaviraj et al. 2012 ) the ower mass limit to the total accreted gas to be 2 . 48 \u00d7 10 10 M cross 15 galaxies, a value consistent with the mass brought in by inor mergers (Lotz et al. 2008 ) and thus the accretion of not just as but also stars from smaller galaxies. As mentioned before, the e xtensiv e kinematic observations from he ATLAS 3D surv e y rev ealed that the majority of the local earlyype galaxies are \u2018fast rotators\u2019 (Emsellem et al. 2011 ). Krajnovi \u0301c t al. ( 2011 ) shows that most early-type galaxies ( \u223c82 per cent) are regular rotators\u2019 (defined in Kinemetry , Krajnovi \u0301c et al. 2006 , 2008 ), n the sense that the velocity maps are dominated by ordered rotation. rajnovi \u0301c et al. ( 2013b ) performed Bulge + Disc decompositions on set of 180 of the non-barred galaxies. They found that galaxies with igh angular momentum ( \u03bbe ) also have a large disc-to-total flux ratio. he combination of kinematics and photometric results revealed that 3 per cent of their early-type galaxies have a rotational disc that ccounts for around \u223c40 per cent the stellar mass of a galaxy.\nOur result highlighted the abundance of discs in massive local alaxies, providing strong support for the disc growth (cloaking) cenario. The cyclical nature of galaxy metamorphosis has been ecognized widely in simulations (White & Rees 1978 ; Navarro & enz 1991 ; White & Frenk 1991 ; Bournaud & Combes 2002 ; teinmetz & Navarro 2002 ). If disc cloaking were to occur to our pheroids, and, subsequently, build up an extended disc and other ubstructures in an inside-out manner, the systems will experience\n6 Note that only 22 per cent of early-type galaxies in their surv e y has etectable molecular gas (Young et al. 2011 ). The gas content in local earlyype galaxies is evident but not at all prominent.\ns m u C s\nrowth in both size and mass. They would migrate outward (see he blue arrows, in Fig. 19 ) from the compact massive region (the reen shaded area) in the size\u2013mass diagram and become the massive M \u2217/ M > 10 11 ) local S0 and S galaxies. Depending on the nature f the minor mergers (wet or dry) and the amount of cold stream gas ccretion, the galaxies may also migrate outside of the \u2018quiescent\u2019 egion in the colour\u2013colour diagram to enter the \u2018star-forming\u2019 blue egion because of the newly built rotational discs. With time, star ormation in these discs turns off, and a quenched, lenticular galaxy ow mo v es back into the \u2018quiescent\u2019 re gion with a larger o v erall size.\n.4 Important caveats\n.4.1 The role of IMF in stellar mass estimation\nt is questionable whether there is a universal IMF among galaxies Cenarro et al. 2003 ; Bastian, Co v e y & Me yer 2010 ; van Dokkum & onroy 2010 ; Cappellari et al. 2012 ; Ferreras et al. 2013 ; La Barbera t al. 2013 ; Smith 2014 ; Spiniello et al. 2014 ). The slope of the lowass end of the IMF is thought to be directly correlated with the elocity dispersion of galaxies (Ferreras et al. 2013 ; Dom \u0301\u0131nguez  \u0301anchez et al. 2019 ) and, consequently, the colour of galaxies Dutton, Mendel & Simard 2012 ; Pforr, Maraston & Tonini 2012 ; icciardelli et al. 2012 ; Vazdekis et al. 2012 ). For example, Mart \u0301\u0131navarro et al. ( 2015 ) analysed the \u2018relic\u2019 galaxy NGC 1277 (Graham t al. 2016a ) that is compact (1\u20132 kpc) and has an exceptionally igh velocity dispersion ( \u03c3 > 400 km s \u22121 , see also Ferr \u0301e-Mateu et al. 2017 ) for its detailed features). Ho we ver, the IMF correlation with elocity dispersion has been called into doubt. Importantly, from one CG, NGC 3311, Barbosa et al. ( 2021a ) presented an important case howing the IMF- \u03c3 correlation to be invalid, a mere coincidence that ld stars are found in the area of a galaxy with high dispersion. hey found the tightest relations to be between stellar age-to-IMF nd radius-to-IMF. They found the IMF to be bottom-heavy and equiring a high \u03d2 \u2217. Ferr \u0301e-Mateu, Vazdekis & de la Rosa ( 2013 ) has ho wn the non-uni versality, whereby adjusting the slope of the IMFs ccording to the central velocity dispersion yields a more comparable tar formation history among the early-type galaxies. While Smith 2014 ) pointed out the discrepancy between methods for probing the MF of galaxies, based on the data from ATLAS 3D and Conroy & an Dokkum ( 2012b ), there was a broad agreement that elliptical alaxies have a more bottom-heavy IMF.\nIf a bottom-heavy IMF is indeed better suited for high dispersion alaxies, then among the MLCRs in Section 2.3 , IP13 perhaps ortrays a more accurate stellar mass since it assumes the Kroupa 1998 ) IMF \u2013 yielding log ( M \u2217/ L ) ratios 0.225 dex lower than those btained with the Salpeter ( 1955 ) IMF, see Flynn et al. ( 2006 , their g. 12) \u2013 instead of the more bottom-light Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF or he Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF (see also Ferreras et al. 2013 ; Kroupa et al. 013 ). Although, there is plenty of evidence (Cenarro et al. 2003 ; alc \u0301on-Barroso et al. 2003 ; Vazdekis et al. 2003 ; van Dokkum & onroy 2010 ; Spiniello et al. 2012 ; Conroy & van Dokkum 2012a , ; van Dokkum & Conroy 2012 ) indicating there are more lowass stars in elliptical galaxies than even the most bottom-heavy MF (Salpeter 1955 ) predicts. This implies that even our highest ass estimation (the IP13 masses) is an underestimation of the real tellar mass. Throughout this work, ho we ver, the relati ve stellar ass compared to the high- z measurements is more important to s. Because the studies of high- z red nuggets assume a bottom-light habrier ( 2003 ) IMF, for comparison purposes, we need to apply the ame assumption as we estimate the spheroids\u2019 stellar mass (T11 and\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nR p\n6 n\nI a m s t e\nb e f d 2 N 1 T t t 1 2 ( s 2\nt g t t r d t m b o s e M G 2\nh d T d h B t 0 < G ( l f (\ni\nB h s s\n6\nB 4 d i s\nS b l T o l c C t e\ne w p t m ( v v a i D a n I 3 D\nc ( a i ( e m i\nm n r l T f d 2 R\nD\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nC15 MLCRs), even if the real stellar mass is larger than what was resented in Fig. 15 .\n.4.2 The similarity between local spheroids and distant red ug g ets\nn order to fully pro v e that high- z red nuggets and local spheroids re drawn from the same population, we need matching sizes, stellar asses (and thus stellar densities), internal dynamic features and tellar populations. Such a full comparison for our sample is beyond he scope of this paper but is perhaps not required given the extensive vidence in the literature.\nThe bulges of lenticular galaxies and high- z quiescent galaxies oth have high velocity dispersions. For example, Martinez-Manso t al. ( 2011 ) reported on a range of dispersions, \u03c3 \u223c 156\u2013236 km s \u22121 , or four red nuggets at z \u223c 1 taken from Trujillo et al. ( 2007 ). van e Sande et al. ( 2013 ) measured five galaxies at z \u223c 2 to have \u03c3 \u223c 90\u2013450 km s \u22121 . These highest values appear as outliers after Belli, ewman & Ellis ( 2014 ) analysed 56 quiescent galaxies at 0.9 < z < .6 and obtained each galaxy\u2019s mean velocity dispersion within R e, gal . hey found an average \u3008 \u03c3 e \u3009 value of 219 km s \u22121 . For comparison, in he local Universe, the MASSIVE survey (Ma et al. 2014 ) reports on he central velocity dispersions \u03c3 c for 90 early-type galaxies within 04 Mpc. They are in the range of \u03c3 c \u223c 200\u2013350 km s \u22121 (Veale et al. 017 ). In the redshift range 0.15 z 0.5, Scognamiglio et al. 2020 ) detected 19 UCMGs ( M \u2217/ M > 8 \u00d7 10 10 and R e < 1 . 5kpc) panning a range of 200 \u03c3/ km s \u22121 400 (see also, Tortora et al. 016 , 2018 , 2020 ; Barbosa et al. 2021b ). Local spheroids are also known to contain old stellar populations hat existed at high- z. Saracco et al. ( 2009 ) showed 32 early-type alaxies at 1 < z < 2 which exhibit two distinct stellar populations: he old ( \u223c3.5 Gyr) and young ( \u223c1 Gyr) stars, implying the earlyype galaxies exist at least since z > 3\u20133.5. Peletier et al. ( 2007 ) also eached the same conclusion from the perspective of stellar velocity ispersion dips. MacArthur et al. ( 2009 , see their table 4) found hat in local spiral galaxy bulges, old stellar populations ( > 10 Gyr)\nake up the majority of the mass budget. Regardless of whether the ulges of local galaxies formed via outside-in (i.e. secular evolution) r inside-out (i.e. mergers and/or accretion) scenarios, the structural imilarity to high- z red nuggets is now well established. Although, vidence from stellar population studies (Proctor & Sansom 2002 ; oorthy & Holtzman 2006 ; Thomas & Davies 2006 ; Jablonka, orgas & Goudfrooij 2007 ; MacArthur et al. 2008 ; Saracco et al. 009 ) fa v our the inside-out process in early-type galaxies. The stellar densities are also comparable between local bulges and igh- z red nuggets (Graham 2013 , his fig. 1), which have half-light ensities higher than local early-type galaxies of the same mass. his is because the discs of local lenticular galaxies \u2013 which tend to ominate these galaxies\u2019 stellar mass budget \u2013 increase the galaxies\u2019 alf-light radii but not in an economical space-filling fashion. The ulge + Disc decompositions from de la Rosa et al. ( 2016 ) also show he size\u2013mass relation o v erlaps (see their fig. 3); the red nuggets at .18 < z < 1 share almost the same relation and galaxies at 1 z < 1.8 have a similar slope, but are slightly more compact. raham ( 2013 ) further showed that local dwarf \u2018compact elliptical\u2019 cE) galaxies have similar sizes, stellar masses, and densities as ocal low-mass bulges, suggesting that they are the (largely) discree counterparts of lower mass bulges, just as red nuggets are the largely) disc-free counterparts of high-mass bulges.\nGraham et al. ( 2015 ) also illustrated that the o v erlap in the (S \u0301ersic ndex, n )\u2013(ef fecti ve radius, R e ) diagram (their fig. 3, primarily from\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nulge + Disc decompositions of local galaxies) between bulges and igh- z red nuggets from Damjanov et al. ( 2011 ). Given the structural imilarity , they , therefore, concluded that not all compact massive pheroids have gone through significant size evolution since z < 2.5.\n.4.3 Contributions from the Virgo Cluster\nin 3 is of particular interest. Bin 3 captured galaxies within Dist. < 5 Mpc, a space containing the Virgo Cluster. Not only is it complete own to the lowest galaxy stellar mass ( M \u2217 (IP13) = 10 11 M ), t also yields the highest number density for compact massive pheroids.\nIn Fig. 20 , we show the location of our host galaxies in the sky. mall black dots are all the galaxies in the SDSS field bounded y our angular selection (equation 1). One can clearly see the arge-scale filament structures in the local Universe manifesting. he blue points are the 103 host galaxies in our sample. Since we nly select for massive galaxies, it is natural that most of them ive in dense environments. One can see the blue points largely oincide with the o v erdensity re gions. The red points are the Virgo luster host galaxies. There are 22 out of 52 galaxies in Bin 3 hat are in the Extended Virgo Cluster Catalogue (EVCC; Kim t al. 2014a ).\nUsing the less restrictive Barro et al. ( 2013 ) and Damjanov t al. ( 2014 ) sample selection criteria, Bin 3 is more abundant ith compact massive spheroids than the peak of the red nugget opulation ( n c , Sph , Bin3 > max(n RN )) across all stellar masses. Note hat the n c, Sph, Bin3 here corresponds to the respective \u2018compact\nassive\u2019 selection criteria as the high- z nuggets\u2019 peak abundance max(n RN )). When using the more restrictive selection criteria from an der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) and van Dokkum et al. ( 2015 ), our result aries depending on the stellar mass estimates (Fig. 18 ). With T11 nd Z09 stellar mass, no compact massive spheroid was found n Bin 3 with the restricti ve v an der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) and van okkum et al. ( 2015 ) criteria. With RC15 stellar mass, Bin 3 has lower number of compact massive spheroids to the red nuggets, c , Sph , Bin3 < max(n RN ) (around 0.66\u20130.78 difference). Finally, in P13 stellar mass, n c, Sph, Bin3 is slightly higher than max(n RN ), by 8 per cent in van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) criteria and 52 per cent in van okkum et al. ( 2015 ) criteria. The high number density in Bin 3 reinforces the idea that the loaking process is more pre v alent among the low-mass spheroids 1 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217, Sph (RC15)/M < 4 \u00d7 10 10 ). Because Bin 3 has lower stellar mass selection limit as compared to Bins 1 and 2, t samples some extra low-mass galaxies (6 . 7 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217, gal / M RC15) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 11 ). The low-mass spheroids are likely to experince drastic disc growth since z \u223c 1.5, creating galaxies with stellar ass range 6 . 7 \u00d7 10 10 < M \u2217, gal / M (RC15) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 11 , thereby ncreasing the number density in Bin 3. Having roughly half of the galaxies in Bin 3 being Virgo Cluster embers, we examine if the cluster affects the estimation of the umber density of the compact massive spheroids. We do so by emoving the Virgo Cluster galaxies from our sample and recalcuating the number density of compact massive spheroids in Bin 3. able 6 shows the resulting number densities using the four criteria or defining compact massive spheroids (Barro et al. 2013 ; van er Wel et al. 2014 ; Damjanov et al. 2014 ; van Dokkum et al. 015 ) and using the four stellar mass estimates (T11, Z09, IP13, C15). With the restrictive selection criteria (van der Wel et al. 2014 ; van\nokkum et al. 2015 ), we found a similar number of compact massive\nFigure 20. The spatial distribution of the galaxies. The parent sample selected by the angular boundaries from equation (1) is marked in black dots. The 103 galaxies selected by the three bins (equation 5) are marked as the blue circles. Among these 103 galaxies, the ones that are the members of the Virgo Cluster are marked as red circles.\ns e s 6 ( d w C s d a n w a f\n6\nI 2 a h 1 ( f\n( D\ns p a 4 F n t c c a s c d s t f M h v\n\u03c3 2 a \u03c3 s U c o ( o\ni a t ( 4 2 o c t s t g s\n6\nW t (\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/3/3410/6575934 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\npheroids as before. With the less restrictive selection criteria (Barro t al. 2013 ; Damjanov et al. 2014 ), the numbers of compact massive pheroids are roughly halved. Because the reduction ( \u223c58 per cent\u2013 1 per cent) is comparable to the number of remo v ed Virgo members \u223c42 per cent), we, therefore, conclude the Virgo Cluster o v erensity does not increase Bin 3\u2019s number density in any significant ay. Our wide-sky coverage prevented a potential bias as the Virgo luster takes up less than one-eighth of the area in the R.A. and Dec election window (see Fig. 20 ). Moreo v er, with the reduced number ensities ( n c, Sph, Bin3 \u2248 (0.3\u20135 . 0) \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 ), Bin 3 still contains comparable number of compact massive spheroids to the peak red ugget density (max(n RN ) \u2248 (1 . 8\u20132 . 4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 ). Thus, even ithout the influence of the Virgo Cluster, there remains a sizable mount of compact massive spheroids in Bin 3, sufficient to account or the missing red nuggets. .4.4 Some distant red nug g ets may also have discs\nt is unclear whether the original red nuggets (from Daddi et al. 005 ; van Dokkum et al. 2008 ; Damjanov et al. 2009 ) are devoid of ny disc growth. From visual inspection, some galaxies exhibit discy, igh-ellipticity isophotes. For example, galaxy numbers: \u20184950\u2019 ( z = .55) from Daddi et al. ( 2005 ); \u20181030-1813\u2019 ( z = 2.56), \u20181030-2559\u2019 z = 2.39), \u20181256-142\u2019 ( z = 2.37), and \u2018HDFS1-1849\u2019 ( z = 2.31) rom van Dokkum et al. ( 2008 ); and \u201822-0189\u2019 ( z = 1.49), \u201815-4367\u2019\nz = 1.725), \u2019S7F5 254\u2019 ( z = 1.22), and \u2019S7F5 045\u2019 ( z = 1.45) from amjanov et al. ( 2009 ). The existence of (nascent) discs in some high- z galaxies is upported by van der Wel et al. ( 2011 ). They found a significant ortion of the compact massive quiescent galaxies ( M \u2217/M > 10 10.8 , nd R e < 2 kpc) are flattened in projection, thus concluding that 0 per cent\u201365 per cent of red nuggets at z \u223c 2 are disc-dominated. err \u0301e-Mateu et al. ( 2012 ) also found elongated morphologies in red uggets at z > 1 and classified them as fast rotators. One may herefore question whether those red nuggets are genuinely singleomponent systems. While spheroids can rotate, it is certainly the ase that the low-resolution of images at high- z will blend the bulges nd discs together to create the appearance of a single-component ystem. Indeed, e ven at lo w z, astronomers have struggled for a entury to separate S0 galaxies from E galaxies. As such, the isc inclination angle and dust content will further complicate the ituation. The shrouding dust heated by star formation will redden he galaxies\u2019 light (P \u0301erez-Gonz \u0301alez et al. 2008 ). Interestingly, a ew notable local \u2018relic\u2019 galaxies (NGC 1277, PCG 032873, and\nrk 1216), that are believed to be untouched by ex-situ processes, ave strong stellar rotation. NGC 1277 has a rotational velocity r \u223c 300 km s \u22121 in the outer region and a central velocity dispersion 0 > 300 km s \u22121 (Trujillo et al. 2014 ). In (Ferr \u0301e-Mateu et al. 017 , see their fig. 2), both PCG 032873 and Mrk 1216 exhibit rotational velocity of v r \u223c 200 km s \u22121 and central dispersion of 0 \u223c 320 km s \u22121 , implying, indeed, they are not single-component ystems. These systems may have accreted and grown their discs. ntil they transition through the ES to S0 phase, they may remain ompact massive galaxies. This may e ven concei v ably explain some f the youthfulness seen in some ultracompact massive galaxies Spiniello et al. 2021 ), although we note this is just speculation n our part. It will be interesting to perform structural decompositions on ntermediate- and high- z galaxies when high-quality images become vailable from facilities such as the European Southern Observaory\u2019s Very Large Telescope interferometer, equipped with PIONIER 1.6 \u03bcm ; Le Bouquin et al. 2011 ), GRAVITY (2.0\u20132.4 \u03bcm imager; mas seeing using the four 8-m Unit Telescopes; Gillessen et al. 010 ; Eisenhauer et al. 2011 ), and MAVIS (optical, under develpment; McDermid et al. 2020 ; Rigaut et al. 2020 ). Subsequently, osmological simulations involving disc cloaking can be tested if he observed high-mass end of the spheroid mass function, and the pheroid size\u2013mass relation can be reproduced, reported here for he local Universe. Careful analysis will enable one to measure the rowth of discs in early-type galaxies, shifting the focus away from pheroids \u2013 which appear to be relatively inert.\n.5 Summary and conclusions\ne defined volume- and mass-limited samples of local galaxies from he SDSS that are nondiscriminatory against galaxy morphology Section 2 ).

We have discussed how the different masso-light ratios (Section 2.3 ) and distance measurements (Section 2.4 ) ould affect the estimation of the stellar masses and sizes of he galaxies and their spheroids. A detailed, case-by-case study f 103 galaxies w as undertak en. We performed multicomponent ecompositions (Section 3.3 ) on the surface brightness profiles of ach galaxy. Rather than using automated routines which blindly t several S \u0301ersic components, we carefully examined each image nd identified the morphological features that are present. This was urther supported by recourse to the literature, in particular, studies ncluding kinematic data or high-resolution HST data. This enabled considerable impro v ement upon the conv entional Bulge + Disc ecomposition. Our analysis encompasses the less prominent yet mportant substructures (i.e. bars, ansae , spiral arms, nuclear discs, ntermediate-scale discs, etc.), which can skew the bulge parameters f not taken into account. From our investigation, we have made the ollo wing observ ations.\n(i) New morphological classifications were required, and made, or the galaxies. Previously o v erlooked substructures, such as largend intermediate-scale discs, are now incorporated into the descripion of the morphology (Section 3.4 ). This is important because he morphology reflects the physical processes which shaped the alaxies\u2019 evolution.\n(ii) Implications from the low number of \u2018true elliptical\u2019 galaxies n the local Universe rule out the dominance of the popular E-to-E volutionary path whereby quasi-spherical 3D envelopes accumulate round red nuggets for relati vely lo w-mass red nuggets ( M \u2217/ M < \u00d7 10 10 ). The possibility of such an E-to-E scenario is discussed in ection 6.2 . (iii) Morphology-dependent B / T flux ratios are presented for the assive galaxies in Fig. 12 (Section 4.1 ). (iv) We provided the mass function of the local spheroids down to tellar mass M \u2217/ M \u223c (0 . 24\u20131.8) \u00d7 10 10 (Section 4.2 ). Most masive spheroids ( M \u2217/ M (RC15) > 3 \u00d7 10 11 ) are not simultaneously mall ( R e < 2 kpc).\n(v) The size\u2013mass distribution of the local spheroids is presented Section 4.3 ). The number density of \u2018compact\u2019 and \u2018massive\u2019 pheroids is obtained based on five different selection criteria.\n(vi) We compared the number density of local compact massive pheroids with intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies. The evoluionary trend for the number density of compact massive quiescent ystems is presented in Fig. 17 , based on four different sample election criteria (Sections 5.2 and 5.3 ).\nTwo important insights can be drawn from our results:\n(i) The local elliptical galaxies are not as abundant as previously elieved. Among the 28 supposed elliptical galaxies (E), 20 are acually lenticular galaxies (S0). There are only \u223c11 per cent (11/103) rue elliptical galaxies, plus 2 ES galaxies, in our sample.\n(ii) We found compact massive spheroids hidden in the local enticular and early-type spiral galaxies. Working with our host alaxies\u2019 selection limit ( M \u2217, gal / M (RC15) > 6.7 \u00d7 10 10 ), we resent a range of lower limits of the number density to the compact assive spheroid of n c, Sph \u223c (0.17\u20131 . 20) \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 , as defined y different definitions of \u2018compact massive\u2019 systems. If relatively ow-mass ( M \u2217/ M \u223c (1\u20134) \u00d7 10 10 ) spheroids are included, then here are sufficient numbers of compact massive spheroids ( n c , Sph \u223c . 20 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Mpc \u22123 ) to match the peak in the number density of red uggets when defined using the same mass and size criteria. f we select for only high-mass spheroids ( M \u2217/ M > 4 \u00d7 10 10 ), the umber densities for compact massive spheroids and true ellipti-\nNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nals are comparable ( n c, Sph n E + ES ). Ho we ver, in the high-mass ange, the uncertainty in stellar mass estimation makes it difficult o conclude which evolution dominates by number density alone Section 5.4 ). Interestingly, for M \u2217, gal / M (RC15) > 6.7 \u00d7 10 10 and ist. < 45 Mpc (Bin 3), we found more compact massive spheroids han the red nuggets\u2019 peak abundance: n c , Sph , Bin3 > max(n RN ), inspite f the influence from Virgo Cluster galaxies.\nCollectively, this calls the frequency of the E-to-E scenario into oubt, while the disc-cloaking scenario is now more salient than ever. n E-to-E evolution and disc-cloaking create distinctly different end roducts. If we are to truly understand galaxies, and the cosmological volution of galaxies, this distinction is of key importance.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhis research was supported under the Australian Research Council\u2019s unding scheme DP17012923 and by Tamkeen under the New York niversity Abu Dhabi Research Institute grant CAP 3 .

Guemligen, Switzerland\nPPENDIX A : DISTANCE C O R R E C T I O N\nhe variation among the four different distance measurements that e explored turns out not to be significant in regard to the number ensity of compact massive spheroids. We show these distance easurements in the forest plot of Fig. A1 . The W1997, M2000, osmicflow-3 (Kourkchi et al. 2020 ), and z-independent distances re labelled in green, blue, purple, and orange points, respectively. he mean differences between each set of distances span 3.16 to 7.54 pc, while the standard de viations v ary from 2.38 to 4.95 Mpc. The alues and sources of the various z-independent distances are listed n Table A1 .\nCosmicflow-3 has the most sophisticated model to date, and it was uilt from the largest observational data set among the three modelased choices. The main issue of Cosmicflow-3 is the triple-value egion, where the gravity of the Virgo Cluster is significant enough o bend the velocity\u2013distance relation into a cubic equation. Galaxies esiding within 7\u201321 Mpc, therefore, have two or three solutions possible distances) for the same recessional velocity. In Fig. A1 , e highlighted such objects with extended error bars (NGC 4374, GC 4429, NGC 4459, NGC 4636, NGC 4643, NGC 4845, GC 4649, and NGC 4772), in which the upper and lower limits epresent the high and low estimation of the distance, respectively. We used the redshift-independent distance as the primary distance o calculate the luminosity of the spheroids and galaxies in our\ner on 19 January 2024\nample. The only exceptions are NGC 4874 (an SBF distance), GC 5440 (an SNIa distance), and NGC 4233 (an SBF distance), here all of them exhibit a large error ( > 10 Mpc). In these cases, we se the Cosmicflow-3 value instead. In total, 19 galaxies\u2019 total and pheroidal stellar mass are obtained via z-independent distances. ther than these 19 galaxies, we primarily used the Cosmicflowdistance, in total, for 81 galaxies. There are an additional three alaxies that are within the triple-value region but which do not ave z-independent measurements: NGC 4845, NGC 4643, and GC 4429. In all three cases, the W1997 distances lie within the riple-value region, with a reasonable agreement with the median alue of the Cosmicflow-3 distance. For these galaxies, we elect o use the W1997 distances, derived from empirical TF-relation, nstead. The adopted distances for all 103 galaxies are provided in able C1 .\nMNRAS 514, 3410\u20133451 (2022)\nM\nFigure A1. Distances using different models. The pink zone is the area outside of the selection volume. The purple points are the Cosmicflow-3 (Kourkchi et al. 2020 ) distances, the blue points are the M2000 distances, and the green points are the W1997 distances. The orange points are a blanket label for the redshift-independent measurements from various sources; see Table A1 . Galaxies are listed in descending (westward) order, according to right ascension.

This peaks directly to the stellar masses that we have derived. Sev eral ke y factors contrib ute to the error b udget of the estimated tellar mass.\n(i) The innate stellar population model de generac y, between age nd metallicity, is reported to constitute a small error of 0.1\u20130.2 dex rom idealized mock galaxy studies (Gallazzi & Bell 2009 ).\n(ii) A more prominent error comes from the systematic treatments f the \u2018priors\u2019. The IMF provides the normalization factor for the LCRs, and its uncertainty affects the M \u2217/ L ratio. F or e xample, here can be a change of up to 0.3 dex in mass if one assumes a habrier ( 2003 ) o v er a Salpeter ( 1955 ) IMF (RC15). (iii) Another obvious factor is the stellar population model. The ost widely used prescription is the BC03 Stellar Population Synhesis (SPS) model. It provides a comprehensive library of the stellar opulation that was validated by agreement with early data from he SDSS. Over the years, the community has been continuously pdating the model by including previously unconsidered stellar sochrones. The most notable issue plaguing stellar population odels is the influence of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant ranch (TP-AGB) stars. Multiple studies (e.g. Maraston 1998 , 2005 ) ave pointed out that the excess light from the young ( \u223c1 Gyr) P-AGB star\u2019s emission can lead us to an underestimation of the \u2217/ L ratio. This effect is particularly relevant for near-infrared (NIR) tudies, as the inclusion of TP-AGB stars (Bruzual 2007a , b ) in the enewed version of the BC03 SPS model in 2007 (commonly known s the CB07 SPS in the literature, see the MAGPHYS da Cunha, harlot & Elbaz 2008 library) results in M \u2217/ L ratio changes of 0.1 nd 0.4 dex in the optical and NIR, respectively (Z09).\n(iv) Treatment of the interstellar medium (ISM) and dust attenuaion also changes the percei ved light. IP13 sho w the effect of omitting ust attenuation in their fig. 13. In a dusty scenario, the mass-to-light elation can change by up to 0.5 dex in the case of an inclined disc see also Driver et al. 2007a , 2008 ).\nGiven the need to appreciate how the stellar masses of the high- z alaxies were obtained by different authors, we identify and briefly escribe each MLCR they used.\n(i) Z09 assumes the Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF, the CB07 SPS, and he dust attenuation from Charlot & Fall ( 2000 ). The M \u2217/ L ratio is roduced using the fiducial mass reconstruction method by Monte arlo sampling from the CB07 library, with parameters advised by auffmann et al. ( 2003 ). The M \u2217/ L ratio is then mapped on to the olour space of ( g \u2212 i ) and ( i \u2212 H ) to build their MLCR shown n equation ( 3a ). They verified this by comparing it to nine local alaxies within 30 Mpc.\n(ii) Both T11 and RC15 used the Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF and the C03 SPS, which, as we have seen, has been the most commonly sed assumption in the literature when calculating the stellar masses f high- z galaxies. Given the assumed dust attenuation law from alzetti et al. ( 2000 ), T11 calculated the stellar mass by fitting he SED from early Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA DR1) road-band photometry data via Bayesian probability minimization. mong the abo v e-mentioned MLCRs, T11 is the only one that s built empirically from the ground up. The GAMA data co v ers he intermediate-redshift range ( z < 0.65; median z = 0.2) and\nagnitudes r petro < 19.4\u201319.8 mag. Ho we ver, claim has been made\nhat T11\u2019s MLCR underestimated the M / L ratio for early-type spirals nd ellipticals (Schombert, McGaugh & Lelli 2022 ).\n(iii) RC15 constructed their MLCR via mock galaxies using the AGPHYS library (da Cunha et al. 2008 ). The mock galaxy SEDs\nndergo Bayesian fitting on girzH bands to reco v er the stellar masses. he MLCR yields excellent agreement with the observational SHIVir urv e y (\u2019Spectroscopy and H -band imaging of Virgo Cluster galaxes\u2019; McDonald et al. 2011 ) data, having mean residuals of \u22120.01 dex nd 0.05 dex (see their fig. 6). ith the same IMF and SPS as T11, RC15 is different in several ways.\nirst, RC15 assume a different dust treatment (Charlot & Fall 2000 ) ith two-component models accounting for the dust in molecular\nlouds and the ambient ISM. Secondly, RC15 suggests that T11 did ot include bursts in their model SFHs, while MAGPHYS contains andom burst models superimposed in the SFH. Both works are alidated by their respective observational data: one of which focuses n the nearby Virgo Cluster galaxies and the other on galaxies at ntermediate redshifts. The considerable discrepancy between them Fig. 2 ) might arise from the use of different data sets.\n(iv) Finally, IP13 constructed their MLCR uniquely by choosing a roupa ( 1998 ) IMF and the Marigo et al. ( 2008 ) isochrone model (the\name used in CB07). Once again, the choice of Marigo et al. ( 2008 ) sochrones stems from the concern o v er the TP-AGB influence. Their quation is constructed assuming a dust-free scenario. While the ffect of dust is significant in some colour, they concluded that ( g\ni ) remains a good tracer for the galaxies\u2019 stellar masses. The onsequence of using such a combination is the slower decline of tellar mass as a function of age (see their fig. 1) in comparison to he more popular BC03 SPS.\nPPENDI X C : G A L A X Y DATA\nere, we present the basic information for the galaxy sample dentified in Section 2.4 . Tables C1 \u2013C3 also provide the new morhological classifications (Column 9) based on our multicomponent ecomposition, as described in Section 3.3 . In Tables C1 \u2013C3 , Column (8) lists the past morphology assignment\nhile Column (9) provides our new classifications. The labels or the new classes are inspired by the \u2018morphology grid\u2019 from raham ( 2019 ) for high surface brightness galaxies. It represents the rogression from the traditional Hubble-Jeans sequence (Jeans 1919 ; undmark 1925 ; Hubble 1926a , b , 1927 , 1936 ), with an emphasis n the commonly o v erlooked features in early-type galaxies, such s bars and the continua of disc sizes (nuclear, intermediate, and arge-scale). The grid includes the ellicular (ES) class of galaxies Liller 1966 ), denoting the spheroids with an embedded intermediatecale disc, and it remo v es the redundant E4\u2013E7 classes because they re essentially all lenticular galaxies (Liller 1966 ; Gorbachev 1970 ; ichard 1984 ; Capaccioli, Caon & Rampazzo 1990b ; van den Bergh 990 ). For simplicity\u2019s sake, we omit the subdivision of spiral arm hapes (a, b, c, d, and m) which are not as rele v ant to our investigation. e label the galaxies as ellipticals without a disc (E0\u2013E3), elliculars EAS or EBS), lenticulars (SA0, SAB0, or SB0), and spirals (SA, AB, or SB), in which A and B are the distinctions between barless nd barred galaxies, and AB is designated for weak bars, defined here s those with lower central surface brightness ( \u03bc0 ) than the disc.\nIn accordance with the common practice in the literature, we erformed a single S \u0301ersic function fit to determine the ef fecti ve radius R e ) for each galaxy. In Fig. C1 , we show the distribution of R e / R max or our galaxies, separated by their morphology. We choose the cutoff adius, R max , to fitting the light profile at the radius where the S / N atio is low and no longer useful for decomposition.
