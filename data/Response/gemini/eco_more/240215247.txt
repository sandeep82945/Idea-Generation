1. **Investigate the impact of different bargaining strategies on the efficiency and fairness of the VFL market.** The proposed bargaining model is just one possible approach to feature trading in VFL. Other bargaining strategies could lead to different outcomes in terms of efficiency and fairness. For example, one could explore the use of more sophisticated bargaining algorithms, such as those based on game theory or machine learning.
2. **Develop mechanisms to prevent or mitigate manipulation of the VFL market.** As with any market, there is the potential for manipulation in the VFL market. For example, participants could collude to drive up prices or could misrepresent the value of their features. It is important to develop mechanisms to prevent or mitigate such manipulation.
3. **Extend the VFL market to other types of data and models.** The proposed bargaining model is designed for the VFL market, where the data and models are vertically partitioned. However, it could be extended to other types of data and models, such as horizontally partitioned data or federated transfer learning models.
4. **Develop a theoretical framework for the VFL market.** The proposed bargaining model is based on a number of assumptions about the behavior of the participants in the market. It would be valuable to develop a theoretical framework for the VFL market that could be used to analyze the properties of the market and to design more efficient and fair bargaining mechanisms.
5. **Conduct empirical studies of the VFL market.** The proposed bargaining model is based on a number of assumptions about the behavior of the participants in the market. It would be valuable to conduct empirical studies of the VFL market to validate these assumptions and to assess the performance of the proposed bargaining model.
