This paper maps the inside and outside virtual water trade of the Yellow River 4 Basin, applying the environmentally extended input-output model to evaluate the external dependence 5 of water in the Yellow River Basin. The results show that the Yellow River Basin mobilizes 27.2 billion 6 of virtual water flowing into other regions despite water scarcity, equivalent to half the runoff of the 7 Yellow River. The leading destination for outflow is the Eastern coast, and the largest virtual water 8 outflow sector is Agriculture and Manufacturing. The inequity of the inside virtual water trade of the 9 Yellow River Basin is severe, with large amounts of virtual water flowing from poor to rich regions. It 10 exacerbates water scarcity in poor regions. 11 Key words: Water scarcity; Sustainable development; Yellow River Basin; Virtual water trade; Water 12 management; 13"

            "text": "Water is a vital resource that profoundly affects human survival, industrial development, and social 15\nprogress(Deng et al., 2023). Since industrialization, the consumption of water resources has increased 16\nsignificantly(Hou et al. 2023). Global water demand, driven by population growth, economic 17\ndevelopment, and urbanization, increased nearly eight times between 1900 and 2010(Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2020). 18\nThe scarcity of water resources also limits economic development(Wu et al. 2022; Ekmekcio\u011flu et al. 19\n2022), especially in water-scarce regions, such as China(Zhao et al. 2020). Over-exploitation of some 20\nriver basins has caused groundwater depletion, seriously affecting water security. Among them, the 21\nYellow River Basin (YRB) is particularly serious. With the development of the economy, the demand for 22\nfood and energy in China will further increase. Water is a prerequisite for food production and energy 23\nextraction(Zhang et al. 2020a; Pang et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2023). As an essential grain and energy base 1\nin China, the YRB faces a severe water shortage problem(Cao et al. 2023). 2\nThe Yellow River (YR), the second-largest river in China, contains seven urban agglomerations 3\nalong its route. The Yellow River basin (YRB) is a priority area for constructing ecological civilization 4\nin China. In 2020, the Chinese government proposed the Ecological conservation and high-quality 5\ndevelopment of the Yellow River Basin. The runoff of the YR is less than 7% of that of the Yangtze River 6\n(the longest river in China)(Liu et al. 2021). In 2021, the YRB accounted for 29.8% of the country's 7\npopulation, but its per capita water resources are only 30% of the national average. Water scarcity has 8\nseriously affected the sustainable development of the YRB. Despite this, the YRB remains a vital food 9\nbase for China(Wang et al. 2023). With 13% of its grain production area, the YRB supplies more than 10\n35% of the country's grain. The uneven distribution of high-water-consuming industries and 11\nunreasonable water allocation exacerbate limited water wastage in the socioeconomic system and 12\nthreaten regional water security(Jia et al. 2021; Cai and Guo 2023). 13\nRational allocation of water resources is the key to alleviating water shortage and achieving 14\necological protection and high-quality development(Lei et al. 2022; Ma et al. 2023). Several efforts have 15\nbeen made to alleviate water shortages. The first is the direct adjustment of water resources for 16\nredistribution and storage. This mainly includes direct water transfer, the construction of canals, dams, 17\nreservoirs, and other projects(Liu et al. 2021), and unconventional water consumption (Yazdandoost et 18\nal. 2021). The property that waters is challenging to transport makes physical water transfer 19\nextraordinarily costly and difficult to build(Purvis & Dinar, 2020). Second, water-saving technology is 20\npopularized from the perspective of demand. The main focus is agriculture(Surendran et al. 2021), and 21\nhigh water-consuming industries(Wireko-Gyebi et al. 2022). However, spreading water-saving 22\ntechnologies can only slightly alleviate water shortages but cannot permanently solve water scarcity in 1\nwater-scarce regions. 2\nIn response to the increasing pressure on scarce water resources, researchers have developed the 3\nconcept of virtual water, which refers to the amount of water embedded in a good or service, including 4\nthe water consumed in its production and delivery(Teymouri and Dehghanzadeh 2021). Virtual water 5\ntrade (VWT) has less negative environmental impact and lower economic input than traditional 6\ntransregional water transfers(Liu et al. 2022). VWT is essential to alleviate water scarcity(Zhao et al. 7\n2015; Du et al. 2022; Hirwa et al. 2022). 8\nIn recent years, the research on virtual water has been increasing, providing new perspectives on 9\nregional water resources management. There are two main approaches to studying virtual water, one is 10\nthe top-down type, and the other is the bottom-up type. The bottom-up approach uses a rigorous 11\nmathematical model to account for virtual water for specific products using a large amount of data(An et 12\nal. 2021; Lachaut et al. 2022). However, the method is highly demanding for data and makes it difficult 13\nto portray the VWT relationship between different sectors between regions(Yin et al. 2021). Therefore, 14\nat this stage, the top-down approach is mainly used to account for VWT. Studies have systematically 15\nanalyzed VWT patterns based on multi-regional input-output models (Graham et al. 2020; Islam et al. 16\n2021). In international trade, multi-regional input-output tables were constructed using global trade data, 17\nand a global VWT network was developed by combining sectoral water consumption data(Falsetti et al., 18\n2022; Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2020). The study found that developing countries undertake many water-19\nintensive products, sacrificing water resources in exchange for economic rewards(Maroufpoor et al. 20\n2021). On a national scale, studies have quantified VWT in each of China's provinces(Wang et al. 2022). 21\nEach year, many virtual flows from northern China are directed to the south, which is the opposite of the 22\ndistribution of water resources in China(Zhang & Anadon, 2014)). Water scarcity affects the volume of 1\nVWT, and inter-provincial trade has exacerbated water scarcity in water-scarce regions of China. The 2\nintegration of regional water management and VWT is essential for the sustainable utilization of regional 3\nwater resources(Dalin et al., 2015; Jing et al., 2022). 4\nHowever, most studies still focus on global VWT and international VWT. Few studies have been 5\nconducted on the inside and outside VWT of the water-scarce basins. Virtual water trade studies at the 6\nbasin scale for water-scarce basins can clarify the relationship between regional water resources and 7\nindustrial structure, which supports the sustainable development of urban clusters in the basin. In addition, 8\nadjusting the capacity of water-intensive industries according to the VWT nexus can alleviate regional 9\nwater scarcity problems. However, only a few studies have been conducted at the basin level. 10\nThis study aims to reveal the characteristics of the inside and outside VWT of the YRB. We make 11 policy recommendations to achieve sustainable water management in the YRB and contribute to national 12 strategies for the Ecological conservation and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin. First, 13 we obtain regional multisectoral water withdrawal from the local perspective by collecting, integrating, 14 and calibrating water consumption data. Second, we map and analyze the inside and outside VWT of the 15 YRB. Finally, we provide policies to achieve sustainable water management in YRB from the VWT 16 perspective. 17"

Comparison of water consumption under production-based accounting and consumption-21\nbased accounting 22\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the water consumption of the YRB based on consumption-based accounting 1\n(CBA) (107.3 billion m\u00b3) is higher than the water consumption based on production-based accounting 2\n(PBA) (105.3 billion m\u00b3). The overall intensity of water consumption in the YRB (3.6 m\u00b3/1000 yuan) is 3\nslightly higher than the national average (4.5 m\u00b3/1000 yuan), with significant differences between the 4\nupper and lower reaches. Based on the accounting of PBA or CBA, water consumption in downstream 5\nprovinces is higher than in upstream provinces. Compared to PBA, water consumption in downstream 6\nprovinces increases significantly under CBA while generally decreasing in midstream and upstream 7\nprovinces. Based on this change, we refer to the provinces with higher water consumption under CBA 8\nthan under PBA as consumption-oriented provinces and the rest as production-oriented provinces. 9\naccounting for 22.1% of the total water consumption in the YRB. The downstream regions account for 13\n34.0% of total water consumption in the YRB. The most negligible water consumption in the YRB is in 14\nQinghai (3.1 billion m\u00b3), accounting for only 3.0% of the total water consumption in the YRB. The 15\nhighest water consumption intensity consumption is in Shandong (2.0 m\u00b3/1000 yuan), only 55.2% of the 16\naverage in the YRB, followed by Shaanxi (2.5 m\u00b3/1000 yuan). The remaining upstream provinces have 1\nwater intensities higher than the YRB average. Gansu has the lowest water consumption intensity (11.0 2\nm\u00b3/1000 yuan), three times the intensity of the YRB, and six times the intensity of the Shandong province. 3\nAlthough Shandong consumes 1.6 times more water than Gansu, it creates 8.1 times more economic 4\noutput. 5\nAs shown in Figure 2, Agriculture is the sector that uses the most water in all provinces. The 6\nprovince with the highest water consumption in Agriculture is Sichuan (15.7 billion m\u00b3), which represents 7\n67.5% of the total water consumption in the province. The province with the highest share of Agriculture 8\nwater consumption is Gansu (9.6 billion m\u00b3), accounting for 87.2% of total water consumption. In 9\ncontrast, water consumption in the Manufacturing sector is relatively low. However, the share of water 10\nconsumption in the Manufacturing sector is much lower than the economic value created by the sector. 11\nSichuan has the most significant water consumption in manufacturing (4.0 billion m\u00b3), followed by 12\nHenan (3.5 billion m\u00b3), accounting for 17.2% and 19.5% of total water consumption, respectively. 13\nAs a solid energy base in China, the mining industry in the YRB consumes large amounts of water. 14\nSichuan has the highest water consumption (760 million m\u00b3) and the highest proportion in Shanxi (290 15\nmillion m\u00b3), accounting for 4.8% of the province's total water consumption. In transportation, the highest 16\nwater consumption is in Sichuan (220 million m\u00b3), followed by Shandong (110 million m\u00b3), which is 17\nsignificantly higher than other provinces. Waterway transportation has a large capacity and low cost 18\ncompared to land and air transportation, but water consumption is significantly higher than other modes. 19\nThe interior is inland except for Shandong, and the YR is poorly navigated, lacking large-scale shipping. 20\nOnly Sichuan can utilize water transportation through the Yangtze River channel. Only two provinces, 21\nSichuan and Shandong, have the conditions for water transportation. 22\nThe inside VWT of the YRB shows a west-to-east flow. As shown in Figure 3, Shandong and Henan 5\nhave the highest virtual water inflow. Inner Mongolia contributes 920 million m\u00b3, and Gansu contributes 6\n1.16 billion m\u00b3, accounting for 53.5% and 68.2% of the total virtual water inflow from the two provinces, 7\nrespectively. As a consumer province, Shaanxi also contributed 69.6% of the virtual water flow to 8\nShandong and Henan. In the YRB, 49.7% of the virtual water flows into Shandong and Henan, but only 9\n27.2% of the virtual water flows out of the two provinces. 10\nNotes. The width of the flow line in the graph is used as the value of the VWT. The unit of the inner 3\ncircle numbers is million m\u00b3. Different colors indicate different regions. The entire flow line of the region 4\nis the same color as the full color of the region. Other colors are used to imply different inflow directions. 5\nThe percentage in the outer layer is the proportion of VWT in different regions. The outermost layer is 6\nthe city code of each province. For the convenience of description, we use the abbreviations of each 7\nprovince here. 8\nNotes. The color value indicates the VWT volume; the higher the value, the higher the VWT volume. 3\nThe gray color indicates a negative final demand for the sector. The negative value of virtual water 4\ninflows in some sectors indicates a negative final demand for that sector and a reverse outflow of virtual 5\nwater to the inflowing sector. 6\nFrom Fig. 4, we can see that Agriculture is the largest sector of virtual water outflow. Among them, 7 the virtual water outflow from agriculture in Gansu (1.5 billion m\u00b3) and Inner Mongolia (1.6 billion m\u00b3) 8 accounts for a higher proportion of the virtual water outflow in the province, 91.4% and 86.6%, 9 respectively. The main flows from Agriculture are in the direction of manufacturing and construction in 10 Shandong and Henan. Inner Mongolia and Gansu provinces have 28.8% and 32.2% of virtual water in 11 the Agriculture sector flowing into the Manufacturing sector in Henan and Shandong provinces, 12 respectively. Agriculture is increasingly being used in the Construction sector. China has taken strict 13 regulatory measures against burning straw or agricultural products. Large quantities of straw are made 14\ninto low-cost and highly fire-resistant construction formwork. Construction mixes made from straw are 1 widely used in the construction industry. 2 Manufacturing has the second-highest percentage of virtual water flow in each province. The Henan 3 Manufacturing industry has the highest virtual water flow at 280 million m\u00b3, representing 19.4%. The 4 main flows from Manufacturing are in the direction of each province's Manufacturing. For example, in 5 Henan and Sichuan, the two provinces plan to have equipment manufacturing as the pillar industry in the 6 province. Water resources are hidden in the appropriate equipment to transfer products to other provinces 7 to participate in Manufacturing. In real estate construction, water has also completed the transfer from 8 the production region to the consumption region. The homogeneity of the industrial structure makes the 9 VWT to the manufacturing sector within the YRB roughly the same. The heterogeneity between 10 industries makes the VWT to the provinces of manufacturing industries differ from province to province. 11 The heterogeneity of energy endowments has led to significant differences in the development of 12 the power sector across provinces. It makes the share of the virtual water flow of Mining and Public 13 services vary widely. The main flow of the Mining flows to the Manufacturing and Construction in the 14 provinces. However, virtual water flows to relatively rare regions but to economically developed regions. 15 The same applies to virtual water flow in Public services. 16 3.3. The Analysis of the outside Virtual Water Trade of the YRB 17 The YRB shows a virtual net water inflow (15.0 billion m\u00b3). However, YRB has a disproportionately 18 high WSI compared to other regions and still contributes a significant amount of virtual water to other 19 regions. Virtual water in the YRB flows mainly to China's economically developed and densely populated 20 regions. As shown in Fig. 7, the YRB outflow of the virtual water is 27.2 billion m\u00b3. However, the multi-21 year average natural annual runoff of the YR is only 58 billion m\u00b3, which means that the virtual water 22 outflow from the YRB is equivalent to the net flow of half of the YR each year. The total inflow is 42.2 23 billion m\u00b3, mainly from remote regions with few populations. 24\ncircle numbers is million m\u00b3. Different colors indicate different regions. The entire flow line of the region 4\nis the same color as the full color of the region. Other colors are used to imply different inflow directions. 5\nThe percentage in the outer layer is the proportion of VWT in different regions. The outermost layer is 6\nthe city code of each province. For the convenience of description, we use the abbreviations of each 7\nprovince here. 8\nindicate the outflow of virtual water from the YRB to other basins. The thickness suggests the magnitude 4\nof the virtual water, and the figure is in billions of m\u00b3. 5\nAs shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the main destinations of virtual water in the YRB are the Eastern 6 coast (4.8 billion m\u00b3), the Southern coast (4.7 billion m\u00b3), and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (4.2 billion m\u00b3). 7 Virtual water flowing to the three regions accounts for 50.1% of the total virtual water flow out of the 8 YRB, and the GDP of the three regions accounts for 45.7% of China's GDP. However, not all three 9 regions are water-poor regions, especially the Southern coast, which is traditionally water-rich. Water-10 rich regions still need to transfer a large amount of virtual water from the water-poor YRB each year, 11 increasing the pressure on water resources in the YRB and limiting the development of the YRB. 12 The virtual water inflow to the YRB is 44.1 billion m\u00b3. The most significant contributor is the middle 13 reaches of the Yangtze River, which contributes 10.0 billion m\u00b3 and represents 22.7% of the total inflow. 14\nIt is followed by the Western region, where the provinces of Xinjiang and Tibet transferred 8.7 billion 1 m\u00b3 of virtual water to the YRB. As the least developed region in the country, the Western region supports 2 the economic development of YRB and other regions in the central and eastern cities by providing low-3 value-added products. Xinjiang, in particular, provides a large amount of water despite its high-water 4 stress index. In Xinjiang, more than 50% of agriculture production is exported to other provinces as 5 intermediate inputs or final products. 6\nThe gray color indicates a negative final demand for the sector. The negative value of virtual water 10\ninflows in some sectors indicates a negative final demand for that sector and a reverse outflow of virtual 11\nwater to the inflowing sector. 12\nAs shown in Fig. 7, agricultural VWT is mainly transferred from less developed regions to 13 developed regions. The western region accounts for 98% of the virtual agricultural water outflow (28.6 14 billion m\u00b3). It is followed by the northeast region (24.5 billion m\u00b3), which represents 88.1%. The main 15\noutflows of virtual agricultural water in both regions were agriculture on the eastern and southern coasts 1 and manufacturing in the YRB. In contrast, the virtual agricultural water in the YRB went mainly to 2 construction in the provinces. The second largest virtual water outflow sector is manufacturing. The 3 highest virtual water outflow from manufacturing is in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (8.9 4 billion m3), representing 26.5%, followed by the eastern coast (6.4 billion m\u00b3), accounting for 29.6%. 5 The central outflow of virtual water from manufacturing industries in each region is each province's 6 manufacturing and construction industries, especially in the YRB. Virtual water outflow from the service 7 industry in developed regions is higher than in less developed regions. Among virtual water flows from 8 the service sector, the southern coast (520 million m\u00b3) and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (420 million m\u00b3) 9 account for the highest proportion of virtual water use in the region, at 5.5% and 5.1%, respectively. The 10 VWT in the service sector is a mutual transfer of services between multiple regions, with specific input 11 areas favoring densely populated regions. 12"

            "text": "With economic development, the production factors gradually shift from primary to secondary and 14\ntertiary industries. The YRB contributes 36.0% of the nation's food each year. Water scarcity in the YRB 15\nwill hurt China's food security. In addition, the YRB is rich in mineral resources and has significant 16\nstrategic resources, such as rare earth. However, the exploitation of resources needs a vast water demand. 17\nWater scarcity will plague the exploitation of resources in the YRB and threaten China's energy security. 18\nThe less developed regions of the YRB, especially the water-scarce regions, deliver a large amount of 19\nvirtual water to the developed regions each year. Developed regions import high water-consuming 20\nproducts from the YRB to meet demand at the expense of the ecological environment of the YRB. 21\nTherefore, the VWT structure and scale of YRB need to be adjusted and improved. According to the 22\nVWT situation of each province, construct the VWT compensation mechanism. 23\nAlong with improving water consumption efficiency in each province, the sectoral water quotas of 1\neach province are dynamically adjusted. Through water compensation, virtual water outflow provinces 2\ncan carry out technological innovation and industrial upgrading. This would effectively improve the 3\nefficiency of local water consumption. Virtual water inflow provinces exchange economic losses for 4\necological values. This will help residents optimize their water consumption patterns and increase water 5\nconservation awareness, improving water efficiency. 6\nContrary to the direction of VWT, resource-intensive and highly polluting industries are moving 7\nfrom developed to less developed regions. In the YRB, the industrial shift is from the downstream to the 8\nupstream regions. The YRB is ecologically fragile and has many high water-consuming industries. 9\nChina's resource-intensive and highly polluting industries are now moving from the east to the central 10\nand western parts of the country. In the short term, these industries will increase local GDP. However, in 11\nthe long run, the development model based on the high water-consuming industries will create a vicious 12\ncircle of \"population outflow and environmental degradation.\" People move from less developed to 13\ndeveloped regions in pursuit of a better living environment and educational resources for future 14\ngenerations. The outflow of population, exceptionally high-quality talent, will lead to a talent gap in the 15\nYRB. It prevents water-intensive industries from upgrading, Deteriorating the living environment, and 16\ncausing more population loss. The upstream governments in the YRB should actively cultivate successive 17\nalternative industries and selectively accept industrial transfers from eastern regions. 18\nResource endowments, and political factors, drive the distribution of high water-consuming 19\nindustries. The widening of water-consuming industries is unrealistic. The policymakers should shift 20\ntheir primary objective to harmonizing water-consuming industries with the local water environment. It 21\nis critical for water-scarce regions, especially production-oriented regions (e.g., Ningxia, Inner 22\nMongolia). In addition, water-scarce regions should adjust the structure of export products and reduce 1\nthe share of high water-consuming industries. (Feng et al., 2014; Zeitoun et al., 2010) . 2\n5.Conclusions 3\nThe main objective of this study was to evaluate the VWT of the YRB to achieve sustainable water 4\nmanagement and the Ecological conservation and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin. 5\nBased on the environmentally extended input-output model, we mapped the inside and outside VWT in 6\nthe YRB. In this study, we estimated the multi-sectoral water at the provincial level based on the China 7\nHigh-Resolution Emission Gridded Database and previous Water Resources Bulletins, which ensures 8\nconsistent sources of water withdrawal data. The following principal conclusions were drawn. 9\nThe water scarcity in the YRB is still severe. The YRB is a virtual water inflow region with a total 10\nnet inflow of 16.9 billion m\u00b3. This means that YRB still has water scarcity, although YR is the second 11\nlongest river in China. However, despite its high WSI, YRB has exported 27.2 billion m\u00b3 of virtual water 12\nto other regions, equivalent to the annual runoff of half the YR. Agriculture makes the most significant 13\ncontribution, accounting for 75.1% of the total virtual water outflow. The following is Manufacturing, 14\naccounting for 13.2%. The massive outflow of virtual water from both sectors exacerbates the water 15\nscarcity in the YRB. 16\nVWT exacerbates water inequity within the YRB. Virtual water shows a flow from poorer to more 17\nprosperous regions. Virtual water outflows are generally higher than inflows in poor provinces. Henan 18\nand Shandong consumed 49.7% of the total VWT in the YRB but only contributed 27.2%. The current 19\nVWT model is conducive to alleviating the water scarcity in the rich regions of the YRB, but it further 20\naggravates the water scarcity in the poor regions. 21 22"
