The distinctive features of the strain HSB-15 were also identified by phenotypic characterization. The isolated strain HSB-15 was employed for the reduction of selected naphthyl ketones to their corresponding alcohols and a biosurfactant was isolated from its culture broth.",

In an effort to find out new biocatalyst for oxidation-reduction reaction, leading to the synthesis of chiral intermediates, novel yeast were isolated from unique niche and employed for the synthesis of value added compounds.\nMethods: To determine the genetic relatedness of the isolated strain, HSB-15T, sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 domains of the 26S rRNA gene sequence was carried out. The distinctive features of the strain HSB-15T were also identified by phenotypic characterization. The isolated strain HSB-15T was employed for the reduction of selected naphthyl ketones to their corresponding alcohols and a biosurfactant was isolated from its culture broth.\nResults: The analysis of the ITS and D1/D2 domains of the 26S rRNA gene revealed that strain HSB-15T is closely related to the type strain of Starmerella vitae (CBS 15147T) with 96.3% and 97.7% sequence similarity, respectively. However, concatenated sequences of the ITS gene and D1/D2 domain showed 94.6% sequence similarity. Phenotypic characterization indicated significant differences between strain HSB-15T and its closely related species and consequently, it was identified as a novel species, leading to the proposal of the name Starmerella cerana sp. nov. The strain was able to reduce selected naphthyl ketones to their corresponding alcohols with remarkable efficiency, within a 12-hours. The strain HSB-15T also produced a surfactant in its culture broth, identified as sophorolipid upon analysis.\nDiscussion: The study explored the potential of the novel strain, HSB-15T, as a whole-cell biocatalyst for the reduction of naphthyl ketones to their corresponding alcohols and also reports its capability to produce sophorolipid,"

            "text": "Process innovation and recent developments in the pharmaceutical industry have increased the production capacity of drugs and pharmaceuticals, making them accessible to the general public. However, these industries are often criticized for creating environmental pollution (Naidu et al., 2021). Thus, environmental concerns, the need for better process yield and ease, and the generation of a lower quantity of waste have pushed the scientific community toward the development of greener, environmentally benign processes for the pharmaceutical industry (Woodley, 2008). Biocatalytic synthesis of pharma-chemicals and intermediates is one of the ways toward achieving environmentally benign technologies. Yeasts are known for their capability to carry out biocatalytic conversions relevant to the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. However, finding novel yeast carrying out such conversions opens up a new window for creating new biocatalysts with better substrate scope.\nFlowers are amajor source of yeast biodiversity. Flower-associated yeast communities utilize a wide variety of sugar-enriched substrates (found in the nectar) that serve as a highly enriched medium for the survival of yeast communities (Brysch-Herzberg, 2004; Morais, Pagnocca, and Rosa, 2006; Belisle et al., 2014; Sipiczki, 2015a). The yeast genera commonly found in nectar and floral surfaces include Metschnikowia, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, Clavispora, Kodamaea, Debaryomyces, Sporobolomyces, Hanseniaspora, Candida, Papiliotrema, Wickerhamiella, and Starmerella (Klaps, Lievens, and \u00c1lvarez-P\u00e9rez, 2020). On the other hand, the yeast communities found in bees and their habitats are largely members of a clade centered around the genus Starmerella (Rosa et al., 2003; Teixeira et al., 2003). Species of the genus Starmerella isolated from bees and other sources are mentioned in Table 1. Members of the genera Rhodotorula, Debaryomyces, and Candida are known to have oxidoreductive biocatalytic potential; however, members of the genera Metschnikowia, Wickerhamiella, and Starmerella are known to have the capacity of producing biosurfactants. In fact, yeasts from the genus Starmerella have been explored as an industrially relevant microorganism, typically for the production of a versatile biosurfactant, sophorolipid (SL), which is known to have a wide range of applications in the healthcare and cosmetic industries (Kurtzman et al., 2010; Morya et al., 2013). Therefore, our objective was to find honey bee-associated yeasts that can carry out biocatalytic functions and produce biosurfactants.\nThis study presents a novel yeast species, the strain HSB-15T, isolated from the insect Apis cerena. The strain was found in bees frequenting flowers at the Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. Through morphological analysis, sugar fermentation, carbon and nitrogen source assimilation, growth profiling, and sequencing of the ITS region and D1/D2 domain\nof the rRNA gene, the isolate was identified as belonging to the genus Starmerella. It exhibited a close relationship with the Starmerella vitae strain, CBS 15147T. This discovery led to the proposal of a new taxon, Starmerella cerana sp. nov., for the HSB-15T strain.\nWe also investigated the biocatalytic potential of the newly isolated yeast strain HSB-15T to convert naphthyl ketones into chiral sec-naphthylethanols, key intermediates for the synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. HSB-15T was also explored for the production of biosurfactants. Starmerella sp. is well known as a producer of sophorolipid biosurfactants (Deshpande and Daniels, 1995). The produced biosurfactant was characterized and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. Our findings introduced the strain HSB-15 as a versatile microorganism serving both as a biocatalyst for naphthyl ketone reduction and a producer of the biosurfactant, sophorolipid."

The strain HSB-15T showed significant growth within the pH range of 4.0\u20136.0. However, at lower pH (below 4.0) and higher pH (above 6.0), no significant growth was detected.

However, the growth rate was retarded in PDB, LB, NB, and TSB media. All these observations indicated that the growth characteristics of the strain HSB-15T showed a considerable similarity with the genus Starmerella.\nA comparative study for the biochemical taxonomic characterization of the strain HSB-15T was carried out using the Biolog system to determine the relationship with its closely related type strain S. vitae strain CBS 15147. According to phylogenetic relatedness, the strain was also compared with other related species, which showed remarkable differences with S. vitae strain CBS 15147 (type species differs in six tests), Starmerella apicola CBS 2868 (differs in 12 tests), Starmerella bombicola CBS 6009 (eight tests), and Starmerella neotropicalis CBS 12811 (differs in 14 tests), respectively (see Table 2). Tests on the fermentation and assimilation of sugars confirmed that the strain HSB-15T was capable of fermenting D-glucose but was unable to ferment maltose. Furthermore, the sugar substrates trehalose and raffinose were also fermented by the novel strain; however, the same substrates were not utilized by other related-type strains. Furthermore, the sugar substrate L-sorbose was not utilized by the strain HSB-15T, whereas S. vitae strain CBS 15147, S. apicola CBS 2868, S. bombicola CBS 6009, and S. neotropicalis CBS 12811 were capable of utilizing the substrate. The strain HSB-15T was shown to be weakly positive for assimilation of D-xylose and ribitol, which was not assimilated by its type strains Starmerella cf. bombi CBS 15147, S. apicola CBS 2868, S. bombicola CBS 6009, and S. neotropicalis CBS 12811. Assimilation of trehalose was positive for the strain HSB-15T, whereas other related-type strains were unable to assimilate the same carbon sources. The study of various temperatures showed that the strain HSB-15T was capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, although the strain HSB-15T and other related species were unable to grow at higher temperatures (37\u00b0C). However, the strain S. apicola CBS 2868 can grow up to 37\u00b0C. The growth of HSB-15T in 1% yeast extract and 2% agar medium containing 10% and 16% NaCl was found to be negative, but the S. vitae strain CBS 15147 was shown to be positive in the medium with 10% NaCl.

These tests indicated remarkable differences in the isolated strain HSB-15T when compared to other described related strains.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org09\n3.3 Phylogeny of the new Starmerella species\nTo determine the phylogenetic position of S. cerena (HSB-15 T strain), a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the pair-wise alignment of the ITS region (465 bp), which showed 3.7% sequence divergence, whereas the D1/D2 region (595 bp) showed 2.5% sequence divergence from S. vitae strain CBS 15147 T. According to Kurtzman and Robnett (1998), established rules for classifying ascomycetous yeast species using nucleotide divergences state that strains that show more than six nucleotide sequence changes (equal to 1% sequence divergent) in the D1/D2 domain may be considered as the limit for the discrimination of two species. A taxonomic differentiation threshold was subsequently established by Vu et al. (2016), who stated that a strain should be classified as a distinct species in comparison to its close neighbors if it exhibits a similarity of less than 98.31% (for Ascomycota) or 98.61% (for Basidiomycota) within the ITS region. The suggested criterion for distinguishing species is modified to less than 99.41% similarity (for Ascomycota) or 99.51% similarity (for Basidiomycota) in the case of D1/D2 domain analysis. Thus, based on the sequence divergence of the ITS region and D1/D2 domain, the HSB-15T strain is considered a new species. Moreover, when the analysis was carried out with the ITS and D1/D2 domain of the novel strain HSB-15 T and closely related Starmerella, clade species were used to construct a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. In the phylogenetic analysis of strain HSB-15T, it was found to be closely related to species S. vitae strain CBS 15147 with strong 96 and 97 bootstrap values for the ITS and D1/D2 domain, respectively (see Figure 1B). The comparative analysis of multiple sequence alignments has revealed distinct genetic variations in the strain HSB-15 T when compared to closely related types: from the S. vitae strain by more than 4% nucleotide divergence (13 substitutions and four gaps), from S. apicola by 7% (28 substitutions and six gaps), and from S. neotropicalis by 8% (25 substitutions and 12 gaps), all within the ITS region, and from the S. vitae strain by 2% nucleotide divergence (nine substitutions and three gaps), from S. apicola by 7% (25 substitutions and eight gaps), and from S. neotropicalis by 6% (27 substitutions and four gaps) based on the D1/D2 domain. Zygoascus hellenicus CBS 5839 T was used as an out group in this study. Thus, it was proved that the strain belongs to a distinct taxon of the clade Starmerella and may be designated as a different species named Starmeralla cerana.\n3.4 Reduction of 6\u2032-methoxy-2\u2032acetonaphthone to S-1-(6-methoxy-2naphthyl) ethanol in a different time course\nConversion of 1-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) ethanol from its prochiral ketone by cells of the HSB-15T strain as whole-cell biocatalysis was carried out, and the progress of the reaction at different time intervals was monitored by TLC and HPLC equipped with the RP-C 18 Column. The time course of biocatalysis is depicted in Figure 3 by the strain HSB-15T showing selective conversion of 1-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) ethanol from the\nprochiral substrate in 3 h\u201312 h (Table 3) with the highest percentage of conversion (63.3%), within 12 h (Table 4). Since the synthesis of enantiopure drugs has been compelled by different regulatory agencies (United States Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, etc.), this study provides an exploration of biocatalysts for the synthesis of the industrially relevant compound S-1-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) ethanol (6-MAN-OH), which is a key intermediate of the antiinflammatory drug naproxen, which is a racemic drug. Furthermore, in order to expand the window of the substrates, the novel strain HSB-15T was tested for different naphthyl ketones. Our biocatalytic study reveals the substrate acceptance of the strain HSB-15T. The strain was capable of reducing 6\u2032-methoxy-2\u2032-acetonaphthone, 1- acetonaphthone, and 2\u2032-hydroxy-1\u2032-acetonaphthone with the highest yields (63.3%, 72.6%, and 23.5%, respectively) in 12 h.\nNumerous documented studies highlight the effective utilization of yeast cells as whole-cell biocatalysts for reducing naphthyl ketones to yield naphthyl alcohols. These reports underscore the versatility and efficiency of yeast cells in this bioconversion process. For instance, in a notable study led by Roy et al. (2003), Geotrichum candidum and Candida parapsilosis were found to efficiently catalyze the reduction of 1-acetonephthone to S (\u2212)-1-(1\u2018- naphthyl) ethanol. The conversion rates reached 84% and 43%, respectively, within 24 h (Roy et al., 2003). This biocatalyzed product, S (\u2212)-1-(1\u2018-naphthyl) ethanol, plays a crucial role as an intermediate in mevinic acid analog synthesis, serving as a promising inhibitor of 3-hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), commonly known as statins, used to treat hyperlipidemia. Subsequently, Bhattacharyya and Banerjee (2007) conducted a study exploring the production of the carbonyl reductase enzyme responsible for the bioconversion in G. candidum. Following the optimization of various media components and physicochemical parameters, the conversion of 1-acetonephthone to its corresponding product increased to approximately 93% (Bhattacharyya and Banerjee, 2007). In a separate study, Rhodotorula glutinis yeast cells acted as whole-cell biocatalysts for producing S (\u2212)-1-(1\u2018-naphthyl) ethanol, achieving a conversion rate of 100% after optimization (Kurbanog et al., 2008). Zilbeyaz et al. (2016) reported a preparative-scale conversion of 1- acetonaphthone to (S)-(\u2212)-1-(1\u2019-naphthyl) ethanol by the fungus Alternaria alternata, yielding up to 82% in 48 h (Zilbeyaz, Kurbanoglu, and Kilic, 2016). In a prior study, multiple isolated yeast strains were examined for reducing 6\u2032-methoxy-2\u2032acetonaphthone to (S)-1-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) ethanol. The yeast strain CHF-15P, identified as Rhodotorula kratochvilovae, exhibited the highest conversion potential. It was proficient in reducing five different naphthyl ketone substrates to their respective naphthyl alcohols, with exceptional conversions achieved in substrates such as 6\u2032-methoxy-2\u2032-acetonaphthone and 4\u2032-fluoro-1\u2032-acetonaphthone, surpassing 95% and 96%, respectively (Verma et al., 2021). Subsequently, in 2023, Preeti et al. reported the synthesis of (S)-(\u2212)-1-(1\u2032-naphthyl) ethanol employing Pichia kudriavzevii cells, yielding a conversion of 75% (Preeti et al., 2022).\nAlthough the majority of studies have reported single substrates for bioconversion (except the work of Verma et al. (2021)), the novel strain S. cerena (HSB-15T strain) exhibits promising capabilities by effectively reducing three distinct substrates, yielding pivotal drug intermediates. Notably, the\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org11\nconversion time is also shorter compared to that reported in many of these studies (Verma et al., 2021). Nonetheless, while most of these studies demonstrated high substrate conversion using distinct yeast cells, it is essential to note that the meticulous optimization process encompassing a spectrum of physicochemical parameters, which unlocks their ultimate conversion potential, is not addressed in the scope of this particular study.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org12"

            "text": "In this study, we found that the HSB-15T strain possesses the capability to produce a biosurfactant. This biosurfactant was subsequently examined for potential biological activities. Notably, due to the close genetic resemblance of the strain HSB-15T to the Starmerella genus, it was initially hypothesized that a similar type of biosurfactant might be produced. Nevertheless, our findings\ndemonstrated that the biosurfactant produced by HSB-15T exhibited a remarkable ability to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. The biosurfactant was isolated by the ethyl acetate extraction method and partially purified by LH-20 gel column chromatography. Final purification was performed by RP-HPLC (Supplementary Figure S8). The biosurfactant produced was subjected to various characterization techniques, and the results indicated its resemblance to the biosurfactant produced by Starmerella sp. Through FT-IR analysis, a comparison with the existing literature revealed a similarity to sophorolipid (see Figure 4). This initial identification was subsequently corroborated by LC\u2013MS analysis (detailed data are presented later in the manuscript), as shown in Figure 5. The evaluation of the antibacterial activity of a purified sophorolipid biosurfactant against S. aureus was carried out using the agar-well diffusion method. As shown in Supplementary Figure S8, 100 \u00b5L of the HPLC-purified sample (500 \u03bcg/mL) was added to the LB agar plate containing S. aureus cells. After incubation of the plate at 37\u00b0C overnight, a clear zone of inhibition was observed.\nNotably, the diameter of this inhibitory zone measured approximately 20 mm.

(2022) reported that the MIC value of sophorolipid was determined to be 1.5625 mg/mL against S. aureus (Ma et al., 2022). Similarly, da Fontoura et al. (2020) reported a distinct MIC value of 500 mg/mL for sophorolipid in combating the human pathogen S. aureus (da Fontoura et al., 2020). Chen and Zhifei (2020) reported the antibacterial activity of sophorolipid against S. aureus. In the agar-well diffusion assay, a 9- mm-diameter clear zone of inhibition was observed with 50 \u00b5L of sophorolipid (2.5 mg/mL). Furthermore, they evaluated the MIC value, which was determined to be 32 \u03bcg/mL through a double broth dilution method (Chen and Zhifei, 2020). In a separate study, while evaluating a comparative study of sophorolipid-capped gold nanoparticles with free sophorolipid, Shikha et al. (2020) reported a zone of inhibition of 15 mm diameter by applying 100 \u00b5L of sophorolipid with a concentration of 400 \u03bcg/mL (Shikha, Chaudhuri, and Bhattacharyya, 2020).\nIt is worth mentioning that the variation in MIC values discerned across diverse research groups could potentially be attributed to the inherent structural complexity of sophorolipid. Factors such as differing chain lengths, the presence of saturated or unsaturated fatty acid chain, acetylation patterns, and the homogeneity of sophorolipid compounds collectively contribute to the observed variability in MIC values.\n3.6 Ecological aspect of the Starmerella clade\nThe strain isolated from the honey bee (A. cerena) surface, collected from the IMTECH garden, is a flower-associated strain. The majority of yeasts from the Starmerella clade are associated with insect vectors such as bees and the substrates that these insects often visit. Flowers, fruits, bees, honey, honey bread, etc., are common sites from which many of the species of the genus Starmerella were isolated (Gilliam, 1979; Masneuf-Pomarede et al., 2015; Alimadadi et al., 2016). The presence of yeasts of the Starmerella clade on the surface of bees or at their associated\nsites is the basis of a belief that they exist mutually in the beneficial relationship between bees and different species from the Starmerella clade (Rosa et al., 2003; Oliveira et al., 2014). Since flowers provide suitable microenvironments for the growth of various yeasts, the floral parts, especially flower nectar (with a high-sugar-concentration microenvironment), are one of the important habitats of the members of the genus Starmerella. They are generally osmotolerant yeasts due to their survival in high-sugar-concentration habitats (Sipiczki, 2015a; Amoikon et al., 2018). The first isolated species from the Starmerella clade, i.e., S. bombicola (well known for sophorolipid production), was discovered in the honey of bumblebees in Canada (Graeve et al., 2018). Thereafter, various species from the same clade were isolated from similar habitats (flowers, insects, or the substrates where these insects visited). For example, Candida riodocensis and Candida cellae from the Starmerella clade were isolated in solitary bees in Brazil (Pimentel et al., 2005). Torulopsis magnoliae was associated with pollen that was stored in comb cells of bee bread of Apis mellifera (Saksinchai et al., 2012). The yeast strain Starmerella bacillaris was found to be associated with grapefruit and wine environments (MasneufPomarede et al., 2015). Other species from the same clade were isolated from flower sources; for example, Starmerella orientalis was isolated in Iran (Alimadadi et al., 2016), Starmerella jinningensis was isolated in China (Li et al., 2013), and Starmerella syriaca was isolated in Syria (Sipiczki, 2015a). The frequent distribution of Starmerella clade species in specific ecological niches provides their physiological adaptation in high-sugar-concentration environments. Moreover, the association with bees is part of a mutual relationship that helps in developing plant\u2013animal interactions."

            "text": "In several literature reports, it is well described that yeasts from the genus Starmerella are known for the production of a glycolipid biosurfactant called sophorolipid (Jezierska, Claus, and Van Bogaert, 2018). Since, in the present study, the strain HSB-15T was identified as being closely related to the genus Starmerella, it was hypothesized that the novel yeast HSB-15T could be a sophorolipid-producing strain (C. P. Kurtzman et al., 2010). Therefore, when cells were grown for biocatalytic experiments, the broth after the separation of the cells was utilized for this purpose. To examine the presence of biosurfactant in the broth, an oil displacement assay was carried out. It is evident from Supplementary Figure S7A that oil in the Petri dish was spread after the addition of a 10 \u00b5L sample, indicating the presence of surfactant in the sample. Furthermore, the characterization of the biosurfactant was initially carried out using thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. A comparative study of the produced biosurfactant by HSB-15T with commercially available sophorolipid biosurfactant (1,4- sophorolactone 6\u2032,6\u2032-diacetate) using TLC showed a similar banding pattern as the reference standard. Moreover, the TLC result also revealed the presence of both acidic and lactonic forms of sophorolipid biosurfactant (Supplementary Figure S7B).\nFIGURE 5 LC\u2013MS spectra showing the m/z values of 685 and 727 for putative sophorolipid biosurfactant produced by HSB-15T cells.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org14\nFurthermore, the isolated biosurfactant sample was also subjected to reverse-phase HPLC along with the standard sophorolipid. The 21 chromatograms of the HPLC clearly indicated the presence of sophorolipid in the sample, as the retention time of the biosurfactant was found to be similar to the reference standard."

Thereafter, the elucidation of the functional groups attached to the biosurfactant was carried out by the FT-IR spectrum. The absorption spectra of the biosurfactant shown in Figure 4 revealed the identity of the compound. A broad absorption band present at 3,423.57 cm-1 corresponds to the O\u2013H stretch, indicating the presence of the sugar moiety in the biosurfactant. Another two peaks at 2925.08 cm-1 and 2854.43 cm1 correspond to the C\u2013Hband, representing the aliphatic hydrocarbon tail of the biosurfactant. A peak of C\u2013H bending is observed at an absorption band of 1,678.32 cm-1. Since the carboxylic acid group is present in the acidic sophorolipid, the presence of O\u2013H bending is indicated by the absorption at 1,401.05 cm-1. The strong peaks in the range of 1,000\u20131,400 cm-1 contribute to C\u2013O stretching, indicating a lactone, ester, or acid group in biosurfactant samples. A peak at 802.22 cm-1 shows CH bending and its distribution at 1 and 3 positions. The distribution of unsaturation in the long hydrocarbon tail can also be seen as C=C bending by an absorption band at 723.66 cm-1. The spectra obtained from FT-IR analysis clearly indicate the chemical constituents of the purified compound, confirming it as a glycolipid biosurfactant. A comparative study with the spectrum available in previous studies (Akbari et al., 2020; Ganji et al., 2020) reveals the purified biosurfactant from HSB15T to be a sophorolipid biosurfactant."

            "heading": "4 Conclusion",
            "text": "In the present study, the exploration of biodiversity for novel yeasts was carried out. A novel yeast species designated as HSB-15 from the surface of the honey bee was isolated and identified by\namplifying the ITS and D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) of the rRNA gene. The construction of the phylogenetic tree suggests that the new species belongs to the Starmerella clade and is closely related to the S. vitae strain CBS 15147. Therefore, the name of the novel yeast was suggested as Starmerella cerana. Another group working on yeast isolated from bees reported Starmerella to be the most common yeast species in honey bee-stored bee bread. Yeast obtained from bees\u2019 honey stomachs along with pollen pellets collected from bee legs had Metschnikowia species in abundance (Detry et al., 2020). Furthermore, various physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, and different media for optimum growth were examined and found to be 4\u20136 for pH and 20\u00b0C\u201330\u00b0C for temperature, and the best media for strain HSB-15T growth were YEPD, YM, and SDB. Furthermore, biochemical characterization of the strain HSB-15T was carried out and compared with its type strain and type species, i.e., the S. vitae strain CBS 15147, S. apicola CBS 2868, S. bombicola CBS 6009, and S. neotropicalis CBS 12811, respectively. Furthermore, to explore the application potential of the strain HSB-15T, the biocatalysis for the reduction of naphthyl ketone derivatives (the key intermediates of various pharmaceuticals and industry-relevant compounds) was examined. The yeast strain HSB-15T showed significant potential for reducing these prochiral ketones to the enantiopure S-specific alcohols. The strain demonstrated its ability to efficiently reduce 6\u2032-methoxy-2\u2032-acetonaphthone, 1- acetonaphthone, and 2\u2032-hydroxy-1\u2032-acetonaphthone, yielding remarkable results (63.3%, 72.6%, and 23.5%, respectively) within a 12-h timeframe. Javidnia et al. showed that R. glutinis, an aerobic yeast, could achieve substantial reductions in nearly all prochiral ketones, exhibiting both high conversion rates and exceptional optical purity, and the conversion efficiency was approximately 38\u201345% (Javidnia et al., 2016). However, S. bombicola is used for the production of sophorolipid, with an easily attainable yield of approximately 42.81 g/L (Alfian et al., 2022).\nThe strain HSB-15 could be used for the production of a biosurfactant known as sophorolipid. This biosurfactant was also evaluated for its antimicrobial and surface tension-lowering properties. The strain provided a moderate amount of sophorolipid (15 g/L) production as the media were not specially optimized for higher production. An increased amount of sophorolipid can be achieved by medium optimization and by using oil as one of the sources of lipid in the media (Elshafie et al., 2015).\nHence, the novel stain can be used for the biocatalysis of pharmaceutical drugs along with the production of sophorolipid as a biosurfactant."
