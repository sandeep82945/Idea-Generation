    "abstractText": "Cancer is second only to heart disease as a cause of death, despite improvements in its early diagnosis and precision medicine. Due to the limitations of commonly used anticancer methods such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, biological therapy, especially probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria, has received widespread attention. Lactobacillus has been proven to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells. In this work, the effects of the cell-free culture supernatant of serofluid dish (CCS1) and the cell-free culture supernatant of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum YT013 (CCS2) isolated from serofluid dish on AGS, HCT116, HepG2 and PANC-1 cells were investigated. Based on the CCK-8 assay, CCS1 and CCS2 were shown to suppress the growth of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values of CCS2 of AGS, HCT116, HepG2 and PANC-1 cells were 346.51 \u00b1 35.28, 1207.69 \u00b1 333.18, 650.94 \u00b1 123.78 and 808.96 \u00b1 126.27 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In addition, the results of fluorescence microscopy showed that CCS2 changed cell morphology and treated with CCS2 (200, 400 and 800 \u03bcg/ml) for 48 h, AGS cell apoptosis was quantitatively surveyed by flow cytometry, showing 25.0, 34.1, and 42.6% total apoptotic cells. Moreover, western blotting confirmed that BAX, BAD and Caspase-3/8/9 were significantly upregulated and that BCL-2 was significantly downregulated in AGS cells treated with CCS2. These results indicated that CCS2 might lead to apoptosis via the endogenous mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In summary, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum YT013 may be considered a good candidate for anticancer therapies.",

Due to the limitations of commonly used anticancer methods such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, biological therapy, especially probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria, has received widespread attention. Lactobacillus has been proven to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells. In this work, the effects of the cell-free culture supernatant of serofluid dish (CCS1) and the cell-free culture supernatant of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum YT013 (CCS2) isolated from serofluid dish on AGS, HCT116, HepG2 and PANC-1 cells were investigated. Based on the CCK-8 assay, CCS1 and CCS2 were shown to suppress the growth of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values of CCS2 of AGS, HCT116, HepG2 and PANC-1 cells were 346.51 \u00b1 35.28, 1207.69 \u00b1 333.18, 650.94 \u00b1 123.78 and 808.96 \u00b1 126.27 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In addition, the results of fluorescence microscopy showed that CCS2 changed cell morphology and treated with CCS2 (200, 400 and 800 \u03bcg/ml) for 48 h, AGS cell apoptosis was quantitatively surveyed by flow cytometry, showing 25.0, 34.1, and 42.6% total apoptotic cells. Moreover, western blotting confirmed that BAX, BAD and Caspase-3/8/9 were significantly upregulated and that BCL-2 was significantly downregulated in AGS cells treated with CCS2. These results indicated that CCS2 might lead to apoptosis via the endogenous mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In summary, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum YT013 may be considered a good candidate for anticancer therapies.\nKeywords: AGS cells, apoptosis, cytotoxic effect, lactiplantibacillus plantarum, serofluid dish\nINTRODUCTION\nGastric cancer is a common disease threatening human health (de Boer et al., 2018). According to GLOBOCAN 2020 compiled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of morbidity among cancers worldwide (Ferlay et al., 2018; Sung et al., 2021). The predominant gastric cancer diagnosed cases are a type referred to as adenocarcinoma of the stomach and develop from the cells of superficial stomach mucous membrane (Wang et al., 2019). In recent years, the age of onset of gastric cancer has decreased, and the morbidity has increased (Jian et al., 2020). As most gastric cancer patients are diagnosed at the late stage, the response to chemotherapy is often very poor, resulting in long-term and serious side effects and a very low 5-years survival rate. It is gratifying that compared with traditional chemotherapy drugs, natural\nEdited by: Yunlei Zhang,\nNanjing Medical University, China\nReviewed by: Vajihe Akbari,\nIsfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran\nPooyan Makvandi, Istituto Italiano di Telemedicina, Italy\n*Correspondence: Peng Chen chenpeng@lzu.edu.cn\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nBiomaterials, a section of the journal\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nReceived: 17 March 2022 Accepted: 05 May 2022 Published: 23 May 2022\nCitation: Zhang R, Zhou Z, Ma Y, Du K, Sun M, Zhang H, Tu H, Jiang X, Lu J, Tu L, Niu Y and Chen P (2022) Anti-Gastric Cancer Activity of the Cell-free Culture\nSupernatant of Serofluid Dish and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum YT013.

As probiotics, Lactobacillus has been proven to have good anticancer effects (Reid 2016). Previous investigations have revealed that the presence of Lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract can improve the composition of intestinal flora, promote peristalsis and reduce the residence time of carcinogens (Kim et al., 2019). In addition, recent studies have confirmed that lactobacilli have a strong and lasting cytotoxic effect on cervical cancer cells, which can inhibit their migration by upregulating the protein of E-cadherin (Li et al., 2017). Lactobacillus can also inhibit the proliferation, migrate and promote apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells (Eslami et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019) and compete with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the mucous layer of the human stomach, thus inhibiting its colonization (Yang et al., 2021). Moreover, Lactobacillus extracts induced apoptosis and prevented cell cycle progression in S-phase, showing that they had anti-proliferative activity on HT-29 and LT-97 cell lines. In another study, some strains of Lactobacillus could mitigate H. pylori infection by preventing its adhesion to epithelial cells and producing some metabolites (Fang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019). One of the common probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract Lacticaseibacillus gasseri could ameliorate H. pylori-induced inflammation by decreasing the expression of BCL-2, \u03b2catenin, integrin \u03b15, and integrin \u03b21 genes in AGS cells (Yarmohammadi et al., 2021). These investigations indicated that probiotics extraordinary increases in bioavailability and is efficient, ecologically safe and low cost for anticancer therapies.\nSerofluid dish (Jiangshui in Chinese) is a kind of traditional fermented vegetable food in Northwest China with a long history, and contains many microorganisms, mainly including\nLactobacillus and Acetobacter (Chen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2021). According to our previous studies, the cell-free culture supernatant of serofluid dish and Lactobacillus had good inhibitory effects on the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, compared with traditional chemotherapy drugs, Lactobacillus, as a natural anticancer resource, have the advantages of safety, high efficiency and fewer side effects, and may play an extraordinarily important role in the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer. Lacticaseibacillus casei LH23, isolated from traditional fermented food, plays an anticancer role by reversing a variety of biological characteristics of cervical cancer cells, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration (Hu et al., 2021). It has also been shown that the exopolysaccharides (EPS) of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) in naturally fermented foods can effectively reduce insulin resistance in HepG2 cells, a-amylase activity and upregulate the expression of GLUT-4, Akt-2 and AMPK genes (Huang et al., 2020). Currently, little is known about the role of serofluid dish in the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer, and further study is urgently needed. This research was performed to assess the anticancer effect of the cell-free culture supernatant of serofluid dish and L. plantarum YT013 on gastric cancer AGS cells and to reveal the potential mechanism involved."

            "text": "Cancer is an important cause of death, and has brought huge burdens to countries around the world (Bray et al., 2018). Cancer treatment involves many different molecular mechanisms. Although many in vitro and in vivo studies have been carried out on the anticancer effects of probiotics, knowledge of their exact molecular mechanisms is incomplete (Saber et al., 2017). In our research, we assessed the influence of CCS1 and CCS2 on the growth of AGS, HCT116, HepG2 and PANC-1 cell lines and investigated their antiproliferation activities in a concentration-dependentmanner (Figures 1, 2). The results indicated that CCS2 could inhibit the proliferation activities of the four cell lines without affecting normal cells.\nThe treated cancer cells were stained and observed by fluorescence microscope is an appropriate way to assess morphological changes and cytotoxicity of cell chromatin and membranes (Haghshenas et al., 2015). To assess the\nFIGURE 7 | Relative protein expression of apoptosis-related proteins in AGS cells by western blotting analysis.

After cells were treated with CCS2, the chromatin was dense, deeply stained, and half-moon- or cap-shaped (bright staining) (Figure 4), and the structure formed by apoptotic bodies were also noted; these are characteristics of apoptotic cells (Galluzzi et al., 2018). Apoptosis and its related signaling pathways are important reasons for the strong rate of cell loss in cancer, with a strong impact on the development of cancer. Additionally, apoptosis can be used as a defense mechanism for cancer progression (Haghshenas et al., 2015; Jorgensen et al., 2017). Mitochondria are recognized to be the bioenergetic and metabolic center essential to life (Chen et al., 2014; Elumalai et al., 2012), and the decrease in MMP is an early manifestation of apoptosis. Cells will enter an irreversible process of apoptosis, as the MMP is lost (Bertheloot et al., 2021). For cells stained with JC-10, a change from red to green occurs with high to low MMP (Chen et al., 2014). Stained results showed that compared with the control groups, the cells treated with CCS2 indicated stronger green and weaker red fluorescence (Figure 5), which correlated positively with the concentration. However, it is not entirely convincing to judge apoptosis only by the experimental results obtained by fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, the accurate pattern of cell death was confirmed by flow cytometry (Haghshenas et al., 2015). After double staining, the total apoptosis rate (6.3, 25.0, 34.1, and 42.6%, respectively) of cells treated with different concentrations of CCS2 were detected by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry with Annexin V\u2013PI staining was used to confirm that CCS2 caused apoptosis in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 6). Studies have proven that the cell-free supernatant of Lacticaseibacillus brevis prevents proliferation and promotes apoptosis in breast cancer (Malik et al., 2018). In another study, found that Lacticaseibacillus casei SR1, SR2, and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei SR4 act against cervical cancer cells via the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway inducing apoptosis (Riaz Rajoka et al., 2018). Apoptosis refers to the phenomenon of cell suicide that is closely regulated; it is a process of cell-autonomous death controlled by genes and an important mechanism to maintain the internal environment (Mohammad et al., 2015). This is a milestone in cancer treatment because cancer cells can be controlled by inducing apoptosis (Evan and Vousden, 2001). BCL-2 family proteins are a pivotal influencing factor for cancer cell mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. By regulating the production of cytochrome c and activating Caspase, the cellular response to death signals can be enhanced, inducing apoptosis (Chen et al., 2015; Sungur et al., 2017). Caspase is a cysteine aspartate-specific protease present in the cytoplasm that is specifically sensitized in the progression of apoptosis (Fan et al., 2005). Caspase-3 is the most commonly studied apoptotic protein, and Caspase-9 is necessary to activate Caspase-3 (Nu\u00f1ez et al., 1998). Caspase-3 is a responder that further promotes the apoptosis signal after activation by a promoter (Van Opdenbosch and Lamkanfi,\n2019). Among them, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 are called promoter Caspases, which are related to cell signal transmission and apoptosis induction (Shafie et al., 2013). Western blotting results showed that treated with CCS2, protein expression levels of BAX and BAD were upregulated, BCL-2 was downregulated, and Caspases-3/8/ 9 were upregulated. Previous studies showed that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strains acquired from human breast milk inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis in HeLa cells by upregulating BAD, BAX, and Caspase-3/8/9 and downregulating BCL-2 (Riaz Rajoka et al., 2019). These results reveled that CCS2 induces AGS cells apoptosis through the Caspase-dependent endogenous mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.\nIn summary, CCS2 significantly and concentrationdependently inhibits the proliferation of AGS cells. CCS2 exerts an inhibitory effect on AGS cell growth, probably by inducing AGS cell apoptosis through the endogenous mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. With the developing understanding of the etiology of malignant tumors, traditional drugs therapy has undergone improvement and innovation. Various drug delivery systems use nanomaterials as carriers to provide new therapeutic strategies for tumor treatment (Makvandi et al., 2021; Ramezani Farani et al., 2022). The targeted implantation of L. plantarum YT013 into the tumor area using this technology will bring unlimited possibilities to overcome gastric cancer."
