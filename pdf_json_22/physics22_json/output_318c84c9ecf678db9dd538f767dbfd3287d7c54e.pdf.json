INTRODUCTION\nThe study of hadron spectroscopy is a useful approach to deepen our understanding of the nonperturbative behavior of strong interaction. In the past decade, big progress has been made on the observation of bottom baryons, which is a crucial step to construct a complete b-hadron spectroscopy. Among these observations, the \u039bb\u00f05912\u00de, \u039bb\u00f05920\u00de, \u039bb\u00f06072\u00de, \u039bb\u00f06146\u00de, \u039bb\u00f06152\u00de, \u039eb\u00f06100\u00de, \u039eb\u00f06327\u00de, and \u039eb\u00f06333\u00de which were reported in Refs. [1\u20136] have a close relation to the low-lying \u039bb and \u039eb baryons. Meanwhile, these P-wave \u03a3b, \u039e0b, and \u03a9b states were also established one by one which are mainly due to the effort from LHCb [7\u201310]. In contrast to the situation of single bottom\nbaryons, none of the double bottom baryons has been discovered, which is becoming not only a challenge but also an opportunity for the future experiments. If further checking the status of bottom and bottom-strange mesons, we can find that the families of bottom and bottom-strange mesons are far from being established since there are only seven states collected in each of the bottom and bottomstrange meson families, which can be referred to the Particle Data Group (PDG) [11]. Thus, constructing the spectroscopy of bottom and bottom-strange mesons is still on the way. Before introducing the motivation of the present work, we\nshould mention the lesson from the investigation of single heavy baryons. Lanzhou group has systematically studied the single heavy baryons by the nonrelativistic constituent quark models [12\u201317], where the diquark picture was employed. These studies not only depicted the newly observed single heavy baryons, but also have stood the test of later experimental observations. For examples, the predicted properties ofP-wave\u03a9b [16] andD-wave\u039eb [17] stateswere confirmed by the LHCb experiments [6,10]. To some extent, our works could be regarded as a typical example of applying the diquark picture to hadron spectroscopy. For the double bottom baryon, we may also treat this\ninteresting system as a quasi-two-body problem if putting\n*Corresponding author. xiangliu@lzu.edu.cn\n\u2020chenbing@ahstu.edu.cn \u2021luosq15@lzu.edu.cn \u00a7weikw@hotmail.com\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Indeed, the heavy-diquark-light-quark picture has been taken into account when calculating the mass spectrum of double bottom baryons [18\u201320]. In the following, we should mention the similarity between the double bottom baryon and the bottom meson if the diquark picture is considered. As illustrated in Fig. 1. the double bottom baryon system could be simplified as a quasi-two-body system in the diquark picture, where the heavy diquark has the same color structure as a heavy antiquark in the bottom meson. Thus, it is naturally expect that the \u03bb-mode excited bbq baryons have the similar dynamics to the bottom mesons. So it provides a possibility to carry a combined study of the mass spectrum of these two kinds of b-hadrons. Besides giving their mass spectrum, in this work, we also\nfocus on the strong decay properties of the bottom meson and double bottom baryon together. As shown later, most of the low-excited \u03bb-mode bbq states are expected to be below the \u039bbB and \u039ebB thresholds. Thus, for the strong decays of these double bottom baryon excitations, two bottom quarks which transit into a final bbq state could be treated as a whole (see Fig. 2). So the heavy diquark is just a spectator in the decay process, which is similar to the strong decay of an excited b\u0304q meson. Therefore, the similarity should exist not only in the spectroscopy of low-lying b\u0304q and bbq states, but also in their strong decays. It means that these two kinds of b-hadrons can be investigated in the same\ntheoretical scheme for their masses and strong decays. In this way, the model parameters fitted by the known b\u0304q mesons can provide a valuable reference to the bbq system since none of bbq states has been discovered. The proposed approach is different from most of studies in the literature, where the b\u0304q and bbq states were studied individually. The paper is organized as follows. After the introduction,\nthe theoretical scheme is introduced in details in Sec. II. The mass spectra and strong decay behaviors of these lowlying b\u0304q and bbq states are investigated in Sec. III and IV, respectively. The similarities of the b\u0304q and bbq systems which are implied in the predicted masses and strong decays are further discussed in Sec. V. Finally, the paper ends with the conclusion and outlook in Sec. VI."

            "text": "It has been a long time since Savage and Wise proposed the superflavor symmetry which can be related to the discussion of the properties of the Q\u0304q mesons and QQq baryons [21]. The emergence of superflavor symmetry is a consequence of the heavy quark limit. In the limit of mQ \u2192 \u221e, two heavy quarks in the QQq baryonic system may form a small weakly bound color triplet subsystem. In literature [22], the fQQg subsystem is also referred to be the heavy diquark. As an approximation, this heavy diquark could be regarded as a static source of color, which plays essentially the same role as the heavy antiquark in a heavylight meson. The superflavor symmetry has been developed and\napplied by Cohen [23], Roberts [24,25], Ma [26] and their collaborators. An important application of the superflavor symmetry is to obtain the properties of these unknown double heavy baryons from the well-measured heavy-light mesons. The superflavor symmetry was used in Ref. [23] to predict the mass difference of two ground double heavy baryons with JP \u00bc 1=2\u00fe and JP \u00bc 3=2\u00fe, respectively, where the masses of two ground heavy-light mesons (the pseudoscalar and vector mesons) were taken as the input. Based on the superflavor symmetry, the selection rule and the spin-counting relation for the strong decays of the double heavy baryon were studied in Ref. [25]. The superflavor symmetry was incorporated into an effective Lagrangian approach in Ref. [26]. Then the masses and decays of ground and 1P (with JP \u00bc 1=2\u2212 and JP \u00bc 3=2\u2212) doubly heavy baryons were predicted. Recently, the superflavor symmetry was also extended to investigate the tetraquark system QiQjq\u0304kq\u0304l [27]. In this work, we are also dedicated to the application of\nsuperflavor symmetry. Differently, we shall take the concrete dynamical model to systematically investigate the mass spectrum and decay behavior of these low-lying Q\u0304q mesons and QQq baryons together, where the superflavor symmetry will be considered. Concretely, a nonrelativistic\n074014-2\nquark potential model1 is employed to calculate the mass spectra of the b\u0304q mesonic and bbq baryonic states. Here, we take the Cornell potential [30] to phenomenologically depict the confining interaction between a 3\u0304 color component2 and the light quark. Based on this consideration, we may construct the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the discussed system, i.e.,\n\u2212 \u22072 2m\u03bc \u2212 4\u03b1 3r \u00fe br\u2212C\u00fe 32\u03b1\u03c3 3e\u2212\u03c3 2r2 9 ffiffiffi \u03c0 p mhmq sh \u00b7 sq \u03c8nL \u00bc E\u03c8nL:\n\u00f01\u00de\nHere, mh and sh denote the mass and the spin of the heavy component h in the b\u0304q=bbq hadrons. Equation (1) has included the spin-spin contact hyperfine interaction between the heavy component h and the light quark. For the \u039ebb and\u03a9bb baryons sh \u00bc 1 is determined, while for the B and Bs mesons, we take sh \u00bc 1=2. The parameters \u03b1, b, and C stand for the strength of the color Coulomb potential, the strength of linear confinement, and a mass-renormalized constant, respectively. By solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the average masses of the bbq and b\u0304q hadrons are obtained. When the following spin-dependent interactions are further incorporated, we can further obtain the mass of these discussed b\u0304q=bbq states. The first spin-dependent interaction\nHT \u00bc 4\u03b1s\n3mhmq\n1\nr3\n3sh \u00b7 rsq \u00b7 r\nr2 \u2212 sh \u00b7 sq\n; \u00f02\u00de\nis a tensor term for depicting the magnetic-dipole-magnetic-dipole color hyperfine interaction. The second spindependent term is the spin-orbit interaction\nHSO \u00bc\n2\u03b1 3r3 \u2212 b 2r 1 m2h \u00fe 4\u03b1 3r3 1 mhmq sh \u00b7 L\n\u00fe\n2\u03b1 3r3 \u2212 b 2r 1 m2q \u00fe 4\u03b1 3r3 1 mhmq sq \u00b7 L; \u00f03\u00de\nwhich arises from both the short-range one-gluon exchange contribution and the long-range Thomasprecession term. As shown in Eqs. (2)\u2013(3), the \u201csh \u00b7 L\u201d coupling and the tensor interaction will vanish in the limit ofmh \u2192 \u221e. Thus, the spin-dependent interactions which are denoted in Eqs. (2)\u2013(3) could be further expressed as\nHSD \u00bc 1\nm2q\n2\u03b1 3r3 \u2212 b 2r sq \u00b7 L\u00fe 1\nmhmq\n4\u03b1 3r3 \u00f0S \u00b7 L\u00fe s\u0302T\u00de\n\u00fe 1 m2h 2\u03b1 3r3 \u2212 b 2r sh \u00b7 L; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere s\u0302T and S are defined as s\u0302T\u00bc\u00f03sh \u00b7rsq \u00b7r\u00de=r2\u2212sh \u00b7sq and S \u00bc sq \u00fe sh, respectively. For the b\u0304q and bbq hadrons, the mh is much larger than the mq \u00f0mh \u226b mq\u00de. Then the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (4) is predominant for the b\u0304q=bbq systems. Accordingly, the practical calculation of mass matrix is\noften performed in the jj coupling scheme, where the basis is defined as jsq; L; jq; sh; Ji with jq \u00bc sq \u00fe L and J \u00bc jq \u00fe sh. For the sake of convenience, the basis jsq; L; jq; sh; Ji could be abbreviated as jjq; JPi without any confusions. The parities of the b\u0304q meson and \u03bb-mode excited bbq baryon are fixed as P \u00bc \u00f0\u22121\u00deL\u00fe1 and P \u00bc \u00f0\u22121\u00deL, respectively. As an example, the basis of Dwave bbq baryons could be defined as the j3=2; 1=2\u00fei, j3=2; 3=2\u00fei, j3=2; 5=2\u00fei, j5=2; 3=2\u00fei, j5=2; 5=2\u00fei, and j5=2; 7=2\u00fei, which could be grouped into the jq \u00bc 3=2 and jq \u00bc 5=2 triplets. The multiplets of all low-lying b\u0304q=bbq states are presented in Fig. 3. In reality, the masses of the antiquark b\u0304 and the diquark fbbg are finite. Then, the degeneracy of the states in a multiplet is broken, and there exist mixing of the states with same JP in the different multiplets. Due to mh \u226b mq, however, the mixing effect of the b\u0304q=bbq states with the\n1In principle, the dynamics of light quark q in the Q\u0304q andQQq systems should be depicted by the relativistic models. When one tries to calculate the masses of low-lying hadron states, however, it is believed that a nonrelativistic model could include many relativistic corrections by a redefinition of its parameters [28], such as the constituent quark masses, the effective parameters in the static potential [see Eq. (1)]. So it can explain why the mass spectra obtained by the relativized quark model are qualitatively similar to those of the usual nonrelativistic model [29]. For the doubly heavy baryons, the excited energies given by the relativistic quark model [20] and the nonrelativistic quark model [18,19] are also nearly equal.\n2It corresponds to the fbbg diquark in a bbq baryon state or the antiquark b\u0304 in a b\u0304qmeson state, which is denoted by the symbol h in the following discussion.\n074014-3\nsame JP is not obvious. It means that the basis jjq; JPi defined in the heavy quark limit could represent the physical state approximatively. The superflavor symmetry is reflected not only in the\nmass spectrum of the b\u0304q and bbq systems, but also in their strong decay behavior. Since the dynamics of light quark q in the b\u0304q and bbq systems is independent of the spin and mass of the heavy component h and only the light quark q takes an active part in the strong decay process, the states of the corresponding multiplets (see Fig. 3) with the same jq but different JP should have the similar decay behavior. We may take the P-wave b\u0304q and bbq states as an example. These four P-wave b\u0304q mesons can be arranged into two doublets, i.e., the \u00f00\u00fe; 1\u00fe\u00dejq\u00bc1=2 and \u00f01\u00fe; 2\u00fe\u00dejq\u00bc3=2, while these five P-wave bbq baryons could be grouped in a doublet and a triplet, i.e., the \u00f01=2\u2212; 3=2\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc1=2 doublet and the \u00f01=2\u2212; 3=2\u2212; 5=2\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc3=2 triplet. Since the b\u0304q mesons in the \u00f01\u00fe; 2\u00fe\u00dejq\u00bc3=2 doublet have been measured to be the narrow states [11], the superflavor symmetry indicates that the P-wave \u039ebb and \u03a9bb baryons in the \u00f01=2\u2212; 3=2\u2212; 5=2\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc3=2 triplet should also be the narrow states. This phenomenon can be reflected by the practical calculations which will be presented in Sec. IV. In this work, it is reasonable to extend the decay formula\nwhich was proposed by Eichten, Hill, and Quigg in Ref. [31] to study the decay of the double bottom baryons. This strong decay formula (or named as the EHQ formula) incorporates the heavy quark symmetry for depicting a decay process of an excited heavy-light meson [32]. The EHQ formula, which has been used to explain the decays of the charm mesons and charm baryons in our previous works [13,33], could be improved as\n\u0393A\u2192BCjC;l \u00bc \u03bejC sh;jB;JB jC;jA;JA MjA;jBjC;l \u00f0p=\u03b2\u00dej 2pe\u2212p 2=6\u03b22 : \u00f05\u00de\nIn this way, the EHQ formula can be used to study the decay properties of both the bottom mesons and the \u03bb-mode excited double bottom baryons. The only difference of the bbq and b\u0304q states is that the spin of the diquark fbbg in a bbq baryon is 1 \u00f0sfbbg \u00bc 1\u00de, while the spin of the antiquark b\u0304 in a b\u0304q meson is 1=2 \u00f0sb\u0304 \u00bc 1=2\u00de. Then, the spin of the heavy quark sQ in the original EHQ formula [31] has been replaced by sh in Eq. (5). A and B in Eq. (5) represent the initial and final\nheavy-light hadrons, respectively, and C denotes the light flavor meson. The magnitude of three-momentum for a final state is denoted as p in the rest frame of the initial state. The flavor factor \u03be in Eq. (5) has been given in Ref. [34]. The symbols sC and l represent the spin of the light hadron C and the orbital angular momentum relative to B, respectively. The normalized coefficient C sQ;jB;JB jC;jA;JA\nis rewritten as\nCsh;jB;JBjC;jA;JA \u00bc \u00f0\u22121\u00deJA\u00fejB\u00fejC\u00fesh ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u00f02jA \u00fe 1\u00de\u00f02JB \u00fe 1\u00de p\n\u00d7 sh jB JB jC JA jA ; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere jC \u2261 sC \u00fe l\u20d7. The CsQ;jB;JBjC;jA;JA denoted by Eq. (6) reflects the requirement of the heavy quark symmetry. The transition factors MjA;jBjC;l \u00f0p=\u03b2\u00de, which is relevant to the nonperturbative dynamics, could be obtained by the various phenomenological models. In our previous work [13,33], the transition factors were extracted by the 3P0 model [35\u201337]. Here, we directly borrow the transition factors from Ref. [33] for the calculation. The parameter \u03b2 denotes the scale of harmonic oscillator wave function for the hadrons involved in the discussed transitions. Since the bbq baryon has been simplified as a quasi-two-body system in the diquark picture, the strong decays of the low-excited bbq and b\u0304q states have the same MjA;jBjC;l \u00f0p=\u03b2\u00de. This is nothing but the consequence of superflavor symmetry which has been stressed above. The parameters involved in the adopted potential model\nare collected in Table II. The dimensionless parameter \u03b3 in the 3P0 model was fixed as 0.125 by the decay width of the P-wave D2\u00f02640\u00de0 state [33], where the value of \u03b2 is taken as 0.38 GeV. One may notice that the mass of bb diquark in Table I is more than twice of the antiquark b\u0304. According to the results in Ref. [38], the effective mass of b quark which was fixed by the discovered bottom baryons is larger than the mass of antiquark b\u0304 in the bottom mesons. So it implies that the constituent quark mass of b quark in a bottom baryon could be different from the mass of b\u0304 in a bottom meson. In our calculation, the mass of antiquark b\u0304 is fixed as 4.64 GeV by the measured bottom mesons. On the other hand, the mass of fbbg diquark is taken as 9.55 GeV, which is larger than the mass of\u03d2 state (m\u03d2 \u00bc 9.46 GeV). This is consistent with the expectation of quark potential models. In fact, the masses of lowest fbbg diquark (the 13S1 state) in Refs. [18\u201320] were also larger than the mass of \u03d2 state. With these parameters as the input, the mass spectrum,\nthe decay width, and the corresponding branching ratio of the discussed b\u0304q and bbq hadrons are obtained in the following sections.\nTABLE I.

However, two broad 1P bottom mesons are not established. As a disputed candidate of the 1P Bmeson, the B J\u00f05732\u00dewas reported in Refs. [39\u201342], where the measured resonant parameters from different experiments are listed in Table III. Exploring higher excited B mesons was continuing. The\nL3 Collaboration reported a bottom meson which could be a 2S or 1D candidate in the hadronic decay process of the Z boson [42]. Its mass and decay width were measured to be 5937 21 4 MeV and 50 22 5 MeV, respectively. However, this B state has never been confirmed by other experiments and none of other the higher excited B state was found in the next many years. In 2013, the CDF Collaboration found a state B\u00f05970\u00de in the B\u03c0 final states [44]. Two years later, the LHCb Collaboration reported two B resonances, the BJ\u00f05840\u00de and BJ\u00f05960\u00de [45]. So far, the spin-parity quantum numbers of these reported B mesons are still undetermined (see the discussions in Ref. [46]). In this work, we try to identify their properties by combing our theoretical result with the experimental data."

As shown in Table IV, the masses of the B1\u00f05721\u00de and B 2\u00f05747\u00de can be well reproduced in our calculation, where we assign these two states as the 1P1 and 13P2 states of the B meson.\nThus, the reported B1\u00f05721\u00de and B 2\u00f05747\u00de belong to the 1P\u00f01\u00fe; 2\u00fe\u00dejq\u00bc3=2 doublet, which indicates that the B1\u00f05721\u00de and B 2\u00f05747\u00de should have similar decay behavior. By the EHQ formula, the total decay width of the B\u00f013P2\u00de meson is calculated to be 26.7 MeV, which is consistent with the experimental data [45]. Under this assignment, the partial width ratio of the B\u03c0 and B \u03c0 decay mode is obtained to be\nR\u00f0B 2\u00f05747\u00de0\u00de \u00bc B\u00f0B 2\u00f05747\u00de0 \u2192 B \u03c0\u00de B\u00f0B 2\u00f05747\u00de0 \u2192 B\u03c0\u00de \u00bc 0.89; \u00f07\u00de\nwhich is also comparable with the LHCb result for the B 2\u00f05747\u00de state, i.e., R\u00f0B 2\u00f05747\u00de0\u00de \u00bc 0.71 0.14 0.30 [45]. Thus, the study of the decay behavior of the B 2\u00f05747\u00de enforces the conclusion of the B 2\u00f05747\u00de as a B\u00f013P2\u00de meson. If assigning the B1\u00f05726\u00de to be a pure 1P1 meson with jq \u00bc 3=2, its total decay width is predicted to be 17.8 MeV in the heavy quark limit, which indicates the B1\u00f05726\u00de to be a narrow state. In reality, the mass of the b quark is not infinite, which makes that the heavy quark symmetry is broken slightly. Thus, the B1\u00f05726\u00de state may contain a small 1P\u00f01=2; 1\u00fe\u00de component, i.e., two 1P01 and 1P1 states of theBmeson listed in Table IV should be as the mixtures between the 1P\u00f01=2; 1\u00fe\u00de and 1P\u00f03=2; 1\u00fe\u00de states B01\u00f05759\u00de B1\u00f05726\u00de \u00bc cos\u03b81P \u2212sin\u03b81P sin\u03b81P cos\u03b81P j1\u00fe;1=2i j1\u00fe;3=2i : \u00f08\u00de\nThe mixing angle \u03b8 is fixed to be \u2212175.3\u00b0 by the nonrelativistic quark potential model. Thus, the physical state B1\u00f05726\u00de has the dominant component of the 1P\u00f03=2; 1\u00fe\u00de state, while the undiscovered B01\u00f05759\u00de is predominantly the 1P\u00f01=2; 1\u00fe\u00de state. When considering this mixing effect, the decay width of the B1\u00f05726\u00de increases to 30.9 MeV as shown in Table V, which is consistent with the LHCb result [45]. In a word, it is reasonable to categorize the B1\u00f05721\u00de and B 2\u00f05747\u00de as the P-wave bottom mesons. We also investigated the other two 1P states of the B meson. Here, the masses of the 13P0 and 1P01 states of the B meson are predicted to be 5724 MeV and 5759 MeV, respectively, which are comparable with the former theoretical results reported in Refs. [47\u201351]. As shown in Table V, the total decay widths of the 13P0 and 1P01 states of the B meson are given as 255.6 MeV and 245.1 MeV, respectively, in line with expectations of the B\u00f013P0\u00de and B\u00f01P01\u00de states having the broad widths as suggested by other theoretical approaches like the 3P0 model [52], the chiral quark model [53], and the QCD sum rule [54]. Since the B\u00f013P0\u00de and B\u00f01P01\u00de states have the broad widths around 200 MeV, experimentally identifying these two P-wave states is not an easy task, which may naturally explain why two members in the 1P\u00f00\u00fe; 1\u00fe\u00de1=2 doublet were not yet established in experiment.

            "text": "Precisely measuring the resonance parameters of 2S heavy-light mesons is full of challenges. We may take the 2S charmedmesons as an example to illustrate this point. As the 2S states of D meson, the D0\u00f02550\u00de0 [55\u201357] and D 1\u00f02600\u00de0 [55\u201358] have been reported for many years. However, the measurements based on the different production processes gave the different results for the resonance\nparameters (see the review paper [59] for more details). The main reason is that distinguishing the broad resonances D0\u00f02550\u00de0 and D 1\u00f02600\u00de0 in the D \u03c0 invariant mass spectrum is difficult.3 A similar situation can happen for the 2S states of the bottom meson (see the predicted widths listed in Table VI). And, a low-energy photon from the B \u2192 B\u03b3 decay was not reconstructed in the realistic analysis of the CDF [44] and LHCb [45] experiments, which makes the results of theBJ\u00f05840\u00de andBJ\u00f05970\u00de to be more uncertain.

The average mass of two members in the 1D\u00f01\u2212; 2\u2212\u00de3=2 doublet is around 6100 MeV, which is about 100 MeV larger than the states in the 1D\u00f02\u2212; 3\u2212\u00de5=2 doublet (see Table IV). As shown in Table VII, the decay properties of these states in different doublets are quite different, while the states in the same doublet have similar decay behavior. The 13D1 and 1D02 states are expected to be broad, while the 13D3 and 1D2 states are much narrower. Here, the 13D1 and 1D02 states decay into the B\n\u00f0 \u00de\u03c0 channel through p-wave, while the B\u00f0 \u00de\u03c0 decays of the 13D3 and 1D2 states occur via f-wave. In addition, the processes B\u00f013D1\u00de \u2192 B\u00f05726\u00de\u03c0 and B\u00f01D02\u00de \u2192 B\u00f05740\u00de\u03c0 proceed via s-wave, while the corresponding strong decays of the 13D3 and 1D2 states occur via d-wave. Obviously, the phase space of decay processes for the 13D1 and 1D02 B states are much larger than that of the 1D2 and 13D3 states. By comparing the measured resonance parameters with\nthe calculated results in Table VII, we find that the BJ\u00f05970\u00de state could be explained as a members of 1D\u00f02\u2212; 3\u2212\u00de5=2 doublet since the measured mass of the BJ\u00f05970\u00de is comparable with the predicted value. Since the photon emitted from the state B \u00f05325\u00de in the decay process BJ\u00f05970\u00de \u2192 B \u00f05325\u00de \u00fe \u03c0 \u2192 B\u03b3 \u00fe \u03c0 cannot be\nreconstructed in experiment [44,45], the enhancement structure of the BJ\u00f05970\u00de state may contain the signals of the 13D3 and 1D2 states.

Interestingly, the average mass of these \u039ebb baryons in the 1D\u00f01=2\u00fe; 3=2\u00fe; 5=2\u00fe\u00de3=2 triplet is about 100 MeV higher than the members in the 1D\u00f03=2\u00fe; 5=2\u00fe; 7=2\u00fe\u00de5=2 triplet. Furthermore, the mass differences of these states in the same triplet are only several MeV. Accordingly, the mixing effect of the 1D \u039ebb baryons which have the same JP is not obvious in the jj coupling scheme.

            "text": "As shown in Table XI, the mass gap between the 1D\u00f01=2\u00fe; 3=2\u00fe; 5=2\u00fe\u00de3=2 and 1D\u00f03=2\u00fe; 5=2\u00fe; 7=2\u00fe\u00de5=2\n7One should be careful to come to the conclusion obtained by the quenched quark model, since the bare masses of the \u03a9bb\u00f010669\u00de and \u03a9bb\u00f010681\u00de states are near to the thresholds of their s-wave decay channels \u039e0bbK and \u039e bbK, respectively. So the nontrivial coupled channel effect should be important for the 1P\u00f01=2; 1=2\u2212\u00de and 1P\u00f01=2; 3=2\u2212\u00de\u03a9bb states. Further theoretical study on this issue should be paid. As a matter of fact, the masses of the \u03a9bb\u00f010669\u00de and \u03a9bb\u00f010681\u00de could be shifted down tens MeV due to the coupled channel effect. Thus, the physical 1P\u00f01=2; 1=2\u2212\u00de and 1P\u00f01=2; 3=2\u2212\u00de\u03a9bb states would be below the thresholds of their OZI-allowed decay channels, which implies that both 1P\u00f01=2; 1=2\u2212\u00de and 1P\u00f01=2; 3=2\u2212\u00de\u03a9bb baryons are the narrow states. In a word, the five 1P \u03a9bb baryons are probably the narrow states. This interesting scenario could be tested by the future experiment.\n074014-11\ntriplets of the 1D \u03a9bb baryons is predicted to be about 80 MeV. Similar to the case for the \u039ebb baryon, the mixing angles of the D-wave \u03a9bb states with the same JP are very small due to the large mass of heavy diquark fbbg. In Table XV, we collect the predicted decay behaviors of these 1D states of the \u03a9bb baryon which are also similar to that of the corresponding \u039ebb counterparts. The \u03a9bb\u00f010971\u00de, \u03a9bb\u00f010975\u00de, and \u03a9bb\u00f010979\u00de in the 1D\u00f01=2\u00fe; 3=2\u00fe; 5=2\u00fe\u00de3=2 triplet are expected to be the broad resonances, while the \u03a9bb\u00f010891\u00de, \u03a9bb\u00f010896\u00de, and \u03a9bb\u00f010898\u00de states in another triplet have the narrow total decay widths. The \u039e0bbK and \u039e bbK are their main decay channels, which could be as the ideal channels to search for these discussed D-wave excited \u03a9bb states.

The partial width ratios of the \u03a9bb\u00f010971\u00de, \u03a9bb\u00f010975\u00de, \u03a9bb\u00f010896\u00de, and \u03a9bb\u00f010898\u00de are comparable with those of D-wave \u039ebb states in Eq. (20), which may provide a direct evidence to reflect the dynamical similarity of the \u039ebb and\u03a9bb systems."

            "heading": "V. FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF THE DYNAMICAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE b\u0304q",
            "text": "AND bbq SYSTEMS\nFor clarity, the main results for the mass spectrum and strong decay behavior of these discussed low-lying b\u0304q and bbq states are presented in Fig. 4. In the following, we discuss the dynamical similarities between the b\u0304q and bbq systems behind our results. For the mass spectra, we first define the following ratios\nR1 \u00bc M\u03042S \u2212M1S M\u03041P \u2212 M\u03041S ; R2 \u00bc M\u03041D \u2212 M\u03041S M\u03041P \u2212 M\u03041S : \u00f023\u00de\nHere, the M\u03041S, M\u03041P, M\u03042S, and M\u03041D represent the average masses of the 1S, 1P, 2S, and 1D states in the B, Bs, \u039ebb, and \u03a9bb sectors. As shown in Table XVII, we find that R1 or R2 for the B, Bs, \u039ebb, and \u03a9bb systems almost have the same values. Since the 1P, 2S, and 1D states of the B=Bs mesons are not well established and none of the bbq baryons have been found in experiment, we should take the predicted R1 and R2 of the b\u0304q=bbq systems to make a comparison with these \u039b0b baryons which could also be regarded as typical heavy-light hadrons in the diquark picture. With the measured masses of \u039bb\u00f05620\u00de, \u039bb\u00f05912\u00de, \u039bb\u00f05920\u00de, \u039bb\u00f06070\u00de, \u039bb\u00f06146\u00de, \u039bb\u00f06152\u00de states, the R1 andR2 values [80] are also listed in Table XVII. Obviously, the predicted R1 or R2 of b\u0304q=bbq states are comparable with the measurements of \u039bb baryons. The nearly equal values of R1 or R2 indicate that the bottom mesons, the single bottom baryons, and the double bottom baryons have the similar dynamics. This novel phenomenon may reflect that the superflavor symmetry is an effective symmetry for these different kinds of bottom hadron systems. In the following, we should mention the spin-orbit\ninversion phenomenon of the highly orbital excitations of the b\u0304q and bbq systems, which may also reflect the dynamical similarity between the b\u0304q and bbq hadrons. The spin-orbit inversion of these P-wave heavy-light mesons has been discussed in Refs. [81\u201383] for many years. Since the P-wave bottom mesons are not established, the spinorbit inversion of the P-wave heavy-light mesons remains inconclusive. According to our predictions in Table IV and XI, the spin-orbit inversion should appear in theD-wave b\u0304q and bbq states since the members in the jq \u00bc 5=2multiplet are about 70\u2013100 MeV lower than the jq \u00bc 3=2 multiplet (see Fig. 4). We try to give a qualitative explanation to this\nphenomenon. For the D-wave excited b\u0304q=bbq states, the contribution from the spin-dependent interactions arising from the short-range one-gluon exchange contribution becomes smaller, while the contribution from the Thomas-precession term from the long-range confining potential becomes dominant. Thus, the first term in Eq. (4), as the mainly spin-dependent interaction for the orbitally excited b\u0304q=bbq states, could be a negative number. In fact, the results from Refs. [47\u201349] also support the existence of the spin-orbit inversion phenomenon for the D-wave B and Bs mesons. The third dynamical similarity of the focused b\u0304q and bbq\nhadron systems can be found in their strong decay behaviors. For the L-wave (L \u00bc 1, 2) excited b\u0304q and bbq states, the members in the jq \u00bc L\u00fe 12 multiplet seem to be much narrower than those in the jq \u00bc L \u2212 12 multiplet. This phenomenon can be reflected from our results in Tables V, VII, X, XIII, XIV, and XV, where the predicted decay widths of these states in the jq \u00bc L\u00fe 12 multiplet are at least one order smaller than those of the states in the jq \u00bc L \u2212 12 multiplet. In fact, this phenomenon has been confirmed by the measured decay widths of the 1P states of the D meson [11]. Here, the decay widths of the D1\u00f02420\u00de\nand D 2\u00f02460\u00de, which belong to the jPq \u00bc 32\u00fe doublet, were measured to be 25\u201350MeV. In contrast, the decay widths of the D 0\u00f02300\u00de and D01\u00f02430\u00de, the states in the jPq \u00bc 12\u00fe doublet, are larger than 200 MeV. For enforcing the conclusion for the decay widths of the jq \u00bc L 12 multiplets, we expect more data of these discussed low-lying b\u0304q and bbq states to be accumulated in the future experiment."

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK",
            "text": "The dynamical similarities between the b\u0304q and bbq systems provide us a possibility to carry a combined study of their properties in the same theoretical framework. In this work, we systematically investigate the mass spectra and strong decays of these low-lying B, Bs, \u039ebb, and\u03a9bb states. Our result not only decodes these newly observed states BJ\u00f05840\u00de, BJ\u00f05970\u00de, BsJ\u00f06064\u00de, and BsJ\u00f06114\u00de, but also reveals the similarities of the b\u0304q and bbq systems existing in their mass spectra and strong decays. According to our results, theBJ\u00f05840\u00de could be a 2S state with JP \u00bc 0\u2212 or JP \u00bc 1\u2212, while the BJ\u00f05970\u00de could be a candidate of the 1D\u00f02\u2212; 3\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc5=2 doublet. Since a lowenergy photon from the B \u2192 B\u03b3 decay was not reconstructed in the realistic measurements of the CDF [44] and LHCb [45] collaborations, the BJ\u00f05840\u00de signal can be resulted by two 2S states of the Bmeson. Similar phenomenon may also happen for the BJ\u00f05970\u00de signal which could contain two states of the 1D\u00f02\u2212; 3\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc5=2 doublet. Thus, we suggest the experiment to further identify the spin-parity quantum numbers for these states, or measure the ratio \u0393\u00f0B \u03c0\u00de=\u0393\u00f0B\u03c0\u00de, which is helpful to clarify the nature of BJ\u00f05840\u00de and BJ\u00f05970\u00de. By comparing to our predicted\nTABLE XVII. The predicted ratios of R1 and R2 defined in Eq. (23) for the b\u0304q and bbq states and a comparison with the measured R1 and R2 of the \u039bb baryons.\nRatios \u039bb B Bs \u039ebb \u03a9bb R1 1.520 1.428 1.399 1.453 1.430 R2 1.780 1.699 1.680 1.715 1.702\n074014-13\nmasses and decays of the Bs mesons, the BsJ\u00f06064\u00de and BsJ\u00f06114\u00de states which were newly observed by the LHCb Collaboration [43] could be grouped into the 1D\u00f01\u2212; 2\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc3=2 and 1D\u00f02\u2212; 3\u2212\u00dejq\u00bc5=2 doublets, respectively. Experimental measurement of the ratio \u0393\u00f0B K\u00de=\u0393\u00f0BK\u00de for the BsJ\u00f06064\u00de and BsJ\u00f06114\u00de states can further provide the valuable information. For other unknown 1P, 2S, and 1D B=Bs mesons, we present a complete prediction for their masses and decay properties, which is useful for the further exploration in the experiment. The undiscovered bbq baryons are also investigated in\nthis work, where the mass spectra and strong decays of these low-lying \u039ebb and \u03a9bb baryons, including the 1S, 2S, 1P, and 1D states, are presented. These predictions may provide some clues for the experiment to search for these double bottom baryons in future. We further point out the similarities between the b\u0304q and\nbbq systems which are implied in their mass spectrum and strong decay. As the first similarity of the b\u0304q and bbq systems, we define two ratios in Eq. (23) and show that the predicted R1 and R2 values are nearly equal for the B, Bs \u039ebb, and \u039ebb states (see Table XV). We further point out that the predictedR1 andR2 of the b\u0304q and bbq systems are also comparable with the measured result of the D meson.\nAs the second similarity, we find a spin-orbit inversion may occur in the D-wave b\u0304q and bbq states. Finally, we point out that the b\u0304q and bbq states in the jq \u00bc L \u2212 12 multiplet are much broader than those in the jq \u00bc L\u00fe 12 multiplet, which could be regarded as the third similarity of b\u0304q and bbq systems. With the accumulation of experimental data, more and\nmore new hadrons have been discovered in the past decades [84,85]. Especially, with the running of LHCb, the studies of heavy flavor hadron enter a new era [86]. When facing on this issue, we have reasons to believe that more progresses on the heavy flavor hadron will be made in the near future. Surely, the present study may provide some valuable information for the experiments in the next stage."
