conclusion This study provides insights to nurse’s experiences of encountering patients with mental illness in ‘PEC’. The results show that nurses strive to lay the foundation for a trusting relationship. Simultaneously nurses encountering is characterized by a mistrust and it is influenced by pre-understanding and emotions when they take care for patients. It is essential that patients suffering from mental illness have access to proper ‘PEC’. Therefore, it is important that nurses’ mental health competencies are strengthened and correspond to the requirements in ‘PEC’. implications for practice and future research The results from this study could be used to develop nurses’ readiness and capability to encounter patients with mental illness and to respond appropriately to the
patients somatic and mental care needs. Awareness of nurses encountering will help to advance the teaching and training of nurses in ‘PEC’. To provide appropriate care based on the specific patient, one needs insight in the patient’s lifeworld. This might be a challenge while developing interventions for education in ‘PEC’. Therefore, interventions need to be dynamically designed to caught different aspects of the patient’s lifeworld.
