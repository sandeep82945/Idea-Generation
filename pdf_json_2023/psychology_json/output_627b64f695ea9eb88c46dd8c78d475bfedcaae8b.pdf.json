            "text": "The transfer of protons via a relay of solvent molecules has long been proposed as a Grotthuss mechanism,1\u20133 where the excess protons diffuse through the hydrogen bond (H-bond) network of water molecules or other hydrogen-bonded liquids through the formation and rupture of the covalent bonds around neighbouring solvent molecules. This mechanism, also known as proton-hopping or a proton-jump, may ubiquitously exist in bio-systems,4 although the proof is somewhat elusive. Chemically, this can be probed by the solvent-catalyzed proton transfer (SCPT) reaction5 of the designated chromophore in the excited state triggered by light excitation, where the proton-transferred isomer exhibits a distinct emission from that of the normal\nUniversity, Taipei, 10617 Taiwan, ROC.\nic University, New Taipei City, 24205,\nu.edu.tw ESI) available.

The ratiometric emission and the corresponding relaxation dynamics serve as a signal transduction for the mechanism study.6\nPertinent systems require core chromophores with proton donor and acceptor sites that possess sufficient distance between them such that intramolecular H-bond formation does not exist. As a result, if the designated molecule undergoes excited-state proton transfer in solution, in theory, either aggregate-catalyzed proton transfer or SCPT must be operative. In this regard, one of the prototypical systems is ascribed to 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine, or themore common name of 7-azaindole (7AI, see Scheme 1), which can be simply viewed as an analogous structure of the nucleobase adenine or the amino acid tryptophan.7\u201310\nIn the self-catalyzed proton transfer reaction, excited-state double-proton transfer takes place via the formation of 7AI hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) dimer in nonpolar solvents, resulting in the 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine tautomeric dimer. The associated reaction dynamics have provided valuable information regarding the role of proton-transfer tautomerization in the possible mutation of the adenine-thymine base pair.11\u201313\nAs for the excited-state SCPT, 7AI has also been applied to mimic tryptophan, where excited state SCPT occurs via the\nChem.

Waluk and co-workers have studied SCPT in a number of pyrrole\u2013pyridine systems.16\u201319 Further SCPT study has been extended to another class of molecules where the 7-hydroxyquinoline enol form (7HQ, Scheme 1b) serves as a prototype.20\nThere is considerable distance between the proton-donating and -accepting sites of 7HQ (cf. 7AI), and the occurrence of excited-state SCPT in, e.g., methanol, requires the formation of a 1 : 2 7HQ : methanol cyclic H-bonded complex, resulting in a keto-tautomer (Scheme 1b). However, the \u2013OH group in 7HQ is much more acidic than that of the pyrrolic-H group in 7AI. Therefore, proton-transfer tautomerism also takes place for 7HQ in the ground state, resulting in a non-negligible amount of keto-tautomer in methanol. In stronger H-bonded solvents such as water, the ground-state equilibrium between enol and keto forms is nearly 1 : 1 for 7HQ. The co-existence of enol and keto tautomer complicates the study of excited-state SCPT.21\nRecently, the replacement of \u2013OH in 7HQ by less acidic amino protons has been reported, forming 7-aminoquinoline\n7238 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 7237\u20137247\n(7AQ, see Scheme 1c) and its derivatives, where one amino proton of \u2013NH2 can be substituted by \u2013R, with various degrees of electron donating/withdrawing strength to ne-tune the \u2013NRH acidity.22 Such a conguration prevents the formation of the ground-state tautomer imino-form in methanol (Scheme 1c). However, the \u2013NRH single bond rotation is unavoidable and results in unsymmetrical distribution of the amino proton along the C(7)-N bond (see Scheme 1c), which complicates the excited-state SCPT study. To advance in the study of long-range SCPT, it is necessary to explore a rigid system with only a single, well-dened structure in the ground state, where its protondonating and -accepting sites are far separated at a designated distance suitable for probing fundamental insights into excited-state SCPT.\nHerein, we report the strategic design and synthesis of a new class of the SCPT system by fusing the amino proton of 7AQ, which results in the formation of pyrroloquinoline (PyrQ, see Scheme 1). PyrQ can be regarded as an extension of 7AI by adding a fusing benzene ring between pyrrole and pyridine moieties, so that the proton donor and acceptor are far more separated than that of 7AI. Importantly, the rigid pyrrolic ring prevents N\u2013H rotation, and the protruding C(9)\u2013H site (Scheme 1d) imposes steric hindrance to prevent the dimeric formation that was reported in 7AIs under high concentration.8 These designed strategies eliminate the aforementioned complications, which simplies experimental and theoretical approaches (vide infra).\nWe also derivatized PyrQ such that the aldehyde or cyanide group can be tailored at the C(3)-position in an aim to probe the structure-SCPT relationship. The synthetic route of these PyrQs involves multiple steps and is non-trivial (see Scheme 2). Comprehensive spectroscopy and dynamics, together with computation in quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics (MD) approaches, were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of long-range H-bonded relay SCPT. Details are elaborated in the following sections."

The C(*)-position (see Scheme 2) of compound 4 was brominated, followed by reaction with ethynyltrimethylsilane under a palladium and copper co-catalyst, i.e., the Sonogashira coupling, to obtain compound 6.25 A subsequent cyclization reaction transformed 6 into compound 7, which then underwent oxidization with O2/active charcoal to yield PyrQ in satisfactory yield (48%).26\nFor further derivatization, PyrQ was converted to PyrQ-al via the Vilsmeier\u2013Haack reaction.27 Also, the C(3)\u2013H hydrogen of compound 7was substituted with a cyano group, yielding nitrile 9 via one-pot transformation of electron-rich aromatics into the aromatic nitriles using the Vilsmeier\u2013Haack reaction. Then, 9 was deprotected into 10, but was unstable and required immediate oxidization with O2/active charcoal to yield PyrQ-CN. The details regarding PyrQ, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN characterization are elaborated in the ESI.\u2020\nThe X-ray diffraction pattern of PyrQ is depicted in Fig. 1, and shows a fully planar conguration. Different from 7AQs (see Scheme 1c), which have been found to have cis- and trans-forms relative to the NR-H orientation along the C\u2013N bond,22 there is only one conguration for PyrQ because of the fused pyrrolic nitrogen. The distance between the proton donor site N(1) and proton acceptor site N(8) is as far as 5.14 \u00c5, which is signicantly longer than that of 4.84 \u00c5 for 7AQ.22 Because of this long distance, the intrinsic intramolecular proton transfer is not feasible. Instead, in solution, if excited-state SCPT occurs, PyrQ requires a long-range, multiple solvent H-bond relay to bridge the proton donor and acceptor sites, which virtually act as a conduit to assist the proton transfer reaction. We also made great efforts to grow the crystal of other PyrQs but unfortunately failed, possibly because of hindrance by the C(3)-substitution."

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was measured to be 25.7%, 5.5%, and 4.2% for PyrQ, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN, respectively (see Table 1), where a high PLQY of PyrQ indicates the structural rigidity of the core, and hence, low internal reorganization energy. In other polar aprotic solvents such as CH2Cl2, similarly, all studied PyrQs exhibited solely normal Stokes-shied emission, and no anomalous emission phenomenon was observed (see Fig. S25\u2020).\nIn methanol, by sharp contrast, the electronic excitation of all PyrQs revealed dual emission, consisting of a blue emission band maximized at 461 nm, 413 nm, and 416 nm, denoted as the F1 band, and an obvious shoulder (the F2 band) located at approximately 600 nm, 527 nm, and 524 nm for PyrQ, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN, respectively. The excitation spectra monitored at the F1 and F2 bands are identical, and also resemble the absorption spectrum (see Fig. S23\u2020). Therefore, the dual emission originating from the same ground state is unambiguous, and two emissions correlated with two excited states are expected to possess a precursor-successor kinetic relationship (vide infra).\nKnowing that the dual emission properties are only observed in protic solvents when the H-bonding formation with PyrQs in the ground state has been veried (vide supra), it is reasonable to propose the occurrence of excited-state SCPT in methanol, where protons migrate from the N(1)\u2013H site to the N(8) site of\n\u223c524 (F2)d a The absorption peak wavelength in cyclohexane or methanol. b The uorescence peak wavelength in cyclohexane or methanol.

The aminoconformer and the imino-conformer thus exhibit F1 and F2 bands, respectively (Scheme 1d).\nTo gain in-depth insight into the SCPT dynamics, we then probed the uorescence relaxation dynamics by carrying out time-resolved uorescence spectroscopy. Because the F1 and F2 bands can be resolved in a steady-state manner, we predicted the kinetics of SCPT for PyrQs to be relatively slow in the range of tens to hundred picoseconds. We therefore exploited the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique, coupled with a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser as an excitation source (120 fs) and a fast MCP-PMT detector as the acquisition system. This overall system response time gives approximately 13 ps resolution aer deconvolution.\nIn our experience, if the associated kinetic time constant is >15 ps, the current TCSPC system with its low excitation photon ux and rapid counting speed is more reliable than that of the femtosecond emission up-conversion technique currently used in our laboratory. Fig. 3a and b depicts the emission relaxation proles of PyrQs monitored at the F1 and F2 bands, and their pertinent data are displayed in Table 2. For PyrQ, upon monitoring at the F1 band emission of, e.g., 450 nm, the relaxation of emission reveals a single exponential decay component (Fig. 3a), and the lifetime was tted to be 44 ps.\nWhen monitoring at the F2 band region of, e.g., 640 nm, the most optimal t for the kinetic prole is an increasing component of 42 ps and two exponential decay time constants of 45 ps and 427 ps (Fig. 3b). The 42 ps risetime component, within experimental uncertainty, is consistent with the 44 ps decay time constant for normal emission (the F1 band). Firm support for this viewpoint is given by the deconvolution of the F2 band (640 nm), which is composed of a rise (44 ps) and two decay (44 ps and 427 ps) components under the consideration of the system response function (see Fig. 3c).\nIn cyclohexane, where no SCPT takes place, the lifetime of PyrQ's normal emission (the F1 band) was measured to be as long as 3.7 ns (see Fig. S27\u2020). Therefore, it is reasonable for us to assume that the decay of the F1 band in methanol is dominated by the rate of SCPT. We thus concluded that the rate of SCPT (PyrQ) was equal to the inverse of 44 ps, which is 2.27\u00d7 1010 s\u22121. Next, the approximately 45 ps decay component monitored at 640 nm was more plausibly attributed to the residue of the F1 emission. This viewpoint can be rationalized by minimal separation between the proximal F1 and F2 bands. In addition, the radiative decay rate constant for the F1 band was signicantly larger than that of the F2 band (vide infra). Therefore, despite the fact that the F1 emission intensity was rather low at 640 nm, its contribution to TCSPC is non-negligible. Finally, the 427 ps decay component of the F2 band can reasonably be ascribed to the population decay of the imino-tautomer.\nThe TCSPC data for PyrQ-al and PyrQ-CN emissions are also depicted in Fig. 3a and b. The decay lifetimes of F1 for PyrQ-al and PyrQ-CN were tted at 100 ps and 155 ps, respectively, which correlate well with the risetime of the corresponding F2 bands of 104 ps and 155 ps, respectively (see Table 2).

(c) The deconvolution of relaxation kinetics of the F2 emission for PyrQ in MeOH is shown (monitored at 640 nm), which clearly indicates the cancellation of the decay and rise features due to the non-negligible overlap between normal and tautomer emissions.

These results imply that an increase in the electron-withdrawing ability at the C(3)-\nposition decreases the rate of SCPT, which seems to be contradictory to the expected increase in kSCPT due to the increase in the N(1)\u2013H acidity by the C(3) electron-withdrawing strength via a resonance effect. This puzzle is reminiscent of previously reported SCPT molecules where the chemical substitution not only inuenced the proton-donating site but also the proton-accepting site.14\u201322\nTo probe the interplay between the proton-donating and -accepting sites of PyrQs, pKa values for the pyrrolic proton N(1)\u2013H and the protonated pyridium N(8)+\u2013H in PyrQs were measured by pH-titration absorption spectrometry in water. The titration spectra are shown in Fig. S29,\u2020 and the pertinent data are listed in Table 1. As a result, the pKa value of the N(1)\u2013H proton was measured to be PyrQ (approximately 14), PyrQ-al (11.8), and PyrQ-CN (11.6) at room temperature, and decreased upon increase in the electron-withdrawing ability from H in the aldehyde to the cyano group. In yet another approach, the pKa of the N(8)+\u2013H proton at 25 \u00b0C was also measured by absorption pH titration and determined to be 6.3, 5.3, and 5.1 for PyrQ, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN, respectively. Accordingly, the pKb of the N(8) site, based on pKa + pKb = 14, was calculated to be 7.7, 8.7, and 8.9 for PyrQ, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN, respectively. Therefore, the basicity is in the order of PyrQ > PyrQ-al > PyrQ-CN. In other words, the N(1)\u2013H donor and N(8) proton acceptor are inuenced by the C(3) substitution via a resonance effect.\nIt should be noted that we are aware that excited-state phenomena would be based on excited-state pK*a values (* denotes the electronically excited state), which are conventionally measured by uorescence pH titration experiments. However, the validity of this approach is based on the establishment of excited-state equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated species, which is not the case due to the fast SCPT of tens to hundred ps for the studied PyrQs. Therefore, we only acquired the pKa for each site and assumed a similar trend for pK*a in the excited state.\nFig. 4 depicts a plot of the rate constant for excited-state SCPT (kSCPT) as a function of the pKb of the N(8) site. The trend of increasing kSCPT upon increase in the N(8) basicity infers that the rate-determining step is prone to the protonaccepting property of the N(8) site rather than the proton donation of the N(1)\u2013H site. Further in-depth discussion will be elaborated in the section on MD simulation.29\nWe also performed time-resolved uorescence measurement of N(1)\u2013H-deuterated PyrQ, namely PyrQ-D in methanol-d1 (CH3OD). The observed kSCPT rate and the tautomer population decay lifetime were 1.35 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121 (74 ps) and 834 ps, respectively. The kSCPT of PyrQ-D was smaller than that (2.27 \u00d7 10 10 s\u22121) of PyrQ-D by 1.68 times. Because kSCPT is the dominant decay process for the F1 band (vide supra), the F2/F1 ratio for PyrQ-D is expected to be smaller than that for PyrQ by approximately 1.68 fold. However, as shown in Fig. 2, the 1.11 ratio of steady-state emission intensity for F2/F1 between PyrQ and PyrQ-D seems to conict with the kinetic measurement (Tables 2 and S4\u2020).\nThis controversy is not unusual, and can be rationalized by the different nonradiative decay rate of the F2 band between PyrQ (in CH3OH) and PyrQ-D (in CH3OD). The overall PLQY was\nChem.

The PLQY of F2 can be further deduced by convolution of the dual uorescence spectra, assuming a dominant SCPT in the excited state, which gives 0.042% and 0.062% for PyrQ and PyrQ-D, respectively. For the F2 band of PyrQ-D in CH3OD, the population decay time (1/ kobs) was measured to be 834 ps, which is twice as long as 427 ps for PyrQ in CH3OH (Table 2).\nWe applied PLQY = kr/kobs = kr/(kr + knr), where kr and knr denote the radiative decay rate and nonradiative decay rate constants for the F2 band, respectively. kr and knr were then deduced and are listed in Table S4.\u2020 Clearly, while kr of the F2 band is approximately the same between PyrQ and PyrQ-D, the knr of 1.20 \u00d7 10\n9 s\u22121 for PyrQ-D in CH3OD is nearly twice as slow as that (2.34 \u00d7 109 s\u22121) for PyrQ in CH3OH. Because the O-D stretching frequency is lower than that of O\u2013H, it is thus reasonable to expect that the emission quenching associated with vibronic coupling in the PyrQ-D/CH3OD H-bonded complex is weaker than that in the PyrQ/CH3OH H-bonded complex.\nPrevious reports have established a mechanism for SCRT that requires a series of H-bonded solvent molecules to bridge proton donor and acceptor parts, forming a conduit for the occurrence of a relay type of proton transfer.14\u201322 Due to the great separation distance of 5.136 \u00c5 between N(1) and N(8) atoms, intuitively, there will be insufficient length with two methanol molecules to construct an H-bonded relay for the SCPT reaction in PyrQs.\nFor a solvent relay consisting of a distance greater than that of two methanol molecules, the structure of the H-bonded relay to bridge the N(1)\u2013H and N(8) sites may have multiple congurations. To extract the population of these congurations among all randomized solvated methanol molecules, we then performed MD simulation,29 the results of which would be able to differentiate the relay states from those of the bulk states (excluding the relay states). The details of the corresponding results and discussion are elaborated below.\n7242 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 7237\u20137247"

Before accessing MD, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed byGaussian 16 (ref. 30) to gain insight into the structure\u2013thermodynamics relationship between normal and proton-transferred tautomer forms. The molecular structure in the ground state (S0) was optimized by DFT, and the excited-state (S1) geometries and related optical properties were computed by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid function.31\u201333 6-31+G(d,p) was used as the basis set throughout the calculation.34\u201337\nThe calculations were carried out in methanol using a polarizable continuummodel (PCM).38 We also performed the calculation using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)33 level (see Table S6\u2020). In comparison, the results of B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) were closer to the experimental values from the energy point of view, such as absorption and emission. Alternatively, the structural parameters based on B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) seemed to be more convenient for the MD approach and will be used later.\nThe pertinent data for DFT calculations for PyrQs (in methanol) are listed in Table S5.\u2020 Clearly, the calculated absorption and emission energy gaps were consistent with the experimentally observed peak wavelengths for the amino-(normal) and imino-(tautomer) forms. For the normal form, the calculated emission gap was in the order of PyrQ < PyrQ-al < PyrQ-CN, which can be rationalized by the electron-withdrawing strength of the substituent at the C(3) position, which was in the order of H (PyrQ) < HC]O (PyrQ-al) < CN (PyrQ-CN).\nAs shown in Fig. 5a (also in Fig. S31 and S32\u2020) the electron density distribution for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for PyrQs covered the C(3) substituents, while it was negligible for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Therefore, the increase in electron-withdrawing strength of the C(3)-substituent decreases the energy of HOMO, whereas there is little change in LUMO (see Fig. 5a and S30\u2013S32\u2020), resulting in an increase in the energy gap. There is a similar argument for the tautomer form (see Fig. 5a and S30\u2013S32\u2020), and the calculated results were consistent with the experimental observations (Fig. 2). Fig. 5b depicts the relative energies between the normal and tautomer forms in the S0 and S1 states, where SCPT in the excited state is energetically favorable by >15 kcal mole\u22121 for all PyrQs, while clearly the proton transfer is thermally unfavorable by more than 8 kcal mol\u22121 in the ground state.\nWe next performed preliminary DFT calculations to examine the methanol molecules required for forming the H-bonded relay suitable for SCPT of PyrQs. We started from two methanol molecules placed around the N(1)\u2013H and N(8) sites of PyrQs, and then completed the structural optimization (Fig. 5c, d, and S33\u2020) under a continuum model (methanol). As a result, the two methanol molecules in the methanol-PyrQs (2 : 1) hydrogen-bonded complex, where each methanol attaches to either the N(1)\u2013H or N(8) site, are separated far away by >5 \u00c5 (see Fig. 5c). When three methanol molecules were used, the associated methanol-PyrQs complex will not be able to form a hydrogen-bonded relay conguration (Fig. 5d). Aer obtaining these results, we next performed the MD calculation elaborated in the following section.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Herein, explicit solvent MD29 simulations with AMBER 20 39 were performed on a series of PyrQ-derived molecules (PyrQ, PyrQ-D, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN) in methanol to investigate their dynamics and equilibrium between the bulk and relay state (see Fig. 6a) in methanol. The results indicate that the PyrQs are dynamically coupled to the methanol relay conguration in a hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 6).\nThese results, together with the close-up inspections of the H-bonding congurations for each PyrQs inmethanol, elicit two important remarks. First, methanol micro-solvation with hydrogen-bonding does exist for the N(1)\u2013H and N(8) site in PyrQs (Fig. 6a). Second, there are clearly time-dependent conguration changes in the methanol relay state and bulk state (Fig. 6b). When compared with explicit methanol MD simulations, a locally uctuating density prole is revealed, and therefore, it seems apparent that fewer trapped methanol molecules associate with the sites. Both results are consistent\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nwith the experimental observations. With MD simulation, we are able to dene how many methanol molecules are feasibly required to conduct the proton transfer (Fig. 7a) and estimate the fraction of both states from the output trajectory.40 In the current study, we used femtosecond (fs) time resolution to analyse the MD trajectory data of PyrQs (see the Experimental Section).\nAll the PyrQ MD trajectories were collected up to 10 ns, with every 1 fs as a snapshot resolution. The 10 ns simulated period is reasonably longer than sdecay of SCPT in the current timeresolved experiment, and therefore, a total of 107 fs snapshot structures were used to obtain the statistics for the H-bond relay congurations. To precisely measure the time-dependent evolution of methanol relay structures in the PyrQ:(MeOH)n complex, it is necessary for the relevant methanol orientations between N(1)\u2013H and N(8) to strictly obey these two rules: (1) the distance between the H atom and the acceptor O or N atom (r(N\u2013H/O) or r(O\u2013H/O) or r(O\u2013H/N)) must be shorter and within 2.5 \u00c5; (2) the angle of: O/H\u2013N,:H\u2013O/O, and:N/ H\u2013O must be 150\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\nSuch criteria are substantial for the complex of chains of MeOH molecules engaged in the Grotthuss-type transport1 of a proton, i.e., the proton-jump,2 via an H-bond relay located between the SCPT-triggered proton donor and the proton acceptor. The relay is a group bearing an H atom able to accept an H-bond from the methanol relay group, and at the same time, form an H-bond with the proton-accepting chain. Note that because the computation time and capacity are limited, the MD simulation in the current study is based on ground-state-optimized PyrQs. Also, the ground-state MD simulation to probe fractions between bulk and relay congurations takes advantage of the thermally unfavorable ground-state SCPT in the relay PyrQ states, which eliminates the complication of simulation in the excited state due to SCPT.\nTheMD simulation results shown in Fig. 6 conrm the above viewpoint through observation of the transformation between the bulk state and relay state of PyrQ. Additionally, it was noted that the cyclic methanol train(s) is not an isolated H-bond system. There is a huge methanol source that can immediately participate in the H-bonding in the PyrQ:(MeOH)n complex when one hydrogen bond is broken. For the observed duration up to 10 ns, the PyrQ:(MeOH)n complexes of n$ 6 were too few in fraction and can thus be ignored (Fig. 6a and 7a). These results imply that the contribution to SCPT is mainly from the congurations of PyrQ:(MeOH)3, PyrQ:(MeOH)4, and PyrQ:(MeOH)5.\nThese results are also consistent with at least three (n $ 3) methanol molecules being required to form a PyrQ:(MeOH)n relay state in the above DFT calculation. Fig. 7a illustrates this point by showing the distributions of different cyclic relay congurations, with an equilibrium fraction less than 3%. Also, we found that the formation of \u2018reactive\u2019 complexing geometry requires additional nearly linear hydrogen bonds to the N(1)\u2013H and N(8) sites, as illustrated by showing the MD snapshot of PyrQ:(MeOH)3 (Fig. S34\u2020).

To consider n= 3, 4, and 5 for PyrQs:(MeOH)n, the bulk state existence time (s1) and the relay state existence time (s\u22121) were counted within an observed duration of 10 ns (see Fig. 7a). In concept, this existence time (s1 and s\u22121) was analyzed by the MD trajectory statistics, and s\u22121/s1 thus is equivalent to a pre-equilibrium constant Keq between the bulk and relay type of solvation. If one assumes 1/s\u22121, denoted as k\u22121, is >proton-transfer (tunneling) rate kPT (see Scheme 3), the overall excited-state SCPT rate kSCPT can be expressed by eqn (1) below.40\u201342\nkSCPT \u00bc s 1s1 kPT \u00bc k1 k 1 kPT \u00bc Keq kPT (1)\nThe Keq value calculated by MD simulation (see Table 3) was used in eqn (1), as well as the experimentally obtained kSCPT (Table 2), and thus, the proton tunnelling rate kPT was calculated to be 8.11 \u00d7 1011 s\u22121, 4.55 \u00d7 1011 s\u22121, and 3.82 \u00d7 1011 s\u22121 for PyrQ, PyrQ-al, and PyrQ-CN, respectively (Fig. 7b and Table 3). Clearly, the tunnelling rate kPT is inuenced by the N(3)substituent and leads to a decrease in the basicity, i.e., the ability to accept protons is in the order of PyrQ > PyrQ-al > PyrQCN. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to conclude that the N(8) proton-accepting process plays a role in the rate-determining step.\nExperimentally, the ratio for the measured kSCPT (2.27 \u00d7 10 10 s\u22121) of PyrQ versus that (1.35 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121) of PyrQ-D is 1.68. Although Keq is virtually the same between PyrQ (0.028 in CH3OH) and PyrQ-D (0.029 in CH3OD, see Table 3) from MD simulation, the major difference lies in the deduced tunnelling\nScheme 3 The proposed overall excited-state SCPT process for PyrQs in methanol, where the H-bonded relay structure is presented using the PyrQs:(MeOH)3 configuration.

Finally, it should be noted that the above Keq is based on the sum of the fraction of the n = 3 to 5 methanol relay, assuming they all undergo a similar kPT. Considering that the increasing number of solvents involved in the geometrical relay leads to a decrease in the SCPT rate,40 n = 3 should be considered as the major contributor to execute excited-state SCPT. Therefore, the Keq deduced here is considered as an upper limit. For example, KKeq z 1.6% (see Fig. 7a) for PyrQ if we only take n = 3 into account for the occurrence of excited-state SCPT.\nSummarizing all of the above results and discussion, the overall excited-state SCPT for PyrQs is depicted in Scheme 3, where an equilibrium is established between bulk solvated, i.e., non-H-bonded relay PyrQs and H-bonded relay PyrQs. The contribution of the H-bonded relay PyrQs was small (<3%), and their direct excitation and the associated fast proton transfer was not pursued in this study. The major bulk solvated PyrQs, upon excitation, undergo equilibration with the H-bonded relay PyrQs state, from which proton transfer takes place. The overall kinetic expression is depicted by eqn (1), where the tunnelling rate kPT is N(3)-substituent- as well as N(1)\u2013H deuterium isotope-dependent."

Energies and densities were monitored to ensure adequate convergence within\n7246 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 7237\u20137247\nthe equilibration period. Aer equilibration, the 10 ns NVT ensemble was implemented at 300 K to collect 107 fs snapshots per system for the time-resolved structural analyses."
