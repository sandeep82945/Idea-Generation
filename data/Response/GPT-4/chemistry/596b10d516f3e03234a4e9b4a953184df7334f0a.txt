Investigation of Other Metalloporphyrins in Ionic Liquid Electrolytes: Exploring a broader range of metalloporphyrins, such as those containing iron, zinc, or manganese centers, in various ionic liquid solvents could unveil differences in catalytic activities, selectivity, and mechanisms. This could lead to identifying more efficient catalysts for CO2 reduction.

Development of Hybrid Ionic Liquid Systems: Combining different ionic liquids or creating hybrid systems with additives or co-solvents to enhance the solubility and reactivity of CO2. This could also involve studying the effects of varying the alkyl chain length on the anion or cation of the ionic liquid to optimize CO2 capture and reduction efficiency.

Real-time Monitoring and Analysis Techniques: Employing or developing advanced in-situ analytical techniques such as time-resolved SERS or SEIRAS to capture the dynamics of CO2 reduction at the electrode-ionic liquid interface. This could provide deeper insights into the transient intermediates and the effect of electric fields on reaction pathways.

Electrode Material and Design Optimization: Researching the effect of different electrode materials, surface structures, and modification strategies on the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 reduction. This includes studying nanostructured, porous, or composite materials to enhance the electrocatalytic surface area and facilitate electron transfer.

Scaling and Integration into Electrochemical Systems: Investigating the scalability of the CO2 reduction process using metalloporphyrins in ionic liquids and integrating this process into existing industrial electrochemical systems. This includes the design of continuous flow reactors, the development of stable and recyclable catalysts, and the assessment of the overall energy efficiency and environmental impact.
