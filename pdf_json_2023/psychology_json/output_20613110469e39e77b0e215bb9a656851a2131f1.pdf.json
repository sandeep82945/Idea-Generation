    "abstractText": "Heteroatom doping is considered an effective method to substantially improve the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx MXene for supercapacitors. Herein, a facile and controllable strategy, which combines heat treatment with phosphorous (P) doping by using sodium phosphinate (NaH2PO2) as a phosphorus source, is used to modify Ti3C2Tx. The intercalated ions from NaH2PO2 act as \u201cpillars\u201d to expand the interlayer space of MXene, which is conducive to electrolyte ion diffusion. On the other hand, P doping tailors the surface electronic state of MXene, optimizing electronic conductivity and reducing the free energy of H+ diffusion on the MXene surface. Meanwhile, P sites with lower electronegativity owning good electron donor characteristics are easy to share electrons with H+, which is beneficial to charge storage. Moreover, the adopted heat treatment replaces \u2013F terminations with O-containing groups, which enhances the hydrophilicity and provides sufficient active sites. The change in surface functional groups increases the content of high valence-stated Ti with a high electrochemical activity that can accommodate more electrons during discharge. Synergistic modification of interlayer structure and chemical state improves the possibility of Ti3C2Tx for accommodating more H+ ions. Consequently, the modified electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 510 F g\u22121 at 2 mV s\u22121, and a capacitance retention of 90.2% at 20 A g\u22121 after 10,000 cycles. The work provides a coordinated strategy for the rational design of high-capacitance Ti3C2Tx MXene electrodes.",

            "text": "Electrochemical energy storage devices are considered one of the most promising energy storage technologies to solve the global energy crisis, with batteries and supercapacitors as the two main devices [1,2]. In particular, supercapacitors have significant advantages such as high specific energy, high power density, long cycle life, and rapid charging and discharge [3\u20135], which can be classified into electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs) [6]. EDLCs tend to exhibit lower energy density due to the limited accessible surface area, instead, PCs can store more charges by their Faradaic redox mechanism [7,8]. However, most well-studied pseudocapacitive materials, such as conducting polymers and transition metal oxides, suffer from volumetric swelling/contraction, limited cycling performance, and high electrode resistance [9,10].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4892. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28134892 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nThus, the exploration of new electrode materials with outstanding electrochemical performance is an imminent challenge for developing high-performance energy storage devices. MXene, a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbide/nitride, has attracted great attention as a pseudocapacitive electrode material in electrochemical energy storage due to its good conductivity, excellent hydrophilicity, large specific surface area, high mechanical strength, and adjustable interlayer spacing [11\u201317]. The most promising type of MXene, Ti3C2Tx, is obtained by etching Al layers in the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase with HF [18\u201320], HCl\u2013LiF [21], or Lewis acidic molten salt [22], where T represents terminal groups \u2013O, \u2013OH, or \u2013F on the surface of Ti3C2Tx, and x is the number of terminal groups [23,24]. In H2SO4 electrolyte, Ti3C2Tx has a high theoretical capacitance due to the efficient electric double layer (EDL) charge accumulation in the interlayer space and the fast pseudocapacitive proton insertion/desertion by surface redox reactions [25]. Generally, the capacitive performance of MXene is primarily determined by its surface chemistry state, which dictates the interaction mechanism and binding strength between the adsorbates and MXenes and thus contributes to the electrochemical performance [26]. Among the terminations of MXene (\u2013O, \u2013OH, \u2013F), \u2013O groups with lower electronegativity (3.5) own good electron donor characteristics, which not only facilitates the electrostatic accumulation of electrons at the electrode surface, giving rise to the increase in EDL capacitance but also works as active sites for proton bonding/debonding, leading to the enhancement in pseudocapacitance. Moreover, when MXene is doped with heteroatom N with lower electronegativity (3.04), a significant improvement in electrochemical performance is achieved by structural, compositional, and surface electronic regulation. For example, Yang et al. prepared nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx by annealing in ammonia, which yields 192 F g\u22121 at 1 mV s\u22121 in 1 M H2SO4 and remains 67% of initial capacitance over the scan rates from 1 to 200 mV s\u22121 [27]. Zhang et al. prepared a nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx film electrode with a hydrothermal method using hydrazine hydrate as a nitrogen source, which delivers 340 F g\u22121 at 2 mV s\u22121 and no capacitance degradation after 10,000 cycles in 1 M H2SO4 [28]. Pu et al. prepared a new type of N-doped MXene electrode from non-toxic biological chitosan, which delivers 286.28 F g\u22121 and maintains almost 100% retention after 10,000 cycles [29]. Therefore, we believe that introducing phosphorus heteroatom with lower electronegativity (2.19) can develop a higher capacitance MXene electrode by trimming the electron donor capability, and modifying the surface electrical and chemical properties. In addition, P heteroatom doping is considered an effective and convenient modification strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of carbon materials [30,31]. Although there are several reported works in regard to P doping MXene in supercapacitors, the doping effect is not ideal and the underlying doping mechanism, especially the doping positions/configurations, and their effect on capacitance enhancement are still unexplored. Inspired by the above motivation, in this work, a phosphorus doping strategy (hightemperature heat treatment with NaH2PO2 as the phosphorus source) was employed to obtain the electrode material of supercapacitor (P\u2013Ti3C2Tx) with high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic performance. Morphology and component characterization, DFT calculation, and electrochemical kinetic analysis have been used to give deep insight into the mechanism of improvement in electrochemical performance. As revealed, P doping improved electrical conductivity and reduced the free energy of H+ diffusion on the MXene surface. Meanwhile, the intercalated ions acted as \u201cpillars\u201d to expand the interlayer space of MXene, which is conducive to electrolyte ion diffusion. Moreover, the adopted high-temperature heat treatment in the P doping strategy replaced \u2013F terminations with O-containing groups, which enhances the hydrophilicity and provides sufficient electrochemical active sites for H+. Synergistic modification of interlayer structure and chemical state improves the possibility of Ti3C2Tx for accommodating more H+ ions, further enhancing the capacitance of Ti3C2Tx."

The smooth and thin P\u2013Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are observed in the TEM image (Figure 1c), further indicating the maintenance of a lamellar structure. Moreover, a high-resolution transmittance electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx (Figure 1c insert) shows a hexagonal structure demonstrated by different grain orientations with 60\u25e6 angles and lattice fringes of 0.26 nm which is attributed to the (100) lattice planes of the Ti3C2Tx. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were used to investigate the change in the surface chemical state of Ti3C2Tx upon P doping (Figure 1d), which indicates the presence of several common peaks belonging to Ti3C2Tx MXene, such as Ti\u2013C (~555 cm\u22121), Ti\u2013F (~800 cm\u22121), C\u2013O/C=O (~1640 cm\u22121) and \u2013OH (~3440 cm\u22121) in the range of 400\u20134000 cm\u22121 [32\u201334]. Notably, the new peak in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx appearing near 1120 cm\u22121 corresponds to the P\u2013O bond, which suggests that P atoms are successfully doped in Ti3C2Tx [26]. In addition, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum and element mapping images display the presence and uniform distribution of Ti, C, O, and P elements in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx (Figure 1e,f), testifying that P atoms are successfully doped, which match well with the result of FTIR analysis.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\n2.

The smooth a d thi P\u2013Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are observed in the TEM image (Figure 1c), further ind ating the maintenance of a lamellar structure. Moreover, a hig -resolution transmittanc electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx (Figure 1c insert) shows a hexagonal structure demonstrated by different grain orientations with 60\u00b0 angles and lattice fringes of 0.26 nm which is attributed to the (100) lattice planes of the Ti3C2Tx. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were used to investigate the change in the surface chemical state of Ti3C2Tx upon P doping (Figure 1d), which indicates the presence of several common peaks belonging to Ti3C2Tx MXene, such as Ti\u2013C (~555 cm\u22121), Ti\u2013F (~800 cm\u22121), C\u2013O/C=O (~1640 cm\u22121) and \u2013OH (~3440 cm\u22121) in the range of 400\u20134000 cm\u22121 [32\u201334]. Notably, the new peak in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx appearing near 1120 cm\u22121 corresponds to the P\u2013O bond, which suggests that P atoms are successfully doped in Ti3C2Tx [26]. In addition, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum and element mapping images display the presence and uniform distrib tion of Ti, C, O, and P elements in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx (Figure 1e,f), testifying that P atoms are successfully doped, which match well with the result of FTIR analysis.\nFigure 1.

As shown in Figure 2a, the characteristic (002) peak of Ti3C2Tx shifted to a lower angle after the introduction of the P atom. According to the Bragg equation, the lattice spacing changes from 1.25 nm to 1.30 nm and 1.55 nm. The corresponding HRTEM images of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx (Figure 2b) also exhibit characteristic lattice fringe spaces of 1.55 nm of (002\u2032) and 1.30 nm of (002), which match well with the XRD results. The expansion of interlayer space should attribute to the successful insertion of\nNa+ and H2PO2\u2212 in the layers of Ti3C2 during the ultrasonic treatment, which also leads to the P\u2013Ti3C2Tx exhibiting a larger BET specific surface area than pristine Ti3C2Tx (Table S1). To exclude that the expansion of interlayer spacing is due to the annealing treatment, the XRD pattern of Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx under the same conditions without NaH2PO2\u00b7H2O was also conducted. As shown in Figure S3, the (002) peak of Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx moved to the right, indicating the expansion of interlayer spacing is not caused by heat treatment. The larger interlayer spacing and specific surface area favor undoubtedly the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions and provide enough space to accommodate more electrolyte ions. Moreover, we noted that the characteristic peaks of TiO2 (PDF# 21-1272) appear in Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx, and the TiO2 with lower conductivity losses partial pseudocapacitance of the Ti3C2Tx (Figure S3). Fortunately, due to the reductive nature of NaH2PO2, MXene is not oxidized in the P doping process. In addition, the (002) peak of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx also splits into two peaks (002 and 002\u2032) as shown in Figure 2a. Here, we presume that the split-up of the (002) peak in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx is due to the partial decomposition of the intercalated H2PO2\u2212 during annealing. Na+ and H2PO2\u2212 ions enter MXene interlayers in the ultrasonic process, expanding the interlayer spacing. Then, the partial decomposition of H2PO2\u2212 during annealing makes the enlarged interlayer spacing become smaller. Even so, fortunately, P\u2013Ti3C2Tx still keeps larger interlayer spacing compared with that of pristine Ti3C2Tx. Figure 2c illustrates the structure evolution of Ti3C2Tx during the preparation of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx and the phenomenon of (002) peak splitting. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were then initiated to further investigate the change in component and valence states of Ti3C2Tx MXene on P doping. The full XPS spectra of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx shown in Figure 2d reveal that they all possess Ti, C, O, and F elements. Notably, the P peak appears in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx, which proves the successful introduction of P atoms. The P atom is less electronegative and easily shares electrons with electrolyte ions (H+), which is beneficial to charge storage. Moreover, the intensity of the F 1s peak decreased whereas the intensity of the O 1s peak increased after doping, suggesting that part of the fluorine group was detached from the surface of Ti3C2Tx and replaced with oxygen-containing functional groups during the annealing treatment. This is consistent with the previous study that \u2013F is unstable and \u2013O is more stable [35]. The detailed change in atomic ratio of various elements in MXene is displayed in Figure 2e where after implementing the P doping strategy, the O atom content increased from 29.05% to 41.47%, and the F atom content decreased from 12.56% to 5.47%. To further confirm the variation in the surface functional groups of MXene, the surface contact angles of water on P\u2013Ti3C2Tx and pristine Ti3C2Tx were tested, respectively. As shown in Figure 2f, the contact angle of water on P\u2013Ti3C2Tx considerably decreased due to the enhancement of the content of O-containing groups, which increases the hydrophilicity of MXene and is conducive to the contact between active sites and electrolyte ions, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance of the electrode. Based on the previously reported electrochemical reaction occurring in Ti3C2Tx MXene [26]: Ti3C2Ox(OH)yFz + \u03b4H\n+ + \u03b4e+ \u2194 Ti3C2Ox\u2212\u03b4(OH)y+\u03b4Fz , we suppose that the reduction in the number of \u2013F functional groups and the increase in O-containing groups would greatly improve the capacitance [4]. High-resolution XPS can better analyze the change in the valence state of various atoms. From high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s (Figure 2g), we can see that the Ti3C2Tx shows two peaks around 282.1 eV and 284.8 eV corresponding to C\u2013Ti and C\u2013C [36], respectively. Interestingly, P\u2013Ti3C2Tx displays an additional C\u2013P bond at 283.0 eV, which possibly is caused by P doping to the exposed edge of Ti3C2Tx [37]. The P 2p spectrum is further studied to analyze the mechanism of P doping (Figure 2h). It can be observed that there is no P peak in the pristine Ti3C2Tx, while in the P\u2013Ti3C2Tx sample, two peaks appear. By Gaussian fitting, the P\u2013C bond and P\u2013O bond can be corresponding at 128.9 eV and 134.2 eV, respectively [26,37]. It means the P dopant can be attached to the surface of Ti3C2Tx by adsorption/substitution. The presence of P\u2013O groups would optimize the redox reaction process due to the lower electronegativity of the P atom. Moreover, the Ti 2p spectra obtained by Gaussian fitting are shown in Figure 2i. The Ti 2p3/2 spectra can be deconvoluted into four configurations, in which the binding energies are assigned to Ti (~455 eV), Ti2+ (~456 eV), Ti3+ (~457.6 eV), and Ti4+ (~459.3 eV) [36]. Furthermore, we can see that the content of the +3 valence state in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx (28.4%) is higher compared with Ti3C2Tx (13.4%). The increase in valence may be due to the transition of the terminal group \u2013F to O-containing groups on the surface of Ti3C2Tx and the introduction of P during annealing treatment. The higher valence can hold more electrons during the discharge process, thus increasing its specific capacitance [8]."

            "text": "To better understand the effect of P doping on the properties of MXene, we conducted theoretical calculations of the electronic structure before and after P doping. A supercell of Ti3C2O2 was constructed as the initial calculated model because O is the dominant functional group after annealing treatment (Figure 3a). Furthermore, according to the atomic ratio of P/Ti in the XPS result and the proportion of P\u2013O and P\u2013C bonds in P 2p spectra (Figure 2e,h), five Ti atoms are substituted by five P atoms, and the other three P atoms are bonded with O atoms directly in the supercell to approximate the P atoms concentration in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx. The constructed structure denoted as P\u2013Ti3C2O2 is shown in Figure 3a. Figure 3b displays the total density of states (TDOS) of P\u2013Ti3C2O2 and Ti3C2O2, respectively. The modulation of electronic configuration and spin polarization leads to the variation of DOS curves of P\u2013Ti3C2O2 for both the up-spin and down-spin states. Both\nTi3C2O2 and P\u2013Ti3C2O2 display non-zero peaks across the Fermi level, which implies they possess zero band gaps. Notably, the P\u2013Ti3C2O2 has higher DOS whether at the valence band (VB) or at the conduction band (CB) across the Fermi level, manifesting that electrons could easily migrate from VB to CB, implying the enhanced electronic conductivity of P\u2013Ti3C2O2. As the partial density of states (PDOS) of P\u2013Ti3C2O2 and Ti3C2O2 shown (Figures 3c and S4), CB of Ti3C2O2 and P\u2013Ti3C2O2 is mainly contributed by Ti 3d, while the VB originates from the hybridization of Ti 3d, C 2p and O 2p. Moreover, the P atom made a considerable contribution to DOS at the Fermi level, leading to P\u2013Ti3C2O2 owning much higher electronic conductivity. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 14\nThe migration and diffusion of electrolyte ion H+ in electrode materials also affect the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. The calculation results based on the DFT of the free energy for hydrogen atoms diffusion on Ti3C2O2 and P\u2013Ti3C2O2 surfaces in different paths are shown in Figure 3d. (Optimization model structures of H diffusion on the surface of P\u2013Ti3C2O2 and Ti3C2O2 and the detailed diffusion process are shown in Figure S5). Surface H prefers to attach to oxygen atoms on the surface of MXene, so the possible path for H diffusion is chosen between the two nearest O sites. For Ti3C2O2, the surface H directly diffuses from one O site to the nearest O site, that is, from site 1 to 2, and the diffusion free energy is 1.28 eV. For P\u2013Ti3C2O2, we choose two possible paths for the diffusion of H on the surface taking into the effect of P doping, i.e., H diffuses from site I to II, or from site II to III. The diffusion free energies for both paths are 0.89 and 0.87 eV, respectively, which is lower than that in Ti3C2O2. The lower diffusion free energy undoubtedly facilitates the diffusion of electrolyte ions on the electrode material surface."

In Figure 4a, the CV curves of all samples display a rectangular shape, showing capacitive behavior, in which P\u2013Ti3C2Tx has a greater current response. Noticeably, a pair of weak peaks in low voltage (around \u22120.15 V) appear in the CV curves of the P\u2013Ti3C2Tx electrode, which may be due to the Faraday reaction caused by the doped P atom because it is less electronegative and prefers to share electrons with H; consequently, it can take part in reaction at relatively low voltages. The specific capacitance at different scan rates calculated by CV curves is shown in Figure 4b. The specific capacitance of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx reached 510 F g\u22121 at 2 mV s\u22121, which is higher than that of most reported similar electrode materials, including P\u2013Ti3C2Tx, N\u2013doped Ti3C2Tx and N, P\u2013doped graphene (Table S2). At the scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121, the CV curve of P\u2013 Ti3C2Tx has no obvious distortion (Figure 4c), and it still delivers a capacitance of 400 F g\u22121 (Figure 4b), capacitance retention maintaining 78% from 2 mV s\u22121 to 100 mV s\u22121, which is higher than 35% of pristine Ti3C2Tx. To eliminate the influence of annealing, Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx was synthesized under the same condition without NaH2PO2. As shown in Figure S6, Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx deliveres a minimum electrochemical response area at the same scan rate, that is, it has the smallest specific capacitance, which may be due to the formation of TiO2 in the annealing treatment process without NaH2PO2 with reductive nature. EIS data can help us investigate the electrical conductivity, charge transfer kinetics, and ion diffusion properties of the electrode. In EIS plots, the high-frequency semicircle diameter is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the diagonal line in the lowfrequency region shows charge storage behavior. As shown in Figure 4d and Table S3, P\u2013Ti3C2Tx possesses lower Rct than pure Ti3C2Tx and a higher value of fractional exponent \u03b1 of constant phase element (CPE), suggesting that P\u2013Ti3C2Tx has a higher electrical conductivity and a more rapid ion diffusion path.

Figure 4e shows that P\u2013Ti3C2Tx possesses a smaller characteristic relaxation time constant of \u03c40 (\u03c40 = f 0\u22121), proving the high-rate performance of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx [38\u201340]. For supercapacitors, the long cycle stability of the electrode is one of the key points, because the specific capacitance of the device over time depends on it. Figure 4f exhibits the extended GCD tests approaching 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g\u22121 for P\u2013Ti3C2Tx. Notably, after 10,000 cycles, P\u2013Ti3C2Tx still remains at 90.2% of initial capacitance, which is higher than that of pristine Ti3C2Tx (81.3%, Figure S7) and its Coulombic efficiency of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx is close to 100% in the whole cycles.

Figure 5a displays the b-values of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx as calculated at different voltages corresponding to the CV curves. It is clear that P\u2013Ti3C2Tx owns higher b values (closed to 1) than pure Ti3C2Tx (closed to 0.5), indicating P\u2013Ti3C2Tx shows a surface-controlled charge storage behavior in the electrochemical processes whereas the electrochemical processes of pristine Ti3C2Tx are dominated by diffusion-controlled charge storage behavior. More specifically, the contribution proportion of the two mechanisms in total capacitance can be quantitatively distinguished at a randomizing scan rate according to the following Formula [42]:\ni (V) = k1\u00b7v + k2\u00b7v1/2\nwhere i (V) corresponds to the current at the specific voltage, v stands for the scan rate, k1\u00b7v and k2\u00b7v1/2 represent the surface capacitive control and the diffusion control, respectively. The results show that the proportion of surface capacitive contribution increases with the increase in scan rates for both electrodes (Figures 5b,c, S8 and S9). Notably, the proportion of the surface capacitive contribution of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx is always larger than that of pure Ti3C2Tx at various scan rates, which is consistent with the b-value analysis results. The high surface capacitance contribution implies that there is a fast ion diffusion in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx, which is\nmainly due to the expanded interlayer spacing and lower diffusion free energy in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx. We can also understand the electrochemical process of P\u2013Ti3C2Tx MXene from the in situ electrochemical EIS results. Figure S10 shows the in situ EIS diagram during the discharge process. In the low-frequency range of Nyquist plots around open circuit potential (\u22120.02 V), the curve is characterized by a diagonal. When the voltage changes from \u22120.02 V to \u22120.06 V, the imaginary part of the impedance rises sharply (almost vertically), indicating that the inserted hydrated cation increases the interlayer spacing, resulting in fast and free ion transport. As the discharge reaction proceeds, the diagonals of the EIS plots are always approximately perpendicular, indicating a uniform and expanded interlayer space exists in P\u2013Ti3C2Tx, which improves ion accessibility to the active site, resulting in high specific energy storage capacity. Here, the decrease in impedance imaginary part value from \u22120.06 V to \u22120.25 V should be attributed to the continuous accumulation of charge.

The change in surface functional groups causes the increase in Ti content of the high valence state with an electrochemical activity that can accommodate more electrons during discharge.

            "text": "In summary, P-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene was prepared by a simple annealing method with NaH2PO2 as phosphorus source, which delivers a high specific capacitance of 510 F g\u22121 and 400 F g\u22121 at the scan rate of 2 mV s\u22121 and 100 mV s\u22121. Morphology and component\ncharacterization, DFT calculation, and electrochemical kinetic analysis have been used to give deep insight into the mechanism of improvement in electrochemical performance. The expansion of interlayer spacing facilitates rapid H+ transport. The increased content of O-containing functional groups and the introduction of P atoms not only increase the hydrophilicity of the electrode material but also bring more active sites. The change in surface functional groups causes the increase in Ti content of the high valence state with a higher electrochemical activity that can accommodate more electrons during discharge. Moreover, the introduction of P improves the electrical conductivity of MXene and reduces the free energy of H+ diffusion on the MXene surface. Synergistic modification of interlayer structure and chemical state improves the possibility of Ti3C2Tx for accommodating more H+ ions. This work opens avenues for the development of other 2D materials in constructing high-energy storage systems by heterogeneous atom doping.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28134892/s1, Figure S1: The Ti3C2Tx MXene was prepared from Ti3AlC2 MAX phase by etching Al layer; Figure S2: (a) SEM image and (b) XRD pattern of Ti3AlC2 MAX phase particles; Figure S3: XRD pattern of Ti3C2Tx, Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx and P\u2013 Ti3C2Tx; Figure S4: PDOS of Ti3C2Tx; Figure S5: Optimization model structures of H diffusion on the surface of (a) P\u2013Ti3C2O2 and (b) Ti3C2O2 and the detailed diffusion process; Figure S6: CV profiles of (a) Ti3C2Tx and (b) Ar\u2013Ti3C2Tx.
