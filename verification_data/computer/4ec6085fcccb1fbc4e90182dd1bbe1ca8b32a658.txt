"Nonetheless, there remains room for improvement. Although we have assembled a singable lyrics dataset, aligned across English, Japanese, and Korean, our dataset has some limitations; it lacks musical information and its volume is limited. As a result, we have not been able to incorporate musical notes into our experiment or conduct comparative studies across various genres. We recognize that an ideal lyric translation evaluation system should take into account the relationship between musical notes and phonemes, as well as adapt to different genres. Moreover, although we have endeavored to incorporate cultural understandings of poetry in different languages, we acknowledge the need for deeper cultural considerations."
