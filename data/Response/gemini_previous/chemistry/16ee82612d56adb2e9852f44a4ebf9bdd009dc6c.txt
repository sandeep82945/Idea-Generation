1. **Investigate the effects of other naturally occurring oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids on mitochondrial function.** The study only examined five oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids, but there are many others that have not been studied. It would be interesting to see if these other compounds also have protective effects on mitochondria.


2. **Determine the molecular mechanisms by which oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids protect mitochondria.** The study did not investigate the molecular mechanisms by which oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids protect mitochondria. Future studies could use techniques such as gene expression profiling and proteomics to identify the genes and proteins that are involved in this process.


3. **Evaluate the effects of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids on mitochondrial function in vivo.** The study only examined the effects of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids on mitochondrial function in vitro. It would be important to evaluate the effects of these compounds in vivo to see if they have similar effects in a living organism.


4. **Investigate the potential therapeutic applications of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids for mitochondrial diseases.** The study found that oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids can protect mitochondria from damage. This suggests that these compounds may have therapeutic potential for mitochondrial diseases. Future studies could investigate the effects of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids in animal models of mitochondrial diseases.


5. **Develop new oxyprenylated phenylpropanoid-based drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.** If oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids are found to be effective in treating mitochondrial diseases in animal models, the next step would be to develop new drugs based on these compounds. These drugs could be used to treat a variety of mitochondrial diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer.
