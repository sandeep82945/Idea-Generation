    "abstractText": "The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) mediates viral entry into host CD4+ T cells and is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that target gp120 V3-glycan of HIV-1 Env trimer are potent and block the entry of diverse HIV-1 strains. Most V3-glycan bnAbs interact, to a different extent, with a glycan attached to N332 but Asn at this position is not absolutely conserved or required for HIV-1 entry based on prevalence of N332 in different circulating HIV-1 strains from diverse clades. Here, we studied the effects of amino acid changes at position 332 of HIV-1AD8 Envs on HIV-1 sensitivity to antibodies, cold exposure, and soluble CD4. We further investigated how these changes affect Env function and HIV-1 infectivity in vitro. Our results suggest robust tolerability of HIV-1 AD8 Env N332 to changes with specific changes that resulted in extended exposure of gp120 V3 loop, which is typically concealed in most primary HIV-1 isolates. Viral evolution leading to Asn at position 332 of HIVAD8 Envs is supported by the selection advantage of high levels of cell-cell fusion, transmission, and infectivity even though cell surface expression levels are lower than most N332 variants. Thus, tolerance of HIV-1AD8 Envs to different amino acids at position 332 provides increased flexibility to respond to changing conditions/environments and to evade the immune system. Modeling studies of the distance between N332 glycan and specific bnAbs was in agreement with N332 glycan dependency on bnAb neutralization. Overall, our studies provide insights into the contribution of specific amino acids at position 332 to Env antigenicity, stability on ice, and conformational states. .

We further investigated how these changes\naffect Env function and HIV-1 infectivity in vitro. Our results suggest robust tolerability of HIV-1 AD8 Env N332 to changes with specific changes that resulted in extended exposure of gp120 V3 loop, which is typically concealed\nin most primary HIV-1 isolates. Viral evolution leading to Asn at position 332 of HIVAD8 Envs is supported by the selection advantage of high levels of cell-cell fusion, transmission, and infectivity even though cell surface\nexpression levels are lower than most N332 variants. Thus, tolerance of HIV-1AD8 Envs to different amino acids at position 332 provides increased flexibility to respond to changing conditions/environments and to evade the\nimmune system. Modeling studies of the distance between N332 glycan and specific bnAbs was in agreement\nwith N332 glycan dependency on bnAb neutralization.

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) continues to be a major global public health concern with an\nestimated 39 million people who currently live with HIV (PLWH) worldwide, and over 40 million deaths since the\nbeginning of the HIV-1 pandemic. There is currently no cure for HIV-1 infection but increased access to\nantiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to improved outcome for PLWH, with ~80% of patients who are treated with\nART showing no detectable viremia (https://www.who.int/). Nevertheless, ART targets viral proteins and cannot\neradicate the viral reservoir that contains long-lived cells harboring integrated, replication-competent HIV-1\nprovirus. Integrated HIV-1 provirus in latent cells is presumably transcriptionally silent but can replenish the viral\npopulations upon treatment discontinuation (1, 2). Some studies documented temporarily or sporadically low-\nlevel viral replication (3, 4). Thus, there is a real need to develop an effective HIV-1 vaccine and cure strategies\nin order to significantly change the course of the HIV-1 pandemic.\nHIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) mediate viral entry into host cells and are the sole target of neutralizing\nantibodies. On the surface of virions, HIV-1 Envs are assembled into trimers of three subunits, each containing\ngp120 noncovalently associated with gp41, which anchors the Env trimer to the viral membrane (5). Env\ninteractions with the CD4 receptor lead to structural rearrangements, which reposition the V1/V2 and V3 variable\nloops of gp120. Movements of these elements outwards lead to Env transitions to an open conformation that\nexposes the gp120 co-receptor binding region and exposes/forms the gp41 heptad repeat 1 coil on Env surface\n(5\u20137). Subsequent binding to CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor facilitates further steps during viral entry that\nculminate in gp41-mediated fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (8\u201310).\nBroadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 target highly conserved regions of HIV-1 Envs and block\nviral entry (11\u201317). At least 5 sites of Env vulnerability have been identified by binding and neutralization activities\nof different bnAbs (Fig. 1). Vulnerable Env sites include: 1) the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), 2) the V1/V2 loop at\nthe trimer apex, 3) the V3-glycan 4) the gp120-gp41 interface, and 5) the membrane-proximal external region\n(MPER) of gp41. Robust elicitation of bnAbs by vaccination has been extremely challenging but significant\nprogress in understanding the requirements and/or route for such an immune response has been made over the\nyears (18\u201323). Nevertheless, despite broad anti-viral activity of bnAbs, HIV-1 Envs evolved diverse mechanisms\nto escape bnAb neutralization, including conformational dynamics, conformational masking, enhanced cell-to-\ncell transmission, robustness - which allows HIV-1 Envs to tolerate amino acid changes while maintaining viral\nentry compatibility - and extensive and alternative glycosylation patterns that protect the underlying protein\nsurface from antibody recognition (24\u201333).\nGlycans are typically added to eukaryotic proteins in an ordered pattern that involves co-translational addition of\na lipid-linked glycosylated oligomannose precursor, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, to asparagine residues at potential Nlinked glycosylation sites (PNGs). These sites are defined by the Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon, where \u201cX\u201d can be any\namino acid except proline (34). After further trimming and processing, eukaryotic glycoproteins may have three\ngeneral N-glycan types: oligomannose, complex, and hybrid. HIV-1 Envs contain about 75 PNGs and high\ndensity of glycans accounts for ~50% of the trimer mass (34, 35). The high density of PNGs leads to high\nproportions of glycans that are under processed resulting in high mannose Man5-9GlcNAc2 glycans that are concentrated in two main regions of HIV-1 Envs: Trimer Associated Mannose Patch (TAMP), and an Intrinsic\nMannose Patch (IMP) (Fig. 1) (35, 36). TAMP contains residues N156 and N160 and is formed at the trimer apex\nwhen the three gp120 protomers are associated. In contrast, the IMP is primarily mapped to gp120 outer domain\nand contains the N332 supersite, which is conserved in 73% of ~30,000 cross-clade Env sequences (HIResist\ndatabase: https://hiresist.umn.edu/; Milind et al. manuscript under review). Although a typical antibody response\nof humans to foreign antigens is mainly directed against proteins, bnAbs against gp120 V3-glycan can be\ndeveloped in some PLWH after a long period of infection. V3-glycan bnAbs from PLWH target the IMP glycans,\nwith a specific dependency on the glycan at position N332 for most of them. Structural studies suggest that the\nN332 glycan is relatively rigid and the dense cluster of neighboring glycans forms an antigenically conserved\nregion. Several studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 often evades N332-directed antibodies by introducing an\namino acid change at residue 332 and/or at the related glycosylation sequon. Some V3-glycan bnAbs, such as\nFigure 1. HIV-1 Env vulnerability and dominant glycosylation sites. a, Different sites of Env vulnerability defined by bnAb-Env interactions. The gp120 V1/V2 loop, gp120 V3 glycan, and gp120/gp41 interface sites were identified by HIResist (https://hiresist.umn.edu/) using data sourced from CATNAP (Los Alamos National Laboratory). Residues that form the CD4 binding site were labeled according to Kwong et. al., Nature 1998. gp120/gp41 interface was identified by the \u201cprotein-protein interface\u201d residue selection tool of Maestro (Schrodinger Suite v21). b, HIV-1 Env trimer contains two patches of high mannose, under-processed glycans: Trimer Associated Mannose Patch (TAMP; light blue) and Intrinsic Mannose Patch (IMP; yellow-orange). Glycans on TAMP are added when three gp120 protomers are associated (Moyo et. al., Expert Opin Ther Targets 2021), whereas IMP glycans are located on the gp120 outer domain and can be added at any stage. The TAMP and IMP regions were labeled according to Behrens et. al., 2019. Both the structures were generated using Chimera X and PDB: 8FAD.\na\nb\nFigure 2.

For Envs of several HIV-1 strains, neutralization by 10-1074 bnAb may be highly dependent on N332\nglycans. Thus, V3-glycan bnAbs differ in their ability to recognize the N332 supersite and, notably, polyclonal\nV3-glycan targeting bnAbs can arise in a single individual and antibodies from different donors may utilize\ndifferent modes of recognition (38).\nHere, we used the well-studied and highly expressed HIV-1AD8 Envs to investigate how changes in residue 332 affect viral fitness, infectivity, and Env function using a variety of assays. We replaced the N332 with all possible\n19 amino acids and studied the sensitivity of these variants to bnAbs, ligands preferring open Env conformation\nsuch as soluble CD4, and cold, as well as their fusion capacity, and infectivity. Our results provide insights into\nthe relationship between Env function, viral fitness cost, and resistance to V3-glycan bnAbs."

            "text": "We analyzed the amino acid distribution at position 332 of HIV-1 Env from available viral strains of different\nclades (Fig. 2) and identified Asn as the most frequent amino acid at this position for most but not all clades.\nAmino acids other than Asn at position 332 were frequently found in HIV-1 Envs from strains of clade AE that\ncontained mostly the Glu amino acid at this position, whereas stains of clade F2 contained either Thr or Asn at\ncomparable frequencies at this position. Except for clade A1 strains, all clades contained at least 14% strains\nwith an amino acid other than Asn at position 332, suggesting that HIV-1 Envs can tolerate, to some extent,\ndifferent changes at this site. Thus, to study the contribution of N332 glycan to viral activities, fitness, and\nresistance to bnAbs targeting the V3-glycan, we introduced amino acid changes in HIV-1AD8 Envs to substitute Asn 332 with alternative amino acids. We chose the HIV-1AD8 Envs for this study since these Envs are highly expressed, have been extensively investigated in multiple studies, and are typically used to infect non-human primates in a model of HIV-1 infection (39, 40). We used the highly sensitive Cf2-Th/CD4+CCR5+ target cells and\ndetected high infectivity of all HIV-1AD8 mutants except for N332P. Notably, among the natural HIV-1 strains that circulate in the viral population, the prevalence of N332P variant was documented in only 0.06% of clade C\nstrains. This observation suggests that N332P change is either not well tolerated or subject to strong immune\npressure within the context of the viral population.\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of HIV-1AD8 Env variants to the following V3-targeting bnAbs: PGT121, PGT126, PGT128, 10-1074, and 2G12 and compared their sensitivity to the susceptibility of wild type (N332) HIV-1AD8 Envs (Figs. 3 and 4). Modeling of the introduced amino acids in the context of HIV-1AD8 Envs suggested that none of these amino acids had significant clashes with neighboring residues (Fig. 4a). We detected different\npatterns of sensitivity of the AD8 Env variants to the V3-glycan bnAbs. PGT bnAbs and 10-1074 exhibited high\npotency against WT HIV-1AD8 Envs with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 \u00b5g/ml to 0.06 \u00b5g/ml and they all were less\neffective against the AD8 variants, but the level of HIV-1 resistance varied substantially among the different\nbnAbs. PGT121 and PGT128 still neutralized the AD8 variants but at IC50 values that were approximately 2-120- fold higher than the AD8 WT IC50 (except for N332C that was completely resistant to PGT128; Fig. 4b and c). In\ncontrast, PGT126 and 10-1074 lost most neutralization activity when tested up to 10 \u00b5g/ml against the different\nAD8 variants. Similarly, 2G12, which only weakly inhibited WT AD8 entry, lost any neutralization activity at or\nbelow 10 \u00b5g/ml against all AD8 variants. Overall, we detected resistance of all AD8 variants to the V3-glycan\nbnAbs that varied among the different bnAbs, suggesting that the five V3 targeting glycan bnAbs utilize a diverse\nmode of binding to the glycan attached to Asn 332. Specifically, 10-1074 and PGT126 rely heavily on the glycan\ncompared to PGT121 and PGT128, which could recognize, to a different extent, the different AD8 variants.\nNotably, PGT121 exhibited the lowest dependency on Asn at position 332 of HIV-1AD8 Envs, maintaining IC50 <\n1 \u00b5g/ml against all HIV-1AD8 Env variants and exhibiting the highest resistance to the changes N322L, N332Y, and N332E. This observation is consistent with the potential ability of PGT121 to exhibit promiscuous\ncarbohydrate interactions, recognizing both complex-type N-glycans and high mannose (37). Nevertheless,\nN332 glycan dependency may vary between diverse HIV-1 strains as the change N332A in HIV-1JR-CSF Envs was reported to abolish any detectable neutralization activity of PGT121 while this change exhibited only 1.4-\nfold increase in HIV-1JR-CSF resistance to PGT128 (41).\nViruses can infect target cells by diverse pathways and some viruses enter target cells via the endosome where\nlow pH triggers the fusion of viral and cell membranes (42, 43). In contrast, HIV-1 enters target cells by fusion\nwith the plasma membrane at neutral pH, and therefore, HIV-1 Envs evolved to facilitate 2 separate activities:\nreceptor binding and membrane fusion, which are triggered only by receptor/coreceptor binding. Ordered and\nsequential steps during HIV-1 entry are coordinated by metastability of the Env trimer, which is assembled during\nsynthesis into a ready-to-trigger trimer that adopts a high-energy metastable conformation (stable for a limited\nFigure 3.

As a result of Env metastability, some\nchanges in Env residues can exhibit allosteric effects, alter Env conformation and facilitate the exposure of\ninternal Env regions, which are typically concealed in the Envs of most primary strains (6, 44, 45). To evaluate\nsuch potential changes, we next studied how different amino acid changes at position 332 affect Env sensitivity\nFigure 4.

These Env ligands/conditions have been previously associated with Envs that undergo local or global\nconformational changes and typically exhibit more open Env conformations. Overall, all AD8 variants, as well as\nAD8 WT, exhibited high sensitivity to sCD4 with IC50 values that ranged from 0.01 \u03bcM to 0.04 \u03bcM. Envs with negatively and positively charged amino acid substitutions at position 332 resulted in slightly more sensitive\nviruses when they were pseuotyped with these Env variants. As residue 332 is relatively distant from the CD4bs,\nthese observations suggest that Env changes in this residue did not significantly alter the CD4bs (Fig 5). Most\namino acid changes at position 332 of Envs resulted in a moderate increase of 19b sensitivity compared with\nthe WT HIV-1AD8 Env sensitivity. Unexpectedly, WT HIV-1AD8 Envs were sensitive to exposure to cold, which is associated with incompletely closed / partially open / open Env conformations, but all N332 variants except\nN332G exhibited even higher sensitivity than WT HIV-1AD8 Envs to cold exposure. Thus, at least for HIV-1AD8 Envs, maintaining the Asn at position 332 was beneficial for limiting the exposure of gp120 V3 loop, which is the\ntarget for antibodies developed in PLWH, and for protecting Env elements that are sensitive to cold.\nTo evaluate the effects of amino acid changes at position 332 on HIV-1AD8 Env function, we next studied different properties related to the biological activity of HIV-1 Envs (Fig. 6). We assessed the ability of HIV-1 Env variants\nto mediate cell-cell fusion activity using the well-established HIV-1 Tat reporter system. This assay monitors the\nfusion of transfected 293T cells coexpressing HIV-1 Tat and Envs with the TZM-bl reporter cells. Except for the\nN332P, which was poorly infectious, the ability of all other AD8 N332 variants to mediate cell-cell fusion during\na 9-hour incubation was comparable to WT AD8. Nevertheless, the phenotype of the N332G, N332H and N332S\nvariants suggested a slightly delayed kinetics of fusion with low fusion during the first 3 hours of the assay\ncompared to WT AD8. We did not detect significant differences in cell-cell fusion activity between the diverse\ngroups of amino acid substitutions. To investigate the ability of different HIV-1AD8 Env variants to mediate the complete entry process, we measured the p24 levels of pseudoviruses displaying the different Env variants,\nwhich represents the number of viral particles in the preparation and compared the infectivity of each Env variant at defined p24 levels (Fig. 6). All variants except for the N332P showed high levels of Cf2-Th/CD4+CCR5+\ninfection that were comparable to the WT HIV-1AD8 Envs. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the diverse groups of amino acids, but the polar amino acid substitutions were slightly less infectious\nfor a defined number of virions (according to p24 levels). As a result, the values of viral infectivity at defined p24\nlevels of all polar amino acid substitutions were shifted and associated with higher p24 levels relative to the WT\nAD8 Envs (Fig. 6b). We measured the levels of expression of each Env variant on 293T cells using flow\ncytometry. Unexpectedly, we detected lower levels of WT HIV-1AD8 Envs compared to other variants except for N332P and N332G. This pattern was first detected by the N6 bnAb, which is very potent and recognizes different\nEnv conformations (29), and further confirmed by PGT121, which is highly potent and neutralized all AD8 N332x\nvariants (Fig. 4). We have recently developed an ultrasensitive method to detect transmission of HIV-1 between\nT cells (CEM to SupT1 cells). The assay uses a reporter lentivector that detects viral transmission in the coculture\nof viral- producing cells and target cells (31). Reporter protein expression is blocked until HIV-1 completes\nreverse transcription in target cells, allowing to distinguish between viral-producing cells and target cells to which\nHIV-1 was transmitted. Using this method, we detected overall high levels of cell-cell transmission between T\ncells of most variants. Notably, the variations between different members of the same amino acid group were\nhighest among the non-polar amino acid substitutions. Within this group, the HIV-1AD8 N332F Env variant exhibited 1.9-fold more efficient cell-cell transmission than the HIV-1AD8 N332L Env variant. In summary, WT HIV-1AD8 Envs were expressed at lower levels than most variants but maintained comparable cell-cell fusion and transmission activities as well as exhibited comparable or higher viral infectivity.\nCorrelation analysis of the different parameters that were tested in this study showed a positive correlation\nbetween the sensitivity of variants to 1) cold and sCD4, and 2) cold and 19b (Fig. 7). 10-1074 and 2G12 bnAbs\nexhibited poor neutralization activities (IC50 > 10 \u00b5g/ml) against most variants that excluded them from the correlation analysis. Notably, sensitivity of the N332x variants to PGT128 bnAb inversely correlated with their\nsensitivity to cold, suggesting that higher binding affinity to the PGT128 epitope reflects an Env architecture that\nwas better protected from cold.\nHere we investigated the diverse effects of amino acid changes at position 332 on the sensitivity of HIV-1AD8 Envs to different ligands and cold as well as on the ability of N332x variants of HIV-1AD8 Env to mediate viral entry, transmit between T cells, and infect target cells. Most amino acid changes were well-tolerated and the\nrelated HIVAD8 mutants exhibited high levels of expression, high cell-cell fusion, and high infectivity in vitro. Viral evolution of Asn at position 332 of HIVAD8 Envs is supported by the advantage of high levels of cell-cell fusion,\ntransmission and infectivity even when the cell surface expression levels were lower than most N332x variants.\nMoreover, most N332x changes increased Env sensitivity to 19b and exposure to cold, suggesting that N332\nWT could protect HIV-1 Env from some ligands and/or extreme environmental conditions. Nevertheless, our\nstudy points to high robustness of Env function associated with most of the N332x changes. Thus, tolerance of\nHIV-1AD8 Envs to different amino acids at position 332 can provide increased flexibility to respond to changing conditions/environments.\nThe different pattern of sensitivity to the V3-glycan bnAbs indicated diverse dependency in the N332 glycan and\npotentially different antibody approach to the V3-glycan epitope. To obtain additional insights into the binding\nmode of the different V3-glycan bnAbs to their epitope, we modeled bnAb binding using an available cryo-EM\nstructure of the full-length HIV-1AD8 Envs (46). We superimposed HIV-1AD8 Env structure on available structures\nFigure 7. Bi-variable relationship between sensitivities of HIV-1AD8 N332x Env variants to multiple ligands and cold exposure.

Distances between PGT121, PGT128, and 10-1074\nand N332 glycan were consistent with our results of\nbnAb neutralization dependency on N332 glycan (Figs.\n3 and 4). PGT121 showed the lowest dependency and\neffectively neutralized all the N332 variants (although\nthese variants were less efficiently neutralized than WT\nN332) and it was also the most distant from N332\nglycan among the three bnAbs in this model. In\ncontrast, 10-1074 showed poor neutralization activity\nin the absence of N332 glycan and it was positioned in\nclose proximity to the N332 glycan in our model (Fig.\n8). Of note, dose-response curve of HIVAD8 WT to increasing 10-1074 concentrations showed complete\nneutralization at high concentration of 10-1074,\nsuggesting that the addition of N332 glycan is\nhomogenous among all pseudoviruses produced in\n293T cells. HIVAD8 WT was relatively resistant to the 2G12 antibody, and most variants were completely\nresistant to this antibody up to 10 \u00b5g/ml; this\nobservation complicated any conclusion for the\ndistance dependency of 2G12.\nThe prevalence of HIV-1 strains lacking N332 among circulating strains of HIV-1 suggests that the glycan at this\nposition is not absolutely necessary for HIV-1 Env function or for HIV-1 replication. Of note, some transmitted /\nfounder HIV-1 strains, which can establish HIV-1 infection in vivo, lack N332 glycan and have been previously\nidentified and isolated (e.g., BG505). Nevertheless, most HIV-1 strains do contain Asn at position 332. One\npotential explanation for this pattern of distribution may be temporal and alternative adaptability of HIV-1 Env to\nV3-glycan bnAbs and antibodies typically present in patient serum (Kshitij Wagh personal communication). Thus,\nswitching between different amino acids can confer resistance against different types of antibodies at different\ntime points during HIV-1 infection. Notably, changes of Asn to some charged amino acids as well as to Tyr and\nPhe resulted in significant exposure of the gp120 V3 loop of HIV-1AD8 Env (clade B) according to the sensitivity of these variants to the internal-epitope antibody 19b, which targets the gp120 V3 loop (Fig. 5). Consistent with\nthis observation, the prevalence of these changes in the viral population of Clade B HIV-1 strains is low (Fig. 2).\nOur study provides insights into the role of amino acids at position 332 of HIV-1 Envs and the effects of different\nchanges on HIV-1 fitness and sensitivity to antibodies.\nFigure 8. Molecular modeling of potential interactions of different V3-glycan targeting bnAbs with HIV-1AD8 Envs. a, We used available structures of different V3-glycan bnAbs in complex with BG505 SOSIP.665 (PDBs: 5ACO, 6OCZ, 6UDJ, and 7UOJ) to evaluate of the interactions of these bnAbs with the IMP region of HIV-1AD8 Env. We superimposed HIV-1AD8 Env structure (PDB 8FAD) with the bnAbBG505 SOSIP complex structures using using Chimera X matchmaker tool and then removed the BG505 SOSIP structure. 2G12 complex included 2 Fab and one of these was removed for clarity. b, Modeling the HIV-1AD8 Env and N322 interactions with V3-glycan bnAbs.
