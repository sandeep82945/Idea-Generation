    "abstractText": "The impact of drama therapy on mental health recovery remains poorly understood. We examined the effects of a pilot remote drama therapy program for community members living with serious mental illness. The entire intervention was delivered remotely. Participants with serious mental illness completed a 12-week drama therapy program which included an online performance open to the public. Four quantitative scales were administered preand post-program. A focus group was conducted 1 week after the performance. Six participants completed the program and crafted a public performance themed around hope. No significant differences were identified in the quantitative measures. Five themes were identified in the postperformance focus group. Drama therapy presents an opportunity for individuals with serious mental illness to process and share their journeys with their diagnoses and re-create a healthy sense of self with increased community awareness.",

            "text": "Serious mental illness (SMI) describes psychiatric conditions that cause significant functional impairment. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, severe bipolar disorder, and severe major depressive disorder fall under this umbrella. Recent data estimates that 5.2% (13.1 million people) of adults in the U.S. live with SMI (SAMHSA, 2020). Current treatment plans for SMI incorporate pharmacotherapy with psychosocial interventions including cognitive-behavioral therapy and vocational rehabilitation (Elliott, 2016). However, suboptimal integrated care results in increased hospitalizations related to more severe physical illnesses and poor treatment compliance (Cramer & Rosenheck, 1998; Wetzler et\u00a0al., 2020). Care coordination is critical for improving clinical outcomes in this population and mental health\nprofessionals are increasingly turning toward other treatment modalities to improve symptoms and social functioning.\nCreative arts therapy is a promising type of psychosocial intervention for SMI. The utilization of creative arts therapy to treat SMI is growing in popularity but consists of highly variable studies using heterogeneous methods to deliver creative modalities including art, music, dance, and drama therapy (Chiang et\u00a0al., 2019; Ruddy & Milnes, 2003). Notably, the therapeutic goals of drama therapy appear well-suited to promote recovery from SMI which is associated with significant societal stigma and poor quality of life (Corrigan & Watson, 2002; Dong et\u00a0al., 2019; IsHak et\u00a0al., 2015; Michalak et\u00a0al., 2005). Drama therapy offers a creative approach to facilitate cathartic expression and personal growth. Through the use of theater processes such as improvisation, embodiment, and performance, participants can explore ways to create intimate and transformative spaces and tap into innate qualities that they can outwardly express (Emunah, 2019). Drama therapy implemented for high-risk college students, notably those who experienced a major stressor in their lives, participating in a counseling group resulted in increased self-awareness related to the ability to manifest inner feelings which were previously difficult to express aloud (Chang et\u00a0al., 2019). Individuals with schizophrenia who participated in drama therapy demonstrated improvement * Xiaoduo Fan xiaoduo.fan@umassmed.edu 1 UMass Memorial Health/UMass Chan Medical School, 55 N Lake Ave, Worcester, MA\u00a001655, USA 2 Lesley University, 29 Everett St, Cambridge, MA\u00a002138, USA\n3 UMass Memorial Health/UMass Chan Medical School, Suite 100, 365 Plantation Street, Worcester, MA\u00a001605, USA\n1 3\nin domains including dramatic development and fluency of speech when compared with those who received standard inpatient care (Nitsun et\u00a0al., 1974). Different modes of verbal and nonverbal expression presented through drama therapy has the potential to overcome communication challenges among people with SMI, particularly those who have speech deficits due to blunted affect and poverty of speech (Cohen et\u00a0al., 2014). Moreover, the action-oriented process of drama therapy aims to integrate emotional and physical sensations and promote storytelling.\nOne salient form of drama therapy is therapeutic theater, which uses the process of intentional performance to promote transformation. The Co-active Therapeutic Theater (CoATT) model is one type of therapeutic theater that was developed as a specific intervention utilizing concepts within drama therapy to enhance clinical recovery through a personal commitment leading to public performance. By manualizing therapeutic theater, CoATT improves replication and operational use in different settings. Emphasis is placed on the process of active recovery which acknowledges deliberate goals and re-authors narratives about oneself beyond treatment through the use of metaphor and story rather than autobiographical depiction (Wood & Mowers, 2019). The co-active framework embraces the role of drama therapists and community mental health practitioners to collaborate with participants in their journeys toward recovery. As such, this approach allows participants to portray and confront different aspects of themselves in the context of the drama therapy group. CoATT has been used for various populations in recovery including from eating disorders, substance use disorders, aphasia. A study in 2020 demonstrated perceived enhancements in communication skills and self-confidence built through connections developed between individuals with expressive aphasia (Wood et\u00a0al., 2020a). These results suggest that CoATT can be used for individuals with communication disorders and reproduced by other community mental health recovery programs that follow the model\u2019s framework.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed the trajectory of health care delivery and is anticipated to disproportionately burden people with SMI. Increased isolation and reduced access to treatment and community resources may exacerbate symptoms and increase distress (Kozloff et\u00a0al., 2020). Virtual care appointments attended through telepsychiatry and online psychosocial interventions have become mainstream. However, the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions including programs for creative arts therapy delivered remotely continues to be explored (Arnold et\u00a0al., 2020; Knott & Block, 2020; Levy et\u00a0al., 2018; Oddo et\u00a0al., 2021). An in-person pilot drama therapy program was previously conducted to evaluate the impact of therapeutic theater for people with a dual diagnosis of SMI and substance use disorder (Cheung et\u00a0al., 2021). Participants reported advocating\nfor changes in the mental health field, a sense of community among participants with lived experience, and recognizing the importance of external support as positive outcomes of the program. Although meaningful research is beginning to emerge regarding virtual drama therapy and its broad applications and challenges (Feniger-Schaal et\u00a0al., 2022; Pendzik, 2020; Wood et\u00a0al., 2020b), little is known specifically about remote drama therapy for people with SMI."

The study coordinators comprised of psychiatrists, medical students, and research assistants, part of CIP and the drama therapy coordinator at Lesley University. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a drama therapy program for people with SMI.

The entire program was conducted over UMass Chan Medical School\u2019s secure, HIPAA-compliant Zoom video platform.\nCoATT was used as the basis for the program to manualize the drama therapy protocol (Wood & Mowers, 2019). Following this model, the exploratory and rehearsal sessions were divided into seven distinct sections or \u201cmovements\u201d with each movement following the same structure of activities (Table\u00a01). The roles of the drama therapists were to provide a framework for and lead the therapeutic theater exercises of each session and guide the participants toward the creation of a public production delivered online. In parallel, participants engaged in drama therapy tasks to develop their performance skills and express their ideas that shaped their growth in the program and final work. Movement One: Recruitment (week 0) served to identify participants for the program. Participants shared an active recovery process, characterized by their intention to engage in recovery and construct and share a new personal narrative, that was meaningful to them as well as tools and resources they sought to use while participating in the CoATT. Movement Two: Discovery (week 1) was organized around establishing a group contract and theme of recovery with the intent to explore, construct, and communicate a themed production with the community in the public performance. Movement Three: Generation (weeks 2 and 3) engaged the group in a specific series of theatrical improvisation games and drama therapy exercises using metaphor, role, and journal writing\nto explore the selected topic in depth. The homework activity of this movement was of particular importance, as the written words of the participants were used to create the dialogue and finalize the theme for the play. Co-active supervision between the drama therapists leading the sessions focused on a reflection of the roles, emotions, relationships, and metaphors that emerged in the participants\u2019 work and interpersonal dynamics. Movement Four: Performance intensive (week 4) centered around empowerment through acting skills training and the creation of a skeletal script written by the drama therapists composed of the participants\u2019 work. The intensive was delivered over extended sessions: 3\u00a0h, compared with the typical 1.5\u00a0h, over the course of 2\u00a0days. The final activity of the intensive was to read through the script as a cast and discuss how they can take ownership over the narrative of the play through additional textual edits or acting choices. Movement Five: The rehearsal process (weeks 5\u201310) co-actively tasked the drama therapists and participants to produce and rehearse the play. The primary focus of the drama therapists was on directing the play while the participants prioritized ownership of the recovery theme and its presentation as a final product. Any changes to the structure of the play were agreed on by the cast. Rehearsing allowed the cast to actively engage in the creation of the therapeutic theater while simultaneously working on their recovery and imagining the production with the presence of the audience in mind. Movement Six: Public performance (week 11) was open and advertised to the general public to allow the cast to reconnect to the world outside of treatment. Attendance at the exploratory and rehearsal sessions was taken during weeks 1\u201310."

The four quantitative scales were provided by study coordinators who were not involved in the drama therapy program. The TIS is a 20-item self-report scale with a 4-point Likert design to evaluate dimensions including self-esteem and confidence, performing in front of others, creativity, social connecting, and seeing one\u2019s life as full of stories (Moran & Alon, 2011). The BPRS includes 18 symptom items rated on a scale from 1\u20137 to measure psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and unusual behavior (Overall & Gorham, 1962). The Q-LES-QSF consists of 16 items rated on a scale of 1\u20135 to assess quality of life and life satisfaction in a variety of categories such as physical health, mood, and work (Stevanovic, 2011). The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10-item scale on a scale of 0\u20134 used to measure ones perceived level of stress (Cohen et\u00a0al., 1983). One week after the public performance (week 12), all rating scales were administered again to the participants."

During the exploratory and rehearsal sessions, participants engaged in a variety of manualized exercises promoting creative expression. The therapeutic space allowed participants to come together and build trust while focusing on their strengths and vulnerabilities. By participating in the program in a physical setting they found comfortable and convenient, participants faced fewer boundaries to engage in the action-oriented, goal-directed tasks presented by the drama therapists and improve their skills in communication and personal development. Opportunities to reflect on growth and observe changes in oneself and within the dynamic of the group were brought about through the incorporation of action-oriented tasks cumulating in a public performance around a theme selected by the participants (Wood & Mowers, 2019). The performance encouraged participants to enact a shared story of hope and allowed audience members to better understand the participants\u2019 experiences living with SMI.\nStigma among community members and health care professionals can be influenced by the mode of information delivery (Corrigan & Watson, 2002). Drama therapy has been shown to reduce self-stigma of participants with mental illness and public stigma of audience members (Orkibi et\u00a0al., 2014). As a recovery-oriented intervention, drama therapy has the potential to combat poor clinical and functional outcomes among this population (Dubreucq et\u00a0al., 2021). Through co-active participation between cast members and the audience, participants conveyed their complex experiences with SMI through metaphorical interpretations and received live feedback for their performance. This type of interaction allows for active reflection on the community side to better recognize and engage with the impact of the performance.\nResponses from the focus group demonstrated that participants enjoyed the drama therapy process and group-based activities. Notably, building relationships and gaining selfperspective were perceived as important benefits of participating in the program. Previous work using CoATT with individuals with aphasia found similar qualitative themes (Wood et\u00a0al., 2020a). The connections fostered between the participants with SMI supported a sense of solidarity and drive to create a themed story of hope through a safe\nmedium of expression. A recent study investigating the therapeutic effects of drama therapy for women who were victims of intimate partner violence also demonstrated the healing nature of intentional performance and forming bonds through verbal and nonverbal communication (Mondolfi Miguel & Pino-Juste, 2021). Therapeutic theater therefore provides a platform for individuals to work together and enact stories with significant personal meaning. Moreover, the CoATT model offers a unique avenue towards this goal, given it is a manualized process, allowing for the potential of replicated studies.\nThe drama therapy program served to unite participants during times of unprecedented isolation. Social networks were built through shared interests and a desire for community despite ongoing barriers to in-person relationships. Participants expressed preference for the virtual format and were able to successfully write the script and rehearse and showcase the production. Interventions delivered remotely reduce financial and transportation barriers which are often experienced by people with SMI (Spivak et\u00a0al., 2019; Tristiana et\u00a0al., 2018). Challenges named by individuals with SMI participating in research include chronic physical health conditions, difficulties with transportation, and perceived invasiveness of privacy (Kanuch et\u00a0al., 2016; Woodall et\u00a0al., 2010). The ability to physically attend sessions within an intervention appears to be a consistent obstacle which is alleviated by the convenience of telehealth. Optimizing access to such therapies is in line with transformative mental health care which emphasizes maximizing an individual\u2019s ability to function in and be part of their community (Hogan, 2003)."

            "text": "This pilot remote drama therapy study has several limitations. The small sample size reduced our ability to assess the impact of the intervention as demonstrated through the lack of significant changes noted in the quantitative measures. The modest, nonsignificant improvement in the BPRS total score was also observed in a recent pilot study on drama therapy for participants who were dual diagnosed with SMI and substance use disorder (Cheung et\u00a0al., 2021). Further research requires an expansion of the study cohort to detect pre- and post-program differences. This study also lacked a control group to examine the effectiveness of the intervention compared with standard of care treatment. There was a 25% attrition rate with one participant who dropped out citing personal discomfort surrounding the topics discussed during the program. Individuals may join the program with different expectations for their own active recovery which motivate or discourage\n1 3\ntheir continued participation. The CoATT model requires a commitment from those ready to engage in the recovery process which may pose a challenge for people with SMI in ongoing treatment but not active recovery. While webbased delivery of interventions increases convenience and has become commonplace during the ongoing pandemic, technical difficulties remain evident and technological malfunctions as well as poor technological literacy can reduce enthusiasm for participation. Importantly, accessibility and availability of drama therapists remains a significant barrier to implementing drama therapy programs. A model incorporating theater-based interventions into health care delivery will undoubtedly be required to provide such programs to individuals with SMI who face considerable internal and external challenges related to their health and the stigma surrounding their conditions."

            "text": "Our study demonstrates a partnership between two professional fields: drama therapy and psychiatry. This interdisciplinary relationship allows for a mutually beneficial discourse promoting the further development of drama therapy and the incorporation of its principles into the practice of mental health care delivery. While the prevalence of creative arts therapies, particularly related to art and music therapy, within psychiatric settings is established, to date collaboration between drama therapy and psychiatry has been minimal. Manualized drama therapy processes allow for the creation of more creative interventions which can lead to wider coverage of these services through managed health care. Moreover, the use of theatrical processes in drama therapy proposes that collaboration can overlap with theater practice itself to provide a setting for discourse on mental health. Our findings suggest that remote drama therapy confers personal value to group members as participants in active recovery and advocates for mental health awareness and a need for larger-scale studies to evaluate clinically relevant benefits of drama therapy for people with SMI.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Emily Faith and Francesca Jannello for participating as drama therapist facilitators and members of the UMass Psychotic Disorders Program, particularly Kalea Barger, Brianne Calitri, Zachary Wipff, and William-Bernard Reid-Varley, for their technical support and assistance.\nAuthor Contributions AC, LW, and XF contributed to the conception and design of the study.
