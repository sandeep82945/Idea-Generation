The cdc2-like kinases (CLK) are a family of four kinases that have garnered recent interest for their involvement in a diverse set of diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and many cancers. Targeted medicinal chemistry around a CLK inhibitor hit identified through screening of a kinase inhibitor set against a large panel of kinases allowed us to identify a potent and selective inhibitor of CLK1, 2 and 4. Here, we present the synthesis, selectivity, and potential binding site of this compound \u2013 SGC-CLK-1. We further show CLK2 has the highest binding affinity, and high CLK2 expression correlates with a lower IC50 in a screen of multiple cancer cell lines. Finally, we show that SGC-CLK-1 not only reduces serine arginine rich (SR) protein phosphorylation, but also alters SR protein and CLK2 subcellular localization in a reversible way. Therefore, we anticipate that this compound will be a valuable tool for increasing our understanding of CLKs and their targets, SR proteins, at the level of phosphorylation and subcellular localization.\nKeywords: CLK1, CLK2, CLK4, chemical probe, splicing"

            "text": "Kinases are attractive targets for drug discovery, with well documented success stories over the past two decades, and to date over 65 kinase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use by the FDA [1,2]. The utility of kinase inhibitors stems from their intimate involvement in most physiological processes and pathways in healthy cells and tissues, and aberrant signaling through these same kinases, brought about by mutation or overexpression, for example, can lead to disease. One such important biological process regulated by the activity of kinases is pre-mRNA splicing, the process by which premRNAs are processed into mature mRNAs that will be translated into proteins. The splicing process allows for the generation of alternately spliced mRNA variants, leading to the production of different protein products from the same gene [3,4]. Recently, modulators of splicing, including intervention through so-called splicing kinases, have garnered attention for their therapeutic potential [5-7]. Splicing modulators have been suggested as potential therapeutics for human diseases including autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis [8], muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy [9,10], neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s diseases and Parkinson\u2019s disease [11], and various types of cancers [12-20]. Alternate splicing influences numerous cellular processes that are considered to be hallmarks of cancer [21-23], and the body of evidence for the role of the splicing process in tumorigenesis has led to the suggestion of including aberrant alternative splicing as an additional hallmark of cancer [24].\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

CLKs can phosphorylate (p) serine-arginine rich (SR) proteins, and this phosphorylation re-localizes the pSR proteins from their holding area in the nuclear speckles to the spliceosome to dictate exon inclusion/exclusion in the nascent transcript [25-27]. As expected, the four CLK family members are highly homologous, but there are differences in sequence that give rise to functional differences and lead to different compound inhibition profiles across the four CLKs [7,14,28,29].\nAs targeting splicing through splicing modulators has becomes an active and attractive area of research, a growing number of small molecule inhibitors have been created to better understand the CLKs in physiological roles such as splicing, and to investigate the consequences of CLK inhibition in disease-relevant models. CLK inhibitors and the therapeutic potential of CLK inhibition have been reviewed recently [7,14,29]. Several CLK inhibitors have been sufficiently characterized so that they can be considered chemical probes for the CLKs. Table 1 depicts the recent CLK inhibitors that can be used to probe CLK biology, along with examples of CLK inhibitors that have advanced into clinical trials.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

There are also examples of kinase inhibitors initially developed for other enzymes that can act as CLK inhibitors [38-41]. As the CLKs share very similar ATP binding pockets, creating a potent and selective tool molecule for each CLK has proven difficult to date. Nevertheless, there are several ongoing clinical trials currently underway with CLK inhibitors ranging from osteoporosis to neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Supplemental Table 1). Alternate scaffolds with different pharmacological profiles, intrafamily potency profiles, and kinase off-target profiles should prove useful in the quest to find useful CLK inhibitors that can modulate disease phenotypes and serve as precursors for new therapeutics.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

SGC-CLK-1 (CAF-170) has excellent kinome wide selectivity, is a potent inhibitor of CLK1, CLK2, and CLK4, and produces a unique phenotype outside of the normal presumed CLK inhibitor function of simply decreasing SR phosphorylation. At low nanomolar concentrations, we observe that SGC-CLK-1 re-distributes CLK2 and pSRs leading to a decrease in growth of both melanoma and glioblastoma cells. Finally, this relocalization is reversible, which positions SGC-CLK-1 as a useful mechanistic tool for CLK2 function and a scaffold for further optimization.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Results Discovery and characterization of a CLK chemical probe In our original kinase chemogenomic set known as PKIS (Published Kinase Inhibitor Set), we identified GW807982X (CAF-022) as a potent inhibitor of members of the CLK family with good kinome wide selectivity based on screening against a panel of over 200 kinases at NanoSyn. CAF-022 has subsequently been shown to selectively inhibit chemoresistant glioblastoma cells [20]. To further understand the selectivity of this compound we screened it at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M in the Eurofins KINOMEscan\u00ae panel. In this assay format, GW807982X exhibited very good selectivity, with an S10 (1 \u00b5M) = 0.02, indicating that only 2% of the kinases tested had a PoC < 10 at a screening concentration of 1 \u00b5M. In this assay, lower PoC values arise from potent binding to the kinases in question. The kinome wide data is available as Supplemental Table 1. In efforts to further enhance selectivity, we made a series of analogs. We utilized the Luceome KinaseSeeker\u2122 assays to assess the affinity towards CLK1, CLK2, and CLK3. Close analogue CAF-170 (Figure 1a) bound effectively to CLK1 with IC50 = 41 nM and CLK2 with IC50 = 36 nM, but when screened at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M against CLK3 showed no binding at all. CAF170 demonstrated improved kinome-wide selectivity, with S10 (1 \u00b5M) = 0.002 in the KINOMEscan\u00ae assay format (Figure 1b and Supplemental Table 1). CAF-170, renamed as SGC-CLK-1, bound to only six kinases in the KINOMEscan\u00ae panel with a PoC<35: CLK1, CLK2, CLK4, HIPK1, HIPK2, and MAPK15 (also known as ERK8).

CAF-225 was screened in enzymatic assays, and showed no inhibition of CLK1, CLK2, CLK3, CLK4 and a small panel of closely related targets, including the DYRK and HIPK families (Fig 3a, Supplemental Table S2). Finally, the negative control CAF-225 was inactive in the CLK1, CLK2, and CLK4 NanoBRET incell target engagement assays (Figure 3b).\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The van-der-Waals interactions of this residue enable the correct positioning of the heterocycle to form hydrogen bonds with K191 and a structurally conserved water molecule. The importance of these back pocket interactions was confirmed by mutation studies of the V324 residue to alanine which resulted in a reduction the affinity by orders of magnitude [45].

This suggests a lack of strong direct interaction of the ethoxy group but could potentially contribute to the strong selectivity of this compound series for CLK1/2/4. CAF022 forms further typical hydrogen bonds with the hinge via the backbone of L244. The 3-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl engages in van-der-Waals interactions with the p-loop of CLK1 and thus contributing further to the potency of this compound. Interestingly, a chemically similar analog, CAF052, shares key interactions seen with CAF022 in complex with CLK1 (Figure 4b). This compound also shows high affinity towards CLK1 but lacks the selectivity for this protein family. For example, CAF052 has been recently identified as a potent ERK3 kinase binder [46] and the available KINOMEscan\u00ae data of the trifluoromethyl derivative of CAF052, GW779439X [47], confirmed the promiscuous nature of these piperazine derivates. The solvent directed piperazine of CAF052 forms an electrostatic interaction with the carboxylic acid of D250. While the untypically strong back pocket interactions of CAF022 are a key driver of the potency for CLKs, the front pocket interactions of CAF052 are most likely not limited to CLK1 and therefore limit its selectivity. The strong back pocket interactions of CAF022 are also conserved in two other, highly selective CLK inhibitors, VN412 [30] and CLK-T3 [31].\nAnalogous to CAF022, both VN412 (Figure 4c) as well as CLK-T3 (Figure 4d) form direct van-der-Waals interaction with V324 and form similar hydrogen bonds with K191 and a conserved back pocket water molecule. Taken together, these structural models suggest that CAF022, analogous to CLK-T3 and VN412 exploits the non-conserved back pocket\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This binding mode results in an affinity gain particular for the CLKs while avoiding extensive ATP mimetic kinase hinge contacts.\nThus, based on kinome wide screening, a panel of in vitro binding and enzymatic assays, NanoBRET in cell target engagement assays, and crystal structure and modeling data with the ethoxy analogue CAF-022, we show that CAF-170 is a unique CLK inhibitor suitable for exploring elements of CLK biology in cells.\nCAF-170 is active against multiple cancer types As others have linked CLK activity to cancer cell growth, we screened CAF-170 (SGCCLK-1) in the ProQinase CL100 cancer cell line panel. IC50 values for cell-proliferation were determined for 100 different cancer cell lines using a cell -titer glow assay format (full data set is on Supplemental table). SCG-CLK-1 has an IC50 value for inhibiting proliferation <250 nM for 27/100 cell lines tested. Figure 5a shows the IC50 values in subsets grouped by tissue type. As CLK2 showed the most potent inhibition with CAF170, we focused on CLK2 expression to determine the best cancer type to target.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To test this idea, we went to The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) data to determine which cancers by organ have dependencies on single genes through both RNAi and CRIPSR screens. DepMap predicted CLK2 as a dependency for neuroblastoma (various), EWS_FLI (bone), glioma (brain) and glioblastoma (brain), and hematopoietic and lymphoid (blood), among others (Figure 5d). This substantial overlap between the IC50:peptide ratio and DepMap in cancer type was the greatest for CLK2 as compared to the other CLK family members (Supplemental Figure 1).\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

IF quantification of pSR localization post conditioned media washout in U118-MG cells. g. pSR localization via IF in denoted CLK inhibitors at either 500 or 100 nM concentrations for the times written. The bold bars depict the negative control for the respective CLK inhibitor. CLK2 inhibition via CAF-170 (SGC-CLK-1) redistributes CLK2 and SR proteins. To test the efficacy of our CLK inhibitor in cell lines, we chose cell lines that showed either moderate (MDA-MB-435) or maximum (U118-MG) sensitivity to CAF-170 in our screen (Figure 5a) and had similar growth rates (Supplemental Fig 2a). Treatment with CAF170 showed a dose-dependent decrease in the growth of both U118-MG and MDA-MB435 cells, with U118-MG cells being more sensitive, as predicted, with little effect of the negative control compound CAF-225 (Figure 6a). As others have shown that CLK inhibition broadly decreases SR phosphorylation (pSR), we tested for but did not detect significant pSR changes at our highest treatment condition of 1 \u00b5M CAF-170. At 5 \u00b5M, however, we observed a decrease in SR phosphorylation 30 minutes post CAF-170 treatment (Supplemental Figure 2b,c). This, however, did not explain the decrease in cell growth we noted at a 10-fold lower concentration. We therefore looked at the localization of both pSRs and CLK2 post CAF-170 treatment. Surprisingly, we observed significant changes in the cellular distribution of both pSRs and CLK2 in cells treated with 500nM treatment of CAF-170 over the course of 60 minutes (Figure 6b-d). We next tested if the effect of our CLK2 probe could be reversed after CAF-170 was removed from the media. U118-MG cells were treated with 500nM CAF-170 for 15 minutes, and the media was replaced by conditioned U118-MG media where pSR and CLK2 localization was determined every 15 minutes for an hour. As shown in Figure 6e and quantified in Figure 6f, pSRs and CLK2 could redistribute to a normal punctate pattern post CAF-170\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Since our CLK2 probe showed a decrease in cell growth at a much lower concentration than other published CLK compounds, we wanted to test if other CLK inhibitors also affected pSR and CLK2 localization at nM-range concentrations. 500nM treatment with the active CLK probes \u2013 MU1210 and T3 \u2013 as well as their negative controls \u2013 MU140 and DMSO \u2013 did not show any effect on pSR or CLK2 localization. In this way, our CLK2 modulator seems to have a distinct mechanism of action at lower doses as compared to other published CLK inhibitors."

As the CLKs have garnered recent interest as potential therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis, solid tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and drug refractory malignancies, a diverse set of tool compounds are necessary to better understand the role of these regulatory splicing kinases.\nUsing the in vitro CL100 cancer cell line panel IC50 screen, CCLE peptide abundance, and DepMap dependency information, we found that brain, skin, blood, and bone cancers show the lowest IC50 for CLK inhibition with the highest expression and greatest dependency for CLK2. We further confirm this in both a skin and brain cell line, where we find a dose-dependent decrease in growth with CAF-170 (SGC-CLK-1) as compared to our negative control compound CAF-225 (SGC-CLK-1N).

The high dose effect on pSR phosphorylation is probably due to inhibition of all CLK isoforms (or other kinase targets) at the 5 \u00b5M concentration. The low dose phenotype, however, seems to be specific to our probe, as compared to other published probes, and warrants further exploration. Finally, we show that this compound can be washed out, which makes it a useful tool compound for live imaging experiments in the future to determine the localization (low dose) vs. kinase function (high dose) of the CLK family members.\nAs splicing modulators have become more prevalent in clinical use, a better understanding of the full role of these splicing factors and kinases are needed. CAF-170 (SGC-CLK-1) may be able to shed some light on the function of CLK family members with its non-canonical role of CLK and pSR mislocalization at low concentration vs its canonical role of phosphorylation modulation at higher doses. Future studies are needed to complete our understanding of this biologically important family and the roles they play in a diverse set of malignancies."
