    "abstractText": "Calcineurin, a key regulator of the calcium signaling pathway, is involved in calcium signal transduction and calcium ion homeostasis. Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating filamentous phytopathogenic fungus in rice, yet little is known about the function of the calcium signaling system. Here, we identified a novel calcineurin regulatory-subunit-binding protein, MoCbp7, which is highly conserved in filamentous fungi and was found to localize in the cytoplasm. Phenotypic analysis of the MoCBP7 gene deletion mutant (\u2206Mocbp7) showed that MoCbp7 influenced the growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, invasive growth, and virulence of M. oryzae. Some calcium-signaling-related genes, such as YVC1, VCX1, and RCN1, are expressed in a calcineurin/MoCbp7-dependent manner. Furthermore, MoCbp7 synergizes with calcineurin to regulate endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. Our research indicated that M. oryzae may have evolved a new calcium signaling regulatory network to adapt to its environment compared to the fungal model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

            "text": "Calcium ions are widely present in cells as universal signaling mediators, and they affect a series of biological processes [1]. In fungi, as in other higher organisms, the resting cytosol shows a very low free calcium ion concentration (between 50 nM and 200 nM). When cells are stimulated by environmental cues or developmental factors, calcium ions from external stores or organelles (such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vesicles) enter the cytosol along calcium channels and initiate downstream signaling by changing the conformation of calcium-binding proteins [2\u20134]. The free calcium ion level in the cytosol usually shows a rapid and transient increase after stimulation. It eventually shows an exponential decline, which depends on the inverse concentration gradient transport by calcium transport proteins located at the plasma and intracellular membranes and is important for intracellular calcium ion homeostasis [5]. Calcineurin (CN) is a calcium ion/calmodulin (CAM)-binding protein that is conserved in eukaryotes [6]. As a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, it consists of a catalytic subunit (calcineurin A, CNA) and a regulatory subunit (calcineurin B, CNB). The catalytic subunit contains a central calmodulin-binding region and an N-terminal phosphatase domain, while the regulatory subunit possesses four EF-hand motifs that bind calcium ions with high affinity [7]. When the calcium ion concentration in the cytosol is transient,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9297. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24119297 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9297 2 of 16\ncalcineurin relies on calcium ions or the calcium sensor protein, calmodulin, to dephosphorylate downstream targets, such as a critical transcription factor, Crz1, which is a homolog of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in mammals and is involved in calcium signaling transduction and calcium ion homeostasis in fungi [8,9]. Some endogenous regulators have been identified to regulate calcineurin activity, such as the calcineurin temperature suppressor, Cts1 [10], and the calcineurin regulator, Rcn1 [11], found in fungi. In addition, some immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporin A and FK506, can effectively inhibit calcineurin in the presence of their respective cytoplasmic immunophilin, cyclophilin, and FK506-binding protein [7]. The ER is a complex organelle responsible for many biological processes such as protein synthesis and processing, lipid metabolism, and calcium ion storage in fungi [12]. A higher concentration of calcium ions is essential for enzyme activity. In S. cerevisiae, the steady-state calcium ion concentration in the ER is approximately 100 times higher than in the cytosol [13]. If calcium homeostasis in the ER is dysregulated, ER stress will be induced, the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which drives adaptive protein folding, is triggered to keep the ER in a steady state. [12,14]. The activation of the UPR pathway also induces endoplasmic reticulum autophagy (ER-phagy), which reshapes ER homeostasis by degrading damaged and redundant parts of the ER [15,16]. Numerous studies have reported the role of calcineurin, calcium transport proteins, and other calcium-signalingrelated proteins in response to ER stress [14,17\u201320], suggesting that the calcium signaling pathway is necessary for ER homeostasis in fungi. Magnaporthe oryzae poses a serious threat to rice production worldwide and has been receiving widespread attention [21,22]. Asexual conidia of M. oryzae can germinate on rice leaves under suitable environmental conditions. The conidia germinate and form polarized germ tubes, the tips of which swell to form a specialized infection structure termed appressorium. The appressorium can be fixed on the leaf surface and generate up to 8.0 MPa of turgor pressure by accumulating organic molecules such as glycerol. The turgor pressure will eventually be converted into a mechanical force to form a penetration peg at the base of the appressorium to breach the host cuticle, and the invasive hyphae will expand within the rice tissue to cause disease [23,24]. Typical disease spots form on the leaf surface, and the mature conidia can start a new round of spread with the help of wind and dew after 5\u20137 days [25,26]. In the last two decades, many conserved signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in virulence-related signaling and in response to external physical and chemical signals in M. oryzae, such as the cAMPprotein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway and the Pmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Pmk1-MAPK) pathway [27\u201330]; the production of turgor pressure depends on autophagy to degrade conidial contents [24,31]; the Mps1-MAPK pathway regulates the growth of invasive hyphae and inhibits the host defense response [32,33]; and the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, which regulates autophagy and is necessary for appressorial development and invasive growth [34,35]. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the calcium signaling pathway remain largely unknown in M. oryzae. Many calcium-signal-related proteins are involved in the regulation of M. oryzae virulence, including genes encoding calcineurin, calcineurin A subunit (MoCna1), and calcineurin B subunit (MoCnb1). MoCnb1 is especially important in regulating the virulence of M. oryzae [36]. Here, we reported a novel gene, MGG_16441, which encodes a protein that was shown to interact with MoCnb1; we named it MoCbp7 (calcineurin-binding protein). MoCbp7 was localized in the cytoplasm and participated in the calcium signaling pathway, was involved in calcium ion homeostasis and ER homeostasis, and was found to be essential for growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, and virulence.\nInt.

In order to verify the functions of MoCbp7, we obtained a null mutant by a highthroughput knockout system and generated a complemented strain containing a 3 \u00d7 FLAG tag. To ascertain the effect of MoCbp7 on autophagy, the autophagy flux was detected by the degradation rate of GFP-MoAtg8, an autophagy marker, in \u2206Mocbp7 and wild-type 70-15.

Then, using MoCbp7 as bait, we performed a screening of the rice blast fungus cDNA library again, and the potential interacting proteins are listed in Table S1. Interestingly, a calcineurin B subunit (MoCnb1), which was previously reported to be knockout lethal and to act as a key protein in infection mediation in M. oryzae [36], was found to interact with MoCbp7 in a further yeast two-hybrid validation (Figure 1D) and pulldown assay (Figure 1E).

Additionally, both in the treated wildtype 70-15 and the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant, there were no appreciable changes (within a 0.5-fold change) in the expression level of several key genes, including PMR1, CMD1, CNA1, and CNB1, indicating that the expression level of these genes may not be considerably impacted by the suppression of calcineurin activity or the deletion of MoCBP7.

As shown in Figure 4A, mycelium turned white when MoCBP7 was deleted, and the colony growth rate of the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant was slower compared to wild-type 70-15 and Mocbp7C (Figure 4A,B) both in complete medium (CM) and minimal medium (MM). Further investigation of the conidiation ability revealed that, in contrast to the wild-type 70-15 and Mocbp7C, which possessed the normal clustering conidia, the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant showed far fewer conidia and had longer and unbranched conidiophores (Figure 4C). As shown in Figures S2 and 4D, the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant displayed a severe conidiation deficiency but a normal conidial shape. Plant infection in M. oryzae is significantly influenced by the appressorium, a typical pathogenic fungal infection structure [24]. Therefore, we further observed the morphology of the developing appressorium in the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant. Similar to the wild-type 70-15 and Mocbp7C, the conidia germinated normally in the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant. However, appressorium formation proceeded at a slower rate, with about 18.48% of conidia still unable to form an appressorium at 24 hpi (Figures 4E and S2). In conclusion, our phenotypic analysis indicated that MoCbp7 is essential for asexual growth, conidiation, and appressorium formation in M. oryzae. Int. J. Mol.

In contrast to the barley leaves inoculated with wild-type 70-15 and Mocbp7C, which showed typical severe disease symptoms, the barley leaves inoculated with the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant showed little visible damage. Then, conidial suspensions (5 \u00d7 104 conidia/mL) were acquired for the subsequent spray infection assays in order to further validate whether the defect in virulence of the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant was exclusively caused by the defect in conidiation. Similarly, in the spray infection assays with 2-week-old rice seedlings (CO-39), numerous typical spindle-shaped lesions were observed on leaves sprayed with the conidia of wild-type 70-15 or the complementary strain Mocbp7C, but only slightly limited necrosis was observed in the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant after 6 dpi (Figure 5B,C). Next, the invasive stage of the appressorium was classified after observation of the infection of detached barley leaves under an electron microscope (Figure 5D,E). At 24 hpi, \u2206Mocbp7 mutant barely developed invasive hypha (IH), and less than 5% of the appressoria had developed penetration pegs. In contrast, 72.67% of the appressoria in the wild-type 70-15 produced IH, of which 41.25% had one or more branches. At 48 hpi, nearly 95% of the appressoria in wild-type 70-15 and Mocbp7C had penetrated the host cuticle and produced IH with multiple branches that spread to adjacent cells. This is compared to 68.56% of the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant appressoria, which were still in the non-infected stage, and only 16.33% of the IH could form branches but did not develop to adjacent cells, which indicated the severely impaired invasion capacity of appressoria in the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant. Previous studies have shown that a critical component of the penetrating pegs\u2019 ability to penetrate the host cuticle and achieve invasion is the enormous turgor pressure in the appressorium [24]. To investigate whether the defective appressorial infection of the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant is due to insufficient turgor pressure accumulated in the appressoria, 1.0 M and 2.0 M concentrations of exogenous glycerol were applied to the appressorium, and the results for the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant were not significantly different than those of 70-15 and Mocbp7C, as shown in Figure 5F. Additionally, the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant showed a consistent result in both intact and wounded (cuticle-damaged) barley leaves, indicating that the deficiency in conidial virulence was not due to the insufficient appressoria turgor. In summary, we concluded that MoCBP7 is a pathogenicity-related gene that is required for appressorial penetration and invasive growth."

To investigate whether the defective appressorial infection of the \u0394Mocbp7 mutant is due to insufficient turgor pressure accumulated in the appressoria, 1.0 M and 2.0 M concentrations of exogenous glycerol were applied to the appressorium, and the results for the \u0394Mocbp7 mutant were not significantly different than those of 70-15 and Mocbp7C, as shown in Figure 5F. Additionally, the \u0394Mocbp7 mutant showed a consistent result in both intact and wounded (cuticle-damaged) barley leaves, indicating that the deficiency in conidial virulence was not due to the insufficient appressoria turgor. In summary, we concluded that MoCBP7 is a pathogenicity-related gene that is required for appressorial penetration and invasive growth. 2.6. MoCbp7 Cooperates with Calcineurin to Regulate ER Homeostasis in M. oryzae The ER, one of the major organelles for storing calcium ions, is subject to precise con-\ncentration regulation [39]. Numerous studies have shown that the calcium signaling path-\nway participates in ER stress adaptation, whereas a reduction in the calcium content in\nthe ER induces ER stress [12]. To better comprehend the relationship between the calcium\nsignaling system and ER, two ER stress inducers, dithiothreitol (DTT) and tunicamycin\n(TUNI), were added to the MM media to test the sensitivity of the \u0394Mocbp7 mutant. In\nMM media supplemented with 5 mM DTT or 1 g/mL TUNI, the relative growth rate of\nthe \u0394Mocbp7 mutant was higher than that of wild-type 70-15 and Mocbp7C. (Figure 6A,B).\nThe ER stress response initially activates the UPR pathway. The apoptotic process is triggered by the UPR when ER homeostasis is disturbed, and thus, ER-phagy is initiated [41]. To further demonstrate the role of MoCbp7 in ER homeostasis, a marker of ER-phagy, GFP-MoSec62, was transferred to the wild-type 70-15 and \u2206Mocbp7, and the level of ER-phagy was determined by monitoring the degradation level of the expressed fusion protein. The ER-phagy level was higher in the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant when cultured in liquid CM (Figure 6E). After treatment with 5 mM DTT for 6 h, the level of ER degradation was still significantly higher in the \u2206Mocbp7 mutant than in the wild type (Figure 6E). Similar results were found in the FK506-treated wild type (Figure 6F). The spontaneous activation of the UPR pathway and ER-phagy in \u2206Mocbp7 implies that MoCbp7 is involved in the regulation of ER homeostasis and that regulation may be carried out in cooperation with calcineurin in M. oryzae. Furthermore, our data supported previous studies that\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 9297 10 of 16\nsuggest that the inhibition of calcineurin activity causes ER stress, which in turn leads to the activation of the UPR pathway and ER-phagy, suggesting that calcineurin is a regulator of ER homeostasis in M. oryzae."

            "text": "Calcium signaling is affected by the flux of calcium ions from external and internal stores. In the calcium signaling system, calcineurin function as a regulatory hub, delivering calcium signaling information and regulating calcium ion homeostasis so that intracellular calcium signaling is ordered in a wave or transient form [1,5]. The lifestyle requirements for a pathogen have shaped specific signaling modules in these organisms, and unlike higher eukaryotes, filamentous fungi have distinct calcium signaling networks, showing peculiarities in the purposes and specific traits of calcium signaling pathways [5,42]. Here we identified a specific calcineurin B subunit-binding protein, MoCbp7, which was found to play pleiotropic roles development, conidiation, appressorium formation, invasive growth, and virulence in M. oryzae (Figures 4 and 5). Additionally, we found that MoCbp7 and calcineurin cooperated to maintain endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, revealing a novel mechanism for calcium signaling and endoplasmic-reticulum-dependent cell homeostasis and providing new avenues for drug development. Calcineurin-mediated calcium signaling plays an important role in growth, conidiation, and virulence [43,44] as well as various environmental stress responses, such as high temperature, high pH, and ER stress [45]. However, the precise mechanism of how calcineurin is involved in numerous signaling processes is still uncertain. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that a greater number of calcium-signaling-related proteins are present in N. crassa and M. oryzae compared to S. cerevisiae, and filamentous fungi have more redundant Ca2+-permeable channels, cation/proton exchangers, and P-ATPases, which is likely due to their more complicated cellular organization and filamentous growth form. This implies that filamentous fungi have a more complex calcium signaling response mechanism than S. cerevisiae [4]. Recently, new studies of various calcineurin-mediated calcium signals in fungi have emerged. However, only one calcineurin downstream transcription factor, Crz1, has been identified in fungi, which can directly interact with the calcineurin A subunit and initiate nuclear localization to mediate downstream gene transcription [9,46]. A total of 140 of the 346 MoCrz1-binding genes discovered in M. oryzae are targets regulated in a calcineurin/Crz1-dependent manner [47]. Additionally, more than 30 calcium/Rcn1-dependent genes were discovered to be direct targets of MoCrz1, in which Rcn1 is a regulator of calcineurin [11]. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of calcineurin remain largely unknown in M. oryzae as well as in many others. Here we identified a novel calcineurin regulatory-subunit-binding protein, MoCbp7, which is crucial for the calcium signaling pathway in M. oryzae. Since MoCbp7 is only found in filamentous fungi, we speculated that it may be a novel protein evolved only in filamentous fungi that enables them to survive in their particular environment. Calcineurin plays an important role in ER stress. In S. cerevisiae, calcium uptake activates calcineurin activity to protect cells from damage by prolonged ER stress, but large amounts of calcium ions trigger programmed cell death [48,49]. Our experiments demonstrated that in M. oryzae, both FK506 treatment and deletion of MoCbp7 caused ER stress, triggering constitutive activation of the UPR pathway and ER-phagy (Figure 6), which indicates that ER homeostasis is regulated by calcineurin. ER homeostasis is involved in the pathogenicity of pathogens. According to previous reports, activation of the UPR pathway or stimulation of ER-phagy affect virulence by influencing appressorial penetration and invasive growth [20,50,51]. In addition, fungi synthesize, fold, and mature a series of secreted proteins through the ER to influence the infection by affecting the host defense response during the biotrophic phase of pathogenic fungi infection of the host plants [52,53]. Similarly, \u2206Mocbp7 displayed obvious pathogenic defects, as not only can most appressoria still not form the penetration peg at 48 hpi but also have a defect in invasive hyphae (Figure 5D,E). These indicated that MoCbp7 is involved in some basal\nInt. J. Mol.

MoCbp7 is essential for growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, and pathogenicity. Our study provided a new perspective on the role of the calcium signaling pathway in M. oryzae, and further attempts can be made to develop more accurate calcium signaling monitoring tools for the calcium signaling study in M. oryzae.\nFigure 7.
