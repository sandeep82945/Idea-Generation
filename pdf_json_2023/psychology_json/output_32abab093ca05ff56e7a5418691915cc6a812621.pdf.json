    "abstractText": "Diseases induced by bacterial and viral infections are common occurrences in our daily life, and the main prevention and treatment strategies are vaccination and taking antibacterial/antiviral drugs. However, vaccines can only be used for specific viral infections, and the abuse of antibacterial/antiviral drugs will create multi\u2212drug\u2212resistant bacteria and viruses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more targeted prevention and treatment methods against bacteria and viruses. Proteins on the surface of bacteria and viruses can specifically bind to sugar, so glycopolymers can be used as potential antibacterial and antiviral drugs. In this review, the research of glycopolymers for bacterial/viral detection/inhibition and antibacterial/antiviral applications in recent years are summarized.",

As a result, different regions are experiencing the spread of diseases caused by these pathogens. With the emergence of superbugs, as well as the global epidemic of COVID\u221219, we are facing significant challenges in the prevention and treatment of these diseases due to drug resistance and genetic mutations. At present, the effective prevention and treatment strategy for bacterial diseases is to take antibiotic drugs, and the prevention and treatment strategy for viral diseases is mainly vaccination or taking antiviral drugs. However, vaccines can only be used for specific types of viral infections, and antivirals or antimicrobials can make viruses or bacteria resistant. Therefore, it is important to develop more targeted prevention and treatment methods against highly drug\u2212resistant bacteria and viruses. There are a lot of glycoproteins on the surface of bacteria, viruses and other life forms [2]. Different kinds of sugars can specifically combine with pathogens that contain different types of recognition proteins, such as mannose and Escherichia coli, L\u2212Fucose and Vibrio cholerae, salivary lactose and mumps virus/influenza virus, etc. In addition, the specific binding of sugars and proteins is also affected by a variety of factors, such as the \u201cmultivalent effect\u201d of polysaccharides [3\u20136], topology [7\u20139] (star\u2212shaped, dendritic), heterogeneity [10\u201316], etc. Therefore, glycopolymers with various structures have been developed to specifically recognize and bind with different bacteria and viruses, so as to achieve the application of inhibiting bacterial infection, virus infection, bacterial detection, etc. In this review, the research on glycopolymers targeting bacteria and viruses in recent years is summarized, and the applications of glycopolymers containing different kinds of sugar side groups, different topological structures and compounds with other materials in bacterial detection, sterilization and antibacterial infection are reviewed in detail. At the same time, the methods of different kinds of glycopolymers to inhibit virus infection by recognizing proteins on the surface of viruses are also summarized and discussed.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 985. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28030985 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 985 2 of 16"

When mannose recognizes and binds flagellin on the surface of Escherichia coli in aqueous solution, a large number of green aggregates will be formed.

            "text": "Glycopolymers themselves do not have the ability to kill bacteria, but have the ability to recognize and combine with specific bacteria. Therefore, glycopolymers can be designed and synthesized with antibacterial groups, or conjugated with nanoparticles with bacteria\u2212killing ability to realize the function of sterilization. It is possible for poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) to approach bacteria due to electrostatic interactions between cationic groups and negatively charged cell walls. Consequently, PILs insert hydrophobic fragments into the membranes of bacteria and cause the rupture and death of bacteria [27,28]. Based on this, Li et al. synthesized mannose\u2212based poly(ionic liquid)s to kill Gram\u2212positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram\u2212negative Escherichia coli. [19]. As shown in Figure 4, Yuan et al. modified the surface of gold nanoparticles with poly [2\u2212(methacrylamido)glucopyranose] (pMAG) and poly [2\u2212(methacryloyloxy)ethyl trimethylammonium iodide] (pMETAI) to achieve specific killing of Escherichia coli [29]. Quaternary ammonium salt polymers were cationic polymers that destroyed bacterial cell membranes and caused their death after coming into contact with them. The modification not only conferred bactericidal properties to the gold nanoparticles, but also formed a charged protective layer on their surface, maintaining the stability of the nanoparticles under physiological conditions. The glycopolymer not only helped the gold nanoparticles recognize Escherichia coli specifically, but also improved the contact between Escherichia coli and the quaternary ammonium salt polymer, thus improving the sterilization efficiency.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 17\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a03.\u00a0Schematic\u00a0diagram\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0synthesis\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0glycopolymer\u2212functionalized\u00a0resin\u00a0(Resin\u2212Glc)\u00a0 for\u00a0capture\u00a0and\u00a0quantification\u00a0of\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli/ConA.\u00a0Figure\u00a0reproduced\u00a0from\u00a0ref.\u00a0[26]\u00a0with\u00a0per\u2010 mission.\u00a0\n2.2.\u00a0Glycopolymers\u00a0for\u00a0Sterilization\u00a0 Glycopolymers\u00a0themselves\u00a0do\u00a0not\u00a0have\u00a0the\u00a0ability\u00a0to\u00a0kill\u00a0bacteria,\u00a0but\u00a0have\u00a0the\u00a0ability\u00a0 to\u00a0 recognize\u00a0 and\u00a0 combine\u00a0with\u00a0 specific\u00a0bacteria.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0glycopolymers\u00a0 can\u00a0be\u00a0de\u2010 signed\u00a0and\u00a0synthesized\u00a0with\u00a0antibacterial\u00a0groups,\u00a0or\u00a0conjugated\u00a0with\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0with\u00a0 bacteria\u2212killing\u00a0ability\u00a0to\u00a0realize\u00a0the\u00a0function\u00a0of\u00a0sterilization.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0possible\u00a0for\u00a0poly(ionic\u00a0 liquid)s\u00a0 (PILs)\u00a0 to\u00a0 pproach\u00a0 bacteria\u00a0 due\u00a0 to\u00a0 lectrostatic\u00a0 interactions\u00a0 between\u00a0 catio ic\u00a0 groups\u00a0and\u00a0 gatively\u00a0charged\u00a0cell\u00a0walls.\u00a0Consequently,\u00a0PILs\u00a0 insert\u00a0hydrophobic\u00a0 fr g\u2010 ments\u00a0in o\u00a0the\u00a0membranes\u00a0of\u00a0bacteria\u00a0and\u00a0cause\u00a0the\u00a0rupture\u00a0and\u00a0death\u00a0of\u00a0bacteria\u00a0[27,28].\u00a0 Based\u00a0on\u00a0this,\u00a0Li\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0synthesized\u00a0mannose\u2212based\u00a0poly(ionic\u00a0liquid)s\u00a0to\u00a0kill\u00a0Gram\u2212posi\u2010 tive\u00a0Staphylococcus\u00a0aureus\u00a0an \u00a0Gram\u2212negative\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli.\u00a0[19].\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04,\u00a0 Yuan\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0modified\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0gold\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0with\u00a0poly\u00a0[2\u2212(methacrylamido)glu\u2010 copyranose]\u00a0 (pMAG)\u00a0 and\u00a0 poly[2\u2212(methacryloyloxy)ethyl\u00a0 tri ethylammonium\u00a0 iodide]\u00a0 (pMETAI)\u00a0to\u00a0achieve\u00a0specific\u00a0killing\u00a0of\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli\u00a0[29].\u00a0Quaternary\u00a0ammonium\u00a0salt\u00a0 polymers\u00a0were\u00a0 cationic\u00a0poly ers\u00a0 that\u00a0destroyed\u00a0bacterial\u00a0 cell\u00a0membranes\u00a0and\u00a0 caused\u00a0 their\u00a0death\u00a0after\u00a0coming\u00a0into\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0them.\u00a0The\u00a0modification\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0conferred\u00a0bac\u2010 tericidal\u00a0properties\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0gold\u00a0nanoparticles,\u00a0but\u00a0also\u00a0formed\u00a0a\u00a0charged\u00a0protective\u00a0layer\u00a0 on\u00a0their\u00a0surface,\u00a0maintaining\u00a0the\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0under\u00a0physiological\u00a0condi\u2010 tions.\u00a0The\u00a0glycopolymer\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0helped\u00a0the\u00a0gold\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0recognize\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli\u00a0 specifically,\u00a0but\u00a0also\u00a0improved\u00a0the\u00a0contact\u00a0between\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0quaternary\u00a0am\u2010 monium\u00a0salt\u00a0polymer,\u00a0thus\u00a0improving\u00a0the\u00a0sterilization\u00a0efficiency.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a04.\u00a0Schematic\u00a0diagram\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0bactericidal\u00a0and\u00a0recognition\u00a0functions\u00a0of\u00a0gold\u00a0nanoparticle\u00a0com\u2010 plexes\u00a0regulated\u00a0by\u00a0modifying\u00a0different\u00a0polymers.\u00a0Figure\u00a0reproduced\u00a0from\u00a0ref.\u00a0[29]\u00a0with\u00a0permis\u2010 sion.\u00a0 i r .
