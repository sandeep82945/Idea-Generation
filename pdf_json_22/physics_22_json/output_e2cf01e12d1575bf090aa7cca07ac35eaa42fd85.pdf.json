For a long time, this bosonic Hamiltonian was considered one of the simplest systems which exhibit dynamical chaos both classically and quantum-mechanically. Its structure closely resembles that of spatially compactified pure Yang-Mills theory. Correspondingly, the structure of our supersymmetric Hamiltonian is similar to that of spatially compactified supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, also known as the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) model. We present numerical evidence that a continuous energy spectrum of the supersymmetric model leads to monotonous growth of OTOCs down to the lowest temperatures, a property that is also expected for the BFSS model from holographic duality. We find that this growth is saturated by low-energy eigenstates with effectively one-dimensional wave functions and a completely nonchaotic energy level distribution. We observe a sharp boundary separating these low-energy states from the bulk of chaotic high-energy states. Our data suggest, although with limited confidence, that at low temperatures the OTOC growth might be exponential over a finite range of time, with the corresponding Lyapunov exponent scaling linearly with temperature. In contrast, the gapped low-energy spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian leads to oscillating OTOCs at low temperatures without any signatures of exponential growth. We also find that the OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian are never sufficiently close to the classical Lyapunov distance. On the other hand, the OTOCs for the supersymmetric system agree with the classical limit reasonably well over a finite range of temperatures and evolution times.",

For a long time, this bosonic Hamiltonian was considered one of the simplest systems which exhibit dynamical chaos both classically and quantum-mechanically. Its structure closely resembles that of spatially compactified pure Yang-Mills theory. Correspondingly, the structure of our supersymmetric Hamiltonian is similar to that of spatially compactified supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, also known as the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) model. We present numerical evidence that a continuous energy spectrum of the supersymmetric model leads to monotonous growth of OTOCs down to the lowest temperatures, a property that is also expected for the BFSS model from holographic duality. We find that this growth is saturated by low-energy eigenstates with effectively one-dimensional wave functions and a completely nonchaotic energy level distribution. We observe a sharp boundary separating these low-energy states from the bulk of chaotic high-energy states. Our data suggest, although with limited confidence, that at low temperatures the OTOC growth might be exponential over a finite range of time, with the corresponding Lyapunov exponent scaling linearly with temperature. In contrast, the gapped low-energy spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian leads to oscillating OTOCs at low temperatures without any signatures of exponential growth. We also find that the OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian are never sufficiently close to the classical Lyapunov distance. On the other hand, the OTOCs for the supersymmetric system agree with the classical limit reasonably well over a finite range of temperatures and evolution times.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.046001\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOut-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), first introduced in Ref. [1], have recently attracted a lot of attention as probes of quantum chaos in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. For a systemwith a Hamiltonian operator H\u0302 at temperature T, the OTOC of two operators A\u0302 and B\u0302 is defined as\nC\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u2212Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u0302\u00bdA\u0302\u00f0t\u00de; B\u0302\u00f00\u00de 2\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere A\u0302\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc eiH\u0302tA\u0302e\u2212iH\u0302t is the time-dependent operator A\u0302 in the Heisenberg representation and \u03c1\u0302 \u00bc Z\u22121e\u2212H\u0302=T is the thermal density matrix. OTOCs measure the sensitivity of a time evolution of a physical observable A\u0302\u00f0t\u00de to small perturbations of an initial\nquantum state by an operator B\u0302\u00f00\u00de. Let us assume that the operator A\u0302 is some canonical coordinate x\u0302, and the operator B\u0302 is the corresponding conjugate momentum p\u0302. In this case, the commutator \u00bdx\u00f0t\u00de; p \u00f00\u00de in the OTOC (1) corresponds to the classical Poisson bracket\nfx\u00f0t\u00de; p\u00f00\u00deg \u00bc \u2202x\u00f0t\u00de \u2202x\u00f00\u00de \u2202p\u00f00\u00de \u2202p\u00f00\u00de \u00bc \u2202x\u00f0t\u00de \u2202x\u00f00\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nthat measures the sensitivity of time evolution of a dynamical system to its initial conditions. For a chaotic system, fx\u00f0t\u00de; p\u00f00\u00deg is expected to grow exponentially as e\u03bbt, where \u03bb is the leading (largest) Lyapunov exponent. In what follows, we refer to \u03bb as simply the Lyapunov exponent. Generalizing the thermal average of the squared partial derivative \u2202x\u00f0t\u00de\n\u2202x\u00f00\u00de in (2), OTOCs (1) provide us with a quantum definition of the Lyapunov exponent \u03bb. Namely, for a quantum chaotic system, the OTOCs (1) are expected to grow as e2\u03bbt for some period of time. Many studies of OTOCs were to a large extent motivated by the derivation of a rigorous bound,\n\u03bb \u2264 2\u03c0T; \u00f03\u00de\n*pavel.buividovich@liverpool.ac.uk\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

[2] and the demonstration that for sufficiently low temperatures this bound is saturated by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model [3,4]. More generally, it was found that theMaldacena, Shenker, and Stanford (MSS) bound (3) is saturated for systems with a holographic dual description. Interestingly, the bound might be also saturated by simple experimentally accessible systems such as trapped ions in an external potential [5]. However, the demonstration of OTOC growth in generic chaotic quantum many-body systems and in quantum field theory turned out to be a very challenging endeavor. The progress was mostly limited to conformal field theory, quantum circuits, and simple spin chain models [6\u20138], often with quenched disorder [9,10]. For example, so far, it has not been possible to explicitly demonstrate the saturation of the MSS bound (3) in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix model [11], which has a well-established holographic description in terms of blackD0-branes in type IIA superstring theory orM theory [12,13]. Even in the SYK model, the equality \u03bb \u00bc 2\u03c0T can only be demonstrated using a model-specific diagrammatic technique [3,4,14], while generally applicable techniques such as exact diagonalization so far have not been able reach the relevant lowtemperature, large-system regime [15\u201317]. Needless to say, the analysis of OTOCs and quantum Lyapunov exponents in higher-dimensional quantum field theories such as QCD is an even more formidable task. In this situation, a lot of attention was attracted to simple quantum-mechanical systems in which the OTOCs can be calculated exactly using either analytic or numerical techniques, for example, by explicitly solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. At the level of pure states, exponential OTOC growth was demonstrated in a kicked rotor system [18] and in quantum stadia [19]. Thermal OTOCs for simple quantum systems and for quantum billiards were extensively considered in Ref. [20]. In Ref. [21], OTOCs were calculated semianalytically for the quartic anharmonic oscillator. In these cases, no exponential growth was clearly observed. Interestingly, an exponential OTOC growth can be observed in a double-well potential for temperatures or energies that are close the height of the saddle point separating the two wells [22,23]. In this case, the saddle point resembles an inverted harmonic oscillator, which also exhibits an exponential OTOC growth [24]. Since real-time dynamics of many-body systems remains to a large extent inaccessible for simulations on classical computers, an important methodological application of simple chaotic quantum-mechanical systems might be the development and testing of numerical methods for diagnosing real-time quantum chaos. One of the most popular and simple quantum-mechanical models for studying various aspects of quantum chaos is a system with two bosonic degrees of freedom x\u03021 and x\u03022 and the Hamiltonian of the form (up to the choice of prefactors for the kinetic and the potential terms)\nH\u0302B \u00bc p\u030221 \u00fe p\u030222 \u00fe x\u030221x\u030222: \u00f04\u00de This Hamiltonian can be obtained by projecting the Hamiltonian of the SU2 bosonic matrix model to the sector with zero angular momentum [25] (see also Refs. [26,27]). In turn, the SU\u00f02\u00de bosonic matrix model is a dimensional reduction of SU\u00f02\u00de Yang-Mills theory. It is also a bosonic part of the Hamiltonian of N \u00bc 2 BFSS matrix model. Classical dynamics of the Hamiltonian (4) is known to be chaotic at all temperatures or energies [28,29], with the Lyapunov exponent scaling as\n\u03bb \u00bc cT1=4; \u00f05\u00de where c \u2248 1.32 for our definitions of the kinetic and potential terms in (4). The emergence of fractal structures in the classical configuration space of this Hamiltonian has been demonstrated recently in Ref. [30]. A generalization of the Hamiltonian (4) with N bosonic degrees of freedom was considered recently in Ref. [31], and an exponential growth of OTOCs was demonstrated analytically in the next-to-leading order of expansion in 1=N. The flat directions x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0 of the classical Hamiltonian are lifted due to quantum effects, so the energy levels of the quantumHamiltonian (4) are discrete, and all the corresponding wave functions are localized. At sufficiently high energies, the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) exhibits a random-matrix-type level statistics [32] and an exponential OTOC growth [33] at sufficiently high temperatures or energies. In this regime, the energy spectrum can be considered as continuous, and manifestations of quantum chaos are closely related to classical chaotic dynamics. However, the discrete energy spectrum of the system (4) implies that quantum chaos cannot be observed at low temperatures of the order of the gap between the two lowest energy levels. The crossover1 between the regular oscillatory dynamics at low temperatures and chaotic behavior at large temperatures/energies is a purely quantum phenomenon and is similar to the confinement-deconfinement transition in pure Yang-Mills theory or bosonic matrix models [34,35]. In this paper, we consider a minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the simple bosonic Hamiltonian (4), which exhibits continuous energy spectrum and OTOC growth all theway down to zero temperatures. In this respect, it is qualitatively similar to supersymmetric matrix models and the SYK model and is very different from bounded quantum mechanical systems with discrete energy spectrum like (4). The Hamiltonian of our model can be written as\nH\u0302S \u00bc H\u0302B \u2297 I \u00fe x\u03021 \u2297 \u03c31 \u00fe x\u03022 \u2297 \u03c33\n\u00bc H\u0302B \u00fe x\u03022 x\u03021\nx\u03021 H\u0302B \u2212 x\u03022\n; \u00f06\u00de\n1We are using the term \u201ccrossover\u201d because phase transitions cannot exist for systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom.\n046001-2\nwhere \u03c31, \u03c32, and \u03c33 are the 2 \u00d7 2 Pauli matrices. TheHilbert space of this model is therefore a direct product of theHilbert space of the bosonic model (4) and a two-dimensional \u201cfermionic\u201d Hilbert space on which the Pauli matrices act. The Hamiltonian (6) can also be represented as a square H\u0302S \u00bc Q\u03022 of the supersymmetry generator\nQ\u0302 \u00bc x\u03021x\u03022 \u2297 \u03c32 \u00fe p\u03021 \u2297 \u03c31 \u2212 p\u03022 \u2297 \u03c33: \u00f07\u00de\nThis representation makes it obvious that the energy spectrum of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian is bounded from below, even though the fermionic terms x\u03021 \u2297 \u03c31 \u00fe x\u03022 \u2297 \u03c33 in (6) are unbounded. The supersymmetric model (6) was first introduced inRef. [36] as a toymodel of supersymmetric membrane. In this work, it was demonstrated that quantum corrections that lift the classical flat directions x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0 are canceled out due to supersymmetry, so the directions x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0 remain flat for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6). As a result, the energy spectrum of H\u0302S is continuous, and wave functions extend to infinity along the lines x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0. This demonstration was further extended to the BFSS model to argue that supersymmetric membranes are intrinsically unstable, in contract to bosonic membranes.2 If we consider the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) as a minimal model that is similar to the bosonic matrix model of bosonic membranes, the model (6) is a minimal model that is similar to supersymmetric matrix/ membrane models such as the BFSS [11] matrix model. We will see that, much like in the case of the BFSS model, additional \u201cfermionic\u201d terms in the model (6) eliminate the transition (more precisely, the crossover in our case) to the nonchaotic \u201cconfinement\u201d regime, so the model exhibits monotonously growing OTOCs for all temperatures.3 Somewhat counterintuitively, we find that the energy level statistics still exhibits a rather sharp change between chaotic and regular behavior at large and low energies. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that at high temperatures the supersymmetric model (6) has much better agreement with classical dynamics than the purely bosonic one (4)."

To make the matrix representations (10) and (12) finite and thus numerically tractable, we truncate the infinitedimensional discrete Hilbert space spanned on the basis vectors jk1i \u2297 jk2i to a finite number of states with\nk1 \u00fe k2 < 2M; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere M is the truncation parameter. To reduce the computational cost of exact diagonalization, we further use the discrete parity symmetry of the Hamiltonians (4) and (6) to represent the matrices (10) and (12) in block diagonal form. We then perform numerical diagonalization of the matrices (10) and (12). For not very large M \u2272 100, we use the QR algorithm as implemented in the LAPACK routine DSYEV, finding all eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrices (10) and (12). For larger values of M, we use the Arnoldi algorithm as implemented in the ARPACKPP library to find n \u226a M2 lowest eigenvalues, with n taking values between 102 and 103. Our production code that performs exact diagonalization and calculates the OTOCs is publicly available on GitHub [39]. Numerical data for OTOCs and energy levels are included as ancillary files in the arXiv submission [40]. To analyze the bosonic Hamiltonian (4), the length parameter L is adjusted to the value L \u00bc 21=6 \u2248 1.12246 that minimizes the expectation value h0j \u2297 h0jH\u0302Bj0i \u2297 j0i \u00bc L\u22122 \u00fe L4=4 of H\u0302B in the \u201cperturbative\u201d vacuum state j0i \u2297 j0i. Another strategy would be to minimize the ground-state energy upon exact diagonalization. However, we have found that our results depend very weakly on the choice of L once the number of basis vectors is sufficiently large. For the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6), for each value of the truncation parameter M, we choose the value of the length parameter L that minimizes the gap \u0394E \u00bc E3 \u2212 E1 between its lowest and next-to-lowest energy levels E3 and E1, obtained by exact diagonalization. As explained in Appendix A below, the energy levels of the supersymmetric system are all doubly degenerate; therefore, E2 \u00bc E1, and the first nonzero energy gap is \u0394E \u00bc E3 \u2212 E1 \u00bc E3 \u2212 E2. The dependence of \u0394E on M and L is illustrated in Fig. 1. We found that the dependence of the optimal value of L on the truncation parameter M can be well described by the formula\nL \u00bc 0.961624\u00fe 0.0409431\u00f02M \u2212 1\u00de0.377368: \u00f014\u00de\nWith this choice of L, the dependence of the energy gap\u0394E on M is illustrated in Fig. 2. Fitting suggests that it can be well described by the power law\n\u0394E \u00bc 4.36466M\u22121.16619; \u00f015\u00de\nwhich is shown in Fig. 2 as a solid red line. For comparison, in Fig. 2, we also show the dependence of the gap \u0394E on M for the free particle Hamiltonians in one and two dimensions,\nH\u03021D \u00bc p\u03022; \u00f016\u00de H\u03022D \u00bc p\u030221 \u00fe p\u030222; \u00f017\u00de\nwhich are subject to the same truncations of the Hilbert space as the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. Namely, we consider the one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16) on the Hilbert space spanned by all one-dimensional basis states (9) with k < 2M and with the length parameter that depends onM as in (14). The power-law dependence of the energy gap of H\u03021D onM appears to be quite close to the result (15) for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian: \u0394E \u00bc 2.54431 M\u22121.17463. This power-law fit is shown in Fig. 2 with a solid line. For the free two-dimensional Hamiltonian (17), the Hilbert space is truncated to states jk1ijk2i with k1\u00fe k2 < 2M, as in (13), and the length parameter is again given by (14). In this case, we also obtain a power-law dependence of \u0394E on M, although with a somewhat different power: \u0394E \u00bc 1.6393 M\u22120.987156. In what follows, we will often compare the results obtained for the supersymmetric and the bosonic Hamiltonians (6) and (4) with results for the one- and two-dimensional free Hamiltonians (16) and (17) at the same temperature and for the same Hilbert space truncation. We will see that at low temperatures the eigenstates of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) are with good precision one dimensional, and a meaningful comparison can be made with the one-dimensional free Hamiltonian (16). Similarly, the two-dimensional\n046001-4\nfree-particle Hamiltonian (17) qualitatively reproduces some features of OTOCs at early times and high temperatures, which are most likely the artifacts of a finite infrared cutoff. The largest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrices (10) and (12) also grow with M. For example, for the matrix of the bosonic Hamiltonian (10) for M \u00bc 70 and M \u00bc 100, the largest eigenvalues are Emax\u00f0M \u00bc 70\u00de \u00bc 27073.5 and Emax\u00f0M \u00bc 100\u00de \u00bc 56734.3. For the matrix of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (12), we have Emax\u00f0M \u00bc 70\u00de \u00bc 38426.4 and Emax\u00f0M \u00bc 100\u00de \u00bc 91055.4, respectively. The truncation parameterM thus provides both the infrared and the ultraviolet cutoff for the continuous Hamiltonians (4) and (6). The OTOCs appear to be not very sensitive to the ultraviolet cutoff at high energies, which allows us to obtain reliable results using only a relatively small number n \u226a M2 of lowest energy levels. On the other hand, the infrared cutoff due to the truncation to k1 \u00fe k2 \u2264 2M is crucial to obtain a numerically tractable approximation for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) with a continuous energy spectrum. As discussed in the Introduction, the flat directions x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0 of the classical Hamiltonian remain flat also for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, so the system can still escape to infinity, and at least some of the wave functions has infinite spatial extent. Our truncation of the Hilbert space to a finite number of basis states (8) with k1 \u00fe k2 \u2264 2M limits the spatial extent of wave functions, thus effectively introducing soft boundaries on spatial coordinates x1 and x2. Indeed, using at most 2M lowest harmonic oscillator eigenstates (9), we can construct wave functions with spatial extent that does not exceed hx\u03022i \u2243 2ML2. This is obvious from equalities hnjx\u03022=L2jni\u00bchnjp\u03022L2jni\u00bc hnjH\u03020jni\u00bc\u00f0n\u00fe1=2\u00de for the one-dimensional oscillator\nHamiltonian H\u03020\u00bc L 2p\u03022 2 \u00fe x\u03022\n2L2 with eigenstates (9). Hence, the subspace spanned on eigenstates with n \u2264 2M can only contain states with hx\u03022i\u2272 2ML2. Our approach is therefore similar to numerical regularization of any other unbounded system with continuous spectrum by putting it in a finite box. To illustrate how the finite values of M impose a cutoff on spatial coordinates, in Fig. 3, we show thermal expectation values hx\u030222i \u00bc Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u0302x\u030222\u00de as functions of the temperature T at different values ofM for supersymmetric, bosonic, and free one- and two-dimensional Hamiltonians (6), (4), (16), and (17). As discussed above, the data for the free one- and two-dimensional Hamiltonians (16) are used for comparison at low and high temperatures, respectively. In the high-temperature regime, we use all eigenstates of the truncated supersymmetric, bosonic, and two-dimensional free Hamiltonians (6), (4), and (17) to calculate the expectation value. In the low-temperature regime, we use only n \u226a M2 eigenstates that correspond to n lowest energy levels. We check that our values of n are big enough by comparing the results obtainedwith n and n=2 lowest energy levels, which are found to be very close to each other. Figure 3 shows that for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) as well as for the one- and two-dimensional free Hamiltonians thermal expectation values hx\u030222i \u00bc Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u0302x\u030222\u00de strongly depend on M but have weak temperature dependence. This is an expected behavior for a free particle confined within a region of spacewith size\u223c ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ML2 p determined by the infrared cutoff scale. For the free Hamiltonians (16) and (17) in one and two dimensions, the expectation values hx\u030222i are indeed reasonably close to the estimates hx\u030222i \u2248 2ML2. For the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, hx\u030222i is considerably\n046001-5\nsmaller than these estimates. This suggests that potential energy terms have a significant effect on the spatial structure of wave functions at high energies, despite the flatness of the x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0 directions. On the other hand, for the bosonic Hamiltonian (4), the expectation value hx\u030222i exhibits strong temperature dependence and significantly decreases at low temperatures. This is an expected behavior for a gapped system with localized wave functions. The dependence on the truncation parameter M is negligible for sufficiently small temperatures and only becomes important at high temperatures. Only at T \u2273 20, the expectation values hx\u030222i for the bosonic and the supersymmetric Hamiltonians (4) and (6) become reasonably close to each other and exhibit very weak temperature dependence and strong M dependence. This suggests that at such temperatures the lifting of the flat directions due to quantum effects becomes negligible for the bosonic Hamiltonian, and the infrared cutoff scale becomes important. At the same time, the effect of fermionic terms also becomes smaller, and the supersymmetric system exhibits classical chaotic dynamics that is similar to the dynamics of the bosonic Hamiltonian. Finally, we should note that the truncation of the full Hilbert space of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) to the subspace spanned by a finite number 2M\u00f0M \u00fe 1\u00de of basis states of the form (8) breaks the exact supersymmetry of the model. In particular, the equality H\u0302S \u00bc Q\u03022 is violated at the upper edge of the energy spectrum if we truncate the matrices of the Hamiltonian H\u0302S and the supersymmetry generator Q\u0302 to have finite dimensions. In practice, we find that all the energy levels of H\u0302S remain positive upon the truncation, so the truncation preserves the cancellation of the negative unbounded terms in the fermionic operators in H\u0302S. Furthermore, the effect of truncation becomes negligible for thermal expectation values in the limit of largeM, as antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions on the thermal circle break supersymmetry anyway, and the upper edge of the spectrum is suppressed at finite temperatures. Exact supersymmetry also implies that the ground state of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian should not be doubly degenerate, in contrast to all higher energy levels. On the other hand, with our truncation of the Hilbert space, all energy levels are doubly degenerate, as discussed in detail in Appendix A. Since the energy spectrum of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian is continuous (which we recover in the limit M \u2192 0), there are infinitely many energy levels that are infinitely close to the ground state, and a single nondegenerate energy level should likewise have a vanishing contribution to thermal expectation values."

            "text": "Preparing to consider out-of-time-order correlators, in this section, we consider the spectral properties of the\nsupersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) and compare them with those of the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) and the free one- and two-dimensional Hamiltonians (16) and (17) (at low and high temperatures, respectively). We start with the global distribution of energy levels. For both the supersymmetric and the bosonic Hamiltonians, histogramming all eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrices (10) and (12) suggests that the level density dn\u00f0E\u00dedE falls off as 1=E. However, this analysis is not very informative, as all of the interesting low-lying eigenvalues are counted within a single near-zero bin. To properly resolve the distribution of eigenvalues at all scales, we analyze the histograms of log\u00f0E\u00de. Such histograms approximate the distributions dn\u00f0E\u00ded log\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc E dn\u00f0E\u00dedE and are shown in Fig. 4 in the logarithmic scale. The log-scale histograms reveal two different scaling regimes of the level density. At high energies with log\u00f0E\u00de \u2273 5 (or, equivalently, E\u2273 150), dn\u00f0E\u00ded log\u00f0E\u00de appears to be almost constant up to the sharp UV cutoff. This corresponds to the density of energy levels dn\u00f0E\u00dedE \u223c E \u22121 that does not contain any dimensionful parameter. On the other hand, at low energies, all the histogram plots have an almost constant slope in our double log scale, which corresponds to the power-law scaling of the form dn\u00f0E\u00ded log\u00f0E\u00de \u223c E\u03b1 \u00bc e\u03b1 log\u00f0E\u00de or, equivalently, log\ndn\u00f0E\u00de d log\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc \u03b1 log\u00f0E\u00de. It is\ninstructive to compare our results with the scaling law\ndn\u00f0E\u00de d log\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc E dn\u00f0E\u00de dE\n\u223c ffiffiffi E p \u00f018\u00de\nfor the one-dimensional free Hamiltonian (16), where dn \u223c dp \u223c d ffiffiffi E p . On the other hand, for the two-dimensional\n046001-6\nfree Hamiltonian (17), the number of states is dn\u223c 2\u03c0pdp \u223c dE, which leads to the linear scaling\ndn\u00f0E\u00de d log\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc E dn\u00f0E\u00de dE \u223c E: \u00f019\u00de\nFrom Fig. 4, we can see that for small E the slopes of the histogram plots for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian are quite close to that for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16) withM \u00bc 100 andM \u00bc 800. AsM is increased, in both cases, the histograms are shifted toward lower energies. This is our first argument in favor of effectively one-dimensional, gapless structure of low-lying eigenstates of the supersymmetricmodel. For the bosonic Hamiltonian, low-lying energy levels remain discrete even forM \u2192 \u221e. Correspondingly, the histogram is shifted toward larger E and has a steeper slope. To get further insight into the structure of eigenstates of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian at different energy scales, in Fig. 5, we show density plots of some of the wave functions obtained with the truncation parameter M \u00bc 70. In the plot labels, we give the corresponding values of energy as well as the squared norms j\u03d5\u00f0x1; x2\u00dej2 and j\u03c7\u00f0x1; x2\u00dej2 of the two components of the wave function \u03a8\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc f\u03d5\u00f0x1; x2\u00de; \u03c7\u00f0x1; x2\u00deg. Both squared norms add up to 1 by virtue of normalization. We see that the low-energy states are indeed strongly localized along the flat directions x1 \u00bc 0, x2 \u00bc 0 of the potential energy. The number of times the wave functions change sign along the direction of their maximal extent coincides with the\nserial number of the energy level, which is also an argument in favor of effectively one-dimensional structure. It might seem that the \u201cT-shape\u201d structure of the functions \u03d5\u00f0x1; x2\u00de violates the parity symmetry of the model. However, here, we only show the results for the eigenstates with positive x1 parity (see Appendix B). Eigenstates with negative x1 parity will have the T shape turned upside down, so the full parity symmetry will be restored in the sum over both parity sectors. It turns out that the OTOCs of operators x\u03022 and p\u03022 take exactly the same values in both x1 parity sectors, and henceforth, we onlyworkwith eigenstates of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian with positive x1 parity. To get further insight into quantum chaos exhibited by the bosonic and supersymmetric Hamiltonians (4) and (6), it is useful to analyze microscopic correlations between energy levels. Quantum chaos is usually characterized by the repulsion between adjacent energy levels. This repulsion forces the energy level spacings \u0394Ei \u00bc Ei\u00fe1 \u2212 Ei to have one of the few universal statistical distributions, which correspond to ensembles of Gaussian unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic random matrices. For Hamiltonians without any quenched disorder, such analysis assumes that energy levels far away from the edges of the spectrum can be considered as quasirandom quantities belonging to a statistical ensemble. A convenient measure of level repulsion associated with quantum chaos is the r ratio [41,42]\nri \u00bc min\u00f0\u0394Ei\u22121;\u0394Ei\u00de max\u00f0\u0394Ei\u22121;\u0394Ei\u00de : \u00f020\u00de\n046001-7\nFor the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) of random real symmetric matrices, the statistical average of ri over many energy levels in the bulk of the spectrum (or, equivalently, over many random matrices) is rGOE \u00bc 0.53. On the other hand, for nonchaotic integrable systems, the energy levels are typically uncorrelated. Correspondingly, the number of energy levels within a fixed interval is usually well described by Poisson distribution [43], and the average of ri over many energy levels is close to rPoisson \u00bc 0.39. For Hamiltonians that are invariant under a nontrivial symmetry group, the level spacings \u0394Ei \u00bc Ei\u00fe1 \u2212 Ei that enter the r ratio (20) should be the differences between consecutive energy levels that correspond to eigenstates transforming under the same irrep of the symmetry group. In other words, we make an ordered list of eigenstates that transform under some fixed irrep of the symmetry group, label the elements of this list by consecutive integer indices i, and calculate the r ratio for the elements of this list. As discussed in detail in Appendix A, the bosonic Hamiltonian is invariant under a finite non-Abelian group C4v with four Abelian and one non-Abelian irreps [44,45]. The supersymmetric Hamiltonian is invariant under a larger finite non-Abelian group D4d with four Abelian and three non-Abelian irreps [46,47]. For our analysis of the r ratio for the bosonic Hamiltonian (4), we select the energy levels that transform under the two-dimensional non-Abelian irrep E0 of C4v. For the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6), the eigenstates belong to one of the two-dimensional nonAbelian irreps E1 or E2 of D4d, so we pick the states that transform under E1. For comparison, we also calculate the r ratio for the free two-dimensional Hamiltonian (17) with the same Hilbert space truncation. While the symmetry group of this free Hamiltonian is the full O\u00f02\u00de group, the energy levels can still be classified according to irreps of C4v, which is a subgroup ofO\u00f02\u00de. To calculate the r ratio in this case, we use energy levels that transform under irrep E0 of C4v. Scatter plots of ri versus the energy Ei are shown in Fig. 6. For the truncation parameter M \u00bc 100, we show all eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrices (10) and (12). For M \u2265 500, we use between 200 and 800 smallest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrices (10) and (12) obtained using the Arnoldi algorithm. To set the stage, we first discuss the results for the purely bosonic Hamiltonian (4), shown in the top plot in Fig. 6. In this case, lowest energy levels that transform under E0 irrep are of order of 101, and for energies E\u2273 102, the r ratio is fluctuating almost randomly between 0 and 1, filling the entire plot area almost uniformly. This is the expected behavior for a system that is chaotic in this energy range, both in quantum and in classical mechanics. Averaging ri over many energy levels in the window between E \u00bc 102.5 \u2248 316.2 and E \u00bc 103.5 \u2248 3162.3, we obtain the value r \u00bc 0.523 0.006 that is very close to the universal value rGOE \u00bc 0.53 for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble.\nThis expectation value as well as the extent of the energy window for which it was obtained are shown in Fig. 6. In full agreement with previous studies [32,33], we therefore conclude that the energy spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) exhibits chaotic behavior at least for energies of order E\u2273 101\u2026102.\n046001-8\nFor energies E\u2273 102, the behavior of the r ratio for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) appears to be very similar to the one for the bosonic Hamiltonian (4). Namely, the r ratio also fluctuates randomly between 0 and 1, averaging to r\u0304 \u00bc 0.530 0.004 in the same window of energies E \u00bc 102.5\u2026103.5 that we considered for the bosonic Hamiltonian. The behavior for the lowenergy part of the spectrum is, however, completely different. There is a family of low-lying energy levels with E\u2272 100.5 \u2248 3.2 for which the r ratio ri behaves in a smooth and regular way as a function of energy Ei, rising from ri \u2248 0.5 up to ri \u2248 1.0. This behavior is observed in the energy range that agrees well with the extent of the low-energy \u201ctail\u201d with dnd log\u00f0E\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffi E p in histograms of global energy level density in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the change between the nonchaotic low-energy states and the chaotic high-energy states, where the r ratio approaches unit value, appears to be quite sharp. Such a smooth rising behavior of the r ratio can be expected for finite-size one-dimensional systems. As we show in Fig. 7, the dependence of the energy levels Ei on their serial number i with a good precision can be described by a quadratic expression,\nEi \u00bc a\u00fe b\u00f0i\u00fe c\u00de2; i \u00bc 0; 1; 2;\u2026; \u00f021\u00de\nwhich leads to\nri \u00bc i\u00fe c\u00fe 1=2 i\u00fe c\u00fe 3=2 : \u00f022\u00de\nSolid lines in the middle plot in Fig. 6 correspond to the expression (22) plotted as a function of Ei given by (21). The parameters a, b, and c are extracted from the fits\nshown in Fig. 7. We find that the best fit parameters b are with good precision inversely proportional to the truncation parameter M. The parameter a is very small, and the shift parameter c quite quickly grows with M: c \u00bc 0.79 for M \u00bc 100, c \u00bc 1.40 for M \u00bc 500, and c \u00bc 4.05 for M \u00bc 800. For a few lowest eigenstates, small deviations of data points that are hardly noticeable in Fig. 7 get amplified (compare thin lines with low-energy data points in the middle plot in Fig. 6), and our fits appear to be not as good as for somewhat larger energies with Ei < 1. It is instructive to compare these findings with similar analysis for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16). In this case, b is also inversely proportional to M, and the fit parameters a \u2248 0.25 and c \u2248 1 are almost independent of M. Another instructive case is a one-dimensional, infinitely deep potential well of width L, for which Ei \u00bc \u03c0 2\u00f0i\u00fe1\u00de2 L2 and ri \u00bc 2i\u00fe12i\u00fe3 are completely independent of L. Strong dependence of the parameter c on the infrared cutoff set by the parameter M for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) is quite different from these one-dimensional models. For one-dimensional models, this parameter is controlled by boundary conditions at the end points of the region to which one-dimensional motion is effectively confined. It is interesting to note that for the supersymmetric system the change between the regular, quasi-onedimensional spectrum and the chaotic, random-matrix-like spectrum can be also observed from the ordering of irreps under which the eigenstates transform. Namely, for the low-energy part of the spectrum, eigenstates with even and odd serial numbers transform under the non-Abelian irreps E1 and E2 of D4d, respectively. For energies above some threshold level, this ordering is violated, and now and then, there appear several eigenstates in a row that transform under one and the same irrep. For M \u00bc 100, we show the position of the first ordering irregularity of this kind in the middle plot in Fig. 6 with a vertical dashed thick line. For comparison, on the plot in the bottom of Fig. 6, we show the energy dependence of the r ratio (20) for the free two-dimensional Hamiltonian (17), subject to the same truncation as the supersymmetric and bosonic Hamiltonians (6) and (4). Here, all the energies are significantly smaller than for the interacting systems. While the ri ratio does exhibit some quasirandom behavior toward the higher end of the spectrum, averaging ri over the energy window between E\u00bc100.5\u22483.16 and E\u00bc101.5\u224831.6, we obtain r\u0304 \u00bc 0.40 0.01, in good agreementwith the expected value r \u00bc 0.39 for spectra of integrable systems with Poisson distribution of energy levels."

In particular, if the finite-temperature two-point correlators Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u0302x\u03022\u00f0t\u00dep\u03022\u00f00\u00de\u00de decay sufficiently quickly with time t, F0\u00f0t\u00de is expected to approach a constant value f0 \u00bc 2hp\u030222irhx\u030222ir, where hO\u03022ir \u00bc Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u0302 1 2O\u0302\u03c1\u0302 1 2O\u0302\u00de is a regularized thermal expectation value [2,48]. The functions F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de, calculated according to (24), are plotted in Fig. 8 for different Hamiltonians and for different values of the truncation parameter M. Free oneand two-dimensional Hamiltonians are used for comparisons at low and at high temperatures, respectively. The temperatures are T \u00bc 0.2 and T \u00bc 20.0 for the plots on the left and on the right, which are well in the low- and hightemperature regimes. As discussed above, our truncation imposes an infrared cutoff, limiting the system size to hx\u03022i \u2272 2ML2 and hence regularizing the flat directions x1 \u00bc 0 and x2 \u00bc 0 of the classical and the supersymmetric Hamiltonians. For the free one- and two-dimensional Hamiltonians (16), the truncation parameter M effectively puts our free particle in a box\nof size \u223c ffiffiffiffiffi M p L. It is therefore not surprising that in Fig. 8 we observe a strong dependence of the correlators F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de on the truncation parameter M for all Hamiltonians and at all temperatures. The only exception is the lowtemperature regime of the bosonic Hamiltonian, where only strongly localized wave functions contribute, and the effect of infrared cutoff is negligible. To some extent, theM dependence of the OTOCs C\u00f0t\u00de is due to the strong M dependence of regularized thermal expectation values hx\u030222ir and hp\u030222ir. As discussed above, the asymptotic values of the time-ordered correlator F0\u00f0t\u00de and the OTOCs C\u00f0t\u00de are proportional to the product of these two thermal expectation values. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the expectation value hx\u030222ir grows linearly withM as M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e, and F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de exhibit similar growth. Except for the case of the bosonic Hamiltonian at low temperatures, on all plots in Fig. 8, we observe the main expected features of F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de: the two correlators are very close to each other at t \u00bc 0 and diverge at later times. Exhibiting some initial oscillations, the function F0\u00f0t\u00de approaches a constant value, while F\u00f0t\u00de keeps decreasing. Furthermore, we see that, as a result of our Hilbert space truncation, the correlators F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de do exhibit the same characteristic features of OTOC growth even for the free-particle Hamiltonians (16) and (17). Clearly, for freeparticle Hamiltonians without any truncation of the Hilbert space, the OTOC is just constant:\nC\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u2212h\u00bdx\u0302\u00f0t\u00de; p\u0302\u00f00\u00de 2i \u00bc \u2212h\u00bdx\u0302\u00f00\u00de \u00fe 2p\u0302\u00f00\u00det; p\u0302\u00f00\u00de 2i \u00bc h\u00bdx\u0302\u00f00\u00de; p\u0302\u00f00\u00de 2i \u00bc 1: \u00f025\u00de\nTherefore, any nontrivial time dependence of OTOCs for the free-particle Hamiltonians (16) and (17) is a truncation artifact at finite M. The timescales characterizing the time dependence of F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de appear to be not too different for the free-particle and the supersymmetric cases. This could be expected based on our previous observation that lowenergy eigenstates with a finite infrared cutoff are quite similar to the ones for a free particle in a finite onedimensional box. The fact that even a free particle can exhibit OTOC growth in the presence of spatial boundaries was also noted in Ref. [20]. For this reason, our strategy will be to carefully extrapolate the OTOCs growth rates to the limit M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e in order to distinguish the behavior of OTOCs for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian and the freeparticle one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16) (see Fig. 11 for the final results). In most cases, however, we also observe significant deviations from the expected behavior of F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de: except for the high-temperature regime of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, the late-time value of F0\u00f0t\u00de is noticeably different from the product f0 \u00bc 2hp\u030222irhx\u030222ir of 4We use the operators x\u03022 and p\u03022 because they are invariant with respect to x1 parity transformations (reflections of x1). We use x1 parity to block diagonalize the matrix (12) of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) and reduce the computational cost of exact diagonalization (see Appendix B). The OTOCs of the operators x\u03021 and p\u03021 are, of course, equivalent to that of x\u03022 and p\u03022 but are more complicated to calculate with our choice of the basis states.\n046001-10\nthermal expectation values. This suggests that our lowdimensional Hamiltonians are not entirely ergodic, and some kind of regular motion prevents the finite-temperature correlators of the form Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u0302x\u03022\u00f0t\u00dep\u03022\u00f00\u00de\u00de from decaying sufficiently quickly. This is expectable for a system with just a few degrees of freedom. For example, such a finitetemperature correlator would exhibit oscillations instead of decay for a harmonic oscillator or a two-level system. In fact, the functions F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de calculated at low temperatures with the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) provide a\nnice example of such an oscillatory behavior (middle left plot in Fig. 8). Since the energy spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian is discrete (and hence gapped), only the two lowest energy levels will contribute to OTOCs for sufficiently low temperatures. This results in nondecaying oscillations of OTOCs and other correlators, as illustrated in the middle left plot in Fig. 8. Interestingly, even though the bosonic and the supersymmetric Hamiltonian are both expected to be chaotic at high temperatures, only for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian,\n046001-11\nthe late-time asymptotic value of F0\u00f0t\u00de agrees with f0 \u00bc 2hp\u030222irhx\u030222ir (see the upper right plot in Fig. 8). As one can see in the middle right plot in Fig. 8, for the bosonic Hamiltonian, the function F0\u00f0t\u00de at large t has a noticeable deviation from f0 even at T \u00bc 20. This difference might be related to the observation that only for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian the OTOCs exhibit an expected agreement with classical dynamics at high temperatures. In contrast, for the bosonic Hamiltonian, we never observe good agreement between quantum OTOCs and classical Lyapunov distances. This is demonstrated in Fig. 10 and explained in more details below. For large-N gauge theories and matrix models, F\u00f0t\u00de is expected to behave as F\u00f0t\u00de \u2248 f0 \u2212 ce2\u03bbt for sufficiently late times t at which F0\u00f0t\u00de is already sufficiently close to its expected asymptotic value f0 [2,48]. Clearly, with F0\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc f0 and F\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc f0 \u2212 ce2\u03bbt, we immediately get an exponential OTOC growth C\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc F0\u00f0t\u00de \u2212 F\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ce2\u03bbt, with \u03bb being the Lyapunov exponent. Such growth, however, cannot continue forever, and at even later times, F\u00f0t\u00de approaches zero and stops decreasing. Correspondingly, the OTOC C\u00f0t\u00de saturates at a value close to f0 [48].\nFor our numerical data, we indeed see how F\u00f0t\u00de decreases toward zero in all cases except for the lowtemperature limit of the bosonic Hamiltonian. However, we cannot identify any clear exponential decay of F\u00f0t\u00de of the form f0 \u2212 ce2\u03bbt. In the low-temperature regime of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, the late-time decay of F\u00f0t\u00de seems to be linear in t (see upper left plot in Fig. 8). Such behavior is even more obvious for the one-dimensional free-particle Hamiltonian5 (16); see the lower left plot in Fig. 8. At high temperatures, the decay of F\u00f0t\u00de toward zero is faster than at low temperatures, but it is still difficult to identify a region with a clear exponential decay. We illustrate the time dependence of the OTOCs C\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc F0\u00f0t\u00de \u2212 F\u00f0t\u00de in Fig. 9, comparing the results obtained with\n\u2202x2\u00f00\u00de\u00de\n2i of the squared classical Lyapunov distance calculated at the same temperature. For the\nplots at T \u00bc 0.2, the legend also shows the number n of lowest eigenstates that were used to calculate C\u00f0t\u00de.\n5In fact, for the one-dimensional free-particle Hamiltonian, the linearly decreasing function F\u00f0t\u00de rebounces after approaching zero and exhibits a linear growth until approaching f0. This behavior resembles a classical motion of a particle that bounces between the two walls of a one-dimensional potential well. In our case, a one-dimensional particle is confined to an interval of finite width because of the truncation of Hilbert space, which limits the coordinate values to hx\u03022i < 2ML2.\n046001-12\nthe supersymmetric and the bosonic Hamiltonians (6) and (4) and with the free-particle one- and two-dimensional Hamiltonians. Figure 9 shows that in all cases the OTOCs grow and eventually saturate. The growth rate appears to be nonuniform. In particular, for sufficiently high temperatures T \u2273 1 and at early times, all OTOCs exhibit some initial decrease. Also, for the bosonic Hamiltonian, the OTOCs feature some oscillations at T \u2272 1, which become stronger and completely dominate the OTOCs at lower temperatures (see the middle left plot in Fig. 8). A common expectation is that for sufficiently high temperatures the real-time dynamics of the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) can be described in terms of the corresponding classical equations ofmotion x\u03081\u00bc\u22124x1x22, x\u03082 \u00bc \u22124x2x21. This statement is also expected to apply to the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6), for which the role of \u201cfermionic\u201d terms should become negligible at high temperatures. To check whether this is indeed the case, we also compare our quantum data for T \u2265 1 with the classical analog of OTOCs. It is defined as a square of the relevant Poisson bracket fx2\u00f0t\u00de; p2\u00f00\u00deg \u00bc \u2202x2\u00f0t\u00de\u2202x2\u00f00\u00de, averaged over the thermal distribution of the initial conditions fx1\u00f00\u00de; x2\u00f00\u00de; p1\u00f00\u00de; p2\u00f00\u00deg for the classical evolution:\nCcl\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\n\u2202x2\u00f0t\u00de \u2202x2\u00f00\u00de 2 : \u00f026\u00de\nThe calculation of Ccl\u00f0t\u00de is discussed in more details in Appendix C. For T \u00bc 5 and T \u00bc 1, Ccl\u00f0t\u00de is plotted in Fig. 9 with a solid black line. Quantum OTOCs only appear to be reasonably close to Ccl\u00f0t\u00de for the case of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) at sufficiently high temperature. At T \u00bc 1, the OTOCs for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian and the classical OTOCs are only close to each other for a short initial period of time t\u2272 1. The agreement is somewhat better at T \u00bc 5, where the classical and the quantum OTOCs are reasonably close to each other for t\u2272 1.5. In both cases, the OTOCs exhibit some initial decrease and start growing at t\u2273 0.5. Interestingly, the agreement between the classical and the quantum OTOCs is lost exactly when the classical OTOCs enter the regime of clear exponential growth at t\u2273 1.5. For these times, the quantum OTOCs grows considerably slower. On the other hand, our data suggest that OTOCs calculated with the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) are never quite close to the classical OTOCs. This agrees with the observation made in Ref. [20] that the classical limit is never reached for four-point OTOCs in simple quantum mechanical systems because quantum interference effects become important earlier than the exponential OTOC growth sets in. The fact that for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian we get a considerably better agreement with the classical dynamics suggests that supersymmetry might effectively suppress or cancel out the wave packet spread that is responsible for deviations from classical behavior [20].\nOverall, our plots for the quantum OTOCs do not show regions of clear exponential growth that would be similar to the exponential divergence of the classical Lyapunov distance Ccl\u00f0t\u00de. It is not surprising, as the exponential OTOCs growth is in general very difficult to detect for finite-size systems amenable to exact diagonalization studies [8], even for the renowned SYK model which is a paradigmatic example of maximal quantum chaos [16]. We do, however, see a clear difference in the low-temperature behavior of the OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) with gapped energy spectrum and for the supersymmetric and free Hamiltonians which all have continuous energy spectra in the limit M \u2192 0. For the bosonic Hamiltonian, the spectrum is discrete, and OTOCs are oscillatory at low temperatures. For the supersymmetric and free Hamiltonians, OTOCs grow with time down to the lowest temperatures, although this growth is much slower than for the classical dynamics. Furthermore, there is also an observable difference between the behavior of low-temperature OTOCs for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian and the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. The latter has more nontrivial features and a weaker dependence on the truncation parameter M. To arrive at some estimates for the growth rate of OTOCs in the absence of clear exponential growth, we consider the time derivative of the logarithm of the OTOC C\u00f0t\u00de,\n\u03bb\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1 2 d dt log\u00f0C\u00f0t\u00de\u00de; \u00f027\u00de\nwhich should be equal the Lyapunov exponent \u03bb if C\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ce2\u03bbt. The time dependence of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de is shown in Fig. 10. At low temperatures, we again compare the data for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) and the free onedimensional Hamiltonian (16). At high temperatures, we compare the results for the bosonic, the supersymmetric, and the free two-dimensional Hamiltonians as well as with the classical result \u03bbcl\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 12 ddt log\u00f0Ccl\u00f0t\u00de\u00de. At all temperatures, the functions \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de feature a number of peaks and sometimes plateaus. The peaks are labeled by \u201cx\u201d or \u201co\u201d symbols, where x is used for peaks that we believe to be dominant/most important features of OTOCs for a particular Hamiltonian and o is used for the peaks that we believe to be subdominant or artifact. Plateaus are labeled by vertical lines and a letter \u201cP.\u201d We will use these peak values of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de, denoted as \u03bbmax, as upper bound estimates on the values of Lyapunov exponent in our system. Since we observe qualitatively different behavior at low and at high temperatures, let us separately discuss the main features of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de in these regimes."

            "text": "At sufficiently high temperatures, real-time dynamics of both the supersymmetric and the bosonic Hamiltonians is expected to reduce to the classical dynamics. Qualitatively, this regime corresponds to the range of energies E\u2273 10, for\n046001-13\nwhich the energy levels behave similarly to the ones of GOE of random matrices. In this case, we use truncation parameters M \u00bc 70 and M \u00bc 100, finding all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the corresponding truncated matrices (12) or (10). At very high temperatures, the correspondence with the classical dynamics might be violated due to our truncations of the full Hilbert space. As we have already discussed above, we were not able to\nidentify a regime where the OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian would approach the classical OTOCs (see Appendix C) sufficiently closely. As conjectured in Ref. [20], this might be a generic feature of simple quantum mechanical systems. The data shown in Fig. 10 for T \u2273 1 support these observations. We find a limited agreement between the classical and the quantum data only for the case of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian at moderately\n046001-14\nlarge temperatures, 5\u2272 T \u2272 20; see the middle right and the bottom left plots in Fig. 10. The agreement is observed for 0.1\u2272 t\u2272 1.5 at T \u00bc 5 and for 0.5\u2272 t\u2272 1 at T \u00bc 20; thus, the time range of quantum-classical correspondence shrinks toward high temperatures. Both for T \u00bc 5 and T \u00bc 20, \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de has a distinct peak roughly at the time at which its classical counterpart \u03bbcl\u00f0t\u00de approaches its plateau value that corresponds to a steady exponential growth of Ccl\u00f0t\u00de. We believe that this peak is a physical feature of a supersymmetric model; therefore, we label it with the x symbol in the plots with T \u00bc 5 and T \u00bc 20 in Fig. 10. Its height is comparable with the plateau value of \u03bbcl\u00f0t\u00de, and its position scales approximately as t\u22c6 \u223c T\u22121=2. This characteristic \u201csemiclassical\u201d peak of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de exists also at lower temperatures, down to T \u223c 1, but the agreement with classical dynamics is gradually lost. A similar peak structure (labeled with x in Fig. 10) exists also for the bosonic Hamiltonian at moderately large temperatures 1\u2272 T \u2272 10, but the agreement with the classical dynamics is nowhere sufficiently good. Interestingly, as one can see on the plot with T \u00bc 5, the data for the bosonic and the supersymmetric Hamiltonians agree very well after both peaks, where \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de disagree with \u03bbcl\u00f0t\u00de for both Hamiltonians. These moderate-temperature peaks of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de are completely absent for the free two-dimensional Hamiltonian and appear to be a genuine feature of high-temperature, semiclassical chaotic dynamics. At very high temperatures T \u2273 20, both the bosonic and the supersymmetric Hamiltonians develop very large peaks of height \u03bbmax \u223c T at early times t \u223c T\u22121, labeled with o for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. For the bosonic Hamiltonian, this early-time peak seems to continuously transform into the peak near the plateau onset of \u03bbcl\u00f0t\u00de and is therefore labeled with x. The free two-dimensional Hamiltonian also exhibits a very similar peak, labeled with x in Fig. 10. In contrast to the semiclassical peak discussed above, these early-time peaks appear to have strong dependence on the truncation parameter M for all Hamiltonians. The existence of similar peaks in functions \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de for free Hamiltonians as well as the strong M dependence of their heights suggest that such early-time peaks are the artifacts of the infrared cutoff due to the Hilbert space truncation. At sufficiently high temperatures T \u2273 50, these early-time peaks completely dominate the OTOCs, and any agreement with the classical dynamics is lost both for the bosonic and the supersymmetric Hamiltonians."

            "heading": "B. Low temperatures",
            "text": "At low temperatures T \u2272 1, the dynamics of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) is dominated by nearly onedimensional, regular wave functions, as illustrated in Fig. 5. We therefore compare the OTOCs for the supersymmetric model with the ones for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16). The OTOCs for the bosonic Hamiltonian\nat low temperatures only exhibit oscillations similar to the ones in the middle left plot in Fig. 8, and we do not consider them. Likewise, comparison with the classical dynamics makes little sense at low temperatures due to the dominance of quantum effects. The functions \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de for the supersymmetric and the free one-dimensional systems at a low temperature T \u00bc 0.2 are shown in the two top plots in Fig. 10 for different values of the truncation parameter M. For the supersymmetric case, \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de develops a plateau (labeled with P in the top left plot in Fig. 10) followed by the two peaks (labeled with x and o). Analyzing the data for the supersymmetric system at different temperatures, we found that the height of the early-time plateau is roughly proportional to the temperature T and its width scales as \u223cT\u22121. We also checked that the large-M extrapolation of the plateau height \u03bbP using the ansatz \u03bbP \u00bc A\u00fe B=M yields a finite result at M \u2192 \u221e. The fact that \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de reaches a plateau means that for this time range the growth of OTOCs is with a good precision exponential. However, a comparison with the behavior of the functions F\u00f0t\u00de and F0\u00f0t\u00de, shown in the top left plot in Fig. 8, shows that this growth happens well before the function F0\u00f0t\u00de reaches its constant asymptotic value. In fact, even the positions of both subsequent peaks of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de correspond to much earlier times than the saturation of F0\u00f0t\u00de. We conclude that, whatever time range we choose to define the quantum Lyapunov exponent for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, we cannot find agreement with the expected behavior of the functions F\u00f0t\u00de, F0\u00f0t\u00de, and C\u00f0t\u00de in large-N systems, where C\u00f0t\u00de only grows exponentially when F0\u00f0t\u00de saturates. This is not surprising, as there is no natural large parameter like N for our supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6). The heights of the two peaks of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de, labeled with x and o in the top left plot in Fig. 10, can be used as upper bounds on the rate of exponential OTOCs growth for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. While both peaks are changing considerably as the truncation parameter M is increasing, the dependence on M appears to be significantly stronger for the second, subdominant, peak (labeled with o). The dependence of the peak height on M is reasonably well described by the formula \u03bbmax \u00bc A\u00fe B=M, and extrapolations toM \u2192 \u00fe\u221e yield the results for \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00bc A that are close to zero. It is therefore likely that this second peak is a truncation artifact. On the other hand, the first, dominant peak of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de (labeled with x in the top left plot in Fig. 10) has a weaker dependence onM and might well present a physical feature of OTOCs in the supersymmetric case, together with the plateau that precedes it. The position of this peak scales approximately as t\u22c6 \u00bc T\u22121=2. We base our final estimates of the upper bound on low-temperature quantum Lyapunov exponents in the supersymmetric case on the height \u03bbmax of this peak. It is therefore important to ensure that this peak is a physical feature and not an artifact.\n046001-15\nTo this end, we consider two different methods to extrapolate \u03bbmax to M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e. The first method, illustrated in the top left plot in Fig. 11, is to perform extrapolations to M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e separately for each value of the temperature. To this end, we use least-squares fits to two different models:\n\u03bbmax\u00f0M\u00de \u00bc \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00fe B M\n\u00f028\u00de\n\u03bbmax\u00f0M\u00de \u00bc \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00fe Bffiffiffiffiffi M p ; \u00f029\u00de\nWe estimate the extrapolation errors in the values \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de by considering their variation upon the removal of data points with either the smallest or the largest values ofM from the fit. These bounds are shown in the top plots in Fig. 11 as shaded areas around lines that correspond to the fits with all data points. Let us stress that, since our data come from exact diagonalization, the numbers are not plagued with any statistical uncertainties. To highlight the difference between the behavior of OTOCs for the supersymmetric and the free one-dimensional Hamiltonians, in the top right plot in Fig. 11, we also show similar extrapolations for the maximal value \u03bbmax of the function \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16).\nFor this Hamiltonian, the function \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de has two distinct peaks with strong dependence onM. The first peak, denoted by o in the top right plot in Fig. 10, corresponds to very early times, much earlier than the plateau onset for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. It has no direct counterpart in the supersymmetric case, and we do not consider it in detail. On the other hand, the position of the second peak, labeled with x in the top right plot in Fig. 10, is between the twopeaks of the function \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de obtained with the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. The height \u03bbmax of this peak is comparable to the maximal values of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. We therefore use its height \u03bbmax as an upper bound for Lyapunov exponent for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16) with truncated Hilbert space and illustrate the M dependence of \u03bbmax in Fig. 11. From the top left plot in Fig. 11, we see that for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian the extrapolations using both fits (28) and (29) yield nonzero results. The results of linear extrapolations in 1=M (28) are expectably higher than for the square-root extrapolations. Fit uncertainties appear to be not very large. The resulting temperature dependence of the extrapolated values \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de is illustrated in the bottom left plot in Fig. 11 with black points and solid and dashed black lines. With the linear extrapolation\np\n, respectively. Shaded areas\naround these lines show error estimates obtained by excluding the data points with either smallest or largest value of M from the fits.\n046001-16\nmodel (28), this dependence appears to be approximately linear. Namely, a fit of \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e; T\u00dewith the function \u03b1T\u03b3 yields \u03b3 \u00bc 0.826 (solid black line), close to the linear scaling of the Lyapunov exponent with temperature, \u03bb\u00f0T\u00de \u223c T. With the square root extrapolation model (29), the same power-law fit yields \u03b3 \u00bc 0.520 (dashed line), thus favoring the dependence of the form \u03bb\u00f0T\u00de \u223c ffiffiffiTp . The square root extrapolation model in fact yields somewhat smaller values of squared deviations \u03c72=d:o:f:, but not significantly smaller. For the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian, the extrapolations using the square root model (29) yield the results that are either compatible with zero or negative; see the top right plot in Fig. 11. Extrapolations with the linear model (29) yield finite results which are, however, significantly smaller than the corresponding extrapolated values for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. Squared deviations \u03c72=d:o:f: appear to be considerably smaller for the square root model (29). The resulting temperature dependence of the extrapolated values \u03bbmax is shown in the bottom right plot in Fig. 11 with black points and solid black [for the linear extrapolations (28)] and dashed [for the square root extrapolations (29)] lines. Another strategy to estimate the temperature dependence of the maximal values of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de in the limitM \u2192 \u00fe\u221e is to fit the temperature dependence of \u03bbmax at fixed M with a suitable fitting function and to extrapolate the parameters of this fit to M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e afterward. For each fixed M, the temperature dependence of \u03bbmax for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian is with a good precision linear. We therefore fit \u03bbmax at fixedM to the linear function \u03bbmax\u00f0M;T\u00de \u00bc A\u00f0M\u00deT of the temperature T. In turn, the dependence of the fit parameter A\u00f0M\u00de on M can be well fitted by the formula A\u00f0M\u00de \u00bc A\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00fe B=M, which yields the extrapolated value A\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00bc 0.05. The resulting extrapolation of \u03bbmax\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e; T\u00de is shown in the lower left plot in Fig. 11 with a solid green line, together with the values of \u03bbmax at each finite M and the linear fits \u03bbmax\u00f0M;T\u00de \u00bc A\u00f0M\u00deT thereof. Applying the same procedure to the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian, we find that in this case the data for \u03bbmax\u00f0M;T\u00de at fixedM can be sufficientlywell fitted to the functionA ffiffiffi T p . In this case, theM dependence of the fit parameter A\u00f0M\u00de is better described by the formula A\u00f0M\u00de \u00bc A\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00fe B= ffiffiffiffiffi M p , rather than A\u00f0M\u00de \u00bc A\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de \u00fe B=M. Using the former formula to extrapolate the fit parameter to M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e, we find a small negative result. The resulting function A\u00f0M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e\u00de ffiffiffiTp is shown in the bottom right plot in Fig. 11 as a solid green line. Remarkably, it agrees well with the result of M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e extrapolations at fixed temperatures, described above. This agreement suggests that the nonchaotic behavior of OTOCs for the free one-dimensional Hamiltonian (16) is indeed recovered as the limitM \u2192 \u00fe\u221e is taken and the Hilbert space truncation is removed. This is in stark contrast with the case of the supersymmetric\nHamiltonian (6), for which all our extrapolation methods yield a positive and finite value of the OTOC growth rate in the limit M \u2192 \u00fe\u221e. Finally, we illustrate the temperature dependence of all our estimates of \u03bbmax as a function of temperature in Fig. 12. We show the data obtained for all values of the truncation parameter M and use more opaque lines to distinguish larger values of M. To avoid any extrapolation ambiguities, in this plot, we do not show any extrapolations, only the actual numerical data for finite M values. Different line colors correspond to different Hamiltonians. The data points for the peak values of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de that we believe to be most important for each model are labeled with x symbols. o symbols denote the peak values for either artifact or subdominant but nevertheless prominent maxima. The same x or o symbols are used to label the corresponding peaks of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de in Fig. 10."

            "text": "In this work, we considered the simplest supersymmetric extension H\u0302S \u00bc H\u0302B \u2297 I \u00fe x\u03021 \u2297 \u03c31 \u00fe x\u03022 \u2297 \u03c33 of the bosonic Hamiltonian H\u0302B \u00bc p\u030221 \u00fe p\u030222 \u00fe x\u030221x\u030222. The latter is known to feature both quantum and classical chaos and is closely related to the Hamiltonian of spatially compactified pure SU\u00f02\u00de Yang-Mills theory. We focused on the energy\n046001-17\nlevel statistics and out-of-time order correlators C\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u2212h\u00bdx\u03022\u00f0t\u00de; p\u03022\u00f00\u00de 2i. The OTOCs are the quantum counterparts of the classical Lyapunov distance Ccl\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc hfx2\u00f0t\u00de; p2\u00f00\u00deg2i \u00bc h\u00f0\u2202x2\u00f0t\u00de\u2202x2\u00f00\u00de\u00de\n2i, which characterizes the sensitivity of one of the coordinates x2\u00f0t\u00de to its initial value x2\u00f00\u00de. Since the energy spectrum of the bosonic Hamiltonian is gapped, its real-time dynamics is completely regular at low temperatures. In particular, the OTOCs exhibit regular oscillations and show no signature of exponential growth (see the middle left plot in Fig. 8). For bosonic matrix models and Yang-Mills theory, this regime would correspond to the low-energy confinement regime. On the other hand, the energy spectrum of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) is known to be continuous [36]. One of our main results is that the low-energy spectrum of the supersymmetric model is completely regular and shows no signatures of random-matrix-type energy level statistics. The corresponding wave functions are effectively one dimensional and are localized along the flat directions of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (see Fig. 5). Nevertheless, these low-energy states produce a monotonous OTOC growth down to the lowest temperatures. We presented numerical evidence that this OTOC growth is not an artifact of our Hilbert space truncation. All our extrapolations toward the physical limit suggest that the timedependent Lyapunov divergence rate \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1\n2 d dt log\u00f0C\u00f0t\u00de\u00de\nremains finite. We observed that \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de reaches a plateau of a finite time extent at intermediate times t \u223c T\u22121=2 (labeled with P in the upper left plot in Fig. 10), which suggests an exponential growth of the OTOCs C\u00f0t\u00de over a finite time range. However, in contrast to large-N gauge theories and matrix model, in our system, there is no intrinsic large parameter and no parametric scale separation that would allow to clearly identify the regime of exponential OTOC growth. The plateau is followed by a distinct peak of \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de (labeled with x in the upper left plot in Fig. 10). We base our estimates on the quantum Lyapunov exponent \u03bb, shown in Fig. 12, on the height of this peak. While for a finite Hilbert space truncation even the free particle Hamiltonian exhibits a monotonous OTOC growth, we demonstrated that in the free case the Lyapunov divergence rate \u03bb\u00f0t\u00de is likely to extrapolate to zero as the truncation is removed. We found limited evidence that the estimates of quantum Lyapunov exponent in the supersymmetric model, based either on the plateau or peak heights, scale linearly with temperature, \u03bb \u00bc cT with c \u2248 0.05. Such a linear scaling would ensure that the model does not violate the MSS bound \u03bb < 2\u03c0T. We cannot, however, completely exclude a scaling \u03bb \u2248 c0T\u03b3 with a fractional power 1=2\u2272 \u03b3 \u2272 1. While this scaling would formally violate the MSS bound \u03bb < 2\u03c0T at sufficiently low temperatures, there is no deep reason why the MSS bound should not be violated for our simple Hamiltonians. Indeed, the derivation of the MSS bound [2] is based on the assumption that the OTOCs\nexhibit exponential growth after the time-ordered correlator F0\u00f0t\u00de [defined in (24)] saturates at a constant value f0 \u00bc 2hx\u030222ihp\u030222i. This assumption is justifiable for largeN matrix models and non-Abelian gauge theories. However, as one can observe by comparing the data in Figs. 8, 9, and 10, in our case, F0\u00f0t\u00de reaches its asymptotic value at much later times than the times at which the OTOCs exhibit maximal growth. Again, this could be expected in the absence of any parametric scale separation. Our estimates of the quantum Lyapunov exponents are summarized in Fig. 12 for the whole range of temperatures and for all Hamiltonians and all values of the truncation parameters that we consider. The data in Fig. 12 suggest that the quantum Lyapunov exponent for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) continuously interpolates between an approximately linear scaling \u03bb \u223c T at low temperatures and the fractional power scaling \u03bb \u223c T1=4 that is characteristic for the classical dynamics [see Eq. (26)]. This is also an expected behavior for the BFSS model, which, being holographically dual to black branes [12,13], is suspected to saturate the MSS bound at low temperatures, and reduce to the classical Yang-Mills dynamics at high temperatures. The temperature dependence of \u03bb at low and high temperatures is also quite different from the results obtained with the free one- and two-dimensional Hamiltonians (16) and (17). At sufficiently large energies, the energy spectra of both the bosonic and the supersymmetric Hamiltonians are chaotic, with r ratios in perfect agreement with random matrix theory predictions for the GOE ensemble. At sufficiently high temperatures, these energy levels dominate the real-time dynamics, which in this regime is expected to be similar to the classical chaotic dynamics for both systems. The change between the low-energy, effectively one-dimensional states with nonchaotic level statistics and the high-energy chaotic states appears to be quite sharp (see the middle plot in Fig. 6). It would be interesting to understand what might be the counterpart of this change in the BFSS model and how it can be interpreted in terms of the holographic dual theory. An intriguing possibility is the transition to the M-theory regime that was discussed recently in Ref. [12]. An interesting observation is that the correspondence with the classical dynamics at (moderately) high temperatures can only be established for OTOCs in the supersymmetric model, but not in the bosonic one. This suggests that supersymmetry cancels out some of the quantum corrections to OTOCs at high temperatures, a property that is also likely to hold for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the BFSS model. For the bosonic model, lowtemperature OTOC oscillations with amplitude \u223cT1=4 (labeled as oscill. in Fig. 12) are continuously transforming into very quick early-time growth, without approaching the classical OTOCs sufficiently closely anywhere. At very high temperatures (T \u2273 20), this quick early-time growth\n046001-18\nalso makes it impossible to establish the quantum-classical correspondence for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. The fact that a similar growth occurs also for the free twodimensional Hamiltonian suggests that it might be a truncation artifact. The invalidity of the quantum-classical correspondence for the four-point OTOCs in simple quantum mechanical systems has also been discussed recently in Ref. [20]. Our results suggest that the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) has more intricate chaotic dynamics than the simple bosonicHamiltonian H\u0302B \u00bc p\u030221 \u00fe p\u030222 \u00fe x\u030221x\u030222, both at low and at high temperatures. The supersymmetric model definitely reproduces more features of the BFSS model that are expected from the holographic dual description. It would be interesting to work out an analytic description of the effectively one-dimensional eigenstates of this Hamiltonian that saturate the OTOC growth at low temperatures. Such a description might also help to understand the behavior of OTOCs in the BFSS model, which provides one of the most elaborate examples of holographic duality [11,49]."

It is straightforward to check that all these operators commute with the bosonic Hamiltonian (4). The group C4v has four Abelian irreps: the trivial irrep A1 as well as Z2-valued irreps A2, B1, and B2, which can be inferred from the character tables in Ref. [44,45]. There is also one real, two-dimensional, non-Abelian irrep E0. It coincides with the non-Abelian irrep E0 of the symmetry group of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian; see Table I. The symmetry group of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6) is D4d, a finite non-Abelian group with 16 elements [46,47]. The transformations that generate this group are closely related to the transformations that leave the bosonic Hamiltonian invariant, with some additional operations that arise due to the fermionic structure of the Hilbert space of two-component wave functions \u03a8\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc f\u03c8\u00f0x1; x2\u00de; \u03c7\u00f0x1; x2\u00deg: (1) Rotations R\u0302 by \u03c0=2. Rotations act on the two-\ncomponent wave functions as\n\u00f0R\u0302\u03a8\u00de\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc I \u2212 \u03f5ffiffiffi\n2 p \u00f0R\u0302\u03a8\u00de\u00f0x1; x2\u00de\n\u00bc I \u2212 \u03f5ffiffiffi 2 p \u03a8\u00f0x2;\u2212x1\u00de; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere I is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix and \u03f5 is the 2 \u00d7 2 antisymmetric matrix with \u03f512 \u00bc 1. The unitary matrix I\u2212\u03f5ffiffi\n2 p multiplies the two-component vector\n\u03a8\u00f0x1; x2\u00de \u00bc f\u03c8\u00f0x1; x2\u00de; \u03c7\u00f0x1; x2\u00deg. In contrast to the rotation operator R\u0302 acting on the Hilbert space of the bosonic Hamiltonian (4), for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, the operator R\u0302 is a fermionic representation of the rotation operator, for which the rotation by 2\u03c0 results in a change of sign: R\u03024 \u00bc \u2212I\u0302 , where I\u0302 is the identity operator. Correspondingly, the group D4d contains all powers of R\u0302 up to R\u0302\n7, and only the eighth power of R\u0302 yields the identity operator: R\u03028 \u00bc I\u0302 .

In contrast, reflections that act on the Hilbert space of the bosonic Hamiltonian commute with each other: P\u03021P\u03022 \u00bc P\u03022P\u03021, P\u0302\u00feP\u0302\u2212 \u00bc P\u0302\u2212P\u0302\u00fe. The groupD4d has four Abelian irreps: the trivial irrepA1 as well as Z2-valued irreps A2, B1, and B2, which can be inferred from the character tables in Ref. [46,47]. There are also three real, two-dimensional, non-Abelian irreps E0, E1, and E2. For completeness, in Table I, we list all the elements of theD4d group together with the correspondingmatrices of irrepsE0, E1, andE2. The format of this table is the following:\n046001-20\n(i) In the second column, we give the functional representation of the corresponding element as a direct product of the form U\u0302B \u2297 UF, where the operator U\u0302B acts on each of the two components of the wave function as f\u00f0U\u0302B\u03d5\u00de\u00f0x1; x2\u00de; \u00f0U\u0302B\u03c7\u00de\u00d7 \u00f0x1; x2\u00deg, and the matrix UF multiplies these two components as a vector, as in Eqs. (A1), (A2), and (A4). The operators U\u0302B generate a functional representation of the group C4v.\n(ii) In the third column, we give the symbol that corresponds to this element in the character tables in Ref. [46].\n(iii) We note that first factors in the direct product expressions in the second column are the elements of C4v, the symmetry group of the bosonic Hamiltonian (4). In the fourth column, we give the symbol that corresponds to these element of C4v in the character tables in Ref. [44,45]. (iv) In the fifth column, we show how the operators in the second column act on the basis state jk1; k2;\u2191i \u00bc fjk1ijk2i; 0g with the wave function f\u03c8k1\u00f0x1\u00de\u03c8k2\u00f0x2\u00de; 0g, where hx1jk1i \u00bc \u03c8k1\u00f0x1\u00de and hx2jk2i \u00bc \u03c8k2\u00f0x2\u00de are the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions (9). Note that we can still apply Wigner\u2019s theorem to the finite matrices (12) and (10) of the Hamiltonian operators (6) and (4) in the harmonic oscillator basis because two-dimensional harmonic oscillator eigenstates jk1i \u2297 jk2i inherit an O\u00f02\u00de symmetry group of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator which contains both C4v and D4d as subgroups.\n(v) In the sixth, seventh, and eighth columns, we give the matrices of non-Abelian irreps E0, E1, and E2 that correspond to the transformations listed in the first and the second columns. All matrices are given as combinations of 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix I, the antisymmetric matrix \u03f5, and the Pauli matrices \u03c31 and \u03c33. The matrices in the sixth column also form a non-Abelian irrep E0 of the group C4v (generated by the operators U\u0302B, which are the first factors in the direct products in the second column.)\nBy virtue of Wigner\u2019s theorem, eigenstates of the Hamiltonians (6) or (4) should form multiplets j\u03a8\u03b1i i with degenerate energy levels that transform under one of the irreps of the groups D4d (for H\u0302S) or C4v (for H\u0302B),\nG\u0302\u00f0g\u00dej\u03a8\u03b1i i \u00bc XdR \u03b2\u00bc1 GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00dej\u03a8\u03b2i i; \u00f0A5\u00de\nwhere the index i labels distinct energy levels Ei, \u03b1 \u00bc 1\u2026dR labels all linearly independent eigenstates with H\u0302j\u03a8\u03b1i i \u00bc Eij\u03a8\u03b1i i, and GR\u03b1\u03b2 is the dR \u00d7 dR matrix of the group element g in the irrep R. In our case, the operators G\u0302\u00f0g\u00de are listed in the first column of Table I and defined in\nthe second column of this table. For irreps with dimension dR \u00bc 2, the matrices GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00de are given in the sixth, seventh, and eighth columns. For one-dimensional irreps (dR \u00bc 1), GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00de\u2261GR\u00f0g\u00de can be easily reconstructed from character tables in Refs. [44\u201347]. To classify all eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrices (6) and (4) according to irreps of the groups C4v or D4d, we can use the identity (A5) and the Schur orthogonality relations\nX g GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00deG\u0304R 0 \u03b3\u03b4\u00f0g\u00de \u00bc \u03b4RR0\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03b2\u03b4 jGj dR ; \u00f0A6\u00de\nwhere jGj is the total number of elements in the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. To this end, we multiply the equality (A5) by G\u0304R\u03b3\u03b4\u00f0g\u00de [that is equal to GR\u03b3\u03b4\u00f0g\u00de for our real irreps] and sum over all group elements g:\nX g GR 0 \u03b3\u03b4\u00f0g\u00deG\u00f0g\u00dej\u03a8\u03b1i i \u00bc XdR \u03b2\u00bc1 X g G\u0304R 0 \u03b3\u03b4\u00f0g\u00deGR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00dej\u03a8\u03b2i i\n\u00bc jGj dR \u03b4RR0\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3j\u03a8\u03b4i i: \u00f0A7\u00de\nTherefore, if we apply all transformations within the symmetry group to some eigenvector of the Hamiltonian matrix, and sum up the results with the weights given by the elements of the matrices of some irrep R0, we only get a nonzero result if R0 is the irrep of the multiplet to which this eigenvector belongs. Of course, for one-dimensional irreps, the vector transforms into itself, and group transformations amount to multiplications by a complex phase factor. The identity (A7) can also be used to prove that eigenvectors of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian can only transform under the two-dimensional non-Abelian irreps E1 and E2. Indeed, the matrices that multiply the two-component wave function as a vector (UF factors in the second column in Table I form the irrep E1. The structure of irreps E1 and E2 is such that for any group element g with representation matrix GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00de there is another element g0 with GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g0\u00de \u00bc \u2212GR\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0g\u00de. Looking at the Table I as well as the character tables in Ref.

(A7) will be equal to \u2212GR0\u03b3\u03b4\u00f0g0\u00deU\u0302B\u00f0g0\u00de \u2297 UF\u00f0g0\u00dej\u03a8i. In the sum over all group elements, summands that correspond to g and g0 will cancel each other. Therefore, for any eigenstate of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian, the sum in\n046001-21\nthe first line of Eq. (A7) will be equal to zero for R0 \u00bc A1;2;B1;2; E0. We conclude therefore that eigenstates of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian can only transform under the irreps E1 or E2 and therefore should all be doubly degenerate once we impose the IR cutoff (finite M truncation) that makes the continuous spectrum discrete.\nAPPENDIX B: BLOCK-DIAGONAL REPRESENTATION OF HAMILTONIAN MATRICES WITHIN PARITY SECTORS AND BASIS STATE ENUMERATION\nIn this work, we perform numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrices (10) and (12). To achieve faster convergence of diagonalization algorithms, it is advantageous to reduce the size of matrices being diagonalized, for example, by representing them in block-diagonal form. The largest reduction of the matrix block size could be achieved by considering combinations of basis states jk1i \u2297 jk2i that transform under irreps of the groups C4v (for the bosonic Hamiltonian) orD4d (for the supersymmetric Hamiltonian). By virtue of Wigner\u2019s theorem, the Hamiltonian matrices (10) and (12) would then reduce to a block diagonal form such that each block corresponds to one of the irreps. Explicit construction of such basis states is quite involved and would result in a significantly more complicated code. In this work, we choose a different but equally efficient strategy and use an eigenbasis of a single element P\u03021 \u00bc P\u03021 \u2297 \u03c33 of the symmetry groupD4d of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian H\u0302S. Since P\u03021 commutes with H\u0302S as well as with the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix and P\u030221 \u00bc I\u0302 , the Hamiltonian matrix should have a block-diagonal form with blocks corresponding to 1 eigenvalues of P\u03021. Note that, since the parity operators P\u03021;2 and P\u0302 do not commute with each other, only one of these operators can be diagonalized simultaneously with the Hamiltonian. An immediate consequence of the identity (A5) is that any two states j\u03a81i i, j\u03a82i i that belong to a doublet of states transforming under irreps E1 or E2 of the D4d symmetry group should have opposite parities. As one can infer from Table I, for both irreps, the parity transformation P\u03021 is represented by the Pauli matrix \u03c33. Rewriting (A5) in explicit form, we obtain\nP\u03021j\u03a81i i \u00bc \u00f0\u03c33\u00de11j\u03a81i i \u00fe \u00f0\u03c33\u00de12j\u03a82i i \u00bc \u00fej\u03a81i i; P\u03021j\u03a82i i \u00bc \u00f0\u03c33\u00de21j\u03a81i i \u00fe \u00f0\u03c33\u00de22j\u03a82i i \u00bc \u2212j\u03a82i i: \u00f0B1\u00de\nTogether with the fact that eigenstates of H\u0302S can only transform under irreps E1 or E2, this observation implies that both diagonal blocks of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian matrix (12) have identical energy spectra. Using the fact that the operators x\u03022 and p\u03022 are invariant under P\u03021, one can also show that the products of matrix elements of x\u03022 and p\u03022 that enter the OTOCs C\u00f0t\u00de in (23)\nare identical for both parity sectors. Therefore, the contributions of both diagonal blocks to OTOCs are identical, which allows us to save CPU time by diagonalizing only the positive-parity block of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian matrix. Note that this does not apply to the bosonic Hamiltonian, for which both parity sectors need to be diagonalized in order to get the full OTOCs. All harmonic oscillator eigenstates (9) have a definite parity under coordinate reflections; therefore, the direct product states jk1i \u2297 jk2i are also eigenstates of the bosonic parity operator P\u03021 with P\u03021jk1i \u2297 jk2i \u00bc \u00f0\u22121\u00dek1 jk1i \u2297 jk2i. Using this fact, it is straightforward to find the twocomponent eigenstates of the operator P\u03021 \u00bc P\u03021 \u2297 \u03c33 with eigenvalues 1,\njk1; k2;\u00fei \u00bc jk1i \u2297 jk2i\n0\n; k1 \u00bc 2m;\njk1; k2;\u00fei \u00bc\n0\njk1i \u2297 jk2i\n; k1 \u00bc 2m\u00fe 1;\njk1; k2;\u2212i \u00bc jk1i \u2297 jk2i\n0\n; k1 \u00bc 2m\u00fe 1;\njk1; k2;\u2212i \u00bc\n0\njk1i \u2297 jk2i\n; k1 \u00bc 2m; \u00f0B2\u00de\nwhere m \u00bc 0; 1; 2;\u2026. Matrix elements hk1; k2;\u00fejH\u0302Sjk1; k2;\u2212i are equal to zero because H\u0302S commutes with P\u03021. To work with the basis states (B2), we need a way to efficiently enumerate the states jk1i \u2297 jk2i with k1 \u00fe k2 \u2264 M and a definite parity of k1. We use the enumeration shown in Fig. 13. Red and blue points have positive and negative parity P\u03021 (even and odd k1). The labels of points on the plot have the format i\u2236k1; k2, where i is the serial number of the state. We enumerate states separately in each of the two parity sectors. If we limit the values of i to lie in the range i \u00bc 0\u2026M2 \u00feM \u2212 1, the set of basis states is symmetric with respect to the interchange x1 \u2194 x2. Since this is one of the basic symmetries of our system, we always use ranges of this form. The transformation from k1, k2 to the one-dimensional index i can be written as\ni \u00bc 2\u00f0div\u00f0k1; 2\u00de \u00fe div\u00f0r\u00fe r2; 2\u00de\u00de \u00femod \u00f0k2; 2\u00de; r \u00bc div\u00f0k1; 2\u00de \u00fe div\u00f0k2; 2\u00de; \u00f0B3\u00de where div\u00f0a; b\u00de and mod \u00f0a; b\u00de are the integer division of a over b and the integer modulo of a over b. The inverse transformation is\nk1 \u00bc 2\u00f0div\u00f0i; 2\u00de \u2212 div\u00f0r\u00fe r2; 2\u00de\u00de \u00fe p1; k2 \u00bc 2\u00f0r\u00fe div\u00f0r\u00fe r2; 2\u00de \u2212 div\u00f0i; 2\u00de\u00de \u00femod \u00f0i; 2\u00de;\nr \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2div\u00f0i; 2\u00de \u00fe 1 4\nr \u2212 1\n2\n; \u00f0B4\u00de\n046001-22\nwhere b\u2026c is the floor function and \u00f0\u22121\u00dep1 is the parity sign: p1 \u00bc 0, p1 \u00bc 1 for the positive and negative parity sectors, correspondingly. Note that for the bosonic Hamiltonian (4) we could have\nused the two commuting operators P\u03021 and P\u03022 (or P\u0302\u00fe and P\u0302\u2212) to define four parity sectors and thus reduce the size of matrix blocks even further. However, here, we only used P\u03021 to reduce the diagonal block size of the bosonic Hamiltonian matrix (10). The reason is that the primary focus of this paper is the supersymmetric Hamiltonian (6), and for debugging purposes, we wanted to maintain state enumeration that would be similar for both Hamiltonians. Even with this choice, the bosonic Hamiltonian is much easier to treat numerically than the supersymmetric one, and using only P\u03021 parity is enough to obtain good-quality numerical data for the bosonic model."

A technical difficulty is that both the classical partition function (C3) and the probability distribution of initial coordinate values x1\u00f00\u00de, x2\u00f00\u00de contain a non-normalizable weight function exp\u00f0\u2212 x21x22T \u00de. To regularize the diverging integrals R dx1dx2 exp\u00f0\u2212 x 2 1 x2 2\nT \u00de and to generate x1\u00f00\u00de and x2\u00f00\u00de with the required probability distribution, we express x1 and x2 in terms of \u201chyperbolic\u201d coordinates \u2212\u221e < r < \u00fe\u221e and \u2212\u221e < \u03d5 < \u00fe\u221e as x1 \u00bc re\u03d5, x2 \u00bc re\u2212\u03d5. In terms of the new coordinates, the above integrals can be written as\nZ dx1dx2exp \u2212 x21x 2 2\nT\n\u00bc4 Z \u00fe\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03d5 Z \u00fe\u221e 0 dr2e\u2212 r4 T : \u00f0C5\u00de\nWe see that the integral divergence is related to the infinite integration limits for the \u201chyperbolic angle\u201d variable \u03d5, and the probability distribution of the \u201cradial\u201d coordinate r is perfectly normalizable. To regularize the integrals over \u03d5 and make the probability distribution in (C1), we introduce a cutoff \u2212\u03d5max < \u03d5 < \u03d5max on the \u03d5 variable. While the integrals in the classical partition function Zcl and in the Lyapunov distance definition (C1) are divergent, this divergence cancels out in the ratio of the two integrals. As a result, Ccl\u00f0t\u00de is practically independent of the cutoff \u03d5max once \u03d5max is large enough. In practice, we used \u03d5max in the range 2 < \u03d5max < 5 and observed that the results are independent of \u03d5max within statistical errors of Monte Carlo expectation values. The expression (5) is obtained by fitting log\u00f0Ccl\u00f0t\u00de\u00de at sufficiently late times with a linear function. The corresponding slope is twice the classical Lyapunov exponent in (5).\n[1] A. I. Larkin and Y. N. Ovchinnikov, J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 28, 1200 (1969). [2] J. Maldacena, S. H. Shenker, and D.
