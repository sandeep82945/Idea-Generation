            "text": "Furfural is a promising bio-based platform molecule that presents applications in the fuel and chemical industries and forms a rich source of derivatives.1 Industrial furfural production relies largely on batch-wise, acid-catalyzed dehydration of xylose contained in the biomass while it degrades the rest of the biomass.1,2 Emerging approaches spare the biomass by gently extracting the xylose and dehydrating it in a subsequent step.1\u20134 Dehydration of xylose in water typically delivers furfural with a yield of about 45 mol%, while dehydration in biphasic medium reaches yields of 65 mol%.1,3 Several approaches to further improve the selectivity of xylose dehydration to furfural have been described in the literature, e.g., monophasic aqueous\u2013organic systems with polar organic solvents, such as DMSO or dioxane, or, alternatively, biphasic solvent systems at increased ionic strengths, by adding inorganic salts.5\u201313 But the improved selectivity comes with signicant process challenges and costs, e.g., recovering the xylose from the diluted aqueous hydrolysate to transfer it to the monophasic organic medium or\nment for Molecules & Materials, MESA+\n7, 7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands. utwente.nl versity of Twente, P.O.

Heating methods, for example traditional and microwave heating, have been compared.24\u201327 Kinetic models have also been used to study the effects of different types and concentrations of acid catalysts.18,20,21 In other cases, such models focus specically on the degradation of furfural, in the presence and absence of sugars, offering insight into the formation of soluble side-products and humins.27,29\u201331 In most cases these models focus on fully aqueous environments, or exclusively on aqueous\u2013organic biphasic environments.18\u201321,26,28 There are some instances in which the kinetics of the xylose dehydration in aqueous\u2013organic monophasic systems (e.g., water\u2013DMSO mixtures) has been modeled,23,27,28,31 however, with no particular attention to the solvent effect on the kinetics.28,30\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The model can shed light on the differences between monophasic and biphasic operations and the role of salts and phase partitioning."

            "text": "Modelling approach to describe the kinetics of xylose dehydration\nScheme 1 describes the dehydration of xylose from PBA2X in two consecutive steps, regardless of the characteristics of the solvent system. The rst step is the equilibrium of hydrolysis and formation (esterication) of PBA2X, while the second step is the (irreversible) dehydration of free xylose to furfural, with the possible (parallel) formation of by-products.1\u20133 Sequential degradation of the formed furfural into other side products, like humins, appeared to be marginal under the present conditions and only occurs at high conversions, if at all.1,14,33 Hence, it has not been incorporated in Scheme 1.\nUnder monophasic conditions, where all species are well solubilized in the medium, the rst step is dened by the two kinetic rate constants k1h and k1e, which describe the hydrolysis and the boronate ester formation of PBA2X, respectively. In this boronate (de)esterication equilibrium, we ignore the possible presence of intermediates, such as a putative monoester discussed elsewhere.33 The second reaction step, i.e., the dehydration of free xylose, is dened by the kinetic rate constant k2. So, the xylose dehydration from PBA2X can be modeled as presented in Scheme 1, with each step of the process related to a rate constant. In this model, the furfural concentration is not expressed explicitly, only the overall conversion of the xylose.\nScheme 1 Simplified kinetic model for xylose dehydration starting from assumed to be equal to k2f + k2d. D indicates degradation products.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nNotice that Scheme 1 suggests a constant ratio between furfural and a degradation product D, which implies a \u2018at\u2019 prole for the xylose-to-furfural selectivity with increasing conversion to >90 mol% (Fig. S1 and S2\u2020), which is consistent with the observations discussed later.\nTo describe the kinetics of this system, we dene the (apparent) equilibrium constant Kc (eqn (1)), which is based on the measurable concentrations, and the previously dened rate constants, k1e and k1h.\nKc \u00bc k1e k1h \u00bc \u00bdPBA2X \u00bdX \u00bdPBA 2 (1)\nThe denition of concentration is trivial for monophasic systems but not for biphasic ones. Under biphasic conditions, the concentration of PBA2X is taken to be in the organic phase (and assumed negligible in the water phase), while the concentration of xylose is taken in the water phase (and is absent in the organic phase), as proven experimentally.33 PBA resides in both phases and therefore the total amount of PBA divided by the total volume, i.e., the volume-weighed concentration average over the two phases, is taken as the overall PBA concentration. The diester is not observed in the aqueous phase probably because of its low solubility in water. In the biphasic case, we hold the rate constants k1h and k1e to describe the combined equilibria of partitioning and (de)esterication.\nA simulation of the evolution of the concentrations of the various species (Scheme 1) over time can be built in the following manner. Assumed or tted values for the three rate constants (k1h, k1e, and k2) can be used to predict the evolution of the concentration of free xylose with time (eqn (2)).\nd\u00bdX dt \u00bc k1h\u00bdPBA2X k1e\u00bdX \u00bdPBA 2 k2\u00bdX (2)\nThe rst term of the equation describes the hydrolysis of PBA2X, with the role of water being embedded in k1h, the second the diester formation, and the third the xylose dehydration reaction.

The concentration of PBA can then be calculated at any point of time from its mass balance, knowing the total amounts of PBA in the system and that of the PBA2X diester in the total volume.\nThe calculated overall xylose conversion, Xcalc, is obtained from eqn (4), taking into account the sugar in both its diester and free forms. The initial concentrations are indicated with the suffix \u201c0\u201d.\nXcalc \u00bc 1 \u00bdPBA2X \u00fe \u00bdX \u00bdPBA2X 0 \u00fe \u00bdX 0 (4)\nSuch simulations were used (see below) to t the experimental data of xylose dehydration by varying three t parameters, i.e., k1h, Kc, and k2 (k1e is calculated from Kck1h, eqn (1)). Specically, Kc was chosen as a t parameter over k1e as the former is descriptive of the properties of the medium (e.g., water, water\u2013sulfolane\u2013aromatic solvents, water\u2013sulfolane or toluene\u2013water). As will be shown, this model is able to handle different combinations of initial concentrations of free xylose, PBA2X and PBA using the same values of these three t parameters, k1h, Kc, and k2. The tting of the parameters k1h, Kc, and k2 was operated in the same way both at biphasic and monophasic conditions. Part of the data on the dehydration of xylose used in this study (see below), starting from PBA2X and from free xylose in various solvent systems, were taken from our previous work.14,32 Additional experimental work has been conducted both under biphasic conditions at high ionic strengths and different mixing conditions, and under aqueous\u2013 organic monophasic conditions, starting from PBA2X and from free xylose.\nFrom the eqn (1)\u2013(4) given above, all species concentrations can be calculated at any point in time, using the starting conditions of a given experimental run. Since the conversion takes hours, 0.01 h is taken as the time interval between time points in our simulations. The model was used to t the experimental conversion data by least-squares minimization, performed in Excel. The model is implemented in Excel, and all equations are solved numerically in an iterative way. For example, the calculation of the xylose concentration in the aqueous phase is evaluated, from time 0, over a time window (0\u2013 4 h) divided into intervals of 0.01 h (Dt), with the concentration of xylose at time t + 1 being related to the concentration at time t of xylose, PBA and PBA2X, following eqn (5).\n[X]t+1 = [X]t + (k1h[PBA2X]t \u2212 k1e[X]t[PBA]t2 \u2212 k2[X]t)Dt (5)\nThe changes in the concentration of PBA2X are calculated in a similar manner. The tting of the data is also performed in Excel. An initial value is given to all the model parameters to be tted, namely Kc, k2 and k1h (k1e is derived from Kc and k1h and\n31820 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 31818\u201331829\nnot tted independently). Conversion values at each time for which an experimental value is available, are obtained from the simulation and compared to the experimental ones. A standard least-squares minimization routine is used to minimize the sum of errors over all conversion time points by varying the model parameters. A cumulative error is used, when applicable, to t multiple experimental series simultaneously with one set of parameters.\nThe three t parameters k1h, Kc, and k2 were optimized independently or kept the same across a set of data series depending on the relation between the experimental cases. For example, all data series for water\u2013toluene biphasic systems at the same ionic strength were tted altogether with the same values of k1h, Kc, and k2, regardless of the starting reactant (i.e., free xylose, free xylose and PBA, PBA2X). For studying effects of stirring speed, only k1h was varied to describe changes in mass transport, while Kc and k2 were kept the same over the different runs.\nThe data were tted using a single lag time, found to be about 0.1 h as determined for cases in the absence of PBA, irrespective of starting feed and medium. This simplication is based on the expectation that the lag time is a consequence of the temperature ramp-up process only, as discussed elsewhere.32 The observed extension of the lag time due to the hydrolysis of PBA2X is simulated explicitly.\nXylose dehydration kinetics at monophasic conditions\nThe modeling of monophasic aqueous\u2013organic solvent systems is conceptually the most straightforward. To study effects of the water content and polar solvent, experiments were performed on three, mainly organic, monophasic systems, i.e., dioxane\u2013 water mixtures (40 : 1 and 20 : 1 v/v ratio) and a 40 : 1 v/v sulfolane\u2013water mixture. In all cases H2SO4 was added to reach a [H2SO4] = 0.1 M. These three solvent mixtures were used to perform the reaction of xylose dehydration, starting both from PBA2X and from free xylose (in absence of PBA), yielding a total of six cases. The experimental and tted data are shown in Fig. 1 (data points and tted lines), while Table 1 gives the sets of optimized t parameters. Cases performed in the same solvent mixture but from different starting situations (PBA2X or free xylose) were tted with the same set of model parameters.\nAll data series tted well with a single lag time of 0.1 h. In the case of free xylose in sulfolane, the somewhat poorer t is the result of the fact that the reaction in sulfolane is too fast, leading to signicant conversion during the temperature rampup and too few data points that can be assessed with sufficient accuracy. In all cases, the back-esterication could be completely ignored, meaning that any value of Kc > 0 M\n\u22122 (k1e > 0 h\u22121 M\u22122) did not lead to an improvement of the t. This is indicated in Table 1 as \u201c(0)\u201d. The effect of starting from PBA2X compared to free xylose is seen as a slower conversion in the former case, observed both in the experimental data and in the tted curves (Fig. 1). This is attributed to the necessary hydrolysis of the PBA2X diester, which has an effect on the equilibrium concentration of free xylose and on the rate of its\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As the model shows (Fig. 2a), the concentration of free xylose remains very low under these conditions.\nThe effect of the water contents is clearly seen by comparing the 20 : 1 and 40 : 1 dioxane\u2013water cases (Table 1, Fig. 2b): more water leads to a faster ester hydrolysis and a faster xylose dehydration. It should be noticed that a doubling of water concentration results in a nearly 10-fold acceleration of the hydrolysis. This disproportionate acceleration could be in part explained by a high order in water for the ester hydrolysis, which would be consistent with the need for two molecules of water to hydrolyze one boronate group. When comparing the 40 : 1 dioxane\u2013water and 40 : 1 sulfolane\u2013water cases, the latter is an order of magnitude faster, both in ester hydrolysis and in xylose conversion. This is attributed to the higher polarity of sulfolane compared to dioxane.\nPBA-containing, three-solvent mixtures of water with polar aprotic organic and aromatic solvents (e.g., toluene\u2013sulfolane\u2013 water, pH = 1) transition from biphasic at room temperature to monophasic at reaction conditions.14 Three different starting conditions (PBA2X, free xylose in the presence of PBA, and free xylose in the absence of PBA) and two different solvent systems (toluene\u2013sulfolane\u2013water and methylnaphthalene (MN)\u2013sulfolane\u2013water, in 1 : 1 : 1 volume ratio) yield in total six cases; their experimental data have been reported elsewhere.14 All the cases were tted independently. The experimental and tted data are shown in Fig. 3, while Table 2 gives the sets of optimized t parameters.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nAll data series tted well with a single lag time of 0.1 h. In all cases, the back-esterication could be completely ignored again, meaning that any value of Kc > 0 M \u22122 (k1e > 0 h \u22121 M\u22122) did not lead to an improvement of the t. This is indicated in Table 2 as \u201c(0)\u201d. This is a conrmation that, in the case of PBA2X, the process of formation of PBA2X from free xylose is virtually nonexistent, because it is outcompeted by the xylose dehydration.14 Conversely, hydrolysis of the diester, which results in the release of xylose, is a fast process as witnessed by the high k1h value. This is supported by the fact that the two cases in the presence of PBA are practically superimposable (Fig. 3). Notably, even though tted independently, the cases starting from PBA2X and from free xylose in presence of PBA, gave the same value of k1h, and also the xylose conversion steps are comparable, indicating that the two solvent systems are very comparable in their ester hydrolysis and xylose conversion. In the absence of PBA, the reaction is slower, seen in the model t as a lower value of k2. This can be rationalized considering that, in the absence of PBA, the system does not transition to monophasic at the reaction temperature.14 The modeling of biphasic systems is discussed separately below. It should also be noticed that the switch from toluene to MN decelerated both the diester hydrolysis and xylose dehydration reactions.\nWhen comparing the water-lean, polar organic\u2013aqueous systems (Table 1) to the water-richer, three-solvent systems (Table 2) discussed above, we note that the ester hydrolysis is more than two orders of magnitude faster for the water-rich\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 31818\u201331829 | 31821\nFig. 2 Model curves for the concentrations of (a) PBA, free xylose and PBA2X in the 20 : 1 dioxane system, and of (b) PBA2X in the 40 : 1 and 20 : 1 dioxane\u2013water systems.\nFig. 3 Experimental data points (markers) and model curves (lines) for the xylose conversion for the reaction of dehydration of 94 mM of PBA2X (blue), free xylose in presence of 194 mM PBA (red), and free xylose (black), performed at 180 \u00b0C in (a) 1 : 1 : 1 v/v/v of toluene\u2013sulfolane\u2013water (pH = 1) and (b) 1 : 1 : 1 v/v/v of MN\u2013sulfolane\u2013water (pH = 1) three-solvent systems.

More specically, the water-lean systems appeared to be rate-limited by the ester hydrolysis step with k1h/k2 ratio < 0.05, whereas the water-rich systems were rate-limited by the dehydration step with k1h/k2 ratio > 20. The faster ester hydrolysis is attributed to the much higher water contents in the three-solvent system and is in line with the difference observed for the different dioxane\u2013 water mixtures discussed above. The slower dehydration reaction is likely due to the higher water concentration as well. Additional model curves predict a clear difference between the active concentration of xylose in the two systems; the concentration stays close to 0 mM throughout the whole reaction time in the organic\u2013aqueous monophasic system (Fig. S3\u2020), while it peaks right away in the three-solvent systems (Fig. S4\u2020).\nXylose dehydration kinetics at biphasic conditions\nMoving from monophasic to biphasic conditions, modeling the kinetics allows us to study additional effects of the partitioning of reagents and products over the two phases. We here study the\n31822 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 31818\u201331829\neffects of a biphasic system on the xylose dehydration for different starting conditions, when varying the nature of the organic phase, the ionic strength of the water phase and the stirring of both phases, as reported in part elsewhere32 and in part from new experiments. Specically, we compare the dehydration of PBA2X and free xylose, with and without PBA, in a 1 : 1 toluene\u2013water biphasic system, both at 0.1 M and 3.1 M ionic strength (without and with added salt, i.e., Na2SO4, respectively), yielding in total six cases. In all cases H2SO4 was added to reach a [H2SO4] = 0.1 M. Subsequently, the 1 : 1 toluene\u2013 water biphasic system is compared with a 1 : 1 MN\u2013water biphasic system, both at 3.1 M ionic strength and using PBA2X as a starting material. For both systems, three different stirring speeds were used, i.e., no stirring, regular and heavy stirring,32 to explore the importance of interfacial area and mass transfer on the rate of hydrolysis, leading to a total of six cases.

In fact, k1e largely exceeds k2. At full hydrolysis that is characterized by a PBA concentration of 0.6 M, the pseudo-1st order rate constant for esterication k1e*[PBA]\n2 also exceeds the dehydration rate constant by 10-fold, indicating that the esterication of free xylose outcompetes its dehydration to furfural. It should be recalled that the opposite behavior was observed for the monophasic operation discussed above. Additionally, moving from the toluene\u2013water to the MN\u2013water solvent system affects the partitioning of the diester and the tting parameters Kc, k1h\n31824 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 31818\u201331829\nand k1e. However, at the same ionic strength in water, the rate constant k2 is kept unvaried, as the xylose dehydration takes place in the aqueous phase and should be independent of the organic phase. Furthermore, the t parameter Kc, which is an (apparent) equilibrium constant, is kept constant for all cases in which the solvent system is the same.\nAer the optimization of the parameter sets, the model simulations of all species concentrations over time can be viewed. It is interesting to follow the differences in the trends of the concentration of free xylose in water at different initial conditions (Fig. 6). The case with PBA2X as the starting material is compared to the one with free xylose (in water) with a 2 : 1 molar ratio of PBA (in toluene) (Fig. 6a). When starting from PBA2X, the xylose concentration initially increases and, aer reaching a maximum at around 0.5 h, starts to decrease, as more and more xylose is being converted. In contrast, when starting from free xylose in water, the concentration of xylose in water drops steadily. Aer about 0.5 h, the two curves become strongly comparable because the ester partitioning and hydrolysis/esterication have equilibrated and are following the pace of conversion, although the delay (of approx. 0.15 h) in the case starting from the diester is still apparent. Additional model curves show that both in the case of MN and toluene no stirring results in a lower, more distributed prole for the xylose\ns time, using rate constants given in Table 3, (a) starting from free sugar strength, and (b) starting with PBA2X in toluene at 0.1 M or at 3.1 M ionic\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As explained above, this results in a slower apparent conversion at high salt, caused by the fact that the xylose concentration is lowered by approx. a factor 2.5 (at the maximum), while the reaction rate constant is enhanced by only a factor 1.7.\nTable 3 shows that Kc increases when moving from toluene to MN, while keeping the ionic strength constant. This agrees with previous data on the extraction process and can be rationalized by a stronger interaction between MN and the diester and, more importantly, the lower solubility of water in MN compared to toluene.32 This depresses the hydrolysis rate of the ester and, consequently, the apparent xylose conversion is slower in MN (Fig. 5), even though the xylose dehydration rate constant is the same.\nThe stirring speed has a pronounced effect on the rate constants of hydrolysis/formation of the diester for both solvents (Fig. 5, Table 3). Overall, an increased stirring speed increases both rate constants k1h and k1e, indicating that the phase transfer is limiting the overall rate of hydrolysis. Switching from no stirring to regular stirring resulted in an about 2-fold increase of k1h (and also k1e since Kc was kept constant) for both solvents. For toluene there was no effect of increasing the stirring speed further. In contrast, for MN, the highest stirring speed increased the rate constants further. These effects are also observed from the free xylose concentrations obtained from the model simulations (Fig. 7).\nTentatively, k1h is assumed to reach a maximum, of approx. 1 h\u22121, which is not further increased by better mixing. The difference between MN and toluene in reaching optimal mixing can potentially be explained by the difference in surface tension of the organic phase.

            "text": "So far, the kinetic model has focused on describing the balance between the hydrolysis of PBA2X and the subsequent dehydration of the liberated xylose, and the impact that the reaction medium exercises on this balance. However, the model has not yet addressed the changes in selectivity observed for the various conditions. Expanding the model to address the selectivity toward furfural is therefore highly relevant.\nLimiting side reactions is an important issue to boost selectivity further.1 Understanding the kinetics of the formation of side products will help nding conditions to minimize them. Commonly observed experimentally, the xylose-to-furfural selectivity does not start at 100 mol% when conversion commences, and there can be a large part of the reaction time in which the selectivity appears constant, as is also observed in the experiments described here.11,17,26,35\u201337 As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,\u2020 the selectivity proles are at over large time and conversion windows, from 5 to approx. 95 mol% conversion. All series together (Fig. 8, data points) show approximately linear trends with slightly varying slopes. Intriguingly, the furfural selectivity is seen to vary between approx. 60 and 90 mol% for the various cases. The results presented here, therefore, all seem to indicate parallel reactions for xylose conversion to furfural and to degradation products (see Fig. S6a, c and e\u2020 for k1/k2 = 5). In contrast, these results do not support the selectivity\u2013conversion proles that are typical for consecutive reactions of xylose conversion to furfural and subsequent furfural degradation that are typically reported for operation in water:1,33 they show a selectivity that is 100 mol% at <10 mol% conversion and dropping with increasing conversion (see Fig. S6b and f\u2020 for the same k1/k2 = 5).\nScheme 1 shows that the model assumes a concomitant production of furfural and by-products, all encompassed in the constant k2.

In this scenario, k2f is dened as k2f = Savgk2, where Savg is the average selectivity over the conversion window. Hence, k2d can be obtained by subtracting k2f from k2 (additional information in the ESI\u2020). The resulting deconvolution (detailed in Table S1\u2020) indeed allows to t the yield proles reported in Fig. S1 and S2\u2020 with reasonable quality. However, it does not provide any insight into the chemical basis for such selectivity shis between 60 and 90 mol%. For instance, it can t the increased furfural selectivity achieved by increasing the ionic strength of the aqueous\nphase, by avoiding stirring of the medium or by switching from free xylose to PBA2X as feed. The selectivity increase is achieved by increasing the k2f/k2d ratio from 2 : 1 to 10 : 1, but this does not provide a rationale for the changing ratio.\nInterestingly, the conditions that favor selective furfural production also appear to disfavor the buildup of free xylose in the aqueous phase through slow PBA2X hydrolysis, as discussed earlier. Hence, these conditions could credibly disfavor degradation reactions that are higher order in xylose, e.g., by involving the condensation of several xylose molecules with each other (see Fig. S6c\u2020). To investigate this hypothesis, we have adapted our model by describing the xylose conversion with two parallel reactions, one to furfural (k2f) that is rst order in xylose and the other to degradation products (k2d) that is arbitrarily set to be second order in xylose (eqn (6)).\nd\u00bdX dt \u00bc k1h\u00bdPBA2X k1e\u00bdX \u00bdPBA 2 k2f \u00bdX k2d\u00bdX 2 (6)\nMoreover, in tting the datasets, we have xed the k2f/k2d ratio, i.e., we have xed the intrinsic selectivity, in an attempt to describe all selectivity changes by changes in the xylose concentration prole only. We maintained the same logic as applied earlier by keeping Kc constant for the same solvent systems (i.e., toluene\u2013water 0.1 M, or toluene\u2013water 3.1 M, irrespective of stirring) and keeping k2f and k2d constant for the same aqueous phase (i.e., 0.1 and 3.1 M, irrespective of stirring). In this scenario, both the conversion of xylose and the production of furfural are modeled. The concentration of furfural [F] is followed using eqn (7). The furfural mol% produced are also used in the t of the data to the model, specically based on eqn (8).\nd\u00bdF dt \u00bc k2f \u00bdX (7)\nFcalc \u00bc \u00bdF \u00bdPBA2X 0 \u00fe \u00bdX 0 (8)\nydration reaction at 200 \u00b0C in a 1 : 1 toluene\u2013water (pH = 1), biphasic action performed at 200 \u00b0C at 3.1 M ionic strength in a 1 : 1 organic\u2013 e or MN, at various stirring conditionsa\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

For this reason, these data were not considered in the t, which resulted in a better overall t of the other cases and comparable trends between biphasic operation in toluene and MN (Fig. S8\u2020). The resulting kinetic data are summarized in Table 4.\nThis model reproduces all selectivity shis observed experimentally without having to tune the k2f/k2d ratio (Fig. 8, data and model lines). It reproduces the benet of high salinity, by decelerating the PBA2X hydrolysis by 20-fold and accelerating the xylose conversion to furfural and degradation products by 4- fold (Table 4). It reproduces the benet of starting from PBA2X rather than free xylose or xylose + PBA by allowing slow xylose release by PBA2X hydrolysis (Table 4). Finally, it explains the slight increase in selectivity in absence of stirring by calculating a 50% slower PBA2X hydrolysis (Table 4), arguably due to lower interfacial area between toluene and saline aqueous phase and concomitantly slower mass transfer. The quality of the model is further illustrated by the parity plots illustrated in Fig. S9.\u2020\nIt is also worth noticing that such reaction scheme shows a slight increase in selectivity upon increasing conversion, e.g., from 82 to 87 mol% for k1/k2 = 5 (Fig. S6e\u2020). Such trend could also be detected in our experimental selectivity proles of Fig. S1 and S2\u2020 (e.g., in Fig. S2a, d and e), though within experimental error.\nThe analysis reported here shows the possibility to account for selectivity changes through changes in xylose concentration proles only. However, it does not pretend to demonstrate that this is the only cause, and that there would be no possible contribution from changes in k2f/k2d ratios. For instance, change in salinity could credibly affect the k2f/k2d ratio by affecting the solvation of transition states. In fact, other assumptions can be added to the relation between k2f and k2d. In tting, either k2d can be kept constant for all cases, assuming that the degradation is not inuenced by the ionic strength, or k2f and k2d can be tted independently. These two scenarios appeared to t the data equally well, with adjusted R2 of >0.99 (Fig. S10 and Table S2\u2020), and the resulting k and Kc values are reported in Tables S3 and S4.\u2020Moreover, there are experimental observations that do not t the analysis. Specically, the model fails to reproduce the lower selectivity observed when switching from toluene\u2013water to MN\u2013water, which are obvious outliers in the parity plot for selectivity (Fig. S11\u2020). For this reason, those points were excluded from the analysis of Fig. 8.\nIt should be mentioned here that the selectivity prole of aqueous reaction is typically described by a combination of parallel condensation of xylose with itself and consecutive degradation of furfural with unconverted xylose. This scheme describes a selectivity of approx. 50 mol% at low conversion, which is dictated by the parallel reactions, and it drops monotonously with increasing conversion due to the consecutive degradation of furfural. Such prole does not t the at selectivity prole observed here between 5 and 95 mol% conversion for monophasic organic and biphasic systems.\nFinally, while tting the model to the data does not require consecutive furfural degradation for conversions up to 95%, it\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ndoes not fully exclude the possibility of minor consecutive degradation of furfural with itself at full conversion. Fig. S1c and S2c\u2020 indeed suggest a minor drop in selectivity (from approx. 75 to approx. 70 mol%) between 1.5 h and 2.5 h, when the xylose is fully converted. Yet, such consecutive degradation remains insignicant for all other conditions applied in this study."

            "text": "A kinetic model has been developed to describe the xylose dehydration at various reaction conditions, implementing the possibility of starting the reaction from PBA2X. This model encompasses all the steps from PBA2X hydrolysis to xylose dehydration. The tting of the experimental data provided various sets of rate constants, which allow to isolate the effects of changing the solvent system, the stirring rate, etc., on each reaction step, deepening the understanding of the observed xylose conversion and xylose-to-furfural selectivity.\nOverall, the results described in this work show important aspects of the process. Firstly, xylose dehydration to furfural is very fast in water-lean organic media but much slower in waterrich media and in the aqueous phase of biphasic media. It is nevertheless accelerated by high salinity in the latter case. Secondly, the hydrolysis of the xylose boronate diester is a key reaction step in the process. It is fast and not limiting for waterrich monophasic systems (sulfolane\u2013toluene\u2013water) but becomes rate-limiting for water-lean monophasic systems and for biphasic systems. In the latter case it is even aggravated by high salinity or insufficient stirring. Thirdly, the effect of salinity and stirring on the selectivity plateau can be largely explained indirectly by the effect they have on PBA2X hydrolysis and, thereby, the effective xylose prole in the aqueous phase. This assumes that the xylose degradation is higher (e.g., 2nd) order in xylose than the desired furfural formation.\nAdditionally, this model allows to obtain curves that describe the evolution of the concentrations of the relevant species in solution (i.e., PBA2X, PBA and free xylose), which are, at times, impossible to gather experimentally. These model curves can further support hypotheses on the mechanism of dehydration and on the rate-limiting step, which varies from case to case. Applying the model to various cases resulted in an understanding of its limitations, which opens the possible application of such a kinetic model to other, more general, cases, not necessarily limited to the processes of biomass valorization."
