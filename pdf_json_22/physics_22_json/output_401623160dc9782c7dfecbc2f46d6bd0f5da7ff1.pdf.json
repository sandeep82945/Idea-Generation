    "abstractText": "We develop an analytical description of static ferrodark solitons, the Z2 topological defects in the magnetic order, in the easy-plane phase of ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. We find that the type-I ferrodark soliton has a single width while the type-II ferrodark soliton exhibits two characteristic length scales. The proposed Ans\u00e4tze show excellent agreement with numerical results. Spin-singlet amplitudes, nematic tensor densities, and nematic currents of ferrodark solitons are also discussed. The Z2 topological defects in the mass superfluid order, dark-dark-dark vector solitons, are obtained exactly in the parameter regime where exact ferrodark solitons exist. The dark-dark-dark vector soliton has higher excitation energy than ferrodark solitons.",

INTRODUCTION\nA spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a coherent state constituted by atoms occupying hyperfine spin levels |F = 1, m = +1, 0,\u22121\u3009 that interact via spin-mixing collisions, exhibiting superfluidity and magnetic orders [1\u20136]. This spinor superfluid supports topological excitations that are absent in scalar and two-component BECs, adding novel features to phenomena such as the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless transitions [7,8] and out-of-equilibrium processes in superfluids, including Kibble-Zurek mechanism [9,10], phase ordering [11\u201317], and thermalization processes [18,19]. It also provides additional to magnetic thin films, a prominent platform for exploring quantum magnetism.\nIn the presence of a magnetic field along the z axis, the ground state of a ferromagnetic spin-1 BEC can be in the easy-axis or broken-axisymmetry ferromagnetic phases, or the nonmagnetized polar phase, each separated by a quantum phase transition [5,6]. The easy-plane phase, being the broken-axisymmetry phase with the magnetization lying in the xy plane, is particularly interesting as it describes XY magnetism and supports various unique topological excitations [20\u201323]. A substantial amount of work has been devoted to studying quenches from the polar phase to the easy-plane phase by a change in the magnetic field [4,10,11,13,24\u201327]. Here polar core vortices are the relevant topological defects in two dimensions (2D) and determine the Kibble-Zurek scaling and the universal dynamic scaling in phase ordering at late times [13]. Domain wall structures also appear in the\n*xqyu@gscaep.ac.cn\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nearly stage of quenches due to the linear instability, but these domain walls are transient and continually decay to polar core vortices [24]. In one dimension (1D), domain walls/solitons are relevant defects and contribute the Kibble-Zurek scalings [9,10] and may play an important role in determining the universal scaling behaviors at later times of the quench [26,27] (i.e., the so-called nonthermal fixed point). However, little is known on the properties of the relevant domain walls/solitons in ferromagnetic spin-1 condensates.\nAn important question is what topological excitations are supported in the easy-plane phase of ferromagnetic spin-1 BECs? Here the term \u201ctopological\u201d refers to the winding number (2D) or the topological charge (1D) of the order parameter being nonzero. In a scalar BEC, vortices (2D) and dark solitons (1D) are the relevant topological excitations. In ferromagnetic spin-1 BECs, the magnetization serves as the local order parameter and quantifies the magnetic order associated with the SO(3) rotational symmetry breaking. In the easy-plane phase, the spin vortices [defects associated with the continuous SO(2) symmetry] are polar core vortices and Mermin-Ho vortices [5,6,28,29], while kinks in the transverse magnetization (defects associated with the discrete Z2 symmetry) have been uncovered only recently thanks to the discovery of ferrodark solitons (FDSs) (also referred to as magnetic domain walls) [22,23]. The FDSs are magnetic kinks that connect transverse magnetic domains with opposite magnetizations, signified by the magnetization F vanishing at the core and changing its sign across the core. The superfluid density n has a dip but does vanish at the core. The FDSs have two types and exhibit several distinct features, including positive inertial mass, stability against snake deformations, and oscillations in a linear potential due to the transition between the two types at the maximum speed [22,23]. The static profiles of FDSs have been studied in detail when q \u2192 0 [22], where q is the quadratic Zeeman energy of the atom in the magnetic field. However, at finite q, except for exactly solvable cases [22,23], the core structure of FDSs remain unexplored.\n2643-1564/2022/4(3)/033056(11) 033056-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nIn this paper we study the core structure of static FDSs for finite quadratic Zeeman energies (q > 0) in the whole easyplane phase. Accurate Ans\u00e4tze are proposed and show good agreement with numerical results. In particular, we obtain the characteristic length scales analytically via consistent asymptotic analysis, finding that type-I FDS has a single length scale while type-II FDS requires two length scales to describe the width near the core and the width away from the core, respectively. Spin-singlet amplitudes, nematic tensor densities, and nematic currents of FDSs exhibit rich structure and provide a complete description of static FDSs. The dark-dark-dark vector solitons, which are the Z2 topological defects in the mass superfluid order, are also discussed."

Typical profiles of FDSs and the DDD vector soliton are shown in Fig. 1.\nThe energy of a DDD vector soliton is higher than a FDS in the parameter region where the DDD vector soliton is supported [33] (see Fig. 2). Here the numerical solutions are obtained using a gradient flow method [34,35].

(54)\nFor such variations, the deformed wave functions must have the form \u03c8\u0303i = \u03c8iei\u03b4\u03b8i (r) and the corresponding transverse magnetization reads F\u0303\u22a5 = \u221a 2 ( \u03c80\u03c8 \u2217 +1e i[\u03b4\u03b80(r)\u2212\u03b4\u03b8+1(r)] + \u03c8\u22170 \u03c8\u22121ei[\u03b4\u03b8\u22121(r)\u2212\u03b4\u03b80(r)] ) .\n(55)\nIn order to keep invariant upon a global SO(2) spin rotation, namely, F\u0303\u22a5 = ei\u03c6F\u22a5, the condition\n\u03b4\u03b80(r) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8+1(r) = \u03b4\u03b8\u22121(r) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b80(r) = \u03c6 (56) must be satisfied, where \u03c6 is an arbitrary constant phase. Phase fluctuations satisfying Eq. (56) are captured by the spin singlet, as \u03b1\u0303 = e2i\u03b4\u03b80 (r)\u03b1 = e2i[\u03b4\u03b8+1(r)+\u03c6]\u03b1 = e2i[\u03b4\u03b8\u22121(r)\u2212\u03c6]\u03b1. It is also easy to see that \u03b4\u03b80(r) or \u03b4\u03b8\u00b11(r) is an overall U(1) phase variation and J\u0303 = J + n\u2207\u03b4\u03b80(r) = J + n\u2207\u03b4\u03b8\u00b11(r). It is clear that a general phase variation of \u03b1 does not necessarily have to be an overall U(1) phase change.\nFor FDSs, comparing to n, F, and \u03b4F 2z , the spin-singlet amplitude \u03b1 is a more appealing quantity to distinguish type-I from type-II FDSs as it shows a hump or a dip depending on the type (Fig. 8). The measurement of \u03b1 is in the scope of the current spin-1 BECs experiments [36]."

            "heading": "VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We have studied the Z2 topological defects in the easyplane phase of a ferromagnetic spin-1 BEC. We propose analytical Ans\u00e4tzes to describe FDSs which are the defects in the magnetic order. The Ans\u00e4tzes reduce to the exact solutions at the exactly solvable point and show good agreement with numerical results over the whole easy-plane phase. The width of type-I FDSs is captured by a single scale while the core structure of type-II FDSs require two scales. Moreover, exact DDD vector solitons, which are the Z2 defects in the mass superfluid order, are also presented. FDSs are expected to play an important role in late time dynamics of 1D quenches [26,27] and equilibrium properties at finite temperature [39].\nExperimental advances now allow plane-confined BECs with flat-bottom traps [40,41] and the measurement of transverse magnetic structures by the nondestructive imaging method [36,42], opening the possibility for detailed experimental investigations of FDSs. The so-called magnetic phase imprinting method, which has been used to experimentally create pairs of magnetic solitons [43,44], could be a suitable method to create FDSs in a ferromagnetic spin-1 BEC. Very recently, the easy-plane phase of a homogeneous ferromagnetic spin-1 BEC has been prepared in a flat-bottom trapped quasi-one-dimensional system [39]. The magnetic phase imprinting method applies circularly polarized light to imprint a phase shift of \u00b1\u03c0 onto two m = \u00b11 hyperfine components on half the system by using a magnetic shadow [43,44]. This hence realizes a \u03c0 spin rotation of the transverse magnetization of half of the system, seeding the key ingredient of a single FDS.\nIn this paper we focus on kinks/topological solitons in the easy-plane phase of ferromagnetic spin-1 BECs. A FDS is a Z2 topological defect which interpolates between oppositely magnetized domains. From another perspective, it could be useful to view FDSs as members of the soliton family in spin1 BECs and compare them with other nonlinear waves. Here we give a brief summary of the main focus of recent soliton studies in spin-1 BECs. The list is incomplete; for instance, solitons in systems with optical lattices and dipole-dipole interactions [45,46] are not included. Also we only consider systems with the finite background density, i.e., the positive density-dependent interaction strength. According to the terminologies, there are mainly two varieties. (i) Vector solitons: each component has either dark or bright soliton structure\n[47\u201352] (Ref. [52] discusses two-dimensional extensions of such excitations, i.e., vortex-bright structures). Various vector solitons in a 1D harmonically trapped spin-1 system have been recently summarized in Ref. [32]. Vector solitons may or may not correspond to topological structures in the order parameter. There are two interesting examples which are topological. One is the dark-dark-dark vector soliton in ferromagnetic BECs which is the topological defect in the mass superfluid order as discussed in Sec. IV. Another one is the brightdark-bright vector soliton in an antiferromagnetic BEC which manifests itself as a domain wall in the spin director field (the order parameter) [53]. (ii) Magnetic solitons: this soliton was initially introduced in miscible two-component BECs [54] and can be embedded into an antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC in the absence of a magnetic field [43,44,55]. One important aspect of this soliton is that it is an analytical solution which is beyond the Manakov limit. The solution is obtained with the constant density approximation which works well for weak spin-dependent coupling gs. In the context of two-component BECs, it emphasizes that there is no bright or dark soliton structure in the components, while the pseudomagnetization Fz shows a bright soliton structure. When embedding into antiferromagnetic spin-1 BECs, its configuration varies under SO(3) spin rotations [55] as what happens for FDSs at the q \u2192 0 limit [22]. The magnetic soliton is not a topological soliton as there is no invariant topological charge associated with it (neither in its original two-component formulation nor in its realizations in an antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC). FDSs do not belong to vector solitons, as not all the components of FDSs have bright or dark soliton structure. The topological nature of FDSs also clearly distinguish themselves from magnetic solitons. Moreover, exact solutions for FDSs are available at a strong spin-dependent interaction coupling (gs/gn = \u22121/2) [22,23] which is far beyond the Manakov limit (gs = 0 in the context of spin-1 BECs).\nFDSs are Ising-type magnetic domain walls. A natural question is whether Bloch-type and N\u00e9el-type magnetic domain walls could exist in the easy-plane phase. A N\u00e9eltype-like domain wall has been investigated numerically in a trapped 1D ferromagnetic BEC at q = 0 [56], which might be related to the wall defects appearing transiently in early quench dynamics from unmagnetized or partially magnetized states [25,57]. However it is not clear whether the trap potential plays the key role to sustain this structure. Searching for Bloch-type and N\u00e9el-type magnetic domain walls in the easy-plane phase of ferromagnetic BECs deserves future investigations.\nSo far we only consider excitations from a uniform ground state. In immiscible condensates, domain walls are also referred to as the interfaces between the spatially separated components of the condensate; examples are density (or pseudomagnetization Fz) domain walls in immiscible binary BECs [58\u201361], and magnetic domain walls in ferromagnetic spin-1 BECs for a negative quadratic Zeeman shift q < 0 [62]."
