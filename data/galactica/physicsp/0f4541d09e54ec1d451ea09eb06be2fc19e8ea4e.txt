Human relaxin-2 (H2 relaxin) is a peptide hormone with potent vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects, which is of interest for the treatment of heart failure and fibrosis. H2 relaxin binds to the Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 (RXFP1). Native H2 relaxin is a two-chain, three-disulfidebond-containing peptide, which is unstable in human serum and difficult to synthesize efficiently. In 2016, our group developed B7-33, a single-chain peptide derived from the B-chain of H2 relaxin. B7-33 demonstrated poor affinity and potency in HEK cells overexpressing RXFP1; however, it displayed equivalent potency to H2 relaxin in fibroblasts natively expressing RXFP1, where it also demonstrated the anti-fibrotic effects of the native hormone. B7-33 reversed organ fibrosis in numerous pre-clinical animal studies. Here, we detail our efforts towards a minimal H2 relaxin scaffold and attempts to improve scaffold activity through Aib substitution and hydrocarbon stapling to re-create the peptide helicity present in the native H2 relaxin. 1. conclusions In our investigations, we have found that our previous single-chain H2 relaxin analog, B7-33, cannot be further reduced without negatively affecting the RXFP1/7BP binding affinity, as determined in our HEK-7BP binding assay. B9-31, or another truncated analog, better serves our interest in developing potential therapeutic peptides as the reduced size is intrinsically better suited to stabilization efforts. The finding that Aib incorporation reduced helical propensity was unexpected, suggesting that sites of incorporation are important to determine the effect on the helicity of Aib residues.
