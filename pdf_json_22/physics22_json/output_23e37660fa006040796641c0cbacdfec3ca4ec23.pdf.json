    "abstractText": "We present a study on planar equilibria of a terminally loaded elastic rod wrapped around a rigid circular capstan. Both frictionless and frictional contact between the rod and the capstan are considered. We identify three cases of frictionless contact \u2013 namely where the rod touches the capstan at one point, along a continuous arc, and at two points. We show that, in contrast to a fully flexible filament, an elastic rod of finite length wrapped around a capstan does not require friction to support unequal loads at its two ends. Furthermore, we classify rod equilibria corresponding to the three aforementioned cases in a limit where the length of the rod is much larger than the radius of the capstan. In the same limit, we incorporate frictional interaction between the rod and the capstan, and compute limiting equilibria of the rod. Our solution to the frictional case fully generalizes the classic capstan problem to include the effects of finite thickness and bending elasticity of a flexible filament wrapped around a circular capstan.",

            "text": "The classic capstan problem in mechanics comprises a fully flexible filament wrapped around a rigid circular capstan (Fig. 1a), with the frictional interaction between them governed by Coulomb\u2019s inequality of static friction. The problem entails computing the maximum possible output load FL that the filament can sustain at one end, for a prescribed input load F0 at the other. The two loads are related by the well known capstan equation\nFL = F0e\u03bc\u03c6 , (1) where \u03bc is the coefficient of static friction between the filament and the capstan, and \u03c6 is the wrap angle (Fig. 1a) of the end loads.\nH. Singh harmeet.singh@epfl.ch; harmeet@vt.edu\n1 Laboratory for Computation and Visualization in Mathematics and Mechanics, Institute of Mathematics, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland\nThe classic capstan problem is often introduced in undergraduate mechanics to demonstrate the role of friction in limiting equilibrium of flexible bodies [1\u20134]. In addition to its pedagogical significance, the problem has found relevance in several diverse domains of engineering, such as textile engineering [5\u20139], theory of power transmission by belts [10\u201316], design of surgical robots [17\u201319], analysis of musical instruments [20], and even the mechanics of the DNA molecule [21]. Despite its wide use in engineering design with conservative values of the friction coefficient [10], it has long been known that equation (1) is not adequately ratified by experiments [5\u20137]. Workers in the field have typically attributed this discrepancy to primarily two reasons: i) most materials do not obey Coulomb\u2019s inequality of static friction [22], and ii) the bending elasticity of the filament is completely ignored in the derivation of equation (1) [6]. The main objective of this article is to remedy the latter shortcoming of the classical theory, by incorporating bending elasticity of the filament into the analysis.\nSome of the earliest works on including bending elasticity of the filament in the capstan problem was done by I.M. Stuart [23]. He recognized that bending elasticity would cause the filament to bow out near the contact boundaries (points s1 and s2 in Fig. 1b). Consequently, computing the contact angle \u03c6c for such a filament becomes a non-trivial task, unlike in the classic problem where \u03c6c is easily shown to be equal to the prescribed wrap angle \u03c6 of the end forces (Fig. 1a). Notwithstanding this realization, Stuart does not attempt to compute the unknown contact region (quantified by \u03c6c) in [23], and instead formulates his theory with \u03c6c prescribed. Subsequent attempts to generalize the capstan problem, such as those of Groseberg and Plate [6], McGee [7], Beflosky [10], Jung et al. [24, 25], and Gao et al. [9], have also circumvented this issue by prescribing the contact angle \u03c6c instead of the wrap angle \u03c6.\nAnother critical consequence of incorporating bending elasticity of the filament in the capstan problem, also pointed out by Stuart in [23], is the possible occurrence of point\nreaction forces at the contact boundaries [26, 27]. Any such forces would induce jumps in the internal force of the rod, and may contribute significantly to the computation of the output load FL. While some authors, such as Stuart [23], Groseberg and Plate [6], and McGee [7], have considered point forces at the contact boundaries in their models, those considerations have largely been ad hoc. Other authors, such as Beflosky [10, 12], Jung et al. [24, 25], and Gao et al. [9], have altogether ignored the possibility of point reaction forces at the contact boundaries.\nIn this article, we generalize the classic capstan problem by treating the filament as an elastic rod of finite thickness. We refer to this system as the generalized capstan problem, where we study both frictionless and frictional contact between the rod and the capstan. Contrary to the approaches taken in the literature on the problem, we treat the two ends (i.e., points s1 and s2 in Fig. 1b) of the contact region as free boundaries, namely boundaries whose locations cannot be prescribed a priori, but must be determined as part of the solution [27, 28]. A distinguishing ingredient of the solution presented in this article is a jump condition \u2013 which we derive systematically using the principle of virtual work \u2013 valid at the contact boundaries. The said jump condition not only locates the contact boundaries on the rod\u2019s centerline (and on the capstan), but also determines the jumps that the internal force and the curvature of the rod may suffer across such points.\nIn the frictionless contact case, we compute three qualitatively distinct kinds of rod equilibria, i.e., where the rod touches the capstan at one point, along a continuous arc, and at two points (Fig. 3). Our treatment of the frictionless case reveals that an elastic rod of finite length wrapped around a capstan does not require friction to support unequal loads at its two ends. In other words, force amplification across a finite length of an elastic rod can be achieved entirely by virtue of its bending elasticity. This is in stark contrast to the classic case where the absence of friction, i.e., \u03bc = 0, implies F0 = FL for any wrap angle \u03c6 of the filament, as is evident from equation (1). We classify the three aforementioned kinds of equilibria in a limit where the length of the rod is much larger than the radius of the capstan. In the same limit, we incorporate frictional interaction between the capstan and the elastic rod, and obtain a generalization of equation (1). We show that the maximum force ratio FL/F0 delivered by the generalized solution is a function of both \u03c6 and F0, as opposed to the classic case where the force ratio is independent of the latter (see equation (1)).\nGeneralizations of the capstan problem in different directions have also been treated in the literature. The effects of nonlinear friction laws on the capstan problem have been considered by Lodge and Howell [22], Beflosky [12], Jung et al. [25] and Gao et al. [9], while Liu and Vaz [29] have considered the capstan problem with external pressure applied to the filament. A notable generalization of the capstan equation to thin inextensible strings lying on arbitrary surfaces was done by Maddocks and Keller [30], and was revisited later from a variational perspective by Konyukhov [31]. Grandgeorge et al. [32] performed an experimental and theoretical study of two filaments in tight orthogonal contact, which serves as a generalization of the classic capstan problem by accounting for the filament thickness, and replacing the rigid circular capstan altogether with an identical filament. A system of a closed flexible belt hanging on two pulleys has been studied by Belyav et al. [33] and Vetyukov et al. [34], while transient dynamics of a belt-pulley system with dry friction has been analyzed by Oborin et al. [35]. More recently, Grandgeorge et al. [36] have presented a study on the stationary dynamics of a sliding elastic rod in frictional contact with a circular capstan, with applications to belt-driven pulley systems.\nThe structure of this article is as follows. We begin in Sect. 2 with a brief overview of the standard Cosserat rod theory, where we outline the balance laws, jump conditions, conservation laws, and constitutive assumptions. We setup our specific problem of interest\nin Sect. 3, and obtain relevant equations for planar deformations of an elastic rod wrapped around a rigid circular capstan. In Sect. 4, we compute three distinct kinds of frictionless contact equilibria for a finite length of an elastic rod, where the rod touches the capstan at one point, along a continuous arc, and at two points connected by an intermediate contactfree (or lift-off) region of the rod. We also compute configurations where the elastic rod in frictionless contact with the capstan supports unequal loads at its two ends. In Sect. 5, we consider a long length limit where the length L of the rod is assumed much larger than the radius R of the capstan (i.e. L/R 1), and classify the three kinds of rod equilibria from Sect. 4 in this limit. Thereafter, in Sect. 6, we introduce frictional interaction between the capstan and the rod in the long length limit, and obtain a generalization of equation (1). Finally, we end with conclusions in Sect. 7."

            "text": "Following Antman [37], we identify any configuration of an elastic rod with its centerline curve x(s) \u2208R3, and an ordered orthonormal frame of directors d i (s), i \u2208 {1,2,3}, attached to it. The parameter s is the arc-length coordinate of the centerline in some reference configuration. We will restrict our discussion to rods that are inextensible and unshearable, so that s remains the arc-length coordinate in any configuration. The inextensibility and unshearablity constraint, along with the orthonormality of the director frame, can be expressed, respectively, by the relations,\nx \u2032 = d3 , d \u2032i = u \u00d7 d i . (2) Here u(s) is the Darboux (or strain) vector associated with the director frame, and the prime denotes derivative w.r.t. s. The director components ui := u \u00b7d i , i \u2208 {1,2,3}, of the Darboux vector measure the bending strains of the rod about the directors d i .\nFor a cross-section of the rod centered at s, we denote by n(s) and m(s), respectively, the net internal force and internal moment exerted by the material in s+ on the material in s\u2212, where s\u00b1 = lim \u21920(s \u00b1 ), and > 0. The force and moment balance of a fixed material segment [s1, s2] are then given by,\n[n]s2s1 + \u222b s2\ns1\np ds = 0 , (3a)\n[m + x \u00d7 n]s2s1 + \u222b s2\ns1\nx \u00d7 p ds + \u222b s2\ns1\nl ds = 0 , (3b)\nwhere p(s) and l(s) are the external force and moment densities (per-unit length) distributed over the material segment. When all the fields appearing in (3a) and (3b) are sufficiently regular in [s1, s2], the two integral balances can be localized to obtain the following pointwise force and moment balance equations,\nn\u2032 + p = 0 , (4a) m\u2032 + x \u2032 \u00d7 n + l = 0 . (4b)\nLet s0 \u2208 [s1, s2] be a point around which p and l are highly localized. At such a point, we idealize the two fields using the description [38],\np = P \u03b4(s \u2212 s0) , l = L \u03b4(s \u2212 s0) , (5)\nwhere \u03b4(s) is the standard Dirac-delta function. We also require the position and tangent vectors to be continuous, i.e., x = 0 and x \u2032 = 0, where A = A+ \u2212 A\u2212 denotes the jump in A, across any such points. Then, using (5), we localize (3a) and (3b) around the singular point s0 to obtain the following force and moment jump conditions [27, 38],\nn + P = 0 , (6a) m + L = 0 . (6b)\nThe source terms P and L are identified, respectively, as the point force and the point moment exerted on the rod at s = s0 by its environment.1\nTo obtain a closed system of equations for the rod in regions away from any singular points, we introduce constitutive relations by assuming the rod to be hyperelastic with a straight and uniform natural configuration. This means that there exists a scalar valued strain energy density function W(u) for the rod, such that,\nm = \u2202W(u) \u2202u . (7)\nWe further assume the following quadratic form for the energy function,\nW(u) = 1 2 u \u00b7 Bu = 3\u2211 i=1 1 2 Biu 2 i , (8)\nwhere B is a 3 \u00d7 3 diagonal positive-definite stiffness matrix of the rod. Using (8) in (7) we obtain,\nm = Bu , (9) which delivers the internal moment as a linear function of the Darboux vector."

These force and moment conservation laws are, respectively, consequences of the translational and rotational invariance of the rod in ambient space, and are insensitive to the geometry and the material constituents of the rod [40]. In the generalised capstan problem, these conservation laws will hold only in the contact-free regions of the rod.\nNext, we define the following function on the centerline of the elastic rod, which will prove to be of great significance in the upcoming analysis,\nH(s) := n \u00b7 x \u2032 + m \u00b7 u \u2212 W(u) . (11)\n1For a discussion on the existence of singular forces in contact problems with various beam theories see [39].\nWe will refer to this function as the Hamiltonian function.2 Differentiating (11) w.r.t. s, and using (4a), (4b), and (2), it can be shown that in the absence of p and l, the Hamiltonian function (11) is conserved along s [27, 40\u201343, 45\u201348], i.e.,\nH(s) = H(0) . (12)\nThis law results from the translational symmetry of the rod in the arc-length coordinate s, and is valid only for hyperelastic constitutive relations [40, 49].\nAs we will see later, unlike the force and moment conservation laws (10a) and (10b), the conservation of the Hamiltonian function (12) may persist even in the presence of external load densities, particularly when the rod is in frictionless contact with a rigid surface. We will prove and make extensive use of this fact in the upcoming analysis.\nFor isotropic rods with no external moment density l, the twist m \u00b7d3 is another conserved quantity. However, for planar deformations (as in the generalized capstan problem), this conservation law holds identically true as a result of the moment balance (4b), and offers no further utility. We will therefore not expound upon this law any further."

A propagating crack in a solid, and a shock wave in a fluid, are examples of such boundaries. In the present context of an elastic rod wrapped around a capstan, the boundaries of a contact region (such as s1 and s2 in Fig. 3b), or any isolated points of contact (such as s1 in Fig. 3a, and s1 and s2 in Fig. 3c) qualify as free boundaries. In this subsection, we use the principle of virtual work to postulate a jump condition valid at such points. The said jump condition will enable us to locate the free boundaries, and determine the jumps that the internal force and the curvature of the rod may suffer across such points.\nConsider the following energy functional, augmented with the inextensibility and unshearability constraint, for a material segment [s1, s2] of the rod,\nE = \u222b s2\ns1\n[ W(u) \u2212 n \u00b7 (x \u2032 \u2212 d3)]ds . (13)\nWe consider a transformation of the arc-length coordinate s to s\u2217, where the latter is given by,\ns\u2217 \u2261 s + \u03b4s . (14)\nWe stipulate that, under a transformation of the form s \u2192 s\u2217, the variation of functional (13) equals the net virtual work expended by the external force and moment densities, i.e.,\n\u03b4E = \u03b4Wext , (15)\n2Our choice of the term \u201cHamiltonian\u201d in this context is admittedly a slight abuse of terminology. A Hamiltonian, by definition, is an explicit function of the phase space variables of a dynamical system. We, however, treat it as an implicit function of the arc-length coordinate s, whose numerical value for any given configuration of the rod coincides with the proper Hamiltonian function for hyperelastic rods defined by Dichmann and Maddocks [41]. Other workers (including the present author) have used different names, such as \u201ccontact material force\u201d [42] and \u201cmaterial stress/force\u201d [43, 44], in the past to refer to the function defined in (11).\nwhere,\n\u03b4Wext = \u222b s2\ns1\np \u00b7 \u03b4\u0303x ds + \u222b s2\ns1\nl \u00b7 \u03b4\u0303zds . (16)\nHere \u03b4\u0303x and \u03b4\u0303z are first order variations3 in the position vector, and an angle variable z conjugate to l.\nWe assume that the material segment encapsulates a free boundary identified with an unknown arc-length coordinate s0 \u2208 [s1, s2], at which p and l admit the description given by (5). Computing \u03b4E due to s \u2192 s\u2217, and localising (15) around s = s0 leads to the following condition for configurations satisfying (4a) and (4b) away from s0,\n\u2212 n \u00b7 x \u2032 + m \u00b7 u \u2212 W \u03b4s0 = P \u00b7 \u03b4\u0303x(s0) + L \u00b7 \u03b4\u0303z(s0) . (17) For brevity of exposition, the details of the computations resulting in the above expression have been deferred to Appendix A. One can immediately recognise the expression in the double brackets in (17) as the Hamiltonian function H defined in (11), while the expression on the right can be interpreted as the net virtual work expended by the reaction force P and moment L.\nNext, we place a constitutive assumption on the mechanics of the free boundary: We assume that the net work expended by the point force and the point moment at s = s0, i.e., the right side of equation (17), is zero.4 This reduces equation (17) to,\n\u2212 n \u00b7 x \u2032 + m \u00b7 u \u2212 W \u03b4s0 = 0 . (18) Since free boundaries by definition cannot be prescribed a priori, we have \u03b4s0 = 0, and consequently we conclude from above that the following jump condition must hold at s = s0,\nH = 0 . (19) We will refer to this jump condition5 as the free boundary condition from here onward.\nThere are other incarnations of (19) present in the literature on rod mechanics. For instance, one can obtain (19) from the static version of the balance of \u201cmaterial momentum\u201d for rods, posited by O\u2019Reilly, by identifying C = \u2212H and B = 0 in equation (23) of [42]. For an alternative approach to free boundary problems in rods using a quasi-static balance of energy, in lieu of (19), the reader may refer to [44]."

We identify this radius as the characteristic length scale of the problem, and therefore, from here onward, all lengths will be stated in units of R. We will refer to the two contact-free regions touching the left and the right half of the capstan as the incoming and outgoing tail respectively. Here we derive formulas needed to determine the location of the contact points, labeled by \u03b81 and \u03b82 on the capstan, and s1 and s2 on the rod\u2019s centerline.\n6Relation (26) can be obtained by invoking a geometric property of parallel curves, namely that their radii of curvatures must differ by r for all s, i.e. \u03ba(s)\u22121 \u2212 \u03baO(S)\u22121 = r . This expression delivers (26) on rearrangement.\nWe assume a Cartesian frame {ex, ey} such that its origin coincides with the center of the capstan, and ey bisects the angle \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6 (see Fig. 1). The two end forces can then be accorded the representations F0 = \u2212F0 [ cos(\u03c6/2)ex + sin(\u03c6/2)ey ] and FL =\nFL [ cos(\u03c6/2)ex \u2212 sin(\u03c6/2)ey ] . Similarly, the tangents at the two points of contact can be represented as d3(s1) = cos \u03b81ex + sin \u03b81ey and d3(s2) = cos \u03b82ex + sin \u03b82ey , where \u03b81 and \u03b82 are angles as defined in Fig. 2b.

Equation (42)1 has been obtained using nl = nl1(s1)d1(s1)+nl3(s1)d3(s1), requiring nl \u00b7 ey = 0 (by symmetry), and using nl3(s1) = H \u2212 (1/2)B\u03ba21 . Equation (42)2 has similarly been obtained using the fact that the tension at s = L/2 is given by nl3(L/2) = nl = H \u2212 (1/2)B\u03ba2L/2.\nThe two conditions needed to solve for H and \u03ba1 can then be written as,\nL (F,H ;\u03ba)|\u03ba10 + L (nl,H ;\u03ba)|\u03baL/2\u03ba1 = L\n2 , (43a)\n\u2212(1 + r) (\nH \u2212 1 2 B\u03ba21\n) tan \u03b81 + P (nl,H ;\u03ba) \u2223\u2223\u03baL/2 \u03ba1 = 0 . (43b)\n9Equation (41) is equivalent to equation (2.11) of [55], which the authors of that article described as a \u201c\u2018geometrical condition\u2019 of equilibrium\u201d representing the balance of axial thrust on the rod. We also note that since (37) is independent of the shape of the constraining rigid body, its corollary (41) is equally applicable to problems involving frictionless sleeve constraints in [55\u201357].\nThe first expression above, obtained using (29), is a statement enforcing the length of one symmetric half of the rod. To obtain the second expression, we integrated the relation nl3 = H \u2212 (1/2)B\u03ba2 from s1 to L/2, used the fact that nl3 = nl \u00b7d3 = nl \u00b7x \u2032 = (nl \u00b7x)\u2032, substituted nl \u00b7 x(s1) = \u2212(1 + r)nl sin \u03b81, and then finally enforced nl \u00b7 x(L/2) = 0 (due to symmetry) in the resulting expression. The function P in the second expression results from a variable change in\n\u222b L/2 s1\n(H \u2212 (1/2)B\u03ba2)ds from s to \u03ba via ds = d\u03ba/\u03ba \u2032, and using equation (28) to substitute for \u03ba \u2032 to yield,\n\u222b \u03baL/2 \u03ba1\n( H \u2212 12B\u03ba2 ) \u221a(\nnl\u2212H B + 12\u03ba2 )( nl+H B \u2212 12\u03ba2 ) d\u03ba = P (nl,H ;\u03ba)\n\u2223\u2223\u03baL/2 \u03ba1 . (44)\nThe explicit representation of P in terms of the Elliptic integrals of the first and second kind is provided in Appendix B. The two transcendental equations (43a) and (43b) can be numerically solved to obtain the values of H and \u03ba1, which when substituted in (27) and (30) deliver \u03b81 and s1. Furthermore, the incoming tail of the configuration can be obtained by integrating (31a) and (31b) with initial conditions (32a) and (32b), while the symmetric left half of the lift-off region can be obtained by integrating (31a) and (31b) from s1 to L/2 with the following initial conditions,\n\u03b8(s+1 ) = \u03b81 , x(s+1 ) = \u2212(1 + r) sin \u03b81 , y(s+1 ) = (1 + r) cos \u03b81 , (45a) \u03ba(s+1 ) = \u03ba1 , n1(s+1 ) = \u2212 (\nH \u2212 1 2 B\u03ba21\n) tan \u03b81 , n3(s + 1 ) = H \u2212 1\n2 B\u03ba21 .

            "text": "In this section, we consider frictionless contact in a limit where the length L of the rod is very large compared to the radius R of the capstan. We show that, in this limit, computations from the previous section undergo radical simplification, which allows for a clean classification of the three kinds of previously discussed equilibria.\nConsider the shape equation (28) valid in the incoming and outgoing tails in a typical configuration. Scaling it by the total length L (normalized by R) of the rod, we obtain ( B\nL2 \u03ba \u2032)2 + ( B 2L2 \u03ba2 \u2212 H)2 = |n|2. If the length L is large, the equation becomes a singular perturbation problem in the parameter B/L2, indicative of the existence of boundary layers in its solutions [59]. Outside the boundary layer, or the \u201couter region\u201d, we substitute B/L2 = 0 to obtain the following relation up to leading order,\nH = |n| , (46) where the negative root of the equation has been discarded. Since this relation involves two quantities conserved throughout the length of the rod, it must hold true inside the boundary layer, or the \u201cinner region\u201d, as well. In this limit, most of the bending energy of the rod gets concentrated near the boundary of the contact region, while away from it, the rod is relatively straight. Equation (46), when combined with (37), implies,\nH = F0 = FL = F , (47)\nmeaning that the applied end loads must be equal in order to maintain equilibrium. In other words, asymmetric equilibria of the kind shown in Fig. 4 is not possible in the long length limit.\nAnother consequence of (46) is that the length constraints, given by (38a), (39), and (43a), become identically satisfied, which greatly simplifies the computations of the free boundaries in all the three kinds of equilibrium, as is shown next.\nTo compute one-point contact equilibria, we use equation (38b) with (47) and obtain after some rearrangement the following expression for the rod\u2019s centerline curvature at the contact point\n\u03ba1 = 2 \u221a F\nB sin\n\u03c6 4 . (48)\nThe region in the {F,\u03c6} space with \u03ba1 \u2264 \u03bac corresponds to one-point contact equilibria, and is shown in green in Fig. 5. The location of the point of contact can be deduced from symmetry as \u03b81 = 0, which can also be confirmed by substituting (48) in (27)1. The entire configuration can then be computed following the same procedure as described towards the end of Sect. 4.1.\nWhen \u03ba1 delivered by equation (48) hits the critical curvature \u03bac for prescribed values of F and \u03c6, one-point contact transitions to line contact. In that case, \u03b81 and \u03b82 can be directly computed from (27) using equation (47), along with the fact that \u03ba = \u03bac in the contact region. Consequently, the contact angle \u03c6c = \u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 can be explicitly written as\n\u03c6c = \u03c6 \u2212 2 arccos (\n1 \u2212 B 2F \u03ba2c\n) , with F > 1\n2 B\u03ba2c , (49)\nwhere the inequality ensures that the contact pressure from equation (40), i.e., p1 = F\u03bac \u2212 (1/2)B\u03ba3c , remains non-negative.\nThe region corresponding to line contact in the {F,\u03c6} space, with p1 > 0, is shown in blue in Fig. 5a. No contact equilibria exists for the region shown in white,10 as the contact pressure between the capstan and the rod in that region becomes negative. The difference \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6c from (49) is plotted against F for different values of B in Fig. 5b. The shear force, tension, and pressure in the contact region can be computed using (40), and the incoming and outgoing tail can be constructed using the same procedure as described in the end of Sect. 4.2.\nFor \u03c6 > 2\u03c0 , and F < 12 B\u03ba 2 c , the pressure required to maintain line contact between the rod and the capstan becomes negative, leading to line contact degenerating into two-point contact. In Fig. 5, the corresponding region is shown in red. To compute such configurations, we obtain \u03b81 in terms of the unknown curvature \u03ba1 at the point of contact using equation (27)1 and (47). Thereafter, \u03ba1 can be obtained by solving (43b) numerically. Finally, the full configuration can be constructed as described towards the end of Sect. 4.3."

            "heading": "6 Frictional Contact and Limiting Equilibrium",
            "text": "We now address the last facet of the generalized capstan problem, i.e., a generalization of the classic capstan equation (1), governing limiting equilibria of an elastic rod in frictional contact with a circular capstan. Before we proceed further, a few comments on the problem are in order.\nWe showed in Sect. 4.2.1 that force amplification across a finite length of an elastic rod wrapped around a circular capstan can be achieved in the absence of frictional interactions between them. Since friction appears unnecessary to support unequal loads at the two ends of the rod, a precise definition of limiting equilibrium seems unclear. However, in the long length limit discussed in Sect. 5, relation (47) forbids frictionless equilibria with unequal end loads, which insinuates that friction is indeed necessary for force amplification in this limit. Therefore, we will pursue the generalization of the classical capstan equation (1) in the long length limit, where we define limiting equilibrium under frictional contact as the configuration which maximizes the output load FL, for a given input load F0 and wrap angle \u03c6. We will also consider only line contact between the rod and the capstan, as corollary (35) of our assumption (19) forbids any point reaction force P3 in the tangential direction at isolated points of contact.\nConsider a sufficiently long elastic rod wrapped around a circular capstan as shown in Fig. 6. Using equations (46) and (12) in the incoming and outgoing tails, along with (19) across the contact boundaries s1 and s2, we can establish the following relations,\nH(s\u22121 ) = H(s+1 ) = F0 and H(s\u22122 ) = H(s+2 ) = FL . (50) With the second relation above, the requirement of maximizing the output load FL can be transferred to maximizing the value of H(s2). The evolution of the Hamiltonian function H of the rod in the contact region is governed by the following equations obtained by substituting \u03ba = \u03bac in (25a) and (25b)\nH \u2032 = p3(1 \u2212 r\u03bac) , (51a)\nrp\u20323 = H\u03bac \u2212 p1 \u2212 1\n2 B\u03ba3c . (51b)\n10Note that for a given value of B , one can always find a finite length of the rod for which a one-point equilibrium exists at any chosen point in the white region in Fig. 5a.\nThe two ODEs above contain three unknown functions of s, namely H , p3, and p1. To obtain a closed system of equations, we assume frictional interaction between the rod and the capstan to be governed by Coulomb\u2019s inequality of static friction, which relates the frictional force density p3 and the normal pressure p1 as,\np3 \u2264 \u03bcp1 , (52)\nwhere \u03bc is the coefficient of static friction between the rod and the capstan. To maximize the value of H(s2), and consequently of the output load FL, we seek those solutions of (51a) and (51b) for which H grows at the fastest possible rate over the yet unknown contact region. This is ensured when inequality (52) saturates, and p3 attains its maximum value given by p3 = \u03bcp1. Using this equality, we eliminate p3 in favor of p1 in (51a) and (51b) to obtain the following set of equations governing limiting equilibria of the rod,\nH \u2032 = \u03bcp1(1 \u2212 r\u03bac) , (53a)\nr\u03bcp\u20321 = H\u03bac \u2212 p1 \u2212 1\n2 B\u03ba3c . (53b)\nThe above set of ODEs, which are linear in H and p1, can be integrated analytically to obtain,\nH(s) = c1 (\nA + 1 2\u03bac\n) e A\u22121 2r\u03bc (s\u2212s1) \u2212 c2 ( A \u2212 1\n2\u03bac\n) e\n\u2212 A+12r\u03bc (s\u2212s1) + 1 2 B\u03ba2c , (54a)\np1(s) = c1e A\u221212r\u03bc (s\u2212s1) + c2e\u2212 A+12r\u03bc (s\u2212s1) , (54b)\nwhere s \u2208 [s1, s2], A = \u221a 1 + 4r\u03bac\u03bc2(1 \u2212 r\u03bac), and c1 and c2 are constants given by,\nc1 = p1(s + 1 )(A \u2212 1) + \u03bac\n[ 2H(s+1 ) \u2212 B\u03ba2c ] 2A , c2 = p1(s + 1 )(A + 1) \u2212 \u03bac [ 2H(s+1 ) \u2212 B\u03ba2c ] 2A .\n(55)\nThese constants must be determined by the initial conditions p(s+1 ) and H(s + 1 ) accompanying the system (53a), (53b). To compute p(s+1 ), we invoke the jump condition (34)2 on the shear force at s1, and note that p1(s \u2212 1 ) = 0, p3(s+1 ) = \u03bcp1(s+1 ), and \u03ba \u2032(s+1 ) = 0. The said jump condition can then be rearranged as,\nr\u03bcp1(s + 1 ) = B\u03ba \u2032(s\u22121 ) \u2212 P1(s1) . (56)\nBoth p1 and P1 in the equation above are positive numbers \u2013 as the capstan can only push on the rod and not pull \u2013 and as a consequence, \u03ba \u2032(s\u22121 ) must also be positive. To maximize the growth rate of H at s+1 , the highest possible value of p1(s + 1 ) must be deduced from (56), which is ensured when P1(s1) = 0.11 This implies that at limiting equilibria no point reaction force can occur at s1.12 Consequently, we have p1(s + 1 ) = B\u03ba \u2032(s\u22121 )/r\u03bc from (56), where the term B\u03ba \u20321(s \u2212 1 ) = (\u03bac/2) \u221a B[4H(s\u22121 ) \u2212 B\u03ba2(s\u22121 )] can be obtained from (28) applied at s = s\u22121 . Finally, noting the equalities at s1 from (50), along with \u03ba(s\u22121 ) = \u03ba(s+1 ) = \u03bac from (36)2, we can write the initial conditions for (53a) at s = s+1 as,\nH(s+1 ) = F0 , p1(s+1 ) = \u03bac\n2r\u03bc\n\u221a B(4F0 \u2212 B\u03ba2c ) . (57)\nThe constants c1 and c2 in (54a) and (54b) can now be determined by substituting (57) in (55), thereby completing the description of H(s) and p1(s) in the contact region. The normal reaction force at the outgoing boundary s2 can be computed using (34)2, along with p(s+2 ) = 0 and \u03ba \u2032(s\u22122 ) = 0, to be P1(s2) = r\u03bcp1(s\u22122 )\u2212B\u03ba \u2032(s+2 ). The contact region between the rod and the capstan still remains an unknown, which we compute next.\nThe extent of contact region is measured by the length s2 \u2212 s1. Since the length of the rod is infinitely large, the precise value of s1 is irrelevant, and can be assigned an arbitrary value for simplicity leaving s2 to be the only unknown to be found. We note that s2 \u2212 s1 = (1 + r)(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82), and substitute in it \u03b81 and \u03b82 from (27). In the resulting expression we use H0 = F0 and HL = FL = H(s2) due to (50) and (12), and \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 = \u03bac due to (36)2 across s1 and s2, to obtain the following equation after some rearrangement,\narccos ( 1 \u2212 B\u03ba 2 c\n2F0\n) + s2 \u2212 s1 1 + r + arccos ( 1 \u2212 B\u03ba 2 c\n2H(s2)\n) = \u03c6 . (58)\nThe first and the third term on the left measure the angular displacements of the tangents between the two terminal ends and their corresponding contact boundaries, while the middle term measures the angular displacement of the tangent in the contact region. The above\n11This argument has precedence in [32], where limiting equilibria of a fully flexible filament of finite thickness in contact with a curved capstan was considered. 12The same conclusion in the context of an elastic rod in frictional contact with a rotating cylinder was reached in [36]. However, at variance with the present approach, the authors there employ a \u201cgeometrical argument\u201d, where they invoke the circular geometry of the capstan to arrive at this conclusion.\nequation essentially constrains the angular displacements of the tangents in the tails and the contact region to add up to the prescribed wrap angle \u03c6. The expression for H(s2) can be substituted in (58) from (54a), and the entire equation can be numerically solved to obtain s2. The output load corresponding to limiting equilibrium is then given by FL = H(s2), and the contact angle can be computed as \u03c6c = (s2 \u2212 s1)/(1 + r).\nThe surface generated by the maximum force ratios FL/F0 for an elastic rod in the {FL/F0,F0, \u03c6} space is plotted in Fig. 7a for B = 1 and \u03bc = 0.3. The corresponding surface for the contact angles \u03c6c is shown in Fig. 7b. The gray region marked on both the surfaces represents configurations with small initial force and high wrap angle where the contact pressure p1 goes negative, and must therefore be discarded. Note that unlike in the classic capstan problem, the force ratio FL/F0 in the presence of bending elasticity is also a function of the initial force F0, as can be seen in the projection of the surface in Fig. 7e. A comparison between the classic and the generalized capstan problem in Fig. 7c shows\nthat force ratios for the latter are always lower than the former. The solutions to the generalized problem asymptotically merge with the classic solution as the input force F0 tends to infinity. A typical configuration of a sufficiently long elastic rod in frictional contact with a circular capstan is shown in Fig. 6, along with the plots of the Hamiltonian function H , contact pressure p1, tension n3, and shear force n1, against the arc-length coordinate."

            "text": "We have presented a generalization of the classic capstan problem to include the effects of finite thickness and bending elasticity of the filament. The problem was referred to as the generalized capstan problem, where we modeled the filament as an elastic rod of finite thickness, and computed configurations with both frictionless and frictional contact between the rod and the capstan. Unlike much of the prior work on the subject, we treated the boundaries of the contact region as free boundaries [27, 28], and computed their location with the aid of a jump condition, systematically derived using the principle of virtual work.\nFor frictionless contact, we computed three kinds of rod equilibria, where the rod touches the capstan at one point, along a continuous arc, and at two points connected by an intermediate lift-off (or contact-free) region. Our analysis revealed that, in general, a finite length of elastic rod wrapped around a circular capstan does not require friction to sustain unequal loads at its two ends. This is in stark contrast to the classic case governed by equation (1), where friction is necessarily required for force amplification across the length of the filament. We showed this property of elastic rods to be a consequence of the conservation of the Hamiltonian function throughout its length. We then considered a limit where the length of the rod is much larger than the radius of the capstan. In this limit, we showed that frictionless contact equilibria between the capstan and the rod with unequal end loads is no longer possible. This long length limit lead to significant simplifications in the computation of frictionless equilibria, and allowed for a clean classification of the three aforementioned kinds of frictionless contact equilibria in a two parameter space of the applied end load F and wrap angle \u03c6.\nFinally, we incorporated frictional interaction between the elastic rod and the capstan under the assumption of the long length limit, and obtained a generalization of the classic capstan equation (1) to include bending elasticity and finite thickness of the rod. We showed that the maximum force ratios predicted by our model depend not only on the wrap angle \u03c6, but also on the prescribed input load F0, which is in contrast to the classic capstan problem where the force ratios are independent of the latter. We found that for any given input load F0 and wrap angle \u03c6, the maximum force ratios predicted by our model remained lower than the predictions made by the classic capstan equation (1). Since our theory inputs the wrap angle \u03c6 as opposed to the contact angle \u03c6c \u2013 which is much more difficult to enforce experimentally than the former \u2013 we hope that its validity could be put to test against simple experiments."

The resulting expression is,\nL (|n|,H ;\u03ba) := \u2212i \u221a 2B\nH + |n| F (\u03d5 |k) , (66)\nwhere F(\u03d5 |k) is the Elliptic Integral of the first kind [61, 62] given by,\nF (\u03d5 |k) = \u222b \u03d5\n0 d\u03b8\u221a 1 \u2212 k sin2 \u03b8\n, \u03d5 = arcsin (\u221a\nB 2(H \u2212 |n|)\u03ba ) , k = H \u2212 |n| H + |n| .\n(67)\nUsing the same change of variables as for the length integral from \u03ba to t and then from t to \u03b8 , the integral in (44) can be written as,\nP(|n|,H : \u03ba) := \u2212i \u221a 2B\nH + |n| [(H + |n|)E (\u03d5 |k) \u2212 |n|F (\u03d5 |k)] , (68)\nwhere F(\u03d5 |k) is given by (67), while E(\u03d5 |k) is the Elliptic Integral of the second kind [61, 62] given by,\nE (\u03d5 |k) = \u222b \u03d5\n0\n\u221a 1 \u2212 k sin2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 , (69)\nwith the same expressions for \u03d5 and k as stated in (67). Note that although L and P are in general complex valued functions, their differences between any two values of \u03ba (for fixed |n| and H ), i.e. L (|n|,H ;\u03ba)|\u03baB\u03baA and P(|n|,H ;\u03ba)|\u03baB\u03baA , are always real valued. This is due to the fact that the real components F(\u03d5 |k) and E(\u03d5 |k) (or the imaginary components of L and P) are functions of k alone [62], and get canceled out when subtracted with different values of \u03d5 (or \u03ba).\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/ 10.1007/s10659-022-09939-8.\nAcknowledgements The author is grateful to John H.
