1. **Investigate the mechanism of action of FNZ against Gram-positive bacteria.** This could be done by studying the interaction of FNZ with bacterial membranes, as well as the effects of FNZ on bacterial cell viability and metabolism. This information could help to identify new targets for antimicrobial therapy.
2. **Explore the potential of FNZ as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent.** The current study showed that FNZ is active against a range of Gram-positive bacteria, but it is not known whether it is also active against Gram-negative bacteria or other microorganisms. Further studies are needed to investigate the antimicrobial spectrum of FNZ and to determine its potential for use in treating infections caused by a variety of pathogens.
3. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of FNZ.** The current study showed that FNZ is effective in killing bacteria in vitro, but it is not known whether it is also effective in vivo. Further studies are needed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of FNZ in animal models of infection. These studies could help to determine the potential of FNZ as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of bacterial infections.
4. **Investigate the potential of FNZ for use in combination with other antimicrobial agents.** The current study showed that FNZ has synergistic effects with a number of other antimicrobial agents. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential of FNZ for use in combination with other antimicrobial agents to treat infections. These studies could help to identify new combination therapies that are more effective than monotherapy.
5. **Explore the potential of FNZ for use in the development of new antimicrobial materials.** The current study showed that FNZ is stable in a variety of conditions, including high temperatures and pH extremes. This suggests that FNZ could be used to develop new antimicrobial materials, such as coatings for medical devices or fabrics. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential of FNZ for use in the development of new antimicrobial materials.
