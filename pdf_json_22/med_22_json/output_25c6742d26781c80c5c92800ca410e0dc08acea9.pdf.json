            "text": "Uncemented short stems (length, 50\u2013100 mm) were introduced in the last decade [1\u20133] in shoulder arthroplasty, with a metaphyseal fixation in press-fit. They are now commonly implanted in current surgical practice [4,5]. Although reported midterm clinical results are good [6\u201313], some studies report signs of stress shielding [3,7\u20139,12,14], classically observed in uncemented standard-length (> 100 mm) stems [10,15,16]. Stress shielding occurs because of changes in load distributions according to Wolff\u2019s law, that lead to bone remodeling including tuberosity resorption, cortical thinning, and medial calcar osteolysis. Schnetzke et al. [17] showed that diaphyseal filling ratio (the ratio of the diameters of the stem and the humerus) >0.7 was a risk factor for stress shielding. A high rate of frontal misalignment which is a risk factor for endocortical contact and bone remodeling [18], is reported in between 5 and 47% of cases [19]. Valgus positioning seems to be associated with female gender, older age and a deltoid-sparing approach [19], while varus positioning seems to be associated with lower filling ratios and may result in arthroplasty failure in elderly women [17]. A narrower but misaligned stem carries a higher risk of distal endocortical contact, also associated with stress shielding and bone remodeling [18,20]. The challenge is therefore to implant the thinnest possible short stem without compromising its primary stability, and to align the stem with the humeral axis. During surgery, frontal alignment of the stem depends on the orientation and height of humeral head cut, entry point in the humerus, and the positioning of the compactors during humeral calibration. Peduzzi [9] highlighted the importance of humeral cut height on axis stem deviation: when the cut is too low the remaining neck can lead to valgus positioning while a too high cut can lead to varus positioning of the stem. The frontal orientation of the compactor is under the appreciation of the surgeon, without systematic radiographic use in current practice. Standard-length stems are commonly placed in anatomic alignment compared with short stems [2].\nThe aim of this cadaver study was to investigate whether correct frontal alignment (an\nangular deviation of less than \u00b1 5\u02da) [9,21] and optimal filling ratio (<0.7) [21], can be achieved by implanting uncemented short stems using compactors for uncemented standard-length stems. The primary hypothesis was that the standard-length compactors would be aligned with the longitudinal axis of the humerus. The secondary hypothesis was that the short stems would be aligned with the compactors and therefore with the humeral axis, while nevertheless having low filling ratios."

After deltopectoral approach, 2 cm of the pectoralis major tendon was released and the subscapularis tendon (if intact) was tenotomized at the anatomical neck of the humerus. The long head of the biceps tendon was also cut if still present. An entry point was made at the top of the humeral head, 1 cm medially and posteriorly from the intertubercular groove. The humeral head was cut using a guide with a 140\u02da neck angle and 10\u02da of retroversion.\nAfter using a canal finder to create a pilot hole in line with the medullary cavity, sounders were used to determine the maximum size of the cavity. The humerus was progressively prepared with a standard-length compactor in 10\u02da retroversion, to preserve the cancellous bone. The aim of the compactors is to create a bed of cancellous bone for definitive stem implantation. Compaction was therefore stopped at the first rotationally stable compactor size, not the maximum size, defined as press-fit. The goals were to implant the narrowest possible stem to minimize the metaphyseal and diaphyseal filling ratios; and to align the stem and the compactor with the diaphyseal axis to avoid cortical contact. Anteroposterior fluoroscopy was performed once the compactor was in place.\nThe corresponding short stem was then implanted with the same axis and retroversion as the compactor.

            "text": "We evaluated the frontal alignment and filling ratios of short stems implanted after humeral preparation with standard-length compactors. Standard length compactors were correctly aligned with the humeral axis in 95% of the cases, confirming our primary hypothesis. Our secondary hypothesis comparing short stems alignment with the compactors and thus with the humeral axis, while respecting low filling ratios was also confirmed. The main finding of this cadaver study is that standard-length compactors can be used to implant narrow short stems that are correctly aligned with the humeral axis.\nThe first studies of uncemented short stems reported high levels of bone remodeling due to\nstress shielding [10]. Raiss et al. [21] found that filling ratios above 0.7 were associated with a seven-fold higher risk of radiographic stress shielding and recommended implants with narrower stems if used without cementing. Although stress shielding may indeed be reduced with thinner stems, the risk of misalignment in varus or valgus is much higher [12,18]. A narrower but misaligned stem carries a higher risk of distal endocortical contact, also associated with stress shielding and bone remodeling [18,20]. Larger-diameter stems with larger filling ratios are less likely to be misaligned but more likely to induce stress shielding. The challenge is therefore to ensure the stem is aligned without increasing the filling ratio to avoid stress shielding.\nThe standard-length compactors used in this study to insert short stems had the same prox-\nimal shape as the equivalent short stems, the only difference being their length. The implanted short stem was in each case the same size as the last used compactor, allowing good press-fit. Oversizing the length of the compactor did not therefore compromise the primary metaphyseal stability of the implanted stems. Denard [2] compared the alignment of short and standard-length stems with a similar proximal design, implanted respectively after humeral preparation with short and standard-length compactors. He demonstrated that standardlength stems were placed in anatomic alignment in 98% of cases, whereas the short stem was placed anatomically in 86% cases.\nThe strong correlation found here between the orientations of the compactors and the\nstems suggests that short stems implanted in this way remain aligned with the compactor. In previous studies of short-stem positioning, the compactors used were of the same shape and length as the final humeral implant [10,19]. In a series of 159 reverse shoulder arthroplasties, La\u0308dermann et al. [19] observed stem misalignment exceeding 5\u02da in 47% of shoulders, 9% in varus, and 38% in valgus. Valgus positioning is the most frequently reported problem [9,19,22,23], with maximum deviations of 11.5\u201332\u02da, while the misalignments in our study were all less than 10\u02da. The proportion of correctly aligned (|\u03b1|< 5\u02da) short stems in our cadaveric series (85%) is in keeping with the misalignment rate reported by Raiss et al. [21] (16%) in their radiographic study of short stems. Our results therefore suggest that using standardlength compactors to implant short stems carries a low risk of misalignment.\nThe aims of humeral preparation are threefold; first, preserve cancellous bone to avoid cor-\ntical contact; second, implant the thinnest possible stem to avoid stress-shielding; and third, obtain good metaphyseal press-fit fixation. With short compactors, the implant may have to be oversized to ensure good stem alignment and sufficient proximal primary fixation. Press-fit implantation with a high filling ratio [13,21,22,24,25] has been identified as a risk factor for bone adaptation, particularly when the diaphyseal filling ratio is above 0.7 [21]. Stopping compaction at the first size with rotational stability avoids having to then oversize the stem [1,9,21] to achieve good press-fit and primary stability. In the present study, the implanted stem was size 7 or 8.5 in 90% of cases. A size 10 stem was only implanted in one case (5%), a male cadaver with a low diaphyseal filling ratio (0.4). The filling ratios in our series are lower than\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268075 May 5, 2022 10 / 13\npreviously reported [9,19,21] and were not correlated with stem alignment. The diaphyseal filling ratio was at most 0.50 and 0.38 on average, well below Raiss et al.\u2019s [21] recommended upper limit of 0.7.\nMaintaining a lateral entry point in the humerus while broaching is important to avoid\nvarus positioning of the final implant [26]. In our series, three stems were misaligned in valgus, and all the stems reproduced the slight valgus alignment of the compactor. Peduzzi et al. [9] have described how a cautious humeral head cut at the correct height is essential for good stem positioning, and that cutting too low leads to valgus deviation, while cutting too high leads to varus deviation. When analyzing the three stems implanted in valgus we noticed that in each case, the humeral cut was high, with large humeral osteophyte and massive cuff tear. The misalignment may therefore have been the result of an unsuitable entry point, too lateral into the humerus. In cases of massive cuff tear or severe arthropathy, joint modifications can make bone landmarks and the correct entry point (in line with the humeral shaft) difficult to identify. Pre-operative planning and careful optimization of the entry point into the humerus are therefore required to achieve good frontal alignment [1].\nThe limitations of our study include its small size and the absence of any clinical assessment or\nradiographic follow-up due to its cadaveric nature. Secondary varus positioning [17], can therefore not be ruled out, and only one type of prosthesis was used without pre-operative planning. Bone quality may also not have been representative because the subjects were older at death than patients generally are when undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. Bone density can also be modified by low humeral canal temperature, and rotational stability can be subjective while compacting metaphyseal cancellous bone. The absence of muscular tonus in the cadavers may have made humeral exposure and stem implantation through a deltopectoral approach easier than reported in the literature [19]. Finally the lack of control group to compare short stem implantation following metaphyseal preparation with short compactors can be discussed. Further studies after in vivo implantations with clinical follow-up are required to confirm these results in practice and evaluated long-term outcomes, notably in terms of stress-shielding induced bone remodeling.\nThe strengths of this study are the standardized and reproducible nature of the procedure\nconsidered, which corresponds to daily practice, the reproducible radiographic measurements and simple, noninvasive, operative technique with standard compactors, and without necessity of supplementary instrumentation."
