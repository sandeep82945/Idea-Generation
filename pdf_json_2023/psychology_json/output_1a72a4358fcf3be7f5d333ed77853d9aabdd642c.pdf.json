    "abstractText": "The geographic origin of agri-food products contributes greatly to their quality and market value. Here, we developed a robust method combining metabolomics and machine learning (ML) to authenticate the geographic origin of Wuyi rock tea, a premium oolong tea. The volatiles of 333 tea samples (174 from the core region and 159 from the non-core region) were profiled using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and a series of ML algorithms were tested. Wuyi rock tea from the two regions featured distinct aroma profiles. Multilayer Perceptron achieved the best performance with an average accuracy of 92.7% on the training data using 176 volatile features. The model was benchmarked with two independent test sets, showing over 90% accuracy. Gradient Boosting algorithm yielded the best accuracy (89.6%) when using only 30 volatile features. The proposed methodology holds great promise for its broader applications in identifying the geographic origins of other valuable agri-food products.",

            "text": "With the rapid growth in international trade and raising awareness among consumers of the importance of food safety, issues around food authenticity have been receiving increased public attention in recent years1. Consumers have become increasingly concerned about what foods to buy, where they are from and how they are produced. Agricultural and food products derived from certain core production regions are perceived to have a higher quality and hence a higher market value. Despite strict legislative control, adulteration and false labeling are still prevalent in the food industry driven by economic incentives. This further aggravates unfair market competition, reduces consumer trust, and leads to potential risks to the public health2,3. Therefore, the effective identification of the geographic origin of foodstuffs is essential for ensuring food quality and protecting consumer interest. Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world, due to an array of nutritional and health benefits. Regional provenance is among the most important attributes that tea consumers associate with high-quality tea products4\u20138. Many teas are named based on the geographic regions where they are grown. The most prominent examples are Darjeeling from India, Ceylon from Sri Lanka as well as Westlake Longjing tea and Wuyi rock tea from China. These tea products are highly sought after by tea enthusiasts, the fact that also makes them prime targets for fraud. For tea authentication, a variety of analytical tools have been developed, such as stable isotope analysis, multi-element profiling and metabolite fingerprinting9. The first two methods, used alone or more often in combination, are acknowledged as being effective for the authentication of a wide range of food products including tea4,10,11. However, both measurements require laborious sample preparation and are hence technically demanding. Metabolomics in conjunction with chemometrics has emerged as one of the most promising methods to distinguish tea origins\nbecause of a wide metabolite coverage, high sensitivity and high throughput5\u20138,12,13. In particular, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a technique well-recognized for its capability to simultaneously monitor a large number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with proven reproducibility, has become a central platform for tea metabolomics research13\u201318. Solid phase microextraction (SPME), which integrates sampling, volatile extraction and concentration in one single step, greatly simplifies the sample preparation and thus is widely adopted in food analysis19. In recent years, SPME in coupled with GC-MS has been successfully applied to assess the geographic origins of various food products, such as rice20,21, wine22 and oranges23. As such, VOC fingerprinting by SPME-GC-MS represents a promising approach to identify the geographic origin of tea. In the past decade, machine learning (ML), which is capable of generating high accuracy outputs from massive volumes of multidimensional data, has found wide applications in many domains of science for pattern recognition, classification and prediction24\u201326. In particular, its surging popularity for food authentication, origin identification and quality control is amply demonstrated by the increasing number of publications on this topic over the past few years, highlighting the great potential for food inspection and classification27\u201332. Although metabolomics has been widely applied in tea research, the application of ML techniques in their analyses has just emerged5,13. Nonetheless, the sample sizes in existing studies are typically small. As the performance of a specific classifier could be greatly influenced by the sample size, a small sample set is prone to errors in pattern recognition. Moreover, not enough efforts have been dedicated to distinguishing tea from a narrow geographic scope. Wuyi rock tea (WRT), belonging to a preeminent subcategory of oolong tea, is internationally renowned for intriguing flavors and lingering taste with a heavy roast note33,34. WRT has been granted protected geographical indication (PGI) status in China, which in\n1College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China. 2FAFU-UCR Joint Center for Horticultural Biology and Metabolomics, Haixia Institute of Science and Technology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China. 3Fujian Farming Technology Extension Center, Fuzhou 350003, China. 4Wuyishan Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Wuyishan 354300, China. 5Wuyishan Tea Bureau, Wuyishan 354300, China. 6Fujian Vocational College of Agriculture, Fuzhou 350119, China. 7These authors contributed equally: Yifei Peng, Chao Zheng. \u2709email: yang@ucr.edu; haozhilong@126.com; xmyu0616@fafu.edu.cn\nwww.nature.com/npjscifood\nPublished in partnership with Beijing Technology and Business University\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () :,;\nthe broad term includes all oolong tea produced in Wuyishan City of Fujian Province using suitable tea varieties and manufactured by the unique traditional processing technology. The distinctive flavor of WRT is decided by tea cultivars, the growth environment and the manufacturing procedures35. More than 200 tea cultivars are used to manufacture WRT, in which \u201cRougui\u201d and \u201cShuixian\u201d occupy the largest planting area. In practice, WRT is further classified based on the growing location. The core production region features a small area of only about 60 kilometers inside of the national preserve of Mount Wuyi, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Northwest Fujian4. WRT produced in this region (also known as \u201cZhengyan\u201d) is perceived to have higher quality, referred locally as \u201crock charm and floral fragrance\u201d or \u201crock rhythm\u201d36,37. What makes \u201cZhengyan\u201d WRT so special is the unique terroir where it grows-volcano rock, steep cliff, mineral rich soil, abundant rainfall and high humidity-creating a perfect natural environment for tea cultivation that no other place could find. As expected, WRT produced in the core region usually fetches a high price tag. Due to the conflict between high demand and limited production in the core area, there are many imitations on the market, most of which are grown in areas surrounding the authentic core region and are considered to be inferior in terms of tea quality4. The conventional method for quality evaluation of WRT, like other tea, relies heavily on the experience of tea tasters, which not only suffers from inconsistency and inaccuracy, but also lacks quantitative information38. For this reason, the development of rapid and reliable analytical methods to trace the geographic origin of WRT is highly demanded. In this study, we explored the feasibility of ML-based analyses of\nVOC metabolomes to differentiate the origins of Rougui WRT. Our results show that our ML-based methods accurately authenticate the geographic origin of WRT based on volatile metabolites. The\nproposed methodology will be useful for managing adulteration or fraudulent labeling of WRT in the market and may be broadly applicable to tracing the origins of other valuable food and agricultural products.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overview of VOCs of WRT from different origins SPME was combined with gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) to identify and quantify VOCs of 333 Rougui WRT samples collected from the main growing regions in the north and northwestern parts of Fujian Province, China (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1). Representative total ion chromatograms (TICs) of WRT samples from the core production region (hitherto referred as \u201cCRT\u201d) and the non-core production region (hitherto referred as \u201cNCRT\u201d) are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1. We detected a total of 2128 features by GC-MS analysis. QC samples, prepared by pooling equal aliquots of all samples, were used to monitor the system performance. Principle component analysis (PCA) performed on all samples showed that QC samples were in a tight cluster in the center of the plot, indicating that the established GC-MS method was stable enough to allow for the subsequent analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). After applying hierarchical cluster analysis to remove outliers, 276 samples were retained. A final data matrix composed of 447 metabolic features was obtained after eliminating those with low variance (mean absolute deviation \u22640) and was subsequently used for multivariate analysis. Among these, 44 volatiles were identified in comparison with authentic standards and 236 volatiles were tentatively identified by comparing their mass spectra and retention indices with those recorded in the database (NIST 20) or literatures (Supplementary Table S2).\nMt.Wuyi Scenic Resort\nLianhua Peak Bishi Cliff\nTianxin Cliff\nWater Curtain Cave\nNiulan Valley\nBaoguo Cliff\nDakenkou\nMatou Cliff Wuyuan Ravine\nJiulong Nest Sanyang Peak\nZhu Nest\nHuiyuan Cliff Huiyuan Valley\nTianchejia\nTianyou Peak\nManting Peak Wuyi Palace\nSangu Stone\nHuxiao Cliff\nYixiantian Mazhen Peak Shizi Peak\nPucheng\nWuyishan\nMt.

Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) has shown to generally outperform the unsupervised PCA method in classifying various agri-products39\u201343. Therefore, it was applied in the current study. As expected, a better separation between groups was achieved by this method (Fig. 2b). The permutation test generated intercepts of R2= 0.23 and Q2=\u22120.26, thus confirming the validity of the OPLS-DA model (Fig. 2c).\nDifferential VOCs between CRT and NCRT samples The volcano plot analysis highlighted 111 differential VOCs (57 up and 54 down) for the CRT collection in comparison with NCRT (Fig. 2d). Ultimately, 20 VOCs with significant differences, including esters (6), hydrocarbons (5), ketones (3), alcohols (3), heterocycles (2) and one unknown odorant, were identified based on the criteria of variable importance in projection (VIP) > 1, p < 0.05 and |fold change | >1.5 (Table 1; Fig. 3). The amounts of volatiles with floral, fruity and woody scents (i.e., hortrienol, \u03b1-terpineol and 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one) differed mostly between CRT and NCRT (Fig. 3). Generated by the Maillard reaction44, 2-acetylpyrrole with a nutty and bread note was also found at a higher level in CRT. Such nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds with pyrrole and pyrazine structures largely account for the characteristic aromas in WRT resulting from roasting37,45. Additionally, several odorless branched alkanes (i.e., 2,3,6,7-tetramethyloctane, 4,6-dimethyldodecane, 2,3,5,8-tetramethyldecane and 4-ethyl-tetradecane) accumulated to higher levels in CRT than in NCRT, presumably originating from the thermal degradation of terpenes during tea processing46. In contrast, esters that exhibited significant differences were exclusively present in higher proportion in NCRT (Fig. 3). Of note, most of them (i.e., hexyl 2-methylbutyrate, hexyl hexanoate, trans2-hexenyl caproate and \u03b2-phenylethyl butyrate) impart fruity and\ngreen flavor. Likewise, a higher accumulation of 5,6-epoxy-\u03b2ionone (fruity and floral) and ethyl isopropyl ketone (minty) was noted in NCRT. In a most recent study, sixteen VOCs (mostly aldehydes and terpenes) were shown to differ among Rougui WRT collected from different cultivation regions47. These volatiles, however, have little overlap with what we discovered in the current study, most likely due to the fact that only three tea samples were analyzed in their study and thus were not representative of WRT in general. Taken together, we can conclude that CRT and NCRT present clearly distinct aroma profiles, with a stronger floral, woody and roasted notes in the former group while stronger fruity and green odors in the latter group. It should be noted that roasting, which is a critical process unique to the processing of WRT, is essential for transforming tea aroma from being floral to roasted and woody37. In this regard, it is possible that the differences in the volatile concentrations of CRT and NCRT are not totally due to differences in geographical locations, but may also be influenced by the tea processing procedures. Furthermore, other factors such as climatic conditions, years of harvest and agricultural practices obviously have a certain influence, as demonstrated in similar studies conducted for other agri-products29,32,48. Further studies are needed to determine which factor exerts the largest impact on the individual component of WRT aromas.\nAuthentication of the origin of WRT with machine learning To develop a model for the origin discrimination of WRT, we selected 176 volatile features that could be stably detected across different batches of tea samples for model training (Supplementary Table S2). The dataset was randomly split into two parts in a stratified fashion: 80% (220) for model training and 20% (56) for model validation. Although ML algorithms such as random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) have been widely employed to discriminate the geographic origins of various agricultural products, no single ML method could perform best\n-20 -15 -10 -5 0 5\n10 15\n-25 -20 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 20 NCRT CRT\nIntercepts: R2=(0.0, 0.23) Q2=(0.0, -0.26)\nt[1]\nt[2 ]\na\n-25 -20 -15 -10\n-5 0 5\n10 15\n-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 1.05104 * t[1]\nNCRT CRT1.\n50 13\n* to\n[1 ]\nb\nR2X[1]=0.148, R2X[2]=0.083 R2X[1]=0.077, R2Xo[1]=0.123\nPCA Score Plot OPLS-DA Score Plot\n-0.6\n-0.2\n0.2\n0.6\n-0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nR2Y (Cum) Q2 (Cum)\n200 permutations\nc OPLS-DA Validation Model\nCorrelation coefficient \u22123 .0 \u22122 .0 \u22121 .0 0.0 1.0 2.0\n18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0\nVolcano Plot: CRT v.s.

In addition, the complexity of different ML algorithms varies. To generate the optimal model with the highest prediction accuracy and generalization ability, we tested 15 classification algorithms of Scikit-learn on the VOC metabolomics data to match model and data complexities in our study (Supplementary Dataset 1). Based on five-fold cross-validation, multilayer perceptron (MLP) achieved the best performance, yielding a prediction accuracy of 92.7% (Table 2). MLP, as the name suggests, consists of interconnected neurons that process data through three or more layers. Belonging to a class of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANN), MLP is well recognized for the prediction power and is widely used to extract information from complex and nonlinear relationships49. From the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve, the AUC (area under the curve) value was computed as 0.96, which validated the generalization ability of the MLP model (Fig. 4a). High classification accuracies (>85%) could also be achieved by other classifiers, especially quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), passive aggressive (PA) and SVM (Table 2). Given the promising performance of MLP on internal cross validation, a test set was built with the remaining 20% of samples (56 in total) for external validation. About 91.1% of tea samples from the test set were correctly classified (Fig. 4b). To further benchmark the model performance, we then performed an\n1.8e\u221209****\n1.7e\u221207****\n5.8e\u221206****\n6.7e\u221205****\n0.00056***\n4.6e\u221205****\n9.7e\u221215****\n5.2e\u221207****\n3.5e\u221205****\n0.0032**\n1.5e\u221205****\n2.5e\u221210****\np < 2.22e\u221216****\np < 2.22e\u221216****\n1.6e\u221208****\n3.8e\u221210****\n8.8e\u221210****\n4.3e\u221210****\n1.8e\u221205****\n3.2e\u221210****\nIsopentyloxyethyl acetate trans\u22122\u2212hexenyl caproate Unknown \u2212terpineol \u2212phenylethyl butyrate\n4,6\u2212dimethyldodecane Ethyl isopropyl ketone Hexyl 2\u2212methylbutyrate Hexyl hexanoate Hotrienol\n2,3,5,8\u2212tetramethyl\u2212decane 2,3,6,7\u2212tetramethyl\u2212octane 3,5,11,15\u2212tetramethyl\u22121\u2212hexadecen\u22123\u2212ol 4\u2212ethyl\u2212tetradecane 4\u2212methyl\u22123\u2212pentene\u22122\u2212one\n(E)\u22125,6\u2212epoxy\u2212 \u2212ionone (Z)\u22122,6,10\u2212trimethyl\u22121,5,9\u2212undecatriene 2\u2212acetyl\u22125\u2212methylfuran 2\u2212acetylpyrrole 2\u2212phenylethyl hexanoate\nNCRT CRT NCRT CRT NCRT CRT NCRT CRT NCRT CRT\n\u22125.0\n\u22122.5\n0.0\n2.5\n\u22125.0\n\u22122.5\n0.0\n2.5\n\u22125.0\n\u22122.5\n0.0\n2.5\n\u22125.0\n\u22122.5\n0.0\n2.5\nva lu\ne\nFig. 3 Boxplots showing the levels of differential volatile metabolites between CRT and NCRT Wuyi rock tea samples based on Wilcoxon test.

Overall, these results unequivocally demonstrate the effectiveness of VOC metabolomics in tandem with MLbased algorithms for provenance discrimination of WRT. By applying SVM modeling to the combined data from isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), Lou and coworkers achieved 97.7% accuracy when discriminating between WRT and non-WRT4. Since IRMS and ICP-MS are both time-consuming and costly, the proposed metabolomics approach in the current study offers advantages in terms of simplicity and speed while still maintaining comparable accuracy. It serves as a good alternative for the authentication of WRT.\nMachine learning-based prediction model with a simplified input dataset In an effort to reduce computing power while improving prediction efficiency, a further attempt was made to establish a ML prediction model using a simplified input dataset. Towards this goal, the top 30 metabolic features with the highest VIP scores in the OPLS-DA analysis, instead of the original 176 metabolic features, were included to construct a new model. As the metafeatures of the simplified dataset were changed, we tested the aforementioned 15 ML algorithms again to match the model and data complexities (Supplementary Dataset 2). For the simplified dataset, the GB model demonstrated the highest accuracy (89.6%) and AUC values (0.93) among all tested algorithms, slightly higher\nthan 86.8% accuracy obtained by the same model on the original dataset (Table 2; Fig. 5a). Furthermore, 87.5% and 94.1% accuracies were attained on the test and validation sets, respectively, indicating that a satisfactory prediction performance could still be realized with a much-reduced dataset (Fig. 5b, c). Although the MLP model produced an acceptable accuracy (83.2%) for the training set, accuracies for the test sets dropped to below 80%, implying that overfitting may occur and thus degrade the prediction performance. This is not unexpected, given that MLP is prone to overfitting when adopted for the unknown samples and hence usually requires a large number of parameters and extended data training in order to achieve a good generalization on the test set50. In contrast, the GB algorithm is typically optimal for small datasets and has proven to outperform deep learning when the training data is not sufficient51. Therefore, GB is more advantageous than MLP regarding the overfitting risk and robustness when a simplified dataset is considered. In summary, the present study demonstrates the geographic origin discrimination of 333 WRT samples, the largest panel tested as far as we know, using a strategy combining VOC fingerprinting with ML. The predictive modeling of VOC metabolomics data has proven to be a highly promising and powerful tool to confirm the authenticity, quality, and origin of WRT. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrate a terroir impact on the flavor of WRT and 20 VOCs are identified to distinguish CRT from NCRT. It should be noted that VOC profiling could be affected by several factors, such as tea storage conditions and processing methods. Moreover, fraud cases in real-life scenarios are even more complicated.
