    "abstractText": "The integration of renewable energy into the grid demands the development of increasingly more sophisticated power electronics configurations. This situation has motivated the current boom of new power converter topologies. Even though most of the recently proposed converters are scattered across the literature, some of them can be classified in a taxonomical fashion. This action permits studying their properties, generalizing principles, and generating new contributions with improved features\u2014these are the general aims and overall research direction reported in this paper. In this work, we are devoted to generating a well-defined corpus of knowledge by characterizing an emerging family of DC-DC double dual converters. We show that the underlying principle of dualization can be fully enclosed within a systematic procedure and applied not only to classical DC-DC converters but also to any modern configuration. This contribution thus permits the diversification of new topologies that hold relevant features, such as low common-mode voltages and currents, high-voltage gains, and efficient harmonic mitigation\u2014among other advantages that are oriented to renewable energy management. We thus demonstrate that systematic dualization leads to the development of new designs with enhanced features. Experimental results of new topologies are also presented to corroborate the proposed principles and advantages. INDEX TERMS Power electronics, DC-DC power converters, double dual converters.",

Even though most of the recently proposed converters are scattered across the literature, some of them can be classified in a taxonomical fashion. This action permits studying their properties, generalizing principles, and generating new contributions with improved features\u2014these are the general aims and overall research direction reported in this paper. In this work, we are devoted to generating a well-defined corpus of knowledge by characterizing an emerging family of DC-DC double dual converters. We show that the underlying principle of dualization can be fully enclosed within a systematic procedure and applied not only to classical DC-DC converters but also to any modern configuration. This contribution thus permits the diversification of new topologies that hold relevant features, such as low common-mode voltages and currents, high-voltage gains, and efficient harmonic mitigation\u2014among other advantages that are oriented to renewable energy management. We thus demonstrate that systematic dualization leads to the development of new designs with enhanced features. Experimental results of new topologies are also presented to corroborate the proposed principles and advantages.\nINDEX TERMS Power electronics, DC-DC power converters, double dual converters.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSwitching mode power supplies play a central role in many applications, representing an important part of all electronic equipment. The increasing energy consumption and the problems related to climate change make renewable energy sources of particular importance. Some renewable energy technologies, such as fuel cells and PV panels, require DC-DC converters to increase their output voltage and track the maximum power point of operation [1]-[2].\nRenewable energy imposes strict requirements for power conversion beyond the classical (second-order) family of DCDC converters that encompasses the traditional buck, boost, and buck-boost converters [1], shown in Fig. 1.\nThe family of traditional fourth-order converters, such as the Cuk, Sepic, Zeta, etc. [1], shown in Fig. 2. In order to meet such strict specifications such as high-voltage gains and current-ripple mitigation, a recently proposed converter with two inductors and two capacitors, referred to as the double dual boost converter (DDBC), was introduced in [3] (see Fig. 3(d)). However, even though it has fourth energy storage components, the DDBC cannot be identified as a classical fourth-order converter (as those in Fig. 2) since its principle of operation varies considerably, and it contains two transistors. Furthermore, the DDBC structure consists of two switching stages, as shown in Fig. 3, by interleaving structures (in both the upper and lower switching stage) [3].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The basic family of DC-DC converters (a) buck, (b) boost, and (c) buck-boost topologies.\nThe DDBC has been competitive with respect to the classical Interleaved Boost Converter (IBC) [4]. It has advantages such as low input current ripple (similar to the IBC), large voltage gain (larger than the IBC), and modular structure. Therefore, several research works have recently dedicated a full analysis to this converter, which includes design and experimental verification [5], applications [6]-[9], modeling and control [10]-[16], and modulation strategies with special purposes [17]-[19].\nNote that the circuit in Fig. 3(d) shares a similar structure as the one proposed in [3] and later studied in [5]-[19]. However, the circuit in Fig. 3(d) is drawn in a planar way, which does not affect the circuit\u2019s operation. In addition to DDBC, several topologies with the double dual interconnection have been recently introduced to the literature [20]-[44]; this includes, for example, the buck [20], the Cuk [23], the multilevel boost [29], Fly-Back [35], the combination of converter [36]-[38], inverted double dual boost [41].\nWe can hence consider double dual converters as an emerging family of topologies. The main advantage of the double dual circuits against non-double dual configurations is lower voltage stress in semiconductors and lower energy storage required to achieve a particular input and output switching ripple specification. At first sight, a couple of issues might discourage the use of double dual converters, e.g., the higher number of components and the fact that some transistors are not grounded. However, we can notice that the increment of component count is equivalent to the interleaving connection of the converter. Consequently, comparisons between double dual and classical converters must consider the interleaving feature. Then when weighted against the interleaved features, double dual converters have the same number of components compared to traditional solutions. Furthermore, the ungrounded connection of transistors is a common issue that has been successfully solved in other configurations, such as traditional synchronous rectified converters, in which bootstrap gate drivers have been used as a solution.\nThis article explores the double dual boost converter initially introduced in [45] and other converters that can be characterized as part of the same family. As the main contribution of this paper, we present a systematic procedure to obtain double dual (DD) converters out of any general modern topologies, which permits the exploitation of emerging features. A comparative evaluation is also\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Finally, we also present a review of DD converters that have been recently introduced to the power electronics literature. In fact, among all the review papers that can be found in the literature, this is the first article that is devoted to identifying and generalizing double-dual topologies\u2014including the generation of new configurations. Some DD converters share the advantage of getting low common-mode voltage at the output side, which is a benefit in renewable energy generation applications.\nExperimental results with one of the topologies are\npresented to corroborate the principle of the proposition."

            "text": "Double Dual (DD) topologies can be defined as converters with at least one upper and one lower switching stage (can be interleaved stages on both upper and lower sides). If the converter's input and output share a common ground, a double dual connection can be implemented. Fig. 4 shows a commonground DC-DC converter with one power stage (PS1). It is considered that both input (+in1) and output (+out1) have a positive voltage with respect to the converter ground (g1).\nThe first step is to draw a second power stage, as shown in Fig. 4(b), but twisted 180\u00b0 in a way that the positive side of the input voltage vg is connected to the reference of the second power stage (g2), and the reference of the input voltage is connected to the input (+in2). That would mean the second power stage is connected to an input with inverted polarity. Then power semiconductors must be turned 180\u00b0 inside the second power stage (PS2) to prevent a short circuit. The inversion of the source polarity is a known procedure in DCDC converters [1], [46].\nWe apply the proposed procedure to the boost converter (see Fig. 3(a)) to obtain its double dual version (see Fig. 3(d)). The first step is to add a second converter (drawn at the left), which is a copy of the original converter twisted in the counterclockwise direction at 180\u00b0 (see Fig. 3(b)).\nThe second step is to invert semiconductors. Since the voltage polarity of the second stage is inverted, reversing the semiconductors makes their operation consistent with the new input voltage polarity, see Fig. 4(c). The DD boost converter is shown in Fig. 3(d).\nThe DD buck converter, recently studied in [20], provides the following advantages: (i) it can be used as an inverter, and (ii) it generates low common-mode voltage [20].\nFollowing the previously described procedure, new double dual converters can be derived to complete the family of DCDC DD converters. Fig. 5 shows the basic family of double dual converters. For example, the DD buck-boost converter shown in Fig. 5(c) has been derived following the described procedure."

Let us start with the first advantage:\nIn converters with discontinuous input current, the input current gets twice the switching frequency, which still helps reduce the size of EMI filters if necessary.\nTo demonstrate those advantages, let us consider a comparative evaluation with the boost converter (Fig. 6(a)), and the double dual boost (Fig. 6(c)), the interleaved (2-\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In renewable energy sources, the voltage depends on the current. Therefore, the behavior can be approximated in the following manner: the maximum power is obtained when the source current is 8.5A and 35V; as the current decreases, the voltage increases (linearly for the example) in a way that the minimum power point is obtained when the current is 1A while the voltage is 50V.

The converter then must operate within a voltage gain of 4 to 5.71. Furthermore, there is an input current ripple constraint. The maximum allowable ripple is 0.85A (10% of the rated current) at the maximum power operating condition (when the current from the source is 8.5A). The switching frequency is 50kHz.

For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 1\nThe peak current is slightly larger (7.5% larger) than in the interleaved boost converter, but the required inductance is considerably smaller. This is because the stored energy in both inductors is 5.5mJ, resulting in the exercise's smallest inductors.\nFig. 7 shows the input current ripple of all three topologies\nwith the parameters shown in Fig. 6.\nAll converters have the same current ripple when the input voltage is 35V. This is expected since it was the design specification. Still, it can also be observed that the traditional and the interleaved boost have an increase in their input current ripple as the input voltage is decreasing, in contrast to the double dual boost in which the input current ripple decreases. This is because the input current ripple presents a compromise against the stored energy or the inductance in inductors; Fig. 8 shows the stored energy in inductors; their peak value is related to the size of the physical inductor [1],[22].\nIt is evident that the double dual boost converter requires a smaller inductor against the traditional boost but also against\nthe interleaved boost. Both may have more than two phases in the case of the interleaved boost and the double dual boost, but the advantage remains. As can be seen, the reduction of the stored energy requirements on capacitors is due to the increase in voltage gain. Another advantage is the reduction of voltage stress on semiconductors. In all cases, semiconductor voltage stress is calculated as (5).\n1\ng\nstress\nV V\nD = \u2212 . (5)\nA larger voltage gain results in a smaller duty cycle, which also reduces the voltage stress in semiconductors. The result of this comparison can be verified by theoretical analysis or by computer simulation.\nOn the other hand, a disadvantage of the double dual boost converter is that one of the drains of the transistors (s2) is not connected to the input ground. A kind of inverted bootstrap can be implemented. Furthermore, the load and the source do not share a common ground; double dual converters can be used in applications in which common ground is not required. Those applications may include renewable energy generation systems [15]-[20].\nFrom the present example, we can corroborate that the energy stored by inductors is smaller in the double dual boost converter, with respect to the traditional interleaved boost configuration. This is due to a significant reduction in the inductance value, which is required to achieve the same specified input current ripple. The double dual boost requires approximately 60% of the inductance that is required by the interleaved boost converter (see Fig. 6). On the other hand, the peak current increases only slightly from 5.33A to 5.72A (about 7%). It is then important to emphasize that this peak energy increase is not caused by the double dual interconnection per se. In fact, the average current is the same for inductors in the interleaved boost and the double dual boost converter. The small increase is fully ascribed to the inductance reduction, which can be considered as a relevant advantage in terms of the inductor size and costs.\nAdditionally, it can be noticed that the provided example considers computations for both converters with respect to the same input current ripple. Since, the inductors in the double dual boost resulted in a smaller size, it is a straightforward matter to use a smaller inductance specification that can match the same peak current through inductors. In such case, the double dual boost converter would require inductances equal to 227.8 \u00b5H, which are still lower than the 267.65 \u00b5H of the traditional interleaved boost converter.\nTo complement this analysis, an efficiency comparison of the three topologies under discussion is presented, see in Fig. 9. The same design parameters were used to calculate conduction and switching losses, as well as the overall converters\u2019 efficiency. The output power and input voltage were adjusted to be consistent with the polarization curve of a fuel cell. From the graphic, it can be seen that for low power, the single stage boost converter is more efficient than the\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 1\ninterleaved and DD topologies. This is mainly due to the switching losses, which become more significant in the topologies with more semiconductor devices. Additionally, from 150W to 300W the interleaved and double dual topologies become more efficient than the traditional boost converter. The double dual converter is more efficient than the interleaved boost converter at the rated power this is due to the smaller duty cycle required to obtain the 200V output voltage.\nThe cost of the converters can be then evaluated in terms of the component expenses and power density. For example, since the output of the double dual boost converter has a modular structure, requiring small capacitors instead of a single high voltage capacitor, the converter scores high in power density and bypasses the need of expensive highvoltage output capacitors. In addition, even when the component count of the double-dual topology is slightly higher, the voltage/current ratings of the components (inductors and semiconductors) are smaller, which results in lower cost component-wise.\nAdditionally, there is an important advantage of doubledual configurations with respect to traditional topologies, in terms of minimization of common mode currents. Fig. 10 shows two feasible inverter topologies, the classical H-bridge inverter and the double dual buck converter [20], Fig. 10 also shows the ground path, in which parasitic capacitances may drain a small amount of current from the source chassis, and through the system ground, this is called common-mode current.\nThis was first observed in large power motor drivers [47]- [49]. Currently, a similar phenomenon is observed in renewable energy applications, for example, in grid-tie transformer-less inverters [50]-[51]. Parasitic capacitances shown in Fig. 10 can be small and present a relatively large impedance at the grid frequency. Still, they may present a low impedance at the switching frequency and their harmonics. There are already limitations to this current in international\nstandards, i.e., the DIN VDE 0126\u20131-1 requires their RMS value to be smaller than 300 mA [51]-[52].\nIt was demonstrated in [20] that the double dual buck converter helps to reduce the amount of common-mode current considerably. It also can be observed from Fig. 10(b) the ground resistance path has a continuous voltage, while in Fig. 10(a), it has a discontinuous voltage (pulsating at the switching frequency.\nWe can conclude that the DD boost is the most studied topology of the family (see Fig. 5). It exhibits higher voltage gains than the traditional interleaved boost configurations, requiring less energy storage to achieve the same input current ripple specification. Furthermore, the DD buck has been recently studied (Fig. 10), and its main advantage is that it can produce positive, negative, or alternating voltage, and then it can be used as an inverter. In addition, as an advantage against the traditional H-bridge, the DD buck has low common mode voltage and current. Finally, the double dual buck-boost is the only converter which has not been fully explored, with no evident advantages. Its dualization results in a step-up converter topology."

It provides continuous input and output current, which is a remarkable difference from the traditional topology in which both input and output current is discontinuous.\nFC converters preserve the same gain of traditional converters, and thus the voltage gain of DD-FC converters can also be expressed as (7), (8), and (10).\nThe DD-FC buck-boost converter is of special interest because its input current is continuous, which is in sharp contrast with the DD-FC boost and DD-FC buck converters, as well as with some other converters where the input current is pulsating. Moreover, the DD-FC buck-boost can be configured as an interleaving structure, which can further reduce the input current ripple. In addition, current ripple canceling techniques can also be designed and implemented to obtain zero input current ripple for a specific duty cycle [16].\nIn Table 1 we summarize the main converter specifications encompassing output voltage gains, voltage stress across semiconductors and input current ripples for the five traditional DC-DC converter topologies (boost, buck, buckboost, SEPIC and C\u00fak) and their double-dual versions. It is worthwhile to notice that some parameters depend on the duty cycle value.\nWe conclude that the family of flying capacitor double-dual converters hold the advantages of their classical counterparts.

For example, [36] combines an upper buck with a lower boost module, which provides bidirectional power flow without synchronous rectification. In [37], a combination of an upper series-capacitor boost is presented (see [38]) for the single topology with a lower stage of a simple boost topology.\nWe conclude that emerging topologies can be connected in a double-dual fashion. This means that there are plenty of possibilities that have not been yet explored, and their dualization opens the door for a whole new area of DC-DC converter research.\nVI. INVERTED (SOURCE AND LOAD) TOPOLOGIES\nDC-DC converters may be designed for unidirectional power flow or bidirectional power flow [1]. The way of transforming a unidirectional converter into a bidirectional converter is by adding new transistors in an antiparallel connection with the original diodes plus new diodes in an antiparallel connection with the original transistors. For instance, applying this procedure to the buck converter would lead to the converter shown in Fig. 18(a), which can now work as a boost converter if the source and load are exchanged.\nThis procedure can also be applied to a DD converter. For instance, the bidirectional DD boost converter was used in [39] for a battery management system that requires bidirectional power flow. If transistors and diodes/transistors are simply exchanged, then the buck converter of Fig. 1(a) becomes the boost converter of Fig. 1(b) and vice-versa.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

It should not be surprising that some of those topologies are already available in the literature.\nFor example, Fig. 19(a) shows the inverted DD boost converter, while Fig. 19(b) shows a recently proposed topology [40], which is, in essence, the same circuit of Fig.8(a) with an output low pass filter. In the same way, [41] presents a DD version of an inverted series-capacitor buck converter.\nIt is worth noticing that the current through the inductors shown in this subsection is negative since the power flow is opposite, but voltage polarities do not change. Fig. 20 shows the inverted version of the DD buck and DD buck-boost converter.\nThe same procedure for the exchange between source and load can be applied to the DD SEPIC and DD Cuk converter shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12, respectively.\nFlying capacitor converters can also admit the exchange between source and load; hence three other converters can be derived, see Fig. 14. Other examples of inverted versions of DD converters can be found in [42]-[43].\nWe conclude that the source and load inverted topologies hold the advantages of the DD boost converter, as they can be exploited for buck implementations, as shown in [40]. This represents a significant advantage since, as mentioned before, some buck-boost topologies lose their ability to buck the voltage when connected in a double dual form.

These benefits have been initially explored for the double-dual boost converter; see e.g., [10] and [15].\nThe first relevant advantage is the fact that in contrast with traditional interleaved topologies, double-dual configurations do not require closed-loop current balancing. This follows from the fact that the converter output capacitors are not required to exhibit the same voltage. This advantage permits simplifying the control implementation as reported in [10],[15]. Additionally, as reported in [15], the point of perfect input current ripple cancellation can be arbitrarily selected, as opposed to the traditional point-of-view when perfect cancellation only occurs with a duty cycle, e.g., equal to 0.5.\nIn both [10],[15], it is also reported that the small-signal and large-signal models of double-dual configurations can be easily handed in discrete time, which facilitates a digital implementation.

These results are in good agreement with the theoretical expectations.\nIn Fig. 24, the same converter variables are plotted but now using nominal input voltage Vg=24V and varying the output power with the following levels: 100W (Fig. 24(a)), 150W (Fig. 24(b)), 250W (Fig. 24(c)). As can be seen, in all cases, not only the current through each inductor is smaller than the input current, but also the input current ripple is smaller than the individual inductors\u2019 ripple. The voltage ratio between capacitor C4 and C6 is the same in all cases and correspond to a portion of the output voltage.\nThe converter was also tested under closed-loop control for dynamic performance verification. As can be seen in Fig. 25, the input voltage was suddenly changed from 20V to 36V (Fig. 25(a)) and back from 36V to 20V. In both cases, the input current and output voltage present an overshoot with a bounded response and settling time from the transitions of about 10ms. Furthermore, due to the change of operating\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In this case, the output power was changed from 100W to 250W (Fig. 26(a)) and back from 250W to 100W (Fig. 26(a)). Again, the behavior of the converter is stable, and the input current and output voltage variables are well-bounded with almost no overshoot.\nTo get a better idea of the performance of the double dual converter compared to the single stage circuit, an additional prototype was built for the converter shown in Fig. 21(a) using similar specifications of the DD version, as can be seen in Table 3.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIGURE 24. Relevant signals for varying output power under Vg=24V and Vo=200 V. The signals include the switching functions for s1, input current ig, current through inductors iL1 and iL2, voltage across capacitors vC4 and vC6, and the output voltage, for (a) PO=100W, (b) PO=150W, (c) PO=200W.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In Fig. 27 relevant waveforms of the two converters, operating in steady state, are shown.\nIt can be seen that the input current is larger in the case of the single stage converter due to the lower efficiency. Both converters have similar input current ripple, however, the inductor in the case of the single stage circuit is five times larger than each individual inductor in the DD circuit which result in a lower density converter. The output capacitor of the single stage circuit needs to hold the whole output voltage compared to the DD version in which all capacitors are rated for only a portion of the output voltage.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

            "text": "This article is dedicated to the family of Double Dual (DD) converters. It initially explores the double dual boost converter and proposes a systematic procedure to obtain DD topologies from existing topologies. The article also presents other members of the family of DD converters, either derived from the basic second-order converter as well as the four-order converters and flying capacitor converters. Finally, we introduce a short survey of DD converters available in the literature and presented in an individual manner. In contrast to other reviews of DC-DC converters available in the literature, this is the first one dedicated to double dual topologies, which are emerging as a strong field in DC-DC converter research. Some of the presented topologies utilize the change of power flow along with the double dual connection.\nDouble dual converters show advantages such as a larger voltage gain in the case of a boost converter or a lower voltage gain in the case of a buck converter. Furthermore, most of them have a continuous (non-pulsating) voltage from the input to the output reference, resulting in a low common-mode voltage desirable in renewable energy applications.\nA particular converter was obtained with the described procedure, and an experimental prototype was built. Finally, the results with one of the new topologies are presented to corroborate the principle of the described topological derivation."
