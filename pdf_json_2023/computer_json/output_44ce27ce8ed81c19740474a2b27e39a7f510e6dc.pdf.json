    "abstractText": "The dichromatic number ~ \u03c7(D) of a digraph D is the least integer k for which D has a coloring with k colors such that there is no monochromatic directed cycle in D. The digraphs considered here are finite and may have antiparallel arcs, but no parallel arcs. A digraph D is called k-critical if each proper subdigraph D of D satisfies ~ \u03c7(D) < ~ \u03c7(D) = k. For integers k and n, let \u2212\u2192 ext(k, n) denote the minimum number of arcs possible in a k-critical digraph of order n. It is easy to show that \u2212\u2192 ext(2, n) = n for all n \u2265 2, and \u2212\u2192 ext(3, n) \u2265 2n for all possible n, where equality holds if and only if n is odd and n \u2265 3. As a main result we prove that if n, k and p are integers with n = k+p and 2 \u2264 p \u2264 k\u22121, then \u2212\u2192 ext(k, n) = 2( ( n 2 ) \u2212(p+1)), and we give an exact characterisation of k-critical digraphs for which equality holds.

Digraphs are always assumed to be finite and simple, that is,\n\u2217Universite\u0301 Co\u0302te d\u2019Azur, CNRS, Inria, I3S, Sophia-Antipolis, France (email:lucas.picasarri-arrieta@inria.fr), financial supports: DIGRAPHS ANR-19CE48-0013 and EUR DS4H Investments ANR-17-EURE-0004.\n\u2020Technische Universita\u0308t Ilmenau. Inst. of Math. PF 100565, D-98684 Ilmenau, Germany (email:michael.stiebitz@tu-ilmenau.de)\nno loops and no parallel arcs in the same direction are allowed. However, digraphs may have antiparallel arcs, that is, two arcs with opposite directions between the same pair of vertices. For a digraph D, we denote the vertex set of D by V (D), and the arc set of D by A(D). The number of vertices of D is called the order of D, denoted by |D|. A digraph D with |D| = 0 is said to be empty, in this case we also write D = \u2205. A digraph is said to be acyclic if it contains no directed cycle as a subdigraph.\nLet D be a digraph. An acyclic k-coloring of D is a map \u03d5 : V (D) \u2192 C with color set C = {1, 2, . . . , k} such that for each color c \u2208 C the subdigraph of D induced by the color class \u03d5\u22121(c) = {v \u2208 V (D) | \u03d5(v) = c} is acyclic. We denote by ACk(D) the set of acyclic k-colorings of D. The dichromatic number of D, denoted by ~\u03c7(D), is the least integer k \u2265 0 for which ACk(D) 6= \u2205. This coloring concept for digraphs, introduced in 1982 by Neumann-Lara and Erdo\u030bs (cf. [10], [24]) generalizes the ordinary coloring concepts for graphs and has been studied in numerous papers until today (cf. [2], [3], [9], [13], [15], [22], [23], [25], [26]).\nLet k be a non-negative integer. We call a digraph D critical and kcritical if every proper subdigraph D\u2032 of D satisfies ~\u03c7(D\u2032) < ~\u03c7(D) = k. Note that any digraph D has a critical subdigraph with the same dichromatic number as D. Hence several problems related to the dichromatic number can be reduced to critical digraphs. Critical digraphs were first introduced and investigated by Neumann-Lara [24]. Let \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k) denote the class of k-critical digraphs, and for an integer n, let\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, n) = {D \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k) | |D| = n}.\nNote that ~\u03c7(D) = 0 if and only if D = \u2205, and ~\u03c7(D) \u2264 1 if and only if\nD is acyclic. Consequently, \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(0) = {\u2205}, \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(1) = {K1}, and \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(2) is the class of directed cycles. In 2014, Bokal, Fijavz\u030c, Juvan, Kayll and Mohar [3] proved that the decision problem whether a given digraph D satisfies ~\u03c7(D) \u2264 2 is NP-complete. Hence a characterization of the class \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k) for fixed k \u2265 3 is unlikely. In this paper, we are interested in the extremal function \u2212\u2192 ext(k, n) defined by\n\u2212\u2192 ext(k, n) = min{|A(D)| | D \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, n)}.\nThe following theorem, which is the main result of this paper, implies a classical result for critical graphs that was obtained by Gallai [12] in the 1960s.\nMain Theorem. Let n, k and p be integers satisfying n = k + p and 2 \u2264 p \u2264 k \u2212 1. Then \u2212\u2192 ext(k, n) = 2( ( n\n2\n)\n\u2212 (p2 + 1)).\nWe also characterise exactly the digraphs for which equality holds."

            "text": "The term graph in this paper always refers to a finite undirected graph without multiple edges and without loops. For a graph G, we denote by V (G) and E(G) the vertex set and the edge set of G, respectively. The order of G, denoted by |G|, is the number of vertices of G. If |G| = 0, then G is called the empty graph, briefly G = \u2205. As usual, Kn denotes the complete graph of order n, and Cn denotes the cycle of order n with n \u2265 3. A cycle is called odd or even depending on whether its order is odd or even.\nFor a digraphD we use the following notation. Let u and v be two distinct vertices of D. Then we denote by a = uv the arc a whose initial vertex is u and whose terminal vertex is v; u and v are then said to be the ends of the arc a. The two arcs uv and vu are said to be opposite arcs. We say that u and v are adjacent in D if uv or vu belongs to A(D). If u and v are adjacent in D, we also say that u is a neighbor of v in D, and vice versa. If uv \u2208 A(D), then we say that v is an out-neighbor of u and u is an in-neighbor of v. By N+D(v) we denote the set of out-neighbors of v; by N\u2212D(v) the set of in-neighbors of v. Then d + D(v) = |N +\nD(v)| is the out-degree of v in D, and d\u2212D(v) = |N \u2212\nD (v)| is the in-degree of v in D. Given X, Y \u2286 V (D), let AD(X, Y ) = {a \u2208 A(D) | a = uv, u \u2208 X, v \u2208 Y }. We denote by D[X ] the subdigraph of D that is induced by the vertex set X , that is, V (D[X ]) = X and A(D[X ]) = AD(X,X). A digraph D\n\u2032 is called an induced subdigraph of D if D\u2032 = D[V (D\u2032)]. If X is a subset of V (D), then we define D \u2212 X = D[V (D) \\ X ]. If X = {v} is a singleton, we use D \u2212 v rather than D \u2212X . For an arc set F \u2286 A(D), let D \u2212 F denote the subdigraph of D with vertex set V (D) and arc set A(D) \\F . If F = {a} is a singleton, we write D\u2212 a instead of D\u2212 F . We say that D is a ~Cn if D is a\ndirected cycle of order (length) n, respectively a directed n-cycle, where n \u2265 2. A digraph D is called acyclic if D contains no directed cycle as a subdigraph.\nA complete biorientation of a graph G is a digraph that can be obtained from G by replacing each edge e of G by two opposite arcs with the same ends as e, we denote the resulting digraph by D\u00b1(G). SoD\u00b1(K1) = K1, and D\u00b1(K2) = ~C2 is a directed cycle of order 2, such a digraph is also refereed to as a digon. An orientation of a graph G is a digraph D obtained from G by directing every edge of G from one of its ends to the other one. An orientation of a graph is also called an oriented graph. Note that a digraph is an oriented graph if and only if it is digon-free."

A graph G is called critical and k-critical if every proper subgraph G\u2032 of G satisfies \u03c7(G\u2032) < \u03c7(G) = k. Let CRI(k) denote the class of k-critical graphs, and for n \u2265 0, let\nCRI(k, n) = {G \u2208 CRI(k) | |G| = n}.\nClearly, if G \u2208 CRI(k), then |G| \u2265 k and equality holds if and only if G = Kk. For k \u2264 2, Kk is the only k-critical graph. In particular, CRI(0) = {\u2205},\nCRI(1) = {K1}, and CRI(2) = {K2}. Furthermore, Ko\u0308nig\u2019s theorem about bipartite graphs implies that\nCRI(3) = {Cn | n \u2261 1 (mod 2)}.\nA good characterization of CRI(k) with fixed k \u2265 4 is very unlikely. It is known that if k \u2265 4, then CRI(k, n) 6= \u2205 if and only if n \u2265 k and n 6= k+1. The concept of critical graphs is due to G. A. Dirac. In the 1950s he established the basic properties of critical graphs in a series of papers (see [5], [6] and [7]), and the study of critical graphs has attracted a lot of attention since then. Dirac also started to investigate the function ext(k, n) defined by\next(k, n) = min{|E(G)| | G \u2208 CRI(k, n)}\nas well as the corresponding class\nEXT(k, n) = {G \u2208 CRI(k, n) | |E(G)| = ext(k, n)}\nof extremal graphs. For a detailed discussion of the many partial results related to this extremal function the reader is referred to the survey by Kostochka [18] (see also [21]).\nIt is easy to show that every graph in CRI(k) with k \u2265 1 has minimum degree at least k\u22121, which gives the trivial lower bound 2ext(k, n) \u2265 (k\u22121)n. By Brooks\u2019 famous theorem [4] it follows that 2ext(k, n) = (k \u2212 1)n if and only if n = k or k = 3 and n is odd. In 1957 Dirac [7] (see also [8]) proved that 2ext(k, n) \u2265 (k \u2212 1)n + k \u2212 3 for every k \u2265 4 and n \u2265 k + 2. For k \u2265 3, we denote by DG(k) the class of graphs that can be obtained from two disjoints Kk\u2019s by splitting a vertex of one Kk into an edge of the other Kk. So a graph G belongs to DG(k) if and only if the vertex set of G consists of three non-empty pairwise disjoint sets X, Y1 and Y2 with\n|Y1|+ |Y2| = |X|+ 1 = k \u2212 1\nand two additional vertices v1 and v2 such that G[X ] and G[Y1 \u222a Y2] are complete graphs not joined by any edge in G, and X\u222aYi is the neighborhood of vi in G for i \u2208 {1, 2}. Then it is easy to show that DG(k) \u2286 CRI(k, 2k\u22121). The class DG(k) was introduced and investigated by Dirac [8] and by Gallai [11]. Dirac [8] proved that EXT(k, 2k\u22121) = DG(k) for every k \u2265 3. In 1963, Gallai published two fundamental papers [11] and [12] about the structure of critical graphs. In particular, he proved the following two remarkable results.\nTheorem 2.1 (Gallai 1963). Let G be a k-critical graph of order n. If n \u2264 2k \u2212 2, then the complement of G is disconnected.\nTheorem 2.2 (Gallai 1963). Let n = k + p be an integer, where k, p \u2208 N and 2 \u2264 p \u2264 k \u2212 1. Then\next(k, n) =\n(\nn\n2\n)\n\u2212 (p2 + 1) = 1\n2 ((k \u2212 1)n+ p(k \u2212 p)\u2212 2)\nand EXT(k, n) is the class of graphs G that can be obtained from two disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2 with G1 = Kk\u2212p\u22121 and G2 \u2208 DG(p+1) by joining each vertex of G1 to each vertex of G2 by exactly one edge.\nIn 2014 Kostochka and Yancey [20] established a lower bound for ext(k, n) that is sharp when k \u2265 4 and n \u2261 1 (mod (k\u22121)). In particular, they proved that if k \u2265 4, then\nlim n\u2192\u221e\next(k, n)\nn =\n1 2 (k \u2212 2 k \u2212 1 ). (2.1)\nFurthermore, Kostochka and Yancey [21] proved that\next(4, n) =\n\u2308\n5n\u2212 2\n3\n\u2309\n(2.2)\nAs pointed out in [21] the above result and its short proof leads to a short proof of Gro\u0308tzsch\u2019 famous Dreifarbensatz [14] saying that any planar triangle free graph G satisfies \u03c7(G) \u2264 3."

Theorem 2.8 implies that a decomposable critical digraph is the Dirac join of its indecomposable critical subdigraphs. In this sense, the indecomposable critical digraphs are the building elements of critical digraphs. In 2019, Ste\u030chl\u0301\u0131k [28] proved the following result, thereby answering a question proposed in [2]. Note that this result applied to bidirected graphs implies the decomposition result for critical graphs due to Gallai (see Theorem 2.1). Ste\u030chl\u0301\u0131k\u2019s proof uses matching theory. However, one can also use the hypergraph version of Theorem 2.1 obtained by Stiebitz, Storch and Toft [27].\nTheorem 2.9 (Stehl\u0301\u0131k 2019). If D is an indecomposable critical digraph, then |D| \u2265 2~\u03c7(D)\u2212 1.\nSketch of Proof : Let D \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k) with |D| \u2264 2k \u2212 2.

Then \u03c7(H) = k and \u03c7(H\u2212 v) < k for every vertex v of H . Then H has a subhypergraph H \u2032 such that \u03c7(H \u2032\u2032) < \u03c7(H \u2032) = \u03c7(H) = k for every proper subhypergraph H \u2032\u2032 of H \u2032. Furthermore, we have that V (H \u2032) = V (H). Then, by [27, Main Theorem 1], H \u2032 is obtained from the disjoint union of two nonempty subhypergraphs by adding all 2-edges between these two subhypergraphs. Since e is a 2-edge of H if and only if D[e] is a digon, we obtain that D is decomposable.\nThe complement of a digraph D, denoted by D, is the digraph with V (D) = V (D) and A(D) = {uv | uv 6\u2208 A(D)}. So if D has order n, then D\u222aD = D\u00b1(Kn). Clearly, a non-empty digraph D is indecomposable if and only if D is connected."

Thus we obtain that\n(3) D = DP \u229eDQ \u229eDR, where DP = D \u00b1(Kp) and DQ \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(2q).\nNote that p is the number of dominating vertices of D, and q is the number of dominating directed cycles of D.\nTo establish a lower bound for p, let P = [1, s] \\ P . Then P = R \u222a Q and D = DP \u229e DP . For i \u2208 P , we have that ki \u2265 2 and so, by (2), |Di| \u2265 2ki \u2212 1 \u2265 3 2 ki, where equality holds if and only if Di = ~C3. From Theorem 2.8 and (1) it follows that kP = p and kP = k\u2212 p. For the order of D, it then follows from (1) and (2) that\n|D| = p+ \u2211\ni\u2208P\n|Di| \u2265 p+ 3\n2\n\u2211\ni\u2208P\nki = p+ 3 2 (k \u2212 p),\nwhich is equivalent to p \u2265 3k \u2212 2|D|. Clearly, p = 3k \u2212 2|D| if and only if DP is the Dirac join of 1 2 (k \u2212 p) disjoint ~C3\u2019s. This proves (a).\nFor i \u2208 R, we have ki \u2265 3 and so, by (2), |Di| \u2265 2ki \u2212 1 \u2265 5 3 ki, where equality holds if and only if Di \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(3, 5). From Theorem 2.8 we conclude\nthat kP = p, kQ = 2q, and kR = k \u2212 p \u2212 2q. For the order of D we then obtain that\n|D| = p+ \u2211\ni\u2208Q\n|Di|+ \u2211\ni\u2208R\n|Di| \u2265 p+ 3q + 5\n3\n\u2211\ni\u2208R\nki = p+ 3q + 5 3 (k \u2212 p\u2212 2q),\nwhich is equivalent to 2p+ q \u2265 5k\u2212 3|D|. Clearly, 2p+ q = 5k\u2212 3|D| if and only if Di = ~C3 for all i \u2208 Q and Di \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(3, 5) for all i \u2208 R. Thus (b) is proved.\nIn the remaining of this section, we discuss some consequences of Theorem 3.1.\nFor a digraph K and a class of digraphs D, define K\u229eD = {K\u229eD | D \u2208 D} if D 6= \u2205, and K \u229e D = \u2205 otherwise. If D is a digraph property (i.e., a class of digraphs closed under taking isomorphic copies), then we do not distinguish between isomorphic digraphs, so we are only interested in the number of isomorphism types of D, that is, the number of equivalence classes of D with respect to the isomorphism relation for digraphs. Clearly, the number of isomorphisms types of the class \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, n) is finite.\nFrom Theorem 3.1(a) it follows that \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, k + 1) = K1 \u229e \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k \u2212 1, k) if k \u2265 3. Since \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(2, 3) = { ~C3}, we have the following result by induction on k.\nProposition 3.2. For every integer k \u2265 2,\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, k + 1) = {D\u00b1(Kk\u22122)\u229e ~C3}.\nTheorem 3.1(b) implies that a 4-critical digraph on 6 vertices either contains a dominating vertex or two disjoint dominating directed triangles. Hence we have \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(4, 6) = (K1 \u229e \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(3, 5)) \u222a { ~C3 \u229e ~C3}. If k \u2265 5, Theorem 3.1(a) implies that every k-critical digraph on k+ 2 vertices contains at least one dominating vertex. \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, k+2) = K1\u229e \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k\u22121, k+1) if k \u2265 5. Therefore we obtain the following by induction on k.\nCorollary 3.3. For every integer k \u2265 4,\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, k + 2) = ( D\u00b1(Kk\u22124)\u229e ~C3 \u229e ~C3 ) \u222a ( D\u00b1(Kk\u22123)\u229e \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(3, 5) ) .\nLet \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI\u2217(k, n) be the class consisting of all digraphs in \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, n) with no dominating vertex. For k-critical digraphs on k + p vertices, the following is a nice consequence of Theorem 3.1. In particular, it implies that the number of k-critical digraphs on k + p vertices (up to isomorphism) is bounded by a function depending only on p.\nCorollary 3.4. For every integer k, p such that k > 2p \u2265 4,\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(k, k + p) =\n2p \u22c3\n\u2113=2\n{ D\u00b1(Kk\u2212\u2113)\u229e \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI\u2217(\u2113, \u2113+ p) }\nProof. Let D be a k-critical on k + p vertices. Then |D| = k + p < 3 2 k. Let s be the number of dominating vertices of D. By Theorem 3.1(a), D =\nD\u00b1(Ks) \u229e D \u2032 where D\u2032 belongs to \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI\u2217(\u2113, \u2113 + p). It remains to show that \u2113 \u2208 [2, 2p]. Since p \u2265 2, we obviously have \u2113 \u2265 2. On the other hand, D\u2032 contains no dominating vertex, so |D\u2032| \u2265 3 2 \u2113 (by applying Theorem 3.1(a) on D\u2032). We deduce\n|D\u2032| = \u2113+ p \u2265 3\n2 \u2113.\nThis implies \u2113 \u2264 2p as desired."

The following result clearly implies the main Theorem.\nTheorem 4.1. Let p, k, n \u2208 N such that 1 \u2264 p \u2264 k\u2212 1 and n = k+ p. Then\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 EXT(k, n) = D\u00b1(Kk\u2212p\u22121)\u229e \u2212\u2192 DG(p+ 1).\nAs a consequence, we have\n\u2212\u2192 ext(k, n) =\n{ 2 ( n\n2\n)\n\u2212 3 if p = 1 2 (( n\n2\n) \u2212 (p2 + 1) ) otherwise.\nProof. We proceed by induction on k. If k = 2, then p = 1 and we have \u2212\u2212\u2192 EXT(2, 3) = { ~C3} = \u2212\u2192 DG(2). If k = 3, then p \u2208 {1, 2} and we have \u2212\u2212\u2192 CRI(3, 4) = {D\u00b1(K1) \u229e ~C3} = \u2212\u2212\u2192 EXT(3, 4) (by Proposition 3.2) and \u2212\u2212\u2192 EXT(3, 5) = \u2212\u2192 DG(3) (by Theorem 2.6). So Theorem 4.1 holds for k = 2 and k = 3. We now assume k \u2265 4. We also assume that 2 \u2264 p \u2264 k\u2212 2, for otherwise the result is a consequence of Proposition 3.2 or Theorem 2.6. Let n = k+ p and let D \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2192 EXT(k, n). We will show that D belongs to digraph class D\u00b1(Kk\u2212p\u22121)\u229e \u2212\u2192 DG(p+1), which implies the result since every digraph in this class contains exactly 2 (( n\n2\n) \u2212 (p2 + 1) ) arcs.\nCase 1: D contains a dominating vertex v. Then D\u2032 = D\u2212v is a (k\u22121)-critical digraph on n\u22121 vertices. Moreover, D\u2032 must contain exactly \u2212\u2192 ext(k \u2212 1, n\u2212 1) arcs. If this is not the case, there exists a (k\u22121)-critical digraph D\u0303 on n\u22121 vertices such that |A(D\u0303)| < |A(D\u2032)|, and K1 \u229e D\u0303 contradicts the minimality of D.\nSince n \u2264 2k \u2212 2, we have (k \u2212 1) + 1 \u2264 n \u2212 1 \u2264 2(k \u2212 1) \u2212 1, which allow us to apply the induction hypothesis on D\u2032. Hence D\u2032 belongs to D\u00b1(Kk\u2212p\u22122)\u229e \u2212\u2192 DG(p+1). SinceD is obtained fromD\u2032 by adding a dominating vertex, we deduce that D belongs to D\u00b1(Kk\u2212p\u22121)\u229e \u2212\u2192 DG(p+ 1) as desired.\nCase 2: D contains a dominating ~C3 and no dominating vertex. Let us denote D = ~C3\u229eD\n\u2032. Then D\u2032 is a (k\u22122)-critical digraph on n\u22123 vertices. Observe that n\u22123 \u2264 2(k\u22122)\u22121. Note also that n\u22123 \u2265 k\u22121, for otherwise D\u2032 is the complete digraph on k \u2212 2 vertices, which implies that D contains a dominating vertex. Hence we may apply the induction on D\u2032, which implies that D\u2032 contains at least 2 (( n\u22123\n2\n) \u2212 ((p\u2212 1)2 + 1) )\narcs. We deduce the following.\n|A(D)| = |A(D\u2032)|+ 3 + 6(n\u2212 3)\n\u2265 2\n((\nn\u2212 3\n2\n)\n\u2212 ((p\u2212 1)2 + 1)\n)\n+ 3 + 6(n\u2212 3)\n= 2\n((\nn\n2\n)\n\u2212 (p2 + 1)\n)\n\u2212 5 + 4p\n\u2265 2\n((\nn\n2\n)\n\u2212 (p2 + 1)\n)\n+ 3.\nwhere in the last inequality we used p \u2265 2. This is a contradiction to the\nminimality of D, since every digraph in D\u00b1(Kk\u2212p\u22121) \u229e \u2212\u2192 DG(p + 1) contains exactly 2 (( n\n2\n) \u2212 (p2 + 1) ) arcs.\nCase 3: D does not contain any dominating vertex nor dominating ~C3. Let t be the number of connected components of D\u0304. Since n \u2264 2k \u2212 2,\nby Theorem 2.9 we know that t \u2265 2. Then\nD = D1 \u229eD2 \u229e . . .\u229eDt\nwhere D1, . . . , Dt are the connected components of D\u0304. For every i \u2208 [t], Di is a ki-critical digraph on ni vertices. Since it is not decomposable, Theorem 2.9 implies ni \u2265 2ki \u2212 1.\nLet s be the number of indices i for which ni = 2ki\u22121. Assume first that s \u2264 1, then we have\nn = t \u2211\ni=1\nni \u2265 t \u2211\ni=1\n2ki \u2212 1 = 2k \u2212 1.\nThis is a contradiction since n \u2264 2k\u22122. Assume then that s \u2265 2. We assume without loss of generality that n1 = 2k1 \u2212 1 and n2 = 2k2 \u2212 1. Since D does not contain any dominating vertex nor dominating ~C3, we have k1, k2 \u2265 3. Hence we have n1 \u2265 k1 + 2 and n2 \u2265 k2 + 2.\nThe minimality of D implies that D1 uses exactly \u2212\u2192 ext(k1, n1) arcs. By\ninduction, D1 then belongs to \u2212\u2192 DG(k1). Analogously, D2 belongs to \u2212\u2192 DG(k2). This implies the following.\n|A(D1 \u229eD2)| = 2\n((\n2k1 \u2212 1\n2\n)\n\u2212 ((k1 \u2212 1) 2 + 1)\n)\n+ 2\n((\n2k2 \u2212 1\n2\n)\n\u2212 ((k2 \u2212 1) 2 + 1)\n)\n+ 2(2k1 \u2212 1)(2k2 \u2212 1).\nOn the other hand, the minimality of D implies that D1 \u229e D2 contains exactly \u2212\u2192 ext(k1 + k2, 2(k1 + k2) \u2212 2) arcs. We know that every digraph in K1 \u229e \u2212\u2192 DG(k1 + k2 \u2212 1) contains exactly 2 (( 2k1+2k2\u22122\n2\n)\n\u2212 ((k1 + k2 \u2212 2) 2 + 1)\n)\n. We finally reach the following contradiction to the minimality of |A(D1\u229eD2)|.\n|A(D1 \u229eD2)| \u2212 2\n((\n2k1 + 2k2 \u2212 2\n2\n)\n\u2212 ((k1 + k2 \u2212 2) 2 + 1)\n)\n= 4k1k2 \u2212 4k1 \u2212 4k2 + 2\n\u2265 2.\nThis concludes the proof.\nTheorem 4.1 applied to bidirected graphs gives Gallai\u2019s result (Theorem 2.2). Gallai\u2019s original proof was much longer, since he did not use Dirac\u2019s result from 1974. On the other hand, Gallai\u2019s result combined with the Kotochka\u2013Yancey bound for ext(k, n) implies Dirac\u2019s result, since the Kostochka\u2013Yancey bound is better that the Dirac bound if n \u2265 2k."
