    "abstractText": "The identification of key regulatory factors that control osteoclastogenesis is important. Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are discrete functional entities. However, the complexities of circRNA expression as well as the extent of their regulatory functions during osteoclastogenesis have yet to be revealed. Here, based on circular RNA sequencing data, we identified a circular RNA, circFam190a, as a critical regulator of osteoclast differentiation and function. During osteoclastogenesis, circFam190a is significantly upregulated. In vitro, circFam190a enhanced osteoclast formation and function. In vivo, overexpression of circFam190a induced significant bone loss, while knockdown of circFam190a prevented pathological bone loss in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse osteoporosis model. Mechanistically, our data suggest that circFam90a enhances the binding of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, promoting AKT1 stability. Altogether, our findings highlight the critical role of circFam190a as a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis, and targeting circFam190a might be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating pathological bone loss.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are discrete functional entities. However, the complexities of circRNA expression as well as the extent of their regulatory functions during osteoclastogenesis have yet to be revealed. Here, based on circular RNA sequencing data, we identified a circular RNA, circFam190a, as a critical regulator of osteoclast differentiation and function. During osteoclastogenesis, circFam190a is significantly upregulated. In vitro, circFam190a enhanced osteoclast formation and function. In vivo, overexpression of circFam190a induced significant bone loss, while knockdown of circFam190a prevented pathological bone loss in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse osteoporosis model. Mechanistically, our data suggest that circFam90a enhances the binding of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, promoting AKT1 stability. Altogether, our findings highlight the critical role of circFam190a as a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis, and targeting circFam190a might be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating pathological bone loss.\nExperimental & Molecular Medicine (2023) 55:2051\u20132066; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-023-01085-y"

            "text": "Osteoclasts play a central role in bone metabolism1\u20134. The regulation of osteoclasts is often disrupted under pathological conditions: excessive osteoclastogenesis is involved in various bone loss diseases, including osteoporosis, autoimmune arthritis, and bone metastasis, while defective osteoclastic function leads to osteopetrosis5. Therefore, identifying the key regulatory factors responsible for osteoclast differentiation is crucial for understanding the physiology and pathology of the skeletal system. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a family of noncoding RNAs, are generated from backsplicing of pre-mRNAs to form covalently closed transcripts6. Initially deemed erroneous byproducts of splicing, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are now known to be distinct functional entities that critically affect various biological processes and human diseases. These processes encompass fundamental aspects such as development, aging, and differentiation7,8. Notably, several recent studies have linked circRNAs to bone metabolism9\u201311: Zhai et al. reported that hsa_circ_0008500 could promote osteoblast mineralization by acting as a miR-1301-3p sponge9; Li\u2019s study indicated that circCDR1as could regulate osteoblastic differentiation via the miR-7/GDF5/SMAD and p38 MAPK signaling pathways10. However, the complexities of circRNA expression as well as the extent of their regulatory functions during osteoclastogenesis have yet to be revealed. It has been established that the serine/threonine kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B, plays a crucial role in maintaining\nbone homeostasis12. AKT1 knockout mice showed an osteopenic phenotype due to dysfunction of osteoblasts and osteoclasts13. In detail, AKT1 is involved in osteoclast differentiation and survival as a part of the RANKL/NFKB axis14,15. Additionally, AKT has been shown to mediate the TGF\u03b21-dependent early phase of osteoblast differentiation16,17. Nevertheless, whether AKT is regulated by circular RNAs during osteoclast differentiation remains unknown. For the current study, we aimed to discover the roles played by circRNAs during osteoclastogenesis. Our screening strategy identified a circRNA derived from Fam190a pre-mRNA, which we named circFam190a. The expression of circFam190a is dramatically increased during osteoclast differentiation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that circFam190a promotes osteoclast formation and function. Mechanistically, we show that circFam90a enhances the binding of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, thereby activating the AKT1 signaling pathway. Overall, our findings establish circFam190a as a critical positive regulator of osteoclast differentiation and function.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Mouse studies All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC (ethical approval no. 2022-N(A)-078).

The quantity and quality of the RNA were evaluated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Subsequently, DNase I was used to degrade double-stranded and singlestranded DNA. The Ribo-of rRNA Depletion kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., N406) was used to remove ribosomal RNA, and RNase R (Epicentre Illumina) was utilized to eliminate linear RNA. Purification was carried out using Agencourt RNAClean XP magnetic beads (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The libraries were sequenced on the BGISEQ-500 (BGI Group). Raw reads were filtered to remove those with low quality, linker contamination and excessively high levels of unknown base N using SOAPnuke software v1.5.2 (https://github.com/BGI-flexlab/SOAPnuke). The remaining clean reads were aligned to the reference genome (Mus_musculus, UCSC_mm9; ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/). Circular RNAs were detected and identified using CIRI20 and Find_circ6,21. The results from those two software tools were integrated based on the circRNA start and stop positions (combining circRNAs with start and stop positions within the first and last 10 bases into one class). The expression of circRNAs was calculated based on the number of junction reads aligned to the two ends of the circRNA. As both CIRI (BWA\u2011MEM genome alignment algorithm) and Find_circ (Bowtie2 genome alignment algorithm) software were used in the profiling, the final numbers of junction reads were the mean of the two results. CircRNAs exhibiting fold changes \u22652.0 with P values \u22640.05 were classified as significantly differentially expressed circRNAs. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from all groups were analyzed by bidirectional clustering using the Pheatmap package (v1.0.12; rdocumentation.org/packages/pheatmap/versions/1.0.12) and are presented as heatmaps."

Real-time PCR analyses were performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa). Notably, divergent primers annealing at the distal ends of circRNA were used to determine the abundance of circRNA. Amplification was performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and Ct thresholds were determined using the software. All the primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. For RNase R treatment, 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was incubated for 15min at 37 \u00b0C with or without 3 U of RNase R (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI).

            "text": "Identification of circFam190a, a circular RNA implicated in osteoclastogenesis To investigate crucial circRNAs involved in osteoclastogenesis, we employed a sophisticated osteoclast in vitro culture system31,32. Samples were collected at different osteoclast differentiation stages: D0 (undifferentiated), D1 (early-stage OC differentiation), D3 (middle-stage OC differentiation), and D5 (late-stage OC differentiation) [Supplementary Fig. 1a]. Circular RNA sequencing analyses (circRNA-Seq) were performed to derive a list of expressed circRNAs [Fig. 1a, left]. Among a total of 40,178 identified circRNAs [Supplementary Fig. 1b], 1013 were annotated in circBase33 [Fig. 1a, upper right]. These annotated circRNAs were further screened, providing us with a list of 20 circRNAs referred to as \u201ccontinuously upregulated circRNAs during osteoclastogenesis\u201d [Fig. 1a, lower right, and Fig. 1b]. We next validated the expression of these 20 circRNAs [Supplementary Fig. 1c]. Consistent with the sequencing results, qPCR data indicated significant upregulation of all 20 circRNAs in mature osteoclasts [Fig. 1c]. Among them, circFam190a (mmu_circ_0001477), circAtrnl1 (mmu_circ_0000965), and circMkln1 (mmu_circ_0001459) exhibited the most significant elevation. Notably, only the depletion of circFam190a, and not circAtrnl1 or circMkln1, ameliorated osteoclast formation [Supplementary Fig. 1d\u2013f and Fig. 2A\u2013C]. Hence, circFam190a captured our attention. CircFam190a (mmu_circ_0001477) is generated from the Fam90a gene located on mouse chromosome (chr6). The annotation for circFam190a depicts 2 and 3 exons of Fam190a (total 1541 bp)33. We sought to verify that the form of circFam190a expressed by osteoblasts matches this report. First, sequencing confirmed that the head-to-tail splice junction was identical to the reported sequence [Fig. 1d]. Subsequently, the head-to-tail splicing of endogenous circFam190a was assessed using RT\u2012PCR with convergent and divergent primers, along with circMap3k5 as a control34. Consistent with the circular form, the divergent primers for circFam190a and circMap3k5, but not Gapdh, amplified a PCR product [Fig. 1e]. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of total RNA after RNase R treatment indicated that circFam190a and circMap3k5 were resistant, while Gapdh and Fam190a mRNA transcripts were degraded [Fig. 1f]. Treatment with actinomycin D suggested that circFam190a transcripts were more stable than Fam190a mRNA [Fig. 1g]. These findings established that circFam190a is a bona fide circRNA. Notably, the sequence of circFam190a in mice (mmu_circ_0001477) exhibits high homology with its human counterpart\n(hsa_circ_0127310) [Supplementary Fig. 1g]. Similar to mouse circFam190a, hsa_circ_0127310 (referred to as circFAM190A) is generated from the human FAM190A gene, located on human chr 433 [Supplementary Fig. 1h]. We also validated the expression of circFAM190A [Supplementary Fig. 1i\u2013k]. Interestingly, in mice with ovariectomy surgery, a condition characterized by hyperactive osteoclasts, circFam190a expression was significantly elevated [Fig. 1h]. Consistent with these results, the expression level of circFAM190A in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) patients was also significantly upregulated [Supplementary Fig. 1l]. Moreover, in vitro culture studies demonstrated a significant increase in circFam190a expression during Rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis [Fig. 1i]. Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro findings establish circFam190a as a bona fide circRNA that is upregulated during osteoclastogenesis, implying a potential correlation between elevated circFam190a/circFAM190A levels and excessive osteoclast activity.\nCircFam190a promotes osteoclast formation and function in vitro As shown, the knockdown of circFam190a resulted in a significant drop in the number of osteoclasts formed [Fig. 2A\u2013C]. Moreover, the depletion of circFam190a impaired osteoclast bone resorption function, as evidenced by the reduction in bone resorption area [Fig. 2D, E]. Consistently, gene expression analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of osteoclast-specific genes, including Nfatc1, Ctsk, C-fos, Rank, Trap, and Ctsk, upon blocking circFam190a [Fig. 2F]. These results indicate that the depletion of circFam190a inhibits osteoclast differentiation and function. Conversely, the overexpression of circFam190a enhanced osteoclast formation and function, as demonstrated by an increased osteoclast formation number, an expanded bone resorption area, and upregulation of osteoclast-related genes [Fig. 2G\u2013I and Supplementary Fig. 2]. Collectively, these data demonstrate that circFam190 acts as a positive regulator of osteoclast formation and function in vitro.\nKnockdown of circFam190a protects mice from pathological bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model To further validate the role of circFam190a in osteoclasts, we expanded our experiments to include in vivo animal studies. Successful construction of the OVX mouse model, an estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss model, was confirmed by the decreased uterus weight [Supplementary Fig. 3a], and the efficiency of circFam190a knockdown in mice was validated by qRT\u2012PCR [Fig. 3a]35,36. Microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) analysis revealed that the depletion of circFam190a in mice ameliorated OVX-induced bone loss, as supported by increased BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, Conn.D, and decreased Tb.Sp levels [Fig. 3b, c]. Consistently, bone histomorphometric analysis also showed increased BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Tb.N and decreased Tb.Sp in mice with circFam190a depletion [Fig. 3d, e]. Moreover, histomorphometric results demonstrated that the knockdown of circFam190a prevented the increase in osteoclast number, osteoclast surface and erosion surface induced\nFig. 2 CircFam190a promotes osteoclast formation and function in vitro.

This inhibitory effect was confirmed by the decreased serum CTX1 levels in mice with circFam190a deletion [Fig. 3h]. Interestingly, the knockdown of circFam190a did not affect bone formation, as evidenced by no significant differences in\nbone formation parameters (Ob.S/BS, N.Ob/BS, MAR and BFR/BS) and serum P1NP levels between the groups with or without circFam190a deletion [Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 3b\u2013d]. To further confirm this effect on bone formation, we also performed circFam190a knockdown during osteoblast differentiation in vitro\nExperimental & Molecular Medicine (2023) 55:2051 \u2013 2066\n[Supplementary Fig. 3e\u2013h]. As shown, no differences in staining or expression of bone formation-related genes were observed when circFam190a was inhibited, indicating no effect of circFam190a on bone formation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that in vivo knockdown of circFam190a inhibits hyperactive osteoclasts induced by OVX without affecting bone formation.\nFUS increases circFam190a production during osteoclastogenesis Based on the aforementioned results confirming the importance of circFam190a as a positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis, we aimed to identify the upstream regulatory factors responsible for circFam190a production. Recently, several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been reported to regulate circRNA biogenesis37,38. Considering the significant upregulation of circFam190a during osteoclast differentiation, we hypothesized that RBPs involved in circFam190a production would also increase following RANKL stimulation. Therefore, we screened the expression of 8 candidate circRNA biogenesis-associated RBPs (EIF4A1, EIF4A3, SF3A1, HNRNPL, FUS, DHX9, QKI and MBL) using transcriptome analysis of BMMs treated with M-CSF and RANKL compared to untreated BMMs (GSE176265)39. As shown in the volcano plot, only FUS showed a significant increase during osteoclastogenesis [Fig. 4a]. This upregulation of FUS during osteoclast differentiation was further confirmed by RT\u2012PCR data [Supplementary Fig. 4a]. Importantly, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays indicated that FUS could bind to pre-Fam190a mRNA but not circFam190a or Fam190a mRNA [Fig. 4b]. Moreover, knockdown of FUS resulted in a decrease in circFam190a levels, while ectopic expression of FUS increased circFam190a levels [Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4b]. These findings collectively indicate that the expression of circFam190a is driven by FUS.\nCircFam190a binds directly to HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1 We then studied how circFam190a exerts its effect on osteoclasts. Since circFam190a was predominantly cytoplasmic [Fig. 4d, e], we first examined whether circFam190a functions as a miRNA sponge. Argonaut 2 crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (AGO2 CLIP) was performed40 with an AGO2 RIP assay. However, the results showed that circFam190a did not bind to AGO2 [Supplementary Fig. 4c], ruling out the possibility that circFam190a functions as a miRNA sponge. To identify potential protein binding partners of circFam190a, we conducted RNA pulldown assays using biotinylated probes targeting the backspliced sequence of circFam190a [Fig. 4f]. Mass spectrometry analysis of the sense and antisense probes was performed following the analysis pipeline [Fig. 4g], identifying 3 candidate RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Subsequently,\nimmunoblot analysis of the pulldown eluate confirmed the presence of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2 in the antisense eluate, while they did not bind to the sense probe [Fig. 4h]. Interestingly, previous reports have suggested that HSP90\u03b2 can form a complex and interact with AKT141\u201345. Our RIP analysis further confirmed a strong interaction between circFam190a and AKT1 as well as HSP90\u03b2 [Supplementary Fig. 4d, e]. Consistently, RIP assays targeting endogenous AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2 reaffirmed their interaction with circFam190a [Fig. 4i, j]. Seeking to further verify the nature of the association between circFam190a, AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, we performed a two-step IP after transfecting FLAG-AKT1 and HA-HSP90\u03b2 into osteoclasts. In the first phase, anti-FLAG antibodies precipitated FLAG-AKT1 along with HA-HSP90\u03b2 and circFam190a from total protein extracts. Moreover, the secondary IP against HA-HSP90\u03b2 captured FLAG-AKT1 and CircFam190a [Fig. 4k]. These results indicate the formation of a ternary complex involving circFam190a, AKT1, and HSP90\u03b2. To further delineate the structural determinants of the interactions between circFam190a, AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, we performed deletion mapping by subdividing the functional domains of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2 [Supplementary Fig. 4f, g]46,47. RNA pulldown assays showed that removal of the kinase domain (KD) (aa150-408) of AKT1 abolished its association with circFam190a [Fig. 4l], while deletion of the middle domain (MD) (aa262-609) of HSP90\u03b2 diminished its interaction with circFam190a [Fig. 4m]. In summary, these results indicate that circFam190a, AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2 form an RNA\u2012protein trimer complex through the KD domain of AKT1 and the MD domain of HSP90\u03b2.\nCircFam190a protects AKT1 from proteasome-mediated degradation Next, we sought to determine the effects of circFam190a on AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2. Knockdown of circFam190a led to a significant reduction in AKT1 protein levels without affecting HSP90\u03b2 [Fig. 5a]. Conversely, overexpression of circFam190a upregulated AKT1 protein expression [Supplementary Fig. 5a]. Additionally, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized AKT1 levels following circFam190a silencing or overexpression, indicating that circFam190a influences AKT1 protein stability [Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 5a]. Consistently, circFam190a knockdown decreased the half-life of AKT1, as observed in cycloheximide chase assays, while HSP90\u03b2 levels remained unaffected [Fig. 5c]. Additionally, circFam190a knockdown increased the polyubiquitination of AKT1 [Fig. 5d], suggesting that circFam190a prevents the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of AKT1 without affecting HSP90\u03b2. It has been reported that HSP90\u03b2 can form a complex with AKT1 and protect AKT1 from proteasome-mediated degradation48.\nFig. 3 Knockdown of circFam190a protects mice from pathological bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. a Relative circFam190a RNA levels in BMMs collected from the indicated mice.

The green line indicates the first injection of calcein, and the red line indicates the second injection of Alizarin red.\nExperimental & Molecular Medicine (2023) 55:2051 \u2013 2066\nConsidering the formation of the circFam190a/HSP90\u03b2/AKT1 complex, we asked whether circFam190a could modulate the interactions between HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1, thereby influencing AKT1 stability. As shown, silencing circFam190a significantly reduced the binding between HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1 [Fig. 5e, f], while\noverexpression of circFam190a enhanced their binding [Fig. 5g, h]. As a complementary approach, we employed the mammalian two-hybrid system to further study the influence of circFam190 on AKT1-HSP90\u03b2 protein\u2012protein interactions in vivo. Bait (BD) and prey (AT) fusion vectors of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2 were\nExperimental & Molecular Medicine (2023) 55:2051 \u2013 2066\nconstructed, and the interactions were measured by reporter assays. The results showed that circFam190a silencing reduced the interaction between HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1 [Fig. 5i], while circFam190a overexpression enhanced their binding [Fig. 5j]. Collectively, these findings indicate that circFam190a promotes the binding of AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, thereby facilitating AKT1 stability and activity.\nCircFam190a promotes osteoclast formation in an AKT1dependent manner in vitro After confirming the effects of circFam190a on AKT1, we next asked whether circFam190a exerted its function on osteoclasts in an AKT1-dependent manner. mRNA sequencing analyses were performed on control and circFam190a-silenced osteoclast samples [Supplementary Fig. 6a, b]. Consistent with its role as a positive regulator of osteoclast differentiation, circFam190a knockdown led to a significant decrease in the expression of osteoclast differentiation-related genes [Fig. 6a, b]. Moreover, the overexpression of AKT1 successfully rescued the decreased osteoclast formation induced by circFam190a silencing [Fig. 6c\u2013f and Supplementary Fig. 6c]. To further confirm the involvement of AKT1 signaling, we conducted additional experiments. Treatment with MK-2206, an inhibitor of the AKT1 signaling pathway, or depletion of HSP90\u03b2 using siHSP90\u03b2, which is involved in stabilizing AKT1, both rescued the hyperactive osteoclast phenotype induced by circFam190a overexpression [Fig. 6g\u2013j and Supplementary Fig. 6d]. These findings collectively suggest that circFam190a promotes osteoclast formation in an AKT1-dependent manner in vitro. The upregulation of circFam190a enhances osteoclastogenesis through the activation of AKT1 signaling, and the inhibition of AKT1 signaling or disruption of the circFam190a-AKT1 interaction attenuates osteoclast formation.\nInhibition of AKT signaling rescues the osteoclast phenotype induced by circFam190a in vivo To further validate the role of AKT signaling in mediating the effects of circFam190a on osteoclasts in vivo, we used adenoassociated virus (AAV) to overexpress circFam190a in mice. Successful overexpression of circFam190a was validated in trabecular bone samples [Fig. 7a]. Since AAV9, when intravenously injected, can also transduce other tissues such as the liver, heart, and muscle49,50, the expression of circFam190a in these tissues was also examined [Supplementary Fig. 7a].\nOur findings in Fig. 3 showed that the depletion of circFam190a in vivo inhibited osteoclast bone resorption [Fig. 3]. Consistent with this finding, the overexpression of circFam190a in vivo induced hyperactive osteoclasts, as indicated by the significantly elevated OC number and surface [Fig. 7b, c], which led to a significant decline in bone volume [Fig. 7d\u2013g]. Importantly, treatment with MK-2206, an inhibitor of AKT signaling, successfully rescued the bone loss induced by circFam190a overexpression [Fig. 7d\u2013g]. This protective effect was attributed to the inhibition of osteoclast function, as evidenced by the significant decrease in osteoclast number and surface area following MK-2206 treatment [Fig. 7b, c]. Consistently, serum CTX1 levels were also decreased after MK-2206 treatment [Fig. 7h]. Bone formation parameters were also evaluated in these mice. The data showed no significant difference with or without circFam190a overexpression, indicating that circFam190a did not affect bone formation [Supplementary Fig. 7a\u2013d]. However, treatment with MK-2206 impaired bone formation, as indicated by the significant decrease in parameters such as Ob.S/BS, N.Ob/ BS, MAR, BFR/BS, and serum P1NP levels [Supplementary Fig. 7a\u2013d]. This inhibitory effect of MK-2206 on bone formation is reasonable considering that MK-2206 can also impair the AKT signaling pathway in osteoblasts. In summary, these results suggest that the overexpression of circFam190a induces hyperactive osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. This phenotype can be rescued by inhibiting AKT signaling with MK-2206, thereby protecting mice from circFam190a-induced bone loss."

            "text": "Although the physiological roles of osteoclasts are well described, the mechanisms of their differentiation and function remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we identified circFam190a as a critical positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis [Fig. 7i]. Specifically, we found that circFam190a, induced by FUS, binds directly to AKT1 and HSP90\u03b2, facilitating their association. This interaction protects AKT1 from proteasomal degradation, thereby activating AKT1 signaling and promoting osteoclast formation and function [Fig. 7i]. CircRNAs exert their functions through several well-established mechanisms, including the regulation of parental gene expression and splicing events, regulation of gene expression through miRNA sponging, translation into proteins, and interaction with\nFig. 4 CircFam190a is regulated by FUS and binds directly to HSP90\u03b2/AKT1. a Volcano plot showing differential gene expression in BMMs treated with RANKL for 24 h vs. untreated BMMs (controls).

Previous studies have reported that circ_0008542 promotes osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by acting as a miR-185-5p sponge53, and circCHEK1_246aa stimulates osteoclast differentiation by encoding the CHEK1 kinase catalytic center54. However, it remains unclear whether circRNAs can regulate osteoclasts via circRNA-protein interactions. Our findings demonstrate that circFam190a can interact with HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1, representing the first report of circRNAs functioning through circRNA-protein interactions in the regulation of\nosteoclastogenesis. This finding expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circRNAs and osteoclastogenesis. To unveil the role of circRNAs during osteoclastogenesis, we performed deep circRNA sequencing to identify the expression profiles of circRNAs at different stages of osteoclast differentiation (D0, before RANKL stimulation; D1, 1 day after RANKL stimulation; D3, 3 days after RANKL stimulation; D5, 5 days after RANKL stimulation). Interestingly, in addition to circFam190a, the\nExperimental & Molecular Medicine (2023) 55:2051 \u2013 2066\nexpression of many other circRNAs was also significantly altered during osteogenesis [Supplementary Fig. 1b]. These findings are consistent with previous sequencing reports by other researchers55\u201358, reinforcing the importance of circRNAs in osteoclast differentiation and providing potential targets for future studies on circRNAs during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoporosis, characterized by increased bone resorption without compensatory bone formation, is a major health concern due to its severity, chronicity, and progression59\u201363. Current antiresorptive agents for treating osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, are effective but far from ideal64,65. In our study, we show that depletion of circFam190a efficiently inhibits bone resorption and protects mice from OVX-induced osteoporosis [Figs. 2 and 3]. Intriguingly, neither up- nor downregulation of circFam190a affected bone formation [Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 3b\u2013h]. This differential effect of circFam190a on osteoclasts and osteoblasts can be attributed to the tissue- and stage-specific expression of circRNAs, which play various roles in different tissues37,52. Moreover, considering the high homology between mouse circFam190a and human circFAM190A [Supplementary Fig. 1g], as well as the significant elevation of circFAM190A in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients [Supplementary Fig. 1l], the unique characteristic of promoting bone resorption without affecting bone formation makes circFAM190A a promising target for treating osteoporosis. ASOs are short synthetic single-stranded DNA/RNA oligonucleotides that selectively bind target RNA and regulate RNA function66,67. LNA ASOs, the third generation of ASOs with improved bioavailability and higher target RNA specificity, have shown promising results in clinical trials for diseases such as hepatitis and dyslipidemia67,68. However, the use of LNA-ASOs for treating osteoporosis and their efficacy and safety in bone disease remain unclear. Herein, we successfully utilized LNA-ASOs to knock down circRNAs both in vivo and in vitro [Supplementary Fig. 1d and Figs. 2a and 3a]. Moreover, treatment with LNA-ASOs targeting circFam190a effectively prevented OVX-induced osteoporosis. These findings provide evidence that LNA-ASOs could be a potential therapeutic approach for bone disease, offering a new avenue for the treatment of osteoporosis. AKT1 has been well documented as a crucial regulator of osteoclast differentiation and survival13,16. Hsp90\u03b2, a ubiquitously and abundantly expressed molecular chaperone, is required for\nthe stability and functional maturation of numerous client proteins, including AKT69. The binding of HSP90 with AKT prevents proteasomal degradation of AKT and contributes to the functional stabilization of AKT signaling42,48. Consistent with previous reports, our experiments confirmed the interaction between Hsp90 and AKT1. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that circFam190a binds directly to HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1, forming a HSP90\u03b2-AKT1-circFam190a ternary complex [Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4]. Depletion of circFam190a significantly reduced the association between HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1, while overexpression of circFam190a enhanced their interaction [Fig. 5e\u2013j]. With the knockdown of circFam190a, AKT1 is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation [Fig. 5a\u2013d]. These findings highlight the unique role of circFam190a in enhancing the HSP90\u03b2/AKT1 complex, expanding our understanding of the molecular mechanisms between HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1. In subsequent studies, we further investigated whether circFam190a exerts its function on osteoclasts via the HSP90\u03b2-AKT1-circFam190a ternary complex. Modulating both HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1 abrogated the effect of circFam190a on osteoclasts, indicating that circFam190a regulates osteoclasts in an HSP90\u03b2- and AKT1-dependent manner [Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6]. Additionally, in vivo mouse experiments suggested that inhibiting AKT signaling with MK-2206 successfully rescued the bone resorption phenotype induced by circFam190a [Fig. 7]. These data confirm our hypothesis that circFam190a regulates osteoclast function by modulating AKT1. Interestingly, we found that although treatment with MK-2206, an AKT signaling inhibitor, largely reduced the excessive osteoclast activity and the osteoporotic phenotype caused by the overexpression of circFam190a, it also led to a decline in bone formation [Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 7]. Given that MK-2206 restrains AKT signaling in osteoblasts as well, this inhibitory effect on bone formation is reasonable. Nevertheless, this inhibitory effect on bone formation was overshadowed by MK-2206\u2019s significant reduction in excessive osteoclast bone resorption, resulting in an overall increase in bone mass in mice. Of note, when knocking down circFam190a during osteoclastogenesis, a decrease in RANK mRNA expression was also observed [Fig. 2f]. RANK is a crucial cell surface receptor for osteoclastogenesis that initiates RANKL signaling70. Hence, the RNAK/RANKL signaling pathway might also be involved in the regulatory effects of circFam190a on\nFig. 5 CircFam190a Protects AKT1 from Proteasome-Mediated Degradation. a BMMs transfected with control (ASO-ctrl) or circFam190a knockdown (ASO-1, ASO-2, ASO-3) LNA-ASOs were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL for 3 days.

This result will be further verified in our subsequent studies. In conclusion, we report that circFam190a, a circular RNA that binds directly to HSP90\u03b2 and AKT1, is an important positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis. Targeting circFam190a could efficiently ameliorate OVX-induced osteoporosis. These findings contribute to our understanding of circular RNAs and bone\nmetabolism and provide potential therapeutic targets for treating osteoporosis."
