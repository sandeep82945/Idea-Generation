    "abstractText": "Ultraviolet (UV) is widely used in daily life as well as in industrial manufacturing. In this study, a single-step postprocess to improve the sensitivity of a graphene-based UV sensor is studied. We leverage the advantage of electric-field-assisted on-demand printing, which is simply applicable for mounting functional polymers onto various structures. Here, the facile printing process creates optical plano-convex geometry by accelerating and colliding a highly viscous droplet on a micropatterned graphene channel. The printed transparent lens refracts UV rays. The concentrated UV photon energy from a wide field of view enhances the photodesorption of electron-hole pairs between the lens and the graphene sensor channel, which is coupled with a large change in resistance. As a result, the one-step post-treatment has about a 4\u00d7 higher sensitivity compared to bare sensors without the lenses. We verify the applicability of printing and the boosting mechanism by variation of lens dimensions, a series of UV exposure tests, and optical simulation. Moreover, the method contributes to UV sensing in acute angle or low irradiation. In addition, the catalytic lens provides about a 9\u00d7 higher recovery rate, where water molecules inside the PEI lens deliver fast reassembly of the electron-hole pairs. The presented method with an ultimately simple fabrication step is expected to be applied to academic research and prototyping, including optoelectronic sensors, energy devices, and advanced manufacturing processes.",

            "text": "Ultraviolet (UV) is widely used in daily life as well as in industrial manufacturing, such as in virus sterilization, insect removal, aesthetic curing, lighting for biotherapy, and bonding for structural assembly. However, excessive use of UV can cause serious damage to integrated devices and even to users. Hence, precise measurement is greatly important to properly exploit the advantages of UV [1\u20133]. Among measurement methods, the use of graphene (GP) for UV sensing has received great attention for its lightweight, superior electrical and mechanical properties [4\u20136], chemo-functionality [7,8], and quick opto-response [9,10]. To overcome the sensor\u2019s aboriginal capabilities, various techniques to improve sensitivity have recently been suggested. First, utilizing nanostructures for modulation of response was reported, but the methods involve time-consuming fabrication processes, expensive facilities, or are infeasible for microscale devices [11\u201313]. To avoid complicated structures, a surface modification of graphene using specialized functional molecules was suggested. However, such a method inevitably involves expensive materials and treatment processes [14]. Next, introducing high humidity in the sensing sequence can be one of the alternates for enhancing sensitivity as it is simple, cost-efficient, and applicable to microscale devices. However, exposure to graphene in a highly humid atmosphere for a long time is known to degrade photosensitivity [15]. Furthermore, it was reported that\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3204. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14153204 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3204 2 of 15\nthe generation of a graphene oxide layer underwater improves the sensitivity, yet in turn, the use underwater sacrifices the mobility of compact electronic devices [16]. Likewise, Li [17], Hernaez [18], and Sanctis et al. [19] presented comparative performance tables in reviews of graphene-based photodetectors, which supported insightful background studies. As emerging materials and manufacturing technologies such as graphene synthesis and printings have been developed, there is room for improving the performance of the sensor. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new strategy for UV sensing that promises superior sensitivity by combining low-cost materials, simple preparation, easy fabrication, and harmonization with the graphene. The plano-convex lens has been utilized in a wide range of applications by using its well-established optical theory, including as a solar concentrator in photovoltaic systems [20], as optical sensors in automotive parts [21], in laser exposure systems [22], and as an artificial eye in biomimicry robotics [23]. The simplification of the fabrication process is important from a productive point of view. To date, a variety of fabrication processes have been suggested to create plano-convex lenses, including inkjet printing [24], molding [25], and reflowing [26]. However, they possess complicated steps such as the need for a customized needle and actuator [24], inevitable part replacement [25], and the difficulty of dimension control of the individual products [26]. Besides, dimensional controllability of the lens is the foremost interest. In particular, adjusting the focal point in the process is a fastidious task. Even though several techniques, such as molding and etching [27], have been demonstrated, these techniques are not capable of obtaining a smooth curved surface. Similar to our method, one method used the electrowetting of tuned contact angles of the individual polymeric lens by employing an external electric field (EF) after shooting the droplet [28]. However, the process has a critical issue where the strong EF can damage the graphene layer. Since surface treatments also have widely been studied [29,30], the processes are limited in the selection of substrate and are not appropriate for large manufacturing as each lens needs to be treated separately. As shown in Figure 1, here, we employ a simple printing method to create a functional lens on a UV sensor, leveraging the advantage of the EF. In order to use printing as the core method of UV sensor manufacturing, we looked at the types of printing categorized into three major technologies, i.e., stereolithography (focused laser curing), deposition printing (extrusion) [31], and EF-assisted printing [32]. In stereolithography, layered base molds are formed by photopolymerization. The resin stored in the tank selectively is exposed to light. Since the photopolymerized product is submerged in the resin, this method allows lower design freedom than constrained surface printings for the lens mounting [33]. Moreover, the photopolymers and the tools used in stereolithography typically are expensive, thus it is not a cost-effective method compared to deposition printing [34]. On the other hand, deposition printing is a facile process that uses thermoplastic filaments or photopolymers. Recently, fused deposition printing has become the most common technique for producing thermoplastic filaments. Easily accessible materials, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) [35], polylactic acid (PLA), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), can be extruded rapidly. However, since its ability to fuse with adjacent layers is low, fused deposition is inappropriate for use with sensor devices that require controllable high-gloss curvature [36]. The EF-assisted printing can shoot a highly viscous polymer droplet and create the optical plano-convex lens on a sensor surface. The fundamental idea behind this technique is based on near-field electrospinning (NFES) [37], a nanofiber-producing method utilizing electrohydrodynamic behavior in which the polymeric jet flow rate is closed related to the amplitude of the EF. In our prior work, electrospinning was initiated when the EF between the needle tip and the collector exceeded the threshold level, leading to the electrostatic force acting between the ion inside the polymer solution and the conductive collector being stronger than the surface tension of the polymer [38]. However, when an excessive level of the EF was formed between the tip and the collector, the unbalanced EF created a discontinuous polymer jet rather than forming a continuous fiber [37]. When the pulling force by both the electrostatic force and gravity on the droplet exceeded the capillary force,\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3204 3 of 15\nthe droplet was ejected and fell toward the device [39,40]. In a recent publication [32], we presented the printing system for a macroscale lens array which was integrated into a microscope as a teleconverter, into fluidic tubing as a magnifier, into a laser exposing as a concentrator, and into an LED bulb encapsulating as a light diffuser. By leveraging this interesting phenomenon, we can apply this principle to the formation of a plano-convex lens by accelerating and colliding droplets onto the graphene-based UV sensor channel.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16\nrather than forming a continuous fiber [37].

Accordingly, optically concentrated UV rays that come through the refractive polymeric convex lens provide enhanced photon energy onto the graphene sensor channel. The UV sensing response is outstandingly boosted compared to graphene sensors without lenses, which is coupled with the change in resistance (\u2206R) and which is proportional to UV photons. This result provides enhancement of small form-factor optoelectronic sensors through single-step postprocessing. It is envisioned that the method can be leveraged for applications in academic research and prototyping, including optoelectronic sensors, energy devices, and advanced manufacturing processes."

Graphene-PMMA Transferring\nThe synthesized graphene sheet was then transferred onto the device surface by a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) transfer technique [44]. The PMMA was spin-coated on the synthesized graphene in the copper film. The baked graphene-PMMA-Cu sheet was floated on a 2% ammonium persulfate solution to etch the Cu layer. After 6 h, the graphene-PMMA sheet was scooped up and transferred onto the device. The graphenePMMA sheet was naturally dried at room temperature for 24 h. Then, the PMMA layer on the top surface was removed by putting it in acetone for 6 h. The subset SEM image shows that the graphene sheet, as a photoabsorber, was successfully mounted on the device. Conductive electrodes and contact pads were patterned using UV photolithography and Cr/Au sputtering on the SiO2-deposited wafer.\n2.4.3. Graphene Channel via Near-Field Electrospinning\nFigure 3b follows a facile patterning of the graphene channel using a fiber etch-block. We used the printing system in NFES mode to deposit microfibers by setting the process parameters to 0.8 kV of the applied voltage and 1.0 mm of the distance between needle and substrate. To deposit the straight-line fiber, the jet impact speed and the collector speed should be matched [46]. We used an image processing method to account for the jet impact speed [37], then the collector speed was equalized to the estimated jet impact speed. Since an ultrahigh molecular weight of PEO is used as a rich crystalline polymer solution for the NFES, the deposited fiber (width of 80\u2013100 \u00b5m) served as a barricade mask that endures the oxygen plasma while etching the graphene. As a result, only the protected region covered by the spun fiber remained as a graphene photosensor channel [43,47], whereas the uncovered graphene was fully eliminated [48].\n2.4.4. Electric-Field-Assisted Lens Printing\nFigure 3c and the following sections provide the details of the droplet printing highlighted in this paper. At the beginning of the droplet printing process, the micropump pushes out the polymer solution through the needle, forming a droplet via the balance between the capillary force and the gravitational force. Once the desired droplet size is formed at the end of the needle, the micropump is turned off and the EF is generated by applying an electrical potential difference between the needle and the silicon wafer. The silicon wafer and the metal needle tip are connected to a high voltage supply to provide an electric potential to generate the EF (EF = applied voltage/distance between the needle and substrate). The programmable XYZ stage is used to locate the position of the droplets and to adjust the tip-to-collector distance. It was reported that electric discharge occurs when a high EF is applied with a short tip-to-collector distance [46]. However, in our design, the SiO2 is chosen for the dielectric surface layer of the sensor device as SiO2 not only allows the deposition of plano-convex lenses owing to its hydrophobicity, but also prevents the electrical discharge in the EF-assisted printing process. Here, PEI hydrogel was chosen as the key material of the plano-convex microlenses. The PEI solution has an appropriate high viscosity (18\u201340 Pa s) to form a low-aspect ratio semi-ellipse convex lens. Additionally, the PEI solution has advantageous optical transmittance (above 90%) and a refractive index of 1.45 in a wide range of wavelengths, which are crucial factors in determining optical performance. The PEI lenses with the diameter of the submillimeter are fabricated by use of a microneedle (32 gauge, 235 \u00b5m of outer diameter, 108 \u00b5m of inner diameter). With precise control, the printing system deposits the microlens on the graphene channel. The digital optical photometer and probe support controlling the UV irradiance, and the I-V curve is measured in real time.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3204 7 of 15\n2.4.5. Controlling Curvature of Lenses\nIn this work, we demonstrate the consistency of the droplet size by controlling the flow with the EF and vision monitoring. The dimensions of the lenses vary the optical refraction, which affects the boosting effect of the UV sensor. The ability to precisely control the lens dimensions expands the stable manufacturability and selectivity of the sensor\u2019s measuring range. According to a relationship between the f-number and aperture, focal point = f-number \u00d7 aperture, where the focal point is related to the diameter of the lens, which is controlled via corresponding droplet volume and EF [32]. The radius of the curvature of the lens significantly depends on the kinetic energy of the droplet and liquid\u2013surface interaction upon collision on the substrate [49]. Hence, the radius of curvature of the droplet can be effectively adjusted by controlling the applied voltage. Therefore, a higher EF leads to more kinetic energy of the droplet in the fixed distance between the needle and the target surface, resulting in a stronger collision and spreading of the droplet. We fixed the distance between the needle and substrate distance to be 3 mm while the applied voltage was adjusted between 1.5 and 3.5 kilovolts (kV) to create the various curvatures of the lenses."

Herein, we highlight the effect of Vin on the dimensions of the lenses, but foremost, we confirmed that the diameters do not change (\u2206D D0\u22121) after the formation of the hydrophilic lenses on the hydrophobic SiO2. Additionally, the D (aperture) of the lens is secured during the printing process. Upon completion of solidification, the lens did not experience noticeable deformation as shown in Figure 5e. However, the D is enlarged and deformed if the sensor is not horizontally positioned before curing. In Figure 5f, to verify the optical functionality through the imaging lens mode, the deposited lens with the film is placed on a microruler that has black grid lines with an interval of 100 \u00b5m. As shown with the arrow, the fabricated PEI droplet magnifies the grid lines, verifying that it utilizes a refractive optical lens. The overall dimensional quantification shown in Figure 5g\u2013i presents how Vin can effectively modulate the dimension of the lenses, including the D, lens center thickness, and Rc, which affects the focusing of the UV ray. Figure 5g presents the dimensional variation of D and Rc as a function of Vin, in which the higher Vin produces the larger D and Rc. Figure 5h shows the modification of thickness of the lens center as a function of Vin, exhibiting that the higher Vin leads to the smaller thickness of the lens center. This consistently supports the tendency of D and Rc increasing as EF increases. The results also confirm that the spreading of droplets is primarily determined by EF-assisted kinetic energy [49]. Thus, controlling Vin in the printing process can vary the kinetic energy of the droplet, which effectively changes the dimensions of the lenses. Figure 5i shows the volume and change of the lateral surface area as a function of Vin, whereas volume is calculated. The Rc and thickness of the lens center reveal that as Vin increases, the volume of the lenses shows negligible changes (<3.7%) because the droplet size is maintained through droplet printing, which is monitored through vision control in real time. Although the microcontroller can maintain the size of droplets, the volume of the printed droplet is slightly increased due to the inevitable pulling of the viscoelastic polymer ejected from the pipeline of the needle. Next, the plot shows that the larger the Vin, the larger the lateral surface area."

            "text": "An optical principle to largely boost the UV sensitivity via the Vin is clarified in this section. The greater concentrated UV irradiance caused by the geometrical refraction of the lens gives the graphene sensor a higher sensing resolution. In general, a greater lateral surface area (wide aperture) absorbs and delivers more optical rays. Here, however, we provide a study of how the smaller lateral surface area aims for greater boosting. Figure 6a presents the relationship between the incident angle (\u03b81), refraction angle (\u03b82), refraction surfaces (S1), reflection surface (S2), and refractive index of mediums, according to Snell\u2019s law (n1 sin\u03b81 = n2 sin\u03b82). A smaller Rc (left lens) leads to the larger difference between \u03b81 and \u03b82, resulting in the shorter focal point, in which the concentrated UV irradiance transmitted onto the sensing surface (S2) is greatly enhanced. On the other hand, when the same incident rays having the same \u03b81 pass through the thin droplet, the refraction enlarges the focal point, reducing the UV irradiance on the S2. This can demonstrate the relationship between material properties and sensing enhancement. A dome-shaped lens was printed using the property that the hydrophilic PEI solution does not spread on the sensor surface [41]. Conversely, if a hydrophobic solution is used, not only is it difficult to form a lens, but it also spreads widely and has the thin thickness of the lens, which reduces the optical focusing ability. In general, if the incident rays are propagated from a large angle as shown in Figure 6b, the S2 inevitably reflects rays due to its glossy surface. It was reported that the graphene-mounted SiO2 sensor reflects optical rays as a reflection surface, in which the amount of irradiance decreases [53].\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3204 10 of 15Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16\nFigure 6.

An exposure system includes a microscope, tungsten probes, and a Z-axis stage for adjusting the strength of the UV exposure. The irradiance, the intensity of incident UV reaching the sensor surface, is directly measured using the photometer. The \u2206R is measured by a digital multimeter. Sensitivity, the ability to sense, is provided by the percentile resistance change (\u2206R R0\u22121). The UV irradiances of 3, 3.8, 5.4, and 7.8 mW cm\u22122 are set by adjusting the distance between the UV exposure module and the sensor surface. To fully demonstrate the feasibility and the functionality of the proposed method, we tested two cases of sensors: i. a nonfunctionalized graphene sensor without a lens (p-type, before droplet print), and ii. An enhanced sensor with a droplet (n-type, after droplet print). In this work, PEI-induced doping converts the graphene phase into an n-type [11], increasing the Fermi level higher than the Dirac point. The H2O molecules (50% in PEI solution) act as electron acceptors, thus the R of the graphene increases to the initial mode. Then, R decreases by photodesorption upon the UV exposure mode. Since the incident UV rays can penetrate the droplet and be refracted to the focal point, the concentrated UV provides intense photonic energy to the graphene, resulting in a significant increase in photodesorption. Figure 8b presents the measurement result of the photodesorption for each case at varying incident irradiances, in which sensors comparatively prove the effectiveness of optical refraction. The blue-marked box plot on top indicates that the nonfunctionalized pure sensor (type i, before droplet print) has low sensitivity and a nonmeasurable \u2206R in the low UV irradiance of about 3 mW/cm2. On the other hand, the orange-marked graphene with a lens (type ii, after droplet print) has boosted \u2206R. This implies that the droplet focuses the UV rays and concentrates photon energy, effectively enhancing photodesorption. The lens also magnifies \u2206R in the low irradiance, which means that the suggested method practically utilizes a wide range of UV irradiance, such as a very low UV exposure environment. Furthermore, rich H2O molecules in the droplet promote the readsorption of the initial resistance when the UV is off. As a result, the printed PEI lens contributes to the excitation and assembly of electron-hole pairs more apparently, in which the sensor performs boosting and recovery in \u00b1 \u2206R. Figure 8c presents the continuous measurement of the sensing (UVon mode) and recovery (UV-off mode) of the graphene-based UV photosensor with a lens and without a lens for 250 s. UV irradiance of 7.8 mW cm\u22122 is exposed for 80 s, and then the exposure is turned off to validate the recovery of the sensors. The sensitivity improvement is noticeable at the early stage of each mode. The graphene with the lens exhibits an improved sensing rate ((\u2206R/R0) \u00d7 10\u22123/s) by about 410% at 0\u201320 s and by 220% at 0\u201380 s in comparison to the graphene without the lens. Even if the incident irradiance is 5.4 mW, the sensing rate is 250% larger than the sensing without the lens. In addition, it was observed that the recovery rate of the graphene with a lens has an effective recovery rate compared to the graphene without the lens by about 890% at 80\u2013100 s and 390% at 80\u2013250 s after the UV irradiance of 7.8 mW cm\u22122 is exposed. The graphene with the lens still proves it has a fast recovery rate after the exposure to UV irradiance of 5.4 mW cm\u22122 compared to the one without the lens under the exposure to UV irradiance of 7.8 mW cm\u22122. These results conclude that the existence of a lens apparently boosts the sensitivity and recovery rate of the graphene-based UV photosensor.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3204 12 of 15 Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\nFurthermore, rich H2O molecules in the droplet promote the readsorption of the initial resistance when the UV is off.

In accordance with the simulation result in Section 3.3, the droplet with the smaller Rc printed at 1.5 kV (orange) exhibits a higher \u2206R at every UV incident irradiance level compared to the one with the larger Rc printed at 3.5 kV (blue). Therefore, the results satisfy the theoretical strategy and simulation that printing with a low Vin is beneficial for promoting photodesorption. In addition, Figure 9b shows the sensing with UV incidence at 30 degrees relative to the vertical axis. This measurement provides an additional advantage to the 3D convex lens that can boost photosensing where UV propagates from various angles. In Section 3.3, we noted that if the incident rays have a large-angle \u03b82, the S2 can reflect rays [53], diminishing the irradiance and the sensing response. Therefore, overcoming the reflection contributes to improving higher \u2206R. For the test, the coordination of printing is shifted correctly according to the ray alignment, as shown in the subset image. The result shows that the lens improves sensitivity by about 450%.
