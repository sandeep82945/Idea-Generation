 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the specific compounds and mechanisms responsible for the potent antioxidant activity of Gerês propolis extracts. Isolate and identify the key antioxidant constituents through methods like HPLC and test their individual radical scavenging capacities. 

2. Further explore the antimicrobial effects of Gerês propolis, particularly against Bacillus species. Determine the antibacterial mechanisms of action and identify the bioactive compounds involved. Test combinations with antibiotics for synergistic effects.

3. Conduct in vivo studies on the anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of Gerês propolis hinted at in the paper. Assess bioavailability and efficacy in animal models of inflammation and cancer. 

4. Analyze the effects of different extraction methods on the chemical composition and bioactivity of Gerês propolis. Compare ethanol, water, ethyl acetate, etc. extracts to optimize extraction.

5. Investigate the potential clinical applications and formulation of Gerês propolis as a therapeutic agent. Conduct human trials on its antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory effects. Develop pharmaceutical formulations to enhance delivery.
