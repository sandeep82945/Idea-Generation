 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop better NLP methods for the proposed tasks like review-paper section correspondence, aspect category detection, review statement purpose detection etc. The paper provides baseline results, but there is scope for improvement using more advanced NLP techniques.

2. Expand the dataset to other STEM fields beyond just machine learning to see if the findings generalize. The paper currently only looks at ICLR peer reviews, but reviewing practices may differ in other domains. 

3. Build models to automatically evaluate the quality of peer reviews based on the analysis. This could help editors assess reviews and potentially provide feedback to reviewers.

4. Study the connection between peer review text features and eventual paper acceptance/rejection decisions. This could shed light on what aspects are most influential in decision making.

5. Develop an AI system to assist editors and reviewers, by summarizing reviews, highlighting significant comments, and even suggesting reviews. This could make the peer review process more efficient.
