    "abstractText": "Topically applied compounds containing camphor and menthol have been used to alleviate pain, cold symptoms, and pruritus, historically predominantly in East Asia. Being not studied well, they are less recognized in Western medicine. Given the commonality of pain, pruritus, and cold symptoms in addition to the growing need for non-opioid treatment options, the authors investigated clinical applications of such compounds for their over-counter usage. The purpose was to analyze current clinical research and applications regarding the use of these topical agents. This study involved a bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed articles, published in English and indexed in PubMed from 2010 to 2022, pertaining to camphorand menthol-containing compounds. There were 103 results, of which 15 (14.6%) articles were related to the treatment of disorders related to health, such as upper respiratory infection, pain, and pruritus. Excluded were \u201cnon-research\u201d articles (e.g., letters to the editor), articles that do not involve human subjects, reports of improper application or misuse (e.g., ingestion), and articles pertaining to intraoral, intranasal, and ophthalmic agents. Of these articles, the originating journals, respective journal impact factor scores, publication years, study designs, and study topics were identified. Underlying trends and themes regarding clinically relevant research on these compounds were subsequently discerned. Based on this analysis, topical agents containing camphor and menthol are potentially effective at treating pain, upper respiratory infection symptoms, and pruritus in addition to potentially functioning as an antimicrobial. However, with a limited number of studies addressing these compounds' uses in each application, no definitive recommendation can be made regarding their use. Given the promising results of earlier studies, the authors recommend that more primary research, particularly randomized, double-blind controlled studies, be done regarding clinical applications of these substances.

            "text": "Back pain, arthritis, upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, and pruritus are among the most common complaints in developed countries [1]. Currently, there are limited safe and effective treatments for pain, URI symptoms, and chronic pruritus [2-4]. Consequently, research on alternative therapies and management strategies for these issues needs to be conducted.\nTopical agents have emerged as promising alternative or complementary modalities of treatment for pain, pruritus, and URI symptoms over time [3,5,6]. Often lacking significant systemic effects, topical medications tend to be safer, have less addictive potential, and are more accessible than oral and parenteral therapies [7]. As such, topical medications are an appealing treatment option and have become a topic of research regarding the management of pain, pruritus, and URI symptoms.\nThe authors considered existing remedies that may not be as well recognized as the other topical agents. Camphor- and menthol-containing agents, in particular, stood out. From a pain standpoint, camphor activates TRPV1 and inhibits TRPA1, on which menthol also has a bimodal action, resulting in an analgesic effect [8]. For URI symptoms, camphor and menthol both activate inhibiting transient receptor potential (TRP) channel M8, which is believed to inhibit respiratory reflexes to alleviate irritation and cough. These compounds have deep roots in Eastern medicine and have historically been used for alleviating pain, cold symptoms, and pruritus in various cultures. However, as these compounds are not as well recognized in Western medicine, clinical research is sparse.\nHow to cite this article Hoang D, Wong A, Olympia R P (July 05, 2023) Looking Back to Move Forward: The Current State of Research on the Clinical Applications of Camphor- and Menthol-Containing Agents. Cureus 15(7): e41426. DOI 10.7759/cureus.41426\nThe bibliometric study seeks to evaluate the current research that exists on the clinical applicability of compounds containing camphor and menthol and make recommendations for future research regarding their use. This involved a comprehensive review of articles found in PubMed since 2010. McGranahan & Parker noted efforts to address the opioid epidemic starting in the early 2010s with opioid drug reformulation and declining prescription rates; as such, 2010 was chosen as the start date of the analysis [9]. The authors aimed to present general conclusions about these substances' application in clinical medicine and provide direction for future research regarding these topical compounds. This article was previously presented as a poster at PAINWeek 2022 on September 8, 2022."

Lactobacillus casei has lower-quality evidence in older adults. In children, acetylcysteine, honey, nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils are considered safe and effective.\nTopical therapies for knee osteoarthritis\nRodriguezMerchan, 2018 [11]\nCurrent management guidelines recommend topical NSAIDs for knee osteoarthritis (OA) treatment, as they have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared with oral NSAIDs. The role of other topical therapies (e.g., menthol and creams containing glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and camphor) needs further research but has shown a low level of evidence for pain mitigation.\nUse of camphor and essential oil balms for infants in Cambodia\nBazzano et al., 2017 [12] Topical products, containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus, were commonly used in infants in Cambodia. Parents and caregivers should be educated on the risks of camphor- and menthol-containing products.\nClinical efficacy of polyherbal formulation Eezpain spray for muscular pain relief\nNawaz et al., 2015 [13] Eezpain spray (consisting of gaultheria oil, eucalyptus oil, turpentine oil, clove oil, menthol, and camphor) has shown efficacy in mild to moderate cases on applying on affected parts.\nEvaluation of treatments Danial et al., The most effective treatments in treating pruritus in epidermolysis bullosa included creams, topical prescription corticosteroids, oils, oral hydroxyzine, topical diphenhydramine, and\n2023 Hoang et al.

Proposed analgesic implementation included knee osteoarthritis [11], myalgias, neuralgias [13], and venipuncture pain [18],\n2023 Hoang et al. Cureus 15(7): e41426. DOI 10.7759/cureus.41426 5 of 7\nthrough possible improvements in blood circulation [15] among other mechanisms. These agents have shown potential in improving pruritus [10,14] through potential anti-inflammatory effects [16], but contradictory evidence does exist [21].\nOther benefits of these agents include relieving nasal congestion and reducing nighttime cough frequency and severity, improving sleep for both the child and parents [3,17,20]. Additionally, antimicrobial properties were observed against onychomycosis [22]. Several of the excluded, \u201cnon-clinically relevant\u201d articles (i.e., not involving human subjects) discussed other possible antimicrobial effects of menthol and camphor; however, they were not included in this analysis as they failed to meet criteria.\nPotential side effects of these topical agents include contact dermatitis [23], allergic reactions, and camphor/menthol poisoning due to accidental ingestion, which could cause symptoms such as seizures [12,19]. That said, camphor, not menthol, is responsible for convulsions, so each compound's side effect profile should be considered separately [19]."

            "text": "Topical compounds containing camphor and menthol have traditionally been used to alleviate pain, cold symptoms, and pruritus, especially in East Asian cultures. As these symptoms are fairly common, this bibliometric analysis aimed to assess the presence of peer-reviewed publications to better guide evidencebased, clinical applications of these agents. As PubMed was the only search engine utilized, relevant literature from other platforms may have been excluded from the analysis. Similarly, while the authors tried to include all research pertaining to topical camphor- and menthol-containing agents with the nonspecific search terms, research articles referencing brand names of different formulations of these compounds, such as Tiger Balm, Eagle Balm, Vicks VapoRub, and Bengay, may have been excluded.\nBased on existing literature, compounds containing camphor and menthol demonstrate potential in relieving pain, alleviating cold symptoms, lessening pruritus, and even functioning as an antimicrobial. Given the limited number of studies, however, a definitive recommendation cannot be made regarding their use. The authors recommend additional randomized, double-blind controlled studies be done to address the clinical application of these substances, particularly in the contexts of relieving localized pain, localized pruritus, and URI symptoms.\nAdditional Information"
