    "abstractText": "In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, stripe order refers broadly to a coupled spin and charge modulation with a commensuration of eight and four lattice units, respectively. How this stripe order evolves across optimal doping remains a controversial question. Here we present a systematic resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of weak charge correlations in La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 and La1.8\u2212xEu0.2SrxCuO4. Ultra high energy resolution experiments demonstrate the importance of the separation of inelastic and elastic scattering processes. Long-range temperature-dependent stripe order is only found below optimal doping. At higher doping, short-range temperature-independent correlations are present up to the highest doping measured. This transformation is distinct from and preempts the pseudogap critical doping. We argue that the doping and temperatureindependent short-range correlations originate from unresolved electron\u2013phonon coupling that broadly peaks at the stripe ordering vector. In La2\u2212xSrxCuO4, long-range static stripe order vanishes around optimal doping and we discuss both quantum critical and crossover scenarios.",

Chang 1\u2709\nIn high-temperature cuprate superconductors, stripe order refers broadly to a coupled spin and charge modulation with a commensuration of eight and four lattice units, respectively. How this stripe order evolves across optimal doping remains a controversial question. Here we present a systematic resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of weak charge correlations in La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 and La1.8\u2212xEu0.2SrxCuO4. Ultra high energy resolution experiments demonstrate the importance of the separation of inelastic and elastic scattering processes. Long-range temperature-dependent stripe order is only found below optimal doping. At higher doping, short-range temperature-independent correlations are present up to the highest doping measured. This transformation is distinct from and preempts the pseudogap critical doping. We argue that the doping and temperatureindependent short-range correlations originate from unresolved electron\u2013phonon coupling that broadly peaks at the stripe ordering vector. In La2\u2212xSrxCuO4, long-range static stripe order vanishes around optimal doping and we discuss both quantum critical and crossover scenarios.\nnpj Quantum Materials (2023) 8:7 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41535-023-00539-w"

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Charge order is now established in virtually all known hole underdoped cuprates1\u201311, and hence is a universal property on equal footing with the pseudogap12 and superconductivity. The evolution of charge order and the pseudogap beyond optimal doping has been challenging to establish. The pseudogap may emerge through a quantum critical transition13\u201317, a cross-over phenomenon18 or as a precursor to a symmetry breaking. It has also been difficult to establish a general trend as to how charge order evolves into the overdoped limit. In (Bi,Pb)2.12Sr1.88CuO6+x (Bi2201), a long-range charge ordering extending all the way to room temperature is reported in the overdoped regime beyond the doping extent of the pseudogap phase19. In the La-based cuprates, spin and charge stripe order around 1/8-doping are coupled6,7,20\u201322. Doping evolution of stripe order thus involves both spin and charge unless a doping-induced decoupling takes place. A recent study on La1.6\u2212xNd0.4SrxCuO4 suggests that spinstripe order persists across the entire superconducting dome23 and long-range charge ordering outside the pseudogap phase has been reported in La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 (LSCO)24,25. A resonant x-ray scattering study, by contrast, suggests that short-range charge correlations only exist inside the pseudogap phase26. Thus, contradicting observations on the charge order leave the questions of the coupling between spin and charge as well as a possible connection between charge order and the pseudogap unsolved. Recently, Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) has been used to detect weak charge correlations by separating elastic from inelastic contributions27. In this fashion, charge correlations in La1.8\u2212xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (LESCO) x= 0.12 were probed above the\nresonant elastic x-ray scattering onset temperature11,28,29. Here we use the RIXS sensitivity to trace charge correlations as a function of doping and temperature in LSCO and LESCO. Our main finding is the presence of long-range charge order for x < 0.15 and shortrange correlations for x > 0.15. We show how the long-range charge order is strongly temperature and doping dependent while the short-range correlations are essentially doping and temperature independent. Our study provides a complete charge order phase diagram across optimal doping. Long-range charge correlation fades-out around optimal doping. Short-range charge correlations are found beyond optimal doping and seemingly beyond the pseudogap phase. We thus conclude that neither the long- nor short-range charge correlations correlate with the pseudogap phenomenon.\nRESULTS Charge order correlations X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) across the copper L-edge for different doping concentrations x of LSCO are shown in the inset of Fig. 1a. Comparable data quality is obtained irrespective of doping and consistent with previous XAS studies of LSCO30. Example RIXS spectra on LSCO x= 0.145 and x= 0.16, recorded at the charge ordering wave vector for two different temperatures reveal scattering from elastic processes, phonon (70meV), spin (~0.3 eV) and dd (1.8 eV) excitations (Fig. 1a, b). The phonon-, spinand dd-contributions are consistent with previous RIXS studies24,31. A comparison of the two raw spectra shows that the elastic intensity is significantly enhanced at low temperature for x= 0.145 whereas elastic scattering appears temperature\n1Physik-Institut, Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. 2Department of Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, SE-412 96 G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. 3Laboratory for Neutron Scattering and Imaging, Paul Scherrer Institut, CH-5232 Villigen, PSI, Switzerland. 4Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8581, Japan. 5Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University, Box 516, 751 20 Uppsala, Sweden. 6Paul Scherrer Institut, CH-5232 Villigen, PSI, Switzerland. 7Department of Applied Physics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8646, Japan. 8Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany. 9Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. 10Department of Physics, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan. 11Department of Applied Sciences, Muroran Institute of Technology, Muroran 050-8585, Japan. 12European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, B.P. 220, 38043 Grenoble, France. 13Swiss Light Source, Photon Science Division, Paul Scherrer Institut, CH-5232 Villigen, PSI, Switzerland. \u2709email: karin.vonarx@uzh.ch; johan.chang@physik.uzh.ch\nwww.nature.com/npjquantmats\nPublished in partnership with Nanjing University\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () :,;\nindependent for x= 0.16. The momentum dependence of elastic and inelastic scattering recorded on LSCO x= 0.145 is shown in Fig. 1c\u2013f for longitudinal (h) and projected transverse (k) directions. In Fig. 1c, e data are recorded with an overall energy resolution of 129 meV (FWHM), whereas in d, f the resolution is 33meV. The direct comparison illustrates how the quasielastic scattering in c and e includes both elastic and phonon responses. Since the intensity from the charge order peak and the phonon branch are comparable, differentiation can only be reached by applying sufficiently high energy resolution. Lack of sufficient energy resolution implies a convolution of charge order and phonon scattering intensities. The optical phonon branch, extracted from the high-resolution data of LSCO x= 0.145 in Fig. 1d and of LSCO x= 0.16 in supplementary Fig. 3 shows a dispersion behavior consistent with previous studies24,31. In what follows, quasielastic intensity is defined by integrating the RIXS intensity in a window set by the respective energy resolution around zero energy loss\u2014see Fig. 1a. In this fashion, longitudinal and transverse elastic scans through the charge order vector were carried out for LSCO (x= 0.12, 0.138, 0.145, 0.16, and 0.2) and LESCO (x= 0.125, and 0.21) crystals. A linear background was subtracted. As shown in Fig. 2a, stripe order in LESCO x= 0.125 manifests by a reflection at Q= (\u03b4, 0) with \u03b4= 0.23, as previously reported27. At optimal doping (x ~ 0.16 shown in Fig. 2d, g) and in the overdoped limit, represented by LSCO x= 0.20 (Fig. 3d, e) and LESCO x= 0.21 (Supplementary Fig. 2), much less elastic scattering is found. For longitudinal (h) scans recorded with medium resolution, the convolution of charge order and phonon scattering leads to a double peak structure (Fig. 2b, c). The peak at (h, 0) \u2248 (1/3, 0) stems from the optical phonon mode, likely in combination with absorption effects for large values of h. In transverse (rocking) scans, illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2e, the charge order peak appears with an additional broadening (Fig. 2f, g). Once sufficient energy resolution to filter out the optical phonon contribution is applied, the double peak structure disappears in the longitudinal scans and sharper peaks are found in the transverse scans. The medium resolution data on its own would therefore lead to a misinterpretation of charge order parameters like incommensurability and correlation length. This comparison shows the\nimportance of high-resolution inelastic experiments as a probe of weak charge order away from 1/8 doping.\nFrom long-range order to short-range correlations In between 1/8 and optimal doping, our longitudinal scans show a decreasing elastic scattering intensity as doping is gradually increased. The evolution in doping shows a distinct transition in the nature of the charge correlation when the temperature dependence is taken into account. In Fig. 3a\u2013e, we display the temperature dependence for the LSCO x= 0.138, 0.145, 0.16, and 0.20 compounds. For x > 0.15, essentially no temperature dependence is observed up to 150 K. We note that these two compounds have been recorded with different energy resolution. Supplementary Fig. 5 therefore compares the two compounds directly for medium- and high-resolution measurements. Together with the data for LSCO 0.145 in Figs. 1c\u2013f and 2g it is revealed that the phonon contribution in the medium resolution k scans is only leading to a broadening of the peak while leaving the amplitude the same. Since the RIXS phonon intensity shows essentially no doping dependence for LSCO x= 0.12\u2212 0.2124, the almost identical medium-resolution scans for x= 0.16 and 0.20 lead to the conclusion that the elastic scattering must behave similarly. It can therefore be inferred from the absent temperature dependence in high-resolution LSCO x= 0.16 scans, that there is indeed no temperature dependence for x= 0.20 as well. By contrast, for LSCO x= 0.138 and 0.145 a pronounced temperature dependence is found. The charge order intensity is suppressed with increasing temperature for T > Tc. The long-range charge order is also partially suppressed for T < Tc in LSCO x= 0.145 due to phase competition with superconductivity21,26. By contrast, the shortrange charge correlations appear insensitive to phase competition with superconductivity (Fig. 3c\u2013e). This imposes a picture of two types of charge order: one long-range order that decays with temperature and short-range temperature-independent correlations. Our study provides a very narrow doping sector for the transition from temperature-dependent long-range order to temperature-independent short-range correlations between 0.145 and 0.16 doping. In fact, the transition may happen through a quantum critical point at x \u2248 0.15. In Fig. 4a\u2013c, we show how the incommensurability \u03b4, correlation length \u03be and integrated\nFig. 1 X-ray absorption and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra recorded on La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 as a function of energy loss and momentum. a, b High-resolution RIXS spectra recorded on LSCO x= 0.145 and 0.16 at the charge ordering vector for different temperatures as indicated.

            "text": "Several contradicting studies of stripe order in overdoped Labased cuprates have been published recently23\u201326,32,33. At 1/8 doping, charge order in LESCO could be detected above the onset temperature of the low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase34 and above the transport onset of the pseudogap35. As a function of doping, long-range charge order has been reported even outside the pseudogap phase of LSCO24,25. Another study reported shortrange charge correlations to exist within the pseudogap phase only and long-range charge order only around 1/8-doping26. Our comprehensive inelastic study suggests short-range correlations at low temperatures for x > 0.15 that persist across the pseudogap critical doping. The long-range stripe order by contrast decays fast\nas x\u2192 0.15. Our study therefore also contrasts the recent study reporting long-range charge order in LSCO, up to x= 0.2124, despite using the same measurement technique. Neither of the short or long-range charge correlations reported here seem to connect with the psesudogap phase. A recent magneto-transport experiment across the low-temperature pseudogap \u201ccritical\u201d point36 suggests a symmetry breaking Fermi surface transformation. This is not easily reconciled with charge order correlations37. In the first place, it is difficult to envision how short-range charge correlations can impact the electronic structure and produce a Fermi surface transformation38. The here reported high-resolution RIXS data on LSCO provide a different picture than the existing literature that is mutually inconsistent. Our results resemble what has been reported in YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x (YBCO). High-resolution RIXS measurements on YBCO and Nd1+xBa2\u2212xCu3O7\u2212\u03b4 reveal that the short-range correlations stem from quasi-elastic scattering processes39\u201342. Also in LSCO, it is not inconceivable that the short-range correlations result from dynamic charge fluctuations, for example, due to electron\u2013phonon coupling of a low-energy phonon branch. In fact, recent high-resolution O K-edge RIXS experiments on optimally doped LSCO indicate strong electron\u2013phonon coupling\nFig. 3 Charge order temperature and doping dependence. a\u2013e Transverse and longitudinal scans through the charge ordering vector (\u03b4, 0) recorded as a function of temperature, as indicated, on LSCO x= 0.138, 0.145, 0.16, and 0.20.

Just as in LSCO, the short and long-range charge correlations in YBCO and Nd1+xBa2\u2212xCu3O7\u2212\u03b4 occur with a very similar scattering vector. As long demonstrated, charge order in LSCO and YBCO differ by their respective ordering vectors QCO \u2248 (1/4, 0)6 and \u2248 (1/3, 0)44. The fact that the short-range correlations are so aligned with the longrange ordering strongly suggests a direct link. If the short-range charge correlations should be understood from electron\u2013phonon coupling, this could also be the case for long-range ordering. Now that similar short- and long-range charge correlations have been observed in both LSCO and YBCO, we discuss possible interpretations. The most prevailing view is that the long-range correlations manifest static charge order. The outstanding question is whether the short-range correlations are also static or in fact dynamic of nature. A transition from static long- to shortrange correlations implies a crossover phenomenon. Should the short-range correlation however be dynamic in nature, then the long-range static order would occur through a quantum phase transition. Recent high-resolution O K-edge RIXS experiments hint to a dynamic nature of the short-range correlations and thus favors the quantum critical scenario43. Yet, future experiments with even better energy resolution are needed to clarify the issue. Another experimental route to confirm quantum criticality is to induce long-range order using an external tuning parameters such as hydrostatic pressure or magnetic field. Another important question is why the La-214 and Y/Nd1237 systems display different long-range incommensurabilities45. A possibility is that the detailed crystal structure generates different electron\u2013phonon couplings46. Recently, it was shown how electron\u2013phonon coupling is enhanced inside the lowtemperature tetragonal (LTT) crystal structure of LESCO31\u2014 suggesting that electron\u2013phonon coupling assists in the formation of long-range stripe order. We conclude by commenting on the fact that the charge order incommensurabilities in LSCO and YBCO have opposite doping dependencies. If electron\u2013phonon coupling is solely responsible for charge ordering, a more universal picture would be expected. It is therefore conceivable that electron\u2013electron coupling also plays an important role. In the La-based cuprates, many experimental results point to a strong coupling picture which would support the electron\u2013electron interaction hypothesis.\nIrrespective of the responsible interactions, our observation of a charge order vanishing around optimally doped LSCO provides new perspectives. It opens for a unified picture of charge order as similar results are found in YBCO. Critical fluctuations around the optimal doping may also have bearing in superconductivity and strange metal properties."

A damped harmonic oscillator response function is adopted to model the magnetic excitations and a quadratic function is added to mimic the background (BG). The intensity of each spectrum is normalized to the integrated intensity of the dd excitations.

Wave vector Q at (qx, qy, qz) is defined as (h, k, l)= (qxa/2\u03c0, qyb/2\u03c0, qzc/2\u03c0) reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) using pseudo-tetragonal notation, with a \u2248 b \u2248 3.79 \u212b and c \u2248 13.1 \u212b. Energy resolution, expressed in full-widthat-half-maximum (FWHM) ranges from \u2248122 to 129 meV for ADRESS data and \u224833meV for the ID32 data. Momentum resolution was \u22480.006 r.l.u. for ADRESS data and \u22480.01 r.l.u. for the ID32 data, which is in both cases much smaller than the width\n0.22\n0.23\n0.24\n0.25\n(r .l.\nu. )\na\n25\n50\n75\n(\u00c5 )\nb\nmed. res. high res.\nLSCO LESCO\n0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0.16 Sr content x\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nI/ 2\n(\u00c5 2 )\n1e 4\nc\n0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200 0.225 Sr content x\n0\n50\n100\n150\nTe m\npe ra\ntu re\n( K)\nTC\nT*\nshort-range correlations\ncharge stripe order\nd\nFig. 4 Charge order parameters and phase diagram. a\u2013c Charge order incommensurability \u03b4, correlation length \u03be (defined as the inverse half-width-half-maximum) and integrated diffracted intensity (amplitude I divided by \u03be2) versus hole doping for LSCO (circles) and LESCO (squares) at base temperature.
