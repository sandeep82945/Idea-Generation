Longitudinal Studies on Neurodevelopmental Outcomes: Conduct longitudinal studies to follow children from birth into adolescence or adulthood to assess the long-term impacts of prenatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals on neurodevelopmental disorders beyond ASD and epilepsy, including cognitive function, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disabilities. This could provide insights into the progression and potential emergence of new symptoms or disorders over time.

Mechanistic Studies on the Role of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation: Investigate the biological mechanisms through which exposure to specific air pollutants and heavy metals (such as SO2, NO2, Pb, and Cd) during pregnancy contribute to the development of ASD and epilepsy. Focus on the role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA methylation in neurodevelopment, utilizing cellular and animal models to uncover specific pathways and potential targets for intervention.

Impact of Genetic and Environmental Interaction: Explore the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental exposures in the development of neurodevelopmental disorders. This research could identify specific genetic factors that make individuals more susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution and heavy metals, potentially leading to personalized prevention strategies.

Comparative Studies Across Different Geographic Regions and Populations: Conduct comparative studies to examine the incidence of ASD and epilepsy in relation to air pollution and heavy metal exposure across different geographic regions, cultures, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This would help identify population-specific vulnerabilities and the effects of varying levels of pollution, facilitating targeted public health interventions.

Interventional Studies on Mitigation Strategies: Design interventional studies to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in reducing prenatal exposure to harmful pollutants and heavy metals. These could include public health policies aimed at reducing emissions, personal protective measures for pregnant individuals, and nutritional interventions to mitigate the effects of toxic exposures. The outcomes of such studies could inform guidelines for protecting maternal and fetal health in polluted environments.
