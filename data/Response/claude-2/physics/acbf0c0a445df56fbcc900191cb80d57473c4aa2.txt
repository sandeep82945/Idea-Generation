 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop nonlinear soft sensor models using methods like neural networks or support vector regression and compare their performance to the linear PCR models. Nonlinear models may provide better estimation accuracy for complex distillation processes.

2. Investigate the use of dynamic PCA or dynamic PLS instead of dynamic PCR for developing the soft sensors. These methods account for autocorrelation in process variables and may lead to better dynamic soft sensor models. 

3. Evaluate the use of moving window PCR/PLS techniques where the models are recursively updated over time to account for process changes. This could further improve robustness.

4. Explore the use of ensemble soft sensor models where multiple models are combined to give the composition estimate. Ensemble approaches can improve accuracy and robustness. 

5. Extend the inferential control scheme to multicomponent distillation columns where there are more than two key components in the feed. Soft sensors will need to estimate multiple product compositions. New data-driven modeling techniques may be required.
