They play important roles in marine plankton, mediating proton action potentials that trigger the bioluminescent flash in dinoflagellates (6-8).

Proton channels perform varied tasks in many human cells, the best established being their synergistic relationship with NADPH oxidase (NOX) that produces reactive oxygen species in phagocytes (12-16), B lymphocytes (17), and other cells.\nRecently a significant number of membrane proteins, including ion channels, have been\nreported to interact directly with cholesterol within the plasma membrane. This interaction may affect the physiologically relevant properties of the protein, as has been found for a number of ion channels (18, 19). In many cases the protein-sterol interaction is facilitated by either a cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus sequence (CRAC) with (L/V)-X1-5-(Y)-X1-5-(K/R) or the inverse sequence CARC (K/R)-X1-5-(Y/F)-X1-5- (L/V) domains (20, 21). The human proton channel contains a putative CARC sequence KNNYAAMV (amino-acid residues 131-138) within the extrafacial part of its S2 transmembrane helix and therefore might interact with cholesterol."

            "text": "Cholesterol depletion or addition has profound effects on proton currents in inside-out patches. We explored possible effects of cholesterol depletion from or addition to the membrane\nusing methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (MBCD, Methods). When currents were studied in the inside-out patches excised from cells transfected with the human proton channel, hHV1, filling the recording chamber with cholesterol-free MBCD solution caused a gradual increase in proton current amplitude on a time scale of tens of minutes (Fig. 1). In some cases, the current increased 500% or more upon depletion of cholesterol. The changes in current amplitude were slow and progressive, with the rate of change varying substantially between patches, and did not appear to plateau within the time frame of a typical experiment, making quantitation difficult and unavoidably arbitrary. A further complication was that in most patches, the current amplitude decreased gradually during the first 10-20 min or so after patch excision. We routinely waited until the current appeared reasonably stationary before adding or depleting cholesterol. With these qualifications in mind, depletion of cholesterol increased the current by a factor of 2.79 \u00b1 0.36 (mean \u00b1 SEM) in 29 membrane patches over a period ranging 10-40 min. Subsequent replacement of the chamber solution with one containing MBCD saturated with cholesterol caused gradual reduction of the current over a roughly similar time course (Fig. 1B). After cholesterol depletion, introduction of cholesterol-saturated MBCD decreased currents by a factor 1.84 \u00b1 0.21 in 14 patches that survived this long procedure. Changing the bath solution yet again to cholesterol-free MBCD caused an increase in current again in 5 cells that survived this long procedure. Despite the large changes in proton current amplitude, the gating kinetics and position of the gH-V relationship remained largely unchanged, as is evident by inspection of Fig. 1A. Proton current activation did not change significantly, becoming slightly faster upon cholesterol depletion, with\nact decreasing by 13 \u00b1 14% from its initial value in 10 cells in which the kinetics was resolvable.\n4 8/17/2023\nIn 7 cells, cholesterol replenishment slowed act by 44 \u00b1 21%; neither change was significant (p = 0.39 or 0.10). The similarity of proton channel behavior during these large changes in current amplitude strongly suggests that the number of active channels changes, rather than the properties of individual channels.\nCholesterol has minimal effects in whole-cell configuration. In stark contrast to the dramatic\neffects of cholesterol on WT human Hv1 currents in inside-out patch configuration, we found virtually no change in proton current in whole-cell configuration when cholesterol was depleted from the membrane by addition of MBCD to the bath solution. None of the main properties of hHV1 changed noticeably. In 6 cells, the maximum current at +40 mV relative to the current in the same cell before depletion, was 0.96 \u00b1 0.06 (p = 0.5 by Student\u2019s t-test, hypothesis tested: value\nchange \u2260 1). The time constant of activation of current, act, determined by fitting the rising current to a single exponential, averaged 0.95 \u00b1 0.13 that of the control measurements (p = 0.72, n = 5). The lack of effect in whole-cell configuration argues against direct modulation of hHV1 properties by cholesterol.\nA recent report describes an increase in proton current in whole-cell configuration upon\ndepletion of cholesterol by MBCD (22). The reported response was much smaller (~40%) than that observed here in excised patches, and was not shown to be reversible. We used a several-fold lower concentration of MBCD (~1.5 mM vs. 5 mM) which may account for the lack of effect on whole-cell currents in the present study. MBCD at concentration of 5 mM or higher is known to extract not only cholesterol but also polar lipids (particularly sphingolipids) from the cell membranes (23). While we cannot rule out possible small effects of cholesterol in whole-cell configuration, the large changes in H+ current in excised patches clearly reflect a distinct phenomenon. This phenomenon is the subject of the present study.\nIncreased H+ current with cholesterol depletion may reflect increased numbers of channels in the patch. One explanation for the observed effects of cholesterol on proton currents in patches\nbut not in whole-cell configuration is that hHV1 molecules diffuse between the exposed patch and the membrane attached to the glass pipette walls. We explored this possibility by applying suction to the pipette, which would be expected to pull more membrane into the conductive part of the patch membrane, increasing the number of channels and hence the current (Fig. S1A) (24-26). Given that a previous study reported increased H+ current with suction in excised patches (27), it was not surprising that we observed similar increases (Fig. S1B). H+ current increased during suction, and the increase was larger with greater suction: 10 or 20 in H2O (\u22482.5 or \u22485 kPa) increased the current reversibly by 33\u00b17 or 60\u00b15 %, respectively (n = 4 or 7). Similar effects were explained previously by proposing mechanosensitivity of HV1, so that increased membrane tension increased the single channel conductance (27). But the result is also consistent with the idea that the altered currents were due to the addition or removal of electrically detectable membrane area (along with associated channels) from the patch (24-26). The latter interpretation is consistent\n5 8/17/2023\nwith the lack of effect of cholesterol modulation in the whole-cell configuration. It is possible that both mechanisms (mechanosensitivity and lateral channel diffusion) coexist.\nProton currents in whole-cell configuration were largely insensitive to membrane stretch.\nOsmotic swelling activates a ubiquitous chloride current, which is elicited reliably by lowering the external osmolarity by 25% (28) or even by 12% (29). K+ currents activated by cell swelling using 17-34% hypoosmotic solutions have also been reported (30). When we reduced the osmolarity by 23% there was little or no change in whole-cell hHV1 currents (Fig. S2). This was the case whether we kept the ionic strength constant by removing sucrose from the hypotonic solution, or if we doubled the ionic strength, keeping osmolarity constant (Fig. S2). Previously, we found minimal effects on proton currents upon reducing the ionic strength by 90% (31). The insensitivity of whole-cell HV1 currents to membrane stretch supports the interpretation that a significant fraction of the suction effects in patches (Fig. S1) is attributable to diffusion of channels between the seal and the patch membrane."

            "heading": "Hypothesis",
            "text": "Hypothesis: HV1 associates with cholesterol-containing lipid domains. The effects of cholesterol depletion or saturation in both hHV1 (Fig. 1) and mHV1 (see below) show clearly that cholesterol influences HV1 proton currents, whereas the lack of significant effect in whole-cell configuration indicates that this influence is not direct. To explain these phenomena, we hypothesize that cholesterol affects primarily the number of active proton channels within patches rather than their properties (Fig. 2). A significant fraction of the membrane within the excised patch adheres tightly to the glass walls of the pipette and therefore does not contribute to the measured current (24). This adhesion is thought to be facilitated by the interaction of large extracellular domains of membrane proteins (26). A preferential adhesion of these proteins with glass would lead to their accumulation at the glass-membrane interface. Many of these proteins are cell adhesion proteins (e.g., CD44, integrins, etc.) which also reside within membrane \u2018domains,\u2019 analogous to what have been called lipid rafts (32-35). If proton channels reside preferentially in these domains, they would also become concentrated in the membrane-glass contact area and depleted from the patch. One indication that this is indeed the case was seen immediately after the gigaseal was formed and the patch was excised. The proton current typically decreased several- fold within the first few minutes after patch formation. This can be explained by lateral diffusion of individual membrane domains together with proton channels towards the membrane-glass interface where proteins with large ectodomains will adhere to the glass and thus accumulate preferentially (Fig. 2A, Left Side). Eventually a significant fraction of the domains and HV1 are depleted from the electricallyconducting part of the patch, reducing the current. \u201cRun-down\u201d of currents after patch excision has been reported frequently for many other ion channels and various explanations have been proposed (36-38), but in some cases it may reflect our proposed mechanism.\n6 8/17/2023\nSome membrane domains (e.g., lipid rafts) are cholesterol-dependent. The depletion of\ncholesterol from the membrane would cause the dispersal of such domains and liberation of trapped proteins (Fig. 2A, Right Side). Proteins with small extracellular motifs, such as hHV1 (whose two extracellular linkers are each just 8 amino acids long), would be expected to diffuse laterally and re-equilibrate throughout the membrane similarly to individual lipid molecules (24, 25). For HV1 this would increase recorded current as channels move from the seal into the electrically conducting patch membrane.\nAn independent indication of the lateral mobility of HV1 molecules within the patch is the\nfact that proton current increases reversibly if suction is applied to the patch pipette (Fig. S1B). Our results with cholesterol modulation strongly support the mechanism based on the flow of lipids and small proteins, such as HV1, within the membrane in agreement with Suchyna and colleagues (26).\nMechanism of HV1 association with lipid domains\nThe effects of cholesterol are not due to binding to the CARC domain in hHV1. It is thought that binding of cholesterol to CRAC/CARC domains controls the partitioning of some proteins to the cholesterol-rich membrane domains (21). In order to test whether cholesterol binding to the CARC domain in hHV1 is responsible for the retention of HV1 within the membrane domains, we mutated Tyr134 of wild-type hHV1 to Ala (Y134A). Tyr or Phe residues are essential for cholesterol binding by a CARC domain in other proteins (18, 20). Recordings using inside-out patch configuration demonstrated clearly that this mutant retains its cholesterol sensitivity (Fig. 3, yellow bars). The mean change in current amplitude after depletion or replenishment of cholesterol was actually larger than in WT experiments, but not significantly different. Therefore, even if the putative CARC domain in hHV1 is functional, it does not control the association of the channel with cholesterol-dependent domains.\nMurine HV1 (mHV1) exhibits a similar response to cholesterol. Intriguingly, the mouse channel, mHV1, while highly homologous with hHV1 (78% amino acid sequence identity), lacks a classical CARC sequence at the corresponding site because it lacks K or R at the required position (Fig. S3). Nor does any other region in mHV1 contain functional CARC or CRAC sequences. It was therefore of interest to see whether cholesterol manipulation still affects the current. Fig. 3 (mHV1, blue bars) illustrates that cholesterol depletion and saturation produced similar responses in WT mHV1 channels as were seen in hHV1. The fact that the depletion/addition treatment cycle restored mHV1 current to its initial value indicates that the treatment did not significantly alter other properties of the patch membrane (e.g., phospholipid composition) that could, in principle, also influence HV1. The similarity of cholesterol effects in mHV1 to those in hHV1 argues further against the response being mediated by binding of cholesterol to the CARC domain in hHV1.\n7 8/17/2023\nThe effects of cholesterol may be mediated by intracellular regions of hHV1. In view of the apparent irrelevance of the CARC domain to the association of hHV1 with membrane domains, we hypothesized that such association might instead be mediated by direct binding of HV1 to another protein that in turn is targeted to cholesterol dependent membrane lipid domains (Fig. 2B). This protein-protein interaction is likely to be facilitated by the large cytoplasmic domains (consisting of both the C- and N-termini) of the proton channel. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether proton currents conducted by \u0394N\u0394C-truncated mutants (which lack both the intracellular Nterminus and C-terminus) respond to modulation of membrane cholesterol. Both truncated forms of mouse and human HV1 exhibited only weak dependence on cholesterol content (Fig. 3, red bars) when compared to WT. Therefore, following our hypothesis, one or both termini are essential for the association of HV1 with membrane domains.\nWe then proceeded to test whether an hHV1 mutant with the C-terminus truncated (hHV1-\n\u0394C) retains the cholesterol sensitivity (Fig. 3, green bars). Currents recorded with this mutant indeed responded to the depletion of cholesterol from the patch membrane, as well as its subsequent restoration almost identically to WT, suggesting that the C terminus does not contribute to cholesterol effects. We attempted to conduct analogous studies of an N-terminal truncated mutant, but could not detect viable currents in inside-out patches. Nevertheless, the finding that hHV1-\u0394C current is modulated by cholesterol but hHV1-\u0394C\u0394N current is not strongly implicates the N-terminus of hHV1 in the association of the channel with membrane domains. In view of the fact that HV1 exists in mammalian cell membranes as a dimer largely due to coiled-coil interactions of the C termini (39-41), it is not surprising that the N terminus would more likely be available to interact with other intracellular protein components (Fig. 2B).\nIdentifying binding partners of HV1 in lipid domains. Concluding that HV1 associates with lipid domains via attachment of its intracellular N terminus to other raft-associated proteins, we wanted to identify its binding partner(s). To narrow down the list of candidates we reasoned that in order to account for the magnitude of the proton current changes observed when cholesterol is depleted, the raft-residing protein that targets HV1 to the cholesterol-rich domains must be abundant: HV1 has a very low single channel conductance of 20 fS at pHi 7.0 (42), therefore observed changes require a movement of thousands of proton channels and therefore also of raft-targeting proteins bound to them. For example, the increase in current shown on Fig. 1B would require a movement of \u22485000 channels from the glass/membrane contact area into the conductive patch. We also reasoned that since proton channels are essential for charge compensation and sustained production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during phagocytosis (13-16, 43) the raft-tropic protein(s) should also be abundantly present in phagosomes. Flotillins 1 and 2 as well as stomatin fit perfectly into this role: they are all highly abundant in cholesterol-dependent membrane domains and are present in phagosomes (44, 45). To test this hypothesis, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. Results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that stomatin indeed precipitates when hHV1-GFP is used as the bait. We further modified the standard co-IP procedure to characterize the nature of interactions between hHV1 and stomatin. A standard co-IP\n8 8/17/2023\nexperimental procedure uses a mild detergent to disrupt the cells and solubilize the proteins. Since low temperature (2-4\u00baC) is also used, these conditions are known to result in the formation of detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) - large protein-lipid complexes containing variety of proteins that are held together by interactions that are crucially dependent on cholesterol (32, 46- 48). Therefore, the regular co-IP procedure cannot rule out the possibility that hHV1 and stomatin are simply present together in the same lipid domain rather than interacting directly or through an adaptor protein. To test for this possibility, we used cholesterol oxidase to convert virtually all cholesterol in the cell lysate into cholestenone (cholest-4-en-3-one) prior to co-IP procedure. This reaction was conducted at 2\u00baC and was run to completion over ~2 hours. We then repeated the coIP procedure using this enzymatically treated lysate and found that the results did not change: stomatin co-immunoprecipitates with WT hHV1-GFP (Fig. 4). Because cholestenone does not support the existence or maintenance of rafts (53, 54), the coprecipitation shows that hHV1 associates with stomatin via protein-protein interactions that are independent of cholesterol. In a separate set of patch-clamp experiments, we tested the effects of replacing cholesterol in the patch with cholestenone. To do this the excised patch was exposed to the MBCD solution saturated with cholestenone. Since the solution contained no cholesterol, this caused a rapid removal of cholesterol from the patch membrane and its substitution with cholestenone. This procedure caused the proton currents to increase (1.75 \u00b1 0.17)-fold (n = 4, p = 0.022), similar to the effect observed when cholesterol is simply depleted (Fig. 3). We have also conducted co-IP experiments using the cells co-transfected with hHV1-GFP and flotillins 1 or 2 but found no association between these proteins. Together, the results strongly support the role of cholesterol-independent binding of HV1 and stomatin in concentrating HV1 molecules in lipid domains."

            "text": "HV1 associates with cholesterol-rich lipid domains.\nModulation of cholesterol levels had no clear effect on proton currents in whole-cell configuration, but dramatically altered current amplitude in inside-out patches excised from cell membranes. This discrepancy suggests that cholesterol does not directly affect proton currents. Despite the presence of a CARC sequence in hHV1 that potentially could bind cholesterol, there was no evidence that the effects of cholesterol that we observed required binding to this site; a mutation designed to disrupt the CARC domain (Y134A in hHV1) did not eliminate cholesterol effects. Furthermore, identical cholesterol effects were seen in mHV1 which unlike hHv1 lacks a functional CARC or CRAC sequence. Instead, the relationship between the cholesterol content of the membrane and proton current amplitude is interpreted within the framework of a proposed mechanism in which hHV1 molecules preferentially associate with cholesterol-dependent domains within the membrane that are anchored to the walls of the pipette.\nIf HV1 preferentially associates with lipid domains as illustrated in Fig 2, it would tend to\naccumulate in the seal region. If cholesterol is then depleted the lipid domains disassemble and\n9 8/17/2023\nrelease HV1 molecules to equilibrate throughout the patch membrane. For this to occur, HV1 must be free to diffuse laterally. There is a large literature on the rates of lateral diffusion of membrane proteins, especially ion channels. At just 273 amino acids (31.7 kDa), hHV1 is a relatively tiny ion channel, and given its minuscule extracellular loops (both comprise 8 amino acids) it seems very likely that HV1 is free to diffuse within the membrane. We support this notion by showing that suction, which would be expected to pull membrane and channels contained therein into the electrically accessible patch, rapidly and reversibly increases proton current. Together, the data strongly support the interpretation that cholesterol affects in excised patches reflect changes in numbers of channels in the electrically exposed membrane.\nEvidence consistent with the presence of hHV1 within lipid rafts was presented earlier (17).\nIn this work Capasso and colleagues showed that in stimulated B-cells hHV1 associates with the B-cell receptor (BCR), which in turn has long been known to reside within cholesterol-dependent ordered membrane domains (lipid rafts) (49). This association does not establish direct interaction between the BCR and proton channel molecules but rather that both proteins are independently targeted to the same ordered lipid environment. Recent work (50) has shown that BCR activation (cross-linking) can induce the formation of relatively large signaling membrane platforms that are able to concentrate or exclude other membrane proteins based on their structure. The reported profile of membrane protein partitioning into these BCR-induced signaling platforms closely follows the one expected for ordered lipid cholesterol-dependent rafts (50). Therefore, it is highly likely that BCR cross-linking causes the accretion of smaller pre-existing domains rather than creating them de novo. In case of the association between BCR and hHV1 (17) this would mean that hHV1 is first targeted by an unknown mechanism to the rafts which then coalesce upon B-cell activation.\nAccepting that HV1 channel proteins preferentially associate with lipid domains in the\nmembrane, we next ask how this association occurs. The hHv1 protein lacks the obvious features, such as palmitoylation (21), typically associated with partitioning into lipid domains. Direct binding of HV1 to cholesterol in these domains also seems unlikely, because cholesterol effects were not related to the presence or absence of a CARC domain. This leaves the possibility that HV1 is directed to rafts via interaction with other raft-resident proteins. We next asked which part of the HV1 protein was involved in this association. The large intracellular N- or C-termini of HV1 seem good candidates, because the extracellular loops are small. The fact that truncation of both N-and C-termini largely eliminated the cholesterol effect in both hHV1 and mHV1 supports this idea. Truncation of the C-terminus of hHV1 alone had no effect. These results indicate that interaction of HV1 with rafts is mediated by its N-terminus. Given the coiled-coil interaction of the C termini that enforces dimeric nature of HV1 in many species, the N-terminus would be expected to be more accessible to interact with other proteins (Fig. 2C).\nIdentifying HV1 binding partners.\n10 8/17/2023\nWe speculated that stomatin and flotillins 1/2, which are well-known components of lipid domains (51), and are required for efficient pathogen elimination via phagocytosis (45, 52), might interact with HV1. An anchor protein must be very abundant to bind a significant fraction of HV1 molecules in view of the low HV1 single channel conductance (42). Stomatin and flotillins 1/2 fulfill these requirements. Therefore, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 4). Our co-IP experiments clearly show that stomatin co-precipitates with wild type hHV1 (GFP-tagged) when a standard co-IP protocol is used. We then questioned whether the observed association of hHV1 and stomatin is due to specific protein-protein binding or rather non-specific interaction facilitated by the formation of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) (32, 46-48) promoted by the use of mild non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100, CHAPS, NP-40 for cell lysis as well as low temperatures (to prevent the degradation of the lysate). Immunoprecipitating any of the proteins contained within DRMs would precipitate DRMs as a whole, which would reduce the specificity and significance of the co-IP results. To address this concern, we treated the cell lysate with cholesterol oxidase prior to the co-IP. Cholesterol oxidase retains a significant fraction of its activity at 2\u00baC and converts cholesterol into cholest-4-en-3-one. It has been shown that cholest-4en-3-one, unlike cholesterol, does not support the formation of liquid ordered lipid phase (53, 54) and so oxidation of nearly all cholesterol eliminates any cholesterol-dependent DRM formation. When we repeated the co-IP experiments after oxidizing cholesterol in the cell lysate, we again found that stomatin precipitates together with hHV1 (Fig. 4) supporting the hypothesis that cholesterol-independent protein-protein binding determines the association of the two proteins. We found no evidence of association of hHV1 and flotillins 1/2 under the same conditions.\nHere we report drastic enhancement of proton currents by cholesterol depletion from\ninside-out patches of membrane containing the human proton channel hHV1 that was reversed upon restoration of cholesterol. These effects were observed only in excised patches and thus are indirect. Two results rule out the idea that direct binding of cholesterol to the CARC motif mediates the effects of cholesterol observed here. First, mutation of the CARC region did not alter the effects of changing cholesterol content of the membrane. Second, despite lacking a recognizable CRAC or CARC sequence, the mouse channel mHV1 responded to changes in cholesterol identically to the human channel. We conclude that HV1 channels preferentially associate with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains. This association requires the intracellular N terminus of hHV1 or mHV1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that stomatin binds to hHV1. Although stomatin is known to co-localize with cholesterol-dependent lipid domains and to support the formation of multimeric protein scaffolds (55), and a number of ion channels are thought to also associate with lipid domains, very little evidence exists for direct binding of channels with stomatin. This study provides strong evidence that HV1 associates with membrane lipid domains or \u201crafts\u201d (32) by direct interaction with stomatin, providing a mechanism for the localization of these channels to membrane regions where they are needed, for example in phagosomes or other organelles. Lipid raft microdomains localized in phagosomes contain stomatin and flotillins which are required for normal anti-microbial function (44, 45, 52). Thus, a\n11 8/17/2023\nlikely function of stomatin in phagosomes is to recruit HV1 channels, which are essential to phagosomal ROS production (13-16, 43)."

Currents were filtered at 0.5-2.9 kHz using hardware filters and then at 20 Hz using the built-in digital filter of a Heka patch-clamp amplifier (EPC-9 or EPC-10). The maximum proton current was the average value recorded during the last 25 ms of a voltage pulse.\nChanging cholesterol levels. Cholesterol content within the patch membrane was varied using\nmethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (MBCD), which has been employed previously to modulate membrane cholesterol (23, 58, 59). Cholesterol was depleted from the patch by filling the recording chamber with a solution of 2 mg/ml MBCD in pH 7 solution. In order to load cholesterol, the same MBCD solution was pre-equilibrated with an excess of crystalline cholesterol and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter immediately before filling the chamber. These treatments acutely adjust membrane cholesterol content between two extremes (significantly depleted or overloaded). In order to substitute cholesterol in the patch with cholest-4-en-3-one (cholestenone) the bath solution was replaced with 2 mM MBCD solution saturated with cholest-4-en-3-one (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Proton channel co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting. 293T cells co-transfected with\nWT hHV1-GFP and STOM-N-myc, or FLOT1-N-myc, or FLOT2-N-myc (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA) were lysed at 2\u00baC in lysis buffer (0.5% CHAPS (Millipore-Sigma), 150 mM NaCl, 60 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with Halt phosphatase and protease inhibitors (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). In some experiments cholesterol was oxidized before the co-IP step in order to achieve this 2.5 U/ml of cholesterol oxidase (CO)(Millipore), 20 U/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Millipore-Sigma), and 50 \u00b5g/ml 10-Acetyl-3,7dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were added to the lysate and\n12 8/17/2023\nincubated at 2\u00baC for 3 hours. Inclusion of HRP and ADHP protects the lysate from oxidation by scavenging hydrogen peroxide produced by the CO and allows to monitor the completion of the reaction. Virtually all cholesterol was oxidized in 2 hours. In the experiments using hHv1-GFP as bait, rabbit anti-GFP antibody (cat#50430-2-AP, Proteintech Group Inc, Rosemont, IL) coupled to the Protein-G Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to capture the protein complexes. Captured complexes were dissociated from the beads in the \u00d72 Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/western blotting using chemiluminescent substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and Azure 300 imager (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA). Antibodies used for protein detection were as follows: anti-GFP, anti-stomatin (cat. #678941-1-Ig, Proteintech Group Inc.), anti-flot1, and anti-flot2 (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, Colorado)."

            "text": "Figure S1. (A) Suction applied to the patch would increase the surface area of exposed patch, increasing the proton current in direct proportion to the increased membrane area. Patch area increased due to diffusion of lipids and small proteins, including a fraction of HV1 channels not bound within the membrane domains. (B) Membrane stretch increases hHV1 proton current in excised patches at pH 7//7. Test pulses to +60 mV were applied to an inside-out patch from Vhold = -40 mV and the indicated suction (in inches of water) applied to the pipette interior.\n19 8/17/2023\nFigure S2. Osmotic effect on proton currents in whole-cell patch clamp configuration\nA) Whole-cell patch clamp measurement in the same cell, at hypotonic (231 mOsM, Hypo), isotonic (300 mOsM, Iso), and isotonic with 25% higher ionic strength (300 mOsM, Iso (h.i.s)) conditions. The pH of the cytosolic and the extracellular solution was 7.0. Back buffer exchange to control isotonic solution (300 mOsM) is labelled as Iso_b. The progression of the measurement is shown from left to right. The total duration of the experiment was 1 hour (video recording available!).\nB) The maximal proton conductance obtained by different pulse lengths (from 1 s to 8 s) of the experiment shown in A is plotted against voltage.\n20 8/17/2023\nC) Time constants of activation (solid symbols) and deactivation (open symbols) of the experiment depicted in A.\nD) Comparison between the mean values (\u00b1 S.E.M.) of the threshold of activation (Vthres) of proton currents under isotonic (300 mOsM, Iso) and hypotonic (231 mOsM, Hypo) conditions. Under isotonic environments, the proton currents activate at 1.4 \u00b1 3.4 mV (n = 7) while at hypotonic conditions activate at 2.0 \u00b1 4.9 mV (n = 5). All experiments were done at symmetrical pHo = pHi = 7.0.\nE) To analyse if osmolarity has an effect on the maximal proton conductance (gH,max) at the steadystate, ratios of isotonic, gH,max (Iso) to hypotonic, gH,max (Hypo), at the same voltage are plotted. Each point represents a single experiment, the dashed line represents no effect (gH,max (Iso) = gH,max (Hypo)). The blue line shows the mean value (\u00b1 S.E.M.) of 0.95 \u00b1 0,03 for the total of experiments (n = 7). All experiments were done at symmetrical pHo = pHi = 7.0."
