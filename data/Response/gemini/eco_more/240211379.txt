1. **Investigate the robustness of the method to different types of micro data.** The paper focuses on using repeated cross-sections of individual consumption data, but it would be interesting to see how the method performs with other types of micro data, such as income data, wealth data, or labor market data.
2. **Develop a more formal theoretical framework for the method.** The paper provides some theoretical justification for the method, but it would be helpful to develop a more formal framework that could be used to analyze the properties of the method and to compare it to other estimation methods.
3. **Apply the method to a larger and more complex heterogeneous-agent model.** The paper uses a small-scale HANK model to illustrate the method, but it would be interesting to see how the method performs with a larger and more complex model, such as a model with multiple sectors or a model with heterogeneous firms.
4. **Investigate the use of the method for forecasting.** The paper focuses on estimation, but it would be interesting to see how the method could be used for forecasting. For example, one could use the method to forecast future consumption growth or future inflation.
5. **Develop a method for incorporating macro data into the estimation.** The paper focuses on using micro data, but it would be interesting to develop a method for incorporating macro data into the estimation. This would allow one to use both micro and macro data to estimate the model, which could lead to more efficient estimates.
