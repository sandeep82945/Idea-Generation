            "text": "Background: Multigene panel testing is an important component of cancer treatment plans and risk\nassessment, but there are many different panel options and choosing the most appropriate panel\ncan be challenging for healthcare providers and patients. Electronic tools have been proposed to help patients make informed decisions about which gene panel to choose by considering their preferences and priorities.\nMaterials and Methods: An electronic decision aid tool was developed in line with the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) collaboration. The multidisciplinary project team collaborated with an external healthcare communications agency and the MGH Cancer Center patient family advisory committee (PFAC) to develop the decision aid. Surveys of genetic counselors and patients were used to scope the content, and alpha testing was used to refine the design and content.\nResults: Surveys of genetic counselors (n=12) and patients (n=228) identified common themes in discussing panel size and strategies for helping patients decide between panels and in identifying confusing terms for patients and distribution of patients\u2019 choices. The decision aid, organized into two major sections, provides educational text, graphics and videos to guide patients through the decisionmaking process. Alpha testing feedback from the PFAC (n=4), genetic counselors (n=3) and a group of lay people (n=8) identified areas to improve navigation, simplify wording and improve layout.\nConclusion: The decision aid developed in this study has the potential to facilitate informed decisionmaking by patients regarding cancer genetic testing. The distinctive feature of this decision aid is that it addresses the specific question of which multigene panel may be most suitable for the patient. Its acceptability and effectiveness will be evaluated in future studies.\nShannon et al, Page | 4"

            "text": "Germline genetic testing has become a critical component of oncology treatment plans for many\npatients, including those with breast, ovarian, colon, pancreas, and other solid tumors. One of the most widely used types of genetic testing is multigene panel testing, which can simultaneously analyze multiple genes associated with a particular disease or a group of related conditions. While multigene panel testing can provide important diagnostic and therapeutic information, choosing the most appropriate panel for each patient can be a challenging task for healthcare providers and patients. This is because different tests may cover different sets of genes, have varying sensitivity and specificity, and offer various levels of clinical utility, among other factors. As a result, the selection of the optimal test can be a complex and daunting task, which requires careful consideration of multiple clinical and genetic factors.\nMultigene panel testing can generate a large amount of complex and heterogeneous data,\nwhich can be difficult for healthcare providers and patients to interpret and utilize effectively. As highlighted by a recent review by Leenen et al. (2021), the interpretation and communication of genetic test results can be particularly challenging for patients, who may struggle to understand the implications of the results for their health and the health of their relatives. In addition, the choice of a specific multigene panel test can have important implications for patients, including psychological and emotional impacts, financial costs, and potential risks and benefits associated with the test. The variety of multi-gene cancer panel options complicates the process of informed consent as it relates to patient autonomy in medical decision-making (del Carmen, 2005). This critical element of the genetic testing process allows the patient to decide which, if any, multi-gene panel they would like to pursue, as aligned with their values. Genetic counselors typically invest a significant amount of time facilitating the\nShannon et al, Page | 6\ndetailed educational component and decision-making process for each patient considering multigene panel testing.\nThe clinical indications for germline genetic testing are expanding at a rapid pace, and germline\ngenetic testing for all patients with solid tumors may soon be a reality (Liu, 2021). The traditional model of pre-test informed consent performed by a genetic counselor is not scalable given the limitations in the genetic counseling workforce (Esplin, 2022). Mainstream genetic testing is becoming an accepted alternative model, in which patients undergo pre-test genetic counseling and informed consent by their non-genetics healthcare provider (Bokkers, 2022). According to a study by Best et al. (2018), however, healthcare providers reported they lacked the necessary knowledge and expertise to choose the most appropriate multigene panel test for their patients, and often relied on personal experience or expert opinions to make a decision.\nElectronic patient-facing educational tools have been developed to facilitate genetic testing and\nhave been shown to increase patient knowledge and empowerment surrounding decision-making (Cragun, 2020). Furthermore, studies show that clinicians using decision aids (DAs) report improved quality of care and satisfaction in the shared decision-making process (Sepucha, 2016). However, most tools address the decision to pursue one genetic testing option rather than which multigene panel to select among the many options. Given the promising preliminary data, we proposed the development of a comprehensive electronic tool for ovarian cancer patients to facilitate patient education while maximizing patient autonomy. Our goal was to have patients select one of four options: pursue a smaller panel of clinically actionable genes related to ovarian cancer, pursue a medium-sized panel of mostly clinically actionable genes across cancer types, pursue a large panel of both clinically actionable and non-actionable genes across cancer types, or decline genetic testing. Here we describe the design of\nShannon et al, Page | 7\nthis electronic decision aid tool designed to help patients to make more informed and personalized decisions about which gene panel to choose by considering their preferences, values, and priorities."

As a comprehensive cancer center, MGH Cancer Center provides expert care for patients with diverse types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. Most patients with ovarian cancer are treated by highly specialized gynecologic oncologists. The MGH Center for Cancer Risk Assessment (CCRA) provides genetic counseling and testing services to a wide variety of patients with and without cancer. Despite a staff of 14 genetic counselors, the number of cancer patients requiring access to genetic testing was outpacing the clinical capacity. Thus, we explored the possibility of mainstreaming genetic testing in ovarian cancer patients, meaning the patient would be educated and consented for genetic testing by the treating gynecologic medical oncologist.\nWhen we proposed mainstream genetic testing model to the gynecologic oncology providers at\nour institution, they identified two main concerns with the mainstream approach. They expressed concern for a lack of expertise in providing pre-test patient education and in helping patients choose the most appropriate gene panel. Their bigger concern, however, was the amount of additional clinic visit time required given the lengthy nature of the informed consent process. We sought to alleviate these two concerns by developing a patient-friendly intervention to assist in the patient education and decision-making process."

            "heading": "Multi-step framework",
            "text": "Our decision aid was developed in line with the framework described by Coulter et al. and put\nforth by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) collaboration, which consists of five\nShannon et al, Page | 8\nsteps: (1) defining the scope, (2) design, (3) prototype development, (4) alpha testing and steering committee review, and (5) beta testing [Coulter 2013]. Here we focus on the first four steps; beta testing is occurring in both a pilot study and as a randomized controlled trial and will be reported separately.\n1. Defining the Scope\nOur decision aid focused on a target audience of ovarian cancer patients for three main reasons.\nFirst, germline genetic testing for ovarian cancer patients is universally recommended (NCCN 2022), obviating the need to determine eligibility for testing based on family history or other factors. Second, because of the universal recommendation, most insurance companies cover the cost of germline genetic testing for ovary patients, mitigating the discussion of out-of-pocket cost. Finally, ovarian cancer is a relatively uncommon diagnosis, with <100 new patients diagnosed at our institution each year, making this an ideal population in which to pilot a mainstream genetic testing model.\nOur project team was comprised of genetic counselors, medical oncologists, decision scientist\nand health communication experts. As is consistent with our current clinical genetic counseling practice, the team wanted a DA (Decision Aid) that provided multiple options for genetic testing be offered to patients. Throughout, we wanted the DA to use a combination of written information, graphics, and audio/video content to accommodate various learning styles. We planned to include patient quotes as part of the educational strategy. Finally, following IPDAS, we wanted to include a values clarification exercise and a summary component to assist patients in decision-making regarding three panel options for genetic testing (Figure 1).\nAfter an extensive literature review, we found there were various genetic testing DAs available,\nbut few were truly interactive or designed for patient use (Williams et al 2008; Birch 2015). In addition, most DAs for cancer predisposition testing were tailored to syndrome-specific/gene-specific testing (Peterson et al 2004; Sherman et al 2018). Our team reached out to the National Society of Genetic\nShannon et al, Page | 9\nCounselors (www.nsgc.org), who expressed support for this unique project. We secured an educational grant from Astra Zeneca (Grant ID# 41473887) for the development of the electronic DA.\n2. Design\nOur project team collaborated with an external healthcare communications agency (Health\nCommunication Core (HCC)) and the MGH Cancer Center Patient Family Advisory Committee (PFAC) to identify key information about the germline genetic testing and informed consent process that would be essential to patient understanding.\nThe HCC held discussions with the project team to clarify how the DA would be integrated into\nthe clinical flow and underwent mock counseling sessions with the CCRA genetic counselor staff to determine how best to replicate in-person counseling in the decision aid. Once the major educational topics were identified, we sought to determine the appropriate \u2018flow\u2019 of the aid and decided to gather more information on current practice models. Our project team investigated how genetic counselors were facilitating patient decision-making in the traditional setting, and we conducted an online anonymous survey of the CCRA genetic counselors. Two terms were defined, and the 3 questions were asked in an open-ended text box (Figure 3).\nFinally, the Project team developed an IRB (Institutional Review Board) study (MGB\nIRB#2019P000342) to survey patients and genetic counselors to learn more about how individuals make decisions about genetic testing. The study aimed to describe the frequency with which patients choose one of several panel options or to decline genetic testing, and to identify variables that may predict patient choice (Emmet et al, submitted). One goal of this survey project was to identify values-based assessments that could be used in the development of our DA.\n3. Prototype Development\nThe design steps above resulted in the development of interactive educational content and\nvalues-clarification sections that reviewed and reinforced information while encouraging users to make\nShannon et al, Page | 10\na decision. Patient responses were compiled into a summary patients could opt to have emailed to them before they exited the DA. Videos of genetic counselors explaining key concepts were produced by an outside vendor. Audio \u201ctestimonials\u201d of patients discussing their decision-making process and representing diverse decisions were obtained. The HCC developed easy to understand graphics illustrating cancer risk and other genetic testing concepts. Users of the DA were able to move through the decision aid sequentially, access optional in-depth content, skip or return to specific sections, or jump to the \u201cchoose a genetic testing panel,\u201d based on their personal preferences, level of knowledge, and readiness to decide. Users could also add questions and comments as they moved through the DA, which were then compiled in the downloadable summary.\n4. Alpha testing and project team review\nTo refine the prototype, we conducted alpha testing with PFAC members and genetic counselor\nproject members. Each PFAC member met individually with a member of HCC who used a semistructured interview guide to gather information on the readability, relevance, and acceptability of the decision aid as the PFAC member navigated through the tool. Each genetic counselor project member tested the decision aid and provided feedback on readability, relevance, and acceptability. In addition, we informally had 8 lay people navigate the decision aid and provide feedback on readability and acceptability. The iterative process of revising the DA was overseen by a multidisciplinary steering committee consisting of the project team and the HCC team."

The focus group was audio recorded and transcribed. The PFAC\nShannon et al, Page | 11\ncontributions to the future DA development included ideas on readability, the ratio of text and video content, and key messages (e.g., impact on family).\nThe key educational content was ascertained from the genetic counselor team members. The\ncontent underwent four revisions by three genetic counselors on the project team before being sent to HCC for plain language support. The topics can be seen in Figure 4 with brief descriptions of content type.\nWhen surveying the genetic counselors regarding current practice issues, 12 CCRA genetic\ncounselors responded to an anonymous survey. Common themes were identified and categorized. Most genetic counselors (10/12) started the discussion about panel size with a description of targeted genetic testing and then expanded to include broad genetic testing panel options. One genetic counselor reported discussing the broadest panel first and then \u2018worked backwards\u2019 to the targeted panel, and one genetic counselor discussed a broad panel as a reflex option in the context of a negative targeted panel. When asked for strategies for facilitating patient decision-making, genetic counselors most commonly explored how the patient dealt with uncertainty (8/12); how the patient felt about getting an unexpected but clinically relevant finding (5/12) and if the patient would describe themselves as an \u2018information seeker\u2019 (4/12). Other strategies included exploring if the patient found medical information particularly anxiety provoking, if they were someone who needed to know the \u2019latest and greatest\u2019, if they could compartmentalize information well, and if they were comfortable with information changing over time. Finally, when asked \u2018why wouldn\u2019t I do a broad panel?\u2019, genetic counselors most often cited three patient perspectives: 1. Some people didn\u2019t like uncertainty (6/12); 2. Some patients were concerned about a higher rate of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result in the broad panel (6/12); and 3. Some patients only wanted information relevant to their current circumstances (5/12). These genetic counselor survey responses informed the educational components in the DA (fig 2) and in some of the text used to describe the risks and benefits of different panel types.\nShannon et al, Page | 12\nOur patient survey study (Partners Healthcare IRB Protocol #2019P000342) was designed to\nexplore patient choice between a full spectrum of multi-gene panel options (Emmet et al, submitted). It examined factors associated with the selection of a specific multi-gene panel test by patients when undergoing pre-test education and informed consent with a genetic counselor. The study confirmed the importance of patient choice, provided insight into the distribution of patients\u2019 preferences for testing, and supported the idea that a decision aid may be helpful to facilitate informed decision-making."

            "text": "The full tool is available at https://mghcancergeneticsda.com/. The project team organized the\ninformation into two major sections: 1) deciding about genetic testing (yes/no) and 2) deciding which panel type (ovarian cancer, common cancer, broad cancer). Each major heading is followed by educational points that expand in an \u2018accordion\u2019 style to provide additional context. Provider videos support the learning process and patient quotes are used to provide insight into the patient experience with genetic testing.\nThe learning process focuses first on the decision to have genetic testing (versus not having\ngenetic testing) and includes value statements that the user rates on a 7-point Likert scale. The user is then prompted to decide if they would like to proceed with genetic testing. If the user decides they do not want genetic testing, they can either end the DA tool or continue to learn more about testing options. The user can also indicate they are not ready to decide about genetic testing. If this is the case, they are asked if they would like to speak with their oncologist, speak with a genetic counselor, or take some time to think about it. Finally, if the user decides to proceed with testing, they are guided through the second educational aspect of the DA: education and decision-making regarding which gene panel to pursue. Users are provided with the three testing options, including the limitations and benefits of each panel type (Figure 1). Once the education is completed, the patient is prompted to choose one of three tests. The final education section of the tool provides testing logistics and next steps (e.g., getting a\nShannon et al, Page | 13\nblood draw, turnaround time of test). Once the DA is completed (whether a test is chosen), the user receives summative guidance about which decision they have made and can email it to themselves for their records."

PFAC members suggested changes-based acceptability and readability. Changes to the the decision aid because of the PFAC testing included adding of a \u2018welcome screen\u2019 at the outset of the DA, moving the navigation bar to the top of the screen and the creating additional \u2018accordion\u2019 buttons to reduce the amount of text on a page. Changes to readability included removing redundant text and labeling statistical information more clearly.\nThe eight lay people who navigated the decision aid and all agreed the content was relevant and\nreadable, but suggested text modifications to reduce redundancy. Modifications were made to the navigation based on their feedback, including the addition of a \u2018back\u2019 button to return to a previous page or section, and a re-design of the \u2018accordion\u2019 feature to make it more readable.\nThe genetic counselor project team members identified minor navigation concerns (e.g., when\nclicking a button, it did not skip to the correct location) which were rectified with programming."

            "text": "We describe the development of a decision aid for multigene panel cancer genetic testing that\nfacilitates informed decision-making by patients. The distinctive feature of this decision aid is its ability to tackle the intricate task of facilitating selection of the most suitable multigene panel test, a challenge that has been widely recognized in the medical community. As noted in a recent review by Tung et al. (2021), the increasing number of available multigene panel tests has created a significant dilemma for clinicians, who struggle to identify the most appropriate option for each patient's unique clinical\nShannon et al, Page | 14\nscenario. This decision aid tool offers a comprehensive and personalized approach to guide clinicians towards a more informed and evidence-based decision-making process.\nThe educational content of the decision aid underwent several revisions, and patient surveys\nwere conducted to explore factors associated with the selection of a specific multigene panel test. A patient survey study performed during the development process showed that while large panels were common, testing choice was distributed across different panel options and was difficult to predict (Emmet et al., submitted). This highlights the importance of patient choice and the need for a decision aid to facilitate informed decision-making.\nThe alpha testing phase included feedback from patient and family advisory council (PFAC)\nmembers and genetic counselor project team members. PFAC members provided significant feedback resulting in major navigation and content changes. Minor navigation concerns were identified by the genetic counselors, and rectified, and lay people navigated the decision aid and suggested no changes. This feedback indicates that the decision aid is user-friendly and can be used by a wide range of patients.\nThe tool has certain limitations that should be noted. First, decision aids may not be appropriate\nfor all patients, particularly those with complex medical histories or co-morbidities (Finch et al., 2021). Further, our decision aid is currently available in only one language and designed for a specific disease population, namely ovarian cancer. It is worth noting that plans are in place to address these limitations. Consistent with research by Yu et al. (2020) which highlights the importance of considering cultural and linguistic factors when developing decision aids for diverse patient populations, we will be translating the tool into multiple languages. In addition, we will be broadening its applicability to other cancer types.\nShannon et al, Page | 15\nIn conclusion, the decision aid developed in this study has the potential to facilitate informed\ndecision-making by patients regarding cancer genetic testing. The decision aid's effectiveness and impact on patient decision-making will be evaluated in future studies to validate its utility."
