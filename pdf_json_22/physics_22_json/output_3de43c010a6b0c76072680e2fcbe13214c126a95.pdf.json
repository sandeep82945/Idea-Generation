    "abstractText": "The tropospheric tomography is an ill-posed inversion problem due to the sparsity of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations and the limitation on the projection angles of GNSS signals, which in turn affects the stability and robustness of the tomographic solution. To address this, a new tomographic algorithm, named two-step projected iterative algorithm (TSPIA), is proposed. The wet refractivity (WR) field was constructed in two steps: first, an iterative preprocessing for the initial input values was performed, then its resultant solution was input into the projected iterative method, in which a hypothesis convex set was constructed to constrain the reconstruction based on the classical algebraic iterative reconstruction (AIR) methods. In addition, a two-dimensional normalized cumulative periodogram (2D-NCP) termination criterion was investigated since the traditional criteria for judging the convergence of iterations use pre-fixed empirical thresholds, which may lead to excessive iterations and need complicated work. The TSPIA was tested using GNSS data in Hong Kong over a wet period and a dry period. Statistical results showed that, compared to the classical AIR methods, the accuracy of the reconstructed WR field of the TSPIA were improved by about 10% and 15% when radiosonde and ECMWF data were used as the reference, respectively. Moreover, experiments for the proposed 2D-NCP criterion demonstrated noticeable computational efficiency. These results suggest that the new approaches proposed in this study can improve the performance of the iterative methods for GNSS tropospheric tomography.",

INTRODUCTION ATER vapor, one of the most important components in the atmosphere, affects various atmospheric processes [1], [2]. Water vapor data with high\naccuracy and high temporal resolution play a vital role in weather forecasting, atmospheric modeling, disaster prevention and mitigation, and environment pollution monitoring [3]\u2212[7]. Over the last two decades, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) tropospheric tomography technique has gradually become a powerful technique for reconstructing three dimensional (3D) water vapor fields with both high spatial and\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant Nos. 41874040, 41730109), by the Jiangsu Dual Creative Talents and Jiangsu Dual Creative Teams Program Projects awarded in 2017, by the Assistance Program for Future Outstanding Talents of China University of Mining and Technology and by the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (Corresponding author: Kefei Zhang).\ntemporal resolutions predominantly due to the advantages of low cost, high accuracy, and all-weather availability of the GNSS measurements. This technique was first realized by Flores [8] and Champollion et al. [9], and since then many studies and experiments on tropospheric tomography in various regions have been carried out [10]\u2212[14]. However, unlike conventional computed tomography used in the medical field, for tropospheric tomography, GNSS data are often insufficient due to the sparse and uneven distribution of local continuously operating reference stations (CORS) networks and the limited number of GNSS satellites observed [15]. As a result, tropospheric tomography typically involves solving an illposed inverse problem, and tropospheric tomography modeling is still challenging for practical applications [16].\nTo solve the above mentioned ill-posed inverse problem, various tomographic methods have been proposed by scholars around the world, among which the algebraic iterative reconstruction (AIR) methods have been widely used [11], [17]\u2212[19] for their advantages of avoiding complicated matrix inversion and saving computational cost. The two types of the AIR methods are sequential and simultaneous versions, namely algebraic reconstruction techniques (ARTs) [20] and simultaneous iterative reconstruction techniques (SIRTs) [21]. Some improved iterative algorithms have also been proposed for atmospheric tomography. For example, Wen [22] proposed an improved algebraic reconstruction technique (IART) and Yao [23] developed an adaptive simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (ASIRT), in which the electron density of the voxels was introduced into the correction. Xia [24] presented a combined reconstruction algorithm (CRA), in which a priori water vapor information derived from COSMIC radio occultation (RO) data was employed as initial values of the IART. For the voxels that have no rays crossing, Gaussian filters [25], [26], Laplace operators [27], [28] and the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation [29] etc methods were usually used to smooth the voxels. Some researchers applied the total variation method to reconstruct iterative regularized solutions with promising results [30], [31].\nThe projected iterative method is also effective for solving\nS.

Such constraints incorporate a priori knowledge of the solution, typically leading to a better tomographic result [32], [33]. Applications of the projected iterative methods in seismology, image restoration, electromagnetic tomography and gravity fields can be found in [34]\u2212[37]. In particular, the projected methods are used as non-negativity constraints for the unknown parameters to be solved in the atmospheric tomography [31].\nAlthough the feasibility of the above algorithms has been verified, the ill-posed problem of tropospheric tomography in the inversion process is a core issue and still requires further investigation. The performance of the iterative methods relies heavily on the selection of the initial values for the unknown parameters [25], [38], which are obtained mainly from empirical values or a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, e.g. the standard atmosphere [26], radiosonde data [10], [39] and global forecast products (GFS) produced by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) [11], [18], [40]. The accuracy of the empirical values is usually low due to the large spatio-temporal variation in water vapor distribution (as shown in 5.3 section), and as a result, it often leads to uneven tomographic solutions. Some researchers also applied the results from non-iterative methods as the initial values, e.g. from the least squares method [19] and COSMIC RO data [24]. However, the temporal resolution of the data other than GNSS is usually lower than GNSS data, which cannot support the realtime need for GNSS tropospheric tomography. Moreover, there are some difficulties for the least squares estimation in the determination of the weights of the observations and the determination of the inversion of the projection matrix which is time consuming. Another issue needing to be addressed is the selection of appropriate criteria for the termination of the iteration to ensure both computational efficiency and desired accuracy of the solution. The two main types of criteria used in previous studies include: the back-projection technique, i.e. the iteration will be terminated when the reconstructed data are close to the observation data (meaning small residuals); if the difference between the fields of the unknown parameters over the current (e.g. kth) and previous (k\u22121th) iterations is below the pre-defined threshold, the procedure will be terminated [11], [24], [25], [30]. However, for the discrete ill-posed problem, small residuals from the back projection do not necessarily signify a good tomographic solution [41] (also shown in Fig. 5). The determination of the empirical thresholds is usually complicated with unstable solutions.\nIn this paper, the inversion algorithm is examined to solve the above problems. First, the projected iterative methods based on ART, SIRT and their improved versions \u2212 IART and ASIRT are realized. In these projected methods, it is assumed that the solution must belong to a convex set, and the hypothetical convex set is simulated by ERA5 data to constrain the voxels in each iteration. Then, a two-step projected iterative algorithm (TSPIA) that includes preprocessing for the initial values, which will be used as the input of the projected iterative method subsequently, is presented. In addition, the semi-convergence\nproperty of the iterative methods in tropospheric tomography is examined, and strategies for the determination of the relaxation parameters used in the (projected) ART and SIRT methods are provided. Moreover, a two-dimensional (2D) normalized cumulative periodogram (2D-NCP) iterative termination criterion, which processes the observation signals in groups, is introduced for tropospheric tomography. To evaluate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, tomographic experiments using GNSS data from the Hong Kong continuously operating reference stations (CORS) network during a wet and a dry periods were performed. The water vapor fields reconstructed from the new iterative methods and also some existing iterative methods for the comparisons of different methods are validated using radiosonde profiles and ERA5 data as the two references."

The tropospheric delay is commonly divided into two components: the hydrostatic delay caused by the neutral hydrostatic atmosphere and the wet delay due to the water vapor. Unlike the ionospheric delay, which can be well cancelled out from an ionospheric-free combination of simultaneous duel-frequency observations, the tropospheric delay needs to be estimated. In GPS data processing, the tropospheric delay along the signal path is typically mapped to the zenith direction (zenith tropospheric delay, ZTD) of the station to reduce the number of the unknown parameters to be estimated, which avoids the rank deficiency of the observation equation system. The ZTD can be also divided into zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delay (ZWD). The ZHD can be obtained from an empirical model, e.g. the Saastamoinen model [42], with a high accuracy. The ZWD can be calculated by subtracting the ZHD from the ZTD which is estimated from GNSS data processing:\nZWD = ZTD - ZHD . (1) However, the ZWD, as the total value along the vertical direction, cannot reflect the vertical distribution of water vapor. To reconstruct the wet refractivity (WR) field from a tropospheric tomography, the ZWD needs to be mapped to the direction of the slant wet delay (SWD) along the signal ray path as the input observation of the tomography, which can be written as SWD [ZWD ( )]w N E= m +cot G cos +G sin +\u03b5 \u03d5 \u03d5 \u03b4 (2) where wm is the wet mapping function; NG and EG are the slant delay gradient parameters in the northern and eastern directions, respectively; \u03b5 and \u03d5 are the elevation angle and geographic latitude, respectively; \u03b4 is the post-fit phase residual.\nBy definition, SWD is the integral of the WR along the signal path [43]: 6SWD 10 ws N ds \u2212= \u222b (3)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The geometric path delay caused by the bending of the ray is generally neglected and thus \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 is assumed to be a straight line [44].\nEquation (3) can be resolved by discretizing the tomographic region into small 3D voxels as SWD AX\u2248 (4) where SWD, the observation vector of the tomography, is calculated by (2); A denotes the projection matrix, which is determined by the structure of the voxels and the length of the signals crossing through the voxels; and X is the unknown WR parameters vector of all the voxels. The WR in each voxel is assumed to be homogeneous and the WR value is fixed during the period of the tomography.\nEquation (4) defines a large linear equations system with noise, which is ill-posed and overdetermined. Solutions of such a system are often non-unique and unstable, and small changes in the input values of the system may cause large perturbations in the solutions."

It avoids the inversion of a large projection matrix and saves computational cost, which is ideal for solving large-scale problems. In this section, the classical ART and SIRT methods, as well as their improved versions IART and ASIRT are examined.\nThe classical ART algorithm, also known as the Kaczmarz method [45], treats one observation signal at a time during the iterations. Its formula can be expressed as\n2 1 1 (SWD ), 1,2, ,n nk+1 k kj j k ij ij i ijj jx = x a a a x i m\u03bb = =+ \u2212 =\u2211 \u2211  (5)\nwhere kjx denotes the WR value of the jth voxel in the kth iteration; n is the number of the columns of the observation equations, i.e., the number of the unknown parameters; ija is the element in the ith row and jth column of the coefficient matrix; m is the number of the observation equations; and k\u03bb is the relaxation parameter, which is usually a constant value and must satisfy 0 2k\u03bb< < . Based on ART, Wen [22] proposed the IART method, in which the correction factor\n2 1 nk ij k ij ijj w a a\u03bb =\n= \u2211 in (5) is replaced with 2\n1 nk k k ij k ij j ij jj w a x a x\u03bb =\n= \u2211 . \uff086\uff09 In this method, the WR value estimated in the previous iteration is also taken into account in the correction factor.\nThe SIRT methods utilize all equations simultaneously in the correction factor to avoid the effect of the order of the observation equations on the solution. These \u201csimultaneous\u201d methods can be written in the general form as\n1 TDA M(SWD A )k k kkx = x x\u03bb + + \u2212 (7)\nwhere T0 (DA MA)k\u03bb \u03c1< < , ( )\u03c1 \u22c5 is the spectral radius; while D and M are two symmetric positive definite matrices.

Similarly, if kijw is the same as that expressed in (6), then the equation is for ASIRT [23].\nC. Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) Interpolation As mentioned previously, some voxels may not be crossed by any rays during the period of time of the tomography, mainly due to the sparseness of the ground GNSS stations and poor distribution of the GNSS satellites in view. The WR values in these voxels cannot be corrected by the iterative methods but remain the initial values. Therefore, we applied the IDW interpolation method to cope with this problem [29]. The general form of IDW is\n0 1 1 1S Si i i\ni i\nxx d d= =\n= \u2211 \u2211 (9) where 0x is the WR value of the voxel interpolated for; ix is the WR value of the voxel corrected by rays; id is the distance between the voxel interpolated for and the voxel corrected by nearby passing through rays; S is the total number of the voxels corrected by rays.\nIII.

Due to some degrees of temporal and spatial regularities in the water vapor variation, it was assumed that the WR values within the same voxel in the same month but in different years obey a normal distribution. Therefore, the hypothetical convex set expressed by (10) can be simulated based on the historical WR data from hourly ERA5 during the month the same as the tomographic month but in the previous year. To obtain the ERA5 WR at each tomographic voxel, the IDW interpolation was applied for the vertical direction (i.e. the voxels in the same vertical column) and the bilinear interpolation was applied for the horizontal domain (i.e. the voxels in the same height layer). The upper and lower bounds for the jth voxel can be expressed as\n3 3 j j j j j j l mean std u mean std = \u2212  = + (14)\nwhere jmean and jstd are the mean and standard deviation of the WR values of the month in the jth voxel.

            "text": "In this section, the TSPIA which was based on the box constraints expressed by a convex set, is elaborated. First, the preprocessing for determining the initial values of the WR fields is performed. These values are cyclically adjusted, according to the convex set and the observations; then its result is input into the projected iterative method and iteratively improved.\nIn the first step of the preprocessing, to quantitatively evaluate the availability of the initial values, two parameters Cn and Ch are defined in the inversion, where P-ART with one iteration is used as the inversion method. Cn denotes the ratio of the number of box-constrained corrections to the number of the observations, while the vector Ch is the number of boxconstrained corrections at each layer. It should be noted that, if the input initial values are relatively close to their truth values, then the solution is hardly be corrected by the box constraints. Moreover, more attention needs to be paid to anomalous solutions near the ground layers rather than high-altitude voxels in the inversion, since in high-altitude layers the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the box constraints is relatively small, but the correction in ART determined by the intercepts of the signals is large. Thus some corrections in the high-altitude grids do not imply that the initial values are poor.\nThe preprocessing for the initial values consists of two loops:\nan inner loop and an outer loop, which are similar to ART. The inner loop is for processing all the voxels at each height layer and the outer loop is for all integrations. Within the inner loop, all the voxels at the current height layer are processed in one go, and different schemes for the initial values are input into PART. The scheme that results in the smallest is considered optimal, and thus to be incorporated into the next layer. When the processing for all height layers is completed, the outer loop starts the next iteration. More details for this process are as follows.\n1) Initialize the following parameters: the time of the maximum iteration nmaxk and the number of the iterations nk in the outer loop; the iterative step delta in the inner loop; the iterative relaxation factor \u03c9 for PART; the initial value vector 0X , which is assigned to the mean of the historical radiosonde data within the 3- day time window before the tomographic epoch. 2) Inner loop processing. a) Calculate two sets of initial values 1X and 2X for\neach voxel based on 0X . For example, if the current processing is for the kth layer, then assign all the voxels of this layer to 1 0i iX X delta= \u2212 , 2 0i iX X delta= + ; whilst for all voxels in the other layers, assign 1 0i iX X= and 2 0i iX X= , where i denotes the index of the voxel.\nb) Input different schemes ( 0X , 1X and 2X ) into the P-ART algorithm as the initial values with one iteration and calculate their corresponding Cn and Ch . c) Select the optimal scheme from different schemes by comparing their resultant Cn values; then the result from the optimal scheme is used as the new initial value vector 0X to be incorporated into the next layer. Repeat the above steps a)-c) until all the layers are\nprocessed. Then output the current 0X and assign the number of the outer loop iteration 1n nk k= + . For the tests carried out in this study, the related parameter\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The\niteration will terminate if either the processed 0X is as desired or the pre-defined value for the number of the iterations is satisfied. In this study, when correction made by box constraints takes place only in the top grids and the times of the corrections is sufficiently small (e.g. Cn < 0.05 was adopted in this study), the initial value would be regarded fine. In addition, the order of the height layers in the inner loop is taken as following: Initially, we set the inner loop order from low to high layers (k = 1, 2\u22ef 10), and if the output 0X from three consecutive iterations were stable, then we randomly set the order of the height layers in the inner loop.\nNext, the solution resulting from step 1) will be used as the input of the projected iterative methods, and different projected iterative algorithms lead to different forms of TSPIA. These will be discussed in the following sections."

The accuracy of the solution improves first but then becomes degraded during the iteration process, instead of showing instead of asymptotic convergence. The studies on the semi-convergence theory of the iterative methods and their projected versions can be found in [33], [47]\u2212[49].\nIn this section, the semi-convergence mechanism of the iterative methods for the water vapor tomography system SWD AX\u2248 is analyzed with the notations defined as:\nSWD , r , A ,\n, SWD SWD.\nb R R esidual b x dummy vector\nx exact solution exact\n= + = = =\n= = (16)\nR is the essential factor of the semi-convergence behavior, which can be explained by two components 1R and 2R as follows:\n1 2\nSWD = SWD A\n(SWD SWD) (SWD A ) .\nR b x\nx R R\n= \u2212 \u2212\n= \u2212 + \u2212 = +\n(17)\n1R represents the uncertainty of the SWD estimated from GNSS data, which mainly includes the uncertainty of the ZTD and the satellite\u2019s elevation [50]. While 2R is mainly composed of the discretization error and the error from the assumption that the signal path is a straight line in (4).\nTo further illustrate the semi-convergence mechanism, the reconstructed difference kx x\u2212 in the kth iteration is divided into two parts [47]:\n( ) ( ) k kk kx x x x x x\u2212 = \u2212 + \u2212 (18)\nwhere the iteration vector k\nx corresponds to the R-free dummy vector Ab x= . First part denotes the iteration error, which gradually decreases with iteration and is similar to asymptotic convergence theory. Second part represents the noise error, which is due to the presence of R and tends to increase with iteration. Whether the semi-convergence is apparent depends on how fast this part increases. Fig. 2 shows the variation in the root mean square error (RMSE) of different iterative methods applied in water vapor tomography with the number of iterations. These numerical examples clearly demonstrate semiconvergence behaviors. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, when the input value of the tomographic system is the dummy vector b , the method exhibits asymptotic converge with iteration, where x was simulated based on ERA5 data. In addition, different iterative methods and different relaxation parameters lead to different semi-convergence behaviors. As we can see, ART reaches the optimal point in a fewer iterations compared with SIRT, and the larger the relaxation parameter, the more obvious the semi-convergence."

In this section, the strategies for the selection of the relaxation parameter for the (projected) SIRT and the (projected) ART methods are provided.\nFor the (projected) SIRT methods, their optimal accuracy is almost independent on \u03bb (except in the case that it is close to the maximum allowed), which can be seen in Fig. 2(a) and (b). This means that a large but not too close to the maximum allowed value can be selected for \u03bb to improve computational efficiency. The \u201c 2\u03c8 -strategy\u201d [33] , a step-size decreasing strategy, was used in this study for controlling the noise error.\nFor the (projected) ART methods, the relationship between \u03bb and the solution accuracy is much more complicated. First, for the classical ART method, the smaller the \u03bb value, the better the optimal accuracy, as shown in Fig. 4(a). However, a too small \u03bb value is likely to cause slow convergence; thus a balance between the accuracy and efficiency of the solution needs to be considered. It is recommended that a small but not too small constant value for \u03bb (e.g. \u03bb=0.05 was adopted in this study) for the classical ART method. However, this rule may be changed for some epochs for the P-ART method, where a larger \u03bb value is likely to result in a better solution, as shown in Fig. 4(b). This is because the added constraints can restrain the accumulation of the errors in the tomographic solution during the iterations, particularly for a large \u03bb value. Another reason for the change of the rule is related to the structure of the initial values for the unknown parameters. Fig. 4(c) shows the variation in the RMSE of the projected ART with the number of iterations after the initial values obtained from preprocessing were applied, which is similar to the classical ART method.\nof iterations and each selected constant \u03bb value at 12:00 UTC, DOY 168, 2020.

            "text": "There are none of universal standards for the termination criterial of an iteration used in the AIR methods. For a reasonable criterion, both computational efficiency and solution accuracy need to be taken into account. As mentioned above, in previous studies the back-projection technique is commonly used as the termination criterion. Some statistical parameters for the residual vector SWD A, kkr x= \u2212 , e.g. the average\nvalue (AVE) and RMS, are often used to indicate the convergence behavior and the accuracy of the reconstruction [11], [24], [25], [40]. Their formulas are:\n1\n2 1\n1AVE (SWD A , )\n1RMS [(SWD A , ) ] 1\nm k i ii\nm k i ii\nx m\nx m\n=\n=  = \u2212   = \u2212 \u2212 \u2211 \u2211 . (19)\nThe iteration can be terminated if the back projection A , ki x\nis close to the observation data, i.e. the RMS or AVE is smaller than the pre-set threshold. Another way is to compare the state vector kx between consecutive iterations \u2212 if the difference of the unknown parameters between several consecutive iterations is under the pre-set threshold, then the iterative procedure is terminated.\nHowever, for the discrete ill-posed problems, a small residual does not signify a good solution due to the semi-convergence property [41]. It can be seen in Fig. 2(a) and (c) and Fig. 5 that the residual does not accurately reflect the variation in the accuracy of the solution. The RMS of the SIRT and ART residuals gradually decreases and remains stable with the number of iterations, while the accuracy of the two methods enhances first but then deteriorates during the iterations. Moreover, it is not easy to select a reasonable empirical threshold as its performance may be unstable.\nThe semi-convergence of the iterative methods used to determine the termination criteria also needs to be considered. Many rules for the selection of parameters for inverse problems can be used as the termination rules for the AIR methods. For example, the normalized cumulative periodogram (NCP) criterion [53], [54], which treats the residual vector as a time series, and when it is sufficiently close to white noise, then the iteration can be terminated. Although the NCP rule has been applied in water vapor tomography by He et al. [55], it may be\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

For the system SWD AX\u2248 , if the solution is close to the truth, kr will be close to R (see (16)), rather than white noise. From the analysis in section 3.3, different ground stations and different elevation angles result in different R values. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between the mean of the R values from different elevation angles and different ground stations at a single epoch. Fig. 7 shows the scatter diagram of the R values over the wet period studied. Clear distinction can be observed in the positive and negative property and magnitude between the R values of different stations, and at the same station the R value decreases with the increase in the elevation angle.\nAccording to the software package in [47], a 2D-NCP termination rule for tropospheric tomography is proposed. In this rule, the SWD and kr vectors are reorganized into p subvectors (see equation (20) below), depending on the source of the signals, due to the correlation between the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 value and the ground GNSS station:\n1 1\n2 2\nSWD SWD\nSWD= , =\nSWD\nk\nk k\nk P p\nr r\nr\nr                       (20)\nwhere p denotes the number of all subvectors, and each\nsubvector corresponds to a single projection. Moreover, in this study the rays with elevation angles less than 30 degrees were excluded from the use in the determination of the iteration termination, due to their large R values and low accuracy. Then the mean of the deviation of each subvector from white noise was calculated to measure the deviation of kr , and when the mean of the deviations reaches the minimum point the iteration will be terminated.

Validation of 2D-NCP Termination Rule The ART and SIRT methods, and their projected versions were tested using data during the wet period studied to illustrate\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n4 > REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR MANUSCRIPT ID NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <\nthe advantages of using the termination rule from the 2D-NCP. To visualize the performances of the termination criteria, the ratio of the number of the iterations determined by the termination criteria to the number of the iterations that results in the best accuracy ( /rule optK K ), and its corresponding RMSE ratio ( /rule optRMSE RMSE ) were calculated, for which ERA5 data were selected as the reference. Ideally, both ratios are close to 1. If / 1rule optK K < , the termination is too early, otherwise too late. Furthermore, if the /rule optRMSE RMSE is too large, then the termination criterion is not well effective. As seen in Fig. 8, most of the data points are located within the interval 0 / 1rule optK K< < , indicating that the 2D-NCP criterion does not have the risk of taking too many iterations.\nFor the (projected) ART method, the termination criterion given by Xia [24] called TRA was also selected for a comparison, and the maximum iterative number was set to 200. The TRA rule defines that the iteration terminates when the difference of the RMSs (see (19)) between the kth and k+1th iterations is under 0.001mm. As we can see in Fig. 9(a) and (b), the advantages of the accuracy and computational efficiency of 2D-NCP are noticeable, and 2D-NCP also avoids complex work on the selection of empirical thresholds.\nFor the (projected) SIRT method, the termination criterion given by Zhang et al.[39] , which it is named TRA2 here, was selected for a comparison. Based on TRA2, the iteration will terminate when the standard deviation (STD) of the RMSs in five consecutive iterations is under 0.0016 mm, or the times of the iterations reaches 1000. Fig. 9(c) and (d) shows the comparison of the performances of the two criteria defined by TRA2 and 2D-NCP. It can be seen that the 2D-NCP criterion leads to a slightly lower accuracy but a much better computational efficiency. This suggests that it is more suitable for a near real-time mode.\nC. Validation and Analysis of TSPIA Experiments for performance evaluations of different AIR methods were carried out for the evaluation of the stability and superiority of TSPIA. The related parameters were set as follows. The maximum times of iterations was set to 500 with \u03bb = 2\u03c8 -strategy for the SIRT methods. The maximum times of iterations was set to 200 with \u03bb = 0.05 for the ART methods. Moreover, the 2D-NCP termination criterion was used for all scenarios. It is noted that the ASIRT algorithm with \u03bb = 2\u03c8 - strategy did not converge at some epochs during the dry period studied. Instead, a 0.5 step size and the data range 0 < \u03bb < 10 were set to search the optimal relaxation parameter value. The \u03bb value that led to the minimum RMSE during the dry period studied was selected for ASIRT.\nFig. 10 illustrates water vapor vertical profiles derived from different algorithms and radiosonde (RS) on rainy and rainless days during the wet and dry periods, respectively. The water vapor profiles represent the WR values along the column of the voxels that is co-located with the radiosonde station.

It can be seen that the WR profiles obtained by the proposed algorithms agree well with the RS profiles and better than that of the conventional algorithms on the both rainy and rainless days selected.\nTo quantitatively compare the WR retrievals of different tomographic methods, the mean of the RMSEs of WR from different algorithms for each epoch were calculated (Fig. 11), and radiosonde data were used as the reference although the data at some epochs missed. The figure shows that the tomographic results from TSPIA are more accurate than that of the conventional methods at almost all epochs. Moreover, the TSPIA can correct those abnormal results effectively, compared with the traditional algorithms, and maintain good stability, as shown in Fig. 11. Statistical parameters including RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE), and bias of the tomographic results are listed in Table 3. One can see that the mean RMSE of ART during the wet and dry periods are 7.52 mm/km and 9.22 mm/km, respectively; while that of the TSPART are 6.79 mm/km and 8.01 mm/km, with accuracy\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

And the mean RMSE over the two periods reduces from 8.34 mm/km and 8.71 mm/km of IART to 7.30 mm/km and 7.83 mm/km of TSPIART, which is equivalent to the improvement rates of 12.47 % and 10.10 %, respectively.\nBesides, the mean of the RMSEs at all altitudes over the radiosonde station during each of the two periods is shown in Fig. 12. It is noticed that although the performance of IART well improves at high altitudes in comparison with ART, which updates corrections according to the WR obtained from the previous iteration, it may also magnify the effect of the errors in the solution at low layers. In contrast, the proposed TSPIA has a better accuracy and better stability at almost all layers. Moreover, in the tomographic layers from 0 to 2 km, the RMSE\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Compared with the dry period, the RMSEs of TSP-ART and ART during the wet period decrease by 1.22 mm/km and 1.7 mm/km, respectively. This may be because the vertical distribution of water vapor during a wet period is more even and the spatio-temporal variation is more stable than that of a dry period. The tomographic results will be adversely affected if there are fluctuations in water vapor distribution with time and space [13], [56]. Furthermore, the water vapor distribution during the dry period does not show an exponential decrease with height at some epochs and even possibly has an inverse increase trend near the surface, as shown in Fig. 10 and 13. More drastic temporal and spatial variations of water vapor makes the effect of empirical initial values of the WR fields on\nthe tomographic solutions more unstable. Therefore, the TSPIA is advantageous during the dry period since it uses the initial values obtained from preprocessing rather than empirical values.\nTo better visualize the 3D water vapor distribution improved by the proposed method, the RMSE of each voxel over each of the wet and dry periods from different algorithms is shown in Fig. 14, and ERA5 data were used as the reference. We can see that the results of TSPIA agree better with the WR fields from ERA5 data than that of the conventional algorithms, and the abnormal solutions that are from the conventional algorithms are effectively improved by TSPIA.\nThe RMSE of the WR values of all voxels on each day from different algorithms for comparison is shown in Fig. 15, where the improvement made by TPSIA is evident. Table 4 shows the statistical results of all voxels during each of the two periods from each method with the ERA5 data as reference. It can be seen that the RMSEs over the wet and dry periods reduce from 7.07 mm/km and 8.73 mm/km of ART to 5.92 mm/km and 7.32 mm/km of TSP-ART, respectively, equivalent to the accuracy\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

All these results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

The ART methods were used for illustration with ERA5 data as the reference, and the other experiments setting was the same as that in section 5.3. Fig. 16 shows the RMSE of the WR values of all voxels from different algorithms and from different additional noise values added to the tomographic observations. It can be found that the proposed algorithms still significantly outperform the other two methods, and with the increase in noise, its RMSE increases (i.e. its accuracy deteriorates) smaller than the traditional methods, especially during the wet period.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "A new method for GNSS tropospheric tomography - TSPIA was proposed in this study through which a hypothesis convex set was constructed to constrain the reconstruction in the iterations, and instead of using empirical initial values for the WR field, the initial values obtained from data preprocessing were used in tomographic system. In addition, the feature of convergence and iterative termination criteria of the AIR methods were investigated, and the 2D-NCP criterion for water vapor tomography was applied.\nThe TSPIA was validated using GNSS data from the Hong Kong CORS network over both wet and dry periods, and radiosonde and ERA5 data were used as two references. Experimental results showed that TSPIA outperformed the traditional AIR algorithms over the selected periods, and the abnormal solutions that were from the traditional algorithms were effectively improved by TSPIA. Taking the ART methods as an example, the RMSEs of WR of all voxels during the wet and the dry periods reduce from 7.52 mm/km and 9.22 mm/km of ART to 6.79 mm/km and 8.01 mm/km of TSP-ART when radiosonde were used as the reference; these values were 7.07 mm/km and 8.73 mm/km of ART to 5.92 mm/km and 7.32 mm/km of TSP-ART when ERA5 data were used as the reference. The above results are equivalent to an improvement of 9.71% and 13.12% (using radiosonde), as well as 16.27% and 16.15% (using ERA5 data) respectively. An experiment for the investigation of the performance of the TSPIA with additional various magnitudes of noise levels added to the tomographic observations was also carried out. Results demonstrated that TSPIA has better stability and accuracy than the traditional methods under all the noisy conditions. In addition, test results also illustrated that the introduced 2D-NCP criterion is advantageous in terms of both computational efficiency, compared to the conventional termination criteria, and avoidance of complex work on the determination of the threshold for the termination of the iterative process.\nOur future work will be investigating further improved methods and using more sources of data in the construction of a convex set, e.g. integrating some real-time external observations, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) [57], [58] etc. Their resultant tropospheric tomography is expected to be more accurate and have great potential to apply to weather monitoring and forecasting."
