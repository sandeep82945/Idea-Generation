    "abstractText": "The carrier-free chemo-photothermal therapy has become a promising strategy to improve anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy owing to the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, with improved chemotherapy drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, high drug loading, and reduced toxicity. We designed a novel carrier-free targeting nanoparticles, co-selfassembled amphiphilic prodrugs 3\u2032,5\u2032-dioleoyl gemcitabine (DOG), and tumortargeted \u03b3-octadecyl folate (MOFA), with encapsulated US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) for synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. The DOG linking oleic acid to the sugar moiety of gemcitabine (GEM) showed better self-assembly ability among GEM amphiphilic prodrugs linking different fatty acids. The readily available and highly reproducible 3\u2032,5\u2032-dioleoyl gemcitabine/\u03b3-octadecyl folate/indocyanine green (DOG/MOFA/ICG) nanoparticles were prepared by reprecipitation and showed nano-scale structure with mono-dispersity, great encapsulation efficiency of ICG (approximately 74%), acidand laser irradiation-triggered GEM release in vitro and sustained GEM release in vivo after intravenous administration as well as excellent temperature conversion (57.0\u00b0C) with nearinfrared laser irradiation. The combinational DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles with near-infrared laser irradiation showed better anti-tumor efficacy than individual chemotherapy or photothermal therapy, with very low hemolysis and inappreciable toxicity for L929 cells. This co-self-assembly of the ICG and the chemotherapy drug (GEM) provides a novel tactic for the rational design of multifunctional nanosystems for targeting drug delivery and theranostics.",

We designed a novel carrier-free targeting nanoparticles, co-selfassembled amphiphilic prodrugs 3\u2032,5\u2032-dioleoyl gemcitabine (DOG), and tumortargeted \u03b3-octadecyl folate (MOFA), with encapsulated US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) for synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. The DOG linking oleic acid to the sugar moiety of gemcitabine (GEM) showed better self-assembly ability among GEM amphiphilic prodrugs linking different fatty acids. The readily available and highly reproducible 3\u2032,5\u2032-dioleoyl gemcitabine/\u03b3-octadecyl folate/indocyanine green (DOG/MOFA/ICG) nanoparticles were prepared by reprecipitation and showed nano-scale structure with mono-dispersity, great encapsulation efficiency of ICG (approximately 74%), acid- and laser irradiation-triggered GEM release in vitro and sustained GEM release in vivo after intravenous administration as well as excellent temperature conversion (57.0\u00b0C) with nearinfrared laser irradiation. The combinational DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles with near-infrared laser irradiation showed better anti-tumor efficacy than individual chemotherapy or photothermal therapy, with very low hemolysis and inappreciable toxicity for L929 cells. This co-self-assembly of the ICG and the chemotherapy drug (GEM) provides a novel tactic for the rational design of multifunctional nanosystems for targeting drug delivery and theranostics.\nKEYWORDS\nco-self-assembly, carrier-free, gemcitabine, indocyanine green, chemophotothermal therapy\n1 Introduction\nCancer-related deaths are becoming a major global health problem (Siegel et al., 2021).

However, GEM\u2019s clinical applicability is hampered by its instability and short plasma half-life (Maiti et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017; Abdel-Rahman et al., 2018). Additionally, the rapid development of drug resistance makes a single agent unable to achieve satisfactory treatment in cancer cells (Xiao et al., 2012). As an alternative approach, the co-delivery of multifunctional nanoagents is promising for overcoming these problems and enhancing anticancer drug efficacy (Al-Lazikani et al., 2012; Meng et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022). It has been demonstrated that the co-delivery of photothermal agents and chemotherapeutic drugs can showmore sound therapeutic effects than the delivery of a single agent (Li et al., 2020b; Liang et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021). Tricarbocyanine dye ICG approved for clinical use by the FDA as a photothermal therapy dye can cause thermal ablation in tumor tissues by generating heat within near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation (Wang et al., 2017b; Ji et al., 2022). In addition, it may alter the permeability of cell membranes to accelerate drug release and synergistically enhance the drug cytotoxicity to cancer cells. For example, a multicomponent lipid nanoparticle which was made up of doxorubicin (DOX) attached ICG-loaded liposomes and carbon dots co-delivered chemotherapeutic drug DOX and ICG via carbon dots carrier. It significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis and death by enhancing tumor cell uptake of nanoparticles, elevating tumor site temperature and rapidly releasing DOX (Xue et al., 2018).\nUntil recently, co-delivery of multifunctional drugs has been made in various nano-sized carriers for encapsulating multiple agents and delivering them to cancer cells (Liang et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Ghitman et al., 2020). These nano-sized carriers are favorable to optimizing drug pharmacokinetics, increasing accumulation of drugs at tumor sites by the permeability and retention (EPR) effect or active target, thereby boosting the efficiency of treatment (Li et al., 2020a; Sandhiutami et al., 2020; Shakeran et al., 2021). However, it is difficult for chemotherapy drugs to attain antitumor effects only via passive targeting of the EPR effect of nanosystems. Thus, the active targeting ligands (such as cell-penetrating peptides, small molecules, or membranes from host cells) are used to improve tumor targeting (Cao et al., 2016; Izci et al., 2021). The folate receptor is commonly overexpressed on various tumor types (including NSCLC) and frequently used for active targeted nanosystems delivery (Santra et al., 2011). Besides, the main moiety in most drug delivery systems is carriers (the weight ratio is typically more than 90%), which makes the capacity for loading drugs generally limited (Ekladious et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021). In addition, the presence of inert carriers would increase the systemic toxicity of drug formulation and generate additional burdens to patients by their subsequent degradation (Milosevic et al., 2020; Kihara et al., 2021; Stater et al., 2021). As an alternative, carrier-free nanomedicines entirely made up of one or more drugs have more advantages in tumor theranostic due to high drug loading, low toxicity, and improved pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics (Liu and Zhang, 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Karaosmanoglu et al., 2021). Furthermore, in response to cues in the tumor microenvironment, certain carrier-free nanoparticles can undergo morphological alteration, changing their sizes and increasing drug retention and penetration in the tissue (Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). Here, we developed carrier-free functionalized nanoparticles (DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles) for chemo-photothermal therapy to improve the pharmacokinetics of GEM and enhance cell lethality. As shown in Figure 1, the carrier-free functionalized DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles were prepared by co-self-assembly of amphiphilic anticancer drug agent (DOG), active targeting agent (MOFA), and encapsulated photothermal therapy agent (ICG). After efficient internalization, the DOG prodrug would respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment and release GEM and ICG due to the cleavage of ester bonds. Then, GEM could enter the nucleus to exert an anti-tumor effect, and ICG could convert 808 nm laser irradiation energy into heat for photothermal therapy. These results highlight the potential of functionalized nanoparticles for highly efficient synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy for cancer inhibition, as well as providing a novel method for the theranostics nanosystems."

In contrast, more than 55% GEM and ICG in PBS (pH 6.5) and more than 82% GEM and ICG in PBS (pH 5.5) were released from nanoparticles. It was worth noting that there was less GEM release in the absence of esterase condition, suggesting that the GEM prodrug DOG was also released from the dialysis bag. Meanwhile, the laser irradiation could slightly boost GEM and ICG release (Figures 4D\u2013F and Supplementary Figure S30), which was less obvious than acidic pH which was easier to break the ester bond. In addition, the drug release was significantly reduced in the absence of esterase, indicating that those nanoparticles were esterase-responsive release.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org08\n3.6 In vitro stability\nIt was found that the zeta potential and size of different nanoparticles in PBS (pH 7.4), 10% FBS solution, and DMEM under 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C almost remained unchanged within 7 days respectively (Supplementary Figure S31A\u2013F).

The free ICG was used as a control. As displayed in Figures 6A, B and Supplementary Figure S33, the mean ICG fluorescence intensity of DOG/ICG and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles was stronger than that of the free ICG group, and the average ICG fluorescence intensity of DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles was stronger than that of DOG/ICG nanoparticles. Moreover, with prolonged co-incubation time of nanoparticles and A549 cells, the increased fluorescence signal indicated that cell uptake of DOG/ICG andDOG/MOFA/ICGnanoparticles was time-dependent. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles + free folate (pre-treatment with 1 mmol/L) was considerably lower than that of DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles in the competitive inhibition experiment (Figures 6C, D), suggesting that the high uptake behavior of DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles may be attributed to folate receptor-mediated active transport (active targeting).\n3.11 In vitro cytotoxicity\nIn vitro cytotoxicity of self-assembled nanoparticles against A549 cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay. The cell viability of A549 cells decreased with increasing drug concentrations in different self-assembled nanoparticles, and laser irradiation caused a further decrease in their viability (Figure 7A\u2013G). The IC50 values and dose-response curves of drugs and different nanoparticles are listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S33. Additionally, the relationship between dose and combination index (CI) in DOG/ICG and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles was summarized in Table 3.\nNext, DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles were investigated for the capability of targeted delivery to get selective inhibition of A549 cancer cells over the L929 normal cells. The DOG/MOFA and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles were much more cytotoxic to A549 cells than DOG nanoparticles at all doses (Figure 7A\u2013G). Instead, incubating the above-mentioned drugs and nanoparticles with L929 cells, similar cytotoxicity of different nanoparticles to L929 cells could be observed (Figure 7H), indicating the selectivity of these nanoparticles to tumor cells.\nFIGURE 6 The cellular ICG fluorescence intensity of DOG/ICG and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles at different incubation time intervals (1 h, 4 h) in A549 cells (A) and the quantitative results were analyzed by flow cytometry (B).

Compared with GEM group, the total proportion of apoptotic cells in the free DOG (amphiphilic prodrug) group was obviously decreased, indicating prodrug could reduce cytotoxicity in a short period of time. The different nanoparticles group showed higher total apoptosis rates compared with the GEM group, which indicated nanoparticles could indeed significantly increase the\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org11\ncytotoxicity to A549 cells. What\u2019s more, the introduction of targeting moieties promoted the antitumor effects of nanoparticles.\nAs illustrated in Figure 8B, the effects of laser irradiation on cytotoxicity were not significant in all groups without ICG, which indicated short-term laser irradiation was basically non-toxic to cells. In addition, laser irradiation significantly aggravated apoptosis in groups containing ICG, and it was found that DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles induced significant apoptosis (81.07%) under 808 nm laser irradiation (1 W/cm2, 5 min). The results demonstrated DOG/ MOFA/ICG nanoparticles possessed excellent antitumor activity via synergetic chemo-photothermal therapy.\n3.13 In vivo pharmacokinetics\nTo explore whether DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles could ameliorate the pharmacokinetics properties of free GEM, the pharmacokinetic studies of free GEM and DOG/MOFA/ICG\nnanoparticles were conducted.

At multiple time points, the plasma concentrations of free GEM and DOG were measured.

Furthermore, at 24 h after DOG/ MOFA/ICG nanoparticles treatment, it was found that the plasma concentrations of DOG were higher than that of GEM, which indicated that DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles administrated intravenously could have a sustained-release effect to maintain a long-term anti-tumor activity."

GEM, as a typical clinical first-line antitumor nucleoside analog, the major shortcomings were short half-life in plasma, rapid inactivation by the enzyme, and susceptibility to drug resistance. To overcome its deficiencies in\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org13\nthe application, GEM prodrug was synthesized, and established the self-assembly of GEM nanoparticles to obstruct medication release. Recently, fatty acids were introduced to the amino group of GEM to prepare amphiphilic prodrugs for self-assembly nanoparticles (Coppens et al., 2021), but the protocol was complicated and time-consuming. Thus, we decided to introduce the fatty acids onto the sugar moiety of GEM instead of the amino group to obtain amphiphilic prodrugs conveniently. The synthesis of amphiphilic prodrugs was shown in Figure 2 and the chemical structure of GEM amphiphilic prodrugs was identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy and TOF-Qmass spectroscopy. From the integral ratio of the methine protons (\u03b4 7.79 and 7.53 ppm) in the pyrimidine ring and methyl protons (\u03b4 0.90 ppm) in fatty acid, it could be proved that two oleic acid chains were coupled to the GEM successfully. Comparing the 1H NMR spectrum of free GEM and amphiphilic prodrugs, it was found that the signs of 3\u2032-OH (\u03b4 6.24 ppm) and 5\u2032- OH (\u03b4 5.20 ppm) disappeared, the chemical shifts of 3\u2032-H and 5\u2032-H of sugar moiety shifted to 5.39 and 4.43 ppm from 4.14 ppm as well as 3.73 and 3.63 ppm respectively, which verified that two oleic acid chains were coupled to 3\u2032-OH and 5\u2032-OH of sugar moiety (Supplementary Figures S1, S3, S5, S7, S9). Also, the structures of DOG, DLG, DMG, DDG, and DHG were confirmed by molecular weights measured by TOF-Q mass spectroscopy of 792.5702, 788.5390, 684.4760, 572.3500, and 488.2571, respectively (Supplementary Figures S2, S4, S6, S8, S10). The folate receptor is commonly overexpressed on various tumor types and frequently used for active targeted nanosystems delivery. Here, 1-octadecanol\nwas introduced to folate to synthesize amphiphilic MOFA, which was identified by the integral ratio of the methine protons (\u03b4 9.14 ppm) in N-heterocycle and methyl protons (\u03b4 0.89 ppm) in 1-octadecanol (Supplementary Figure S11), as well as a molecular weight of 694.4293 by TOF-Q mass spectroscopy (Supplementary Figure S12).\nThe size of nanosystems ranging from 70 to 200 nm allows for more accumulation in tumors (Jeevanandam et al., 2016). To obtain the suitable size of co-self-assembly carrier-free GEM nanoparticle loading indocyanine green (DOG/MOFA/ICG) for an actively targeted combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, four solvents miscible with water (DMSO, DMF, MeOH, and EtOH) were screened by reprecipitation method. It was found that DMSO was the optimal solvent for the self-assembly of amphiphilic prodrugs. Among all prodrugs, the nanoparticle size formed by DOG was the smallest (~94.74 nm), with the highest value of Zeta potential (\u221230.30 mV) andmono-dispersity, indicating that the DOG could form the most stable nanoparticle (Supplementary Table S1). The average particle size of DOG/ MOFA/ICG nanoparticles obtained by the laser particle size analyzer was 109.2 \u00b1 3.05 nm. The PDI of the DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticle was 0.188 \u00b1 0.017, with a potential zeta of \u221230.10 \u00b1 0.70 mV. It was observed that the zeta potential and size of nanoparticles in PBS (pH 7.4), 10% FBS solution, and DMEM under 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C almost remained unchanged within 7 days respectively (Supplementary Figure S31). Moreover, these nanoparticles were stable under laser irradiation within three cycles, with slight changes in the size, PDI, and zeta (Supplementary Figures S31G\u2013I). The self-assembly nanoparticles could be kept in reserve for a long time, with excellent stability. The molecular dynamics (MD) calculations showed that the excellent stability of the nanoparticles originated from the interactions between folate prodrug MOFA and DOG, such as hydrogen bond, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, \u03c0-cation and halogen hydrophobic interaction (Supplementary Figure S13), which was verified by 1H-NMR and infrared spectra (Supplementary Figure S14\u2013S28). The pteridine group of folate was similar to guanine, which can form hydrogen bonds, and \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking with GEM prodrug DOG, which was similar to guanine and cytosine base pairing. Furtherly, the hydrophobic chain tails of folate prodrug MOFA and GEM prodrug DOG could interact with each other by hydrophobic action. The interactions between different moieties improved the structural integrity of the self-assembled nanoparticles\u2019 stability.\nTo better understand the characteristics of co-self-assembly carrier-free nanoparticles, the anti-blood dilution properties and releasing profiles of different nanoparticles were investigated. All self-assembled nanoparticles had a rather low CMC value;\nFIGURE 9 The free GEM and DOG concentrations in plasma after a single intravenous administration of the free GEM and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles at 0\u201324 h time points were measured by LC-MS/MS.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org14\nsuggesting these self-assembled nanoparticles were stable to antidilution during blood circulation. The releasing profiles showed that the different nanoparticles could have pH/photo and enzymeresponsive drug release properties because of the break of the ester bond. The release behavior of ICG was generally consistent with GEM (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S30), which proved that ICG was successfully encapsulated inside the nanoparticles to ensure the synergism of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles displayed a pharmacokinetic profile dramatically different from that of free GEM. Compared to the free GEM, the plasma concentration of DOG after the treatment of DOG/MOFA/ ICG nanoparticle declined slower than that after the treatment of free GEM over time, and the t1/2 and AUC0-\u221e of the DOG nanoparticle increased 1.84, 5.12 fold, respectively (Table 4). The self-assembly of DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles did help prolong their circulation time in the blood and enhance bioavailability.\nThe photothermal effect of nanoparticles was evaluated. After near-infrared laser irradiation (1 W/cm2) for 5 min, the temperature of free ICG reached about 50\u00b0C, while the temperatures of DOG/ICG and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles reached 51.9\u00b0C and 57.0\u00b0C respectively, which suggested the photothermal efficiency of nanoparticles loading ICG was significantly improved (Figure 5A). The reasons might be that ICG-loaded selfassembled nanoparticles own a highly condensed concentration than free ICG, resulting in higher light-to-heat conversion efficiency and less heat loss. Even after four ON/OFF cycles of laser irradiation, the maximum temperature of DOG/ICG and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles could still reach about 40\u00b0C, indicating that DOG/ICG and DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles exhibited high photothermal stability, which could result from the interaction between the ICG and its adjacent solvent was reduced. In addition, weak intermolecular interactions restricted the movement of ICG molecules within the nanoparticles to reduce photothermal dissipation.\nIt is important to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the nanoparticles. Only insignificant hemolysis (approximately 5%) was observed in the nanoparticles compared to the proportion of hemolysis in GEM (approximately 35%) (Jeswani et al., 2015), and the in vitro toxicity of the nanoparticles to L929 cells was significantly lower than that of GEM itself (Figure 7). These results indicated the obtained nanoparticles were highly biocompatible. Cell lethality was well known to correlate with the cellular uptake of nanodrugs. Cell uptake and competitive uptake experiments demonstrated that DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles increased cellular uptake of nanoparticles through folatemediated active targeting (Figure 6F). Thus DOG/MOFA/ICG nanoparticles were the most effective compared to other nanoparticles. The high efficiency of DOG/MOFA/ICG combined with laser irradiation in vitromight be owed to the synergistic effect between chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. The temperature increase induced by laser radiation could enhance the permeability of tumor cell membranes and increase the opportunities for GEM to act on the nucleus of the tumor cell. At the same time, GEM release triggered by laser radiation could enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Therefore, chemo-photothermal nanoparticle therapy is a promising strategy for improving anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy. The CI could reflect the synergism of\nchemotherapy and photothermal therapy. As shown in Table 3, DOG and ICG synergistically inhibited tumour growth at almost all doses, except very low doses. The lever of synergy was related to the dosage. When the concentrations of DOG and ICG were 0.2 and 0.017 \u03bcg/mL, the value of CI was the smallest (0.23 for DOG/ICG and 0.114 for DOG/MOFA/ICG), indicating strong synergism. The results suggested that DOG and ICG had a good mutual promotion effect. In addition, flow cytometry analysis to quantify apoptosis induced by different nanoparticles was consistent with the antitumor effect of nanoparticles."
