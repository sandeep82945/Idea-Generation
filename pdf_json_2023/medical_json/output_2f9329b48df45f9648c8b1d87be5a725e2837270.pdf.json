            "text": "TP53 encodes a critical tumor suppressor, p53, which has numerous roles in protecting cells from oncogenic transformation and stress through the regulation of transcription, metabolism, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, and immune signaling (1\u20133). The importance of p53 in tumor suppression is evidenced by the fact that this gene is mutated in over half of human cancers. Li\u2013Fraumeni disease is characterized by germline p53 mutations and is associated with an increased risk of multiple primary cancers throughout life (4). Whereas wild-type (WT) p53 is critical for tumor suppression, mutant p53 promotes tumorigenesis through the inactivation of wild-type p53 function, and through the gain of oncogenic properties (\u201cgain of function\u201d) caused by new activities of mutant, misfolded p53 protein. Mutant p53 gain of function includes the promotion of proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, angiogenesis, metastasis,\nand drug resistance (5\u20138). In addition to fully inactivating mutations in Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome, there are over 200 germline variants of TP53; some of these, such as G334R and P47S, have been shown to be hypomorphic in function and to be associated with increased cancer risk in humans (9\u201312).\nAlthough p53 has both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial roles, it is widely accepted that the transcriptional activity of p53 is critical for tumor suppression. Numerous p53 transcriptional targets have been identified for p53 that play roles in apoptosis and growth arrest, such as BBC3, PMAIP1, and CDKN1A (13\u201315). However, these genes are infrequently mutated in cancer. Moreover, mice deficient in these target genes do not show enhanced rates of spontaneous cancer (16\u201318). Thus, critical target genes for p53-mediated tumor suppression remain to be identified. In support of this, a recently published CRISPR screen has identified one of the first p53 target genes that itself shows tumor suppressor function: the p53 target ZMAT3 that regulates RNA splicing (19).\nHere, we analyze the germline p53 variant Y107H (Tyr107His, rs368771578), which exists in approximately 0.1% of African-descent individuals (gnomAD v2.1.1) and which we show is hypomorphic in function. We show that, like the other hypomorphic germline variants P47S and G334R, the Y107H variant retains a considerable WT function, is structurally similar to WT p53, and is defective in the transactivation of only a small subset of p53 target genes. The latter subset includes the gene encoding the epigenetic modifying protein PADI4, which deiminates arginine to citrulline and is subject to mutational inactivation in some human tumors (20, 21). Interestingly, PADI4 shows impaired transactivation by several other p53 hypomorphic variants, suggesting that this p53 target is exquisitely sensitive to p53 function. We show that PADI4 markedly impairs tumor progression, requires an intact immune system in order to do so, and enhances the ability of p53 to regulate a subset of genes that are predictive of immune cell infiltrates and the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibition. Finally, we show that we\nAfrican-specific germline variant of TP53 in the DNA-binding domain Tyr107His (Y107H). Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures reveal that Y107H is structurally similar to wild-type p53. Consistent with this, we find that Y107H can suppress tumor colony formation and is impaired for the transactivation of only a small subset of p53 target genes; this includes the epigenetic modifier PADI4, which deiminates arginine to the nonnatural amino acid citrulline. Surprisingly, we show that Y107H mice develop spontaneous cancers and metastases and that Y107H shows impaired tumor suppression in two other models. We show that PADI4 is itself tumor suppressive and that it requires an intact immune system for tumor suppression. We identify a p53\u2013PADI4 gene signature that is predictive of survival and the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors.\nSIGNIFICANCE: We analyze the African-centric Y107H hypomorphic variant and show that it confers increased cancer risk; we use Y107H in order to identify PADI4 as a key tumor-suppressive p53 target gene that contributes to an immune modulation signature and that is predictive of cancer survival and the success of immunotherapy.\n1Program in Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 2Graduate Group in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 3Program in Molecular Therapeutics, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 4Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 5Del Shankel Structural Biology Center, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas. 6Program in Immunology, Microenvironment and Metastasis, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 7Program in Gene Expression and Regulation, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 8NYX, New York Structural Biology Center, Upton, New York. 9Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.

This analysis confirmed that Y107H is modestly impaired for colony suppression compared with WT p53, similar to another African-specific p53 hypomorph, P47S (Fig.\u00a0 1A; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S1A for p53 levels). We next compared human lymphoblastoid cells [lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL)] from age- and ethnicity-matched individuals who harbor WT p53 or are heterozygous for the Y107H variant. Treatment with the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin led to modestly increased apoptosis in Y107H LCLs as compared with WT p53 and the Li\u2013Fraumeni R273H mutation, as indicated by the increased level of cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) and cleaved lamin A (CLA; Fig.\u00a01B). Similar increased chemosensitivity has been seen for other partially functional mutant p53 alleles (24). In contrast, we found identical sensitivity of these LCLs to other agents, including the ferroptosis-inducing agent RSL3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1B).\nTo further assess the functionality of Y107H, we generated a Y107H knockin mouse using CRISPR-Cas9 editing in C57Bl/6 embryos. This mouse was generated in the background of WT murine p53 (Y104H) or in mice containing the humanized p53 knockin (Hupki) targeting allele (Y107H). Hupki p53 replaces exons 4 to 9 (and intervening introns) of murine p53 with the human sequence, and Hupki p53 has been shown to be fully functional and tumor suppressive in mice (25, 26). Both Y104H and Y107H mice were backcrossed to a C57Bl/6 background for over five generations, and the entire p53 coding region was sequenced to ensure the absence of second-site mutations. Both Y107H and Y104H mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) showed similar p53 induction compared with WT p53 (Fig.\u00a0 1C; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S1C and S1D) and again showed modestly increased cell death following doxorubicin treatment compared with WT and p53null MEFs (Fig.\u00a0 1C; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S1E). Given these differences between WT p53 and Y107H, we clarified that unlike R273H, which shows a significantly reduced ability to transactivate p21/CDKN1A in response to nutlin-3a (nutlin), Y107H is indistinguishable from WT p53 in this regard (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1F), further supporting the designation of Y107H as a hypomorph. We next assessed the DNA damage response in Y107H mice following gamma radiation. In the radiosensitive spleen and thymus, Y107H showed increased apoptosis following gamma radiation compared with WT p53, as well as increased Ki-67 staining in the untreated spleen (Fig.\u00a0 1D and E; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S1G and S1H). The increased Ki-67 in Y107H spleen cells, and the moderate increase in apoptosis following doxorubicin and radiation,\nprompted us to assess the proliferative potential and efficiency of cell-cycle arrest in Y107H LCLs and MEFs compared with WT p53. These analyses revealed significantly increased numbers of cells in the S phase in Y107H LCLs and MEFs compared with WT, as well as decreased growth arrest following treatment with doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1I and S1J). The increased proliferation and decreased ability to undergo growth arrest likely explain the increased apoptosis in Y107H cells following treatment with doxorubicin or gamma radiation, as a correlation between proliferation and increased p53-mediated apoptosis has been noted in previous studies (27, 28).\nY107H Is Defective for Transactivation of a Subset of p53 Target Genes, Including PADI4\nWe next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on human LCLs with WT p53 or heterozygous for Y107H treated with nutlin or cisplatin. This analysis revealed nearly identical p53 target activation in WT and Y107H LCLs (Fig.\u00a0 2A and B). Not surprisingly, the p53 pathway was the key pathway differentially regulated (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2A and S2B). Only a small subset of p53 target genes were impaired for transactivation in Y107H LCLs in response to nutlin [n\u00a0=\u00a075, fold change (FC)\u00a0>2] or cisplatin (n\u00a0=\u00a070, FC\u00a0>2; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2C; Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). Among the top impaired p53 target genes in Y107H in response to nutlin was PADI4. Analysis of RNA-seq data for LCLs with two other hypomorphs of p53 (P47S and G334R) revealed PADI4 to be one of only two genes with impaired transactivation in all three hypomorph LCLs compared with matched WT cell lines from age- and ethnicity-matched family members (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S2D). We next used qRT-PCR analysis of independent samples in order to confirm that the p53 target CDKN1A (p21) shows similar transactivation by WT and Y107H, but that the p53 targets PLTP, PADI4, and HHAT were markedly impaired for transactivation in Y107H cells in response to nutlin (Fig.\u00a0 2C) and cisplatin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S2E). At the protein level, PADI4 showed impaired upregulation following nutlin treatment in Y107H LCLs; this was also true in LCLs from four other p53 hypomorphs (G334R, P47S, R175C, and Y220H), as well as in LCLs containing the hotspot mutant R273H (Fig.\u00a02D and E). Decreased PADI4 immunostaining was evident in the spleens and thymuses of Y107H mice following gamma radiation (Fig.\u00a02F\u2013H). Because PADI4 is critical for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), we analyzed NET formation in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)\u2013stimulated neutrophils isolated from WT and Y107H mice (29). NETs from Y107H neutrophils were markedly reduced compared with neutrophils from age- and sex-matched WT mice, despite equal numbers of neutrophils in both types of mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2F\u2013S2H).\nY107H Is Impaired for Binding at Certain p53 Response Elements\nWe next performed chromatin immunoprecipitationquantitative real-time PCR (ChIP-qPCR) for p53 in WT and Y107H LCLs treated with nutlin for 24 hours. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed the Y107H variant to be modestly impaired for binding to chromatin at its response element for all targets tested, including the canonical p53 targets MDM2 and\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.C D -22-1315/3340660/cd-22-1315.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nWT Y107H\nns6\n4\n% o\nf p 53 - po si tiv e ce\nlls\n2\n0\nWT Y107H\nns4\n3\n% o\nf p 21 - po si tiv e ce\nlls\n2\n1\n0\nWT Y107H\n**20\n15\n% o\nf C LA - po si tiv e ce\nlls\n10\n5\n0\nWT Y107H\n*\n***\n15\n% o\nf C C 3- po si tiv e ce\nlls\n10\n5\n0\nWT Y107H\n30\n% o\nf K i-6 7\u2013 po si tiv e ce\nlls\n20\n10\n0\nA B C\nD\nE\nH1299\nVector\nWT\nWT\n0 8 24 0 8 24 0 8 24\nMDM2\np53\np21\nCLA\nCC3\np-H2AX (S139)\nGAPDH\np53\nWT Y107H WT Y107H\nSpleen\nUntreated \u03b3-IR (5 Gy, 4 h)\np21\nCLA\nCC3\nKi-67\n0.1 \u00b5mol/L Doxo., h\nY107H R273H\nLCLs\nWT\n0 8 24 0 8 24 0 8 24\nMDM2\np53\np21\nCLA\nCC3\np-H2AX (S139)\nGapdh\nUntreated \u03b3-IR\n1 \u00b5mol/L Doxo., h\nY107H p53\u2212/\u2212\nMEFs\nP47S\nY107H\n100 *\n* 80 30\n% C\nol on\ny fo\nrm at\nio n\n20\n10\n0\nVe cto\nr W T P4 7S\nY1 07\nH\nUntreated \u03b3-IR\nUntreated \u03b3-IR\nUntreated \u03b3-IR\nUntreated \u03b3-IR\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.C D -22-1315/3340660/cd-22-1315.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nOF5 | CANCER DISCOVERY JULY 2023 AACRJournals.org\nA\nC\nD\nF G H\nE\nB WT\nVehicle\np5 3\nta rg\net g\nen es\nVehicleNutlin 24 h\n4\n40\n30\n20\nm R\nN A\ne xp\nre ss\nio n\nre la\ntiv e\nto G\nA P\nD H\n10\n0\n1,500\n1,000\nm R\nN A\ne xp\nre ss\nio n\nre la\ntiv e\nto G\nA P\nD H\nm R\nN A\ne xp\nre ss\nio n\nre la\ntiv e\nto G\nA P\nD H\nm R\nN A\ne xp\nre ss\nio n\nre la\ntiv e\nto G\nA P\nD H\n500\n0\n150\n100\n50\n0\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0 0 8 24\n0 8 24\n1 0.36\n0 8 24\nns\n*** * **\n2 0\nCDKN1A PADI4 PLTP HHAT\n0123\u22122 \u22124\nNutlin 24 h \u2212Log(P) 30\n20\n10\n\u221210 \u22125 0\nEPS8L2\nPLTP SERPINE1 PADI4\nPLD3 NAV2 LIPE\nSHROOM2\nTP53l11\nPCLO JAG2\nHHAT\nKANK3 ATF3\nPLXNB1 S1PR4\nFCGBP IL16\nIL21R SLC4A11\nCEACAM21\n5 0\n\u2212Log10 (P) Log2 (FC)\n\u2212 Lo\ng 1 0\n(P )\nLog2 (fold)\nY107H\nWT\nPADI4: spleen\nUntreated \u03b3-IR"

Y107H had a more profound impairment for binding to the promoters of HHAT, PLTP, and PADI4, and there was a negligible binding of IgG or with primers for a promoter desert (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S3D\u2013S3L). To explore whether this defect in binding was Y107H-intrinsic, we performed direct DNA-binding and fluorescence polarization competition assays using the purified core domains of WT p53 and Y107H (aa 94\u2013312). For these assays, the purified DNAbinding domain was incubated with fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide for the p53 response element from the CDKN1A 5\u2032-site (30); unlabeled oligonucleotides representing the p53 response elements for CDKN1A, PLTP, or PADI4 were used in increasing concentration as a competitor. Direct binding to the CDKN1A response element was markedly impaired in Y107H as compared with WT p53 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3M and S3N). As expected, WT p53 bound to the response element of CDKN1A and PLTP in a cooperative manner, as evidenced by a Hill slope\u00a0>1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3O\u2013S3Q). In contrast, Y107H protein showed a defect in cooperative binding to all of the response elements examined (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S3O\u2013S3Q). These data suggest that Y107H appears to have an intrinsic defect in DNA binding, but that this defect is less pronounced when assessed in vivo by ChIP; this difference may be due to p53, histone, and chromatin modifications that occur in vivo that may enhance the ability of Y107H to bind to p53 response elements. Differences in the temperature at which these assays are performed may also have an impact.\nY107H Is Structurally Similar to WT p53 but Shows Increased Propensity to Misfold\nThe loss of binding at the PADI4 response element and the apparent loss of cooperativity at multiple sites for Y107H indicate a potential perturbation in p53 structural dynamics. To address this, the purified DNA-binding domain (DBD) of WT and Y107H p53 was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig.\u00a0 3A). We observed modest changes in the Y107H DBD in solution, and all changes were localized to the amino acids directly surrounding Y107H (Fig.\u00a0 3B and C). Consistent with these data, we found the crystal structure of the core domain of Y107H (aa 94\u2013312) to closely resemble the structure of WT p53 (Fig.\u00a03D and E; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4A\u2013S4C). Despite these modest differences, we found that the core domain of Y107H is thermally destabilized, as indicated by a decrease in melting temperature as measured by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF; Fig.\u00a03F).\nDecreased thermal stability is observed in tumor-derived p53 mutants, leading to loss of tumor-suppressive activity and increased propensity to self-aggregate. Using a thioflavin T (ThioT) binding assay to assess protein aggregation over time, we observed that the Y107H core domain showed markedly enhanced aggregation compared with the WT core domain (Fig.\u00a03G). These data prompted us to probe the propensity for Y107H to misfold in cells. Toward this goal, we performed immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for mutant, misfolded p53 (pAb240) or total p53 (CM5). This analysis confirmed a significantly increased propensity for the Y107H variant to misfold into a mutant, pAb240-reactive conformation; this was evident in early-passage MEFs from WT and Y107H mice (Fig.\u00a03H\u2013J; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4D), as well as in oncogenically transformed E1A/Ras MEFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4E and S4F). The combined data support the premise that Y107H possesses many WT properties but has an increased propensity to misfold into a mutant conformation."

            "text": "To probe the tumor-suppressive ability of the Y107H variant in vivo, we monitored mice harboring either WT p53 or homozygous for the Y107H variant in a C57Bl/6 background for spontaneous tumor formation. Spontaneous tumor formation was rare in WT p53 mice, with only 1 out of 36 mice showing a histiocytic sarcoma after 20 months (Fig.\u00a04A and B). In contrast, over 30% of Y107H mice developed tumors in this time frame; notably, these included tumors commonly associated with Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome, such as sarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and breast cancer (Fig.\u00a04A\u2013C; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S5A\u2013S5E). The average latency of cancer in Y107H mice was 19.5 months; this supports the premise that this variant is a low-penetrance hypomorph and not a fully inactivating mutant, as mice with mutant p53 typically develop tumors between 6 and 12 months. Interestingly, however, we noted several metastatic tumors. We noted increased rates of tumor incidence in mice harboring the mouse variant of p53, Y104H, compared with WT p53 as well (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5B). To further examine the impact of Y107H on cancer incidence, we subjected age- and sex-matched WT and Y107H mice to fractionated radiation and monitored the development of T-cell lymphoma. We saw a nonsignificant increase in T-cell lymphoma in Y107H mice, combined with a significant increase in disseminated disease in these mice (Fig.\u00a04D and E), evident as increased spleen and liver sizes in Y107H mice compared with WT (Fig.\u00a0 4F\u2013I; Supplementary\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.C D -22-1315/3340660/cd-22-1315.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nOF7 | CANCER DISCOVERY JULY 2023 AACRJournals.org\nA B C\nD\nH I\nG\nF\nE\nJ\nWT 106\n104\n106\n108\n113\n113.5\n114\n7.9 7.7 7.5 7.3 7.1\n9.45 9.4 9.35 9.3\n108 110 112 114 116 118 120 122 124 126 128 130 132\n10 .1 9. 9 9. 7 9. 5 9. 3 9. 1 8. 9 8. 7 8. 5 8. 3 8. 1 7. 9 7. 7 7. 5 7. 3 7. 1 6. 9 6. 7 6. 5\nY107H WTY107H\nWT Y107H\nWT\nUntreated\nUntreated\n5 \u00b5mol/L CDDP\n5 \u00b5mol/L CDDP Primary MEFs\nUntreated 5 \u00b5mol/L CDDP\nY107HWT Y107H WT Y107H\nWT\nns ns Y107H\nY107\nH107\nDSF\nThioT aggregation assay\n****\n**** ****\np53-Y107H (8E7A)\np53-R273H/S240R (4IBY)\nWT Y107H\nWT\n100 Time (min)\nMutant p53 (pAb240)\nTotal p53 (CM5)\n200 300\n40\n38\nT m\n( \u00b0C\n)\n36\n34\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n0\n0\n20\n40\n60\n% p\nA b2\n40 -p\nos iti\nve c\nel ls\nm ut\np 53\n( pA\nb2 40 ) D A P\nI M er ge\n80\n100\n120\n0\n20\n40\n60\n% C\nM 5-\npo si\ntiv e\nce lls\n80\n100\n120\nY107H\nR F\nU\nS269 T253\nS260 V147\nG266\nG266 G105\nS269\nG105\nG267 E258\nR110\nD148\nV157\nY107\nN263\nT150\nS261 T155\n1H (ppm)\n1H (ppm)\n1H (ppm)\n15 N\n( pp\nm )\n15 N\n( pp\nm )\n15 N\n( pp\nm )\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.C D -22-1315/3340660/cd-22-1315.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nJULY 2023 CANCER DISCOVERY | OF8\nFig.\u00a0 S5F). Disseminated T-cell lymphoma in these organs was confirmed by CD3+/B220\u2212 IHC staining (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5G). Interestingly, increased propensity to metastasize is a hallmark of tumors with mutant conformation p53 (31, 32).\nWT and Y107H MEFs were transformed with adenovirus E1A and activated (mutant) Ras to further probe the tumorsuppressive ability of the Y107H variant. We confirmed increased Ras and stabilized p53 due to E1A expression by Western blot in two independent sets of WT and Y107H transformed cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5H). E1A/Ras MEFs were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of immunocompromised mice, and tumor growth was measured over time. Y107H E1A/Ras tumors grew at a significantly faster rate than WT tumors (Fig.\u00a04J\u2013M). Identical findings were made using an independent set of E1A/Ras-transformed MEFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5I\u2013S5K). We noted increased Ki-67 staining in Y107H tumors compared with WT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5L and S5M). A comparison of the growth of Y107H E1A/Ras tumors to p53\u2212/\u2212 E1A/Ras tumors revealed that, as might be expected, Y107H has an intermediate phenotype between p53 null and p53 WT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5N). The combined data from three different model systems (spontaneous cancer in Y104H and Y107H, as well as E1A/Ras-transformed cells) support the conclusion that Y107H is a significantly poorer tumor suppressor compared with WT p53."

            "text": "We previously showed that we could identify chemotherapeutic compounds that show increased sensitivity in tumor cells from another hypomorph, P47S, compared with matched clones with WT p53 (33). To test this premise for Y107H, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create two independent clones of homozygous Y107H cells in the background of the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line. These two clones (A11 and C2) of Y107H had the entire p53 cDNA sequenced to confirm the absence of other mutations and were compared with parental HCT116 cells that had gone through the CRISPR knockin process without guides. The Y107H clones exhibited indistinguishable levels of p53 and p53 target activation following treatment with doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S6A). We then screened parental HCT116 and both Y107H clones against a 2,000 compound MedChemExpress anticancer library and identified compounds that show preferential loss of viability in both Y107H clones compared with WT (Fig.\u00a0 5A). In this screen, we identified\napproximately two dozen compounds that showed a minimum of 3-fold decreased IC50 (increased sensitivity) in both Y107H clones compared with parental (Fig.\u00a05B). Two of these compounds were glutaminase inhibitors, CB-839 and BPTES. We confirmed the increased sensitivity of both Y107H clones using an independent cell viability (Alamar Blue) assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6B and S6C). We next tested this premise in vivo, and NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were subcutaneously injected with WT or Y107H HCT116 cells and tumor growth was measured. When tumors reached approximately 50 mm3 in size, mice were assigned randomly to treatment groups and treated with vehicle control or 200 mg/kg CB-839 twice daily by oral gavage. Consistent with our previous findings, vehicletreated Y107H tumors grew larger than WT tumors (Fig.\u00a05C). Parental HCT116 tumors showed no antitumor effect upon CB-839 treatment, whereas Y107H tumor growth was significantly reduced in the CB-839 treatment group (Fig.\u00a0 5C\u2013E). There was no loss of weight in treated mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S6D), and there was no difference in p53 levels in Y107H tumors compared with WT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6E). Interestingly, the differential sensitivity to CB-839 was not manifested in nontransformed cells, as we saw no evidence for increased CB-839 cytotoxicity in nontransformed Y107H MEFs or LCLs, relative to WT p53, using cell viability assays and clonogenic survival (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S6F\u2013S6H). Y107H tumors treated with CB-839 showed significantly decreased Ki-67 and increased markers for programmed cell death (CLA and CC3; Fig.\u00a05F and G). We also noted increased CD31 staining in untreated Y107H tumors (Fig.\u00a05F).\nWe next probed the ATF4 pathway, which is activated by nutrient deprivation and CB-839 treatment (34). We found evidence for increased induction of ATF4, increased induction of the prodeath protein CHOP, increased CLA, and decreased p-EIF2\u03b1 in both Y107H clones compared with WT parental cells (Fig.\u00a0 5H). We recently reported that p53 hypomorphs share common features, including the propensity to misfold (35), so we sought to analyze the P47S hypomorph for CB-839 sensitivity. HCT116 cells with homozygous knockin mutations for the P47S hypomorphs (clones B5 and G12) were generated previously (35).

Ectopic expression of PADI4 in Y107H cells rendered these cells resistant to CB-839 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6L and S6M). These data support a potential role for PADI4 in the increased efficacy of glutaminase inhibitors in p53 hypomorph tumors; the underlying mechanism for this effect remains to be elucidated.\nPADI4 Interacts with p53, Is Tumor Suppressive, and Cooperates with p53 in the Transcription of a Subset of p53 Target Genes\nWe next set out to understand the underlying basis for impaired tumor suppression of Y107H, with a particular emphasis on PADI4, which we identified as the top impaired p53 target gene in multiple heterozygous p53 hypomorphic LCLs. We confirmed a previous report that PADI4 is able to suppress colony formation (36) by performing this assay in multiple cancer cell lines, including melanoma (M93-047), lung cancer (A549), bone cancer (U2OS), and colorectal cancer (HCT116; Fig.\u00a06A; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7A\u2013S7E). We also noted significant colony suppression in H1299 lung cells, which are null for p53 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7D). Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed PADI4 to be mutated in multiple cancer types, including 8% of melanoma (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S7F); indeed, several missense mutations have been shown to impair the enzymatic activity of PADI4 (20). PADI4 is chiefly expressed in hematopoietic cells, but some tumor cell lines aberrantly express this gene (37). Analysis of over a dozen tumor cell lines containing WT p53 revealed two cell lines with expression of PADI4, and this gene was inducible following p53 activation: the M93047 melanoma (human NRAS-mutant melanoma, WT p53; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S7G) and the Yumm1.7 murine melanoma line (BRAF-V600E mutation and PTEN deletion, WT p53; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7H). We next generated clones of Yumm1.7 cells that stably overexpress PADI4; interestingly, steady-state levels of p53 protein in this line were increased when PADI4 was overexpressed, and there was increased cell death following etoposide treatment (Fig.\u00a0 6B). There is evidence that p53 and PADI4 interact (38), so we next probed for a PADI4\u2013p53 interaction in M93-047 cells using a proximity ligation assay; this complex was present in untreated cells, and was greatly induced by nutlin (Fig.\u00a0 6C). We confirmed a p53\u2013PADI4 interaction using immunoprecipitation\u2013Western blot analysis in Yumm1.7 cells (Fig.\u00a0 6D). We noted that PADI4 overexpression consistently led to increased p53 steady-state levels; however, this was not due to increased p53 stability, as PADI4 overexpression did not cause an increase in p53 half-life (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7I).\nWe next sought to dissect the role of PADI4 in tumor suppression. Toward this goal, Yumm1.7 clones stably transfected with vector alone or PADI4 were generated; PADI4 overexpression led to a modest decrease in proliferation in these clones (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7J). These cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of C57Bl/6 mice. The PADI4 overexpression clones initially showed faster kinetics of growth compared with vector-alone cells, but tumors rapidly regressed, and by the end of the experiment, 13 of 18 PADI4-overexpressing tumors were not detectable after dissection, resulting in markedly improved survival (Fig.\u00a06E\u2013 G; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S7K). As an orthogonal approach,\nwe used a CRISPR activation system (CRISPRa) in which deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) activates the expression of the endogenous PADI4 gene using a PADI4 guide in Yumm1.7 cells; we compared sgControl with PADI4 activation (two independent pools of cells infected with the activation guide) and to a clone in which PADI4 was deleted using CRISPR guides (PADI4 KO). Both independent PADI4 activation clones formed tumors that quickly regressed in C57Bl/6 hosts, whereas PADI4 KO tumors grew significantly larger than sgControl tumors (Fig.\u00a0 6H). We again saw evidence for an increased p53 steady-state level in PADI4 activation clones relative to KO or sgControl (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7L). RNA-seq analysis revealed a subset of p53 target genes that showed enhanced induction following nutlin treatment in the Yumm1.7 PADI4 activation clones compared with sgControl, supporting the premise that PADI4 may cooperate with p53 to regulate a subset of target genes (Fig.\u00a06I\u2013K). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed roles for this subset of genes in p53, JAK/STAT, IL8, and CXCR4 signaling (Fig.\u00a06J).\nWe next sought to determine the requirement for p53 in the ability of PADI4 to suppress tumor growth. In addition to the Yumm1.7 clones with CRISPR activation or knockout (KO; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7M), we also created two PADI4 CRISPR activation clones, two PADI4 KO clones, and an sgControl clone in a parental Yumm1.7 cell line that stably expresses a short hairpin for p53 (Yumm1.7 shp53; Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7N). We tested these shp53 clones for growth as tumors in vivo in syngeneic hosts. We found that PADI4 KO clones still showed increased tumor growth, relative to sgControl, in the absence of p53, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role that is independent of p53. We also found that PADI4 activation was able to suppress tumor growth as well, though perhaps to a reduced extent when p53 is silenced (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S7O). These data suggest that PADI4 possesses both p53-dependent and p53-independent tumor suppressor functions."

To test the requirement for an immune system in PADI4-mediated tumor suppression, we performed side-by-side experiments in which Yumm1.7 clones (sgControl; KO; and two activation clones, A1 and A2) were monitored as xenografts in mice injected with IgG control or antibody to CD8 to deplete CD8+ T cells.

To determine whether PADI4 is correlated with immune responses in human cancers, we first identified p53 target genes that show impaired activation in Y107H cells and that are coexpressed with PADI4 across multiple TCGA cancer types (Fig.\u00a0 7B and C). Notably, we found that high expression of these five genes (PADI4, CEACAM21, IL16, S1PR4, and IL21R) is significantly associated with improved survival in multiple cancer types (Fig.\u00a0 7D). The average expression of these five genes is also highly associated with increased CD8+\nT-cell infiltration in melanoma tumors (Fig.\u00a0 7E), and they predict improved survival in melanoma following immunecheckpoint inhibitor treatment in two independent datasets (anti\u2013PD-1; Fig.\u00a0 7F). Because the level of PADI4 expression is associated with WT p53 in multiple cancer types (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S8H), these data link tumor suppression by p53 to PADI4 and to a potential immune phenotype."

This is consistent with the designation of Y107H as a p53 hypomorph or lesserfunctioning allele. Of interest is the fact that colony suppression and transcriptional assays suggest that Y107H retains the majority of p53 function, yet the mice develop cancer; we propose that the Y107H protein may misfold with increasing time, thus explaining the increase in cancer incidence in mice over time. In support of an association between Y107H\nand cancer risk in humans, it is important to note that this variant was first described in a Li\u2013Fraumeni family (39). Moreover, a comparison of the frequency of Y107H in canceraffected African Americans in the TCGA database, compared with the frequency of this variant in African Americans in the gnomAD database, is indicative of a positive association of Y107H with cancer (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0387; Supplementary Table\u00a0S2).

Transcriptionally, Y107H is able to regulate the majority of canonical p53 target genes, with the exception of a small subset of genes, including PADI4. We determined PADI4 to be one of only two shared p53 targets impaired for transactivation in heterozygous LCLs from three different hypomorphs that are each associated with increased cancer incidence (Y107H, P47S, and G334R). We recently reported that the other p53 target, PLTP, also shows tumor-suppressive function (40). Interestingly, PADI4 transactivation appears to be impaired in several other p53 hypomorphic variants as well, suggesting that this gene may be one of the most sensitive target genes to p53 functional status. We found that this gene is transactivated at somewhat late time points following p53 induction (24 hours), and that both WT and Y107H had quite a low affinity for the PADI4 p53 response element. Intriguingly, unlike most p53 transcriptional targets, PADI4 expression is restricted largely to hematopoietic cells, with limited expression in the lung and the brain (41), and de novo expression in some cancers (42). Additionally, whereas many p53 target genes contain two p53 response elements, typically located in the promoter and first intron, PADI4 has only a single p53 response element located in the intron (36). These attributes may explain the delayed induction by p53 and/or the sensitivity of this gene to hypomorphic p53 function; this remains to be formally tested.\nAlthough PADI4 has been identified as a bona fide p53 target gene, there remains a lack of consensus on the role of PADI4 in cancer. Previous studies have suggested PADI4 to be tumor promoting (43, 44), and it can be found to be overexpressed in some human tumors (37). PADI4 is implicated in the promotion of pluripotency (45, 46) and can positively regulate the transcriptional response by HIF1 (47). Conversely, others have found that PADI4 suppresses tumor colony formation (36), promotes apoptosis (20), inhibits stemness in breast cancer through repression of Nanog and Oct4 (48), and inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via citrullination of GSK3\u03b2 (49, 50). There is a similar lack of consensus on the impact of PADI4 on p53: Whereas one group has shown that PADI4 enhances p53 growth suppression and p53 targets (51, 52), others have shown that PADI4 inhibits the p53-mediated transcription of genes such as CDKN1A (38, 53, 54). Here, we show in multiple cancer types that PADI4 can suppress colony formation. We find very low levels of PADI4 in most cancer cell lines tested, contrary to previous reports. Simultaneous observation of tumor growth in both PADI4 KO and PADI4 overexpression clones using the CRISPR activation system revealed that PADI4 clearly has tumor suppressor function. Our data also support the premise that PADI4 overexpression highly activates a subset of p53 target genes associated with immune signaling. However, because PADI4 can citrullinate both histones and other target proteins such as NPM1, GSK3\u03b2, and others, it seems likely that the impact of PADI4 on tumor suppression will rely on key target proteins and cell-type specificity. The critical role of PADI4 in the creation of NETs, which can positively affect tumor growth (55), will almost certainly add to the complexity of the role for PADI4 in tumor suppression. We envision at least two possibilities underlying the immune-mediated\ntumor-suppressive role of PADI4: The first is that PADI4 is believed to citrullinate some tumor antigens and increase immune recognition; consistent with this, activating SNPs in PADI4 are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (56). The second hypothesis is that p53 and PADI4 cooperate in the transactivation of genes involved in the p53, JAK/STAT, IL8, CXCR4, or innate immune pathways, thus increasing immune recognition of tumors (Fig.\u00a0 6I\u2013K; ref.\u00a0 57). These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Overall, our data best fit with a model whereby PADI4 possesses both p53-dependent and p53- independent tumor suppressor function, and the majority of PADI4 tumor suppressor function is immune-mediated.\nOur group continues to show that we can successfully identify compounds that show enhanced efficacy in tumors with p53 hypomorphs compared with WT p53. We previously showed enhanced cytotoxicity of cisplatin and BRD2/4 inhibitors in E1A/Ras-generated P47S tumors compared with matched WT controls (33, 58, 59). In the present work, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create two independent homozygous clones of Y107H in the human colorectal line HCT116, and we identified two different glutaminase inhibitors as preferentially cytotoxic in Y107H clones compared with WT. Others have found that p53 regulates the sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors\u2014in one case through p53-mediated transactivation of SLC1A3, an aspartate/glutamate transporter (60), and in another case through transactivation of SLC7A3, an arginine importer (61). In our WT and Y107H clones, we failed to see differences in the level of SLC1A3 (Fig.\u00a05H), so we instead analyzed the ATF4/CHOP pathway, and we see evidence for increased ATF4 and CHOP in the Y107H clones, along with increased markers of cell death. Importantly, this increase in cell death in Y107H clones is recapitulated in our Y107H tumors treated with CB-839 (Fig.\u00a05F). We also see increased cell death in two clones of P47S in the HCT116 background (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 S6I). At present, the role of PADI4 in the sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors is consistent, but we are unclear as to the mechanism; one possibility that awaits testing is a potential role of amino acid metabolism given the role of PADI4 in arginine/citrulline ratios. In summary, we continue to show that we can provide potentially efficacious treatment options for individuals with germline genetic hypomorphic variants of p53. We also continue to show that genetic differences in the p53 pathway are a possible contributor to cancer disparities in African-descent individuals. And finally, we highlight the premise that understanding the functional defects in biologically relevant hypomorphic variants has the potential to identify key target genes for p53-mediated tumor suppression."

A plasmid was graciously provided by Stewart Loh (Upstate Medical University) for the expression of WT p53 residues 94\u2013312 (the DBD; pET-23+ vector, no tags on p53). A Y107H missense mutation was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid (mutant or WT) was freshly transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (NEB), and a single colony was used to inoculate an overnight starter culture in TB media. This culture was then used to inoculate the main culture at a 1:100 dilution.

Structure solution was conducted by molecular replacement with Phaser (73) using a search model from a previously determined p53 structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1TSR]. The top solution was obtained in the space group P21212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Refinement and manual model building were conducted with Phenix (74) and Coot (75), respectively. Disordered side chains were truncated to the point for which electron density could be observed at a 1.00 sigma level.

The structure of p53-Y107H contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit and adopts a fold typically observed for p53 constructs. Although the protein was crystallized in the presence of inhibitor SM26.1 and DNA, no electron density consistent with this compound or DNA was observed. A search of the PDB revealed one p53 structure with similar unit cell parameters (PDB 4IBY), which is that of a double mutant form R273H/S240R.

The Liu (84) and Hugo (85) datasets were downloaded from cBioPortal (86). We selected genes with impaired transactivation in Y107H, cells whose expression levels are highly correlated with PADI4 levels across TCGA cancer types. For every cancer type, we created 100 bootstrap sample sets (using 60% of the samples in each set) to correlate PADI4 expression with that of genes with impaired transactivation in Y107H, using Spearman rank correlation. We selected four genes with the highest average correlation coefficient across different cancer types, CEACAM21, IL16, S1PR4, and IL21R. We defined a five-gene score by the average expression level (z-score transformed) of PADI4 and the four correlates of PADI4 impaired by Y107H. The five-gene score was correlated with survival across TCGA cancer types and in the Liu and Hugo melanoma anti\u2013PD-1 datasets through log-rank through the Python lifelines package (v0.26.4; ref.\u00a087), defining the median level of the five-gene score as a threshold.

Out of 9,080 TCGA patients with clinical information, four are heterozygous for the Y107H variant, of which three are African Americans. Eight hundred and two are African Americans in the complete population. Therefore, there is an enrichment of Y107H in African-descent populations with P\u00a0=\u00a00.0026.

Unpaired two-tailed Student t test was used to calculate the P values for two-group comparisons of tumor volume changes from baseline at the end of follow-up, relative mRNA expression levels, ChIP-qPCR, colony suppression, or quantitative evaluation of IHC staining. Kaplan\u2013 Meier survival analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 9 with the log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. Densitometric measurements for quantification of immunoblot bands were done with the gel analysis software ImageJ and normalized to loading controls. Mouse experiments were not performed in a blinded manner. The\nfollowing designations for levels of significance are used within this article: *, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; **, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; ***, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; **** P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; ns, not significant."
