 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Explore different cross-validation strategies for splitting the data in ULF beyond just splitting by signatures. For example, splitting by different groups of labeling functions or using iterative stratification. This could help improve performance on datasets with many noisy labeling functions. 

2. Apply ULF to other weakly supervised learning tasks beyond text classification, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. This would demonstrate the broader applicability of the method.

3. Combine ULF with active learning strategies to further reduce the amount of unlabeled data needed. The most confident unlabeled samples corrected by ULF could be selected for manual annotation.

4. Develop theoretical understandings of when and why ULF is most effective. For example, relating its performance to properties of the labeling functions and data distribution. 

5. Design better evaluation protocols and metrics for weakly supervised learning methods like ULF. Things like label quality metrics, robustness checks, and statistical significance testing could reveal deeper insights.
