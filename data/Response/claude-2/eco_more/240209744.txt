 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop tests for Granger causality in other distributional features beyond quantiles, such as expectiles or higher moments. The framework could potentially be extended to test for Granger causality in these alternative distributional features.

2. Consider time-varying coefficient models where the parameters follow a stochastic process rather than having discrete breaks. The tests could be adapted to allow for a wider range of time variation in the parameters.

3. Extend the framework to panel data settings with multiple cross-sectional units. This could allow for testing Granger causality in panels with parameter instability.

4. Apply the methods to additional empirical examples in macroeconomics and finance to further demonstrate their usefulness. More applications would highlight the value of the robust tests. 

5. Investigate the theoretical properties of the tests under weaker conditions. The assumptions could potentially be relaxed, for example by allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity in the errors. This may expand the applicability of the tests.
