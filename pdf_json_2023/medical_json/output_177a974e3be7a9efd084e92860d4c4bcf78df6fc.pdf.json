    "abstractText": "Land relations in the Mekong Region are marked by the densely populated and intensively cultivated lowlands and the more extensive settlement and cultivation areas in the uplands. Land-use changes in the lowlands and uplands are interlinked and are a key process of agrarian and environmental transition. The \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach is introduced as a qualitative analysis combining integrated landscape approaches, governance and rights-based approaches, while underlining the centrality of legitimate tenure rights, limitations and obligations. This approach is used to analyze the impact of the Green Revolution and the global commodity boom, in particular the growth of rubber and coffee, on sustainability in the Mekong countries, i.e., Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam. The way forward points to the use of the elements of the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach to re-valuate the potential contribution of smallholder farmers to the wider physical and societal landscape. The ultimate goal is to go from transition to transformation toward a more secure, equitable future for those at risk of being excluded from effective access to, use of, and control over land, fisheries, forests and water resources, which are providing the basis for their livelihoods if the concession model of land-based investments were to be continued.",

            "text": "Land relations in the Mekong Region are sharply marked by a contrast between the lowlands and uplands, between the densely populated and intensively cultivated delta and coastal areas, and more extensive settlement and cultivation in the hilly and mountainous interior. Decisions over who gets access to land, fisheries, forests and water resources, for how long, and under what conditions, i.e., decisions over tenure, have important implications for people\u2019s livelihoods. This is particularly true for rural households. Around 68 percent of the population in the region is rural, comprising smallholder farmers that execute most of the agricultural production. Women constitute around half of the agricultural labor force. This means that millions of people depend on access to farmland and rangelands, fisheries (inland water and aquaculture), and forests for their livelihoods. It is the diverse livelihoods of local people, based on the everyday use of multiple resources, which crucially connects land, fisheries, forests and water resources [1]. The concurrence of rapid, widespread and profoundly uneven processes of intertwined social and environmental transition, often at large scales, has severe consequences for people and ecosystems, which characterize current resource systems [2]. The manner in which people use land, fisheries, forests and water resources is, however, not immutable [3]. Wider socioeconomic transitions are changing land relations, both within and between local communities [4]. These communities are facing challenges in meeting growing and\nSustainability 2023, 15, 1773. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15031773 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nchanging human demands. The consequences of climate change, impacts of natural disasters, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food supply systems, resource-related conflicts, international and national migration, urbanization and resource degradation and/or depletion all manifest themselves in visible changes in large tracks of the Earth\u2019s surface. To design effective strategies to address sustainability challenges and rural poverty, an understanding of land use and its changes is vital [5]. The occurring land-use changes have many faces. Land-use change is a key process of agrarian and environmental transition [6]. Such land-use changes take place at the plot or parcel level over short time periods and may combine to form complex structural processes taking place over broader extents (e.g., landscapes, regions, across countries, etc.) and longer time scales [7]. Central to understanding land-use changes is the understanding of land users with their land-use rights, limitations and obligations. Consequently, the responsible governance of tenure is important, and it is important to practice it in ways that reflect the interests of rural households and ensure that people are able to exercise and enjoy their land-use rights. The focus of this paper is on the agrarian and environmental transition and its implications for sustainability in the Mekong Region (limited in this paper to Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar (until 1 February 2021), and Viet Nam). The ongoing socio-economic transitions are jeopardizing the diverse livelihoods of local people, which depend on effective access to, use of, and control over land, fisheries, forests and water resources. There is widespread consensus on the need to protect their tenure security in the context of these transitions and that such protection should address both legally protected tenure rights and socially recognized tenure systems (i.e., customary tenure systems). Strengthening tenure security thus aims to strengthen the livelihoods of those who depend on land, fisheries, forests and water resources for their food security and constitute key custodians to ensure more sustainable natural resource management. However, attention to secure tenure is often not placed within the landscape in which local people exercise their tenure rights. Transitions that affect one part of the landscape may have repercussions elsewhere in the landscape or even further away. The interlinkages between what happens in the different parts of the landscape and its impacts are usually missing from research on securing peoples\u2019 tenure rights. Socio-economic transitions can also open up new opportunities away from traditional agriculture on a limited land basis that is characteristic of the rural poor, such as meeting the demand for high-value crops and animal products required by the growing urban markets. Additionally, greater biodiversity conservation and carbon capture and improved environmental planning and management offer opportunities [8,9]. Furthermore, it is surprising that limited understanding exists of the governing mechanisms that determine major transitions in complex and dynamical systems, such as ecosystems and societies, and the responses to such transitions at the landscape level [9]. Understanding such transitions and their dynamics may open up new ways of managing a transformation toward more inclusive and sustainable systems. Agrarian and environmental transitions are challenging, complex processes involving different biophysical conditions across space and time, with multiple stakeholders interacting through a variety of land uses and tenure arrangements across different geographies. Our hypothesis is that the agrarian and environmental transitions and changing land relations in the Mekong Region, and especially the impacts on sustainability, should be analyzed, taking tenure aspects behind the land-use changes and thereby contributing to a more holistic approach at the landscape level to a better understanding of these transitions, the so-called \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach. First, this paper introduces the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach (Section 2), a qualitative methodology aimed to better understand transitions and changing land relations with a focus on the landscape. The type of agrarian and environmental transition in the Mekong Region will be examined using the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach for the Green Revolution and the global commodity boom that both had extensive impacts on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Re-\npublic, Myanmar and Viet Nam (Section 3). The impact will be illustrated in more detail with two global commodity boom crops, i.e., rubber and coffee (Section 4). Understanding the role and contribution of transitions to development is critical to inform policy and practice toward a more sustainable future. A better understanding of the impact of transitions and links to transformation can foster positive dialogue and joint planning and decision-making. This is followed by a discussion (Section 5) and the way forward, indicating various pathways to influence policy and practice to move toward a more secure, equitable future in which a change from transition to transformation is needed to achieve sustainability (Section 6). By focusing on the Mekong Region in agrarian and environmental transition using the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach for assessing the impact of transition on the landscape, land-use systems, and smallholder farmers as land users, this paper will furnish entry points that are equally valid in other parts of the world."

            "text": "This paper, which is part of a series on implementation of tenure governance (see also [10\u201312]), focuses on the question of how agrarian and environmental transition in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam during the Green Revolution and the global commodity boom influenced the landscape, land-use systems, land users, and their legitimate tenure rights. To better understand the complex reality of agrarian and environmental transitions, the qualitative methodology is used to explore tenure governance over the period 1956\u20132022, with an emphasis on the period of the late 1990s until the present. A comparative case analysis is provided of the Green Revolution and the global commodity boom. Each had its own context, characteristics and corresponding purpose. We provide an application of the conceptual \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach (explained in Section 2.2), demonstrating its value as an analysis tool and an aid to critical analysis of two transitions at the landscape level. The \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach allows us to explore questions of which parts of the landscape are affected by the transitions and the relation to other parts of the landscape (e.g., lowlands versus uplands), governance and right-based approaches with the roles of \u2018right holder\u2019 and \u2018duty bearer\u2019, and legitimate tenure rights (e.g., user rights, control and decisionmaking rights). Legitimate tenure rights also comprise limitations and obligations that are key to the sustainability of resources, the management of the landscape and planning with full respect for human rights. The methodology entails purposive selection of the two transitions, purposive choice of rubber and coffee within the global commodity boom and qualitative, informed comparative transitions analysis. The use of this selection on purpose is prone to research bias. Our analysis benefits from practical knowledge and in-depth engagement in the Mekong Region from 2014 until 2022. Sources of evidence include documentation of activities at the national and regional levels. The descriptive data come from first-hand observations, note-taking, focus groups, and informal exchanges with participants of 35 workshops, 4 missions, and 9 capacity development activities in the period 2014\u20132022 at regional, national and sub-national levels in the Mekong Region, Thailand and Japan, as well as 4 studies (see Appendix ?? for more information) and the study of the existing literature. Online data collection took place from March 2020 to mid-2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of extensive sources of literature serves as (background) information about the transitions. With this wealth of available data sources, it is hoped to avoid bias as much as possible. The selected methodology also allowed us to go to the persons affected by the transition processes in their natural setting for data collection rather than going through inventories or questionnaires. The methodology also applies inductive reasoning, where experiences, observations and lessons learned are synthesized to formulate recommendations for the way forward.\nIn the analysis, our aim is to highlight the findings that are the most salient for the two transitions in relation to the elements of the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach. We focus in particular on integrated landscapes approaches, governance and rights-based approaches, and legitimate tenure rights, limitations and obligations. These are described in more detail in the next section."

            "text": "The combined use of integrated landscape approaches, governance and rights-based approaches, while underlining the centrality of legitimate tenure rights, limitations and obligations, is the developed conceptual approach, which has been named the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach. Integrated landscape approaches, governance and rights-based approaches, and the centrality of tenure rights, limitations and obligations come with the greatest benefits when they are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. Though each is significant on its own, the three are closely intertwined and interact with and influence each other. Their combined use in the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach to examine agrarian and environmental transitions underlines that resources, their uses, and their users are interconnected and should be dealt with concurrently in an integrated manner to achieve sustainability.\n2.2.1. Integrated Landscape Approaches\nThe transitions and changing land relations will not be determined on global or even national scales but rather across landscapes in which different objectives interact and often compete, ecosystem processes unfold, decisions impinge on other interests, and emergent properties of aggregated land-use patterns are realized [13]. The impacts on the landscape from different changes intersect by affecting the people and communities in specific places; these changes are interactive because of how villagers\u2019 livelihood strategies and resource management practices eventually change in response to transitions [1]. Understanding current and past environmental and agrarian transitions thus benefits from incorporating place-based, landscape-based analysis. Landscape approaches offer a process to steer the development of landscapes toward desirable futures. The use of the word \u2018landscape\u2019 implies social and physical landscapes. If we do not only consider landscape-based analysis but integrated landscape approaches that offer opportunities to conceptualize the complex relations between land, fisheries, forests and water resources, their uses, as well as the stakeholder dynamics within multifunctional landscapes, these can help to better understand the ecological, socio-cultural, and economic dynamics of the landscapes, i.e., the dimensions of sustainability, and comprehend how their dynamics have changed over time. Recognizing landscapes not only as geographically defined places but also as networked spaces helps in understanding why landscapes are influenced by global drivers of production, consumption and development and how they are impacted by global challenges of climate change, the impacts of natural disasters and health threats on food supply systems, resource-related conflicts, and migration (Figure 1). This with the understanding that the negative effects of global trends, such as climate change, urbanization and international migration, should not fall disproportionately on those who lack the resources to cope and recover. Understanding landscape dynamics facilitates more strategic operation within global commodity chains, policy processes and actor networks [14].\n2.2.2. Governance and Right-Based Approaches Truly inclusive landscapes depend on the quality of the overall governance context, the law and policy frameworks, the level of devolution of spatial planning and the capacity of stakeholders to take up new roles and responsibilities that multi-stakeholder transformational governance requires [11]. Poor governance has been identified as a potential obstacle to integrated landscape approaches. Thus, integrated landscape approaches and governance are interlinked and mutually reinforce each other. A rights-based approach addresses the existing and the desired roles and responsibilities of individuals, communities, companies, societies and states in relation to each other, and in relation to the environment, for example, a landscape, that they share. It helps raise the ambition of stakeholder dialogue and partnerships, helps in setting benchmarks, and develops checks-and-balances for accountability, and should therefore be an intrinsic part of an inclusive, integrated landscape approach [14]. Thus, integrated landscape approaches and right-based approaches can mutually reinforce one another regarding stakeholder relations and dynamics. Rights-based approaches have been developed that establish a normative framework to positively transform power relations among stakeholders, sharing a common basis in the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They emphasize the relation between \u2018right holders\u2019 and \u2018duty bearers\u2019; thus, stakeholder relations can be seen as rights-duties relations with interdependencies and creating mechanisms and processes of mutual accountability. It is important to appreciate that \u2018right-holder\u2019 and \u2018duty-bearer\u2019 are roles into which individuals or groups may enter [15]. A multi-stakeholder approach implies an iterative, flexible and highly inclusive process in which the concerns and aspirations of identified stakeholders in a landscape need to be the subject of an ongoing dialogue that is developed and nurtured with mutual respect. This dialogue will address conflicts and issues of trust and power, if and when appropriate. The link between right-based approaches and landscape approaches is rooted in environmental rights thinking, in which the right to conserve and protect is equally important as the right to access and sustainably use [14].

A multi-stakeholder approach implies an iterative, flexible and highly inclusive process in which the concerns and aspirations of identified stakeholders in a landscape need to be the subject of an ongoing dialogue that is developed and nurtured with mutual respect. This dialogue will address conflicts and issues of trust and power, if and when appropriate. The link between right-based approaches and landscape approaches is rooted in environmental rights thinking, in which the right to conserve and protect is equally important as the right to access and sustainably use [14]. Issues related to rights in the landscape arise whenever there is uncertainty, inequality or ambiguity on the distribution of rights to access, use and control la d, fisheries, forests and water resources. Rights-based integrated\nlandscape approaches, including governance, entail (re-)establishing negotiated rules for the allocation of rights over resource access and use, strengthening access to justice, access to legal knowledge, multi-stakeholder partnerships and dialogues and accountability systems prior to any policy initiative [14]. One of the merits of a right-based approach is that it is a useful entry point to address the power imbalances that exclude some people from access to land, fisheries, forests and water to a secure livelihood. A right-based approach can help to focus on the accountability of formal and informal institutions, which are part of governance, to ensure inclusiveness and effectiveness in issues relevant to people\u2019s livelihoods.\n2.2.3. Centrality of Tenure Rights, Limitations and Obligations\nCommonly referenced tenure rights, the so-called \u2018bundle of rights\u2019, include two groups of rights: (1) access, withdrawal and transferability (the user rights) and (2) management, exclusion and alienation (the control or decision-maker rights) [14,16], and due process and compensation in the event of expropriation [17,18]. This bundle of rights is related to the bundle of power [19], as power relations are inherent to legitimate rights. Tenure rights are central to addressing power imbalances between people through rights-based approaches. In FAO [17] (p. iv), the preface uses \u2018access\u2019 in the following manner: \u201cHow people, communities and others gain access to land, fisheries and forests is defined and regulated by societies through systems of tenure\u201d. Thus, \u2018access\u2019 follows the classical definition of \u201cthe right to benefit from things\u201d rather than \u201cthe ability to derive benefits from things\u201d as formulated by Ribot and Peluso [19]. Tenure evokes some kind of socially acknowledged and supported claim or right, whether acknowledged by law (de jure), custom (de facto), or convention [19]. However, there are a number of mechanisms other than legal rights at play in shaping \u2018access\u2019 (e.g., access to technology, capital, markets, labor, knowledge, authority, identity and social relations) that can constrain or enable people to benefit from resources without focusing on tenure relations alone. The merits of Ribot and Peluso\u2019s framework are primarily the conceptual shift away from a prime focus on legal rights [20]. FAO [17] (p. 3) follows this shift away by using the term \u2018legitimate\u2019 tenure rights, which is explained as \u201cnot only those tenure rights formally recognized by national law, but also those rights that, while not currently protected by law are considered to be socially legitimate in local societies\u201d [21] (pp. 19\u201325). Legitimate tenure rights do not only comprise rights but also limitations and obligations that are key to the sustainable uses of land, fisheries, forests and water resources, landscape management and spatial planning with the full respect of human rights [14]. For grasping existing legitimate rights issues within a landscape, it is important to acknowledge the right holders that are at the start of a chain of rights, limitations and obligations and who are at play within a landscape and assess their position within the debate. They are the stakeholders who are most vulnerable to infringement of their rights by transitions and who need to be protected [14]. Transitions relate to reciprocal relations between nature and society. Reciprocity is a key factor affecting governance decisions among local resource users [22]. It is embedded in the premise that one cannot take without giving; thus, nature\u2013society relations co-constitute one another and focus on nature\u2013society dynamics. Putting emphasis on reciprocal dynamic relations broadens our understanding of processes that enable people to have access to, use of, and control over resources for the benefit of both nature and society, i.e., including non-economic benefits inherent to nature\u2013society relations. Though the concept was originally developed in the context of governing the commons and related to resource users and later further developed to reciprocal relationships between people and the environment [23], the same concept could be modified for application of all resource uses under legal and customary tenure systems at the landscape level as part of the tenure limitations or obligations. It is also linked to governance because of calls for a change in governance policy and practice that moves beyond the singular focus on human-centric\neconomic benefits. It would therefore place more emphasis on the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability, while less emphasis is placed on monetary economic benefits. The use of reciprocal relations as part of tenure limitations and obligations to describe nature\u2013society connections underlines the two-way flow of benefits and (mutual) responsibilities. Reciprocal relations arise from ongoing multi-faceted interactions between people and places, just as people develop relationships through collaborative activities with one another [23]. Another important element is that newcomers in a landscape should be able to create reciprocal relationships and that these are not limited to people already living in the landscape. The link to integrated landscape approaches can be made by taking the landscape as the unit in which real cultural practices \u2018on the ground\u2019 are embedded [24], there are vertical and horizontal aspects of the interplay of tenure rights, limitations and obligations under legal and customary tenure systems [2]. Horizontal relations operate between private individuals or groups, whereas bundles of rights and obligations in natural resource governance also affect vertical relations between private actors and public authorities. Public authorities often play a central role in spatial or land-use planning and territorial development, setting parameters that can affect the exercise of privately held rights [25]. Many customary systems also vest traditional authorities with considerable power, empowering them to allocate resources and collect resource revenues. These public governance dimensions are reflected in rights, limitations and obligations that can affect tenure right holders\u2019 opportunities to influence public decision-making and to hold authorities to account [2].\n2.2.4. \u2018Tenure-Scape\u2019 Approach\nThe combination and integration of using integrated landscape approaches, governance and rights-based approaches, while underlining the centrality of legitimate tenure rights, limitations and obligations, is what we would like to call the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach (Figure 2). This nexus approach stems from the importance of understanding connections, synergies and trade-offs between landscapes, governance and legitimate tenure rights [26]. The nexus approach allows the analysis of these interlinkages (among sectors, across scales, within the landscape, and between the landscape and further places), as well as synergies and trade-offs between changing land relations, and it promotes integrated planning, management and governance. The Green Revolution and global commodity boom have not been addressed in a holistic manner, and while they solved or reduced one problem (e.g., availability of staple foods or commodities), they exacerbated others (e.g., water availability and quality). Working at the landscape level allows the integration of socio-economic and environmental processes to make the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach applicable to the real world. Taking a \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach allows a holistic view recognizing that land, fisheries, forestry and water resources and their uses are interconnected and place-based. This means that an integrated and sustainable approach to their administration is needed, keeping in mind that multi-level planning and decision-making is particularly demanding and needs to consider the relationships (e.g., power relations) between and within multiple levels, as well as the socially constructed spaces and the biophysical conditions [27]. For example, at the Mekong regional level, local actors and processes, national laws and global conditions (e.g., competition for natural resources) are involved. Disputes and conflicts over tenure rights are often a sign revealing feedback to national and global actor constellations (e.g., who of the many actors has access to resources?). The success of governance processes at one of the levels is dependent upon relationships with other levels (referring to national laws and formal and informal institutions, and legal obligations under international law). However, the national level retains an essential function concerning the implementation of (soft) law instruments related to tenure and investment. The \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach also deals with different perspectives of the actors, rather than different data layers, and enables moving away from a static recording of tenure rights to the dynamics of the whole system and examining properties such as resilience and transition pathways [28,29]. The visible changes on the earth\u2019s surface are intrinsically related to the tenure system and the various\nactors in it and are determined by human behavior. This is integrated into the concept of \u2018landscape\u2019, the realm of human-environmental interaction and expression (including biotic and abiotic elements and societal forms of utilization).

            "text": "In the past decades in the Mekong Region, agriculture has been moving from subsistence- riented to arket-based forms of land use [30]. This led to agricultural intensification, notably the 1956\u20131990 Green R volution in Asia focusing on production increase for staple food self-sufficiency (e.g., maize, ric and wheat), and territorial expansion in t e landscapes with impacts o biodiversity and agrodiversity. This Green Revolution increased agricultural productivity by driving the adoption of high-yield varieties of staple\nfood and sharply increasing the use of agricultural inputs (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer) that have created the defining features of not only the Mekong but the Asian food systems today [31\u201333]. The Green Revolution represented the first major transition in the agriculture sector in Asia in its modern history [31]. The Green Revolution can be regarded as a so-called \u2018tipping point\u2019: a point in a system where targeted interventions lead to large and long-term consequences on the evolution of that system, thereby profoundly altering its modes of operation [34\u201336]. Other scientists define a tipping point as \u201c[a] level of change in system properties beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly, and does not return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated\u201d [37] (p. 559).\n3.1.1. Landscape: The Opportunity of Irrigation\nChanges in the intensity of the cropping systems could be observed at the landscape level, showing intensified land relations in particular areas. The fact that participation in the Green Revolution required sufficient and controlled irrigation limited it mainly to lowland areas or areas where terracing could be executed, thus widening the disparities between the countries\u2019 rich and poor areas [1], thus between the lowlands and the uplands. The Green Revolution did not take an integrated landscape approach because it was geared toward specific production landscapes dominated by a few staple foods. It thus did not conceptualize the relations between these production areas with fisheries and forests resources or the dynamics of multiple functions within the landscape. The Green Revolution also led to integration into more market-based economies with increased cross-border trade, investments and labor mobility. Thus, farmers growing the Green Revolution staple foods became part of wider actor networks. Such processes happened in the Mekong Region at diverse paces because not all areas benefited equally; in particular, countries transitioning from socialism to liberalism lagged behind and those affected by civil conflicts, as well as remote areas. Consequently, the context of agrarian and environmental transition varied across the region and across different scales [38], from the farming household to a process of political and economic regionalization and globalization [39].\n3.1.2. Governance: Policy, Research and Development\nThe institutional arrangements, policy and legal frameworks were conducive to the Green Revolution by supporting government policies, scientific research and the agri-food sector increased yields for a few major staple crops to provide enough calories for a growing and more urbanized population. Through a combination of research and development, subsidies and innovations in seeds, fertilizers and irrigation, agricultural output grew steadily. The capacity of farmers to take up new varieties and intensify their production system with the use of inputs was stimulated and supported. The roles and responsibilities of government, farmer or producer organizations\u2014when existent\u2014and farmers in relation to each other were clear. Especially where farmers were required to produce preset quotas of rice as part of their land-use rights, the roles of \u2018right-holder\u2019 and \u2018duty-bearer\u2019 were clear.\n3.1.3. Tenure: Centrality of Formal Tenure Arrangements\nThe farmers were clearly having user rights out of the \u2018bundle of rights\u2019, whereas the state was having control or decision-maker rights. The roles and responsibilities to the wider environment they shared were less clear. Farmers\u2019 access was not shaped by landuse rights alone but also by having access to other mechanisms, such as new technology, modern inputs (machinery, fertilizers, pesticides), knowledge, etc. Reciprocal relations between nature and society suffered because of the narrow focus of the Green Revolution on production areas for staple food. There was little or no regard that nature\u2013society relations co-constitute one another. The high-yielding varieties and used machinery increased the farmers\u2019 production and income but had, in time, far-reaching consequences for man\u2013land relations. The areas targeted by the Green Revolution were usually areas where formal tenure relations were\npresent (e.g., land-use rights) that mostly continued to exist [40], with the exception that landowners found it in their interest to change to self-management and dismissed their tenants. Cultivation was executed in a more business-like manner, resulting in increased land and labor productivity. Because the economies were booming at the time, they absorbed most of the dismissed tenants. Larger-scale farmers tried to use their resources to participate in modern forms of agriculture. Labor relations, traditionally regulated by customs and involving mutual responsibilities, have changed to contractual relations. In conclusion, the Green Revolution is considered a successful transition, although it came with hidden costs to the environment, health, economy and society (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, degraded soils, loss of agrodiversity and biodiversity). Not all of these hidden costs were immediately felt. Such food and land-use system transitions, as well as future ones, involve both intentional (e.g., increased land and labor productivity, increased land-use intensity) and unintentional changes, as well as unintended consequences (e.g., agrodiversity and biodiversity loss), and different actors often have different intents. The achievement of the Green Revolution in raising food production and productivity, broadening economic growth and reducing poverty has, however, been impressive. More recently, however, agricultural production is experiencing a number of challenges that have cast doubts on the sustainability of such past gains [31]. The above analysis of the Green Revolution with the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach is summarized in Table 1."

            "text": "Rapid economic and income growth, urbanization and globalization are leading to a significant shift in diet in Asia, away from staples and increasingly toward livestock and dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and fats and oils. Income growth is a key factor in the increasing domestic demand for high-value agricultural products, as well as the increasing export demand [31].\n3.2.1. Landscape: Geographic Location and Impact of Land-Based Investments\nAfter the Green Revolution, a pronounced trend emerged since the late 1990s with an increase in large-scale land-based investments (e.g., mainly in the form of concessions), especially around 2006, in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam, with Thailand being the exception. The government sought to leverage land deemed underutilized to attract financial resources for development. The rationale is that\ngranting concessions in exchange for financial investment is necessary to turn unused land into capital, increase the production of export commodities, and stimulate local development [41]. Consequently, agricultural production has expanded by 9 million hectares, or around 21 percent, from 1996 to 2015 [41,42]. The regional and transboundary dynamics rather than global driving forces, such as the 2008\u20132009 food, fuel and financial crisis, seem to be the driving forces in the increase in land-based investments. The Mekong countries comprise an economically and geographically strategic location, which goes beyond the landscape level and national boundaries, between two BRIC countries (i.e., China and India), various \u2018tiger economies\u2019 (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea) where the population is increasing and self-sufficiency in rice and other agricultural products for human consumption is likely to dwindle [30], and the so-called \u2018cub economies\u2019, i.e., the young Asian tigers, with recent rapid economic growth (e.g., Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines). The location of the Mekong countries with respect to Japan should also not be overlooked. Furthermore, China (1.4 billion), India (1.4 billion) and Indonesia (270 million) belong to the most populated countries in the world; Southeast Asia is the third most populous world region (662 million people in 2019, with projected 794 million in 2050) (all figures from https: //www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Population%20Data%20Sheet%202019.pdf, accessed on 2 July 2021). Integration into the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the foreseen Asian Economic Community and membership to the World Trade Organization, plus infrastructure development projects (e.g., hydroelectric power; construction of the North-South Economic Corridor connecting Kunming to Bangkok through Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic), link the Mekong countries to their neighbors. Historical trade routes by sea from China to India via the Mekong Region, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as routes over land, have linked the countries and their cultures for many centuries [43]. The route from southwestern China along the Mekong River traditionally served as a migration pathway out of China into neighboring countries (e.g., Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Thailand) [44]. The demand for land has increased because of the global commodity boom. Southeast Asia is one of the world\u2019s hot spots for industrial agriculture and tree plantation development. However, the extent and intensity of these land-based investments represent a new trend. In addition, there is pressure on land, fisheries, forest, mineral and water resources resulting from investments in forestry, mining and tourism. The assumption behind the promotion of large-scale industrial-type agricultural production based on regularized wage labor arrangements by the policy and legal frameworks is that it takes advantage of economies of scale, but this is built on insufficiently questioned assumptions that it would be better for other options [1]. The policy and legal frameworks related to land-based investments in the four countries are discussed in detail by De Andrade and Jansen [45] and will not be discussed in detail here. Apart from land concessions, Special Economic Zones and Cross-Border Economic Zones have been created by land expropriation. Ingalls et al. [41] estimate that there are more than 400 Special Economic Zones across the Mekong Region that are largely concentrated along the economic corridors of the Greater Mekong Sub-region. Land-based investments open a new chapter in the redistribution of power across an increasingly multi-centric global food system with rising agro-export powers in middleincome countries [46]. Therefore, policy and decision-makers in the Mekong Region need to take the context beyond the national borders into account [47]. Foreign investors in the Mekong Region come mainly from China, Viet Nam, Thailand and South Korea. They account for 36 percent of total concessions in Cambodia and 60 percent in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Viet Nam and Thailand function both as investors in large-scale land deals and importers, processors and exporters of the commodities associated with them. China is, however, the largest end-market for regional exports of agricultural commodities [41].\nThe global commodity boom had more impact on the landscape than the Green Revolution because the growth of the boom crops was stimulated by the development of new large-scale plantations and by smallholder farmers investing in their land in such crops. The expansion of the area of boom crops was largely market driven. The boom was centered around cash crops that could easily be grown in the upland areas in the Mekong Region. The surge in land concessions for boom crops in full swing until 2011 (Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic issued moratoria on new concessions in 2012) added pressure on the natural ecosystems and the rural communities that depend on them (see https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/greater-mekong, accessed on 1 July 2021). Viet Nam took a different pathway because of its higher population density with much more limited land availability to grant concessions. Due to a much higher population density than in the other three countries of the region, the land availability in Vietnam to grant concessions is far more restricted. It is important to understand that appropriate investments in rural areas that stimulate economic growth and raise food availability and income represent one of the main solutions to food insecurity and rural poverty [48]. The cross-border dynamics of boom crops mean that governments face juridical and geopolitical challenges when trying to regulate such developments. Thus, such crops are a challenge for governance [49]. The boom crops have targeted areas considered \u2018resource frontiers\u2019, i.e., areas with low population densities, available land, and underutilized resources [40]. In reality, these areas are occupied by local communities generally practicing subsistence agriculture. Often, members of such communities belong to ethnic minorities who have lived there for generations under customary tenure systems. Having secure tenure rights is pivotal. According to Prindex, perceived tenure insecurity in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam is 35, 25, 17 and 10 percent, respectively (see https://www.prindex.net/data/, accessed on 12 January 2021). The lowest possible score was 10 percent. In the Mekong Region, most smallholder farmers relied primarily on family farming until the acceleration of land-based investments [38]. These land-based investments and the process of agrarian transition can be seen as providing, on the one hand, opportunities to improve existing farming systems and diversification of activities, or on the other hand, they may lead to dispossession of land and natural resources without offering alternative livelihoods. Domestic and agro-business companies are often well-organized actors working closely with governments, whereas smallholder farming families, landless and land-poor people are not that well-organized. Governments could seek to channel agricultural investment into the support of smallholder farming, including strengthening collective action mechanisms (i.e., farmer or producer organizations, cooperatives, etc.). This does not mean maintaining the status quo or preserving subsistence agriculture; it is a way of ensuring that investment will be directed toward ends that are most poverty-reducing [1]. During the global commodity boom, land relations are thus being shaped by the adoption of policies aimed at turning land into capital, creating efficient land markets, and formalizing land access by means of formal titling programs [50], or formal lease agreements with investors. In the Mekong Region, deforestation is mainly commodity-driven, caused by large plantations of crops such as oil palm, rubber, coffee and bananas, though sometimes the driver is shifting cultivation by people in search of agricultural land or short-term cultivation as part of a shifting cultivation system. A tipping point in plantation development could accelerate a shift toward deforestation-free and forest-positive commodity value chains [33]. Important for transition is secure tenure to those actors with influence over forest management (e.g., ethnic minorities and local communities) to ensure the protection of trees and forests. As a result of the large-scale investments, the agrarian structure of the Mekong countries has been considerably transformed [41] and the food security and nutrition situation has been affected. Food insecurity primarily affects the rural poor. The shift from subsistence agriculture to market-oriented production often occurs at the cost of those who are\nunable to maintain their agricultural production, often through land loss (e.g., land sale or dispossession), becoming participants in the labor market. This identifies a territorial divide between countries and within countries [48]. The 2019 State of Food Security and Nutrition Report [51] (p. 98) states that \u201c[t]he greater the inequality in asset distribution such as land, water, capital, finance, education and health, the more difficult it is for the poor to participate in economic growth processes.\u201d The latest data confirm that 90 percent of global deforestation is driven by unsustainable agricultural expansion. This land-use change responds to multiple underlying drivers, including poverty and unsustainable production patterns [52]. It comes as no surprise that, over time, the voices addressing these dimensions are becoming louder and louder. For instance, the European Council agreed on 28 June 2022 to set mandatory due diligence rules for all operators and traders who place, make available, or export the following products to the European Union market: palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa and soy [53]. This is the more remarkable as Europe gained millions of hectares of forests (between 1990\u20132014 around 13 million), but at the same time, the imports of agricultural commodities were responsible for the conversion of millions of hectares of forests into cropland outside Europe (11 million mainly in Brazil and Indonesia) [54].\n3.2.2. Governance: Land Markets and Land Concessions\nTraditionally, in the Mekong Region, smallholder farmers have carried out most of their agricultural production. The increase in land-based investments, a sign of a process of economic and social transition in agriculture, has profound implications for these smallholder farmers [47]. The past decade has shown a swift manifestation of largescale land-based investments in agriculture by both domestic and foreign investors. These investments, mostly affected through (economic) concessions, concern long-term leases granted at low annual costs per hectare. When these land-based investments concern industrial production of agricultural commodities for global biofuel and meat production, ecological risk (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, forest and soil carbon stocks) beyond one\u2019s jurisdiction should be a focus because such practices refer to the expansion of carbonintensive modes of production [1]. Evidence from around the globe shows that such landbased investments, especially large-scale ones, so as to benefit local populations require strong polycentric governance systems with the capacity to manage and monitor such investments over time. In many countries, policy and decision-makers have underestimated the underlying global dynamics and transitions at work. The domestic system was often unprepared in dealing with the consequences of these land-based investments, as shown by moratoria on granting concessions in Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. The four countries have all put various types of limits on granting large-scale concessions for plantation development, although plantation capital may move into other arrangements as a result of contract farming and community or household land leasing [42].\n3.2.3. Tenure: Inequitable Access and Exclusion through \u2018Unused\u2019 Land\nDepending on the source used, around 4.1 to 5.1 million hectares of land have been granted for plantation development, representing in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar 37, 30 and 16 percent, respectively, of the land being cultivated by smallholder farmers [41,42]. The ability of authorities to define land as \u2018unused\u2019 (\u2018idle\u2019 or \u2018vacant\u2019), \u2018underutilized\u2019, \u2018wastelands\u2019 or illegally occupied provides a legitimating power of exclusion [1,46]. Unused or underutilized areas are understood as lands with little or no ecological or economic meaning. This concept reflects an assessment in terms of productivity rather than the existence of resource uses [1]. Such unused or underutilized resources can be distributed to local farming families if they are not already using them as part of customary tenure systems (e.g., fallow areas that are part of a shifting cultivation system) or providing these as concessions under lease contracts to investors for plantation development. Opting for the latter may impede the realization of the right to food of local communities that depend\non access to, use of and control over such resources for their livelihoods. Such exclusion refers to situations in which communities and individuals are displaced. This displacement can occur in legal, peaceful and voluntary ways, but also in illegal, violent and coercive ways [1]. The number of disputes over land increased considerably during the global commodity boom, indicating that nature\u2013society relations were under pressure, people felt left out in planning and decision-making over resources, as well as in recognition of their socially recognized land-use rights. The distribution of assets, such as land, as well as the land rental market, are important factors in rural poverty. This underlines the recognition of the centrality of land to sustainable development by promoting secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries, forests [17], and water. Where there are weak tenure rights and weak enforcement of such rights, inequalities abound [8]. The above analysis of the Green Revolution with the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach is summarized in Table 2. The global commodity boom focused primarily on monetary economic benefits and neglected the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. This makes the global commodity boom very different from the Green Revolution\u2019s focus on staple food crops and global food security."

The choice of rubber and coffee as boom crops is because rubber takes an intermediate position\nbetween boom crops grown only in large-scale production (e.g., oil palm) and boom crops dominated by relatively independent smallholder farmers, such as coffee [40]. In the used literature, it is striking that (integrated) landscape approaches to analyze the impact of commodity boom crops in the Mekong Region are largely absent."

            "heading": "4.1. Rubber Production",
            "text": "The impact of rubber production on the landscapes of Southeast Asia, particularly in the four countries, has been vast. Tree-based boom crops comprise 18 percent of the landscapes in Southeast Asia, a majority of which replaced natural forests (around 70 percent) and low vegetation areas of which part used to be covered by agricultural crops but is lying fallow (around 30 percent). Natural forest areas belong to one of the world\u2019s richest biodiversity regions. Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) is one of the commodity boom crops and it covers around 8 percent of the landscapes [40]. Whereas in Southeast Asia temporary forest clearing is associated with small-scale growth of rubber with less impact on forests, large-scale production of rubber often involves clear-cutting of forest with significant socioecological impact. Such an impact on the landscape cannot be overlooked. Asia is the source of 76 percent of the world\u2019s natural rubber, with Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam producing over 50 percent of natural rubber. It is estimated that the annual consumption of rubber by 2025 will increase by more than 40 percent compared to 2010. This could lead to further expansion involving millions of hectares of new plantations [55]. One million hectares of rubber plantations have been planted in Cambodia, China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam, where rubber was traditionally not grown [42,56]. The biggest regional buyer for natural rubber is China, which is, according to the World Rainforest Movement [55] the world\u2019s leading consumer in rubber. Rubber plantation development has been restricted by Chinese government authorities due to environmental concerns. This situation, combined with cross-border ethnic and commercial ties and increased demand, has led to a rubber boom in the Mekong Region, in particular in northern Lao and Myanmar [57]. Although the large-scale production of rubber is dominant, small-scale production exists. In the Mekong countries, the expansion of rubber in the upland areas is at the expense of shifting cultivation areas and forests. The development of rubber plantations in such areas is characterized by large-scale landbased investments in the form of land concessions, where the investor controls both the land and rubber production, as well as the conversion of land by millions of smallholder farmers. Rubber trees represent an opportunity for smallholder farmers because they can be intercropped on a short rotation, both during the years before tapping and within the context of longer-term agroforestry systems. As such, rubber cultivation may result in increased farming family income and greater resilience in the face of volatile markets. The increased rubber demand is, however, increasingly the reason for land-based investment deals. The small-scale cultivations cover individually relatively limited amounts of land, but taken together, they transformed whole landscapes. There are also interlinkages related to the landscape position of cropping systems. For instance, paddy rice fields are influenced by upland rubber plantations, as the latter influence the water flow to the lowland paddy fields. Thus, communities that are bereaved of upland areas for rubber plantations suffer the loss of more than just land. Some authors refer to \u2018displacements\u2019 of prior land uses, agrarian livelihoods, rural communities and ecosystems [42,58]. The expansion of rubber plantations is a threat to the remaining upland forests and their biodiversity [59], as well as mosaic landscapes with multiple land uses and users.\nThe implications of rubber production in each of the Mekong countries are described below.\n4.1.1. Cambodia\nIn Cambodia, the development of rubber plantations dates back to the early 20th century. The production of rubber has remained important for decades, and it is the second largest agricultural export product in the country. Most rubber plantations are located\nin Kampong Cham, Kratie, Kampong Thom, Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri, Battambang, Preah Vihear and Pailin Provinces. In the 1990s, rubber plantations were reorganized into stateowned companies that were later privatized, together with two private rubber plantations and several smallholder rubber plantations [56]. Most conversions to rubber occurred between 2009 and 2014 [40]. A moratorium for land concessions came into effect in 2012, but companies continued to plant rubber to meet the requirement to use all concession land. A 2019 study by Grogan et al. [60] shows that 23.5 percent of the forest cover in Cambodia, i.e., more than 2.2 million hectares, was converted between 2001 and 2015. Almost a quarter of the deforested area was used for rubber plantations. Around 66 percent of these areas are in the hands of Chinese and Vietnamese companies. A dramatic increase in social and environmental problems occurred associated with land concessions for rubber plantations and other boom crops [58], because villages are struggling to maintain control over access to their community lands and forests\u2014under customary tenure systems\u2014in the face of increasing pressures and conducive government policies to shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture. The focus on large-scale land-based concessions has detracted from other investment models, such as contract farming and outgrower schemes, thereby sidelining smallholder farmers and their potential contribution [56]. The focus on largescale land-based concessions also detracted attention from the impact of plantations on the landscape, the loss of land by communities that depend on access to, control over, and use of natural resources, and the interlinkages between upland and lowland resource use systems. The government has recently put around 65 percent of Cambodia\u2019s forests under the Protected Area system. When rubber prices fell on the international market, rubber was replaced, for instance, with pepper in northeast Cambodia, as farmers tried to diversify.\n4.1.2. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has most closely followed a land concession policy, as has Cambodia. The country experienced considerable expansion in rubber cultivation fueled by market demands (e.g., China) and investor interest. The government has been promoting rubber and cash crops as alternatives to shifting cultivation, as it would like to shift from subsistence agriculture toward more market-oriented commodity production. Most rubber concessions were granted after 2006 [40], and are mainly located in Louang Namtha, Phongsali, Bokeo, Oudomxai and Xaignabouri Provinces in the north. A combination of plantation and smallholder production is found in the center in Vientiane Province, Bholikhamxai and Savannakhet, whereas in the southern provinces large-scale plantations are competing with other land uses (e.g., coffee; see next section). In the northern part of the country, rubber production is dominated by concessions, often granted to Chinese companies, while in the south, large-scale plantations of rubber occur granted to mainly Vietnamese investors [40]. The concession policy, however, soon began to show economic, social and ecological impacts similar to Cambodia. The governance structure in place was not able to deal with consultative planning processes, enforcing existing laws and preventing encroachment on land, resulting in negative impacts for local communities [47]. What began as a modest supplemental farm enterprise to enhance livelihoods for upland farmers, especially in the northern and southern provinces, has grown into a rapidly expanding agrobusiness [56]. Government officials have relied on external inputs of knowledge and investments from state and private sectors from neighboring countries (e.g., China, Viet Nam and Thailand). In 2007 and 2012, the government issued a moratorium on concessions. Rubber planting basically stopped in 2011 after the economic crisis. As international prices fell, rubber was replaced by, for instance, bananas in the north. The government recognizes a number of arrangements, such as smallholder farming, contract farming, and concessions, with variations in each type according to who provides the main factors of production (e.g., land, labor, capital, market outlet, and technical knowledge). Fox and Castella [56] note that the negotiation of the contract between land users, companies and government agencies influences the rubber trajectory at the village level. The land users, the smallholder farmers, are concerned that arrangements\nmay limit their access to land, knowledge and profits, while investors prefer concession arrangements to protect their investment and to have large tracts of land under direct management. Concessions are normally applied to state land only. An increase in environmental and social problems occurred, as in Cambodia, associated with the development of land concessions for plantations, especially rubber busts and other \u2018boom\u2019 crops [58]. The reactions of local people to land concessions have varied depending on their own situation. In an area with mainly smallholder farmers, it will be difficult for (near) landless people to find regular employment as laborers, whereas a rubber plantation may provide regular employment and income. Although rubber companies may be actively promoting other institutional arrangements, smallholder rubber arrangements can emerge because farmers with relevant knowledge obtained while working on rubber farms (e.g., villagers located close to the Chinese and Thai borders), capital (e.g., better-off farmers with good relations with district authorities) and agency (e.g., belonging to farmers\u2019 groups or local elite) can negotiate profitable arrangements. Contract farming often suffers from inadequate village consultation, varying degrees of coercion, contradictory understanding and interpretation among contracting and governing parties, low levels of technology transfer from investors to the community, and disputes over land and wages. Contracts between foreign investors and villagers are often either unclear, written or non-existent. In the latter case, it remains unclear to whom any benefits will go. Additionally, the loss of resource entitlements (e.g., access by the villagers to non-timber forest products) and the ecological dimension (e.g., watershed protection by the state) are some of the undesirable effects that have emerged in projects involving concessions. Communities in both Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic have also reacted to plans of establishing a rubber plantation by starting to plant rubber trees themselves to avoid land being taken by a company [38].\n4.1.3. Myanmar\nIn Myanmar, rubber has been cultivated since the early 20th century, mostly in Mon State, on smallholder rubber plantations that have greatly contributed to local livelihoods. In the mid-1990s, during the boom, many smallholder farmers revived their rubber production without financial support from the government. The government established national production quotas for rubber, such as for other crops (e.g., rice) [55]. Since the mid-2000s, a new frontier area has been targeted in Kachin State and northern and eastern Shan State, which is supported by government policies. Large-scale rubber concessions are located in the uplands of formerly shifting cultivation areas, impacting the access to resources of local communities and their livelihoods. The interlinkages between the uplands and lowlands in the existing land-use systems were ignored. While rubber in Mon State, Kayin State, and Tanintharyi Region follows more of a smallholder model approach mostly embedded in Chinese rubber markets with Chinese middlemen, rubber development in northern Myanmar follows a private large-scale concessionary model mostly financed by Chinese investment. The smallholder-driven rubber production areas in the Mon State and Tanintharyi Region are increasingly at risk by nearby rubber concessionaires wanting to replace smallholder farms. Such a replacement would have a major impact on people\u2019s livelihoods and the landscape. Wage labor migration to these concessions is introducing new socio-economic and political tensions to farming communities [57]. Rubber planting basically stopped in 2008 with the economic crisis and had a slight increase in planting in 2012 [40]. The private sector dominates the rubber industry. According to Hla Myint [61], 90.5 percent are smallholders with less than 8 ha that are controlling around 42 percent of the total rubber area. In non-traditional rubber growing areas; however, farmers have been forcibly relocated to rubber plantations and/or forced into planting rubber because of land-use limitations by the government. These plantations are often established as joint projects [62].\n4.1.4. Viet Nam\nWhereas Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic followed the concession policy for agricultural investment and development, Viet Nam, similar to Thailand, followed a different model. In Viet Nam, tenure rights (e.g., land-use rights certificates or \u2018red book\u2019) were clarified and public investments were used to provide smallholder farmers with access to technology. Viet Nam illustrates that increases in agricultural production are by no means dependent on large-scale land-based investments. In Viet Nam, the government has made conscious institutional decisions to support smallholder rubber production. The reasons are linked to ongoing land reform policies, interest from smallholders in establishing rubber and the inability of the government to control large estates [56]. Large-scale plantations of old and new rubber mainly occur in the Central Highlands in Gia Lia Province and Dak Lak Province. The Prime Minister\u2019s issued Decision 750/QD-TTg aiming to increase Viet Nam\u2019s rubber plantations in 2009 was followed by an increase in planted area [40]. Collaborative mechanisms involving multi-state authorities and large corporations that allow for large-scale land acquisition and production do exist in Viet Nam, as described by Dao [63]. The demand and market for natural rubber are expected to continue to grow. In the uplands of mainland Southeast Asia that demand will continue to drive a transition from traditional farming systems and their associated secondary vegetation (i.e., shifting cultivation systems with fallow) to a landscape dominated by cash crops, most importantly, rubber. The abandonment of agricultural practices in favor of rubber growing has consequences for families\u2019 food security situation because rubber plantations do not provide food (honey, seeds and nuts), medicines, timber and non-timber products [55]. The impact of rubber on smallholders, however, is not yet clear. Smallholder rubber production is a viable and effective proposition for moving households and communities out of poverty. Shifting cultivation farmers can manage access to and use of their lands, given appropriate support, especially recognition of long-term use rights, and provided with extension services and subsidies during the initial period when rubber is being planted and not yet productive. On the other hand, externally imposed, large-scale investment polices (e.g., the commercial plantations being established in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Myanmar) adversely affect smallholders. Even when policies, laws and regulations have been drafted that could assist smallholders to maintain control of their land and invest in commercial crops, lack of financial and human resources and competing policy and political agendas have prevented these measures from being implemented effectively. Consequently, in many community villagers are selling their land and migrants are moving into the areas. In other communities, farmers struggle to maintain community lands and forests in the face of growing pressures from investors and government institutions to impose concession arrangements [56]. The analysis of rubber production in the global commodity boom in the four countries with the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach is summarized in Table 3. Again, landscape, governance and tenure are interrelated and mutually reinforced. At the landscape level, no integrated approaches were implemented. Two types of production systems can be distinguished: (1) small-scale growth of rubber by smallholder farmers that is associated with temporary forest clearing with less environmental impact (limited impact on forest and biodiversity); and (2) large-scale plantation rubber production that led to the clear-cutting of forests with significant socio-ecological impact (e.g., availability of forest and non-forest products, biodiversity loss). Because an integrated landscape approach was missing, rubber production was largely concentrated in the uplands, where it had an impact on the availability of groundwater in the lowlands. Governance in the four countries was conducive for smallholders in the uplands to shift from subsistence agriculture to market-oriented commodity production. Most support, however\u2014with the exception of Viet Nam\u2014went to large-scale plantation production. These large-scale plantations used land that was leased out as concessions, thereby creating problems because they limited access to land and\nforest resources under the customary tenure systems of local communities. Thus, land concessions increased social and environmental problems for villagers."

            "heading": "4.2. Coffee Production",
            "text": "Coffee is another important export crop. It is considered a boom crop in Southeast Asia; it bears the typical boom crop characteristics in many places where it is grown, which contribute to agrarian transition [64]. Coffee crops are highly sensitive to climate change [65].\nThe implications of coffee production in each of the Mekong countries are described below.\n4.2.1. Viet Nam\nViet Nam is the world\u2019s second largest coffee producer (mainly Robusta (Coffea canephora) with some Arabica (Coffea arabica) and exporters in the world after Brazil (see https://www.mekongeye.com/2017/11/13/mekong-institute-transforms-the-livesof-coffee-growers/, accessed on 1 July 2021). Arabica production has a unique set of characteristics that make it a rather more complex crop than Robusta, hence the name \u2018Robusta\u2019 [66]. Robusta is more adaptable than Arabica and able to thrive in warmer and lower land conditions, although it is more susceptible to low temperatures than Arabica [65]. The coffee boom in Viet Nam and the increase in coffee production are based mainly on smallholder farmers with an average field size of 1.2 hectares. Most farming families understand the positive impacts of sustainable farming in terms of economic efficiency, environmental protection and social welfare [67]. A series of reforms in the 1990s reinvigorated the economy to greater productivity, investment and participation in international markets (e.g., \u2018Doi Moi reforms\u2019). At the same time, reforms improved tenure security in agricultural areas and liberalized input and output markets, with important changes in agricultural production and structural transition toward higher value-added sectors [31,68]. With more secure tenure rights, many farmers could diversify their production, including perennial and high-value crops such as coffee. The reforms were followed by a wave of migration to\nthe Central Highlands, an area where coffee production is concentrated [69], as well as in Northwest Viet Nam [64]. In both areas, coffee production led to landscape-level land-use changes, such as the conversion of gardens, shifting cultivation areas and forests. Neither national nor multi-national funds assisted Viet Nam in achieving its global status as a coffee producer. However, the environmental consequences of intensified coffee production in Viet Nam resulted in seasonal water scarcity and water quality problems [67], as well as deforestation and land degradation owed to coffee planting [66]. Mixed intercropping was adopted in Northwest Viet Nam for supplemental income to better deal with fluctuating market prices and climate risks [64]. A social consequence was that ethnic minorities who traditionally inhabited the Central Highlands did not equally share in the economic benefits of the coffee boom because their social and farming systems did not adjust well to the required farming practices (e.g., customary and communal tenure systems instead of formal Land-Use Rights Certificates). In Northwest Viet Nam, farming families obtained Land-Use Right Certificates and this encouraged planting coffee trees. Planting trees is locally seen as a symbol of land ownership. Tuyen Nghiem et al. [64] consider coffee production in Northwest Viet Nam more inclusive than in the Central Highlands, thereby offering a sustainable pathway of livelihood transformation. The small and medium farmer-driven expansion of rice exports, and subsequently exports of other high(er) value commodities such as coffee, indicates that policies had a major impact on poverty reduction and gradual increases in farm size and non-agricultural growth also accelerated. Moving toward sustainability is necessary for the Vietnamese coffee industry in terms of economic, ecological and social benefits.\n4.2.2. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nIn Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, coffee is the country\u2019s third agricultural crop for exports (80 percent according to the Asian Development Bank in 2015 [69]) in terms of value. It is mostly grown by smallholder farmers. The competition in the region among coffee producers and exporters is intense (e.g., with Indonesia and Viet Nam). Improvements in the quality of coffee have created a good name for Lao coffee abroad. The growth of coffee has considerably expanded, with more land, generally pristine forests, being devoted to coffee production. On the Bolaven Plateau, a hotspot for land-based investments and thus a highly contested space, coffee (Arabica typica, Arabica catimor and Robusta) is traditionally grown by thousands of smallholder farmers [70]. On the same plateau, large coffee concessions were given out, but the concessionaires failed to produce high yields on the land they used within their concessions despite ideal biophysical characteristics. The Bolaven Plateau can be interpreted as a space of transition where new ways of doing things and new relations between people are being invented and tested within the boundaries of pre-existing social networks and new relations of power and authority [70]. How individuals and families are able to negotiate and re-imagine the network of relationships within which they live and work, the reciprocal nature\u2013society relations, will influence what happens.\n4.2.3. Myanmar\nIn Myanmar, coffee is grown in the north and production is increasing. Border trading of Myanmar coffee (Arabica) is substantial, with most of it sold to China at prices substantially below international commodity values [68]. This may be caused by the low quality of the coffee, although it has been improving in recent years. Sch\u00f6nweger and Messerli [71] challenge the often assumed superiority and effectiveness of large-scale (e.g., economies of scale in production, expertise, capital and technology) versus small-scale production, and in particular the argument that they modernize agriculture and optimize land use, arguments used in policy and decision-making.\n4.2.4. Cambodia\nIn Cambodia, the growth of coffee was introduced in the 21st century. It was once a traditional source of livelihood for rural communities in the uplands. Nowadays, coffee is grown in four provinces, Pailin, Kampong Cham, Mondulkiri and Ratanakkiri, where it is competing for space with other cash crops such as rubber, cassava and cashews. Contrary to Viet Nam and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, a flood of cheaper, higher-quality imports is obscuring local products, making it difficult for local farmers to obtain a profit. The government is also not supporting coffee cultivation because it prioritizes crops that require less time to farm (coffee requires four to six years to mature), yield high quantities of fruit, and has potential for market growth (e.g., pepper). In the context of insecure rights and weak land governance, the negative impacts of concessions include deforestation and loss of biodiversity; loss of access to land; threat to local livelihoods; eviction of other potential investors; and adverse impacts on employment. The analysis of coffee production in the global commodity boom in the four countries with the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach is summarized in Table 4. Again, landscape, governance and tenure are interrelated and mutually reinforced. At the landscape level, coffee production led to the conversion of gardens, shifting cultivation areas and forests in the upland areas. No integrated landscape approaches were applied. Related to governance are the conducive government policies\u2014with the exception of Cambodia\u2014that encourage smallholder farmers to produce coffee. Social changes, related to relations of power and authority in areas with pre-existing social networks, occurred because of the immigration of people to the coffee production areas, in particular in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. The conducive policies and secure tenure rights in Viet Nam led to farmers diversifying their production, including coffee, whereas the often less secure tenure rights of smallholder farmers in the other three countries did not lead to a similar diversification."

            "text": "To analyze the agrarian and environmental transitions in the Mekong Region, this paper introduces the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach, a qualitative analysis combining integrated landscape approaches, governance and rights-based approaches, while underlining the centrality of legitimate tenure rights, limitations and obligations. The analysis across the\nMekong Region with a focus on Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam has demonstrated that (integrated) landscape approaches have been lacking when analyzing either the Green Revolution focused on selected staple foods or the global commodity boom. In both cases, the focus was, and is, on a transition dominated by the economic production dimension at the cost of the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Because these three dimensions are not balanced, sustaining these production systems comes with high costs and trade-offs. The landscapes lose on multifunctionality, communities lose on access to, control and use of their resources, land users lose on having production systems that can easily adapt to changing climate and volatile market conditions, the smallholder farmers are mostly neglected in policy and law-making (with the exception of Viet Nam), as well as not having an obvious voice nor rights in the devolution of spatial planning and decision-making on the pathways of agrarian and environmental transition. Smallholder farmers, though stakeholders, are not (enough) capacitated for their new roles and responsibilities when agreeing voluntarily to move from subsistence agriculture to more market-oriented systems. The state as duty bearer is present, but the smallholder farmers and communities as right holders are often overlooked. Their socially or legally recognized user rights lose out on those who have control or decision-maker rights. In the global commodity boom, this happened in a context where both rubber and coffee were historically smallholder crops that contributed to livelihoods. The integration of smallholder farmers into the commodity boom would have been possible. However, shifting cultivation systems and their farmers were considered to have less economic, environmental or social value than plantation agriculture. Originally, the nature\u2013society reciprocal relations were of mutual benefit; the dominance of the economic dimension has skewed this relation toward society, but a society in which few win and many lose out. In the land-based investment literature in the Mekong Region, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of large-scale land deals on the wider landscape, in particular the interlinkages and mutual reinforcement of the three elements of the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach, i.e., landscape, governance and tenure. The large-scale investors transformed the socio-ecological landscapes and land-use patterns of the smallholder farmers, and over time, new relations had to be created. Not only has the physical landscape changed, but also the social landscape because some rural households have become landless [1], others made money by investing in plantation crops [56], and migrant workers arrived from other regions and countries [72] cited in [42]. These transitions are ongoing notwithstanding that [1] pointed to evidence that smallholder farming in low-income countries has a higher poverty-reducing potential. The outcomes are thus both positive and negative but contributed to increasing inequalities: those who invested in their own plantations or found employment have seen their incomes rise, whereas those who have been displaced from their land have lost access to forest and grazing lands and those who have been exploited by unfair contracting and employment schemes are even worse off [56]. Independent smallholder farmers may be involved in plantation developments on contested land, thereby ignoring the customary tenure claims of marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities [42]. The environment and its biodiversity are among the main losers because of the destruction of the original (forest) vegetation and habitats and significant carbon emissions. During the global commodity boom, smallholder farmers have been neglected in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar by land (use) policies, agricultural development strategies, and investment-related policies. However, they remain numerically important, often combining farming with other activities in the rural non-farm economy [73]. Smallholder farmers are dominant in Viet Nam, which decided on a different pathway to supporting these farmers. Increasingly, it is widely being recognized that small-scale family farming with agro-ecological methods is agriculturally efficient, particularly concerning environmental sustainability, yield per input, value added per unit area, and the family farm\u2019s capacity to evolve over time. Diversification seems preferable because a monoculture approach may maximize benefits in times of high market prices but creates hardship for farmers in times of low prices [66]. Thus, a shift toward agro-ecological\npractices in direct support of sustainable intensification with diversification would facilitate food and nutrition security for smallholder farmers. Such a shift would be an answer to the shortcomings of the Green Revolution and the global commodity boom, which both lacked a holistic physical and social landscape approach. The versatility of smallholder farmers was shown in Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, with farmers opting for alternative crops in times of low prices for boom crops. More smallholder farmer-centered policy and inclusive, participatory decision-making at the landscape level would encourage bringing such versatility in practice. This would not only create a more inclusive society but also provide opportunities to address growing inequalities. Local communities rarely participate in holistic planning and decision-making processes at the landscape level. Local governments acted as transmitters of the government decision, or worse, persuaded communities to accept land-based investments, as they would bring development to the villages [38]. Not only was land taken for concessions, but with this taking, the insecurity on land that was being left to use to the communities increased, and consequently, land tenure insecurity became more widespread. With the rise of dispossession and displacement, the number of disputes and conflicts related to land tenure rights within communities, between communities, and between communities and government as \u2018duty bearer\u2019 increased. It would be important for the way forward that local communities, i.e., the land users with legitimate land-use rights, are empowered. The secure land tenure rights of smallholder farmers in Viet Nam have shown this in practice. This empowerment could be organized through farmer organizations, producer organizations, or other collective action mechanisms. This would give land users a voice to shape decision-making processes by local government at the landscape level accordingly. The people most vulnerable to the consequences of land-based investments are those who are not protected by the policy and legal frameworks and whose tenure rights are most insecure. These people are most vulnerable to dispossession and displacement. Especially where smallholder farming comprises a combination of upland shifting cultivation and lowland paddy rice cropping, the dispossession of land used for shifting cultivation to\u2014for example\u2014rubber plantations disrupts the family livelihood system (e.g., leaving less area for grazing, fishing, hunting, collection of non-timber forest products, etc.). An integrated landscape approach would have looked at such land-use systems in a holistic manner. The agrarian and environmental transitions in the Mekong Region are ongoing. In the program rolled out from 2014 until 2021, the interlinkages and mutual reinforcement of tenure and governance, tenure and land-based investments, and governance and landbased investments have been addressed, but their linkages to the landscape level have not been addressed to the extent possible. This was partly limited by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impossibility to meet physically, partly because new insights developed during the program did not reach full fruition by testing these in practice. For example, the link to the landscape level was planned to be furnished by spatial planning at the local level to balance societal priorities in the use of land, fisheries, forests and water resources. The planned activities in 2020 were first postponed and then canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in addition, in Myanmar, all activities ceased by 1 February 2021. Agriculture increased by around 21 percent between 1996 and 2015, while forests declined due to encroachment of non-forest uses into the remaining forest landscapes (most pronounced in Cambodia and Myanmar). The leaders of Cambodia, Thailand and Viet Nam reaffirmed their commitment in the 2021 Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forest and Land Use to the conservation, protection, management and restoration of forest and sustainable land use, as well as support to smallholder farmers, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities who depend on forests for their livelihoods (https://ukcop26.org/ glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/, accessed on 3 October 2022). ). This Declaration to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation is important, though not legally binding. Several countries with high rates of forest loss have not yet signed the Glasgow Declaration, including the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar. Tree\nplantations, such as rubber, will not help climate, environmental services, wildlife [74], and natural capital."

            "text": "The Mekong Region is thus at a critical point in time wherein inclusive, participatory and accountable decision-making by those involved in, or affected by, the agrarian and environmental transitions is immediately required to ensure a more sustainable development path. The \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach furnishes the elements that stakeholders should incorporate to go from agrarian and environmental transition to transformation. There is a definite need for approaches that look at transitions in a broad sense beyond focusing on a specific crop type and that encourage thinking about the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 where landscape, governance and tenure rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing if we are to achieve sustainability. The \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach shows a manageable level of complexity that need not be a burden to achieve transformation towards more sustainability. The sustained domination of regional and global markets suggests that the direction the Mekong countries take regarding key resource-related issues will be shaped in some measure by external influences. The way forward will depend on the extent to which such external forces can be leveraged for the benefit of rural and agricultural-dependent people. A more sustainable future may mean moving from transition to transformation with a fundamentally different approach. This means that transformative change is needed. The current structures\u2014be they formal or informal institutions, policy and decision-making approaches, or agricultural practices\u2014inhibit more sustainable development and equality outcomes. The sectoral focus and organization of production on plantations led to the loss of biodiversity and commodity production optimization based on economic assumptions. Adaptation by smallholder farmers and local communities to this changing context of increasing plantation development becomes harder over time and tensions start to arise. This is the more striking because alternative investment models exist that have the potential to be more inclusive, participatory and accountable. They form a competitive alternative. As Visseren-Hamakers et al. [75] point out, societal structures need to change or the underlying societal causes of unsustainable practices. The Green Revolution and the global commodity boom can be seen as transitions in the broader societal context of transformation. The \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach furnishes those elements to work toward transformative change and is already being advanced across a combined 36 countries through two integrated impact programs by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) with a combined budget of USD 450 million, namely the GEF-7 Sustainable Forest Management Dryland Sustainable Landscapes (DSL-IP) and GEF-7 Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (FOLUR-IP) Impact programs [76]. These two programs will furnish the opportunity for further analysis and detailed application of the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach in ongoing transitions to achieve transformation. For instance, FOLUR-IP supports countries in ensuring that production systems are embedded within wider landscapes to safeguard the natural capital (e.g., land, soil, biodiversity and water) and ecosystem services on which they depend. The program aims to achieve a transformational impact at scale by accelerating action in production landscapes and along value chains for selected major commodities that are major contributors to deforestation and forest degradation, including coffee. In sum, applying the \u2018tenure-scape\u2019 approach as part of a participatory and informed landscape approach as well as an integrated landscape assessment methodology across these Impact Programs allows a holistic view recognizing that production systems are embedded within the physical and societal landscapes, and that these landscapes are deeply interconnected and interdependent. In these IPs and in the Mekong Region, only an integrated approach will provide a way forward to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs across the three dimensions of sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: L.J.M.J.
