However, various studies have found that acoustic devices have losses dominated by two level systems (TLS) at cryogenic temperatures [3\u20135]. The model for TLS posits a large bath of two level oscillators that can couple to acoustic or electric fields over a wide range of frequencies [6]. However, the microscopic picture of this bath of TLS is not well understood. To be able to mitigate these loss channels and therefore make longer lifetime acoustic devices, the goal of this study is to use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to understand the surface properties of acoustic devices fabricated on piezoelectric LithiumNiobate (LN). When these studies are compared with loss channel analysis from cryogenic measurements of the acoustic resonators, we can isolate the microscopic characteristics on the surfaces of LN which participate in acoustic losses. Lithiumniobate undergoes a series of surface treatments that can alter the stoichiometry during acoustic device fabrication. In order to understand which processes could be inducing the largest sources of TLS loss, we fabricate a series of surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators on x-cut LNwith differing surface treatments: solvent cleaning, annealing at 500C, annealing at 500Cwith an additional buffered oxide etchant dip, piranha dip, and argon ion milling. The average TLS loss for each device is measured by sweeping the temperature of the device from 200mK to 10mK and fitting the frequency redshift of the SAW modes [6, 7]. Increases in average TLS loss was compared to XPS measurements of the C1s, O1s, Nb3d and Li1s lines [8]. Increased TLS loss is found in annealed and ionmilled SAWdevices. Samples annealed at 500Cwere found to have excess oxygen as compared to untreated devices, suggesting formation of excess oxides could contribute to TLS loss. Ion milled samples did not show significant changes in stoichiometry. As a further investigation, we used AFM to study the surface ordering and roughness of LN. Surface layers of LNwhen polished using chemical mechanical planarization often do not have atomically flat surfaces. Instead, they are found to have surface layers covered with amorphous LN. It has been demonstrated that annealing LN at temperatures at or above 700C can cause the surface layers to reorder into atomically flat terraces [9\u201311]. Our goal is to integrate this type of surface treatment into our acoustic devices in order to study how amorphous surface roughness could be contributing to acoustic TLS loss.We compare AFM images of unprocessed x-cut LN with x-cut LN that has been ion milled and annealed at various temperatures using a Bruker MultiMode 8-HR.We find that the RMS surface roughness Rq in a 2\u03bcmwindow for unprocessed LN is 172.5 +/- 2.4 pm, decreasing with ion milling (168.9 +/- 4.4 pm) and increasing annealing at 500C (213.9 +/- 7.5pm). During the 700C anneal, LN terraces form in the sample surface, and we see that within the LN terraces, the surface roughness decreases as compared to the unprocessed LN. Losses in different bulk acoustic wave resonators varying in annealing treatment and surface roughness will be compared to determine if atomically flat surfaces decrease TLS loss [12]."
