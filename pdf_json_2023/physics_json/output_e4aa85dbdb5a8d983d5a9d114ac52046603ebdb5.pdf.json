In this reaction , excess solution of NaOH was used to ensure the reaction being irreversible . Three parameters were varied to show their effects on the reaction rate .They are : percentage excess of NaOH solution (10 % 100 %) , temperature (100-150) o C , and stirring speed (400-1100) rpm. It was noticed that increasing the percentage excess of NaOH solution enhances the rate of reaction while increasing temperature decreases the reaction rate since it is exothermic reaction. Increasing stirring speed also improves the reaction rate because it is mass transfer controlled .Calculations of the activation energy and the frequency factor were also performed.

Many literature were published in the field of saponification of various fats and fatty acids.Frost and Schwemer,1952. had studied the differential rate equations for the kinetics of competitive consecutive second \u2013 order reactions . Measurements of the rate of saponification of ethyl adipate and ethyl succinate were used to verify the theoretical approach . Newberger and Kadlec , 1973 had studied the kinetics of the saponification of diethyl adipate between 302K and 358K , for both stirred and tubular reactors . They had suggested numerical search method to verify the proposed model. Vicente, et al., 2006. Studied the kinetics of Brassica Carinata oil methanolysis . They found that the methanolysis reaction can be described as a pseudo \u2013 homogeneous catalyzed reaction , following a second \u2013 order mechanism for the forward and reverse reactions . They also found that higher temperature and catalyst concentrations increased the reaction rates . Appleton Appleton, 2007, had published a handbook of soap manufacture . He had made a review of oils and fats and their saponification . He had presented the steps of soap \u2013 making even soap perfuming and molding . Lab. Report , 2012, was presented to determine the order, rate constant , activation energy , and pre \u2013 exponential factor for the reaction of ethyl acetate with base using conductance measurements. An experimental study of the reaction kinetics of a simple homogenous liquid \u2013 phase system was published , Chem. Eng. Lab. , 2013. The reaction kinetics of the saponification of isopropyl acetate with sodium hydroxide was presented. There are some aspects of interest still need to be studied . Determination the order , rate constant and many other parameters in the saponification kinetics are of great importance . The objective of this research is to study the parameters that affect saponification reaction. These parameters can be used to model the reaction to a large \u2013 scale applications , enhance an existed production and adopt an optimum set of parameters for a new production ."

Using (3:1) ratio ensures the product (soap) to be soft enough (by using olein ) and solid enough (by using stearin ) for toilet use. Appleton had published various types of fats and fatty acids . Olein (derived from olive and cotton \u2013 seed oil ) is saponified according to the following reaction :\nC3H5(C18H33O2)3 + 3NaOH = 3NaO2C18H33 + C3H5(OH)3\nolein sodium sodium oleate glycerol\nhydroxide ( soap )\nStearin ( derived from tallow ) is saponified according to the following reaction :\nC3H5(C18H35O2)3 + 3NaOH = 3NaO2C18H35 + C3H5(OH)3\nstearin sodium sodium stearate glycerol\nhydroxide ( soap )\nTherefore; the chemical equation for saponification reaction can be represented by :\nA + B = R + S\nWhere A , B refer to the reactants ( fat and caustic soda ) and R , S refer to the products ( soap and glycerol).

            "text": "Experiments were performed at different levels of the three parameters ( percentage excess of NaOH solution (10%-100%) , temperature (100-150) o C , and stirring speed (400-1100) rpm . Each experiment depicted a concentration \u2013 time curve . To calculate the order of the reaction and the rate constant , the differential method was adopted . This was achieved by calculating different slopes at different concentrations of tangent points of the concentration \u2013 time curve . These slopes represented dCA/dt (reaction rate with respect to the limiting reactant A) . Taking the natural logarithms for each dCA/dt and CA , then drawing data gives a straight line of slope equal nA ( the order of the reaction with respect to A ) and of intercept equals ln k. The inverse of ln k gives the experimental value of k (reaction \u2013 rate constant).Table 1 shows a sample of concentration \u2013time data for both reactant A and reactant B , with the refractive indices and conversions for run no.(4).Fig.1 shows the concentration - time curve of reactant A. The curve shows decreasing of CA with time until complete consumption. This is because reactant A is the limiting reactant . Table 2 shows data for the slopes determined at the tangent points of Fig. 1. The data illustrate decreasing of slopes' magnitudes for the points . This means decreasing the rate of reaction with the concentration decrease, which indicates the progress of reaction. Table 3 shows the logarithm of the rate of reaction ln (-dCA/dt) with the logarithm of the concentration lnCA. Fig. 2 depicted these data. It was shown that the order of reaction with respect to A is approximately 1. The value of the rate constant was also determined. These calculations were also done for the excess reactant B ( NaOH solution ) to find the order of the reaction with\nrespect to it (nB). Fig. 3 traces the concentration - time profile of reactant B. It is clear that reactant B dose not tend to complete consumption , since it is the excess reactant. Table 4 shows (- dCB / dt) versus CB data . Similarly , the rate of reaction decreased with decrease in concentration .Table 5 shows the variation of ln (-dCB/dt) with ln CB .Fig. 4 traces ln(-dCB/dt) against lnCB. The relation is linear with slope equals nB. Again the value of nB is about 1 . Experimental results showed that the order of reaction for each reactant nA , nB \u22481 , so the overall order of reaction was second order . This result agreed with the fact that most of esterification reactions are second order .Saponification reaction is an example of these reactions. It was also noticed that the values of the refractive index RI decreases as the conversion increases. After approximately 50% conversion, the values of RI increases again. To explain this behavior, the relationship between RI and the density must be noticed. RI is a physical property that inversely proportional to density. As NaOH solution was added to the fat , the density of the fat is increased (RI is decreased).When the soap was produced the density again decreased (RI is increased). The concentration - time data were substituted in the mathematical model using conversions instead of concentrations.\nFig. 5 shows the relation between the expression ln D (*\n+\n) and time.\nThe relation is linear with slope equal kcalc . The calculated values of the reaction-rate constant were somewhat deviate from the experimental ones. It was noticed that k values\nobtained from the mathematical model were overestimated when the percentage excess of NaOH\nsolution were too low or too high. At medium levels of % excess of NaOH solution the\ncalculated values of k were underestimated. This can be discussed as follows: at low values of\n% excess of NaOH solution , the reaction rate decreases because of the decreased concentration\nof NaOH giving reduced values of reaction \u2013rate constant kexp .This makes the calculated values be higher . High values of % excess of NaOH solution reduce the number of reacting\nmolecules , as a result of hindering their movement , causing reduced values of kexp again. This\nalso makes kcalc be higher. The average error between experimental and calculated values of k was calculated by the following equation:\nAv. Error = \u2211 (\n)\nWhere N is the number of runs . The average error was approximately 20%. This figure may be accepted because the experimental errors were thought to be lumped within it . Fortunately; the underestimated values of kcalc resulted from the mathematical model allow safe design and simulation calculations.\nFig. 6 shows the effect of increasing the percentage excess of NaOH solution on reaction \u2013 rate constants ( kexp and kcalc ) . The calculated values trace lower curve than experimental ones except at approximately 100% excess . Evidently, increasing NaOH solution enhances the rate of reaction because it suppresses the backward reaction according to Le Chatelier rule .\nThe effect of temperature is presented in Fig. 7 . The natural logarithms of k is plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature . This figure shows a linear relation between ln k and 1/T as it was predicted by Arrhenius.\n( )\nwhere the slope (\n) represents the negative value of the activation energy divided by the\nuniversal perfect-gas law constant . The intercept of the plot ( ln A o ) determines the frequency factor . The values of the activation energy and the frequency factor were found to be as follows:\nEa exp = -20.44 J.mol -1\nand\nA o exp =9.8358\u00d710 -5 l.mol -1 .min -1\nWhile Ea calc = -4.67 J.mol -1\nand\nA o calc = 6.2\u00d710 -3 l.mol -1 .min -1\nThe experimental and calculated values are different by an order of magnitude which is attributed to the experimental error .The value of the activation energy is rather low. This indicates that the reaction is fast since the activation energy represents the energy barrier that\nmolecules must gain to reach the final product .\nFig. 8 shows the effect of stirring speed upon the rate constants. It is clear that the effect of stirring is considerable on the reaction rate. This leads to the conclusion that the reaction is mass - transfer controlled. This viewpoint agrees well with the notation of underestimated values of kexp at high values of percentage excess of NaOH solution. Therefore; increasing stirring speed enhances the reaction rate. However, there is a constraint limited by the soap - froth rising .If the values of kexp were normalized (i.e. making the total increase in kexp corresponds 100% ) as shown in Table 6. This was done for the runs that have only the excess ratio varied , i.e. the temperature and stirring speed were fixed . The normalization shows that percentage excess over 50% has less effect on the value of kexp than the percentage excess below 50%. This may be attributed to the hindrance of reacting molecules by the NaOH molecules which confirms the mass- transfer control on the reaction."
