ABSTRACT Background While prolonged labour market participation becomes increasingly important in ageing societies, evidence on the impacts of entering or exiting work beyond age 65 on cognitive functioning is scarce. Methods We use data from two large populationrepresentative data sets from South Korea and the USA to investigate and compare the effects of the labour market (re)entry and exit by matching employment and other confounder trajectories prior to the exposure. We chose the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (N=1872, 2006\u20132020) for its exceptionally active labour participation in later life and the Health and Retirement Study (N=4070, 2006\u20132020) for its growing inequality among US older adults in labour participation. We use the matching differenceindifferences (DID) method, which allows us to make causal claims by reducing biases through matching. Results We find general positive effects of entering the labour market in South Korea (DID estimate: 0.653, 95% CI 0.167 to 1.133), while in the USA such benefit is not salient (DID estimate: 0.049, 95% CI \u22120.262 to 0.431). Exiting the latelife labour market leads to cognitive decline in both South Korea (DID estimate: \u22120.438, 95% CI \u22120.770 to \u20130.088) and the USA (DID estimate: \u22120.432, 95% CI \u22120.698 to \u20130.165). Conclusions Findings suggest that Korean participants cognitively benefited from latelife labour market participation, while US participants did not. Differences in participant characteristics and reasons for labour market participation may have led to the differential findings. We found the negative effects of exiting the latelife labour force in both countries.",

Re- use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.\nINTRODUCTION An increase in advanced- age labour force participation, specifically beyond ages 65 and older, has been observed across industrialised economies over the last decade.1\u20134 South Korea makes itself an interesting case study with the highest labour force participation rate of older adults, accounting for 36% of the individuals aged 65+ in 2021.5\nIn this paper, we examine the impacts of the late- life labour market \u2018entry and exit\u2019 on cognitive function in South Korea and compare the causal effects with results from the USA, a country whose older population has marked cultural and socioeconomic characteristics with South Korea\u2019s. We provide contextual comparisons of both countries on late- adulthood financial conditions in online supplemental appendix 1.\nOur main interest is cognitive function. Poor cognitive function is a growing public health concern for ageing societies.6 A decline in cognitive function is negatively associated with the deprivation of one\u2019s physical and mental autonomy and imposes a financial burden on the family and society due to the high cost of health and social care.7 Due to such reasons, exiting or remaining in the labour force at later adulthood on cognitive function has received public health and economic attention.8\u201314 Yet, very few studies have examined the impacts of late- life labour market participation beyond age 65, and the evidence has been restricted to a few countries.\nThis paper uses population- based data from South Korea and the USA. Investigating and comparing causal effects with more than one population is challenging with age- non- related policy change as an instrument unless such changes occur in parallel. To overcome these limitations, we use the matching difference- in- differences from the potential outcomes framework.15 This approach shares the reasoning of trial emulation in epidemiology,\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC \u21d2 Previous research has established the negative relationship between retirement and cognitive function. Labour force participation and exit beyond normative retirement age (65+) and the relationship with cognitive function is less studied.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS \u21d2 We provide evidence from large populationrepresentative South Korean data, with active late- life labour market participation and compare results with the USA. Entering the labour market at age 65+ positively affects cognitive function in South Korea but not in the USA. We find negative effects of exiting the labour market at age 65+ in both South Korea and the USA.\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n\u21d2 This research indicates measures to facilitate labour market participation at advanced ages in South Korea may help delay cognitive decline. Future research is needed to investigate whether such positive benefit continues to exist with increasing levels of educational attainment and living conditions.\nP atna (IIT P atna).

Past work history is an important confounder affecting future employment status18 and cognitive health.19 By matching according to the employment history, we may capture further unobserved time- varying confounders such as work attitude, desire to work or job insecurity.\nIn line with the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 hypothesis,20 which intellectually stimulating activities can protect against cognitive decline in later life, we expect labour market entry to have positive effects on cognitive functioning and labour market exits to have negative effects, similar across countries. We explored putative moderators, sex/gender, education and socioeconomic status without directed hypotheses."

It takes integer values between 0 and 30, with higher values indicating better functioning. K- MMSE is a modified version of MMSE adjusted to the older Korean population.22\nIn HRS, the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) is applied to measure global cognitive function.23 TICS is modelled after MMSE for large- scale population- based cognitive assessment via telephone or face- to- face administration.24 It takes integer values between 0 and 27, with higher values indicating better functioning.\nComparisons of the composition of these two measurements and the distributions of each measurement are found in online supplemental table 1 and figure 1. Several studies argued that TICS and MMSE scores correlate very highly.24 25 The estimated effect cannot be interpreted in terms of magnitude, yet it is sufficient to present the direction of the effect.\nEmployment status transitions at late life To reduce possible selection into entering or exiting the labour market, we employ a difference- in- differences (DID) design to compare participants with and without exposure after several steps of reducing possible confounding. Using the terminology of the DID method, the so- called \u2018treatment\u2019 \u2018entering the labour market\u2019 captures employment transitions from being non- employed at wave t\u22121 to employed at wave t. We compare\nindividuals entering the labour market to the \u2018control\u2019 group of individuals who remain inactive, that is, out of the labour market from wave t\u22121 to wave t. Likewise, \u2018exiting the labour market\u2019 identifies employment transitions from being employed at wave t\u22121 to non- employed at wave t. We compare individuals who exit the labour market to the \u2018control\u2019 group of individuals who stay in the labour market from wave t\u22121 to wave t.

Borrowing from Imai, Kim and Wang15, we refer to the set of matched \u2018control\u2019 observations as a matched set.15 Online supplemental figure 2 presents a graphical illustration of matching across individuals and waves. Then, it refines the matched sets via weighting using pretreatment covariate histories up to three past waves prior to the transitions. Finally, it computes the DID estimators among refined matched sets.\nWe chose the number of lags to be three to include more than one wave of pre-\u2018treatment\u2019 history while balancing against the need for a sufficient sample size of the matched set. We set the number of leads to be one to have enough individuals in the matched set and to avoid effects from interference coming from the lead period. We present a separate sensitivity analysis with a lag of two waves pre-\u2018treatment\u2019 in online supplemental appendix 2.\nCovariate balancing using pre-treatment covariate trajectories We first match individuals by their employment histories and build a matched set. Subsequently, we balance the covariates of the \u2018control\u2019 and the \u2018treatment\u2019 group. This is done by giving higher weights to individuals in the matched set with similarity in terms of covariate history to the treatment group. We tested several covariate balancing methods, such as Mahalanobis distance matching,30 propensity score matching,31 propensity score weighting and covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS),32 and CBPS weighting method best adjusted the covariates (online supplemental appendix 3)."

The most challenging one is the parallel trend assumption, which needs to be met to ensure that the effect is driven by the treatment and not by possible unobserved confounding in the pretreated period. Visual inspections (online supplemental figures 3 and 4) indicate that the parallel assumption might be valid, as the standardised mean difference in cognitive score of the pre- exposed period after balancing was close to zero.\nThe second assumption is the absence of spillover effects, which means that one\u2019s employment status transition should not affect others\u2019 cognitive function. We cannot rule out the possibility of spillover effects as we do not have information on the connectedness of individuals through living in close geographical proximity or sharing the work environment, etc. However, we believe that the amount is trivial.\nFinally, although this method allows the investigation of carry- over effects by deciding the number of lags to consider, we must assume that the potential outcome is independent of the treatment history beyond the number of lags, three waves. We believe that employment histories of up to three waves (6 years) are enough to capture unobserved confounders related to employment status."

J Epidemiol Community Health 2023;0:1\u20137. doi:10.1136/jech-2022-220197\nUsing the matching difference- in- differences that follows the idea of trial emulation,15\u201317 we find that the effects of employment transitions at age 65+ on cognitive function are heterogeneous in country contexts. The estimated effects of entering the labour market were positive in Korea, while we did not find such positive effects in the USA. On the other hand, we found negative effects from exiting the labour market in both data sets. To understand the magnitude of the positive effects from the Korean study, we compare our result to a study that investigated the effects of receiving social pension for 5 years on cognitive functioning using the same data and cognitive assessment.35 They found a positive effect of 1.309 points while in our study estimated a positive effect of 0.653 points for entering the latelife labour market, roughly half the size of the cognitive benefit from receiving long- term social pension.\nOur results add support to the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 hypothesis in late- life labour force participation20 and are in line with previous studies of the positive associations of labour market participation at advanced ages and cognitive functioning.12\u201314 However, our findings suggest that the general positive effects are country specific. We discuss two potential mechanisms that might explain the unique positive effects of entry into the labour market in Korea in online supplemental appendix 4. Concerning the well- established detrimental effects of labour market withdrawal,8\u201310 our study comes to the same conclusion as previous studies by using a different causal identification strategy. We add to this body of literature by extending the study population from retirees to anyone exiting the labour market exit at 65+, potentially including postretirement work. Furthermore, we show that negative effects are more pronounced in groups with low socioeconomic status and in men.\nThere are limitations to this study. First, the sample size of the Korean study is relatively small and, thus, does not allow for subgroup analyses. Furthermore, the \u2018treated\u2019 group in our analyses represents a rather small portion of individuals who transitioned into or out of work in Korea and the USA. Concerning the possibility of reverse causality, we present online supplemental tables 2 and 3, which measured cognitive function one wave before the transitions. We observe that in both countries, individuals who enter the labour force are not positively selected in terms of better cognitive functioning. Rather they have the second lowest cognitive functioning, contrary to the reverse causality argument. Second, we remove a large share of observations (USA: 60%; Korea: 54%) due to the criterion of five consecutive participation in the survey. This exclusion is crucial to match individuals with past three employment histories and investigate the effects up to one follow- up wave. We report the descriptive statistics by the exclusion criterion in online supplemental tables 4 and 5. A sensitivity analysis relaxing this criterion from five to four waves of consecutive participation by matching on past two waves led to similar result patterns (online supplemental appendix 2). Third, the two cognitive measurements in each data set are overlapping in some dimensions but are not identical. Compared with the US data, the distribution in Korean data is more skewed to the right. While we believe some of the concerns are relieved by using the change score of cognitive functioning instead of the score itself, we suggest refraining from making direct comparisons in the magnitude of the effects until further harmonisation of the cognitive assessments becomes available. Regarding data collection changes due to the COVID- 19 outbreak, in 2020, HRS opted to use telephone testing exclusively instead of randomising individuals for in- person assessments for cognition. While there could be mode effects, HRS had applied random assignment to in- person versus\ntelephone testing in precedent waves and showed no differences in performance. KLoSA administered cognitive testing in person for all waves, including 2020, with similar response rates. Fourth, our analytical strategy is subjected to unobserved time- varying confounders that might influence the labour force transitions and cognitive functioning such as somatic disorders which are not captured by conventional health measures. Fifth, both cognitive scores measure global cognition and are known to have poor sensitivity to small changes in cognitive functioning.\nDespite these limitations, our contribution to the knowledge of employment status transitions at advanced ages and cognitive functioning is analysing the transition effects with a rigorous modelling strategy and a cross- country perspective from South Korea, where one out of three is participating in the labour market at 65+,5 and the USA, with growing inequality among older adults in labour participation.36 Estimating identical dataanalytic models with multiple data sets is useful for the external validity of findings by ensuring replicability and reproducibility of the research design.37 38 This is promising with a growing attempt to harmonise better cognitive ageing data from different countries.39\nFuture research should add by testing more potential pathways and confounders of effects of labour market entry and exit by assessing possible effect differences in more fine- grained types of occupation and psychosocial work characteristics, health conditions, and racial/ethnic groups.\nTwitter Jung Hyun Kim @use_me_research\nAcknowledgements We would like to express our appreciation to our colleagues at IRSEI and the MELODEM (Methods in longitudinal dementia research) Working Group for their insightful discussions.
