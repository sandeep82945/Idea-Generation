Both phenomena can be witnessed by the violation of certain inequalities, the simplest and most important of which are the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and the Klyachko-Can-Biniciog\u030clu-Shumovski (KCBS), for Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality, respectively. It has been shown that, using the most common interpretation of Bell scenarios, quantum systems cannot violate both inequalities concomitantly, thus suggesting a monogamous relation between the two phenomena. In this Letter, we show that the joint consideration of the CHSH and KCBS inequalities naturally calls for the so-called generalized Bell scenarios, which, contrary to the previous results, allows for joint violation of them. A photonic experiment thus tests the synchronous violation of both CHSH and KCBS inequalities. Our results agree with the theoretical predictions, thereby providing experimental proof of the coexistence of Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality in the simplest scenario, and shed new light for further explorations of nonclassical features of quantum systems.\nIntroduction.\u2014 Quantum theory is notable for being intriguing and counter-intuitive, a fact due, mostly, to predictions and concepts that diverge from those of classical theories. Among such nonclassical concepts are Bell nonlocality [1, 2] and Kochen-Specker contextuality [3, 4].\nClassical reasoning assumes the possibility of welldefined values for every physical quantity. Probabilities are used as a consequence of partial knowledge one has regarding the real state of affairs. Prior to quantum theory, there was no reason to distrust such a view.\nBell nonlocality refers to stronger-than-classical correlations on outcomes of measurements performed by distant parties on composite systems. Classical reasoning allows for the possibility of the so-called local hidden variables (LHV) as a mathematical description of every correlation in space-like separated measurements. In a seminal paper [1], Bell showed that quantum theory admits correlations that cannot be explained by any LHV model, a result later known as Bell\u2019s theorem. The nonlocal correlations violate inequalities that are satisfied in any LHV theory, the so-called Bell inequalities, the simplest and best known of which is the Clauser-Horne-ShimonyHolt (CHSH) inequality [5]. It is worth mentioning that Bell nonlocality in quantum systems has been extensively tested and verified in several seminal experiments [6\u201311].\nContextuality is a concept similar to nonlocality; in fact, it can be understood as a generalization of nonlocality that manifests also for single systems. While in classical theories, every pair of measurements can be\njointly performed, at least in principle [12], in quantum theory pairs of measurements are usually incompatible, preventing their joint measurability. Sets of compatible measurements are called contexts, and theories in which it is possible to assign values to the outcomes of measurements irrespective of the context in which they are measured are called noncontextual hidden variable (NCHV) theories. Kochen and Specker [4] and Bell [3] were the first to note that quantum theory admits correlations that cannot be explained by any NCHV model, a result later known as Kochen\u2013Specker theorem. In 2008, Klyachko et al.[13] noticed that, as for nonlocality, there are inequalities that hold for all noncontextual correlations while can be violated for single quantum systems. The Klyachko-Can-Biniciog\u030clu-Shumovski (KCBS) inequality became the simplest example of contextuality inequality. Interestingly, there are other contextuality inequalities that, in contrast with KCBS, can be violated by every quantum state [14, 15], thus revealing a property of the measurements known as state-independent contextuality (SIC) [16\u201318].\nDespite their common roots related to the search for hidden variables in quantum theory, nonlocality and contextuality were developed through very distinct research programs, and it was only a few years ago that mathematical approaches to unify both concepts were proposed [19\u201321]. The first proposal to consider nonlocality and contextuality in the same system is due to Kurzyn\u0301ski, Cabello, and Kaszlikowski [22]: two parties could make\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n05 38\n5v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 3\nA pr\n2 02\n2\n2 a CHSH inequality test while one of the parties would also evaluate the KCBS inequality in a subsystem, using, among others, the same incompatible measurements applied in the nonlocality test. The authors proved that in quantum theory \u2013 and in more general no-disturbing theories \u2013 there exists a trade-off relation between nonlocality and contextuality indicators, allowing for the violation of only one of these tested inequalities, and conjectured a fundamental monogamy relation between nonlocality and (state-dependent) contextuality. This monogamy relation was experimentally verified by Zhan et al. [23]; and more general monogamy relations were also identified in other scenarios [24\u201330]. It is worth mentioning, though, that such monogamy relations do not hold for state-independent contextuality, since the contextuality test is trivial. Recently, simultaneous observation of Bell nonlocality and state-independent KochenSpecker contextuality was reported [31].\nIn the work by Kurzyn\u0301ski et al. [22], there was the implicit assumption that nonlocality tests could consider only one measurement from each party. Since, for instance, a test of the KCBS inequality demands five different measurements, each of which performed in a context with a second compatible one, each measurement used in CHSH violation could also be supplemented by a compatible one, leading to new generalized Bell inequalities, in the sense of Ref. [32].\nIn this Letter, we revisit the scenario considered in Ref. [22] and, by considering compatible measurements in the nonlocality test, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum systems can, actually, lead to the synchronous violation of both CHSH and KCBS inequalities. We prove, thus, that there is no fundamental monogamy relation between nonlocality and state-dependent contextuality, even in this simplest scenario where such monogamy was believed to hold. Given that both Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality are important resources for quantum information processing protocols, we believe that this work may be a first step in the direction of devising novel information processing tasks where both nonclassical resources can be used concomitantly.\nThe scenario:\u2014 Consider the following measurement scenario (its main ideas and concepts can be extended in a straightforward manner to more general scenarios): two parties, Alice and Bob, run several rounds of experiments on spatially separated laboratories, each on its respective subsystem of a composite physical system, identically prepared in every round. Let Alice be able to perform mA = |X | possible measurements, labelled by x \u2208 X , each with oA = |A| possible outcomes, labelled by a \u2208 A. Let Bob be able to perform mB = |Y| possible measurements, labelled by y \u2208 Y, each with oB = |B| possible outcomes, labelled by b \u2208 B. Assume, additionally, that some measurements of Bob are compatible, meaning that, in each round, Bob is able to perform sub-\nsets of measurements concomitantly. Let C = {y} be the set contexts of Bob, each element y of which represents a tuple of compatible measurements. Let b \u2208 B|y| be the (ordered) tuple of outcomes of the tuple of measurements y. After sufficiently many rounds, the parties are able to estimate the following set of probabilities, the so-called behavior of the experiment:\np = { p (a,b|x,y) \u2223\u2223\u2223a \u2208 A,b \u2208 B|y|, x \u2208 X ,y \u2208 C} . (1) Let the measurements be performed in an informationally separated way, so that the following no-signalling conditions hold:\u2211\na p (a,b|x,y) = p (b|x,y) = p (b|y) , \u2200 b,y, (2a)\u2211 b p (a,b|x,y) = p (a|x,y) = p (a|x) , \u2200 a, x. (2b)\nFollowing the formalism presented in [32], we define the behavior to be local in this scenario, or, in other words, to admit an LHV model, if there are a variable \u03bb, and probability distributions p (\u03bb), p (a|x, \u03bb), and p (b|y, \u03bb) such that, for all outcomes and measurements:\np (a,b|x,y) = \u222b p (a|x, \u03bb) p (b|y, \u03bb) p (\u03bb) d\u03bb. (3)\nConsider the marginal behavior of Bob\u2019s experiment: pB = { p (b|y) \u2223\u2223\u2223b \u2208 B|y|,y \u2208 C} . (4) Assume it obeys the no-disturbance conditions:\u2211\nb/b\np (b|y) = p (b|y) = p (b|y) , \u2200 b, y, (5)\nwhere b/b means that the sum is over all labels in b except b. We define the marginal behavior of Bob to be noncontextual, or to admit an NCHV model, if there are a variable \u03c3, and probability distributions p (b|y, \u03c3), and p (\u03c3) such that, for all outcomes of all contexts:\np (b|y) = \u222b [\u220f\ny\u2208y p (b|y, \u03c3)\n] p (\u03c3) d\u03c3. (6)\nWith all these definitions in place, let us focus on the particular scenario we are interested in. Let Alice choose between two dichotomic measurements, X = {0, 1}, A = {\u22121, 1} and let Bob have five dichotomic measurements, Y = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {\u22121, 1}, available, with measurement contexts C = {{0, 1} , {1, 2} , {2, 3} , {3, 4} , {4, 0}}. The compatibility relations between all measurements are represented in Fig. 1. The following version of the CHSH inequality holds for all behaviors that are local (according to the definition in (3)):\n\u03b1CHSH = \u3008A0B0\u3009+ \u3008A0B2B3\u3009\n+ \u3008A1B0\u3009 \u2212 \u3008A1B2B3\u3009 LHV 6 2, (7)\n3 where\n\u3008AxBy\u3009 =p (a = b|x, y)\u2212 p (a 6= b|x, y) , (8a) \u3008AxByBy\u2032\u3009 =p (a = b \u00b7 b\u2032|x, y, y\u2032)\n\u2212 p (a 6= b \u00b7 b\u2032|x, y, y\u2032) . (8b)\nNote that, according to the definitions above, the joint measurement of B2B3 can be regarded as a single dichotomic measurement whose outcome is given by the product b \u00b7 b\u2032, where b and b\u2032 are the outcomes of B2 and B3. The left-hand side of inequality (7) is, in essence, equivalent to the left-hand side of the standard CHSH inequality, hence the same local bound.\nThe marginal scenario of Bob is exactly the one considered by Klyachko and co-authors [13]. The marginal behavior pB is contextual if and only if it violates the KCBS inequality (or one of the inequalities obtained from it by relabelings of measurements and/or outcomes):\n\u03b2KCBS = \u3008B0B1\u3009+ \u3008B1B2\u3009+ \u3008B2B3\u3009\n+ \u3008B3B4\u3009 \u2212 \u3008B4B0\u3009 NCHV 6 3, (9)\nwhere\n\u3008ByBy\u2032\u3009 = p (b = b\u2032|y, y\u2032)\u2212 p (b 6= b\u2032|y, y\u2032) . (10)\nThe main theoretical result of this manuscript is the following:\nTheorem: The CHSH inequality (7) and the KCBS inequality (9) can be concomitantly violated in quantum theory.\nProof: We give a direct proof by showing state spaces, measurements and a parameterized family of states obeying all the conditions of the scenario and leading to concomitant violations of both inequalities, for some values of the parameters. The systems of Alice and Bob are a qubit and a qutrit, respectively, whose corresponding basis states are {|0\u3009 , |1\u3009} and {|0\u3009 , |1\u3009 , |2\u3009}.\n(i) For Alice, choose measurement x to be given by the Pauli observables Ax:\nA0 = \u03c3z, A1 = \u03c3x. (11)\n(ii) Measurement y of Bob can be represented by an observable By with eigenvalues in {\u00b11} given as:\nBj = (\u22121)j (1\u2212 2 |vj\u3009\u3008vj |) , (12a)\nfor j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, where 1 is the identity matrix and\n|vj\u3009 \u221d [ cos ( 4\u03c0j\n5\n) |0\u3009+ sin ( 4\u03c0j\n5\n) |1\u3009\n+ \u221a cos (\u03c0\n5\n) |2\u3009 ] . (12b)\nNotice that \u3008vj |v(j+1)mod 5\u3009 = 0, which implies that Bj and B(1+j)mod 5 commute, and, hence, are compatible.\n(iii) Consider the one-parameter family of states:\n|\u03a8 (\u03c6)\u3009 = cos (\u03c6) |u\u3009+ sin (\u03c6) |v\u3009 , (13a)\nwhere, for \u03b8u \u223c 2.868 and \u03b8v \u223c 1.449:\n|u\u3009 = [cos (\u03b8u) |0\u3009+ sin (\u03b8u) |1\u3009]\u2297 |2\u3009 , (13b) |v\u3009 = [cos (\u03b8v) |0\u3009+ sin (\u03b8v) |1\u3009]\u2297 |0\u3009 . (13c)\nAccording to Born\u2019s rule, we have:\n\u3008AxByBy\u2032\u3009 = \u3008\u03a8 (\u03c6)| (Ax \u2297ByBy\u2032) |\u03a8 (\u03c6)\u3009 , (14a) \u3008AxBy\u3009 = \u3008\u03a8 (\u03c6)| (Ax \u2297By) |\u03a8 (\u03c6)\u3009 . (14b)\nAny choice of \u03c6 \u2208 [0.288, 0.553] completes the proof. In the above proof, the choices of Alice are usual for the maximal CHSH violation and the choices for Bob are usual for the maximal KCBS violation. The parameters \u03b8u and \u03b8v were obtained by numerical optimization in the corresponding family, for fixed values of \u03c6. Table I may help in understanding the role played by \u03c6. This constructive proof allows for a natural experimental verification.\nExperimental realization.\u2014 To experimentally test the concomitant violations of both KCBS and CHSH inequalities, we set up an experiment where pairs of photons were employed to encode pairs of qubit-qutrit systems. Schematics of the setup are represented in Fig. 2.\nIn each round of the experiment, the photons are prepared in one of the states |\u03a8(\u03c6)\u3009 of the one-parameter family defined in Eq. (13). The qubit system is encoded in the polarization degree-of-freedom of one photon of the entangled pair, and the qutrit system is hybridly encoded in both the polarizations and the spatial modes of the other photon of the pair.

For Alice, observables Ai are measured via standard polarization measurements using a HWP and a BD. For Bob, cascade Mach-Zehnder interferometers for sequentially measuring observables Bj and B(j+1)mod 5 are used to test the KCBS inequality.\n1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 2.00\n2.25\n2.50\n2.75\n3.00\n3.25\n3.50\n3.75\n4.00\n\ufffd K C\nBS\n\ufffdCHSH\nParametrized curve NPA curve Theoretical points Experimental points\n1 2 3\n4 5\n6 7\n8 9\n10\n11\nFIG. 3.

Synchronous violation of both KCBS and CHSH inequalities are observed for the states |\u03a85(\u03c6)\u3009, |\u03a86(\u03c6)\u3009 and |\u03a87(\u03c6)\u3009 with \u03c6 = 0.351, 0.421, 0.487, respectively. For |\u03a85(\u03c6)\u3009, \u03b1CHSH = 2.1382\u00b10.0442 violates the local bound of the inequality by 3 standard deviations and is in a great agreement with the quantum prediction, 2.1622. Also, \u03b2KCBS = 3.5034\u00b1 0.0529 violates the noncontextual bound of the KCBS inequality by 9 standard deviations and is in great agreement with quantum prediction, 3.5405.

For |\u03a87(\u03c6)\u3009, the violations are by 10 and 3 standard deviations, respectively.\nTo validate non-disturbance in the data and the compatibility between pairs of observables of Bob, we computed, for each state, the distance \u22115 j=1(pj\u2212p\u2032j)2, where pj is the estimated probability of outcome b = 1 of the observable Bj measured in one context, and p \u2032 j is the corresponding probability of the same observable measured in the other context. As shown in Supplementary Material, the distances for all the states being tested are small enough (< 0.0005), which indicates that a very good level of non-disturbance and compatibility between observables holds in our experiment.\nConclusion and discussion:\u2014 In Ref. [22], the authors showed that the CHSH inequality and the KCBS inequality could not be violated simultaneously by quantum systems. Their proof uses a usual hypothesis for Bell scenarios, that each part makes one measurement per round. However, since one part is necessarily measuring other compatible observables in order to show contextuality, it is natural to use the locality concept of Ref. [32].\n5 In this Letter, we show that using a more natural notion of locality, the data available in a joint test of CHSH and KCBS can produce joint violation of both inequalities, defying the concept of monogamy between contextuality and nonlocality. We provide examples of states and measurements that lead to such joint violation, and employ a photonic implementation to experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, the synchronous observation of both Bell nonlocality and statedependent Kochen-Specker contextuality. Our experimental results agree with theoretical predictions, providing a strong evidence that these phenomena are not only no-monogamous, but may be observed and manipulated in simple quantum systems.\nFrom the fundamental point of view, the results presented in this Letter shine new light in the relationship between two of the most important phenomena of the foundations of quantum physics. From the practical point of view, on the other hand, considering the individual importance of Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality to quantum information science, quantum cryptography and quantum computing, we believe that this work may lead to novel possibilities where both concepts could be jointly employed for quantum information processing protocols.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, there are several results on monogamy between Bell nonlocality and Kochen-Specker contextuality that use the same definition of locality as the one used by Kursyn\u0301ski, Cabello, and Kaszlikowski [22]. Clearly, such results cannot be directly transposed to the more natural definition used here. Are there, however, measurement scenarios where both definitions agree on whether nonlocality and contextuality are monogamous? This is an important open question that will be investigated in the future work.\nAcknowledgments:\u2014 R. R. thanks Pawel Kurzyn\u0301ski for fruitful discussions.

            "text": "EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nOur experimental setup consists of three modules: state preparation, Alice\u2019s measurement, and Bob\u2019s measurement. In the state preparation module, entangled photons of 810nm wavelength are generated in a type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process where two joint 0.5mm-thick \u03b2-barium-borate (\u03b2-BBO) crystals are pumped by a CW diode laser with 230mW of power [35, 36]. The visibility of the entangled photonic state is larger than 97%.\nOne of the generated photons is sent to Alice for her measurement. The qubit is encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of Alice\u2019s photon, i.e., {|0\u3009A = |H\u3009 , |1\u3009A = |V \u3009}, where |H\u3009 represents the state of horizontal polarization and |V \u3009 represents vertical polarization.\nThe second photon is then split by a birefringent calcite beam displacer (BD2) into two parallel spatial modes |U\u3009 (up) and |D\u3009 (down). Both polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of this photon are used, hybridly, to encode a qutrit, whose basis states are associated to the horizontal polarization in the upper mode, the vertical polarization in the upper mode, and the horizontal polarization in the lower mode, respectively, i.e., {|0\u3009B = |UH\u3009 , |1\u3009B = |UV \u3009 , |2\u3009B = |DH\u3009}.\nThe preparation stage of the setup was designed to prepare states in the following one-parameter family:\n|\u03a8 (\u03c6)\u3009 = cos (\u03c6) |u\u3009+ sin (\u03c6) |v\u3009 , (15a)\nwhere, for \u03b8u \u223c 2.868 and \u03b8v \u223c 1.449:\n|u\u3009 = [cos (\u03b8u) |0\u3009+ sin (\u03b8u) |1\u3009]\u2297 |2\u3009 , (15b) |v\u3009 = [cos (\u03b8v) |0\u3009+ sin (\u03b8v) |1\u3009]\u2297 |0\u3009 . (15c)\nThe parameter \u03c6 can be adjusted via tuning the setting angles of the half-wave plates (HWPs, H0, HA1 and HB1-HB3). The angles of the HWPs for state preparation are listed in Table II.\nFor the photon which is sent to Alice, the HWP (HA1) is used in the preparation of the state |\u03a8(\u03c6)\u3009 in Eq. (15). The measurement of observable Ai is a standard polarization measurement using HWP (HA2) and a BD (BD1). The HWP (HA2) at 0\n\u25e6 (22.5\u25e6) is used to map the eigenstates of the observable A0 (A1) corresponding to the eigenvalue +1 into the horizontally polarized state (and, in a complementary fashion, eigenvalue \u22121 into the vertically polarized state). The photons are detected at DA1 and DA2 right after BD1. The clicks at DA1 and DA2 correspond to outcomes \u22121 and 1, respectively.\nIn the measurement of Bob\u2019s observables Bj and their correlators, we use cascade Mach-Zehnder interferometers in three steps [37, 38]. Each observable Bj has two eigenvalues \u00b11, one of which is doubly degenerated. To realize\n7 the measurement of Bj , we use four HWPs (HB4-HB7) and two BDs (BD3 and BD4). The angles of HB4 and HB7 are chosen properly \u2013 as displayed in Table III \u2013 so that the photons which are in the state |vj\u3009 in Eq. (12b) of the main text corresponding to the nondegenerated eigenvalue (degenerated eigenvalues) are mapped to the horizontally (vertically) polarized mode after HB7. The HWPs HB5 and HB6 with fixed setting angles are used to fine tune the phase difference between two arms of interferometers. Beam displacer BD4 separates the photons into two different spatial modes corresponding to the two outcomes.\nAfter the measurement of the observable Bj \u2013 whose results were mapped to two orthogonal polarizations \u2013, the state of the system has to be transformed to the eigenstates of Bj before the sequential measurement of B(j+1)mod 5 on the same photon [38]. The outcomes of Bj are each directed into identical but separated devices, i.e., HB8,B9BD5-HB10,B11 for re-creating the eigenstate corresponding to the degenerated eigenvalues, while HB16-BD8-HB17,B18 for re-creating the eigenstate corresponding to the nondegenerated eigenvalue.\nThen, two identical B(j+1)mod 5 measuring devices (one is constructed by HB12-HB15, BD6-BD7, and another by HB19-HB22, BD9-BD10) are built, each of which is connected to one of the output ports of the measuring device of Bj (each output port corresponds to either degenerated or non-degenerated eigenstate of Bj , respectively). The angles of the HWPs for Bob\u2019s measurements are listed in Table III. The joint probabilities of the outcomes, for each context, are estimated by coincidence count rates at detectors (DB1-DB6); the precise assignments of each double (or triple) of outcomes to detectors, for each measured context, are shown in Tables IV and V.\nFor the photon detection, we only register the coincidence rates between the detectors (single-photon avalanche photodiodes with 3ns time window) of Alice and Bob. For each measurement, we record clicks for 2s, and the total coincidence counts are about 5500. To test the KCBS inequality, the correlators \u3008BjB(j+1)mod 5\u3009 are constructed from the measured joint probabilities, p (b, b\u2032|j, (j + 1) mod 5), according to Eq. (10) of the main text. Similarly, we can evaluate the value of \u03b1CHSH for the CHSH inequality with the correlators \u3008AiBj\u3009 and \u3008AiBjBj\u2032\u3009, which are\nconstructed from the measured joint probabilities according to\n\u3008AxBy\u3009 =p (a = b|x, y)\u2212 p (a 6= b|x, y) , (16a) \u3008AxByBy\u2032\u3009 =p (a = b \u00b7 b\u2032|x, y, y\u2032)\u2212 p (a 6= b \u00b7 b\u2032|x, y, y\u2032) . (16b)\nIt is worth mentioning that in the test of the CHSH inequality (7) of the main text, photon loss opens up a detection efficiency loophole in our experiment. A fair-sampling assumption is then taken here, which assumes the events selected out by the photonic coincidence counts is an unbiased representation of the whole sample.\nEXPERIMENTAL DATA\nIn this section, we present the observed values of all correlators that are relevant for the tests of the KCBS and CHSH inequalities. Each of the following Tables corresponds to a specific prepared state, discriminated in the caption."
