Enhanced Functionalization for Broader Pollutant Targeting: Investigating further functionalization of the nanocellulose/alginate beads to target a broader range of pollutants, including anionic pollutants and more diverse heavy metals. This could involve exploring other types of chemical modifications or the incorporation of additional functional materials into the beads.

Regeneration and Reusability Studies: Conducting comprehensive studies on the regeneration and reusability of the composite beads. This research would focus on developing efficient methods for regenerating the beads after use, assessing the impact of regeneration on their structural integrity and adsorption efficiency, and determining the practical lifespan of the beads in water treatment applications.

Scale-Up and Real-World Application Testing: Focusing on scaling up the production process of the nanocellulose/alginate beads and testing their effectiveness in real-world water treatment facilities. This would involve pilot-scale studies to evaluate the operational and economic feasibility of using these beads in existing water treatment systems, including their performance in continuous flow conditions and their impact on the overall treatment process.

Life Cycle and Environmental Impact Analysis: Performing a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental impact analysis of the bead production and usage process. This research would aim to quantify the environmental benefits and potential drawbacks of using these biobased adsorbents in comparison to conventional water treatment materials and methods, considering factors such as carbon footprint, energy consumption, and waste generation.

Integration with Other Water Treatment Technologies: Exploring the integration of the nanocellulose/alginate beads with other water treatment technologies, such as membrane filtration, photocatalytic degradation, or biological treatment processes. This research could aim to develop hybrid treatment systems that leverage the unique properties of the beads for enhanced overall efficiency, targeting a wider range of contaminants and achieving higher water quality standards.
