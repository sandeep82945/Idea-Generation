As usual, we impose the standard assumptions that 1/pj, qj , rj \u2208 L1loc(a, b) are real-valued and rj , pj > 0 a. e. Our main concern in this note is the essential spectrum of self-adjoint realizations associated with \u03c4j and, in particular, conditions on the coefficients which leave the essential spectrum invariant.\nIt is well known that only the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients near the singular endpoints is relevant for the essential spectrum. In particular, the essential spectrum is not affected by boundary conditions or the change of the coefficients on any compact subset of (a, b). Moreover, by imposing an additional Dirichlet boundary condition at an interior point, the problem can be reduced to two subintervals with one regular and one singular endpoint; hence it suffices to consider the case that the endpoint a is regular and b is singular.\nAs mentioned above we are interested in conditions such that two given selfadjoint Sturm\u2013Liouville operators T0 and T1 related to \u03c40 and \u03c41 in L\n2((a, b); r0) and L2((a, b); r1), respectively, have the same essential spectra. There is a vast literature on this topic for the special case r0 = r1, we mention here only [17], where a good introduction and further references can be found.\nHowever, the general case r0 6= r1 has not obtained much attention and to the best of our knowledge there is no (nontrivial) criterion available.

Key words and phrases. essential spectrum, Sturm\u2013Liouville operators, perturbations, relative\noscillation. J. Math. Anal. Appl. 518, 126673 (2023).\n1\nand our introductory remarks one would expect the essential spectrum to remain unchanged if the coefficients of \u03c40 and \u03c41 have the same asymptotic behavior. In fact, if\nlim x\u2192b\nr1(x) r0(x) = 1, lim x\u2192b p1(x) p0(x) = 1, lim x\u2192b q1(x)\u2212 q0(x) r0(x) = 0,\nand q0/r0 is bounded near b, then it turns out in Theorem 3.2 that \u03c40 is limit point at b if and only if \u03c41 is limit point at b, both operators T0 and T1 are semibounded from below, and\n\u03c3ess(T0) = \u03c3ess(T1).\nThe key feature in our proof is relative oscillation theory, which is discussed in Section 2 for general Sturm\u2013Liouville differential expressions of the form (1.1) along the lines of [3, 9, 10, 11]. Roughly speaking, relative oscillation theory is an analog of classical oscillation theory for Sturm\u2013Liouville operators which, rather than measuring the spectrum of one single operator, measures the difference between the spectra of two different operators. This is done by replacing zeros of solutions of one operator by weighted zeros of Wronskians of solutions of two different operators. Besides the essential spectrum we are also interested in the possible accumulation of eigenvalues to the boundary points of the essential spectrum. In this context we note that the relative nonoscillatory property in Theorem 3.2 (iv) does not directly apply to boundary points of the essential spectrum and hence further assumptions on the coefficients are needed to conclude Kneser type results in the spirit of [11]; cf. [8] and also [2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16]. Here we first formulate Theorem 3.4 as a straightforward generalization of [11, Theorem 2.1] to obtain sufficient criteria for accumulation and non-accumulation of eigenvalues to the bottom of the essential spectrum in Theorem 3.5 and Corollary 3.7. These results contain as a special case a variant of Kneser\u2019s classical criterion for general Sturm\u2013Liouville operators of the form (1.1); cf. Corollary 3.6.\nWe remark that in the present paper we are only interested in the question whether two given operators are relatively oscillatory or not. Relative oscillation theory can also be used to compute the precise number of eigenvalues, see [9, 10] (or [14, Sect. 5.5] for a textbook style introduction in the case of regular operators). Relative oscillation theory can also be done in terms of the Maslov index [7], which is particularly convenient in the case of Sturm\u2013Liouville systems.\nAcknowledgements.

            "heading": "2. Relative oscillation theory in a nutshell",
            "text": "2.1. Preliminaries. In this section we recall some results from oscillation theory. An easy introduction in the case of regular problems can be found in [14], for more advanced results we refer to [3, 17, 18]. Our focus will be on the necessary modifications to accommodate the case r0 6= r1.\nConsider two Sturm\u2013Liouville differential expressions\n\u03c4j = 1\nrj\n( \u2212 d\ndx pj\nd\ndx + qj\n) , where j = 0, 1, (2.1)\non an open interval (a, b) with finite left endpoint a and we shall impose the following conditions\n   pj, qj , rj are real-valued functions on (a, b), pj(x) > 0, rj(x) > 0 for almost all x \u2208 (a, b), 1/pj, qj , rj \u2208 L1loc(a, b),\n\u03c4j is regular at a\n(2.2)\nfor j = 0, 1. Note that since we are interested in the essential spectra of self-adjoint realizations of \u03c4j , the assumption that a is regular can be made without loss of generality.\nRecall that a nontrivial real-valued solution uj of (\u03c4j \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0, \u03bb \u2208 R, can be represented in terms of Pru\u0308fer variables, that is, there are absolutely continuous functions \u03c1uj and \u03b8uj such that\nuj(x) = \u03c1uj (x) sin(\u03b8uj (x)) and (pju \u2032 j)(x) = \u03c1uj (x) cos(\u03b8uj (x)), (2.3)\nwhere the Pru\u0308fer radius \u03c1uj is positive and the Pru\u0308fer angle \u03b8uj is uniquely determined once a value of \u03b8uj (x0) is chosen by requiring continuity of \u03b8uj . It satisfies the differential equation\n\u03b8\u2032uj = 1\npj (cos \u03b8uj )\n2 \u2212 (qj \u2212 \u03bbrj)(sin \u03b8uj ) 2. (2.4)\nOne verifies that the Pru\u0308fer angle is strictly increasing at the zeros of the solution uj and it follows that the number of zeros of uj in (a, x) is given by\nNuj (x) :=\n\u2308 \u03b8uj (x)\n\u03c0\n\u2309 \u2212 \u230a \u03b8uj (a)\n\u03c0\n\u230b \u2212 1, x \u2208 (a, b), (2.5)\nwhere \u2308\u00b7\u2309 is the ceiling function and \u230a\u00b7\u230b the floor function. For every x \u2208 (a, b) the solution uj has at most finitely many zeros in (a, x). We note that the function Nuj : (a, b) \u2192 Z is non-negative and increasing.\nIn the following let \u03bb \u2208 R and recall that \u03c40\u2212\u03bb is said to be nonoscillatory if there is a nontrivial real-valued solution u of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 with at most finitely many zeros in (a, b), that is, limx\u2192b Nu(x) < \u221e. Otherwise, \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is called oscillatory. We note that this property is independent of the choice of the solution. The number of zeros of a solution of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 is closely related to the spectra of the selfadjoint realisations of \u03c40. More precisely, if T0 is some self-adjoint realisation of \u03c40 in the weighted Hilbert space L2((a, b); r0) and E0(\u00b7) denotes the spectral measure of T0 then\ndim ran ( E0((\u2212\u221e, \u03bb)) ) < \u221e if and only if lim\nx\u2192b Nu(x) < \u221e (2.6)\nfor some (and hence for all) nontrivial real-valued solutions u of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0. Furthermore, if \u2212\u221e < \u03bb < \u00b5 < \u221e and u and v are nontrivial real-valued solutions of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 and (\u03c40 \u2212 \u00b5)v = 0, respectively, then\ndim ran ( E0((\u03bb, \u00b5)) ) < \u221e if and only if lim inf\nx\u2192b\n( Nv(x) \u2212Nu(x) ) < \u221e. (2.7)\nNote that by (2.6) T0 is semi-bounded from below if and only if there is \u03bb \u2208 R such that limx\u2192b Nu(x) < \u221e, that is, \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is nonoscillatory. In this case \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is nonoscillatory for all \u03bb < inf \u03c3ess(T0).\n2.2. Relative oscillation theory. The central object in this section is themodified Wronskian and its zeros. For solutions u0 and u1 of two different Sturm\u2013Liouville differential expressions,\n(\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0)u0 = 0 and (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1)u1 = 0,\nat two different real values \u03bb0, \u03bb1 the modified Wronskian is defined by\nW (u0, u1)(x) := u0(x) (p1u \u2032 1)(x) \u2212 (p0u \u2032 0)(x)u1(x), x \u2208 (a, b).\nIn the case of real-valued nontrivial solutions u0 and u1 one obtains from (2.3)\nW (u0, u1)(x) = \u03c1u0(x)\u03c1u1 (x) sin ( \u03b8u0(x)\u2212 \u03b8u1(x) )\nand hence W (u0, u1)(x) = 0 if and only if \u03b8u1(x) \u2212 \u03b8u0(x) = k\u03c0 for some k \u2208 Z. We consider the function\nN(u0, u1)(x) :=\n\u2308 \u03b8u1(x) \u2212 \u03b8u0(x)\n\u03c0\n\u2309 \u2212 \u230a \u03b8u1(a)\u2212 \u03b8u0(a)\n\u03c0\n\u230b \u2212 1, x \u2208 (a, b). (2.8)\nRemark 2.1. Nontrivial solutions (when considered as vector-valued solutions (u, pu\u2032) of the associated system) correspond to a path of one-dimensional Lagrangian subspaces and hence these subspaces can be identified with the corresponding Pru\u0308fer angles. In particular, two such path cross whenever the Pru\u0308fer angles agree modulo \u03c0 and hence whenever the Wronskian of the two solutions vanishes. Consequently, (2.8) can be identified with the Maslov index of the two solutions on the interval (a, x) (cf. [7]).\nLet u2 be a real-valued nontrivial solution of (\u03c42 \u2212 \u03bb2)u = 0, where \u03c42 is a differential expression of the form (2.1) satisfying (2.2). It follows from (2.5) and the properties of the ceiling function \u2308\u00b7\u2309 and the floor function \u230a\u00b7\u230b that\nNu1(x) \u2212Nu0(x) \u2212 3 \u2264 N(u0, u1)(x) \u2264 Nu1(x) \u2212Nu0(x) + 1, (2.9)\n\u2212N(u1, u0)(x) \u2212 2 \u2264 N(u0, u1)(x) \u2264 \u2212N(u1, u0)(x), and (2.10)\nN(u0, u1)(x) +N(u1, u2)(x)\u2212 1 \u2264 N(u0, u2)(x) \u2264 N(u0, u1)(x) +N(u1, u2)(x) + 1 (2.11) for all x \u2208 (a, b).\nLemma 2.2. Suppose that (2.2) holds for j = 0. Let u and v be nontrivial realvalued solutions of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 for \u03bb \u2208 R. If u and v are linearly dependent solutions then N(u, v)(x) = \u22121 for all x \u2208 (a, b). Otherwise N(u, v)(x) = 0 for all x \u2208 (a, b).\nProof. Since u and v are solutions of the same differential equation, the Wronskian is constant on [a, b). If u and v are linearly dependent then the Wronskian vanishes everywhere and due to the representation by means of Pru\u0308fer variables we see \u03b8v(x)\u2212\u03b8u(x) = k\u03c0 for all x \u2208 [a, b) and a suitable k \u2208 Z. This implies N(u, v)(x) = \u22121 for all x \u2208 (a, b). Otherwise, if both functions are linearly independent then the Wronskian has no zeros in [a, b). Hence, the difference of Pru\u0308fer angles \u03b8v \u2212 \u03b8u does not attain any integer multiple of \u03c0. By continuity we have \u03b8v(x) \u2212 \u03b8u(x) \u2208 (k\u03c0, (k + 1)\u03c0) for all x \u2208 [a, b) and some k \u2208 Z, which shows N(u, v)(x) = 0.\nUnder some additional assumptions on the coefficients of \u03c4j it turns out that the function N(u0, u1) in (2.8) has similar properties as the functions Nuj in (2.5).\nLemma 2.3. Let uj be real-valued nontrivial solutions of (\u03c4j\u2212\u03bbj)u = 0 for j = 0, 1, and \u03bbj \u2208 R.\n(i) Assume that the conditions\np0 \u2265 p1 and q0 \u2212 \u03bb0r0 \u2265 q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1 (2.12)\nhold. Then N(u0, u1) is an increasing function with N(u0, u1)(x) \u2265 \u22121 for all x \u2208 (a, b).\n(ii) Assume that the conditions\np0 \u2265 p1 and q0 \u2212 \u03bb0r0 > q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1 (2.13)\nhold. Then for every x \u2208 (a, b) the Wronskian W (u0, u1) has at most finitely many zeros in (a, x) and the value N(u0, u1)(x) coincides with the number of zeros of W (u0, u1) in (a, x).\nProof. (i) Let a \u2264 \u03be < x < b and assume that \u03b8u1(\u03be) \u2212 \u03b8u0(\u03be) \u2208 [k\u03c0, (k + 1)\u03c0) for some k \u2208 Z. By (2.4) and the angle addition formulae sin(\u03b1 + \u03b2) sin(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) = cos2 \u03b2 \u2212 cos2 \u03b1 = sin2 \u03b1\u2212 sin2 \u03b2 we obtain\n\u03b8\u2032u1 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2032 u0 =\n( 1\np1 \u2212\n1\np0\n) cos2 \u03b8u1 + ( (q0 \u2212 \u03bb0r0)\u2212 (q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1) ) sin2 \u03b8u0\n\u2212 (q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1) ( sin2 \u03b8u1 \u2212 sin 2 \u03b8u0 ) \u2212 1\np0\n( cos2 \u03b8u0 \u2212 cos 2 \u03b8u1 )\n=\n( 1\np1 \u2212\n1\np0\n) cos2 \u03b8u1 + ( (q0 \u2212 \u03bb0r0)\u2212 (q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1) ) sin2 \u03b8u0\n\u2212 (\u22121)k ( 1\np0 + q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1\n) sin(\u03b8u0 + \u03b8u1) sin \u03b4,\nwhere \u03b4 stands for \u03b8u1 \u2212 \u03b8u0 \u2212 k\u03c0. We consider the functions\nf =\n( 1\np1 \u2212\n1\np0\n) cos2 \u03b8u1 + ( (q0 \u2212 \u03bb0r0)\u2212 (q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1) ) sin2 \u03b8u0 (2.14)\nand\nh = \u2212(\u22121)k ( 1\np0 + q1 \u2212 \u03bb1r1\n) sin(\u03b8u0 + \u03b8u1) sin \u03b4\n\u03b4 .\nClearly, we have \u03b4\u2032 = f + h\u03b4, where the functions f , h are integrable on (a, c) for all c \u2208 (a, b). Consider the positive function g given by\ng(x) = exp ( \u2212 \u222b x\na\nh(t) dt ) .\nThen\n(g\u03b4)\u2032 = \u2212\u03b4hg + (f + h\u03b4)g = fg \u2265 0 (2.15)\nby (2.14) and (2.12). Hence, g\u03b4 is an increasing function. For x > \u03be the estimate\ng(x) ( \u03b8u1(x)\u2212\u03b8u0(x)\u2212k\u03c0 ) = (g\u03b4)(x) \u2265 (g\u03b4)(\u03be) = g(\u03be) ( \u03b8u1(\u03be)\u2212\u03b8u0(\u03be)\u2212k\u03c0 ) (2.16)\nholds. As \u03b8u1(\u03be)\u2212 \u03b8u0(\u03be) \u2208 [k\u03c0, (k + 1)\u03c0), (2.16) implies \u03b8u1(x)\u2212 \u03b8u0(x) \u2265 k\u03c0 and\u230a \u03b8u1(\u03be)\u2212 \u03b8u0(\u03be)\n\u03c0\n\u230b \u2264 \u2308 \u03b8u1(\u03be)\u2212 \u03b8u0(\u03be)\n\u03c0\n\u2309 \u2264 \u2308 \u03b8u1(x)\u2212 \u03b8u0(x)\n\u03c0\n\u2309 .\nThis shows N(u0, u1)(\u03be) \u2264 N(u0, u1)(x) and with \u03be = a one sees N(u0, u1)(x) \u2265 \u22121.\n(ii) Under the stronger condition (2.13), the inequality in (2.15) is strict (almost everywhere in a neighbourhood of \u03be) and, hence, also the inequality in (2.16). In particular, we see that for x > \u03be\n\u03b8u1(\u03be)\u2212 \u03b8u0(\u03be) \u2265 k\u03c0 implies \u03b8u1(x)\u2212 \u03b8u0(x) > k\u03c0 (2.17)\nand for x < \u03be the inequality in (2.16) changes accordingly and\n\u03b8u1(\u03be)\u2212 \u03b8u0(\u03be) \u2264 k\u03c0 implies \u03b8u1(x) \u2212 \u03b8u0(x) < k\u03c0. (2.18)\nIn what follows, choose x \u2208 (a, b) and k \u2208 Z with \u03b8u1(a) \u2212 \u03b8u0(a) \u2208 [k\u03c0, (k + 1)\u03c0) which means \u230a\u03b8u1(a)\u2212 \u03b8u0(a)\u230b = k\u03c0. Moreover, by (2.17), we have\n\u03b8u1(y)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y) \u2208 (k\u03c0,\u221e) for all y \u2208 (a, x).\nIf \u03b8u1(x)\u2212\u03b8u0 (x) \u2208 (k\u03c0, (k+1)\u03c0], then N(u0, u1)(x) = 0 by definition. By (2.17) there is no y \u2208 (a, x) with \u03b8u1(y)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y) \u2265 (k + 1)\u03c0. Therefore\n\u03b8u1(y)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y) \u2208 (k\u03c0, (k + 1)\u03c0) for all y \u2208 (a, x).\nAs the Wronskian W (u0, u1) is zero if and only if \u03b8u1(y)\u2212\u03b8u0(y) equals l\u03c0 for some l \u2208 Z, we see that on the interval (a, x) there are no zeros of the Wronskian. This coincides with the value of N(u0, u1)(x).\nIf \u03b8u1(x)\u2212 \u03b8u0(x) \u2208 ((k+1)\u03c0, (k+2)\u03c0], then N(u0, u1)(x) = 1 by definition. By (2.17) there is no y \u2208 (a, x) with \u03b8u1(y)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y) \u2265 (k + 2)\u03c0. Therefore\n\u03b8u1(y)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y) \u2208 (k\u03c0, (k + 2)\u03c0) for all y \u2208 (a, x).\nAs the function \u03b8u1 \u2212\u03b8u0 is continuous and takes in a a value below (k+1)\u03c0 and in x a value above (k+1)\u03c0, there exists y1 \u2208 (a, x) with \u03b8u1(y1)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y1) = (k+1)\u03c0, which is a zero of the Wronskian. An application of (2.17) and (2.18) with \u03be = y1 shows that this is the only zero of the Wronskian in the interval (a, x), which coincides with the value of N(u0, u1)(x).\nIf \u03b8u1(x) \u2212 \u03b8u0(x) \u2208 ((k + 2)\u03c0, (k + 3)\u03c0], then N(u0, u1)(x) = 2 by definition. Similar as above, by (2.17), there is no y \u2208 (a, x) with \u03b8u1(y)\u2212 \u03b8u0(y) \u2265 (k + 3)\u03c0 and we conclude with (2.17) and (2.18) that the Wronskian on the interval (a, x) has N(u0, u1)(x) = 2 zeros. Continuing in this way shows the statement.\nAn important special case in Lemma 2.3 (ii) is the case that u0 and v0 are realvalued solutions of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 and (\u03c40 \u2212 \u00b5)v = 0, respectively, where \u03bb < \u00b5. In this situation (2.13) holds with p0 = p1 and q0 \u2212 \u03bbr0 > q0 \u2212 \u00b5r0 and hence N(u0, v0)(x) < \u221e is the number of zeros of the Wronskian W (u0, v0) in (a, x).\nAs a consequence we also conclude the following useful version of Sturm\u2019s comparison theorem.\nCorollary 2.4 (Sturm\u2019s comparison theorem). Let uj be real-valued nontrivial solutions of (\u03c4j\u2212\u03bbj)u = 0 for j = 0, 1, and \u03bbj \u2208 R, and let x0 and x1 be consecutive zeros of u0 in (a, b). If the condition (2.13) holds, then there is at least one zero y \u2208 (x0, x1) of u1.\nProof. Let \u03b8u0(x0) = k\u03c0, \u03b8u0(x1) = (k + 1)\u03c0, and \u03b8u1(x0) \u2208 [j\u03c0, (j + 1)\u03c0) for some k, j \u2208 Z. Then\n(j \u2212 k)\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8u1(x0)\u2212 \u03b8u0(x0)\nand by (2.17)\n(j \u2212 k)\u03c0 < \u03b8u1(x1)\u2212 \u03b8u0(x1) = \u03b8u1(x1)\u2212 (k + 1)\u03c0.\nTherefore, \u03b8u1(x1) > (j + 1)\u03c0 which yields the existence of y \u2208 (x0, x1) with \u03b8u1(y) = (j + 1)\u03c0, that is u1(y) = 0.\nWe next introduce the concept of relative oscillation. The following definition is due to Kru\u0308ger and Teschl [9, 10, 11].\nDefinition 2.5. For j = 0, 1 and \u03bbj \u2208 R consider nontrivial real-valued solutions uj of (\u03c4j \u2212 \u03bbj)u = 0. We say that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1 if both limits\nN(u0, u1) := lim inf x\u2192b N(u0, u1)(x) and N(u0, u1) := lim sup x\u2192b N(u0, u1)(x)\nare finite. Otherwise, \u03c40 \u2212\u03bb0 is called relatively oscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212\u03bb1.\nIt turns out that the definition of relative (non)oscillation does not depend on the particular solutions. In fact, for another pair of nontrivial real-valued solutions v0, v1 of of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0)u = 0 and (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1)u = 0, respectively, the inequality (2.11) applied twice together with Lemma 2.2 implies\nN(v0, v1)(x) \u2264 N(v0, u0)(x) +N(u0, v1)(x) + 1\n\u2264 N(v0, u0)(x) +N(u0, u1)(x) +N(u1, v1)(x) + 2 \u2264 N(u0, u1)(x) + 2\nand\nN(v0, v1)(x) \u2265 N(v0, u0)(x) +N(u0, v1)(x)\u2212 1\n\u2265 N(v0, u0)(x) +N(u0, u1)(x) +N(u1, v1)(x) \u2212 2 \u2265 N(u0, u1)(x) \u2212 4\nfor all x \u2208 (a, b). Hence, the limits N(u0, u1) and N(u0, u1) are finite if and only if N(v0, v1) and N(v0, v1) are finite. Furthermore, the notion relatively nonoscillatory gives rise to an equivalence relation. Below we will use the following facts which are direct consequences of (2.10) and (2.11). For this let \u03c42 be a differential expression of the form (2.1) satisfying (2.2).\n(a) If \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 is relatively oscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1, then \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1 is relatively oscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0. (b) If \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 is relatively oscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1 and \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1 is relatively oscillatory with respect to \u03c42 \u2212 \u03bb2, then \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 is relatively oscillatory with respect to \u03c42 \u2212 \u03bb2.\nNote also that under assumption (2.12) or (2.13) the function N(u0, u1) is increasing and hence in that case\nlim x\u2192b N(u0, u1)(x) = N(u0, u1) = N(u0, u1) \u2264 \u221e. (2.19)\nThe next lemma describes the relationship between classical and relative oscillation; cf. [10, Lemma 4.5].\nLemma 2.6. Suppose that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 is nonoscillatory. Then \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1 is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 if and only if \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1 is nonoscillatory.\nProof. Let u0 and u1 be nontrivial real-valued solutions of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0)u0 = 0 and (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1)u1 = 0, respectively. Since \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0 is nonoscillatory the solution u0 has\nat most finitely many zeros in (a, b) and hence we have 0 \u2264 Nu0(x) \u2264 n0 for some n0 \u2208 N and all x \u2208 (a, b). Therefore (2.9) implies\nNu1(x) \u2212 n0 \u2212 3 \u2264 Nu1(x)\u2212Nu0(x) \u2212 3\n\u2264 N(u0, u1)(x)\n\u2264 Nu1(x)\u2212Nu0(x) + 1 \u2264 Nu1(x) + 1\nfor all x \u2208 (a, b). This shows that limx\u2192b Nu1(x) is finite if and only if (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb0) is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb1).\nAlong the lines of (2.7) we obtain a result on the finiteness and infiniteness of the spectrum. Again E0(\u00b7) denotes the spectral measure of T0; cf. [17, Sect. 14].\nLemma 2.7. Let T0 be a self-adjoint realisation of \u03c40 in L 2((a, b); r0) and fix \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R with \u03bb < \u00b5. Then dim ran(E0((\u03bb, \u00b5))) < \u221e if and only if \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u00b5.\nProof. Let u0 and v0 be nontrivial real-valued solutions of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 and (\u03c40 \u2212 \u00b5)v = 0, respectively. Then (2.9) and (2.19) give\nlim inf x\u2192\u221e\n( Nv0(x)\u2212Nu0 (x) ) \u22123 \u2264 N(u0, v0) = N(u0, v0) \u2264 lim inf\nx\u2192\u221e\n( Nv0(x)\u2212Nu0 (x) ) +1\nand hence the statement follows from (2.7).\nObserve that dim ran(E0((\u03bb, \u00b5))) < \u221e implies dim ran(E0((\u03bb, \u03b7))) < \u221e for all \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03bb, \u00b5] and hence Lemma 2.7 also shows that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03b7 for all \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03bb, \u00b5].\nThe next result extends [10, Theorem 4.6] to r0 6= r1.\nTheorem 2.8. Let Tj be self-adjoint realizations of \u03c4j in L 2((a, b); rj) with spectral measures Ej(\u00b7) for j = 0, 1. Fix \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R with \u03bb < \u00b5 and assume that dim ranE0((\u03bb, \u00b5)) < \u221e. If \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb and \u03c40\u2212\u00b5 is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41\u2212\u00b5, then dim ran(E1((\u03bb, \u00b5))) < \u221e.\nProof. From dim ranE0((\u03bb, \u00b5)) < \u221e and Lemma 2.7 it follows that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u00b5. As \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb and \u03c40 \u2212 \u00b5 is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u00b5 by assumption we conclude with the properties (a) and (b) from above that \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u00b5. With the help of Lemma 2.7 we now obtain dim ranE1((\u03bb, \u00b5)) < \u221e."

            "text": "In this section we shall consider the Sturm\u2013Liouville expressions \u03c4j , j = 0, 1, in (2.1)\u2013(2.2). Our main objective is to prove a result on the invariance of the essential spectrum for the self-adjoint realizations of \u03c4j in L\n2((a, b); rj). In this context it seems natural to impose a limit point assumption for the right endpoint b; cf. Theorem 3.2 (i). We start with a useful consequence of Theorem 2.8, which provides the inclusion of the essential spectra.\nProposition 3.1. Let Tj be self-adjoint realizations of \u03c4j in L 2((a, b); rj) for j = 0, 1, and assume that \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb for every \u03bb \u2208 R \\ \u03c3ess(T0). Then \u03c3ess(T1) \u2282 \u03c3ess(T0).\nProof. For \u03b7 \u2208 R \\ \u03c3ess(T0) choose \u03bb < \u03b7 < \u00b5 such that [\u03bb, \u00b5] \u2282 R \\ \u03c3ess(T0). Then we have dim ranE0((\u03bb, \u00b5)) < \u221e and it follows from the assumption that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41\u2212\u03bb and \u03c40\u2212\u00b5 is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c41 \u2212 \u00b5. Now Theorem 2.8 implies dim ranE1((\u03bb, \u00b5)) < \u221e which leads to \u03b7 \u2208 R \\ \u03c3ess(T1).\nNext, we obtain a criterion for two Sturm\u2013Liouville differential expressions being relatively nonoscillatory with respect to each other involving all coefficients. The special case r0 = r1 was treated in [10].\nTheorem 3.2. Let Tj be self-adjoint realizations of \u03c4j in L 2((a, b); rj) for j = 0, 1, and assume the following conditions at the endpoint b:\n(\u03b1) lim x\u2192b r1(x) r0(x) = 1, lim x\u2192b p1(x) p0(x) = 1, lim x\u2192b q1(x)\u2212q0(x) r0(x) = 0; (\u03b2) q0/r0 is bounded near b.\nThen the following assertions hold:\n(i) \u03c40 is limit point at b if and only if \u03c41 is limit point at b; (ii) \u03c3ess(T0) = \u03c3ess(T1); (iii) T0 and T1 are semibounded from below; (iv) \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb for every \u03bb \u2208\nR \\ \u03c3ess(T0).\nObserve that by Theorem 3.2 (i) \u03c40 is limit circle (or regular) at b if and only if \u03c41 is limit circle (or regular) at b, in which case \u03c3ess(T0) = \u03c3ess(T1) = \u2205.\nRemark 3.3. Observe that the conditions (\u03b1) and (\u03b2) in Theorem 3.2 are equivalent to the conditions\n(\u03b1\u2032) lim x\u2192b r0(x) r1(x) = 1, lim x\u2192b p0(x) p1(x) = 1, lim x\u2192b q0(x)\u2212q1(x) r1(x) = 0; (\u03b2\u2032) q1/r1 is bounded near b.\nIn fact, this follows immediately from\nq0 \u2212 q1 r1 = \u2212 q1 \u2212 q0 r0 \u00b7 r0 r1 , q1 r1 =\n( q1 \u2212 q0\nr0 + q0 r0 ) r0 r1 .\nand hence the roles of \u03c40 and \u03c41 can be interchanged in the Theorem 3.2.\nProof of Theorem 3.2. (i) By assumption (\u03b1) there is c \u2208 (a, b) such that\np0/2 < p1 < 3p0/2 and r0/2 < r1 < 3r0/2 (3.1)\na. e. on (c, b). This yields L2((c, b); r0) = L 2((c, b); r1). Since qj/rj , j = 0, 1, is bounded near b by (\u03b2) and (\u03b2\u2032) (see Remark 3.3), the differential expression \u03c4j is in the limit point case at b if and only if\n\u03c4\u0302j = 1\nrj\n( \u2212 d\ndx pj\nd\ndx\n)\nis in the limit point case at b; cf. [18, Corollary 7.4.1]. Here \u03c4\u0302ju = 0 is explicitly solvable with a fundamental system given by\nuj(x) =\n\u222b x\nc\n1\npj(t) dt, vj(x) = 1.\nOne has v0 = v1 and 2/3u1 \u2264 u0 \u2264 2u1 by (3.1). Hence the number of L2-solutions near b is the same for the differential expressions \u03c4\u03020, \u03c4\u03021, \u03c40, and \u03c41. In particular, this implies (i).\n(ii)\u2013(iv) By condition (\u03b2) there is d \u2208 (a, b) such that\n\u03bbd := ess inf x\u2208(d,b)\nq0(x) r0(x) > \u2212\u221e\nand, thus, q0 \u2212 \u03bbdr0 \u2265 0 a. e. on (d, b). This implies that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bbd is nonoscillatory (see, e. g. [18, Lemma 7.4.1]) and hence T0 is semibounded from below.\nLet \u03bb \u2208 R \\ \u03c3ess(T0) and consider the differential expression\n\u03c4\u03031 = 1\nr0\n( \u2212 d\ndx p1\nd\ndx + q\u03031\n) , where q\u03031 := q1 + \u03bbr0 \u2212 \u03bbr1,\non (a, b). Then r0(x) \u22121(q0(x)\u2212 q\u03031(x)) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 b. Therefore, by [10, Lemma 4.7] applied to \u03c40 \u2212\u03bb and \u03c4\u03031 \u2212 \u03bb the differential expression \u03c4\u03031 \u2212\u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb. Because of\nr0 r1 (\u03c4\u03031 \u2212 \u03bb)u = (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb)u\nthe differential equations (\u03c41 \u2212\u03bb)u = 0 and (\u03c4\u03031 \u2212\u03bb)u = 0 share the same solutions. This implies that \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is relatively nonoscillatory with respect to \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb for all \u03bb \u2208 R \\ \u03c3ess(T0) and hence Proposition 3.1 yields \u03c3ess(T1) \u2282 \u03c3ess(T0). The same reasoning with the roles of \u03c40 and \u03c41 reversed together with Remark 3.3 shows the semiboundedness of T1 and the inclusion \u03c3ess(T0) \u2282 \u03c3ess(T1).\nNote that the relative nonoscillatory property in Theorem 3.2 (iv) does not apply to boundary points of the essential spectrum and hence no additional information on the possible accumulation of eigenvalues at the boundary of the essential spectrum can be directly obtained.\nThe following is a straightforward extension of [11, Theorem 2.1] to the case r0 6= r1. For its formulation suppose that (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0 has a positive solution and let u0 be the corresponding minimal (principal) positive solution of (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb)u0 = 0 near b, that is, \u222b b\nc\ndt\np0(t)u0(t)2 = \u221e\nfor c \u2208 (a, b). A second linearly independent solution v0 satisfying W (u0, v0) = 1 is given by d\u2019Alembert\u2019s formula, see, e.g., [1],\nv0(x) := u0(x)\n\u222b x\nc\ndt\np0(t)u0(t)2 . (3.2)\nTheorem 3.4. Let \u03bb denote the minimum of the spectrum of T0 (see Theorem 3.2), suppose that \u03c40 \u2212 \u03bb has a positive solution near b, and let u0 be a minimal positive solution near b. Define v0 by d\u2019Alembert\u2019s formula (3.2) and abbreviate\n\u2206(x) := p0(x)v0(x) 2 ( u0(x) 2 ( q1(x)\u2212 q0(x) \u2212 \u03bb(r1(x) \u2212 r0(x)) )\n+ (p0(x)u \u2032 0(x)) 2 p1(x) \u2212 p0(x)\np1(x)p0(x)\n) .\n(3.3)\nIn addition, suppose\nlim x\u2192b v0(x) p0(x)u \u2032\n0(x) p1(x) \u2212 p0(x)\np1(x) = lim x\u2192b\np1(x) \u2212 p0(x)\np1(x) = 0.\nThen \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is oscillatory if\nlim sup x\u2192b\n\u2206(x) < \u2212 1\n4\nand nonoscillatory if\nlim inf x\u2192b\n\u2206(x) > \u2212 1\n4 .\nProof. This is immediate from [11, Theorem 2.1] since the transformation qj \u2192 qj\u2212\u03bbrj reduces everything to the case \u03bb = 0 in which case rj becomes irrelevant.\nIn the following we show a variant of Kneser\u2019s classical result [8] (see also [15, Theorem 9.42 and Corollary 9.43]). To this end we recall the iterated logarithm logn(x) which is defined recursively via\nlog0(x) := x and logn(x) := log(logn\u22121(x)).\nHere we use the convention log(x) := log |x| for negative values of x. Then logn(x) will be continuous for x > en\u22121 and positive for x > en, where e\u22121 := \u2212\u221e and en := e en\u22121 . Abbreviate further\nLn(x) := 1\nlog\u2032n+1(x) =\nn\u220f\nj=0\nlogj(x) and Qn(x) := \u2212 1\n4\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n1\nLj(x)2 .\nHere the usual convention that \u2211\n\u22121 j=0 \u2261 0 is used, that is, Q0(x) = 0. In what\nfollows we consider as the underlying interval the interval (a,\u221e).\nTheorem 3.5. Consider the Sturm\u2013Liouville differential expression \u03c41 on (a,\u221e) and assume, in addition, that the limits\nq\u221e := lim x\u2192\u221e q1(x), p\u221e := lim x\u2192\u221e p1(x), r\u221e := lim x\u2192\u221e r1(x) (3.4)\nexist in R such that p\u221e > 0 and r\u221e > 0. For n \u2208 N0 abbreviate\n\u2206\u0303(x) :=Ln(x) 2\n q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212Qn(x) \u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e r1(x) + 1 4\n( n\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n1\nLj(x)\n)2( 1\u2212\np\u221e p1(x)\n)  .\n(3.5)\nThen \u03c41 is in the limit-point case at \u221e, every self-adjoint realisation T1 of \u03c41 in L2((a,\u221e); r1) is semibounded from below, and\n\u03c3ess(T1) = [q\u221e/r\u221e,\u221e). (3.6)\nFurthermore, the following assertions hold:\n(i) If\nlim sup x\u2192\u221e\n\u2206\u0303(x) < \u2212 1\n4 , (3.7)\nthen \u03c3(T1) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) consists of infinitely many simple eigenvalues which accumulate at q\u221e/r\u221e;\n(ii) If\nlim inf x\u2192\u221e\n\u2206\u0303(x)2 > \u2212 1\n4 , (3.8)\nthen \u03c3(T1) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) consists of finitely many simple eigenvalues.\nProof. The property of \u03c41\u2212\u03bb to be oscillatory or nonoscillatory does not depend on the left endpoint of the interval (a,\u221e). The same applies for the essential spectrum and the semi-boundedness. Therefore we can assume without loss of generality that a = en and, hence, u0(x) := \u221a Ln\u22121(x) is positive, where we set L\u22121(x) = 1.\nWe choose r0(x) := r\u221e, p0(x) := p\u221e, q0(x) := q\u221e+p\u221eQn(x) and \u03bb := q\u221e r\u221e . One verifies in the same way as in the proof of [11, Corollary 2.3] that \u2212u\u2032\u20320 +Qnu0 = 0 and hence\n( \u03c40 \u2212\nq\u221e r\u221e\n) u0 = 0, where \u03c40 = 1\nr\u221e\n( \u2212 d\ndx p\u221e\nd\ndx + q\u221e + p\u221eQn\n) .\nIt is clear that u0 is the minimal positive solution near \u221e and the solution v0 given by d\u2019Alemberts formula is\nv0(x) = 1\np\u221e\n\u221a Ln\u22121(x)\n\u222b x\nen\nlog\u2032n(t) dt = 1\np\u221e\n\u221a Ln\u22121(x) logn(x).\nLet T0 be a self-adjoint realization of \u03c40 in L 2((en,\u221e)) with Dirichlet boundary conditions in en. From q0(x) = q\u221e + p\u221eQn(x) \u2265 q\u221e for x \u2208 (en,\u221e) and limx\u2192\u221e q0(x) = q\u221e we conclude\n\u03c3(T0) = \u03c3ess(T0) = [q\u221e/r\u221e,\u221e).\nBy Theorem 3.2 \u03c41 is in limit point at \u221e, T1 is semibounded and (3.6) holds. For the function \u2206 in Theorem 3.4 we obtain\n\u2206(x) = 1\np\u221e logn(x)\n2Ln\u22121(x) ( Ln\u22121(x) ( q1(x) \u2212 q\u221e \u2212 p\u221eQn(x) \u2212\nq\u221e r\u221e\n(r1(x)\u2212 r\u221e) )\n+ ( p\u221e \u221a Ln\u22121(x) \u2032)2 p1(x)\u2212 p\u221e p1(x)p\u221e\n)\n= L2n(x)\n( q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212Qn(x) \u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e r1(x)\n)\n+ logn(x) 2Ln\u22121(x)\n( 1\n2 \u221a Ln\u22121(x) L\u2032n\u22121(x)\n)2 p1(x)\u2212 p\u221e\np1(x) .\nWe use the formula L\u2032m(x) = Lm(x) \u2211m j=0 Lj(x) \u22121 from [11] and conclude\n\u2206(x) = L2n(x)\n( q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212Qn(x)\u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e r1(x)\n) +L2n(x) ( 1\n2\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n1\nLj(x)\n)2 p1(x)\u2212 p\u221e\np1(x) .\nThus the function \u2206 in Theorem 3.4 coincides with \u2206\u0303. Now the statements (i) and (ii) follow from Theorem 3.4 and (2.6).\nFor the special case n = 0 Theorem 3.5 reduces to the following statement, which extends the classical Kneser result from [8] to the case of non-constant coefficients p1 and r1.\nCorollary 3.6. Assume that the limits in (3.4) exist in R such that p\u221e > 0 and r\u221e > 0. Then the following assertions hold:\n(i) If\nlim sup x\u2192\u221e\nx2 (q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e\nr1(x) ) < \u2212 1\n4 ,\nthen \u03c3(T1) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) consists of infinitely many simple eigenvalues which accumulate at q\u221e/r\u221e;\n(ii) If\nlim inf x\u2192\u221e\nx2 (q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e\nr1(x) ) > \u2212 1\n4 ,\nthen \u03c3(T1) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) consists of finitely many simple eigenvalues.\nIn the next corollary we impose an additional condition on the coefficient p1 and obtain from Theorem 3.5 for n \u2265 1 simplified criteria for the spectrum in (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) to be infinite or finite.\nCorollary 3.7. Assume that the limits in (3.4) exist in R such that p\u221e > 0 and r\u221e > 0, and let\np1(x) = p\u221e + o ( x2 Ln(x)2 ) (3.9)\nfor some n \u2208 N. Then the following assertions hold:\n(i) If\nlim sup x\u2192\u221e\nL2n(x)\n( q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212Qn(x) \u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e r1(x)\n) < \u2212 1\n4 ,\nthen \u03c3(T1) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) consists of infinitely many simple eigenvalues which accumulate at q\u221e/r\u221e;\n(ii) If\nlim inf x\u2192\u221e\nL2n(x)\n( q1(x)\np\u221e \u2212Qn(x) \u2212 q\u221e p\u221er\u221e r1(x)\n) > \u2212 1\n4 ,\nthen \u03c3(T1) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, q\u221e/r\u221e) consists of finitely many simple eigenvalues.\nProof. Assertions (i) and (ii) follow from Theorem 3.5 if we show that\nlim x\u2192\u221e\nL2n(x) 1\n4\n( n\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n1\nLj(x)\n)2( 1\u2212\np\u221e p1(x)\n) = 0. (3.10)\nIn fact, it is easy to see that\nn\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n1\nLj(x) =\n1 x + o(1/x), and hence\n( n\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n1\nLj(x)\n)2 = 1\nx2 + o(1/x2),\nthat is, ( n\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nL\u22121j\n)2 = 1\nx2 + w(x), where lim x\u2192\u221e x2w(x) = 0.\nFurthermore, from (3.9) we conclude\n1\u2212 p\u221e p1(x) = p1(x) \u2212 p\u221e p1(x) =\nk(x)\np\u221e + k(x) , where lim x\u2192\u221e\nLn(x) 2k(x)\nx2 = 0,\nand therefore\nlim x\u2192\u221e\nL2n(x)\nx2 k(x) p\u221e + k(x) = 0 and lim x\u2192\u221e L2n(x)w(x) k(x) p\u221e + k(x) = 0.\nThis implies (3.10) and hence (i) and (ii) follow.\nAs a last result in this context we formulate a variant of Theorem 3.4, where the pointwise limits are replaced by averaged ones; cf. [11, Theorem 2.5]. We leave it to the reader to formulate further generalizations of the results in [11] to the case r0 6= r1 by using the transformation qj \u2192 qj \u2212 \u03bbrj from the proof of Theorem 3.4.\nTheorem 3.8. Suppose the same assumptions and the same notation as in Theorem 3.4. Suppose, in addition, that the functions \u2206 and and \u03c1 := (p0u0v0) \u22121 are both bounded and \u03c1 satisfies \u03c1 = o(1) and 1 \u2113 \u222b \u2113 0 |\u03c1(x+ t)\u2212 \u03c1(x)| dt = o(\u03c1(x)).\nThen \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is oscillatory if\ninf \u2113>0 lim sup x\u2192b\n\u222b x+\u2113\nx\n\u2206(t)dt < \u2212 1\n4\nand \u03c41 \u2212 \u03bb is nonoscillatory if\nsup \u2113>0 lim inf x\u2192b\n\u222b x+\u2113\nx\n\u2206(t)dt > \u2212 1\n4 ."
