Exploring Alternative Low-Temperature Processes for TiO2 Deposition: Investigate other low-temperature deposition techniques for TiO2, beyond thermal evaporation and annealing, to improve the passivation quality and efficiency of silicon solar cells. Methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at lower temperatures or plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) could be explored to achieve better control over the TiO2 layer's properties and to reduce thermal budget.

Study of TiO2 Layer Thickness and Composition Optimization: Conduct detailed studies on the optimization of TiO2 layer thickness and its stoichiometry. This research could include examining the effects of varying the thickness of the TiO2 layer within a narrower range to fine-tune its electron-selective properties and its impact on the overall cell efficiency. Additionally, exploring the doping of TiO2 with other elements to modify its electronic properties and enhance passivation could be valuable.

Development of Multi-Layer Passivation Structures: Explore the development of advanced multi-layer passivation structures incorporating TiO2. These structures could involve the strategic layering of materials with different electronic properties to enhance carrier separation and minimize recombination losses. The effectiveness of such structures in improving the passivation effect and overall efficiency of silicon solar cells warrants comprehensive investigation.

Investigation of Interface Defects and Their Mitigation: Delve into a deeper understanding of interface defects between the TiO2 layer and silicon substrate, focusing on their origins, mechanisms, and ways to mitigate their impact on solar cell performance. This research could include the development of novel surface treatments or interfacial layers designed to reduce defect density and improve carrier lifetime.

Comparative Study of Electron-Selective Contacts: Conduct a comparative study of various materials and structures for electron-selective contacts, including TiO2, to identify the most effective solutions for high-efficiency silicon solar cells. This study could explore the performance, cost, and scalability of different materials and deposition techniques, aiming to find an optimal balance between efficiency improvement and practical application.
