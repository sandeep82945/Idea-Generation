The recently introduced solution to this problem, Information Attribution, involves the Shapley-style value measuring the influence of predictors in the coalitional game associated with the joint probability distribution of the input random vector and the target variable. Motivated by the original problem, we consider a general setting of coalitional games where the players form a boolean algebra, and the coalitions are the corresponding down-sets. This enables us to study in detail various single-valued solution concepts, called values. Namely, we focus on the classes of values that can represent very general alternatives to the solution of the information decomposition problem, such as random-order values or sharing values. We extend the axiomatic characterization of some classes of values that were known only for the standard coalitional games.",

The Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and other information-theoretic quantities are highly instrumental in learning or fitting parameters to data. Several extensions of such information measures have been introduced to tackle the problems arising in alternative uncertainty calculi as well. The recent paper [6] discusses axiomatic aspects of generalized information measures. As for the applications to machine learning, a new feature selection method based on an alternative to the joint mutual information is designed, and its performance is evaluated in [18].

A case in point is the method SAGE (Shapley Additive Global importancE) [8] in which the features used in the classifier represent the players in a particular game scenario. The games induced by machine learning problems belong to the area of cooperative game theory [14, 16]. There are many variations in coalitional games used for such problems. Some researchers employ the \u201clocal\u201d approach where the influence of features is evaluated with respect to a fixed configuration of the target variable and the features [22]. Moreover, assessing the contribution of features by a value-like concept from game theory seems so natural that it has been discovered independently without a reference to any specific game; see [20].\nThe main principles underlying SAGE are to construct a coalitional game assessing the coalitions of features for the given classifier and, subsequently, to compute the Shapley value of individual features. This computation is in fact the approximation based on a sampling algorithm since the underlying game typically has a huge number of players. The Shapley value is thus instrumental in evaluating the predictive power of features. Moreover, the well-known axioms of Shapley value [19] provide a natural and domain-independent justification for such a distribution of the \u201ctotal\u201d predictive capacity among the individual features.\nThe recent paper [4] combines information- and game-theoretic tools to solve the following information decomposition problem:\nHow to decompose additively the mutual information between input random variables and the target variable into the sum of nonnegative terms quantifying the information contribution of each set of input variables?\nThe information decomposition problem asks for measuring the influence of sets of input variables and not only that of individual variables (features). The need to capture such complex and potentially high-dimensional interactions arises already from very simple probabilistic models where two-dimensional interactions can\u2019t describe the behavior of the system faithfully. The folklore example is the XOR model, in which two independent random bits X1 and X2 interact threeway with Y = X1 \u2295 X2, but neither X1 nor X2 alone interacts pairwise with Y . The solution to the information decomposition problem proposed in [4] is called Information Attribution. It is worth emphasizing that the passage from measuring contributions of individual variables to quantifying the contributions of sets of such variables is the key difference of Information Attribution from the methods such as above mentioned SAGE [8]. On the one hand, this characteristic makes Information Attribution much more expressive. On the other, it is computationally challenging to deal with already moderate-size models using this technique due to the exponentially increasing number of players.\nIn the rest of this section, first we will state our assumptions (Section 1.1) and then define the information decomposition problem formally (Section 1.2). Since the special game-theoretic framework of Information Attribution was the main motivation for the problems studied in this paper, we briefly sketch the basic\nprinciples of Information Attribution in Section 1.3; the full-blown description can be found in Appendix C. The interested reader is invited to consult the original paper [4] for more details. Our methodology is explained in Section 1.4.\n1.1. The assumptions\nAll random variables are discrete in this paper. We consider n input random variables X1, . . . , Xn each of which has a finite state space Xi and a target random variable1 Y with a finite state space Y. Let X = X1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Xn. The random vector (X, Y ) = (X1, . . . , Xn, Y ) on X \u00d7 Y is distributed according to the known joint probability distribution p = pXY , which is called the true distribution in this context. We will also deal with n-dimensional marginal distribution pX of X and one-dimensional marginal distribution pY of Y .\nThe interaction between X and Y can be captured by various informationtheoretic quantities; see [3, 7]. For example, we can average out the values x \u2208 X of input random vector X which provide some information about the values y \u2208 Y of target variable Y . This leads to the concept of mutual information betweeen X and Y . Specifically, the mutual information I(X;Y ) is the expected amount of information about Y provided by X, that is,\nI(X;Y ) = \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\np(x, y) \u00b7 log2 p(x, y)\npX(x) \u00b7 pY (y) . (1)\nThese are the basic properties of I(X;Y ).\n\u2022 I(X;Y ) \u2265 0.\n\u2022 I(X;Y ) = 0 if, and only if, X and Y are independent.\nNote that independence ofX and Y means precisely that p(x, y) = pX(x)\u00b7pY (y) for all (x, y) \u2208 X \u00d7 Y.\n1.2. Information decomposition problem\nOur presentation is based on [4, Section 1]. Define V = {1, . . . , n} and let A \u2286 V . A predictor2 is any set of input random variables {Xi | i \u2208 A}. We will often call the set A a predictor, too. Thus the set of all predictors, which is precisely the set of all subsets of V , is denoted by PV . The information decomposition problem informally introduced above can be stated precisely as follows.\nFor an arbitrary joint probability distribution pXY of n random inputs X = (X1, . . . , Xn) and target variable Y , find real numbers \u03c8A \u2265 0 such that\nI(X;Y ) = \u2211\nA\u2208PV\n\u03c8A. (2)\n1Equivalently, the random variable Y might be called the response variable or label. 2Note that this concept of predictor is different from the one used in machine learning and\nstatistics, where \u201cpredictor\u201d is the prediction function for observed data.\nAdditional properties of the decomposition are usually required to obtain a sensible solution; we refer the interested reader to [4, Section 1] for the thorough discussion of the motivation and history of the information decomposition problem. In particular, the nonnegative numbers \u03c8A are interpreted as \u201cthe proportion of the total mutual information attributed to predictor A, beyond what is already provided by its subsets\u201d. It is always assumed that the information attributed to the empty predictor \u2205 is zero, \u03c8\u2205 = 0.\n1.3. Information Attribution, briefly\nThe solution to the information decomposition problem based on cooperative game theory was presented in [4]. The proposed methodology is called Information Attribution and these are its main ideas.\n1. The class of all predictors PV uniquely generates a certain composite system D(PV ,\u2286). Specificaly, D(PV ,\u2286) is the lattice of down-sets of predictors with respect to the set-theoretic inclusion \u2286 in PV . In other words D(PV ,\u2286) contains exactly those sets of predictors which are closed with respect to the inclusion. From the game-theoretic viewpoint, the predictors (elements of PV ) are interpreted as players and the down-sets of predictors (elements of D(PV ,\u2286)) become coalitions. It is worth mentioning that the choice of down-sets as coalitions is very natural here since it is a consequence of the information-theoretic interpretation of the problem.\n2. A coalitional game vp : D(PV ,\u2286) \u2192 R is induced by the true distribution p of random vector (X, Y ) in a particular way. In this context, the worth vp(S) of each coalition S \u2208 D(PV ,\u2286) is defined to be the information distance of p from a certain baseline distribution depending on p and S. The number vp(S) can be intepreted as a measure of complexity of the true distribution p as in [3, Chapter 6.1].\n3. The coalitional game vp is used to find the value \u03c8A of each predictor A \u2208 PV . This is based on the concept of hierachical value of Faigle and Kern [11]. The hierachical values was developed as the extension of Shapley value [19] to the coalitional games with a partially ordered player set. The partial order captures the hierarchy among the players. The values \u03c8A are then declared to be the solution to the information decomposition problem (2).\n1.4. Outline and methodology\nIn this paper we study the general game-theoretic model originating from Information Attribution. The first step is to replace the powerset of predictors with any finite boolean algebra of players. This enables us to present the original framework in a lighter notation and to connect our formulation to the known results about coalitional games with restricted coalition formation. In Section 2 we discuss basic properties of coalitional games where players form the boolean algebra and the coalitions are restricted to the corresponding lattice of down-sets. This also involves the introduction of Harsanyi dividends (Mo\u0308bius transform), one of the key tools instrumental in the development of value theory\nfor such games. Our approach to the study of all coalitional games instead of just the \u201cinformation games\u201d induced by true distributions pXY might be seen as too general at the first sight. However, we claim that it is not only beneficial to formulate the original problem in the most general way, but it is also necessary. This is for the following reasons.\n\u2022 The solution of information decomposition problem (2) employs the hierachical value [11], which is based on the uniform distribution over admissible permutations of players. However, it was also pointed out in [4] that such a distribution might not be the only sensible choice.\n\u2022 The coalitional games vp arising from Information Attribution do not have any extra properties except monotonicity.\n\u2022 On top of that, the class of all such games does not form any subset amenable to the methods of cooperative game theory. Specifically, it can be shown the set of coalitional games vp obtained by varying all probability distributions p of the random vector (X, Y ) is compact but not convex. Therefore, it is not a linear space.\nOur main results are in Section 3. The key observation is that the hierachical value used in Information Attribution is not the only value concept that can be applied to the solution of information decomposition problem. By a value we mean an operator mapping a family of coalitional games to the set of possible vector allocations for individual players. Therefore, we focus our study on the class of efficient and positive values for coalitional games where players form a boolean algebra, since the two properties of values are the minimal conditions for the solution of information decomposition problem (2). It will become clear later in Section 3 that Efficiency means the existence of additive decomposition (2) and Positivity is the nonnegativity of \u03c8A in (2). This will lead naturally to the study of random-order values and positive sharing values. The former class is based on the average evaluation of player\u2019s contribution across the possible coalitions, whereas the latter involves averaging over Harsanyi dividends of the coalitions to which the player belongs. We provide the characterization of those classes and discuss some examples appearing in the literature.\nSection 4 summarizes our main findings and mentions several items for further research. Appendix contains the description of coalitional games over 2- and 4-player boolean algebras (Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively) and the detailed specification of Information Attribution (Appendix C)."

            "text": "The standard model of a coalitional game is based on the assumption that the player set is trivially ordered \u2014 there is no relation between any pair of different players. This assumption means that a feasible coalition can be any subset of the player set; see [14, 16] for the thorough exposition of the standard model of coalitional games. In this section, we introduce coalitional games where the\nplayer set is a boolean algebra3, and we will further discuss the concepts from coalitional games related to the Shapley value over partially ordered player sets; see [11, 1, 2]. As for the elements of lattice and order theory used here, we refer the reader to [21, 12] for all the unexplained notions.\n2.1. Players and coalitions\nLet P be a nonempty finite set. An element of P is called a player and it is usually denoted by small letters such as a, b, . . . , i, j, . . . Throughout the paper we always assume that P is partially ordered by such that the pair (P, ) is a boolean algebra. The order expresses precedence constrains of hierarchy among the players in P [11, 2]. The boolean algebra P has |P | = 2n elements, where n is the number of atoms of P . The join and meet in (P, ) are denoted by \u2228 and \u2227, respectively. By the rank of an element i \u2208 P we mean the number \u03c1(i) of uniquely determined distinct atoms a1, . . . , a\u03c1(i) such that i = a1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 a\u03c1(i). In particular, the top element \u22a4 (the highest player in the hierarchy) has rank n, and we also say that the boolean algebra (P, ) has rank n. The bottom element \u22a5 (the lowest player in the hierarchy) has rank 0. It is well-known that\n\u2022 the number of atoms n uniquely determines any finite boolean algebra up to an isomorphism and\n\u2022 each boolean algebra (P, ) of rank n is isomorphic to the powerset of an n-element set.\nThe usual concept of permutation of players needs to be generalized so that the resulting permutation is compatible with the order of players in P given by . This leads to the following concept. A mapping f : P \u2192 {1, . . . , 2n} is a linear extension4 of (P, ) if f is bijective and order-preserving. Specifically, the latter property says that i j implies f(i) \u2264 f(j), for all i, j \u2208 P , where \u2264 denotes the usual total order between natural numbers. We can think of f as the ranking of a player set which respects the structure of superiors. Let L(P ) be the set of all linear extensions of (P, ). Enumerating linear extensions of L(P ) is a hard problem \u2013 see [10] for non-trivial bounds on |L(P )|. For example, it is known that |L(P )| \u2265 1.5\u00d7106 for the boolean algebra P of rank n = 4. We will need the following criterion of equality of f1, f2 \u2208 L(P ). Namely f1 = f2 if, and only if, the condition\nIf f1(i) > f1(j), then f2(i) > f2(j), for all i, j \u2208 P (3)\nholds true. The non-trivial implication in the above equivalence is based on this observation. For any i \u2208 P and any f \u2208 L(P ), the number f(i) is uniquely\n3A word of caution is in order here. The boolean algebra plays the role of player set in our setting, whereas the algebraically identical concept of powerset represents the set of all coalitions in the standard model of coalitional games.\n4Equivalently, linear extensions are also called admissible permutations.\ndetermined by the cardinality of the set {j \u2208 P | f(i) > f(j)}. Since such sets corresponding to f1 and f2 coincide by the assumption (3), we get f1 = f2.\nLet S \u2286 P be a subset of players. An element i \u2208 S is a maximal element of S if there is no element j \u2208 S \\ i with i j. Let S\u2217 \u2286 S be the set of all maximal elements of S. Since P is finite, the set S\u2217 is nonempty whenever S is. A subset S \u2286 P is\n\u2022 a down-set if i \u2208 S, j \u2208 P , and j i implies j \u2208 S,\n\u2022 an antichain if i 6 j and j 6 j for all i, j \u2208 S.\nFor any S \u2286 P , define \u3008S\u3009 = {j \u2208 P | j i for some i \u2208 S}. Then \u3008S\u3009 is a down-set. If S is an antichain, then S = \u3008S\u3009\u2217. Conversely, the set S\u2217 of maximal elements of a down-set S is necessarily an antichain and S = \u3008S\u2217\u3009. This yields a one-to-one correspondence between antichains and down-sets in (P, ). We will frequently use this observation: If S \u2286 P is a down-set and i \u2208 S\u2217, then S \\ {i} is a down-set, too.\nIn order for a coalition S \u2286 P to be feasible with respect to the precedence constraints given by , we consider only those S containing all the subordinates of each superior player in S. This means exactly that a coalition S must be a down-set in (P, ). In the paper we will use the terms \u201cdown-set\u201d and \u201cfeasible\u201d interchangeably. The set of all down-sets D(P, ) is a finite distributive lattice in which the join and meet coincide with the set-theoretic operations \u222a and \u2229, respectively. The partial order of D(P, ) is the inclusion \u2286 between down-sets. Interestingly enough, D(P, ) is very special among the distributive lattices, since it is precisely the free distributive lattice generated by the n atoms of (P, ). The role of this lattice for information theory is further discussed in [4].\nConvention 1. We will frequently omit the curly braces. For example, suppose b, e \u2208 P . Expressions such as \u3008b, e\u3009 and P \\ e are understood as \u3008{b, e}\u3009 and P \\ {e}, respectively.\nSee Figures A.2 and B.3 for the examples of boolean algebra P with ranks n = 2, 3 with the corresponding D(P, ). The rapidly growing cardinalities of D(P, ) are shown in Table 1. The resulting numbers are the Dedekind numbers. By the definition, each Dedekind number is the number of antichains in the powerset of an n-element set.\n2.2. Coalitional games\nA coalitional game assigns to each feasible coalition the amount of utility as the result of cooperation among the members of the coalition. We will write\nsimply D in place of D(P, ). A (coalitional) game on D is a function v : D \u2192 R such that v(\u2205) = 0. The function v associates with each feasible coalition S \u2208 D its worth v(S) \u2208 R. We adopt the standard concepts of coalitional game theory in the setting of games with restricted cooperation; see [12] for a survey and [13] for the setting of partially ordered player set in particular. A game v is called\n\u2022 monotone if S \u2286 T implies v(S) \u2264 v(T ),\n\u2022 nonnegative when v(S) \u2265 0,\n\u2022 supermodular if v(S) + v(T ) \u2264 v(S \u222a T ) + v(S \u2229 T ),\n\u2022 submodular if v(S) + v(T ) \u2265 v(S \u222a T ) + v(S \u2229 T ),\nfor all S, T \u2208 D. A player i \u2208 P is null5 in game v if v(S) = v(S \u222a i), for all S \u2208 D such that S \u222a i \u2208 D. A carrier for a game v is a coalition U \u2208 D satisfying v(S) = v(S \u2229 U) for all S \u2208 D.\nIt is clear that the set G(D) of all games on D is a real linear space. We will use the shorter notation G = G(D) whenever D is understood. The linear space G is spanned by the basis of unanimity games uT , where \u2205 6= T \u2208 D and\nuT (S) =\n{ 1 T \u2286 S,\n0 otherwise, S \u2208 D.\nObserve that each player i \u2208 P \\ T is null in game uT . The Harsanyi dividends of a game v \u2208 G are recursively defined numbers\nv\u0302(S) =    0 S = \u2205,\nv(S)\u2212 \u2211 T\u2208D T\u2282S v\u0302(T ) S \u2208 D \\ {\u2205}.\nEquivalently,\nv\u0302(S) = \u2211\nT\u2208\u2126(S)\n(\u22121)|S|\u2212|T |v(T ), S \u2208 D,\nwhere \u2126(S) is the family of all T \u2208 D such that T \u2286 S and the order interval {R \u2208 D | T \u2286 R \u2286 S} is a boolean sublattice of D. The function v\u0302 is a game on D and it is also called the Mo\u0308bius transform of v; see [12, 21]. The Harsanyi dividends of v are the coordinates of v with respect to the basis of G formed by the unanimity games:\nv = \u2211\n\u22056=T\u2208D\nv\u0302(T ) \u00b7 uT . (4)\n5Note that a null player in this sense is called a \u201cdummy player\u201d in [11, Example 3]. However, dummy players are usually defined by a weaker condition in the game-theoretic literature.\nExpanding the formula (4) coordinatewise,\nv(S) = \u2211\nT\u2208D T\u2286S\nv\u0302(T ), S \u2208 D. (5)\nIn particular, the Harsanyi dividends of a unanimity game uT are\nu\u0302T (S) =\n{ 1 S = T,\n0 otherwise, S \u2208 D. (6)\nWe list the Harsanyi dividends for the 4-player and 8-player game in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively.\nEvery null player maximal in a coalition S nullifies the dividend of S.\nProposition 1. Let i \u2208 P be a null player in a game v and S \u2208 D. If i \u2208 S\u2217, that is, i is a maximal element in S, then v\u0302(S) = 0.\nProof. We will proceed by induction on the cardinality of S. First, assume that |S| = |\u3008i\u3009|. In this case S = \u3008i\u3009, and v\u0302(S) = v(S)\u2212v(S\\i) = 0 by the hypothesis. Assume that this is true for down-sets S of cardinality up to k and consider a down-set S of cardinality k + 1 such that i \u2208 S\u2217. Note that the cardinality of such a down-set is bounded by |P \\ (\u222aa\u2208P (i \u2228 a))|, since the latter is the largest down-set (with respect to \u2286) in which i is maximal. So we shall assume k \u2264 |P \\ (\u222aa\u2208P (i \u2228 a))| \u2212 1. Then\nv\u0302(S) = v(S)\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S\nv\u0302(T ) = v(S)\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\nv\u0302(T )\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S i/\u2208T\nv\u0302(T )\n= v(S)\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\u2217\nv\u0302(T )\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S i/\u2208T\nv\u0302(T ).\nThe last equality follows from the equivalence i \u2208 T \u21d4 i \u2208 T \u2217 for any T \u2282 S. By the induction hypothesis,\n\u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\u2217\nv\u0302(T ) = 0.\nSince \u2211\nT\u2282S i/\u2208T\nv\u0302(T ) = \u2211\nT\u2286S\\i\nv\u0302(T ) = v(S \\ i),\nthe conclusion v\u0302(S) = 0 follows.\nRemark 1. We will comment on the iterative reasoning in the proof of Proposition 1. For any i \u2208 S\u2217 not necessarily null in v, we can expand v\u0302(S) as\n(v(S)\u2212 v(S \\ i))\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\u2217\n(v(T )\u2212 v(T \\ i)) + \u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\u2217\n\u2211\nU\u2282T i\u2208U\u2217\n(v(U)\u2212 v(U \\ i))\u2212 . . .\nTherefore, we can decompose v\u0302(S) as the sum of marginal contributions\n\u2211\nT\u2286S i\u2208T\u2217\n\u03b2i(T ) \u00b7 (v(T )\u2212 v(T \\ i)),\nwhere each \u03b2i(T ) \u2208 R depends only on the down-set T and the element i. Note that \u03b2i(S) = 1, for every i \u2208 S\u2217, and \u03b2i(T ) = \u22121, for each T with |S|\u2212 |T | = 1."

            "text": "First, we recall the notation introduced in the previous section. By P we denote the boolean algebra of players, D is the corresponding lattice of downsets (feasible coalitions), and G is the real linear space of all coalitional games v : D \u2192 R. A value on G is a mapping\n\u03d5 : G \u2192 RP .\nFor every game v \u2208 G, the coordinates of vector\n\u03d5(v) = (\u03d5i(v))i\u2208P \u2208 R P\nare allocations of coalitional worth to the players i \u2208 P . Any value is a possible solution concept for coalitional games. We single out usual axioms of values, which reflect both basic principles of economic rationality and mathematically convenient properties. Efficiency \u2211 i\u2208P \u03d5i(v) = v(P ), for every v \u2208 G.\nPositivity \u03d5i(v) \u2265 0, for every monotone game v \u2208 G and each i \u2208 P .

By contrast, in our setting it is only true that Efficiency and Null player axiom imply Carrier axiom, but not conversely. Positivity is also called Monotonicity in the game-theoretic literature; cf. [24, 9].\n3.1. Random-order values\nFirst, we consider the class of values obtained by averaging out the marginal vectors with respect to a probability distribution over linear extensions. This is analogous to the class of random-order values studied in the standard model of coalitional games [24].\nFor each player i \u2208 P and every linear extension f \u2208 L(P ), we consider the set of all players preceding player i in the ranking f ,\nSf (i) = {j \u2208 P | f(j) \u2264 f(i)}.\nClearly, the player i is a maximal element in Sf (i). Observe that Sf(i) is downset and so is the set Sf (i) \\ i = {j \u2208 P | f(j) < f(i)}.\nExample 1. Let P be the boolean algebra of rank 3 and the linear extension f \u2208 L(P ) be given in Figure 1. Then Sf (e) = {\u22a5, a, b, c, d, e}.\nThe marginal contribution of player i \u2208 P in game v \u2208 G with respect to a linear extension f \u2208 L(P ) is\n\u2206fi (v) = v(Sf (i))\u2212 v(Sf (i) \\ i). (7)\nThe vector \u2206f (v) = (\u2206fi (v))i\u2208P \u2208 R P\nis called the marginal vector. The marginal contribution of player i is the sum of Harsanyi dividends of coalitions S \u2208 D in which i is maximal and whose players precede i in the ranking f :\n\u2206fi (v) = \u2211\nS\u2286Sf (i) i\u2208S\u2217\nv\u0302(S). (8)\nThe identity (8) follows from (5) and from the equivalence i \u2208 S \u21d4 i \u2208 S\u2217 valid for every down-set S \u2286 Sf (i).\nDefinition 1. Let r be a probability distribution over linear extensions L(P ). The random-order value is the value \u03d5r such that\n\u03d5ri (v) = \u2211\nf\u2208L(P )\nr(f) \u00b7\u2206fi (v), i \u2208 P, v \u2208 G. (9)\nEvery random-order value satisfies Linearity, Efficiency, Null player axiom, and Positivity. If r is the uniform distribution, r(f) = 1|L(P )| for all f \u2208 L(P ), then \u03d5r coincides with the hierachical value of Faigle and Kern [11, Theorem 2]; see Section 3.4 for further details.\n3.2. Selectors\nWe will show how random-order values relate to the family of so-called sharing values. To this end, we need the concept of selector, which was used in [9] to study the selectope solution of standard coalitional games. In our setting, a selector picks a maximal element from any down-set. Specifically, a selector is a mapping\n\u03b1 : D \\ {\u2205} \u2192 P\nsuch that \u03b1(S) \u2208 S\u2217 for any nonempty S \u2208 D. Let S(D) be the set of all selectors. For any \u03b1 \u2208 S(D), the selector value \u03b4\u03b1 is a value which gives player i the sum of Harsanyi dividends of the coalitions in which i is maximal according to \u03b1:\n\u03b4\u03b1i (v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i=\u03b1(S)\nv\u0302(S), i \u2208 P, v \u2208 G. (10)\nWe say that a selector \u03b1 \u2208 S(D) is consistent if \u03b1(S) = \u03b1(T ), for all nonempty S, T \u2208 D such that S \u2286 T and \u03b1(T ) \u2208 S\u2217. Let C(D) be the set of all consistent selectors. Any selector \u03b1 \u2208 S(D) \\ C(D) is called inconsistent. We will demonstrate that consistent selectors and linear extensions are in bijection.\nLemma 1. For every linear extension f \u2208 L(P ), define\n\u03b1f (S) = argmax i\u2208S\u2217 f(i), \u2205 6= S \u2208 D.\nThen \u03b1f \u2208 C(D) and \u03b4\u03b1f (v) = \u2206f (v). The map sending f \u2208 L(P ) to \u03b1f \u2208 C(D) is injective.\nProof. By the definition of \u03b1f , we obtain \u03b1f (S) \u2208 S\u2217 for any nonempty S \u2208 D. If S \u2286 T and \u03b1f (T ) \u2208 S \u2217, then \u03b1f (T ) is the maximizer of f over S \u2217. Therefore, \u03b1f (S) = \u03b1f (T ), and \u03b1f \u2208 C(D).\nWe prove the identity \u03b4 \u03b1f i (v) = \u2206 f i (v) for each i \u2208 P . This is true by (8)\nand by the equivalence of these three conditions for any S \u2208 D:\ni = \u03b1f (S) \u21d4 f(j) \u2264 f(i), i \u2208 S \u2217, \u2200j \u2208 S \u21d4 S \u2286 Sf (i), i \u2208 S \u2217.\nSuppose f1, f2 \u2208 L(P ) and f1 6= f2. Then, by (3), there exist necessarily imcomparable elements i, j \u2208 P such that f1(i) > f1(j) and f2(i) < f2(j). Define S to be the down-set whose set of maximal elements is precisely {i, j}. Then \u03b1f1(S) = i 6= j = \u03b1f2(S).\nLet \u03b1 be a consistent selector. We define a function g\u03b1 : {1, . . . , |P |} \u2192 P recursively. Let g\u03b1(|P |) = \u03b1(P ) = \u22a4 and\ng\u03b1(\u2113) = \u03b1(P \\ {g\u03b1(|P |), . . . , g\u03b1(\u2113+ 1)}), \u2113 = 1, . . . , |P | \u2212 1.\nBy the construction, g\u03b1 is bijective. The bijection g\u03b1 selects and removes the elements from P (starting from the top element \u22a4) in such a way that the removed element is maximal in the set from which it is removed, and thus it generates a descending chain of down-sets. Define\nf\u03b1 = g \u22121 \u03b1 . (11)\nLemma 2. Let \u03b1 \u2208 C(D). Then f\u03b1 \u2208 L(P ).\nProof. Clearly, f\u03b1 given by (11) is bijective. We need to prove that f\u03b1 is orderpreserving. Suppose that i j. There are \u2113, \u2113\u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , |P |} such that i = g\u03b1(\u2113) and j = g\u03b1(\u2113 \u2032). Put\nS\u2113 = P \\ {g\u03b1(|P |), . . . , g\u03b1(\u2113+ 1)} and S\u2113\u2032 = P \\ {g\u03b1(|P |), . . . , g\u03b1(\u2113 \u2032 + 1)}.\nThen g\u03b1(\u2113) = \u03b1(S\u2113) \u03b1(S\u2113\u2032) = g\u03b1(\u2113\u2032). Assume that \u2113 > \u2113\u2032. Then S\u2113\u2032 \u2282 S\u2113. However, \u03b1(S\u2113) \u03b1(S\u2113\u2032), which contradicts the maximality of \u03b1(S\u2113) in S\u2113. Therefore, we obtain \u2113 \u2264 \u2113\u2032, so f\u03b1 \u2208 L(P ).\nThe next lemma shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear extensions and consistent selectors.\nLemma 3. The maps A : L(P ) \u2192 C(D) and F : C(D) \u2192 L(P ) given by\nA(f) = \u03b1f and F (\u03b1) = f\u03b1,\nrespectively, are mutually inverse.\nProof. The map A is injective by Lemma 1, so we only need to prove that A\u25e6F is the identity on C(D). Let \u03b1 \u2208 C(D). We shall prove that \u03b1f\u03b1 = A(F (\u03b1)) = \u03b1. Let \u2205 6= S \u2208 D and assume that \u03b1f\u03b1(S) = s. This assumption is equivalent to any of the three conditions:\nargmax i\u2208S\u2217\nf\u03b1(i) = s \u21d4 f\u03b1(s) \u2265 f\u03b1(i), \u2200i \u2208 S \u21d4 g \u22121 \u03b1 (i) \u2264 g \u22121 \u03b1 (s), \u2200i \u2208 S.\nLet lS be the maximal integer from {1, . . . , |P |} such that g\u03b1(lS) \u2208 S and let K = P \\{g\u03b1(|P |), g\u03b1(|P |\u22121), . . . , g\u03b1(lS+1)}. This implies thatK is the maximal down-set determined by g\u03b1 such that \u03b1(K) \u2208 S. Assume that \u03b1(K) = s\u2032 6= s. By maximality of lS , we obtain g \u22121 \u03b1 (s\n\u2032) = lS \u2265 g\u22121\u03b1 (i) for all i \u2208 S. In particular, we have g\u22121\u03b1 (s\n\u2032) > g\u22121\u03b1 (s), which contradicts the hypothesis. Since S \u2286 K and \u03b1 is consistent, we deduce that \u03b1(S) = s. Assume now that \u03b1(S) = s and let lS and K be as above. By the consistency of \u03b1, we have that \u03b1(K) = s and g\u22121\u03b1 (s) = lS. Since lS is maximal such that g\u03b1(lS) \u2208 S, we have g \u22121 \u03b1 (i) \u2264 g \u22121 \u03b1 (s) for all i \u2208 S.\nAny consistent selector value (10) is equal to the marginal vector associated with the ranking (11).\nLemma 4. For every consistent selector \u03b1 \u2208 C(D) and all v \u2208 G,\n\u03b4\u03b1(v) = \u2206f\u03b1(v). (12)\nProof. Let \u03b1 \u2208 C(D). For the sake of compact notation in the proof, put f = f\u03b1 and g = g\u03b1. Let v \u2208 G, i \u2208 P and assume that i = g(\u2113). Then (8) implies\n\u2206fg(\u2113)(v) = \u2211\nS\u2286Sf (g(\u2113)) g(\u2113)\u2208S\u2217\nv\u0302(S). (13)\nBy the definition of selector value,\n\u03b4\u03b1g(\u2113)(v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D \u03b1(S)=g(\u2113)\nv\u0302(S). (14)\nIf we show that\n{S \u2208 D | S \u2286 Sf (g(\u2113)), g(\u2113) \u2208 S \u2217} = {S \u2208 D | \u03b1(S) = g(\u2113)}, (15)\nthen (13) and (14) are equal. First, observe that\nSf (g(\u2113)) = {j \u2208 P | g \u22121(j) \u2264 \u2113} = {g(1), . . . , g(\u2113)}.\nLet S \u2286 Sf (g(\u2113)) and g(\u2113) \u2208 S\u2217. Then \u03b1(Sf (g(\u2113))) = g(\u2113) by the definition of g. As \u03b1 is consistent, \u03b1(S) = g(\u2113). Conversely, let S \u2208 D be such that \u03b1(S) = g(\u2113). Then necessarily g(\u2113) \u2208 S\u2217. We want to prove S \u2286 Sf (g(\u2113)). There exists some j \u2208 S\u2217 such that f(k) \u2264 f(j) for all k \u2208 S. Then\nS \u2286 Sf (j). (16)\nSince we can write j = g(\u2113\u2032) for some \u2113\u2032, we get \u03b1(Sf (j)) = j by the definition of g. By consistency of \u03b1, it follows that j = \u03b1(S) = g(\u2113). Therefore S \u2286 Sf (g(\u2113)) by (16). In conclusion, (15) is true, which finishes the proof of (12).\nLemma 4 ensures this property: If \u03b1 is a consistent selector and v is a monotone game, then the vector \u03b4\u03b1(v) has nonnegative coordinates. This is not true in case \u03b1 is inconsistent.\nExample 2. Let P be the boolean algebra of rank 3 \u2013 see Figure B.3. Let T = \u3008a, b, c\u3009 and S = \u3008a, b\u3009 and consider any inconsistent selector \u03b1 such that \u03b1(T ) = a, \u03b1(S) = b, and \u03b1(\u3008a, c\u3009) = c. Then \u03b4\u03b1a (v) = v\u0302(\u3008a, b, c\u3009)+ v\u0302(\u3008a\u3009), which is not necessarily positive even if v is monotone.\n3.3. Sharing values\nWe introduce sharing systems analogously to [12, Section 3.5] or [9].\nDefinition 2. A sharing system is a mapping q : D \u00d7 P \u2192 [0, 1] such that for each nonempty coalition S \u2208 D,\n\u2022 q(S, .) : P \u2192 [0, 1] is a probability distribution,\n\u2022 q(S, i) = 0 for each i \u2208 P \\ S\u2217, and\n\u2022 q(\u2205, i) = 0 for all i \u2208 P .\nThe sharing value (or Harsanyi solution) associated with a sharing system q is a value \u03c0q defined by\n\u03c0qi (v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\nq(S, i) \u00b7 v\u0302(S), i \u2208 P, v \u2208 G. (17)\nWhen the coalitional worth is distributed according to a sharing value, every dividend v\u0302(S) is split only among the maximal players in S. We argue that this restriction to the distribution among the maximal players is sensible in our setting:\n\u2022 The maximal players i \u2208 S\u2217 can be thought of as the superiors of players in S \\S\u2217, so it makes sense to limit the allocation process of the Harsanyi dividend v\u0302(S) to them.\n\u2022 The set S\u2217 is an antichain, so we can allocate the Harsanyi dividend v\u0302(S) freely as long as we respect the sharing system q.\n\u2022 Since the player set is a boolean algebra, every player acts the same number of times as a maximal player.\n\u2022 It is computationally simpler to evaluate the sum (17) for a smaller number of players with the size of down-sets S increasing.\nLemma 5. Every sharing value \u03c0q fullfills Linearity, Efficiency, and Null player axiom.\nProof. Linearity of \u03c0q follows immediately from the linearity of Harsanyi dividends: v\u03021 + v2 = v\u03021 + v\u03022 and \u03b1\u0302v1 = \u03b1v\u03021, for all v1, v2 \u2208 G, \u03b1 \u2208 R. As for Efficiency, let v \u2208 G. Then\n\u2211\ni\u2208P\n\u03c0qi (v) = \u2211\ni\u2208P\n\u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\nq(S, i) \u00b7 v\u0302(S) = \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u2211\ni\u2208S\u2217\nq(S, i) \u00b7 v\u0302(S)\n= \u2211\nS\u2208D\nv\u0302(S) \u2211\ni\u2208S\u2217\nq(S, i)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 1\n= \u2211\nS\u2208D\nv\u0302(S) = v(P ),\nwhere the last equality is a consequence of (5). Hence Efficiency of \u03c0q. Finally, let i \u2208 P be a null player in v. Then every Harsanyi dividend v\u0302(S) = 0 whenever i \u2208 S\u2217 by Proposition 1, which implies that \u03c0qi = 0.\nA sharing value may not be positive as the following examples demonstrate.\nExample 3 (Priority value). We adopt the concept of priority value constructed for the different class of games [5, Formula (4)] (see also the discussion in Section 3.5) and adapt the definition to our setting. This leads to the sharing system q such that\nq(S, i) =\n{ 1\n|S\u2217| i \u2208 S \u2217, 0 otherwise,\nwhere the associated sharing value \u03c0q given by (17) is\n\u03c0qi (v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\nv\u0302(S) |S\u2217| , v \u2208 G, i \u2208 P. (18)\nThe idea is that each Harsanyi dividend is distributed among the maximal players uniformly. However, the sharing value (18) fails Positivity axiom. An example of a monotone game v for which some \u03c0qi (v) is negative can be found using Table B.3 of Harsanyi dividends.\nExample 4 (Proportional value). As a more sophisticated variant to the uniform split used in the priority value (Example 3), we can distribute the dividend proportionally to each player\u2019s rank \u03c1(i) in the boolean algebra (P, ). We define\n\u03c1(S\u2217) = \u2211\ni\u2208S\u2217\n\u03c1(i), S \u2208 D,\nand q(S, i) = \u03c1(i)\u03c1(S\u2217) , for any i \u2208 S \u2217, and q(S, i) = 0, otherwise. Then q is a sharing system and the proportional value is the associated sharing value \u03c0q, that is,\n\u03c0qi (v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\n\u03c1(i)\n\u03c1(S\u2217) \u00b7 v\u0302(S), i \u2208 P, v \u2208 G.\nIt follows from (6) and from the definition of proportional value that\n\u03c0i(uT ) =\n{ \u03c1(i)\n\u03c1(T\u2217) i \u2208 T \u2217, 0 otherwise. (19)\nIt can be shown that the proportional values satisfies Symmetry. First, we note that for any nonempty T \u2208 D and any boolean automorphism \u03c3,\n\u03c3uT = u\u03c3(T ). (20)\nIndeed, this follows from the equivalence of the inclusions T \u2286 \u03c3\u22121(S) and \u03c3(T ) \u2286 S, for any S \u2208 D. We will show that\n\u03c0q\u03c3(i)(\u03c3uT ) = \u03c0 q i (uT ), i \u2208 P. (21)\nUsing (20) and (19), we obtain\n\u03c0q\u03c3(i)(\u03c3uT ) = \u03c0 q \u03c3(i)(u\u03c3(T )) = \u03c1(\u03c3(i))\u2211 j\u2208\u03c3(T )\u2217 \u03c1(j)\nwhen \u03c3(i) \u2208 \u03c3(T )\u2217. The key observation is that any boolean automorphism \u03c3 : P \u2192 P preserves the ranks of players in P , that is, \u03c1(\u03c3(i)) = \u03c1(i) for all i \u2208 P . Moreover, any such \u03c3 is necessarily an order-preserving map. Thus, the condition \u03c3(i) \u2208 \u03c3(T )\u2217 is equivalent to i \u2208 T \u2217, and\n\u03c1(\u03c3(i))\u2211 j\u2208\u03c3(T )\u2217 \u03c1(j) = \u03c1(i)\u2211 j\u2208\u03c3(T\u2217) \u03c1(j) = \u03c1(i)\u2211 k\u2208T\u2217 \u03c1(\u03c3(k)) = \u03c1(i)\u2211 k\u2208T\u2217 \u03c1(k) .\nThis implies that (21) holds, so \u03c0q is symmetric over all unanimity games uT . Now, let v \u2208 G be an arbitrary game, and consider any player i \u2208 P and any boolean automorphism \u03c3. Then, by (4), linearity of \u03c0q and the identity \u03c3\u0302v = \u03c3v\u0302, we get:\n\u03c0q\u03c3(i)(\u03c3v) = \u2211\n\u22056=T\u2208D\n\u03c3\u0302v(T )\u03c0q\u03c3(i)(uT ) = \u2211\n\u22056=T\u2208D\nv\u0302(\u03c3\u22121(T ))\u03c0q\u03c3(i)(uT ).\nEmploying (21), the last term on the right-hand side is equal to\n\u2211\n\u22056=T\u2208D\nv\u0302(T )\u03c0q\u03c3(i)(u\u03c3(T )) = \u2211\n\u22056=T\u2208D\nv\u0302(T )\u03c0qi (uT ) = \u03c0 q i (v).\nHowever, also the proportional value fails Positivity. Th smallest counterexample can be exhibited on the boolean algebra of rank 4, which involves 24 players and 168 coalitions (see Table 1).\nIt turns out that the three axioms from Lemma 5 and Positivity characterize the class of positive sharing values. This result extends [9, Theorem 4(a)].\nProposition 2. Let \u03d5 : G \u2192 RP a positive value. The following are equivalent.\n1. \u03d5 is a sharing value.\n2. \u03d5 satisfies Linearity, Null player axiom, and Efficiency.\nProof. The implication 1. \u21d2 2. is Lemma 5. Conversely, let \u03d5 be a positive value satisfying the three axioms. Any game v can be represented as a linear combination of unanimity games (4). Then linearity of \u03d5 gives\n\u03d5i(v) = \u2211\n\u22056=S\u2208D\nv\u0302(S)\u03d5i(uS), i \u2208 P.\nWe will prove that q : D \u00d7 P \u2192 [0, 1] such that q(S, i) = \u03d5i(uS) is a sharing system. Since \u03d5 satisfies Positivity, clearly \u03d5i(uS) \u2265 0. By Efficiency,\n\u2211\ni\u2208P\nq(S, i) = \u2211\ni\u2208P\n\u03d5i(uS) = uS(P ) = 1.\nIt is easy to see that any player i \u2208 P \\ S\u2217 is a null player in uS, so by Null player axiom \u03d5i(uS) = 0 for every i \u2208 P \\ S\u2217. Consequently, q is a sharing system and \u03d5 coincides with the sharing value \u03c0q.\nOur next goal is to give an alternative description of positive sharing values and to characterize the random-order values within positive sharing values. To this end, we will show that the class of sharing values coincides with the class of average selector values. This connection becomes instrumental in studying positivity of the sharing values (23). The following result is essentially [9, Lemma 4], which was proved in the context of standard coalitional games.\nLemma 6. The following assertions hold true.\n1. For any sharing system q, this function is a probability distribution:\npq(\u03b1) = \u220f\n\u22056=S\u2208D\nq(S, \u03b1(S)), \u03b1 \u2208 S(D).\nThe sharing value corresponding to q is\n\u03c0q(v) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D)\npq(\u03b1) \u00b7 \u03b4 \u03b1(v), v \u2208 G. (22)\n2. Conversely, let p be a probability distribution over S(D). Define\nqp(S, i) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(S)=i\np(\u03b1), \u2205 6= S \u2208 D, i \u2208 S\u2217,\nand qp(S, i) = 0, otherwise. Then qp is a sharing system and\n\u03c0qp(v) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D)\np(\u03b1) \u00b7 \u03b4\u03b1(v), v \u2208 G. (23)\nProof. 1. That pq is a probability distribution follows from an easy adaptation of the second part of the proof. Since both values \u03c0q(v) and \u03b4\u03b1(v) are linear maps in games v \u2208 G, it suffices to verify (22) for any unanimity game uT . We have\n\u03c0qi (uT ) =\n{ q(T, i) i \u2208 T \u2217,\n0 i /\u2208 T \u2217, and \u03b4\u03b1i (uT ) =\n{ 1 i = \u03b1(T ),\n0 i 6= \u03b1(T ).\nIf i /\u2208 T \u2217, then i 6= \u03b1(T ) and both sides of (22) are zero. Let i \u2208 T \u2217. Then (22) reads as\nq(T, i) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(T )=i\n\u220f\n\u22056=S\u2208D\nq(S, \u03b1(S)). (24)\nLet T1 6= T, \u2205. Then the sum on the right-hand side above is equal to\nq(T, i) \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(T )=i\n\u220f\nS\u2208D S 6=\u2205,T\nq(S, \u03b1(S)) = q(T, i) \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(T )=i\nq(T1, \u03b1(T1)) \u220f\nS\u2208D S 6=\u2205,T,T1\nq(S, \u03b1(S)).\nThe last expression can be written as\nq(T, i) \u2211\nj\u2208T\u2217 1\nq(T1, j)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 1\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(T )=i \u03b1(T1)=j\n\u220f\nS\u2208D S 6=\u2205,T,T1\nq(S, \u03b1(S)). (25)\nBy repeating the last step for the remaining down-sets in D \\ {\u2205, T, T1}, the term (25) is reduced to q(T, i). This proves identity (24).\n2. The mapping qp is a sharing system since, for every nonempty S \u2208 D, \u2211\ni\u2208S\u2217\nqp(S, i) = \u2211\ni\u2208S\u2217\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(S)=i\np(\u03b1) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D)\np(\u03b1) = 1.\nThe second equality above is true as the sets {\u03b1 \u2208 S(D) | \u03b1(S) = i} form a partition of S(D). In order to show that (23) holds true, let v = uT for nonempty T \u2208 D. Suppose i \u2208 T \u2217. Then\n\u03c0qi (uT ) = qp(T, i) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D) \u03b1(T )=i\np(\u03b1) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D)\np(\u03b1)\u03b4\u03b1i (uT ).\nLet i /\u2208 T \u2217. Then both sides of (23) are zero, as \u03c0qi (uT ) = 0 and \u03b4 \u03b1 i (uT ) = 0 for any selector \u03b1.\nWe will use Lemma 6 to characterize random-order values in terms of certain sharing values. Namely, the family of random-order values coincides with the family of sharing values \u03c0qp (see (23)) whose sharing systems qp correspond to probability distributions p supported by a subset of consistent selectors.\nProposition 3. Random-order values are exactly the sharing values (23) such that p(\u03b1) = 0 for every \u03b1 \u2208 S(D) \\ C(D).\nProof. Let \u03d5r be a random-order value (9). Since r is a probability distribution over linear extensions, by the one-to-one correspondence between linear extensions in L(P) and consistent selectors C(D) (see Lemma 3), we can define the probability distribution r\u0304 over all selectors by\nr\u0304(\u03b1) =\n{ r(f\u03b1) \u03b1 \u2208 C(D),\n0 \u03b1 \u2208 S(D) \\ C(D),\nwhere f\u03b1 is the linear extension (11) corresponding to \u03b1. Using this correspondence and (12), we obtain for every i \u2208 P and every v \u2208 G,\n\u03d5ri (v) = \u2211\nf\u2208L(P )\nr(f)\u2206fi (v) = \u2211\nf\u2208L(P )\nr(f)\u03b4 \u03b1f i (v) =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D)\nr\u0304(\u03b1)\u03b4\u03b1i (v).\nBy the second part of Lemma 6, if qr\u0304 is the sharing system associated with r\u0304, then the last sum is equal to the sharing value \u03c0qr\u0304i (v).\nConversely, let \u03c0qp be the sharing value (23) such that p(\u03b1) = 0 for every \u03b1 \u2208 S(D)\\S(D). Then it is easy to see using the above equalities and Lemma 6 that \u03c0qp is a random-order value.\nIn particular, Proposition 3 and the positivity of random-order values imply that every sharing value satisfying the property from Proposition 3 is positive. The natural question of interest is whether the converse holds. Namely, if a probability distribution p over S(D) gives positive probability p(\u03b1) > 0 to some inconsistent selector \u03b1 \u2208 S(D) \\ C(D), is the resulting sharing value automatically non-positive? We shall prove that this is not the case by providing a counterexample \u2014 see Example 5. To this end, we introduce the concept of \u201clocal\u201d inconsistency.\nDefinition 3. We say that a selector \u03b1 is inconsistent on t \u2208 P if there exist down-sets S, T \u2208 D such that S \u2282 T , \u03b1(T ) = t \u2208 S\u2217, and \u03b1(S) 6= \u03b1(T ). Otherwise, we shall say that a selector \u03b1 is consistent on t.\nNote that a consistent selector \u03b1 \u2208 C(D) is consistent on every element t \u2208 P and that an inconsistent selector \u03b1 \u2208 S(D) \\ C(D) may be consistent on some elements.\nLemma 7. Let \u03b1 be a selector consistent on t \u2208 P . Assume that there exists T \u2208 D such that for every S \u2208 D we have \u03b1(S) = \u03b1(T ) = t and S \u2286 T . Then the corresponding selector value of game v \u2208 G is \u03b4\u03b1t (v) = v(T )\u2212 v(T \\ t).\nProof. By the consistency of \u03b1 on t, we obtain:\n\u03b4\u03b1t (v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D t=\u03b1(S)\nv\u0302(S) = v\u0302(T ) + \u2211\nS\u2208D t\u2208S\u2282T\nv\u0302(S) = v(T )\u2212 \u2211\nS\u2208D S\u2282T\nv\u0302(S) + \u2211\nS\u2208D t\u2208S\u2282T\nv\u0302(S)\n= v(T )\u2212 \u2211\nS\u2208D t/\u2208S\u2282T\nv\u0302(S) = v(T )\u2212 \u2211\nS\u2208D S\u2286T\\t\nv\u0302(S) = v(T )\u2212 v(T \\ t).\nObserve that any consistent selector \u03b1 necessarily satisfies the assumption of lemma above since T = \u22c3 {D \u2208 D | \u03b1(D) = t}. Also, Lemma 7 implies that \u03b4\u03b1t (v) \u2265 0 for any selector \u03b1 satisfying the assumption and for any monotone game v \u2208 G.\nThe next example presents a positive sharing value with p positive on some inconsistent selectors.\nExample 5. We consider the boolean algebra P of rank 3 as in Figure B.3. Consider arbitrary selectors \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 S(D) such that:\n1. \u03b1 is consistent and satisfies \u03b1(\u3008a, b, c\u3009) = c, \u03b1(\u3008a, b\u3009) = a, \u03b1(\u3008b, e\u3009) = e, \u03b1(\u3008e, f\u3009) = f , \u03b1(\u3008d, e, f\u3009) = d.\n2. \u03b2 satisfies \u03b2(\u3008a, b, c\u3009) = \u03b2(\u3008a, c\u3009) = a, \u03b2(\u3008a, b\u3009) = b, \u03b2(\u3008b, c\u3009) = c, and \u03b2 coincides with \u03b1 on all the other down-sets. Note that \u03b2 is inconsistent.\nLet p be an arbitrary probability distribution over selectors such that p(\u03b2) > 0, p(\u03b1) = 1 \u2212 p(\u03b2), and the probability of any other selector is zero. Note that \u03b4\u03b1i (v), \u03b4 \u03b2 i (v) \u2265 0 for i \u2208 {d, e, f}. Indeed, both selectors are consistent on those elements and they satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 7, hence the conclusion. We\nshall proceed with the calculations of \u03b4\u03b2i (v) for i \u2208 {a, b, c} and a monotone game v \u2208 G:\n\u03b4\u03b2a (v) = v(\u3008a, b, c\u3009)\u2212 v(\u3008a, b\u3009) \u2212 v(\u3008b, c\u3009) + v(\u3008b\u3009) + v(\u3008a\u3009), \u03b4\u03b2b (v) = v(\u3008a, b\u3009) \u2212 v(\u3008a\u3009) \u2265 0, \u03b4\u03b2c (v) = v(\u3008b, c\u3009) \u2212 v(\u3008b\u3009) \u2265 0.\nThe only interesting case is the sharing value (23) of player a:\n\u03c0qpa (v) = p(\u03b2) \u00b7 \u03b4 \u03b2 a (v) + (1\u2212 p(\u03b2)) \u00b7 \u03b4 \u03b1 a (v),\nwhere \u03b4\u03b1a (v) = v(\u3008a, b\u3009) \u2212 v(\u3008b\u3009). Note that if v(\u3008a, b\u3009) = v(\u3008b\u3009), then the sharing value is automatically positive. Therefore, assume that v(\u3008a, b\u3009) \u2212 v(\u3008b\u3009) is strictly positive. Then \u03b4\u03b2a (v) \u2265 v(\u3008b\u3009)\u2212 v(\u3008a, b\u3009), which gives\n\u03c0qpa (v) \u2265 p(\u03b2) \u00b7 (v(\u3008b\u3009)\u2212 v(\u3008a, b\u3009)) + (1\u2212 p(\u03b2)) \u00b7 (v(\u3008a, b\u3009) \u2212 v(\u3008b\u3009))\n= (1\u2212 2p(\u03b2)) \u00b7 (v(\u3008a, b\u3009)\u2212 v(\u3008b\u3009))\nIn particular, the sharing value \u03c0 qp a (v) is positive whenever p(\u03b2) < 1 2 .\nWe have already seen (Example 3) that a sharing value may fail to be positive. This result provides another perspective at the lack of positivity.\nProposition 4. Let p be a probability distribution such that p(\u03b1) > 12 for a unique inconsistent selector \u03b1. Then there exists a monotone game v such that \u03c0 qp t (v) < 0 for some player t.\nProof. Let \u03b1 be a selector inconsistent on t \u2208 P . We can assume that there exists T \u2208 D with \u03b1(T ) = t and for any S \u2208 D such that S \u2286 T , we have \u03b1(S) = t. To see this, consider the down-set T \u2032 = \u22c3 {D \u2208 D | \u03b1(D) = t}. If \u03b1(T \u2032) = t, we can take T \u2032 as T , otherwise \u03b1 is inconsistent also on t\u2032 = \u03b1(T \u2032) and we can iterate the argument considering the down-set \u22c3 {D\u2032 \u2208 D | \u03b1(D\u2032) = t\u2032}. With T and t as above and with the convention that the sum are over S \u2208 D, we get\n\u03b4\u03b1t (v) = \u2211\nt=\u03b1(S)\nv\u0302(S) = v\u0302(T ) + \u2211\nS\u2282T \u03b1(S)=t\nv\u0302(S) = v(T )\u2212 \u2211\nS\u2282T\nv\u0302(S) + \u2211\nS\u2282T \u03b1(S)=t\nv\u0302(S)\n= v(T )\u2212 \u2211\nS\u2282T \u03b1(S) 6=t\nv\u0302(S) = v(T )\u2212 \u2211\nS\u2286T\\t\nv\u0302(S)\u2212 \u2211\nt\u2208S\u2282T \u03b1(S) 6=t\nv\u0302(S)\n= v(T )\u2212 v(T \\ t)\u2212 \u2211\nt\u2208S\u2282T \u03b1(S) 6=t\nv\u0302(S).\nLet S1, . . . , Sk be the maximal elements of {S \u2208 D | S \u2282 T, t \u2208 S, \u03b1(S) 6= t} and consider any monotone game v which satisfies the following assumptions:\n\u2022 v(D) = 0 for every D \u2282 Si for some i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}.\n\u2022 v(D) \u2212 v(D \\ t) = 0 for every D such that t \u2208 D\u2217 and D /\u2208 {S1, . . . , Sk}.\n\u2022 v(Si) > 0 for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}.\nThen \u03b4\u03b1t (v) = \u2212kv(Si) and, by Lemma 7, \u03b4 \u03b2 t (v) = 0 or \u03b4 \u03b2 t (v) = v(Si) for any consistent selector \u03b2. Note that, given the consistent selectors \u03b21, . . . , \u03b2n whose probability is positive, we have p(\u03b1) > \u2211n i=1 p(\u03b2i) =: p\n\u2032. In either case, \u03c0 qp t (v) \u2264 p\n\u2032v(Si)\u2212(1\u2212p\u2032)kv(Si) = v(Si)(p\u2032\u2212(1\u2212p\u2032)k), which is strictly negative since p\u2032 < (1\u2212 p\u2032)k.\nOn the one hand, Example 5 shows that a sharing value (23) may be positive although there exists some inconsistent selector with a strictly positive probability. On the other, Proposition 4 shows that in case of a unique inconsistent selector with positive probability greater than 12 , there exists a monotone game v for which the corresponding sharing value is not positive.\nThe question whether it is possible to characterize positive sharing values (23) by the probability distributions p over selectors remains open for further research. In particular, the results above lead to the following conjecture: If a sharing value (23) is positive, then\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208S(D)\\C(D)\np(\u03b1) \u2264 \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208C(D)\np(\u03b1).\nIn summary, we have obtained the strict inclusions\nrandom-order values \u2282 positive sharing values \u2282 sharing values.\nBy Proposition 2, Proposition 3, and Example 1, we know that randomorder values are strictly contained in the family of values satisfying Linearity, Positivity, and Null player axiom. Such values have necessarily the form (26).\nProposition 5. Let \u03d5 be a value that satisfies Linearity, Positivity, and Null player axiom. Then\n\u03d5i(v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\n\u03b2i(S) \u00b7 (v(S)\u2212 v(S \\ i)), v \u2208 G, i \u2208 P, (26)\nfor some real numbers \u03b2i(S) \u2265 0.\nProof. Linearity of \u03d5 and (4) yield\n\u03d5i(v) = \u2211\n\u22056=S\u2208D\nv\u0302(S) \u00b7 \u03d5i(uS).\nSince any i /\u2208 S\u2217 is a null player in uS , the sum above becomes\n\u03d5i(v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\nv\u0302(S) \u00b7 \u03d5i(uS).\nBy Remark 1, \u03d5i(v) is equal to\n\u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\n\u03d5i(uS)  (v(S)\u2212 v(S \\ i))\u2212 \u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\u2217\n(v(T )\u2212 v(T \\ i)) + \u2211\nT\u2282S i\u2208T\u2217\n\u2211\nU\u2282T i\u2208U\u2217\n(v(U)\u2212 v(U \\ i))\u2212 . . .  \nConsequently, we can write\n\u03d5i(v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\n\u03b2i(S) \u00b7 (v(S)\u2212 v(S \\ i))\nfor some real numbers \u03b2i(S). By way of contradiction, suppose that there exist i \u2208 P and T \u2208 D such that \u03b2i(T ) < 0. Then we can find a game w such that w(S) \u2212 w(S \\ i) = 0 for every S 6= T and w(T ) \u2212 w(T \\ i) > 0. However, \u03d5i(w) < 0, which is a contradiction.\n3.4. Hierarchical value\nThe hierarchical value was proposed by Faigle and Kern in [11] for coalitional games in which the player set is any partially ordered set and the feasible coalitions are down-sets of the player set as in our setting. The hierarchical value is based on counting the rankings in which a player scores highest among the players in a given coalition. Specifically, for each S \u2208 D and every i \u2208 S, define\neS(i) = |{f \u2208 L(P ) | f(i) > f(j) for all j \u2208 S}|\nand\nhS(i) = eS(i)\n|L(P )| . (27)\nThe ratio hS(i) is called the hierarchical strength of player i in S. Observe that hS(i) > 0 if, and only if, the player i is a maximal element of S. Moreover,\n\u2211\ni\u2208S\nhS(i) = 1\n|L(P )|\n\u2211\ni\u2208S\neS(i) = 1\n|L(P )| \u00b7 |L(P )| = 1,\nsince every f \u2208 L(P ) is maximized over S at some element i \u2208 S\u2217, and any two linear extensions attaining their maxima at distinct elements of S\u2217 are necessarily different. We define the hierarchical value as the sharing value (17) where the corresponding sharing system q is\nq(S, i) =\n{ hS(i) i \u2208 S\u2217,\n0 i /\u2208 S\u2217, S \u2208 D, i \u2208 P.\nDefinition 4 ([11]). The hierarchical value is the sharing value \u03c8 : G \u2192 RP defined by\n\u03c8i(v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\nhS(i) \u00b7 v\u0302(S), i \u2208 P, v \u2208 G.\nFor example, the hierarchical value of players in a unanimity game uT is\n\u03c8i(uT ) =\n{ hS(i) i \u2208 T \u2217,\n0 i \u2208 P \\ T \u2217. (28)\nBy [11, Theorem 1], the hierarchical value \u03c8 is the only value satisfying Efficiency, Linearity, Null player axiom, and Hierarchical strength axiom, which is defined as follows.\nHierarchical Strength Let \u03d5 : G \u2192 RP be a value. For any nonempty S \u2208 D and players i, j \u2208 S,\nhS(i) \u00b7 \u03d5j(uS) = hS(j) \u00b7 \u03d5i(uS).\nIt can be shown that the uniqueness of hierachical value \u03c8 no more holds if Hierarchical Strength is replaced by the (weaker) Symmetry axiom.\nIt might not be immediately clear from Definition 4 that \u03c8 is a positive value. Positivity follows directly from the representation of \u03c8 as the randomorder value in sense of (9):\n\u03c8i(v) = 1\n|L(P )|\n\u2211\nf\u2208L(P )\n\u2206fi (v), i \u2208 P, v \u2208 G. (29)\nNow, consider any set S \u2286 P with the partial order of P restricted to S. We define eS = |{f | f is a linear extension of S}|. Note that eP = |L(P )|. The hierachical value can also be expressed as the average of marginal contributions of player i to every feasible coalition S in which i is maximal:\n\u03c8i(v) = \u2211\nS\u2208D i\u2208S\u2217\neS\\i \u00b7 eP\\S eP \u00b7 (v(S)\u2212 v(S \\ i)). (30)\nRemark 2. The formula (30) shows that the hierarchical value \u03c8 can be viewed as the so-called probabilistic value. This family of values was extensively studied in the standard model of coalitional games [24]. In that context, the class of probabilistic values was characterized as the family of values satisfying Linearity, Positivity, and Dummy player axiom [24, Theorem 5]. However, a probabilistic value lacks Efficiency. The class of efficient probabilistic values, the so-called quasivalues, coincides with random-order values in the standard model; see [24, Theorem 5].\n3.5. Other value concepts\nThere are many different approaches to the definition of coalitional games, feasible coalitions, and values for the games in which players form a hierarchy or precedence structure. We mention here some of them briefly, without claiming completeness. For further details, see the survey [2] or the discussion in [5].\nThe hierarchical solution is introduced in [1]. The hierachical solution is defined as a certain average of Harsanyi dividends. However, this value concept\nis not a sharing value in the sense of (17), since the averaging goes over all the coalititons to which the player belongs and not only over the coalitions where the player is maximal. The main differences of hierarchical solution and the hierarchical value of Faigle and Kern [11] are pointed out in [1].\nAnother class of values is constructed for the games in which every coalition of players is feasible, so that the coalitional game is defined for all subsets S \u2286 P . This makes the distinction between such games and the setting considered in this paper. The case in point are coalitional games with permission structure and permission value studied in [23]. It was pointed out that the permission value is fundamentally different from the hierarchical value, both numerically and conceptually.\nIn a related stream of research, Be\u0301al et al. [5] recently introduced the priority value for coalitional games with the priority structure, which is given by any partial order on the player set P . The priority value can be axiomatized. We can formally introduce the priority value in our setting as the sharing value where each Harsanyi divident is split uniformly among the maximal players. However, the resulting sharing value is not positive \u2014 see Example 3."

We provided a common framework for different solution concepts in case the player set forms a boolean algebra. In particular, we focus on the class of sharing values, which are efficient, but not necessarily positive. Proposition 2 characterizes positive sharing values. Random-order values are described as average selector values by the admissible distributions over the selectors (Proposition 3). We also identify the necessary form for any value satisfying Linearity, Positivity, and Null player axiom (Proposition 5).\nWe will briefly mention several items for further research. Instead of studying the positivity of sharing values, which are efficient, it is possible to introduce probabilistic values, which are necessarily positive, and try to characterize when the latter are efficient; see also Remark 2. Note that many results in this paper do not depend on the assumption that the player set is a boolean algebra, and any partial order on the player set can be considered instead. We leave this more general framework for future investigation. The complexity results about enumerating linear extensions indicate that an efficient algorithm to compute the hierachical value or other random-order values cannot be ever found; see also the remark in [11, p. 260]. Therefore it seems inevitable to focus on the numerical methods to approximate the values using sampling techniques, similar to the existing methods for the classical Shapley value."

Namely we consider a discrete random vectorX = (X1, . . . , Xn) of input random varaiblesXi, a discrete target random variable Y , and a known joint probability distribution p of (X, Y ), the so-called true distribution. Let V = {1, . . . , n} be the index set for input random variables. For a nonempty set of indices A \u2286 V , we will use the short notation\nXA =\u00d7 i\u2208A Xi.\nAnalogously, an element of XA is denoted by xA = (xi)i\u2208A and the same notation is used for random vectors, XA = (Xi)i\u2208A. We also use short notations X = XV , X = XV , and x = (x1, . . . , xn) \u2208 X .\nBy P we denote be the set of all joint probability distributions q of random vector (X, Y ), that is, the elements of P are the functions q : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 [0, 1]\nsatisfying \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\nq(x, y) = 1.\nLet PV be the set of all subsets of V . Any element A \u2208 PV is termed predictor as it is associated with the set of input random variables {Xi | i \u2208 A}. We will proceed with the definition of a coalitional game vp in the sense of Section 2 induced by the true distribution p. The player set in this game is the powerset of all predictors, PV , and the set of all feasible coalitions is the family of corresponding down-sets, D = D(PV ,\u2286). A coalition in this game is thus a down-set of predictors S \u2208 D.\nThe coalitional game vp depends on the optimal solutions to certain convex optimization problems. Given any nonempty set of predictors S \u2286 PV , consider the convex polytope PS \u2286 P of probability distributions q whose marginals qX and qXAY coincide with the corresponding marginals of the true distribution p, for all A \u2208 S. Specifically, PS is the set of all probability distributions q \u2208 P such that\nqX(x) = pX(x) = \u2211\ny\u2208Y\np(x, y)\nfor all x \u2208 X and\nqXAY (xA, y) = pXAY (xA, y) = \u2211\nxA\u0304\u2208XA\u0304\np(xA,xA\u0304, y)\nfor all A \u2208 S and all (xA, y) \u2208 XA \u00d7 Y, where A\u0304 = N \\ A. Note that if S \u2286 T \u2286 PV , then PT \u2286 PS . Indeed, if q \u2208 PT , then necessarily qXAY = pXAY for all A \u2208 S.\nRecall that, for any S \u2286 PV , the set of maximal elements in S,\nS\u2217 = {A \u2208 S | there is no B \u2208 S such that A \u2282 B},\nis an antichain. We claim that\nPS = PS\u2217 . (C.1)\nIt follows immediately that PS \u2286 PS\u2217 by the inclusion S\u2217 \u2286 S. Suppose that q \u2208 PS\u2217 and let B \u2208 S. Then there is necessarily some A \u2208 S\u2217 such that A \u2287 B. Since qXAY = pXAY by the hypothesis, the inclusion A \u2287 B immediately implies that qXBY = pXBY . This proves q \u2208 PS , so (C.1) is true.\nWe recall that the (Shannon) entropy is\nH(q) = \u2212 \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\nq(x, y) log2 q(x, y), q \u2208 P,\nand the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or the relative entropy) is\nD(q1 \u2016 q2) = \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\nq1(x, y) log2 q1(x, y)\nq2(x, y) , q1, q2 \u2208 P.\nThe entropy functional H : P \u2192 [0,\u221e) is continuous and strictly concave. Therefore, for any down-set S \u2208 D, the maximizer of H over PS exists and it is determined uniquely. The resulting probability distribution\npS = argmax q\u2208PS H(q) (C.2)\nis called the split distribution. It follows from (C.1) that\npS = pA (C.3)\nfor all S,A \u2286 PV such that S\u2217 = A. The equality (C.3) explains the use of down-sets S (or antichains, equivalently) instead of arbitrary sets of predictors as coalitions.\nExample 6 (The case of n = 3 input variables). We assume V = {1, 2, 3} and consider a random vector (X1, X2, X3, Y ) whose true probability distribution is p. The set of predictors and the associated lattice of their down-sets are depicted in Figure C.4. Let S be the down-set \u300813, 23\u3009. Then computing the split distribution (C.2) over P\u300813,23\u3009 amounts to solving the following linearly constrained convex optimization problem:\nMinimize \u2211\n(x1,x2,x3,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\nq(x1, x2, x3, y) log2 q(x1, x2, x3, y)\nsubject to the constraints\nq(x1, x2, x3, y) \u2265 0 \u2200x1, x2, x3, y\u2211\nx1,x2,x3,y\nq(x1, x2, x3, y) = 1\n\u2211\ny\nq(x1, x2, x3, y) = \u2211\ny\np(x1, x2, x3, y) \u2200x1, x2, x3\n\u2211\nx2\nq(x1, x2, x3, y) = \u2211\nx2\np(x1, x2, x3, y) \u2200x1, x3, y\n\u2211\nx1\nq(x1, x2, x3, y) = \u2211\nx1\np(x1, x2, x3, y) \u2200x2, x3, y\nFor the problems of smaller size such as the one in Example 6, the computation of split distribution can be formulated as the optimization on the exponential cone in MOSEK solver. We discuss special cases in which the split distributions has closed-form expression. In that follows, we frequently omit the curly brackets and the commas in order to use a more compact notation for predictors. For example, we can write 23 in place of {2, 3}. In the similar spirit \u300823, 1\u3009 denotes the antichain {{2, 3}, {1}}.\n1. Let S = PV . We get PPV = {p}, so the split distribution is the true distribution p in this case.\n2. Let S = \u30081, . . . , n\u3009. Then PS contains precisely those q such that qX = pX and qXiY = pXiY for all i \u2208 V , and the split distribution is the product of one-dimensional marginals of p,\npS = pX1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 pXnpY .\n3. Let S = {\u2205}. Then PS contains precisely those q such that qX = pX and qY = pY , and the split distribution is given by the product distribution\npS = pXpY .\nRemark 3. As explained in [4], the split distribution pS can be also characterized as the unique minimizer of Kullback-Leibler divergence D(. \u2016 u) over PS from the uniform distribution u \u2208 P. Another equivalent formulation leading to the split distribution is based on the minimazation of Kullback-Leibler divergence of the true distribution p from the exponential family; see [3, 17].\nFinally, we are in position to define the coalitional game vp used in Information Attribution. For any true probability distribution p \u2208 P, the coalitional game vp maps any nonempty down-set S \u2208 D of predictors to a nonnegative real number\nvp(S) = D(p S \u2016 pXpY ) =\n\u2211\n(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\npS(x, y) log2 pS(x, y)\npX(x)pY (y) , (C.4)\nwhere pS is the split distribution and the term on the right-hand-side is the Kullback-Leibler divergence of pS from the product distribution pXpY . We put vp(\u2205) = 0.\nSince pXpY = p {\u2205}, the probability distribution pXpY is precisely the split distribution corresponding to the empty predictor \u2205. Thus, the number vp(S) can be interpreted as the amount of information contained in pS in addition to the information already represented by pXpY . Observe that\nvp({\u2205}) = D(pXpY \u2016 pXpY ) = 0.\nMoreover, the assessment of predictor S = PV is the mutual information between X and Y ,\nvp(PV ) = D(p \u2016 pXpY ) = \u2211\n(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y\np(x, y) log2 p(x, y)\npX(x)pY (y) = I(X;Y ).\nThe natural question is whether the nonnegative coalitional game vp has some additional properties such as those discussed in Section 2.2. It is easy to see that vp is monotone: If S \u2286 T , then vp(S) \u2264 vp(T ), where we may assume that S 6= \u2205. Indeed, by nonnegativity of D and the Pythagorean theorem of information geometry [3, Theorem 2.8(2)],\nvp(S) = D(p S \u2016 pXpY ) \u2264 D(p S \u2016 pXpY )+D(p T \u2016 pS) = D(pT \u2016 pXpY ) = vp(T ).\nIt was shown in [4, Remark 7.5] that the game vp is neither supermodular nor submodular.\nInformation Attribution distributes the contribution of predictors S \u2208 D in the game vp given by (C.4) according to the hierachical value discussed in Section 3.4. Using the random-order approach, the contribution of predictor S \u2208 D is\n\u03c8S(vp) = 1\n|L(PV )|\n\u2211\nf\u2208L(PV )\n\u2206fS(vp), (C.5)\nwhere L(PV ) is the set of all linear extensions (admissible permutations) of PV , and \u2206fS(vp) is the marginal contribution (7) of predictor S in game vp with respect to a linear extension f . Other alternative formulas to compute \u03c8S(vp) are reviewed in Section 3.4. The examples of Information Attribution applied to different true distributions are discussed in [4, Section 6]."
