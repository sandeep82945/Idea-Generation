 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Test the RMMDet system in more complex and diverse real-world environments to further validate its robustness and applicability. The current experiments are limited to a simulated environment and small-scale real sandbox. Testing on public roads with uncontrolled conditions could reveal limitations.

2. Explore more advanced sensor fusion algorithms like graph neural networks to model relationships between different sensor detections more effectively. This could improve accuracy compared to the current separate detection branches and late fusion.

3. Investigate adding more sensor modalities like sound, temperature, etc. to provide additional complementary information. This could make the system more robust to weather/lighting conditions.

4. Optimize the system for real-time performance on embedded hardware deployed roadside rather than high-end GPUs. This is necessary for large-scale deployment. Exploring model compression, pruning, efficient architectures etc. 

5. Enhance the cooperative scheduling system using reinforcement learning and prediction. The current scheduling is rule-based but learned policies could optimize for complex objectives like minimizing congestion. Predicting traffic flows could also improve proactive scheduling.
