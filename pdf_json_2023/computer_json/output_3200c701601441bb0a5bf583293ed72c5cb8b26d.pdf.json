    "abstractText": "Online teacher professional development (OTPD) opportunities are made available to teachers and draw increasing research attention. As the key characteristics of teachers\u2019 participation in OTPD, the frequency and quality of participation are increasingly concerned. However, the relationship between teacher participation frequency and participation quality is still unclear. Addressing this problem not only helps reveal teachers\u2019 participation patterns in OTPD, but also provides support for promoting teachers\u2019 online professional learning and improving OTPD organization and management. To identify teachers\u2019 participation patterns and the relationship between participation frequency and participation quality in OTPD, this study analyzed 5,064 log records of 415 teachers using lag sequential analysis, t-test, and Chi-square test. The findings indicated that teachers preferred shallow participation behaviors, such as sharing resources and experience, and seldom carried out deep participation/engagement behaviors (e.g., proposing knowledge topics, establishing teaching and research practices). Teachers with higher participation frequency had lower participation quality in OTPD and tended to repeat shallow participation behaviors. Finally, the study proposed some suggestions for better supporting teachers\u2019 participation in online professional development, such as strengthening the links between information sharing activities, knowledge construction activities, and teaching and research practices.",

            "text": "Online teacher professional development (OTPD), which enhances the collaboration and interaction among teachers (Prenger et al., 2017; Zhang & Liu, 2019), is a popular way to promote teachers\u2019 professional competence (Greenhow & Askari, 2017). Online communities and networks remove the limits of learning space (Wu & Nian, 2021; Yang & Chen, 2020), support asynchronous interaction and knowledge sharing (Powell & Bodur, 2019), and offer more authentic, flexible and personalized chances for teachers\u2019 professional development (Zhang et al., 2017). Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, OTPD becomes a must because face-to-face approaches are restricted (UNESCO, 2020).\nTo promote OTPD, many countries have developed online professional development programs (Jansen in de Wal et al., 2020; Ke et al., 2019; McChesney & Aldridge, 2021). Teachers are encouraged to participate in these programs and complete certain online learning tasks or online learning time. For example, the United States has developed the e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS) program to provide online expert mentoring for new teachers (Alyson, 2012). The program required new teachers to participate in online discussion sessions, complete teaching inquiry practices, and finish a learning outcomes summary. However, due to lack of time, heavy workload, or lack of effective support, many teachers regard online professional development programs as tasks (Ata\u015f et al., 2021; Botham, 2018). In this case, whether teachers have conducted effective professional learning, what is the participation pattern and participation quality of teachers in OTPD are still not clear. Clarifying the above issues can deepen the understanding of the current situation and patterns of OTPD, help to effectively manage online professional development programs, and promote teacher development.\nAs the key characteristics of teachers\u2019 participation in OTPD, the frequency and quality of participation are increasingly concerned. For example, some scholars analyze teachers\u2019 participation frequency in online learning activities, including the number of videos watched, the frequency of participation in forums, and the number of interactions with others, to explore teachers\u2019 participation status in OTPD (Beisiegel et al., 2017; Bonafini, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). In addition, in order to improve the quality of teachers\u2019 participation in OTPD, some researchers explored incentive and intervention strategies that could improve teachers\u2019 efficacy (Ansley et al., 2021; Reeves & Chiang, 2018) and learning performance (Biasutti et al., 2019; Jim\u00e9nez & O\u2019Shanahan, 2016; Ma et al., 2021). Although there have been various studies related to teachers\u2019 participation in OTPD. The relationship between teacher participation frequency and participation quality is still unclear. Addressing this problem not only helps deepen the understanding of the mechanism of OTPD, but also provides support for promoting teachers\u2019 online professional learning and improving OTPD organization and management. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze teachers\u2019 participation patterns and the relationship between participation frequency and participation quality in OTPD, based on the process data of online professional development. Three research questions guided the present study:\n(1) What are the distribution characteristics of various behaviors demonstrated by the teachers in OTPD?\n1 3\n15012\nEducation and Information Technologies (2023) 28:15011\u201315030\n(2) What is the correlation between teachers\u2019 participation frequency and participation quality in OTPD?\n(3) What is the difference between frequent users and seldom users in OTPD?"

            "text": "Constrained by convenience, flexibility, and sustainability, traditional face-to-face teacher professional development activities cannot meet all the needs of teachers (Powell & Bodur, 2019). A new way is needed to promote teacher professional development such as teachers\u2019 competence in teaching with technology (Bragg et al., 2021; Prestridge, 2017). In this case, OTPD was proposed as a process where teachers can collaborate and communicate with others, solve teaching problems and grow together through online communities (Atapattu et al., 2019; Lucas et al., 2021; Powell & Bodur, 2019; Reiso\u011flu & \u00c7ebi, 2020).\nTo promote effective online professional development, educational research has made great progress in enhancing our knowledge and understanding of OTPD. Some researchers explored the role of OTPD in teacher development and found that OTPD enables teachers to improve their content knowledge, teaching beliefs, selfefficacy and teaching practice (Bragg et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2022). For instance, Erickson et al. (2012) found that teachers who participated in online professional development programs acquired knowledge and improved ability to apply researchbased practices. Marquez et al. (2016) also reported that online teacher professional development programs were beneficial to the improvement of teachers\u2019 classroom management skills and self-efficacy. Philipsen et al. (2019) found that online teacher professional development played an essential role in facilitating teacher reflection. In these studies, the importance of OTPD for teacher development has been well documented. In-depth analysis of teacher participation in OTPD would help deepen the understanding of the mechanisms of OTPD and promote the effective development of teachers\u2019 professional abilities."

            "text": "Teacher participation frequency has been considered as an important indication that reflects performance in OTPD (Beisiegel et al., 2017; F. C. Bonafini 2017; Vu et al., 2014). Teacher participation frequency mainly refers to the number of times teachers participate in various learning activities of online professional development, such as the number of videos watched and assignments submitted (Li & Baker, 2018), the frequency of visiting online learning platforms, and the number of times to participate in community peer activities (Tsiotakis & Jimoyiannis, 2016). Some scholars have studied the current situation of teacher participation frequency in OTPD. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) analyzed the frequency of teachers\u2019 interactions with other teachers on the OTPD platform and revealed that teachers\u2019 participation frequency was low and the interaction network was low reciprocal. Satar and Akcan\n1 3\n15013\nEducation and Information Technologies (2023) 28:15011\u201315030\n(2018) investigated teachers\u2019 online participation by calculating their weekly online forum posts.\nTeacher participation quality is defined as the investment of energy, concentration, and effort in OTPD (Henrie et al., 2015; Kuh, 2001), which is increasingly emphasized as a critical factor for impacting professional learning and development performance (Li & Baker, 2018; Robson, 2018). High participation quality in OTPD enables teachers to have a deeper and more solid understanding of the knowledge they have learned (Trust et al., 2016). Therefore, high participation quality is a predictor of continuing motivation, commitment, and overall performance (Shernoff & Hoogstra, 2001). Considering the positive role of participation quality in teacher professional development, scholars have focused on the quality of teacher participation (Ma et al., 2021; Prestridge, 2017). For example, Chen et al. (2009) analyzed teachers\u2019 online synchronous discussions on mathematics teaching and found that most messages were at the level of simple information processing involving less cognitive and metacognitive skills, and the quality of teachers\u2019 participation was low. Prestridge and Tondeur (2015) investigated the quality of teachers\u2019 participation in OTPD by analyzing teachers\u2019 reflective discussions and constructive dialogues related to teaching and research practices.\nAlthough both teacher participation frequency and participation quality focus on teacher participation and are important in OTPD. They focus on different aspects of teachers\u2019 performance in OTPD. Specifically, participation frequency is more focused on the quantity of teachers\u2019 online behaviors, while participation quality is more concerned with teachers\u2019 information processing and knowledge construction behind their online behaviors (Heflin et al., 2017). Although there are some findings regarding the current status of participation frequency and participation quality in OTPD, the current understanding of teacher participation patterns in OTPD still needs to be further deepened. Clarifying the relationship between teacher participation frequency and participation quality can deepen the understanding of the participation patterns and mechanisms of OTPD, support the organization and management of teacher professional development, and promote efficient teacher professional development. Therefore, this study aimed to address this research gap and provide useful recommendations for guiding teachers, as well as for the effective implementation of OTPD activities."

The details of\n1 3\n15016\nEducation and Information Technologies (2023) 28:15011\u201315030\nthe procedure to map the various operation behaviors to different participation types are as follows.\nFirstly, based on the previous research (Tuck, 2013), participation types can be divided into two categories: shallow participation and deep participation (or called engagement). Shallow participation refers to people taking part in something in very defined and determined ways, which is occasional and is designed to have little structural impact. For example, individuals share information they have comprehended to others. On the contrary, deep participation (or called engagement) refers to people helping define the scope of discussion, the rules of engagement, and the structure of relationships. For example, individuals collectively design curriculum, develop processes of brainstorming and decision-making. Therefore, this study classified teacher participation into two different types: shallow participation and deep participation (or called engagement).\nThen, according to the definition of shallow participation (as mentioned above), shallow participation included sharing information. Therefore, teachers\u2019 operation behaviors of \u201cinformation and resources sharing activities\u201d belong to shallow participation. Specifically, combining the information of Table 1, the behaviors of \u201csharing resources and experience\u201d and \u201ccommenting on shared information\u201d belong to shallow participation.\nFinally, the engagement theory indicated emphasizing collaboration, project-based assignments, and doing projects with a realistic focus are three primary means to accomplish engagement (Kearsley & Shneiderman, 1998). Meanwhile, deep participation (or called engagement) refers to people helping define the scope of discussion, the rules of engagement, and the structure of relationships. The above descriptions of engagement and deep participation are consistent with the descriptions of discussion and communication activities and the collaborative teaching and research practices in OTPD. Therefore, teachers\u2019 operation behaviors of \u201cdiscussion and communication activities\u201d and \u201ccollaborative teaching and research practice activities\u201d belong to engagement (or called deep participation). Specifically, combining the information of Table 1, the behaviors of \u201cproposing knowledge topics\u201d, \u201cdiscussing on knowledge topics\u201d, \u201cestablishing teaching and research practices\u201d, \u201cparticipating in teaching and research practices\u201d, and \u201csummarizing opinions or feelings\u201d belong to deep participation."

Specifically, we imported the log data into SPSS 26.0 software, and then used \u201cAnalyze \u2192 Descriptive Statistics \u2192 Frequencies\u201d functions to calculate the frequency and proportion of each behavior, representing the frequency distributions of various behaviors. Then, based on the behavior frequency and date, used the plot function of python 3.8 software to draw a time series diagram. This diagram represented the time series characteristics of each type of participation (i.e., shallow participation and deep participation/ engagement).\n1 3\n15017\nEducation and Information Technologies (2023) 28:15011\u201315030\nConcerning the second research question, we first defined the participation frequency and participation quality of each teacher in OTPD. In this study, the participation frequency of each teacher was represented using their sum frequency of behaviors in OTPD (as shown in Eq. 1). According to the define of participation quality and deep participation as mentioned in the previous section (Sect. 2.2 and Sect. 3.4.1), the participation quality of each teacher was represented by their proportion of deep participation/engagement behaviors in all behaviors (as shown in Eq. 2). Then, a scatter plot was used to preliminarily explore the relationship between teacher participation frequency and participation quality, and a sample t-test was used to confirm whether teachers at different levels of participation frequency (i.e., frequent users and seldom users) had significantly different participation quality.\nPf = Num (SRE) + Num (CSI) + Num (PKT ) + Num (DKT ) + Num (ETRP ) + Num (PTRP ) + Num (SOF ) (1)\nPq = (Num (PKT ) + Num (DKT ) + Num (ETRP ) + Num (PTRP ) + Num (SOF ))/Pf \u00d7 100% (2)\nHere Pf refers to the participation frequency of one teacher in OTPD, Pq refers to the participation quality of one teacher in OTPD. Num (SRE), Num (CSI) , Num (PKT ), Num (DKT ), Num (ETRP ), Num (PTRP ), Num (SOF ) respectively represent the frequency of behaviors SRE, CSI, PKT, DKT, ETRP, PTRP, SOF.\nRegarding the third research question, behavior distribution and behavior transition of frequent users and seldom users were investigated to explore the difference between frequent users and seldom users. Chi-square test was used to investigate the difference in behavior distribution between frequent users and seldom users. Furthermore, lag sequential analysis can detect behavioral sequence patterns that are not due to random effects (Arias-Pujol & Anguera, 2020; Bakeman & Gottman, 1997). Therefore, this study applied lag sequential analysis to investigate behavior transition of frequent users and seldom users by Generalized Sequential Querier 5.1 software. In the lag sequence analysis process, we first calculated the behavioral transition matrix represented by z-scores. In the behavioral transition matrix, only z-scores higher than 1.96 indicate that there is a significant transition relationship between the two behaviors (Bakeman & Gottman, 1997). And then we constructed the behavioral transition diagram, which only showed the significant behavioral transitions."

The frequency of teacher behaviors showed a trend of increasing first and decreasing later, and teachers had more behaviors in the middle stage. In terms of each category of behaviors, shallow participation behaviors occurred throughout the whole stage and were mainly concentrated in the middle stage.

Teachers\u2019 participation quality in the frequent user group and the seldom user group was compared using t-test. As Table 4 shows, compared with the seldom user group, teachers\u2019 participation quality in the frequent user group was significantly lower (t = -10.44, p < 0.001).

            "text": "This study aimed to understand teachers\u2019 participation patterns in online teacher professional development and the relationship between participation frequency and participation quality. Some findings are worth further discussion. The results showed that teachers preferred shallow participation behaviors (e.g., sharing resources and experience accounting for 61.7%), and seldom carried out deep participation/engagement behaviors (e.g., proposing knowledge topics accounting for 1.4%, establishing teaching and research practices accounting for 1.0%). Consistent with previous research findings, many teachers only exchange information in online communities\n1 3\n15022\nEducation and Information Technologies (2023) 28:15011\u201315030\n(Neuman & Cunningham, 2009; Tschannen-Moran & McMaster, 2009). In addition, shallow participation behaviors (information and resources sharing) mainly happened in the middle stage, and deep participation/engagement behaviors (discussion and communication, collaborative teaching and research practice) mainly took place in the pre-mid stage. This result aligns with the finding in online discussions that teachers mainly expressed their opinions in the middle period rather than in the later period (Redmond, 2015). This may be because teachers are not motivated enough to continue participating in these activities (Ketelaar et al., 2014). To improve this phenomenon, formulating effective strategies to enhance teachers\u2019 willingness to continue participation in OTPD is important (Tondeur et al., 2018).\nIt was found that teachers with high participation frequency (i.e., frequent users) had lower levels of participation quality than teachers with low participation frequency (i.e., seldom users). We further compared the difference in behavior distribution and behavior transition between the frequent user and seldom user groups. The results of behavioral distribution analysis showed that the frequent user group preferred to share resources and experience and propose knowledge topics, while the seldom user group preferred to discuss knowledge topics, participate in teaching and research practices, and summarize opinions or feelings in these practices. This implied that teachers who frequently participated in online teacher professional development were keen to share personal experience, resources, and educational materials. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2017) found that information sharing and comparison were the most-frequent behaviors in online collaborative learning activities. This may be because, teachers tend to perform simple assignments such as sharing information with other teachers instead of investing additional time and energy in higher level of cognitive thinking, like thinking critically about new theories or ideas, and engaging in in-depth discussions with other teachers about knowledge building and teaching practices (Chen et al., 2009).\nThen, the behavior transition analysis showed that the frequent user group of teachers mainly inclined to share resources and experience (SRE), comment on shared information (CSI) and discuss on knowledge topics (DKT) repeatedly. And, it was difficult for the frequent user group to convert shallow participation behaviors (SRE and CSI) into deep participation/engagement behaviors. Similarly, Huang et al. (2019) analyzed user interaction patterns in online discussions and found that participants tend to adopt similar behaviors when others shared information. This may be due to the characteristics of high continuity and concentration of the same type of behaviors. Therefore, to promote teachers to further explore and generate deeper participation behaviors, it may be necessary to adopt some strategies to enhance the relevance of various activities in OTPD (Hou et al., 2009)."

This study provides new insights into teachers\u2019 online professional development and makes two main contributions to previous research.\nFirst, this study applied engagement theory to identify teacher participation patterns in OTPD and revealed the relationship between the participation frequency and participation quality. As a widely recognized theory, engagement theory is often intended to be a conceptual framework for technology-based learning, with an emphasis on meaningful learning, and has been used in empirical studies on a range of topics (Annamalai et al., 2023; McKenzie et al., 2022; Xing et al., 2022). Despite the theory\u2019s widespread use in a variety of settings, research on teachers\u2019 online professional development remains limited. This study expands the application field of engagement theory and contributes to the further development and application of this theory.\nSecond, this study bridges a research gap in the existing literature by exploring the relationship between the participation frequency and participation quality in OTPD. Previous studies have evaluated the frequency and quality of teacher participation in online professional development (Zhang et al., 2017; Trust et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2021). However, few studies have focused on the patterns of teacher participation in OTPD and the relationship between the participation frequency and participation quality of teachers. More importantly, this study conducts an in-depth analysis of the behavioral distributions and behavioral transitions of frequent and seldom used teacher groups, which has not been explicitly explored in previous studies. These research findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of online teacher professional development, and serve as references for promoting teacher professional development."

Furthermore, this study found that teachers who participated frequently in OTPD had lower level of participation quality. Therefore, teacher educators should pay attention to the differences between teachers at different levels of participation frequency.\nFirst, given the repeated shallow participation behaviors (information sharing) adopted by frequently participating teachers, it is important to construct some mechanisms or strategies to increase the transition rate of sharing and commenting on information to deep participation/engagement behaviors. Appropriate behavioral interventions and enhanced links between information sharing activities and other activities (e.g., collaborative teaching and research activities) can be beneficial (Liu et al., 2016). For example, after information sharing behaviors, provide group oriented learning tasks to lead to more diversified and in-depth interaction (Peng et al., 2016), and use peer assessment mechanisms to promote knowledge co-construction and sharing (Hou et al., 2009).\n1 3\n15024\nEducation and Information Technologies (2023) 28:15011\u201315030\nSecond, as for teachers with seldom participation, teacher educators can design diverse and flexible activities to increase their willingness to participate in online professional development (Ke et al., 2019). It is necessary to design strategies to stimulate teachers to take more deep participation/engagement behaviors that will lead to high-quality instructional activities in their teaching practices (Chen et al., 2019). The result showed that teachers\u2019 deep participation/engagement behaviors gradually decreased in the middle stage of online professional development activities. Therefore, it would be necessary to provide supports before they stop participating in knowledge construction or collaborative teaching and research activities in OTPD. For example, teacher educators can provide scaffolding for teachers\u2019 learning tasks to reduce teachers\u2019 perceived task difficulty (Zhang et al., 2019). Proactive school policy support, positive organizational climate, formulating collective action, self-regulation and interpersonal interaction among members may be effective approaches (Chen et al., 2022a; Lu & Churchill, 2014; Wu et al., 2022). Also, some studies have attempted to improve teachers\u2019 participation by improving online environment and activity (Beach, 2017; Lee & Brett, 2015) and establishing performance evaluation and feedback mechanisms (Xing & Gao, 2018)."

The results suggested that teachers preferred shallow participation behaviors (e.g., sharing resources and experience), and teachers who frequently participate in online professional development had the lower levels of participation quality. To explore this phenomenon, the behavior distribution and behavior transitions of frequent user and seldom user groups of teachers were analyzed. The results indicated that that frequent user group of teachers tended to share information repeatedly, which was considered as shallow participation behaviors. Moreover, frequent user group of teachers rarely transited information sharing behaviors into other deep participation/engagement behaviors (e.g., participating in teaching and research practices). These findings help deepen the understanding of teachers\u2019 participation patterns of OTPD and provide some implications for improving the quality and efficacy of OTPD.\nThis study has some limitations. First, the sample and data of this study are not representative enough, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Future research could expand the scope of sampling, such as conducting larger sample size, cross-country, and cross-cultural studies. Finally, this study analyzed teachers\u2019 participation and engagement only through their online behaviors.
