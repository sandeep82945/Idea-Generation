    "abstractText": "This study entails the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with good selectivity coefficients for azo dye as a potential sorbent material to extract azo dye from polluted aqueous media. A series of MIPs for methyl red (MR) as a template, were synthesized by changing the molar ratio of functional monomers, via precipitation polymerization format of non-covalent approach. Water-soluble functional monomer; acrylic acid (AA) was used to weave the frame work of polymers while ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was utilized as crosslinking monomer. The impact of different experimental parameters, such as mole ratio of monomer (functional) to crosslinking monomer on the molecular recognition was investigated. The highly efficient and selective MR-MIP was used for the removal of spiked MR dye from different water samples. The selected imprinted polymer, MR1-MIP was able to selectively remove the MR molecules from aqueous media. A significant amount of dye was removed by MR1-MIP from the river water samples with a high degree of removal efficiency i.e. 92.25%. The imprinting factor of 3.75 for MR1-MIP indicated that the high selectivity in terms of adsorption for MR. A minimum loss of only ~ 3.35% in the removal efficiency within ten sequential cycles of adsorption\u2013desorption study evidenced that MR-MIPs could be used as the most cost effective and best sorbent for the removal of MR from polluted water. Furthermore, the structural properties of MR-MIPs were characterized by FTIR and EDX, whereas TGA, SEM and BET were used to describe the thermal, morphological and surface structures of the particles, respectively.",

            "text": "The color index reveals that the dying process is coupled with about 8000 commercial products [1, 2] and the use of synthetic dyes had been a significant part of nearly all industries. Dyes belonging to the recalcitrant class of pollutants and their color contamination can easily be identified [3]. Dye waste (10\u201315% of total dyes production) is a major part of a complex industrial sewage from these industries and could never be recommended for any household or industrial usage [4]. Paper and pulp industries [5], craft bleaching industries [6], tanneries [7], fabric industries [8], pharmaceutical industries, rubber, textile, leather, cosmetics and dyestuff manufacturing industries are amongst the source of generating immensely toxic colored effluents [9]. About 72% of the total dyes used and manufactured in the world are azo dyes [10] and 2/3 part of this is utilized in textile industries [11]. The inefficiency in textile processing of dying creates a huge amount of water stacked with azo dye stuff. These residues are directly transmitted into the water bodies and water with this unfavorable condition is potentially distressing for both toxicological and aesthetical reasons [12]. Azo dyes are capable of remaining persistent in the environment due to the presence of aromatic rings, azo and amino groups. The presence of dyes is undesirable in water even at very low concentrations. Due to their complex structure many of these are very difficult to degrade. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to remove the azo dyes from industrial waste before it is disposed into the water stream which may disrupt the aquatic biota [13]. Methyl red is a well-known dye being used in paper printing and textile dying sector. Potentially it is carcinogenic and also responsible for long term adverse effects in aquatic environment. It is toxic both by ingestion and inhalation and its contact may cause skin and eye irritation [14]. Therefore its removal owes population health and environmental protection. Various biological and chemical methods have been reported in literature for the removal of azo dyes [15\u201324]. A wide range of physical techniques are also available for the elimination of dyes from contaminated aqueous media [25, 26]. Amongst all the employed approaches and the methods reported in the literature, adsorption has been proven as one of the most effective technique and the best equilibrium process [27]. Although the reported methods have satisfactory results for the removal of dyes but they lack specificity and have been used for the nonspecific adsorption process which in turn results in poor selectivity. Therefore, a method which is highly specific and selective is required to remove dyes from the waste water effluents. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are the solution for the selective removal of toxic materials such as dyes from waste water. MIPs are economical adsorbents/sorbents and offere a plenty of potential applications for future commercial purposes. MIPs have environmental safe procedure than any other current practices and can withstand\nharsh environmental conditions. MIPs are chemically, mechanically and thermally stable sorbents and are easily reproducible with extendable life cycles after their utilization [28, 29]. MIPs are highly cross-linked polymers with specific recognition ability for the target analyte. The advantages of MIPs as compared to the commonly used adsorbents are their high selectivity and specificity, reusability and low consumption. MIPs have many applications including solid-phase extraction [30] chromatographic separations [31], membrane separations [32], and sensors [33]. Previously MIPs have been applied for the removal/extraction of various analytes such as different dyes [34, 35], fungicides [36\u201338], melamine [39, 40], vanillic acid [41], gallic acid [42], cinnamic acid [43] piperine [44] and p-Coumaric acid [45] from different environmental and biological samples.\nIn this research, a series of novel molecularly imprinted polymers for methyl red (MR-MIPs) was synthesized to find out a suitable molar ratio of the components because it is the prime \u201ckey\u201d to enhance the affinity of MIPs towards their analyte (MR) as well as responsible for increasing the number of imprinted polymer binding sites [43, 44] to best of our knowledge no such study is reported in literature for methyl red. For the first time in this study impact of porogenic solvent on pore size distribution or pore structure was investigated [46]. During the experiment, template/monomer ratios (mmol/mmol) were optimized for obtaining novel optimal synthetic conditions for MIPs. Versatile and incredibly resourceful acrylic acid (AA) was used as monomer (functional) while ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) was utilized as crosslinking monomer, no such study is reported for such a combination for synthesis of MIPs utilizing methyl red as template molecule. Toluene was used as a porogenic solvent. Precipitation polymerization protocol was endorsed and interaction between MR and AA has been established by non-covalent linkage. The chemistry of the template molecule, functional monomer and cross-linking monomer, nature of solvent, quantitative ratio of participants to each other and the temperature are all those parameters that could affect the affinity and efficiency of the MR-MIPs with analyte [47] therefore all these parameters were cleverly optimized in this study. The constant variables for MR-MIPs series in this experimental work were the template (quality/quantity) and temperature. The optimization of the binding efficiency can be enhanced by improving the synthesis methodology [48], therefore different ratios of template and functional monomer have been used to provide a good binding efficiency in the polymers. Since contact time of MIPs with the analyte/template (MR) during polymerization played an important role in producing\nbetter MIPs with higher efficiency therefore the polymerization conditions were optimized to obtained MIPs with best rebinding potentials."

After that, 1.00\u00a0 mmol (68.5\u00a0 \u00b5l) of AA was added to the mixture as a functional monomer followed by the addition of 16.00\u00a0 mmol (2.97\u00a0 ml) of EGDMA (cross-linking monomer). The insertion of an initiator in the mixture (0.030\u00a0g of AIBN) initiated free radical polymerization process. Therefore, the molar ratio of template, functional monomer and cross-linking monomer for MR1-MIP was 0.1:1:16, respectively. The entire mixture was sonicated for 10\u00a0min to homogenize the mixture. This was followed by purging of reaction mixture with Nitrogen gas (N2) for 15\u00a0min. Then the reaction flask was sealed and kept in a hot water bath at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for the first 2\u00a0h followed by 80\u00a0\u00b0C for the next 6\u00a0 h. The produced polymer particles were then collected by using an assembly of vacuum filtration.\nThe same procedure was adopted for the synthesis of other two ratios with the only difference in the molar ratio of functional monomer. For the synthesis of MR2MIP and MR3-MIP, 2.00\u00a0mmol (137.12\u00a0\u00b5l) and 3.00\u00a0mmol (205.68\u00a0\u00b5l) of AA were taken separately in conical flasks labeled \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d respectively. Hence, the molar ratios of template, functional monomer and cross-linking monomer for MR2-MIP and MR3-MIP were 0.1:2:16 and 0.1:3:16 respectively. NIP synthesis (control/reference material) had been performed on the same way but without the use of any template."

After that the polymers were filtered to get \u201ctemplate free\u201d MIPs. Finally, the polymer particles were dried in an open air for 24\u00a0h. The main purpose of template extraction was to produce cavities within the polymer which can actively rebind the template molecules from different solution media.\nBatch binding assay (rebinding assay) The batch binding method was used to investigate the rebinding potential of MIPs, % removal efficiency and binding capacity/affinity [47] of MR-MIPs for methyl red. This also provides a way to choose a highly selective MRMIP for target analyte from synthetic series of different compositions.\nIn this assay, a set of twelve conical flasks of 100\u00a0 ml was washed, dried and labeled 1\u201312 for the evaluation of MR1-MIP. After that, 10\u00a0ml of 15\u00a0ppm standard solution of MR was added in each of the flask containing 0.1\u00a0g of the MR1-MIP. All the conical flasks containing polymer mixtures were agitated on an orbital shaker at 150\u00a0 rpm for 6\u00a0h continuously and subsequently each of the labeled flasks was removed from the shaker at every 30\u00a0min time interval. Before filtration the mixture of polymer and solution in each conical flask was allowed to settle down to collect the supernatant for UV\u2013Vis analysis. Binding assay for MR2-MIP, MR3-MIP and NIP was performed by using the same protocol as was adopted for MR1-MIP. Removal efficiency of methyl red by the MR-MIPs and\nNIP was determined by UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer. The \u03bbmax of standard MR solutions during calibration experiments was obtained at 424\u00a0nm.\nThe following equations were used to calculate the removal efficiency (Q, mg/g) and adsorption capacity (Qe) of the samples:\nwhere Co is the initial concentration (mg/L); Cf is the final concentration (mg/L); V is the volume (L); W is the weight (mg) of polymer.\nThe MR-MIP with highest rebinding efficiency will be selected for further studies and tests on MIPs efficiencies determinations.\nIn order to characterize the total adsorption/sorption profile of selected MR-MIP, various parameters were studied and optimized for the uptake of MR from aqueous solutions using this selected polymer (Table\u00a01). The parameters that were acquired for investigations are as follows: (i) MR concentration (ii) adsorbent dosage and (iii) pH."

            "text": "Figure\u00a01 depicts a schematic illustration of the synthesis of MR-MIPs. It can be seen in the reported investigations that molecular imprinting was done on relatively tiny molecules with a low polarity and a small number of ionizable groups [49\u201352]. As imprinting effect depends upon the size of template [53] hence in this work, a polar template, MR of medium molar mass (269.3\u00a0g/mol) containing one ionizable functional group (carboxylic group \u2013COOH) was studied. A non-covalent approach was employed to develop imprinted polymer particles with well orientated MR molecules. The development of MRMIP particles was conducted in three steps:\ni. Formation of template monomer complex ii. Polymerization and iii. Extraction of template.\nWeak forces may play a role in the creation of the template-monomer complex in the porogenic solvent prior to polymerization in molecular imprinting. The choice of functional monomer and absolute amounts of polymerization components can aid in the creation of MIPs with strong imprinting and extraction abilities.\n(7)\u03b2 = \u03b1 template\n\u03b1 interferent ,\nThey also influence the stability of the developed polymer and thus the execution of the MIPs to interface mainly with the objective analyte [29]. An excess of functional monomer compared to template can favor the prepolymerization template-monomer complex so, when the MR was allowed to stir with AA in porogenic solvent, the electrostatic and non-electrostatic forces were active, establishing non-covalent interaction between the MR and AA molecules prior to polymerization [54\u201356]. The H-bonding was the primary driving force for the molecular recognition between AA and MR (target molecule). Carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) of AA made it easier for it to create H-bonds with the amino group (tertiary amine) and carboxyl group of MR molecule. Azo groups (N=N) and HC\u2013 sites of aromatic rings may also be available for interactions in template molecule that may contribute to the fabrication of MR-MIP. As long as the mechanical stability and morphology of the polymer are concerned, cross-linking monomer is used that maintains the recognition sites [54]. EGDMA was particular for cross-linking. The crosslinking by EGDMA produced a strong backbone of the MR-MIP. The assigned porogenic solvent, toluene attracted the solubilization of the constituents and responsive in the AA\u2013MR interactions thus control and optimize the distribution of imprinting cavities within the resulted MR-MIP. Toluene is a non-polar aprotic solvent that ensures good solubility of the template and contributes to the formation of the H-bonding between the template and functional monomer [57, 58]. The selection of porogenic solvents and their optimal amount can influence the selectivity, porosity and the surface areas of MIPs [59]. All the synthesized MR-MIPs and NIP were obtained in powdered form with dark red and off white appearance, respectively. An imprinted polymer matrix was generated by leaching off the MR molecules which left the impressions complementary to the shape and structure of MR molecules thus can actively rebind MR."

            "text": "The amount of molecular recognition of produced MRMIPs was measured using a batch binding experiment. The spatial structure (three-dimensional) of the template molecule and the degree of matching of the binding sites were the major determinants of molecular recognition [29, 60]. The removal efficiency (%R) and binding capacity (Qe) of MIPs are crucial that signifies the effectiveness of the synthesized MR-MIPs in binding the analyte. The highest binding efficiency amongst MR-MIPs series (MR1-MIP, MR2-MIP and MR3-MIP) developed by changing the mole ratio of functional monomers and was for MR1-MIP (90.75%). In relation to the three different ratios of MR-MIPs, 0.1:1:16 (MR1-MIP) molar ratios of template, functional monomer and cross-linking\nmonomer exhibited the highest removal efficiency. The lowest performance was by NIP because of the weakest recognition sites due to the absence of template during the synthesis that inhibits the bindings. Figure\u00a02 portrays the removal efficiencies (%R) of developed MR-MIPs and NIP.\nThe strength of binding efficiencies for the MR-MIPs series is arrayed as follows:\nNIP-1\u2033 (0.1:1:16)<\nMR3-MIP (0.1:3:16)<\nMR2-MIP (0.1:2:16)<\nMR1-MIP (0.1:1:16)\n27.03% 85.63% 86.42% 90.75%\nThe improved efficiency of MR1-MIP was due to its compatible template, functional monomer, and crosslinking monomer ratios, which may have more specific recognition sites for the MR than the other two MR-MIP ratios. The affinity of MIP became more non-specific when the ratio of functional monomer to template was increased [61]. This could explain why MR2-MIP and MR3-MIP had a lower binding affinity for their respective analyte (MR) and therefore had poor removal effectiveness. In both the second and third ratios of MR-MIPs, an excess number of functional monomers (AA) causes\u2019 self-association [63] of functional monomer molecules within themselves, resulting in a decrease in the creation of binding sites on the respective MR-MIP. The choice of solvent is also a very important factor. In this study, toluene was used as the porogenic solvent for MR-MIPs synthesis. Being aprotic solvent, toluene did not interfere\nwith the H-bond formation between the participants rather it facilitated and made the polymers porous [59, 62].\nAs control polymers, NIP was developed and selected based on the best ratio compositions and this step is called the base extraction [63, 64]. The adsorptive response of corresponding NIP was very low and linear over the full time range of measurements because NIP exhibits the weakest recognition sites available for template molecules.\nThe impact of contact time on the adsorption of MR by MR-MIPs can be observed in the batch binding assay section. Based on the results obtained, the maximum extraction/removal of MR dye at 30\u00a0min had been used in the subsequent studies for MR1-MIP. It is clearly shown in Fig.\u00a0 2 that the rate of adsorption is initially very high, approaches a dynamic equilibrium and then remains almost constant despite further increase in contact time for MR-MIPs. It is clearly depicted in the graph (Fig.\u00a02) that with the increase in the contact time, the removal efficiency of MR-MIPs also increases. Initially, the dye molecules rapidly move towards the MRMIPs as the MIPs are starved for these dye molecules and the number of binding sites is very large that allow adsorption/sorption to take place very easily. As the time increases, the removal efficiency becomes constant without any further variations. At that time, the quantity of dye molecules adsorbed by the MR-MIPs and the amount of dye molecules desorbed from the polymer have reached a condition of dynamic equilibrium. So,\nthe binding sites of MR-MIPs became saturated and do not permit any further adsorption/sorption to proceed [55, 65\u201368]. The removal efficiency of MR1-MIP is increasing up to certain time period and then becomes almost constant at later stages due to the saturation of binding sites. The concentration of dye solutions may not change considerably after 30\u00a0 min for MR1-MIP. It is primarily assumed that the active binding sites of MR1-MIP had been fully saturated very early and the diffused pores did not permit the adsorption process to continue anymore. The maximum removal efficiency of 90.75% for MR1-MIP was observed at 30\u00a0 min. Hence, the contact time of 30\u00a0min was optimized for MR1-MIP as a representative of the MR-MIPs series.\nEffect of\u00a0MR concentrations on\u00a0the\u00a0uptake behavior of\u00a0MR1\u2011MIP The concentration of dye has an outward effect on its expulsion from any fluid media by MIP. The removal efficiency (%R) of MIP was enhanced with the increase in the initial concentration of dye (Fig.\u00a03). An increase in the initial dye concentration refers to the increase in dye molecules. The active binding sites of the MIP are well surrounded by dye molecules, resulting in greater and more effective adsorption. This trend can also be attributed to the fact that when the dye concentration rises, the responsible driving factors for mass transfer increases. The selected MR1-MIP presented similar trends as shown in Fig.\u00a0 3. The increasing trend of adsorption by MR1-MIP was observed up to a certain level of dye concentration. Then, further increases in the dye concentration have no apparent change in the adsorption process. This means that all the available binding sites on the polymer particles have been fully saturated [55, 65\u201368]. The maximum removal efficiency (%R) for MR1-MIP was found to be 90.75% with 15\u00a0ppm of the MR solution. Principally, 15\u00a0ppm was considered\nas the optimum concentration for MR1-MIP form calibration experiments.\nEffect of\u00a0polymer dosage on\u00a0the\u00a0uptake behavior of\u00a0MR1\u2011MIP In this research, the contact time and the concentration of MR solutions were kept constant but the dosage of MR1-MIP was studied using different amounts of polymer. The effect of polymer sample dosages (MR1-MIP) on the amount of MR removal was expressed as %R. Figure\u00a04 shows that the removal efficiency (%R) of dye increases for MR1-MIP, with the increase in the polymer dosage up to a certain limit which was followed by a gradual decline. Graphical depiction (Fig.\u00a0 4) can be detailed out that availability of binding sites of adsorbent has been increased by topping up the polymer dosage. It is feasible for MR dye molecules to spread over the MR1-MIP, resulting in an increase in adsorption phenomenon. Conversely, with the increase in dosage amount, the polymer particles formed aggregates and due to this aggregation the number of available binding sites accessible to dye molecules have decreased [55, 65\u201368]. The maximum %R for MR1-MIP was observed at 96.68% with an adsorbent dosage of 0.4\u00a0g. Thus, a dosage of 0.4\u00a0g was considered as optimum dosage for the selected MR1MIP at optimum agitation time and optimum concentration [69, 70].\nEffect of\u00a0MR solution pH on\u00a0the\u00a0uptake behavior of\u00a0MR1\u2011MIP The change of solution pH was conducted to know if MR-MIPs were pH sensitive polymers that exhibit conformational changes which may lead to swelling or shrinking behavior of the imprinted polymers [71]. Both the adsorbent surface properties and the degree of ionization of dye molecules are induced by altering the pH of solution. It is evident from the results in Fig.\u00a0 5 that the highest removal efficiency (%R) of MR was achieved at pH 7 with a %R of 99.51% for MR1-MIP. Because there are no structural changes in dye and MIP\nconfigurations at optimum pH (pH 7), maximal dye uptake was found as compared to acidic or basic media. The neutral (pH 7) condition was shown to be the best for the most interactions between the template and the imprinted sites. The specific binding sites bearing \u2013 COOH groups on the dye molecule might have changed due to the alteration of pH and consequently decreases possibility of binding with the polymer. There is a huge amount of H+ ions in an acidic media acting as competitor, the hydrophobic interactions are increased and H-bonding between MR molecules and selective binding sites are decreased and results in lowering the removal efficiency of MR1-MIP. While in basic media (higher pH), the low removal efficiency may be due to hydroxyl ionic interpretation of MR.\nAccording to Chen [72] the binding energy of the selectivity sites in MIPs is decreased in the non-optimum conditions of time, dye concentration, dosage of the polymer and pH of solution. As non-optimum conditions affected the adsorption pattern, the selected MR1-MIP was optimized in a succession and in conclusion to the extraction/removal efficiencies of the optimized MR1-MIP were summarized in Table\u00a02."

IF (\u03b1) value for the MR1-MIP is display in Table\u00a02. Higher IF value (\u03b1) of 3.75 for MR1-MIP indicated major degrees of imprinting in it. This significant IF in MR1-MIP may also attribute to the usage of appropriate medium polar solvent. It means that medium polar solvents are good porogenic solvent compositions for preparing MIPs for the azo dyes [53]."

Table\u00a03\nillustrates that decline in MR rebinding between first and tenth cycle was ~ 3.35% for MR1-MIP.

Both the dyes are anionic azo dyes and are structurally analogous to each other. Most of the physical and chemical properties exhibited by them are also comparable. The data was derived by employing UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometric analysis and then computed by using standard equations for distribution ratios (KD), selectivity coefficients (Ksel), relative selectivity coefficients (k\u2032) and selectivity factors (\u03b2) as shown in Table\u00a04. When monomers and templates are used in the proper ratios during the pre-polymerization process, several high-affinity sites will emerge, which may change the template distribution ratios in MIPs. The distribution ratios can be described in a variety of ways, for as by comparing the adsorption concentrations of the template and the interferent with an identical solutions initial concentration. The distribution coefficient D is calculated from their ratio. Selectivity is measured by the ratio qA/qB = DA/DB. The results in the given table (Table\u00a0 4) revealed that distribution ratios of MR in MR1-MIP were noticeably higher than the distribution ratios of its competitor (CR). Outstanding selectivity coefficient value indicates MR1-MIP is very particular for MR dye removal and the imprinting technique was very effective. Molecular recognition phenomenon may well be comprehended by the selectivity trial of the MR1-MIP. Both MR and CR are structurally in agreement with each other but dissimilar too, the spatial diameter of MR is relatively small than that of CR. There is one carboxylic functional group and one \u2013N (CH3)2 groups in MR, but there are two carboxylic functional groups and two \u2013HN2 groups in CR [67, 73]. The studies declared that functional groups of MR (template) located at the edges of molecules might have favourable interaction with the active binding sites of MR1-MIP and was easily entrapped into the cavities rather than CR (competitor) [73]. MR1-MIP performed well as it was more selective towards its template (MR). The higher distribution ratio of MR is also due to the fact that MR1-MIP\ncan recognize and attach the MR molecules by specific binding sites that have been preserved as a memory [54, 73]. Template (MR) molecules can easily attach to the relatively matched cavities in size and shape, while an interferent can bind poorly due to nonspecific interactions [74]. Moreover, template molecules and interferent have their higher distributions in the MR1-MIP than NIP because NIP is lacking of binding sites."

There was observed a very slight difference in the peak positions and their intensities for the FTIR spectra of different MR-MIP ratios. However, FTIR spectra of unleached MR-MIPs, leached MR-MIPs and NIP, respectively, presented a very closeness in the location of specific peaks, including those characteristic peaks that credited the backbone structure of these developed polymers [75].

Characteristic peak positions in all the spectra attributed the same chemical composition of all the synthesized polymers during polymerization.

The SEM morphological evaluation of the developed polymer in Fig.\u00a0 10A demonstrated that MR1-MIP had regular particle size distributions, giving the materials a high uniformity. The synthesis (precipitation method) of MR1-MIP was executed in the presence of a toluene so as to fabricate a porous structure within the network of the polymer matrix. This porogenic solvent not only assisted the entrapping of the dye molecules within the framework of polymer matrix during synthesis but also facilitated the leaching out of the dye molecules from the MR1-MIP assemblies during washing to fabricate more consistent and effective imprinting sites [59]. The well-shaped and spherical MR1-MIP particles (Fig.\u00a0 10B) with an average diameter of 0.65\u20130.95\u00a0 \u00b5m were achieved. These bigger sized particles have a high tendency to bind with its specific template (MR) that in turn can assist to improve the result in removal efficiency [58].

This suggests that polymer morphology can influence the extraction/removal of the target molecules from any aqueous media [68, 81]. The SEM images of NIP are shown in Fig.\u00a010C.

MIPs adsorption capacity and removal efficiency can be expressed in terms of their respective surface areas and total pore volume; the larger these values are, the greater the impact on working capacity [83, 84]. The results of surface areas, mean pore radius and pore volumes are listed in Table\u00a0 5 for the MR1-MIP/NIP. The produced MR1-MIP was a better sorbent, bearing a three-dimensional network, according to realistic and significant porosimetry data. Toluene (non-polar aprotic solvent) is categorized as good solvent and in general, polymers synthesized in good solvents (non-polar solvents) tend to have higher surface areas than polymers synthesized in poor solvents (polar solvents). Upon imprinting with\nMR dye, there was an increase in the surface area and the pore volume of the imprinted material (MR1-MIP). The higher pore volume and surface area of the MR1MIPs compared to that of the NIP were resulted from the pore sockets and binding sites after the MR has been extracted. The MR1-MIP pore radius corresponds to the\nmacrospore range, which is ideal for MR adsorption from aqueous media, according to IUPAC classification [85]."

            "text": "To compare the potential interactions of imprinted and non-imprinted polymers towards different aqueous media (distilled water, tap water, and river water) with MR as a target analyte. The removal efficiency (% R) of selected MR1-MIP relative to its respective NIP was performed as per the set objective. The tabulated (Table\u00a0 6) results revealed that the MR1-MIP offered considerable higher removal efficiency for MR compared to NIP in all aqueous media. Removal efficiency\nof MR1-MIP is to some extent higher for distilled water media than that of tap and river water. The presence of organic and inorganic stuff in natural water systems might have interfered chemically the selective adsorption of MR and resulting in decline in the selective extraction/removal efficiency [86]. Coordinate covalent bond formation of metal ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+ extant in river water) with the active binding sites of MR1MIP and MR molecules may have led to a decrease in the binding characters [87]. As a result, the removal efficiency of MR1-MIPs in river water is significantly lower than that of tap water. The results depicted that the MR1-MIP exhibited 92.25\u201396.68% removal efficiencies in removing water-soluble MR azo dye from the different water samples, which suggested that MR1MIP has created specific binding sites towards MR dye molecules and showed a strong anti-interference ability in different aqueous media. Moreover, tabulated results substantiated that molecular imprinted polymers have better site accessibility for their respective template molecules than non-imprinted polymers. In order to compare the removal efficiency of MR1-MIP with previously reported adsorbents all the data is listed in Table\u00a07."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "The inclusive objective of this research was to apply an approach at laboratory scale to synthesize MR-MIPs for the selective extraction and removal of MR from aqueous media. Precipitation polymerization method of non-covalent approach provided less laborious format for the synthesis of series of MR-MIPs under milder reactions using water bath with higher yields and easy work up stages. A new experimental series of MR-MIPs with MR as the template and AA as the functional monomer via precipitation polymerization was successfully synthesized by modifying the mole ratio of the components. When compared to other MR-MIPs and NIP from the series, the selected ratio (0.1:1:16 for template, functional monomer, and cross-linking monomer, respectively) of synthesized polymer (MR1MIP) was able to rebind about 99.51% of MR at optimum conditions (contact time 30\u00a0min, polymer dosage 0.4\u00a0g, concentration 15\u00a0ppm, and pH 7). One of the significant findings emerged from this study is that much faster and less laborious MIPs with more than 90% of removal efficiency within 30\u00a0 min were obtained. The results of this study validate the several extraordinary advantages of the water-compatible MR1-MIP to eliminate MR from aqueous media. The removal efficiency toward MR is very high in distilled water, tap water and river water. Moreover, this method also realizes an advantage of using and recycling the previously used MIPs with a good rebinding memory several times in aqueous media.\nAcknowledgements The authors are acknowledging the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/STG04/UNIMAS/02/2) and Universiti Malaysia Sarawak for Providing the necessary research facilities.\nAuthor contributions SRS performed the experiments and interpretation of results, SAB supervised and designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript, SB performed the experiments and interpretation of data, MNMI performed the thermogravimetric analysis and data interpretation, SSS performed the interpretation of data.
