 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate the detection limits and sensitivity of the SPE/NPC sensor for other heavy metal contaminants like mercury, arsenic, etc. in milk powder. Expand the scope of detection.

2. Optimize the NPC modification on the SPE to further improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of the sensor. Experiment with different NPC synthesis methods, compositions, morphologies. 

3. Develop a portable, low-cost electrochemical analyzer tailored for the SPE/NPC sensor to enable rapid on-site detection of heavy metals in milk powder samples.

4. Explore the application of the SPE/NPC sensor for heavy metal detection in other food matrices besides milk powder, such as drinking water, fruit juices, baby food, etc.

5. Conduct toxicity studies by analyzing heavy metal concentrations in milk powder samples from different brands/regions using the SPE/NPC sensor. Correlate with potential health risks especially for infants.
