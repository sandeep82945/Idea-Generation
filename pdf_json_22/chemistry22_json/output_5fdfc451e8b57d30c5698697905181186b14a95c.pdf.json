    "abstractText": "Isothermal amplifications allow for the highly sensitive detection of nucleic acids, bypassing the use of instrumental thermal cycling. This work aimed to carry out an experimental comparison of the four most promising techniques: recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) coupled with lateral flow test or coupled with additional amplification based on CRISPR/Cas12a resulting from the fluorescence of the Cas12a-cleaved probe. To compare the four amplification techniques, we chose the bacterial phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora (causative agent of fire blight), which has a quarantine significance in many countries and possesses a serious threat to agriculture. Three genes were chosen as the targets and primers were selected for each one (two for RPA and six for LAMP). They were functionalized by labels (biotin, fluorescein) at the 5\u2032 ends for amplicons recognition by LFT. As a result, we developed LAMP-LFT, LAMPCRISPR/Cas, RPA-LFT, and RPA-CRISPR/Cas for E. amylovora detection. The detection limit was 104 CFU/mL for LAMP-LFT, 103 CFU/mL for LAMP-CRISPR/Cas, and 102 CFU/mL for RPA-LFT and RPA-CRISPR/Cas. The results of four developed test systems were verified by qPCR on a panel of real samples. The developed assays based on RPA, LAMP, CRISPR/Cas12a, and LFT are rapid (30\u201355 min), user-friendly, and highly sensitive for E. amylovora detection. All proposed detection methods can be applied to fire blight diagnosis and effective management of this disease.",

            "text": "Bacterial plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae, pathovars Ralstonia solanacearum, Erwinia amylovora, et al. threaten the agricultural and food well-being of many countries, causing infectious outbreaks in cultivated agricultural areas, often accompanied by the need for destruction of plants and significant economic losses [1]. Since even a small number of bacterial cells present in plant material can lead to disease, detection methods are needed that detect minimal numbers of bacteria or single cells. The gold standard for the detection of microorganisms is the cultural method, which requires a significant amount of time (from several hours to several days) and a lot of labor-intensive manipulations, whereas the method does not always provide the required selectivity and sensitivity, and some pathogens are not cultivated [2,3]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) significantly reduces detection time and increases sensitivity and specificity of the analysis, which increases the efficiency of detection of bacterial pathogens [4,5]. However, the cyclic temperature changes of the processes\u2014denaturation, annealing, and elongation\u2014makes the PCR dependent on technological laboratory equipment. In addition, PCR enzymes are sensitive to inhibition by matrix components [6,7].\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 1174. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12121174 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 1174 2 of 15\nAn alternative to PCR is isothermal amplification carried out at one temperature, which is based on the replacement of thermocycling steps with enzymes that have strand displacement activity such as Geobacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase, Bacillus subtilis (Bsu) DNA polymerase I, and phi29 DNA polymerase [8\u201310]. More than ten types of isothermal amplification are known. The most common and promising are recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [11] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [12]. Both amplification methods can be carried out at one temperature (LAMP~60 \u25e6C, RPA~37 \u25e6C) in 10\u201360 min depending on the recognized sequence and the type of amplification. Biosensors based on both amplifications are actively used to detect pathogenic microorganisms affecting food products and cultivated plants [13\u201315]. Another tool to improve DNA-target detection is the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas (CRISPR associated protein) system. This system of bacterial adaptive immunity is actively used for in vitro diagnostics. Cas endonuclease in complex with guide RNA (gRNA) recognizes the target DNA (or RNA) in the sample by checking its sequence with the gRNA. Thus, due to gRNA corresponding to the pathogen target DNA sequence, CRISPR/Cas can be programmed to recognize the genetic target with high specificity. After target recognition, some class of CRISPR/Cas complex (e.g., Cas12a) acquires the ability to repeatedly cleave (trans-cleavage) any single-stranded (ss) nucleic acid; for example, Cas12a endonuclease is characterized by DNase activity [16]. In 2018, Chen et al. proposed the DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter), which is based on Cas12a for highly sensitive and specific detection of doublestranded (ds) DNA targets [17]. The DETECTR is based on the use of several reactions: target DNA amplification, recognition of amplified DNA targets by gRNA/Cas12a, transcleavage of ssDNA probe with an activated Cas12a in complex with target DNA, and detection of a cleaved probe. Over the past 5 years, Cas endonucleases have proven to be effective in detecting DNA and RNA targets with high selectivity [18]. The use of the CRISPR/Cas system in biosensors without additional amplifications is rather an exception since a high concentration of the target DNA (or RNA) is required to activate the Cas trans-nuclease activity. Such examples are described in detail in the review [19]; however, most designs use a combination of isothermal amplification such as RPA, LAMP, and others with CRISPR/Cas, for which extremely high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved as a result. Thus, for the highly sensitive detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, the RPA\u2013CRISPR/Cas12 system was developed [20], and LAMP\u2013 CRISPR/Cas [21]; for Salmonella spp.\u2013RPA\u2013CRISPR/Cas13 [22] and for Campylobacter jejuni\u2013 RPA\u2013CRISPR/Cas12a [23]. Thus, biosensor systems based on isothermal amplifications and CRISPR/Cas are promising candidates for ultrasensitive detection of bacterial pathogens, which is confirmed by several review articles [24,25], and for the development of nonlaboratory biosensor systems based on them [26,27]. The advantage of biosensors based on isothermal amplification is not only highly sensitive with specificity detection, but also carries the opportunity to use simple and low-cost tools (lateral flow test (LFT), fluorescent detector) for rapid detection [28,29]. Fluorescent dyes, pH-dependent dyes, and LFTs are among the most common amplicon detection techniques. The most preferred dyes are those that are added before the reaction. This action prevents contamination because opening the tube with amplicons is excluded. pH-dependent dyes such as hydroxynaphthol blue, phenol red, cresol red, neutral red, and m-cresol purple, are successfully applied in this way and lead to end-point naked-eye visual detection of the assay results [30,31]. However, these dyes are applicable only for LAMP and unsuitable for RPA. Furthermore, widespread reagents for closed-tube detection are fluorescent dyes such as Mn2+ quenched calcein [32] and intercalating fluorescent dyes such as SYTO 9, SYTO 82, etc., which are optimal for real-time fluorescence detection with minimal inhibition of amplification [33,34]. For RPA, only SYBR Green and Eva Green are described as the used intercalating dyes; they are applied only as open-tube dyes, i.e., with contamination risks. Moreover, SYBR Green type dyes show greater inhibitory effects compared to SYTO dyes [33\u201335]. Thus, among fluorescent and pH-dependent dyes, a\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 1174 3 of 15\nsingle one with equally confirmed versatility and effectiveness both for LAMP and RPA cannot be chosen. LFTs, as well as intercalating dyes, are applied after a reaction and are associated with risks of contamination. But otherwise, LFT is a simple and user-friendly tool that allows the interpretation of the results of the analysis quickly and unambiguously and does not require special equipment [36,37]. Moreover, in the study, the LFT detection provided the most identical conditions for the detection of amplicons obtained as a result of RPA and LAMP while observing additional measures to prevent contamination. For the detection of amplicons labeled with fluorescein and biotin, there are commercially available universal test strips that can be suitable for detection after RPA or LAMP. After the test strip is immersed in the sample, the amplicons move along the membrane under the action of capillary forces and are specifically recognized (streptavidin-biotin, fluorescein\u2013antibody specific to fluorescein), resulting in staining in the test and control zones, which could be visually equipment-free estimated. The whole process takes approximately 10\u201315 min. Thus, the four main analytical techniques based on isothermal amplifications that are used for the rapid and sensitive detection of bacterial plant pathogens can be named: RPA-LFT, LAMP-LFT, RPA-CRISPR/Cas with fluorescence detection, and LAMP-CRISPR/Cas with fluorescence detection. However, we did not find any experimental comparison of these four techniques performed simultaneously on the same analyte. In this work, the four test systems were developed for one analyte and comparison of the effectiveness of each was carried out. Four schemes of comparable analytical techniques are shown in Figure 1.

Each gene is presented as a single copy in the genome. Moreover, we evaluated the probability of alternative DNA forms (Z-DNA, G-quadruplex, etc.) or rare local conformational elements (hairpin, loops with unpaired nucleotides, etc.) in these genes (the features of target genes are presented in Table S3). The genes tend to have no non-canonic structures. The selected gene targets for LAMP and RPA have different lengths and GC content. However, the mechanism of two amplifications is so different that even within the same gene it is impossible for RPA and LAMP to obtain the same amplicons [49]; therefore, given the same copy number and proven efficiency of primers, different gene localization is not a significant factor. DNA fragments of target genes 1\u20133 were obtained from E. amylovora CFBP 1430 using the PCR primers shown in Table S2 and purified after agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure S2). Using the obtained fragments as templates, LAMP and RPA were tested. To implement LAMP, we used six primers previously proposed in the work [42]; forward inner primer (FIP), backward inner primer (BIP), forward outer primer (F3), and backward outer primer (B3) were required for the reaction to proceed, and two loop primers (forward loop primer (FL) and backward loop primer (BL)) were able to improve the amplification efficiency. To carry out LAMP with the selected set of primers, we used a temperature of 65 \u25e6C for 30 min, which was previously selected by B\u00fchlmann et al. [42]. As a result, LAMP with electrophoretic detection showed a sensitivity equal to 100 copies in the reaction (Figure 2A). A sharp change in the amount of the resulting amplification product indicates a narrow range of quantitatively recognizable concentrations. Thus, the visualization of LAMP products in agarose gel suggests rather a qualitative assessment. After confirmation of the amplicon formation with the selected primers, primers with FAM or biotin labels were obtained, which were necessary for the detection of amplicons by LFT. In LAMP, FAM and biotin can be introduced into the amplicons using four types of labeled primers (FIP, BIP, FL, BL).

This strategy reduces the number of labeled primers on the test strip that compete with the labeled amplicons. All possible primer/label combinations were tested using 104 copies per reaction as the concentration to produce a large number of amplicons. The test strip recognized FAM/biotin-labeled amplicons due to streptavidin in the test zone, protein A in the control zone, and a conjugate of gold nanoparticles with antibodies specific to FAM (see Figure 1C). As a result, BL-primer labeled with FAM and BIP primer labeled with biotin provided the maximum signal during the detection of amplicons by LFT (Figure 2B); for the other combinations, the coloration of the test zone was either absent or manifested much weaker. Accordingly, the combination of labeled primers (BL-FAM, BIP-biotin) can be further used to test LAMP-LFT on total bacterial DNA samples, artificially contaminated extracts of plant samples, healthy and naturally infected samples.

RPA with electrophoretic detection showed a sensitivity equal to 10 (gene-2, Figure 3A) and 100 copies (gene-3, Figure 3B) in the reaction. However, for gene-2, in addition to the target product, reaction by-products were visualized by electrophoresis (Figure 3A). The test strips used the same assembly as for the detection of amplicons after LAMP (see Figure 1A,C). As a result, the sensitivity of RPA-LFT was 100 copies per reaction for both genes (Figure 3C). These values correspond to the sensitivity of PCR performed for the same genes (Figure 3D). Figure 3B shows that the signal differs from the background starting from 100 copies (negative control corresponded to 35 cycles). As in the case with LAMP, a rather sharp increase in the signal was observed when moving to higher concentrations. At the same time, for gene-3, more intense coloration of the test zone was observed for all tested concentrations than for the gene-2. Accordingly, primers for the amplification of gene-3 were chosen for further experiments.\nFigure 3. Results of amplification of the DNA fragments of gene-2 and gene-3.

Guide RNAs were designed based on target-gene sequences with two main conditions: neighboring position to protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which was firstly identified in the DNA target by CRISPR/Cas12a, and did not include the primer zone (see details in Table S2, ESM). The gRNAs synthesized by reverse transcription were used to obtain a complex with Cas12a. As a result, for all amplification techniques, there was no signal for negative samples and concentration dependences were observed (Figure 4). Using the three-sigma method, cut-off values were set for the RPA-CRISPR/Cas (3.18 rel. units) and LAMP-CRISPR/Cas (0.34 rel. units) to determine positive samples (for RPA-LFT and LAMP-LFT, cut-off values accorded to minimal coloration for reliable visual detection and were equal to 2 arb. units for both cases). The results presented in Figure 4 show that the limit of detection was 100 CFU/reaction (reaction volume 10 \u00b5L) or 1 \u00d7 104 CFU/mL for LAMPLFT, 10 CFU/reaction or 1 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL for LAMP-CRISPR/Cas, 1 CFU/reaction for gene-3 (reaction volume 10 \u00b5L) or 100 CFU/mL for RPA-LFT, and 1 CFU/reaction for gene3 or 100 CFU/mL for RPA-CRISPR/Cas. Therefore, for both schemes with PRA, extremely high sensitivity was shown. For RPA-CRISPR/Cas, the signal for 1 CFU/reaction was only approx. 40% below the maximum, and for RPA-LFT, it was approx. 72% below the maximum. If the sensitivity of the isothermal amplification assay provides the detection of single cells (RPA-LFT), then the addition of extra amplification of CRISPR/Cas did not change the detection limit but increased the difference between the detected signal and the background. If the sensitivity of the assay did not correspond to single cells (LAMP-LFT), then the detection limit can be reduced by adding additional amplification of CRISPR/Cas. Only one article describes the scheme using RPA for the detection of E. amylovoraRPA-CRISPR/Cas with a FAM-BHQ probe [51]. The authors used phosphoribosyl transferase as the target gene and showed a detection limit of 103 CFU/mL. The limit of detection for PCR diagnostics based on the same gene-3 and the same but shortened primers was 1 \u00d7 103 CFU/mL [52]. Two systems have been published for LAMP, both with fluorescent detection and a detection limit of (1) 10 CFU/reaction or the equivalent of 1.2 \u00d7 104 CFU/mL for detection of the same phosphoribosyl transferase target gene [42], and (2) 10 CFU/reaction or 104 CFU/mL for histidine-tRNA ligase gene detection (EAMY_RS32025) [53]. However, in the article comparing LAMP and PCR [52], LAMP-based primers from [53] and qPCR assays showed high specificity for E. amylovora and were able to detect up to \u00d7103 CFU/mL. Regarding immunoassays [41,51], all test systems based on isothermal amplifications turned out to be expectedly more sensitive, by 2\u20134 orders of magnitude depending on the type of test system. Obviously, not for all target genes and not for all bacterial pathogens, the limit of detection in RPA-LFT and RPA-CRISPR/Cas is equal to single cells. This result depends on many factors, including the representation of the selected gene in cells. The results indicate that, in terms of sensitivity, the addition of a CRISPR/Cas stage is not always required, and may complicate (add new components) and affect the duration of (additional 20 min) the analysis, without leading to a decrease in the detection limit. However, for the scheme with LAMP, we note the justification for using the CRISPR/Cas stage. The uniqueness of the selected DNA fragments was shown earlier based on bioinformatics analysis, as well as the high specificity of the detection of E. amylovora by PCR and LAMP [42\u201344]. However, to confirm this, we tested several common bacterial pathogens D. solani, P. atrosepticum, C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, and R. solanacearum.

Conclusions Three new diagnostic test systems have been developed for the detection of E. amylovora: LAMP-LFT, LAMP-CRISPR/Cas, RPA-LFT, and the test system of the RPACRISPR/Cas, which was first proposed for the unannotated gene of the hypothetical AMY1267 protein.

Comparison of RPA and LAMP followed by amplicon detection with LFT and CRISPR/Cas with fluorescence detection showed that LAMP-CRISPR/Cas was superior in sensitivity to LAMP-LFT, RPA-LFT, and RPACRISPR/Cas, which detected single cells in the reaction and was superior in sensitivity to LAMP-CRISPR/Cas. The developed RPA-LFT and RPA-CRISPR/Cas demonstrated the lowest detection limit for E. amylovora relative to previously published test systems. Thus, we have shown that the inclusion of additional CRISPR/Cas amplification in the assay\nFigure 5.

In addition, RPA-CRISPR/Cas identified sample #6 as strongly positive. However, this result has not been confirmed by any other method and we assume that was a false positive due to contamination. In total, RPA-LFT, LAMP-LFT, RPA-CRISPR/Cas, and LAMP-CRIPSR/Cas were in full agreement for positive samples determined by PCR with Ct > 33. Weakly positive samples with Ct > 33 most successfully confirmed the RPA-based test systems. To evaluate the correlation of the obtained results, we carried out the Spearman correlation for data presented in Figure 5 and calculated Spearman correlation coefficients (rs). The correlations of qPCR data with f ur developed methods were negative and high (rs <\u22120.75) or moderate (\u22120.75 < rs <\u22120.5); the Spearman correlation coefficients a presented in Figure S4. Betwe n the four developed methods,\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 1174 12 of 15\nthe correlation analysis showed a high (rs > 0.75) or moderate (0.5 < rs < 0.75) positive correlation. When comparing methods, it is important that, unlike PCR, RPA-LFT and RPA-CRISPR/Cas are much faster to implement (30 and 45 min, respectively), do not require complex equipment such as a thermal cycler, and a 37 \u25e6C heater (RPA-LFT, RPACRISPR/Cas) and a simple fluorescent detector (RPA-CRISPR/Cas) are enough. For LAMP-LFT and LAMP-CRISPR/Cas, the analysis time was 40 and 55 min, respectively; a 37 and 60 \u25e6C heaters (LAMP-LFT, LAMP-CRISPR/Cas) and a simple fluorescent detector (LAMP-CRISPR/Cas) were required. In addition, it is important to consider that LAMPLFT or LAMP-CRISPR/Cas, with the detection method involving open-tubes techniques, very often provide false positive results caused by carryover contamination [54,55]. This shortcoming can be prevented by implementing closed-tube detection devices or carefully separated places for sample preparation and for analysis [56\u201358]. Therefore, the comparison showed the advantages of RPA-based strategies for E. amylovora detection, which allows for a recommendation of RPA-based methods to rapidly and conveniently monitor fire blight-infected plants. The additional potential of the RPA-LFT and PRA-CRISPR/Cas systems is the ability to carry out amplification directly in the sample without preliminary extraction of total DNA. This is confirmed in several works on the diagnosis of plant pathogens, including the diagnosis of E. amylovora [51,59]. In this work, the approach without sample extraction was not tested in order to be able to compare the same DNA samples by both PCR and isothermal test systems."

The isothermal amplification can be sufficient to provide high sensitivity and specificity. In this regard, the development of double detection systems such as RPA-CRISPR/Cas and LAMP-CRISPR/Cas in the absence of direct experimental verification of the system with only one amplification solution does not seem to be a rational solution. The testing of the four developed test systems on real samples showed that all the proposed detection methods can be applied to the fire blight diagnosis and effective management to prevent the damage to agricultural crops. All proposed test systems were able to detect E. amylovora in plants with and without symptoms of the disease.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bios12121174/s1, Table S1.
