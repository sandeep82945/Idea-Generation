1. **Investigate the effectiveness of drug-sniffing dogs in deterring contraband substance use in inpatient concurrent disorders programs.** This could be done through a randomized controlled trial comparing the rates of contraband substance use in units that use drug-sniffing dogs to those that do not.


2. **Examine the impact of contraband substance use on patient outcomes in inpatient concurrent disorders programs.** This could be done through a longitudinal study that follows patients over time to assess the relationship between contraband substance use and outcomes such as length of stay, treatment completion, and relapse rates.


3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to reduce contraband substance use in inpatient concurrent disorders programs.** This could include interventions such as patient education, counseling, and contingency management.


4. **Explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a system of escalating consequences for patients who repeatedly use contraband substances in inpatient concurrent disorders programs.** This could involve a qualitative study to interview patients and staff about their experiences with such a system.


5. **Investigate the relationship between contraband substance use and other forms of patient misconduct in inpatient concurrent disorders programs.** This could be done through a retrospective chart review or a prospective cohort study.
