Although this technique has many advantages, it does not allow for continuous automated random-access testing or the possibility to perform on-demand testing avoiding run series. In this sense, the Hologic Aptima transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay running on the Panther system (Hologic) was presented as a very good option since, in addition to having this characteristic of continuous loading of reagents and specimens during the process, it is also easy to use and fast, being able to perform a high number of determinations in one day (up to 60 per hour), which is a limiting factor for other diagnostic techniques [4].\nDuring the multiple waves of COVID-19 suffered all over the world, having a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test has become a priority for microbiology laboratories. The AptimaTM SARS-CoV-2 transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay running on the Panther system (Hologic) was presented as a very good option to cover this need. To evaluate this system, 570 respiratory samples were included in the study and were processed both by the Panther (Hologic) system and by qRTPCR (Thermo Fisher Science, Waltham, USA), current assay for the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The remaining 76 samples (15.2%) were clearly negative by qPCR. Some of the non-concordant results (16 of 76) were repeated again by both techniques obtaining in all cases the same result as initially, and all samples retested by Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARSCoV-2, showed 100% agreement with the qRT-PCR.\nWhen the positive samples were divided according to the Panther RLUs, it can be seen that the percentage of false positives decreased as RLUs increased as well as the positive percent agreement (PPA) increase. The percentage of false positives goes from 80,55%, in the range >500- <1000 RLUs, to only 8,85% when the RLU value is greater than 1200.\nThe sensitivity was very high, 100% in all RLU ranges, but the global specificity was very low, 47,9%. However, since the number of negative samples included is much lower than the number of positives, this last data may be biased.\nAlthough there was not a clear correlation between the RLU and Ct values, since there were high Ct values (Ct >40) in all RLU ranges, it can be seen that the lowest RLU values were associated with higher Ct ranges."

The efficacy of the technique has already been demonstrated, although it is true that a previous study by our group [10] showed that the sensitivity of Hologic Panther Aptima assay is lower than TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR.\nHowever, in all these previous studies samples were selected by qPCR results and later on analysed by Aptima assay. The approach of the present study was just the opposite and the selection of specimens\u2019 was made based on the results of Aptima to later perform the analysis by qPCR.\nThe results showed and excellent sensitivity and negative\nHowever, TMA tests have the disadvantage of not providing any type of semiquantitative result since there is no evidence of any relationship between the viral load of the samples and the units of measurement of the system (RLU). As healthcare workers often require an estimate of viral load to decide on patient management, samples with a positive result by this system (TMA) were retested by qRT-PCR in order to obtain Ct value and use it for clinical decision making. Some negative ones were also retested by qRT-PCR.\nThe results obtained were analyzed to determine the sensitivity of the Panther device and to check if any type of correlation could be established between the Ct obtained by qRT-PCR and the units of measure used by the Panther (RLU)."

However, the specificity improved when samples with the lowest RLU values were discarded.\nOther comparator studies showed similar values of sensitivity but higher PPA values [7, 8, 9]. The differences are probably due to the dissimilar way of sample selection. The inclusion in the comparative studies of only positive samples by qPCR does not allow the detection of false positives by Hologic since all specimens are true positives.\nSome of the false positives corresponded to samples from patients with previous positives who had recently become negative. So, there is a possibility that what the Hologic system detected is some viral residue with no clinical value. Nevertheless, since this was not the case in all samples, there must be other factors responsible for the false positives detected.\nIn conclusion, analytical validation of this study shows that the Aptima assay can be a very good tool for screening samples. This system is fast, easy to use and get ability to continuously load reagents and samples during the process; it is also able to discriminate true negative samples. However it would be recommendable to check positive results by a different technique, especially those with RLU values below 1000."
