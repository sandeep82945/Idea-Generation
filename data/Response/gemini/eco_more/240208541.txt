1. **Convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with non-convex costs.** The paper assumes that the cost functions are convex, but this assumption is not always satisfied in real-world applications. It would be interesting to investigate the convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with non-convex cost functions.
2. **Convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with heterogeneous agents.** The paper assumes that the agents are homogeneous, but this assumption is not always satisfied in real-world applications. It would be interesting to investigate the convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with heterogeneous agents.
3. **Convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with incomplete information.** The paper assumes that the agents have complete information about the cost functions of the other agents, but this assumption is not always satisfied in real-world applications. It would be interesting to investigate the convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with incomplete information.
4. **Convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with noise.** The paper assumes that the agents' actions are deterministic, but this assumption is not always satisfied in real-world applications. It would be interesting to investigate the convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with noise.
5. **Convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with multiple rounds.** The paper assumes that the Tullock contest is a one-shot game, but this assumption is not always satisfied in real-world applications. It would be interesting to investigate the convergence of BR dynamics in Tullock contests with multiple rounds.
