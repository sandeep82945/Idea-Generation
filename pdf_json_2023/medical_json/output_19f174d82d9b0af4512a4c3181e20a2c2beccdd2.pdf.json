    "abstractText": "Crops are constantly challenged by different environmental conditions. Seed treatment by nanomaterials is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution for environmental stress mitigation in crop plants. Here, 56 seed nanopriming treatments are used to alleviate environmental stresses in maize. Seven selected nanopriming treatments significantly increase the stress resistance index (SRI) by 13.9% and 12.6% under salinity stress and combined heat-drought stress, respectively. Metabolomics data reveals that ZnO nanopriming treatment, with the highest SRI value, mainly regulates the pathways of amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolite synthesis,",

            "text": "Crops are constantly challenged by different environmental conditions. Seed treatment by nanomaterials is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution for environmental stress mitigation in crop plants. Here, 56 seed nanopriming treatments are used to alleviate environmental stresses in maize. Seven selected nanopriming treatments significantly increase the stress resistance index (SRI) by 13.9% and 12.6% under salinity stress and combined heat-drought stress, respectively. Metabolomics data reveals that ZnO nanopriming treatment, with the highest SRI value, mainly regulates the pathways of amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolite synthesis,\ncarbohydrate metabolism, and translation. Understanding the mechanism of seed nanopriming is still difficult due to the variety of nanomaterials and the complexity of interactions between nanomaterials and plants. Using the nanopriming data, we present an interpretable structureactivity relationship (ISAR) approach based on interpretable machine learning for predicting and understanding its stress mitigation effects. The post hoc and model-based interpretation approaches of machine learning are combined to provide complementary benefits and give researchers or policymakers more illuminating or trustworthy results. The concentration, size, and zeta potential of nanoparticles are identified as dominant factors for correlating root dry weight under salinity stress, and their effects and interactions are explained. Additionally, a web-based interactive tool is developed for offering prediction-level interpretation and gathering more details about specific nanopriming treatments. This work offers a promising framework for accelerating the agricultural applications of nanomaterials and may profoundly contribute to nanosafety assessment.\nKeywords: environmental stress, metal oxide nanomaterials, seed nanopriming, machine learning, model interpretation"

            "text": "Crops are constantly challenged by different environmental conditions, such as drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures (Ahuja et al., 2010; Ioannou et al., 2020). Various field applications of nanoparticles were tested to mitigate environmental stresses (Kah et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020), such as drought stress in maize (Cu nanoparticles) (Van Nguyen et al., 2022), high-temperature stress in grain sorghum (Se nanoparticles) (Djanaguiraman et al., 2018), and salinity stress in broad bean (TiO2 nanoparticles) (Abdel Latef et al., 2018). Compared with traditional analogs, it was estimated that the median efficiency of nanoagrochemicals increased by ~20-30% (Kah et al., 2018). Seed priming by nanomaterials is a novel approach that is cost-effective and environmentally-friendly due to the lower amount of nanomaterials and minimized environmental exposure compared to field applications (De La Torre-Roche et al., 2020; Hofmann et al., 2020). Seed nanopriming could stimulate the growth of crop plants under environmental stresses by\nincreasing photosynthetic pigments levels (Abdel Latef et al., 2017), enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities (Shah et al., 2021), reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Rai-Kalal et al., 2021), and regulating the H2O2 signaling network (Rai-Kalal et al., 2021). Although most current nanopriming studies, to the best of our knowledge, focus only on single environmental stress (Hussain et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2020; Rizwan et al., 2019), we hypothesized that seed nanopriming might have great potential to alleviate multiple environmental stresses due to several underlying common mechanisms.\nQuantitative/qualitative structure-activity (QSAR) relationships are well-established computational approaches for chemical design and early hazard warnings (Muratov et al., 2020; Nongonierma et al., 2018). Machine learning, suitable for addressing ill-defined problems where nonlinearities and interactions exist, is employed to establish relationships between descriptors and a target. The interpretation of good-performance models, however, is challenging for extracting information and building trust. Interpretable machine learning receives increasing attention due to its ability to provide insight into what a model has learned, whose interpretation techniques could be organized into model-based and post hoc categories (Murdoch et al., 2019). Model-based interpretation usually is generated by simple and interpretable models, which may result in lower prediction accuracy. It is worth noting that few self-interpretable models could achieve acceptable performance but with unintuitive model interpretation, such as a large tree depth in the decision tree model and numerous decision rules in the RuleFit algorithm. Post hoc interpretation methods are conducted to describe the learned relationships by trained models instead of changing the models, which may be based on sophisticated models with good performance. Many post hoc interpretation methods, however, are relatively new, with much of questions to be answered. Moreover, it is challenging to determine which method could fully capture a model\u2019s behavior. The integration of different interpretation methods is therefore preferred, including the integration of different methods for one interpretation task and the integration of model-based and post hoc interpretation.\nIn this study, a variety of metalloid and metal oxide nanoparticles (SiO2, CeO2, CuO, Fe3O4, ZnO,\n\u03b1-Fe2O3, and \u03b3-Fe2O3 of different sizes) were used as priming agents with different concentrations for alleviating environmental stress in maize; maize is chosen due to the fact that it is one of the most important staple crops. Salinity, drought, and heat stresses are major constraints to maize yield production (Yuan et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2017). Besides, oxide nanoparticles are among the widest-used manufactured nanomaterials (Chavali and Nikolova, 2019; Tsugita et al., 2017), and they can be acquired at a relatively little cost which is very important for agricultural use. A total of fourteen oxide nanomaterials were tested with different concentrations. Eleven biological endpoints were collected for investigating the effects of seed nanopriming on germination under salinity stress. Then, the treatments with good performance were selected to further investigate their effects under combined heat-drought stress. Metabolomics analysis was used to study small-molecule metabolites and provide insight into the mechanisms of seed nanopriming for stress mitigation. Furthermore, using the seed nanopriming data under salinity stress, we presented an interpretable structure-activity relationship (ISAR) approach based on the integration of machine learning interpretation methods to identify important factors and show how they affect the stress mitigation effects. Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), RuleFit, and decision tree models were established as complex and self-interpretable models for providing post hoc and model-based interpretation. Moreover, we deployed the established models and their local interpretation in an online interactive website where interested readers could learn more about the specific nanopriming treatment (or a customized treatment) based on the prediction-level interpretation."

The used nutrient solutions used on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th day contained 150 mM NaCl for salinity stress. Three replicates were applied for each treatment. The square pots were placed in a climate chamber with a 14-10h photoperiod (26/22\u00b0C day/night temperature, 60% relative humidity, 45,000 lx light intensity), and their positions were changed every day.\nThe treatments with better performance in mitigating effects under salinity stress were selected to investigate their effects under combined heat-drought stress. The sowing and nutrient solution use were consistent with salinity stress but without NaCl treatment. After four-day cultivation, the parameters of the climate chamber were changed to 40/32\u00b0C day/night temperature and 50% relative humidity. Although the amount of daily watering was not changed, the plants faced drought stress due to increased evaporation of water. After another three days, the plants were harvested and the values of eleven biological endpoints were collected."

An overview of the used dataset and the prediction target (root dry weight) is shown in Table S1 and Fig. S2, and the dataset is given in Supplementary dataset S1. Root dry weight was divided into two categories in equal quantities (0 for low level and 1 for high level). Two features (TEM size SD and PdI) were removed due to the high correlation (Fig. S3).\nThe LightGBM model was employed as a complex model since it is an effective and highly scalable algorithm and can handle categorical features directly. Nonetheless, label encoding is used to encode categorical features for the need of some interpretation methods. Python and two machine learning packages (LightGBM and scikit-learn) were used for classification modeling. The version of the main software and packages used are given in Table S2. The workflow for the establishment of the LightGBM models is shown in Fig. S4. The dataset was split into a training set (75%) and a test set (25%) using the stratified shuffle split method. Grid search and 5-fold CV were used to determine model hyperparameters based on the training set (Table S3). The datasets were randomly split into the training set and test set ten times to evaluate model stability. The average AUROC, F1 score (weighted), and accuracy on the 5-fold CV on the training set and the AUROC, F1 score (weighted), and accuracy on the training set and test set were used to determine the model performance.\nModel interpretation workflow, post hoc interpretation, and model-based interpretation were conducted following procedures described in our previous studies with some adjustments (Yu et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). Briefly, Different LightGBM models were established based on ten dataset splits, and LightGBM importance, permutation importance, and SHAP importance were employed to identify important features for ten models. Their average feature importance rank was used to identify the most relevant features for correlating the root dry weight. A model with feature importance consistent with average importance and better model performance was selected for further post hoc interpretation. Partial dependence plot (PDP), individual conditional expectation (ICE), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed for the visualization of the feature effects, and the measurement and visualization of feature interactions were achieved by SHAP interaction. Then, the important features identified by post hoc interpretation of the LightGBM model were used for the establishment of self-interpretable models, including decision tree and RuleFit models, which could provide model-based interpretation.

The stress resistance index (SRI) was developed to quantitatively\nassess the stress tolerance of nanopriming treatments by combining ten physiological parameters of seedlings (Fig. 1A). The average SRI values of seed nanopriming by fourteen types of nanoparticles were higher than that in the control (SRI = 10.0). Among them, the treatments with ZnO (30 nm), ZnO (50 nm), CeO2 (20-50 nm), and SiO2 (50 nm) nanoparticles had the highest average SRI values. For specific nanopriming treatment, the ZnO nanopriming (30 nm at 200 mg/L) had the best result. The readers can get more information about each nanopriming treatment in Fig. 1A.\ngroups and the control under salinity stress.

J, The comparison of eleven biological endpoints between selected nanopriming treatments and the control under combined heat-drought stresses. K,L, The comparison of biological endpoints among selected treatments under combined heat-drought stresses.\nThe 56 nanopriming treatments were divided into three groups based on the SRI values under salinity stress (Table S4), including the High group (SRI\u226511), the Middle group (10.5\u2264SRI<11), and the Low group (SRI<10.5) corresponding to 7, 16, and 33 treatments, respectively. The seven nanopriming treatments in the High group increased the SRI values by 13.9% on average compared with the control. The average values of all endpoints in the High and Middle groups were higher than those in the control (Fig. 1B). There were significant differences (p<0.05) in all endpoints between the treatments in the High group and the control; in the Middle group, there were significant differences in five endpoints (including chlorophyll content, root fresh weight, root dry weight, root:shoot ratio, and shoot length) compared with the control (Fig. 1C-F and Fig. S5).\nUnder salinity stress, root dry weight was the largest improvement of endpoints in the High and Middle groups after seed nanopriming with an increase of 26.7% and 18.7% on average, respectively (Fig. 1B). Root:shoot ratio was the only endpoint that the average value in the Middle group was higher than that in the High group but without significant difference due to the much lower improvement in shoot dry weight in the Middle group. Furthermore, the increase in the root dry weight was significantly higher than that in the stem and leaf dry weight in all nanopriming groups (Fig. 1G).\nAll the average values of eleven biological endpoints in selected nanopriming treatments were higher than those in the control under salinity stress (Fig. 1H,I and Fig. S6). The treatment of CeO2 (<100 nm and 200 mg/L) was significantly higher than the control in eight biological endpoints. Although the treatment of ZnO (30 nm at 200 mg/L) had the highest SRI value and its average values were higher than the treatment of CeO2 (<100 nm and 200 mg/L) in ten biological endpoints,\nit was only significantly higher than the control in five biological endpoints because of the large SD in other biological endpoints data.\nWe selected seven nanopriming treatments in the High group under salinity stress to study their effects under the combined heat-drought stress and to explore the potential of seed nanopriming for the alleviation of a variety of environmental stresses. All median values of biological endpoints of selected nanopriming treatments were higher than the control (Fig. 1J). Furthermore, there were significant differences in nine biological endpoints between the selected treatments and the control except for chlorophyll content and root:shoot ratio. For example, the selected treatments increased the SRI by 12.6% on average. The treatment with the highest SRI under salinity stress, ZnO (30 nm at 200 mg/L) nanopriming, also had the best result under combined heat-drought stress (Fig. 1K). This treatment significantly increased ten biological endpoints, such as SRI (39.8%) and root dry weight (86.4%) (Fig. 1K,L and Fig. S7).

An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics was used to determine the metabolic responses of the best nanopriming treatment, ZnO nanopriming (30 nm at 200 mg/L), under salinity stress and combined heat-drought stress in both positive and negative ion modes. A total of 1204 metabolites were identified, such as lipids and lipid-like molecules (24.92%), phenylpropanoids and polyketides (16.20%), organoheterocyclic compounds (11.46%), benzenoids (9.22%), organic acids and derivatives (8.47%), and organic oxygen compounds (6.40%) (Fig. S8). The ZnO nanopriming treatment under salinity was termed SN, while the control was termed SC; the nanopriming treatment under combined heat-drought stress was termed HdN, while the control was termed HdC. A supervised partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed, and score plots indicated that nanopriming\ntreatments (SN and HdN) were clearly separated from their control groups (Fig. S9). The 7-fold cross-validation (CV) results indicated that the models were stable and reliable (Table S5).\nBased on the variable importance in the projection (VIP) value of each variable in the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model (VIP > 1) and the p value of Student's t-test (p < 0.05), 46 differential metabolites were selected under salinity stress (Fig. 2A and Supplementary dataset S2), of which 35 metabolites were up-regulated and 11 metabolites were down-regulated (Fig. S10). The important metabolic pathways were further analyzed using KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway maps. In salinity stress, significant differences between SN and SC were observed in tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites - part 2, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism (Fig. 2B and Fig. S11). All the metabolites involved in the differentially enriched pathways were up-regulated, such as anthranilic acid and tryptophan. Under combined heat-drought stress, of 61 differential metabolites (Fig. 2C and Supplementary dataset S3), 44 metabolites were up-regulated while 17 metabolites were down-regulated (Fig. S12). Other significant differences between HdN and HdC (Fig. 2D and Fig. S13) were also evident in the pathways of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, beta-Alanine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, ABC transporters, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Although over two-thirds of the differential metabolites were up-regulated (such as benzenoids and organic oxygen compounds), most of the metabolites involved in differential metabolic pathways were down-regulated, such as asparagine, valine, histidine, and pantothenic acid."

The post hoc interpretation of the LightGBM model was conducted to identify important features and show how they affect model output, such as permutation importance, PDP, ICE, and SHAP. Then self-interpretable models (decision tree and RuleFit) were established after the simplification of the problem based on the extracted information from the post hoc interpretation.

The effect of zeta potential generally followed a decreasing trend. Two-dimensional PDP showed the combined effects of two features (Fig. 4G-I), similar to the individual effects as the main effects played a major role, which may be used as clues for the custom classification tree.

            "text": "The important features identified by post hoc interpretation of LightGBM models were used for decision tree and RuleFit modeling to simplify the problem. The AUROC scores on the test set for the decision tree and RuleFit models based on the fifth dataset split were 0.82 and 0.81 respectively (Fig. S18), which were no less than that in the LightGBM model (0.80). The decision tree is one of the easiest and most popular classification algorithms, which provides contrastive and easy-tounderstand explanations by comparing an instance with decision nodes. The first leaf node was derived from the first decision node: if the zeta potential was less than -25.835 mV, 11 out of 13 instances were classified into the high level in root dry weight (Fig. S19), which was consistent with Fig. 4C,F. Besides, the second leaf node was the combined statement of TEM size and zeta potential: if the zeta potential was less than -25.835 mV and the TEM size was over 113.04 nm, eight of ten instances were classified into the high level in root dry weight, which was consistent with Fig. 4I. The RuleFit algorithm is the combination of the tree ensemble model and the sparse linear model. Therefore, it has a strong interpretation and usually performs well on complex problems. The most important rule was the conjoint statement of concentration and zeta potential (Table S6): if the concentration was more than 37.5 mg/L and less than 75 mg/L and the zeta potential was less than 5.565 mV, there was a step increase of 2.2548 for root dry weight, which was consistent with their PDP combined effects (Fig. 4H). Besides, the second important rule was consistent with the PDP combined effects between concentration and TEM size (Fig. 4G). However, it was hard to explain the overall effects of one feature in the decision tree and RuleFit models because most leaf nodes went through many decision nodes and the effects of concentration in the RuleFit model were distributed among 29 rules in 38 rules.\nPost hoc interpretation was therefore employed to interpret the decision tree model intuitively (Fig. 5). The effect of concentration was consistent with that in the LightGBM model, but the effects of TEM size and zeta potential had some changes. This may be due to the following reasons: (i) the lack of smoothness in the decision tree algorithm; (ii) the limited feature combinations used for modeling. More specifically, small changes in input features could have a large impact on the predictions because of the existence of decision nodes; although highly correlated features have been eliminated before modeling, specific values between every two features may appear in pairs. Therefore, the feature effects in the decision tree model may be a combination of the feature effects in the LightGBM model because only three features were used in the decision tree model. Nevertheless, the general feature effects of TEM size and zeta potential (Fig. 5E,F) were similar to those in the LightGBM model (Fig. 4E,F): larger TEM size and lower zeta potential had higher root\ndry weight. Concentration and size had the strongest interactions but the dispersion was not obvious (Fig. S20 and Fig. 5G).

            "text": "Crop plants are exposed to various environmental stresses at different growth stages. Strategies that could enhance crop resilience to different environmental stresses may generate multiple benefits in the future. Seven selected nanopriming treatments significantly increased the SRI by 13.9% and 12.6% on average under salinity and combined heat-drought stress, respectively. The\ntreatment using ZnO (30 nm at 200 mg/L) had the highest SRI under both salinity and combined heat-drought stress, with a low nanoparticle cost of ~\u00a5 13.55/ha (around $ 2/ha, Supplementary method S5). This may be due to the following reasons: zinc is the only metal represented in all six enzyme classes, and acts as an important component for essential enzymes of plants and several transcription factors (Auld, 2001; Prasad et al., 2012); half of the global cereal-growing soils had Zn-deficiency problems (Liu et al., 2020), and maize was considered highly susceptible to Zn deficiency (Noulas et al., 2018); and it has been indicated that the ZnO nanoparticles could be biotransformed into the forms usable by plants (Da Cruz et al., 2017). Besides, root dry weight was the most obvious improvement among all biological endpoints, demonstrating that seed nanopriming may improve maize stress tolerance by promoting water and nutrient uptake by roots, which were also indicated in previous literature reports (El-Badri et al., 2021; Mahakham et al., 2017). It was demonstrated that Zn-containing nanoparticles could enhance root length more than other metal-containing nanoparticles in a meta-analysis (Guo et al., 2022). Although only seedling stage was investigated in this study, deep and developed roots might be essential for plant adaptation and productivity under environmental stresses in all growth stages (Giordano et al., 2021; Varshney et al., 2021). Moreover, the advances in the green synthesis of nanoparticles would enhance their biocompatibility for biotechnology applications (Shafey, 2020; Sharma et al., 2021).\nMetabolomics demonstrated that maize leaves after seed nanopriming underwent many metabolic reprogrammings under both salinity and combined heat-drought stresses. Tryptophan is the biosynthetic precursor for melatonin, which could enhance plant resistance to salinity stress by directly clearing reactive oxygen species and indirectly enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity (Li et al., 2019). Secondary metabolites are recognized as natural tools that can help plants tolerate environmental stresses by regulating the gene transcriptions involved in stress tolerance (Jan et al., 2021). The high-level accumulation of benzenoids and carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates was observed in the SN treatment. It was reported that benzenoids serve as chemical signals and precursors of natural products related to plant stress fitness (Tinte et al., 2022). The homeostasis of carbohydrates, important sources of carbon and energy during plant metabolism,\nis critical for plant environmental stress tolerance. Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism was significantly enriched under both salinity and combined heat-drought stresses due to the upregulation of Glucosamine 6-phosphate and D-Glucosamine. Asparagine plays an important role in nitrogen storage and transport in plants, and it accumulates under stress conditions for the maintenance of osmotic pressure (Lea et al., 2007). However, it was down-regulated in the HdN treatment, probably due to HdN upregulating other metabolites to balance osmotic pressure and help plants survive dehydration, such as fatty acids and conjugates (Gu et al., 2020). The effect on aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis may indicate that HdN could mitigate combined heat-drought stress by regulating the translation process (Wang et al., 2021).\nCollecting data from experiments is resource-intensive and time-consuming, underscoring the importance of making full use of existing data. In this study, we used a more rigorous performance evaluation, randomly dividing the dataset ten times (random seed from 1 to 10) and building ten models to determine the average model performance. This stringent approach may lead to a reduced model performance, but the performance assessment was unbiased. Because the model trained on a specific training set could lead to biased performance estimates, especially in a small dataset (Vabalas et al., 2019).\nPMP interpretation workflow was proposed to highlight the strengths and make up for the weaknesses of different interpretive methods. Three types of ISAR were presented including the post hoc interpretation of the LightGBM model, the model-based interpretation of self-interpretable models, and the combination of model-based and post hoc interpretation of the decision tree model. Researchers and policymakers could choose which interpretation type they prefer to accept. For example, the model-based interpretation of self-interpretable models can be trusty for high-stakes decision making (Rudin, 2019). However, the post hoc interpretation of complex models with good performance may be useful for researchers to extract hypotheses from high-dimensional spaces. For example, the effects of nanoparticle size and zeta potential along with their interactions need more attention as most studies focused on concentrations.\nData-driven research with interpretable tools could accelerate the discovery and assessment of nanomaterials, while the data gap is always a challenge. Although data-sharing practices have received attention in the last decade (Yu et al., 2021), the available data in the fields of agriculture are still lacking due to the expensive data collection, large feature space, and complex data curation and quality evaluation. The complete characterization of nanomaterials, seeds/plants, environment, and experimental protocols will improve the reusability of experimental data."
