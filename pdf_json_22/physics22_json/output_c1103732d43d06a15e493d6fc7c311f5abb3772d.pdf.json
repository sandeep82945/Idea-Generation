            "text": "The standard model on a stochastic background of gravitational waves or the one supplemented with quantum gravity can be viewed as a theory of matter fields in a random geometry which can be singular at short distances. There are some results [1\u20137] indicating that gravity can modify the short-distance (equivalently, large-momentum) behavior of matter fields. There are some simplified Lorentz non-invariant models where such a modified short-distance behavior in various directions in space\u2013time is realized [8\u201310]. The question appears of whether the large-momentum behavior of quantum fields in the background of quantized gravity or in the stochastic background could be experimentally verified, e.g., in high-energy scattering. The detection of gravitational waves [11] raises the questions of whether these waves can be considered as a stream of gravitons and whether their interaction with particles can be treated as a particle-graviton scattering. There is a suggestion [12] that the effect of gravitons can be observed as a noise in the interferometers applied for gravitational-waves detection. In such a model, the quantum equation for geodesic deviation is studied. It is shown that gravitons transform this equation into a stochastic differential equation when changing the particle evolution. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of how the dynamics of the quantum scalar field can be changed in a linearly polarized stochastic gravitational plane wave moving in the x-direction. Such a stochastic metric can arise from stochastic sources of gravitational waves or from particular states of quantum gravity. The stochastic metric corresponding to the plane wave has the spectral function \u03c1(k) restricted to kx \u2265 0 with ky = kz = 0. We show that if the graviton correlation function is singular at short distances, then the scalar-field propagator decays faster in the momentum space (in comparison to the free-field propagator) in the direction orthogonal to the wave propagation. Such an improved behavior of propagators of matter fields in the background of a quantum gravitational field is important for the renormalization and ultraviolet stability of these theories. The singular correlation functions of the metric (large contribution of high frequencies) emerge as a consequence of the perturbative quantization of gravity. The high-frequency dependence of the gravitational radiation can appear as a result of an inflationary enhancement of the gravitational vacuum contribution [13,14], according to Ref. [15]. The plan of the paper is the following. In Section 2, we discuss the Gaussian stochastic plane waves and their interaction with a quantum scalar field. In Section 3, we consider the quantum states of the linearized gravitational field, which can describe a stochastic metric. In Section 4, the Dyson expansion for the propagator in a simplified\nUniverse 2022, 8, 648. https://doi.org/10.3390/universe8120648 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe\nmodel of a random metric is investigated. In Section 5, we consider the Feynman path integral representing the resummation of the Dyson series. In Section 6, we estimate the behavior of the propagator at large momenta. In Section 7, we summarize our results."

For the plane wave moving in the positive direction of the x-axis [16], h(t, x) = h(u) where u = t\u2212 x (the velocity of light c = 1) .

The average (2) could also be performed in the Feynman path integral expressing the quantum fluctuations in the metric, as discussed in [18\u201320]. We assume that h can be approximated by a Gaussian variable. Such an assumption, in the case of a stochastic background, is justified by the central limit theorem of probability theory. If we have small stochastic sources of gravitational radiation then the probability distribution of an infinite sum of stochastic variables (no matter what their individual probability distributions) can be approximated by the Gaussian distribution. In the quantum theory of the next section, we show that in the limit of linearized semiclassical gravity we can use the stochastic Gaussian approximation for quantum plane waves."

Then,\nUt\u03c8 gr 0 (h)\u03c8 sc 0 (\u03c6) = (\nexp(\u2212 ih\u0304 Hgrt)\u03c8 gr 0 (h)\n) T ( exp(\u2212 ih\u0304 \u222b t 0 H I sc(s)ds) ) \u03c8sc0 (\u03c6)\n\u2261 \u03c8grt (h)\u03c8sct (h(.), \u03c6), (8)\nwhere \u03c8sct (h(.), \u03c6) becomes a functional of the quantum field h(s, x). Thus far, the formulas are exact. h(.) on the rhs of Equation (8) means that Hsc(h, \u03c6) \u2192 Hsc(h(s), \u03c6). We are using, in Hsc(h(s), \u03c6), the scalar-field Hamiltonian with an operator metric h(s, x) (7). We make the approximation neglecting the non-commutativity of h(s, x) at different times. h(s, x) becomes a classical stochastic field. The commutator [h(s, x), h(s\u2032, x\u2032)] ' O(h\u0304). This means that neglecting non-commutativity, we are applying a semiclassical approximation to the coupling of the metric to the quantum scalar field. We choose as \u03c8sc0 (\u03c6) the ground state of the massive free scalar field. We apply the functional representation of states in quantum-field theory. In this representation, the propagator in a stochastic gravitational field of the quantum scalar field in its ground state is\n(Ut\u03c80, \u03c6(x)\u03c6(t, x\u2032)Ut\u03c80) = \u222b Dhrl |\u03c8 gr t |2D\u03c6 exp ( i 2h\u0304 \u222b d4x \u221a |g|(g\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2202\u03bd\u03c6\u2212m2\u03c62 ) \u03c6(x)\u03c6(t, x\u2032)\n= 12 ih\u0304 \u222b Dhrl |\u03c8 gr t (h)|2A\u22121(0, x; t, x\u2032).\n(9)\nThe Hamiltonian for the linearized (free) gravitational field is [13]\nHgr = 1 2\n\u222b dk ( \u2212\u039b \u03b4\n\u03b4hrl(k) \u039b\n\u03b4\n\u03b4hrl(\u2212k) + k2(\u039bh)rl(k)(\u039bh)rl(\u2212k)\n) , (10)\nwhere r, l = 1, 2, 3 and (\u039bT)ij is the projection of a tensor Tmn onto the one in the TT gauge defined at the beginning of Section 2. The matrix \u039b in the momentum representation has the form\n2\u039bij;mn( kk ) = (\u03b4im \u2212 k \u22122kikm)(\u03b4jn \u2212 k\u22122k jkn) +(\u03b4in \u2212 k\u22122kikn)(\u03b4jm \u2212 k\u22122k jkm)\u2212 23 (\u03b4ij \u2212 k\u22122kik j)(\u03b4nm \u2212 k\u22122knkm).\nIt follows from Equations (7) and (10) that\n(\u22022t \u22124)hrl = 0. (11)\nMoreover, as shown in [13], the correlation functions in the ground state of the Hamiltonian (10) (as calculated below in Equation (17)) satisfy the Weinberg requirements for massless tensor fields [21].\nWe choose as an initial state the general Gaussian translation invariant wave function of tensorial fields in the TT gauge\n\u03c8 gr 0 = A0 exp\n( \u2212 1\n2h\u0304\n\u222b (\u039bh)rl(x)\u03930(x\u2212 y)rl,ij(\u039bh)ij(y)dxdy ) , (12)\nwhere A0 is a normalization constant. The Gaussian states have a positively definite Wigner function. For this reason, they give a proper semiclassical approximation for quantum states. For a free Hamiltonian (10), the time evolution of a Gaussian state is again a Gaussian state. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation ih\u0304\u2202t\u03c8 = Hgr\u03c8 with the initial condition (12) has the solution which is again a Gaussian translation invariant wave function\n\u03c8 gr t = At exp\n( \u2212 1\n2h\u0304\n\u222b (\u039bh)rl(x)\u0393t(x\u2212 y)rl,ij(\u039bh)ij(y)dxdy ) , (13)\nif \u0393 satisfies the equation\ni\u2202t\u0393t(k)rl,ij \u2212 \u0393t(k)rl,mn\u0393t(\u2212k)mn,ij + k2\u03b4ri\u03b4l j = 0, (14)\nwhere \u0393(k) is the Fourier transform of \u0393(x) and k = |k|. The time-independent solution of Equation (14)\n\u0393t(k)rl,ij = k\u03b4ri\u03b4l j (15)\ncorresponds to the ground state [13,14]\n\u03c8 gr 0 (h) = exp\n( \u2212 1\n2\n\u222b dk|k|(\u039bh)jl(k)\u2217(\u039bh)jl(k) ) leading to the Gaussian measure\nd\u00b50(h) = Dhjk|\u03c8 gr 0 | 2\ndescribing in the TT gauge the free tensorial massless fields in the ground state. Then, correlation functions in the ground state are\n(\u03c8 gr 0 , hjl(x)hmn(t, x \u2032)\u03c8 gr 0 ) = (2\u03c0) \u22123 \u222b dk|k|\u22121 exp(\u2212ikt) exp(ik(x\u2212 x\u2032)) (\u03b4jm(k)\u03b4ln(k) + \u03b4jn(k)\u03b4lm(k)\u2212 \u03b4jl(k)\u03b4mn(k)),\n(16)\nwhere \u03b4jl(k) = \u03b4jl \u2212 k jkl |k|\u22122.\nThe correlation (16) behaves as( (\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032)2 )\u22121 = ( (u\u2212 u\u2032)(x\u2212 t\u2212 x\u2032)\u2212 (y\u2212 y\u2032)2 \u2212 (z\u2212 z\u2032)2 )\u22121 (17)\nat short space-time distances (in the notation of Section 2). The time-dependent solutions of Equation (14) can be related to solutions of a linear equation. Let us define the matrix v(k) as a time-ordered exponential of the matrix \u0393(k)\nv = T ( exp(i \u222b t\n0 \u0393sds)\n) . (18)\nIt can also be defined as the solution of the equation \u2202tv = i\u0393v. If \u0393 satisfies Equation (14) then the matrix v satisfies a linear equation\nd2v dt2 + k2v = 0. (19)\nWe can recover \u0393 from v as i\u0393t = v\u22121\ndv dt . (20)\nThe general solution of Equation (19) is\nv = M exp(ikt) + N exp(\u2212ikt), (21)\nwhere the matrices M and N may depend on k. We have from Equations (20) and (21) that\n\u03930 = k(M\u2212 N)(M + N)\u22121 (22)\nand \u0393t(k) = k(exp(ikt)M\u2212 N exp(\u2212ikt))(exp(ikt)M + N exp(\u2212ikt))\u22121. (23)\nThe two-point correlation function of h calculated as the covariance of the measure d\u00b5 = Dhrl |\u03c8 gr t |2 is the Fourier transform of \u0393 \u22121 t (k). By a proper choice of the (matrix) functions M and N we can achieve that the dependence of matrix elements of \u0393\u22121 on the components of k can be dominating or negligible. We can choose \u0393 in Equations (22) and (23) in such a way that only the correlation functions < h33h33 >=< h22h22 >= \u2212 < h22h33 > are not negligible (we demand (h33 = \u2212h22 = h in the sense of correlation functions). The remaining components of the metric in the TT gauge h11 and hjk for j 6= k will have vanishing correlation functions by a choice of \u0393. We choose \u0393rl,ij such that \u0393rl,rl \u2192 \u221e for rl = 11, 12, 13, 23. In such a case the expectation values (and correlation functions) with respect to the measure d\u00b5 = Dhrl |\u03c8 gr t |2 of the components of the tensor hrl which are absent in the metric (1) tend to zero. In this way the wave function \u03c8grt is imposing the TT gauge in the sense that the correlation functions of h asymptotically satisfy this gauge. The TT gauge (for diagonal h) has as a consequence that h depends only on t and x. It follows that the wave Equation (11) takes the form (\u22022t \u2212 \u22022x)h = 0 (in the sense of expectation values) with the solution which is a sum of waves depending either on t\u2212 x or on t + x. We can damp the t + x component choosing \u039322,22(k) = \u039333,33(k)\u2192 \u221e when kx < 0. Summarizing, we have shown in this section that a gravitational wave treated as a metric in a particular quantum state of a linearized quantum gravity can be considered as a stochastic Gaussian plane wave. We discuss a scalar quantum field in such a stochastic wave in subsequent sections."

This changes A\u03030 in Equation (26) as\nA\u03030 = 1 2 \u22022x + 1 2 p20 \u2212 1 2 p2\u22a5 \u2212 1 2 m2, (29)\nwhere p2\u22a5 = p 2 y + p 2 z . (30)\nThe form of the operator V (28) does not change except that h depends only on x. We shall consider a random metric h. This randomness can come either from classical sources as discussed in Section 2 or from quantum fluctuations of Section 3. For explicit calculations we need a dependence of h solely on one coordinate. There can be a physical reason for such an approximation. In the case of the classical waves this requirement relies on the assumption that we deal with plane waves. In the quantum realm such a metric depending solely on t\u2212 x or on x can arise from a particular initial state as discussed in Section 3. We perform the calculations for the operator A\u0303 (26) with A\u03030 (27) corresponding to the plane wave. The calculations with A\u03030 (29) are similar (just replace A\u0303 by \u2212A\u0303 and u by x). We represent the propagator A\u0303\u22121 = i \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c4 exp(\u2212i\u03c4A\u0303) in terms of the proper time Hamiltonian evolution. The operator A\u0303 has the form of a Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics. We assume that it has a self-adjoint extension. The unitary evolution exp(\u2212iA\u0303\u03c4) can be expressed in the interaction picture. We write\nU\u03c4 = exp(\u2212iA\u0303\u03c4) = exp(\u2212iA\u03030\u03c4)U I\u03c4 .

(42)\nAs discussed in Sections 2 and 3, we impose on the Gaussian measure d\u00b5(h) = Dhrl |\u03c8 gr t |2 the conditions that in the linearized quantum gravity the measure is strongly concentrated on the metric solving the wave equation and satisfying the TT condition. In such a case (as discussed at the end of Section 3), the metric depends only on u = t\u2212 x. The background of plane gravitational waves, discussed in Section 2, moving in a fixed direction can also\ndepend on one variable. In these idealized cases, we assume that h(u) is a Gaussian random field defined by the measure d\u00b5(h) characterized by its generating functional\u222b\nd\u00b5(h) exp ( i \u222b duJ(u)h(u) ) = exp ( \u2212 1\n2\n\u222b dudu\u2032 J(u)g(u\u2212 u\u2032)J(u\u2032) ) , (43)\nwhere g(u\u2212 u\u2032) is the correlation function of h(u). We consider the covariance\ng(u\u2212 u\u2032) =< h(u)h(u\u2032) >= \u03ba2|u\u2212 u\u2032|\u22124\u03b3. (44)\nWe need 0 < \u03b3 < 14 for a rigorous approach (the restriction \u03b3 < 1 4 and consequences of crossing the line \u03b3 = 14 are considered at the end of Section 6). The exact scale invariance of g(u) is not necessary for our results. It is sufficient to assume that g(u) has the form (44) for u \u2192 0. We make the assumption of an exact scale invariance for simplicity of the argument. The absolute value |u\u2212 u\u2032| in Equation (44) is needed for a mathematical definition of a stochastic variable, as the bilinear form in the exponential in Equation (44) is positively definite only with the absolute value and 0 < \u03b3 < 14 . However, in the next section, only the scaling property of the covariance (44) is used in a derivation of the result. Let us note that the free-field correlation function (17) behaves as (u\u2212 u\u2032)\u22121 (so \u03b3 = 14 ) if y = y\u2032 = z = z\u2032 = 0). In the free field correlation (17) there is no absolute value but instead the ie prescription for an interpretation of the integral over u, u\u2032 in the Feynman propagator. We set \u03b3 as a free parameter taking into account the suggestion [1\u20134,6] that quantum gravity at short distances can be more regular than in canonical field theory. For a stochastic background of gravitational waves, the scale invariant correlation functions (44) were derived in some models of gravitational radiation [24,25]. It is our aim in this paper to show that singular gravity leads to a more regular scalar field propagator. The singularity of the correlations at small time means a large contribution of high-frequency waves to the spectrum (as the frequency spectrum of the covariance (44) is \u03c94\u03b3\u22121). At present, only low-frequency gravitational waves have been detected [17]. The large contribution of high-frequency modes to the wave spectrum is expected to have a quantum origin. These quantum fluctuations could be enhanced by inflation and appear in an observable wave spectrum, as discussed in [15] (a similar mechanism is known to work for scalar fields leading to squeezed states [26,27])."

Let us denote by d\u03bd(Q) the Gaussian measure with the covariance (48).

At the end of this section, let us return to the expansion (35) (or (39)) and calculate it with the correlation function (44)\u222b q(0)=uDq(.) exp ( i 2 \u222b \u03c4 0 ( dq ds ) 2 ) \u222b \u03c4 0 ds2 \u222b s2 0 ds1 < Vs2 Vs1 > +... ) \u03c8(q(\u03c4))\n= \u03ba2(p+p\u2212)2 \u222b \u03c4 0 ds2 \u222b s2\n0 ds1 p(s1; u\u2212 u1)p(s2 \u2212 s1; u2 \u2212 u1) \u00d7p(\u03c4 \u2212 s2; u3 \u2212 u2)|u2 \u2212 u1|\u22124\u03b3\u03c8(u3)du3 + ....\n(51)\nThe integral over u2 \u2212 u1 exists as the Lebesgue integral only if \u03b3 < 14 (for \u03b3 = 1 4 we have a logarithmic divergence). We encounter the same problem when calculating (perturbatively) the expectation value of the exponential in Equation (47). Such integrals could possibly be interpreted in the sense of generalized functions [29], allowing an extension to \u03b3 > 14 (the ground-state correlation function (17) corresponds to \u03b3 = 14 ). Such an extension could allow the definition of the s-integrals in Equations (50) and (51). However, some positivity properties of the integrals may be lost, which can lead to difficulties in the interpretation of the result in the framework of quantum-field theory. An explicit calculation of the propagator (50) can be performed in a perturbation expansion in \u03ba. The result is equivalent to the calculation by means of the Dyson series (35). When we set u = u\u2032, then we can obtain from Equation (50) some non-perturbative estimates. Let us change the proper time variable to \u03c4 = \u03c4\u2032(\u03bap+p\u2212) \u2212 1 (1\u2212\u03b3) . Then, at u = u\u2032 in the exponential in Equation (50), if 0 < \u03b3 < 1 the term p2\u03c4 = p2\u03c4\u2032(\u03bap+p\u2212) \u2212 1 (1\u2212\u03b3) becomes small in comparison to the term \u03c4\u20322(1\u2212\u03b3) in the limit of large pz (or py). Performing the \u03c4\u2032 integral (with the negligence of the p2\u03c4 term), we obtain\n< G(A\u0303; u, u; p) >= C(p+p\u2212) \u2212 12(1\u2212\u03b3) (52)\nwith a certain constant C (this constant can be an infinite renormalization constant if \u03b3 \u2265 14 because of the divergence of the integral (51)). If there is no stochastic metric (\u03ba = \u03b3 = 0 in Equation (50)), then by means of the integration over \u03c4 we obtain the propagator of the scalar field at equal time u = u\u2032 as\n(p2)\u2212 1 2 . (53)\nWe can see that if 1 > \u03b3 > 0 then the propagator (52) is decaying faster for large pz than the free propagator (53).\nAlthough the propagator in a stochastic metric (44) is not Lorentz invariant, it is instructive to calculate the Lorentz invariant propagators with a non-canonical scaling, as discussed in [30,31]\nG(\u03be) = i \u222b dp0dp exp(i\u03be\u00b5 p\u00b5) \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c4(i\u03c4) \u03b1 exp(i \u03c42 p 2)\n= (2\u03c0)\u22122 \u222b \u221e\n0 d\u03c4(i\u03c4) \u22122+\u03b1 exp( i2\u03c4 \u03be\n2) (54)\nwhere p2 = p20\u2212p2 and \u03be2 = t2\u2212 x2. From Equation (54), the propagator in the momentum space is (p2)\u22121\u2212\u03b1 and the propagator at t = 0 is (p2)\u2212 1 2\u2212\u03b1. Hence, in order to obtain the behavior (52) of the equal time propagator (50) for a large pz, we need (1\u2212 \u03b3)\u22121 = 1 + 2\u03b1."

            "text": "We derived an asymptotic behavior in the momentum space of the scalar-field twopoint correlation function (the propagator) in particular Gaussian Lorentz non-invariant states. The states describe a plane wave moving in the x direction whose metric has singular short-distance correlation functions. As a result of an interaction of the scalar field with this quantum fluctuation in the metric, the scalar-field propagator decays faster in the momentum space (in direction orthogonal to the wave motion) than is possible in canonical field theory. Canonical field theory allows the faster decay of correlations at large distances (small momenta) but not at small distances (large momenta). From the method of derivation of the result, it can be seen that such an anomalous behavior cannot arise from a coupling of the scalar field to a quantum gauge field or to another scalar field, but is characteristic of the coupling of the metric to the kinetic part of the scalar-field Lagrangian. Another special feature of the model is that we did not calculate the scalar-field correlations in the ground state of the metric field but in a particular time-dependent Lorentz non-invariant solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. It is possible that in a Lorentz invariant quantum theory of matter fields interacting with quantum gravity the scalar field expectation values in a time-dependent states can decay faster in the momentum space than this is allowed in vacuum states (if such states exist at all in theories with quantum gravity). In this way, there remains the prospect of a construction of quantum-field theory including gravity where matter-field correlation functions in time-dependent states are more regular at short distances than is allowed in the vacuum states of Lorentz invariant theory (according to the K\u00e4llen-Lehmann representation). Such a scheme would be a realization of the regularizing role of Wheeler\u2019s \u201cquantum foam\u201d, as reviewed recently in [7].\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nConflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest."
