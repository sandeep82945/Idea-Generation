 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different ionic liquid cations on the CO2 reduction mechanism and product selectivity. The imidazolium cation was used in this study, but other cations like pyrrolidinium or morpholinium could provide different interactions with CO2 and influence the reaction pathway. 

2. Explore the use of metalloporphyrin catalysts with different metal centers (Fe, Ni, etc.) for CO2 reduction. The metal center impacts the catalytic activity and tuning it could improve efficiency.

3. Combine the metalloporphyrin catalyst with graphene, carbon nanotubes or other nanostructured supports. The high surface area and conductivity could facilitate electron transfer to the catalyst and improve performance. 

4. Incorporate the ionic liquid and metalloporphyrin catalyst into a gas diffusion electrode for continuous CO2 conversion and product extraction. This could enable practical electrochemical device design. 

5. Conduct computational modeling studies of the CO2 reduction mechanism on the metalloporphyrin catalyst to gain further insights. DFT calculations could reveal intermediates, transition states and rate limiting steps to guide optimization.
