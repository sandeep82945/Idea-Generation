    "abstractText": "The memory effects of semantic attributes (e.g., concreteness, familiarity, valence) have long been studied by manipulating their average perceived intensities, as quantified in word rating norms. The semantic ambiguity hypothesis specifies that the uncertainty as well as the intensity of semantic attributes is processed when words are encoded. Testing that hypothesis requires a normed measure of ambiguity, so that ambiguity and intensity can be manipulated independently. The standard deviation (SD) of intensity ratings has been used for that purpose, which has produced three characteristic ambiguity effects. Owing to the recency of such research, fundamental questions remain about the validity of this method of measuring ambiguity and about its process-level effects on memory. In a validity experiment, we found that the rating SDs of six semantic attributes (arousal, concreteness, familiarity, meaningfulness, negative valence, positive valence) passed tests of concurrent and predictive validity. In three memory experiments, we found that manipulating rating SDs had a specific effect on retrieval: It influenced subjects\u2019 ability to use reconstructive retrieval to recall words. That pattern was predicted by the current theoretical explanation of how ambiguity benefits memory.",

To study this hypothesis, a standardized method of measuring and manipulating attribute ambiguity is needed. Normed variability in the perceived intensity of semantic attributes has been used for that purpose in recent experimentation. The primary objective of the research that we report here was to resolve two unanswered questions about this method. First, is it valid \u2013 that is, is there any independent evidence that it taps the uncertainty of those perceptions? Second, if ambiguity-driven differences in encoding have downstream memory effects, which specific retrieval processes capture those effects?"

            "text": "Published word norms for semantic attributes have been used to study the semantic ambiguity hypothesis. Such norms are widely used tools in the larger memory and cognition literature. That literature contains several such norms, in which thousands of words have been judged for the perceived intensity of specific attributes \u2013 with judgments usually being made on unimodal (lower \u2192 higher) numerical scales. Published rating norms provide the means (Ms) and standard deviations (SDs) of intensity ratings of individual words. Sixteen examples are displayed in Table\u00a01, along with an illustrative norming project for each attribute.\nIt has often been found that varying the M intensity ratings of semantic attributes affects the content that people process when they encode words (e.g., Einstein & McDaniel, 1990; Gomes et\u00a0al., 2013; Henriques & Davidson, 2000; Kounios & Holcomb, 1994), as well as the accuracy of subsequent memory for those words (for reviews, see Bookbinder & Brainerd, 2016; Juhasz, 2005; Kensinger, 2009; Marschark et\u00a0al., 1987). The semantic ambiguity hypothesis posits that varying the SDs of those same ratings also affects the content that people process when they encode words * C. J. Brainerd cb299@cornell.edu\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychology and\u00a0Human Neuroscience Institute, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA\n1 3\nand the accuracy of subsequent memory (Brainerd, 2018; Brainerd et\u00a0al., 2021a).\nEmpirically, we know that not only does an attribute\u2019s perceived intensity differ for different words [e.g., mother has a stronger positive valence than father, Ms = 8.38 and 7.08, respectively, in the Bradley & Lang, 1999 norms], but so does the degree of uncertainty that attaches to those perceptions \u2013 even among words whose perceived intensities are the same on average. For instance, the M valence ratings of freedom and talent are the same (7.6 in the Bradley-Lang norms), but people disagree far more in their valence perceptions of freedom than their perceptions of talent (SDs = 2.0 and 1.3, respectively). The hypothesis that such differences affect how people process semantic attributes during encoding is counterintuitive from the perspective of the traditional idea (e.g., Toglia & Battig, 1978) that rating SDs are merely indexes of measurement error (unreliability in the measurement of perceived intensity).\nNevertheless, some early support for this hypothesis can be found in research by Mattek et\u00a0al. (2017) on perceived valence. Mattek et\u00a0al. evaluated the prediction that if ambiguity affects how valence is encoded, correlations between M intensity ratings of valence and arousal, which are expected to be high on theoretical grounds (see Kuppens et\u00a0al., 2013), will be low when valence ambiguity is high. They found that, indeed, such correlations varied dramatically for items whose valence was uncertain versus items that were clearly positive or negative. Brainerd (2018) then used valence rating SDs to measure graded changes in the ambiguity of\nperceived valence. In emotional word and picture norms, he found that the strength of such valence-arousal correlations declined linearly as rating SDs increased.\nThe ambiguity hypothesis has been extended by generating further predictions about valence ambiguity and showing that those same predictions hold for other semantic attributes. Two such predictions about valence ambiguity were discussed by Brainerd, et\u00a0al., (2021a) and then extended to other attributes by Brainerd et\u00a0al. (2021b). The predictions were that (a) words\u2019 rating SDs should be inverted-U functions of their M intensity ratings for an attribute, and (b) words with higher rating SDs should be easier to remember in recall experiments. Both predictions follow from fuzzytrace theory\u2019s (FTT) account of how subjects perceive the intensity of semantic attributes (e.g., Brainerd et\u00a0al., 2017). Concerning the first, FTT posits that ambiguity is low when a word retrieves few attribute features (low intensity) or many features (high intensity) but is high when it retrieves a moderate number (intermediate intensity). Concerning the other prediction, FTT posits that when manipulations make semantic attributes more ambiguous, controlled processing increases, which yields richer and more detailed representations that redound to the benefit of later recall (see also, Bugg, 2014).\nBrainerd et\u00a0al. (2021a) confirmed both predictions for valence, and Brainerd et\u00a0al. (2021a) confirmed them for some other semantic attributes. In the latter research, it was found that all 16 attributes in Table\u00a01 exhibited inverted-U relations between M intensity ratings and rating SDs. Those\n1 3\nresults included various controls that ruled out the possibility that the inverted Us could be artifacts of scale boundary effects (i.e., that variance at the low and high endpoints can only go in one direction, back toward the mean, and hence must be lower than for other scale numbers). Three examples appear in Fig.\u00a01. It was also found that words with higher SDs yielded better recall than words with lower SDs when the M intensity ratings and rating SDs of selected attributes were manipulated factorially."

On the one hand, rating SDs are known to be\npsychometrically reliable indexes and three predicted patterns have been detected with them \u2013 namely, that interattribute correlations of M intensity ratings vary inversely with the size of rating SDs, that rating SDs for individual attributes are inverted-U functions of M intensity ratings, and that recall is more accurate after encoding words with higher rating SDs. On the other hand, two fundamental questions remain about rating SDs as indexes of attribute ambiguity. The first is validity \u2013 whether attribute ambiguity is actually what rating SDs measure. That question is the focus of Experiment 1. The other question is exactly how, at the level of specific retrieval processes, higher-SD items improve recall. That question is the focus of Experiments 2\u20134."

            "text": "The current validity situation is that rating SDs have high face validity as an ambiguity index, but no data have been reported that establish either concurrent validity or predictive validity. Concerning face validity, if the perceived intensity of an attribute (say, valence) is more ambiguous for one word than another (say, for freedom than for talent), people should disagree more in their intensity ratings of the first word than the second (Brainerd, 2018). Psychologically, the attribute features that are retrieved by the first word are less determinative than those that are retrieved by the second, leading to more variability in perceived intensity.\nThat is merely a conceptual argument, however, which must have empirical consequences if it is true \u2013 specifically, evidence of concurrent and predictive validity. With respect to concurrent validity, rating SDs ought to correlate with other variables that have high face validity as measures of attribute ambiguity. With respect to predictive validity, rating SDs ought to correlate with other variables that, according to theory, should be affected by ambiguity. Data on both forms of validity are reported in Experiment 1.\nConcurrent and predictive validity tests were conducted at the level of individual words, with data that were averaged across the performance of individual subjects. Concurrent validity was evaluated by having subjects (a) make conventional intensity ratings of six of the attributes in Table\u00a01 and (b) also make numerical ratings of their certainty that these intensity ratings were accurate. The concurrent validity tests evaluated whether the SDs of individual words\u2019 attribute intensity ratings correlated with the M certainty of the words\u2019 intensity ratings. Turning to predictive validity, we measured the latencies of subjects\u2019 attribute intensity ratings of words, as well as the numerical values of the ratings. Because theory posits that increased ambiguity triggers more controlled processing of attribute features, intensity ratings should slow as uncertainty increases. Therefore, the predictive\n1 3\nvalidity tests evaluated whether the SDs of individual words\u2019 attribute intensity ratings correlated with the M latencies of the words\u2019 intensity ratings."

            "text": "Of the three predictions that have been tested for rating SDs, the most counterintuitive one is that recall is more accurate when rating SDs are higher than when they are lower. That is because SDs should have the opposite effect under the traditional assumption that measurement error increases as SDs increase, that intensity perceptions with higher SDs are inherently noisier than perceptions with lower SDs. For instance, Pollock (2018) and Neath and Surprenant (2020) tested the hypothesis that data showing that words with higher M concreteness intensity ratings yield better recall than words with lower M intensity ratings were SD artifacts \u2013 specifically, were due to high-concreteness words having lower rating SDs than low-concreteness words. Neither study confirmed that hypothesis. In other experiments in which M intensity and rating SDs were factorially manipulated for categorization, concreteness, meaningfulness, negative valence, and positive valence, recall was better when SDs were higher (Brainerd et\u00a0al.\u00a02021a, b).\nThe working explanation of the beneficial effects of higher SDs on recall is that the encoding of a word\u2019s semantic content becomes more controlled and thorough as an attribute\u2019s perceived intensity becomes more ambiguous. Brainerd et\u00a0al. (2021b) noted that this hypothesis makes an obvious prediction that follows from prior research in which controlled processing has been encouraged by various manipulations (e.g., increased encoding time; Smith & Kimball, 2012). A well-known finding is that such manipulations enhance later recall, which means that they must enhance some of the retrieval operations that support recall. Which ones?\nHere, we note, first, that a variety of evidence suggests that recall is supported by two distinct retrieval operations, direct verbatim access and reconstruction, plus a slave familiarity process (for a review, see Brainerd et\u00a0al., 2009). To elaborate, subjects recall words by either (a) using direct access to recover literal verbatim traces of their presentation or (b) reconstructing them from gist traces of their semantic content. In the latter case, items that are recovered via reconstruction are subjected to familiarity checks before they are read out on recall tests. If higher rating SDs trigger more thorough encoding of semantic attributes, they ought to enhance recall by improving reconstructive retrieval because reconstruction is focused on semantic content. This prediction was evaluated in Experiments 2\u20134.\nExperiment 1\nThis was a norming experiment that was focused on the validity question. We used published norms for arousal, concreteness, familiarity, meaningfulness, negative valence, and positive valence to sample pools of words for these attributes. Half the words in each pool had received high M ratings on the target attribute and half had received low M ratings. Half the words in the high and low M rating groups had high-rating SDs and half had low-rating SDs. Within individual experimental conditions, subjects rated all the words in three of the six pools for the intensity of their respective attributes on a lower \u2192 higher numerical scale.\nTo test concurrent validity, our subjects also judged the certainty that their intensity ratings of each of the six attributes were accurate on a lower \u2192 higher numerical scale. Words\u2019 M certainty ratings should be inversely related to the SDs of the words\u2019 intensity ratings, if the latter are valid measures of attribute ambiguity. To evaluate predictive validity, we measured the latencies of our subjects\u2019 attribute intensity ratings and certainty ratings. The M latency of words\u2019 intensity ratings and of words\u2019 certainty ratings should both be positively related to the SDs of words\u2019 intensity ratings, if the latter are valid measures of attribute ambiguity."

First, the subject received instructions about the nature of the experiment \u2013 that he or she would be rating three pools of words and that each pool would be rated for one of three semantic attributes. Next, the subject received instructions about how to make ratings for one of six attributes (arousal, concreteness, familiarity, meaningfulness, negative valence, or positive valence). The rating instructions for meaningfulness were drawn from the Toglia and Battig (1978) norms, and the rating instructions for the other five attributes were drawn from the Scott et\u00a0al. (2019) norms.\nFollowing the first set of instructions, the items in the first pool were rated for the target attribute. Each word was centered on the computer screen and printed in 36-pt black font. The subject then rated the words for one of the six attributes. All ratings were self-paced. Two ratings were made for each word. First, the strength of the target attribute was rated (e.g., how arousing the word was, how concrete it was) by clicking a number between 1 and 7 on a scale that appeared below the word (from 1 = extremely low to 7 = extremely high). After the subject chose a number, the strength rating was cleared from the screen. Second, the subject rated his or her certainty that the word\u2019s strength rating was accurate by checking a number between 1 and 7 on a lower \u27f6 higher rating scale (from 1 = not at all certain to 7 = extremely certain). Following the certainty judgment, the screen cleared, and the next word was presented for strength and certainty ratings. The latencies as well as the numerical responses were recorded for both judgments.\nAfter the strength and certainty judgments for the words in the first randomly selected pool, the instructions about how to make ratings for the second attribute were presented. The subject then made strength and certainty ratings of the 120 words in the second pool. After the subject had completed all the words in the second pool, the instructions about how to make ratings for the final attribute were presented, followed by strength and certainty ratings of the 120 words in the third pool.\nThe complete norms for each word in each of the six pools that were generated by this procedure appear in the Appendix. The norms for the words in the arousal and concreteness pools appear in Appendix Table\u00a08. The norms for the words in the familiarity and meaningfulness pools appear in Appendix Table\u00a09.

The results in Table\u00a02 reveal this same pattern in the present experiment. First, note that a < 0 and b > 0 for all six attributes, so that all the functions are inverted Us. Second, note the values of the fit statistics in the r2Q, r2L, and r2C columns. When rating SDs are regressed on M ratings, these are the proportions of variance accounted for by the general quadratic equation (r2Q), by the model that is one step simpler (r2L for the general linear equation), and by the model that is one step more complex (r2C for the general cubic equation). To conclude that SD = f(M) is quadratic, it must be found that r2Q is significantly larger than r2L, but that r2Q does not differ significantly from r2C. This is exactly the pattern for the six attributes in Table\u00a02. Over the six attributes, the mean values of r2Q, r2L, and r2C were .53, .25, and .54, respectively.\nAs in our prior studies of M-SD functions, we conducted three supplementary analyses to ensure that the results in Table\u00a02 were not artifacts of certain boundary effects (see Brainerd et\u00a0al.\u00a02021a) that are possible with numerical rating scales \u2013 namely, situations in which the bulk of the ratings pile up at the high and low endpoints (ceiling and floor effects), where variance is lower because it can only move\n1 3\nin one direction (back toward the mean). First, we generated the frequency distributions for the intensity ratings of the six attributes. Those distributions produced no evidence of either ceiling or floor effects for any of the attributes. Second, we refit all the linear, quadratic, and cubic functions in Table\u00a02 using a data transformation of the raw Ms and SDs that eliminates boundary effects (arcsine). The refits of the transformed data produced the same patterns as before \u2013 for each attribute, the quadratic fit still accounted for significantly more variance than the corresponding linear fit, and the cubic fit still did not account for significantly more variance than the quadratic fit. Finally, we refit the functions in Table\u00a02 using only the data of words whose M intensities were well above the low boundary (Ms \u2265 3) and well below the upper boundary (Ms < 6). Those refits also produced the same patterns as in Table\u00a02."

Visual inspection reveals differences among the six attributes on each of the three variables, and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) established that the differences were significant for each variable. For rating SDs, F(5, 595) = 23.25, MSE = .07, \u03b7p2 = .16, p < .001, for M intensity rating latency, F(5, 595) = 132.27, MSE = .09, \u03b7p2 = .53, p < .001, and for M certainty rating, F(5, 595) = 135.71, MSE = .137, \u03b7p2 = .53, p < .001. Post hoc tests indicated that the magnitude orderings were: (a) concreteness < familiarity = positive valence = meaningfulness < negative valence = arousal for\nrating SDs; (b) familiarity < arousal = positive valence < negative valence < meaningfulness = concreteness for M rating latencies; and (c) meaningfulness < negative valence = positive valence < arousal = concreteness < familiarity for M certainty ratings. It must be remembered that subjects rated different word pools for each attribute. Hence, the differences among the attributes in rating SDs, M intensity rating latencies, and M certainty ratings cannot be interpreted as inherent attribute differences in any of the three variables. Rather, the data in Table\u00a03 should be viewed as descriptive results for each attribute that may suggest psychometric explanations of some of the validity findings.\nWe report two sets of validity results, one for concurrent validity and the other for predictive validity. The concurrent validity question asks whether the SDs of attribute intensity ratings of individual words are correlated with a direct, intuitive measure of the ambiguities of those ratings: the M certainty that subjects express about their intensity ratings of each word. The relevant attenuation-corrected validity coefficients appear in the first column of Table\u00a04\u00a0for arousal, concreteness, familiarity, meaningfulness, negative valence, and positive\nTable 2 Tests of the quadratic law for six semantic attributes\nNote. The objective midpoint of all rating scales is 4. The subjective midpoint of each scale is the maximum of the first derivative of the quadratic function SD = aM2 + bM + c, which is Max A = -b/2a. Second, concerning parameter values, estimates of a, b, and c appear in the first three columns of Table\u00a01. The parameter a measures the steepness of an inverted U, with negative coefficients with larger absolute values producing steeper curves than negative coefficients with smaller absolute values. The parameter b measures the location of an inverted U along the X axis, with positive values tilting the curve down toward higher values of the X and negative values tilting it down toward lower values. The c parameter measures the lengths of the two arms of an inverted-U; that is, how far each arm extends down from the curve\u2019s maximum toward the minimum value of Y *p < .001\nAttribute Parameter estimates and fit\na b c Max A r2 Q\nr2 L\nr2 C\nArousal -.17 1.41 -.86 4.15 .60* .39* .62* Concreteness -.18 1.47 -1.33 4.08 .75* .30* .77* Familiarity -.14 1.15 -.24 4.11 .87* .70* .87* Meaningfulness -.07 .54 .69 3.88 .22* .11* .23* Negative valence -.09 .68 .61 3.78 .45* .02 .45* Positive valence -.12 1 .28 4.17 .31* .00 .31*\nTable 3 Means of attribute intensity rating standard deviations (SDs), attribute intensity rating latencies, and certainty ratings of attribute intensity ratings (numbers in parentheses are SDs)\nAttribute M Intensity rating SD latency M rating latency M certainty\nArousal 1.80 (.29) 2.09 (.22) 5.70 (.20) Concreteness 1.49 (.35) 2.51 (.47) 5.74 (.54) Familiarity 1.57 (.34) 1.60 (.23) 6.45 (.26) Meaningfulness 1.65 (.18) 2.40 (.35) 5.33 (.33) Negative valence 1.77 (.18) 2.39 (.27) 5.56 (.44) Positive valence 1.62 (.19) 2.10 (.20) 5.62 (.27)\n1 3\nvalence. To begin, consider the coefficients for concreteness and familiarity. For these attributes, both concurrent validity coefficients are virtually perfect, and thus, there was extremely strong support for the hypothesis that the subjective certainty that their intensity ratings are correct declines as those ratings become more variable. For the six attributes as a group, all the concurrent validity coefficients were statistically reliable. The mean value of the six coefficients was .66, which is a moderately strong relation in the language of correlations. Thus, the SDs of intensity ratings passed concurrent validity tests because rating SDs increased reliably as the judged uncertainty of intensity ratings increased.\nTurning to predictive validity, the question is whether the intensity rating SDs of individual words forecasts the words\u2019 M values for other variables that theory expects that they should predict. Here, theory makes a pair of predictions (Brainerd et\u00a0al., 2021b). The first falls out of the working explanation of why recall is better for words with higher rating SDs, which is that such words trigger more thorough and detailed encoding. On the hypothesis that thorough encoding requires more time than superficial encoding, rating SDs ought to predict the M latencies of intensity ratings. The other prediction is concerned with\nthe certainty judgments that subjects made about their intensity ratings. If rating SDs and M certainty ratings are both measuring ambiguity, M certainty ratings should also predict the M latencies of intensity ratings. The results for the two forms of predictive validity appear in the second and third columns of Table\u00a04.\nTaking SD-latency first, consider the validity coefficients for concreteness and familiarity \u2013two attributes for which concurrent validity was especially high. Strong positive correlations would be expected, and they were observed, with the average value being .94. For the other four attributes, all the validity coefficients were reliable and positive, with a mean value of .48.\nContinuing to M certainty ratings, consider the validity coefficients for concreteness and familiarity first, as before. Strong negative correlations would be expected (greater certainty = shorter latencies), and they were observed, with both being nearly perfect. For the other four attributes, the general picture was one of stronger predictive validity correlations for M certainty than for rating SDs. In fact, all the predictive validity coefficients in the third column are larger than the corresponding ones in the second column, except for familiarity.\nA cautionary comment about the predictive validity results is in order. As the coefficients in the third column of Table\u00a04 are larger than those in the second column, it is tempting to entertain theoretical interpretations of that difference, such as positing that certainty judgments somehow tap attribute ambiguity more directly than rating SDs. Any such hypothesis would be speculative, however, because our experiments did not include procedures to measure the relative sensitivity of different indexes of attribute ambiguity.\nExperiments 2\u20134\nIn prior experimentation, increases in attribute rating SDs have produced improvements in recall for multiple attributes when their rating SDs and M intensity ratings were manipulated factorially. The exact reason is unclear. The working explanation is that increases in ambiguity trigger more thorough, detailed encoding of attribute features (Brainerd, et\u00a0al., 2021a), which receives direct support from the finding (Table\u00a04) that intensity rating latencies are longer when intensity levels are more uncertain (higher rating SDs). To improve recall, however, that encoding effect must translate into downstream effects on specific retrieval processes. Our aim in Experiments 2\u20134 was to identify those retrieval processes.\nWe mentioned earlier that because attribute ambiguity is concerned with semantic features, retrieval operations that process semantic content, reconstruction in particular, should be affected by ambiguity-driven enhancements in encoding. To evaluate that possibility, it is necessary to separate reconstructive retrieval from retrieval operations\nNote. Validity coefficients were computed with the equation \u03c1X\u2032Y\u2032 = rXY \u00f7[\u221a(rXX \u00d7 rYY)], where rXY is the raw sample correlation, rXX is the estimated reliability of the X variable, and rYY is the estimated reliability of the Y variable. For the variables in this table, the reliability estimates ranged from .49 to .90, except for meaningfulness rating latencies. As the reliability values for intensity rating SDs, we used the means of two reliability coefficients that had been computed for each attribute (a split-half coefficient and a parallel-forms coefficient). As the reliability values for M intensity rating latencies, we computed modified split-half reliabilities, using the same procedure that generated the split-half coefficients for SDs. All the reliability coefficients were significant, except for meaningfulness. Hence, predictive validity tests were not computed for that variable. As the reliability values for M certainty ratings, we computed modified split-half reliabilities, using the same procedure that generated the split-half coefficients for SDs. Any validity correlation whose absolute value is \u2265 .16 is significant beyond the .05 level *p < .003 **p < .001\n1 3\nthat process literal verbatim content. Modeling techniques that accomplish this are available for both recognition (see Abadie et\u00a0al., 2013; Abadie & Camos, 2019; Greene et\u00a0al., in press; Greene & Naveh-Benjamin, 2020, 2021; Lampinen et\u00a0al., 2005; Lampinen & Odegard, 2006; Niedzialkowska & Niezna\u0144ski, in press; Niezna\u0144ski & Obidzinski, 2019; Singer & Remillard, 2008; Singer & Spear, 2015) and recall (see Barnhardt et\u00a0al., 2006; Bouwmeester & Verkoeijen, 2011; Bruer & Pozzulo, 2014; Marche et\u00a0al., 2016; Palmer & Dodson, 2009; Storbeck & Clore, 2005; Tractenberg et\u00a0al., 2015).\nReturning to the working explanation of ambiguitydriven improvements in recall, the explanation obviously predicts that these improvements should be tied to enhanced reconstructive retrieval. This prediction is easily tested with the dual-retrieval model (Gomes et\u00a0al., 2014; Tractenberg et\u00a0al., 2015), which was developed to secure separate estimates of reconstruction, direct verbatim access, and familiarity judgment for recall. It supplies maximum likelihood estimates of the six retrieval parameters in Table\u00a05 for free, cued, and serial recall data.\nTwo parameters measure successful reconstruction (R1 and R2), two measure successful verbatim access (D1 and D2), and two measure successful familiarity judgment (J1 and J2). In prior experiments with this model, classic semantic manipulations (e.g., deep vs. shallow encoding instructions, large vs. small numbers of category exemplars, subjects with normal vs. impaired meaning comprehension) have affected the reconstruction parameters, whereas classic item distinctiveness manipulations (e.g., full vs. divided attention, shorter vs. longer lists, familiar vs. unusual fonts) have affected the direct access parameters (for a review, see Gomes et\u00a0al., 2014). Consequently, if semantic content is\nencoded more thoroughly as attribute ambiguity increases, the values of one or both reconstruction parameters ought to be larger for words with higher rating SDs than for words with lower SDs. This effect might spill over to the direct access or familiarity judgment parameters, too, but the key prediction is that one or both reconstruction parameters ought to be affected if the working explanation is correct.\nWe evaluated this prediction in three experiments in which attribute ambiguity and attribute intensity were manipulated factorially. They followed the multi-trial methodology that has been previously used to identify memory effects of attribute ambiguity. This multi-trial procedure is required to implement the dual-retrieval model. As the model contains six parameters, experiments with three separate trials are the minimum designs that generate sufficient degrees of freedom to estimate all the parameters and compute goodness-of-fit tests (see Brainerd et\u00a0al., 2009).\nIn Experiment 2, the target attribute was meaningfulness. Subjects learned to recall lists of words on which the items were high or low in normed values of SDs for meaningfulness intensity ratings and were high or low in normed values of the Ms of those ratings. We located two previously reported experiments of the same type that had produced robust ambiguity effects for two other attributes (categorization and concreteness) but had not been analyzed with the dual-retrieval model. We conducted a retrospective modeling analysis of those studies (Experiments 3 and 4) so that any conclusions about the retrieval effects of attribute ambiguity would cut across multiple attributes and be grounded in a large amount of data.\nOur focus in Experiments 2\u20134 was squarely on using the dual-retrieval model to explain how ambiguity enhances recall by pinpointing its retrieval locus. A secondary objective was to determine whether that locus was the same as the\ncorresponding one for the effects of attribute intensity. It is sensible that it should be, for two reasons. First, as noted, it has been previously reported for attributes such as concreteness and imagery that variations in attribute intensity affect reconstructive retrieval. Second, for any specific attribute, variations in intensity and ambiguity involve variations in the same semantic features."

The pool of words from which the items on the lists that were administered to individual subjects were sampled was constructed in such a way that their meaningfulness ambiguities varied from high to low and their meaningfulness intensities varied from high to low. Each subject studied and recalled two lists of 36 words (nine high ambiguity/high intensity, nine high ambiguity/low intensity, nine low ambiguity/high intensity, and nine low ambiguity/low intensity). Thus, each list that was administered to individual subjects had a 2 (meaningfulness ambiguity: high vs. low) \u00d7 2 (meaningfulness intensity: high vs. low) factorial structure. Over lists, items\u2019 mean intensities were MI = 8.8 (high) and 4.6 (low), and their mean ambiguities were MA = 4.1 (high) and 2.7 (low). Each list was composed of 36 words, and the differences between the high and low MAs and the high and low MIs over the lists were highly reliable (all ps < .0001 by t tests). The differences in MAs and MIs were uncorrelated; that is, the high and low MA conditions did not differ reliably in MIs, and conversely.\nIn Experiment 3, the word lists that were administered to individual subjects were constructed in the same way, using the Toglia and Battig (1978) norms, except that the word pool\nfrom which they were sampled was derived from subjects\u2019 ratings of concreteness. Thus, each subject studied and recalled two lists of 36 words, for which the list design was 2 (concreteness ambiguity: high vs. low) \u00d7 2 (concreteness intensity: high vs. low). Over lists, the mean intensities were MI = 5.3 (high) and 3.1 (low), and the mean ambiguities were MA = 2.2 (high) and 1.6 (low) on the 1\u20137 concreteness scale. The intensity and ambiguity differences were highly reliable (all ps < .001 by t tests), and the differences were uncorrelated.\nIn Experiment 4, the word lists that were administered to individual subjects were constructed in the same way, using the Toglia and Battig (1978) norms, except the word pool from which they were sampled was based on subjects\u2019 ratings of categorization. Thus, each subject studied and recalled two lists of 36 words, for which the list design was 2 (categorization ambiguity: high vs. low) \u00d7 2 (categorization intensity: high vs. low). Over lists, the mean intensities were MI = 5.5 (high) and 3.1 (low), and the mean ambiguities were MA = 2.0 (high) and 1.6 (low) on the 1\u20137 categorization SD scale. The intensity and ambiguity differences were highly reliable (all ps < .0001 by t tests), and the differences were uncorrelated.\nA final consideration about the materials is a point that Pollock (2018) raised in connection with word lists that have been used to manipulate M intensity in prior studies of the concreteness attribute. Pollock listed five linguistic variables that tended to be correlated with M intensity differences in those experiments and, hence, might have produced the observed memory effects: word frequency, age of acquisition, number of phonemes, word length, and number of syllables. Neath and Surprenant (2020 , Experiment 1) controlled all these variables in a recall study in which concreteness rating SDs and M concreteness ratings were manipulated factorially. Recall was not affected by either rating SDs or M ratings. Consequently, we analyze the word pools for our three experiments for each of the above linguistic variables, using WordMine2 (Durda & Buchanan, 2006). We found that these five variables were not reliable predictors of differences in words ambiguity or intensity ratings. In each experiment, we tested the null hypotheses that this set of variables did not differ reliably for words with high versus low attribute ambiguity scores and did not differ reliably for words with high versus low attribute intensity scores. In each case, the core analysis was a 2 (attribute ambiguity: high vs. low ambiguity words) \u00d7 2 (attribute intensity: high vs. low intensity words) \u00d7 5 (linguistic variables: age of acquisition, frequency, length, number of phonemes, number of syllables) mixed ANOVA. The main effect for attribute ambiguity tested the first null hypothesis, and the main effect for attribute intensity tested the second. Neither of those main effects was significant in any of the three experiments. The statistical details of these analyses can be found in Appendix Tables\u00a011 and 12.\n1 3"

Next, the subject participated in the first phase of the experiment, which consisted of three study-buffer-test trials on List 1. This was followed by a second phase in which three studybuffer-test trials on List 2 were administered. During the first phase, the study cycle of each trial consisted of presenting the 36 words individually on the screen, with the subject being instructed to read the words silently as they were presented. Individual words were presented in random order at a 3-s rate, centered in 36-pt black font. After the last word had been presented, the subject performed a 45-s buffer task, which consisted of typing answers to simple arithmetic problems that appeared on the screen. The buffer task was followed by a 1-min free-recall test. The subject was instructed to type as many words as could be remembered from the list in any order. The subject was also told that accurate spelling was not required for responses to be counted as correct. Misspellings were rare, and when they occurred, it was obvious that they referred to one of the words on this list. After the first recall test was completed, the second trial of study-buffer-test began. The procedure for the second trial was identical to the procedure for the first trial. After the second recall test was completed, the third trial of study-buffer-test began, and it followed the same procedure as the first two trials.\nFollowing the third recall test, there was a 1-min rest period before the second phase of the experiment. The second phase began with instructions that explained the upcoming procedure. The subject then participated in three trials of study-buffer-test on List 2. The procedure for these three trials was identical to the procedure for the three trials of the first phase."

Panels A, C, and E on the left side of Fig.\u00a02 depict the ambiguity effects for meaningfulness, concreteness, and categorization, respectively. It is obvious at a glance that recall was better when attribute ambiguity was high than when it was low, on all three trials and regardless of attribute. Panels B, D, and F on the right side depict the corresponding intensity effects for these attributes. Except for Trial 1 in Panel B, it can be seen that recall was better when attribute intensity was high than when it was low, on all trials for all attributes.\nTurning to statistical tests of these patterns, we computed a 2 (attribute ambiguity: high vs. low) \u00d7 2 (attribute intensity: high vs. low) \u00d7 3 (trial: 1, 2, 3) ANOVA of the proportions of\u00a0correct recall in each experiment, for the pooled data of Lists 1 and 2.

Post hoc analysis revealed what is obvious in Fig.\u00a02: The meaningfulness intensity effect was larger on Trials 2 and 3 than on Trial 1, and indeed, the intensity effect was not reliable on Trial 1. Turning to Experiment 3, there were main effects for concreteness ambiguity, F(1, 67) = 93.64, MSE = .02, \u03b7p2 = .58, p < .001, concreteness intensity, F(1, 67) = 83.39, MSE = .03, \u03b7p2 = .55, p < .0001, and trial, F(2, 134) = 575.39, MSE = .01, \u03b7p2 = .90, p < .001. There was no Ambiguity \u00d7 Intensity interaction, and neither attribute factor interacted with the trial factor.

            "text": "The results of principal interest involved fitting the dualretrieval model to the data of these experiments and estimating its parameters for the various conditions. Statistical procedures for this model are provided in Gomes et\u00a0al. (2014). Briefly, the following steps are involved in fitting the model in Table\u00a05 to the data of all the conditions of an experiment. The individual words on each list that the subjects learned\n1 3\nto recall generate a data space with eight distinct patterns of errors and successes: C1C2C3, C1C2E3, \u2026, E1E2E3, where Ci denotes a correct recall on the ith test,, and Ei denotes an error. When probabilities are attached to these patterns, there are seven independent probabilities for each of the four conditions of each experiment (2 levels of attribute ambiguity \u00d7 2 of attribute intensity). This means that the model in Table\u00a05 is fit to the data of each condition with one degree of freedom: There are seven free probabilities in the data space versus six probabilities (parameters) in the model.\nThe fit test runs as follows. The likelihood of the data is estimated with all probabilities free to vary, and then it is re-estimated with only the model\u2019s parameters free to vary. Twice the negative natural log of the ratio of these likelihoods is a G2(1) statistic with a critical value of 3.84 to reject the null hypothesis that the model fits the target data. If this null hypothesis cannot be rejected for the conditions of an experiment, the model\u2019s parameters are then estimated and can be compared to determine if they differ reliably between conditions. These between-condition significance tests for parameters also involve computing a pair of likelihoods\n\u2013 one in which all the model\u2019s parameters are completely free to vary in both target conditions and a second in which one of the model\u2019s parameters is constrained to be equal in the two conditions. The likelihood ratio statistics is G2(1), with a 3.84 critical value to reject the null hypothesis that the parameter has the same value in the two conditions.\nFirst, we computed the model fit tests for the conditions of these experiments, using the 2 (attribute ambiguity) \u00d7 2 (attribute intensity) factorial structure pooled over the three trials as the four conditions of each experiment. The mean values of the four G2(1) fit tests for each experiment were 2.02 (Experiment 2, meaningfulness), 3.38 (Experiment 3, concreteness), and .56 (Experiment 4, categorization). As a value of 3.84 is required to reject the null hypothesis of fit, this hypothesis could not be rejected in any of the experiments, and hence, we estimated the retrieval parameters for the four list conditions for each of the experiments. The results are shown in Table\u00a06. There, the parameter values are organized by retrieval process, with the values for direct verbatim access blocked in columns 1 and 2, the values for\n1 3\nreconstruction blocked in columns 3 and 4, and the values for familiarity judgment blocked in columns 5 and 6.\nThe focal question is where, at the level of retrieval processes, the effects of attribute ambiguity are localized \u2013 reconstruction, direct verbatim access, or familiarity judgment. Recall that our working explanation predicts that it will be a reconstruction effect; that it will be easier\u00a0to learn how to reconstruct list items from their semantic content when rating SDs are high than when they are low because attribute features are more thoroughly processed for highSD items. Scanning down the paired columns in Table\u00a06, a consistent finding was that ambiguity affected reconstructive retrieval \u2013 specifically, the R1 parameter, which measures the proportion of items that can be reconstructed after the first study cycle. Over the three attributes, that proportion was .37 when rating SDs were high and .27 when they were low, a highly reliable difference. Attribute ambiguity did not have a reliable effect on R2, which measures the proportion of items that can be reconstructed after two or more study cycles.\nThese results yield a simple account of how attribute ambiguity enhances recall. Prior research on the dual-retrieval model indicates that words differ substantially in how easy it is to learn to reconstruct them from their semantic features on\nrecall tests. For some, a single study trial is all that is needed to learn a search algorithm that will reconstruct them, whereas others require multiple trials. The two reconstruction parameters are sensitive to this difference: R1 can be interpreted as the proportion of list items that are easier to learn how to reconstruct, and R2 can be interpreted as the proportion that are harder to learn to reconstruct (Brainerd et\u00a0al., 2014). (Some items can never be reconstructed, and that proportion is 1 \u2013 R1 - (1- R1)R2 - (1- R1)(1-R2)R2 in these experiments.) Thus, the primary effect of the ambiguity manipulation in all these experiments was to enlarge the subset of easier-to-reconstruct items, while not affecting the subset of harder-to-reconstruct items. Based on the grand means of R1 for these experiments, the easier-to-reconstruct subset was more than one-third larger when rating SDs were high, relative to when they were low.\nAttribute ambiguity also produced some reliable effects on other retrieval processes, but they were not consistent across experiments. With respect to direct verbatim access, ambiguity affected one of the two D parameters for both concreteness and categorization but not the same one, and it did not affect either D parameter for meaningfulness. With respect to familiarity judgment, ambiguity affected one of the two J parameters for concreteness, but it did not affect either of them for meaningfulness or categorization.\nTurning to attribute intensity, because differences in M intensity ratings are concerned with the same semantic features as differences in rating SDs, the theoretical expectation is that the retrieval loci of their effects should be similar. That assumption proved to be correct. Intensity consistently affected reconstructive retrieval \u2013 in particular, high intensity increased R1 but not R2, relative to low intensity, for all three attributes. Theoretically, then, attribute intensity also increases the subset of easier-to-reconstruct items without affecting the subset of harder-to-reconstruct items. This similar retrieval effect for intensity could not have been due to correlations between the M intensity and rating SD manipulations because, as mentioned, they were uncorrelated in the lists that were administered in these experiments. Also similar to ambiguity, intensity did not produce consistent effects for direct verbatim access or familiarity judgment. With respect to the D parameters, D2 was significantly larger for high-intensity items in two of the experiments but not in the third. With respect to the J parameters, intensity had a reliable effect on J1 in Experiment 2 and a reliable effect on J2 in Experiment 3, but the effects ran in opposite directions.\nSumming up, the dual-retrieval analyses converge on the conclusion that the ambiguity of these three semantic attributes affects reconstructive retrieval, and it does so in a specific way.\nWhen one increases normed values of the ambiguity of attributes\u2019 perceived intensity, the total number of items that can be reconstructed increases. Moreover, this increase occurs because the size of the subset of easier-to-reconstruct items expands while the size of the subset of harder-to-reconstruct items remains invariant.\nBy way of qualification, it should be noted that all the ambiguity and intensity effects that were observed in Experiments 2\u20134 were detected in mixed-list designs. In the literature, there is an established pattern in which various list manipulations are more likely to produce memory effects with mixed-list designs than with pure-list designs (see Gomes et\u00a0al., 2013, for a discussion of this point in connection with valence). Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the ambiguity and intensity effects that we reported will also be detected in pure-list experiments."

            "text": "Rating norms for words\u2019 semantic attributes have been used to manipulate the types of meaning that subjects encode in a wide range of memory paradigms. Those manipulations have centered on varying attributes\u2019 average perceived intensities, as indexed by words\u2019 M intensity ratings (e.g., Citron et\u00a0al., 2014; Mikels et\u00a0al. 2005a; Mikels et\u00a0al. 2005b). It is well established that such intensity manipulations produce robust memory effects for attributes such as arousal, concreteness,\nfamiliarity, and valence. Recently, evidence has accumulated that a second property, the level of ambiguity that attaches to attributes\u2019 perceived intensity, produces separate memory effects. However, some fundamental questions remain about the normed quantity that is used to manipulate ambiguity (rating SDs). We investigated two of them: Is this quantity a valid measure of ambiguity? Which retrieval processes are affected when this quantity is varied?\nThe validity question was investigated for six attributes that have long histories in the memory literature (arousal, concreteness, familiarity, meaningfulness, negative valence, and positive valence). We normed separate word pools for these attributes in the traditional way, using lower \u2192 higher intensity rating scales, and subjects also rated their degree of certainty that words\u2019 intensity ratings were accurate. In addition, we normed these word pools for the latencies of words\u2019 intensity ratings. Those norms are provided in the Appendix.\nWe computed concurrent validity correlations between words\u2019 rating SDs and the M certainty of words\u2019 intensity ratings. To provide further evidence of validity, we computed predictive validity correlations between words\u2019 rating SDs and the M latencies of words\u2019 intensity ratings. We also computed predictive validity correlations between the M certainty of words\u2019 intensity ratings and the M latencies of words\u2019 intensity ratings. All those results converged on the conclusion that attribute rating SDs measure the ambiguity of attributes\u2019 perceived intensities.\nNext, we investigated the retrieval question in recall experiments with three different semantic attributes. We used the data of experiments in which the rating SDs and M ratings of those attributes were manipulated factorially to pinpoint the retrieval loci of ambiguity\u2019s effects on recall and compare them to the retrieval loci of intensity\u2019s effects. The high-low SD manipulation had a specific retrieval effect across all attributes: The pool of items that subjects learned to reconstruct was roughly one-third larger when their rating SDs were high rather than low. That pattern was predicted by the working explanation of why ambiguity enhances recall, which posits that uncertainty about attribute intensity triggers more thorough encoding of words\u2019 semantic features. Importantly, the retrieval locus of the effects of the high-low intensity manipulation was the same as that of the highlow ambiguity manipulation, which also was anticipated on theoretical grounds. However, the two manipulations did not interact in two of the three experiments.\nIn closing, an important remaining question is concerned with conceptual differences between attribute ambiguity and more traditional notions of ambiguity. Customarily, we say that a word is ambiguous when (a) its meaning is unfamiliar, or (b) we know that it has multiple salient meanings. For example, most people are not aware that insouciant means indifferent and moiety means half, but most people know that toast has two salient meanings (bread, speech) and so does bank (money, river).\n1 3\nBoth these forms of uncertainty are concerned with a word\u2019s semantic content as a whole, whereas attribute ambiguity is a componential form of uncertainty that targets a specific property (intensity) of a specific semantic attribute (e.g., concreteness, valence). Attribute ambiguity can be present at high levels notwithstanding that a word is familiar and that it does not have multiple salient meanings. For instance, angel, gravity, unicorn, and vampire are all familiar and none has multiple salient meanings, but the uncertainty of their perceived concreteness levels is very high (all rating SDs > 2 on a 7-point rating scale).\nAlthough attribute ambiguity is conceptually distinct from these traditional forms of ambiguity, it might be strongly correlated with them. Indeed, a plausible hypothesis is that uncertainty about a word\u2019s meaning, either because it is unfamiliar or it has multiple meanings, would drive up uncertainty about the intensity of specific semantic attributes and, thus, produce strong correlations between their respective measures. This hypothesis leads to two obvious predictions that can be used to test it. The first is that words\u2019 overall familiarity levels will be well correlated with words\u2019 rating SDs for individual semantic attributes. The second is that relative to words that do not have multiple meanings, words that do (toast, bank) should display elevated rating SDs for individual semantic attributes. We tested both these predictions, and neither proved to be accurate.\nThe first prediction was evaluated by correlating attribute rating SDs with word familiarity measures, using published attribute rating norms. Two intuitive measures of word familiarity are available to conduct such tests: (a) familiarity ratings of words on lower \u2192 higher scales and (b) word frequencies in printed text and spoken language. The most extensive sources of evidence on both measures are the Toglia and Battig (1978) and Scott et\u00a0al. (2019) norms, in which subjects rated familiarity and several other attributes for thousands of words. We added word frequencies to both norms, using the Wordmine2 database (Durda & Buchanan, 2006). We computed the predictive validity correlations between each of the familiarity measures and the rating SDs of six attributes in the Toglia-Battig norms and the rating SDs of eight other attributes in the Scott et\u00a0al norms. The results appear in Table\u00a07.\nThese validity correlations do not provide support for the notion that attribute ambiguity increases as words\u2019 meanings become more unfamiliar. If that were true, the coefficients would be large and negative; instead, they are mostly very small, accounting for an average of 1% of the variance. Further, one-third of them are positive, with the two strongest ones (for the SDs of meaningfulness and number of features in the Toglia-Battig norms) being positive. In short, the relations between words\u2019 judged familiarity and their frequency in the lexicon, on the one hand, and the rating SDs of several semantic attributes, on the other, are weak and inconsistent.\nWe conducted a similar validity analysis for the prediction that attribute ambiguity will be greater for words with multiple\nsalient meanings using data from the Scott et\u00a0al. (2019) norms. The 5,553 words in those norms includes a subsample of 379 words that each have two salient meanings (e.g., bank, figure, live, medium, toast). We computed the rating SDs of the nine rated attributes separately for these multiple-meaning words versus the remaining 5,174 words. The prediction, of course, is that for all nine attributes, the mean rating SDs of the multiple-meaning words will be higher than the mean rating SDs of other words. To test that prediction, using rating SDs as the dependent variable, we computed a 2 (word ambiguity: multiple-meaning words vs. other words) \u00d7 9 (rated attribute) ANOVA. The key result is the main effect for word ambiguity, which should be significant if multiple meanings increase attribute ambiguity. It was not significant, however; the rating SDs of multiple-meaning words did not differ reliably from the rating SDs of other words.\nTo conclude, beyond the results in Experiments 1\u20134, it seems that the normed quantitative measure of attribute ambiguity is empirically distinct from more traditional conceptions of semantic ambiguity. The data that were just reported reveal that attribute ambiguity is unrelated to either the familiarity or multiple-meanings conception of ambiguity: There was no evidence of strong negative correlations between rating SDs and words\u2019 rated familiarity or words\u2019 objective frequency in linguistic usage, and there was no evidence that rating SDs are higher for words with multiple salient meanings.\nA pp\nen di\nx\nTa bl\ne 8\nA ro\nus al\n(A RO\nU ) a\nnd C\non cr\net en\nes s (\nCO N\n) I nt\nen si\nty , L\nat en\ncy , a\nnd C\ner ta\nin ty\nN or\nm s\nA R\nO C\nO N\nW or\nd M\nR at\nin g\nSD R\nat in\ng M\nR at -

The purpose of each ANOVA was to determine whether this set of linguistic variables differed reliability as a function of attribute ambiguity or intensity. F(ambiguity) is the omnibus test of whether the linguistic variables differed as a function of attribute intensity, and p(ambiguity) is its significance level. F(intensity) is the omnibus test of whether the linguistic variables differed as a function of attribute intensity, and p(intensity) is its significance level\nTable 12 Values of five linguistic
