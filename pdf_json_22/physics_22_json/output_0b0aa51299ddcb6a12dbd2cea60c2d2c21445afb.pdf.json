INTRODUCTION\nThe isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a chain was the first exactly solved many-body problem.1 Three decades later, Orbach,2 and later Yang and Yang, 3,4 succeeded to generalize the Bethe Ansatz to the onedimensional anisotropic Heisenberg (or XXZ) model,\nH\u0302XXZ(\u2206) = \u2212 1\n2\nL\u22121\u2211\nl=1\n[ \u03c3x l \u00b7 \u03c3x l+1 + \u03c3y l \u00b7 \u03c3y l+1 +\u2206\u03c3z l \u00b7 \u03c3z l+1 ] ,\n(1) where \u03c3x,y,z\nl are the Pauli matrices on site l and \u2206 \u2264 0 is\nthe anisotropy parameter for antiferromagnetic coupling. The XXZ model reduces to the Ising model in the limit of strong anisotropy in the z-direction, |\u2206| \u2192 \u221e. Since the 1960s, many exact results for the model in the thermodynamic limit were established, e.g., the ground-state energy,3,4 the elementary spinon excitations,5\u20138 and the staggered magnetization in the Ising regime, |\u2206| \u2265 1,9,10 to name a few. An efficient exact description of the thermodynamic properties was achieved by Klu\u0308mper.11\nStarting from the early 1990s12 the focus of the exact calculations shifted to the reduced density matrix which was fully characterized in the following decade.13\u201318 This made it possible to derive a number of spin correlation functions analytically, see, e.g., Refs. [19\u201321]. Most recently, fully explicit series representations for the exact dynamical spin correlation functions and the spin conductivity were obtained in the Ising regime.22,23 Therefore, the XXZ model belongs to the best studied and\nunderstood many-particle systems.\nVia a Jordan-Wigner transformation, the antiferromagnetic XXZ model on a chain with \u2206 \u2264 0 and zero magnetization maps onto a model for spinless fermions with open boundary conditions at half band-filling with nearest-neighbor electron transfer amplitude (\u2212t) and repulsive interaction V = \u2212\u2206/(2t) \u2265 0.24 While the XXZ model contains a transition to an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state at the Heisenberg point, \u2206 = \u22121, the model for spinless fermions displays a metal-insulator transition at Vc = 2t from a Luttinger liquid to a chargedensity wave (CDW) insulator.\nA transition at finite interaction strength is unexpected because the nesting instability would place the transition at V (1) c = 0+, and it requires a sophisticated renormalization group treatment to show that the system is marginally stable against the formation of a CDW at weak coupling.25,26 The same result can be obtained using bosonization, see Ref. [27] for an introduction. To complicate matters, the single-particle gap and the order parameter display an essential singularity at Vc, i.e., they open exponentially as a function of 1/ \u221a V \u2212 Vc, as is characteristic for a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.28 Consequently, it is notoriously difficult to determine the critical interaction strength for the transition using approximate analytical and numerical approaches. Transitions of Kosterlitz-Thouless type are common in one-dimensional quantum systems such as in the bosonic Hubbard model, see e.g., Ref. [29], or quantum spin chains, see, e.g., Ref. [30].\n2 Since spinless fermions represent a rare case of an exactly solvable model with a metal-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength, it is desirable to see if and how well approximate methods are able to reproduce the formation of CDW order at Vc = 2t. As our analytical approximations we use Hartree-Fock theory and second-order perturbation theory around it.31,32 Firstorder Hartree-Fock theory suggests a CDW for all finite interaction strengths, V (1) c = 0+, corresponding to the nesting instability. As we shall show in this work, second-order Hartree-Fock approximation predicts a discontinuous transition at V (2) c,2 \u2248 1.5 with a jump in the order parameter and concomitant discontinuities in physical quantities. As numerical approach, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method33\u201335 that provides highly accurate data for finite rings with up to L = 514 sites; we choose periodic boundary conditions and even L/2 for an open-shell ground state to reduce finite-size effects. To make contact with finite-size corrections calculated for the XXZ model from Bethe Ansatz, we also investigate odd L/2. We identify two successful strategies to locate accurately the CDW transition. The first route monitors the breakdown of the metallic phase. The properties of the Luttinger liquid are reflected in finite-size corrections to the ground-state energy and the gap, and most prominently in the Luttinger parameter that determines the momentum distribution close to the Fermi points and the small-momentum limit of the density-density correlation function. In the end, the accurate calculation of the Luttinger parameter permits to locate the breakdown of the Luttinger liquid with an accuracy of three percent. Following an alternative route, we trace the maximum of the quasi-particle distribution as a function of system size and interaction. Using this independent approach, we determine the critical interaction strength with an accuracy of one percent. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we define the model Hamiltonian for spinless fermions. We discuss its relation to the XXZ model for various boundary conditions and particle numbers. In Sect. III we put together exact results from the literature for the ground-state energy, the nearest-neighbor single-particle density matrix, the single-particle gap, and the charge-density wave order parameter in the thermodynamic limit. Since this information is often phrased for the XXZ model and is not summarized in reviews or books, we find it useful to compose them here for spinless fermions. Limiting cases are derived and discussed in the supplemental material36 (see, also, references [37 and 38] therein). In Sect. IV we present the standard (first-order) Hartree-Fock approximation for spinless fermions. This permits us to introduce the lower and upper Hartree-Fock bands in the reduced Brillouin zone and the corresponding quasi-particle operators. In Sect. V we calculate the second-order weak-coupling perturbation correction to the Hartree-Fock approximation, and justify its applicability to all interaction strengths. Technicalities for the second-order HartreeFock calculations can be found in the supplemental material.36 In Sect. VI we compare approximate results with those from the exact Bethe-Ansatz solutions. We focus on the issue how to obtain the critical interaction strength for the charge-density wave transition from finite-size DMRG data. Short conclusions, Sect. VII, close our presentation."

(7)\n3 In the following we shall focus on the case of half bandfilling, where the number of fermions N equals half the number of lattice sites, N = L/2, and use t \u2261 1 as our energy unit. The bare bandwidth is W = 4.\nB. XXZ Heisenberg model\nThe model for spinless fermions in one dimension can be transformed into the XXZ Heisenberg model using a Jordan-Wigner transformation. For the moment, let us assume open boundary conditions. On a chain, the XXZ model is given by eq. (1). Using spin operators,\nS\u0302x,y,zl = 1\n2 \u03c3x,y,z l ,\nS\u0302+l = S\u0302 x l + iS\u0302 y l , S\u0302\u2212l = S\u0302 x l \u2212 iS\u0302yl , (8)\nthe XXZ Heisenberg model reads\nH\u0302XXZ(\u2206) = \u2212 L\u22121\u2211\nl=1\n[ S\u0302+l S\u0302 \u2212 l+1 + S\u0302 + l+1S\u0302 \u2212 l ] \u22122\u2206 L\u22121\u2211\nl=1\nS\u0302zl S\u0302 z l+1 .\n(9) Note that spin operators on different lattice sites commute with each other. The Pauli particle operators\nb\u0302+l = S\u0302 + l ,\nb\u0302l = S\u0302 \u2212 l ,\nn\u0302bl = b\u0302 + l b\u0302l = S\u0302 z l +\n1 2 (10)\nobey fermionic anticommutation relations between operators on the same site but bosonic commutation relations between different sites. This deficiency is cured by the Jordan-Wigner transformation,24,39\nc\u0302+l = exp\n( i\u03c0 l\u22121\u2211\nk=1\nn\u0302bk ) b\u0302+l ,\nc\u0302l = exp\n( \u2212i\u03c0 l\u22121\u2211\nk=1\nn\u0302bk ) b\u0302l ,\nn\u0302l = c\u0302 + l c\u0302l = b\u0302 + l b\u0302l = n\u0302 b l . (11)\nTherefore, the XXZ Heisenberg model can be written in terms of spinless fermions as\nH\u0302XXZ(\u2206) = \u2212 L\u22121\u2211\nl=1\n( c\u0302+l c\u0302l+1 + c\u0302 + l+1c\u0302l )\n\u22122\u2206 L\u22121\u2211\nl=1\n( n\u0302l \u2212 1\n2\n)( n\u0302l+1 \u2212 1\n2\n) (12)\nwhen open boundary conditions are employed. Thus, the equivalence reads\nH\u0302XXZ(\u2212V/2) = H\u0302(V )\u2212 V N\u0302 + V L\n4 . (13)\nEq. (13) permits to translate exact results for the antiferromagnetic XXZ model H\u0302XXZ(\u2206 \u2264 0) to the model of spinless fermions for V \u2265 0 for open boundary conditions. For the case of periodic boundary conditions, an additional boundary term arises,39\nH\u0302pbcXXZ(\u2206) = \u2212 L\u2211\nl=1\n( c\u0302+l c\u0302l+1 + c\u0302 + l+1c\u0302l )\n\u22122\u2206 L\u2211\nl=1\n( n\u0302l \u2212 1\n2\n)( n\u0302l+1 \u2212 1\n2\n)\n+ ( c\u0302+L c\u03021 + c\u0302 + 1 c\u0302L ) ( exp(i\u03c0N\u0302 ) + 1 ) . (14)\nTherefore, a comparison of Bethe Ansatz results for the periodic XXZ model with those for spinless fermions on a ring are only possible in the thermodynamic limit, or, when finite-size corrections are addressed, for situations where the particle number N is odd. For the ground state at half band-filling it implies that L/2 must be odd. For excitations from the half-filled ground state we must study the sector with two particle or two hole excitations, N = L/2\u00b1 2."

An extra fermion added to the half-filled system leads to three fermions in a row and thus to two nearest-neighbor interactions with an excitation energy of 2V . The transfer of particles between neighboring sites results in the free motion of domain walls to the right and left. Therefore, the first correction term to the single-particle is twice the bandwidth, namely W = 4 for each domain wall."

Consequently, the critical interaction can be deduced from monitoring K(V ) or \u03b1(V ) in the Luttinger-liquid phase. The Luttinger exponent can also be extracted from the long-range decay of the single-particle correlation function in position space.44 The most reliable way to extract\nK(V ) is provided by the analysis of the density-density correlation function in the limit of long wave lengths,45 see Sect.

IVD. Eq. (52) shows that the structure factor diverges algebraically for |q| \u2192 \u03c0, with logarithmic corrections for all V > 0 where K(V ) < 1. In the charge-density wave insulator, C\u0303NN(|q| = \u03c0, V > Vc) is finite. Note that contributions from the long-range order are subtracted in the definition of CNN(r).

However, it turns out that, even for V = 2.5, it requires system sizes much larger than L = 512 to observe the saturation of SNN\u03c0 (L, V = 2.5).

For fixed na and B0, the second-order Hartree-Fock energy provides a systematic energy correction for weak interactions. Apparently, one would rather minimize the full energy expression including the second-order term to optimize the parameters B0 and na (\u2018second-order Hartree-Fock approximation\u2019). Before we shall follow this route, we give some arguments how this approach can be justified. In fact, the optimal second-order Hartree-Fock energy does not necessarily provide a true variational bound for all interaction strengths but corrections are small in the limit n\u03b2(V ) \u226a 1/2 which is the case for spinless fermions in one dimension for all V where n\u03b2(Vmax) \u2248 0.01, see Sect.

This is justified in weak coupling when the amplitudes \u03a6m \u221d V are small, or when the density of excitations is small for all V , as is the case for spinless fermions in one dimension. At the same level of approximation, we must replace E0 by E HF 0 to find\n( EHF0 \u2212 EHFn ) \u03a6\u0303n = \u3008n|V\u0302\u22a5|0\u3009 , (118)\nwhich gives \u03a6\u0303n from second-order perturbation theory with respect to the Hartree-Fock approximation,\n\u03a6\u0303n = \u3008n|V\u0302\u22a5|0\u3009\nEHF0 \u2212 EHFn , (119)\nso that we recover eq. (101) that was the basis of our considerations. To be consistent, we had to approximate N(\u03c80) \u2248 1. While N(\u03c80) \u2248 1 is guaranteed for small interaction strengths, this is not obvious for large interactions. In the SD approximation, we have\nN(\u03c8SD0 ) = 1 + 1\n2 n\u03b2(V ) . (120)\nNow that n\u03b2(V ) \u226a 1 for all interactions, corrections due to the norm term are small. For the same reason, the last term in eq. (117) is small because it describes the scattering between dilute quasi-particle excitations. In sum, a meaningful second-order perturbation theory around the Hartree-Fock solution requires dilute quasiparticle excitations above the Hartree-Fock ground-state. For spinless fermions in one dimension, the condition n\u03b2(V ) \u226a 1 is fulfilled for all interaction strengths, and the ground-state energy obeys an \u2018almost-variational\u2019 property."

The correlation energy displays a maximum as a function of the interaction strength. However, its position is not identical to the critical interaction.

The agreement is very good, and permits to locate the transition from the criterion c(V = Vc) = \u2212\u03c02/6 \u2248 \u22121.64493. A comparison with the extrapolated numerical data gives V ec = 2.02, within about one percent of the exact value.\nNote that this very good result is based on several facts. First, the logarithmic corrections in eq. (144) are known analytically. This decisively stabilizes the extrapolation of c(V ). Second, the value for the maximal velocity uc = \u03c0 is used as input. Therefore, a lot of intelligence from conformal field theory and from Bethe Ansatz enters the analysis. Thus, in less fortunate circumstances, the scaling of the ground-state energy in 1/L cannot be used to locate the quantum phase transition."

System sizes with an even particle number N = L/2 lead to an open-shell ground state at V = 0, i.e., it is doubly degenerate. Therefore, the gap is exactly zero at V = 0 in the absence of a symmetry-breaking term. In this way, systems with even L/2 minimize finite-size effects for small couplings. In Fig. 5 we show the extrapolated single-particle gap as a function of V from the polynomial fit together with the exact result from Bethe Ansatz, see eq. (34). The polynomial fit leads to a (very small) finite gap for all V > 0, and the sharp transition in the exact solution at Vc = 2 is smeared out, as seen from the inset in Fig. 5, so that it is not possible to determine Vc with high accuracy from the extrapolated gaps. The standard polynomial extrapolation scheme does not permit to locate transitions at finite interaction strengths.

II B, these Bethe Ansatz results can be applied to the model of spinless fermions only for odd particle numbers. Consequently, we have to study a closed-shell ground state at half band-filling with odd particle number N = L/2. Now that the excited state must also have an odd particle number, we must numerically study the ground state with two additional particles, N = L/2 + 2. In the XXZ model, the two spin-1 excitations are very far from each other for large system sizes and we argue that the two-particle gap \u2206XXZ2 (L, V ) = 2 ( EXXZ0 (S = 2, L, V )\u2212 E0(S = 0, L, V ) ) (149) is twice as large as the single-particle gap in the thermodynamic limit,\n\u2206XXZ1 (L, V ) = \u2206XXZ2 (L, V )\n2 +O(1/L\u03b3) , (150)\nwhere corrections due the interaction of the excitations are of order 1/L\u03b3 with \u03b3 > 1.

VIA2, nk,\u03b1/\u03b2 describes the occupation numbers for the natural orbitals that we identify with the lower (k, \u03b1) and upper (k, \u03b2) Hartree-Fock bands. We show the quasi-particle distribution from DMRG in Fig. 12(a) and from second-order Hartree-Fock theory in Fig. 12(b). For V < Vc the DMRG data in Fig. 12(a) display a maximum at the band edges whereas in the insulating phase there are two maxima. Therefore, the onset of two maxima indicates the CDW transition, and a first estimate for the critical interaction strength can be deduced from the finite-size data, V tmc \u2248 2.15. The inset shows that the second-order results are in quantitative agreement with those from DMRG at weak coupling, V = 0.8, which serves as a significant consistency check for both methods. As seen from a comparison of the main Figs. 12(a) and (b), the agreement between DMRG and second-order Hartree-Fock rapidly deteriorates for larger interactions, V & 1. Even in the limit of strong interactions, the second-order HartreeFock approximation does not reproduce the DMRG data for the quasi-particle distribution. Although the curves look similar, they substantially differ quantitatively, by a factor of ten and more for V & 2. In essence, HartreeFock theory severely underestimates the total density of quasi-particle excitations n\u03b2(V ) defined in eq. (108). To see this in more detail, we show the density of quasi-particle excitations n\u03b2(V ) as a function of the in-\n22\nteraction V in Fig. 13. It is seen that the second-order Hartree-Fock theory is reliable only for V . 1. The quasi-particle density in Hartree-Fock theory displays a maximum just before and a jump discontinuity right at V (2) c,2 \u2248 1.5, in agreement with the results in Sect. VE. This observation indicates that n\u03b2(V ) is a sensitive quantity to locate the CDW transition. Moreover, we see that n (2) \u03b2 (V ) < 0.011 so that the condition for a dilute gas of quasi-particles, n (2) \u03b2 (V ) \u226a 1/2 is always fulfilled. Therefore, second-order Hartree-Fock theory is applicable for all interaction strength and is \u2018almost variational\u2019, see Sect. VB.\nThe DMRG data for the quasi-particle density in Fig. 13 show that n\u03b2(V ) < 0.035, i.e., it is never more than seven percent of its maximal value of one half. Therefore, the system can be viewed as a vacuum state with a dilute gas of quasi-particle excitations, even though second-order Hartree-Fock theory is not sufficient for its description beyond weak interactions.\nAs seen in Fig. 13, the quasi-particle density is maximal close to the critical interaction strength, Vc = 2, so that we could use the maximum of the quasi-particle density to locate the exact CDW transition from a finite-size extrapolation. It turns out, however, that the finite-size scaling is logarithmic which limits the accuracy to several percent. To determine Vc more accurately, we recall that\nna(V ) = 1\nL\n\u2211\nk\u2208RBZ\n( \u3008a\u0302+k a\u0302k+\u03c0\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a\u0302+k+\u03c0a\u0302k\u3009 ) . (159)\nThe exponential behavior of na(V ) close to the transition implies that most terms in the sum have a logarithmic dependence on system size. However, this does not exclude that some terms have an algebraic scaling in 1/L that is more suitable for finite-size extrapolations. In our analysis, we use the maximal value of the quasi-particle\n23\ndistribution\nnmax,k\u03b2 (L, V ) = Maxk nk,\u03b2(L, V ) (160)\nto locate such special k-values for a given interaction strength, see Fig. 12.\nAs seen in Fig. 14, the maximal value nmax,k\u03b2 (L, V ) increases from zero for weak interactions up to a maximal value near the critical interaction strength and decreases down to zero for large interactions. We thus determine the maximum of nmax,k\u03b2 (L, V ),\nV max\u03b2 (L) = Max V nmax,k\u03b2 (L, V ) . (161)\nIn Fig. 14 we show nmax,k\u03b2 (L, V ) together with a 6th-order polynomial fit in the vicinity of V = 2 to locate the positions V max\u03b2 (L) for system sizes L = 32, 64, 128, 256, 512. In this way, we locate V max\u03b2 (L) with high accuracy.\nNext, we extrapolate the positions of the maxima to the thermodynamic limit. In Fig. 15 we show V max\u03b2 (L) as a function of inverse system size together with a squareroot fit,\nV max\u03b2 (L) = V qp c + v1\u221a L + v2 L , (162)\nwhere V qpc , v1, and v2 are fit parameters. The squareroot extrapolation is motivated by the fact that the Luttinger liquid is characterized by algebraic singularities. Indeed, the Luttinger parameter is K(Vc) = 1/2 at the transition. The extrapolation results in V qpc = 2.0008\u00b1 0.019, in agreement with the exact value for the critical interaction with at most one percent deviation. The extrapolation of the maxima position in the quasiparticle density provides a successful route to determine the critical interaction strength with high accuracy. A more traditional route to determine the transition traces the breakdown of the Luttinger liquid, as already\nutilized for the finite-size corrections of the ground-state energy and of the gap. The Luttinger parameter K(V ) directly monitors the Luttinger liquid, as seen from the momentum distribution. Indeed, an accurate calculation of Luttinger exponent K(V ) from the density-density correlation function permits to locate the transition with an accuracy of three percent, as we shall show next."

We use the Hartree-Fock approximation to first and second order in the interaction and the numerical density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for rings with up to 514 sites and compare the data with exact results from Bethe Ansatz in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we investigate the ground-\nstate energy per lattice site e0(V ), the nearest-neighbor single-particle density matrix B0(V ), the single-particle gap \u22061(V ), and the charge-density wave order parameter na(V ). For the ground-state energy and the gap, exact analytical formulae are available for the leading finite-size corrections in the metallic phase.\nIn addition, DMRG and second-order Hartree-Fock theory permit to calculate the single-particle density matrix and the density-density correlation function for all distances and thus provide the momentum distribution nk, the quasi-particle distribution nk,\u03b2 , and the structure factor C\u0303NN(q, V ).\nHartree-Fock theory provides a good upper bound to the ground-state energy that is improved for all interaction strengths by including second-order corrections. Second-order Hartree-Fock theory is applicable for all interaction strengths because the density of quasi particles is very small so that second-order Hartree-Fock theory is almost variational.\nIn contrast to other exactly solvable one-dimensional models, spinless fermions display a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at a finite value, Vc = 2. In standard Hartree-Fock theory, the CDW transition is predicted to set in at any finite interaction, reflecting the perfect nesting situation at half band-filling. Second-order HartreeFock theory predicts a discontinuous CDW transition at V (2) c,2 \u2248 1.51; the ordered phase around V = 0 is reduced to the region 0 < V < V (2) c,1 \u2248 0.21 and is characterized by a tiny order parameter. Therefore, second-order HartreeFock theory improves the description of spinless fermions considerably, both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nQuantitatively reliable information about the CDW transition is obtained from DMRG on large systems. The exact ground-state energy density and nearest-neighbor single-particle density matrix do not display any singularities and are almost perfectly reproduced for all interaction strengths by DMRG for up to 514 sites. Likewise, the gap and the CDW order parameter are obtained with good accuracy from a finite-size extrapolation of the DMRG data, except for the critical region where the gap and the CDW order parameter display essential singularities. Therefore, different strategies have to be designed to locate the quantum phase transition accurately.\nIn this work, two strategies are designed that permit to determine the critical interaction strength. The traditional route focuses on the breakdown of the Luttinger liquid. Results from conformal field theory and the Bethe Ansatz for the finite-size corrections of the ground-state energy and the gap lead to useful but not very accurate estimates for Vc. Moreover, these estimates require a lot of a-priori knowledge from the exact solution. Instead, the traditional derivation of the Luttinger parameter from the momentum distribution, nk(L, V ), and, more accurately, from the structure factor at small momenta, C\u0303NN(q \u2192 0, V ), leads to V LLc = 2.06, only three percent off the exact result. The second strategy to determine the CDW transition point with high accu-\n25\nracy utilizes the maxima of the quasi-particle distribution nk,\u03b2(L, V ). For L \u2192 \u221e, nmax,k\u03b2 (V ) peaks at Vc. The finite-size extrapolation of DMRG data for up to L = 512 sites leads to an agreement with one percent accuracy, V qpc = 2.0008\u00b1 0.019. The density of quasi-particles is small also for the exact solution, nmax,k\u03b2 (V ) \u2264 0.035 \u226a 0.5. This implies that the system may be viewed as a vacuum state with a dilute gas of excitations. This observation ties in with the fact that dynamic correlation functions for the XXZ model can be expressed in terms as a series of 2n-spinon excitations that is dominated by the first few terms."

A much better fit for the CDW order parameter can be obtained from a logarithmic extrapolation of the DMRG data,\nnloga (L, V ) = n log a (V ) +\nc\n(d+ ln(L))\u03b3 (I-2)\nwith the four fit parameters nloga (V ), c, d, and \u03b3. We extrapolate the DMRG data for the charge-densitywave order parameter na(L, V ) obtained for periodic boundary conditions and L = 64, 128, 256, 512, and plot nloga (V ) in Fig. 18, together with the result from the second-order polynomial extrapolation na(V ) and the analytic result from Bethe Ansatz. As seen from the figure, the logarithmic fit procedure gives a much better agreement with the exact result even though the extrapolated order parameter is slightly negative below the transition and becomes positive around Vc. This behavior is typical for transitions at finite interaction strengths. We may use the re-entrance criterion of a zero order parameter, na(V re c ) = 0, to estimate the critical interaction strength. In this way we find V rec = 1.98. The critical interaction strength Vc can be determined with the same accuracy from the minimum of the exponent \u03b3(V ). For our data set, the minimum of \u03b3(V ) occurs at the exact value Vc = 2 so that the logarithmic extrapolation of the order parameter leads to Vc = 2.00\u00b1 0.02, with an accuracy of one percent. However, this observation deserves some critical comments. First, the extrapolation includes four fit parameters which always carries the risk of over-fitting the data.\nSecond, the functional form (I-2) is purely phenomenological. In fact, the same approximation leads to nonsensical results when applied to the single-particle gap. The logarithmic scheme (I-2) only coincidentally works for the CDW order parameter."

Therefore, it is natural to fit the DMRG gaps, extracted from a second-order polynomial fit for the gap data for L = 64, 128, 256, 512, to the expression\n\u22061(a, C1, Vc) = C1 exp\n( \u2212 a\u221a\nV \u2212 Vc\n) (I-4)\nwith C1, a, and Vc as fit parameters, where a = \u03c0 2/2 \u2248 4.93, C1 = 16\u03c0 \u2248 50.3 and Vc = 2 are the exact values.\n28\nThe application of the fit formula (I-4) generates several problems. First, for which parameters V can the fit formula be applied? If V is too large, we leave the asymptotic range; if V is too small, the error in the extrapolated values from DMRG are too large. Below, we choose 2.5 \u2264 V \u2264 3 to obtain meaningful results. Second, an unbiased three-parameter fit leads to unsatisfactory results, as seen in Fig. 19(a). The DMRG gaps for 2.5 \u2264 V \u2264 3 are faithfully reproduced but C1 = 136, a = 6.36, and Vc = 1.85 are far off the exact results. For a stable result, either C1 or a has to be close to its exact value. Using the guess Vc = 2, we obtain C1 = 48 and a = 4.9 as optimal values, quite close to the exact values, see Fig. 19(b). The two-parameter fit with the choice C1 = 16\u03c0 leads to a = 4.97 and Vc = 1.99, see Fig. 19(c), and for fixed a = \u03c02/2 we obtain C1 = 49 and Vc = 1.995, and the values for all three parameters are very satisfactory. Note, however, that the least-square fit remains best for the three-parameter fit, case (a).\nIt is seen that the fitting of the gap requires a lot of\na-priori information to obtain a good estimate for the critical interaction. Apparently, this is not a viable approach."

            "heading": "3. Scaling approach to the single-particle gap",
            "text": "To overcome the above limitations, Mishra, Carrasquilla, and Rigol designed a scaling approach1 to extract Vc from the finite-size data so that an unspecific polynomial extrapolation is avoided and all raw data are included in the fit for Vc. The finite-size data are supposed to lie on a scaling curve,\nL\u22061(L, V )\n( 1 +\n1\n2 ln(L) + C\n) = F (L/\u03be) , (I-5)\nwhere \u03be is the correlation length, and F (x) is the unknown scaling function. Here, C is a number that is\n29\nindependent of L and V in the critical regime. The functional form on the left-hand-side of eq. (I-5) is motivated from the scaling behavior of the conductivity in twodimensional systems with a Kosterlitz/Thouless transition at finite temperatures.1\nClose to the transition, the correlation length on the insulating side should diverge proportional to the inverse gap,\nln \u03be = a\u221a\nV \u2212 Vc \u223c \u2212 ln(\u2206) . (I-6)\nTherefore, it is advisable to employ not L/\u03be but xL = ln(L/\u03be) = ln(L) \u2212 a/ \u221a V \u2212 Vc as variable in the scaling function, i.e., F (L/\u03be) \u2261 f(xL) in eq. (I-5). To make progress, it must be assumed that in the region of accessible values for L and V , the scaling function f(xL) can reliably be represented by a polynomial of order R\nf(xL) \u2248 R\u2211\nr=0\n\u03b1r(xL) r , (I-7)\nwhere the coefficients \u03b1r remain to be determined. Here, R should be chosen such that the absolute value of the real coefficient \u03b1r \u223c 10\u2212r is small. Below, we shall use R = 5. The remaining task is to find the optimal fit of the numerical data to the scaling form, i.e., we minimize the penalty function2\nS(a, C, vc, {\u03b1r}) = \u2211\ni,j\n[ Li\u22061(Li, Vj) [ 1 +\n1\n2 ln(Li) + C\n]\n\u2212 R\u2211\nr=0\n\u03b1r ( ln(Li)\u2212\na\u221a Vj \u2212 Vc\n)r]2\n(I-8)\nwith respect to the Taylor coefficients \u03b1r and the parameters a, C, Vc. Here, we include the gap data \u22061(Li, Vj) for the system sizes Li \u2208 {128, 256, 512} and interaction strengths Vj \u2208 {2.15, 2.2, 2.25, 2.3, 2.35, 2.4, 2.45, 2.5}. As seen from eq. (I-8), we cannot select values Vi that are too close to the transition because, due to the factor 1/ \u221a Vi \u2212 Vc, the range of values for xL becomes too large for the series expansion. The minimization task posed by eq. (I-8) is non-trivial. It is done in two steps. First, for fixed (C, a, Vc), the minimization implies a least-square fit of the data to the scaling function. This quadratic problem is readily solved by using FindMinimum of Mathematica.3. In the second step, (C, a, Vc) are optimized. This can either be done by using a dense grid of values for (C, a, Vc) around some educated guess (C, a, Vc)0, and picking the lowest values for the penalty function to determine the optimal set of parameters.2 Alternatively, we apply a sequence of optimizations by first optimizing C for given (a, Vc), then we optimize a while re-optimizing C whenever a changes. As soon as (C, a) are optimal for the given Vc, we optimize Vc for this set. The procedure is\nrepeated with the optimization of (C, a) for the new value for Vc and terminates when the penalty function changes by less than 10\u22125. The final result does not depend on the sequence of optimizations. The results agree with those obtained from the dense-grid method.\nThe best result is S = 0.226466 for the parameter set C = \u221215.758, a = 5.12388, and Vc = 2.01105. The data and the scaling curve are shown in Fig. 20. Apparently, a nice agreement with the exact data, a = \u03c02/2 \u2248 4.93, and Vc = 2 is obtained. The agreement is slightly worse, S = 0.413908 for the parameter set C = \u221215.682, a = 5.1743, and Vc = 2.02 when the data for L = 64 are included. This signals that the inclusion of larger system sizes systematically lead to better results for the critical interaction strength.\nThe degree R of the polynomial is a more sensitive parameter. When we choose R = 4 instead of R = 5, we obtain S = 0.623039 for the parameter set C = \u221215.9479, a = 6.332, and Vc = 1.93. At the same time, R = 6 leads to S = 0.0779472 for the parameter set C = \u221215.588, a = 4.5168, and Vc = 2.06. Apparently, the least-square fit needs to be stabilized by providing more data points, i.e., DMRG data for more system sizes and interaction strengths (Li, Vj).\nMore problematic than the selection of R is the sign of the constant C. Since it is negative, there is a system size LC = exp(\u2212C/2) \u2248 2600 where the assumption of a logarithmic correction in eq. (I-5) becomes meaningless. Apparently, the logarithmic term is needed to stabilize the extrapolation scheme for L \u226a LC . Indeed, without the logarithmic term, the critical interaction would be far off the exact value, Vc = 1.6. We also found that the factor L in front of \u22061(L, V ) in eq. (I-5) is essential to obtain meaningful values for Vc. Moreover, the dependence of the correlation length on 1/ \u221a V \u2212 Vc in eq. (I-6) is taken for granted. We come to the conclusions that\n30\nthe scaling approach cannot be used as a black box tool to derive Vc with good accuracy.\nSupplement II: Series expansions for the exact\nground-state energy\nIn this appendix, we give the Taylor series expansions for weak and strong interactions, and asymptotic series expansions around the critical interaction strength for the ground-state energy at half band-filling. To this end, we use the original expressions by Yang and Yang. A more sophisticated approach employs special functions.4"

(II-11)\nWe shall show below that it agrees with the corresponding expression in the insulating region.\nb. Insulating region\nWe start from eq. (16) of the main text.

(II-12)\nThe rearrangement of the sum shows directly that, in the limit \u03bb\u2192 0,\nS(\u03bb\u2192 0) = \u2212 1 2\u03bb\n\u221e\u2211\nr=1\n(\u22121)r 1 r = ln(2) 2\u03bb .

(18) of the main text, as it must be because the ground-state energy is continuous at V = 2. To make further progress, we define\nf1(\u03bb,m) = 1 exp[2\u03bb(2m)]\u2212 1 \u2212 1 2\u03bb(2m) ,\nf2(\u03bb,m) = 1 exp[2\u03bb(2m\u2212 1)]\u2212 1 \u2212 1 2\u03bb(2m\u2212 1) ,\n(II-15)\nso that\nS(\u03bb) =\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n(f2(\u03bb,m)\u2212 f1(\u03bb,m))\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n( 1\n2\u03bb(2m\u2212 1) \u2212 1 2\u03bb(2m)\n)\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n(f2(\u03bb,m)\u2212 f1(\u03bb,m)) + ln(2)\n2\u03bb .

The integral terms reads\nT1(\u03bb) =\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndxf2(\u03bb, x)\u2212 \u222b \u221e\n1\ndxf1(\u03bb, x)\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n1/2\ndxf1(\u03bb, x)\u2212 \u222b \u221e\n1\ndxf1(\u03bb, x)\n= 1\n4\u03bb\n\u222b 4\u03bb\n2\u03bb\ndu\n( 1\neu \u2212 1 \u2212 1 u\n)\n= ln[cosh(\u03bb)] 4\u03bb \u2212 1 4 . (II-18)\nThe second term is\nT2(\u03bb) = 1\n2 (f2(\u03bb, 1)\u2212 f1(\u03bb, 1)) =\n1 4 sinh(2\u03bb) \u2212 1 8\u03bb .\n(II-19)\n32\nThe third term involves the derivatives of f2(\u03bb, x) \u2212 f1(\u03bb, x) at x = 1 that we expand in a Taylor series around \u03bb = 0. We note that\n( \u2202\n\u2202x\n)2k\u22121 (f2(\u03bb, x) \u2212 f1(\u03bb, x)) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=1 \u223c \u03bb2k+1 , (II-20)\nso that in the remaining series over the derivatives we have\nT3(\u03bb) + T (K) 3 (\u03bb) = O\n( \u03bb2K+3 ) (II-21)\nwith\nT (K) 3 (\u03bb) =\nK\u2211\nk=1\nB2k (2k)!\n( f (2k\u22121) 2 (\u03bb, 1)\u2212 f (2k\u22121) 1 (\u03bb, 1) ) .\n(II-22) In fact, Mathematica gives\nT (4) 3 (\u03bb) = \u2212\n\u03bb3 60 + \u03bb5 90 \u2212 \u03bb 7 6300 + 101\u03bb9 44550 (II-23)\nfor \u03bb\u226a 1. The series expansion for S(\u03bb) thus becomes\nS(\u03bb) = ln(2)\n2\u03bb + T1(\u03bb) + T2(\u03bb) + T3(\u03bb)\n\u223c ln(2) 2\u03bb \u2212 1 4 + \u03bb 24 +\n\u03bb3\n720 +\n\u03bb5\n3780 +\n17\u03bb7\n151200\n+ 31\u03bb9\n374220 +O\n( \u03bb11 ) . (II-24)\nThe approximation is better than 10\u22124 for 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 0.9. Thus, the expansion of the ground-state energy close to the transition in the insulating phase becomes for V & 2\ne0(V ) = 1\u2212 2 ln(2)\n+ 1\u2212 ln(2)\n3 (V \u2212 2)\n+ 4 ln(2)\u2212 7\n360 (V \u2212 2)2\n+ 1\u2212 4 ln(2)\n3024 (V \u2212 2)3\n+ 184 ln(2)\u2212 487\n907200 (V \u2212 2)4\n\u22122104 ln(2) + 14153 59875200 (V \u2212 2)5 +O ( (V \u2212 2)6 ) . (II-25)\nThe approximation is better than 10\u22123 only for 2 \u2264 V \u2264 3, i.e., the approximation is not particularly useful. Note that the asymptotic series in the insulating regime, eq. (II-25) for V \u2265 2, agrees with the asymptotic expansion in the metallic regime, eq. (II-11) for 0 < V \u2264 2. This does not come as a surprise because the ground-state energy is continuously differentiable at V = 2 to all orders.\nSupplement III: Series expansion for the exact\nsingle-particle gap\nIn this appendix we provide formulae for the singleparticle gap in the strong-coupling limit and close to the transition where it opens exponentially.

Of the four sums over the momenta in the reduced Brillouin zone, one can be eliminated using the Kronecker conditions. In the first term, we have the condition \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 k2 = p1+p2\u2212k1 < \u03c0/2 which imposes \u2212\u03c0/2+k1 \u2264 p1+p2 < \u03c0/2 + k1 for \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 k1 < \u03c0/2 in addition to \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 p1 + p2 < \u03c0. Therefore, \u2212\u03c0/2+ k1 \u2264 p1 + p2 < \u03c0/2 + k1 must hold, i.e, the condition on p2 is \u2212\u03c0/2 + k1 \u2212 p1 \u2264 p2 < \u03c0/2 + k1 \u2212 p1 in addition to \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 p2 < \u03c0/2.

This can be seen by separating the points k = 0 and k = \u03c0/2, and combining the terms for k and \u2212k. In this way, the sums contain only L/4 + 1 summation terms. Thus,\n\u03b4e (2) 0 = \u2212V 2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03bb\n[L/2\u22121\u2211\nm=0\n[ [R0(m,\u03bb)] 2 \u2212 [R1(m,\u03bb)]2\n\u2212 [Rc2(m,\u03bb)]2 + [Rs2(m,\u03bb)]2 ]2\n+\nL/2\u22121\u2211\nm=0\n[ [R3(m,\u03bb)] 2 \u2212 [Rc4(m,\u03bb)]2\n+ [Rs4(m,\u03bb)] 2 + [Rc5(m,\u03bb)] 2 \u2212 [Rs5(m,\u03bb)]2 ]2\n\u22124 L/2\u22121\u2211\nm=0\n[ Rs5(m,\u03bb)R c 4(m,\u03bb)\n\u2212Rc5(m,\u03bb)Rs4(m,\u03bb) ]2] . (VI-17)\nThis representation shows that only two sums need to be carried out, one over momenta to calculate the functions Rc,si and another one over the lattice sites. In addition,\nan integral must be carried out that converges rapidly due to the exponentially decaying integrand. To simplify matters, we use inversion symmetry which implies that the sites l and L\u2212 l contribute equally. This symmetry can also be inferred from the properties of the functions Qi. Therefore, each lattice sum in eq. (VI-17) contains only about L/4 terms. For the complete set of system sizes L = {8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024}, a typical minimization for fixed value of V takes a few hours on a notebook (Intel i7 processor).\nc. Limit of strong coupling\nWe address the limit V \u226b 1 where the Hartree-Fock energy and order parameters are exact to leading order, see Sect. IV C 2 of the main text. To calculate the contribution from the second-order term, we thus may set\n2V B0 = 1 +O ( 1\nV 2\n) ,\n2V na = 1\u2212 4\nV +O\n( 1\nV 3\n) ,\n\u01eb\u0303(k) = \u22124 cos(k) +O ( 1\nV 2\n) ,\nE(k) = V + 4\nV (2 cos2(k)\u2212 1) +O\n( 1\nV 3\n) ,\n2V na E(k) = 1\u2212 8 cos 2(k) V 2 +O\n( 1\nV 4\n) ,\n\u01eb\u0303(k) E(k) = \u22124 cos(k) V +O\n( 1\nV 3\n) . (VI-18)\nFor the energy denominator in eq. (VI-2) we may thus approximate E(k1) + E(k2) + E(p1) + E(p2) \u2248 4V . Therefore, keeping terms up to order V \u22122, we approximate\nR0(m, 0) \u2248 1\n2 \u03b4m,0 ,\nR1(m, 0) \u2248 ( 1\n2 \u2212 2 V 2\n) \u03b4m,0 \u2212 1\nV 2 \u03b4m,1 ,\nRc2(m, 0) \u2248 \u2212 1\nV \u03b4m,0 \u2212\n1\n2V \u03b4m,1 ,\nRs2(m, 0) \u2248 1\n2V \u03b4m,1 ,\nR3(m, 0) \u2248 \u2212 1\nV \u03b4m,0 ,\nRc4(m, 0) \u2248 1\n4 \u03b4m,0 ,\nRs4(m, 0) \u2248 \u2212 1\n4 \u03b4m,0 ,\nRc5(m, 0) \u2248 ( 1\n4 \u2212 3 2V 2\n) \u03b4m,0 \u2212 1\n2V 2 \u03b4m,1 ,\nRs5(m, 0) \u2248 ( \u22121 4 + 1 2V 2 ) \u03b4m,0 + 1 2V 2 \u03b4m,1 .\n(VI-19)\n39\nThe excitations are all short-ranged so that the functions Ri are finite only for m = 0, 1. In eq. (VI-17) we thus find\n\u03b4e (2) 0 (V \u226b t) \u2248 \u2212\n1\n4V 3 (VI-20)\nwith corrections of the order V \u22125. Apparently, the second-order corrections remain finite for V \u226b t,\neHF0 (V \u226b t) \u2248 \u2212 1\nV + 2\n1\nV 3 ,\neHF,2nd0 (V \u226b t) \u2248 \u2212 1\nV +\n( 2\u2212 1\n4\n) 1\nV 3 ,\neexact0 (V \u226b t) \u2248 \u2212 1\nV +\n1\nV 3 . (VI-21)\nThe second order correction mildly improves the result of the Hartree-Fock energy for strong interactions.\nd. Vanishing charge-density wave order\nWe can test our analytical expressions against the exact second-order coefficient e (2) 0 in eq. (19) of the main text,\ne (2) 0 = \u2212\n2\n3\u03c03 +\n1\n36\u03c0 \u2248 \u22120.0126591 . (VI-22)\nWhen there is no charge-density wave order parameter, i.e., na \u2261 0, B0 = 1/\u03c0, we may set V = 0 in eq. (VI-17). Since there is no symmetry breaking and V = 0, we see that R1 \u2261 0, Rc,s5 \u2261 0, and \u01eb\u0303(k) = \u01eb(k) = \u22122t cos(k). In the thermodynamic limit we have\n1\nL\n\u2211\n\u2212\u03c0/2\u2264k<\u03c0/2\n\u2192 \u222b \u03c0/2\n\u2212\u03c0/2\ndk 2\u03c0 , (VI-23)\nand the integrals for the remaining functions Ri are evaluated numerically for m \u2264 50 using Mathematica,3\ne (2) 0 \u2248 \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03bb [ [R0(0, \u03bb)] 2 \u2212 [Rc2(0, \u03bb)] 2 + [Rs2(0, \u03bb)] 2 ]2\n+2\n50\u2211\nm=1\n[ [R0(m,\u03bb)] 2 \u2212 [Rc2(m,\u03bb)]2 + [Rs2(m,\u03bb)]2 ]2\n+2\n50\u2211\nm=0\n[ [R3(m,\u03bb)] 2 \u2212 [Rc4(m,\u03bb)]2 + [Rs4(m,\u03bb)]2 ]2\n= \u22120.0126587 (VI-24)\nwith relative deviations of the order 10\u22125 from the analytic result (VI-22). Note that the mth entries in the lattice sums in eq. (VI-17) decay proportional to m\u22123. The same result can be derived within seconds with an accuracy of 10\u22127 from the triple integrals in eq. (VI-8),\ne (2) 0 \u2248 \u22120.01265908184 . (VI-25)\nIn the absence of a charge-density wave, the groundstate energy as a function of B0 is given by\ne (2) 0 (B0, 0, V ) = \u2212\n2 \u03c0 (1 +B0V ) +\n( 1\n4 +B20\n) V\n+ ( \u2212 2 3\u03c03 + 1 36\u03c0 ) V 2 1 + V B0 (VI-26)\nbecause the Fock term just renormalizes the dispersion relation, \u01eb\u0303(k) = (1 + V B0)\u01eb(k). The resulting minimization problem leads to a third-order equation that can be solved analytically. For V . 1.5 we may use the approximation\nB0(V . 1.5) \u2248 1 \u03c0 \u2212 V\n2\n2 24\u2212 \u03c02 36\u03c0(\u03c0 + V )2 . (VI-27)\nFor moderately large V , we find that B0 is almost constant so that the energy increases linearly with V ,\ne (2) 0 (B0, 0, 4 < V < 10) \u2248 \u2212\n2 \u03c0 + \u03b3V +O(V 2) (VI-28)\nand \u03b3 \u2248 1/4\u22121/\u03c02 \u2248 0.15. In the absence of the chargedensity wave order, the energy becomes positive around V+ = 5. Since the energy must go to zero for large interactions, the CDW order must set in at some critical value V (2) c < V+."

(V-17) and (V-20).\nNote that the resulting momentum distribution is asymmetric because we broke inversion symmetry on finite lattices by choosing k = \u2212\u03c0/2 occupied and k = \u03c0/2 unoccupied. Therefore, the momentum distribution must be symmetrized. In the region \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 s \u2264 \u03c0/2 we set\nn\u0304\u03b2,s =\n \n\nn\u03b2,\u2212\u03c0/2 for s = \u2212\u03c0/2 , (n\u03b2,s + n\u03b2,\u2212s) /2 for \u2212\u03c0/2 < s < \u03c0/2 ,\nn\u03b2,\u2212\u03c0/2 for s = \u03c0/2 .\n(VI-32) Here, s = 2\u03c0ms/L with ms = \u2212L/4,\u2212L/4+ 1, . . . , L/4. It is possible to express the momentum distribution using a single sum plus an integral. This is not neces-\nsary because the expression (VI-31) involves only a double sum for each momentum value so that there are no memory problems even at L = 1000. In the thermodynamic limit, we find that the first two terms in eq. (VI-31) map onto each other by inverting the momentum, n (1) s,\u03b2 = n (2) \u2212s,\u03b2. Likewise, n (3) s,\u03b2 = n (4) \u2212s,\u03b2 so that the momentum distribution is inversion symmetric, ns,\u03b2 = n\u2212s,\u03b2 .
