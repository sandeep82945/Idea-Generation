    "abstractText": "Various aspects of axion electrodynamics in the presence of a homogeneous and isotropic dielectric medium are discussed. First, we consider the \u201cantenna-like\u201d property of a planar dielectric surface in axion electrodynamics, elaborating on the treatment given earlier on this topic by Millar et al. [J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01 (2017) 061.]. We calculate the electromagnetic energy transmission coefficient for a dielectric plate, and compare with the conventional expression in ordinary electrodynamics. Second, we consider the situation where the medium exterior to the plate, assumed elastic, is \u201cbent back\u201d and glued together, so that we obtain a circular dielectric string in which the waves can propagate clockwise or counterclockwise. As will be shown, a stationary wave pattern is permitted by the formalism, and we show how the amplitudes for the two counterpropagating waves can be found. Third, as a special case, by omitting axions for a moment, we analyze the Casimir effect for the string, showing its similarity as well as its difference from the Casimir effect of a scalar field for a piecewise uniform string [I. Brevik and H. B. Nielsen, Phys. Rev. D 41, 1185 (1990).]. Finally, including axions again we analyze the enhancement of the surface-generated electromagnetic radiation near the center of a cylindrical haloscope, where the interior region is a vacuum and the exterior region a high refractive index medium. This enhancement is caused by the curvature of the boundary, and is mathematically a consequence of the behavior of the Hankel function of the second kind for small arguments. A simple estimate shows that enhancement may be quite significant, and can therefore be of experimental interest. The presence of an absorber in the center and the possibility of adopting it to search for axions with mass in the THz region, and possibly the GHz region too, is also discussed. This proposal is suggested as an alternative to the reflector arrangement in a similar arrangement recently discussed by Liu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 131801 (2022).].",

Astropart. Phys. 01 (2017) 061.]. We calculate the electromagnetic energy transmission coefficient for a dielectric plate, and compare with the conventional expression in ordinary electrodynamics. Second, we consider the situation where the medium exterior to the plate, assumed elastic, is \u201cbent back\u201d and glued together, so that we obtain a circular dielectric string in which the waves can propagate clockwise or counterclockwise. As will be shown, a stationary wave pattern is permitted by the formalism, and we show how the amplitudes for the two counterpropagating waves can be found. Third, as a special case, by omitting axions for a moment, we analyze the Casimir effect for the string, showing its similarity as well as its difference from the Casimir effect of a scalar field for a piecewise uniform string [I. Brevik and H. B. Nielsen, Phys. Rev. D 41, 1185 (1990).]. Finally, including axions again we analyze the enhancement of the surface-generated electromagnetic radiation near the center of a cylindrical haloscope, where the interior region is a vacuum and the exterior region a high refractive index medium. This enhancement is caused by the curvature of the boundary, and is mathematically a consequence of the behavior of the Hankel function of the second kind for small arguments. A simple estimate shows that enhancement may be quite significant, and can therefore be of experimental interest. The presence of an absorber in the center and the possibility of adopting it to search for axions with mass in the THz region, and possibly the GHz region too, is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION\nThe antenna-like behavior of a single dielectric plane surface in axion electrodynamics in the presence of a strong external magnetic field is a rather remarkable phenomenon. In particular, it is quite perplexing that the Poynting vector normal to a dielectric surface is no longer continuous across the surface, a property otherwise considered as a cornerstone in electromagnetic theory. There occurs an extra\nelectromagnetic radiation of energy from the surface. Of course, this energy must stem from somewhere. It is rather a consequence of the interchange of field energies happening between two reservoirs, namely the usual electromagnetic reservoir, and the other one due to the axion field. A detailed exposition of these properties of axion electrodynamics is given by Millar et al. [1]. The effect is also planned for use in experimental broadband tests [2]. Our purpose with the present paper is first to elaborate further on some of the consequences of this dielectricsurface effect. After giving a brief survey of axion electrodynamic formalism in the next section, we consider in Sec. III the most simple dielectric system where two surfaces are involved, namely the planar dielectric disk.

Thereafter in Sec. IV, still dealing with two-surface systems, we turn the exterior medium 2 \u201cback\u201d and join it with medium 1 so that we obtain a circular loop or string, and investigate if the axion formalism admits a stationary state implying clockwise and counterclockwise propagating modes. Actually the formalism does so. Such a system is most likely only of fundamental interest, but the positive outcome of the analysis demonstrates the flexibility of the axionic formalism. As a by-product, if we for a moment ignore the axion field we can calculate the electromagnetic Casimir energy of the system. This is considered in Sec. V. We show how the systems bears similarities to the piecewise uniform relativistic string which has been considered repeatedly earlier [3\u20139]. Finally, in Sec. VI we return to the antennalike property of dielectric surfaces, and investigate the enhancement of the electric field near the center of a cylindrical haloscope caused by the curvature of the emitting boundary. Here the central region is a vacuum, while the outer region is a metal. The enhancement can actually be quite significant. This opens the possibility for the measurement of the emitted field from the cylindrical boundary, and may thus be an alternative to the broadband solenoidal haloscope recently proposed by Liu et al. [2]. Some of the pioneering papers on axion electrodynamics are listed in Refs. [10\u201318]. More recent works can be found in Refs. [19\u201343]."

            "text": "We begin by considering one single planar dielectric surface, placed at x \u00bc 0, separating the left region 1 (refractive index n1) from the right region 2 (refractive index n2). We assume the simple case where the media are nonmagnetic and n1, n2 constants and real. A strong static magnetic field Be \u00bc Bez\u0302 is imposed in the z direction. An incoming wave polarized in the z direction comes in from the left, propagates in the x direction, and becomes partly reflected by the surface. The basic property following from the extended Maxwell equations in the present context is that the components ofE andH parallel to the surface have to be continuous (as in ordinary electrodynamics) at x \u00bc 0. This is the situation analyzed in detail by Millar et al. [1]. Because of the axions there will be produced two outgoing electromagnetic waves, one going to the left and one going to the right. In this sense we can consider the dielectric surface to have antenna-like properties. It does not mean that electromagnetic energy comes out from nothing, however, but that there occurs an energy interchange between the ordinary electromagnetic and the axion reservoirs.\nIt is now convenient, following Ref. [1], to distinguish the produced traveling fields by an extra index \u03b3. Continuity of Ek gives straightaway\nE\u03b31 \u00fe Ea1 \u00bc E\u03b32 \u00fe Ea2: \u00f018\u00de\nNext, we may take into account the relationship\nH\u03b3 \u00bc 1 n E\u03b3; \u00f019\u00de\nwhich holds for a propagating wave when the medium is nonmagnetic. This implies that the boundary condition for Hk can be written as\n\u2212n1E \u03b3 1 \u00bc n2E\u03b32; \u00f020\u00de\nexpressing that the two wave vectors k1 and k2 are antiparallel. As Ea \u00bc \u2212\u00f01=\u03b5\u00deE0, we can then solve for the produced fields to get\nE\u03b31 \u00bc \u2212 E0 n1 1 n2 \u2212 1 n1 ; E\u03b32 \u00bc E0 n2 1 n2 \u2212 1 n1 ; \u00f021\u00de\n(recall that E0 \u00bc \u03b80Be). Remark: The argument above did not imply there to be any in-falling initial photons from the left. This is the most fundamental constellation. The argument however implies a nontrivial point, namely the use of Eq. (19) in an initial vacuum. This equation is not a general one in electrodynamics, but is implicitly resting on the assumption that there are propagating waves. This point thus brings some concern about the validity of the argument in this special case where there is initially a vacuum. Now, Millar et al. [1] discuss also the more general case where there are in-falling photons from the left, and in that case the use of Eq. (19) is of course nonproblematic. Now move on to consider the situation with two dielectric surfaces; we focus first on simple dielectric slab of thickness d, surrounded by vacuum. The refractive index is n \u00bc ffiffi\u03b5p , similarly as above. It is of interest to consider the energy transmission coefficient\nT \u00bc ETEI 2 \u00f022\u00de in the presence of axions, ET and EI referring to the transmitted and incident wave amplitudes, respectively. Based upon Eq. (5.4a) in Ref. [1] we obtain\nT \u00bc 4n 2\n4n2 \u00fe \u00f0n2 \u2212 1\u00de2sin2kd ; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere k \u00bc 2\u03c0=\u03bb \u00bc n\u03c9. Remarkably enough, this expression does not contain E0. Some special cases are noteworthy: if\n043522-3\nd \u00bc \u03bb=4 the transmission is at minimum, T \u00bc Tmin \u00bc 4n2=\u00f0n2 \u00fe 1\u00de2, whereas if d \u00bc \u03bb=2, the transmission is at maximum, T \u00bc Tmax \u00bc 1. It is of interest to compare this transmission coefficient from that occurring in ordinary electrodynamics. Giving the latter quantity an extra subscript elmag, we obtain (page 514 in Stratton [44])\nTelmag \u00bc 4n2\n\u00f0n2 \u00fe 1\u00de2 \u2212 \u00f0n2 \u2212 1\u00de2sin2kd : \u00f024\u00de\nIt is seen that T and Telmag are different, which could be expected since their derivations are different. Now, if d\u00bc\u03bb=4, Telmag\u00bc1, while if d\u00bc\u03bb=2, Telmag\u00bc4n2=\u00f0n2\u00fe1\u00de2, its minimum value. It ought to be mentioned that the reflection and transmission coefficients refer to the axion-generated fields only. If there were external probe source fields, Eprobe, present, then its effect would be suppressed by a factor \u00f0E0=Eprobe\u00de2."

Let n1 refer to the left medium, n2 refer to the second medium, and assume that the media are elastic so that medium 2 can be turned back and glued to the left side of medium 1. Therewith we obtain a ring-formed system. One may ask: does such a system allow stationary oscillations to occur when axions are present? It is of physical interest to examine this point, not because of the applicability of the formalism in practice, but rather as a test of the flexibility of this kind of generalized electrodynamics. Figure 1 shows the configuration. We let \u03c3 denote the length coordinate along the string, such that the two dielectric junctions are at \u03c3 \u00bc 0 and \u03c3 \u00bc LI . The total length of the string is L \u00bc LI \u00fe LII, so that the junctions \u03c3 \u00bc 0 and \u03c3 \u00bc L are overlapping.

Note: Similarly as in Ref. [1], in the Eqs. (25)\u2013(33) we\nhave assumed \u03c9 \u00bc \u03c9a. That is, the frequency \u03c9 of the forced oscillations has been taken to be the same as the axion frequency \u03c9a associated with the magnetic field Be. This is the most natural approach. It is however possible to take a more general approach, in which \u03c9 is assumed to be arbitrary. It means that the terms with E0 in (30) and (31) would need to be corrected with the factor ei\u00f0\u03c9a\u2212\u03c9\u00det. The reason for taking \u03c9 to be equal to the axion frequency \u03c9a is that in measurements the bulk of contribution comes from values of omega around \u03c9a. Indeed, the effective/measured quantities are always averages over some period of time, and the mentioned time-dependent oscillations give a deltaFIG. 1. Geometry and notation of the closed string.\n043522-4\nfunction when integrated over all times. If averaging over any finite period of time, the contribution of the regions of \u03c9 substantially different from \u03c9a due to the fast oscillating phase factor add up to zero (cf. the Lebesgue-Riemann lemma). We assume that in [1] for the same reason also such a value for \u03c9 has been chosen.

The expressions become complicated, and will not be given here. There is one particular case of interest, however, namely when n2 becomes large in comparison to n1 so that the ratio n12 \u2192 0. The lengths LI and LII are assumed arbitrary. From Eq. (36) we obtain in this case\nD\u00f0n12 \u2192 0\u00de \u00bc 2 cos\u00f0\u03b41 \u00fe \u03b42\u00de \u2212 2 cos\u00f0\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42\u00de \u00bc \u22124 sin \u03b41 sin \u03b42; \u00f037\u00de\nand after some calculation we obtain, as an example, the first of the amplitudes in the region 0 < \u03c3 < LI (note that 1=\u03b52 \u2192 0),\n\u03beI \u00bc E0 2\u03b51 1 \u2212 i 1 \u2212 cos \u03b41 sin \u03b41 ; n12 \u2192 0: \u00f038\u00de\nIt is noteworthy that this expression does not contain the phase \u03b42 related to the length LII . It is of further interest to consider the case where the length LI \u2192 0, corresponding\nto a kind of point defect sitting on an otherwise uniform string. As \u03b41 \u2192 0 in this case, we see from the last equation that\n\u03beI \u00bc E0 2\u03b51 ; n12 \u2192 0; LI \u2192 0; \u00f039\u00de\nwhich is a real quantity. If E0 \u00bc 0, the axion-induced forced oscillations vanish. In conclusion, we have managed to show that the axionic electrodynamic scheme is flexible enough to uphold stationary oscillations in the closed-string geometry."

            "text": "We now set E0 \u00bc 0, so that the forced axion-induced oscillations vanish, and those remaining possible are only the free oscillations. They correspond to the system determinant D being zero. For a given set of geometric quantities LI , LII , n1, n2, the eigenfrequencies \u03c9 are thus found by solving D \u00bc 0 using Eq. (36). Moreover, this geometry makes it very natural to consider the Casimir effect also, after applying an appropriate regularization. This will be the topic of the present section. Actually, this situation bears a considerable similarity with the Casimir energy for the relativistic piecewise uniform string, as mentioned earlier [3\u20139]. For clarity, we ought to clarify the difference between the approach in Sec. IV and that of the present section in some more detail. The two cases are physically different. In Sec. IVassuming E0 \u2260 0, the system was exposed to forced oscillations, primarily with frequency \u03c9a (eventually with arbitrary \u03c9), giving expressions for the energy E as a function of the refractive-index ratio n12 \u00bc n1=n2. In the present section the frequencies are no longer up to choice, but are determined by the determinant condition D \u00bc 0. The Casimir effect is under stationary conditions linked to discrete eigenvalues. As just mentioned, it is this condition that is just analogous to that encountered in the study of the Casimir effect for the piecewise uniform string. Before embarking on the general case, it is convenient to start with special cases of interest. The simplest case is when the string is uniform, n12 \u00bc 1, corresponding to n1 \u00bc n2 \u00bc n. Then,\nD\u00f0n12 \u00bc 1\u00de \u00bc \u22128\u00f01 \u2212 cos\u03c9nL\u00de; \u00f040\u00de\nso that the eigenfrequencies become\n\u03c9N \u00bc 2\u03c0N nL ; \u00f041\u00de\nwith N \u00bc 1; 2; 3;\u2026 Assuming implicitly that we apply a regularization procedure, for instance that of a cutoff regularization, we can express the Casimir energy as\n043522-5\nEuniform \u00bc 2 \u00d7 1\n2 X\u221e N\u00bc1 \u03c9N; \u00f042\u00de\nwhere the factor 2 in front accounts for the degeneracy of the left-right running modes. The result is (cf., for instance, Ref. [3])\nEuniform \u00bc \u2212 \u03c0\n6L : \u00f043\u00de\nThe next special case of interest is when n12 \u2192 0, the case considered also in the previous section (note that the value of n1 itself is arbitrary, not necessarily small). Then, from Eq. (37) we see that the eigenfrequencies occur in two branches,\n\u03c9N \u00bc \u03c0N n1LI ; \u00f044\u00de\n\u03c9N \u00bc \u03c0N n2LII ; \u00f045\u00de\nagain with N \u00bc 1; 2; 3;\u2026 (there is no degeneracy in this case, thus no extra factor 2). Introducing the symbol s for the length ratio,\ns \u00bc LII LI ; \u00f046\u00de\nwe get in this case\nE\u00f0n12 \u2192 0\u00de \u00bc \u2212 \u03c0\n24L\ns\u00fe 1\ns \u2212 2\n: \u00f047\u00de\nThis Casimir energy is in general negative, but attains its maximum value zero when the pieces have equal lengths, s \u00bc 1. In the general case when n12 is arbitrary the situation is more complex, but can yet be handled in a reasonably simple way by making use of Cauchy\u2019s argument principle. This principle states that any meromorphic function g\u00f0\u03c9\u00de satisfies the equation\n1\n2\u03c0i\nI \u03c9\nd d\u03c9\nln g\u00f0\u03c9\u00ded\u03c9 \u00bc X \u03c90 \u2212 X \u03c9poles; \u00f048\u00de\nwhere \u03c90 are the zeros and \u03c9poles are the poles of g\u00f0\u03c9\u00de inside the contour of integration. This contour is taken to be a semicircle of large radius R in the right half plane. A definite advantage of this method is that the multiplicities of zeros and poles are automatically included. The argument principle was introduced in connection with the Casimir effect by van Kampen et al. [45], and has later been made use of extensively (cf., for instance, Refs. [5,8,8,46]).\nFor the function g\u00f0\u03c9\u00de it is natural to start from the expression for D in Eq. (36), but we have to normalize it in a convenient way. We first introduce a convenient parametrization which relates the pieces LI and LII to the total length L,\nLI \u00bc pL; LII \u00bc qL; p\u00fe q \u00bc 1: \u00f049\u00de\nThen, define the quantity A as\nA \u00bc 1 4 \u00f01\u00fe n12\u00de2 cos\u00bd\u00f0n1p\u00fe n2q\u00de\u03c9L\n\u2212 1\n4 \u00f01 \u2212 n12\u00de2 cos\u00bd\u00f0n1p \u2212 n2q\u00de\u03c9L : \u00f050\u00de\nFor a uniform string, n12 \u00bc 1 \u00f0n1 \u00bc n2 \u00bc n\u00de, we have A \u00bc cos\u00f0n\u03c9L\u00de.

Namely, the extra produced electric field E\u03b3 occurring in the interior cylindric vacuum region will necessarily be enhanced near the center of the cylinder. The enhancement is solely caused by the curvilinear geometry. Obviously, this is a point that can be of experimental interest. We assume the case when the optical frequency is equal to the axion frequency \u03c9a. As before, assume there is an infinitely long cylindrical vacuum region with radius R, surrounded by an exterior massive dielectric environment of high refractive index. There is moreover a strong uniform static magnetic fieldBe in the z direction. We assume there are only the timevarying axions present in the system, together with the extra photons E\u03b3 that they generate at the boundary. The solutions of the Bessel equations in the exterior and interior regions are cylinder functions. No propagation of electromagnetic modes are assumed to take place in the z direction, and we can start from the usual electromagnetic mode expressions for the axial electric and the azimuthal magnetic field components in the exterior and interior regions (cf.

For large arguments \u03c1 \u226b 1 one has asymptotically, after multiplying with the common time factor e\u2212i\u03c9t,\nH\u00f01\u00dep \u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffi 2\n\u03c0\u03c1\ns ei\u00f0\u03c1\u2212 2p\u00fe1 4 \u03c0\u2212i\u03c9t\u00de;\nH\u00f02\u00dep \u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffi 2\n\u03c0\u03c1\ns e\u2212i\u00f0\u03c1\u2212 2p\u00fe1 4 \u03c0\u00fei\u03c9t\u00de: \u00f063\u00de\nThis shows that H\u00f02\u00de0 is the correct cylinder function to use in the present case. It describes waves produced at the boundary r \u00bc R, moving inward. Now, replacing J0 byH \u00f02\u00de 0 in Eq. (61), the equation takes the form\nEintz \u00bc H\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9r\u00deainte\u2212i\u03c9t; Hint\u03b8 \u00bc iH\u00f02\u00de 0 0 \u00f0\u03c9r\u00deainte\u2212i\u03c9t: \u00f064\u00de\nAs before, k2 \u00bc n2\u03c9 with n2 real. The coefficients aext and aint are determined by the boundary conditions at r \u00bc R. Looking back at the treatment in Sec. III, we will require the correspondence\nE\u03b32 \u2192 H \u00f01\u00de 0 \u00f0k2R\u00deaexte\u2212i\u03c9t; E\u03b31 \u2192 H \u00f02\u00de 0 \u00f0\u03c9R\u00deainte\u2212i\u03c9t: \u00f065\u00de\nWe assume in the following that the radius R is so large that the approximate versions (63) for the Hankel functions are applicable on the boundary. As H\u00f01\u00de 0\n0 \u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc iH\u00f01\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c1\u00de, H\u00f02\u00de 0 0 \u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc \u2212iH\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c1\u00de, we can write the boundary conditions as\nH\u00f01\u00de0 \u00f0k2R\u00deaext \u2212 E0 \u03b52 \u00bc H\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R\u00deaint \u2212 E0; \u00f066\u00de\nn2H \u00f01\u00de 0 \u00f0k2R\u00deaext \u00bc \u2212H\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R\u00deaint; \u00f067\u00de\nwhere E0 \u00bc \u03b80Be, as before. The coefficients aext and aint can then be found, and we can express the result as\nH\u00f01\u00de0 \u00f0k2R\u00deaext \u00bc \u2212 E0 n2 1 \u2212 1 n2 ; \u00f068\u00de\nH\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R\u00deaint \u00bc E0 1 \u2212 1\nn2\n; \u00f069\u00de\nin agreement with Eq. (21) obtained for plane geometry.\n043522-8\nWe now move on to the central point in this analysis, which is to observe the behavior of the inward-emitted electric field Ez near the center of the cylinder. As the magnitude of H\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c1\u00de increases logarithmically as \u03c1 \u2192 0, there will necessarily be an enhancement of the field in this region. (Note that this enhancement is a pure focusing effect caused by the boundary r \u00bc R, and is not related to a divergence of the source.) One might argue that the accumulation of electric fields near r \u00bc 0 would lead to an unstable situation. We may avoid this, at least conceptually, by assuming there to be a perfect cylindrical absorber of small radius r \u00bc \u03b4 centered at the z axis, thus allowing for stable conditions. Letting the inward-generated field at r \u00bc R be represented by H\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R\u00de, we may for small values of the argument \u03c1 make use of the approximation\nH\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc J0\u00f0\u03c1\u00de\u2212 iN0\u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe 2i \u03c0 ln 2 \u03b3\u03c1 ; \u03c1\u226a 1; \u00f070\u00de\nwith \u03b3 \u00bc 1.78107. We need only consider the magnitudes of the field expressions. Thus, the magnitudes of the fields measured at the minimum radius \u03b4 and at the cylinder radius R are related by\nE\u03b3z\u00f0\u03b4\u00deE\u03b3z\u00f0R\u00de \u00bc H \u00f02\u00de 0 \u00f0\u03c9\u03b4=c\u00de\nH\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R=c\u00de\n\u00bc 1\u00fe 2i \u03c0 ln 2c \u03b3\u03c9\u03b4\nH\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R=c\u00de \u00f071\u00de in physical units. We make finally some numerical estimates. Take R \u00bc 20 cm as a reasonable value for the cylinder radius, and choose for definiteness mac2 \u00bc 10\u22124 eV for the axion energy, which corresponds to \u03c9 \u00bc 1.52 \u00d7 1011 rad=s. Then, \u03c9R=c \u00bc 1.0 \u00d7 102, thus justifying use of the approximation (63). We get jH\u00f02\u00de0 \u00f0\u03c9R=c\u00dej \u00bc 0.080. With the minimum radius chosen as \u03b4 \u00bc 100 \u03bcm, corresponding to \u03c1min \u00bc \u03c9\u03b4=c \u00bc 0.051, it is seen that also the lowargument approximation (70) is justified. We obtain for the ratio (71)\nE\u03b3z\u00f0\u03b4\u00deE\u03b3z\u00f0R\u00de \u00bc 12.5 \u00d7 j1\u00fe 2.0ij \u00bc 28.0: \u00f072\u00de\nThere occurs thus a considerable enhancement of the amplitude in the neighborhood of the cylinder center. While the numerical values above were chosen so as to satisfy the mathematical approximations, there is clearly a flexibility of choosing different parameters that can better fit experimental conditions. We emphasize again that this enhancement is solely a geometrical focusing effect, being an extension of the theory worked out earlier [1] for plane geometry. An observation of the increased signal near r \u00bc 0 may be of experimental interest. The idea may be looked upon as an alternative to the idea recently put forward in Ref. [2], concerning the broadband solenoidal haloscope. The situation discussed above is obviously an idealistic one. In practice, an accurate positioning of the absorber would be needed, and the impedance-matched absorber should be with the property of having no reflection. One may ask if there exist broadband frequency reflectionless absorbers in the THz region that might be suitable for this purpose. Perhaps the use of metamaterials turns out to be useful in this context. We may mention here the paper of Zhang et al. on a broadband THz absorber based on dispersion-engineered catenary coupling in dual metasurface [48]. Indeed, the authors of [48] were able to obtain an ultrabroadband THz absorber with a bandwidth range from 0.52 to 4.4 THz, thus just in the region of interest. Similar investigations, in the GHz region, are given by Chen et al. [49] and Chen et al. [50]. A general review on metamaterial absorbers is recently given by Abdulkarim et al. [51]."
