    "abstractText": "Microtubule organization in cells is essential for the internal structure and coordination of events of intracellular transport, mitosis, and cell motility. For many cell types, microtubule organization is dominated by centrosomal nucleation that use gamma-tubulin to template filaments. Yet, some cell types lack centrosomes or centrioles, such as plant cells. Instead, microtubules nucleate from regions with high concentrations of microtubule binding and nucleating proteins. A mechanism that can drive high local concentrations of nucleators is liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we report that the plant microtubule nucleator and crosslinking protein, MAP65-1, can form phase separated condensates at physiological salt and temperature without extra crowding agents. These condensates are liquid at first and can mature to gel-like phases over time and with different environmental conditions. We show that these condensates can nucleate and grow microtubule bundles that form asters, regardless of the viscoelasticity of the condensate. When gel-like droplets nucleate and grow asters from a shell of tubulin at the surface, the microtubules are able to re-fluidize the MAP65 condensate. Condensate-induced cytoskeletal formation could be a universal mechanism for organization of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons in all cell types, especially cells without centrosomes.",

For many cell types, microtubule organization is dominated by centrosomal nucleation that use gamma-tubulin to template filaments. Yet, some cell types lack centrosomes or centrioles, such as plant cells. Instead, microtubules nucleate from regions with high concentrations of microtubule binding and nucleating proteins. A mechanism that can drive high local concentrations of nucleators is liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we report that the plant microtubule nucleator and crosslinking protein, MAP65-1, can form phase separated condensates at physiological salt and temperature without extra crowding agents. These condensates are liquid at first and can mature to gel-like phases over time and with different environmental conditions. We show that these condensates can nucleate and grow microtubule bundles that form asters, regardless of the viscoelasticity of the condensate. When gel-like droplets nucleate and grow asters from a shell of tubulin at the surface, the microtubules are able to re-fluidize the MAP65 condensate. Condensate-induced cytoskeletal formation could be a universal mechanism for organization of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons in all cell types, especially cells without centrosomes.\nliquid-liquid phase separation | microtubule asters | aging | self-organization | MAP65-1 Correspondence: jlross@syr.edu"

            "text": "Intracellular microtubule organization gives cells the structure and support to perform the myriad functions needed to coordinate their activities within tissues. Cell morphology, cell division, and even cell motility are driven by the microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubule nucleation and growth must be regulated tightly in order to control the organization for each process in space and time. Microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) control nucleation and growth. In most cell types, the MTOC is synonymous with the centrosome containing the centriole, a complex made of gamma tubulin and other proteins organized into a barrel shape that can template microtubules directly. An important role of the centrosome is to organize the spindle poles in dividing cells (1). Yet,\nthe centrosome is dispensable for even the most important processes, including mitosis (2, 3). For instance, the centrosome can be genetically eliminated (4\u20136) or ablated with a laser (7, 8), and the cell can continue through mitosis. Some cells, such as plant cells and meiotic animal egg cells, have no centrosomes (9, 10). In these cases, other organelles can nucleate microtubules in various regions of the cell including the perinuclear region (11\u201313), near chromosomes (14\u2013 16), from kinetochore fibers (17), and the Golgi complex (18, 19). Moreover, microtubules themselves can nucleate new microtubules from their surfaces to create branched networks (20, 21).\nRecently, it has been shown that condensed, liquid droplets of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), such as tau, TPX2, CAMPSAP2, and BuGZ, Abl2, and +Tip proteins, can form condensates via LLPS and nucleate microtubules when free tubulin is added to these condensates (21\u201328). Tau is a good candidate for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), since it is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) known to selfassociate (29, 30), although it requires the addition of extra crowders to condense (22, 23). The ability of tau to form LLPS is affected by the sequence including known mutations that are observed in patients with dementia and other neurological disorders (31). The positive and negative effects of LLPS formation by tau are still being examined.\nMAP65-1 (MAP65) is a microtubule-associated protein crosslinker from the PRC1/MAP65/Ase1 family that can promote nucleation of the microtubules (32). Here, we demonstrate a possible mechanism for microtubule nucleation and organization by MAP65 via LLPS. We show that both MAP65 and PRC1 can condense into liquid-like droplets in vitro without added crowding agents. Additionally, we show MAP65 droplets age into viscoelastic gels. When free tubulin is added, both the liquid and gel-like condensates concentrate tubulin, nucleate and grow microtubule in a spatially controlled manner to create microtubule organizations such as asters and spindle-like tactoid assemblies. Interestingly, we observe MAP65 mobility on microtubule aster bundles created from aged condensates is faster than aged condensates themselves, implying that the nucleated microtubules can deage MAP65 condensates, reversing hardening. Collectively,\nSahu et al. | bioR\u03c7iv | October 23, 2022 | 1\u20138\nDR AF\nT\nthis work suggests that phase separated MAP65 condensates can act as a non-centrosomal nucleation and growth center for microtubules in plant cells."

            "text": "MAP65 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation. In this study we used full length WT MAP65-1 (MAP65) from Arabidopsis, which is part of the Ase1/PRC1/MAP65 family. The full-length MAP65 has four rod and spectrin domains along the sequence and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in the C-terminal tail (Fig. 1Ai) as predicted by two different PONDR algorithms (VSL3 and VL3, Fig. 1Aii) (33). Moreover, we find blocks of locally concentrated positive and negative charge regions, predicted by CIDER net charge per residue (NCPR), in the IDR regions (Fig. 1Aiii). These molecular properties are known markers of proteins that can condense, making MAP65 a good candidate to form condensates. We observed that purified, full-length MAP65 forms condensates via LLPS at 22 \u00b1 1 oC in a typical tubulin polymerization buffer, PEM-80 (80 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2) at pH 6.8 (Fig. 1B). For confocal imaging, 10% of MAP65 was tagged with green fluorescent protein MAP65 (GFP-MAP65), which allowed us visualize round droplets using confocal fluorescence imaging (Fig. 1Bi). To ensure that GFP is not driving condensation, we imaged unlabeled full-length MAP65 using transmitted light microscopy in the same conditions and found that unlabeled MAP65 also formed condensates (Fig. 1Bii). From confocal imaging, we observed that the MAP65 droplets are a single condensed phase that is composed of a MAP65-rich domain separated from the surrounding solution. There are no inhomogeneities or higher density regions within the droplet. We quantified the partition coefficient, p, to determine the relative difference in concentration between the droplet inside and outside using the intensity profile through a single confocal slice in the middle of the droplet, p = Iin/Iout (Fig. 1C), where Iin and Iout are the average intensity inside and outside the condensate, respectively. We find that p = 20.5 \u00b1 0.3 when the MAP65 concentration is 14\u00b5M (mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 2466 droplets). Droplets can form when there is only 1 \u00b5M MAP65 (SI text, Fig. S2). As the MAP65 concentration increases, the size, total number, and partition coefficient of droplets increases, but the partition coefficient saturates above 10 \u00b5M (SI text, Fig. S2). Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we test the mobility of the molecules within a condensate. We use a 405 nm laser to photobleach a small region within the droplet and image recovery (Fig. 1D). We quantify the fluorescence of the region over time, as described in the supplement (SI text, Fig. S1). The average fluorescence intensity of the spot rapidly recovers to 60%\u221265% within a 2 min timescale (Fig. 1D). This data indicates that the MAP65 in the condensate is mobile and liquid-like. MAP65 condensates are able to wet a glass cover slip surface when the glass is untreated. Using a confocal z-stack,\nwe reconstruct and measure the contact angle for wetting the surface. For bare glass, the contact angle, \u03b8 \u223c 50o (Fig. 1Ei). Wetting the surface inhibits further experiments such as fusion experiments to characterize condensate size and material properties. To reduce wetting, we pre-coat the cover glass surface with a polymer brush, Pluronic-F127, described in previous papers (34, 35). The polymer brush surface prevents protein adsorption and facilitates surface dewetting with an approximate contact angle \u03b8 \u223c 130o (Fig. 1Eii). This surface coating allows MAP65 condensates to diffuse on the surface. When two MAP65 condensates come close and touch each other by thermal motion, they fuse into a single droplet rapidly (Fig. 1F). Imaging confocal z-stacks over time during merging events, we quantify the droplet volumes before and after fusion. We repeated the experiment using transmitted light imaging to ensure there are no discrepancies due to using fluorescence. Plotting the volume of the merged final droplet, V3, as a function of the summed volume of the two droplets before merging, V1 + V2, we find that the slope is one, as expected if the volume is constant before and after droplet merging (Fig. 1Fii). MAP65 is the plant analog of the PRC1 protein from mammalian cells that organizes microtubules during mitosis. Fulllength PRC1 has similar domains as MAP65, including spectrin domains and an intrinsically disordered tail, similar charge distributions, and similar predictions for unstructured regions. We demonstrate that PRC1 can also form condensates (SI text, Fig. S3). Many protein condensates are sensitive to environmental parameters such as temperature and ionic strength of the environment (36). The addition of salt inhibits MAP65 condensate formation, reducing both the condensate number density and droplet size (SI text, Fig. S4). The theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of MAP65 is 5.07 estimated using ExPasy Protparam, suggesting that MAP65 is overall negatively charged at pH 6.8, but the charge distribution has positive and negative charges distributed along the length with a positively charged tail (SI text, Fig. S4). Unsurprisingly given their similar charge nature, both MAP65 and PRC1 show reduced condensate formation with increasing monovalent salt concentration (SI text, Fig. S4). We find that temperature affects MAP65 condensation in an unexpected manner (SI text, Fig. S4). At low temperature 4 oC, many small droplets form. At room temeperature, the droplets were large and round, but at high temperature, 37 oC, droplets were non-spherical and adhered to one another indicating nucleation and growth of condensates with incomplete merging events between multiple droplets that are no longer liquid. This data implies that the temperature causes a transition from liquid to gel-like condensates, a process termed aging. For PRC1 at 37 oC, condensates are still round and liquid-like; they do not display aging (SI text, Fig."

Several proteins such as FUS, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, EWS, TAF15, and FIB1 are reported to form condensates that become gel-like with time (37\u201346).\n2 | bioR\u03c7iv Sahu et al. | Asters from MAP65 condensates\nDR\nAF\nT\nThe change in the material properties from fluid-like to viscoelastic gels has been referred to as aging, hardening, or maturation of droplets. Aging can be probed using FRAP to quantify molecular mobility within the droplet and droplet fusion events to measure the surface tension changes (Fig. 2A). After maturation, mobility and merging cease. Droplets stick, but cannot coalesce because the molecules are jammed, as observed for MAP65 condensates at high temperature (SI text, Fig. S4). Here, we test the effects of time on MAP65 droplet maturation using FRAP to measure molecular mobility (Fig. 2B). Normalized fluorescence recovery curves are plotted and fit to this equation:\nI(t) = a+ b\n( t\n\u03c41/2 ) 1+ ( t\n\u03c41/2 ) (1) where I(t) is the intensity over time, a is initial intensity of the bleach, b is the intensity plateau at long times, and \u03c41/2 is the half-time of the recovery (Fig. 2D). The \u03c41/2 values show an upward trend with the time that characterizes the reduced mobility of condensate aging. An hour after mixing, \u03c41/2 = 27.16 \u00b1 1.86 s, which jumps up two-fold at 4.5 hours, which is \u03c41/2 = 56.33 \u00b1 3.38 s (Fig. 2D,E, Table 1). Using the mobility recovery time, we estimate an apparent diffusion coefficient, Dapp, for the MAP65 molecules inside\nTable 1. MAP65 condensate aging data\nTime \u03c41/2 (s) Dapp Mobile Approx.

The Dapp decreases as the droplets age over hours (Fig. 2F, Table 1). Using a second method (49), we find similar Dapp values, implying the method is robust.\nTo observe MAP65 molecule incorporation into the droplets from outside and mobility of MAP65 molecules at the droplet boundary, we also photobleached whole droplets at different maturation times (SI text, Fig. S5-S6). The mobility is quantified by plotting and fitting the radially averaged intensity profile from each droplet to the solution from 1D diffusion equation (SI text, Fig. S5-S6). We estimate the internal diffusion co-efficient, Din from the best fit (SI text, Fig. S6), and we find that the measured diffusion coefficient Din is similar to the apparent diffusion coefficientDapp when using a small interior spot (Table 1, SI text, Table S1, Fig. S6).\nSahu et al. | Asters from MAP65 condensates bioR\u03c7iv | 3\nDR AF\nT\nThe diffusion of protein molecules are coupled to the viscosity of the solvent by the Stokes-Einstein equation: D = kBT 6\u03c0\u03b7Rh , where D is the diffusion coefficient, kB is the Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T is the temperature in K, \u03b7 is the dynamic viscosity, and Rh is the hydrodynamic radius of the protein. The hydrodynamic radius, Rh, of MAP65, was reported to be \u223c 42 \u00c5 (50). From D \u223c Dapp and Rh, we estimate the dynamic viscosity of the condensate as the droplets age (Table 1). At early times, the estimated viscosity is \u03b7 \u223c 4.7 Pa-s or 4670 mPa-s, which is similar to the viscosity of honey. For comparison, the dynamic viscosity of water at 22 oC is 0.95 mPa-s. The rate of droplet merging can be quantified to find the surface tension of LLPS condensates (full method in SI text). When droplets are liquid-like, we plot time of droplet merging against the characteristic size of the merging droplets, and the slope is proportional to the ratio of viscosity to surface tension (SI text, Fig. S7 A). Using the viscosity found from Dapp, the surface tension of liquid-like droplets is \u03b3 \u223c 12.3 \u00b5N/m in the first hour. At long times, droplets can no longer merge (SI text, Fig. S7 B), as expected for viscoelastic gels. From the plateau value of the FRAP recovery curve, we estimate the mobile fraction of the molecules in the droplets. The mobile fraction dropped from \u223c 60% after one hour of maturation, to \u223c 14% after four and half hours. The reduction in mobile fraction was fit to an exponential form to reveal that a\nsmall fraction ( \u223c 13%) of molecules remains mobile as the droplets age (Fig. 2G).\nMicrotubule aster nucleation and growth from condensates. Condensates of microtubule-associated proteins can nucleate cytoskeletal networks by increasing the local concentration inside the condensate (21, 22, 24, 51). To test if MAP65 condensates can concentrate tubulin and nucleate microtubules, we perform experiments with tubulin added after droplets form. We examine the effect on microtubule organization as a function of droplet viscosity and size. First, we examine the accumulation of tubulin into condensates by adding a low concentration of tubulin, [TUB] = 3.75\u00b5M without nucleotide to pre-formed MAP65 condensates made with 10\u00b5M MAP65. Droplets were examined 30 minutes after adding tubulin, and \u223c 50% contained tubulin (Fig. 3A). An intensity scan of a confocal slice through the center of the droplet is used to determine the partition\n4 | bioR\u03c7iv Sahu et al. | Asters from MAP65 condensates\nDR AF\nT\ncoefficient (Fig. 3Ai). We find that the average partition coefficient for tubulin inside compared to outside the droplet is p = 7.2 \u00b1 0.3 (mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 55 droplets). Given the total concentration of tubulin added, we estimate that the concentration inside these droplets is \u223c 26 \u00b5M high enough to nucleate microtubules locally, if we had provided nucleotide to the system. When tubulin without nucleotide is added to MAP65 condensates that have aged and become more gel-like, tubulin is excluded from the MAP65 condensate core and forms a shell of tubulin on the condensate surface (Fig. 3Aii). The tubulin at the edge is highly enriched to p = 4.8 \u00b1 0.2 (mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 26 droplets). The intensity of tubulin inside the center of the droplet is higher than the background, but not as enriched, only 2.1 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 26 droplets) compared to the outside of the droplet. We estimate that the tubulin concentration in the ring is \u223c 18 \u00b5M , which should be able to nucleate microtubules when there is nucleotide. Next, we examine if the tubulin co-localization can nucleate and grow microtubules from the condensate. We add GMPcPP and the same tubulin concentration to pre-formed droplets at [MAP65] = 28\u00b5M . For liquid-like droplets, the tubulin is able to diffuse into the middle of the droplet and form microtubule asters with MAP65 bound to the microtubules (Fig. 3Bi). For gel-like MAP65 condensates, microtubule asters still form, but there is a core of MAP65 where tubulin is excluded at the center (Fig. 3Bii). MAP65 is found to distribute along the microtubules of the aster. In addition to asters with many protruding microtubule bundles, we also observed microtubule tactoids in the same sample (Fig. 3Biii). Tactoids are finite sized, tapered bun-\ndles of microtubules which we have previously observed when microtubules were nucleated in the presence of MAP65 (34, 35). In this experiment, tactoids appear to be nucleated and grown from small MAP65 droplets, which likely only support bidirectional microtubule growth. It is possible that the finite size of the tactoids we previously observed were nucleated and grown from small MAP65 droplets that formed prior to tubulin nucleation and growth.\nMicrotubules de-age gel-like condensates. To examine the mobility of each species in the condensates with tubulin, we perform two-color FRAP on gel-like MAP65 droplets that co-localized tubulin dimers or nucleated asters (Fig. 4A). In the absence of nucleotide, MAP65 recovery is minimal, with a smaller mobile fraction (2%) and similar recovery time compared to what was measured for gel-like MAP65 condensates without tubulin (Fig. 2). The tubulin FRAP shows an interesting biphasic recovery. We fit the normalized mean intensity with a double exponential equation, ITUB(t) = A(1 \u2212 e\u2212t/\u03c4TUB,1) +B(1 \u2212 e\u2212t/\u03c4TUB,2). The fast timescale is on the order of 5 s, and the slower recovery is 300 s (Fig. 4Aiii). We test if the center of the droplet is less mobile for tubulin by quantifying the recovery rates in the core compared to the edge of the droplet. We find the same biphasic recovery for the center of the condensate and the edge (data not shown), implying that tubulin can move with two distinct rates in any location within the MAP65 droplet. Next, we perform FRAP on microtubule asters formed around gel-like MAP65 condensates. We find that the mobile fraction of MAP65 is an order of magnitude higher and the recovery timescale is two times faster in the presence of\nSahu et al. | Asters from MAP65 condensates bioR\u03c7iv | 5\nDR AF\nT\nthe microtubules (Fig. 4B). The tubulin, which is now polymerized into microtubules, is less mobile in asters, and the recovery is still biphasic. The mobile fraction drops by a factor of three, the faster timescale increases by a factor of two, and the longer timescale increases by a factor of five (Fig. 4Biii). This result is surprising, since the aster is formed around an aged MAP65 condensate that has low MAP65 mobility without microtubules, indicating that the formation of the microtubules can release MAP65 from the gel-like core and alter the phase of the condensed MAP65. This phenomena is not a product of the tubulin, but requires microtubules to nucleate and grow."

            "text": "In this study we show that the microtubule-crosslinking proteins, MAP65 and PRC1 are both able to form condensates at low salt and moderate temperature in vitro (Fig. 1, SI text, Figs. S2-S4). Excitingly, we find that this activity is temperature and salt-dependent, but does not require extra crowding agents, as observed for other MAPs, such as tau (22, 31), which is likely due to their molecular properties (Fig. 1, SI text, Fig. S3). We find that MAP65 condensates age over time and transition from liquid-like to gel-like state. The gel-like state for MAP65 is never fully solid, since there is still a small mobile fraction (13%) that recovers even at 4.5 hours (Fig. 2). This implies that the core of the aged condensate is likely a viscoelastic network of MAP65 molecules, as opposed to a crystaline solid or a rigid aggregate. Regardless of the maturation state of the MAP65 condensate, they are able to co-localize high concentrations of tubulin to cause localized nucleation and growth of microtubules (Fig. 3). This could allow MAP65 condensates to serve as microtubule-organizing centers in plant cells. Indeed, MAP65 family proteins are important for creating the phragmoplast in plant cells during mitosis (52, 53) and directing the cortical microtubule array in plants (32, 54). The maturation of the droplet controls the localization of tubulin, creating a shell of tubulin when the droplet is aged (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the MAP65 mobile fraction in the presence of tubulin dimers is even smaller (2%), implying the tubulin shell impedes MAP65 mobility. Similar phase separations have been observed for traditional condensates from RNA-binding proteins and RNA with various viscoelasticity parameters for each phase (55). In our experiments, the tubulin shell appears to create a barrier for MAP65 diffusion. One might expect that the barrier created by tubulin on aged MAP65 droplets could be exacerbated when the tubulin nucleates and grows microtubules, creating a cage around the MAP65 condensate. Instead of creating a larger barrier, we find that microtubules fluidize the gel-like MAP65 condensates - increasing both the mobile fraction and mobility of MAP65 molecules in the aged condensates (Fig. 4). Thus, the microtubules are able to reverse the gel-like phase change of MAP65 droplets, refluidizing and effectively \u201cde-aging\u201d the droplets. The ability of microtubules to reverse the aging of droplets\ncorroborates the idea that the mature condensates are viscoelastic networks. In the aged condensates, MAP65 molecules likely bind to each other to form a polymer network inside the less mobile core. We postulate that when microtubules form, they reduce the MAP65-MAP65 interactions in favor of MAP65-microtubule interactions. Further, although microtubules appear excluded from the condensate core, the microtubules at the edge are likely able to draw out and exchange MAP65 at the condensate edge, increasing the mobile fraction and decreasing recovery time (Fig. 4). Microtubule organization depends on the viscosity and the size of the MAP65 condensates. Large droplets form asters, and small droplets form finite-sized microtubule tactoid bundles that were tapered at the ends. Such spindle-like microtubule assemblies are like liquid crystal tactoids which were previously observed for microtubules (34, 35) and actin (56, 57). A recent report demonstrated that condensates made of actin-bundling protein VASP can nucleate actin to make tactoid-shaped bundles (58). The use of cytoskeletal-associated proteins to form condensates that can direct the organization of microtubules and actin is likely a general organizational principle in cells. Indeed, cytoskeletal fiber formation has recently been reported for numerous cellular and in vitro studies for microtubules (21, 22, 25) and actin (58\u201361). This may suggest that cells use this universal strategy to control cytoskeletal filament organization (62), but it is especially important for cell-types or regions of the cell that do not have centrioles to nucleate and grow microtubules in the traditional manner. Further, demonstrating that the aging of these condensates is not a barrier to nucleation and growth makes the condensate-based cytoskeletal organzation mechanism more useful and applicable."
