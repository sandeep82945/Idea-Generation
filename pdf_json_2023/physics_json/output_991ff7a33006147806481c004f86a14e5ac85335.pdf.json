    "abstractText": "This work studied the effect of different electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of acetamide-chalcone derivatives. The results showed that the addition of the dimethylamine group led to a large fluorescence emission (71% of fluorescence quantum yield in DMSO solution) that can be triggered by two and three-photon excitations, which is essential for biological applications. Furthermore, dimethylamine also red-shifts the lower energy state by approximately 90 nm, increasing the two-photon absorption cross-section of the lower energy band by more than 100% compared with the other studied compounds. All compounds presented two-electronic states observed through one and two-photon absorption spectroscopy and confirmed by Quantum Chemistry Calculations (QCCs). QCC results were also used to model the experimental two-photon absorption cross-sectional spectrum by the Sum-Over-States (SOS) approach, revealing a dependence between the coupling of the ground state with the first excited state and the transition dipole moment between these states.",

            "text": "In previous years, the incorporation of electron-withdrawing (EW) and electrondonating (ED) groups in organic molecules\u2019 backbones has been driving a great variety of biological, photonic, and optoelectronic applications [1\u20136], owing to the ability of such groups to enhance the linear and nonlinear optical of the organic structure [7]. A wellknown example of this molecular structure is EX-\u03c0-EX, where X can be a withdrawing or donating group and \u03c0 is the organic backbone. Due to the charge transfer mechanisms, this type of molecular arrangement provides higher polarizability, improving the optical response. In this vein, it is fundamental to study new organic backbones with different EW and ED groups to find the optimal structures to improve emerging applications. Chalcones, also known as \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated ketones, are present in an extensive range of optical applications, such as second harmonic generation [8\u201313], holographic recording technology [14], and photorefractive polymers [15], to name a few. In addition, owing to the intrinsic structural flexibility, functionality, and electron mobility of chalcones, modulation of third-order nonlinearities has been explored [1,2,4,16,17].

In addition, by performing TD-DFT calculations, we were able to identify the nature of the electronic states and simulate the absorption spectra, which agree considerably with the experimental ones. The results revealed a structured (asymmetric) absorption band (see Figure S3). The first transition was more intense and was found at c.a. 334 nm, and the second one had a lower intensity and was located at c.a. 285 nm. Furthermore, the average variances of the transition energy of the first and second bands of the theoretical results with the experimental ones were 0.014 and 0.027 eV, respectively. In this direction, from the Gaussian decomposition (Figure S2), the spectral position of both electronic transitions was determined (see Table 1), and transition dipole moments from the ground to the first and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 4 of 17\nsecond excited states (\u00b501 and \u00b502, respectively), were calculated (see Table 2) by employing Equation (S1).\nTable 1.

The first excited state (\u03b501) ranged from 21,665 M\u22121cm\u22121 to 35,169 M\u22121cm\u22121. Therefore, values of \u03b501, \u03b502 followed the same behavior in their value for compounds with overlapped electronic states, as well as for ChN(CH3)2, corroborating that the group -N(CH3)2 is shifting the lower energy band. Therefore, the origin of the lower energy band may be related to a charge transfer process from the donor-acceptor group at the para-position of ring B to the keto-phenyl part through the \u03c0-bridge [27].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 5 of 17\nTwo-photon absorption cross-section (\u03b42PA) spectra (see Figure 2, circles) were determined through the tunable femtosecond Z-Scan technique. The nonlinear absorption spectra were collected from 520 nm up to 750 nm with a 10 nm step. Two main two-photon peaks were observed along the nonlinear absorption spectra, which supported the interpretation that at least two excited states are allowed along such a spectral region. It is worth noting that the spectral position of 1PA, determined through Gaussian decomposition, overlapped with the measured peaks of the 2PA spectra. In addition, the second excited state had a higher 2PA cross-section magnitude than the first excited state for all compounds, with the exception of ChN(CH3)2, which presented the higher value of difference state dipole moment (see Table 2) and hence a higher value of nonlinear polarizability. Results of 2PA cross-section maxima values are presented in Table 1 for two electronic states that are allowed by two-photon absorption processes. The 2PA lower energy band was centered at around 700 nm, except for ChN(CH3)2, which was at c.a. 840 nm, while the higher energy one was around 630 nm, again, except for ChNO2 which was at c.a. 555 nm. For the second excited state, values of the 2PA cross-section (\u03b42PAS2 ) ranged from 28 GM to 53 GM. However, among all the studied compounds, only ChOCH2CH3 presented a \u03b42PAS2 higher than 40 GM. The considerable dispersion between the 2PA values between the compounds may be related to the electron-withdrawing/donating groups bonded in the main conjugated molecular structure. The results obtained in this work for the 2PA cross-section can be compared with those reported by Abeg\u00e3o et al. [4], also obtained using fs-laser pulses for unsubstituted and mono-substituted chalcone derivatives. For mono-substituted chalcone derivatives, the bonded group was -OCH3 at the para-position, similar to the compound ChOCH3 in this work. They obtained a 2PA cross-section of 14 GM c.a. 630 nm, which is two times lower than the ChOCH3 compound, showing that the presence of an acetamide group at ring A led to an increase in the 2PA cross-section. For the reported unsubstituted chalcone [4], the value was even smaller (9 GM), which, when compared to the para-unsubstituted compound (ChH), was three times lower. Santos et al. [28] also reported values of 24 GM and 17 GM for the 2PA cross-section of brome and chlore substituted dibenzylideneacetone, which were very similar to chalcone derivatives in terms of structure, while for ChBr, a value of 33 GM was measured, reinforcing the importance of the acetamide group at ring A. Cust\u00f3dio et al. [6] also reported chalcone derivatives with a maximum 2PA cross-section of 17 GM c.a. 630 nm, which is at least two times lower than the value of the compounds studied in this work. Besides 1PA and 2PA studies, QCCs were employed to visualize the electronic charge density of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of acetamide-chalcone derivatives in order to investigate the nature of transitions. Figure 3 displays the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) for all compounds. The lowest energy band for all molecules was described predominantly by the HOMO\u2192 LUMO excitation (ca. 83%) and the highest energy band by the HOMO-1\u2192 LUMO excitation (ca. 83%) (See Figure S4), both having \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* nature. This corroborates the initial analysis that the -N(CH3)2 group led to a large red-shift of the lower energy band. The HOMOs of the compounds ChH, ChCH3, ChCH2CH3, and ChBr were very similar, showing a delocalization of the \u03c0-electrons over the entire scaffold. From the LUMOs, it was noted that the electrons had shifted to the carbonyl in the center, which was also observed for other chalcone derivatives [1]. Something similar happened for the compounds ChOCH3 and ChOCH2CH3, except for the smaller electronic density distribution around ring A in the HOMO orbital. The HOMO \u2192 LUMO excitation of the ChN(CH3)2 and ChNO2 molecules involved a more pronounced electronic charge transfer. This feature was evidenced by the substantial electronic charge density around ring B in HOMO for ChN(CH3)2, revealing the strong ability to donate electrons of the -N(CH3)2 group and, in LUMO, an electronic density distribution over the molecule structure. On the other hand, the compound ChNO2 presented an electronic charge transfer from A to ring B due to the electron-withdrawing strength of the -NO2 substituent. The compounds showed a\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 6 of 17\ndecrease in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap concerning the ChH molecule. This justified the increase in the 2PA, as a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap makes the compound more polarizable and, consequently, improves the nonlinear responses [29]. Furthermore, due to the high polarizability and intramolecular charge transfer process, it was noted that their FMOs (HOMO/LUMO) had a large overlap, resulting in higher oscillator strengths [30] (see Table S1). Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 7 of 17\nIt is worth describing that ChN(CH3)2 is the only compound that shows fluorescence emission. These measurements were made in all compounds dissolved in DMSO at 10\u22126 M concentration. This fact may be understood because the dimethylamine group (-N(CH3)2) at the para-position of the B ring increases intramolecular charge transfer processes [18,23,27,31,32]. Such a group, owing to its strong electron-donor character, induces the unexpected formation of a huge dipole moment in the excited state, leading not only to a charge and molecular rearrangement of the solute but also to a structural rearrangement then creating an emissive intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. Taking advantage of the fluorescence emission of compound ChN(CH3)2, fluorescence anisotropy (r), represented by the red circles in Figure 4, was measured for ChN(CH3)2. It is important to note that a constant value of r along the lower energy band indicates that in this spectral region, only one electronic state is being reached [33]. In this way, the strong electron-donor character of -N(CH3)2 allows a large red-shift of the lower energy band, making it possible to observe both absorption bands separated when compared to the other compounds. In addition, to confirm the nature of the observed fluorescence signal of ChN(CH3)2, the inset of Figure 3 shows that the fluorescence spectrum position is independent of the excitation wavelength, according to \u2018Kasha\u2019s rule\u2019 [34,35].

The inset displays the fluorescence spectrum for different excitation wavelengths.\nTo obtain more insight into the features of the emissive ICT state of ChN(CH3)2,\nmeasurements of fluorescence quantum yields (\u03d5) in different solvents are shown in Fig-\nure 5 as a function of solvent polarity (expressed in ET(30) [36]).

It is worth noting that in DMSO, the solvent used for the nonlinear optical meas-\nurements, the value of \ud835\udf19 was 71%. For solvents such as ethanol and methanol, the fluo-\nrescence quantum yield exhibited a strong reduction in the fluorescence quantum yield\n(positive solvatokinetic) of 4% and 1%, respectively. The observed low values of \u03d5 for non-\npolar solvents (toluene, for instance) could be explained by the proximity effect of n\u03c0*\nand \u03c0\u03c0* states, which may destabilize the emitting state, hence quenching the fluores-\ncence emission [31,37]. On the other hand, for the negative solvatokinetic effect, molecular\nconformational changes may be the main reason for increasing the values of \u03d5. For alco-\nhols solvents, such as ethanol and methanol, the ability to form hydrogen bonds between\nthe solvent and the solute leads to fluorescence quenching owing to the deactivation of the lone pair of -N(CH3)2 [38], elucidating the low values of \u03d5 in these solvents.\nFigure 4.

A large bathochromic shift for polar solvents elucidated the strong ICT charac-\nter of the first excited state. The permanent dipole moment difference (\u0394\u03bc01) in DMSO was\ncalculated via the Lippert-Mataga equation [39,40]:\n\u0394\u03bd = \u0394\u03bc01\n2\nhca3 \u0394f (1)\nin which \u0394\u03bd is the Stoke Shift for a certain solvent, h is the Planck constant, c is the light\nspeed, \u201ca\u201d is the Onsager cavity radius, and \u0394f is the Onsager polarity function, given by\n\u0394f = 2((\u03b5 \u2212 1)/((2\u03b5 + 1)) + (n2 \u2212 1)/((2n2 + 1))), in which \u03b5 and n are the dielectric constant and\nrefractive index of the solvent in question.

In this way, the only missing parameter is the Onsager cavity radius, which was determined through the Smoluchovski-Einstein equation [41]:\nl \u03b7 (\n0. r 1 ) (2) where Vol is the spherical hydrodynamic volume occupied by the molecule in the surrounding medium, K is the Bolt t t, is the room temperature, \u03b7 is the solvent visco ity (1.996 cP for DMSO), r is the anisotropy fi \u03c4 is the fluorescence\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 9 of 17\nlifetime, which was determined through time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) measurements (Figure 6d\u2014circles).\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 18\nFigure 6.

In this way, the permanent dipole moment difference was calculated (using a3exp), and a value of \u2206\u00b501 = 7.1 D was found, which is in agreement with the one obtained from the QCC (see Table 2). The large value of \u2206\u00b501 is owing to the strong electron-donating character of the -N(CH3)2 group, leading to a high charge density distribution on the first excited state, as seen in its FMO (see Figure 2). Besides the importance of understanding the charge transfer mechanism, the value of \u2206\u00b501 was also used as an input parameter in the phenomenological SOS approach to better model the 2PA results. To obtain more information about the electronic properties of the studied compounds, 2PA spectra were modeled by the Sum-Over-States (SOS) approach [42] (Figure 1, red lines), aiming to connect molecular parameters determined through linear spectroscopy with the nonlinear absorption spectrum (see Equation (3)). As confirmed by 1PA, 2PA, and QCCs, there are two electronic states that contributed to the absorptive nonlinearities.

To minimize the number of free parameters of the SOS approach and better fit the 2PA results, the following procedure was employed. Transition dipole moments (\u00b501 and \u00b502) were obtained through the Gaussian decomposition method, while \u2206\u00b501 and \u2206\u00b502 were determined with QCCs, with the exception of ChN(CH3)2 because of its fluorescent nature, whose \u2206\u00b501 could be experimentally determined, as discussed earlier. In this way, the only free parameter in the SOS model was \u00b512. Results of \u00b501, \u00b502, \u2206\u00b501, \u2206\u00b502, and \u00b512 can be seen in Table 2. As we can note from Figure 2, the obtained values of \u2206\u00b501 and \u2206\u00b502, from QCCs, and \u00b501 and \u00b502, from Gaussian decomposition, well describe the experimental 2PA results (Figure 2\u2014red lines). In addition, it should be mentioned that it is a rough task to determine \u00b512 experimentally, making the SOS approach an excellent tool for finding it. The results of the QCCs revealed that the permanent dipole moment difference (\u2206\u00b501) for compounds ChH, ChCH3, and ChCH2CH3 were 2.5 D, 4.6 D, and 4.8 D, respectively, while for compounds with oxygen atoms (ChOCH3 and ChOCH2CH3) were 3.1 D, revealing that the oxygen atom may be decreasing the charge density distribution in the excited state. In addition, compounds ChNO2 and ChN(CH3)2 also displayed large \u2206\u00b501 because of the strong electron-donor character of this group, while ChH was the lower one due to the absence of EW/ED groups. Another important feature elucidated by the SOS approach was the photophysical parameter \u00b512, which presented lower values for compounds that presented higher shifts between electronic states S1 and S2. For instance, compounds such as ChOCH2CH3, ChNO2, and ChN(CH3)2 presented values ranging from 1.4 D to 3.7 D. This result was expected as the first excited state and the second one for these compounds was clearly shifted with respect to the other compounds, leading to a decrease in the excited states coupling. For other compounds for which both excited states overlapped, \u00b512 presented a low dispersion ranging from 4.3 D to 5.8 D. As mentioned before, fluorescent chalcones have been extensively used in a wide range of biological applications. In this way, fluorescent chalcones presenting a fluorescence signal triggered by 2 and 3 photon excitations (2PE and 3PE, respectively) in the infrared spectral region are of interest for applications that require light excitation at the therapeutic window. Thus, fluorescence induced through 2PE (black circles\u2014Figure 7) and 3PE (red circles\u2014Figure 7) were analyzed for compound ChN(CH3)2, employing a femtosecond pulse laser with excitation wavelength (\u03bbex) at 900 nm and 1190 nm, respectively. It should be mentioned that the ability to fluoresce via 3PE has not been reported so far for similar compounds, as far as we know. Additionally, the low toxicity of compounds similar to ChN(CH3)2 was already reported [43,44], which is essential for biological applications. Thus, the fluorescence was collected by an optical fiber for different excitation pulse energies, and plotted in a log-log scale, revealing an angular coefficient equal to 2 (for 2PE) and 3 (for 3PE), thus confirming that the fluorescence emission was triggered by 2PE and 3PE. The active 2PA cross-section (product between the 2PA cross-sectional peak and the fluorescence quantum yields in DMSO solution) was calculated, which is also known as 2PA brightness, showing a value of 40 GM. To the best of our knowledge, such results have never been achieved for similar compounds.

For linear absorption nd fluorescence emission measurements, a spectrometer UV VIS Shimadzu 1800 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and fluorimet r Hitac i F-7000 (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) were employed, respectively.\n\u2022 Fluorescence Anisotropy measurements To determine the anisotropy coefficient, a fluorimeter Hitachi F-7000 (Hitachi HighTechnologies, Tokyo, Japan) was employed. Fluorescence anisotropy is given by r = (Ivv \u2212 GIvh)/(Ivv + 2GIvh), and their values can vary in a range between \u22120.2 (if transition dipole moment is perpendicular to emission dipole moment) and 0.4 (if transition dipole moment is parallel to emission dipole moment). The indexes hh, hv, vh, and vv are related to the emission and excitation polarization channels (v = vertical and h = horizontal), which can be controlled through the use of two polarizers. In the fluorescence anisotropy definition, G = Ivh/Ihh is associated with the sensibility of the emission and excitation channels of the fluorimeter, and I is the emission intensity for different excitation wavelengths (excitation spectrum). Figure 4 shows the absorption spectra (black line) and fluorescence anisotropy (red circles) for ChN(CH3)2 dissolved in DMSO.\n\u2022 Time-resolved fluorescence technique To collect the fluorescence lifetime signal, we employed a femtosecond laser pulse (CPA 2001, Clark MXR) at 385 nm (second harmonic of fundamental) as excitation. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 13 of 17\nfluorescence signal was collected perpendicularly to the excitation through an optical fiber connected to a photodetector. A digital oscilloscope was employed to visualize the signal. A mathematical convolution was applied to separate instruments artifacts from the real fluorescence signal, using the following procedure: Imeasured = Ireal \u2217 IRF (with Imeasured being the measured fluorescence signal, Ireal the real fluorescence decay and IRF refers to the instrument response function). Therefore, a reference signal without any sample fluorescence was taken to collect the IRF signal.\n\u2022 Tunable Femtosecond Z-Scan technique To measure the two-photon absorption cross-section spectrum, the tunable femtosecond open-aperture Z-Scan technique was employed. For this purpose, a femtosecond laser (CLARK, MXR\u00ae) centered at 775 nm with a pulse duration of 150 fs and a 1 kHz repetition rate pumps the Topas-Quantronix optical parametric amplifier (Light Conversion\u00ae) generating pulses from 460 nm to 2600 nm. This way, it was possible to determine the 2PA cross-section from 530 nm to 760 nm for all chalcone derivatives. For more details about the experimental setup, see Refs. [46\u201348].\n\u2022 Quantum Chemistry Calculations Quantum chemistry calculations (QCC) were performed to corroborate the experimental analyses using a Gaussian 09 package [49]. For this purpose, analyses were performed at the theoretical level of the density functional theory (DFT) to obtain the optimized geometry of the molecules in the ground state using the hybrid B3LYP functional [50] combined with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set [51]. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed along with this calculation to confirm that minimum structures were reached [52]. Subsequently, the optimized structures were used to perform the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations to determine the 15 lowest-energy singlet electronic transitions and the permanent dipole moments of the ground (\u00b500) and excited states (\u00b5kk, k > 0), with which the difference between the dipole moments (\u2206\u00b50k= \u00b5kk \u2212 \u00b500, k > 0) was estimated [1]. For this purpose, the CAM-B3LYP functional [53] was combined with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. In the base set, 6-311G(d,p) was added to the diffuse function \u201c++\u201d to better describe electronic transitions [54]. Some of the side substituents can induce the molecules to have a charge transfer characteristic; therefore, it was chosen to use the long-range corrected CAM-B3LYP functional in the TD-DFT calculations [55]. In addition, all calculations were performed both in a vacuum and in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solvent medium using the polarizable continuous model (PCM) [56]."

            "text": "This work studied the role of different EW and ED groups on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of eight acetamide-chalcone derivatives. Two excited states were observed for this class of compounds, and both of them can be accessed by 1PA and 2PA processes. The existence of these states was corroborated through QCCs and the Gaussian decomposition method. The coupling between these states strongly depends on the EW or ED linked to the main molecular structure; such features were elucidated and quantified by the SOS approach by determining transition dipole moments between the first and second excited states. The incorporation of dimethylamine groups revealed an excellent path to promote a significant enhancement of linear and nonlinear optical properties in chalcone derivatives. An example is an increase of 100% in the 2PA cross-section at the lower energy band and the creation of a highly emissive excited state (71% of fluorescence quantum yield in DMF and DMSO). Finally, fluorescence triggered by 2PE (\u03bbex = 900 nm) and 3PE (\u03bbex = 1190 nm) were conducted, showing great potential for dimethylamine-chalcone derivatives as multiphoton fluorescent probes.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1572 14 of 17\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28041572/s1, Figure S1: Graph of absorbance as a function of molar concentration to determine the molar absorption coefficient for (a) ChH (b) ChCH3 (c)ChCH2CH3 (d) ChOCH3 (e) ChOCH2CH3 (f) ChN(CH3)2 (g) ChBr, and (h)ChNO2.
