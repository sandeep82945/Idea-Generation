    "abstractText": "A theoretical exploration and an analytical model for the electro-magneto-hydrodynamics (EMHD) of leaky dielectric liquid droplets, suspended in an immiscible confined fluid domain has been presented. The analytical solution for the system, under small deformation approximation, in creeping flow regime, has been put forward. Study of the droplet deformation suggests that its temporal evolution is exponential, and dependents on the electric and magnetic field interaction. Further, the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the electric field decides whether the contribution of magnetic forces opposes or aids the interfacial net electrical force due to the electric field. Validation of the proposed model at the asymptotic limits of vanishing magnetic field show that the model accurately reduces to the case of transient electrohydrodynamic model. We also propose a magnetic discriminating function (\u03c6M ) to quantify the steady-state droplet deformation in the presence of interacting electric and magnetic fields. The change of droplets from spherical shape to prolate, and oblate spheroids, correspond to \u03c6M>0 and <0 regimes, respectively. It is shown that with the aid of low magnitude magnetic field, a substantial augmentation in the deformation parameter, and the associated EMHD circulation within and around the droplet is achieved. The analysis also reveals the deformation lag and specific critical parameters that aid or suppressed this lag behaviour; discussed in terms of relevant non-dimensional parameters.",

The analytical solution for the system, under small deformation approximation, in creeping flow regime, has been put forward. Study of the droplet deformation suggests that its temporal evolution is exponential, and dependents on the electric and magnetic field interaction. Further, the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the electric field decides whether the contribution of magnetic forces opposes or aids the interfacial net electrical force due to the electric field. Validation of the proposed model at the asymptotic limits of vanishing magnetic field show that the model accurately reduces to the case of transient electrohydrodynamic model. We also propose a magnetic discriminating function (\u03d5M ) to quantify the steady-state droplet deformation in the presence of interacting electric and magnetic fields. The change of droplets from spherical shape to prolate, and oblate spheroids, correspond to \u03d5M>0 and <0 regimes, respectively. It is shown that with the aid of low magnitude magnetic field, a substantial augmentation in the deformation parameter, and the associated EMHD circulation within and around the droplet is achieved. The analysis also reveals the deformation lag and specific critical parameters that aid or suppressed this lag behaviour; discussed in terms of relevant non-dimensional parameters.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe study of electric field-driven hydrodynamics at small scales, such as suspended liquid drops, is essential because of its relevance in wide range of industrial applications. A droplet, initially of spherical shape due to surface tension, may deform in the desired direction in presence of electric (E\u20d7) and magnetic field (B\u20d7), or their interactions. Many existing studies exclusively discuss the effect of electric field on the drop deformation dynamics, and associated electrohydrodynamics (EHD). The combined effect of electric and magnetic field (EMHD) could be more efficient for droplet manipulations than their corresponding individual effects. At the low Reynolds number regime, surface and capillary forces largely dominate the inertial forces. Consequently, it is exceedingly difficult to mix, manipulate, or transport droplets solely by hydrodynamic forces. In that sense, EMHD strategies that could be excellent solutions and can be exploited.\nEHD study of droplets is useful in understanding of natural phenomena like the deformation and fragmentation behaviour of water droplets in thunderclouds [1]. Industrial applications such as EHD atomization is relevant for electro-spraying and electro-spinning [2]. Applications in the area of microfluidics, like manipulation of droplets in lab-on-a-chip by electro-wetting or electrocapillarity [3], protein transfection into cells by electrical manipulation of droplets [4], the enhancement of heat or mass transfer to a drop by chaotic advection due to\n\u2217 Corresponding author: devranjan.samanta@iitrpr.ac.in \u2020 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Tech-\nnology Ropar, Punjab\u2013140001, India \u2021 Hydrodynamics and Thermal Multiphysics Lab (HTML), De-\npartment of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal\u2013721302, India\nEHD flows [5], inkjet printing [6, 7], and in EHD pumps, electrospray mass spectrometry, electrospray nanotechnology [7]. Other examples are phase separation by liquid-liquid extraction, dewatering of fine suspensions, and electrophoretic separation of biological materials [8]. There are certain applications where the efficiency of the process may be enhanced by imposing both electric and magnetic field, [9], EMHD micropump [10], and EMHD flow of blood [11], etc. In all these applications, droplet deformation is governed by the interplay of interfacial electrical, magnetic, and hydrodynamic stresses [5, 12\u2013 16].\nStudies on \u201celectro-hydrostatic theory\u201d [17, 18] consider droplets as perfect dielectrics, or perfectly conducting liquids, suspended in an ideal dielectric surrounding fluid. In both cases, the droplet deforms as a prolate spheroid. It deforms in the electric field direction as theory predicts that net electrical stress is normal to the interface and directed from higher to lower values of permittivity. Allan and Mason [19] performed experiments and concluded that conducting droplets deform to prolate spheroid form; agreeing with the theory. They also showed that perfect dielectric droplets also deform perpendicular to the direction of the electric field to an oblate spheroid. Taylor [17] further showed that the oblate deformation is due to the interaction of hydrodynamic stresses along with electrical stresses at the interface. Due to this phenomenon, the bulk-free charges accumulate at the interface in presence of the electric field, and the possibility of net interfacial electrical stress arises [17, 20\u201322].\nDroplet EHD was developed through Taylor [17]\u2019s seminal work. He developed a mathematical framework for the steady-state axisymmetric EHD problem for an unconfined droplet in creeping flow regime, in the presence of low strength electric field (Eo). He showed that the ratio of electrical conductivity (R = \u03c3in/\u03c30), where in the\n2 article the subscripts \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019 represent the droplet and surrounding fluid, respectively) and the ratio of the electrical permittivity (S = \u03f5in/\u03f50) plays a vital role in droplet deformation and EHD flow within the droplet and the surrounding. He observed that the electric field establishes rotational motion in the droplet, consisting of four equal strength vortices matching the corresponding vortices of the surrounding liquid. For R<S, the surrounding liquid flow from the poles to the equator, whereas flow reverses for R>S. For R=S, there will be no flow as the interface becomes charge free. The importance of the Capillary number (Ca = \u00b5ouc/\u03b3, where \u00b5o is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, uc is the velocity scale, and \u03b3 is the coefficient of surface tension at the interface) was discussed. At low Ca, droplet deforms into ellipsoidal shape, and at higher Ca regime, droplet deviates from the ellipsoidal shape, and beyond a certain critical Ca, droplet disintegrates into smaller droplets [23].\nNext, Melcher and Taylor [20] reported the mathematical analysis for EHD under the influence of uniform finite electrical conductivity and permittivity. Leaky dielectric fluid was considered, where the system is not coupled with the electric field due to the absence of bulk charges. His pioneering study involves electromechanical coupling due to discontinuities of the electrical properties at the interfacial region, resulting in EHD motion. Vizika and Saville [15] found the expressions for steady-state deformation (Dss) of the drop using Taylor\u2019s solution, by balancing normal interfacial stresses. Other works have used the deformation definition of Taylor [24] and predicted the end shape of the droplet from the sign of the Taylor discriminating function (\u03d5) [16], and its magnitude is proportional to the applied electric field strength (E2o). Other studies based on similar grounds report leaky dielectric droplet dynamics[17, 19, 20, 22, 25\u201330] considering steady state EHD and without confinements.\nTransient EHD of droplets [12, 16, 31\u201333] and the confinement of the droplet [13] have been explored sparsely in literature. Esmaeeli and Sharifi [31] developed a mathematical model for the temporal evolution of leaky dielectric spherical droplets and distortion from a circular shape for a leaky dielectric liquid column [12] during EHD. Later, Esmaeeli and Behjatian [13] also considered confined domains in their study, a condition where droplet and surrounding fluid dimensions are comparable. Their analysis show that in a confined domain R>1 system, the electric field strengthens and flow field intensity either remains the same or increases; and similarly, for R<1, the electric field and flow field intensity decrease. Later, Mandal et al. [34] considered both transient and confinement effects with finite charge relaxation time in their analysis. They found that the interfacial charging process consumes less time in a confined domain than in an unconfined domain. In transient EHD, liquid drops deform monotonically when the droplet interface charges rapidly, and non-monotonically when charge relaxation is finite [35, 36].\nTsukada et al. [37] studied the effect of inertia (us-\ning Galerkin finite element calculations) and compared their numerical and experimental results with Taylor\u2019s results. They show that as the electric field strength increases, the asymptotic solution of Taylor is no longer valid as inertia also acts. Feng [38] further showed that induced flow intensity reduces due to interfacial free charge convection. Additionally, they explored that oblate droplets deform less when the charge convection is present. The opposite is true for prolate shape droplets, where charge convection aids deformation. Works show that as the electric field strength increases, droplets may become unstable and disintegrate above a critical field strength [18, 39]. Sherwood [40] performed experiments and numerical simulations to study the effect of electric fields on the droplet breakup process in the surrounding fluid. Two modes of breakup were noted: (a) when the S>1, then small daughter droplets stream away from the droplet forming pointed filaments, and (b) division of the droplet into two large daughters, connected by thin liquid thread when the R>1. Lac and Homsy [28] extended Sherwood [40]\u2019s work through simulations to identify different breakup modes and the effect of the viscosity of the fluids. Later Bentenitis and Krause [41] proposed an extended leaky dielectric method (EDLM) to analyse highly deformed droplets under strong electric field intensity. They suggest two modes of deformation at a high electric field: continuous deformation or hysteresis.\nA comprehensive study of the literature reveals that an understanding of droplet dynamics under the simultaneous effect of the electric and magnetic fields (EMHD) is unavailable. Further, though attention has been given to the steady-state and transient analysis of a droplet EHD in confined or unconfined domain, most studies ignore the complexities associated with the Lorentz force. The impact of EMHD would be especially important for droplets or surroundings with high electrical conductivities, such as strong electrolytes, ionic liquids, and liquid metals. Orthogonal electric and magnetic fields would result in a net driving body force to stimulate the internal and surrounding hydrodynamics and the droplet deformation kinetics. Based on the above motivation, explore the problem of transient EMHD of a droplet in a generalized confined domain, and portray its mathematical nature. We determine the temporal evolution of droplet deformation and EMHD flow field under the small deformation approximation. We validate our droplet deformation and flow results at the asymptotic limits of zero magnetic field; and are able to recover the EHD behaviour as shown in literature. We have also performed a detailed analysis of droplet deformation parameters by varying electric field strength keeping magnetic field strength constant, and vice versa. Finally, we show the influence of strength and direction of applied magnetic field on the variation of droplet deformation parameter and on the streamline patterns of the EMHD flow compared to pure EHD scenario.\n3"

            "text": "Figure 1 shows the schematic of the physical problem. The spherical dielectric liquid droplet of radius Rin is suspended in another immiscible dielectric liquid medium, confined by a rigid spherical container of radius Ro. The immersed droplet and the container are concentric at the origin. We have adopted the spherical coordinate system (r, \u03b8, \u03d5) to analyze the problem. The fluids are neutrally buoyant and stationary due to symmetry, and the center of mass of the system remains at the origin. As we are assuming an axisymmetric spherical coordinate system, the flow field within the droplet and in the confined domain remain axisymmetric to the direction of applied uniform electric field Eo (along y-axis) and steady uniform magnetic field (B) perpendicular to the Eo. Hence, our problem is independent of the azimuthal direction (\u03d5) [14, 17, 31]. However, in case of strong magnetic field, this assumption may not be valid and induced magnetic field may not be negligible [42].\nOur study is restricted to a small intensity of the electric field, so the axisymmetric assumption is valid. The deformation due to the electrical, magnetic, and hydrodynamic stresses is also influenced by the confining domain. Based on previous studies [43\u201346], we have implemented certain assumptions for further simplification of the mathematical model, as:\n1. Fluids are assumed to be Newtonian. The physical properties of the fluids are time invariant and also due to application of electric and magnetic field.\n2. Initially, the droplet shape is spherical. Both droplet and confined surrounding liquid are concentric throughout.\n3. Applied electric field is of low strength such that there is no induced additional magnetic field. The electric field is irrotational (i.e., \u2207\u20d7 \u00d7 \u2212\u2192E = \u2212\u21920 ), and the flow field is axisymmetric to it.\n4. The electric Reynolds number (ReE = \u03b5ouc/\u03c3oRin<<1) signifies the relative order of charge convection to the Ohmic conduction. This leads to negligible charge relaxation time compared to charge convection.\n5. In case of the leaky dielectrics, on application of electric field, charges from bulk liquid move to the droplet interface. Hence the charge density in the bulk fluid is zero, but non-zero at the interface.\n6. The external applied magnetic field across the drop interface is continuous and does not change as the drop deforms.\nThe physical properties of the illustrative droplet and confined liquids have been tabulated in II. Relevant ratios used are R, S and \u03bb=\u00b5in/\u00b50 (the dynamic viscosity ratio)\n[17]. For non-dimensionalization, the radius of the drop is selected as the length scale (lc \u223cRin), the velocity scale (uc \u223c \u03f5oE2oRo/\u00b5o) is obtained by balancing electrical and viscous stresses, and the time scale (tc \u223c\u00b5oRo/\u03b3) denotes the time the droplet takes to reach an equilibrium shape after field is applied. This includes charge relaxation time and shape relaxation time scales. The charge relaxation time is the time taken by all the charges to reach the interface, and the shape relaxation time is the time taken by the droplet to reach a stable, deformed shape. The other relevant parameters are the pressure scale (pc \u223c \u00b5ouc/Ro), electric potential scale (\u03d5c \u223c EoRo), and surface charge density scale (qc \u223c \u03b5oEo)."

Since the surrounding liquid has constant properties and no charge in the bulk fluid (leaky dielectric model), the electric field equations may be decoupled from the flow equations. Thereby, the hydrodynamics equations are solved via momentum jump condition [20, 21, 48] across the interface. The approach is used to solve a transition jump in normal and tangential stresses across the interface induced by the electric and magnetic field and property mismatch. The electric field intensity is irrotational and divergence-free (for leaky dielectric with a small dynamic electric current).

A perfect leaky system, where both droplet and surrounding liquid are leaky dielectrics with small finite electrical conductivity. The electric potential distribution is obtained by solving \u2207\u20d7 \u00b7 (\u03c3\u2207\u20d7\u03d5) = 0 [43, 49, 50]. This results from the conservation of electric charge, (\u2207.J + DqvDt = 0), where J is free current density.\n2. A perfect dielectric system, where the two fluids are ideal dielectric. The Gauss law is applicable, which relates the electric displacement of free charges to the volumetric charge density (qv) of a system having permittivity (\u03f5) as \u2207\u20d7 \u00b7 (\u03b5\u2207\u20d7\u03d5) = qv [51]. For a perfect dielectric system, the bulk charge density is zero. Hence the electric potential distribution is obtained from \u2207\u20d7 \u00b7 (\u03b5\u2207\u20d7\u03d5) = 0.\nEquation 1 is constrained in the present case by the following boundary and interfacial conditions:\n(a1) \u03d5in(0,\u03b8) is bounded, i.e., electric potential within the droplet should be finite.\n(a2) The electric potential should be continuous across the interface, i.e. \u03d5in(1,\u03b8) = \u03d5o(1,\u03b8). This leads to in symmetric distribution of electric field in azimuthal direction throughout.\n(a3) J\u2212\u03b5\u2207\u20d7\u03d5.n\u0302K = q(t,\u03b8), i.e., charge conduction and convection balance one another. This results in the nonsymmetric distribution of the electric field in a normal direction within the system and leads to distribution of charge density across the interface. Here n\u0302 is the normal outward vector to the droplet surface, and, JQK = Qo\u2212 Qin denotes the jump in any generic parameter Q across the interface.\n(a4) Electric potential near the wall of the spherical container varies as \u03d5o(1/\u03b1,\u03b8) = \u2212cos\u03b8\u03b1 , where \u03b1 is the confinement ratio (defined as the ratio of Rin and Ro).\nDue to electric and magnetic fields, the interface of the droplet will not be perfectly spherical and will deform. To quantify the temporal evolution of deformation, a deformation parameter is proposed as: |D| = L\u2212BL\u2212B , where\nL and B are the lengths of axis oriented parallel to the direction of the applied electric field, and perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field, respectively. Our small deformation scenario suggests |D| \u226a 1."

            "text": "The distribution of surface charge density is estimated from charge conservation across the droplet interface, which is caused due to a jump in electric displacement across the interface. Electric charge conservation is a fundamental principle and will not be affected by the applied external magnetic field. The magnetic field can alter the motion of the system\u2019s charged particle but can\u2019t destroy or create charges. The charges move from the bulk fluid to the interface due to electric potential gradients or carried by the flow. The charge transportation for leaky dielectric liquids is small in the external magnetic field. These liquids have low electrical conductivity, permittivity, permeability and induced current due to the interaction of externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Further, the mathematical analysis compares the charge relaxation time of the electrical and magnetic phenomena.\nRelaxation time for the electrical phenomena (\u03c4E) = electrical permittivity (\u03b5) electrical conductivity (\u03c3)\nRelaxation time for the electrical phenomena (\u03c4B) = magnetic permeability (\u00b5)\u00d7 conductivity (\u03c3)\u00d7 l2c\nBy using the properties of the system, \u03c4E = O ( 10\u22123sec ) & \u03c4B = O ( 10\u221212sec ) , i.e. \u03c4E \u226b \u03c4B . It can be observed that charge transportation due to magnetic phenomena is much less affected than due to electrical phenomena. Once all the charges reach the interface, then the magnetic effect coupled with the electrical effect affects the deformation and the flow field analysis.\nThe non-dimensional form of charge conservation across the interface (ignoring lateral surface diffusion) [21, 33] is as:\nSa Oh2 \u2202q \u2202t +ReE\n[ u\u20d7 \u00b7 \u2212\u2192 \u2207sq\u2212 qn\u0302 \u00b7 (n\u0302 \u00b7 \u2207\u20d7)u\u20d7 ] = J\u2212\u03c3\u2207\u20d7\u03d5K \u00b7 n\u0302 (2)\nwhere, \u2212\u2192\u2207s = \u2207\u20d7\u2212 n\u0302 \u00b7 (n\u0302 \u00b7 \u2207\u20d7) is the surface divergence, and non-dimensional numbers are Sa = \u03b5ouo/\u03c3oR2in (a form of ratio of the electric Stokes number to Electroviscous number), Ohnesorge Number (Oh = \u00b5o/ \u221a \u03c1oRin\u03b3, relates\n5 the viscous force to inertia and surface tension force) and ReE. Mathematically these non-dimensional numbers can be expressed as the ratio of various time scales as: \u03c4E\u03c4p = Sa Oh2 = \u03b5o/\u03c3o \u00b5oRin/\u03b3 and \u03c4E \u03c4f\n= ReE = \u03b5o/\u03c3o\u00b5o/uc . Here, \u03c4E = \u03b5o/\u03c3o = characteristic time for charge relaxation. A small value of \u03c4c suggests rapid charging of the interface Ha and Yang [52]. \u03c4p = \u00b5oRin/\u03b3 = surface deformation time scale or capillary time scale \u03c4f = Rin/uc = convection flow time scale \u03c4\u00b5 = Rin2/vo = time scale of momentum diffusion by viscosity In LHS of Equation 2, 1st term depicts displacement current. This term plays a role in very low electrical conductivities when interface charging time becomes comparable with the deformation time scale. In contrast, 2nd term shows convection of surface charge at the interface due to fluid flow and dilation, while the RHS term shows Ohmic conduction normal to the interface. Applying order of magnitude analysis using properties from Table II, we found that the 2nd term of the LHS is negligible compared to the others. Consequently the Equation 2 is reduced as:\nSa Oh2 \u2202q \u2202t = J\u2212\u03c3\u2207\u20d7\u03d5K \u00b7 n\u0302 (3)"

The 2nd term represents polarization due to nonuniformity of the electrical permittivity. The 3rd term signifies electrostrictive force arising due to variation of electrical permittivity with density at a fixed temperature. As the permittivity is constant the 3rd term can be neglected. The 2nd term is non-zero only at the interface of the two fluids. For the leaky dielectric model, free charge density in the bulk fluid is zero. But free charge density is not zero at the interface. So due to\nimpose electric field, the electrical forces are non-zero at the interface. These electrical forces at the interface cause electrohydrodynamic coupling.\nThe magnetic force (\u2212\u2192fM ) can be evaluated from Lorentz force under assumption of an irrotational applied electric field, as:\n\u2212\u2192 fM = J\u20d7 \u00d7 B\u20d7 (7)\nHere, J is free electric current density, related to the electric field by Ohm\u2019s law as J\u20d7 = \u03c3(E\u20d7+ u\u20d7\u00d7 B\u20d7).

By this argument, 1st term of LHS can be neglected. Further, by order of magnitude analysis, the 2nd term of LHS is negligible in creeping flows, and the 3rd term of RHS can also be neglected as the electromagnetic effect is insignificant compared to the viscous effect due to non-availability of free charge density in the bulk fluid. Since induced current due to interaction of electric and magnetic field is negligible, the 4th term of RHS of the equation can be neglected. All such effects are significant at the interface, and shall be brought in later separately into the formulation.

Solving Equation 38 with the initial condition of charge free droplet interface i.e., q (0, \u03b8) is zero gives\nd1 = ( R\u22121 R+2 )[ (R+2) (R+2)\u2212\u03b13(R\u22121) ] + ( 3(S\u2212R)\n(R+2)(S+2)\n)[ (R+2)\n(R+2)\u2212\u03b13(R\u22121)\n][ (S+2)\n(S+2)\u2212\u03b13(S\u22121)\n] e \u2212 t\u03c41\ndm = 0,\u2200m\u2265 2\n(39)\nNow, the closed-form distribution function of electric potential is obtained as:\n\u03d5in (r,\u03b8) = \u22123\u0393Rr R+2\n[ 1\u2212 \u0393S(S\u2212R) ( 1\u2212\u03b13 ) S+2 e \u2212 t\u03c41 ] cos\u03b8\n\u03d5o(r,\u03b8) = \u2212\u0393R cos\u03b8 [( r\u2212 R\u22121\nR+2 1 r2 ) + 3\u0393S(S\u2212R)(R+2)(S+2) ( r\u03b13 \u2212 1 r2 ) e \u2212 t\u03c41\n(40)\nwhere, \u0393R = (R+2)(R+2)\u2212\u03b13(R\u22121) and \u0393S = (S+2)\n(S+2)\u2212\u03b13(S\u22121) are termed as confinement correction factors. The expression for distribution of the electric field can be obtained considering irrotational and divergence-free field, i.e.\nE\u20d7 = \u2212\u2207\u20d7\u03d5= \u2212 [ \u2202\u03d5\n\u2202r + 1 r \u2202\u03d5 \u2202\u03b8\n] (41)\nNow, from Equation 40 and Equation 41, the electric field distribution within the droplet and in the surrounding domain is obtained as:\nE\u20d7in = 3\u0393R\n(R+2)\n[ 1\u2212 \u0393S(S\u2212R) ( 1\u2212\u03b13 ) (S+2) e \u2212 t\u03c41 ]( cos\u03b8i\u0302r \u2212 sin\u03b8i\u0302\u03b8 ) (42)\nE\u20d7o = \u0393R cos\u03b8 [ 1+ 2(R\u22121)(R+2) 1 r3 + 3\u0393S(S\u2212R)(R+2)(S+2) ( \u03b13 + 2 r3 ) e \u2212 t\u03c41 ] i\u0302r\n\u2212\u0393R sin\u03b8 [ 1\u2212 (R\u22121)(R+2) 1 r3 + 3\u0393S(S\u2212R)(R+2)(S+2) ( \u03b13 \u2212 1 r3 ) e \u2212 t\u03c41 ] i\u0302\u03b8\n(43)\nThe charge distribution at the droplet interface is obtained by condition (a3), as:\nq(t,\u03b8) = 3\u0393R(R\u2212S)(R+2)\n( 1\u2212e\u2212 t \u03c41 ) cos\u03b8 (44)\n9 From the information of Equation 40-Equation 44, we can now deduce the jump in normal and shear stress across the interface, due to (i) electric field and (ii) the electromagnetic coupling. These interfacial stress jumps are responsible for circulation within the droplet and the confined domain, and the deformation of the droplet. The electrical stresses are calculated from the Maxwell stress tensor [13, 53\u201355]:\n\u03c4eij = \u03b5EiEj \u2212 1 2EkEk\u03b5\u03b4ij (45)\nHere, i and j are the tangential and the normal directions, respectively, and \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta function. So, we may express, jump in electrical shear stress is:\nJ\u03c4Er\u03b8K = J\u03b5ErE\u03b8K = Eo,rEo,\u03b8 \u2212SEin,rEin,\u03b8 = (Eo,r \u2212SEin,r)Ein,\u03b8 = qEin,\u03b8\nJ\u03c4Er\u03b8K = [ P1 +P2e\u2212 t \u03c41 +P3e\u2212 2t \u03c41 ] sin2\u03b8 (46)\nAnd, jump in normal electrical stress is:\nJ\u03c4ErrK = 1 2J\u03b5\n( E2r \u2212E2\u03b8 ) K = 12 [( E2o,r \u2212E2o,\u03b8 ) \u2212S ( E2in,r \u2212E2in,\u03b8 )]\nJ\u03c4ErrK = [ P4 +P5e\u2212 t \u03c41 +P6e\u2212 2t \u03c41 ] cos2 \u03b8+ [ 9 2 \u03932R(S\u22121) (R+2)2 +\n9\u03932R\u0393S(S\u2212R) ( \u03b13 \u22121 ) (S\u22121)\n(R+2)2(S+2) e \u2212 t\u03c41 +\n9\u03932R\u03932S(S\u2212R)2 ( \u03b13 \u22121 )2 (S\u22121) 2(R+2)2(S+2)2 e \u2212 2t\u03c41 ] (47)\nWhere, J\u03c4ErrK = [ P4 +P5e\u2212 t \u03c41 +P6e\u2212 2t \u03c41 ] cos2 \u03b8+ Term independent of cos2 \u03b8\nWe can express the shear ( \u03c4Br\u03b8 ) or normal ( \u03c4Brr ) stress tensor due to the coupling of the electric and magnetic fields as a linear function of the electric and magnetic field, i.e. \u03c4Br\u03b8 or \u03c4Brr = f(E,B,\u0393), where \u0393 is the parameter depends on the physical properties of the system. The magnetic effect due to the induced (local) magnetic field is small, so the magnetic field in the magnetic stress tensor is considered to be the applied magnetic field and not the local magnetic field. Since J\u03c4Er\u03b8K = f(sin2\u03b8) and J\u03c4ErrK = f ( cos2 \u03b8 ) , so J\u03c4Br\u03b8K and J\u03c4BrrK necessarily should be the function of sin2\u03b8 and cos2 \u03b8, respectively to satisfy the interfacial condition (b5) and (b6) respectively. Now by similarity and dimensional analysis of J\u03c4Br\u03b8K and J\u03c4Er\u03b8K of interfacial condition (b5) gives \u0393 = \u03c3\u0142c cos\u03b8.\nSo, Jump in shear stress due to electromagnetic coupling is as: J\u03c4Br\u03b8K = J\u03c3E\u03b8B cos\u03b8K = ( Eo,\u03b8B cos\u03b8\u2212REin,\u03b8B cos\u03b8 ) = (1\u2212R)Ein,\u03b8B cos\u03b8\nJ\u03c4Br\u03b8K = \u2212 3 2 \u0393R(1\u2212R)B (R+2)\n[ 1\u2212 \u0393S(S\u2212R) ( 1\u2212\u03b13 ) (S+2) e \u2212 t\u03c41 ] sin2\u03b8 (48)\nJump in normal stress due to electromagnetic coupling is as:\nJ\u03c4BrrK = J\u03c3ErB cos\u03b8K = (Eo,rB cos\u03b8\u2212REin,rB cos\u03b8) = (Eo,r \u2212REin,r)B cos\u03b8\nJ\u03c4BrrK = 3B\u03932r\u0393S(S\u2212R)cos2 \u03b8\n(S+2) e \u2212 t\u03c41 (49)\nC. Solution for droplet shape deformation parameter (D)\nUsing Equation 24, Equation 26, Equation 46, Equation 48 with condition (b5), we obtain the relationship\n1 2 [(\u22126Ao\u221216Bo\u22126Co\u221216Do)+\u03bb(6Cin+16Din)]+\n[ P1 +P2e\u2212 t \u03c41 +P3e\u2212 2t \u03c41 ] \u2212\n3 2 \u0393R(1\u2212R)B (R+2)\n[ 1\u2212 \u0393S(S\u2212R) ( 1\u2212\u03b13 ) (S+2) e \u2212 t\u03c41 ] = 0\n(50)\n10\nFrom Equation 49, Bo is obtained in terms of d(D)dt as:\nBo = P1 +P8e\u2212 t \u03c41 +P3e\n\u2212 2t\u03c41 + 3\u0393RB(R\u22121) 2(R+2) \u2212 f10dD Cadt f11 (51)\nWe also obtain the expressions of Cin, Din, Ao, Co, and Do in terms of d(D)dt by substituting Bo from Equation 51 into Equation 24. We use Equation 24, Equation 25, Equation 47, Equation 49, Equation 51 in condition (b6), and retain only terms of coefficient of cos2\u03b8 (to fulfill the jump condition of normal stresses across the interface). Subsequently, we obtain the expression for the shape deformation parameter (D) as:\ndD dt + 8 f18\nD = Ca [ q1 + q2e\u2212t/\u03c41 + q3e\u22122t/\u03c41 ] (52)\nHere, f18/8 is another time scale \u03c42 (\u03b1, \u03bb), which governs the droplet shape relaxation. Here, q1, q2, and q3 are the functions of R, S, \u03bb, \u03b1, and B. Their complete expressions are given in the appendix.\nThe shape of the droplet is undeformed and spherical at t = 0. Imposing the initial condition, we obtain\nD(t) =DSS ( 1\u2212Q1e\u2212 t \u03c41 \u2212Q2e \u2212 2t\u03c41 \u2212Q3e \u2212 t\u03c42 ) (53)\nThe expressions of Q1, Q2, and Q3 of equation (2.38) are described in the appendix. Here, Dss is the steady-state confined droplet deformation parameter, expressed as:\nDss = CaQ1\u03c42 = CaQ1f18 8 = 9Ca 16 \u03932R (R+2)2\u03d5M (54)\n\u03d5M = ( R2 \u22122S+1 ) + 35(R\u2212S)\u2118 (55)\n\u2118= 53 f17 f11\n[ 1\u2212 B ( R2 +R\u22122 ) 3(R\u2212S)\u0393R ] (56)\nWhere, \u03d5M is the proposed magnetic discriminating function that predicts the droplet\u2019s shape at steady-state when both fields are applied and \u2118 is a correction factor to Taylor\u2019s discriminating function. Both \u03d5M and \u2118 are the functions of (R,S,\u03bb,\u03b1,B).\nFor rapid charging of droplets, droplet shape is governed by time scale \u03c42. Now, from D(t) and d(D)/dt, the constants of stream functions (Cin,Din,Ao,B0,C0,Do) thus the generalised streamline equations and velocity fields may be deduced (see Equation 16 to Equation 24)."

            "text": "A. Variation of steady-state droplet deformation parameter (Dss) with \u03b1 and B\nFigure 2 (a and b) show Dss with varying Ca and magnetic field intensities for different \u03b1 for the two systems\ndescribed earlier (Table II). Figure 2a shows our theoretical model (Dss for magnetic field B=0 in unconfined domain) is in good agreement with the reports by Taylor [17] and experiments by Salipante and Vlahovska [42]. For R<S system, Taylor predicted deformation in the form of oblate spheroid. In our case, Dss is negative for oblate and positive for prolate spheroid. This is due to the alignment of the droplet dipole in opposite direction of the electric field. For R<S system, the charging response of surrounding fluid ( \u03c4E,out = \u03b5out\u03c3out ) is faster than\ndroplet ( \u03c4E,in = \u03b5in\u03c3oin ) . Due to the reverse dipole orientation, the net force due to polarization and Coulombic interactions acts inward at the pole. The net force at the equator thereby acts outwards to ensure no normal flow across the interface. Hence, the droplet deforms to oblate.\nFurther, for different \u03b1 (at 0.5 and 0.8) and B=0, our analytical expression of Dss is consistent with reports by Mandal et al. [34]. The confinement effects are not prominent at low \u03b1. As we increase \u03b1, significant deviation of Dss from Taylor [17]\u2019s unconfined case is observed. At \u03b1=0.5, the magnitude of Dss is lesser than the unconfined case. Here, the flow field in the droplet and surroundings will be affected due to interaction with the confining wall. So with an increase in \u03b1 , there is reduction in droplet shape relaxation due to an increase in viscous force [34]. This will lead to a reduction of Dss compared to the unconfined domain. The sense of deformation depends on J\u03c3HrrK and J\u03c4ErrK. For unconfined domain, the deformation due to J\u03c3HrrK depends only on the magnitude of the R-S such that prolate deformation occurs for R>S and vice-versa. For both confined and unconfined domains, the deformation due to J\u03c4ErrK for the R>S system is prolate (due to alignment of droplet dipole along the applied electric field). For the R<S system, the deformation in both confined and unconfined domain is oblate. For the unconfined R>S system, the contribution of J\u03c4ErrK is more than J\u03c3HrrK, and vice-versa.\nFrom condition (b5) it can be deduced that the drop assumes prolate shape for sum of J\u03c3HrrK and J\u03c4ErrK being positive, and oblate shape for negative value. For\n11\na confined R > S system, with increase in \u03b1, J\u03c3HrrK is decreasing, and J\u03c4ErrK will increase. So even though the reduction in J\u03c3HrrK may lead to change to oblate, the dominant J\u03c4ErrK will lead to overall deformation to the prolate. For a confined R<S system, J\u03c4ErrK will decrease with increase in \u03b1. However, with increase in \u03b1, the negative J\u03c3HrrK decreases, and eventually the sign changes to positive at a critical \u03b1. Consequently, shape reversal from oblate (\u03b1=0.5 Figure 2a) to prolate (\u03b1=0.8 Figure 2a) is noted. The steady-state variation of J\u03c3HrrK and J\u03c4ErrK with \u03b1 for B= 0 T, and B = \u00b11 T, are given in the Table 2 and 3 (supporting information).\nNext, we focus on the role of applied magnetic field for different \u03b1. As the current density at steady state becomes constant and uniform magnetic field is assumed across the interface, J\u03c4Mrr K tends to zero at steady state. Hence, J\u03c4Mrr K will participate in the temporal droplet shape evolution, and near the steady-state it is overshadowed by J\u03c3HrrK, which dictates the final deformed state along with J\u03c4ErrK. As a result, the magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK changes with a change in magnetic field intensity compared to B = 0 T.\nFigure 2(b-d) is plotted for the system A. Figure 2b demonstrates that at \u03b1=0.6, Dss increases with an increase in the B when applied inward (+B), and vice versa for outwards (-B). With the increase of +B, J\u03c3HrrK will de-\ncrease compared to B=0, however the sum of stresses is negative (condition b5) and the drop attains oblate shape and Dss will be higher compared to B=0. On the contrary, for B<0, J\u03c3HrrK is higher compared to B=0, and thus the Dss is lesser. Up to \u03b1\u2264 0.6, for \u22121T \u2264B \u2264 1T , the dominance of J\u03c4ErrK results in oblate spheroid deformation. For \u03b1 \u2265 0.7 (Figure 2c), the Dss is reduced for B=0. Now for B>0, as we increase B, the resultant J\u03c3HrrK decreases in comparison to B=0. But as the J\u03c4ErrK is dominant over J\u03c3HrrK , the net sum of the stresses causes oblate spheroid. Interestingly, shape reversal was observed for B<0, where J\u03c3HrrK is increases and dominates over J\u03c4ErrK. Consequently, the J\u03c4TrrK is positive and causes prolate spheroid.\nSimilarly, Figure 2(e-f) is plotted for the system B. Along similar lines, Figure 2e demonstrates that for \u03b1=0.6, the magnitude of Dss increases with an increase in the B when applied inward (-B) and vice versa (+B), exactly in contrast with system A. In such a case, the transition from prolate to oblate is exactly opposite to that of system A. Similar behavior is noted for \u03b1=0.9 (Figure 2f). Previous studies [17, 34] focused on dynamics of droplets in electric field ambience only predicted that shape will be always prolate for the R>S system. However, we show that on application of the magnetic field in a certain direction, shape reversal is possible due to the dominance of J\u03c3HrrK over J\u03c4ErrK.\nB. Variation of \u03d5M and Dss with \u03b1 at different B\nIt is evident from Equation 54 that Dss is dependent on \u03d5M . Although the remaining quanties in r.h.s. of Equation 54 are dependent on \u03b1 and will stay positive. On the contrary, only \u03d5M changes sign with change in \u03b1 and B. Hence, the sign of Dss is solely dependent on \u03d5M . In this section, we have highlighted the behaviour of \u03d5M and Dss with \u03b1 at different B in Figure 3 and SI.I. (supporting information) respectively for both systems. \u03d5M is dependent on the sum of the magnetic, hydrodynamic and electrical stresses. Similar to the criteria of the sign of the J\u03c4TrrK, \u03d5M>0 signifies the net effect in the direction of the applied electric field and the steady state shape is a prolate spheroid and vice-versa. Fig-\n12\nure 3a is plotted for the R<S system. Negative values of J\u03c4ErrK implies oblate deformation and the magnitude decreases with increase in \u03b1. Till \u03b1\u2264 0.5, the magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK decreases and the J\u03c4TrrK remains negative causing oblate droplet deformation. For 0.5 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0.65 regime, although the J\u03c3HrrK becomes positive and increases with increase in \u03b1, the J\u03c4TrrK stays negative results in oblate deformation. On further increase of \u03b1>0.65, as J\u03c3HrrK dominates over J\u03c4ErrK. The positive J\u03c4TrrK causes shape reversal from oblate to prolate spheroid. The critical \u03b1 at which the shape reversal happens varies with B.\nFigure 3b illustrates the variation of \u03d5M for system B. Upto \u03b1\u2264 0.65, the J\u03c4ErrK stays positive,increases with increase in \u03b1. However, the magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK decreases results in constant overall sum of the stresses So as evident from Figure 3b, \u03d5M assumes a positive constant value and droplet attains prolate spheroid shape. Beyond \u03b1>0.6, the J\u03c3HrrK changes its sign and magnitude increases with increase in \u03b1 results in significant change in the J\u03c4TrrK and consequently in the magnitude of \u03d5M . Finally, at \u03b1=0.9 and B=-1T, the dominance of J\u03c3HrrK over J\u03c4ErrK causes the J\u03c4TrrK to be of negative. Therefore, the \u03d5M assumes a negative value and signifies shape reversal.\nC. Quantitative analysis of Dss with combined EMHD\nFigure 4(a and b) show the quantitative analysis of Dss at \u03b1 = 0.9 for both systems. Compared to the base case (B=0T and E=8V/mm), increase of Eo from 8 V/mm to 12 V/mm augments Dss by 125% for both systems. If we proceed from the 2nd column (B=0 T) to 4th column (B=-1 T for Figure 4a and 1T for Figure 4b), the Dss is increased by \u223c 47% and \u223c 169% for system A and B respectively. So the overall increment in Dss for system A from base case to extreme case (Eo = 12 V/mm and B = -1.0 T) is \u223c 230%. Therefore it is evident that upon application of magnetic field the increment in Dss is nearly two times the increment of Dss due to presence of E0 only. Similarly for system B, increment in Dss\nfrom base case to extreme case (Eo = 12 V/mm and B = +1.0 T) is \u223c 505% which is nearly four times the increment of Dss due to only presence of Eo. This \u223c 505% of deformation is possible in the absence of a magnetic field when we increase the Eo from 8 V/mm to 16.25 V/mm. So it is evident that if there is a constraint in the magnitude of the Eo, the increase in Dss can be achieved by applying magnetic field along with electric field of lower magnitude. Here we have shown quantitative analysis for one extreme condition (i.e. \u03b1=0.9). This analysis is also valid for all other \u03b1 also.\nD. Variation of J\u03c4ErrK, J\u03c4Mrr K, J\u03c3HrrK, J\u03c4TrrK and temporal evolution of D with \u03b1 at different B\nFigure 5(j, k and l) shows the temporal droplet deformation with \u03b1 for system A at B = -1.0, 0.0 and +1.0T respectively. The variation of D at different \u03b1 for different B depends on the variation J\u03c4TrrK shown in Figure 5(g, h and i) for B = -1.0, 0.0 and +1.0T respectively. The variation of J\u03c4TrrK depends on the individual J\u03c3HrrK, J\u03c4ErrK and J\u03c4Mrr K for different B and \u03b1. The variation of J\u03c4ErrK for B=0 case is shown in Figure 5b. As J\u03c4ErrK is independent of B, the temporal variation for non-zero magnetic field cases is same as Figure 5b. The variation of J\u03c4Mrr K is shown in Figure 5(a and c) for B = -1.0 and 1.0T, respectively. The variation of J\u03c3HrrK is shown in Figure 5(d, e and f) for B = -1.0, 0 and 1.0T, respectively.\nIn presence of only electric field, initially, the droplet experiences the polarisation stress due to charge free interface, and attain prolate configuration. Later, due to presence of charges at the interface, shape dynamics are governed by the combined effect of polarisation stress and Coulombic force. The Coulombic force increases over time and tries to deform the droplet in oblate form for R<S system (Figure 5b). For system A, the suspended droplet is less conducting than the surrounding fluid. So, with the increase in \u03b1, the electrical effect of more conducting fluid decreases and vice-versa, resulting in a reduction of the magnitude of J\u03c4ErrK.\nThe variations of J\u03c4Mrr K are shown in Figure 5(a and c) at B = -1.0 and +1.0T respectively. When the magnetic field is applied in the -B direction, J\u03c4Mrr K will try for oblate deformation before reaching steady state condition and vice-versa. The magnitude of J\u03c4Mrr K will decrease with time and becomes nearly zero at the steady state.\nNow the J\u03c3HrrK are affected by both magnetic and electric fields (Figure 5d-f). The J\u03c3HrrK depends on J\u03c4Mrr K and JpK (i.e. J\u03c3HrrK=J\u03c4Mrr K-JpK). Figure 5e shows the variation of J\u03c3HrrK in the presence of the electric field only. Initially, J\u03c3HrrK is due to interaction of conducting fluid and later, the variation is also affected by the interfacial charge interaction with the applied electric field. Initially J\u03c3HrrK tends to create prolate deformation. With increase in time, the increase in pressure dominates the overall magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK and tends to create oblate deformation. The shape shifting behaviour from prolate to oblate de-\n13\nformation is observed till \u03b1=0.567. As we increase \u03b1, the magnitude of the hydrodynamic stress of the surrounding fluid will decrease as the space between the interface and container surface decreases. The magnitude of the J\u03c3HrrK in the region of 0.567 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0.90 regimes will try for prolate deformation as the magnitude of the hydrodynamic stress of the suspended droplet will dominate and increase in this region. In the presence of a magnetic field for B = -1.0T, the magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK increases with time compared to base case B=0T and vice-versa.\nThe temporal evolution of the droplet depends on the J\u03c4TrrK across the interface (Figure 5g-i). For base case, polarization and hydrodynamic stress initially act opposite and balance each other, leading to zero J\u03c4TrrK across the interface, i.e. no deformation (region of 10\u22123 \u2264 t\u2264 10\u22121 seconds) in Figure 5(h and k). Later (t\u2265 10\u22121 seconds), in the presence of charges at the interface, electrical and hydrodynamic stress act in the same direction, leading to a non-zero J\u03c4TrrK. The J\u03c4TrrK increases with time until the droplet reaches a steady state condition (region of 10\u22121 \u2264 t < 101 in Figure 5h). This increase in J\u03c4TrrK tends to cause oblate deformation. The magnitude of J\u03c4TrrK varies with the increase in \u03b1 depends on the variation of J\u03c4ErrK and J\u03c3HrrK. The jump variation of J\u03c4TrrK for\nsystem A decreases with the increase in \u03b1 as the electrical and hydrodynamic stress decreases with \u03b1 and the droplet will deform in an oblate shape (Figure 5k). At \u03b1=0.7, the electrical and hydrodynamic stress will act in opposite directions and balance each other, so there is no droplet deformation. For \u03b1>0.7, electrical and hydrodynamic stress will still act in opposite directions. However, now the hydrodynamic stress dominates over the electrical stress, so the shape is prolate.\nThe jump variation of the J\u03c4TrrK will also depend on the J\u03c4Mrr K (B \u0338= 0) along with the J\u03c4ErrK and J\u03c3HrrK (Figure 5g and i). The jump variation of the J\u03c4TrrK in the presence of a magnetic field for B =-1.0T increases compared to the base case and vice-versa. This change in the variation of the J\u03c4TrrK in the presence of the magnetic field is due to the appearance of J\u03c4Mrr K due to electromagnetic coupling and the change in J\u03c3HrrK due to interaction of conducting and charged fluid with the electric and magnetic field. At the same time, J\u03c4ErrK is independent of the B. As the droplet deformation parameter (D) of R<S system is dependent on the J\u03c4TrrK mentioned in interfacial condition (b6), the trends observed in D (Figure 5j-l) are similar to the trends of J\u03c4TrrK (Figure 5g-i). Figure SI.II (supporting information) shows a similar stress jump and droplet deformation variation analysis for system B. It is noteworthy that for both systems, the deformation increases compared to B=0T when the magnetic field effect act in the direction of the hydrodynamic effect and vice-versa."

For non-zero B cases, in the +B direction (Figure 6a), the D/Dss curve varies in a non-monotonic way over time. The D/Dss curve shifts in the negative direction with a prominent concave shape in the transient(10\u22122 \u2264 t\u2264 101 secs) region. The degree of concavity increases with the increase in B. In this region, the magnetic field enhances the magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK. For non-zero B cases in the \u2013B direction (Figure 6e), the D/Dss curve shifts in a positive direction from the base case. The nature of variation of B \u0338= 0 cases is similar to that of B=0T case, i.e. monotonically increasing nature in the transient regime( 3\u00d710\u22123 \u2264 t\u2264 10secs ) secs. This shifting is due to in-\ncrease in the magnitude of J\u03c3HrrK will lead towards enhancement in J\u03c4TrrK across the interface compared the base case.\nAs observed in Figure 6(b-d) and Figure 6(f-h), the degree of deviation from the base curve of D/Dss for B=0T condition decreases with an increase in \u03b1. As we increase \u03b1, the J\u03c4TrrK decreases (refer to the transient variation of stresses in 10\u22122 \u2264 t\u2264 10 regions in Table 4 and 5 of sup-\n14\nporting information). For the +B direction at \u03b1 \u2265 0.8, the deviation in the transient region is nearly the same as B=0T as the J\u03c4TrrK across the interface is nearly equal (Figure 6d). In contrast, for the \u2013B direction, even at \u03b1 \u2265 0.8, the J\u03c4TrrKin the transient region is not equal to the same as B=0T. Consequently, the deviation in the transition region is never the same as B=0T (Figure 6h). In the steady state regime, the J\u03c4Mrr K tends to zero due to constant current density across the interface and the assumption of the uniform magnetic field throughout the flow field. So, in the steady state regime, the D/Dss curve converges to a single curve irrespective of the magnitude of B.\nFor the R<S system (Figure SI.III), the deviation of the D/Dss curve for B \u0338= 0 cases from the base case is not discernible as the magnitude of the J\u03c4TrrK across the interface is not substantial in transient nature."

            "text": "The influence of electric field intensity on temporal evolution of the D for fixed B and \u03b1=0.9 are shown in Figure 7(a-c) for R<S system and Figure 7(d-f) for R>S system. The variation of D for other \u03b1 are similar to the variation of D at \u03b1=0.9. For variation at other \u03b1 of both systems, please refer to Figures SI.(IV-VI) of supporting information.\nOur analytical model shows that D is dependent on E2o (Equation 53). From Figure 7, it is evident that the magnitude ofD increases with the increase in Eo. Our studies are limited to the small deformation regime. At low Eo, the induced magnetic field is negligible and the droplet interface is uniform with no normal flow through it. The increment in the electric field will lead to an increase in the net electrical stress. The increase of the electrical stress is the sole reason for enhanced D for a fixed B. The individual variation of J\u03c4ErrK, J\u03c4Mrr K and J\u03c3HrrK with \u03b1, +B/-B for the different systems are discussed earlier in the preceding section, which determines the deformation dynamics of a droplet. On exceeding a specific limit of Eo, large deformation will lead to disintegration of the drop into secondary droplets [45]. The droplet disintegration occurs when the effect of J\u03c4TrrK increases beyond the limit of the capillary stress.\nFigure 7(a-c) shows the variation of D for the R<S system. It is evident that for all the cases presented in Figure 7(a-c) the drop always assumes a prolate shape. In case of B=-1 T, the deformation is more than the base case B=0T as the magnetic field will induce more \u03c3Hrr and vice-versa for B=+1T.\nFigure 7(d-f) highlights the temporal evolution ofD for R>S system. For the +B direction (B=1T), deformation increases compared to B=0T as the magnetic field will increase the \u03c3Hrr (Figure 7f). For both B=0 and +1T, the droplet tends to deform in prolate shape. However in case of B=-1T, the drop assumes oblate shape (Fig-\nure 7d). The shape reversal at B=-1T is due to the dominance of the \u03c3Hrr. In this case, \u03c3Hrr acts opposite to the hydrodynamic effect at B=0T resulting in shape shifting from prolate to oblate configuration.\nIf there is constraint in applying higher electric field strength, we can enhance the deformation of the droplet by modulating the magnitude and direction of B at a lower electric field intensity. Figure 8 shows the effect of B on the temporal evolution of D for different \u03b1 i.e. 0, 0.5 and 0.9. The electric field intensity is fixed at Eo = 10 V/mm for both the systems. For variation at intermediate \u03b1 for both systems, please refer to Figure SI.VII of the supporting information.\nThe droplet deformation parameter (D) at constant Eo increases or decreases at different B depending on whether the magnetic field enhances or decreases the \u03c3Hrr. When the magnetic field enhances \u03c3Hrr, deformation will increase and vice-versa.\n15\n[31] showed in their analysis that a drop size of 10 mm deforms in the order of 10\u22123 for the applied electric field of 10 V/mm for an unconfined domain. In our case, we are also considering a 10 mm droplet size under 10 V/mm magnitudes of the electric field. The deformation based on present model at B = 0.0 T is in the order of 10\u22123 for both the R<S system (Figure 5k, Figure 8a) and for the R>S system (Supplementary Figure SI.II, Figure 8d).\nFor R<S system (Figure 8a and b), although the magnitude ofD is changing with change in direction and magnitude of B, the overall configuration is of oblate shape identical to the base case. For the highest \u03b1 = 0.9, shape reversal from oblate to prolate configuration is observed for all B\u2019s. In this case the influence of B on \u03c3Hrr is more than that of electric field. In addition, the resultant \u03c3Hrr acts in opposite direction of the electric field, thereby causing the shape reversal.\nFor R>S system, from Figure 8d-e it is evident that although the drop tends to achieve oblate shape (B=+0.5 and +1T) in the transient regime (10\u22122 \u2264 t \u2264 10 secs), the steady state droplet configuration for all B\u2019s is prolate shape. However for the highest \u03b1 = 0.9, even the steady state configuration for B=-1 T is oblate, which is different from the base case."

            "text": "The mutual interaction of the electric and magnetic fields generate some unique patterns of streamlines within the droplet and the surrounding fluid. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the temporal evolution of streamlined patterns for system A and B with different B at \u03b1=0.8 (refer Figure SI.VIII to Figure SI.XV of supporting information for other \u03b1) and Eo=10V/mm.\nSince the applied electric field is of irrotational type, the induced magnetic field is negligible. The charge relaxation time is not affected much by the externally applied magnetic field. All the charges accumulate in the interface (\u223c\u2264 10\u22121sec) after applying the electric field. So the variation of electric potential, electric field, electrical stress and J\u03c4ErrK across the interface are not affected much by the externally applied magnetic field. As the charge accumulation on the interface takes place, the coupled effect of the magnetic field and the electric field becomes significant. The combined effect of J\u03c4Er\u03b8K and J\u03c4Mr\u03b8 K will influence the flow field within the droplet and the surrounding medium. In comparison to B=0 T case, the streamline density will increase on application of both electric and magnetic fields. This streamlined density\n16\ndepends on Eo, B, properties of the system, and \u03b1. The magnitude of the J\u03c4Er\u03b8K is unaffected by the presence of a magnetic field. Without a magnetic field, interfacial J\u03c4Er\u03b8K is balanced by J\u03c4Hr\u03b8K . But in the presence of an external magnetic field, J\u03c4Er\u03b8K is balanced by both J\u03c4Hr\u03b8K and J\u03c4Mr\u03b8 K, dictated by the interfacial conditions (b5). As J\u03c4Er\u03b8K is invariant of B, the variation in J\u03c4Hr\u03b8K is in synchrony with the variation in J\u03c4Mr\u03b8 K (refer interfacial condition b5). In a previous study by Mandal et al. [34], they reported the presence of crowded and closed streamlines of highly confined droplets in presence of electric field only i.e. B=0T. In presence of magnetic field, the J\u03c4Hr\u03b8K increases more across the interface in comparison to B=0T case. Consequently, denser streamlines are observed either in the droplet or within the confined space. For R<S system and +B direction, the streamlines will be denser in the surrounding medium (Figure 9). For \u2013B direction, the streamlines will be denser in the confined drop and vice-versa for R>S systems for +B and\n17\n\u2013B directions (Figure 10). Along each row the temporal evolution of streamlines are highlighted (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Initially, the streamlines will appear as closed loops present throughout both the domains of the drop and the surrounding fluid (1st column of Figure 9 and Figure 10). As time progresses, more charges accumulate on the interface and will enhance the effect of electrical and magnetic fields. As a result the \u03c4Hr\u03b8 is also enhanced. Due to the increase in the magnitude of \u03c4Hr\u03b8 with time, the earlier observed closed looped streamlines will be no longer possible. From time \u223c 1 sec onwards, due to the stress mis-\nmatch across the interface, the earlier observed closed loop streamlines (1st column Figure 9, Figure 10) will evolve into separate streamline contours in the two flow domains. With increase in time, further increment in the jump of \u03c4Hr\u03b8 will increase the density of the contours either in droplets or in the surrounding medium.\nNow, consider the streamline variation in R<S system with \u03b1=0.8 and B = +1.0 T (last row of Figure 9). For this condition, \u03c4Mr\u03b8 in the droplet is more than \u03c4Mr\u03b8 in the surrounding medium. As the \u03c4Hr\u03b8 variation is opposite to the variation in \u03c4Mr\u03b8 due to interfacial condition b5, the \u03c4Hr\u03b8 in drop is lesser than that of the surrounding medium. Therefore, on application of magnetic field, \u03c4Hr\u03b8 in confined space increases further in comparison to B=0T case. Hence, the surrounding medium has presence of denser streamlines than the droplet. Similar trends are observed in +0.3 T and 0.6 T cases (5th - 6th row of Figure 9). For the same \u03b1=0.8 and R<S system, the variation in \u03c4Mr\u03b8 and \u03c4Hr\u03b8 across the interface will be in opposite direction in case of \u2013B direction. As a result, denser streamlines are observed within the droplet (1st - 3rd row of Figure 9). For both +B and \u2013B directions of magnetic field, with increase in B, magnitude of J\u03c4Mr\u03b8 K increases. So for both +B and \u2013B directions, the density of streamlines increases in the surrounding medium (5th - 7th row of Figure 9) and the confined drop (1st - 3rd row of Figure 9) respectively.\nThe streamline variation in the R>S system in the presence of the magnetic field strength with \u03b1=0.8 is shown in Figure 10. Here, the droplet is more conducting than the surrounding fluid. Since the effect of the magnetic field will be more dominant in the R>S system than the R<S system, denser streamlines are observed within the droplet and the surrounding medium. The variation in \u03c4Mr\u03b8 and \u03c4Hr\u03b8 across the interface for the R>S system will be in the opposite direction compared to the R<S system. As a result, for the +B direction, the droplet has a presence of denser streamlines than the surrounding medium (4th - 6th row of Figure 10). For the \u2013B direction, denser streamlines are observed in the surrounding medium (1st - 3rd row of Figure 10).\nFigure 11 highlights the role of \u03b1 on the temporal evolutions of streamlined patterns (for R>S system) at B=0T. The temporal evolution of the streamlines are in good agreement with the previous study by Mandal et al. [34]. For unconfined domain, the streamline contours are confined to individual domains (1st row of Figure 11) unlike the confined domains (Figure 9 and Figure 10). With the increase in \u03b1, the contours are more stretched in the surrounding medium along the curvature of the droplet. This implies the existence of strong velocity gradients along the curvature (tangential). The contours within the droplet also enhance with the increase in \u03b1 due to the increase of velocity gradient along the radial direction.\nFigure 12 and Figure 13 show the temporal evolutions of streamlined patterns (for R>S system) at different \u03b1 for B = +1.0 and -1.0T, respectively. In the presence\n18\nof the magnetic field, the streamline contours are denser than the B=0T case. The direction of the magnetic field strength dictates the relative density of streamline contours within the droplet and in the surrounding medium, i.e. denser streamlines within the droplet for the +B direction (Figure 12 for B = +1.0T) and in the surrounding fluid for the \u2013B direction (Figure 13 for B = -1.0T). The streamline contours for the intermediate B, i.e. B = \u00b10.3T and B = \u00b10.6T for systems A and B, are shown from Figure SI.XVI to Figure SI.XXIII of supporting section. In these intermediate magnetic field strengths, the streamline contours are lesser denser than B = \u00b11.0T and denser than B=0.0T for both systems."

            "text": "The present analytical study focuses on the deformation dynamics and the flow field analysis of a droplet suspended in a confined fluid in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields. Our analysis proposed an expression for the droplet deformation parameter (D) varies exponentially with time for both instantaneous (System A) and finite charge relaxation time (System B). The droplet deformation parameter (D) depends on the Eo, the strength and the direction of the applied B, \u03b1 and properties of droplet and surrounding fluid. We also developed a magnetic discriminating function (\u03d5M ) which predicts the steady-state shape of the droplet when both electric and magnetic fields are present. \u03d5M<0 implies the evolution of the droplet from spherical shape to oblate spheroid while >0 corresponds to prolate spheroid and no deformation for \u03d5M=0. After the initial validation of confined drop deformation in presence of electric field only (B=0T) with previous studies [13, 34], we explored the contribution of J\u03c3HrrK, J\u03c4ErrK and J\u03c4Mrr K in transient deformation and flow field analysis for B \u0338= 0T cases.\nWe have shown that the deformation dynamics is governed by the J\u03c4TrrK. With an increase in \u03b1, the magnitude of J\u03c4ErrK decreases and increases for the R<S and R>S system, respectively. The J\u03c4Mrr K will increase with the increase in B. The J\u03c3HrrK is governed by both electric and magnetic field. When J\u03c3ErrK and J\u03c3Mrr K tend to deform the droplet in the same direction, the droplet deformation will increase and vice-versa. In specific cases, when both J\u03c3HrrK and J\u03c4ErrK tend to deform the droplet in the opposite direction, shape reversal will be observed when J\u03c3HrrK dominates over J\u03c4ErrK.\nThe flow field analysis of the present work uncovers the effect of the magnetic field on J\u03c4Hr\u03b8K. The streamlined density within the droplet and in the surrounding fluid enhances with the increase in magnetic field intensity.\nFor the R<S system, streamline density is more within the droplet in the \u2013B direction and the surrounding fluid in the +B direction and vice-versa for the R>S system. Our analysis also reveals that in the presence of the magnetic field, for the R>1 system, the droplet deformation and flow field intensity is more than in the R<1 system. As the droplet is more conducting than the surrounding fluid for the R>1 system, higher J\u03c3Mrr K will occur due to electric and magnetic fields. The present analysis shows that even at lower electric field intensity, we can augment the deformation dynamics by incorporating magnetic field. The manipulation of droplet deformation and flow field in a specific direction by modulating the magnetic field with an electric field may have potential use in various microfluidic applications.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT:\nAll data have been included in the main paper and supporting information document.\nDECLARATION OF INTERESTS:\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest with respect to this research.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\nThe authors thank IIT Ropar and IIT Kharagpur for supporting the work through internal funds.\nAppendix\nEquation 23 contains the functions f1 \u2212 f5 of the following form:\nf1 = 2\u22125\u03b13 +3\u03b15, f2 = 2\u22127\u03b15 +5\u03b17, f3 = 5\u22127\u03b12 +2\u03b17, f4 = 3\u22125\u03b12 +2\u03b15,\nf5 = \u22124+25\u03b13 \u221242\u03b15 \u22124\u03b110 +25\u03b17\n(A.1)\nEquation 46 contains the functions P1 \u2212 P3& Equation 47 contains the functions P4 \u2212 P6 of the following form:\n19\nP1 = 9\u03932R( S\u2212R)\n2(R+2)2\nP2 = \u2212P1 [ 1+ \u0393S(S\u2212R) ( 1\u2212\u03b13 ) (S+2) ]\nP3 = P1\n[ \u0393S(S\u2212R) ( 1\u2212\u03b13 ) (S+2) ]\nP4 = 9\u03932R\n( R2 \u22122 S+1 ) 2(R+2)2\nP5 = 9\u03932R\u0393S(S\u2212R)\n2(R+2)2( S+2)\n[ 2R ( 2+\u03b13 ) +2 ( \u03b13 \u22121 ) +4 S ( 1\u2212\u03b13 )2] P6 =\n9\u03932R\u03932S( S\u2212R)2 2(R+2)2( S+2)2\n[( 2+\u03b13 )2 + (\u03b13 \u22121)2 \u22122 S(1\u2212\u03b13)2]\n(A.2)\nEquation 53 contains the functions q1 \u2212q3 of the following form:\nq1 = 1\nf18\n( P4 \u2212\nP1f17 f11 \u2212 3\u0393RB2 (R \u22121) (R+2) f17 f11 ) q2 =\n1 f18\n( P10 \u2212\nP8f17 f11\n) ,q3 =\n1 f18\n( P6 \u2212\nP3f17 f11 ) (A.3) Equation 54 contains the functions Q1 \u2212Q3 of the following form:\nQ1 = q2\u03c43 q1\u03c42 , Q2 = q3\u03c44 q1\u03c42 , Q3 = q1\u03c42 \u2212q2\u03c43 \u2212q3\u03c44 q1\u03c42 (A.4)\nEquation 56 contains the functions P8 of the following form:\nP7 = 3 2\u0393R\u0393SB\n( 1\u2212\u03b13 )[ (R \u22121)(S\u2212R) (R+2)(S+2) ] , P8 = P2 \u2212P7 (A.5)\nq2 contains the functions P10 of the following form:\nP9 = 3B\u03932R\u0393S(S\u2212R)\n(S+2) , P10 = P5 +P9 (A.6)\nExpression of the functions f6 \u2212 f18 is of the following form:\nf6 = 16\u03b1 5\u221210\u03b13+4 f1 , f7 = 8f1\u22123f2+3\u03b13f3\u22128\u03b15f4 f1 , f8 = 16\u03b15\u221210\u03b13\u22126 f1 , f9 = 5f52f1 , f10 = f6 \u2212\u03bbf8, f11 = f7 \u2212\u03bbf9, f12 = 6\u03b1\n5+20\u03b13+24 f1 , f13 = 24f1\u221218f2\u22126\u03b13f3\u22123\u03b15f4 f1 , f14 = \u22126\u03b15\u221220\u03b13+26 f1 ,\nf15 = \u22129f52f1 , f16 = f12 +\u03bbf14, f17 = f13 +\u03bbf15,\n(A.7)\n[1] W.
