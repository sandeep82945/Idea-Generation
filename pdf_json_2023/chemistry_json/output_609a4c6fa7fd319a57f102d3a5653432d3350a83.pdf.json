    "abstractText": "Asthma is a condition in which a person\u2019s airways become inflamed, narrowed, and produce greater amounts of mucus than normal. It can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, or wheezing. In some cases, symptoms may be exacerbated. Thus, the current study was designed to determine the mechanism of action of 6-aminoflavone (6-NH2F) in ex vivo experiments, as well as to determine its toxicity in acute and sub-chronic murine models. Tissues were pre-incubated with 6-NH2F, and concentration\u2013response curves to carbachol-induced contraction were constructed. Therefore, tracheal rings pre-treated with glibenclamide, 2-aminopyridine, or isoproterenol were contracted with carbachol (1 \u03bcM), then 6-NH2F relaxation curves were obtained. In other sets of experiments, to explore the calcium channel role in the 6-NH2F relaxant action, tissues were contracted with KCl (80 mM), and 6-NH2F was cumulatively added to induce relaxation. On the other hand, tissues were pre-incubated with the test sample, and after that, CaCl2 concentration\u2013response curves were developed. In this context, 6-NH2F induced significant relaxation in ex vivo assays, and the effect showed a non-competitive antagonism pattern. In addition, 6-NH2F significantly relaxed the contraction induced by KCl and CaCl2, suggesting a potential calcium channel blockade, which was corroborated by in silico molecular docking that was used to approximate the mode of interaction with the L-type Ca2+ channel, where 6-NH2F showed lower affinity energy when compared with nifedipine. Finally, toxicological studies revealed that 6-NH2F possesses pharmacological safety, since it did not produce any toxic effect in both acute and sub-acute murine models. In conclusion, 6-aminoflavone exerted significant relaxation through calcium channel blockade, and the compound seems to be safe.",

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) mentioned that this disease causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms are associated with variable expiratory airflows, such as difficult gas exchange in the capillaries of the lungs due to bronchoconstriction, airway wall thickening, and the\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1870. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11071870 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1870 2 of 12\nproduction of extra mucus [3]. Thus, treatment of these diseases must be based on bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents, although not all drugs are efficient, or they could cause adverse effects. In this context, the discovery and development of new drugs with a multitarget mode of action and with fewer adverse effects to treat asthma are required. Recent research based on natural products has focused on flavonoids and flavonoidlike molecules due to their therapeutic benefits. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds with a characteristic chemical structure, and they are classified into flavones, flavanones, flavonols, anthocyanidins, flavanols, aurones, furan chromones, isoflavanones, biflavones, chalcones, and dihydrochalcones [4,5]. Due to the wide range of biological activities of flavones, a great interest has been generated for the discovery of active agents for the treatment of respiratory diseases, since flavones are one of the subclasses of flavonoids with diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-tuberculosis, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic, among others [5]. Several flavones have relaxant effects on airway smooth muscle (ASM) in different ex vivo murine models [6\u20138]. In addition, flavones were reported with significant anti-inflammatory effects by the inhibition of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u00df, nitrite ion free-radical generation inhibition, and lipid peroxidation inhibition [9]. Other interventions with flavonoids improved the health of some diseases with inflammatory processes [10]. Thus, those studies described all relaxant and anti-inflammatory effects of flavonoids, especially flavones, and suggest that these natural compounds could be developed as potential efficient antiasthmatic drugs, due to their dual mode of action. The current investigation aimed to determine the tracheal relaxation mode of action of 6-NH2F in ex vivo and in silico studies, and to determine its safety in pharmacological uses, through a toxicological approach in mice models based on OECD guidelines."

Tracheal Rings Preparation\nRat tracheal rings were dissected, cleaned, and mounted in a 10 mL organ bath containing Krebs\u2013Henseleit solution and maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u25e6C with an isometric tension of 2 g, as described in [11]. In all experiments, contraction responses were measured and recorded using Grass-FT03 force transducers Astromed\u00ae (West Warwick, RI, USA), connected to an MP100 analyzer BIOPAC\u00ae Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The tissues were equilibrated for at least 1 h prior to the addition of the test samples, and during this time, the buffer solution was renewed every 20 min before starting the assays (Appendix A, Scheme A1).\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1870 3 of 12\n2.3.2. Functional Relaxant Effect\nAfter a 30 min washout period, the tracheal rings were contracted with carbachol (CCh) (1 \u00b5M) twice at 30 min intervals and washed with Krebs\u2013Henseleit solution. To determine the relaxant effect, after stabilization, the tissues were contracted again with submaximal contraction of CCh (1 \u00b5M), and once the plateau was attained, concentration\u2013 response curves of 6-NH2F, positive control (theophylline), and vehicle (DMSO 1%) were obtained by adding cumulative concentrations of the test samples to the bath [11,12].\n2.3.3. Functional Mechanism of Action Determination\nTo explain the relaxant effect of 6-NH2F, different possible mechanisms of action strategies on tracheal rings were evaluated, which are described in Table 1 [11,12]."

O. cuniculus has a 92.63% sequence homology vs. its corresponding human homologue and 92.1% vs. Rattus norvegicus (Wistar rats), as reported in [15]. Based on the high sequence homology with O. cuniculus, we assume that all conclusions here stated might be applied to human or to Wistar rats where experiments were conducted. 6JP5 has a nifedipine binding site, so it has been used as reference/validation for this study. The 6-NH2F was drawn, converted to three-dimensional structure, and its best conformer generated with Marvin Sketch 21.10. Autodock Vina (USA) [16] was used for molecular docking due to its great capability to reproduce the binding modes of small molecules to a protein with high accuracy. All initial structures and configuration files were generated with Chimera UCSF [17] using the Autodock Vina plugin as implemented. All structures were\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1870 4 of 12\nstructurally aligned to use the same box and size for all four structures.

The box dimensions used in this study were enough to consider other possible binding sites distinct from nifedipine. A hundred independent molecular docking assays were performed on each calcium channel structure with both ligands. The results were clustered using a 2\u00c5 RMSD, and molecular interactions of the most popular cluster were analyzed on Maestro from Schrodinger [18]. All images were made using VMD or Maestro from Schrodinger (USA) [19]."

After administration, the signs of toxicity and mortality were observed, such as changes in skin and fur, eyes, and mucous membranes, as well as the respiratory, circulatory, autonomic, and central nervous systems and somatomotor function, behavioral patterns, tremors, convulsions, drooling, diarrhea, lethargy, sleep, and coma; after that period, every 2 h until 24 h and over 14 days, animals were observed.\n2.5.2. Sub-Acute Oral Toxicity Test\nThe animals were weighed and divided into three groups (sham, vehicle, and 6-NH2F). The group treated with 6-NH2F had the compound orally administered for 28 days at 100 mg/kg per day; the sham group received physiological saline solution daily for 28 days; and the vehicle group were given a solution of tween 80 3% and DMSO 2%, administered orally, according to the guide of a repeated-dose 28-day oral toxicity study in rodents [14]. Body weight changes were supervised weekly for 28 days. The animals were monitored for manifestation of toxicity and mortality [21]. At the end of the test period, the animals of each group were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital solution injection by intraperitoneal route. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture to test the transaminases activity (ALT and AST). The vital organs were recovered for histology studies (kidney, liver, heart, and lungs) using a formalin solution. Finally, a complete analysis of each animal with treatment was compared with the sham and vehicle animals and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological slides were examined with a conventional light microscope (Zeiss 20\u00d7)."

Thus, 6-OHF was used to determine its mechanism of action, which acts as a calcium channel blocker and an anti-asthmatic compound [11]. Based on those previous studies, in the current manuscript, we decided to explore the mechanism of action of 6-aminoflavone, which was the second-most potent compound of the series explored. Thus, 6-NH2F showed significant relaxation on isolated rat tracheal rings, demonstrating a concentration-dependent pattern with a relaxant effect of 91.1 \u00b1 2.1%, compared with theophylline, a powerful relaxant agent of the smooth muscle fiber, bronchi, and peripheral vessels, which is used as\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1870 5 of 12\na bronchodilator (Figure 1).

For this, the flavon id and nifedipine were docked on four different structures of L-type calcium channel from O. cuniculus. Multiple docking assays (100 repetitions each) were carried out to improve molecular sampling on those structures. Table 2 summarizes\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1870 8 of 12\nthe results obtained in this work. As noted, 6-aminoflavone showed lower-affinity energy when compared with nifedipine on all structures.

Two residues of this binding site were unique for 6-NH2F (L563 and L566); the other ones were residues also found for verapamil. As noticed, the 6JPA binding site was composed primarily of hydrophobic residues. There exist hydrophilic residues (T612 and N649) on this binding site, located near the amino group of the ligand and interacting with it by hydrogen bonds (T612).\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12 All of these results indicate that the mechanism of action of 6-NH2F is based mainly on calcium channel blockade; thus, to complement the finding in functional studies, an in silico approach was conducted to predict the possible interactions of 6-NH2F within Ca2+\nchannels. For this, the flavonoid and nifedipine were docked on four different structures\nof L-type calcium channel from O. cuniculus. Multiple docking assays (100 repetitions\neach) were carried out to improve molecular sampling on those structures. Table 2 sum-\nmarizes the results obtained in this work. As noted, 6-aminoflavone showed lower-affinity\nenergy when compared with nifedipine on all structures. On the other hand, nifedipine\nmolecular docking reproduced the crystallographic conformation only in 54% of the as-\nsays. This can be explained due to the presence of a lipid molecule on the crystallographic\nstructure that was not used in this experiment, as rep rted in [27].\nTable 2.

As noticed in Figure 7a, F1060 was interacting with 6-NH2F through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions on the three structures. Y1365 was found interacting with 6-NH2F by hydrogen bond on 6JP8, exclusively. There exist two hydrophilic residues on this binding site, and one of them was located near the amino group of 6-NH2F.

Thus, all these results can offer evidence to develop a specific airway relaxant agent for the potential treatment of asthma; however, it is necessary to authenticate these pharmacological, functional, and in silico findings by using an in vivo model of asthma. In the meantime, it is necessary to evaluate the pharmacological safety uses, and acute and sub-chronic toxicity assays can bring us closer to the final goal, which is to develop an effective and safe anti-asthmatic agent. Therefore, in the acute study, 6-NH2F did not exhibit any apparent physical changes or death at different doses (5, 50, 300, and 2000 mg/kg), after 5 and 24 h observation, and for the next 14 days. The medium lethal dose (LD50) of 6-NH2F is over 2000 mg/kg, and according to the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), it is classified in category 4. Moreover, 6-NH2F was tested with a unique dose of 100 mg/kg for 28 days compared with vehicle and sham groups, and during that period, each group was monitored for changes in weight. In Figure 8, the percentage of body weight variation of all three groups is shown; as observed, there were no changes with a normal increase as time went by, with respect to food and water consumption. The results confirmed that 6-NH2F is not a hazardous product.

Additionally, a 6-NH2F molecular docking study revealed that it binds to the L-type calcium channel with better affinity energy than nifedipine, which is a drug with a potent L-type calcium channel-blocking effect. Thus, with all these results 6-NH2F can be proposed as a potential agent for the treatment of asthma and related respiratory diseases.\nAuthor Contributions: A.F.-F.: Methodology, validation, formal analysis, investigation, data curation, writing\u2014original draft, writing\u2014review and editing, and funding acquisition.
