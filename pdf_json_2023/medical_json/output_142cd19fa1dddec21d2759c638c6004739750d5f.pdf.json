The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of intraoperatively administered hyoscine-N-butylbromide on stomach resection volume, weight loss and complications seen in patients undergoing LSG. Material and Methods: Patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy due to morbid obesity were included in the study. Intraoperative hyoscine-N-butylbromide was administered to 52 patients (Group 1), not applied to the other 52 patients (Group 2). Age, sex, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) data of the patients were obtained retrospectively. The weight, BMI, percentage of total weight loss (TWL%) and percentage of excess weight loss (EWL%) of the patients were evaluated at postoperative third, sixth and 12 months. Results: Resected gastric volume (p= 0.111), length of stapler line (p= 0.944), operation time (p= 0.383), hospitalization time (p= 0.494) and postoperative complications (p> 0.05) did not differ between Groups 1 and 2. However, frequency of intraoperative tachycardia (p< 0.001) and hypotension (p= 0.006) in Group 1 was significantly higher than in Group 2. TWL% and EWL% values were similar between the two groups at all-time points. Stapler line leakage was not observed in any patient during the postoperative period. Conclusion: Intraoperative hyoscine-N-butylbromide use is not effective on weight loss postoperatively in patients undergoing LSG. Although hypotension and tachycardia occured in some of patients, none of the patients had complaints in the early or long-term postoperative period. The use of hyoscine-N-butylbromide during LSG is safe but does not have any effect on weight loss.",

There are different types of procedures, but the most common surgical procedure is laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (1). Although sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive surgery, it has been shown to be effective not only in the treatment of obesity but also in the treatment of obesity-related comorbid diseases (2). However, the LSG technique is not exactly standardized, and there are still many controversial technical issues. One of these issues is the usage of intraoperative hyoscine-N-butylbromide (3,4).\nAs an antispasmodic drug, hyoscine-N-butylbromide has been shown to reduce contraction in the gastrointestinal tract during endoscopic procedures that facilitates these procedures (5). With the use of hyoscine-N-butylbromide, it can be thought that the stomach can be loosened and manipulated better during surgery, and thus more part of stomach can be resected. In a study conducted in T\u00fcrkiye, it has been observed that 17% of surgeons routinely preferred to use hyoscine-N-butylbromide in all of cases during LSG, while 31% of surgeons preferred to use it in some of the cases (6). There is limited information about the usage of hyoscine-N-butylbromide during bariatric surgery. Although there are studies in the literature evaluating postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting with the use of hyoscine-N-butylbromide in LSG, there is no study evaluating the volume of resected stomach and weight loss with the use of hyoscine-N-butylbromide during LSG (7,8). The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of intraoperatively administered hyoscine-N-butylbromide on stomach resection volume, weight loss and complications seen in patients undergoing LSG.\nTurk J Surg 2023; 39 (2): 89-94"

Patients who underwent another operation in the same session, patients who underwent re-sleeve gastrectomy, patients who were sensitive to hyoscine-N-butylbromide, and those with cardiac disease, glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy for whom the use of hyoscine-N-butylbromide was not appropriate were not included in the study. Ethics committee approval was obtained for the study.\nConsidering the \u201cindependent samples t-test\u201d before the study, it was calculated that the bidirectional p value was 0.05, the effect width was d= 0.72, 1-\u03b2= 0.95, and the number of patients in the groups was equal, at least 52 patients in both groups, making a total of 104 patients. Hyoscine-N-butylbromide was administered intravenously to one of the groups (Group 1) and no additional medication was applied to the other group (Group 2).\nBody mass index (BMI) of all patients were recorded before the operation. The volume of the resected stomach during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, stapler line length, greater curvature length, duration of surgery, presence of intraoperative tachycardia and hypotension, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded. Patients\u2019 weight, BMI, percentage of total weight loss (TWL%), and percentage of excess weight loss (EWL%) were evaluated at the third, sixth, and 12th months. In order to calculate the resected stomach volume, a pressure gauge was placed inside the resected stomach and the specimen was inflated with saline to a pressure of 20 mmHg. The volume of saline filled into the resected stomach up to this pressure was considered as the volume of the resected stomach."

The operation was started at the fowler position under general anesthesia. The surgeon takes position between the legs of the patient. A 10 mm trocar is placed at the upper abdomen 1-2 cm above the umbilicus with the Hasson technique. Pneumoperitoneum is performed with 12 mmHg CO\n2 insufflation. A 10\nmm trocar is introduced at the right upper quadrant and a 12-mm trocar is inserted at the left upper quadrant. A 5 mm trocar is introduced at the left subcostal anterior axillary line. A 5 mm trocar is inserted at the sub-xiphoid area for the liver retraction. A 30\u00b0 angled scope was used through the supraumbilical port.\nFirst of all, intraabdominal exploration was performed. The stomach was decompressed via a nasogastric tube. Then, the gastroepiploic arch was ligated with a vessel sealing device (Ligasure\u2122, USA). Omental dissection was performed close to the stomach until the angle of his was impaired by ligating the short gastric arteries superiorly and 2-4 cm proximal to the pylorus. The stomach was then lifted towards the anterior abdominal wall. Adhesions in the greater omentum and the posterior surface of the stomach and fundus were released with a vessel sealing device, paying attention to the left gastric artery and its branches, splenic vessels and the proximal part of the pancreas. The dissection was completed after separation of the gastrophrenic ligament and the left crus was completely visualized. Posterior crural approximation was performed with 3/0 silk suture in patients with hiatal hernia. Then, 36 french bougie was advanced into the stomach by the anesthesiologist. At this stage, in patients intended to use hyoscine-Nbutylbromide, 20 mg of hyoscine-N-butylbromide was rapidly administered intravenously to the patient. Afterwards, it was ensured that the bougie was placed along the lesser curvature, and the stomach was transected starting from 2-4 cm proximal to the pylorus. Then, 50-100 mL of methylene blue was given through the bougie and the stapler line, which was applied with LSG and evaluated for leakage. Then, a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed along the stapler line and the operation was terminated."

It has been shown that the duration of colonic intubation time is shortened in patients premedicated with hyoscine-N-butylbromide for colonoscopy (10). However, in our study, it was observed that the use of hyoscine-Nbutylbromide did not affect the duration of surgery. Therefore, contrary to the benefit seen in colonoscopy procedures, it is not possible to say that LSG is easier or faster in patients treated with hyoscine-N-butylbromide.\nOne can think that loosening the stomach will lead to wider stomach resection so patient will lose more weight. In order to analyze this, we compared the resected stomach volumes between the groups in our study. No statistical difference was detected between the groups for resected stomach volume. In order to detect efficacy of usage of hyoscine-N-butylbromide during LSG on resected stomach volume, it is better to measure ratio of resected stomach to whole stomach rather than measuring volume of resected stomach. However, it is technically difficult to measure the whole stomach volume before operation so we just measured the volume of the resected stomach that gives us information about the differences between the groups.\nIn our study, the usage of hyoscine-N-butylbromide had no effect on postoperative nausea and vomiting ratios. There is a study in the literature analyzing the effect of hyoscine-Nbutylbromide usage for postoperative nausea and vomiting ratios during LSG. In that study, it has been detected that postoperative nausea and vomiting ratios did not change (7).\nIn our study, the usage of hyoscine-N-butylbromide did not have an effect on either shortening duration of the operation or increasing weight loss of the patient. In addition, no adverse effects were observed due to the use of hyoscine-Nbutylbromide. Although hypotension and tachycardia occurred in some of patients, none of the patients had complaints in the early or long-term postoperative period. As a result, the usage of hyoscine-N-butylbromide during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is safe."
