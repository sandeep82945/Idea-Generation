The field of mental health services research has limited access to assessments of job interview skills with rigorously evaluated psychometric properties.\nObjective: We sought to evaluate the initial psychometric properties of a measure assessing job interview skills via role-play performance.\nMethods: As part of a randomized controlled trial, 90 adults with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses completed a job interview role-play assessment with eight items (and scored using anchors) called the mock interview rating scale (MIRS). A classical test theory analysis was conducted including confirmatory factor analyses, Rasch model analysis and calibration, and differential item functioning; along with inter-rater, internal consistency, and test-retest reliabilities. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate construct, convergent, divergent, criterion, and predictive validity by correlating the MIRS with demographic, clinical, cognitive, work history measures, and employment outcomes.\nResults: Our analyses resulted in the removal of a single item (sounding honest) and yielded a unidimensional total score measurement with support for its interrater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. There was initial support for the construct, convergent, criterion, and predictive validities of the MIRS, as it correlated with measures of social competence, neurocognition, valuing job interview training, and employment outcomes. Meanwhile, the lack of correlations with race, physical health, and substance abuse lent support for divergent validity.\nConclusion: This study presents initial evidence that the seven-item version of the MIRS has acceptable psychometric properties supporting its use to assess job interview skills reliably and validly among adults with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses.\nClinical Trial Registration: NCT03049813."

            "text": "Competitive employment contributes to greater quality of life, physical and mental health, social capital, and reduced poverty for adults with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses [e.g., bipolar disorder, major depression (1\u20133)]. However, only 10\u201320% of this marginalized and underserved population obtains competitive employment (4). The employment rate increases to as much as 55% among adults with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses engaged in evidence-based supported employment such, as the individual placement and support program (5). However, at least 45% of these individuals still face ongoing challenges to securing employment.\nThe job interview has been identified as a notable barrier to successfully landing a job in the general population (6, 7) and among individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses (8). Notably, individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses face challenges with their social skills that likely interfere with their ability to effectively navigate conversations such as those that take place during a job interview (9\u201312). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in job interviews shifting more frequently to remote meeting platforms where one\u2019s responses to interview questions on a computer screen may be\u00a0even more challenging for individuals who already have difficulty making real-time social judgments on how to respond to questions (13, 14). Relatedly, a recent study noted that approximately 90% of employed young adults with mental health challenges and other disabilities who engaged in employment services interviewed to obtain their job (15). Moreover, a recent study suggests that approximately 70% of persons with schizophrenia (or other serious mental disorders) who are engaged in supported employment services discussed their interview skills with their employment specialist, and approximately 50% of these individuals completed job interview role-plays with their employment specialist (16). Thus, job interview preparation has emerged as common practice in supported employment programs. The importance of preparing for the job interview is also evident in one study of peer support specialists who believed that their lived experience struggling with job interviews could help them contextualize the value of job interview training for their own clients with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses (17).\nGiven that job interview skills are important to helping people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses get competitive employment (18), there is a need to evaluate more systematic approaches to job skills training in supported employment programs. Relatedly, in order to evaluate the effects of such skills training, there is a need for reliable and valid methods for assessing job interviewing performance. Role play assessments have been used for decades to measure social skills among adults with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses and have been shown to be\u00a0reliable, valid, and sensitive to change following social skills training (19\u201321). Building on this history, role play assessments of more specific social skills such\nas job interviewing have emerged in the field. For example, several randomized controlled trials evaluating an internet-delivered job interview training programs recently emerged in lab settings and within a community mental health services agency [e.g., (16, 22, 23)]. Although all of these studies evaluated job interview skills using one job interview role-play assessment [called the mock interview rating scale (MIRS)], which displayed strong inter-rater reliability and sensitivity to change [e.g., (16, 22, 23)], the psychometric properties of this assessment have yet to be\u00a0evaluated.\nThus, the current study sought to assess the psychometric properties of the MIRS assessment among individuals with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses who participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate virtual reality job interview training (VR-JIT); a job interview simulator commercially licensed by SIMmersion LLC1 that provides automated scoring and feedback following trainees\u2019 completion of job interview role-plays with a virtual hiring manger (16). To evaluate the structure of items measured in the MIRS assessment, we\u00a0used published measurement development standards that recommend implementing confirmatory factor analyses along with Rasch model analytics and calibration (24). Thus, we\u00a0evaluated the reliability of the MIRS via inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability.\nFurther, we\u00a0 sought to evaluate the construct, convergent, divergent, criterion, and predictive validity of the MIRS using correlational analyses. Given that job interview skills fall under the general construct of pragmatic social ability or competence, the relationship between job interview skills and pragmatic social competence reflects a measure of construct validity. Based on job interview and job acquisition frameworks (25\u201329) and social competence research in schizophrenia (30, 31), the relationship between job interview skills and education, cognitive ability, psychopathology, and perceived utility of job interview training could reasonably serve as measures of convergent validity.\nFor divergent validity, we\u00a0hypothesized that age, race, and sex would have no association with interview skills as prior studies did not find age-, race-, or sex-specific differences in work-based social skills (25, 32). Based on the job interview and job acquisition frameworks (25\u201329), the relationship between job interview skills and employment training or history (e.g., prior vocational training, prior full-time employment, prior part-time employment, and length of absence from the work force) could serve as measures of criterion validity. Meanwhile, the relationship between interview skills (from the IPS-asusual group at post-test) and acquired competitive employment and number of job offers received by 9-month follow-up (postrandomization) could serve as measures of predictive validity given that prior studies found that post-test MIRS scores predicted receiving offers (18).\n1 www.simmersion.com\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Participants completed two interview role-plays during a baseline visit. First, participants reviewed brief postings for eight different part-time jobs (i.e., data entry technician at a university, mail clerk or paralegal at a law firm, medical records clerk at a hospital, inventory manager or stock clerk at a supermarket, sales associate at a home goods store, or reference librarian at a county public library; see Appendix A). Second, participants were given an instruction card that corresponded to each of their selected job scenarios. The instructions read: \u201c(fill in company name and details).\u201d They are interviewing for part-time workers, 25\u201330 h per week. Starting pay is $15 per hour. You\u00a0are interviewing for part time work. Third, the participants reviewed their instruction card for 5 min and then engaged in the first role-play. Lastly, participants had up to 5 min to review the scenario for the second role-play, and then completed the second role-play.\nThe MIRS job interview role-play actors were instructed to play the hiring manager characters as friendly and to ask all 13 of the required job interview questions along with at least three additional questions selected at random from a list of 90 optional questions (see\nAppendix B). Notably, the first role-play scenarios for two participants were not completed to fidelity as the role-play actors played the role in a stern manner and forgot to ask more than 1/3 of the interview questions. Remaining actor performances met fidelity requirements. The job interview role-plays were video-recorded and coded by raters masked to study condition.\nIn the current study, we\u00a0used the first role-play for our primary analyses. Of note, we\u00a0used the second role-play video for our primary analyses for the two participants identified above where the first roleplay actor did not meet fidelity performance standards. The MIRS used an anchoring system to rate eight job interview skills on a fivepoint scale. The eight skills were developed iteratively. First, the VR-JIT development team reviewed the job interview construct literature (25\u201329) and drafted a series of targeted skills that were then discussed during three day-long expert panel meetings between the VR-JIT development team and two human resource specialists from local businesses (who routinely conduct job interviews), two employment specialists from a high-fidelity IPS supported employment program, and two clients receiving IPS services (36). The eight skills were finalized by the end of these meetings and then validated after review by 10 persons with serious mental illness engaged in IPS supported employment (36). Prior to the VR-JIT efficacy RCTs, the research team adapted the eight skills into nine items along with their associated anchors. Although the efficacy trials used nine items, one item focused on \u201cnegotiation skills\u201d was removed from the MIRS as the field has shifted away from \u201cnegotiating\u201d until after a job is offered. Thus, the MIRS resulted in the following eight items to assess job interview skills: comfort level during the interview, being a hard worker, sounding easy to work with, sharing things in a positive way, sounding interested in the position, sounding honest, sounding professional, and overall rapport [Appendix C (23)].\nParticipant demographics and baseline work history\nEach participant completed a brief survey about their background (e.g., age, sex, race, and education) and work history (e.g., prior fulltime employment, prior part-time employment, and length of time working); whether they received vocational services prior to IPS (0 = \u201cno\u201d or 1 = \u201cyes\u201d), and their total days in IPS at baseline (computed using IPS start date and date of baseline visit). Participants were characterized as recent IPS enrollees (i.e., fewer than 90 days in IPS) or IPS nonresponders [i.e., engaged in IPS for 90 days or more without obtaining competitive employment or obtaining work and getting fired (37)].\nIn addition, we\u00a0surveyed participants on their perceptions of the utility of job interview training using a seven-item subscale (1 = \u201cnot at all true\u201d to 7 = \u201cvery true\u201d; \u03b1 = 0.76) from the standardized intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI) (38), plus two stand-alone items. The IMI items focused on perceiving the value or usefulness of an activity (e.g., I\u00a0believe practicing job interview role-plays could be\u00a0of some value to me). Two standalone items used the same scaling as the IMI and asked: (1) I\u00a0understand the purpose of practicing job interview roleplays; and (2) practicing job interview role-plays requires me to focus and concentrate."

Based on the PROMIS framework (20) and previously implemented by our team (48) and others (49, 50), our comprehensive analytic process applied classical test theory analyses (CTT) including, assessments of item quality and scale dimensionality [confirmatory factor analyses (CFA)] complemented by item response theory (IRT) Rasch model analytics (24).

Our hypotheses were that rated interview skills would positively correlate with social competence (for construct validity) and with being female, social cognition, neurocognition, and perceiving job interview training as valuable (for convergent validity). Meanwhile, job interview skills would negatively correlate with psychopathology (for convergent validity). In our validity analyses, correlations should be\u00a0>0.3\u00a0in absolute value and statistically significant (72, 73). In regard to the validity coefficient analysis, we\u00a0took note of the factors known to affect the strength of construct and convergent validity coefficients, including scale and criterion scale reliability, skewness, range restriction, timing, and method variance. In particular, the method variance is of note in that self-report and external rater assessments will be\u00a0 less strongly correlated than homogenous method assessments (74).\nDivergent, criterion, and predictive validities For divergent, criterion, and predictive validities, we\u00a0performed Pearson and point-biserial correlations.

Given prior studies of the MIRS found that post-test MIRS scores predicted a greater likelihood of receiving job offers (18), a one-tailed test was used for these two correlations.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nNotably, we\u00a0chose the IPS services-as-usual group since the parent RCT found that the IPS + VR-JIT group significantly improved their MIRS rating between pre-and post-test, were more likely to get jobs, and trended toward getting their jobs sooner than the IPS services-asusual group (16).

Notably, training interview skills has been associated with improved access to competitive employment for adults with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses in several randomized controlled trials [e.g., (16, 22, 79)]. However, research evaluating job interview interventions has not yet reported whether their job interview role-play measures were psychometrically reliable and provided valid assessments of job interview skills. In addition, the field of vocational rehabilitation lacks a standard assessment of job interview skills, which could lend greater insight into the needs of clients with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses as they seek out individualized support to meet their needs. As a result, the current study evaluated the initial psychometric properties of the eight-item MIRS in this population.\nWe first determined that a single item evaluating \u201csounding honest\u201d should be\u00a0 eliminated given its below-threshold correlation with the remaining seven items, below threshold factor loadings in the CFA, and infit and outfit statistics that exceeded the acceptable threshold. Subsequently, the study revealed that the seven-item MIRS total score was a unidimensional construct via the use of CTT analyses, CFA and CBFA, Rasch modeling, and calibration analyses. Next, we\u00a0evaluated the MIRS for potential DIF and did not find the presence of potential item bias in how the MIRS functioned for individuals: (1) with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (compared to those with depression or bipolar disorder), (2) who were competitively employed in the past two years (compared to not competitively employed), (3) recent IPS enrollees (compared to IPS non-responders), (4) with college educations (compared to those with high school or less education), and (5) among males (compared to females). Thus, the MIRS should arguably function similarly among these different subgroups.\nThe evidence in this study suggests the MIRS is a reliable measure. The MIRS has strong internal consistency reliability via Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1 = 0.85) that exceeded the standard alpha value (i.e., \u03b1 = 0.70) recommended for measures used in research settings for group-level comparisons (80, 81). Although the MIRS\u2019 internal consistency approached the recommended alpha value for instruments used in applied settings (i.e., \u03b1 = 0.90), it did not meet this threshold (81). In addition, the MIRS had strong inter-rater reliability among four raters (ICC = 0.93) and the test-retest reliability results suggests the MIRS is stable over time. Notably, the MIRS has demonstrated sensitivity to change over time in five efficacy RCTs and two effectiveness RCTs to date (16, 22, 23, 82\u201385) where significant group-by-time interactions revealed the MIRS value increased over time among groups using\nTABLE\u00a04 MIRS T-score descriptive statistics (n = 90).\nMIRS T-score\nMean 50.0\nMedian 51.4\nStandard deviation 10.0\nSkewness \u22120.093\nStandard error of skewness 0.254\nKurtosis 0.323\nStandard error of kurtosis 0.503\nMin 21.8\nMax 77.5\nMIRS, mock interview rating scale.\nTABLE\u00a05 Validity correlations (n = 90).\nMIRS T-score\nr p\nConstruct validity\nSocial competence (n = 89) 0.46 <0.001\nConvergent validity\nSex 0.06 0.579\nSocial cognition 0.28 0.007\nProcessing speed 0.36 <0.001\nAttention/vigilance (n = 84) 0.29 0.008\nVerbal working memory (n = 89) 0.32 0.002\nVerbal learning 0.17 0.119\nVisual learning 0.18 0.084\nReasoning and problem solving 0.33 0.002\nPsychopathology \u22120.20 0.064\nJob interview training has value 0.32 0.002\nJob interview training requires focus (n = 67) 0.34 0.005\nUnderstands the purpose of practicing job interview\ntraining (n = 89) 0.33 0.002\nDivergent validity\nRace (% BIPOC) \u22120.05 0.670\nEducation (years) <\u22120.01 0.967\nPhysical health \u22120.11 0.291\nAlcohol misuse \u22120.08 0.472\nDrug misuse 0.07 0.507\nCriterion validity\nEmployment historya,b\nEver had full-time job (n = 87) 0.16 0.124\nLongest at a full-time job (months; n = 61) 0.30 0.019\nEver had part-time job 0.05 0.636\nReceived offer for part-time job in past 6 months (n = 28) 0.33 0.088\nPredictive validityc,d\nEmployment outcomes (IPS-as-usual)\nTotal job offers received by nine-month follow-up\n(n = 31)\n0.35 0.026\nCompetitive employment accepted (yes or no, n = 32) 0.15 0.210\nMIRS, mock interview rating scale; BIPOC, black, indigenous, and persons of color. aOnly n\u00a0= 12 participants reported whether or not they received an offer for a full-time job in the past 6 months.

Specifically, these variables included an independent role-play measure of general social competence for construct validity and multiple markers of neuropsychological function (i.e., processing speed, working memory, reasoning, and problem solving) and the perceived value and utility of job interview training for convergent validity. Notably, measures of social cognition and attention were significantly correlated with the MIRS at r = 0.28 or higher, but did not meet the r = 0.30 threshold to support convergent validity (72, 73). There were some non-significant correlations in the expected direction with lower magnitudes (e.g., verbal learning, psychopathology). The lack of these relationships could reflect that the ability to learn may be\u00a0less relevant than other cognitive abilities that are needed when navigating a job interview (e.g., engaging one\u2019s working memory when formulating responses to interview questions). The magnitude of the association between psychopathology and the MIRS was smaller (r = \u22120.20, p = 0.064) as compared with prior research examining the relationship between mental health symptomatology and barriers to employment (29). However, the salience of this relationship is noteworthy, given psychopathology was clinically rated and the interview skills were performance-based and rated by content experts masked to group assignment.\nOur results revealed that race, physical health, and alcohol and drug misuse did not correlate with the MIRS (25, 32), which suggests the presence of divergent validity, as we\u00a0did not expect the MIRS to be\u00a0associated with these constructs. The study results provide mixed support for criterion validity as one variable met the correlation magnitude threshold and obtained significance (i.e., longest held a fulltime job). Meanwhile, the variable \u201chaving received a part-time job offer in the past six months\u201d met the correlation threshold but did not obtain statistical significance. Other correlations were non-significant with low magnitudes (e.g., ever had a full or part-time job).\nWith respect to predictive validity, we\u00a0observed that the post-test MIRS from the IPS-as-usual group was associated with total jobs offered during the 9-month follow-up with a significant correlation above the 0.30 cutoff (72, 73). The correlation with total jobs offered is notably the most salient factor related to job interview skills as this suggests that those with stronger skills were offered more jobs. Moreover, this finding is consistent with a prior mechanistic analysis that the post-test MIRS score predicted receiving a job offer (18). Although the post-test MIRS was not correlated with accepting a competitive job, there are several extraneous factors that could influence whether individuals with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses accept a job offer. A few examples include: the position could generate too much income where one\u2019s benefits could be\u00a0 at risk, the job offered may reflect required working hours that do not align with public transportation schedules, or psychiatric symptoms could trigger fear of commitment, success, or socialization (86\u201390)."

            "text": "This initial study to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MIRS yielded several positive findings among its structure, reliability, and validity analyses. Thus, future studies may consider using the\nseven-item version of this assessment to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of innovative interventions focused on remediating job interview skills. Moreover, the need for strong job interview skills has likely been increased by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, online job interviews have become common and could be\u00a0a more challenging platform in which to convey your skills and enthusiasm for obtaining a job. As such, the use of the MIRS could help provide vocational rehabilitation programs serving adults with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses with a more standard, evidence-informed means to assess their clients\u2019 job interview skills.\nFor example, the MIRS could be particularly helpful within the individual placement and support model of supported employment, which emphasizes conducting an initial needs assessment (78, 91, 92). Although IPS has a variety of engagement tools available to providers, they do not yet have a standardized and accepted model of job interview role play. Given that approximately 50% of IPS clients engage in job interview role play training (16), the MIRS could potentially support this process. Thus, the MIRS could further inform and refine individualized services for adults with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses, both important aspects of IPS fidelity. Lastly a standardized job interview role play could significantly help ease the burden of training new IPS staff to provide a uniform assessment. Providers are largely left creating their own training resources for staff, and the freely available MIRS would power an amazing data collection tool of the assessment findings of the IPS client base before service begins."

            "heading": "Limitations and future directions",
            "text": "Results must be\u00a0 considered within the context of the study limitations. First, the parent RCT was not designed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MIRS. Therefore, the scope of variables to evaluate the MIRS\u2019 validity was limited. Second, support for the MIRS\u2019 criterion validity was limited, as only two (of five) variables were significant and met the 0.30 threshold. Notably, all baseline employment history variables were collected through self-reported methods that required participants to rely on their memories, which may be\u00a0limited, as individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses have cognitive impairments that interfere with recalling personal histories (93, 94). Thus, future research may consider using a timeline follow-back method to help participants remember their employment histories. Third, job interview skills may be\u00a0influenced by a number of factors among individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses that were not examined in the present study. For example, we\u00a0did not have a physiological measure of job interview anxiety, which is a commonly experienced state that disrupts one\u2019s interview skills (95\u201397). Fourth, interview skills are like any other skill that diminishes when not in use. Therefore, participants may have had stronger interview skills at the time they obtained jobs in their past, but, if they have not exercised those skills recently then that relationship (between baseline MIRS and employment history) may have diminished. Fifth, our evaluation of predictive validity only included the IPS-as-usual group and had limited statistical power, which should be\u00a0considered when interpreting the results. Sixth, several participants did not complete all of their monthly follow-ups to report their employment outcomes. Thus, missing data on the number of job interviews completed and job offers received outcomes were conservatively coded as negative employment outcomes,\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org\nwhich may have resulted in an underestimate of the correlation between the MIRS and employment outcome. Lastly, given that the eliminated item assessing \u201csounding honest\u201d was identified through stakeholder input as critical for the job interview performance (36), future research may consider reconceptualizing how this item is scored prior to re-evaluating it for potential fit with the MIRS."

            "text": "Job interviews are particularly challenging for individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses, and the field lacks a psychometrically-evaluated assessment of job interview skills. This study yielded a reliable seven-item measure of job interview skills [i.e., the mock interview rating scale (MIRS)] after removing a single item (sounding honest) that was a poor fit. The MIRS was found to meet several markers of construct, convergent, and divergent validities. Although some markers of criterion and predictive validities of the MIRS were observed, the strength of these result were more limited. Overall, this initial evaluation suggests the MIRS could serve as a suitable assessment in research as well as an approach to determine the strength of one\u2019s interview skills among individuals with schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses who are engaged in vocational rehabilitation services."
