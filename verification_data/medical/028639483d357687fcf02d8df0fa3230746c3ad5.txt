"Our results suggest that the three backcross populations should be evaluated under field conditions in locations with contrasting flatwood and central ridge-type soils. Such an experiment would demand the use of a technique different from rhizoboxes to study the RSA in situ with a wider time span. The results from such an experiment would indicate if the architectural data obtained in the rhizoboxes is predictive of root architecture in the field and, therefore, tree performance under varying soil conditions. [...] Therefore, we recommend for future studies to consider, in addition to the root architectural traits analyzed in this study, to include the additional factors such as the anatomical features of these backcrosses that may potentially influence the rootstock hydraulic conductivity in peach."
