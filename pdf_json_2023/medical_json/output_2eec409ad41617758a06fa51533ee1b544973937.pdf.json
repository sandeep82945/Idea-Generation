Targeted therapies mostly focus on treating inflammation-mediated symptoms. Conversely, shiatsu can address multiple symptoms including pain but also fatigue and sleep disturbance.\nWe therefore considered that it was a relevant task to evaluate its efficacy on fatigue in a SpA population. The present study is the first randomized study evaluating shiatsu treatment in order to reduce the fatigue associated with SpA."

            "text": "Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a potentially serious disease with reduced life expectancy [1, 2]. Even if the clinical presentation is eminently variable from one patient to another, the most frequently encountered manifestations such as inflammatory spinal pain, peripheral arthritis,\nor even extra-articular involvement of the disease all represent disabling symptoms, pain, temporary or in some cases permanent functional incapacity [3]. The disease also has general repercussions on daily life (fatigue, reactive depressive syndrome, etc.) [4] which require a multidisciplinary approach, involving several medical, paramedical, and other stakeholders.\nUp to 50\u201365% of patients report suffering from fatigue [5]. However, little is known about the precise relationship between axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and fatigue [6]. Although post hoc analyses have shown an improvement in pain provided by TNFi or IL-17A inhibitors [7\u201310], to date, no specific treatment targets fatigue in axSpA and thus, lacking a full explanation of the mechanisms underlying axSpAassociated fatigue, using a non-pharmacological intervention could be appropriate.\nShiatsu (finger pressure in Japanese) is an energetic manual discipline addressing the individual as a whole. It is a preventive and well-being therapy that aims to promote better health and is part of personal assistance. Shiatsu therapy is given with the patient dressed in soft clothes. Its objective is to correct both the energy flow (ki, blood, lymph, etc.) and the body structure (muscles, tendons, etc.) by applying rhythmic pressure to the whole body, most often with the thumbs. It can be applied to everyone at all ages. Its principle of action is to restore the free flow of Ki (qi, Energy) in the body and bodily flexibility. Shiatsu is a set of pressures performed mainly with the thumbs and the palms of the hands on different areas of the body, often the points of acupuncture meridians.\nThe effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions and in particular the care provided by shiatsu practitioners have not been the subject of studies evaluating, according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine, the benefit of this practice, particularly in the context of the treatment of axSpA.\nIn this study, we report the design of a preliminary trial to examine the impact of shiatsu on fatigue in patients with axSpA, as we suspected that shiatsu may result in alleviating the fatigue associated with axSpA."

The usual care of patients will not be modified, and management of the patients enrolled in this study will be modeled on the usually recommended management. The shiatsu protocol was developed by the SPS (see the\nappendix in the electronic supplementary material for details). This protocol was intended to be global: it was developed ad hoc for SpA and is not a fragment of a historical protocol as in the context of fundamental research at the shiatsu Research Lab.\nExercising a sham shiatsu is a challenging task. However, the consensus of the different schools and styles is that shiatsu pressure is a weight transfer. Therefore, we removed this aspect for the sham SFASPA shiatsu protocol. For sham shiatsu, the professional will run the same sequence of points, without any weight transfer, being only in contact with the receiver. Shiatsu and sham shiatsu sessions will have the same duration. Three shiatsu practitioners are involved in this study and for a given patient the same shiatsu professional will be required during both the shiatsu and the sham shiatsu sessions. In order to ensure that the shiatsu protocols are reproducible, the shiatsu professionals will exclusively carry out the shiatsu protocol established for this study. The three shiatsu professional practitioners were trained before the trial during a 1-day session by an experienced professional shiatsu practitioner (Bernardinelli N.).\nT ab le 1\nSc he du le of\nen ro lm en t, in te rv en ti on s, an d as se ss m en ts of\nth e SF A SP\nA tr ia la cc or di ng\nto th e St an da rd\nPr ot oc ol It em\ns: R ec om\nm en da ti on\nsf or\nIn te rv en ti on al\nT ri al s (S PI R IT ) 20 13\ngu id el in es\nV is it na m e\nV 0 pr esc re en in g\nSt ud\ny pe ri od\n1 St ud\ny pe ri od\n2\nV 1\nV 2\nV 3\nV 4\nV 5\nV 6\nV 7\nV 1\u2019\nV 2\u2019\nV 3\u2019\nV 4\u2019\nV 5\u2019\nV 6\u2019\nV 7\u2019\nV is it nu\nm be r\nD 0\nD 3\nD 14\nD 18\nD 28\nD 40\nD 56\nD 0\nD 3\nD 14\nD 18\nD 28\nD 40\nD 56\nD ay s\n0 3 \u00b1\n2 14\n\u00b1 2\n18 \u00b1\n2 28\n\u00b1 2\n40 \u00b1\n5 56\n\u00b1 2\n14 7 \u00b1\n2 15 0 \u00b1\n2 16 1 \u00b1\n2 16 5 \u00b1\n2 17 5 \u00b1\n2 18 7 \u00b1\n5 20 3 \u00b1\n2\nE nr ol m en t R ev ie w of\nin cl us io n\n/e xc lu si on\ncr it er ia\n3 3\nIn fo rm\ned co ns en t do cu m en t si gn ed\n3\nR an do m iz at io n\n3\nM ed ic al hi st or y an d si gn ifi ca nt hi st or ic al di ag no si s\n3\nPh ys ic al ex am\nin at io n\n3 3\n3 3\nA ss es sm\nen t\nB A SM\nI 3\n3 3\n3\nB A SD\nA I\n3 3\na 3\n3 a\n3 3\n3 a\n3 3\na 3\n3 a\n3 3\n3 a\nV A S pa in\n3 3\n3 x\n3 3\nx 3\n3 3\nX 3\n3 3\nB A SF I\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\nSF -1 2\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\nA SQ\noL 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3\nA SA\nS H I\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\nW PA\nI 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3\nH A D\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\nPS Q I\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\nFA C IT -F\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3\n3 3"

The level of fatigue is measured on a fourpoint Likert scale (4 = not at all tired to 0 = very tired). A response to fatigue will be defined as an improvement (i.e., an increase of C 4 points in the FACIT-fatigue score), which corresponds to the Minimum Clinically Important Difference [12].\nThe percentages of responders after a shiatsu intervention (three sessions) versus a sham (sham) shiatsu intervention (three sessions) (control group) will be assessed."

The BASDAI is a questionnaire to calculate the activity index of ankylosing spondylitis [13]. The intensity of five symptoms during the past week will be estimated, giving a score from 0 to 10. The BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index) questionnaire that was developed specifically to assess joint mobility in SpA. The BASFI reflects the functional impact, that is to say the inability to perform actions of daily life. For each of the ten activities, you must rate from 0 to 10 the ease or difficulty of performing them during the past month. 0 means completely easy, 10 means impossible. This score is an aid in monitoring ankylosing spondylitis. SF-36 Health Questionnaire (The Short-Form) is a self-assessment quality of life scale comprising 11 questions. ASQoL Questionnaire (Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire) is composed of 18 double-choice (yes/no) items.

ASAS Health Index (Health Index in Spondyloarthritis), this self-assessment questionnaire measures functioning and health across 17 aspects of health and nine environmental factors in patients with SpA [15]. The ASAS HI contains items covering the following categories: pain, emotional functions, sleep, sexual functions, mobility, autonomy, and community life. The WPAI scale (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire), this is a self-administered questionnaire where the assessment is based on the patient\u2019s absenteeism, presence and difficulties in carrying out work or outside activities [15]. The HAD Scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) is an instrument used to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. It comprises 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), thus allowing two scores to be obtained (maximum score for each score = 21) [16]. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is used to assess the sleep quality of subjects over the past month. The 17 scoring items in this study were combined into six components: sleep quality, time to fall asleep, sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep disorder, and daytime dysfunction [17]. The BASMI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index)\nmeasurement index allows to evaluate the mobility of the spine. It is composed of five items including: cervical rotation, tragus wall distance, lateral flexion of the spine, lumbar flexion, and inter malleolar distance. The score for each item is added together to result in a rating out of 10 [18]."

            "text": "Among non-pharmacological treatments for the various symptoms associated with SpA, shiatsu is increasingly used and available. We therefore considered that it was a relevant task to evaluate\nits efficacy on fatigue in a SpA population. The present study is the first randomized study evaluating shiatsu treatment in order to reduce the fatigue associated with SpA.\nFatigue and back pain are among the most common and disabling symptoms for patients living with SpA [5]. Targeted therapies mostly focus on treating inflammation-mediated symptoms. Conversely, shiatsu can address multiple symptoms including pain but also fatigue and sleep disturbance, as shown in [21, 22], which are appropriate outcomes that will be assessed in the present study in SpA patients.\nIn the present study, we try to apply the main rules of research methodology to the study protocol. However, one of the most important specificities of shiatsu is that it adapts itself to the person who receives it and it is not limited theoretically to the sole effect of acupoint massage. In the present study, in order to limit bias, we focused on the efficiency of shiatsu pressure and trained the three shiatsu practitioners to provide shiatsu therapy sessions based only on the specific shiatsu pressure protocol (see Figure S1 in the electronic supplementary material for details). Another potential issue was the conceptualization of a sham shiatsu procedure. Several different styles of shiatsu exist worldwide: some consider only the meridian points and also add some new ones, while others consider only the osteo-articular aspect of shiatsu, claiming that its founder, Tokujiro Namikoshi (1905\u20132000), never approached the energy dimension and that shiatsu was recognized by the Japanese Health Ministry on those grounds. We decided that the common point in all the shiatsu styles was the pressure applied to the body. In the present trial, we took a pragmatic and material approach, rather than an emotional and energetic approach. It would be another challenging task in the future to design a research trial with a \u2018\u2018free\u2019\u2019 shiatsu that could be tailored to the patient and not only to specific symptoms.\nWe thus acknowledge a limitation in the present study, as there was no placebo group in this randomized controlled trial; indeed, in \u2018\u2018energy medicine\u2019\u2019, a real sham procedure is impossible. The \u2018\u2018sham\u2019\u2019 acupressure we chose\nbased on light touch may produce an effect. However, if, in addition to the acupressure and sham acupressure groups, an inert control group had also been included, the design of the protocol would have been less ethical than the cross-over design we conceived.\nIn the present study, we use a specific shiatsu/acupressure protocol to study its effectiveness in SpA fatigue to facilitate replicability for future studies, rather than a complex treatment based on \u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019 diagnosis.\nWe hope that this shiatsu/acupressure study will adequately explore the effectiveness of shiatsu as an intervention in the care of patients with SpA and specifically in relieving its associated fatigue."
