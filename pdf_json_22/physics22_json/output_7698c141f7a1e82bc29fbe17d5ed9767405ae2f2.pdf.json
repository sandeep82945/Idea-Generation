INTRODUCTION\nAtomic-orbital-based methods (AOBMs)1\u20133 are generally regarded by the computational chemical community as more accurate numerically than the planewave density functional theory (DFT) methods.4,5 The reason is that, in earlier years, the pseudopotentials in the planewave DFT methods were not carefully generated when used in many planewave codes. However, since the projector augmented wave (PAW) method was suggested and used by Bl\u00f6chl,6 a lot of effort has been made, and reliable PAW pseudopotentials have been generated7 with constantly updated versions released, as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package\n(VASP) code.4 Due to the high computational costs, AOBMs with higher accuracies are generally used to calculate relatively small systems such as molecules. In contrast, the planewave DFT methods can be computationally much more efficient4,5 by using the supercell technology with periodic boundary conditions to simulate any crystalline material.\nDue to the fundamental importance in various scientific areas, including chemical physics, biophysics, environmental science, interstellar medium, etc., research on small molecules is constantly developing both theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, adsorption of small molecules on material surfaces (including outer surfaces of materials or the surfaces of pores in materials, e.g.,\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:56:29\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\nmolecular sieves8,9) is often considered for both theoretical studies and applications. The supercell for such a system by using a planewave DFT method often contains hundreds to thousands of atoms at least for obtaining reliable adsorption properties. In addition, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations10 for such systems are also selectively implemented, e.g., visualizing the diffusion paths of molecules on the surfaces, while AIMD simulations are much more demanding than normal structural optimization. Thus, using AOBMs with higher accuracies but also with high computational costs is impractical for such computation. Instead, the planewave DFT methods can be computationally practical due to the high efficiency. However, when a planewave DFT method is applied to a specific system, the reliability of the method must first be assessed because the accuracy of the DFT results can significantly depend on the electronic exchange-correlation energy functionals. To this end, we mention an example. It is wellknown that the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional11 cannot predict the interlayer spacing of graphite due to the absence of the dispersion corrections, e.g., the predicted lattice constant c = 8.870 \u00c5 along the [0001] direction of graphite from our previous PBE calculations12 is notoriously much larger than the experimental value of 6.6720 \u00c5.13 In contrast, the value of 6.701 \u00c5 from our optB88-vdW14 calculations with dispersion corrections can reproduce the above-mentioned experimental c value very well.12 Thus, one should be particularly careful when selecting a functional with or without dispersion corrections to analyze weakly bonded systems such as graphite.\nAs a semilocal functional, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) generally has comparably good accuracy for calculating ground state properties of neither weakly bonded nor strongly correlated systems. For example, recent extensive tests on the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies (or atomization energies) of 44 strongly and 17 weakly bonded solids from various local, semilocal, and nonlocal functionals (so-called \u201cDFT Jacob\u2019s ladder\u201d) have been reported.15,16 For the weakly bonded systems, dispersion corrections need to be considered,17 while for strongly correlated systems, DFT+U corrections are usually needed.18 In addition, more nonlocal functionals (upper rungs of the DFT Jacob\u2019s ladder) can have higher accuracies but higher computational costs than more local functionals (lower rungs). Therefore, to appropriately choose a functional before calculating a specific system, both accuracy and computational cost need to be balanced.\nRecently, we selected and applied the optB88-vdW functional,14 which typically considers dispersion correction including van der Walls (vdW) interactions, to various vdW materials with guest atoms12,19\u201330 and silica polymorphs with molecular groups consisting of C, H, and O.31 These applications have already been proven to be very successful. The success is not surprising, given that these systems include weakly bonded interlayer spaces, while for the weakly bonded systems, the GGA plus dispersion corrections generally have satisfactory accuracy, as described above. In the near future, we will extensively involve the adsorption and diffusion properties of small molecules on the outer or inner pore surfaces of such weakly bonded materials. The elements that make up these small molecules will be C, H, N and/or O, which are also the four most fundamental elements of organisms. Before extensively analyzing these large-size systems, an evaluation even only for these small molecules in the gas phase will be very instructive and necessary.\nIn this work, we use the PAW DFT method with the optB88-vdW functional to calculate the structural geometries, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies of all diatomic and triatomic molecules consisting of C, H, N, and/or O by considering 80 linear or triangular molecules or isomers. Then, we extend our calculations to two larger molecules NO3 and HNO3, containing four and five atoms, respectively, because these molecules will be the first candidates that will be involved in our ongoing projects, e.g., separation of rare earth elements. As a comparison, we also obtain the results using the most popular PBE GGA11 without dispersion corrections.\nThe paper is organized as follows: The computational details are described in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we tabulate and discuss the structural geometries, formation enthalpies, dissociation energies, and corresponding spin states of all 82 molecular molecules or isomers consisting of C, H, N, and/or O obtained from our DFT calculations and previous experiments or the AOBM calculations available in the literature. In Sec. IV, we also discuss our results and make error analysis by comparing with other relevant DFT results in the literature. Section V provides a summary of this work. The formulation of formation enthalpies and dissociation energies is provided in the supplementary material Sec. S1 and the original data for error analysis are also provided in the supplementary material."

            "text": "We use the VASP code4 to perform all DFT calculations in this work, with the PAW pseudopotentials7 developed by the VASP group and released in 2015. For the electron\u2013electron exchange correlation part, as described in Sec. I, we use PBE and optB88-vdW functionals without and with dispersion corrections, respectively. In all DFT calculations, we take the energy cut-off to be 600 eV with sufficient accuracy (cf. the default energy cut-offs of 400 eV for C, 250 eV for H, 400 eV for N, and 400 eV for O in the PAW pseudopotential data files). Spin polarizations are always considered because the energy of a molecular configuration depends on the spin state. For 80 diatomic or triatomic molecules or isomers, the supercell is always taken to be a rectangular box with a size of 23 \u00d7 22 \u00d7 21 \u00c53. For two larger molecules (NO3 and HNO3), the supercell is taken to be slightly larger, with a size of 24.3 \u00d7 24.2 \u00d7 24.1 \u00c53. These supercell sizes are sufficiently large so that the interactions between replicas can be ignored. The k mesh is always taken to be 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1, which is necessary because of the large supercell sizes. During energy minimization, the atoms in the supercell are fully relaxed after the initial configurations are judiciously selected based on previous experiments or AOBM calculations in the literature. The convergence of the total energy is reached when the force exerted on each atom is less than 0.01 eV/\u00c5."

            "text": "The energy of a diatomic molecule is a function of the interatomic distance (or atomic spacing), i.e., the potential energy surface (PES) is a one-dimensional (1D) curve. The bond length l between two atoms is defined as the atomic spacing at their equilibrium positions generally corresponding to the sole energy minimum of the PES.\nLet us first see three one-element diatomic molecules, HH or H2, NN or N2, and OO or O2, which are best available in the air in our daily lives. For H2, the bond lengths 0.7500 and 0.7442 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations reproduce the experimental values 0.741 4437 and 0.741 30 \u00c5,91 respectively, very well. These values from our PAW DFT calculations are even better than 0.7668 \u00c5 from previous Gaussian basis ab initio calculations;90 the dissociation energies 4.458 and 4.989 eV from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, are fairly good when compared with the experimental value of 4.4781 eV.33 For N2, the bond lengths 1.1129 \u00c5 (PBE) and 1.1087 \u00c5 (optB88-vdW) also reproduce the experimental value 1.097 68 \u00c537 very well-and are very close to the values 1.102\u20131.109 \u00c5 from previous AOBM calculations;84 the dissociation energies 10.393 eV (PBE) and 10.527 eV (optB88-vdW) are fairly good when compared with the experimental value of 9.754 eV33 and the values 9.19\u20139.50 eV from previous AOBM calculations.84 For O2, the bond lengths 1.2327 \u00c5 (PBE) and 1.2360 \u00c5 (optB88-vdW) still reproduce the experimental values 1.207 5237 and 1.2074 \u00c5, respectively, very well,104 also very close to the values 1.210\u20131.229 \u00c5 from previous AOBM calculations;96 the dissociation energies of 6.048 eV (PBE) and 6.000 eV (optB88-vdW) are comparably good with the experimental value 5.117 eV.33\nFor the C dimer CC or C2, the bond lengths of 1.3142 and 1.3093 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, somewhat overestimate the experimental value of 1.2425 \u00c537 than the values 1.247\u20131.255 \u00c5 from previous AOBM calculations.65,66 As will be analyzed below, the errors for C2 are the upper limits for all bond lengths obtained from our PAW DFT calculations in this work. However, the formation enthalpies of 8.780 eV (PBE) and 8.865 eV (optB88-vdW) match the experimental value of 8.499 eV33 well with very low relative errors (REs) (see the error analysis in Sec. IV C). The very positive formation enthalpies indicate that forming a C2 molecule from the bulk graphite is extremely unfavorable. The dissociation energies of 6.935 eV (PBE) and 6.704 eV (optB88-vdW) are also comparably good relative to the experimental value of 6.248 eV33 and the AOBM values of 6.072\u20136.371 eV.66 The very positive dissociation energies indicate that the bond strength in a C2 molecule is covalently strong.\nFor CH or HC, the bond lengths of 1.1369 and 1.1300 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations have good agreement with the experimental values of 1.119937 and 1.119 786 \u00c5,38 respectively, as well as 1.1204 \u00c5 from previous AOBM calculation.36 The formation enthalpies are 6.429 eV (PBE) and 6.384 eV (optB88-vdW), in line with the experimental value of 6.144 eV.33 The dissociation energies of 3.697 eV (PBE) and 3.895 eV (optB88-vdW) are also comparably good relative to the experimental value of 3.468 eV.33\nFor CN or NC, the bond lengths of 1.1768 and 1.1733 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, have excellent agreement with the experimental value of 1.1718 \u00c5,37 an AOBM value of 1.18 \u00c5,52 and the value of 1.162 \u00c5 from a hybrid functional\nB3LYP.53 The formation enthalpies of 4.515 eV (PBE) and 4.606 eV (optB88-vdW) are also in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 4.526 eV.33 The dissociation energies of 8.539 eV (PBE) and 8.441 eV (optB88-vdW) are comparable with the experimental value of 7.724 eV.33\nFor CO or OC, the bond lengths of 1.1431 and 1.1393 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, have good agreement with the experimental value of 1.128 323 \u00c537 and the AOBM value of 1.1513 \u00c5.62 Our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations predict the negative formation enthalpies of \u22120.621 and \u22120.715 eV, consistent with the experimental value of\u22121.1795 eV.33 The negative formation enthalpy indicates that forming CO from the gas phase of O2 and bulk graphite is thermodynamically favorable. The dissociation energies of 11.502 eV (PBE) and 11.499 eV (optB88-vdW) are in good agreement with the experimental value of 11.111 eV.33 The dissociation energy of CO is the largest among those of all ten diatomic molecules in this section, indicating the strongest bond strength.\nFor HN or NH, the bond lengths of 1.0506 and 1.0485 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, are in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.0362 \u00c537 and the AOBM value of 1.035 \u00c5.79 The formation enthalpies of 3.602 eV (PBE) and 3.732 eV (optB88-vdW) are in excellent agreement with the experimental value 3.718 eV.33 The dissociation energies of 3.863 eV (PBE) and 4.025 eV (optB88-vdW) are fairly good relative to the experimental value 3.398 eV.33\nFor HO or OH, the bond lengths of 0.9868 and 0.9862 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, are in good agreement with the experimental value of 0.969 66 \u00c537 and the AOBM value of 0.971 \u00c5.85 The formation enthalpies of 0.586 eV (PBE) and 0.607 eV (optB88-vdW) are comparable with the experimental value of 0.386 eV33 and the AOBM value of 0.3845 eV.86 The dissociation energies of 4.706 eV (PBE) and 4.887 eV (optB88-vdW) are also comparable with the experimental value of 4.411 eV.33\nFor NO or ON, the bond lengths of 1.1687 and 1.1676 \u00c5 from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively, have good agreement with the experimental value of 1.150 77 \u00c537 and the AOBM values of 1.154 and 1.169 \u00c5.96 The formation enthalpies of 0.946 eV (PBE) and 0.948 eV (optB88-vdW) are in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 0.939 eV.33 The dissociation energies of 7.274 eV (PBE) and 7.316 eV (optB88-vdW) are comparable with the experimental value of 6.496 eV.33\nFor the above ten diatomic molecules, we also rank them in order of bond lengths, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies. From the smallest (about 0.74 \u00c5) to largest (about 1.25 \u00c5) bond length, the order from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations or from experiments is always consistently HH < HO < HN < NN < CH < CO <NO < CN <OO < CC. From the lowest (about \u22121 eV) to highest (about 9 eV) formation enthalpy, the order from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations or from experiments is always consistently CO < (HH = NN = OO) <HO < NO <HN < CN < CH < CC, where the formation enthalpy of HH, NN, or OO is zero (i.e., the energy reference point). CO is the sole one with a negative formation enthalpy among the ten diatomic molecules, indicating that it is thermodynamically most stable relative to its reference systems.

            "text": "The energy of a triatomic molecule is a function of three interatomic distances (or equivalently two interatomic distances and the angle between them), and therefore, the PES is a 3D curve and much more complicated than the 1D curve for a diatomic molecule. In general, the PES of a triatomic molecule has multiple energy minima corresponding to different structural geometries (or spatial arrangements of atoms), which are commonly called locally stable isomers, and the global energy minimum corresponds to the most stable isomer. For clarity, we refer to all isomers having the same number of atoms in each element but distinct structural geometries as one isomer type. For triatomic molecules consisting of C, H, N, and/or O, there are 20 isomer types in total. In principle, all locally stable isomers of each isomer type can be found by calculating and searching its full 3D PES curve. However, such work is demanding. In this paper, we only focus on several typical isomers for each type, including linear and triangular isomers, especially for those with available data from previous experiments or AOBM calculations.\nIn Table I, we show the optimized structural geometries of all isomers from our optB88-vdW calculations (the corresponding structural geometries from our PBE calculations are very close to those from the optB88-vdW calculations and therefore are not shown). All bond lengths, formation enthalpies, dissociation energies, and spin magnetic moments from our PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, as well as from previous experiments and AOBM calculations, are provided in Table I. In this section, we selectively discuss the 20 types of triatomic molecular isomers. For the isomer types, we adopt the NIST notations32 for convenient indexing with the formulas in alphabetic order of element symbols and the numbers of elemental atoms in the molecule as subscripts 1, 2, 3, . . ., etc. In Table I, the conventional notations and names for isomers are also listed.\nFor each isomer type, we consider various possible linear and triangular isomers by relaxing the judiciously selected initial configurations, e.g., based on previous experiments or AOBM calculations in the literature. For a linear isomer, the name \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 (or equivalently \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1) indicates that atom \u03b2 is in the middle position with atoms \u03b1 and \u03b3 on the two sides, where \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 can be C, H, N, and/or O; correspondingly, the two bond lengths are denoted by l\u03b2\u03b1 and l\u03b2\u03b3. The triangular isomers can be obtuse (or quasilinear) and acute (or cyclic). The order of atoms in the name of a triangular isomer also indicates the optimized configuration, e.g., for the triangular isomer name \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 or \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1, atom \u03b2 is in the middle position with atoms \u03b1 and \u03b3 on the two sides; correspondingly, the two bond lengths are denoted by l\u03b2\u03b1 and l\u03b2\u03b3 with the bond angle denoted as \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 or \u03b8\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1. Below, we also use notations \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 (L), \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 (Q), and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 (C) to indicate that the isomer \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is linear, quasilinear triangular, and cyclic triangular, respectively.\nC1H1N1. We obtain one triangular isomer and three linear (HCN, HNC, and CHN) isomers. The triangular isomer is cyclic, and no any stable or metastable quasilinear isomer is found. A lower\n(higher) formation enthalpy indicates a more (less) stable isomer. From more to less stable, the order is HCN (L) > HNC (L) > HCN (C) > CHN (L) with the formation enthalpies of about 1.3, 1.9, 3.3, and 11.6 eV, respectively. Our DFT (PBE and optB88-vdW) values for bond lengths, bond angles, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies are in good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). Generally, the experimental measurements for less stable isomers with significantly higher formation enthalpies are often more difficult, and therefore, the experimental data for the linear CHN and cyclic isomers are still unavailable in the literature. Note that, for experimental observations, a \u201cless stable\u201d isomer means not only a relatively higher formation enthalpy (i.e., thermodynamically less stable) but also a low energy barrier (i.e., kinetically less stable) from that isomer to another with a lower formation enthalpy, while the latter isomer is \u201cmore stable\u201d both thermodynamically and kinetically. In this work, we do not consider the energy barriers between isomers. Therefore, in all statements below, the word \u201cstable\u201d always means \u201cthermodynamically stable,\u201d i.e., we omit the word \u201cthermodynamically.\u201d\nC1H1O1. We obtain two quasilinear (HCO and HOC) and three linear (HCO, HOC, and CHO) isomers. From more to less stable, the order is HCO (Q) > HCO (L) > HOC (Q) > HOC (L) > CHO (L) with the formation enthalpies of about 0.5, 1.5, 1.7, 2.3, and 8.3 eV, respectively. Our DFT values for bond lengths, bond angles, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies are in good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values for HCO (Q) and HOC (Q) (see Table I). In addition, our DFT values of DCO+H for HOC (L) are zero, indicating no bonding between H and CO, i.e., HOC (L) is not one single \u201creal\u201d molecule but an isolated CO molecule plus an isolated H atom, as also indicated by the large H\u2013O distance beyond 6.6 \u00c5 (see Table I). In other words, no energy minimum is found for linear HOC.\nC1H2. We obtain one quasilinear (HCH) isomer and two linear (HCH and CHH) isomers. The most stable isomer is HCH (Q) with the formation enthalpies of 3.890 eV (PBE) and 4.176 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value 4.053 eV.33 The C\u2013H bond lengths of 1.0849 \u00c5 (PBE) and 1.0816 \u00c5 (optB88-vdW) as well as bond angles of 135.06\u25cb (PBE) and 135.04\u25cb (optB88-vdW) are in excellent agreement with the experimental bond length of 1.075 30 \u00c5 and bond angle of 133.9308\u25cb51 as well as the AOBM bond length of 1.074 81 \u00c5 and bond angle of 133.839\u25cb.50 In contrast, the isomer HCH (L) is slightly unstable with the formation enthalpies of 4.078 eV (PBE) and 4.368 eV (optB88-vdW), while the isomer CHH (L) is extremely unstable with the significantly higher formation enthalpies of 7.635 eV (PBE) and 7.704 eV (optB88vdW). For dissociation energies of HCH (Q), our DFT values are also in good agreement with the available experimental values (see Table I).\nC1N1O1. We obtain one triangular isomer and three linear (CNO, CON, and NCO) isomers. The triangular isomer is cyclic, and no any stable or metastable quasilinear isomer is found. From more to less stable, the order is NCO (L) > CNO (L) > NCO (C) > CON (L) with the formation enthalpies of about 1, 4, 4.5, and 6 eV, respectively. Our DFT values for bond lengths, bond angles, and formation enthalpies are in good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I).\nC1N2.

The most stable isomer is NCN (L) with the formation enthalpies of 4.149 eV (PBE) and 4.301 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 4.677 eV.33 CNN (L) has the formation enthalpies of 5.308 eV (PBE) and 5.484 eV (optB88-vdW), while NCN (C) has the highest formation enthalpies of 5.733 eV (PBE) and 5.887 eV (optB88-vdW). Our DFT values for bond lengths and bond angles for these isomers are in good agreement with the available B3LYP and AOBM values (see Table I). No experimental data for geometric parameters are available for this isomer type. The difficulty in experimental measurements for these isomers is likely because of their instabilities with the high formation enthalpies beyond 4 eV and likely low energy barriers for dissociations.\nC1O2. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is linear OCO (L) (i.e., conventionally CO2) with the very negative formation enthalpies of \u22123.870 eV (PBE) and \u22123.863 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of \u22124.074 eV,33 indicating its high stability. We also obtain another linear isomer COO (L) and a triangular cyclic isomer, both of which have very positive formation enthalpies and therefore are relatively very unstable. For bond length lCO and other formation enthalpies or dissociation energies, our DFT values are also comparably good relative to the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I).\nC2H1. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is linear CCH (L) with the very positive formation enthalpies of 5.938 eV (PBE) and 6.175 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 5.843 eV,33 indicating its high instability. For bond lengths lCC and lCH, as well as dissociation energies of CCH (L), our DFT values have good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). A triangular cyclic isomer is obtained with the higher formation enthalpies of 6.750 eV (PBE) and 7.016 eV (optB88-vdW). We also obtain another linear isomer CHC (L) with very high formation enthalpies of 12.903 eV (PBE) and 13.054 eV (optB88-vdW).\nC2N1. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is linear CNC (L) with the very positive formation enthalpies of 6.873 eV (PBE) and 6.892 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 6.967 eV,33 indicating its high instability. We also obtain another linear isomer CCN (L) with slightly higher formation enthalpies of 6.929 eV (PBE) and 6.966 eV (optB88-vdW). The high instability makes experimental measurements difficult for its structural parameters.71 A triangular cyclic isomer is also obtained with further higher formation enthalpies of 7.375 eV (PBE) and 7.531 eV (optB88-vdW). For bond lengths, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies of all these isomers, our DFT values have good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I).\nC2O1. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is linear CCO (L) with the formation enthalpies of 3.876 eV (PBE) and 3.991 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 3.909 eV.33 For bond lengths lCC and lCO, as well as dissociation energies, our DFT values are comparably good relative to the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). A triangular isomer CCO (Q) with bond angles of 109.034\u25cb (PBE) and 108.665\u25cb (optB88vdW) (see Table I) is obtained with the much higher formation enthalpies of 5.957 eV (PBE) and 6.008 eV (optB88-vdW). We also obtain another linear isomer COC (L) with high formation enthalpies of 6.501 eV (PBE) and 6.575 eV (optB88-vdW). The\nformation enthalpies and dissociation energies of these isomers are also in good agreement with the experimental values listed in Table I.\nC3. Our DFT results show that the PES from quasilinear CCC (Q) to linear CCC (L) is almost flat in the region with the bond angles close to 180\u25cb. From our PBE calculations, it can be seen that the change in the formation enthalpy is only 0.0058 eV (from 8.6997 to 8.7055 eV), with the bond length from 1.3027 to 1.3018 \u00c5 and the bond angle from 149.255\u25cb to 180\u25cb. From our optB88-vdW calculations, it can be seen that the change in formation enthalpy is only \u22120.0002 eV (from 8.6579 to 8.6577 eV), with the bond length from 1.2949 to 1.2948 \u00c5 and the bond angle from 170.243\u25cb to 180\u25cb. This energy degenerate behavior from CCC (Q) to linear CCC (L) is consistent with previous AOBM calculations.78,111 These DFT bond lengths, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies are in good agreement with previous experimental and AOBM data (see Table I). We also obtain a cyclic isomer CCC (C) with formation enthalpies of 9.212 eV (PBE) and 9.491 eV (optB88-vdW), which are higher (i.e., the isomer is less stable) than the above-mentioned values for CCC (Q) or CCC (L). Also note that the spin magnetic momentum M = 2 \u03bcB of CCC (C) is different from M = 0 \u03bcB for CCC (Q) or CCC (L). Note that the formation enthalpy and dissociation energies for the cyclic isomer are also in good agreement with the experimental values in Table I.\nH1N1O1. We obtain two quasilinear (HNO and HON) and three linear (HNO, HON, and NHO) isomers. From more to less stable, the order is HNO (Q) > HON (Q) > HNO (L) > HON (L) > NHO (L) with the formation enthalpies of about 1.0, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, and 5.8 eV, respectively. The bond lengths, bond angles, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies from our DFT calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I).\nH1N2. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is quasilinear HNN (Q) with the formation enthalpies of 2.016 eV (PBE) and 2.168 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value 2.613 eV.33 The values of 0.253 eV (PBE) and 0.326 eV (optB88vdW) for the dissociation energy DH+N2 of HNN(Q) are comparable to the AOBM values 0.438\u20131.184 eV82 and 0.323\u20130.898 eV,84 cf. the relatively slightly negative value \u22120.374 eV from experiments.33 Other PBE and optB88-vdW dissociation energies are also comparable with the experimental values in Table I. The bond lengths and bond angles from our DFT calculations are in good agreement with the available AOBM values (see Table I), while the experimental data in the literature are unavailable for these geometric parameters. We also obtain the linear isomer HNN (L) with higher formation enthalpies of 3.124 eV (PBE) and 3.285 eV (optB88-vdW), as well as the linear isomer NHN (L) with much higher formation enthalpies of 8.784 eV (PBE) and 8.981 eV (optB88-vdW). In addition, our DFT values of DHN+N for NHN (L) are 0.014 eV (PBE) and 0.015 eV (optB88-vdW), indicating a weak bond between N and HN with the bond length of about 2.6 \u00c5 (see Table I), which approaches the range of vdW interactions.\nH1O2. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is triangular HOO (Q) with the slightly negative formation enthalpies of \u22120.004 eV (PBE) and \u22120.005 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the positive but relatively low experimental value of 0.157 eV33 and AOBM value of 0.1535 eV.86 All dissociation energies from PBE and optB88-vdW calculations for HOO (Q) are comparable to the experimental\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-22\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:56:29\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\nvalues33 in Table I. The bond lengths and bond angles from our DFT calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental values (also see Table I). For the linear isomer HOO (L), we obtain the significantly higher formation enthalpies of 3.608 eV (PBE) and 3.605 eV (optB88-vdW), as well as DHO+O = 0.002 eV (PBE and optb88-vdW), indicating negligible bonding between O and HO, i.e., they are almost isolated, as indicated by the large O\u2013O distance beyond 5.7 \u00c5 (see Table I). In addition, we also obtain the linear isomer OHO (L) with formation enthalpies of 3.248 eV (PBE) and 3.240 eV (optB88-vdW).\nH2N1. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is triangular HNH (Q) with the formation enthalpies of 1.555 eV (PBE) and 1.739 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 1.958 eV.33 All dissociation energies from PBE and optB88-vdW calculations for HNH (Q) are comparable to the experimental values33 in Table I. The bond lengths and bond angles from our DFT calculations for HNH (Q) are in good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (also see Table I). We also obtain the linear isomer HNH (L) with significantly higher formation enthalpies of 2.893 eV (PBE) and 3.083 eV (optB88-vdW). For the linear isomer HHN (L), we obtain further significantly higher formation enthalpies of 5.189 eV (PBE) and 5.259 eV (optB88-vdW), as well as DH2+N = 0.008 eV (PBE) and 0.005 eV (optb88-vdW), indicating negligible bonding between N and HH, i.e., both N and HH (or H2) are nearly isolated, as indicated by the large H\u2013N distance beyond 2.8 \u00c5 (see Table I again).\nH2O1. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is triangular HOH (Q) with the negative formation enthalpies of \u22122.520 eV (PBE) and \u22122.433 eV (optB88-vdW), which match the experimental value of \u22122.476 eV33 well. The bond lengths and bond angles from our DFT calculations for HOH (Q) are in excellent agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). We also obtain a triangular HOH, which is actually a complex but weak vdW interaction between O and HH, as indicated by DH+HO \u2248 0 (see triangular 2 HOH in Table I). For the linear isomer OHH (L), we obtain positive formation enthalpies of 2.833 eV (PBE) and 3.055 eV (optB88-vdW), as well as DH+HO = 0.022 eV (PBE) and 0.047 eV (optb88-vdW), again indicating weak bonding between H and HO. The formation enthalpies and dissociation energies from the DFT calculations for these isomers have good consistency with the experimental values in Table I. In addition, we also obtain the linear isomer HOH (L) with higher but still negative formation enthalpies of \u22121.266 eV (PBE) and \u22121.182 eV (optB88-vdW).\nH3. The PES of linear HHH is available from the early AOBM work.94,95 From the PES, it can be seen that there are no stable linear geometries for three bonded H atoms. To assess the consistency of our DFT results with these AOBM results, we first select two locally equilibrium linear HHH with short bond lengths around 1 \u00c5 (see linear 1 and linear 2 HHH in Table I), which always obtain negative DH+H2 , which indeed indicates the instabilities of these two linear geometries. We also obtain a linear geometry with two H\u2013H distances of about 0.75 and 4.72 \u00c5 (see linear 3 HHH in Table I), respectively, and the lowest formation enthalpies of 2.269 eV (PBE) and 2.494 eV (optB88-vdW), as well as DH+H2 = 0.000 eV (PBE) and 0.001 eV (optb88-vdW), indicating no bonding between H and HH, i.e., a system of an isolated H atom plus an isolated H2 molecule\nis more stable than any linearly fully bonded HHH. For the consistency of formation enthalpies and other dissociation energies of these isomers from the DFT calculations with the available experimental data, see Table I. In early work,112\u2013114 equilateral triangular states with the side lengths of about 0.85 \u00c5 for HHH are predicted. However, we cannot find such fully bonded triangular HHH from our DFT calculations. Instead, we find that three H atoms for any initially triangular HHH always become isolated after full relaxation (see, e.g., a triangular cyclic HHH in Table I), as indicated by the corresponding D3H = 0.002 eV (PBE) and 0.000 eV (optb88-vdW). This seems to imply that the fully bonded stable H3 structures do not exist at all, thus consistent with our above-mentioned DFT predictions. This instability is also consistent with the very negative experimental values of DH+H2 = \u22125.491 eV and D3H = \u22121.013 eV33 for an equilateral triangular state.\nN1O2. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is triangular ONO (Q) (i.e., conventionally NO2) with the negative formation enthalpies of \u22120.195 eV (PBE) and \u22120.110 eV (optB88vdW), cf. the positive but quite low experimental value 0.382 eV.33 For bond length lNO and bond angle \u03b8ONO, our DFT values are in excellent agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). The dissociation energies from the DFT calculations are comparable with the experimental values (see Table I). For the linear isomer ONO (L), we obtain much higher DFT formation enthalpies of about 11.2 eV, as well as DN+2O = 0.016 eV, indicating weak bonding between three atoms with large bond lengths beyond 3.2 \u00c5. We also obtain the linear isomer NOO (L) with DFT formation enthalpies of about 4.6 eV. Again, the relatively high formation enthalpies imply high instabilities of the linear isomers. We also obtain a triangular NOO (Q) (see Table I) with a relatively small positive DNO+O \u2248 0.6 eV, indicating weak bonding between O and NO, while the corresponding experimental value \u22120.704 eV33 is slightly negative, indicating the instability of this isomer. We also tried to obtain a cyclic ONO, but no stable configuration was found. This is also consistent with the negative value of DNO+O \u2248 \u22120.182 eV (again indicating the instability of the isomer) from experiments.33\nN2O1. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is linear NNO (L) with the formation enthalpies of 0.168 eV (PBE) and 0.308 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 0.892 eV.33 The bond lengths from our DFT calculations are in excellent agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). For the linear isomer NON (L), we obtain much higher DFT formation enthalpies of about 4.8 eV. We also obtain an isosceles triangular isomer NON (C) with DFT formation enthalpies of about 3.3 eV (see triangular cyclic NON in Table I). Both NON (L) and NON (C) have relatively high formation enthalpies, implying their instabilities relative to NNO (L). For the dissociation energies of these isomers, the DFT values also have good agreement with the experimental values and AOBM values, as listed in Table I.\nN3. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is the linearly symmetric NNN (L) with the formation enthalpies of 3.612 eV (PBE) and 3.797 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value of 4.687 eV.33 The bond lengths of 1.1888 \u00c5 (PBE) and 1.1866 \u00c5 (optB88-vdW) from our DFT calculations are in excellent agreement with the experimental values 1.1815100 and 1.181 15 \u00c5,101\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-23\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:56:29\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\neven better than the AOBM values 1.1570 and 1.1538 \u00c5, respectively.99 We also obtain three triangular isomers with slightly different geometries (see triangular 1, triangular 2, triangular 3 for cyclic NNN in Table I) and formation enthalpies (about 5.5 eV). For triangular 2, the bond lengths and bond angle are consistent with the previous B3LYP values,102 as well as the formation enthalpies with experimental values (see again triangular 2 for cyclic NNN in Table I). For the consistency of dissociation energies between the DFT and experimental values, see Table I.\nO3. The most stable isomer from our DFT calculations is quasilinear OOO (Q) with the formation enthalpies of 1.287 eV (PBE) and 1.218 eV (optB88-vdW), cf. the experimental value 1.497 eV.33 The bond lengths from our DFT calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental and AOBM values (see Table I). The dissociation energy DO+O2 values of OOO (Q) are 1.737 eV (PBE) and 1.782 eV (optB88-vdW), cf., the experimental value 1.06 eV.33 The dissociation energy D3O values of OOO (Q) are 7.784 eV (PBE) and 7.782 eV (optB88-vdW), cf., the experimental value 6.178 eV.33 For the linear isomer OOO (L), we obtain higher DFT formation enthalpies of about 3.7 eV, and thus, it is relatively unstable. We also try to calculate cyclic geometries and obtain a configuration with three almost isolated O atoms (see triangular cyclic OOO in Table I), for which the formation enthalpies are about 9 eV high and the D3O values are nearly zero, implying no stable bonded cyclic OOO isomers. This is also consistent with a negative value of DO+O2 = \u22120.268 eV from experiments for a cyclic OOO isomer.33"

Note that the mean error (ME)\n\u0394QME \u2261 1n n \u2211 i=1 \u0394Qi (3)\nis generally not very appropriate for assessing DFT values because of the cancellation in positive and negative \u0394Qi values, although ME values are often given in the literature.\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-24\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:56:29\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\nThe relative error (RE) or percentage error (PE) is defined as\n\u03b4Qi \u2261 Qi \u2212Q0iQ0i \u00d7 100%. (4)\nThe mean absolute relative error (MARE) or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is defined as\n\u03b4Q MAPE \u2261 1n n \u2211 i=1 \u2223\u03b4Qi\u2223, (5)\nand the mean relative error (MRE) or mean percentage error (MPE) is defined as\n\u03b4Q MPE \u2261 1n n \u2211 i=1 \u03b4Qi. (6)\nHere, we need to mention that in the literature, the RE (or PE), MARE (or MAPE), and MRE (or MPE) are often given to assess DFT values, but sometimes, using these errors is not very instructive (even misleading) especially for relatively small magnitudes, e.g., for the magnitudes (\u2272 0.2 eV) of atomization energies of inert gas crystals,126 which are very sensitive to their AEs, as will be mentioned below.\nFor the above-mentioned dataset {Qi}, we also give the corresponding standard deviation\ns = \u00bf \u00c1\u00c1\u00c0 1\nn\nn\n\u2211 i=1 \u2223\u0394Qi\u22232 or s =\n\u00bf \u00c1\u00c1\u00c0 1\nn\nn\n\u2211 i=1 \u2223\u03b4Qi\u22232. (7)\nNote that the standard deviation s reflects the discreteness of the dataset {\u2223\u0394Qi\u2223} or {\u2223\u03b4Qi\u2223}. Larger (smaller) s indicates that the dataset is more (less) discrete.\nIt must be mentioned that a quantity often has a significant uncertainty from different experimental measurements. In Tables I and II, the experimental data for formation enthalpies and dissociation energies from ATcT are listed with uncertainties corresponding to estimated 95% confidence limits.34,35 To describe the uncertainty for a dataset {Qi}, one can also give a corresponding confidence limit by\nu1\u2212\u03b1 = \u00b1t\u03b1,ns, (8)\nwhere s is obtained from Eq. (7) and t\u03b1,n with the confidence level 1 \u2212 \u03b1 is an n-dependent factor related to student\u2019s t-distribution. For a 95% confidence interval, \u03b1 in Eq. (8) is equal to 1 \u2212 0.95 = 0.05, and then t\u03b1,n can be determined from the degree of freedom n. The 95% confidence limit described by Eq. (8) gives an estimate of what kind of accuracy could be expected when the same kind of quantity (e.g., the formation enthalpy) for an additional molecule or isomer (not contained in the dataset {Qi}) is calculated. It should be noted that Eq. (8) has a different form from the well-known confidence intervals for evaluating the uncertainty of a new measurement after n measurements of a quantity for a given molecule.\nIn the error analysis given below, the selected reference experimental values based on Tables I and II for bond lengths, bond angles, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies are provided in Tables S1\u2013S4 in the supplementary material, respectively. In the selection of experimental data for formation enthalpies or dissociation energies, we have considered the datasets used previously in the assessment of the PBE GGA.127\u2013135 Fortunately, the recently updated ATcT values33 have been already available for most of the formation enthalpies and dissociation energies of molecules or isomers in this work, and therefore, the ATcT values are prioritized, as listed in Tables I and II, as well as in Tables S3 and S4 with more significant figures.\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-25\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:56:29\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\nTABLE III.

S1. The AEs [\u0394(\u0394H\u2217f ) and \u0394(\u0394Hf)] and PEs\n[\u03b4(\u0394Hf) = \u03b4(\u0394H\u2217f )] of the corresponding PBE and optB88-vdW values are plotted in Fig. 3. The AEs (\u0394D\u2217 and \u0394D) and PEs (\u03b4D = \u03b4D\u2217) of the corresponding PBE and optB88-vdW values are plotted in Fig. 4.\nFor AE or MAE analysis, using \u0394H\u2217f and D \u2217 is more reasonable than directly using \u0394Hf and D because the number of atoms in a molecule can vary (for this work, the number can be 2, 3, 4, or 5), especially for an error comparison between DFT datasets with different samples, e.g., between molecules with a varying number of atoms and crystals with different numbers of atoms in their primitive cells. The per-atom cohesive energies or atomization energies have been widely used for error analysis in the DFT functional tests,16,127,129,130,132 as analyzed below. Note that the per-atom formation enthalpies are also used in the previous literature, e.g., for comparison between experimental and DFT reaction energies of compounds.136 Thus, we mainly focus on \u0394(\u0394H\u2217f ) or \u0394D\u2217 [not \u0394(\u0394Hf) or \u0394D] for AE or MAE analysis in this work, although all errors are included in Table III. In addition, using \u0394H\u2217f and \u0394Hf or using D\n\u2217 and D has no distinction for PE or MAPE analysis, according to their definitions in Sec. S1 and Eqs. (1)\u2013(6).\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-28\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\nAmong the 49 formation enthalpies, the AE maxima are \u0394(\u0394H\u2217f )max = 0.279 eV/atom (PBE) and 0.232 eV/atom (optB88-vdW) for linear CO. The \u2223AE\u2223 maxima are \u2223\u0394(\u0394H\u2217f )\u2223max= 0.358 eV/atom (PBE) and 0.297 eV/atom (optB88-vdW) for linear NNN. The AE minima are \u0394(\u0394H\u2217f )min = \u22120.358 eV/atom (PBE) and \u22120.297 eV (optB88-vdW) for linear NNN. The \u2223AE\u2223 minima are \u2223\u0394(\u0394H\u2217f )\u2223min = 0.0034 eV/atom (PBE) for NO and 0.0027 eV/atom (optB88-vdW) for linear HCN. The MAEs (as well as s and u0.95 values) of these 49 formation enthalpies are \u0394(\u0394H\u2217f )MAE = 0.109 (s = 0.142, u0.95 = \u00b10.285) eV/atom (PBE) and 0.097 (s = 0.124, u0.95 = \u00b10.249) eV/atom (optB88-vdW). The quite small MAE and u0.95 values indicate that both PBE and optB88-vdW values for these formation enthalpies are overall satisfactory. In addition, the optB88-vdW result has the smaller MAE and u0.95 values than the PBE result, and therefore it is even better than the PBE result. All the above-mentioned errors are plotted in Fig. 3 and listed in Table III as a summary.\nAs already mentioned above, PE and MAPE can be very sensitive to small AEs when the analyzed data have relatively small magnitudes. For example, the experimental value of \u0394H\u2217f for triangular HOO is 0.0523 eV/atom, and the PAW PBE value is \u22120.0012 eV/atom. Then, the AE is \u22120.0535 eV/atom with a quite small magnitude of 0.0535 eV/atom, but the corresponding PE is \u2212102.44% with a huge magnitude >100%. This implies that PE or MAPE is not very proper for rating the DFT values in the case for which the rated data have relatively small magnitudes and/or the corresponding experimental data perhaps have significant uncertainties, as some of those in the list of the 49 formation enthalpies. Thus, we do not use PE and MAPE to rate our DFT values for formation enthalpies, although we plot them in Fig. 3 and list them in Table III for information only.\nAmong the 138 dissociation energies, the AE or \u2223AE\u2223 maxima are \u0394D\u2217max = \u2223\u0394D\u2217\u2223max = 0.688 eV/atom (PBE) for the atomization energy of planar NO3 and 0.697 eV/atom (optB88-vdW) for the atomization energy of triangular NOO. The AE minima are \u0394D\u2217min = \u22120.066 eV/atom (PBE) for dissociating O and HH from the triangular vdW complex HOH and \u22120.016 eV (optB88-vdW) for dissociating O and HH from the linear vdW complex OHH. The \u2223AE\u2223 minima are \u2223\u0394D\u2217\u2223\nmin = 0.010 eV/atom (PBE) for dissociating H\nand HH from the linear vdW complex HHH and 0.002 eV/atom (optB88-vdW) for dissociating H and NO3 from the planar HNO3. The MAEs (as well as s and u0.95 values) of these 138 dissociation energies are \u0394D\u2217MAE = 0.292 (s = 0.334, u0.95 = \u00b10.660) eV/atom (PBE) and 0.288 (s = 0.324, u0.95 = \u00b10.641) eV/atom (optB88-vdW). The quite small MAE and u0.95 values indicate that both PBE and optB88-vdW values for these dissociation energies are overall satisfactory. Similar to the above-mentioned description for formation enthalpies, some of the 138 bond dissociation energies have relatively small magnitudes, and/or the corresponding experimental data perhaps have significant uncertainties. Thus, we also do not use PE and MAPE to rate our DFT values for bond dissociation energies, although we list them in Table III for information only. Here, we also note that, among the \u0394D\u2217 values for 138 isomers plotted in Fig. 4, there are only three and two isomers with negative \u0394D\u2217 values and these negative \u0394D\u2217 values have relatively small \u2223\u0394D\u2217\u2223 values from PBE and optB88-vdW calculations, respectively. This behavior contrasts \u0394(\u0394H\u2217f ), for which the ratios of numbers with negative and positive values are much higher than those for the \u0394D\u2217 values.\nAIP Advances 12, 125009 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0117378 12, 125009-29\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:56:29\nAIP Advances ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/adv\nIn the literature, the error analyses for atomization energies or cohesive energies by testing various types of solids or molecules are available when developing DFT methods. Although these atomization energies or cohesive energies for solids or molecules do not exactly correspond to the formation enthalpies and dissociation energies listed in Table III, making a comparison is still informative. Below, we may as well list the MAEs and MAPEs for atomization energies or cohesive energies of various types of solids or molecules from similar or different PBE or optB88-vdW calculations in the literature. These MAEs (\u0394E\u2217MAE and \u0394EMAE) and MAPEs (\u03b4EMAE) with corresponding s and u0.95 values are regenerated by using the original data in the literature. Note that all \u0394E\u2217MAE values mentioned below always correspond to the atomization or cohesive energies per atom.

            "text": "We have performed the PAW DFT calculations for the geometric structures, formation enthalpies, and dissociation energies of 82 molecules or isomers consisting of C, H, N, and/or O. We use PBE and optB88-vdW functionals typically without and with dispersion corrections, respectively. For a convenient comparison and indexing, all results are tabulated (summarized in Tables I and II) together with the corresponding data from previous experiments and AOBM calculations if available in the literature. Relative to the available experimental values, the AEs and PEs of 42 bond lengths, 15 bond angles, 49 formation enthalpies, and 138 dissociation energies from our DFT calculations are illustrated (plotted in Figs. 1\u20134, respectively). The corresponding MAEs and MAPEs for these DFT values are also obtained (summarized in Table III) and compared with the previous error analyses from similar or different planewave DFT methods for various solids and other molecules.\nAs evaluated in the work, the PAW DFT results for these small molecules is especially informative before calculating various molecular adsorption properties on large-size solid materials often involving the supercells containing hundreds to thousands of atoms, for which using a planewave DFT method is computationally much more efficient than using various existent AOBMs. The data presented in this paper also provide very useful and convenient information for the further development of DFT methods.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSee the supplementary material for formulation of formation enthalpies and dissociation energies and Tables S1\u2013S4 that provide the original data for Figs. 1\u20134, respectively."
