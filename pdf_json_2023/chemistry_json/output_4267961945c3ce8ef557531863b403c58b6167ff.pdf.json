    "abstractText": "New topical antibacterial agents are required to inhibit and development of bacteria and also promoting the wound healing process. This study was evaluating the healing effect of Myristica fragrans extract coated with carboxymethyl cellulose, zinc oxide and graphite carbon nitride (CMC/ ZnO/g\u2010C3N4/MyR) by photocatalytic process on the healing process of full\u2010thickness infectious excision wounds in mice. Nanosheets were prepared and physicochemical properties were evaluated. Safety, in vitro release, antibacterial activities under in vitro and in vivo condition, wound contraction, histopathological properties and the protein expressions of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), collagen 1A (COL1A) and CD31 were also evaluated. Physicochemical properties confirmed their successful synthesis. Nanosheets exhibited antibacterial activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. The formulations containing CMC/ZnO/g\u2010C3N4/MyR, significantly (P < 0.05) competed with standard ointment of mupirocin for accelerating the wound healing process due to their effects on bacterial count and the expression of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and also accelerating the proliferative phase. This structure can be used as a safe structure in combination with other agents for accelerating the wound healing process following future clinical studies.",

Wound infection is due to bacterial pathogens entered into the body through the skin gaps such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii2. The preparation of a clean and moist wound environment that can support the physiological wound healing process is a managerial strategy for wound management3. Broad use of antibiotics results in drug resistance and the production of superbugs bacteria and can cause side effects on the immune system4. New topical antibacterial agents are required to inhibit the further spread and development of complications in fighting bacterial infections5. Medicinal plants have been used for accelerating infected wounds.\nNutmeg (Myristica fragrans) or MyR is a commercial source used as antithrombotic, antitumor, and antiinflammatory5. It is a rich source of bioactive substances with antibacterial and antioxidant activities6. It is known to have the wound healing activities7,8. There are problems in dispersion of plant derivations and also drug delivery. It is essential to coating plant derivations with safe carriers with good water dispersibility such as nanosheets9. In addition, a combination of nanosheets and extracts can have better antimicrobial properties10.\nThe inorganic particles such as ZnO have antibacterial activities, antidiabetic and anticancer activities11. ZnO are economic and safe with optical and excellent thermal and chemical stability12. It is a candidate for the wound healing process due to its biological properties. In addition, a progressive opted strategy is producing hybrid nanostructures of ZnO via its coupling with other fascinating semiconducting materials. This work results in the preparation of structures with maximum biological and mechanical properties13. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a metal-free photocatalyst that has attracted many attentions for the production of heterojunctions in the entire scientific society due to properties such as chemical and thermal stability, faster charge transport, and ability absorbing light14. It can be utilized as a photothermal agent for photothermal therapy15. Zn2+ doping could increase the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, and promote epithelial formation in the wound healing process4. Another agent which can be used for tissue engineering is carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The dressings based on natural polymers have been used for biomedical applications16. It has stability and biocompatibility properties17. It may have synergistic effects with g-C3N4 and Zn2+ for mechanical and biological properties in the treatment of wound.\nIt was hypothesized that CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 can coat MyR and accelerate the wound healing process in the presence of visible light and have synergistic effects for the treatment of infected wounds. This study evaluates the effects of CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR on the treatment of infected wounds by assessing physicochemical properties, antibacterial activity and the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), angiogenesis (CD31) and collagen type 1A (COL1A)."

When these particles absorb photons with higher energy than their banned strips, couples of electrons and cavities are created in the conduction bar and their capacity strips, respectively (Eq.\u00a01).\nHigh-efficiency separation in this couple will allow oxidation and reduction reactions on the particle surface. In these reactions, molecular oxygen commonly works as an electron acceptor and is converted into superoxide anion (O2\u2212\u22c5 which is a strong oxidation agent, in fact e\u2212 in CB (conduction bar) helps to produce superoxide radicals from oxygen molecules (Eq.\u00a02).\nOn the other hand, the cavity with surface hydroxyl group (OH\u2212) with a water molecule (water in the hydrogel or wound bed) absorbed on the surface of the reaction produces a hydroxyl radical (OH\u00b0), which is a strong reducing agent. H + in VB (capacity bar) plays a key role in the production of hydroxyl radicals from H2O molecules or hydroxyl ions18,19 (Eq.\u00a03)\nReactive oxygen species (ROS; HO\u22c5, O2\u2212\u22c5) are a key component in photocatalytic process. On the other hand, the rapid recombination of the produced electron-cavitational, their photocatalytic activity has been accompanied by limitations. To improve the performance of such potential semiconductors, useful solutions have been taken to pair the two semiconductors together and place them on a suitable substrate20,21."

To obtain more g-C3N4 nanosheets, sonication was performed in water and the obtained g-C3N4 had several single layers based on the characteristics of electron-scanning microscopy (Fig.\u00a02B). The g-C3N4 electron microscopy images show free standing nanosheets with a thickness size of 51\u00a0nm. Also, the distribution of C and N elements can be seen in dot mapping next to SEM. The g-C3N4 nanosheets were easily dispersible in water due to the presence of \u2013NH2 and \u2013NH groups which were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it is shown in Fig.\u00a06. Such groups \u2013NH2 and -NH can act as an effective Lewis base for charging metal ions via chelate and have a higher binding affinity to ZnO (Fig.\u00a03) and thus provide potential growth of nanoparticles at g-C3N4 level26. Accordingly, g-C3N4@ZnO a can be synthesized by a facile and simple reduction method in place at room temperature. SEM images (Fig.\u00a03A,B) and histograms of the corresponding size distribution (Fig.\u00a03C) showed that a medium density of dispersed ZnONP with an average size of 23\u00a0nm was precipitated on g-C3N4 surface and no accumulated ZnONP were observed. In addition, ZnONP modification on g-C3N4 surface was confirmed by energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig.\u00a03D). Based on the EDS results obtained from ZnO/g-C3N4 sample, 23.23% carbon, 6.28% nitrogen, 51.26% Zn and 19.23% oxygen were found. Dot mapping results (Fig.\u00a03E) showed a uniform dispersion of elements on the surface of nanosheets. ZnO/g-C3N4 is located on CMC substrate, and SEM images (Fig.\u00a04A) and dot mapping (Fig.\u00a04B) are shown that the proper and uniform distribution of elements (C, N, O, and Zn) in CMC substrate is visible.\nFigure\u00a01.

The peak of the index is 27.58\u00a0\u00b0C to the plate (002) and shows that the conjugated aromatic groups of g-C3N4 layers have appeared with the JCPDS No reference card (87\u20131526)27.

The FTIR spectrum of g-C3N4, CMC, ZnO and CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 sheets is shown in Fig.\u00a06.

Peaks at 1177\u00a0 cm\u22121, 1428\u00a0 cm\u22121, 1545\u00a0 cm\u22121 and 1654\u00a0 cm\u22121 are related to bonds (C-N) and (C=N). In addition, the peak shown in 810\u00a0 cm\u22121 is related to the ES-triazine ring units29. In the CMC peak spectrum appeared at 3600\u201313,400\u00a0 cm\u22121 is associated with the stretch vibrations of aromatic ring hydroxyl groups and the peaks that appeared in 1360\u00a0 cm\u22121 are related to the asymmetric tensile vibrations of methyl (\u2013CH) carboxymethyl cellulose groups. The asymmetric tensile vibration of the COO group closed to 1637\u00a0 cm\u22121 and vibration at 1093\u00a0 cm\u22121 was assigned to C\u2013O tensile vibration. Zn\u2013O extended band was seen in the range of 560\u2013430\u00a0 cm\u2212130. It can be seen that all peaks in the first three spectrums are visible in the fourth peak, indicating the successful synthesis of the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 composite.\nThe chemical composition and oxidation state of the elements were determined by XPS. As shown in Fig.\u00a07, the wide range of XPS, CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 shows that the index peaks are related to C, N, O and Zn. As the XPS C1s spectrum shows in Fig.\u00a07. Four peaks are observed at 284.52\u00a0eV, 285.34\u00a0eV, 286.55\u00a0eV and 287.63\u00a0eV, which are attributed to C\u2013C/C=C, C\u2013N/C\u2013O, C=N/C=O and O=C\u2013O. Spectrum N 1\u00a0s was converted to four peaks at 399.33, 400.66, 401.33 and 401.87\u00a0eV, which is dedicated to Pyridine-N, pyloric-N, graphitic-N and N-Ox31. Typical Zn 2p peaks at 1021.6\u00a0eV and 1044.7\u00a0eV are attributed to Zn 2p1 and Zn 2p3 respectively, which are in agreement with the normal Zn binding energy in ZnO. In addition, the O 1\u00a0s spectrum is characterized by two specific peaks, 229.9\u00a0eV and 351.6\u00a0eV are related to Zn\u2013O and N\u2013C\u2013O, respectively. XPS results showed that nanosheet was successfully constructed without any impurities.\nParticle size and zeta potential values for g-C3N4, ZnO/g-C3N4 and CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 nano sheets are shown in Fig.\u00a08 diagram (Fig.\u00a0S1). Zeta potential plays an important role in the physical stability of particles17. Higher values of zeta potential (positive and negative) indicate its stability for nanoparticles. Zeta potential for g-C3N4 is negative (\u2212\u00a02.3\u00a0mV), and adding ZnO results in value positive (+ 29.1\u00a0mV). Decorating the surface of the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 nano sheets changed the zeta potential from positive to negative (\u2212\u00a023.4\u00a0mV) that is in agreement with previous studies32,33.\nFigure\u00a09A shows the in\u00a0vitro release of free MyR and CMC/ZnO/g-C3N/MyR over 48\u00a0h. Considering that during the wound healing process, the pH of the wound area changes dynamically from pH 4 to pH 8, for growth factor secretion and activation34,35. The underlying wound tissue shows a neutral pH of 7.4. As a result, the release profile of CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 containing MyR at pH 7.4 was investigated. In\u00a0vitro release was significantly higher in free MyR compared to CMC/ZnO/g-C3N/MyR. During the first 4\u00a0h, 63.17% of MyR was released from MyR\n(4)d = k\n\u03b2 cos \u03b8\nFigure\u00a06.

Over time up to 8\u00a0h, the released values were 91.92%, 60.37% of dialysis bags for free MyR, CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/ MyR respectively. The possible reason is the complex polymer matrix network containing CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4, which releases it slowly. Since this matrix is also considerably resistant to degradation, the emission of the extract from the polymer matrix takes a longer time. With the slow release, probably due to the decrease in MyR concentration in healthy tissues and reduction of the toxicity of the extract, the coated form of nutmeg can have equal effects on the free drug in the treatment of infections and wounds, and polymeric coating can be used to control the release of the extract."

The results are in accordance with previous studies for the antibacterial activity of CMC and ZnO40,41. Antibacterial activities of CMC/ZnO could be attributed to their interactions with reactive oxygen species and also the interaction of zinc oxide with bacterial cells wall and intra-cellular content of the cell such as protein, lipid, and carbohydrates which result in disruption of nucleic acids and bacteria death42. The addition of g-C3N4 increased antibacterial activity in nanosheets. The results are in agreement with other studies on the antibacterial activities of g-C3N4/ZnO4. The mechanism of g-C3N4/ZnO is attributed to their effects on disrupting membranes and increasing protein leakage, induction of bacterial apoptosis, and decreasing ATP levels4. The addition of MyR increased antibacterial activities. Major compounds of MyR were including 4-Terpinenyl acetate, \u03b3\u2013Terpinene, isoeugenol, oleic acid, nomifensine and carvacrol which disrupt bacterial membranes43. The results show synergistic effects between compounds for antibacterial activities.

The values for wound contraction were 37.16 \u00b1 0.90%, 51.60 \u00b1 1.30%, 41.28 \u00b1 1.60%, 47.33 \u00b1 1.80% and 60.50 \u00b1 1.90% in control, Mup, CMC/ZnO, CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 and CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/ MyR, respectively on day 7.

There were no significant differences between those treated with CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 and mupirocin on days 7 and 12 (P > 0.05); however, these exhibited lower wound contraction compared with those treated with CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR. Wound contraction was lower in those treated with CMC/ZnO compared with those treated with nanosheets (P < 0.05). The lowest wound contraction was observed in control mice on days 7 and 12. The results are in agreement with other studies for wound healing activities of CMC44, ZnO45, g-C3N44 and MyR8. The results show synergistic effects between compounds for the wound healing process. The wound healing process of nanosheets could be attributed to their effects on bacteria and also the expression of genes. The nanosheets shorten the inflammatory phase and promote the wound healing process, as will be seen.\nFigure\u00a09E illustrates the photocatalytic effects of nanosheets on total bacterial count on different days. The highest total bacterial count was observed in the control mice compared with other mice (P = 0.001). The mice treated with CMC/ZnO showed lower total bacterial count compared with those in control group in all the days (P = 0.001) but the same mice showed higher total bacterial count compared with those treated with mupirocin and other nanosheets on all the days. The addition of g-C3N4 and MyR could decrease total bacterial count and the lowest total bacterial count was seen in the mice treated with CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR on day 3 and 7. The values for total bacterial count were 7.15 \u00b1 0.10\u00a0CFU/g, 5.38 \u00b1 0.14\u00a0CFU/g, 6.50 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0CFU/g, 5.55 \u00b1 0.17\u00a0CFU/g and 5.46 \u00b1 0.15\u00a0CFU/g in control, Mup, CMC/ZnO, CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 and CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR, respectively on day 3.

The decrease in the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and the increase in the expression of collagen promote the wound healing process by the treatment with nanosheets. The results show that nanosheets promote the wound healing process by contracting wound and decreasing the inflammation. In addition, CD31 marker participates in production of vessels (angiogenesis) and helps to supply nutrients for the wound healing process48.

To determine the bonds produced from the FT-IR spectrum (Spectrum Two model of PerkinElmer Company) was used to determine the shape and structure of the nano-hybrids of FE-SEM analysis (FESEM device of ZEISS Company of GermanySigma VP model Equipped with EDS detectors, Mapping, Oxford Instruments UK company). To determine the chemical composition of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB-MKII spectrometer; VG Co., United Kingdom (equipped with X-ray al-K\u03b1 with eV 1486.6 energy and analysis of the results was used using SPD4.1 software considering carbon peak ((1\u00a0s) C) in eV284.2 bond energy. To determine the percentage of MyR concentration at any moment, its adsorption characteristics were used. For this purpose, appropriate concentrations of MyR were prepared in lukewarm water (0.25\u20130.01\u00a0mg/mL) and the sample absorption rate was obtained at 326\u00a0nm (maximum absorption based on the data obtained from the scan by spectrophotometer, model Ultrospec 2000, made in Scinteck, England). Then the calibration curve was plotted and its equation was determined (Y = 0.196x + 0.0635, R2 = 0.99).\nThe release of MyR from the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR was assessed in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) using the dialysis bag (sigma D0530 12000\u00a0k) diffusion technique, in a thermostatically controlled water bath shaker (Memmert, GmbH; Buchenbach, Germany). An amount equivalent to 10\u00a0mg of free MyR and CMC/ZnO/gC3N4/MyR were poured into a dialysis bag, and ends of the bag were closed, and it was immersed in a beaker containing 100\u00a0ml of release medium. The experiments were carried out at a temperature of 37 \u00b1 1.0\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. The samples of 3\u00a0mL from the release medium were collected samples in time intervals and the absorbance was measured using the UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer at 326\u00a0nm. Each withdrawn sample was replaced by an equal volume of the fresh release medium."
