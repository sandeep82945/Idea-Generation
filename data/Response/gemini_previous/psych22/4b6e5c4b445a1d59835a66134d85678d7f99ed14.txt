1. **Investigate the impact of different interaction models on the emergence of collective intelligence.** The current study used a specific interaction model that allowed participants to interact with their four nearest neighbors. Future research could explore how different interaction models, such as those that allow for long-range interactions or those that incorporate social influence, affect the emergence of collective intelligence.


2. **Examine the role of individual differences in the emergence of collective intelligence.** The current study did not consider individual differences among participants. Future research could investigate how factors such as personality traits, cognitive abilities, and motivation influence the emergence of collective intelligence.


3. **Explore the effects of different task types on the emergence of collective intelligence.** The current study used two specific tasks: a moral dilemma and a mathematics test. Future research could investigate how different task types, such as those that require creativity, problem-solving, or decision-making, affect the emergence of collective intelligence.


4. **Investigate the impact of group size on the emergence of collective intelligence.** The current study used a relatively large group size (n = 789). Future research could explore how different group sizes affect the emergence of collective intelligence.


5. **Examine the long-term effects of collective intelligence.** The current study only examined the emergence of collective intelligence in a single experiment. Future research could investigate the long-term effects of collective intelligence, such as how it affects group performance over time or how it influences individual learning and development.
