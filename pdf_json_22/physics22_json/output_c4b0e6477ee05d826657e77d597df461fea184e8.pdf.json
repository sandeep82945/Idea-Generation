    "abstractText": "The current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), comprised of major installations such as the MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and VERITAS telescopes, is sometimes called the 3 generation of such instruments. These telescopes use multipixel cameras composed of hundreds up to thousands photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The supremacy of PMTs is currently being challenged by photon sensors, rapidly spreading in popularity: the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), that are becoming a valid alternative thanks to their high PDE, low operating voltage and flexibility in installation. In this report, we investigate the performance of an existing 3 generation IACT array (taking as a working example MAGIC), in which PMTs would be replaced with SiPMs, applying generalized simulations, not tuned for a specific hardware solution. We find an energy-dependent improvement in sensitivity, reaching a factor of three at the current trigger threshold energy. Interestingly, we also find that the stronger sensitivity of SiPMs in the red part of the spectrum, a source of background for IACTs, does not affect this performance.",

These telescopes use multipixel cameras composed of hundreds up to thousands photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The supremacy of PMTs is currently being challenged by photon sensors, rapidly spreading in popularity: the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), that are becoming a valid alternative thanks to their high PDE, low operating voltage and flexibility in installation. In this report, we investigate the performance of an existing 3rd generation IACT array (taking as a working example MAGIC), in which PMTs would be replaced with SiPMs, applying generalized simulations, not tuned for a specific hardware solution. We find an energy-dependent improvement in sensitivity, reaching a factor of three at the current trigger threshold energy. Interestingly, we also find that the stronger sensitivity of SiPMs in the red part of the spectrum, a source of background for IACTs, does not affect this performance.\nKeywords: IACT, MAGIC, PMT, SiPM"

            "text": "Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) de-\ntect the Cherenkov light radiated in Extensive Atmospheric Showers (EASs) in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at the height of 10-20 km a.s.l [1, 2]. EASs are produced by energetic cosmic rays or gamma rays impinging the Earth. The Cherenkov radiation is peaked in the blue-UV, has a duration of few nanoseconds, and illuminates an area of few tens of thousands square meters at ground level, depending on the energy of the primary particle. The observations can only be performed at moonless nights or nights with moderate moonlight and are made through telescopes with large light collectors. However, in recent times, technical solutions were implemented to operate also with stronger and stronger moon levels, selecting targets at a sufficient angular distance from the Moon [see, e.g., 3, 4]. For concreteness, we base our study on a specific 3rd generation IACT system, the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes, operating since 2003 at the Observatorio Roque de Los Muchachos (ORM) on the island of La Palma. In Sec. 7, we discuss about the applicability of these results for other installations. Each of the two MAGIC telescopes has a 17 m-diameter ( f\u2212number= 1) parabolic reflector, tessellated with about 250 mirror facets [5]. To catch the brief Cherenkov light flashes, the MAGIC telescopes are equipped with two identical cameras, each composed of 1039 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The PMTs are organised in 265 clusters of 7 photodetectors each, assembled in modules that can easily be\nplugged in or out independently from each other. It is therefore possible, to separately remove a module, and replace it with a different one, provided the front- and back-end electronic is compatible. The MAGIC PMTs are Hamamatsu R10408 6- dynodes with an hemispherical bi-alkali cathode of 1\u2032 diameter, operated at a voltage of \u2248 1 kV. Each PMT is equipped with a compound parabolic concentrator adapted from the design of the so-called Winston cone [6, 7], that reduces the dead area between neighbouring PMTs and avoids the stray-light coming from far-off the mirror dish. Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are photosensors composed of microscopic diode cells assembled in matrices of thousands, to reach sizes of few mm across, discussed in more details in Sec. 2. They are currently replacing PMTs where compactness is required and because they operate at low voltage. These devices are advancing rapidly in the field of fast photodetectors. Compared to PMTs, besides their low operating voltage, they provide advantages such high efficiencies, insensitivity to magnetic fields, and robustness against bright ambient light. The compact geometrical size of SiPMs allow to easily arrange them, but makes it complicate to cover large areas such as those of IACT cameras, of the order of two square meter. Other drawbacks compared to Cherenkov applications of PMTs are the optical crosstalk between adjacent cells and the larger sensitivity to red light, as well as a higher dark current. Normally multiple SiPMs must be combined together to match the sensitive area of a PMT, in this case, also the signal summation could provide larger time-spread signal than that of PMTs. Currently, the development and testing of SiPM-based\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier September 20, 2023\nmodules in the MAGIC cameras is ongoing in preparation of a possible camera upgrade for MAGIC or the future Cherenkov Telescope Array [8]. Furthermore, SiPMs are currently already adopted as main photosensors in some telescope designs for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) [9, 10, 11]. This solution is valid especially in the case of a double-optics SchwarzschildCouder design in which a secondary mirror not only counteracts some geometrical aberrations, but also allows for a reduction of the camera occupancy and therefore the size of its pixels [12]. There are also studies to equip single-optics Davies-Cotton or parabolic CTA telescopes with SiPMs, but so far only the technological feasibility is under evaluation [13, 14, 15, 16].\nIt is therefore interesting to evaluate the expected performance of the 3rd-generation IACTs with SiPM-based cameras. However, a complete estimation of the validity of a SiPM-equipped camera for this generation of telescopes is out of the scope of this paper. This would require a) comparing selected replacement of photosensors and electronics to a complete new assembly of the camera b) evaluating in details the grouping of SiPMs into single pixels, c) using specifically developed SiPMs after bidding with companies, as well as several other aspects, not excluding the related cost and scientific opportunity. In this work, we focus on a \u2018minimal hardware change\u2019 scenario, in which we replaced the MAGIC PMT modules with clusters of SiPMs, leaving the rest of the system untouched. This approach allows us to give a valuable input for the expected performance of a new SiPM-based camera.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 2 we discuss the focal-plane photosensors, the current generation PMTs and SiPMs, comparing their performance. In Sec. 3 we review the factors that affect the light yield of the camera, especially considering how the original spectral distribution of the Cherenkov light is modified through the detection by the instrument. In Sec. 4 we compute the light yield for the case of PMTs and SiPMs. We also discuss the possibility to filter out the red part of the spectrum with a dedicated dichroic window in front of the camera. The details of the SiPM camera simulations are presented in Sec. 5. The performance with a SiPM-based camera is discussed in Sec. 6. In Sec. 7 we discuss the technical feasibility of a potential camera upgrade and the accuracy of our results. We summarise and conclude in Sec. 8."

            "text": "SiPMs are grids of Single Photon Avalanche photoDiodes (SPADs) on silicon substrate [17]. Each SPAD is a microscopic independent Avalanche PhotoDiodes (APDs), operated in Geiger-mode, i.e., counting single photons. However, when combining thousands of microcells, the dynamic range of a SiPM can go from a single to thousands of photons for each square millimeter. The SiPM matrix wafer is prepared during the initial production and later wired and assembled. The thickness of the sensor is of the order of one millimeter, making the detector very compact. SiPMs are operated at bias voltage of few tens of volts, carefully set to provide optimal performance in terms of single photon response, linearity, and current noise.\nThe small size also makes SiPMs insensitive to regular ambient magnetic fields.\nIn Fig. 1, we compare the photo detection efficiency (PDE) of one benchmark PMT Hamamatsu R10408 [18], currently installed in MAGIC, the PMTs Hamamatsu R19200 [21], currently installed in the first CTA large-size telescope prototype (LST-1) and two benchmark SiPMs that are under scrutiny for the use in CTA cameras. The SiPMs are a commercial Hamamatsu S133601 [20] and a NUVHD3 sensor by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) [19, 22]. As one can see, the SiPMs have a peak PDE in a part of the spectrum at significantly larger wavelengths than that of the PMTs. They also feature a good efficiency in the red part of the spectrum where PMTs are usually less sensitive.\nIn the following, we take the FBK NUVHD3 photosensor as a case example. This is a precursor of a class of SiPMs under constant development. For example, the CTA small-size telescope prototype [23] mounts version NUVHD6 of this sensor, however with performance not dissimilar to the NUVHD3 considered here [22]. The SiPM development is mostly focused on the reduction of dark noise and optical cross-talk.\nOne significant source of noise for SiPMs is the optical crosstalk generated by secondary photons created during the charge recombination. Such spurious photons may trigger secondary breakdowns in neighboring cells [24]. The effect is a randomized enhancement of the amplitude of the measured signal. This effect can be reduced with specific design geometry\n1Datasheet at https://www.hamamatsu.com/resources/pdf/ssd/s13360_series_kapd1052e.pdf\nsuch as building trenches among neighboring cells [22]. Also the use of light-guides in front of SiPM allows to reduce this effect because spurious photons are not reflected back to the sensor but are free to escape outward [25]. The irreducible optical cross-talk must be modeled during signal reconstruction. However, the SiPMs main drawback with respect to PMTs remains their reduced size, which cannot exceed 1-2 cm2 with current technologies, due to the large capacitance generated by the compact geometry. In case a large sensitive area must be covered (as that of the focal plane of an IACT, of the order of 2 m2), particular solutions must be adopted. These are: a) the positioning of optical funnels, in the form of either hollow or solid concentrator2 at the entrance of the individual SiPMs, that increase the sensitive area by guiding the light to the photosensor surface, e.g. as done by Huber et al. [26], Aguilar et al. [27] or b) the combination of a number of photosensors into one larger pixel via summation, possibly also combined with a light funnel [13, 28], to avoid a too large number of channels.\nAn example of a telescope using solid-state photosensors is that of the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) [29]. The FACT telescope is a single-dish 4 m-diameter telescope located at the MAGIC site, built upgrading a decommissioned HEGRA telescope and successfully operative for about a decade. FACT has successfully operated for several years a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode camera described by Biland et al. [29]. G-APD photosensors allows FACT to routinely operate even under strong moon level [30] allowing for a duty cycle increase of 30% [31]. MAGIC is currently hosting four SiPM clusters at the edges of the camera. They are only test installations not used for regular data analysis. One of the clusters hosts seven and the other nine 6\u00d7 6 mm2 photosensors per pixel. These are read out with the standard MAGIC data acquisition system [13,"

There are several effects that affect the spectrum hitting the camera pixels: first, the Cherenkov spectrum at ground, that may non trivially change in function of the intrinsic energy of the primary particle, the particle type, and the altitude above the horizon (or the zenith angle ZA or zenith distance ZD). In principle, different atmospheric conditions can affect as well the Cherenkov light extinction in a wavelength-dependent way. This effect is less general to model and it is less severe. Other factors are the reflectivity of the mirror facets, the transmissivity of the eventual\n2The classical shape of such funnel is the compound parabolic concentrator\ndescribed in [6, 7]\nentrance window (in the case of MAGIC made of a plexiglass sheet, see later), and the spectral properties of the light concentrators. All these factors contribute to shaping the wavelengthdependent light yield at an IACT camera."

            "text": "The Cherenkov spectra at ground studied for this work are obtained from dedicated Monte Carlo simulations. These are based on a customised version of the publicly available software for simulations of air showers, dubbed Corsika (COsmic Ray SImulations for KASCADE), which is used within the MAGIC collaboration [32]. To model the light extinction in the atmosphere, we used an atmospheric model specifically produced for the sky at the ORM [33]. We simulated 180,000 gamma ray events and 60,000 proton events in total, at different impact parameters to simulate a realistic condition. To evaluate the effect of the sky position and primary energy on the impinging Cherenkov spectrum, we considered three incident angles (5, 45, 65\u00b0) and three energies for gamma rays: 60, 400, 1500 GeV and an energy of 180 GeV for protons3. This corresponds to 20,000 simulated events per set.\nAt the emission point, the Cherenkov yield is generated with a \u03bb\u22122 spectrum [34]. This spectrum is attenuated with strong chromaticity by the atmosphere molecular content. At short wavelengths, ozone plays the major role. At longer wavelengths, Rayleigh scattering with Nitrogen and Oxygen becomes the strongest attenuating agent. IACTs are typically located in very clean and dry atmospheric environments, whereas the conditions are practically those of free troposphere, with the aerosol content playing a significant role only in non-optimal atmospheric conditions [35].\nFig. 2 shows the simulated Cherenkov spectra at the focal plane for primary gamma rays and protons at different energies and zenith angles. The spectrum is in arbitrary units and consider only the atmospheric absorption. No other wavelengthdependent effects, e.g. the mirror reflectivity, are considered. The curves are obtained by summing over all the events in a batch that give a detectable number of photons. This varies significantly event by event even with the same settings, due to the stochasticity of the EAS development and the simulation. For each spectrum, the peak position is identified as the average of the three highest points of the curve4. The peak positions are reported in Table 1.\nFrom Fig. 2 one can see that with increasing incident angle of the primary particle, the absolute photon yield from EASs decreases significantly. This is due to the increased air mass\n3Considering protons produce copious pions in hadronic interactions, electromagnetic subshowers are initiated by a charged particle with roughly one third of the primary proton energy, hence the factor of three in energy in comparison between primary gamma rays and protons 4For this reason, the statistical uncertainty on the peak position cannot be computed. Instead, the sample was split into two subsets to check the reproducibility of the peak position. For simulations at 5 and 45 deg zenith angle we found no difference. Only in the case of simulations with a zenith angle of 65 deg, the peak position was shifted by a few nm, probably due to the flatter maximum in the spectra.\nthe Cherenkov light travels through before reaching the ground, which results in higher extinction. A second effect is that the position of the maximum of the Cherenkov spectrum moves to longer wavelengths (redshift) with increasing incident angle of the gamma ray. This is due to the differential extinction of the atmosphere at different wavelengths (Rayleigh scattering). The maximum becomes significantly redshifted with increasing incident angle, up to 20% between 5\u25e6 and 65\u25e6, but almost independently of the energy of the gamma ray. This behavior is especially interesting in the context of observation at large zenith angles (above 75\u25e6) which are currently being carried out in the field [see, e.g. 36]. The insignificant energy dependence of the Cherenkov peak allows us to neglect any energy-dependent effect for the computation of the photon yield in the remainder of this work. We will revisit the energy dependence during the examination of the interplay with the night sky background (Sec. 3.2) and the overall instrument sensitivity (Sec. 6).\nIt is also interesting to compare the Cherenkov spectrum emitted by electromagnetic showers and hadronic (sub)showers. In Fig. 2 (rightmost column) we report the Cherenkov spectra from electromagnetic subshowers generated by 180 GeV protons. The trend of the maximum Cherenkov radiation shifting to longer wavelengths and decreasing with increasing inclina-\ntion of the primary particle shows the same regularity between gamma ray and proton induced atmospheric showers."

There are two major differences between the NSB and Cherenkov spectrum: a) the NSB increases with the wavelength and is concentrated at the red and infrared part of the spectrum, and b) the NSB shows several very prominent peaks over the steadily increasing background. This is directly related to the emission spectrum of the air-glow. In reality, this is an average picture, as discussed above.\nHaving the pixels of an IACT camera hit by spurious photons creates two problems: a) fake triggers up to saturation of the data acquisition system and b) noise within the signal with a consequent deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We have already discussed that SiPMs are more sensitive than PMTs in the red part of the spectrum (see Fig. 1). It will be therefore important to weigh this effect properly."

We pay special attention to the camera entrance protection window (see Sec. 3.3.1), whose wavelength-dependent transmission can provide a costeffective way to improve the performance of a SiPM-based camera, as we will see later.\nMirrors. The mirrors of the MAGIC telescopes (see [5, 38, 39] have a specific spectral reflectivity, that depends on the material used for the mirror surface. Their reflectance is achieved by an aluminium alloy, varying between different mirror designs, coated with a protective quartz layer. The thickness of this layer affects the position of the maximum spectral reflectivity. Fig. 4 shows the spectral reflectivity of a typical MAGIC mirror [40].\nLight funnels.

We limit our considerations to the case of a primary gamma ray of 1500 GeV, having shown that the amount of Cherenkov light at the ground simply scales linearly with primary energy, but the spectrum is not changed (see Sec. 4). The wavelength-independent effects of the camera window and the light guides are also here excluded. Already a quick inspection of the figures shows that the use of a SiPM strongly increases the signal in the blue part of the spectrum, allowing to gather more Cherenkov photons, but also makes the instrument more sensitive in the red part above 500 nm. A more quantitative comparison of Fig. 5 is made in Table 2 (first rows, column \u201dSiPM / PMT\u201d) in which we report the fractional increase of the integrals of the spectra displayed in Fig. 5 for the SiPM and PMT case6. In all cases, the SiPM provides a significant boost in light yield with respect to the PMT: the total photon yield increases from a factor 2.2 to 2.5 going from 5 to 65\u00b0 incident angle of the primary particle. This increase with the incident angle is due to the redshift of the maximum of the Cherenkov spectrum as the Rayleigh absorption increases (see Sec. 3.1).\nThe detection efficiency of the Cherenkov signal is not the only factor influencing the sensitivity of an IACT, because of the interplay with the NSB (Sec. 3.2). The effect of SiPM and PMT on the NSB light yield is also shown in Fig. 5 (right). A visual inspection clearly shows that the behavior in the case of PMTs and SiPMs is rather different: while in the former case, above 650 nm, the NSB does not contribute significantly to the background light level of each camera pixel, instead in the SiPM case, it does. Second, the contribution of spectral\n6For reasons already expressed in Sec. 3.1, we cannot compute the statistical\nuncertainties of these values.\npeaks present in the NSB changes in the two cases: in the PMT case mostly the 557.7 nm peak is detected, while in the SiPM case, many other significant peaks of the NSB contribute to the background level in the camera pixels. Looking again at Table 2 (bottom row, column \u201dSiPM / PMT\u201d), we quantify the increased number of photons with a factor of 5.3 when using SiPMs instead of PMTs. These results are in line with those reported in [8].\nWe asked ourselves whether such an additional \u201dred\u201d contribution could be avoided. This is in principle achievable in different ways: a) it is possible to realize a primary mirror with dichroic properties. For example Fo\u0308rster et al. [43] demonstrated that multilayer dielectric mirrors could achieve this goal. We discarded this option for MAGIC, as replacing the entire reflectors is hardly feasible cost-wise b) another possibility is that of replacing the camera window (see Sec. 3.3.1) with a dichroic plexiglass cutting the light above a certain wavelength. This is the topic of the next Sec. 4.2, c) finally, in principle one could also operate at the photon detector context and e.g. reduce the efficiency or the transmittance in the red part by special coatings7. This technical solution is not investigated here further. All in all, the effect of the three solutions would be similar: the light yield in the red part would be reduced. The anticipated impact of such solutions on the fraction increase of photons is reported in Table 2, column \u201dSiPM+w / PMT\u201d. One can see how such filtering effect has a moderate impact on the Cherenkov light yield, but a stronger one on the NSB, with relative weights similar as in the case of PMTs."

Such a possibility may be offered, e.g., by substituting the neutral plexiglass window (Sec. 3.3.1) with a dichroic camera window that would filter the dominant red part of the NSB spectrum by reflection or absorption. The modification of the entrance of the camera of IACTs is not a novelty in the field. It is used routinely in MAGIC during strong moonlight observations where a second protective camera window is mounted in front of the existing one [3]. A similar solution was developed in VERITAS [4]. We will discuss the technical feasibility of this solution in Sec. 7. Here we show how to optimize the cut-off wavelength \u03bbcut.\nTo evaluate if the effect of the increased NSB level detected with SiPMs can be mitigated with a filter, we have performed a dedicated study taking into account the wavelengthdependent reflectivity of the MAGIC mirrors and the PDE of the NUVHD3 SiPM. We compare the amount of the predicted Cherenkov light from a gamma-induced air shower with the expected noise in the camera pixels from the NSB assuming that\n7To our knowledge, this was not tested.

The background component in the denominator is taken as a square root: due to AC coupling of the photodetectors they are only sensitive to the fluctuations of the light yield rather than its absolute level. We normalise SNR(\u03bbcut) to the SNR(\u03bb) without a filter, i.e., extending upper bound of the integral in Eq. 1 to \u03bb = 900 nm. The relative SNR is therefore SNR(\u03bbcut)/SNR(900 nm) (see Fig. 6).\nFig. 6 shows that the filter improves the relative SNR if \u03bbcut is at around 550 nm. The improvement is of about 40% for zenith angles of 5\u25e6. In case the observations are performed at a larger zenith angle, the gain in the relative SNR is lower, but still of order 30%.\nIt is also interesting to note that the relative SNR pattern is similar also for protons of 180 GeV, which is in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2. We display the light yield with the dichroic window as a dashed-blue line in Fig. 5. We also show in Table 2 the relative gain regarding the photon yield considering such a technical solution. We see how the NSB now still increases with respect to the PMT case but from a factor of 5.30 to a factor of 1.66 with the modified camera window, while still keeping an increase of detected Cherenkov photons\nranging from a factor of 1.76 to 1.84 depending on the incident angle of the primary gamma ray, as reported in Table 2.\nWe remark that the above results cannot be directly used to estimate an increase in instrument sensitivity: the total photon yield is not a proxy for the overall instrument performance. It is now mandatory to estimate the variation in sensitivity through dedicated Monte Carlo simulations, which we do in the next section."

            "text": "Simulation of SiPM. To fully compute the sensitivity with a SiPM camera,in addition to the different PDE, we also tuned the pulse shape, the shape of the single photo-electron (phe)8 distribution and trigger thresholds. The early SiPM devices suffered from very broad pulses (see e.g. [44]), the modern devices however have much narrower pulses (FWHM of 4.3 ns as reported in [22]). Even narrower 2\u20133 ns signals could be achieved, despite summation of signals from multiple individual SiPM devices [45]. In our simulations we assume a 3 ns FWHM of a single phe pulse. With the additional assumed spread of individual phes, the effective pulse shape is 3.5 ns.\nSecond, we also adjusted the response of the photodetector to a single registered phe. A PMT device has a rather broad distribution of a single phe charge. Moreover, during the multiplication of charge inside PMT, an atom might be ionized and accelerated against the flow of electrons. Such an ion hitting the photocatode produces afterpulses: large signals equivalent to even few tens of phes [46]. Due to their time delay, PMT afterpulses are not relevant for Cherenkov radiation. However, the afterpulses induced by NSB photons can mimic signals from small showers, limiting the performance of an IACT trigger. In contrast to this, the response of SiPM to light is completely different. While there are also delayed signals in SiPMs after a registered phe, they can be considered as pulses originating from not fully recovered cells. This makes their amplitudes smaller than a single phe [20], which, combined with their relatively rare occurrence, makes them negligible effect for the SiPM performance in IACT applications.\nSiPMs have a single-phe resolution, i.e. the distribution of single phe amplitude is intrinsically narrow and clearly distinguishable from that of multiple phes. However, the effect of optical cross-talk introduces signal confusion. The probability of cross-talk depends on the SiPM device and its operation parameters. For example Nepomuk Otte et al. [20] obtained values of 6% \u2013 20%. Multiple such signals can stack up, producing (with decreasing probability) multi-phe signals. This effect can affect both the Cherenkov light and NSB or dark rate induced phes. The difference of the single phe distribution for PMT and SiPM is therefore an important effect to consider. To take this into account, we produced a general single phe distribution representative of a SiPM, assuming a \u01eb = 15% optical cross-talk. We use the formula of Gentile et al. [47], simplified to the case of a single true phe. The obtaining probability distribution of registered number n of phes is:\nP(n) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u00d7 \u01ebn\u22121. (2)\n8For simplicity we will also refer to the signal of a single triggered SiPM\ncell, as a \u201cphotoelectron\u201d, nomenclature commonly used for PMT signals.\nFurthermore we assume that each phe has an intrinsic amplitude spread of 10%9. Therefore, the amplitude of a n-phe signal is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation equal to \u221a n \u00d7 10% of its mean.\nTuning of Monte Carlo simulations and analysis. The application of modified pulse width and single phe distribution for SiPM simulations requires additional changes in how those simulations are processed with respect to PMT camera simulations. In order to integrate a similar fraction of the light pulse, in the case of SiPM we increase the size of the pulse integration window from 5 to 7 time slices. For the calibration of SiPM MC simulations we use the excess noise factor method, the same as for PMT cameras. For the simulated \u01eb = 15% case, the excessnoise factor (F2 = 1.16) is comparable to the PMT one of 1.23.\nWhen a different photosensor is considered, as the SiPM considered in this work, the higher NSB level can affect the observations in two ways: increased trigger threshold (expressed in phes) and higher noise in the images that could additionally require higher image cleaning10 thresholds. An Alternate Current (AC) coupling of the MAGIC camera pixels signals is installed to prevent the mean level of the NSB to affect the observations directly. Therefore the noise effect is only related to fluctuations of the NSB, which increases only as the square root of the total increase of the NSB, see also Sec. 4.2. The higher level of the NSB fluctuations might require an increase of the trigger thresholds to allow operations with a manageable rate of accidental events. However, this effect is also tangled with the difference of the single phe distribution caused by PMT afterpulses and SiPM optical cross-talk as well as with the enlarged pulse integration window. Therefore we performed a MC study to derive the expected trigger thresholds for a SiPM camera (see Appendix A for details). Using a MC study, we obtained that a SiPM camera will require a factor of about 1.7 and 1.2 higher thresholds without and with a dichroic window, respectively, to achieve the same level of accidental triggers as for the PMT camera.\nThe effect of the increased noise in the images is automatically taken into account, as we simulate the SiPM camera with a higher average rate of NSB phe per pixel. Nevertheless, if the noise in the images is highly increased, the image cleaning procedure might need to be revised, in particular the values of the cleaning thresholds need to be increased. We optimize the cleaning thresholds based on noise-only events (see Appendix A.2 for details). Intriguingly, due to the interplay of different effects, the optimal cleaning thresholds for the case of SiPM camera without the filters turn out the same as for PMT camera. With addition of the filters the cleaning thresholds can be considerably lowered by a factor of 1.5.\nIt is curious that the effect on the trigger thresholds and on the cleaning thresholds during the analysis is different. We note\n9The precise value of such a spread will depend on a specific hardware solution for amplification and registering the SiPM signals. We note however, that the number is expected to be small, and therefore its effect is expected to be negligible with respect to the optical cross-talk. 10The image cleaning is the reconstruction procedure in which image pixels in the camera are selected by their signal level and their geometry.\nhowever a number of differences between those two stages. The MAGIC trigger operates on amplitudes, while the charge extraction used in further analysis exploits pulse integration. The two approaches are not equivalent when time spread of individual phes is present. Moreover, the stereoscopic trigger is based on a 2\u00d73NN (next-neighbour) condition with each pixel having a signal above a given threshold. In contrast, the image cleaning in each telescope is searching for 2NN, 3NN or 4NN combinations with a sum of clipped signals above a given total threshold, applying also different time constraints than a trigger (see [48] for details). Therefore, the interplay of higher NSB rate with single phe distribution with a smaller tails can have a non trivial, and different effect on both.\nTo evaluate the irreducible background by cosmic rays, we simulate the response of the telescopes to proton, helium and electron induced showers. In total, we have simulated 5 M gamma rays, 25 M electrons, 125 M helium 125 M protons between 0\u25e6 and 35\u25e6 and 5 M gamma rays, 25 M electrons, 125 M helium 200 M protons between 35\u25e6 and 50\u25e6. We normalise the cosmic-ray proton spectrum to the DAMPE measurement [49]. To take into account the effect of helium and higher elements, we apply the same approach as in [50]. Namely, we normalise the helium to 1.6 \u00d7 50% = 80% of the proton flux, where the 1.6 factor is the factor derived by Aleksic\u0301 et al. [50] to correct for elements higher then helium. The electron simulations are weighted to the parametrised combination of the Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. all-electron spectrum applying the model of Eq. 2 from Ohishi et al. [51]. The gamma-ray simulations are normalised to the Crab Nebula spectrum following [48].\nThe MC simulations are analysed using the MARS software11 [52, 48]. The MARS software allows to estimate the nature of the primary particle thanks to a classifier called hadronness which is close to 1 for hadrons and 0 for gamma-ray primaries. Further parameters computed by MARS are the estimated energy (derived by using the Random Forest method), as well as the reconstructed event direction in the sky. A proxy for this latter parameter is dubbed \u03b82, i.e. the squared angular distance between the nominal and reconstructed source direction."

To investigate the improvement at the energy threshold of MAGIC, where the largest effect of the NSB on the event triggering and reconstruction is expected to occur, we have investigated the variation in the collection area. The results are shown in Fig. 7. At the trigger level (see the top panel), the higher PDE, despite the increase of the thresholds results in an increase of the effective area at the lowest energies. For example at 50 GeV the collection area is improved by a factor of 2 comparable to that of the PMT camera. Moreover, the reduction of noise and thus also the trigger thresholds with the use of filters allows for a further increase of the collection area at the lowest energies accessible\n11MARS stands for MAGIC Analysis and Reconstruction Software and is a\nproprietary pipeline of the MAGIC Collaboration.\nwith MAGIC. At 50 GeV the improvement of filters is a factor \u223c 40%, resulting in a total improvement of nearly a factor of 3 with respect to the PMT camera. We also investigate the collection area at the reconstruction level, namely when both images survive the image cleaning with a minimal size. In the case of the PMT camera in the reconstruction, we applied a cut of 50 phe, commonly used in the MAGIC analysis. For the SiPM camera, we upscaled this value by 2.2 (without) or 1.7 (with filter), see Table 2. The improvement of the collection area at the reconstruction stage is comparable to the one at the trigger stage.\nAngular Resolution with a SiPM-based camera. A preciser shower reconstruction represents a second possibility by which the improvement of the \u201dcleaningness\u201d of the images may possibly enhance the gamma/hadron separation. To study this, we compute the energy-dependent angular resolution for the three simulated camera cases (see Fig. 8). We apply cuts in minimal image size as done in the effective-area study. While the SiPM camera has somewhat worse angular resolution as the PMT one above 200 GeV, below 100 GeV the angular resolution is slightly improved. There is very little difference in the angular resolution with or without using filters. This shows that, except of the lowest energies, the reconstruction of the shower direction is still not strongly limited by the amount of light received by the telescopes, or the \u201dcleaningness\u201d of the image, but by other factors (such as geomagnetic field deflection of the shower, optical PSF of the instrument, pixelisation of the camera, . . . ). In fact, the increased collection area of the SiPM camera adds dim images with strong intrinsic fluctuations that are likely less precisely reconstructed, affecting slightly the overall performance.\nSensitivity with a SiPM-based camera. To evaluate the sensitivity, we analyse the data in bins of estimated energy. As for the previous studies of the parameters that govern the instrument performance, we apply a cut in minimal image size with a value scaled to the expected light yield for the SiPM camera. In each such bin we optimize the hadronness and \u03b82 cuts to obtain the best differential sensitivity. We scan the values with cut efficiencies from 60% to 99% for hadronness and from 40% to 95% for \u03b82. The rate of gamma-ray events is computed directly for a given \u03b82 cut. However, to improve the statistics for events that contribute to a diffuse background we consider events reconstructed up to 1\u25e6 away from the camera centre, and scale the obtained rate to the much smaller background expected at the solid angle corresponding to the \u03b82 value-cut. In this scaling we also correct for the drop of the efficiency with the distance from the camera centre by using a fit with a Gaussian function. The sensitivity is defined as the minimal detectable flux that satisfies three conditions: a 5\u03c3 significance (computed according to Eq. 17 from [53] assuming three background control regions), an event excess of at least 10 events and above 5% of the residual background. To use the available statistics of background events in an optimal way, without introducing bias and overtraining the cuts, we divide the individual samples of simulated particles into Ns = 4 subsamples. In the analysis of\neach subsample, we use Ns \u2212 1 remaining subsamples to obtain the optimal cuts, that are then applied to the original subsample. All subsamples (processed with the above-described procedure with different cuts) are then stacked together for the final result.\nThe expected rates for the simulated SiPM camera with and without filters are shown in Fig. 9. As expected, the residual background is dominated by protons, with an additional contribution of electrons in the energy range of a few hundred GeV. At energies below 100 GeV the ratio of the gamma-tobackground rate is improved when using a SiPM camera. The combined effect of the application of filters and re-optimised cleaning thresholds does not change the rates in a qualitative way.\nThe obtained sensitivities are compared in Fig. 10. The improvement of the SiPM camera is clearly seen in the energy range . 200 GeV for low zenith angles and . 1000 GeV for medium zenith angles. For the low zenith-angle case, the improvement is a factor of three at 50 GeV (i.e., close to the threshold). At the same energy the low-pass filter in front of a SiPM camera gives an additional small boost of 20% in the sensitivity. However at higher energies the difference in sensi-\ntivity by using filters is smaller, and for the energies \u223c 1 TeV the obtained sensitivity is actually worse. The result that a lowpass filter has rather small effect on improving the sensitivity is in line with the previous performance study regarding different light illumination levels [54] showing that moonlight which increases the NSB even by a factor of 5 has negligible (. 5\u221210%) impact on the sensitivity in most of the energy range accessible with MAGIC. In the simulated case of a SiPM camera with and without filters, the application of filters reduces the NSB level by a factor of 3.1 (see Table 2), but at the additional price of loosing 20% loss the light from the air shower.\nStronger improvement for the medium zenith observations can be caused by the shift of the observed Cherenkov spectrum towards red wavelengths caused by the atmospheric absorption. The jump in the reported SiPM camera without filters, midzenith sensitivity for a 5 TeV point is an artifact caused by low background statistics."

            "text": "In Sec. 6 we have seen how the use of SiPMs instead of PMTs may provide a sensitivity boost, which according to our generalized simulations, can amount even to about factor of three at about 50 GeV, regardless the higher sensitivity of SiPMs to the NSB. In this section we discuss the reasons for considering an upgrade of 3rd generation IACT cameras to SiPMs, as well as the problems related to the technical implementation.\nAbout a factual implementation of a SiPM-based camera, we start by recalling that our results are not based on a fullscale design and simulation of the camera, and thus this is just a preliminary orientating work. To accurately address the performance change with a fully SiPM-based camera, one should in detail define the actual SiPM to be used, the SiPM summation electronics, at least. In the generalized SiPM simulations that we applied in this work we limited to taking care of those effects at the level expected from the available devices. Therefore we may claim our results conservatively as follows: at low energies SiPMs would provide an improved performance.\nRegarding the addition of a modified plexiglass window, with dichroic properties, we also mention that, although it looks like the improvement of the performance of such a window is not very high. The biggest improvement is expected in terms of collection area, at the lowest energies, however due to simultaneous increase of background rate it does not affect sensitivity much (note that at the lowest energies the sensitivity is limited by the signal-to-background systematic condition, which means that the sensitivity scales with the background to excess rather than square root of background to excess). Such a gain in the collection area can be considered a benefit in case of some scientific targets, e.g.: observations of pulsars (where signal-to-background condition does not apply), or very short transients. Nevertheless, it seems that the additional effort, cost and complexity of installing wavelength filters is not justified performance-wise. On the other hand such filters also do not\nsignificantly degrade the performance, thus can be considered a viable solution if the particular hardware implementation could be problematic e.g. due to pile-up of copious NSB photons. Therefore, we have contacted two companies about the technical feasibility of a dichroic window that cuts wavelengths above 550 nm. It is a substantial technological effort but we understood it is affordable. While obtaining an optimal cut (> 95% transmission below 550 nm and < 5% transmission above 550 nm) is obtained through the deposition of a series of dichroic layers, more complex is the substrate choice. The technology of shaping the light transmission through transparent materials is very advanced nowadays and achieved through repeated deposition of coating layers whose global interference pattern allows to create a dichroicity figure customizable to the percent level12. The layer deposition process is normally achievable on small surfaces at custom level or large surfaces at industrial level. Possibly arrangements in tiles can be considered, such as that used in MAGIC or VERITAS for special observation modes [55]. Glass layers, that would be the best substrate, would be too heavy and fragile, considering that the camera is subject to repentine acceleration. Plexiglass or similar materials are lighter and more flexible, however they suffer ageing from UV light, which is used in the dielectric layers deposition. Also, the deposition of homogeneous layers over a wide area is technologically a challenge, albeit possible for some companies. More easily obtained is a camera composed of few large tiles of dichroic pads held together by a thin frame.\nAlthough we cannot support this claim without a full simu-\nlation, we are of the opinion that our results obtained for MAGIC are roughly valid also for the other two 3rd generation IACTs currently operating: H.E.S.S. and VERITAS. The boost in sensitivity at low energies would generally improve the prospects of detection for targets in which the low-energy signal is more relevant, however, it might not be sufficient to argue for a full camera upgrade for H.E.S.S. and VERITAS before the advent of CTA. However, we argue that for MAGIC it could be a viable opportunity. MAGIC was designed and constructed to be the lowest energy-threshold instrument of its kind [56]. The reason is that MAGIC has a vantage outlook to the Northern extragalactic sky, where a broadband multiwavelength coverage is facilitated. The gamma-ray signal from distant extragalactic sources suffers strong absorption in the Extragalactic Background Light fields with increasing energy if the gamma-ray, hence the need for lowest possible energy thresholds. There is a second reason why an upgrade of the camera of MAGIC could be considered. The MAGIC telescopes are located very close to where the fist telescope of the Cherenkov Telescope Array North (CTA-N) is built, the LST1 telescope [57]. Additional three LST telescopes are currently under construction. LSTs are 23-m class telescopes with similar parabolic shape as the MAGIC telescopes, but with twice larger surface area that allows sampling the fainter signals of lower-energy events. Currently, LST1 is operating both as a standalone instrument and in joint observation with MAGIC, mostly because the commis-\n12For a fixed incident direction.\nsioning of IACTs is facilitated in stereoscopic mode, because a shower location is better triangulated, but also because the joint observation allows for an improvement of about 50% in\nthe LST1 performance [58]. An improvement of the MAGIC sensitivity at the lowest energies would go into the direction of matching MAGIC\u2019s performance towards LST-1. We remark\nhowever that there are no plans for the long term of MAGIC telescopes being part of the CTA-N array, so this solution could prove only temporary."

            "text": "In this work we have discussed the possible upgrade of a current-generation IACT camera from PMTs to SiPMs (Sec. 2).\n1. We have found that the spectral Cherenkov photons dis-\ntribution in Table 1 and Fig. 2 at ground depends little on the energy and more on the zenith angle (except for the total yield) and this is a measurable effect when folded with the instrument spectral yield (see Sec. 4);\n2. There are several factors that affect the IACT acceptance\nto different frequencies of the Cherenkov signal, as well as to the background and the NSB (see Sec. 3). Most of these have approximately a \u2019gray\u2019 (wavelength independent) response (see Fig. 4), such as the mirror reflectivity, the plexiglass window protecting the camera and the light funnels on top of the photosensors. The stronger wavelength-dependent response comes from the PDE of the photosensors. We have shown exemplary PDEs of PMTs and SiPMs showing that the typical sensitivity of SiPMs to red photons is higher w.r.t. that of PMTs (see Fig. 1)\n3. We have found that by replacing PMTs with SiPMs in\nthe camera and comparing the light yield, we have found that SiPMs would allow for a factor 2.2 to 2.5 higher signal (Table 2) regardless the energy of the primary. This strong signal boost is also accompanied by an even stronger factor of 5.3 of more light from the NSB (Fig. 5) that requires higher suppression of the NSB both at the trigger and analysis level (optimised trigger and cleaning thresholds).\n4. We have investigated the performance gain through end-\nto-end Monte Carlo simulations and found that a SiPMbased camera would grant a factor of about three higher sensitivity at 50 GeV (for low zenith-angle observations), with decreasing improvement for higher energies (Fig. 10). This is due to the fact that the higher-energy showers are optimally reconstructed even with a less sensitive photosensor. At medium zenith angles some improvement is seen up to 1 TeV energies.\n5. We have investigated the possibility of reducing the sen-\nsitivity to the red part of the spectrum, specially intense in the NSB. We have found that by replacing the plexiglass with a dichroic window, we could still gain a factor \u223c 1.8 more signal from the showers and only a factor of 1.7 more light from the NSB. However, this solution only moderately improves the sensitivity with respect to a neutral plexiglass in combination with a SiPM camera (Fig. 10). This is because the sensitivity of MAGIC is only affected at very high NSB level.\n6. The simulations show that a SiPM camera will also dis-\nplay slightly better at low energies, angular resolution (Fig. 8), however at higher energies the effect is inverted.\n7. Additionally (especially if equipped with filters) the SiPM\ncamera will provide a better effective area at low energies (Fig. 7).\n8. We have discussed the technical implementation of such\ncameras in Sec. 7, finding that our estimates could be quite accurate or, in worst case, conservative.\nReplacing the PMTs of the MAGIC cameras with SiPMs would be a costly intervention, but it could be a valid investment for MAGIC in prolonging its scientific competitiveness and in connection to CTA.\nAcknowledgments..

For each of them we simulated the response of the telescopes to the NSB within a 160 ns window, and computed number of events producing a single telescope trigger in such a time window. We convert the fraction of triggers ft into accidental rate ra as ra = ft/(160 ns) and plot it in Fig. A.11. A similar accidental rate of a SiPM camera without filters requires increase of the thresholds by \u223c 70%, while with the addition of filters by only \u223c 12%."

            "text": "This study is using the standard MARS cleaning, the socalled Sum cleaning with different time and charge thresholds for 2NN (next-neighbour), 3NN and 4NN combinations [48]. The individual NN charge thresholds are normalized to a common cleaning level expressed in phe. With a different level of noise the optimal cleaning level for the analysis might be also affected. To test this we generated and calibrated 20 000 events without Cherenkov photons, with only NSB and electronic noise. Next we applied different cleaning levels, for each of them checking the fraction of events surviving the cleaning. Such a fraction can be interpreted as the maximum fraction of shower events affected by an artificial islands in their image solely due to NSB fluctuations, and thus should be kept low. In the case of PMT simulations the cleaning normalization level of 6 phe results in \u223c 5% of empty events surviving the cleaning. Fig. A.12 reports the results for SiPM camera without and\nwith the filters. The optimal cleaning level for the SiPM camera is similar to the one of PMT camera. With the addition of the wavelength filters instead a factor of 1.5 lower cleaning threshold can be achieved."
