 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study following a cohort of children from a young age through adolescence to adulthood, assessing their oral health status, dental care utilization, and socioeconomic factors over time. This could provide insights into how inequalities in dental care develop and persist across the life course. 

2. Evaluate the impact of expanding public dental coverage to additional vulnerable groups (e.g. pregnant women, elderly, disabled) in Spain on reducing catastrophic dental expenditures and improving access to care. This could help determine the cost-effectiveness of potential policy changes.

3. Examine the relationship between untreated dental issues and non-dental health outcomes like cardiovascular disease, diabetes complications, and COVID-19 severity. Further establishing these associations could strengthen the case for more comprehensive dental coverage. 

4. Develop and test school-based interventions aimed at promoting oral health literacy and behaviors among socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Successful programs could then be scaled up.

5. Conduct qualitative research to understand patient perspectives on barriers to accessing dental care. This could identify actionable targets for interventions to improve access and reduce inequities.
