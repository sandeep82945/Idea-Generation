    "abstractText": "Pelargonium quercetorum is a medicinal plant traditionally used for treating intestinal worms. In the present study, the chemical composition and bio-pharmacological properties of P. quercetorum extracts were investigated. Enzyme inhibition and scavenging/reducing properties of water, methanol, and ethyl acetate extracts were assayed. The extracts were also studied in an ex vivo experimental model of colon inflammation, and in this context the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) were assayed. Additionally, in colon cancer HCT116 cells, the gene expression of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M (melastatin) member 8 (TRPM8), possibly involved in colon carcinogenesis, was conducted as well. The extracts showed a different qualitative and quantitative content of phytochemicals, with water and methanol extracts being richer in total phenols and flavonoids, among which are flavonol glycosides and hydroxycinnamic acids. This could explain, at least in part, the higher antioxidant effects shown by methanol and water extracts, compared with ethyl acetate extract. By contrast, the ethyl acetate was more effective as cytotoxic agent against colon cancer cells, and this could be related, albeit partially, to the content of thymol and to its putative ability to downregulate TRPM8 gene expression. Additionally, the ethyl acetate extract was effective in inhibiting the gene expression of COX-2 and TNF\u03b1 in isolated colon tissue exposed to LPS. Overall, the present results support future studies for investigating protective effects against gut inflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Pelargonium quercetorum Agnew, belonging to the Gerianaceae family, is a medicinal plant traditionally used by the local population in the Hakkari region of Turkey and in the Kurdistan region of Iraq [1]. The species is characterized by herbaceous or semi-woody shrub plants, with rhizomes, schizocarpic fruits, and orange-red or pink flowers [2]. In Turkey, it is used for treating sore throats and as a wound healing agent, as well as for the management of migraines and pain [1]. The aerial portion is used as antiparasitic; indeed, a recent paper\nPlants 2023, 12, 1132. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12051132 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2023, 12, 1132 2 of 22\ndemonstrated the antiparasitic properties of the water extract against Leishmania major [3]. The methanol extract of the whole plant was reported to induce a cytotoxic activity against lung cancer cells [4], and was also effective as anti-inflammatory agent, in macrophages challenged with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [5]. Similarly, other Pelargonium species, especially P. sidoides, have been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal and liver diseases [6], but also for treating respiratory disorders [7]. Regarding the chemical composition, Pelargonium species are rich in essential oils, mainly constituted by monoterpenes, which can play antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities [4]. In the methanol extract of P. quercetorum the hydrocarbons tetracosane, heneicosane, and 2-methyleicosane were the phytochemicals present in higher concentration [4]; whereas rutin and shikimic acid were reported to be the main phenolics present in the methanol extract [8]. Ferda et al. [9] described cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects by P. quercetorum, and scavenging/reducing properties that could be partially related to the total phenol content of the methanol extract. In the present study, the chemical composition and biological properties of different polarity extracts of P. quercetorum were investigated. Specifically, phenolic compounds were assayed through colorimetric and chromatographic analysis. Intrinsic enzyme inhibition (against \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase, cholinesterases, and tyrosinase) and scavenging/reducing properties were assayed as well. The extracts were also studied in an ex vivo experimental model of colon inflammation, constituted by isolated colon specimens exposed to LPS, in order to reproduce the burden of inflammation and oxidative stress occurring during colitis, in vivo [10\u201313]. In this context, the gene expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) were assayed. Additionally, the gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A, hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), deeply involved in the so-called inflammatory-to-cancer transition [14], was also measured in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. In the same cell model, the gene expression of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M (melastatin) member 8 (TRPM8), possibly involved in colon carcinogenesis [15,16], was conducted as well. Finally, in silico studies were carried out for predicting the pharmacokinetics of the main phytochemicals present in the extracts, as well as direct interactions with protein targets assayed through the abovementioned biological models, among which the enzymes tyrosinase, \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, cholinesterases, and the TRPM8 receptor."

            "text": "Phenolic compounds are considered to be one of the most important players among the specialized metabolites and therefore the determination of their content is an important parameter to evaluate the pharmacological potential of plant extracts. In the present study, the total contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The highest total phenolic content (TPC) was found in the water extract with 62.52 mg GAE/g extract, followed by methanol (45.77 mg GAE/g extract), and ethyl acetate (21.94 mg GAE/g extract). For total flavonoid content (TFC), the order was methanol (40.12 mg RE/g extract), water (16.15 mg RE/g extract), and ethyl acetate (2.78 mg RE/g extract). In a previous study by Karatoprak, et al. [17], the total content of bioactive compounds of P. quercetorum extracts depended on the solvents used, and the highest content of them was detected in the methanolic extracts (especially from roots). In addition to P. quercetorum, several studies have reported significant levels of total bioactive compounds in the extracts of some Pelargonium species [18\u201320]. However, the observed results from spectrophotometric assays need to be confirmed by chromatographic techniques including liquid chromatography coupled with different type of detectors, for example, photodiode array or mass spectrometry. Therefore, we conducted a chromatographic analysis of the extracts for the quantitative determination of phenolic compounds, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 1A\u2013C. Specifically, the methanolic extract was the richest in flavonol glycosides and hydroxycinnamic\nPlants 2023, 12, 1132 3 of 22\nacids, among which rutin, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid were the main phytochemicals (Table 2).

            "text": "According to the latest scientific findings, oxidative stress is an important trigger for the progression of several chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, myocardial problems, and diabetes. In particular, increasing the production of free radicals leads to oxidative stress [23,24]. In this sense, antioxidants are the key players in controlling free radical levels. To that end, scientists are looking for new and safe sources of antioxidants, and phytochemicals are believed to be among the most powerful antioxidants. In the present study, we determined antioxidant properties of P. quercoutum extracts using different methods such as radical scavenging (2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline) 6- sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)), reducing power (cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)), metal chelating, and phosphomolybdenum assay. The results are summarized in Table 3. In radical scavenging assays (DPPH and ABTS), the best activity was found for the water extract (DPPH: 140.40 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g extract; ABTS: 212.31 mg TE/g extract), followed by methanol and ethyl acetate extracts. The reducing abilities of antioxidant compounds are very close to their electron-donation ability. Cu2+ to Cu and Fe3+ to Fe2+ conversions were measured using CUPRAC and FRAP assays, respectively. As can be seen from Table 3, the water extract showed the strongest reducing abilities, followed by methanol and ethyl acetate extracts. The results obtained from both free radical scavenger and reducing power assays are consistent with the total phenolic content of the tested extracts. This fact was also confirmed by Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis, and we observed a linear correlation between these parameters (Figure 2). In a literature review, several researchers also reported a strong correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant properties [25\u201327]. In addition to total phenolic content, some phytochemicals including rosmarinic, ferulic, caffeic, and gallic acids can be attributed to the observed antioxidant properties and are known to be powerful antioxidants [28\u201332]. In contrast to the radical scavenging ability and reducing power, the order of the tested extracts in the phosphomolybdenum assay was ethyl acetate (1.64 mmol TE/g extract) > methanol (1.54 mmol TE/g extract) > water (1.51 mmol TE/g extract). The phosphomolybdenum assay is known for determining total antioxidant capacity and also non-phenolics could play a role in the assay. Consistent with the presented results, a weak correlation between total phenols and phosphomolybdenum assay were reported by several investigators [33,34]. Finally, we investigated the metal chelating ability of P. quercetorum extracts, which is associated with controlling the production of hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton reaction. The methanol extract exhibited the best metal chelating ability with 29.80 mg EDTA equivalent (EDTAE)/g extract, followed by water extract (12.28 mg EDTAE/g extract). However, the ethyl acetate extract showed no metal chelating ability. In a previous study by Karatoprak, F\u0131rat and Kos\u0327ar [17], the antioxidant properties of P. quercetorum aerial parts and root extracts were investigated by DPPH, ABTS, ferric reducing power and metal chelating assays.

In addition to P. quercetorum, several Pelargonium species including P. hispidum [35], P. graveolens [18], P. hybrid [36], and P. sidoides [37] were investigated, and their extracts displayed antioxidant properties.

            "heading": "2.3. Enzyme Inhibitory Properties",
            "text": "Currently, most scientific efforts are focused both on improving the quality of public health and reducing the prevalence of certain diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [38]. Enzymes play a crucial role at this point and it is known that blocking a specific enzyme is an effective way to treat the abovementioned diseases. In this sense, some enzymes are selected therapeutic targets. For example, acetylcholinesterase is a main target to alleviate the observed symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [39]. As another example, the carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes, namely \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase, are checkpoints to control blood glucose level in diabetic patients [40]. For this purpose, several compounds are chemically produced as enzyme inhibitors, but most of them have side effects such as toxicity and gastrointestinal disturbances. At this point, we need to replace the synthetic drugs with natural and safe drugs, and plants are considered a promising in this sense. In view of the above facts, we investigated the enzyme inhibitory properties of P. quercetorum extracts, and the results are summarized in Table 4. The highest acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory effect was obtained by the methanol extract with 2.31 mg GALAE/g extract, followed by ethyl acetate and water extracts. However, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) was only inhibited by the ethyl acetate extract and others were not active on the enzyme. Tyrosinase is the main enzyme involved in the synthesis of melanin, and its inhibition is one of the most effective ways to treat hyperpigmentation problems. As can be seen from Table 4, methanol and ethyl acetate extracts were more active on tyrosinase compared with water. Similar to tyrosinase, the best inhibitory effects on \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase were recorded in the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts. The water extract exhibited the weakest ability in all enzyme inhibitory assays. As can be seen in Figure 2, the obtained enzyme inhibitory effects could be explained by the presence of some compounds. For example, AChE and tyrosinase inhibitory effects were positively correlated with pcoumaric acid, syringaldehyde, and chlorogenic acid, and these compounds have been described by some researchers as anti-Alzheimer and dermatoprotective agents [41\u201345]. In addition to these components, thymol had a good interaction with anti-diabetic enzymes, namely \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase. However, the interactions of specialized metabolites such as synergetic and antagonistic effects should not be forgotten. Thus, in future studies, we can suggest that the compounds could be isolated and then tested for their enzyme inhibitory properties. The enzyme inhibition potential of some Pelargonium species has been reported in the literature by several researchers. For example, Iancu, et al. [46] investigated the \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of two Pelargonium species (P. hispidum and P. grandiflorum) and found that the methanolic extracts had more potent inhibitory properties than hydroalcholic extracts. In another study conducted by Ahamad and Uthirapathy [47], significant \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory properties were reported for P. graveolens essential oil. The IC50 value was reported as 10.5 mg/mL in the AChE inhibitory effect of the essential oil of P. hybrid [36]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no data on the enzyme inhibitory properties of P. quercetorum extracts. Thus, the presented results are the first and they provide new information about the genus Pelargonium.\nValues are reported as mean \u00b1 SD of three parallel measurements.

The cells were exposed at different concentrations of the extracts (10\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL), finding a significant modulation of cell viability (Figures 3 and 4). Specifically, the ethyl acetate extract was found to be the most effective as cytotoxic agent, with a significant reduction of HCT116 cell viability, at the concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL, also after 48 and 72 h of cell exposure to the extract (Figures 3D and 4D).

In this context, the gene expression of HIF1\u03b1 and VEGFA, two angiogenic factors deeply involved in the so-called inflammatory-to cancer transition [14] were assayed. Hydrogen peroxide was able to upregulate the gene expression of both HIF1\u03b1 and VEGFA. This is consistent, albeit partially, with literature [48,49]. The extract was capable to blunt the hydrogen peroxide-induced up-regulation of both factors (Figure 5A,B), and this could be related, albeit partially, to the content in phenolic compounds [50,51].

Loganic acid and caftaric acid demonstrated a similar binding pattern to AChE and BChE, respectively. Both compounds were completely buried in the active sites of the enzymes and formed a couple of H-bonds and several van der Waals interactions. In addition, loganic acid formed hydrophobic interactions with AChE (Figure 8A), whereas caftaric acid formed \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacked interactions with BChE (Figure 8B). Likewise, even though rosmarinic acid shares similar interactions with the enzymes, it uniquely formed \u03c0\u2013anion interaction and engaged active site copper metal ion via van der Waals interaction (Figure 8C). On the other hand, syringaldehyde was weakly bound to \u03b1-amylase, mainly via van der Waals interactions (Figure 8D). Finally, the interaction between \u03b1-glucosidase and chlorogenic acid was demonstrated. Chlorogenic acid formed, mainly, a couple of H-bonds and several van der Waals interactions with residues in the active site of \u03b1-glucosidase (Figure 8E). In addition, all the constituent compounds were docked into the binding site of transient receptor potential melastatin member 8 (TRPM8)\u2014an ion channel for cold and menthol sensor. All the compounds were found to bind to the TRPM8, with the strongest binding demonstrated by rutin via multiple interactions with the binding site amino acid residues (Figure 8F); thus, suggesting putative abilities of rutin as regulator of TRPM8 activity. In summary, H-bonds are the major contributor to the protein interaction in all the selected docking complexes, except for that of \u03b1-amylase and syringaldehyde, in which van der Waals interactions were predominant. This is due to the multiple hydroxyl groups on the phenolic compounds forming H-bonds with the polar amino acid residues in the active site of the enzymes, corroborating with the binding energy scores. H-bonds are known to contribute greatly to protein\u2013ligand interaction.

When the confluency reached 80%, a viability test was performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test to assess the basal cytotoxicity of the P. quercetorum extracts under investigation. For this assay cells were seeded (5 \u00d7 103 cells/well) onto flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates and incubated overnight. After 24 h, extracts from the aerial parts of P. quercetorum at different concentrations were added, and the plates were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. After this time, a total of 10 \u00b5L of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h. The formazan dye formed was solubilized with dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance was recorded at 540 nm as previously described [59]. Effects on cell viability were evaluated in comparison to the vehicle (untreated control group) and expressed as a percentage of the control culture value. In a second set of experiments, cells were treated with either vehicle or extract for 24, 48, and 72 h and subsequently post-treated with 300 \u00b5M of hydrogen peroxide (H.P.) for 3 h. After this time, cell survival was determined by MTT assay as described above. Each condition was run in triplicate, including untreated control and blank cellfree control."

            "text": "The present study explored the composition and biological properties of extracts of different polarity from the aerial parts of P. quercetorum, a plant traditionally used by the local population in the Hakkari region of Turkey. The extracts showed a different qualitative and quantitative content of phytochemicals, with water and methanol extracts being richer in total phenols and flavonoids, especially rutin and hydroxycinnamic acids, namely caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid. This could explain, albeit partially, the higher antioxidant effects showed by methanol and water extracts, compared with ethyl acetate extract. By contrast, the ethyl acetate was more effective as cytotoxic agent against colon cancer cells, and this could be related, albeit partially, to the content of thymol and to its ability to downregulate the gene expression of TRPM8, an endovanilloid receptor possibly involved in colon carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, docking runs also suggest a high putative affinity of rutin towards TRPM8. This could suggest a potential involvement of rutin in mediating, albeit partially, the cytotoxic effects induced by the ethyl acetate extract of P. quercetorum, in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. Finally, the ethyl acetate extract reduced the gene expression of COX-2 and TNF\u03b1 gene expression, in isolated colon specimens challenged with LPS; thus, supporting further in vitro and vivo studies for investigating protective effects against gut inflammatory diseases. Additionally, further toxicological investigations are needed for defining the limits of biocompatibility in vivo.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/plants12051132/s1, Assays for Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents; Determination of Antioxidant and Enzyme Inhibitory Effects.
