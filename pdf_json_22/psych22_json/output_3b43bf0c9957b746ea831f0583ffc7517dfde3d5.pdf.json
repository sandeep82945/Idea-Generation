    "abstractText": "We thank the authors of the letter [1] for their interest in our proposed conceptual framework for physical training [2]. The contribution of Bertollo et al. [1] from a sport psychology perspective is greatly appreciated and we believe the authors succeeded in their attempt to integrate a different but complementary perspective on an interdisciplinary approach as advocated by the Grand Unified Theory proposed by Paul Glazier (2017) [3]. When developing and explaining the proposed framework [2], we focused on areas more directly related to physical training, and in which all the authors of this theoretical framework possess a specific expertise. As a consequence, the psychological aspects have been mentioned but not explored or more deeply addressed. Similarly, we referred to athlete-reported outcome measures from a clinimetric perspective. Accordingly, we focused on symptoms and physical signs resulting from training and thus did not address specifically the issues of traits and states. Nevertheless, as we indicated in Table 1 of our paper [2], many of the individual factors that affect training are psychological traits and states. Furthermore, many of the acute training effects we mentioned (e.g. subjective feelings of fatigue) can also be classified as psychological states if one prefers to use psychological, rather than clinimetric, jargon. The further explanation of the concepts of trait and states by Bertollo et al. [1] is relevant because it is crucial in the selection of the correct psychometric instruments, now commonly used by sport scientists and practitioners [4]. As such, understanding whether practitioners wish to assess traits or states should drive the selection of the appropriate instrument, as well as the validation of new instruments.",
