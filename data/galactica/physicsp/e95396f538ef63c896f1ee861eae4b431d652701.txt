The degradation of a mixture of ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac in various effluents by UVC/H2O2 or UVC/S2O8 2 was studied to assess the impact of the matrix composition and of the oxidant precursor on process efficiency. Experiments were carried out in a 20-L laboratory pilot (a scaled-down version of a full-scale pilot). In effluents collected during dry weather, the rural constructed wetland effluent allowed faster degradation than the urban conventional WWTP effluent, regardless of the nature of the targets or of the oxidant precursor. This was mainly attributed to a three-times higher chemical oxygen demand in the urban effluent, likely to quench the oxidative species. UV fluences to reach 90% degradation of the three compounds were 3,800 and 5,500 mJ cm 2 in the rural effluent, whereas they were 6,600 and 6,100 mJ cm 2 in the urban effluent with H2O2 and S2O8 2 , respectively. After a rainfall event, the rural effluent composition was not significantly affected compared to that of the urban effluent that underwent the dilution effect. Therefore, the stability of the rural effluent composition allowed comparable degradation efficiency, whereas the dilution effect led to a significant increase in the degradation rate constants in the urban effluent (up to four times higher). 1. conclusions and reported that UVC radiation only allowed complete removal of DCF traces in secondary WWTP effluent under 923 mJ cm 2, whereas NAP required 2,768 mJ cm 2 to reach 90% degradation. Zupanc et al. (2013) have also shown that it is not appropriate for the degradation of IBU. 3.1.2. influence of oxidant precursors In the presence of H2O2 or S2O 2 8 , IBU, NAP and DCF degradation kinetics follow pseudo-first order rates. Figure 2 represents their degradation rate constants without oxidant precursor and with H2O2 or S2O 2 8 (0.5 mM) in drinking water. All experiments were carried out in duplicate with acceptable relative standard deviations (between 2 and 17%). The generation of HO† or SO† 4 in the presence of H2O2 or S2O 2 8 , respectively, enhances the degradation rate of the compounds of interest compared to UVC photolysis only. Indeed, as seen in Section 2.4, k0 ¼ k0p þ k0ox. The results also show that S2O2 8 is more efficient than H2O2, which is attributed to its photolysis constant in the pilot (k 0S2O2 8
¼ 5.21 10 4 cm2 mJ 1) almost 3.4 times higher than that of H2O2 (k0H2O2 ¼ 1.54 10 4 cm2 mJ 1). However, the presence of oxidant precursors has a different impact on each pollutant.

Regarding DCF, a very photosensitive molecule, the addition of oxidant precursors has a moderated impact on its removal: degradation rate constants are multiplied by 1.2 and 1.6 with H2O2 and S2O 2 8 , respectively, which means that UV fluences can be divided by 1.2 and 1.6 to reach complete degradation in the same conditions, compared to photolysis only. Indeed, k0p DCF (5.65 10 3 cm2 mJ 1) is 4.6 and 1.6 times higher than k0ox DCF with HO† (1.24 10 3 cm2 mJ 1) and SO†4 (3.63 10 3 cm2 mJ 1), respectively, indicating that photolysis is prevailing. This was also observed by Packer et al. (2003) in a UVC/H2O2 system. Regarding IBU and NAP, which are less photosensitive than DCF, the use of oxidant precursors significantly increases their degradation rates. They allow the multiplication of k0IBU by almost 11 compared to photolysis only, regardless of the nature of the oxidant precursor. k0NAP is multiplied by approximately 6 in the presence of H2O2, whereas it is multiplied by 20 in the presence of S2O 2 8 . As a consequence, coupling oxidant precursors to UVC radiation can significantly reduce the energy consumption of the process. For example, the complete degradation of IBU (implying the complete removal of DCF and NAP) requires around 4,000 and 2,500 mJ cm 2 in the presence of H2O2 and S2O 2 8 , respectively, whereas it is degraded by less than 35% at 4,000 mJ cm 2 under UVC only. 3.4. implementation in a wwtp The economic and technical interests of the implementation of a UVC-based process at the outlet of rural WWTPs were previously shown by Cédat (2016) in a preliminary study on a 1,100 population equivalent constructed wetland. However, experiments were only carried out on a one-off basis and did not include effluent composition or condition variations. The present study allowed to conclude that the effluent composition stability and the lower organic matter load during dry weather of the rural secondary effluent make UVC-based AOPs more appropriate for the removal of micropollutants at the outlet of rural WWTPs compared to urban ones. Moreover, Besnault et al. (2014) compared several processes for the removal of micropollutants and observed that the WWTP size has an impact on treatment cost. They reported that UVCbased processes are economically and technically competitive with other processes such as ozone-based ones in mediumsized WWTPs (.60,000 population equivalent), whereas they are less economically and technically interesting in large
WWTPs (.200,000 population equivalent) because of the high number of UVC lamps required, leading to a large footprint and elevated investment costs. As a consequence, it can be concluded that UVC-based processes seem to be more adapted for micropollutant removal to rural and small-sized WWTPs, from an economic and technical perspective. 4. conclusion This work is aimed at assessing and comparing the abilities of UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O 2 8 for the removal of micropollutants in various effluents towards an implementation in domestic WWTPs. It was carried out in a 20-L pilot and IBU, NAP
and DCF were used as model micropollutants. Preliminary experiments carried out in a simple matrix indicated that DCF is photolabile enough to be degraded in a UVC process. However, IBU and NAP were seen to require the addition of H2O2 or S2O 2 8 that strongly enhanced their degradation rates.

Then, the use of WWTP effluents collected during dry weather inhibited degradation rates. This inhibition was stronger in
the urban effluent: the required UV fluences to reach more than 90% degradation of all the compounds were 74 and 10% higher in the urban effluent than in the rural one, in the presence of H2O2 and S2O 2 8 , respectively. This was mainly attributed to the three times higher COD in the urban effluent that was likely to increase HO† and SO† 4 quenching. During wet weather, the stable composition and transmittance of the rural effluent allowed similar degradation rates than the effluent collected during dry weather, whereas strong dilution of the urban effluent, collected after unusual heavy rain, allowed to multiply the degradation rates by 1.3–3.7 compared to the dry weather effluent. As a consequence, this study showed that the effluents of rural WWTP, that are often small and medium-sized WWTPs, seem to allow for higher and more consistent
performances of UVC-based AOPs than urban WWTPs. This adds to conclusions previously made in the literature regarding the economic and technical attractivity of these processes for the removal of micropollutants in small- and medium-sized WWTPs. Finally, despite the faster photolysis of S2O 2 8 , both H2O2 and S2O 2 8 were seen to be efficient in degrading the targets and presented various performances depending on the compound. NAP underwent faster degradation in the presence of S2O 2 8 , which was also the case of DCF but to a lesser extent. However, IBU was degraded faster in the presence of H2O2 in the rural effluents. Despite the faster photolysis of S2O 2 8 allowing faster degradation of DCF and NAP, IBU underwent faster degradation in the presence of H2O2 in the rural effluents. Moreover, although faster degradation induces lower electrical cost to reach similar degradation, treatment cost also includes reagent and labour cost. DECLARATION OF COMPETING INTEREST
