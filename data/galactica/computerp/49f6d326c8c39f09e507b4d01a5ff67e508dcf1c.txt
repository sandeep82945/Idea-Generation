In the era of space exploration, the implications of space weather have become increasingly evident. Central to this is the phenomenon of coronal holes, which can significantly influence the functioning of satellites and aircraft. These coronal holes, present on the sun, are distinguished by their open magnetic field lines and comparatively cooler temperatures, leading to the emission of solar winds at heightened rates. To anticipate the effects of these coronal holes on Earth, our study harnesses computer vision to pinpoint the coronal hole regions and estimate their dimensions using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Further, we deploy deep learning methodologies, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach, to analyze the trends in the data related to the area of the coronal holes and predict their dimensions across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By evaluating the time series data concerning the area of the coronal holes, our research seeks to uncover patterns in the behavior of coronal holes and comprehend their potential influence on space weather occurrences. This investigation marks a pivotal stride towards bolstering our capacity to anticipate and brace for space weather events that could have ramifications for Earth and its technological apparatuses. 1 conclusions A streamlined model for detecting coronal holes is paramount for advancing our comprehension of space weather events and enhancing space weather forecasting accuracy. Coronal holes, distinctively marked by their low temperature and density in the sun’s corona, have a notable relationship with solar winds. These winds can potentially affect Earth’s satellite functions and its power grids. Hence, determining the expanse of the coronal hole is pivotal to predict space weather occurrences and to decrease their potential negative effects. Our research has led to the formulation of a model that detects coronal holes, facilitating the accumulation of 3857 data entries related to them. This data served as the foundation for a deep learning prediction model tailored for assessing the size of the coronal holes. The incorporation of advanced deep learning tools, particularly LSTM models, for forecasting space weather series data has exhibited encouraging outcomes. This model adeptly estimates the size of the coronal hole utilizing purely numerical information. Utilizing this model, we’re better equipped to predict space weather occurrences and thereby bolster our preventive measures against their potential impacts on Earth’s spatial and technological ecosystems. Additionally, forecasting the dimensions and positioning of these coronal holes enhances our grasp on the causative factors behind solar activities like CMEs and CIRs. 7.1 study limitations The conclusions of this research come with a few caveats. The model is singularly focused on estimating the area of the coronal hole, sidelining other astronomical aspects that might play a part in determining its size and position. The data considered spans a decade, which may not represent the full fluctuation of the coronal hole in relation to the solar cycle. An all-encompassing comprehension necessitates data covering more extensive periods. Our focus was primarily on mid-zones, bypassing other areas like the equatorial zone where coronal holes might manifest. Subsequent studies should shed light on these holes in varied regions and their association with space weather activities. Enriching the model’s precision could be achieved by integrating data from a wider range of instruments and observatories. 7.2 future research As we look forward, it’s essential to delve deeper into the intrinsic physical processes dictating the genesis and evolution of coronal holes.
