    "abstractText": "Background. The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC) is a patient-reported outcome measure which assesses experiences of discrimination among persons with a mental illness globally. Methods. This study evaluated whether the psychometric properties of a short-form version, DISC-Ultra Short (DISCUS) (11-item), could be replicated in a sample of people with a wide range of mental disorders from 21 sites in 15 countries/territories, across six global regions. The frequency of experienced discrimination was reported. Scaling assumptions (confirmatory factor analysis, inter-item and item-total correlations), reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity, known groups method) were investigated in each region, and by diagnosis group. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722000630 Published online by Cambridge University Press Results. 1195 people participated. The most frequently reported experiences of discrimination were being shunned or avoided at work (48.7%) and discrimination in making or keeping friends (47.2%). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional model across all six regions and five diagnosis groups. Convergent validity was confirmed in the total sample and within all regions [ Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI-10): 0.28\u20130.67, stopping self: 0.54\u20130.72, stigma consciousness: \u22120.32\u20130.57], as was internal consistency reliability (\u03b1 = 0.74\u20130.84). Known groups validity was established in the global sample with levels of experienced discrimination significantly higher for those experiencing higher depression [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2: p < 0.001], lower mental wellbeing [Warwick-Edinburgh Well-being Scale (WEMWBS): p < 0.001], higher suicidal ideation [Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)-4: p < 0.001] and higher risk of suicidal behaviour [Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS): p < 0.001]. Conclusions. The DISCUS is a reliable and valid unidimensional measure of experienced discrimination for use in global settings with similar properties to the longer DISC. It offers a brief assessment of experienced discrimination for use in clinical and research settings.",

The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC) is a patient-reported outcome measure which assesses experiences of discrimination among persons with a mental illness globally. Methods. This study evaluated whether the psychometric properties of a short-form version, DISC-Ultra Short (DISCUS) (11-item), could be replicated in a sample of people with a wide range of mental disorders from 21 sites in 15 countries/territories, across six global regions. The frequency of experienced discrimination was reported. Scaling assumptions (confirmatory factor analysis, inter-item and item-total correlations), reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity, known groups method) were investigated in each region, and by diagnosis group.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722000630 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nResults. 1195 people participated. The most frequently reported experiences of discrimination were being shunned or avoided at work (48.7%) and discrimination in making or keeping friends (47.2%). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional model across all six regions and five diagnosis groups. Convergent validity was confirmed in the total sample and within all regions [ Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI-10): 0.28\u20130.67, stopping self: 0.54\u20130.72, stigma consciousness: \u22120.32\u20130.57], as was internal consistency reliability (\u03b1 = 0.74\u20130.84). Known groups validity was established in the global sample with levels of experienced discrimination significantly higher for those experiencing higher depression [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2: p < 0.001], lower mental wellbeing [Warwick-Edinburgh Well-being Scale (WEMWBS): p < 0.001], higher suicidal ideation [Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)-4: p < 0.001] and higher risk of suicidal behaviour [Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS): p < 0.001]. Conclusions. The DISCUS is a reliable and valid unidimensional measure of experienced discrimination for use in global settings with similar properties to the longer DISC. It offers a brief assessment of experienced discrimination for use in clinical and research settings."

            "text": "Discrimination has been defined as the behavioural aspect of stigma; the enactment of problems of knowledge (ignorance or misinformation) and problems of attitudes (prejudice) (Thornicroft, Rose, Kassam, & Sartorius, 2007). Discrimination represents a pervasive global violation of the human rights of individuals who are experiencing disability due to mental illness (Drew et al., 2011).\nIt is well-evidenced that parity of esteem is not reflected in the funding of mental health services and access to both general medical and mental healthcare treatment for individuals with a mental illness (Angermeyer, Matschinger, Link, & Schomerus, 2014; Docherty & Thornicroft, 2015; Hilton, 2016). This has led to a global treatment gap in conditions such as major depressive disorder where only 1 in 5 people in high-income and 1 in 27 in low/ lower-middle-income countries receive a minimally appropriate level of treatment (Thornicroft et al., 2017). In this regard, mental illness stigma and discrimination impact notably on population health (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013).\nStructural and social capital barriers are also present in employment, education, housing, child custody and criminal justice settings (Brouwers et al., 2016; Jeffery et al., 2013; Webber et al., 2014). In personal relationships individuals also experience discrimination ranging from micro-aggressions such as invalidation of experience to physical, emotional, financial and sexual abuse and exploitation (Barber, Gronholm, Ahuja, R\u00fcsch, & Thornicroft, 2020; Bhavsar, Dean, Hatch, MacCabe, & Hotopf, 2019; Drew et al., 2011). This is further reflected in the role of fear in characterising the experiences of mental health services users (Sweeney, Gillard, Wykes, & Rose, 2015).\nTo evidence the discrimination experienced by individuals with a mental illness globally, a robust measurement approach is required. The Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC) was developed as part of the International Study of Discrimination and Stigma Outcomes (INDIGO) (Thornicroft, Brohan, Rose, Sartorius, & Leese, 2009), a global research collaboration to evidence these experiences. The most recent version of this scale, DISC-12, is a 32-item structured interview designed to assess the experienced and anticipated discrimination in people with a mental illness. DISC has shown strong psychometric properties (Brohan et al., 2013) and has been widely used in over 50 countries with individuals with schizophrenia (Thornicroft et al., 2009), depression (Lasalvia et al., 2013) and bipolar disorder\n(Farrelly et al., 2014). In the study by Farrelly et al. (2014), similar levels of experienced discrimination were reported by those with depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, with 87% experiencing discrimination in at least one area of life in the previous year. DISC-12 also collects qualitative examples of the experiences that participants are referring to when they provide a rating for their experience of discrimination. Further detail on the conceptual underpinnings of DISC, and similarities and differences between DISC and other measures of stigma and discrimination, are available elsewhere (Brohan et al., 2013; Brohan et al., in press; Brohan, Slade, Clement, & Thornicroft, 2010).\nThe ability to distil a longer scale into a short-form which retains the core aspects of the original, and demonstrates appropriate psychometric properties, is highly advantageous when the administration of the full measure is not feasible or necessary. This is particularly pertinent in low resource settings and a necessary step in ensuring that barriers to the global assessment of stigma and discrimination are reduced by shortening measures where possible (Bakolis et al., 2019; Brohan et al., in press). Beidas et al. (2015), suggest that the following properties are key in measures for use in low resource setting: freely and easily accessible; brief; have established psychometric properties; and high relevance. DISC-Ultra Short (DISCUS) aligns closely with these requirements by reducing participant burden, while remaining free to use, easily accessible and highly relevant. This paper provides evidence on the psychometric properties.\nA full discussion of the psychometric properties of stigma and discrimination measures is presented elsewhere (Brohan et al., in press). A short-form version of the DISC, DISCUS, has recently been developed based on a secondary analysis of INDIGO network data with the use of novel meta-analytic factor analysis methods to perform item reduction and examine measurement invariance in a global sample. This resulted in an 11-item version which was further tested in a secondary analysis of a diverse London-based sample (Farrelly et al., 2014). Excellent agreement was observed between corresponding experienced discrimination scores on the 21-item experienced discrimination scale of DISC-12 and short-form DISCUS (Pearson\u2019s correlation \u03c1 = 0.95) (Bakolis et al., 2019). DISCUS was also found to have appropriate internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.87) and convergent validity [Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) r = 0.35, Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), r = 0.35] (Bakolis et al., 2019). The anticipated discrimination aspects of DISC-12 have\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722000630 Published online by Cambridge University Press\npreviously been developed into a stand-alone measure of anticipated discrimination and are not the focus of this current work (Gabbidon, Brohan, Clement, Henderson, & Thornicroft, 2013).\nThis paper seeks to evaluate whether the psychometric properties the DISCUS can be replicated in a sample of individuals with a diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or an anxiety disorder in 15 countries/territories across six global regions. This is the first time that primary data have been collected using the short-form DISCUS and builds on the secondary analysis conducted by Bakolis et al. The aims of this study are:\n1. To evaluate the psychometric properties of the DISCUS in a primary data sample including: (i) scaling assumptions or the extent to which each DISCUS item contributes to a unidimensional scale producing a total experienced discrimination score; (ii) construct validity or the ability of DISCUS to yield consistent, reproducible estimates of the construct by assessing hypothesised relationships with similar constructs (convergent validity) and within distinct groups e.g. clinically different subgroups (known groups); (iii) reliability or the ability of DISCUS to yield consistent estimates of the construct under consideration across item responses (internal consistency). 2. To provide evidence on the appropriateness of using DISCUS to measure the discrimination experienced by individuals with mental illness in each of six global regions and five diagnosis categories."

Polychoric correlations were calculated between each item pair to ensure that all items are providing distinct information. Items were then summed and averaged to calculate a DISCUS total score. Corrected item-total correlations <0.30 were used to indicate the unacceptable fit of the items with the DISCUS total score (Terwee et al., 2007).\nMulti-group confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to identify if the same construct is being measured across regions. To evaluate the overall model fit, the comparative fit index (CFI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were calculated. A CFI value of greater than 0.90 indicates an adequate fit to the data (Hu & Bentler, 1999). A value of RMSEA < 0.05 indicates close fit, values between 0.05 and 0.08 suggest adequate model fit, and values >0.10 suggest poor model fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The standardised root means squared residual (SRMR) was also calculated to examine how the model functions to reproduce the relationships from the input covariance matrix with an SRMR of <0.1considered acceptable (Kline, 2015). Postestimation modification indices were examined to identify pairs of variables where allowing correlation of the error terms may improve model fit e.g. modification index <3.84 (Acock, 2013). The selection of included correlated error terms was not purely data-driven, and the conceptual rationale for each inclusion was discussed by the authors. A final model was then run.\nTo examine whether the same construct is being measured across diagnostic groups, a second model was run which used the diagnosis as the grouping variable rather than region. The diagnosis was categorised as: Depression, Anxiety Disorder, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder or Do not know diagnosis. Participants who reported other primary diagnoses were excluded from this analysis, though are included elsewhere in this paper.

This model includes correlation of the following error terms (Item 2: Dating and Items 8: Privacy, 9: Safety and 10: Children), (Item 3: Housing and Items 7: Social life, 8: Privacy, 9: Safety and 10: Children), (Item 5: Finding work and Item 6: Keeping work), (Item 6: Keeping work and Item 8: Privacy, 10: Children), (Item 8: Privacy and Item 9: Safety). SMSR was also examined at the regional level with all regions having scores <0.1 (range 0.053\u20130.095) apart from Asia, SMSR = 0.157.\nWhen this model was run with diagnosis as a grouping variable, rather than region, significant loadings were seen for each item across each of five diagnostic categories (Depression; Anxiety Disorder; Bipolar Disorder; Schizophrenia; do not know mental diagnosis). The one factor CFA solution for DISCUS is graphically represented in Fig. 2. The RMSEA of 0.070, CFI of 0.904 and SMSR <0.10 suggest acceptable model fit. SMSR was also examined by diagnosis category with all categories having scores <0.1 (range 0.060 to.084)."

Previous research suggests that DISCUS, an 11-item, short-form version developed and confirmed using secondary data, produces an experienced discrimination score which is equivalent to DISC-12 scores (Bakolis et al., 2019). This current study advances this work by providing evidence that the unidimensional nature of experienced discrimination, as assessed using DISCUS, is replicated in a primary data sample from 21 sites in 15 countries/territories encompassing six global regions. Unidimensionality was also supported across five diagnosis categories (Depression, Anxiety Disorder, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder and \u2018Do not know diagnosis)\u2019. Further support for convergent validity was provided in relation to self-stigma, stopping oneself from engaging in social contact and stigma stress, across all six global regions. Internal consistency was strong across all regions. The known groups method also provided evidence that experienced discrimination is greater among those experiencing higher levels of depression (PHQ-2: p < 0.001), higher hopelessness (BHS-4, p < 0.001), higher risk of suicidal behaviour (SIDAS, p < 0.001) and lower mental wellbeing (WEMWBS, p < 0.001). This work is further supported by a sensitivity analysis using median imputation of DISCUS item scores. This resulted in a very limited change to the interpretation of results suggesting that the non-applicable and missing responses were not providing meaningfully different information whether they were scored as 0 \u2018not at all\u2019 or using the median value.\nThis suggests that DISCUS provides a short-form, reliable and valid approach for measuring experienced discrimination which performs similarly across a range of global regions and diagnosis groups. It is suitable for use where full information on the content of discrimination experiences (as provided by DISC) is not required or not feasible within the setting. It offers detail on the content of experiences within the most key items, as well as a mean item score which is highly comparable with that produced by the full version.\nDISCUS draws on macro, meso and micro-level experiences of discrimination with a focus on micro-level experiences. The most frequently reported experiences in this study were \u2018being shunned or avoided at work\u2019 by 48.7% of global participants (Item 11) and \u2018discrimination in making or keeping friends\u2019 by 47.2% (Item 1). This is in keeping with previous studies (Bakolis et al., 2019). There is some variation across regions with \u2018discrimination in keeping a job\u2019 most frequently reported in Latin America. This provides support for interventions that focus on addressing loneliness [e.g. (Castelein, Bruggeman, Davidson, & Gaag, 2015; Vogel et al., 2019)] or employment challenges [e.g. (Janssens, van Weeghel, Henderson, Joosen, & Brouwers, 2020)] among individuals with a mental illness.\nIt is important to note that although a unidimensional model of experienced discrimination is appropriate across all regions, this does not mean that the nature of experiences is the same. This is supported by the region-level fit statistics which suggest\nthat the model may fit less well for Asia with greater residual variance here, as indicated by the higher SRMR. A different pattern of non-applicable responses was noted in Asia which may contribute to this. For example, for the Education-related item (Item 4), 63.6% of responses were non-applicable with the next highest 46.9% for Southern Europe. Further examination of the open-text responses collected using DISCUS could help to explain some of the reasons for this difference but is beyond the scope of this current paper. Discrimination experiences are compounded in an intersectional way for individuals who experience discrimination because of other minority characteristics as well as mental illness including race/ethnicity, sexuality, gender, age, and comorbid mental or physical disabilities (Hall et al., 2014). Further work is still required to understand how these multiple discrimination experiences influence the safety, health and wellbeing of individuals with mental illness.\nThe correlated error terms most commonly included in the CFAs relate to Item 8: Privacy (correlated with Item 2: Dating, Item 3: Housing, Item 6: Keeping a job and Item 9: Safety) and Item 9: Safety (correlated with Item 2: Dating, Item 3: Housing, Item 8: Privacy). This fits with evidence that fear is a pervasive theme in understanding mental health service users experiences and suggests that privacy and safety violations may underlie experienced discrimination in other areas (Sweeney et al., 2015). Further analysis of the qualitative responses to understand the underpinning nature of safety and privacy concerns on other experiences of discrimination is an area for future research."

            "text": "As diagnoses were self-reported by participants recruited through clinical settings, the extent to which diagnoses correspond to those recorded in clinical notes is unknown. However, as the focus of this work is to assess discrimination experiences then arguably it is most important to understand participants own understanding of their diagnosis as this is the information that they use in making sense of their experiences of discrimination.\nAnalysis using the known groups method did not reach significance across all regions. The unequal distribution of responses across categories within certain regions is likely to be a limiting factor. This is particularly true for SIDAS where low numbers selected a response indicating \u2018high risk\u2019 e.g. n = 4 in Africa. As this is the most severe indicator of mental ill-health in the study then an unequal split in subgroup membership is to be expected, however, this is magnified at the regional level. Although significance was still found in 3 of the 6 regions, with scores in the expected direction for a further two regions, it may be most accurate to consider the total sample for these analyses.\nThere are also limitations in the use of a convenience sample of participants and in the regional groupings. Although\nTable 1. (Continued.)\nVariable N (%) or Mean (S.D.)

The validity of grouping diverse countries such as India, Taiwan and China under \u2018Asia\u2019 or Tunisia, Nigeria and South Africa under \u2018Africa\u2019 is uncertain; however, it reflects the regions currently used by the WHO. Moreover, confirmation of robust psychometrics across such broad groups is a strength.\nFurther work is also required to establish the ability to detect a change, and interpretation of scoring including minimal important change, for DISCUS if it is to be used as an outcome measure in interventional settings. However, information on these aspects is available for the full DISC."
