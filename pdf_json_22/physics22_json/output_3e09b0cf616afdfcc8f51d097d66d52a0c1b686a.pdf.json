    "abstractText": "Quantisation with Gaussian type states offers certain advantages over other quantisation schemes, in particular, they can serve to regularise formally discontinuous classical functions leading to well defined quantum operators. In this work we define a squeezed state quantisation in two dimensions using several families of squeezed states for oneand two-mode configurations. The completeness relations of the squeezed states are exploited in order to tackle the quantisation and semiclassical analysis of a constrained position dependent mass model with harmonic potential. The effects of the squeezing parameters on the resulting operators and phase space functions are studied, and configuration space trajectories are compared between the classical and semiclassical models. gazeau@apc.in2p3.fr hussin@dms.umontreal.ca james.moran@umontreal.ca kdzelaya@fis.cinvestav.mx 1 ar X iv :2 20 1. 00 40 5v 1 [ qu an tph ] 2 J an 2 02 2",

            "text": "Coherent states and their generalisation, squeezed states, are ubiquitous in the study of quantum optics. They describe a set of minimal uncertainty states with respect to their generalised quadratures (in typical quantum systems these may refer to position and momentum), and the \u2018squeezing\u2019 refers to the reduction in one quadrature variance at the expense of an increase in the conjugate quadrature variance [1]. In multimode systems there exists an even greater variety of squeezed states because the squeezing can occur between four or more quadratures and their combinations. Multimode squeezed states are the most general type of Gaussian state permissible and have found use outside of optics as a resource in continuous variable quantum information processing for generating multipartite entanglement [2,3]. Beyond Gaussian states, non-Gaussian states represent a further generalisation [4]. Schumaker investigated the most general two-mode Gaussian pure states [5], schemes designed to generalise this construction to the N -mode case were studied in [6], and a general presentation of a coupled three-mode squeezed vacuum was presented in [7].\nOutside of optics and information theory, squeezed states have attractive mathematical properties, in particular they form an overcomplete basis in the Hilbert space of quantum states [8,9]. Equipped with this property one may expand any state of a given system in the basis of squeezed states. Moreover, one may quantise a classical function in the squeezed state basis yielding an associated quantum operator as well as define an averaged value of the initial function with\nrespect to the squeezed states yielding a semiclassical portrait. This is precisely the purpose of this work, to extend the ideas of Klauder-Berezin coherent state quantisation [10] by defining a two-mode squeezed state quantisation in which we use several families of two-mode squeezed states and study the effect of their squeezing parameters on the resulting quantum operators and semiclassical phase space functions.\nLet A and B be two observables,1 so that rA,Bs \u201d AB \u00b4 BA \u201c iC and C: \u201c C, together with the corresponding Schro\u0308dinger-Robertson inequality\np\u2206Aq2p\u2206Bq2 \u011b |1 4 |xCy|2 ` \u03c3pA,Bq , \u03c3pA,Bq :\u201c xAB `BAy 2 \u00b4 xAyxBy , (1)\nwith mean xF y :\u201c x\u03a8|F |\u03a8y, variance p\u2206F q2 \u201c xF 2y \u00b4 xF y2, and \u03c3pA,Bq, the correlation function [11]. Then, we say that |\u03a8y, with }|\u03a8y} \u0103 8, is a squeezed state if one of the variances associated to the observables A and B takes values below the uncertainty minimum b\n1 4 |xCy|2 ` \u03c3pA,Bq while the second variance compensates by increasing such that the inequality (1) is always saturated. Note that the definition of squeezing is in reference to the observable whose variance is being \u2018squeezed\u2019.\nInterestingly, if an underlying algebra can be identified with the observables A and B,the squeezed states can be constructed by the sequential action of unitary operators on a fiducial state. Such unitary operators are usually constructed as the exponential representation of the algebra elements. To this end, there exist a great deal of examples of squeezed states in the literature such as the coherent squeezed states, coherent and squeezed number states [12], secondorder squeezed states [13], and Susskind-Glogower coherent states [14,15] (also know as London coherent states [16]) to mention some. On the other hand, if a closed algebra is not available, one may proceed by solving an eigenvalue equation of the form pA ` i\u03bbBq|\u03c8y \u201c z|\u03c8y, which minimises (1). See for instance [17\u201319]. The latter constructions have been extended to quantised electromagnetic fields composed of several modes. Some examples include two-mode [20\u201323] and higher-mode constructions [7].\nIn this work, we exploit the overcompleteness of certain families squeezed states as a means of quantisation in two dimensions. The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 we review the basics of quantisation with one-mode squeezed states and define their semiclassical portraits. Following this, in Sec. 3 we generalise the notions of the preceding section to the two-mode case. We first define the most natural extension, the separable squeezed states, as the tensor product of two one-mode squeezed states acting on each mode independently, and then we define the non-separable squeezed states which cannot be factorised by a tensor product. We compare the quantisation of some classical functions in both cases and find that non-separability leads to mixing between quadrature operators between both modes. In Sec. 4 we study the semiclassical portraits of a position dependent mass system in constrained geometry as an application, before concluding in Sec. 5 with some remarks about extensions of the ideas presented in this paper to different problems."

Firstly, the unitary displacement and squeezing operators are de-\n1In this work, we focus on the common definition of observables as defined by self-adjoint operators, A: \u201c A.\nfined as follows Dp\u03b1q :\u201c e\u03b1a:\u00b4\u03b1\u02daa , Sp\u03beq :\u201c e\u00b4 1 2 \u03bea:2` 1 2 \u03be\u02daa2 , \u03b1, \u03be P C , (2)\nin terms of the boson operators a and a:, whose action on the elements of the elements of the Fock basis t|nyu8n\u201c0 is given by\na|n` 1y \u201c ? n` 1|ny , a:|ny \u201c ? n` 1|n` 1y n \u201c 0, 1 . . . , (3)\nalong with the annihilation of the vacuum state, a|0y \u201c 0. The squeezed coherent states, |\u03b1; \u03bey, are then constructed through the action of the unitary operators (2) on the corresponding fiducial state |0y,\n|\u03b1; \u03bey \u201c Sp\u03beqDp\u03b1q|0y. (4)\nNote that the alternative definition of squeezed states, |\u03be;\u03b2y \u201c Dp\u03b2qSp\u03beq|0y, is equivalent to (4) through a braiding relation and this amounts to a relabelling of the parameters. Following the customary procedure, one can disentangle the unitary operators in the product of exponential functions in terms of a and a: separately. Alternatively, we can determine the eigenvalue equation related to |\u03b1, \u03bey. This is achieved by computing the unitary transformations on the boson ladder operators\nS:p\u03beqaSp\u03beq \u201c a cosh |\u03be| \u00b4 a: \u03be|\u03be| sinh |\u03be| , D :p\u03b1qaDp\u03b1q \u201c a` \u03b1 , (5)\nwhere a Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff identity [24] has been used. Thus, from the unitary transformation D:S:aSD, and after several calculations, we get the eigenvalue equation\npa` \u03c4a:q|\u03b1, \u03bey \u201c \u03b1 a 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2|\u03b1, \u03bey , \u03c4 \u201c \u03be|\u03be| tanh |\u03be| . (6)\nThe latter leads to a second-order finite-difference equation [25] in the Fock basis which yields the following normalisable states [26]\n|\u03b1; \u03bey \u201c p1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2q1{4e\u00b4 |\u03b1|2 2 `\u03b1 2\u03c4\u02da`\u03b1\u02da2\u03c4 4\n8 \u00ff\nn\u201c0\n\u03c4n{2\np2nn!q1{2 Hn\n\u02dc\n\u03b1\nc\n1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 2\u03c4\n\u00b8\n|ny , (7)\nfor \u03b1 P C and |\u03c4 | \u0103 1 (\u03be P C). In general, the squeezed states do not form an orthogonal set of states as they have a non-zero overlap, x\u03b11, \u03be|\u03b1, \u03bey \u2030 0. Nevertheless they form an overcomplete set of states on the Hilbert space as they fulfil the resolution of the identity\n\u017c\n\u03b1PC\nd2\u03b1\n\u03c0 |\u03b1, \u03beyx\u03b1, \u03be| \u201c I , (8)\nwith I the identity operator in the Fock space H \u201c spant|nyu8n\u201c0, and the measure function is uniform \u03c0\u00b41 as it is for the canonical coherent states.\nFrom the very definition of the squeezed states, |\u03b1, \u03bey \u201c Sp\u03beqDp\u03b1q|0y, we obtain a more simple form for the resolution of the identity, which reads\nSp\u03beq \u02c6 \u017c\n\u03b1PC\nd2\u03b1\n\u03c0 |\u03b1yx\u03b1|\n\u02d9\nS:p\u03beq \u201c I , |\u03b1y \u201c Dp\u03b1q|0y , (9)\nwith |\u03b1y the conventional Glauber-Sudarshan coherent states. By defining the squeezed coherent states using the convention in (4), the measure function is constant. In this form, we have shown that squeezed states form an overcomplete set t|\u03b1, \u03beyu\u03b1PC with a uniform measure. The identity operator can be alternatively achieved through the orthogonality property related to the holomorphic Hermite polynomial [27,28]. See App. A for a detailed proof.\nThe resolution of the identity ensures that every element |\u03c6y P H can be expanded in the non-orthogonal basis t|\u03c8p\u03b1qyu\u03b1PC through\n|\u03c6y \u201c \u017c\n\u03b1PC\nd2\u03b1\n\u03c0 F\u03c6p\u03b1q|\u03b1, \u03bey , F\u03c6p\u03b1, \u03beq :\u201c x\u03b1, \u03be|\u03c6y , (10)\nwhere F\u03c6p\u03b1q is uniquely defined for each vector |\u03c6y. Throughout this manuscript, we will use an alternative representation for the resolution of the identity (8) that encodes information about the position and momentum observables. To this end, let us recall the following relationships:\nx\u0302 :\u201c \u03bba\u0302` a\u0302 :\n? 2 , p\u0302 :\u201c ~ \u03bb\na\u0302\u00b4 a\u0302:\ni ? 2 , (11)\nwhere \u03bb \u0105 0 is a free parameter with units of length. The latter can be alternatively defined through \u03bb \u201c ~{\u2118, where \u2118 is a free parameter with units of momentum. Such a definition is equivalent and can be used interchangeably. See [29,30] for more details.\nFrom (11), a relationship between the coherence parameter \u03b1 \u201c Re\u03b1` i Im\u03b1 and the expectation values q \u201d xx\u0302y and p \u201d xp\u0302y associated to the canonical position and momentum operators, respectively, with x\u00a8y \u201d x\u03b1, \u03be| \u00a8 |\u03b1, \u03bey. By combining (5) with (11), and averaging in the squeezed state basis we obtain the symplectic transform\n\u02dc\nRer\u03b1s Imr\u03b1s\n\u00b8\n\u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02da \u02da \u02dd\n1` Rer\u03c4 s a 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 Imr\u03c4 s a\n1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 Imr\u03c4 s\na 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 1\u00b4 Rer\u03c4 s a 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2\n\u02db\n\u2039 \u2039 \u2039 \u201a\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02da \u02dd\nq\n\u03bb ?\n2 \u03bbp\n~ ? 2\n\u02db\n\u2039 \u2039 \u201a . (12)\nNote that, for \u03c4 \u201c 0, we recover the well-known relationships Rer\u03b1s \u201c q \u03bb ? 2 and Imr\u03b1s \u201c \u03bbp~?2 for coherent states.\nFrom (12), one may notice that \u03b1 is linear in the expectation values q \u201c xx\u0302y and p \u201c xp\u0302y. Thus, the complex-plane \u03b1 can be understood as an analogue of the classical phase space manifold as every point pq, pq P R2 is in unique correspondence with \u03b1 P C. Moreover, the transformation from the point pq, pq to \u03b1 given in (12) is determined by a unimodular matrix, and thus the existence of the respective inverse transformation is guaranteed. The differential element in both frames is preserved, that is, d2\u03b1 \u00d1 p2~q\u00b41dqdp. With this identification, we can alternatively rewrite the resolution of the identity in terms of q and p as\nI \u201c \u017c\nR2\ndqdp\n2\u03c0~ |q, p; \u03beyxq, p; \u03be| , |q, p; \u03bey \u201d |\u03b1pq, pq; \u03bey , (13)\nwith \u03b1pq, pq given in (12). It is useful to determine the position representation for the squeezed states, \u03c8tq,p;\u03beupxq \u201c xx|q, p; \u03bey, as it facilitates the determination of some observables. From (7), together with\nxx|ny \u201c p2nn! ? \u03c0q\u00b4 1 2 e\u00b4 x2\n2\u03bb2Hnpx\u03bbq, and using the summation identities for Hermite polynomials [31] we obtain the normalised wavefunction\n\u03c8p\u03b1; \u03be;xqpxq :\u201c xx|\u03b1; \u03bey \u201c p1\u00b4 |\u03c4 | 2q1{4\n\u03c01{4 ? 1\u00b4 \u03c4 e\u00b4\n|\u03b1|2 2 e \u03b12\u03c4\u02da`\u03b1\u02da2\u03c4 4 e \u00b4\u03b1 2p1\u00b4|\u03c4 |2q 2p1\u00b4\u03c4q e\u00b4 1 2p 1`\u03c41\u00b4\u03c4 q x 2 \u03bb2 e\n? 2p1\u00b4|\u03c4 |2q\u03b1\n1\u00b4\u03c4 x \u03bb .\n(14) Alternatively, we can rewrite (14) in terms of the expectation values q and p by using the relationships (12) to get, up to a complex-phase,\n\u03c8pq, p; \u03be, xq \u201c 1 \u03c01{4 ? \u03bb\np1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2q1{4\n|1\u00b4 \u03c4 |1{2 exp\n\u02dc\n\u00b4 \u03c32q 2\u03bb2 pq \u00b4 xq2 ` i Imr\u03c4 s 4\u03bb2 \u02c6 q \u00b4 \u03bb 2 ~ p\n\u02d92\n` ip ~ \u00b4 x\u00b4 q 2 \u00af\n\u00b8\n,\n(15) where \u03c32q is a complex parameter given by\n\u03c32q :\u201c p1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2q ` 2i Imr\u03c4 s\n|1\u00b4 \u03c4 |2 . (16)\nThis parameter diverges for \u03c4 \u00d1 1, which is excluded from the domain \u03c4 P |\u03c4 | \u0103 1. The real part of \u03c32q is a positive definite function in such a domain, so that (15) describes a well-defined Gaussian function, where 2\u03bb2 Rer\u03c3\u00b42q s plays the role of the Gaussian width. The behaviour of Rer\u03c32q s is depicted in Fig. 1 as a function of the real and imaginary parts of \u03c4 inside the complex unit-disk. It is clear that the Gaussian wavepacket squeezes in the vicinity of \u03c4 \u201c 1.\nQuantisation\nWe now proceed to discuss one of the main results of this manuscript, the quantisation map using squeezed states. Although we summarise the results from the one-dimensional case, the results developed here extend to higher dimensions with relative ease. To this end, let us introduce an operation that maps a classical observable fp\u03b1q \u201d fpq, pq, defined in the classical phase space manifold, into a linear operator A\u0302f , defined to act on elements of the vector space H. This a procedure is known as a quantisation map, which requires a complete family of states, like\nthe squeezed states, such that to every classical observable we can associate a unique quantum observable. The map is defined by\nfpq, pq \u00de\u00d1 A\u0302f :\u201c \u017c\nR2\ndqdp\n2\u03c0~ fpq, pq|q, p; \u03beyxq, p; \u03be| . (17)\nAlthough this definition is quite general, in some cases it can be computationally infeasible. To overcome this issue, we take advantage of the coordinate representation in order to compute the action of the observable Af on a \u201ctest function,\u201d which is an arbitrary element |\u03a8y P H. This corresponds to the operation\n\u00b4\nA popq f \u03a8\n\u00af pxq \u201d xx|A\u0302f |\u03a8y \u201c \u017c\nR dx1Kf p\u03be;x, x1q\u03a8px1q , (18)\nwhere A popq f is the coordinate representation of A\u0302f , together with Kf p\u03be;x, x1q, a kernel operator containing information about the action of A\u0302f on the test function \u03a8pxq, determined through\nKf p\u03be;x, x1q :\u201c \u017c\nR2\ndqdp\n2\u03c0~ fpq, pq\u03c8\u02dapq, p; \u03be;x1q\u03c8pq, p; \u03be;xq , (19)\nwith \u03c8pq, p; \u03be;xq the wavefunction given in (15). To illustrate the use of the kernel representation (18), we consider two examples.\n\u201a First, let fpq, pq \u201c q such that the kernel becomes Kqp\u03be;x, x1q \u201c \u03b4px1 \u00b4 xq, where we have used some elementary properties of the Fourier transform while integrating with respect to p. In this form, we get \u00b4 A popq q \u03a8 \u00af pxq \u201d x\u03a8pxq, which means that q \u00de\u00d1 A\u0302q \u201c x\u0302 \u201d x, as expected.\n\u201a Similarly, for fpq, pq \u201c p, and using some properties involving derivatives of the Fourier transform, we obtain the kernel Kqp\u03be;x, x1q \u201c \u00b4i~\u03b4x1px1 \u00b4 xq, with the subscript index denoting the partial derivative with respect to x1. Such a kernel leads to \u00b4 A popq p \u03a8 \u00af pxq \u201d ~i B Bx\u03a8pxq. That is, the quantisation of p becomes, in the x-representation, proportional to the derivative with respect to x, p \u00de\u00d1 A\u0302p \u201c p\u0302 \u201d hi B Bx .\n\u201a The quantisation of fpq, pq \u201c qp follows from the previous two cases, leading to A\u0302qp \u201c x\u0302p\u0302`p\u0302q\u0302\n2 \u00b4 Imr\u03c32q s 2 Rer\u03c32q s . This corresponds to the symmetrisation rule of the operator product of x\u0302 and p\u0302 plus a constant term that depends explicitly on the squeezing parameter. For \u03c4 P R, we recover the conventional symmetrisation rule. Moreover, the operator A\u0302qp is the generator of dilations for x\u0302 and p\u0302. Explicitly, the unitary operator Udp`q :\u201c ei`A\u0302qp induces the unitary transformations Udp`qx\u0302U :dp`q \u201c e`x\u0302 and Udp`qp\u0302U : dp`q \u201c e\u00b4`p\u0302.\nBefore proceeding, it is worth mentioning that the definition (17) fulfills two fundamental properties required by any quantisation mechanism [32, 33]. Firstly, the quantisation map (17) must promote the classical function fpq, pq \u201c 1 into the identity operator I. This is already guaranteed from the completeness relationship (13). Secondly, Dirac\u2019s correspondence rule should be recovered, tq, puPB \u201c 1 \u00d1 rx\u0302, p\u0302s \u201c i~, with tfpq, pq, hpq, pquPB the Poisson brackets [34]. From the previous two examples, it follows directly that rApopqq , Apopqp s\u03a8pxq \u201c i~\u03a8pxq, which fulfils the correspondence rule.\nSemiclassical portraits\nInterestingly, as with the conventional coherent states, we can define a set of quantities that behave analogously to their classical counterparts. These quantities are known as semiclassical portraits [29, 30], which are defined as the expectation values of the corresponding quantum observables A\u0302f in the squeezed states basis. We thus introduce the lower symbol, or semiclassical portrait, as\nfpq, pq \u00de\u00d1 qAf :\u201cxq, p; \u03be|A\u0302f |q, p; \u03bey \u201c \u017c\nR2\ndqdp\n2\u03c0~ fpq1, p1q|xq1, p1; \u03be|q, p; \u03bey|2 . (20)\nwhere the absolute value square overlap between squeezed states is given by\n|xq1, p1; \u03be|q, p; \u03bey|2 \u201c e\u00b4 \u22062q 2\u03bb2 pq\u00b4q1q2\u00b4 \u03bb 2 2~2 \u2206 2 ppp\u00b4p1q2\u00b42 \u03b3 ~ pq\u00b4q 1qpp\u00b4p1q , (21)\nwith the Gaussian widths \u2206q and \u2206p, together with the coupling parameter \u03b3, given in terms of the original parameters by\n\u22062q :\u201c |\u03c3q|2 \u201c 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 |1\u00b4 \u03c4 |2 ` 4 Imr\u03c4 s2 |1\u00b4 \u03c4 |2p1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2q , \u2206 2 p \u201c |1\u00b4 \u03c4 |2 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 , \u03b3 \u201c Imr\u03c4 s 1\u00b4 |\u03c4 |2 . (22)\nA handy formula can be derived for classical functions that depend only on position, fpq, pq \u201c hpqq, in which case the integral (20) becomes\nqAhpqq \u201c 1?\n2\u03c0\u03bb\u2206p\n\u017c\nR dq1hpq1qe\n\u00b4 pq\u00b4q 1q2\n2\u03bb2\u22062p . (23)\nThis may be thought of as a Gaussian regularisation of the classical function hpqq. This is particularly useful when dealing with discontinuous functions hpqq. Further examples will be discussed once we introduce the two-mode extension in the upcoming sections."

As we discussed in Sec. 2, the quantisation map depends on the choice of the family of overcomplete states used, and thus the quantisation for two-dimensional systems can be constructed in a similar vein to the one-dimensional case by implementing families of multimode states, like multimode coherent states, such that they fulfil the resolution of the identity.

(28)\nWe remark that the limit \u03c4j \u00d1 8 refers to infinite squeezing in the j-th mode. The separable squeezed states minimise the Schro\u0308dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation for the physical position and momentum quadratures in each mode independently. That is,\np\u2206x\u0302jq2p\u2206p\u0302jq2 \u201c ~2\n4 ` \u03c3\u0303px\u0302j , p\u0302jq , j \u201c 1, 2 . (29)\nAdditionally, the separable squeezed states admit a coordinate representation defined in terms of the eigenstates of the quadratures x\u03021 and x\u03022 in a similar manner to their one-dimensional counterparts. By considering the linear transformation (27), we rewrite the squeezed states in\nterms of qj and pj so that the normalised wavefunction \u03c8p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, ~xq :\u201c x~x|~q, ~p; ~\u03bey, with |~xy \u201c |x1y b |x2y, takes the form\n\u03c8p~q, ~p; ~\u03be; ~xq :\u201c exp\n\u02dc\n\u00b412 \u01592 j\u201c1\n\u00ab\n\u03c32qj \u03bb2j pqj \u00b4 xjq2 \u00b4 i Imr\u03c4js2\u03bb2j\n\u02c6\nqj \u00b4 \u03bb2j ~ pj\n\u02d92 ff\n` i ~p~ \u00a8 \u00b4 ~x\u00b4 ~q2 \u00af\n\u00b8\na \u03bb1\u03bb2\u2206p1\u2206p2\u03c0 1{4 , (30)\nwhere\n\u03c32qj :\u201c p1\u00b4 |\u03c4j |2q ` 2i Imr\u03c4js\n|1\u00b4 \u03c4j |2 , \u22062pj \u201c\n|1\u00b4 \u03c4j |2 1\u00b4 |\u03c4j |2 , j \u201c 1, 2 . (31)\nQuantisation map and semiclassical portraits\nIn Sec. 2, we showed that the one-mode squeezed states form an overcomplete family of states. This property is inherited by the two-dimensional case in the extended vector space H through\nI \u201c \u017c\nR4\nd2~qd2~p p2\u03c0~q2 |~q, ~p; ~\u03beyx~q, ~p; ~\u03be| , d2~q \u201c dq1dq2 , d2~p \u201c dp1dp2 . (32)\nThe latter can be easily shown by factorising the separable squeezed states into its independent modes and then using the corresponding one-mode results.\nIn this form, the quantisation map is implemented straightforwardly through the integral transform\nfp~q, ~pq \u00de\u00d1 A\u0302f :\u201c \u017c\nR4\nd~qd~p\np2\u03c0~q2 fp~q, ~pq|~q, ~p; ~\u03beyx~q, ~p; ~\u03be| , (33)\nwhich can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the coordinate representation as \u00b4\nA popq f \u03a8\n\u00af p~xq \u201c \u017c\nR2 d~x 1Kf p~\u03be; ~x, ~x 1q\u03a8p~x 1q , (34)\nwhere the integral kernel is given by\nKf p\u03be; ~x, ~x 1q :\u201c \u017c\nR2\nd~qd~p\n2\u03c0~ fp~q, ~pq\u03c8\u02dap~q, ~p; ~\u03be; ~x 1q\u03c8p~q, ~p; ~\u03be; ~xq . (35)\nSince the squeezed states are the tensor product of two one-dimensional states, the quantisation of a classical function of the form fp~q, ~pq \u201c f1pq1, p1qf2pq2, p2q produces an operator factorisable as fpq, pq \u00de\u00d1 A\u0302f1 b A\u0302f2 . In particular, for a classical function fp~q, ~pq \u201c h1pq1qh2pq2q we obtain a simplified kernel of the form\nKh1h2p~\u03be; ~x, ~x 1q \u201c Kh1p\u03be1;x1, x11qKh2p\u03be2;x2, x12q , (36)\nwith\nKhj p\u03bej ;xj , x1jq :\u201c \u03b4pxj \u00b4 x1jq p1\u00b4 |\u03c4j |2q\n1 2\n\u03c0 1 2\u03bbj |1\u00b4 \u03c4j |\n\u017c\nR dqj hjpqjqe\n\u00b4 Rer\u03c32qj s\n\u03bbj pqj\u00b4xjq2\n, j \u201c 1, 2 . (37)\nIn a similar vein, the construction of the corresponding semiclassical portraits follows straightforwardly from the one-dimensional case. That is, by averaging the quantised operators A\u0302f over the two-mode separable squeezed state basis we get\nqAfp~q,~pq \u201c \u017c\nR4\nd~q 1d~p 1 p2\u03c0~q2 fp~q 1, ~p 1q |x~q 1, ~p 1; ~\u03be|~q, ~p; ~\u03bey|2 (38)\nwhere the squeezed state overlap is defined as the product of two one-dimensional squeezed states overlap given in (21). In this form, we may distinguish the following cases:\n\u201a The semiclassical portrait of fp~q, ~pq \u201c hp~qq leads to\nqAhp~qq \u201c 1\n2\u03c0\u03bb1\u03bb2\u2206p1\u2206p2\n\u017c\nR2 dq11dq 1 2hp~q 1q exp\n\u00b4 ~v1 \u00a8S~v1 \u00af , (39)\nwhere the vector ~v1 \u201c \u02c6 q1 \u00b4 q11 q2 \u00b4 q12 \u02d9 and scaling matrix S \u201c \u02dc \u00b41 2\u03bb21r\u2206p1 s2 0\n0 \u00b41 2\u03bb22r\u2206p2 s2\n\u00b8\n. This is a\nGaussian regularisation of the classical observables, analagously to the kernel regularisation obtained in (37).\n\u201a A general expression can be found if we consider a classical function that mixes one of the momenta with an arbitrary function of both positions, fp~q, ~pq \u201c pjhp~qq. In this setup we get\nqApjhp~qq \u201c pj qAhp~qq ` 2~\u03b3j\n\u22062pj\u03bb 2 j\n\u00b4 qj qAhp~qq \u00b4 qAqjhp~qq \u00af , j \u201c 1, 2 . (40)\nClearly, for hp~qq \u201c 1, we recover the expected result qApj \u201c pj . \u201a From the previous two examples, we may compute the semiclassical portrait related to a kinetic energy of the form fp~q, ~pq \u201c p2jhp~qq, with hp~qq \u201c pmp~qqq\u00b41 playing the role of a position-dependent mass term. We obtain\nqAp2jhp~qq \u201c \u02dc p2j ` ~2\n\u22062pj\u03bb 2 j\n\u00b8\nqAhp~qq ` 4~2\u03b32j \u22064pj\u03bb 4 j \u00b4 q2j qAhp~qq \u00b4 2qj qAqjhp~qq ` qAq2jhp~qq \u00af `\n4~\u03b3j \u22062pj\u03bb 2 j pj \u00b4 qj qAhp~qq \u00b4 qAqjhp~qq \u00af , (41)\nfor j \u201c 1, 2. Note that the kinetic term is composed of p2j qAhp~qq, which includes the regularised semiclassical function associated with hp~qq, plus terms proportional to ~2 and ~. The latter induce the quantum effects resulting from the squeezed state quantisation and become relevant whenever \u03bb and qj are around the same order of magnitude as ~ (small-scale). That is, the semiclassical model still accounts for quantum effects in the small-scale, whereas quantum effects are negligible on the macroscopic scale (\u03bb, qj \u0105\u0105 ~)."

            "heading": "3.2 Non-separable two-mode squeezed states",
            "text": "The two-dimensional construction of squeezed states discussed in Sec. (3.1) is the most immediate generalisation of the one-dimensional squeezed states. However, those states are a particular extension, and in multidimensional systems more general states can be constructed which cannot be decomposed into the tensor product of one-dimensional states. Such classes of states have been discussed in the literature for the two-dimensional case by using two-mode ladder operators so that the information of both modes is mixed [20,23].\nIn this section we follow the construction introduced in [20], where a family of two-mode squeezed states are constructed with the aid of the mixing operator\nUBSp\u03c6q :\u201c e\u03c6pa : 1ba2\u00b4a1ba : 2q , \u03c6 P r0, 2\u03c0q , (42)\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum representation of the beam-splitter. In what follows we will suppress the tensor product notation and it will be implicit that the operators labelled a1 and a2 act on the first and second modes, respectively. In this form, we may combine the beam-splitter with the one-mode displacement and squeezing operators Dp\u03b1jq and Sp\u03bejq, respectively, in order to construct the non-separable squeezed states [20]\n|~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y \u201c G|0, 0y , ~\u03b1 \u201c p\u03b11, \u03b12q , ~\u03be \u201c p\u03be1, \u03be2q . (43)\nwith G the unitary operator\nG \u201c Dp\u03b11qDp\u03b12qUBSp\u03c6qSp\u03be1qSp\u03be2q , \u03b1j , \u03bej P C , j \u201c 1, 2 . (44)\nThe order of the displacement and squeezing operators has been deliberately chosen so that the squeezing operators act first on the two-mode vacuum state |0, 0y. This is due the fact that the beam-splitter operator acting on a nonclassical state, such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, produces a non-separable state at the output. Therefore, if we were to act with the displacement operator first, we would get a separable state at the output, as the coherent states are classical in this respect. See [35] for details. In this form, the non-separability of the two-mode intertwined squeezed states is determined by the parameter \u03c6. For \u03c6 \u201c 0, we recover the separable states of Sec.2.\nNow, from (44), we can find the unitary transformation of the boson ladder operators for both the modes, a1 and a2, respectively. We make use of the well-known Bogoliubov transformations [36] to obtain\nG:a1G \u201c \u03b11 ` cos\u03c6 \u02c6 a1 cosh |\u03be1| \u00b4 a:1 \u03be1 |\u03be1| sinh |\u03be1| \u02d9 ` sin\u03c6 \u02c6 a2 cosh |\u03be2| \u00b4 a:2 \u03be2 |\u03be2| sinh |\u03be2| \u02d9 , G:a2G \u201c \u03b12 ` cos\u03c6 \u02c6\na2 cosh |\u03be2| \u00b4 a:2 \u03be2 |\u03be2| sinh |\u03be2| \u02d9 \u00b4 sin\u03c6 \u02c6 a1 cosh |\u03be1| \u00b4 a:1 \u03be1 |\u03be1| sinh |\u03be1| \u02d9 .\n(45) From the latter it is evident that G indeed mixes the modes a1 and a2 where, for \u03c6 \u201c 0, the transformation decouples a1 from a2. The unitary transformation (45), combined with the definition of the physical canonical quadratures (25), allows us to recover the same relationships between the canonical coordinates and complex parameters \u03b1i as in (28).\nThe unitary transformations (45) lead to a set of two eigenvalue equations whose eigenfunctions are the two-dimensional squeezed states |~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y, see App. B for details. In this form, we obtain the corresponding wavefunction as\n\u03c8p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6; ~xq :\u201c N p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6q e \u00b4\u22061 \u03bb21 x21\u00b4 \u22062 \u03bb22 x22\u00b4 ` \u03bb1\u03bb2 x1x2` `1\u03bb1 x1` `2 \u03bb2 x2 , (46)\nwhere N p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6q is a normalisation factor, and the coefficients proportional to the bilinear terms in x1 and x2 are\n\u22061 :\u201c 1\u00b4 \u03c41\u03c42 \u00b4 cosp2\u03c6q p\u03c42 \u00b4 \u03c41q\n2p1\u00b4 \u03c41qp1\u00b4 \u03c42q , \u22062 :\u201c 1\u00b4 \u03c41\u03c42 ` cosp2\u03c6q p\u03c42 \u00b4 \u03c41q 2p1\u00b4 \u03c41qp1\u00b4 \u03c42q ,\n` :\u201c sinp2\u03c6q p\u03c42 \u00b4 \u03c41qp1\u00b4 \u03c41qp1\u00b4 \u03c42q , \u03c4j :\u201c \u03bej |\u03bej |\ntanh |\u03bej | , j P t1, 2u . (47)\nThese depend only on the squeezing and mixing parameters \u03bej and \u03c6, respectively. On the other hand, the coefficients proportional to the linear terms in x1, x2 are given by\n`1 :\u201c \u00b42\u22061 q1 \u03bb1 \u00b4 ` q2 \u03bb2 \u00b4 i\u03bb1 ~ p1 , `2 :\u201c ` q1 \u03bb1 ` 2\u22062 q2 \u03bb2 ` i\u03bb2 ~ p2 , (48)\nwhich have an explicit dependence on the phase-space variables q1, q2, p1, and p2.\nAfter some calculations involving elementary integrals with Gaussian functions, we explicitly determine the normalisation factor as\nN p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6q :\u201c \u02c6\n\u2206\n4\u03c02\u03bb21\u03bb 2 2\n\u02d9 1 4\ne 4 \u2206pRer`sRer`1sRer`2s\u00b4Rer`2s2 Rer\u22061s\u00b4Rer`1s2 Rer\u22062sq , (49)\nwith\n\u2206 :\u201c 16 Rer\u22061sRer\u22062s \u00b4 4 Rer`s2q \u201c p1\u00b4 |\u03c41|2qp1\u00b4 |\u03c42|2qp1` |\u03c41|2 \u00b4 2 Rer\u03c41sqp1` |\u03c42|2 \u00b4 2 Rer\u03c42sq\n|1\u00b4 \u03c41|2|1\u00b4 \u03c42|2 . (50)\nFor brevity we omit the Fock expansion as it cannot be conveniently simplified. Instead, we can use the wavefunction representation to prove that the resolution of the identity is satisfied with a uniform measure \u00b5p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6q \u201c 1. See App. C for details. We thus have\nxr\u03a8|I|\u03a8y \u201c \u017c\nR4 d~xd~x1rr\u03a8p~x1qs\u02da\u03a8p~xq\n\u017c\nR4\nd2~\u03b1\np2\u03c0~q2\u03c8p~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6; ~x1q\u03c8p~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6; ~xq \u201c\n\u017c\nR4 d~x1d~x rr\u03a8p~x1qs\u02da\u03a8p~xq\u03b4p~x\u00b4 ~x1q \u201c x\u03a81|\u03a8y . (51)\nIn this form, the quantisation and semiclassical picture of any function fp~\u03b1q \u201d fp~q, ~pq can be determined in the same way as the separable case because the measure in both instances is the same. That is, we have the quantisation map\nfp~q, ~pq \u00de\u00d1 A\u0302f :\u201c \u017c\nR4\nd~qd~p\np2\u03c0~q2 fp~q, ~pq|~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6yx~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6| , (52)\nand its alternative form through the kernel representation\n\u00b4\nA popq f \u03a8\n\u00af p~xq \u201c \u017c\nR2 d~x 1Kf p~\u03be, \u03c6; ~x, ~x 1q\u03a8p~x 1q , (53)\nwhere\nKf p\u03be; ~x, ~x 1q :\u201c \u017c\nR2\nd~qd~p\n2\u03c0~ fp~q, ~pq\u03c8\u02dap~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6; ~x 1q\u03c8p~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6; ~xq . (54)\nIn order to expose the differences between quantisations using the separable and non-separable squeezed states we consider a few examples. In Table. 1 we consider linear functions on the classical position q1 and q2, where we observe that the separable case produces a factorisable quantisation, that is, for a classical function fp~q, ~pq \u201c q1q2 the resulting operator is the product of the independent quadratures x\u03021 and x\u03022. However, the non-separable case shows that the resulting operator is not factorisable and becomes quadratic combinations of both quadratures x\u03021 and x\u03022. Similarly, the function fp~q, ~pq \u201c qj , for j \u201c 1, 2, the resulting operator leads to a linear combination of both quadratures as well. In the limiting case ` \u201c 0 (see cases above), the resulting quantisation reduces to that of separable squeezed states.\nOn the other hand, the semiclassical portrait is given by\nfp~q, ~pq \u00de\u00d1 qAfp~q,~pq \u201c xA\u0302f y \u201c \u017c\nR4\nd2~qd2~p p2\u03c0~q2 fp~q 1, ~p 1q|x~q 1, ~p 1; ~\u03be, \u03c6|~q, ~p; ~\u03be, \u03c6y|2 .

The same is true vice-versa for q2.\nFrom the coefficients in (58) we can identify two interesting limiting cases:\n\u201a If the squeezing parameters are both equal, \u03c41 \u201c \u03c42, we get ` \u201c 0. We therefore have \u03b812 \u201c \u039e12 \u201c L12 \u201c L21 \u201c 0, and thus the overlap (56) just couples q1 with p1, and q2 with p2.

            "text": "In this section, we apply the discussion from the previous sections to a specific problem. In particular, we focus on a position-dependent mass (PDM) model defined in a classical constrained geometry. Before proceeding with our specific model, we require some generalities in both the classical and semiclassical cases. To begin with, let us consider a two-dimensional classical Hamiltonian of the form\nH \u201c H1 `H2 , Hj \u201c p2j\n2mjpqjq ` Vjpqjq , j \u201c 1, 2 , (61)\nwhich is separable as the sum of two one-dimensional Hamiltonians. From the Hamilton equations of motion [34], we obtain the canonical momentum pj \u201c mjpqjq 9qj , from which, the corresponding equation of motion for the position coordinate becomes\nd2qj dt2 ` 1 2mjpqjq\n\u02c6\nBmjpqjq Bqj\n\u02d9\u02c6\ndqjptq dt\n\u02d92\n` 1 mjpqjq\n\u02c6\nBVjpqjq Bqj\n\u02d9\n\u201c 0 , j \u201c 1, 2 .

In particular, the semiclassical Hamiltonian becomes\nqHp~q, ~pq \u201c 1 2 qAp21rm1pq1qs\u00b41 ` 1 2 qAp22rm2pq2qs\u00b41 ` qAV1pq1q ` qAV2pq2q , (63)\nwhere a general formula for qAp2jhp~qq is given in (41).\nInterestingly, the semiclassical portrait admits a symplectic structure similar to that of the classical model. That is, from the semiclassical Hamiltonian (63), we can determine the evolution of qjptq and pjptq through the Hamilton equations of motion (see [30] for a detailed proof)\n9qjp~q, ~pq \u201c B qHp~q, ~pq Bpj , \u00b4 9pjp~q, ~pq \u201c B qHp~q, ~pq Bqj , j \u201c 1, 2 , (64)\nwhere 9qj \u201d dqjdt and 9pj \u201d dpj dt .\nIn the latter, time derivatives are functions of qj and pj , which, as in classical Hamiltonian mechanics, may be cast into equations of motion for qjptq as functions of time.

Using the latter with 9q, and after some calculations, we get a nonlinear coupled second-order differential equation for q1 and q2. An explicit form will be shown in the following section.\nWe have the general equations to determine the dynamics at both the classical and semiclassical levels. Their solutions are specified by the mass, potential energy, and initial conditions. One may foresee that the resulting equations of motion are in general nonlinear, and we thus have to rely on numerical calculations in most cases."

            "heading": "4.1 Variable mass oscillator in constrained geometry",
            "text": "In order to implement the results obtained so far, let us consider the PDM Hamiltonian introduced in [30], which is in turn contained in the family of non-linear oscillators in [37]. We thus introduce the corresponding two-dimensional classical Hamiltonian\nH \u201c H1 `H2 , Hj \u201c p2j\n2mjpqjq ` V jq2j , mjpqjq \u201c m0 1\u00b4 \u039b2jq2j , V j ,\u039bj P R , j \u201c 1, 2, (66)\nwhere m0 \u0105 0 is the mass and an external oscillator interaction has been added, which can be turned off by fixing V j \u201c 0. Notice that the model is only well-defined inside the interval qj P p\u00b4\u039b\u00b41j ,\u039b \u00b41 j q, as outside of such interval the mass takes negative values. Considering the latter, we constrain the model to be defined only in the physically allowed regions. This is done by implementing a characteristic function \u03c7Ep~qq of the form\n\u03c7Ep~qq :\u201c # 1 q1 P \u00b4 \u00b4 1\u039b1 , 1 \u039b1 \u00af , q2 P \u00b4 \u00b4 1\u039b2 , 1 \u039b2 \u00af\n0 otherwise , (67)\nso that the redefined nonlinear oscillator Hamiltonian becomes\nH\u03c7p~q, ~pq \u201c M1p~qqp21 2 ` M2p~qqp 2 2 2 ` \u03c7Ep~qq ` V 1q 2 1 ` V 2q22 \u02d8 , (68)\nwith\nMjp~qq :\u201c \u03c7Ep~qq mjpqjq\n\u201c \u03c7Ep~qq\n\u00b4 1\u00b4 \u039b2jq2j \u00af\nm0 , j \u201c 1, 2. (69)\nThat is, we have introduced the characteristic function so that the dynamics are constrained to the rectangle defined by \u03c7E .\nIn particular, for a null oscillator interaction, V 1 \u201c V 2 \u201c 0, the equations of motion (62) for the Hamiltonian (66) can be determined in a closed form, leading to the solutions\nqjptq \u201c 1\n\u039bj sin\n\u00a8\n\u02dd \u039bjv0;jt b\n1\u00b4 \u039b2jq20;j ` arcsinp\u039bjq0;jq\n\u02db\n\u201a , (70)\nwith q0;j \u201d qjpt \u201c 0q and v0;j \u201d 9qjpt \u201c 0q the initial position and velocity, respectively. Interestingly, despite the lack of a trapping interaction, the solutions for qjptq describe bounded and oscillatory trajectories, which is reminiscent of the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The corresponding dynamics in the q1 \u00b4 q2 plane is depicted in Fig. 2 for several geometries, governed by the parameters \u039bj , and fixed initial conditions q0;j and v0;j . In all the cases, the initial positions have been placed at the origin, q0;1 \u201c q0;2 \u201c 0, whereas the ratio between the initial velocities,\nv0;1 v0;2 , and the rectangle lengths, \u039b1{\u039b2, have been chosen so that they are both rational numbers. From the exact solution (70), it can be seen that the oscillation frequency in each direction reduces to \u039bjv0;j , and so the ratio of the frequencies is a rational number. This explains the closed trajectories observed Figs. 2a-2c.\nOn the other hand, the presence of the external oscillator interaction prevents us from obtaining a closed expression, and the dynamics cannot not be foreseen a priori. Still, it is expected that trajectories in this case would no longer be closed, as the additional nonlinearities in the equation of motion would break the strict balance required to obtain closed trajectories. Such behaviour is depicted in Fig. 3, where solutions for qjptq have been determined by numerical means. In these figures, we can see that the trajectories keep spreading from the null-interaction case (Fig. 2c). For a large enough oscillator strength (Fig. 3c), the trajectory seems to match the one related to null-interaction case; however, the length of the trajectory shortens. This be-\nhaviour is due the additional confinement produced by the external interaction, which constrains the particle in a smaller region inside the rectangle.\nSemiclassical dynamics\nTo determine the semiclassical counterpart of the classical Hamiltonian (68), we consider for simplicity the case \u03b31 \u201c \u03b32 \u201c 0 in (41). In this form, we obtain the semiclassical Hamiltonian\nqHpq1, q2; p1, p2q \u201c p21 2 qAM1p~qq ` p22 2 qAM2p~qq ` Veffp~qq , (71)\nwith the effective potential\nVeffp~qq :\u201c ~2\n2\u22062p1\u03bb 2 1\nqAM1p~qq ` ~2\n2\u22062p2\u03bb 2 2\nqAM2p~qq ` V 1 qAq21\u03c7E p~qq ` V 2 qAq22\u03c7E p~qq , (72)\nwhere the explicit form of the semiclassical portraits qA\u03c7E p~qq, qAMj p~qq, and qAq2j\u03c7E p~qq are presented in appendix D.\nNote that the semiclassical Hamiltonian qH has the same PDM structure as the initial classical model H, where the discontinuous mass and potential energy terms Mjp~qq and V p~qq have been replaced by their regularised counterpart A\u030cMj p~qq and Veffp~qq (see Eq. (D-6)), respectively. Moreover, the effective potential term Veffp~qq is composed of the regularised truncated oscillator interaction interaction plus a term proportional to ~2, which is a purely quantum correction not present in the original classical model. Interestingly, if both \u03bb1 \u0105\u0105 ~ and \u03bb2 \u0105\u0105 ~ (macroscopic scale), the purely quantum terms becomes negligible and do not play any relevant role in the dynamics. The resulting semiclassical model is still a regularised version of the original one. On the other hand, if \u03bb1 \u201e ~ and \u03bb2 \u201e ~ (small-scale), the quantum term may become dominant. In this case, one may notice that the regularised functions (see App. D) are concentrated on\nspatial regions of the order of magnitude of ~, that is, qj \u201e ~ and \u039b\u00b41j \u201e ~ for j \u201c 1, 2. We focus on the small-scale regime to illustrate the purely quantum terms in the upcoming discussion.\nSince the semiclassical Hamiltonian admits the same classical symplectic structure [30], one may derive the equations of motion as in the classical case. After some calculations, one arrives to\n:q1 \u201c 1\n2 qAM1\nB qAM1 Bq1 9q21 \u00b4 qAM1\n2 qA2M2\nB qAM2 Bq1 9q22 ` 1\nqAM1\nB qAM1 Bq2 9q1 9q2 \u00b4 qAM1 BVeff Bq1 ,\n:q2 \u201c 1\n2 qAM2\nB qAM1 Bq2 9q22 \u00b4 qAM2\n2 qA2M1\nB qAM1 Bq2 9q21 ` 1\nqAM2\nB qAM2 Bq1 9q1 9q2 \u00b4 qAM2 BVeff Bq2 ,\n(73)\nwhere, for simplicity, the dependence of the semiclassical functions on ~q has been dropped out. Eq. (73) defines a system of two coupled non-linear second-order differential equations and it is not possible to solve it by analytical means. Although we have to resort to numerical methods for the generation of the dynamics, we may extract some preliminary information from the effective potential. To illustrate the latter, in Fig. 4a we plot the effective potential (72) initially confined to a rectangular region defined by \u039b1 \u201c 3{2 and \u039b2 \u201c 1. In this case, we see that the potential barrier is much stronger in the q2 direction compared to the barrier in the q1 direction. Thus, we expect that at relatively low energies, particles fired towards q1 would overcome the trapping\npotential and escape the confinement. This reveals that both the initial energy and direction of the particles define the dynamics, contrary to the one-dimensional case, where the energy solely dictates whether the particle gets trapped [30]. The latter is shown in Figs. 4b-4d, where the initial velocities v0;1 \u201d 9q1p0q and v0;2 \u201d 9q2p0q are changed while keeping the initial positions q0;1 \u201d q1p0q and q0;2 \u201d q2p0q \u201c 0 fixed. The shaded area in Figs. 4b-4d depicts the intercept between the effective potential Veffpq1, q2q and the semiclassical energy qHpq0;1, q0;2; p0;1, p0;2q. It thus defines forbidden regions for the particle dynamics. In all cases we can relate the initial momentum and initial velocity by p0;j \u201c v0;jr qAMj pq0;1, q0;2qs\u00b41 for j \u201c 1, 2. In Fig. 4b, the shaded area encloses the particle, and bounded trajectories are expected. In Figs. 4c-4d, the forbidden area does not surround the particle, and both bounded and unbounded trajectories are expected depending on the direction of the initial velocity. In Fig. 4c the particle is directed towards the confining region and we expect bounded motion. However, Fig. 4d clearly shows a particle fired away from the confining region, and unbounded dynamics are expected.\nA curious result of the regularisation is an induced force due to the wall. The regularisation of the wall has rendered it finite and the particle can escape. This is a clear departure from the classical case where the particle is always confined within the restricted region. In Figs. 5a5c, we plot the dynamics corresponding to the setup in Figs. 4b-4d. In Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b we recover bounded motion. In the bounded case, the particle never reaches the classically confining boundary due to the smoothing of the wall. Conversely, in Fig. 5c we see that for a particle fired away from the confining region, its initial energy and direction are enough to overcome the confining potential strength and thus it escapes."

            "heading": "5 Conclusion",
            "text": "In this work we have looked at quantisation in two dimensions using general families of twodimensional squeezed states. We found the dependence of the quantised operators and their semiclassical portraits on the squeezing parameters introduced, and found that in the case where\nthe squeezed states are coupled (entangled), an anisotropy is induced in the resulting operators and portraits. This offers additional control over the strength and direction of the regularisation of discontinuous functions when compared with standard coherent state quantisation. In principle the additional control available may allow one to quantise a theory with more precision than would be available under different quantisation schemes.\nIn section 2 we reviewed a quantisation scheme in one dimension using conventional squeezed states. In section 3 we defined two distinct families of two-dimensional squeezed states: coordinate separable squeezed states taken as the product of two one-dimensional squeezed states, and the non-separable squeezed states which are not separable as a product of two one-dimensional squeezed states. It was found that the quantisation of the classical position functions q1 and q2 led to the expected quantum operators x\u03021 and x\u03022 respectively for the separable squeezed states. On the other hand, for the non-separable squeezed states, the quantisations of the individual classical position functions became linear combinations of the quantum position operators for both modes. In section 4 we applied the preceding formalism to a position-dependent mass model in two dimensions using the separable squeezed states, and studied a comparison between the classical and semiclassical portraits using squeezed state quantisation.\nFor future work, it would be interesting to look at quantisation in non-rectangular confined regions. It would seem that there are a number of physical systems one could approach when one can conveniently regularise confined regions in quantisation problems, such as the hadron bag model [38], and quantum motion on non-rectangular surfaces. The anisotropic effect of the squeezing parameters would allow one to distort the restricted region to obtain semiclassical billiard-like dynamics in non-trivial geometries. Additionally, exploring quantisation in higherdimensional systems should lead to interesting results, the classes of generalised coherent and squeezed states will proliferate and as such so will the ways in which one can quantise a problem."

(B-4)\nNow, by recalling that |~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y \u201c G|0, 0y, we apply (B-1) on |0, 0y, then multiply on the left by G in order to get\na1|~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y \u201c \u02c6 \u03b11 \u00b4 \u03be1 |\u03be1| sinh |\u03be1| cos\u03c6 \u00b4 Ga:1G : \u00af \u00b4 \u03be2|\u03be2| sinh |\u03be2| sin\u03c6 \u00b4 Ga:2G : \u00af \u02d9 |~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y , (B-5)\nwhich, with the aid of (B-3)-(B-4), leads us to the eigenvalue equation\n\u00b4\nA1a1 `A2a:1 `A3a2 `A4a : 2\n\u00af\n|~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y \u201c z1|~\u03b1; ~\u03be, \u03c6y , (B-6)\nwhere the coefficients are given by\nA1 :\u201c 1` sinh2 |\u03be1| cos2 \u03c6` sinh2 \u03be2 sin2 \u03c6 , A2 :\u201c \u03be2 |\u03be2| sinh |\u03be2| cosh |\u03be2| sin2 \u03c6` \u03be1 |\u03be1| sinh |\u03be1| cosh |\u03be1| cos2 \u03c6 , A3 :\u201c ` \u00b4 sinh2 |\u03be1| ` sinh2 |\u03be2 \u02d8 sin\u03c6 cos\u03c6 , A4 :\u201c \u02c6\n\u03be2 |\u03be2| sinh |\u03be2| cosh |\u03be2| \u00b4 \u03be1 |\u03be1| sinh |\u03be1| cosh |\u03be1| \u02d9 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 ,\n(B-7)\nwith z1 \u201c A1\u03b11 `A2\u03b1\u02da1 `A3\u03b12 `A4\u03b1\u02da2 a complex eigenvalue.

Nevertheless, the extra equation provides a compatibility condition that tells us whether the ansatz is correct. After several calculations, it can be shown that compatibility condition is fulfilled, and the ansatz (B-12) provides a valid solution. Thus, after solving the remaining five equations, we get the coefficients\n`1? 2 \u201c \u00b4pp\u03c41 \u00b4 \u03c42q cos 2\u03c6\u00b4 \u03c41\u03c42 ` 1qRer\u03b11s ` pp\u03c41 \u00b4 \u03c42q sin 2\u03c6qRer\u03b12sp1\u00b4 \u03c41qp1\u00b4 \u03c42q \u00b4 i Imr\u03b11s , `2? 2 \u201c \u00b4pp\u03c41 \u00b4 \u03c42q sin 2\u03c6qRer\u03b11s \u00b4 pp\u03c41 \u00b4 \u03c42q cos 2\u03c6` \u03c41\u03c42 \u00b4 1qRer\u03b12sp1\u00b4 \u03c41qp1\u00b4 \u03c42q ` i Imr\u03b12s , (B-13)\ntogether with \u22061, \u22062, and ` given in (47).

The normalisation constant in (49) follows straightforwardly by using elementary integrals involving Gaussian functions."
