    "abstractText": "The widespread use of synthetic plastics, as well as the waste produced at the end of their life cycle, poses serious environmental issues. In this context, bio-based plastics, i.e., natural polymers produced from renewable resources, represent a promising alternative to petroleum-based materials. One potential source of biopolymers is waste from the food industry, the use of which also provides a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to waste management. Thus, the aim of this work concerns the extraction of polysaccharide fractions from lemon, tomato and fennel waste. Characterizing the chemical\u2013physical and thermodynamic properties of these polysaccharides is an essential step in evaluating their potential applications. Hence, the solubility of the extracted polysaccharides in different solvents, including water and organic solvents, was determined since it is an important parameter that determines their properties and applications. Also, acid-base titration was carried out, along with thermoanalytical tests through differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, the electrospinning of waste polysaccharides was investigated to explore the feasibility of obtaining polysaccharide-based membranes. Indeed, electrospun fibers are a promising structure/system via which it is possible to apply waste polysaccharides in packaging or well-being applications. Thanks to processing feasibility, it is possible to electrospin waste polysaccharides by combining them with different materials to obtain porous 3D membranes made of nanosized fibers.",

Challenges related to the wide diversity of materials must be tackled, and opportunities aimed at achieving a closed-loop environment need to be explored [1]. In this context, bio-based plastics, derived from renewable\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6894. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196894 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6894 2 of 13\nresources, are considered a promising alternative to petroleum-based materials due to the insufficient availability of fossil resources in the near future and the affordable low cost of renewable ones that might be consumed for biopolymer synthesis [2]. Therefore, there is a lively research interest concerning the use of natural polysaccharides as renewable sources in different fields, such as tissue engineering [3\u20135], food industry and packaging [6,7]. Besides the relevant advantages from both environmental and economic perspectives, biopolymers are, in general, biodegradable [8,9] and possess favorable toxicity profiles [10]. One potential source of biopolymers is waste from the food industry. Global population growth is leading to an increase in food demand, resulting in companies generating large amounts of untreated waste that is considered of no value [11]. This, in turn, is causing substantial pollution due to the creation of considerable amounts of waste [12,13]. In fact, most of the vegetables produced are processed for fresh consumption or to produce packaged products [14], such as juices [15], sauces [16] and liqueurs [17,18], thus generating many by-products that are used as fodder for animals or for composting [19]. A significant fraction of this waste ends up in landfills or is incinerated [20,21]. The transformation of vegetables represents an important source of profit and an excellent opportunity for the circular flow of secondary raw materials, providing an eco-friendly and sustainable solution to waste management [22,23]. The extraction of polysaccharides from food industry waste is a challenging process due to the complexity of the starting materials and the need for environmentally friendly extraction methods. Recently, green extraction methods have been developed to obtain high-quality polysaccharides with minimal environmental impact [24]. Lemons, tomatoes and fennel are commonly used in the food industry, and their waste represents an excellent source of natural polysaccharides [25]. The extraction of polysaccharides from these waste materials represents a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to waste management while also providing a renewable source of materials for various applications [26]. In this context, the aim of this work concerns the extraction of polysaccharide fractions from lemon, tomato and fennel waste. Characterizing the chemical\u2013physical and thermodynamic properties of these polysaccharides is an essential step in evaluating their potential applications. Thus, the solubility of the extracted polysaccharides in different solvents, including water and organic solvents, was determined since it is an important parameter that determines their properties and applications. Also, acid-base titration was carried out, along with thermoanalytical tests through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Finally, the electrospinning of waste polysaccharides was investigated to explore the feasibility of obtaining polysaccharide-based membranes. Indeed, electrospun fibers are a promising structure/system via which it is possible to apply waste polysaccharides in packaging or well-being applications. Thanks to processing feasibility, it is possible to electrospin waste polysaccharides by combining them with different materials in order to obtain porous 3D membranes made of nanosized fibers [27\u201329]."

            "text": "The use of waste biomass as a source of value-added chemicals is one main strategy for the valorization of a variety of organic residues, like those produced by the food industry. The key step in the recovery of polysaccharides from food processing waste, like the vegetable residues that we selected, is represented by chemical extraction. Chemical extraction can be implemented by means of different methods, including maceration and ultrasound- or microwave-assisted extraction. Depending on the chemical nature of the starting material and on the used techniques, the polysaccharide recovery yield and the gross chemical composition of extracted fractions can vary. As shown in Table 1, various methods are reported in the literature for the recovery of polysaccharides and fibers, and they have been applied to different waste and residual vegetable matrices [30]. The classical\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6894 3 of 13\nmethod, i.e., hot water temperature extraction, affords an average yield of about 6% w/w, while higher yields can be obtained by means of other methods, like those listed in Table 1.\nOn the basis of the results obtained in a previous study [36], here polysaccharide fractions were recovered by means of alkali maceration at room temperature prolonged for 48 h. As shown in Table 2, the polysaccharide yields from the tomato, lemon and fennel wastes ranged from 4.3 to 6.5% w/w; therefore, they were of the same order of magnitude as those obtainable with hot water. The advantages of extracting these polysaccharides via maceration with alkali rather than via the other methods listed in Table 1 are both chemical and economic since such a protocol does not rely on the use of costly reagents and requires less energy. Indeed, the increase in polysaccharide yields obtainable with other methods is coupled with some main disadvantages, for example, a high energy demand in the case of hot water extraction (with temperatures ranging from 70 to 100 \u25e6C) or supercritical fluid extraction; complex apparatuses with regard to supercritical fluids and ultrasound and microwave extraction; and the high economical costs of reagents like in the case of extraction by means of enzymes or eutectic solvents.\nThe extraction yield and the gross chemical composition of the raw polysaccharide fractions obtained from the lemon, fennel and tomato dried wastes are reported in Table 2. For all the polysaccharide extracts, a chemical analysis was carried out by determining the carbohydrate and protein contents in the dried extracts: as reported, all the fractions recovered after maceration showed a high carbohydrate content (Table 2) and very low amounts of protein residues."

In an acid environment (pH = 2), all the polysaccharides were insoluble, showing the formation of a bottom cake after 24 h of mechanical stirring. In a basic environment (pH = 12), we observed a partial solubilization of the tomato and fennel, which was indicated by the coloration of the suspension taking place. The polysaccharide from the lemon proved to be totally insoluble, leading to the formation of a bottom cake. The results are summarized in Table 6. Table 6.

The morphology of the fibers containing different polysaccharides was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (Figure 10). The extract-loaded fibers did not show a different morphology from the neat PVP fibers. In fact, the addition of extracts did not change the gross appearance of the mats, as evidenced by the well spatially distributed fibers. All samples showed homogenous and uniform fibers without beads. The average diameters and corresponding standard deviations were 222 \u00b1 39 nm (lemon), 239 \u00b1 34 nm (tomato), 260 \u00b1 31 nm (fennel) and 395 \u00b1 69 nm (PVP). It was noticeable that, by adding the polysaccharides, the average diameter decreased, especially for the lemon-based fibers. This effect can be ascribed to the charged nature of the extract, whereby increasing the electrical conductivity of the loaded solution with respect to the PVP one led to a decreased diameter of the final fibers [37].

The outcomes of this study revealed that the biopolymers derived from the biowastes of tomato, fennel and lemon are sparingly soluble in all the tested solvents. This led to the idea of using them as materials for the filling, plasticizing or reinforcement of other materials, such as PVP. Thus, preliminary experiments of electrospinning were carried out, and they showed that stable and smooth fibers could be obtained with the three polymers. This paves the way for continuing this experimentation to find out how biopolymer presence prompts the mechanical and biocompatibility features of the produced fibers in the view of possible application in the biomedical field.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.D.D., M.B. and L.M.; methodology, P.D.D., I.B. and M.B.; investigation, T.S. and I.B.; resources, L.M., M.F., M.B., A.P. and P.D.D.; data curation, T.S., P.D.D. and M.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.D.D., A.P., M.B. and L.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, all authors; supervision, M.F., M.B. and L.M.; project administration, M.F.; funding acquisition, M.F., M.B. and L.M.
