 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct pathogenicity and aggressiveness studies on a wider collection of A. solani and P. infestans isolates from diverse geographic regions to better understand the genetic diversity and virulence factors.

2. Use genome sequencing and comparative genomics to identify genes involved in host specificity, fungicide resistance, and other key pathogenicity factors in diverse isolates. 

3. Investigate the molecular mechanisms behind mating type determination and compatibility in P. infestans to understand how new virulent strains arise through sexual recombination.

4. Develop molecular markers for rapid identification and tracking of prevalent clonal lineages and mating types of both pathogens to support disease management and resistance breeding efforts.

5. Explore host resistance genes and proteins that can recognize conserved pathogen effectors and evaluate their potential for developing durable disease resistance in crops through transgenic or gene editing approaches.
