            "text": "When we began writing about the crisis and economic psychological explanations of behavior in May 2020, less than half a year had passed since reading in the media about a mysterious lung disease in China. Data and information did not impress us much in Europe at that time. But when the SARS-CoV-2 virus reached Europe three months ago, we started to panick. Life was reduced to the bare necessities in many countries. Meanwhile, the measures that challenge democracy and plunge society into an unprecedented state of emergency are being relaxed in some countries.\nGigantic changes through the crisis are predicted and no return to the familiar normality. The crisis occupies the sciences \u2013 medicine and biology, philosophy, legal and political sciences, sociology, economics, educational sciences, psychology ...\nWe attempt to describe and understand the experience and behavior of people at the beginning and during the crisis from an economic-psychological perspective and venture a look into the future after the lockdown, when the economic damage will not be repaired for a long time.\nOur goal is to understand the events using theories that economic psychology offers. We strive to provide analyses and explanations that do not follow any political ideology. This attempt may have failed sometimes because it is hardly possible to see the world without \u201cglasses\u201d.\nWe would like to thank our colleagues with whom we were able to exchange ideas in interesting discussions and we would also like to thank Mona Hahn, Ulrich Rasche, Pia and Erwin Kirchler, for their suggestions. We are especially\nviii Preface\ngrateful to Gisela Kirchler-Lidy for her critical reading and numerous suggestions for improvement and to Elisabeth Dorfinger for correcting the manuscript.\nVienna 11. June 2020\nErich Kirchler Julia Pitters Barbara Kastlunger\nix"
