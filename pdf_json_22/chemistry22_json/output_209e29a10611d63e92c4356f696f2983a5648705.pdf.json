    "abstractText": "Over 2.5 million neonatal dried blood spots (DBS) are stored at the Danish National Biobank. These samples offer extraordinary possibilities for metabolomics research, including prediction of disease and understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of disease development. Nevertheless, Danish neonatal DBS have been little explored in metabolomics studies. One question that remains is the long-term stability of the large number of metabolites typically assessed in untargeted metabolomics over long time periods of storage. Here, we investigate temporal trends of metabolites measured in 200 neonatal DBS collected over a time course of 10 years, using an untargeted LC-MS/MS based metabolomics protocol. We found that a majority (79%) of the metabolome was stable during 10 years of storage at -20\u00b0C. However, we found decreasing trends for lipid-related metabolites, such as phosphocholines and acylcarnitines. A few metabolites, including glutathione and methionine, may be strongly influenced by storage, with changes in metabolite levels up to 0.1-0.2 standard deviation units per year. Our findings indicate that untargeted metabolomics of DBS samples, with long-term storage in biobanks, is suitable for retrospective epidemiological studies. We identify metabolites whose stability in DBS should be closely monitored in future studies of DBS samples with long-term storage.",

One question that remains is the long-term stability of the large number of metabolites typically assessed in untargeted metabolomics over long time periods of storage. Here, we investigate temporal trends of metabolites measured in 200 neonatal DBS collected over a time course of 10 years, using an untargeted LC-MS/MS based metabolomics protocol. We found that a majority (79%) of the metabolome was stable during 10 years of storage at -20\u00b0C. However, we found decreasing trends for lipid-related metabolites, such as phosphocholines and acylcarnitines. A few metabolites, including glutathione and methionine, may be strongly influenced by storage, with changes in metabolite levels up to 0.1-0.2 standard deviation units per year. Our findings indicate that untargeted metabolomics of DBS samples, with long-term storage in biobanks, is suitable for retrospective epidemiological studies. We identify metabolites whose stability in DBS should be closely monitored in future studies of DBS samples with long-term storage."

            "text": "Over 2 million neonatal heel prick samples are stored at the Danish National Biobank at Statens Serum Institut and made accessible to researchers worldwide. These samples derive from the population-wide screening for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), which in Denmark has been performed since the 1980\u2019s. All of these samples can be linked to Danish registry data, containing diverse health and social records, such as disease incidence, operation procedures, age, gender, education, or ethnicity1,2 , thus providing extraordinary opportunities for research into early diagnosis and detection of diseases. Metabolomics studies in particular could offer unique opportunities to describe potential metabolic etiologies of various diseases. This could provide clinicians with a retrospective tool to investigate disease onset as well as providing researchers with an opportunity to conduct longitudinal cohort studies. Nevertheless, Danish neonatal DBS have been little explored in metabolomics studies. One question that remains uninvestigated is the long term stability of the large number of metabolites typically assessed in an untargeted metabolomics experiment over long time periods of storage. Blood for neonatal screening is usually drawn from the heel, absorbed onto filter paper, and dried for three hours at ambient temperature before analysis and biobank storage3. Compared to traditional whole blood sampling, dried blood spot (DBS) samples are less invasive and require less sample volume. DBS samples also have a distinct matrix paper composition and are made of whole blood, which, in conventional blood sampling, is separated into plasma or serum and blood cells/clot. Therefore, both cellular and extracellular compounds are present in DBS, offering multiple opportunities for clinical practice and research.\nLong-term stability of DBS samples has been studied to a lesser extent than the corresponding liquid blood drawings, despite being a crucial aspect in order to ensure valid analytical results. DBS samples stored at ambient temperature are prone to considerable short-term changes4. For instance, in a panel of 13 amino acids and carnitine species, storage in ambient temperature for 5-15 years resulted in significant changes in concentrations for all metabolites except valine, ranging from 2-28% per year5. In particular, acylcarnitines appear to be sensitive to degradation at ambient temperature 6. Conversely, storage below -20\u00b0C significantly reduces time-dependent metabolite changes in concentrations in a study comparing the 2-year stability of\nmetabolites in DBS at ambient temperature, -20\u00b0C and -80\u00b0C7. However, only a few studies have studied the stability of the DBS metabolome, as measured using untargeted metabolomics. It has been shown that only a small minority of the metabolome in DBS from rats were unstable during one year storage at -20\u00b0C 8. On the other hand, during storage times up to five years at -20\u00b0C, one study found considerable variation in a majority of 6000 measured metabolite features9. Further studies, investigating longer storage times, are needed in order to confirm these findings.\nIn this study, we used an untargeted LC-MS/MS based metabolomics protocol to identify long term temporal trends in thousands of metabolites in DBS samples stored at the Danish National Biobank at -20\u00b0C from one to ten years."

Putative annotation on the metabolite class level was conducted by combining mass spectral molecular networking (GNPS), unsupervised substructure discovery (MS2LDA), in silico annotation through Network Annotation Propagation20 Sirius+CSI:FingerID, MolNetEnhancer, and deep neural network in CANOPUS. This resulted in chemical class annotation (level 3 annotation29) for 182 metabolites (24.9%).\nTo examine whether overall variation in the metabolomics data was related to storage time of DBS samples, PCA was performed. The first principal component (PC) explained 11.5 % of the variation in the data set and the cumulative explained variance of the first four PCs was 29.2% (Figure S1A). Samples with similar storage time did not cluster according to the PCs (Figure S1B), but PC2 (beta=0.068, p=5.5e-3), PC3 (beta=0.090, p=2.1e-4) and PC4 (beta=0.12, p=1.6e-7) were significantly (p<0.05) associated with storage time in linear regression models adjusted for sex, birth weight and age of the mother (Figure S1C).\nWe proceeded to explore the association between each individual metabolite and storage time. In linear regression models, adjusted for sex, birth weight and age of the mother, 152 out of 731 metabolites (20.8%) were significantly (FDR-adjusted Pvalue<0.05) associated with storage time (Figure 1A) (Table S1). Out of these, 71 were inversely associated with storage time and 81 showed a positive association. Comparing the metabolite levels after ten years of storage with one year of storage, the median metabolite level was on average 0.67 standard deviations higher for metabolites with significant positive beta coefficients and 0.64 standard deviations lower for metabolites with significant negative beta coefficients (Figure 1B). In total, 46 of the 152 significant metabolites (30%) could be assigned to a metabolite class (Figure 1C) (level 3).\nAmong the eight represented metabolite classes, four contributed with more than one metabolite, including amino acids and derivatives (N=17), peptides (N=16), glycerophosphocholines (N=5) and acylcarnitines (N=4). In total, 24 significant\nmetabolites achieved at least a second level annotation29, among which the strongest positive association with storage time was seen for glycerophosphocholine (beta=0.098, p=4.7e-5) and the strongest negative association for methionine (beta=-0.15, p=6.3e-12) and glutathione (beta=-0.18, p=7.7e-11). Overall, 13 classes (with at least two measured metabolites) had no metabolites significantly associated with storage. Among classes with metabolites associated with storage, the proportions of associated metabolites ranged from 27 % (acyl carnitines) to 63 % (glycerophosphocholines). For metabolites without class annotation, 19 % were associated with storage time (Figure 1D).\nMetabolites annotated as peptides or amino acids and derivatives did not show similar temporal patterns within each respective class. All acylcarnitines showed negative associations with storage. For glycerophosphocholines, all lysophosphatidylcholine species were negatively associated with storage, while levels of the head group glycerophosphocholine were positively associated with storage (Figure 2).\nOverall, similar results were achieved when comparing the results from the linear regression models with those from Spearman's correlation coefficient tests, where 141 metabolites were significantly (FDR-adjusted P-value<0.05) correlated with storage time, out of which 128 were significant using linear regression (Figure S2).\nWe next explored metabolite changes upon storage using a multivariate approach implemented in the timeOmics R package27. The optimal clustering was achieved when using only the first principal component (PC1). PC1 was strongly associated with storage time, explaining 81 % of the variation in storage time. The loadings of PC1 were very similar to the beta-coefficients of the linear regression models (Pearson\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.93). For instance, glutathione was the metabolite with the strongest (negative)\ncontribution to PC1 and among the metabolites with strongest association in the linear regression models (Figure S3).\nObserving both positive and negative temporal trends for metabolites, we sought to identify putative transformation pathways for metabolites in our dataset. We found one, and in this putative pathway, an unknown glutathione isomer seems to be formed either by deconjugation of crotonaldehyde from S-(4-oxobutan-2-yl)glutathione or directly from glutathione. This is supported by temporal trends, mass spectral similarities and shared Mass2Motiff. Glutathione (beta=-0.17, P=1E-13) and S-(4oxobutan-2-yl)glutathione (beta=-0.06, P=4.8e-3) are decreasing in levels with longer storage time, while levels of the unknown glutathione isomer are increased with longer storage time (beta=0.09, P=1.8E-5)."

            "text": "In order to study the long-term stability of untargeted metabolomics data in DBS stored at -20\u00b0C, we investigated the relation between over 700 metabolite features and sample storage up to ten years. A minority of the metabolites (20.8%) were significantly associated with storage time, indicating that DBS samples stored in biobanks over an extensive time at -20\u00b0C are suitable for untargeted metabolomics studies. The levels of a few metabolites, such as glutathione and methionine, may be heavily influenced by extended storage time in DBS and should be closely monitored in future studies.\nApplying untargeted metabolomics in prospective or retrospective cohorts has large potential, but also several challenges, including effects of long-term storage times. The plasma metabolome has been seen to be stable up to five years of storage at -80\u00b0C30, given that samples do not go through several freeze-thaw cycles31. Recently, it was shown that among 200 plasma metabolites, only 2% were significantly altered after seven years, but 26% upon 16 years of storage at -80\u00b0C32.\nAs opposed to plasma samples, DBS are usually stored at -20\u00b0C or even at room temperature, emphasizing the need to ensure the stability of long-term storage. A previous study by Li and collaborators has shown that 76% of DBS metabolites in a targeted metabolomics panel were influenced by storage in -80\u00b0C up to one year. The major effect of storage was seen between months one and three, where influenced metabolites on average decreased in concentration to 60% of the original concentration, while small concentration changes were seen between months three and twelve33. There are few studies of metabolite stability in DBS over a longer time span than one year. In a targeted metabolomics study, with several samples collected over two years, alterations in metabolite stability could only be seen in samples stored at room temperature, as opposed to -20\u00b0C7. Rus and collaborators applied untargeted metabolomics in six individuals, who deposited DBS samples each year over a period of six years. The authors showed that 30-35% of the ~6,000 measured metabolite features had a between-sample coefficient of variation (CV) < 20%, while the majority of metabolite features displayed large alterations over time9.\nIn order to best capture the effect of storage, we chose to evaluate the temporal trend in the present study using linear regression models, assuming linear changes in metabolite levels over time. As opposed to the previous study by Rus and collaborators, our investigation showed that almost 80% of the measured metabolite features were unrelated to storage time. Among the 152 metabolites that were significantly associated with storage time, we observed that the levels of around half of the metabolites increased with storage, while the remaining decreased. This is in contrast to what was previously seen during one year of storage, where a large majority of influenced metabolites in a targeted panel decreased with time33. Our finding that around half of the metabolites increase with storage and half decrease indicates that chemical transformations may occur over time.\nTo investigate chemical transformations we combined mass spectral molecular networking, in silico structure and substructure annotation with information on metabolites significantly increasing or decreasing over time. We found a potential transformation pathway involving glutathione, a compound that is previously known to be prone to degradation in DBS samples33. The transformation involves formation of an unidentified glutathione isomer, from glutathione degradation and/or by deconjugation of S-(4-oxobutan-2-yl)glutathione. Moreover, glutathione may also be oxidized to form a disulfide dimer, a process which is well-known in nature, where glutathione is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species34. Our findings indicate that oxidation could contribute to glutathione degradation, since oxidized glutathione is increasing with storage time. On the other hand, glutathione and oxidized glutathione were not inversely correlated with each other.\nAlthough a large majority of the metabolites in our study were not significantly associated with storage, relatively strong associations were seen for some metabolites, such as glutathione and methionine. For instance, our results indicate that the levels of glutathione decrease at a rate of approximately 0.1-0.2 standard deviation units per year, resulting in significant imprecision when analyzing samples with very different storage time. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies where several of the metabolites, which are associated with storage time in the present study, have previously been reported to be unstable in DBS samples, including glutathione33, Sphingosine-1-phosphate33 and palmitoylcarnitine33.\nAdditionally we observed that acylcarnitines and lysophosphocholines were inversely associated with storage time, indicating either residual enzymatic degradation of the fatty-acids or non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the head-groups upon extended storage. Consistent with the latter, we observed that the head group of lysophosphocholines, glycerphosphocholine, was positively associated with storage and a similar trend was seen for free carnitine, although not statistically significant after multiple-test correction. Previous studies display conflicting findings regarding storage of lysoPCs, where two studies in plasma have shown either increasing32 and decreasing30 concentrations of lysoPCs upon storage. In DBS, several lysoPCs have been shown to decrease in concentration during one year of storage33, but some lysoPC species, such as LysoPC C26:0, appear to be stable35. In our study glycerophosphocholines was the metabolites class with the highest proportion (63 %) of metabolites associated with storage time. Decreasing concentrations of acylcarnitines has been reported in several studies of both plasma30 and DBS33 samples, but no evidence of increases in free carnitine has been found previously. It is noteworthy that although we see a negative temporal trend for acylcarnitines in this study, the proportion of altered acyl carnitines (27 %) was close to the overall average (21 %), indicating that the stability may not be worse for acyl carnitines than for other metabolite classes.\nIn the present study, we aimed at separating the temporal effects of storage from biological variation by analyzing neonatal DBS samples, with identical gestational age, age of sampling and birth month. Moreover, in the regression analysis we adjusted for other potential confounding factors, such as birth weight, sex and the age of the mother. Despite these efforts, a residual biological variation may result in statistically significant differences between individual time points that are not related to storage per se. To minimize the risk of false positives, we modeled a linear association between metabolite and storage, disregarding differences between two individual time points. Results from the linear regression models were confirmed using alternative approaches using both Spearman\u2019s correlation tests and multivariate statistics.\nWhen using data from metabolites that are prone to degradation in epidemiological studies, it may be preferable to adjust for storage time in statistical models. In that light, this study can serve as a reference for identifying metabolites whose levels may be in need of adjustments when comparing samples with very different storage times."

Boxplots indicate median, 25th and 75th percentiles for each PC and storage time (C).\nFigure S2. Venn Diagram of number of metabolites significantly (FDR-adjusted P-value<0.05) associated with storage time, using either linear regression models adjusted for sex, birth weight and age of the mother (lm) or Spearman\u2019s correlation test (cor).\nFigure S3. Multivariate modeling of temporal trends found strong association between a principal component of longitudinal changes in metabolite levels (PC1) and storage time (A). The loadings of PC1 were similar to betacoefficients from linear regression models on storage time. Individual metabolites are labeled according to significance in the linear regression analyses (B). The loadings of PC1 indicated that glutathione was the metabolite with the strongest contribution to the clustering (C)."
