    "abstractText": "Objective: Over the years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aim to investigate the role of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs)-derived exosomal miR140-3p in RA development. Methods: Exosomes(exo) were isolated from human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs), and this isolation was followed by the transfer of miR-140-3p. RA rat models were constructed by collagen II adjuvant and respectively treated with HUCMSCs-exo or HUCMSCs-exo carrying miR-140-3p mimic/inhibitor, and expression of miR-140-3p and serumand glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) was assessed. Then, RA score and inflammation scoring, fibrosis degree and apoptosis, serum inflammatory response and oxidative stress in joint tissues were determined. The RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) were extracted from rats and identified. Conducted with relative treatment, the migration, proliferation and apoptosis in RASFs were determined. Results: MiR-140-3p was decreased while SGK1 was increased in RA rats. HUCMSCs-exo or upregulated exosomal miR-140-3p improved pathological changes and suppressed inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis in RA rats, and also constrained and RASF growth. Overexpression of SGK1 reversed the inhibition of RASF growth caused by overexpression of miR-140-3p. Conclusion: Upregulated exosomal miR-140-3p attenuated joint injury of RA rats by silencing SGK1. This research provided further understanding of the role of exosomal miR-140-3p in RA development.",

            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that initially occurs at joints. Chronic inflammatory processes results in bone erosions and cartilage damage, and then induces destruction of the total joint structure (Fatel et\u00a0 al. 2018). Featured by a symmetrical inflammatory polyarthritis, RA affects about 0.5\u20131.0% of the population (England et\u00a0al. 2018), and continues to be the main health burden affecting life quality and healthcare\n*Correspondence: Yuhuachen079@163.com 1 Department of Orthopaedic, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children\u2019s Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, 109 West College Road, Wenzhou 325000, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nresource consumption, especially in low- and middleincome countries, such as Asian developing countries (Lau et\u00a0 al. 2019). It has been found by etiological researches that RA is related to genetic and experimental factors, such as viral and bacterial infection, smoking, sex hormones, sunlight and vitamin D (Rajaei et\u00a0al. 2019). Although the RA patients could be pharmacologically treated, many of them still have symptoms such as pain and fatigue, and RA medications also have side effects (Prothero et\u00a0al. 2018). Thus, it is urgent to find potential biomarkers for RA administration.\nHuman umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs) are an outstanding stem cell type used for allogenic cell-based therapy due to their advantageous ethical access, affluent tissue source, low immunogenicity and rapid renewal property (Yang et\u00a0al. 2020a). It has been reported that HUCMSCs had an immunomodulatory effect on T lymphocytes in RA (Ma et\u00a0 al. 2019). Exosomes are small (diameter of 40\u2013100\u00a0nm) membrane vesicles that released from multiple cell types (Sun et\u00a0al. 2018). HUCMSCs-derived exosomes (HUCMSCs-exo) have all of the advantages of HUCMSCs and avoid their disadvantages. It is also easier to quantify HUCMSCsexo and maintain their bioactivities in preservation and transport (Ding et\u00a0al. 2018). HUCMSCs-exos have been demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis in disuse osteoporosis (Yang et\u00a0al. 2020b), while their impact on RA remains unknown. Exosomes usually regulate the local intercellular communication through conveying coding RNAs, non-coding RNAs, antigen presentation molecules, DNA and proteins (Sun et\u00a0al. 2018). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding short-arm (18\u201322 base pair) RNAs participating in various biological processes via repressing the translation or degrading the transcription of target genes (Chen et\u00a0 al. 2015). Genetic variances of some miRNA genes have been reported to predispose an individual to RA development. For miR-140 variances, Liu et\u00a0 al. have depicted that miR-140-3p contributes to repressing cell viability and accelerating apoptosis of synovial fibroblasts in RA (Zu et\u00a0 al. 2021), while miR-140-3p depletion exerted the opposite effects on RA development (Zhong et\u00a0 al. 2020). Furthermore, various exosomal miRNAs were implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple autoimmune diseases. For instance, the depleted levels of exosomal miR-150-5p can induce exacerbated RA\u2019s aggressive properties and angiogenesis (Chen et\u00a0al. 2018). In addition, the exosomal miR-302d has recently been elucidated to attenuate the pathological consequences of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (Wu et\u00a0 al. 2017). As for the exosomal miRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells, it has been disclosed that serum exosomal miR-146a can regulate mesenchymal stem cells senescence in patients with systemic lupus\nerythematosus (Dong et\u00a0 al. 2019). For the function of miR-140-3p in autoimmune diseases, it has been demonstrated that the abnormal expression of miR-140-3p in synovial fluid is related to osteoarthritis severity (Yin et\u00a0 al. 2017). Moreover, the downregulation of exosomal miR-140-3p has been confirmed in multiple myeloma patients (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2019), while the role of HUCMSCsderived exosomal miR-140-3p in RA has not been uncovered yet. Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) belongs to the SGK1 family and is under the transcriptional control of serum and glucocorticoids (Akhoon et\u00a0al. 2019). It has been verified that SGK1 is an essential regulator of osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation and calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (Schelski et\u00a0 al. 2019). However, the effect of SGK1 on RA and the target relationship between miR-140-3p and SGK1 remain unexplored.\nWe aim to explore the impact of HUCMSCs-derived exosomal miR-140-3p on RA development by regulating SGK1. We hypothesized that the elevation of exosomal miR-140-3p may alleviate joint injury of RA rats via silencing SGK1."

The morphology of HUCMSCs was observed under a microscope and it was found that cells were long fusiform and adhered well (Fig.\u00a01A); the cells were in a whorl-like arrangement when there was a larger cell density (Fig.\u00a01B). A flow cytometer was used to determine the cell surface markers and we found that CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105 were positively expressed while CD11b, CD14, CD19, CD31 and HLA-DR were negatively expressed in the cells (Fig.\u00a01C), which were in accordance with the reported criterion of MSCs (Lv et\u00a0al. 2014).\nThe common markers of exosomes (CD81 and Alix) were detected using Western blot analysis. CD81 is a tetraspanin and Alix is a protein participating in vasculogenesis. Both of the proteins were enriched in exosomes from different sources. Our results indicated that CD81 and Alix expressed in HUCMSCs-exo, but nearly did not express in HUCMSCs (Fig.\u00a0 1D).

In addition, a study has shown that the expression of miR140-3p is related to RA (Ntoumou et\u00a0al. 2017).\nTo explore the therapeutic effect of exosomes and miR-140-3p on RA, we established a rat model of CIA and injected the CIA\u00a0rats with exosomes. The results of RA score indicated that relative to the sham-operated rats, the foot pathology of CIA rats was aggravated; rats that had been treated with HUCMSCs-exo or upregulation of exosomal miR-140-3p had a decreased degree of foot pathology; the foot pathology of rats treated with exosomes inhibiting miR-140-3p was exacerbated (Fig.\u00a02A).\nSerum levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress indicators in rats were measured by ELISA. The outcomes suggested that CIA rats had higher contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and MDA, and a lower level of SOD activity in relation to the sham-operated ones; treatment of HUCMSCs-exo or upregulation of exosomal miR-140-3p suppressed contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and MDA, and promoted SOD activity; the contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and MDA were enhanced while SOD activity was repressed by exosomes inhibiting miR-140-3p (Fig.\u00a02B\u2013D).\nHE staining revealed that sham-operated rats had normal structures of the right postal paw. In the CIA rats and CIA rats treated with exosomes reducing miR140-3p, there were obvious inflammatory cell infiltration\nFig. 1 Identification of HUCMSCs, HUCMSCs-exo and RASFs.

In CIA rats treated with HUCMSCs-exos and exosome conveying mimic-NC or inhibitor-NC, there were partial synovial hyperplasia and bone destruction; the joint structure of rats in the miR140-3p mimic-exo group was improved versus the CIA group and there were attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration and slight synoviocyte hyperplasia were stilled observed and the symptoms were abated (Fig.\u00a0 2E). Rats were scored under a microscope and we found that the CIA rats had higher points than the sham-operated ones, while the points were decreased after the treatment of HUCMSCs-exo or elevation of exosomal miR-140-3p. Exosomes downregulating miR-140-3p inhibitor resulted in higher points (Fig.\u00a02F). The fibrosis degree in rat tibial joint tissues was observed through Masson staining and it was observed that in the sham-operated rats, the stroma and collagen fibers were blue, stained evenly, and gradually deepened\nFig. 2 HUCMSCs-exo or exosomal miR-140-3p attenuates joint injury of RA rats and reduced miR-140-3p reverses the effect of HUCMSCs-exo on joint injury of RA rats.

The tidal line was clear, the boundary between cartilage and subchondral bone was clear, the dense bone and trabecular bone of subchondral bone were blue, and bone collagen was red. In CIA rats and CIA rats treated with exosomes inhibiting miR-140-3p, the results showed that the surface of articular cartilage was rough and missing, the surface cartilage was denatured and unstained, the fibrosis was obvious, a large number of red-stained flame-like processes existed near the tidal line, bone trabeculae was unstained, and the boundary between cartilage and subchondral bone was not clear. The fibrosis degree was attenuated in CIA rats treated with exosomes and exosomes transmitting mimic-NC or inhibitor-NC. In CIA rats treated with exosomes elevating miR-140-3p, the surface of articular cartilage was smooth and there was no obvious degeneration, unstained and fibrosis (Fig.\u00a02G). The fibrosis\u00a0 score evaluation suggested that CIA rats had higher OARSI scores, while were decreased by exosomes or exosomes upregulating miR-140-3p.\u00a0 Exosomes downregulating miR-140-3p treatment led to increased\u00a0 fibrosis score (Fig.\u00a02H).\nThese findings implied that exosomes and elevated exosomal miR-140-3p relieve the joint injury in RA rats, while this effect could be reversed by inhibiting miR-140-3p.\nHUCMSCs\u2011exo or\u00a0exosomal miR\u2011140\u20113p alleviates chondrocyte apoptosis in\u00a0RA rats and\u00a0decreased miR\u2011140\u20113p reverses the\u00a0impact of\u00a0HUCMSCs\u2011exo on\u00a0chondrocyte apoptosis in\u00a0RA rats We further detected miR-140-3p and SGK1 expression using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. It came out that miR-140-3p expression was decreased while SGK1 expression was increased in CIA rats. The exosomes or exosomes elevating miR-140-3p upregulated miR-140-3p and downregulated SGK1 (Fig.\u00a03A, B).\nResults of TUNEL staining and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that apoptotic index (AI) and Bax mRNA expression were increased while Bcl-2 mRNA expression was decreased in CIA rats. Treatment of HUCMSCs-exo or elevated exosomal miR-140-3p restricted AI and Bax mRNA expression while promoted Bcl-2 mRNA expression. CIA\u00a0 rats treated with inhibited exosomal miR-140-3p had higher AI and Bax mRNA expression and lower Bcl-2 mRNA\u00a0 expression (Fig.\u00a03C\u2013E).\nThe above data implied that HUCMSCs-exo or upregulated exosomal miR-140-3p inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis in RA rats, while decreased miR-140-3p reverses the impact of HUCMSCs-exo on chondrocyte apoptosis in RA rats."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that the epigenetic mechanisms of miRNAs have been widely explored, which greatly contributed to RA pathogenesis (Evangelatos et\u00a0 al. 2019). MiRNAs are believed to be the most promising candidate biomarkers among various exosomal cargo molecules because of their high abundance, inherent stability, easiness of sampling and significance as global cellular regulators. The effect of exosomal miRNAs has received wide attention (Hu et\u00a0al. 2019). We performed this research to explore the role of HUCMSCs-derived exosomal miR-140-3p in joint injury in RA, and we discovered that the upregulation of exosomal miR-140-3p relieved joint injury in RA rats by inhibiting SGK1.\nWe assessed miR-140-3p and SGK1 expression in rat cartilage tissues using RT-qPCR and/or Western blot\nanalysis. The results indicated that miR-140-3p was lowly expressed while SGK1 was highly expressed in cartilage tissues of RA rats when compared with cartilage tissues from normal rats. In accordance with this finding, Yin et\u00a0 al. have demonstrated that miR-140-3p expression is reduced in osteoarthritis synovial fluid in relation to synovial fluid from non-osteoarthritis patients (Yin et\u00a0al. 2017), and it has been revealed that the expression of miR-140-3p in exosomes of multiple myeloma patients is suppressed in comparison to healthy controls (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2019). A recent research has clarified that SGK1 is overexpressed in osteoarthritis cartilage (Huang et\u00a0 al. 2020a). MiR-140-3p expression in cartilage tissues from rats that had been treated with HUCMSCs-exo was also determined and we found that the exosomes were able to upregulate miR-140-3p in RA rats. Consistently, Asano et\u00a0al. (2017) have unraveled that exosomal miR-140-3p is broadly amplified in chronic myeloid leukemia patients with musculoskeletal pain relative to those without that pain. We also confirmed the target relationship between miR-140-3p and SGK1 using bioinformatic method and dual luciferase report gene assay, while this relation remains seldom explored.\nGain- and loss-of-function assays were used to assess the roles of altered miR-140-3p and SGK1 in the development of RA, and one of the results of both animal and cellular experiments indicated that HUCMSCs-exo, exosomal miR-140-3p or silenced SGK1 are able to restrain the inflammation response and oxidative stress in RA. In line with this result, Sun et\u00a0 al. (2018) have mentioned that HUCMSCs-exo attenuates inflammation in mice with spinal cord injury, and HUCMSCs-exos have been reported to decrease oxidative stress in liver injury mouse models and liver cells (Jiang et\u00a0 al. 2018).\nFig. 5 MiR-140-3p targets SGK1. A Binding sites of miR-140-3p and SGK1 were predicted by a bioinformatic website; B Target relationship between miR-140-3p and SGK1 was confirmed by dual luciferase report gene assay; *P < 0.05 vs the mimic-NC group; the data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and the t-test was performed for comparisons between two groups\nMoreover, Al-Modawi et\u00a0al. (2019) have discovered that miR-140-3p inhibits inflammation and oxidative stress in human chondrocytes and osteoarthritis models, and it also has been identified that miR-140-5p alleviates oxidative stress in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (Liao et\u00a0al. 2017). Furthermore, a previous study has revealed that SGK1 upregulates the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB, thus stimulating the expression of diverse inflammatory mediators in tissue fibrosis (Artunc and Lang 2014). The in\u00a0 vivo experiments also implied that the apoptosis of chondrocytes in RA rats is decelerated by HUCMSCs-exo, exosomal miR-140-3p or silenced SGK1. Similarly, Chen et\u00a0al. have figured out that HUCMSCs-exo represses bone tissue apoptosis in rats with necrosis of the femoral head (Li et\u00a0al. 2019), and a recent document has unearthed that the upregulation of miR-140-3p reduces IL-1\u03b2-induced apoptosis of CHON001 chondrocyte cells in osteoarthritis (Ren et\u00a0al. 2020). In addition, our research suggested that HUCMSCs-exo, exosomal miR-140-3p or silenced SGK1 has the ability to restrain proliferation and promote apoptosis of RASFs. Consistent with this finding, HUCMSCs-exos have been\nFig. 6 Elevated miR-140-3p restrains proliferation and facilitates apoptosis of RASFs and this effect can be reversed by overexpressed SGK1.

Li et\u00a0 al. (2017) have demonstrated that miR-140-5p constrains the proliferation of RASFs, and it has been reported that SGK1 induces proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts (Gan et\u00a0al. 2018)."
