    "abstractText": "Environmental tritium are natural and anthropogenic origins, the distribution has spread in atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere as a variety of chemical forms. The natural tritium is produced by nuclear reactions of neutron with N and O in the upper atmosphere, the production rate changes with 11-year cycle of the solar activity. The production and radioactive decay of natural tritium is balanced on the whole earth, results in the inventory of about 1 EBq. Anthropogenic tritium by nuclear weapons testing had been released in 1950s\u20131960s, at highest intensity just before the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, and the total release would be 186 EBq. In accordance with a peaceful use of nuclear energy, tritium has been releasing to the environment as airborne and liquid effluents from nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. The release from the nuclear power plants depends on the reactor type. Other sources are the tritium production facility of military purpose and the consumer products that use tritium as luminescent energy and disposed to landfill site. Internal dose is only concerned on tritium due to low decay energy, suggesting tritium concentrations in drinking water and food are critical for dose evaluation.",

The tritium observed in the environment is originated from natural and anthropogenic sources(1). In accordance with the recent increase in usage of nuclear energy, the contribution of tritium emitted from nuclear power stations, nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and other tritium-related facilities would become important as local anthropogenic sources. Because of technical difficulty in tritium removal, most of the tritium in the effluents has been releasing to the environment, tritium is one of the major target radionuclides on environmental assessment around such nuclear facilities. The purpose of this paper is to summarize natural and anthropogenic tritium sources and to show insight of their importance to tritium levels in the global and local environment."

            "text": "Natural tritium is produced by nuclear reaction between the secondary particles produced by galactic cosmic ray and nitrogen and oxygen nuclei of the atmospheric component. The galactic cosmic ray reached to the earth\u2019s atmosphere lost its energy by consecutive spallation reactions and produce variety of secondary particles, such as electron, photon, positron, neutron (n), proton, heavy nucleus and so on and is called air shower, in which neutron induced reaction 14N(n, T)12C and 16O(n, T)14N are major tritium production process(2). Most of the tritium produced is oxidized quickly to HTO and the\nproduction occur in the troposphere and stratosphere, because the neutron in the air shower would distribute from 5 km to 30 km atmosphere above ground. About one-third of tritium would be produced in the troposphere and is immediately incorporated into water cycle in the troposphere. About two-third of tritium would be produced in the stratosphere and has 1\u20132 years residence time of the tritium in the lower stratosphere. The stratospheric tritium descend to the troposphere across the tropopause is incorporated into the tropospheric water cycle. The production rate changes with latitude and is large in higher latitude and low in the equator(3). The natural tritium production pattern is symmetrical in the northern and southern hemispheres. The average production rate of tritium is estimated to be 0.2\u20130.25 atom/cm2/s on the earth and the radioactive decay and production of naturally occurring tritium is balanced, results in the inventory of about 1\u20131.3 EBq(4), however the natural tritium production rate changes in conjunction with solar activity.\nNatural tritium was discovered in noncondensing components from liquid air production plant in Germany(5). The tritium contained in H2 of the noncondensing components was 1 tritium atom/10 cm3 air and it corresponds to 3.7 \u00d7 103 TU if we assume 0.5 ppmv H2 concentration in air. The definition of TU (tritium unit) is the atom ratio of T/H, 1 \u00d7 10\u221218. The formation of HT would be photochemical reaction in air(6). Natural tritium was also discovered in the deuterium water made by electrolytic enrichment of lake water in Norway(7). Based on the enrichment factor of tritium of the\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /rpd/article/198/13-15/896/6694877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ndeuterium water sample, the concentration calculated was about 0.1 Bq/L (0.8 TU). Soon after the discovery of natural tritium, nuclear weapons testing begun to contaminate the environment by release of the artificial tritium to air(8, 9), the data of natural tritium obtained before the initiation of large nuclear weapons testing were limited. The tritium level in water samples were in the order, rain > river water, lake water > coastal seawater reflecting atmospheric origin of natural tritium(2, 10).\nTritium production changes with solar activity\nThe solar wind is a stream of electron and proton released from the surface of the Sun and gives various influences on the Earth\u2019s environment. The magnetic field of the earth deflects high energy galactic cosmic rays entering to the earth\u2019s atmosphere and protects the life of earth from strong irradiation by the galactic comic ray. The solar-wind plasma has magnetic field and is also contributing to reduce the galactic cosmic rays reaching to the earth\u2019s atmosphere. It is wellknown that the solar activity varies with 11-year cycle and the production of tritium changes coupling to the cycle. The number of sunspots on the sun surface is a measure of the solar activity, the increase in the number of the sunspot suggests an elevated solar activity, resulting in larger flux of proton from the sun to the earth. In this situation, the production rates of tritium as well as other induced radionuclides become small by reduced number of the air shower(3). About two times difference was observed on the radiation dose receiving during the continental air flight over the Atlantic Ocean between the solar minimum and the solar maximum(11). A clear change in the production rate was observed on the air concentration of shortlived cosmic ray induced radionuclides collected at the ground level(12). The confirmation is difficult on tritium production(13, 14), this would be attributable to mixing of tritium that supplied past years and back to the atmosphere by evaporation."

Before the sign for the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963 that prohibited air, underwater and space experiments, huge amounts of tritium had released to the environment. The atomic bomb produces tritium by ternary fission of 235U and 239Pu and tritium were released to the environment. Tritium release was much large by nuclear experiments of fusion bomb that utilized fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium to get an increased explosive yield of the device. It is a boosted weapon, DT gases in center of fissile pit cause fusion. The atomic bomb used as a trigger and neutron from DT fusion accelerate the fission chain reaction of the fissile pit. The first fusion bomb testing was conducted in the Marshall Islands in 1952. The total explosive yield by nuclear weapons testing until 1980 was 440 Mt, in which 251 Mt by fusion and 189 Mt by fission(15). The tritium released to the environment is estimated to be 186 EBq(15), the fusion bombs are responsible to tritium release due to much larger normalized tritium release per Mt(16). France and China did not sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty explosion and continued the open-air experiment, the last detonation by France in 1974 and China in 1980.\nThe history and place of open-air detonation was well recorded in tritium data of rain. Tritium concentration in rains collected at Ottawa Canada, Tokyo Japan and Kaitaia New Zealand are shown in Figure 1(17). The tritium concentrations were highest for rain collected at Ottawa (45.32\u25e6N) and followed by Tokyo (35.68\u25e6N) in the northern hemisphere because most the testing sites were in the northern hemisphere, Novaya Zemlya 75\u25e6N (USSR), Semipalatinsk 50\u25e6N (USSR), Lop Nor 40\u25e6N (China), NV (USA) 36\u25e6N and Marshall Islands 11\u25e6N (USA). The tritium concentration at Kaitaia (35.07\u25e6S) in the southern hemisphere was low reflecting smaller contribution of the nuclear weapons testing, the testing sites in the southern hemisphere were South Pacific 21\u25e6S (France) and Australia 20\u25e6S\u201330\u25e6S (UK).\nOf course, other factors would affect on tritium concentration of rain, such as the distance from the testing site, geographical situation of the sampling point, the distance from the sea, and scales and numbers of other local tritium sources. The highest tritium concentration of 1180 Bq/L was recorded at White Horse Canada in April 1963(17)."

Amounts of tritium released vary with reactor types, in which different coolant and moderator is used, though natural or enriched UO2 is used as fuel in all reactor types. Tritium produced by ternary fission of 235U and 239Pu is usually retained within the fuel and is not released to the environment at the reactor site. The release is mostly attributable to tritium produced in the coolant and moderator.\nAverage annual tritium release to the environment normalized to the electricity generated is summarized in Table 2 for representative sites of the different\nreactor types. The tritium release from HWR is large compared to other reactor types. The HWRs at Bruce site Canada(21) and Wolsong site Korea(22) released over 10 GBq/GWh because relatively large amount of tritium is produced in the D2O coolant and moderator by neutron capture reaction of deuterium. The annual release from HWR of different sites in Canada were ranged 124.1 GBq/GWh at Pickering site in 2020(23), 122.9 GBq/GWh at Point Lepreau site in 2019(24), 34.0 GBq/GWh at Bruce site in 2020(21) and 32.2 GBq/GWh at Darlington site in 2020(25). More than half of tritium were released to air from all HWR sites in Canada. Elemental tritium occupies 8.2% of airborne release at Darlington site(25) equipped with the VPCE and cryogenic distillation system.\nTritium discharge from AGR in UK was large and was comparable to the HWRs, 36.0 \u00b1 10.9 GBq/GWh at Hinkley point site and 39.4 \u00b1 15.0 GBq/GWh\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /rpd/article/198/13-15/896/6694877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nType Site GBq/GWh Year\nHWR Bruce, Canada 37.0 \u00b1 3.5 2018\u20132020 Wolsong, Korea 11.8 \u00b1 2.3 2015\u20132020 AGR Hinkley Point, UK 45.4 \u00b1 2.5 1995\u20132006 19.1 \u00b1 4.7 2007\u20132011 32.6 \u00b1 3.5 2012\u20132019 Torness, UK 39.4 \u00b1 15.0 1995\u20132019 PWR Sendai, Japan 3.5 \u00b1 1.1 2016\u20132020 Prairie Island, USA 3.1 \u00b1 1.0 2015\u20132020 LWGR Lgnalina, Lithuania 0.15 \u00b1 0.11 2004\u20132008 BWR Hamaoka, Japan 0.08 \u00b1 0.03 2005\u20132010\nBrowns Ferry, USA 0.86 \u00b1 0.18 2015\u20132019\nat Torness site as an average between 1995 and 2019(26\u201329). Great reduction was temporally attained at Hinkley point site between 2007 and 2011, however it seems that the value is returning to the previous value 45.4 GBq/GWh observed between 1999 and 2006 as shown in Table 2. No such change was confirmed on Torness site. Tritium in AGR is produced by lithium impurities in the graphite moderator and from the presence of water vapor in the core. Water removed by the dryers moves tritium into the liquid effluent. An improvement in the dryer system might be carried out at Hinkley point site because great reduction was achieved on the liquid release.\nIn PWR tritium are produced primarily from neutron capture by 10B, which is contained in boric acid added to PWR reactor coolant system as a soluble reactivity shim. The release was 3.5 GBq/GWh and 3.1 GBq/GWh at Sendai site Japan(30) and Prairie Island site USA(31), respectively. In LWGR tritium is produced lithium impurities in the graphite moderato and the tritium release was small(28).\nTritium release from BWRs is significantly lower than PWRs due to absence of boric acid in the coolant, the BWRs are the reactors which releases least tritium to the environment, <1 GBq/GWh. In PWRs most of the tritium is released as liquid discharge, but airborne discharge is relatively large at BWR site. The fraction of airborne release at Hamaoka site Japan(32) was 56% and Browns Ferry site USA(33) was 89%."

            "text": "During the 1950s, Savanna River Site (SRS) began to produce materials used in nuclear weapons, primarily tritium and 239Pu. After shutdown all the reactors used for production of tritium, tritium-producing burnable absorber rods with LiAlO2 have been irradiated in the commercial light water reactor(36) and the tritium extraction from the irradiated rods are carried out tritium facilities in SRS. SRS is US\u2019s only facility for extracting, recycling, purifying and reloading tritium to ensure performance of nuclear weapons. Tritium discharge from SRS is shown in Figure 2 ranging from 358 to 1546 TBq/y(37) and the total release is comparable to that of Sellafield. Most of the tritium was released to air, the discharge to air occupied more than 95% of the total release, and liquid discharge was relatively small. The elemental tritium (HT) release to air was 3.8\u201315.1% of the total release.\nTritium has been released to the environment under normal operations and some incident events. In 1974 17 700 TBq of tritium (>99% elemental tritium) was released to the air(38). A maximum potential dose to a person (from inhalation and skin absorption) at the puff centerline on the site boundary was calculated to be 1.4 \u03bcSv. In 1975 6730 TBq of tritium was released, 99.4% elemental tritium(39). Over 300 environmental samples were collected and analyzed following the released.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /rpd/article/198/13-15/896/6694877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nTable 3.

It is a generally licensed device may contain up to 925 GBq of tritium and tritium containing EXIT sign may only legally transfer\nback to the manufacturer or an entity for licensed disposal as low-level radioactive waste, however, some signs has been disposed as general garbage. If we assume a million signs were purchased and 925 GBq were loaded per sign, 925 000TBq is estimated at a maximum inventory. Assuming 20-year usage and 1% inadequate treatment gives a few thousands TBq of tritium disposal.\nStudies of active landfills in various states and countries in USA show leachate with tritium, considerably above background(40). The leachate samples collected at 54 landfills in Pennsylvania in 2005 were\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /rpd/article/198/13-15/896/6694877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nanalyzed and the tritium results ranged from background to 6723 Bq/L, with a mean concentration of 773 Bq/L, 16 (27%) of the 59 samples were exceeded the EPA\u2019s drinking water MCL of 740 Bq/L.\nFuture tritium source ITER\nThe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) under construction would be a potential source of environment tritium in future. The quantity of tritium in the whole facility is planned to be equal to 4 kg or less(41), which is comparable to the natural tritium inventory. The ITER facility will need 20 kg of tritium over its 20 years operation, and the tritium from the current CANDU reactors will be available(41). For demo reactor with fusion power output of 1000 MW needs 60 kg of tritium annually, installation of tritium breeding modules on the demo reactor is essential for a self-independent energy source."

            "text": "Environmental monitoring of tritium has been carried out at La Hague reprocessing plant, the largest tritium releasing facility in the world, and 11 400 TBq tritium was released to sea as liquid effluent in 2020 via 5 km pipeline(34). The tritium monitoring of seawater near the liquid discharge point reported that the levels were at most 100 Bq/L, usually 20\u201330 Bq/L(42).\nThe tritium monitoring at SRS showed decreasing concentrations with distance from the site. Mean tritium concentration in air vapor in 2019(37) was 8.8 Bq/m3 at onsite, 0.10\u20130.19 Bq/m3 at site perimeter, 0.09\u20130.11 Bq/m3 at 25 miles away from the site, however most of the data except onsite were below the detection limit. The tritium concentration in rain was 70 Bq/L at onsite and 2.2\u20133.0 Bq/L at site perimeter. Significant increase in environmental tritium level was not observed around SRS in case of the release of 342 TBq tritium as airborne effluent in 2019.\nIn Bruce site Canada 8 units of HWRs with 6526 GWe total capacity are operating and 1470 TBq of tritium was released in 2020(21), 820 TBq to Lake Huron as liquid effluent and 650 TBq to air from the exhaust stacks. Tritium analysis of air followed by monthly basis air sampling of water vapor were carried out and average tritium concentrations trend, 2.08 Bq/m3 at indicator locations, 1.01 Bq/m3 at area near locations within \u223c10 km from the facility boundary, 0.189 Bq/m3 at area far locations and 0.0363 Bq/m3 provincial background location, were observed in 2020(21), typically higher closer to site and progressively decreased with distance. Tritium concentrations in rain showed similar trends as water vapor, 154 Bq/L at indicator locations, 76.3 Bq/L\nat area near locations and 11.9 Bq/L at area far locations, decreasing with distance from the site(21). The rain samples were collected in the buckets for monthly basis accumulation under suffering dilution and/or evaporation. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Independent Environmental Monitoring Program reported tritium concentrations of lake surface water at 10 locations including sampling point near Bruce site in 2019 were in the range of 2.0 Bq/L\u201353.6 Bq/L(43).\nRadiological dose to representative persons living near tritium releasing site is calculated to confirm safety operation of the site based on environmental monitoring data and environmental transfer model. Since tritium gives only internal dose, tritium concentrations in drinking water, food and air are critical for dose estimation. The exchange of HTO and H2O in various water component of the environment is rapid, the HTO concentrations in plants have a biological half-life of a few hours and tend to track changes in air concentration. The OBT formation by plants likely to occur under variable atmospheric HTO concentrations around facilities releasing HTO to air. Variable ratio between the free water tritium (FWT) and OBT were observed(44) and the situation would be more complicated for the case that the facility releases elemental tritium to the air(45) because HT is easily oxidized to HTO at soil surface. For dose evaluation OBT analysis of environmental samples are mandatory. Development of standard analytical method of OBT is necessary(46, 47)."

Since major chemical form of tritium in the environment is water and organic matter, development of monitoring method as well as scientific knowledge of tritium transformation leading to OBT formation in biological processes are necessary. Monitoring and dose estimation should be carried out at proper intervals around such facility because all tritium would be released to the environment through future."
