            "text": "Several of the model testing programmes organised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have included Working Groups specifically focused on modelling of radioactive contamination in urban environments (reviewed by Thiessen et al 2008, 2011, 2022, IAEA 1994, 2012a, 2012b, 2021, 2022, in preparation). One of the areas of interest to these Working Groups has been modelling the dispersion of radioactive contamination from relatively small-scale detonations, which might be relevant for a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019 situation, for example. The availability of data from a series of field tests carried out in the Czech\nRepublic (Prouza et al 2010) made it possible to carry out several modelling exercises in which predicted deposition, based on dispersion modelling, could be compared with measurements of deposition from actual detonation and dispersion events. These field tests formed the basis of five modelling exercises during the EMRAS II (Environmental Modelling for Radiation Safety; 2009\u20132011), MODARIA I (Modelling and Data for Radiological Impact Assessment; 2013\u20132015) and MODARIA II (2016\u20132019) programmes (IAEA 2021, 2022, in preparation). During EMRAS II and MODARIA I, a total of four detonation and dispersion events were modelled, based on field tests at a site in Kamenn\u00e1, Czech Republic, using 99mTc (half-life, 6 h) as a radiotracer. The MODARIA II exercise used a single field test at a site in Boletice, Czech Republic, involving 140La (half-life, 1.7 d). The longer half-life of 140La made it possible to obtain a greater number of measurements over a wider area than was possible with 99mTc.\nFor each of the field tests, the radiotracer was spread by the detonation of a small amount of explosive. The configuration of the radiotracer and explosive for the Kamenn\u00e1 tests was intended to cause the initial dispersion to occur in a desired direction; at Boletice, the detonation was not constrained, and dispersion occurred in all directions. The field tests occurred in open areas, with and without simulated small buildings in anticipated downwind directions. Both test areas were selected for stable wind conditions under typical meteorological conditions, and key meteorological data were collected before and during the dispersion events. Initial conditions for each of the field tests are summarised in sections 1.1 and 1.2 and full details are available in the reports of the IAEAWorking Groups (IAEA 2021, 2022, in preparation).\nMeasurements obtained for the field tests included dose rates, surface contamination of ground and structures (buildings), activity concentrations in air, particle size distribution, time distribution of dust particles in air and thermo-camera snapshots to record changes in infrared radiation. Video recordings of the detonations were obtained from several vantage points.\nParticipants in the exercises were asked to predict the surface contamination (Bq m\u22122) as a function of distance from the detonation site, dose rates (mGy h\u22121, at 1 m height) as a function of distance from the detonation site and time-integrated activity concentrations in air (Bq m\u22123 min) as a function of height and distance along the centreline of the plume. For each of the five events modelled, the input information provided to participants included the arrangement of detectors and other equipment near the detonation site, time-dependent meteorological data (e.g. wind speed and direction) and the amount of radioactivity involved (tables 1 and 2). Full data (input information plus the resulting measurements of surface contamination, dose rates and time-integrated activity concentrations in air) from two earlier field tests at Kamenn\u00e1 were provided to the participants for use in calibration of models, if desired. Based on one of these earlier field tests, suggested values for particle size distributions, aerosol diameters and deposition velocities were made available to participants. Estimates of column (cloud) dimensions were made from video recordings of each event.\nThe exercises were carried out as blind tests: only the input information was provided to participants, and comparisons of predictions with measurements were made only after the modelling results had been submitted. Although several endpoints were modelled, the analysis of the results focused primarily on predictions of surface contamination (deposition) (IAEA 2021, 2022, in preparation), and this paper is limited to discussion of predicted surface contamination.\nIn addition to the modelling exercises described in this paper, data sets from these field tests can also be used for validation of location factors, data assimilation to improve initial modelling results and estimation of a source term based on measurements. For example, Urso et al (2014) used surface activity from one of the Kamenn\u00e1 field tests with the HotSpot 2.07.1 model to predict the source term."

            "text": "The first sets of field tests were carried out in 2007\u20132010 by the Czech National Radiation Protection Institute (SU\u0301RO) at a test area belonging to the National Institute for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Protection in Kamenn\u00e1, near Prague (figure 1). The detonations were performed in an open field (flat terrain), with and without simulated small buildings. A combined booby-trap explosive system was selected, with the dispersion directed in a pre-selected direction. A set of four steel plates (bottom, back wall, two side walls) surrounded by sandbags was used to direct the release in the expected wind direction at an angle of about 30\u25e6 to the horizontal (Prouza et al 2010). Each test used either 1 or 2 GBq of 99mTc (as NaTcO4 in 0.9% NaCl liquid solution); 99mTc has an easily detected gamma energy and a short radioactive half-life (6 h). Filters to collect deposition were distributed over a surface area of approximately 50 m\u00d7 40 m in the anticipated direction of the dispersion. Deposition occurred during the first few minutes after the dispersion (Prouza et al 2010). Summary information for the four Kamenn\u00e1 tests considered in the EMRAS II and MODARIA I programmes is provided in table 1; the meteorological conditions for the tests are summarised in table 2.\nFigure 1.

            "text": "Table 3 provides a summary of the models used by participants in these five exercises. Participants volunteered to be involved in the programmes, and most used institutional or off-the-shelf models for these exercises. The models represented three main types of computational approaches to modelling atmospheric dispersion (Gaussian, Lagrangian and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)) and were developed for a variety of purposes, including research, emergency response and decision support (table 3).\nEight models in total were used during the three programmes (EMRAS II, MODARIA I and II). Over the course of these programmes, three participants used the HotSpot model, and three versions of that model were used. During the third programme, the LASAIR model was used by two participants. In all, the EMRAS II exercises included eight participants with seven models, the MODARIA I exercises included three participants with three models and the MODARIA II exercise included three participants with two models. In a few cases it was possible to compare results from two participants using the same model, or from one participant using two models. Tables 4\u20136 provide summaries of the key parameters and approaches used by participants in each exercise or pair of exercises.\nFor column dimensions, source partitioning within the column and particle size distributions, individual participants chose whether to use suggested values (e.g. based on earlier field tests), default values in their models or information from other sources.

Sections 4\u20136 summarise the results of the EMRAS II, MODARIA I and MODARIA II exercises, respectively. The meteorological situations during the field tests are described, followed by a summary of the modelling results and relevant discussion. Details of the analysis for each exercise are described in the Working Group reports (IAEA 2021, 2022, in preparation).\nUsing the set of grid coordinates corresponding to the measurement locations for each field test, the set of measurements and each set of model predictions was interpolated using a multilevel B-spline interpolation method (Lee et al 1997) with SAGA GIS13 software (for the Kamenn\u00e1 tests, grid north was 68\u25e6 east of true north). This approach facilitated the characterisation of the measured or predicted deposition (both the dispersion pattern and the degree of contamination) in the entire grid area, as opposed to only at the measurement points.\nThe contour plots in the figures for each exercise use the same coordinate system and colour scale, thereby enabling a visual comparison of the two-dimensional measured or predicted deposition. The maximum measured and predicted depositions (Bq m\u22122, with the coordinates of the location) are summarised in tables for each of the respective field tests, along with the total measured and predicted activity deposited in the grid area (MBq) for each field test."

For the first of these (5 May 2009), the wind direction after the detonation was relatively stable, although the wind speed varied from about 1 to 3.5 m s\u22121. Due to the stable wind direction, the plume generally went in a straight line. However, for the later test (14 July 2009), the detonation was followed by periods of no wind and very low wind speed and with considerable variation in wind direction. Therefore, the plume did not go in the anticipated direction toward the measurement equipment."

Tables 7 and 8 summarise the maximum measured and predicted deposition (Bq m\u22122) for each of the field tests, and the total measured and predicted activity deposited in the grid area (MBq) for each field test.\nFor the first test (5 May 2009), the measurements indicated that deposition occurred primarily to the grid north, while the model predictions ranged from northwest to northeast. The predicted total activity deposited within the grid area ranged from 1.8 to 730 MBq (measured, 36 MBq). The predicted maximum deposition ranged from 1.3 \u00d7 103 to 1.0 \u00d7 106 Bq m\u22122 (measured, 1.4 \u00d7 106 Bq m\u22122). The plume during this test went almost straight down the y-axis of the grid, while most of the predicted plumes were displaced to one side or the other of the y-axis (figure 5). The HotSpot 2.07.01 model, with two different users, produced both the lowest and highest predictions for the total activity deposited within the grid area, about a factor of 20 on either side of the measured value. These two modellers used different assumptions for the wind speed, dry deposition velocity and partitioning of the source term. In contrast, predictions from three models (RDD_MMC, University of Seville and LASAIR) were within a factor of 2 of the measured total activity within the grid area, in spite of some differences in the parameterisation of their models.\nFor the second test (14 July 2009), the measurements indicated deposition initially to the grid northwest and then to the grid southwest, i.e. the plume was not stable in direction. Model predictions ranged from northwest to west, southwest and south, suggesting that the models could not fully reproduce the effect of an unstable plume direction. The predicted total activity deposited within the grid area ranged from 5.8 MBq to 3.4 \u00d7 106 MBq (measured, 2.3 MBq). The maximum predicted deposition ranged from 3.8 \u00d7 103 Bq m\u22122 to 5.6 \u00d7 109 Bq m\u22122 (measured, 1.9 \u00d7 104 Bq m\u22122).

Measurements were taken at a height of 2 m.\nexception, HotSpot 2.07.01, does not actually account for plume direction. All predicted values of total activity deposited within the grid area exceeded the measured value, although several values (generated using CFD, CLMM and HotSpot 2.07.01 as used by Trifunovi\u0301c) were within a factor of four of the measured value. As in the earlier test, the assumptions about dry deposition velocity and source term partitioning appear to have been important in explaining differences in predictions."

            "text": "The EMRAS II exercises involved three main computational types of dispersion models. The Gaussian models used averaged meteorological data, while two of the Lagrangian models (University of Seville, LASAIR) used time-dependent meteorological data, corresponding to transient wind conditions. Appropriate handling of wind speed, and especially wind direction, is essential for obtaining good model predictions; in particular, use of averaged input data can cause errors in a simulation when there are rapid changes in wind direction.\nThe second exercise (14 July 2009) was more complicated than the first (5 May 2009) for at least two reasons. The second test had periods with no wind or very low wind speeds; these conditions are much more difficult to simulate, especially since models are generally validated for higher wind speeds. In addition, the two simulated small buildings in the grid area during the later test may have affected the plume behaviour by acting as obstacles to the wind flow. The wind measurements for these field tests were obtained at a height of\nFi gu re 5.

The measuring equipment was located 20 m behind the dispersion point (grid coordinates (0, \u221220)). As seen in the figures, the meteorological conditions were not homogeneous for either of these field tests.\nIn the first of these tests (4 May 2010) the wind speed was 1.8 m s\u22121 at the time of the detonation, dropping below 1 m s\u22121 about 2 min later, increasing significantly to 3.6 m s\u22121 for about 2 min and then falling to an average of 1.5 m s\u22121. The wind direction was steady at about 90\u25e6 for about 8 min after the detonation, followed by two peaks (270\u25e6 and 0\u25e6) then becoming steady at about 90\u25e6 once again.\nIn the second test (22 June 2010), the wind speed fell from about 2.2 m s\u22121 at the time of the detonation to 1.4 m s\u22121, and then varied between 0.4 and 3.1 m s\u22121 during the next 12 min. The wind direction varied even more widely, changing from 270\u25e6 to 0\u25e6 and back within the first 2 min, changing counterclockwise from 270\u25e6 to 20\u25e6 during the next 8 min, and then coming back to 270\u25e6 for the next 4 min.

Tables 9 and 10 summarize the maximum measured and predicted deposition (Bq m\u22122) for each of the respective field tests, and the total measured and predicted activity deposited in the grid area (MBq) for each field test.\nFor the first test (4 May 2010), the measurements indicated deposition largely to the grid east, with an early component to the north and a later component to the south (figure 9). In contrast, the models predicted the primary deposition to west-northwest, south-southwest and southeast (the last looks like dispersion to the south-southwest, but displaced to the east of the dispersion point.). The predicted total activity deposited within the grid area ranged from 67 MBq to 334 MBq (measured, 202 MBq). The predicted maximum deposition ranged from 5.9\u00d7 105 Bq m\u22122 to 1.4\u00d7 106 Bq m\u22122 (measured, 2.1\u00d7 106 Bq m\u22122). For the total activity deposited within the grid, one prediction (URD, developed by the DTU) was very close to the measured value, while the other two predictions were about a factor of 3 lower\n(LASAIR) or 1.6 higher (ADDAM/CSA-ERM). For the maximum deposited activity, model predictions ranged from about 30% to 70% of the measured value.\nFor the second test (22 June 2010), two models (ADDAM/CSA-ERM and LASAIR) predicted the general direction of the highest-concentration portion of the plume reasonably well (figure 10), in spite of the large fluctuations in wind direction. The third model (URD) also predicted the general direction of the plume, although the predicted location of highest concentration differed from the measurements. The predicted total activity deposited within the grid area ranged from 123 MBq to 382 MBq (measured, 38 MBq). The predicted maximum deposition ranged from 5.3\u00d7 105 Bq m\u22122 to 6.4\u00d7 105 Bq m\u22122 (measured, 9.6\u00d7 105 Bq m\u22122). For the total activity deposited within the grid, the predictions ranged from 3 to 10 times higher than the measured value. For the maximum deposited activity, model predictions ranged from about 55% to 70% of the measured value. Although the predicted maximum values for deposited activity were less than the measured maximum value, the predicted values for total activity deposited within the grid area were larger than the measured value, probably due to larger areas predicted to be affected by the plume than, in fact, was the case."

For the first test (4 May 2010), the models did not reproduce the effect of the unstable plume (figure 9). For the second test (22 June 2010), two models (ADDAM/CSA-ERM and LASAIR) predicted the highest concentration portion of the plume reasonably well (figure 10), in spite of the large fluctuations in wind direction.\nThe three models used in these exercises (ADDAM/CSA-ERM, LASAIR and URD) differed in computational type (Gaussian or Lagrangian), handling of meteorological data (use of averaged or time-dependent data), dry deposition velocity, atmospheric stability class and other assumptions (tables 3 and 5). These differences are likely to explain the differences in the model predictions. For example, the ADDAM/CSA-ERMmodel gave the highest values for predicted deposition in the exercises (tables 9 and 10), consistent with its use of the highest value for dry deposition velocity (table 5). More details on the possible reasons for differences between models are provided in the Working Group 2 report (IAEA 2021)."

Table 11 summarizes the maximum measured and predicted deposition (Bq m\u22122) for the field test and the total measured and predicted activity deposited in the grid area (MBq) for the field test.\nThe measurements indicated deposition largely to the grid southeast (figure 12). Both sets of predictions using LASAIR showed a similar direction of the plume, as did the HotSpot 3.1 prediction by Mancini and the second HotSpot 3.0.3 prediction by Charnock. The first prediction by Charnock showed the plume going to\nthe northeast; the second prediction included an adjustment to the timing of the meteorological data to allow for the distance (110 m) between the meteorological station and the dispersion point, resulting in the predicted plume going to the southeast, similar to the other model predictions. As shown in table 6, the two sets of HotSpot 3.0.3 predictions by Charnock varied only in the wind speed and direction used for the calculations. Walter adjusted the timing of the meteorological data by 2 min to allow for the distance between the meteorological station and the dispersion point. Mancini, based on observations from the videos of the event, adjusted the reported wind directions by 45\u25e6 to account for differences between the meteorological station and the dispersion point.\nThe total activity deposited within the grid area, as predicted by two users of LASAIR, ranged from 73.8 MBq to 200 MBq (measured, 41.3 MBq), exceeding the measured value by factors of 1.8 (Walter) and 4.8 (Mancini). Total deposited activity was not calculated for the HotSpot predictions, since the predictions did not include all of the grid area.\nThe predicted maximum deposition ranged from 9.0\u00d7 103 Bq m\u22122 to 5.4\u00d7 106 Bq m\u22122 (measured, 8.6\u00d7 105 Bq m\u22122).

The results of the exercise included predictions from two participants using the same model (Walter and Mancini using LASAIR), two participants using different versions of the same model (Charnock using HotSpot 3.0.3 and Mancini using HotSpot 3.1) and one participant using two models (Mancini using HotSpot 3.1 and LASAIR). For HotSpot 3.0.3 and 3.1, Charnock and Mancini differed in their choice of atmospheric stability class, particle size distribution and height of the cloud top (table 6). Charnock\u2019s second prediction used wind speed and direction similar to those used by Mancini. For LASAIR, Walter and Mancini differed in their choice of atmospheric stability class, range of wind directions, and particle size distribution.\nFor both the HotSpot 3.1 and LASAIR models, Mancini manually shifted the wind directions by 45\u25e6 to match the observations from the videos of the detonation. Walter and Charnock also modified the wind data, Walter by adjusting the timing of the meteorological data by 2 min and Charnock by selecting average values for wind speed and direction, with the latter being consistent with the observed direction of the plume. In the previous exercises, the meteorological station was located 20 m or less from the dispersion point; in this exercise it was 110 m from the dispersion point. All three participants adjusted for this distance, either by delaying time-dependent data (Walter, Charnock) or adjusting the angle to match observations from videos (Mancini), and all with reasonable success. This finding suggests the importance of having meteorological data as close as possible to the dispersion point, or adjusted for the distance between them. It also suggests\nFigure 12.

Mancini\u2019s predictions using two models differed from each other by a factor of about 3, consistent with the same input assumptions being used for both models."

            "text": "The field tests described in this paper presented several challenges to participants in the modelling exercises. The exercises involved prediction of spatially varying deposition (surface activity concentration) using time-dependent wind conditions. The detonations themselves were not modelled directly in any of the exercises; participants started with the initial cloud or plume. In some exercises, participants were provided with a suggested set of default cloud dimensions and partitioning of the source term within the cloud, but often the characterizations of the initial cloud differed between modellers.\nModel results varied, sometimes considerably, in the predicted directions of plumes for a given test, as seen in the contour plots (figures 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12). Predicted amounts of deposited activity also varied widely in some cases, although for any given exercise some of the predictions were reasonably close to the measurements. A number of factors potentially contribute to differences in model predictions, as follows:\nThree different computational approaches were used in these exercises, including Gaussian models, Lagrangianmodels andCFDmodels. TheGaussian approach has been applied successfully inmany applications, but it is best suited for long-term releases and dispersion rather than the short-term release and dispersion considered in these exercises. CFD models can produce the highest accuracy for a simulation of dispersion following an instantaneous release, but they require considerable computing time. Lagrangian particle models typically do better than Gaussian models for short-term releases and dispersion, and typically offer the best balance between effort and accuracy, especially for emergencyresponse use. Some models were intended for grid or domain sizes larger or smaller than those used in the experiments. Values for dry deposition velocity, atmospheric stability class, dimensions of the initial cloud, particle size\ndistribution and distribution of the activity within the initial cloud varied between participants, but were intended to be as close as possible to the real situation, depending on the particular model\u2019s capabilities. Detailed evaluation of parameter sensitivity for the various models is beyond the scope of these modelling exercises. Use of average versus time-dependent wind speeds and directions varied between models. In addition, selections of values for wind speed and direction varied between participants.\nUncertainty in model predictions may be due to uncertainty in input data or to model uncertainty; model uncertainty includes both the computational approach (model numerics) and model parameters. Different approaches may be used to evaluate key parameters for important processes (e.g. diffusion coefficients for turbulence), and different approaches may therefore lead to different model results. Some parameters may require site-specific information or calibration, which may not always be possible. Numerical solutions require temporal or spatial discretization (or both), and generally provide approximations to the real solution. In these exercises, models with different complexities and parameters were used to calculate radionuclide deposition on the ground, and differences in the model predictions are reasonably expected. While it is often assumed that if two models give similar results for some particular application, the simpler model is better than the complex model, Monte et al (2006) have pointed out that this assumption should be avoided. A simple model might not be sufficiently developed for application to the range of possible cases and circumstances that more complex and general models (i.e. more flexible models) are able to simulate.\nFor the Boletice exercise, participants compensated one way or another for the distance between the meteorological station and the dispersion point. This might not have mattered for the Kamenn\u00e1 exercises, for which the meteorological stations were much closer to the dispersion point (20 m or less), but it could be very important for other dispersion events, particularly unplanned events with only regional meteorological data available. These exercises involved a very small modelling domain, with the wind and turbulence assumed to be uniform in the horizontal plane; for larger domains, more detailed consideration of the wind and turbulence fields would be appropriate.\nThis set of field tests, at both the Boletice and Kamenn\u00e1 sites, demonstrated the need for the proper application of models in the context of existing physical effects (e.g. the detonations); in such cases, the models must be able to handle microscale conditions. In addition, these exercises were a first approach to simulate dispersion after an explosion for civilian experiments, and the results have been useful to improve the layout of such experiments, for example positioning of the meteorological stations.\nVisual comparison of contour plots of measured and predicted deposition, using the same coordinate system and colour scale, provided a useful method for overall comparison of measurements and model predictions for a given field test. In some cases, the contour plot of the measurements indicated that the plume was not stable in direction during the deposition event; models generally were not able to fully reproduce the effect of an unstable plume direction.\nComparison of modelling results among participants and with the measurements provided an invaluable opportunity to discuss and explain differences in modelling approaches and the influence of the selection of parameter values on model predictions, with an opportunity to improve the models and how they are applied. These relatively simple models are able to give reasonably realistic results, quickly, and without requiring large numbers of input data that may be difficult or impossible to obtain."
