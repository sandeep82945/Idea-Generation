            "text": "Injuries to the shoulder and elbow are commonplace in the athletic population and regularly occur in both contact and non-contact sports. In contact and collision sports such as American football, rugby, hockey and soccer, the shoulder accounts for up to 20% of all injuries, most commonly acromioclavicular joint sprains and glenohumeral instability.1\u20135 In college athletes attending the National Football League (NFL) combine, reported prevalence of previous shoulder injuries is 50-52%.1,6 In overhead sports such as baseball, softball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, and water polo, the shoulder accounts for 17-35% of all musculoskeletal injuries, most commonly involving labral and rotator cuff pathology.7\u201311 In baseball and softball athletes alone, elbow injury is also a significant source of disability accounting for up to 22% of injuries.12\u201314 Despite high upper extremity injury rates, athletes often seek care with the goal of returning to sport and pre-injury levels of performance.\nThe proportion of athletes who are successfully able to return to sport following upper extremity injury varies based on the injury type and surgical status. In athletes with shoulder instability, 40-88% of athletes managed nonoperatively15\u201317 and 86-90% managed with surgical stabilization were able to successfully return to sport.18,19 However, only 50-73% of athletes return to sport at their previous level following surgical intervention.18,19 When considering overhead athletes with ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries, 85-93% of athletes managed non-operatively and 75-100% of athletes managed with surgical reconstruction were able to successfully return to sport.20\u201322 However, only 84-93% of athletes managed non-operatively and 63-90% of those managed surgically returned to their previous level of competition.20\u201322\nRecurrence rates for upper extremity injuries vary based on injury type and surgical status as well. The rate of reinjury after shoulder stabilization surgery has been found to be as high as 23%, but can be reduced to 10% with a comprehensive rehabilitation program.18,23,24 Following UCL reconstruction, revision rates are ultimately low (1-7%) but in a study following the outcomes of 147 athletes after UCL reconstruction, 26% of athletes returned to the injured list at some point in their career due to additional elbow injuries.25,26 These varied and less-than-ideal outcomes in return to sport and reinjury rates may be driven, in part, by the absence of an evidence-informed battery of tests used to determine an athlete\u2019s physical performance and readi-\nness for sport, ultimately resulting in athletes returning to sport before they achieve full physical performance of the involved upper extremity and kinetic chain.23,27\nPhysical performance tests, defined as assessments in which an athlete performs a physical task believed to be a component of a sports activity, can provide insight into an athlete\u2019s readiness for return to sport.28 In athletes recovering from lower extremity injuries, the passing of physical performance tests (e.g., hop testing, agility testing) has been found to be effective in decreasing reinjury.29\u201332 However, current evidence on return to sport outcomes following upper extremity injury is comparatively lacking and limited to case series and clinical commentary.23,33 It is possible that this lack of outcomes research on the utility of upper extremity physical performance tests may be attributed to a lack of clinical use. If clinicians do not use upper extremity performance tests to make return to sport readiness decisions, there may be large variance in return to sport decision making and higher recurrence risk for upper extremity injuries in sports. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the reported frequency of physical performance testing for return to sport readiness by physical therapists treating athletes with upper extremity injuries and the perceived potential barriers that may limit the use of these tests. A secondary aim of this study was to compare the practice patterns of clinicians with a sports physical therapy specialty certification to clinicians without this certification. The authors hypothesized that the majority of clinicians do not utilize upper extremity physical performance tests with their athletic patient population, and that the greatest barriers to their use would be a lack of awareness and understanding of current available evidence."

(Appendix) A team of three physical therapists highly experienced in the management of upper extremity athletes collaborated to develop the electronic survey using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). The development team reviewed and tested the survey among themselves, after which face and content validity were assessed by piloting the survey among a group of eight physical therapists.\nInternational Journal of Sports Physical Therapy\nFeedback was gathered on the survey and modifications were completed in order to enhance survey clarity and functionality. The survey was designed to be completed in 5-10 minutes.\nThe survey was separated into three sections. Section I gathered information regarding the country the participant was currently practicing in, their years of experience, and specialty certifications as recognized by the International Federation of Sports Physical Therapy. Section II assessed the participant\u2019s percentage of patient population that included patients with shoulder and/or elbow injuries, as well as those that had goals that included unrestricted return to sport. Specific clinical information grouped by the International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF) framework was assessed for utilization (Table 1). Participants were also asked if their testing battery changed based on the sport that the athlete was returning to and whether they would like to use more physical performance testing in their discharge planning. Section III of the survey investigated the participant\u2019s reported barriers limiting the use of physical performance tests to assess activity limitations, the estimated percentage of patients who pass all pre-established physical performance tests prior to discharge, as well any reasons why patients are discharged prior to passing the physical performance tests. Categorical data were used for the frequency of patients passing all physical performance tests with responses of 25% or less considered \u201crarely,\u201d 26 to 50% considered \u201csometimes,\u201d 51% to 75% considered \u201cfrequently,\u201d and greater than 75% of patients considered \u201cconsistently.\u201d The survey instrument is available in APPENDIX 1.\nThe Consensus-Based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS) guidelines were followed.34 All survey materials were approved prior to survey distribution by the Institutional Review Board at Baylor University (IRB# 1690573). Participants provided online consent before participating in the study. Inclusion criteria for survey participants were as follows: active, licensed physical therapist; currently treating in a sports or orthopaedic setting. All but three participants completed the survey in its entirety, failing to document their years of experience. However, all data captured was included in the data analysis."

            "text": "Using the ICF framework, results for the frequency of items used to make return to sport decisions are shown in Table 2. The most commonly reported factors used by physical therapists to make return to sport decisions using the ICF framework were: 1) impairments identified with range of motion and manual muscle tests, and 2) contextual factors such as patient subjective readiness to return to sport and patient reported outcome measures. Nearly all participants used time from injury to make return to sport decisions, while few participants reported using activity limitations with upper extremity physical performance tests when making return to sport decisions. Almost all participants stated that they tailored their battery of tests based on the sport to which the athlete is returning, and expressed the desire to use more physical performance tests in their return to sport assessments.\nResults comparing responses reported by physical therapists with and without sports specialization in the criteria used with upper extremity athletes in return to sport decisions are shown in Figure 2. There were no significant differences (p>0.05) in the use of time from injury or contextual factors. However, sports specialists reported greater use of quantitative evaluation of muscle performance with hand-held-dynamometry (70.5%) than non-specialists (50.3%) (p<0.001). Although commonly used by both groups, non-sports specialists also rely on more frequent\nuse of manual muscle testing (p<0.001) in return to sport decisions. Due to the low reported frequency of use isokinetic testing (<20%) overall, there were no significant differences between sports specialists than non-specialists. Most remarkably, sports specialists reported greater use of activity limitation assessments with physical performance tests. Specifically, 71.6% of sports specialists compared to less than 37% of non-sports specialists use the Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test. This was similar with the Upper Quarter Y-Balance Test that was used by 60.5% of sports-specialists compared to 36.0% of nonsports specialists (p<0.001). All the other physical performance tests were used infrequently (<28%) by sports specialists and non-sports specialists (<16%)."

            "text": "A particularly striking finding was that fewer than half of all participants (45.2%) utilized any physical performance tests to determine if a patient was appropriate to be cleared for sport, thereby neglecting to assess an athlete\u2019s activity limitations. This percentage is even lower in non-specialist clinicians with only 36.2% of participants using physical performance tests compared to the 71.6% of sports specialist clinicians utilizing physical performance tests. This disparity may be partially explained by the advanced training sports specialists receive in return to sport assessment. However, in addition to assessing impairments, participation, and contextual factors, evaluating activity limitations is considered an entry-level skill by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) per their Guide to Physical Therapy Practice.35 The data suggests that, regardless of a clinician\u2019s sports-specialization status, the physical therapy profession is overlooking a significant opportunity to assess activity limitations in this population.\nOne consideration is whether return to sport testing itself is an assessment that should be employed only with specialized training. The relative paucity of physical performance tests used in return to sport testing coupled with the reported lack of understanding of relevant evidence often results in a knee-jerk reaction to push physical performance tests into entry-level curriculum. However, it is important to first ask whether return to sport testing is truly an entry-level skill or that of an advanced practitioner. If it is the latter, this suggests the focus should not be on changing entry-level DPT curriculum but improving post-professional opportunities instead. For US-based specialists, the Description of Specialty Practice (DSP)36 for sports lists the implementation of \u201cfunctional tests to determine athlete\u2019s ability and readiness to return to sports activities\u201d and implementing \u201csport-specific criteria and recommendations regarding the athlete\u2019s readiness to return to sport\u201d as activities performed by the board-certified specialist. The Description of Residency Practice (DRP)37 also notes that a residency program must utilize a curriculum that is inclusive of all the learning domains as noted in the Description of Specialty Practice, suggesting that the skills associated with return to sport decision-making are indeed better suited for residency-level education as opposed to entrylevel, and that return to sport decisions are in line with specialty practice. Thus, in order to improve the utilization of physical performance tests in return to sport decision-making, barriers and challenges associated with accessing quality post-professional education should be explored."

            "text": "TESTS IN RETURN TO SPORT PLANNING\nA final takeaway from these findings is the distinct need for guidance on the clinical use of upper extremity physical performance tests. There has long been a call for higher quality research on upper extremity physical performance\ntests in both the healthy and injured athletic population,38 and sports specialists who participated in this study echoed this call as nearly half responded that a perceived lack of quality evidence is a significant barrier to their use of physical performance tests. However, the most cited barriers for the use of physical performance tests for upper extremity injuries from all participants were a lack of understanding of the current research, a lack of time, and a lack of equipment. These barriers are intricately linked, as a large percentage of physical performance tests currently available require minimal time and equipment to perform. With new literature providing guidance on how to utilize existing physical performance tests, each of these barriers can be considerably lessened. Considering these responses, the authors believe that the need for literature providing guidance on the use of upper extremity physical performance tests may be greater than the need for literature validating their use.\nThis study is not without limitations. First, while the study was distributed through the mailing lists of several professional organizations, it was also shared via social media limiting the ability to calculate an overall response rate. Second, in distributing through the mailing list of sports rehabilitation-specific organizations, there may have been somewhat of a selection bias as this clinician population may be more inclined to use physical performance tests than clinicians that do not belong to these sports rehabilitation organizations. That said, based on the current data comparing sports specialists to non-specialist clinicians, it is very possible that including a greater population of non-specialist clinicians would result in an even lower percentage of individuals reporting the use of upper extremity physical performance tests. Finally, while the survey was distributed internationally, most participants were US clinicians. As a result, these practice patterns may be generalized to physical therapist practice within the United States, but not necessarily indicative of practice patterns globally."
