"Compounds from C. nutans dichloromethane leaf extracts may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection because they may target the main protease (3CLpro) and ACE2 receptors of SARS-CoV-2 based on the molecular docking analyses [35]; this topic warrants further research. Continued study on the direct interaction of the selected chemical with the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and ACE2 receptor could be detected by using Affi-gel affinity chromatography [61] or surface plasmon resonance screening [62]. Bioassays of selected chemicals on the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by interfering with the activity of the main protease, and on viral infection by interrupting the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the ACE2 receptor, could also be studied."

"How C. nutans extract can cross the BBB to produce drug effects and its underlying molecular mechanism of anti-neuroinflammation are worthy of continued study."

"Many studies have delineated the activities of C. nutans extracts against virus, inflammation, and on immunomodulation; however, a systemic analysis of these effects is lacking. Systemic approaches such as metabolomics, proteomics, RNA sequencing, and combined analysis with bioinformatics could be employed to have a full picture of dynamic fluctuation in the levels of genes, proteins of signaling pathways, or metabolites in metabolic pathways during treatment with C. nutans extracts, and thus providing information for the construction of fine and integrated networks of drug effects on antiviral, anti-inflammation, and immunomodulation for a better understanding of the action mechanisms of C. nutans extract and more effective treatment of related diseases."
