The typical phase obtained by solidification from a homogeneous shear-melt is a substitutional alloy with a body centered cubic structure. In strictly gas-tight vials, the polycrystalline solid is stable against melting and further phase transformation for extended times. For comparison, we also prepare the same samples by slow, mechanically undisturbed deionization in commercial slit cells. These cells feature a complex but well reproducible sequence of global and local gradients in salt concentration, number density, and composition as induced by successive deionization, phoretic transport, and differential settling of the components, respectively. Moreover, they provide an extended bottom surface suitable for heterogeneous nucleation of the \u03b2-phase. We give a detailed qualitative characterization of the crystallization processes using imaging and optical microscopy. By contrast to the bulk samples, the initial alloy formation is not volume-filling, and we now observe also \u03b1and \u03b2-phases with low solubility of the odd component. In addition to the initial homogeneous nucleation route, the interplay of gradients opens various further crystallization and transformation pathways leading to a great diversity of microstructures. Upon a subsequent increase in salt concentration, the crystals melt again. Wall-based, pebbleshaped \u03b2-phase crystals and facetted \u03b1-crystals melt last. Our observations suggest that the substitutional alloys formed in bulk experiments by homogeneous nucleation and subsequent growth are mechanically stable in the absence of solid\u2013fluid interfaces but thermodynamically metastable. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

            "text": "In eutectic phase diagrams, a binary mixture shows a common melting temperature lying well below that of each of its pure components. The minimal melting temperature, TE, and the corresponding composition, pE (expressed in terms of the molar ratio x, or number fraction p = nsmall/ntotal), define the eutectic point. In eutectic solidification, the liquid converts simultaneously into two coexisting solid phases.1 This is helpful for the processing of eutectic systems. Desired microstructures can be obtained by tuning the temporal sequence of cooling and tempering. The industrially important example of steel forming adjacent crystallites of pure \u03b1- and \u03b2-phases\nis well known. During its growth at T < TE, particles expelled from one phase feed the growth of crystallites in the other in their immediate environment, and rod-like or lamella microstructures are quite common. This \u201cin situ\u201d-composite microstructure is highly valued for its wear resistance.\nEutectic phase diagrams also appear in other systems, including colloidal model suspensions. Charged sphere suspensions, in particular, share a great deal of structural analogies with metallic systems.2 As in metallic systems, the ratio of thermal energy to interaction energy rules their phase behavior. However, colloidal systems are processed at constant (ambient) temperature, and their interaction strength is varied, e.g., by adjusting the number density, n. A\nJ. Chem.

In low salt (c \u2248 1 \u03bcmol l\u22121) aqueous suspension, freezing densities are on the order of n \u2248 0.5\u20135 \u03bcm\u22123.3\u20135 The corresponding lattice constants are on the order of the wavelength of visible light. On one side, this facilitates structural studies with optical techniques like high-resolution microscopy and Bragg scattering.6 On the other hand, it renders colloidal solids very fragile with shear moduli on the order of a few Pa.7 This in turn enables access to a homogeneous, gradient-free metastable fluid state simply by shaking the sample.8 This has been widely used as a platform to study the nucleation, growth, and coarsening mechanisms and kinetics of colloidal suspensions.9\u201313 Hard spheres14 and charged spheres of opposite charge form a wealth of compound structures.15 Concerning likecharged binary mixtures, compound structures were observed, e.g., by Hachisu and Yoshimura, for selected suitable size ratios.16 Meller and Stavans were the first to report a transition from straight over azeotrope-like to eutectic-like liquidus (L) curves for decreasing size ratio \u0393 = asmall/alarge (where a denotes the particle radius). Using diffusing wave spectroscopy, the authors further observed a glass phase at intermediate p to separate two crystalline regions at low and large p. Okubo and Fujita17 investigated exhaustively deionized systems, crystallizing at volume fractions as low as \u03a6 = 0.0003. In addition, these authors found a systematic dependence on size ratios for L-curves of phase diagrams plotted in the \u03a61-\u03a62 plane. An enhanced crystal stability in a binary mixture of different sizes but with equal charge was reported by Wette et al.18 and later suggested to result from AB4 compound formation by Liu et al.19 Stipp determined the growth velocity of alloy crystals in a binary mixture with a size ratio \u0393 = 0.77 and a constant n to vary non-monotonously with composition, being lowest at p \u2248 0.8.20 Lorenz et al. investigated both liquidus and solidus curves of binary charged mixtures over a wider range of samples and reported the observation of spindle type phase diagrams and azeotropes.21 The latter authors also reported the first observation of pure \u03b2-phase crystals in a colloidal eutectic formed by differential settling under gravity.22 These coexisted with the fluid phase and (presumably) small-sphere-enriched alloy crystals. However, in the absence of gradients, samples at n < nE solidified completely and formed substitutional alloy phases of composition equal to that of the shear-melt. This is strikingly different to the case of metals, which for TL > T > TE show the melt to coexist with either the \u03b1- or \u03b2-phase and may raise the question of phase stability. In their seminal work on polydisperse systems, Barrat and Hansen stated the possibility of rapidly forming, mechanically stable crystals that are nevertheless thermodynamically metastable.23 Such issues have up until now mainly been addressed by theory and simulation for hard sphere systems, often in connection with fractionation,24\u201327 but not for binary charged sphere mixtures.\nDue to their softness, colloidal systems can easily be influenced by external fields to steer their phase behavior and crystallization path.28 This either works via a manipulation of the particle\u2013particle interaction29,30 or via an increase in the number density by gravity,31,32 dielectrically33,34 or electrically driven,35 directed transport. Alternatively, the density can also be controlled by hydrodynamic or phoretic transport, e.g., using micropumps36 or diffusiophoresis in salt concentration gradients.37 The microstructure of solids and the shape of crystals have been manipulated by mechanical or gravity-induced shear38\u201341 or by local density\ngradients.42 Most studies investigated single component systems, and much fewer addressed binary systems.43,44\nThe present study is based on those previous studies, and it studies low salt systems at n < nE by imaging and optical microscopy. However, it goes beyond in several respects. We conduct a systematic comparison of the solidification behavior of low salt binary mixtures in dependence on the quench path. Experiments on bulk solidification are repeated with a special focus on the previously less well covered region of large p. For a second mixture of similar size ratio, they are complemented by experiments on solidification after directed shear. The main part of our new study, however, addresses solidification in commercial slit cells. In slit cells, a complex sequence of local and global gradients in salt concentration, number density, and composition evolves. In particular, we exploit the internal formation of a gradient in interaction strength caused by an ion exchange generated concentration field. The concentration gradient further leads to large scale phoretic transport.45 Even more important, the two components are influenced differently by gravity, which leads to differential settling of the large component and creaming of the smaller component against the stagnant solvent.46 Each of these processes has its own characteristic time scale, which allows for a complex interplay. Most previous studies addressed systems crystallizing completely via homogeneous nucleation and growth.13 In slit cells, samples do not crystallize completely, which leaves sufficient room and time for the transport processes to occur. In this way, we can circumvent the formation of a mechanically stable alloy phase, inhibiting further development toward equilibrium. We observe and characterize a characteristic sequence of observable microstructures and crystal shapes leading from polycrystalline alloys to purified \u03b1- and \u03b2-phases. In addition, after a few months, a slow increase in electrolyte concentration allows us to access the thermodynamic stability of the formed phases and crystal types. Our results demonstrate that the substitutional alloys formed in bulk experiments are indeed mechanically stable but thermodynamically metastable with respect to a three-phase equilibrium. We anticipate that our observations relating specific gradients to characteristic microstructures may aid in the development of genuine microstructure-control in colloidal eutectics."

            "text": "We studied two binary mixtures of charged sphere species, PnBAPS70-PnBAPS122 and PnBAPS118-PS392. PnBAPS denotes a Poly-n-Butylacrylamid/Polystyrene-copolymer, and PS denotes pure Polystyrene. The numbers give the particle diameter in nm as obtained from ultracentrifugation and static light scattering. The copolymer particles were a kind gift from BASF, Ludwigshafen. For the first mixture, the size ratio is \u0393 = asmall/alarge = 0.557. From shear modulus measurements, the particles carry effective charges of ZG = 331 \u00b1 3 and ZG = 582 \u00b1 18, respectively. This yields an interaction-strength-related charge ratio of \u039bG = 0.57.21,22 Using a mass density of 1.05 g/cm3, their Stokes sedimentation velocities in water are 8.5 and 27.3 \u03bcm s\u22121, respectively. The phase diagrams of the two pure species are given in Figs. S1(a) and S1(b) in the supplementary material. The second mixture has a size ratio of \u0393 = 0.30 and a charge ratio of \u039bG = 0.31.\nBoth systems were prepared in low salt aqueous suspension. Samples were conditioned in different ways and in different cell\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 114902 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0140949 158, 114902-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n11 January 2024 21:52:21\ntypes. This allows a comparison of crystallization scenarios and resulting microstructures for samples prepared at the same location in the n-p phase diagram. After pre-conditioning, samples were either circuit or batch conditioned. In the following, we give a short sketch of both and the cell types used with them. For more details, the interested reader is referred to the supplementary material.\nCircuit conditioning provides a homogenized shear melt with a well-controlled low salt concentration.47 Samples crystallize from the latter in the absence of any gradients in salt concentration, number density, or composition. This approach, in addition, facilitates the application of directed shear immediately before the start of the crystallization.48 The resulting microstructures were observed by microscopy in four-wall-polished flow-through cells with a rectangular cross-section of 1 \u00d7 10 mm2 (Light Path Optical, Milton Keynes, UK). Samples were mounted on the stage of an inverse microscope (IRB, Leica, Wetzlar). They were observed with 10\u00d7, 25\u00d7, or 40\u00d7 magnification in bright field transmission (TM), polarization microscopy (PM),49 as well as in Bragg microscopy (BM)50 in transmission (TBM), or reflection under external illumination with parallel white light (RBM).21 These cells allow observation in top- and side view, facilitating determination of both microstructure and nF.53\nIn batch-conditioned samples, the systems are in contact with small amounts of ion exchange resin (IEX) in either cylindrical vials or slit cells closed by gas-tight caps. Deionization starts from a salt-free state, equilibrated in contact with ambient air. This state contains a small amount of carbonic acid from the dissociation of dissolved CO251 and a negligible amount of cations leached from the cell walls (\u224810\u22128 mol l\u22121,36). In contact with the IEX, the salt concentration is slowly lowered over time. In return, gradients in salt concentration appear. Crystals appear wherever and whenever the electrolyte concentration is lower than the freezing concentration.52 This has different effects in the vials and in the slit cells. In the vials, it leads to convectional motion facilitated by diffusiophoretic transport and crystal sedimentation. Over the time scale of several weeks, the differential settling of the larger component and creaming of the smaller component can also be observed. With some extra measures taken, it is, however, well suited for the determination of phase behavior. To that end, the vials are occasionally shaken, returning them to a gradient-free melt state. Samples with n > nM then crystallize in a spatially homogeneous way throughout the vial. Complete deionization is achieved when, after shaking and re-crystallization, the crystallite size has reached a constant value. Samples prepared in the coexistence region again show more complicated microstructures. However, the vial geometry often inhibits detailed observation.\nCrystallization in vials was followed by visual inspection and photography using ambient or oblique white light illumination and a 12.8Mpx consumer DSLR (D700, Nikon) equipped with a 24\u201370 mm F2.8 zoom lens. If desired, samples in cylindrical vials can be further analyzed by conventional static light scattering (SLS) to determine the crystal structure and exact number density as well as their shear modulus.21,22\nThe situation is different for batch-conditioning in slit cells. These feature a 7.5 \u00d7 40 mm2 observation region of 250 \u03bcm height connected at both sides to cylindrical reservoirs, each of approximately 1 cm3 volume [Fig. S3(a), supplementary material]. Samples\nare imaged by photography and in different microscopy modes. After filling and closing the cells with gas tight screw caps, samples were kept with the observation region up and the vial cap down. The IEX sinks to the bottom of both reservoirs. Slit cells evolve the same gradient types as before. However, now, the observation region remains undisturbed by convection, and it is not mixed again. In particular, the evolving gradient in electrolyte concentration produces an advancing location of the freezing conditions [Fig. S3(b), supplementary material]. It advances vertically in the reservoirs. In the observation region, the advance is horizontal toward its center. Slit cells thus translate the temporal evolution of the sample into a spatial one.\nTwo further gradient types are observable in slit cells. First, growing crystals with a composition close to that of the \u03b1- or \u03b2-phase tend to exclude the respective odd species, which enrich close to the crystal surface. Second, the continued CO2 leakage at small rates becomes unbalanced by continued ion exchange upon IEX exhaustion. This leads to a secondary gradient in electrolyte concentration. Careful additional cell sealing and the use of a sufficient amount of IEX facilitate a shift in the onset of exhaustion toward several months, i.e., beyond the typical time scales of crystallization and microstructural transitions. It then allows melting experiments on the different crystal types.\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 114902 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0140949 158, 114902-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\nRESULTS Bulk phase behavior and micro-structure\nData on the bulk behavior of the PnBAPS70-PnBAPS122 mixture are displayed in Fig. 1. For densities n > nM(p), samples crystallize completely via homogeneous nucleation and form a polycrystalline microstructure. The crystallite size increased with decreasing number density as well as with decreasing distance to the eutectic composition. Figure 1(a) shows an example imaged at constant n = 38 \u03bcm\u22123. Figure 1(b) shows the phase diagram in the previously less well covered region of 1.0 > p > 0.5 and n \u2264 100 \u03bcm\u22123. At low densities, the sample remains fluid. A coexistence region separates the fluid region from a fully crystalline region. As in previous studies,21,22 the mixture forms substitutional alloy crystals of body centered cubic (bcc) structure. Samples prepared above the coexistence region showed a very slow increase in crystallite size over the first few months due to coarsening. However, under our gas-tight conditions, they are otherwise stable against further phase transformation or melting for at least four years.\nIn the coexistence region, we observed some microstructural variations. For some representative examples, see Fig. S4 of the supplementary material. Again, we mainly obtained polycrystalline\nmicrostructures, but now with a broad spread of crystallite sizes. In several samples, a non-negligible amount of crystals nucleated heterogeneously at the container wall. Quite often, an unambiguous determination of completed crystallization was difficult. Due to this systematic uncertainty, the location of nF and nM is not well defined in the phase diagram of Fig. 1(b). The overall phase diagram shape and the inferred eutectic composition of pe \u2248 0.82 (green arrow), however, compare well with previous results21,22 and expectations from the metallurgy.1\nFigure 2 displays bulk data for PnBAPS118/PS392. Here, we focused on the large p-region, p = (1.00\u20130.96) and n = (0.5\u201310) \u03bcm\u22123, i.e., near the liquidus. For directed shear melting of thoroughly deionized samples, we used circuit conditioning. We observed the samples by microscopy in a parallel plate flow through cells. Far above the liquidus, the cell quickly fills with homogeneously nucleated, randomly oriented polycrystals, irrespective of the cycling velocity and the way the shear was stopped [Fig. 2(a)]. Closer to the liquidus, the microstructure becomes shear-history-dependent. After slow cycling and slow stopping, we observe a mosaic of crystals that nucleated heterogeneously on the container walls. In the PM micrograph of Fig. 2(b), all crystals show more or less the same blue color at somewhat differing brightness. This uniformity shows\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 114902 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0140949 158, 114902-4\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\nthat all crystals are oriented with the most-densely-packed crystallographic plane {110} parallel to the cell wall. The different shading results from random in-plane orientations of \u27e8111\u27e9 within {110}.49 These quench depth dependent changes in nucleation mode are in line with those observed for single component samples.53 After fast cycling and a fast stop of the shear flow, we observe elongated, cloudshaped domains of different brightness [Fig. 2(c)]. These relate to the twinning pattern within {110} of the wall-based crystals.48,54 For the BM micrograph, the illumination angle was chosen such that only twins with \u27e8111\u27e9 parallel to the formerly applied flow direction yielded observable Bragg reflections.8 Rather than nucleating in individual events, these crystals emerge via a martensitic transition from a thin initial sheet, left-over from the sheared state, and of hexagonal order.55 This microstructure also dominates in circuit conditioned slit cells (Fig. S5, supplementary material). All these microstructures were observed to be stable and did not show further transitions, except for melting upon gas leakage.\nThe phase diagram of the circuit conditioned system in Fig. 2(d) shows a narrow coexistence region with no ambiguities and only little scatter. The center of the coexistence region is well approximated by a straight line in this semi-log plot (dashed blue line). For selected samples, we determined the crystal structure by SLS, following56 [the larger symbols in Fig. 2(d)]. Throughout the crystalline region, we observe substitutional alloy crystals. At lower n, these are of bcc structure. Note, however, the low-lying transition to face centered cubic (fcc) structure at n \u2248 (7\u20139) \u03bcm\u22123 for p = 1, and its shift toward larger n with decreasing p. Fcc crystals are also recognizable by their striations in the BM micrograph of Fig. 2(a).57 The shear modulus of samples was measured in the bcc region. It varied smoothly with composition with magnitudes in the theoretically expected range of a few Pa.\nCrystal formation and transformation in slit cell experiments"

            "text": "Slit cells subjected to slow deionization allow us to study microstructure evolution in the presence of different gradients evolving over time. In addition, they provide ample opportunity for heterogeneous nucleation at the cell walls. Finally, due to continued slow CO2 leakage and the finite amount of IEX, the electrolyte concentration increases again after several months, which facilitates observations of the relative stability of previously formed microstructures. We focus on the binary mixture PnBAPS70/PnBAPS122 with n chosen a few times larger than nF(p) (i.e., all these samples had crystallized completely in the bulk experiments).\nCrystallization proceeds in different characteristic stages (labeled I\u2013IV). In each, the dominant crystal types differ in structure, composition, and microstructure. This general scenario was followed in practically all our slit cell experiments. However, the onset and duration of each stage as well as the location and relative extension of crystal formation type regions depended strongly on the chosen starting conditions (n0, p0). Moreover, the development was hardly ever fully symmetric. This results from the cell-specific differences in gas-tightness and the amount of IEX added to each reservoir. The latter also determines the time span up\nto which crystals keep forming and transforming. For typical samples, crystal transformations become very slow after 5\u20136 months, and leakage-induced melting commences after some 7\u201311 months. Figure 3 shows two representative realizations of the general temporal sequence of crystal formation and the specific alterations in location of formed microstructures. For further examples, see Fig. S6, supplementary material.\nStage I\nThe initial crystal formation stage (I) takes a few days. As in the bulk experiments, substitutional alloy crystals form before any significant changes in composition have occurred. A crystallization front advances from the reservoirs toward the cell center, where the parameters n, c, and p0 first allow for crystal formation. Its advance is controlled mainly by the eventually flattening gradient in salt concentration. In reaction to the gradient, particles of both kinds are transported by diffusiophoresis away from the center and toward the IEX placed at the reservoir bottoms. Therefore, an additional gradient in n emerges, which leads to a rainbow-like overall color change in the fluid part of the images. The observed drift speeds range on the order of cm/week. All samples start crystallizing in the reservoirs, which become deionized first and feature the largest n. After 1\u20132 days, the crystallization front reaches the horizontal observation region. Figure 3(a) shows a sample after 4 days. Alloy crystals are readily recognized from their colorful Bragg reflections; they fill roughly half the observation volume. Due to the ongoing transport processes, the fronts are often considerably curved (Fig. S7, supplementary material).\nStage II\nThe first stage is ended and the second stage is induced by the differential settling of the larger component. This establishes a vertical gradient in composition within the remaining melt. At the cell bottom, p < p0. The local decrease in p stops the further formation of early alloy crystals, and the formation of nearly pure large component particles (\u03b2-phase) commences in the formerly fluid region. These appear first as dark sheets, later transforming into isolated dark spots in the central regions of Figs. 3(b)\u20133(e). Typically, we observe a lateral decrease in coverage by \u03b2-phase toward the cell center. Pebbles are thicker than sheets, and sheets gradually thin out and finally disappear.\nStage III\nFrom now on, the situation gets considerably more complicated. Stage III starts a few days after Stage II. It is characterized by a vanishing horizontal gradient in salt concentration and a growing vertical gradient in concentration. Several processes now occur at different locations simultaneously. Next to the growing dark spots, a second type of alloy crystal nucleates and grows at the bottom of the observation region, either on top of \u03b2-phase crystals or in between. These crystals, again, show vivid Bragg scattering. The region of onset advances toward the center [cf. the change in relative position of the crystallization front with respect to the IEX bead marked by the arrow in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. Both crystal types expel particles of the odd component and enrich them in their immediate vicinity. Therefore, at this stage, also local variations in p control alloy crystal formation as well as further \u03b2-phase growth become possible. Meanwhile, however, the initial\nJ. Chem.

Two representative examples of the spatiotemporal sequence and distribution of crystallization stages for PnBAPS70/PnBAPS122 in slit cells under batch-conditioning. The photographic images were taken under ambient illumination. The image height is 51.8 mm, and the image width is 7.8 mm. The observation area between the reservoir rims is roughly 40 \u00d7 7.5 mm2. Roman numerals corresponding to the respective formation stage denote: I: early alloy crystals; II: bottom based, heterogeneously nucleated \u03b2-phase crystals; III: a mix of \u03b2-phase crystals and small-particle-enriched, heterogeneously nucleated secondary alloy crystals; IV: late, small-particle-rich, homogeneously nucleated alloy crystals in the top compartment of the cell. The subtle asymmetry of crystal type distribution can be attributed to differing exchange rates in the two reservoirs. (a) Sample with p = 0.4 and n = 12.3 \u03bcm\u22123 at t = 4d. (b) The same sample at t = 19d. Note the shrinkage of the accidentally present air bubble. (c)\u2013(f): p = 0.5 and n = 12.8 \u03bcm\u20133 at different times. (c) t = 7d; (d) t = 15d; (e) t = 21d; and (d) t = 35d. The arrow marks an accidentally present IEX bead. Note its initial drift and the ongoing overall color changes revealing diffusiophoretic transport processes. Due to this transport, the initially present stage I alloy crystals have already been pushed back into the reservoirs.\nalloy crystals disappear. Figure 3(b) shows the situation after 19d, i.e., about a week after stage III had started. Secondary alloy crystals and \u03b2-phase fill the central region, while most alloy crystals close to the reservoirs have melted. This gave additional room for further and secondary alloy formation. In the top region of Fig. 3(b), the initial alloys have already been replaced by alloy and \u03b2-phase crystals. Throughout stage III, the dissolution and reformation of alloy crystals continue, giving rise to interesting microstructural details. In most cases, it was only stopped after several months by overall melting due to the gradual increase in salt concentration. However, in optimally sealed cells, it may end much earlier [Figs. S6(a)\u2013S6(c), supplementary material].\nStage IV\nIn many samples, the onset of a further stage (IV) could be observed after 2\u20135 weeks. Here, the smaller component creams upward and fills the upper part of the observation volume. In samples forming an extended fluid region close to and in the top part of the reservoirs during stage III, creaming may even lead to an inversion of the initial density gradient formed by diffusiophoresis [Figs. S6(d) and S6(e), supplementary material]. In particular, for\nsamples with p0 > 0.85, we observe the homogeneous nucleation of alloy crystals in the upper region of the observation slit [Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)]. A comparison between the crystals formed in bulk samples prepared at coexistence and the corresponding \u201chead\u201d-crystals of Lorenz22 suggests interpreting these stage IV crystals as alloy crystals forming of significantly enlarged p and n. To summarize the main findings of this overview, in slit cells, crystallization proceeds in a fairly well-ordered sequence of different spatiotemporal crystal formation stages."

Finally, columnar crystals nucleate at type-b or type-c crystals (secondary nucleation) and grow in a horizontal direction.\n(d). Their multi-colored appearance indicates a random orientation of the crystallite axes. Presumably, differential settling has led to coverage of the cell bottom by large particles, inhibiting further heterogeneous nucleation of the small-component-rich alloy crystals due to crystal lattice mismatch.\n\u03b2-phase material forms from PnBAPS122 particles, which have differentially settled under gravity and accumulated at the lower cell wall (stage II) or are expelled from growing secondary alloy crystals (stage III). In the Bragg image of a sample at p = 0.90 and n = 20 \u03bcm\u22123 taken after 20d [Fig. 5(a)], we observe the stage II crystals to the right toward the cell center and the stage III crystals to the left.\n\u03b2-phase material can be discriminated from alloy crystals by its distinctive optical properties. In Bragg imaging, it shows reflections only under grazing incidence illumination and observation.22 Under standard illumination, it appears as black, i.e., non scattering, regions embedded in weakly scattering melt or next to alloy phase crystals, which do show Bragg scattering if oriented favorably. With increasing crystal height, \u03b2-phase crystals appear ever darker. In Fig. 5(b), the stage III region of Fig. 5(a) is observed again in PM. Now, the \u03b2-phase shows only a very faint, bluish hue [Fig. 5(b), right]. The recorded intensity is orders of magnitude weaker than for alloy crystals of comparable thickness [Fig. 5(b), center and left]. Only in regions with no alloy crystals around, the pebble-shaped \u03b2-phase crystals can be imaged better using long exposure times [Fig. 5(c)].\nStarting a small distance away from the rightmost alloy crystals, the \u03b2-phase initially appears as thin, wall nucleated spots of crystalline material, which merge into sheets intersected by thin channels [left region in Fig. 5(a)]. The covered region expands and advances\nFIG. 5. Microstructures of stage II \u03b2-phase crystals. The cell center is to the right, and the nearest reservoir is to the left. Scale bars as indicated.

Next, the sheets transform into small, half-dome-shaped crystals of a roughly circular base, as seen in the dark center region of Fig. 5(a), taken after 10d, i.e., after commence of stage III to the left. During this stage III, the \u03b2-phase grows in concert with alloy crystals. A light gray region fills the previously left gap between alloy and \u03b2-phase material. In Fig. 5(b), this region appears as a bright region of blue color. The highlighted rectangular area in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) is shown enlarged in Fig. 5(d). We observe freshly formed, bottom based alloy crystals with rather straight edges to confine the \u03b2-phase between their borders. Still further to the left, isolated \u03b2-phase pebble crystals and interspersed secondary alloy crystals grow and replace the vanished stage I alloy crystals. In addition, here, \u03b2-phase material and alloy crystals grow side by side, each feeding the other with expelled odd particles, such that locally, p > pF(n) for both phases. In the metal case, this is known as sympathetic nucleation and growth and is responsible for the lamellae-type microstructure observed after solidification at large metastability. In the present experiments, we are at weak metastability (n < nE), and stage II crystals never get space filling, although their final height, as inferred from their relative darkness, increases with n.\nThe second round of alloy crystal formation proceeds in parallel in the region where the stage I alloys had disappeared and toward the central region. In the former small crystals grow next to \u03b2-phase pebbles, either on top of them or in between them. Different crystal shapes and microstructure emerge in the central region. Figure 6 shows a time series of these stage III alloy crystals. (Note the flipped display direction; the IEX is now toward the bottom of the images.) In the formerly pebble-rich region [the black stripe in Fig. 5(a)], relatively small alloy crystals grow side by side with \u03b2-phase material. Furthermore, toward the center, we see many alloy crystals nucleate and grow on top of the thin \u03b2-phase sheets and patches. Interest-\ningly, practically all of them appear to be oriented with a densely packed plane parallel to their substrate, and only rarely does a differently oriented crystal emerge (yellow arrow in Fig. 6). Neighboring crystals form facets at an intersection. Crystals that are growing more isolated start with roundish shapes but soon develop pronounced growth faceting. We measured their maximum height by repeating focusing experiments. The sharpness of top surface details allowed us to infer an increase in the final height from 20 to 30 \u03bcm at n = 15 \u03bcm\u22123, over 40\u201350 \u03bcm at n = 20 \u03bcm\u22123, to \u224870\u201390 \u03bcm at n = 28 \u03bcm\u22123. Therefore, these crystals stay thin but grow to considerable lateral extension. In addition, the relative amount of these different microstructures depends on the overall density. We observe a clear trend to increase with overall density and a pronounced scatter from sample to sample. Here, the majority of low heights were observed in samples, which before developed a steep gradient in c. In addition, the number of sympathetically growing columnar alloys and \u03b2-phase crystals as well as isolated \u03b2-phase pebbles increased with increasing n (Figs. S8 and S9 of the supplementary material). At low n, the thin, growth faceted alloy crystals prevail. Furthermore, at the end of their initial growth period, columnar crystals nucleate at their rim and grow outward. As before in stage I, these appear to have a more random orientation. Figure 6 shows that this process occurs in a large region simultaneously and is, thus, systematic. However, it presently remains to be rationalized.\nThis single crystal type shows a rich inner structure or texture. We display some examples in Fig. 7(a). A typical feature is the presence of fine dark lines running outward from the crystal center [Fig. 7(a)]. These may get more pronounced, with increasing crystal size. Where they reach the crystal edge, one often observes a little kink in the otherwise straight crystal boundary [Fig. 7(b)]. In a loose analogy to surface water on glaciers, we attribute them to rivets of expelled large particles collected in scars and flowing outward. The crystal in Fig. 7(b) also shows roundish, slightly darker features, which result from overgrown flat \u03b2-phase patches (see also Fig. S10, supplementary material). Upon encountering more elevated \u03b2-phase pebbles, the alloy crystal grows around them [Fig. 7(c)].\nIn Fig. 7(d), we focused on the bottom plate to highlight the distribution of large particles. The image allows for two different interpretations. We favor an accumulation of PnBAPS122 at the alloy crystal edge after descending the central plateau. This would be a very slow version of sympathetic growth. Alternatively, Fig. 7(d) is compatible with the alloy crystal scraping up material from the surrounding \u03b2-phase sheet. In particular, the correlation of the dark black spots with the surrounding sheet distribution would support this view. At later growth stages, the initially fine black lines become significantly more pronounced. In addition, the initial edge-kinks get deeper, and in many cases, fjord-like morphologies form, in which the alloy crystals finally form radially oriented, longish inclusions of \u03b2-phase [Figs. 7(e) and 7(f)]. Faceting at these stages yields more compact crystal boundaries [Fig. 7(e)]. Symmetries are kept across fjords. It is tempting to suspect an increased surface tension of the single crystals toward the adjacent large particle enriched fluid. A close-up of the nucleation and the growth stage of the outer columnar crystals is given in Figs. 7(f) and 7(g). At larger densities, secondary nucleation is also observed on top of this crystal type [Fig. 7(h)]. In addition, isolated small crystals are observed more often. These are facetted right from their nucleation stage.\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 114902 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0140949 158, 114902-8\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n11 January 2024 21:52:21\nFIG. 7.

In Fig. 7(i), the two variants grow in immediate vicinity to each other. Finally, the symmetry of faceting depends on time. In early grown alloy crystals, hexagonal facets dominate. After about two months [i.e., way into stage III and often after the onset of significant creaming (see below)], the relative fraction of rectangular shaped facets increases. A particularly nice specimen nucleated at about 90d and observed after 112d is shown in Fig. 7(j).\nA final well-defined stage of crystal formation accompanies the ongoing processes of stages II and III after some weeks. A representative example is shown in Figs. 8(a)\u20138(c), where throughout the complete observation region, a spatially uniform burst of homogeneous nucleation occurs, followed by very slow growth [see also Figs. 5(e) and 5(f)]. The growth velocity here is on the order of a few micrometers per day. Randomly oriented, vividly Bragg scattering crystals form and stay in the upper compartment. Their size is narrowly distributed and rarely exceeds 100 \u03bcm. Their intersections are fairly straight. Size is limited both by mutual intersection and a simple stop to growth. Therefore, in contrast to the polycrystalline stage I material in Fig. 4 and the crystal-creaming-induced compactification in the bulk sample [Fig. S4(f), supplementary material], we observe a loose, crystal-aggregate-like microstructure with fluid regions in between individual crystal groupings.\nIn slit cells, stage IV crystals form most often observed in samples of medium p as well as in samples developing a strong initial diffusiophoretic particle transport toward the IEX. In both sample types, the relative volume of the fluid phase is rather large, such that large scale creaming can occur. On the other hand, mixtures with very low initial p may show creaming, but the concentration of PnBAPS70 stays too low to facilitate nucleation [Figs. S6(d) and S6(e), supplementary material]. Following Lorenz,22 we, therefore, suggest that these stage IV crystals be PnBaPS70-enriched alloys of p > p0."

            "text": "We have presented a comprehensive overview of the phase behavior, crystallization paths, and resulting microstructures of a binary eutectic mixture. We compared crystallization from deionized, de-carbonized shear melts (with and without directed shear applied for melting) in gas-tight bulk cells (the reference state) to crystallization in slit cells, which started from de-ionized states equilibrated to ambient air. Within the former systems, we regularly obtained polycrystalline substitutional alloys (with some variation due to shear history). In the slit cells, the samples deionize and de-carbonize slowly. Therefore, a sequence of mutually orthogonal gradients evolves with characteristic times. Global gradients in salt and particle concentration evolved horizontally, while gradients in composition evolved vertically. In addition, local gradients in composition were found to evolve in the vicinity of crystallizing material. We observed characteristic crystallization and microstructural conversion sequences that were highly correlated with these different gradients and their evolution. Four main stages were discriminated, each characterized by the dominance of specific gradients. After some 4\u20136 months, practically all further microstructure evolution ceased, and after 5\u20137 months, the electrolyte concentration increased again due to CO2 leakage. This facilitated the observation of a sequence for salt-induced melting. Slit cells, thus, allowed us to observe a wealth of novel microstructures not known from bulk crystallization. In the following, we will discuss some of these issues from a broader perspective."

These samples crystallized in gas-tight bulk vials starting from a de-ionized and de-carbonized shear melt. Below the eutectic density, the phase diagram shows two broad ranges of substitutional alloys of the bcc crystal structure on both sides of a small eutectic gap. This confirms previous observations on other eutectic mixtures.17,21,22,59 For all samples within the alloy regions, the characteristic microstructure is a polycrystalline solid of randomly oriented, intersection-faceted crystallites. Being completely solidified and enclosed in gas-tight vials, these crystals are stable against microstructural transformations and melting for extended times. The same microstructure also appears during stage I\nin slit cells. Here, however, these early polycrystals dissolve and melt already during stages II and III. In addition, alloy crystals formed early in stage III dissolve again in favor of still later grown alloy crystals. Microstructural transformations ceased after some months. The final state was found to be a three-phase coexistence [cf. Fig. 10(a)]. In a homogeneous eutectic system, this should only be possible exactly at the eutectic point. Here, however, we observe the phase behavior in the presence of an external field. In fact, gravity establishes a region of very small p at the very cell bottom, where the \u03b2-phase is at local equilibrium with a coexisting fluid of p < pE.22 Elsewhere, the initial composition is more or less retained. There a fluid of p > pE should coexist in local equilibrium with the \u03b1-phase. It is tempting to identify the refined late-stage alloy crystals grown on top of the \u03b2-phase [Fig. 8(j)] with this expected \u03b1-phase. The idea could be directly addressed by an experimental determination of the composition of the alloy and the \u03b2-phase. Unfortunately, the present particles are too small for high resolution optical microscopy. However, future confocal experiments employing fluorescently labeled species could solve this issue.15\nAlready now, however, we may draw another important conclusion. We recall that during stages II and III, the stage I alloy crystals and their sequels crystals melt in the absence of salt gradients. This also holds for the stage IV alloy crystals. Presumably, after five to seven months, local sedimentation equilibrium is attained and phase equilibrium is established. Therefore, the sequence during salt-induced melting also reflects the relative thermodynamic stability of the different crystallite types (cf. Fig. 11). From this, however, we may conclude that the initially formed stage I alloys with p = p0 (and most of their sequels grown early in stage III) are thermodynamically metastable with respect to the final small sphere enriched \u03b1-phase. Since bulk samples form stage I crystals only, this conjecture also applies to the there-observed polycrystalline solids. The crystalline regions in the phase diagram of Fig. 1(b), therefore, show a region of mechanically stable but thermodynamically metastable alloy crystals. This possibility has been pointed out many years ago and in connection with polydisperse systems,23 but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been experimentally demonstrated for the case of mixtures. The true equilibrium tie-lines should thus border a much-extended fluid region. This suggestion could be supported, e.g., by computer simulations using swap moves to overcome the slow transformation dynamics in solidified systems.27"

            "text": "Our second point of discussion concerns the observed sequence of stages and its coupling to the different gradients. The four stages of crystal formation are schematically drawn in Fig. 11. Alloy formation in stage I proceeded without composition gradients but in the presence of horizontally oriented, global gradients in electrolyte concentration and particle density. \u03b2-phase formation in stage II relied on a vertical gradient in p induced by differential settling. The microstructural transformations of stage III were dominated by local, often lateral variations in p at and around growing crystals. The final alloy formation stage IV was caused by large scale creaming of the smaller component and thus involved a global composition gradient.\nBoth the sequence of stages and their duration were observed to be highly correlated with the characteristic time scales needed\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 114902 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0140949 158, 114902-11\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n11 January 2024 21:52:21\nto develop the different gradients. The strength and overall lifetime of stage I are set by the exchange rate and the cell geometry. The gradient advances quickly due to the high micro-ion diffusivity. The concentration profile evolves from initially step-like toward an eventually linear profile between the limiting concentrations set by exchange and leakage rate, respectively. For wellsealed cells, a nearly gradient-free, nearly fully de-carbonized state is reached within a week. Simultaneously, the gradient induced diffusiophoretic particle-transport establishes a particle-concentration gradient of the opposite sign, i.e, low particle concentrations in the center and enlarged particle concentrations in the reservoirs. Due to the much smaller diffusivity of the particles, this gradient is stable for extended times. The observed diffusiophoretic transport-velocities are on the order of cm/week. Unfortunately, the complex cell geometry, the presence of strong inter-particle repulsions, as well as the large uncertainties in the time-dependent relevant boundary conditions (exchange and leakage rates, local salt-concentration and salt-concentration gradient, CO2-dependent \u03b6-potential of the particles51), forbid any quantitative comparison to bulk theory45,60,61 or full electro-hydrodynamic numerical modeling.62 This interesting issue is, therefore, deferred to future investigations in simpler geometries and under well controlled local conditions.\nIn stage II, the local vertical gradient in p dominates. In the lowest part, p soon falls below pE, and with time it further decreases toward p = 0. This allows the formation of \u03b6-phase at the cell bottom. The formation time for this gradient is set by the ratio of sedimentation lengths and the observation region height.46 It regularly occurs on a time scale of a few days. Incidentally, the ensuing \u03b2-phase formation also terminates further advance of the heterogeneous nucleation zone for stage I alloys. The formation of a global composition gradient takes much longer. In fact, the time scale for global creaming is set by the overall geometry of the cell. Creaming occurs within a few weeks. The corresponding increase in p and/or n triggers stage IV alloy crystal formation [Figs. 4(e), 4(f), and S6(e) in the supplementary material].\nIn stage III, local gradients in composition dominate the microstructural conversion processes. These were seen to result from the expulsion of odd particles. The magnitude of local composition variation is coupled to the crystal growth velocities. Slow growth is more efficient for compositional refinement.63 On the other hand, fast growth may still yield a lot of expelled material. In our experiments, we observe examples of both cases [cf. Figs. 8(c)\u20138(f)]. The slow growing \u03b2-phase sheets and pebbles enrich small particles within the material on their upper surfaces and between them. Therefore, the gradient in p is locally disturbed. This is indirectly shown through the heterogeneous nucleation of stage III alloy crystals right next to growing pebbles (Fig. 5). More directly, the slow growing, late-stage central alloy crystals expel large particles very efficiently, increasing their purity and leading to a large stability against melting [Figs. 9 and 10(a)]. Conversely, fast growing early-stage III columnar alloy crystals produce a quick pile-up of large particles triggering sympathetic growth of \u03b2-phase crystals [Fig. 4(d)], but are much less stable against melting. Like the stage I alloys, these structures vanish while further refined crystals still appear. In fact, several generations of refinement are needed to approach the final composition of stage III alloys. Local composition fluctuations thus hardly alter the general sequence but influence the duration of stage III. The presence of dominant gradients is\nthus seen to control the sequence and duration of the four observed crystallization stages."

            "text": "A related third point of interest is the influence of gradients on the nucleation path taken within each stage. Here, it may be instructive to recall the dependence of nucleation paths on metastability known from previous investigations. There it was observed that samples of decreasing metastability showed a transition from homogeneous nucleation to heterogeneous nucleation of wall-based columns to spherical caps and to thin crystalline monolayers.19,53,54,64,65 The chosen nucleation scenario further depended on the specific shear history.50,54,55 With this in mind, we conclude that the ordered array of stage I microstructures imaged in Fig. 5 must be due to an overall decrease in metastability. We rationalize this in a qualitative way as follows: At constant composition, metastability depends on both the salt and the particle concentration [cf. Figs. 1(b) and 2(d) and n-c\u2014phase diagrams in Fig. S1 of the supplementary material]. At the crystallization front, c < cF(n, p), n > nF(c, p), and p \u2248 p0, where p0 denotes the initial composition. Initially, the location of the front advances toward the cell center, i.e., toward lower salt-concentrations. Due to the initial steepness of the gradient, the front is rather narrow. This results in an advancing burst of homogeneous nucleation and the formation of a fine grained Ia alloy microstructure characterized by straight crystallite intersections. As the formation of a density gradient sets in, the crystallization front slows and broadens. At the front location, the salt concentration further lowers with time, while the particle concentration also decreases. In effect, these developments are counteracting each other regarding metastability. This then leads to an extended, plateau-like region of moderate metastability. Within this region, homogeneous nucleation and growth continue as a slow steady state process. In turn, this results in an extended region for stage Ib microstructure characterized by a comparably broad crystallitesize distribution and curved crystallite boundaries.58 More toward the cell center, the salt concentration has become constant while the particle density still decreases. A weak gradient in metastability results. Therefore, we observe the expected transition to steady state heterogeneous nucleation of columnar crystals.53 Recalling the literature, the next two stages in single component systems would actually be hemispherical caps and thin sheets.62,63 This, however, is quenched in our two-component system by the competing formation of a thin layer of settled PnBAPS122. This layer impedes further heterogeneous nucleation of alloys at the cell wall by causing a lattice mismatch.\nThe expected transition is however well visible for the \u03b2-phase in Fig. 6(a). These \u03b2-phase pebbles and sheets form as the saltconcentration gradient has almost vanished but the density gradient stays. Local metastability controls the degree of phase transformation. Larger metastability leads to pebbles; lower metastability leads to crystalline sheets. Due to ongoing differential settling, the sheet thickness increases slightly with time, but due to the gradient in n, it vanishes toward the cell center. Interestingly, it is exactly there where late-stage alloy crystals can nucleate again directly on the cell wall [cf. Fig. 7 and 8(b)]. Later on, thin sheets of PnBAPS122 may, however, form in their vicinity from particles expelled during their crystal growth. This, presumably, creates a situation analogous to the\nJ. Chem.

The orthogonal orientation of the gradients with respect to each other allowed for discriminating their respective influences. Moreover, we could follow their temporal evolution and compare the characteristic time scales of parameter variation and microstructural transformations. Therefore, a reliable qualitative correlation between the local experimental conditions in n, p, and c and the resulting microstructures became possible. Our approach clearly demonstrated the flexibility inherent in colloidal crystallization under internal gradients and opened novel paths toward specific microstructures not accessible in gradient-free solidification from homogeneous shear melts.
