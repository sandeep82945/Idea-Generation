 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the neuro-tourism paper:

1. Conduct more research on understudied neuro-tourism applications like pricing and restaurant experiences. The paper found these were the least studied areas, so more research could provide useful insights.

2. Evaluate different combinations of neuroscience modalities like EEG, eye tracking, etc. to understand tourists' emotions and decisions. The paper suggested using a triangulation approach with multiple modalities may give a more complete picture. 

3. Develop machine learning models using neuroscience data to predict tourist preferences and satisfaction. The paper noted AI methods are lacking in neuro-tourism and ML could be beneficial.

4. Optimize stimuli used in neuro-tourism studies to maximize engagement of senses and influence on memory. The paper discussed the importance of novel, multi-sensory stimuli.

5. Design guidelines for selecting appropriate neuroscience technologies based on study goals, sample size, etc. The paper noted researchers need more guidance on choosing modalities and devices.
