    "abstractText": "Withanolides constitute one of the most interesting classes of natural products due to their diversity of structures and biological activities. Our recent studies on withanolides obtained from plants of Solanaceae including Withania somnifera and a number of Physalis species grown under environmentally controlled aeroponic conditions suggested that this technique is a convenient, reproducible, and superior method for their production and structural diversification. Investigation of aeroponically grown Physalis coztomatl afforded 29 withanolides compared to a total of 13 obtained previously from the wild-crafted plant and included 12 new withanolides, physacoztolides I\u2212M (9\u201313), 15\u03b1-acetoxy-28-hydroxyphysachenolide C (14), 28-oxophysachenolide C (15), and 28-hydroxyphysachenolide C (16), 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D (17), 15\u03b1acetoxy-5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D (18), 28-hydroxy-5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D (19), physachenolide A-5-methyl ether (20), and 17 known withanolides 3\u20135, 8, and 21\u201333. The structures of 9\u201320 were elucidated by the analysis of their spectroscopic data and the known withanolides 3\u20135, 8, and 21\u201333 were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported. Evaluation against a panel of prostate cancer (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, and PC-3) and renal carcinoma (ACHN) cell lines, and normal human foreskin fibroblast (WI-38) cells revealed that 8, 13, 15, and 17\u201319 had potent and selective activity for prostate cancer cell lines. Facile conversion of the 5,6-chlorohydrin 17 to its 5,6-epoxide 8 in cell culture medium used for the bioassay suggested that the cytotoxic activities observed for 17\u201319 may be due to in situ formation of their corresponding 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxides, 8, 27, and 28.",

            "text": "Withanolides, a class of polyoxygenated steroidal lactones frequently encountered in plants of the family Solanaceae [1], are known to exhibit a variety of biological activities including cytotoxic, anti-feedant, insecticidal, trypanocidal, leishmanicidal, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, phytotoxic, cholinesterase inhibitory and immune-regulatory activities, and the effects on neurite outgrowth and synaptic reconstruction [2,3]. Despite these interesting and diverse biological activities, studies on withanolides have not proceeded beyond preliminary evaluation in cellular and biochemical assays, arguably due to their supply issues as is the case with many biologically active natural products (NPs), including\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27030909 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 2 of 21\nTaxol\u00ae [4]. Traditionally, plant-based NPs are obtained from plant biomass produced by conventional cultivation in soil and/or wild-crafting. Both these methods are susceptible to unanticipated environmental catastrophes and also suffer from disadvantages as the former is labor intensive and is costly in land and water usage and the latter may lead to nonsustainable excessive harvesting causing ecological damage to their natural environment. To overcome these disadvantages, we have investigated the use of an environmentally controlled aeroponic cultivation technique for the production of biomass of some plants of Solanaceae and their constituent withanolides. Possible application of soil-less aeroponic and hydroponic cultivation systems in controlled environments for research and commercial scale production of plant biomass has been recognized for nearly two decades [5]. Compared with the well-known hydroponic technique which utilizes a nutrient solution flowing over or in constant contact with the plant roots, the aeroponic cultivation technique constitutes a modified hydroponic technique in which the nutrient medium is intermittently sprayed on the roots which are suspended in air enclosed in an aeroponic chamber [6] (for details, see Supplementary Materials Figure S1). It has been suggested that out of the two techniques, aeroponic is the optimum technique for growing intact plants [7], especially because it allows control of root zone temperature, nutrition, moisture, and gas exchange while at the same time reducing disease occurrence and transmission [8]. It is known that cultivation of medicinal plants under aeroponic conditions provides opportunities for biomass production and improving the quality, purity, and consistency of the material produced, thus overcoming some of the major disadvantages of wild-harvesting and conventional soil and hydroponic cultivation techniques [9]. In addition, aeroponic cultivation under environmentally controlled conditions has been estimated to save the labor cost considerably, water usage by 98%, fertilizer usage by 60%, pesticide and herbicides usage by 100% and increase plant yield by 45% to 75% than either hydroponic or geoponic (soil-based) systems [10]. Although aeroponic systems have been used for the production of food crops [11\u201314] and medicinal plants [9], and its potential for improving production of high-value phyto-pharmaceuticals has been suggested [8], to the best of our knowledge this technique has not been exploited for the production of plant secondary metabolites prior to our recent report on the efficient production of a potential pro-drug of withaferin A (1), namely 2,3-dihydrowithaferin A-3\u03b2-O-sulfate (2) (Figure 1), by aeroponically grown Withania somnifera (Solanaceae) [15,16].

Our recent studies suggested that the 17-BHW, physachenolide C (8), was also capable of potentiating immunotherapy of renal carcinoma and melanoma, when used in combination with the immune adjuvants, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and the ds-RNA mimetic, poly I:C [29\u201333], respectively. Physachenolide C (7) was\nFigure 1. ajor it anolides (1\u20138) encountered in so e aeroponical y grown plants of Solanaceae.\nStudies with W. somnifera and another Solanaceae species, Physalis crassifolia, also\nsuggested that the plant gro th rate, yields of bi ass and major withanolides, and the\nability to produce structurally-diversified withanolides were improved when cultivated using the aeroponic technique compared to soil cultivation under identical controlledenvironmental conditions. Thus, aeroponic cultivation of W. somnifera resulted in the production of two unusual withanolides, 3\u03b1-(uracil-1-yl)-2,3-dihydrowithaferin A and 3\u03b2(adenin-9-yl)-2,3-dihydrowithaferin, in addition to withaferin A (1), 2,3-dihydrowithaferin A-3\u03b2-O-sulfate (2), and ten other known withanolides [17] (see Supplementary Data, Figure S2). Significantly, the aeroponic cultivation of P. crassifolia produced eleven new\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 3 of 21\n17\u03b2-hydroxywithanolides (17-BHWs) [18] together with 15\u03b1-acetoxyphysachenolide D, 15\u03b1acetoxy-28-hydroxyphysachenolide D, 18-acetoxy-17-epi-withanolide K, and physachenolide D encountered in the wild-crafted/soil-grown plant [19] (see Supplementary Data, Figure S3). We have also had notable success with the aeroponic technique in cultivating other plants of the Solanaceae, such as P. peruviana [20], P. philadelphica [21], P. acutifolia [22], and P. coztomatl (this study) and isolating and characterizing over 33 new withanolides, some with promising activities related to their potential use as anticancer agents. Depicted in Table 1 are some Solanaceae plant species grown using the aeroponic technique and comparison of the number of withanolides produced and the % yields of major withanolides (1\u20138, Figure 1) obtained from the biomass of the aeroponically grown plants with the wild-harvested and/or soil-cultivated plants.\na The number of withanolides for wild-crafted/soil-grown plant refers to the referenced study reporting highest yield(s) of the major withanolide(s). b Since 2 is a prodrug of 1 [15], total % yield of withaferin A (1) in aeroponicallygrown plant is 0.93. c Yield not reported. d Not encountered in wild-crafted plants [27,28].\nWe have previously demonstrated that unlike the most extensively studied cytotoxic withanolides including withaferin A (1) with a \u03b2-oriented side chain, 17\u03b2-hydroxywithanolides (17-BHWs) such as physachenolide C (8), with an \u03b1-oriented side chain, selectively inhibited prostate cancer (PC) cell lines at nanoMolar concentrations without affecting many other cancer cell lines and normal human fibroblast cells [18\u201321].

Physachenolide C (7) was also shown to induce complete regression of established murine melanoma tumors via apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [34]. Thus, it was of interest to investigate withanolides belonging to different structural types for their potential anticancer activity. Herein we report the isolation and identification of 12 new (9\u201320) and 17 known (3\u20135, 8, and 21\u201333) withanolides from aeroponically grown Physalis coztomatl Moc. and Sess\u00e9 ex Dunal (Solanaceae) and in vitro evaluation of withanolides (3\u20135, and 8\u201333) against a panel of prostate cancer and renal carcinoma cell lines, and normal human fibroblast cells. Previous studies on P. coztomatl, a plant native to South America, has resulted in the isolation of 13 withanolides in two independent studies [27,28], including six 17-BHWs (3, 4, 25, 26, 30, and 32), all of which were also encountered in the biomass obtained from aeroponic cultivation of this plant.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 4 of 21"

Thus, it was of interest to investigate withanolides belonging to different structural types for their potential anticancer activity. Herein we report the isolation and identification of 12 new (9\u201320) and 17 known (3\u20135, 8, and 21\u201333) withanolides from aeroponically grown Physalis coztomatl Moc. and Sess\u00e9 ex Dunal (Solanaceae) and in vitro evaluation of withanolides (3\u20135, and 8\u201333) against a panel of prostate cancer and renal carcinoma cell lines, and normal human fibroblast cells. Previous studies on P. coztomatl, a plant native to South America, has resulted in the isolation of 13 withanolides in two independent studies [27,28], including six 17-BHWs (3, 4, 25, 26, 30, and 32), all of which were also encountered in the biomass obtained from aeroponic cultivation of this plant.\n. .

The molecular formula of 9 was determined to be C36H48O13 by a combination of its HRESIMS and NMR data, suggesting thirteen degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR spectrum of 9 (Table 2) showed three singlet methyl signals typical of withanolides [\u03b4H 1.22 (s), 1.28 (s), 1.85 (s)], a signal for an acetate group [\u03b4H 2.07 (s)], four olefinic signals [\u03b4H 5.57 (br s, H-6), 5.82 (br\nFigure 2.

The 13C NMR spectrum of 9 (Table 2) displayed thirty-six carbon signals including six signals typical of a glucoside moiety (\u03b4C 102.5, 73.3, 75.8, 69.4, 76.4, and 61.2), three methyls (\u03b4C 12.3, 18.7, and 24.8), eight olefinic carbons (\u03b4C 151.1, 148.2, 145.7, 135.2, 127.8, 126.7, 124.9, and 123.4), two ester carbonyls (\u03b4C 165.9 and 171.4), and a conjugated ketone carbonyl (\u03b4C 204.4). The absence of a signal due to an oxygenatied carbon around 87 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum indicated that C-17 is non-oxygenated [18]. Thus, 9 was suspected to contain a 16,17-double bond and this was confirmed by the HMBC correlations (see Supplementary Data, Figures S7 and S60) of H3-21 [\u03b4H 1.28 (s)]/C-17(\u03b4C 151.1), H3-21/C-20 (\u03b4C 74.4), and H3-21/C-22 (\u03b4C 80.8). The NMR chemical shifts (\u03b4H 1.85; \u03b4C 12.3) of one of the methyl\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 5 of 21\ngroup suggested that it was attached to an olefinic carbon. This was confirmed to be C-27 methyl group by the HMBC correlations of H3-27 [\u03b4H 1.85 (s)]/C-26 (\u03b4C 165.9), H3-27/C-25 (\u03b4C 123.4), and H3-27/C-24 (\u03b4C 148.2). The absence of a signal due to C-28 methyl group and the presence of an oxygenated CH2 group suggested the possible attachment of an O-glucosyl moiety to C-28 [18]. The HMBC correlations of H3-19 [\u03b4H 1.22 (s)]/C-1 (\u03b4C 204.4), H3-27 [\u03b4H 1.85 (s)]/C-26 (\u03b4C 165.9), H3-27/C-25 (\u03b4C 123.4), and H3-27/C-24 (\u03b4C 148.2) (see Supplementary Data, Figure S60) precluded oxygenation of C-19 and C-27 methyl groups. The identity of the sugar moiety was confirmed to be a D-glucose by the acid hydrolysis of 9 to afford a sugar with positive specific optical rotation. The ECD spectrum of 9 showed positive cotton effect at 256 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59), suggesting the R configuration of C-22 [35,36]. Based on the foregoing data, the structure of physacoztolide I was determined as (20S,22R)-18-acetoxy-28\u03b2-D-O-glucopyranosyl-14\u03b1,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-1oxo-witha-2,5,16,24-tetraenolide (9). The molecular formula of physacostolide J (10) was determined to be C36H48O12 from its HRESIMS and NMR data. The 1H NMR data of 10 (Table 1) were similar to those of 9, and the difference in molecular formulae between 10 (C36H48O12) and 9 (C36H48O13) indicated that 10 may be a deoxygenated analogue of 9. The assignment of the 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) by HSQC and HMBC data (see Supplementary Data, Figures S11 and S60) also revealed the similarities between 9 and 10. The major difference in the NMR data was found to be the absence of oxymethine group at \u03b4C 83.4, which was assigned to C-14 in 9. Instead, 10 showed the presence of a methine group (\u03b4C 57.6). This was confirmed by the up-field chemical shifts (\u2206\u03b4C: \u22123.2 ppm for C-8, \u22125.7 ppm for C-13, and \u22129.3 ppm for C-15) of carbons located \u03b2 to C-14 in 10 when compared with those of 9 (Table 2). Acid hydrolysis of 10 gave D-glucose. The ECD spectrum of 10 showed a positive cotton effect at 257 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59), suggesting the R configuration of C-22 [35,36]. Thus, the structure of physacoztolide J was determined as (20S,22R)-18acetoxy-28\u03b2-D-O-glucopyranosyl-20\u03b2-hydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,5,16,24-tetraenolide (10). The HRESIMS, 1H and 13C NMR data of physacoztolide K (11) were consistent with the molecular formula, C30H40O9. The 1H NMR data of 11 (Table 2) exhibited signals typical of a withanolide consisting of three olefinic protons [\u03b4H 5.57 (brs, H-6), 5.84 (dd, J = 10.0, 2.0 Hz, H-2), and 6.78 (ddd, J = 10.0, 4.8, 2.4 Hz, H-3)], suggesting the presence of 2,3-en1-one and 5,6-double bond moieties similar to physachenolide D (3) [18]. The 1H NMR signals due to four methyls including an acetate group [\u03b4H 1.20 (s), 1.43 (s), 2.06 (s), and 2.07 (s)] suggested that two of the methyl groups of the withanolide skeleton are substituted. This was confirmed by the presence of two oxygenated methylene signals [\u03b4H 4.34 (2H, s), 3.98 (1H, d, J = 11.6 Hz) and 4.40 (1H, d, J = 11.6 Hz)]. The two low-field oxygenated methines [\u03b4H 4.23 (d, J = 7.8 Hz) and 4.35 (d, J = 7.8 Hz)] in the 1H NMR spectrum of 11 which coupled with each other suggested that C-23 is oxygenated. The 13C NMR spectrum of 11 (Table 2) exhibited signals for five oxygenated carbons including two methylenes, two methines, and one non-protonated carbon, implying that C-14 or C-17 in 11 are not oxygenated. The absence of any oxygen-bearing substituents at C-17 was confirmed by the HMBC correlation of H3-21 [\u03b4H 1.43 (s)]/C-17 (\u03b4C 49.3) (see Supplementary Data, Figure S60), and the triplet for H-17 [\u03b4H 2.70 (t, J = 9.2 Hz)] established the configuration of the side chain at C-17 to be \u03b2 [37]. This was further supported by the NOE correlations of H3-21/H17\u03b1 and H3-21/H-12\u03b2 (see Supplementary Data, Figure S61). The presence of oxygenated substituents at C-23 and C-27 of 11 was apparent from the HMBC correlations of H3-28 [\u03b4H 2.06 (s)]/C-23 (\u03b4C 66.9) and H2-27 [\u03b4H 4.34 (s)]/C-26 (\u03b4C 164.6) (see Supplementary Data, Figures S15 and S60). The large coupling constant observed for H-22/H-23 (J = 7.8 Hz) was consistent with 23\u03b2-hydroxyphysacoztolide E-type sub-structure [18], suggesting the orientation of OH-23 as \u03b2. The positive Cotton Effect at 256 nm in its ECD spectrum (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) established the 22R configuration [35,36]. On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the structure of physacoztolide K was elucidated as (17R,20S,22R)18-acetoxy-14\u03b1,20\u03b2,23\u03b2,27-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,5,24-trienolide (11).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 6 of 21\na CDCl3/CD3OD (100:1) was used as the solvent.\nThe molecular formula of physacoztolide L (12) was determined to be C30H42O9 from its HRESIMS and NMR data. The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 2) suggested that the ring E of 12 is saturated unlike the other withanolides found to co-occur in this plant which contained an unsaturated E-ring. The 1H NMR spectrum of 12 (Table 2) exhibited signals due to four methyls including an acetyl and a secondary methyl [\u03b4H 1.22 (s), 1.28 (d, J = 6.8 Hz), 1.40 (s,), and 2.14 (s,)], two oxygenated methylenes [\u03b4H 4.89 (d, J = 11.6 Hz)/3.70 (d, J = 11.6 Hz) and 3.83 (1H, dd, J = 11.2, 2.0 Hz)/3.64 (1H, dd, J = 11.2, 7.6 Hz)], three olefinic\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 7 of 21\nprotons [\u03b4H 5.57 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, H-6), 5.85 (dd, J = 10.0, 2.0 Hz, H-2), and 6.76 (ddd, J = 10.0, 4.8, 2.4 Hz, H-3)], and two oxygenated methines [\u03b4H 4.06 (dd, J = 8.4, 8.0 Hz, H-23), 3.60 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, H-22)]. The coupling between the two oxygenated methines suggested possible hydroxylation at C-23 [18]. The 13C NMR spectrum of 12 (Table 2) displayed thirty carbon signals including an acetyl group (\u03b4C 169.7 and 21.2). The assignment of 13C NMR spectrum with the help of HSQC and HMBC data suggested that C-17 (\u03b4C 49.9) is not oxygenated like in 11, and ring E is saturated as indicated by the up-field shift of the carbonyl signal (\u03b4C 177.6) compared withanolides bearing an unsaturated E-ring \u03b4-lactone [18]. The remaining 13C NMR signals [\u03b4C 75.9 (CH), 81.1 (CH), 51.0 (CH), and 37.0 (CH)] of the \u03b4-lactone further confirmed that ring E is saturated. The presence of HMBC correlation of H3-27 [\u03b4H 1.28 (d, J = 6.8 Hz)]/C-26 (\u03b4C 177.6) (see Supplementary Data, Figures S21 and S60) confirmed that C-28 methyl is oxygenated to a CH2OH moiety. The 1H\u20131H COSY correlations of H-22/H-23, H-23/H-24, H-24/H2-28, and H3-27/H-25 (see Supplementary Data, Figures S22 and S60) together with the above data established the planer structure of ring E. The NOESY correlations of H3-21/H-23 and H-22/H23 (see Supplementary Data, Figures S23 and S61) suggested the cis configuration for H-22 and H-23, and hence the orientation of H-23 should be equatorial. The coupling constant (J = 8.0 Hz) between H-23 and H-24 was identical to that of 24,25-dihydro-23\u03b2,28-dihydroxywithanolide G [20], which established the trans configuration of H-23 and H-24. The irradiation of H3-27 showed an NOE with H-24, suggesting the trans configuration of CH3-27 and CH2OH-28. These data indicated that the gross structure of ring E of 12 is the same as that of 24,25-dihydro-23\u03b2,28dihydroxywithanolide G, which was further supported by their almost identical 13C NMR chemical shifts for the carbons of the ring E moiety [20]. The absolute configuration of C-22 was determined as R by the positive Cotton effect at 256 nm in its ECD spectrum [28] (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59). The appearance of H-17 as a triplet [\u03b4H 2.73 (t, J = 9.7 Hz)] in its 1H NMR spectrum established the configuration of the side chain at C-17 as \u03b2 [37]. Thus, the structure of physacoztolide L was identified as (17S,20R,22R,24S,25R)18-acetoxy-14\u03b1,20\u03b2,23\u03b2,28-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,5-dienolide (12). Withanolides 13\u201315 were found to contain a 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxide moiety as indicated by their 1H NMR spectra having a typical broad singlet or a doublet with a small coupling constant for H-6\u03b1 [\u03b4H 3.23 (br s) for 13, 3.20 (d, J = 2.0 Hz) for 14, and 3.15 (br s) for 15] and from their 13C NMR signals for C-5 and C-6 [\u03b4C 63.4 (C-5) and 65.0 (C-6) for 13, 63.2 (C-5) and 65.0 (C-6) for 14, and 62.0 (C-5), and 63.9 (C-6) for 14]. Their ECD spectra (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) were almost identical and showed positive cotton effects at 258 nm and 341 nm, suggesting the cis-linkage of rings A/B and the 22R configuration [35,36]. Based on its HRESIMS and NMR data, withanolide 13 was determined to have the molecular formula C30H40O10 indicating eleven degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR data (Table 3) suggested that its structure is closely related to that of physachenolide C (8), the major withanolide of this plant. These NMR data, together with its molecular formula, indicated that 13 contained one oxygen atom more than that of physachenolide C (8). Comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 3) of 13 with those of 8 [38] revealed that CH3-27 or CH3-28 in 8 was oxygenated to a CH2OH group [\u03b4H 4.36 (d, J = 13.6 Hz) and 4.24 (d, J = 13.6 Hz); \u03b4C 61.9] in 13. The presence of CH2OH-18 in 13 was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H3-27 [\u03b4H 1.88 (s)]/C-26 (\u03b4C 169.1) and H2-28/C-23 (\u03b4C 30.3) (see Supplementary Data, Figures S27 and S60). The ECD spectrum of 13 showed a positive cotton effect at 256 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59), suggesting the R configuration of C22 [35,36]. Thus, withanolide 13 was identified as 28-hydroxyphysachenolide C [(20S,22R)18-acetoxy-5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxy-14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2,28-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,24-dienolide]. The molecular formula of 14 was established as C32H42O12 by its HRESIMS and NMR data. Careful analysis of 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of 14 (Table 3) suggested that it could be an acetoxy analogue of 28-hydroxyphysachenolide C (13) or an oxygenated analogue of 15\u03b1-acetoxyphysachenolide C (27) [29]. Comparison of the NMR data of 14 with those of 13 and 27 confirmed that the signals due to the rings A\u2013D of 14 were identical with those of 27 [18], and the signals of the side chain including ring E of 14 were same as those\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 8 of 21\nof 13 suggesting that it could be 15\u03b1-acetoxy analogue of 28-hydroxyphysachenolide C. The structure was further supported by the HMBC correlations of H2-28 (\u03b4H 4.27 and 4.20)/C-23 (\u03b4C 30.3), H2-28/C-25 (\u03b4C 122.4), and H3-27 (\u03b4H 1.87)/C-26 (\u03b4C 169.0) (see Supplementary Data, Figures S31 and S60). The positive Cotton effect at 258 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) in its ECD spectrum established the R configuration for C-22 of 14 [35,36]. Thus, the structure of this withanolide was elucidated as 15\u03b1-acetoxy-28-hydroxyphysachenolide C [(20S,22R)-15\u03b1,18-diacetoxy-5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxy-14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2,28-tetrahydroxy -1-oxo-witha-2,24dienolide] (14). The molecular formula of withanolide 15 was determined to be C30H38O10 based on its HRESIMS and NMR data, suggesting twelve degrees of unsaturation. The analysis of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra (Table 3) with the help of HSQC and HMBC data revealed that the signals of rings A, B, C, and D of 15 were similar to those of 28-hydroxyphysachenolide C (13), except for those of ring E. Comparison of the molecular formula of 15 (C30H38O10) with that of 13 (C30H40O10) indicated that 15 contains two protons fewer than 13. The presence of a low-field proton signal at 10.30 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum and a signal at 190.2 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of 15 suggested that the CH2OH group attached to the ring E of 13 has undergone oxidation to a CHO group in 15. The HMBC correlations of H3-27 [\u03b4H 2.35 (s)]/C-26 (\u03b4C 165.6) and H-28 [\u03b4H 10.30 (s)]/C-23 (\u03b4C 24.5) (see Supplementary Data, Figures S35 and S60) located this CHO to be at C-28. The positive Cotton effect at 258 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) in its ECD spectrum established the R configuration of C-22 [35,36]. The structure of 15 was thus established as 28-oxophysachenolide C [(20S,22R)18-acetoxy-5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxy-14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2-trihydroxy-1,28-dioxo-witha-2,24-dienolide]. Based on its HRESIMS and NMR data, withanolide 16 was determined to have the molecular formula C30H40O10. It was suspected to be a glucoside from its molecular formula, C34H46O11, and the presence of a signal due to an anomeric proton at \u03b4H 4.23 (d, J = 8.0 Hz) and the typical 13C NMR signals (\u03b4C 102.5, 73.3, 75.9, 69.8, 76.4, and 61.5) of the glucose moiety and was named physacoztolide M. The 1H NMR spectrum of 16 (Table 3) displayed signals due to four singlet methyl protons (\u03b4H 1.11, 1.18, 1.26, and 1.82), four olefinic protons [\u03b4H 5.79 (dd, J = 10.0, 2.0 Hz, H-2), 6.74 (ddd, J = 10.0, 4.8, 2.4 Hz, H-3), 5.57 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, H-6), and 5.78 (br s, H-16)], an oxygenated methine proton [\u03b4H 4.37 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, H-22)], and protons on an oxygenated methylene group [\u03b4H 4.42 (br s)]. The olefinic region of the 1H NMR spectrum of 16 was found to similar to that of physacoztolide I (9) (see above). The absence of a singlet methyl signal around 2.0 ppm in 16 suggested that it lacked the acetyl group present in 9. These data suggested 16 has a similar skeleton as that of 9 and contained three double bonds at 2(3), 5(6), and 16(17) positions, and the AcOCH2 at C-13 in 9 was replaced by a CH3 group in 16. The assignment of the 13C NMR spectrum of 16 (Table 3) with the help of the HSQC data (see Supplementary Data, Figure S38) and HMBC data (see Supplementary Data, Figures S39 and S60) and comparison of the 13C NMR data with those of 9 further confirmed that the AcO group at C-18 of 9 is replaced with a proton in 16. The presence of the double bonds at 2(3) and 5(6), and 16(17) in 16 was further confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H3-19/C-5, H3-19/C-1, H-4/C-2, H-4/C-6, and H3-18/C-17, H3-21/C-17, H-16/C-20, respectively (see Supplementary Data, Figure S60). The long-range HMBC correlation between the anomeric proton of the glucose moiety and C-28 (\u03b4C 67.7) located the O-glycosyl moiety at C-28. The presence of the D-glucose moiety in 16 was further confirmed by the acid hydrolysis and the positive [\u03b1]D obtained for the resulting sugar. The ECD spectrum of 16 showed a positive Cotton effect at 256 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) establishing the R configuration of C-22 [35,36]. Therefore, the structure of physacoztolide M was determined as (20S,22R)28\u03b2-D-O-glucopyranosy-14\u03b1,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,5,16,24-tetraenolide (16).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 9 of 21\na CD3OD was used as the solvent. b CDCl3 was used as the solvent. c CDCl3/CD3OD (100:1) was used as the solvent.\nThe HRESIMS data together with their 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 4) indicated that compounds 17\u201319 are chlorinated withanolides. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of C-5 and C-6 of these [\u03b4C 79.5 (C-5) and 75.0 (C-6) for 17, 79.0 (C-5) and 74.6 (C-6) for 18, and 82.3 (C-5), and 75.6 (C-6) for 19] suggested that these are chlorohydrins containing\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 10 of 21\n5-chloro-6-hydroxy substituents similar to withanolide C [39]. The 13C NMR data of 17\u201319 also showed some resemblance to those of physachenolide A (21) [38] suggesting their structural relationships (Table 4). Based on its HRMS and NMR data, 17 was determined to have the molecular formula C30H41ClO9. The 1H NMR spectrum of 17 (Table 4) displayed signals due to five singlet methyl protons (\u03b4H 1.36, 1.41, 1.88, 1.92, and 2.07), two olefinic protons characteristic of the 2,3-en-1-one moiety [\u03b4H 5.89 (dd, J = 10.0, 2.4 Hz, H-2), 6.62 (br dd, J = 10.0, 3.6 Hz, H-3)], protons of two oxygenated methines [\u03b4H 4.06 (br s, H-6), 4.90 (t, J = 8.4 Hz, H-22)], and an oxygenated methylene [\u03b4H 4.43 (s, H2-18)]. The 13C NMR spectrum of 17 (Table 4) assigned with the help of HSQC (see Supplementary Data, Figure S60) and HMBC (see Supplementary Data, Figures S43 and S60) data indicated that it has a structure closely related to that of physachenolide A (21) [38], but with minor chemical shift differences in the carbon signals of ring A/B moieties, especially C-1, C-4, C-5, and C-6 (see Table 4). These differences were suspected to be due to the presence of different substituents at C-5 and C-6 of 17 (chlorine and hydroxy) compared to 21 (dihydroxy). The 13C NMR chemical shifts of C-5, and C-6 of 17 [\u03b4C 79.5 (C-5) and 75.0 (C-6)] are consistent with those of withanolide C [\u03b4C 80.4 (C-5) and 74.7 (C-6)] [39] and physanicandrolide C [\u03b4C 80.9 (C-5) and 74.5 (C-6)] [40], suggesting the presence of 5\u03b1-Cl, 6\u03b2-OH substituents in 17. The NOESY correlations of H-7\u03b2 [\u03b4H 2.54 (m)]/H-6 [\u03b4H 4.06 (br s)] and H-7\u03b1 [\u03b4H 1.52 (m)]/H-6 in 17 (see Supplementary Data, Figure S61) together with the appearance of H-6 as a broad singlet in its 1H NMR spectrum, confirmed the equatorial orientation of H-6 (i.e., \u03b2-orientation of 6-OH) as in physachenolide A (21) [38]. The ECD spectrum of 17 exhibited a positive Cotton effect at 252 nm and a negative cotton effect at 336 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) establishing the R configuration of C-22 [35,36], and trans-linkage of rings A/B (and hence \u03b1 configuration of Cl-5) [39], respectively. Thus, the structure of 17 was elucidated as 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D [(20S,22R)-18-acetoxy5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2,14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,24-dienolide]. The molecular formula of compound 18 was determined to be C32H43ClO11 by the analysis of its HRESIMS and NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum of 18 (Table 4) resembled that of 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D (17), but exhibited an additional oxygenated methine signal [\u03b4H 5.20 (t, J = 8.8 Hz)], two acetyl methyl signals [\u03b4H 2.08 (s) and 2.09 (s)] besides the typical signals for H-2, H-3, H-22, H2-18, and the methyl groups. These data together with the difference in molecular formulae between 18 (C32H43ClO11) and 17 (C30H41ClO9) suggested that 18 may be an acetoxylated analogue of 17. The 13C NMR spectrum of 18 (Table 4), assigned with the help of HSQC (see Supplementary Data, Figure S47) and HMBC data (see Supplementary Data, Figures S48 and S60), also suggested structural similarities between 18 and 17 except for the carbon signals of ring D, especially C-17 and C-15. The up-field shift of C-17 [\u2206 = \u03b4(10) \u2212 \u03b4(9) = \u22123.5 ppm, \u03b3-effect] and down-field shift of C-16 [\u2206 = \u03b4(10) \u2212 \u03b4(9) = 4.6 ppm, \u03b2-effect] placed the acetoxy substituent at C-15. The orientation of this OAc group was determined to be \u03b1 by the large coupling constant for H-15 [\u03b4H 5.20 (t, J = 8.8 Hz)] in its 1H NMR spectrum, which is identical with that of 15\u03b1-acetoxyphysachenolide D (4) [27]. The NOESY correlations of H-7\u03b2 [\u03b4H 2.61 (m)]/H-6 [\u03b4H 3.97 (br s)] and H-7\u03b1 [\u03b4H 1.54 (m)]/H-6 (see Supplementary Data, Figure S49), together with the appearance of H-6 as a broad singlet in its 1H NMR spectrum, confirmed the orientation of OH-6 of 18 as \u03b2, same as that of 17. The ECD spectrum of 18 exhibited a positive Cotton effect at 252 nm and a negative cotton effect at 335 (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) establishing the R configuration of C-22 and the trans-linkage of rings A/B [35,36]. On the basis of the foregoing evidence, the structure of withanolide 18 was elucidated as 15\u03b1-acetoxy-5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D [(20S,22R)15\u03b1,18-diacetoxy-5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2,14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2-tetrahydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,24-dienolide].\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 11 of 21\na CD3OD was used as the solvent. b CDCl3/CD3OD (100:1) was used as the solvent. c 13C NMR data obtained in CDCl3/CD3OD (100:1) for physachenolide A (21) are included for the purpose of comparison as the reported 13C NMR data for 21 were for CDCl3/DMSO-d6 [38].\nThe molecular formula of compound 19 was deduced to be C30H41ClO10 from its HRESIMS and NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum of 19 (Table 4) displayed signals due protons of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety [\u03b4H 5.83 (dd, J = 10.0, 2.0 Hz, H-2), 6.75 (ddd, J = 10.0, 4.8, 2.0 Hz, H-3)], two oxygenated methylenes [\u03b4H 4.40 (s, H2-18), 4.39 (d, J = 14.0 Hz, H-28), 4.23 (d, J = 14.0 Hz, H-28)], two oxygenated methines [\u03b4H 3.93 (t, J = 2.9 Hz, H-6), 4.90 (m, H-22)], an acetate [2.12 (s)], and three singlet methyls [\u03b4H 1.38 (s), 1.40 (s), 1.89 (s)]. The 13C NMR spectrum of 19 (Table 4) assigned with the help of HSQC (see Supplementary\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 12 of 21\nData, Figure S52) and HMBC data (see Supplementary Data, Figures S53 and S60) closely resembled that of 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D (17), except for the signal assigned to C-28 which appeared at 62.0 ppm compared to that of 17 at 20.7 ppm. The above NMR data together with the difference in molecular formulae of 19 (C30H41ClO10) and 17 (C30H41ClO9) suggested that 19 could be a C-28 hydroxylated analogue of 17. The presence of OH-28 was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H3-27 [\u03b4H 1.89 (s)]/C-26 [\u03b4C 169.2], H2-28/C-25 [\u03b4C 122.5], and H2-28/C-23 [\u03b4C 30.3] (see Supplementary Data, Figure S60). The small coupling constant of H-6 [\u03b4H 3.93 (t, J = 2.9 Hz) indicated the orientation of OH-6 to be \u03b2 similar to those of 17 and 18. The ECD spectrum of 19 exhibited a positive Cotton effect at 255 nm and a negative Cotton effect at 336 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) establishing the R configuration of C-22 and the trans-linkage of rings A/B [35,36]. Based on foregoing evidence, the structure of this withanolide was elucidated as 28-hydroxy-5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrophysachenolide D [(20S,22R)-18-acetoxy5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2,14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2,28-pentahydroxy-1-oxo-witha-2,24-dienolide] (19). Withanolide 20 was determined to have the molecular formula, C31H44O10, based on its HRESIMS and NMR data. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Table 4) displayed signals typical of a withanolide, including those due to two olefinic protons of the 2,3-en-1-one moiety [\u03b4H 5.73 (dd, J = 10.0, 2.8 Hz, H-2), 6.48 (ddd, J = 10.0, 5.2, 2.0 Hz, H-3)], two oxygenated methines [\u03b4H 3.86 (brs, H-6), 4.84 (dd, J = 13.6, 3.2 Hz, H-22)], an oxygenated methylene [\u03b4H 4.37 (d, J = 11.2 Hz, H-18), 4.30 (d, J = 11.2 Hz, H-18)], an acetyl [\u03b4H 2.03 (s)], and four singlet methyls [\u03b4H 1.22 (s), 1.31 (s), 1.82 (s), 1.88 (s)]. A signal due to an OCH3 group [\u03b4H 2.93 (s)] rare in withanolides was also encountered, indicating that 20 is a methoxylated withanolide. Comparison of the 13C NMR data of 20 (Table 4) with those of physachenolide A (21) [38] revealed that the major differences are for C-4, C-5, and C-6 signals of ring A suggesting that one of the OH groups at C-5/C-6 of 21 has undergone methylation to a OCH3 group. It was also found that the 13C NMR signals due to C-4 and C-6 of 20 have shifted up-field by 7.6 and 5.2 ppm (\u03b2-effect), respectively, and C-5 has shifted down-field by 4.0 ppm (\u03b1-effect) compared to those of 21, locating this OCH3 substituent at C-5. The presence of CH3O-5 in 20 was further supported by the HMBC correlation of CH3O/C-5 (see Supplementary Data, Figure S60). The orientation of OH-6 was determined as \u03b2 by the small coupling constant of H-6 similar those of 17\u201319 and 21. The ECD spectrum of 20 exhibited a positive Cotton effect at 257 nm and a negative Cotton effect at 335 nm (see Supplementary Data, Figure S59) establishing the 22R configuration and the translinkage of rings A/B (and hence \u03b1-orientation of CH3O-5) [35,36]. The structure of 20 was thus elucidated as physachenolide-A-5-methyl ether [(20S,22R)-18-acetoxy-6\u03b2,14\u03b1,17\u03b2,20\u03b2tetrahydroxy-5\u03b1-methoxy-1-oxo -witha-2,24-dienolide]. Comparison of the spectroscopic data with those reported led to the identification of the remaining seventeen withanolides as physachenolide A (21) [38], physachenolide D (3) [38], 15\u03b1-hydroxyphysachenolide D (22) [18], 15\u03b1-acetoxyphysachenolide D (4) [27], orizabolide (23) [41], 15\u03b1-acetoxy-28-hydroxyphysachenolide D (24) [19], physacoztolide G (25) [27], 28-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-physachenolide D (26) [27], physachenolide C (8) [38], 15\u03b1-acetoxyphysachenolide C (27) [18], 15\u03b1-hydroxyphysachenolide C (28) [29], 18-deacetylphysachenolide C (29) [29], physacoztolide H (30) [27], withanolide E (5) [42], withaperuvin L (31) [43], physacoztolide D (32) [28], and 18-acetoxy-17-epiwithanolide K (33) [19]. This constitutes the first report of the natural occurrence of 15\u03b1-hydroxyphysachenolide C (28) and 18-deacetylphysachenolide C (29). A small number of chlorinated withanolides have previously been encountered in plants of Solanaceae as minor metabolites and many of these occur as 5,6-chlorohydrins containing 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy substituents [25,44\u201348]. It has been suggested that the chlorine atom present in these 5,6-chlorohydrins may originate from NaCl present in the plant [2]. However, the occurrence of corresponding 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxides as major matabolites in their source plants (as in P. costomatl) suggests that 5,6-chlorohydrins of withanolides may be possible artifacts formed from their corresponding 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxides during the extraction of these plants and/or during the isolation of withanolides. The possibility of formation of\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 13 of 21\nwithanolide chlorohydrins during the isolation process has previously been suggested [49] for which a probable mechanism involving acid catalyzed opening of the 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxy moiety to generate 5,6-chlorohydrins has been proposed [25]. To test this, we exposed the major withanolide of P. coztomatl, physachenolide C (8), to 0.5% methanolic HCl at 25 \u25e6C for 30 min (TLC control). The investigation of the crude product mixture by HPLC suggested that under these mildly acidic conditions, the 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxide ring of physachenolide C (8) underwent an acid-catalyzed ring opening to afford the corresponding 5,6-chlorohydrin [5\u03b1chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxyphysachenolide C (17)], 5\u03b1-methoxy-6\u03b2-hydroxy analogue [physachenolide A-5-methyl ether (19)] and 5\u03b1,6\u03b2-dihydroxy analogue [physachenolide A (21)] (see Supplementary Data, Figure S62), all of which were encountered in P. coztomatl. Additional experiments to investigate whether these withanolides are genuine plant metabolites or artifacts are currently in progress."

            "text": "We have previously discovered that some 17\u03b2-hydroxywithanolides, including physachenolide C (8), were capable of selectively inhibiting the proliferation of prostate cancer cells at nanoMolar concentrations without affecting many other cancer cells and normal human fibroblast cells [19]. In this study, withanolides 3\u20135 and 8\u201333 obtained from aeroponically grown P. crassifolia were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of four human prostate cancer (PC) cell lines, LNCaP and VCaP (androgen-sensitive PC), DU-145 and PC-3 (androgen-independent PC), human renal adenocarcinoma (ACHN) cell line, and normal human fibroblast cells, WI-38. Of those tested, withanolides 8, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 18 showed >50% inhibition against at least one of the cancer cell lines at 5.0 \u00b5M concentration. Significantly, all those showing promising activity were 18-acetoxy-17\u03b2-hydroxywithanolides and these were then evaluated for their IC50s (concentrations required to inhibit 50% of the cells). The IC50 data obtained are depicted in Table 5. It is noteworthy that 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihdrophysachenolide D (17) containing a trans-fused A/B-ring system exhibited cytotoxic activities very close to those of physachenolide C (8) bearing a cis-fused A/B-ring system, against all the cell lines tested (Table 5). This is somewhat surprising as it contradicts our previous finding that the cis-fused A/B-ring conformation (as in 8) is important for the cytotoxic activity of 17\u03b2hydroxywithanolides [33]. This unexpected potent activity of 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6dihydrophysachenolide D (17) and other withanolide 5,6-chlorohydrins may be attributed to the possible conversion of these to their corresponding 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxides in the cell culture medium. To test this, 17 was incubated with the cell culture medium (DMEM) used for the cytotoxicity assays with LNCaP and ACHN cell lines and under the conditions used for the assay (37 \u25e6C in a 5% CO2 incubator). The analysis of the incubation mixture by HPLC at intervals of 0 min, 5 min, 2 h, 8 h, and 24 h, suggested that its conversion to physachenolide C (8) is facile and almost complete in 24 h (Figure 3). Since the cytotoxicity assay involves incubation of the test compound for 72 h in the cell culture medium, it is very likely that the unexpected activity observed for 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxywithanolides is due to the conversion of these into their corresponding 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxywithanolides.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 14 of 21\nMolecules 2022, 27, 909 15 of 21\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 20\nIt is noteworthy that 5\u03b1-chloro-6\u03b2-hydroxy-5,6-dihdrophysachenolide D (17) containing a trans-fused A/B-ring system exhibited cytotoxic activities very close to those of physachenolide C (8) bearing a cis-fused A/B-ring system, against all the cell lines tested (Table 5).

            "text": "Withanolides constitute one of the most interesting classes of natural products due to their diversity of structures and biological activities. The work reported here further supports our previous findings that the application of the aeroponic technique for cultivation of plants of Solanaceae is a convenient, reproducible, and superior method for production and structural diversification of withanolides. Investigation of aeroponically grown Physalis coztomatl afforded 29 withanolides including 12 new withanolides (9\u201320), and 17 known withanolides (3\u20135, 8, and 21\u201333). Evaluation of these withanolides against a panel of prostate cancer (LNCaP, VCaP, DU-145, and PC-3) and renal carcinoma (ACHN) cell lines, and normal human foreskin fibroblast (WI-38) cells suggested that 8, 13, 15, and 17\u201319 had potent and selective activity for prostate cancer cell lines. This work also resulted in the discovery that the potent cytotoxic activity of withanolide 5,6-chlorohydrins may be due to their facile conversion into the corresponding 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxides in the cell culture medium used for the bioassay.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded online.
