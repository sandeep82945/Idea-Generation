Little is known about the criteria that should ideally be considered in the selection of these super users, or about the best way to carve up the roles and responsibilities in this process between super users and middle management. In this study, we investigated (1) which criteria should be emphasized in the selection of super users, and (2) how middle management and super users understand and negotiate the responsibilities of their respective roles during implementation of technological change.\nMethods: We conducted 10 individual semi-structured interviews and used thematic analysis of this data set to identify selection criteria, roles, and responsibilities.\nResults: We found that the main selection criteria for super users should be: (1) availability and local knowledge, (2) technological skills, (3) pedagogical skills, and (4) proactiveness. The main roles and responsibilities that should be carved up between management and super users can be grouped into two overarching categories, each with several subcategories. Within the Learning culture category, the responsibilities are to (1) facilitate collective learning, (2) engage with criticism, and (3) promote collective sharing; and within the Individual learning category, to (4) facilitate individual learning, (5) provide instrumental support, and (6) provide emotional support.\nDiscussion and Conclusion: Based on the findings, we propose a conceptual model of technological implementation and the construction of a culture of organizational learning, entitled ECo-System Of Learning in Organizations (ECSO-Learn); we additionally show how a learning agent (previously known as a super user) can be recruited to best fit into this model of long-term organizational learning.\nKeywords: super user, super user selection, organizational learning, implementation, learning organization\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 928217"

            "text": "Despite numerous attempts to identify the crucial factors involved in the process of successful technological change (e.g., Hong and Kim, 2002; Rizzuto and Reeves, 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2015), research shows that the majority of implementations of new technology are considered unsuccessful (Griffith et al., 1999; Hong and Kim, 2002; Woldesenbet and Klay, 2016). Many organizations tend to focus mostly on the technological aspects of the implementation of new computer systems (Kukafka et al., 2003; Aarts et al., 2004; S\u00e6tren et al., 2016), although the greatest challenges in this process are often linked to behavioral and organizational factors rather than technical ones (Lorenzi and Riley, 2000; S\u00e6tren and Laumann, 2017). There is a need for further research, from a system\u2019s perspective, on which behavioral and organizational factors can affect the process of technological change.\nThe importance of developing employee competence is particularly relevant in the implementation of new computer systems because this often requires employees to learn to use new technology to be able to do their job (Shea and Belden, 2016). If the employees do not learn to use the system effectively, the new technology will fail to increase the organization\u2019s productivity (Woldesenbet and Klay, 2016). In addition, research has shown that non-existent, poor, or inadequate training is directly correlated with low rates of adoption among employees, as well as unsuccessful implementation (Gagnon et al., 2012; S\u00e6tren et al., 2016). Therefore, in any assessment of the human and organizational factors that can contribute to a successful implementation of technological change, training of the employees is regarded as crucial (Wager et al., 2000; \u00c5sand and M\u00f8rch, 2006; Keshavjee et al., 2006; Culler et al., 2009; McAlearney et al., 2012, Sitthidah and StMaurice, 2016). Nevertheless, it turns out that training is often deprioritized and undervalued (McAlearney et al., 2012; Woldesenbet and Klay, 2016)."

            "heading": "Criteria for Selection of a Local Super User",
            "text": "Many organizations choose to use local super users to help other employees with the new system, to increase the chance of successful implementation (Kanter, 1984; O\u2019Leary, 2000; Ash et al., 2003; Whitten and Bentley, 2007; Martinez et al., 2008; Crosson et al., 2011; Gagnon et al., 2012; Sitthidah and StMaurice, 2016). Super users are usually regular employees who receive additional training in the use of a new computer system to be introduced at the workplace, so that they can provide first-line technical support and training to their colleagues locally (\u00c5sand and M\u00f8rch, 2006; Boffa and Pawola, 2006). Although the use of super users is a widespread strategy in the workplace, we lack sufficient understanding of the preferred roles and behaviors of these super users (Shaw et al., 2012; Shea and Belden, 2016; Woldesenbet and Klay, 2016), and there is a lack of psychological research on this topic. The lack of clarity in the literature on super users further prevents the development of research-based approaches\nto identify, support, and assess the impact of super users (Shea and Belden, 2016)."

            "text": "Leadership and management are key factors in the processes associated with all forms of change (Gill, 2002; Herold et al., 2008), and effective leadership has been identified as a key factor in the success of change initiatives (Kotter, 1995; Todnem, 2005; Hornstein, 2015). Leadership can be understood as a set of functions and roles that must be fulfilled to address all important aspects of the workplace and processes occurring within it (Mintzberg, 1990), and the ability to lead employees in a change process is often considered to be one of a leader\u2019s most important tasks (Burnes, 2004; Todnem, 2005). Middle management often plays a central and important role in change processes (Rouleau, 2005; Bryant and Stensaker, 2011), but many middle managers are often stuck handling administrative tasks and addressing the requirements and needs of different parts of the organization (Johansen and Hawes, 2016; Chen et al., 2017). Furthermore, middle managers often implement change processes while maintaining the continuity of the organization\u2019s daily work. A single leader does not necessarily possess all the leadership skills needed to promote optimal efficiency in their teams and groups (Pearce and Manz, 2005). Another crucial factor is the quality of the relationship between the leader or manager and their employees (Anand et al., 2011), which is partly dependent on the relational competencies of the leader, such as altruistic leadership (Salas-Vallina and Alegre, 2018). Although management is most often thought of as vertically organized and executed by a formal and designated leader, leadership can also be understood as a collective phenomenon in which management tasks are distributed among several people in a group (Pearce and Sims, 2002; Morgeson et al., 2010). This form of shared management has also been shown to have a greater impact than traditional vertical management on efficiency in groups (Pearce and Sims, 2002).\nFor these reasons, even though middle managers often act as change agents who manage and make changes to their respective departments in a change process, employees can also play a central role as change agents (Lunenburg, 2010). In the introduction and implementation of new technology, it is common to involve super users as part of the process (Yuan et al., 2015; Shea and Belden, 2016). In the literature on this topic, several studies argue that super users exert a strong influence on whether the implementation of a new technology is successful (Shea and Belden, 2016), and that super users\u2019 contributions can be essential in technological change (Halbesleben et al., 2009; Shea and Belden, 2016)."

The objective in this choice of location was to secure a well-known environment for the informants as well as to respect the demands of their work and avoid taking too much of their time. Each interview lasted approximately 1 h; all were recorded and transcribed.\nAn interview guide was constructed; this included questions covering aspects of the nature of the technological change itself and the change process. The initial part of the interview concerned a normal working day for the informant. This was included to generate a more comfortable atmosphere and allow the informant to talk about a non-controversial and safe topic, while also providing important contextual information. To explore our themes of interest, we additionally included interview sections with questions concerning the role of super users, the demands facing them, the resources required to function effectively as a super user, and the expectations of both the super user role and the role of management in technological change. This section of the interview included questions such as \u201cCan you describe your role as a super user?\u201d and \u201cWhy did you choose to make use of a super user in this project?,\u201d depending on the role of the informant being interviewed. In addition, questions were included about how the new technological system worked and about the informant\u2019s reflections on the consequences of its implementation in the organization. We also asked openended questions concerning the informant\u2019s role as a leader in the change process, for example, \u201cWhat do you see as your most important role as a leader of change processes?\u201d\nAfter conducting six interviews, we found it necessary to revise our interview guide, following the themes that emerged through the initial analysis. Following these themes, we added more specific (but still open-ended) questions relating to the characteristics required of super users, and to the associated roles and responsibilities, and the need for clarification of the allocation of these roles between super users and management: for example, we included the question: \u201cHow would you describe the roles carried out by you as a leader and the super user in praxis?\u201d In addition, themes including the context of the informant\u2019s work, aspects of their use of technology, and consequences of the change were included to allow us to obtain a broad understanding of the implementation process. An example of an open question was \u201cHow would you evaluate the training you received on the new technology?,\u201d and follow-up questions to this could be, for instance, \u201cHow did you perceive this training?\u201d or \u201cWhat did the training consist of?\u201d All interviews ended with a question about whether the informant had anything to add or felt that there was anything we had forgotten to ask about."

Thematic analysis is a flexible approach for the analysis of themes identified in interviews based on a constructive and inductive approach. In addition to this analysis, we conducted a literature review in parallel with the data collection and analysis, in order to obtain an in-depth understanding as part of the analysis process. Although the analysis method consisted of six steps, the process\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 928217\nof analysis was flexible and dynamic, as we shifted back and forth between these steps to make necessary changes as per the research question and purpose of the study. Despite the adoption of an open approach with subjective constructions of the relevant themes, the process of analysis also involved critical thinking and the drawing of comparisons to assess the findings appropriately. During the thematic analysis phase, multiple researchers conducted their analyses in a parallel analysis process. Their individual findings were compared and coordinated to produce a final analysis and construct a model (Braun and Clarke, 2019, 2022).\nThe first step was to become familiar with the data. This was achieved by conducting the interviews and transcribing them before thoroughly reading through the transcripts. During this process, ideas relating to initial categories and patterns emerged, and notes were taken. The second phase consisted of initial coding, in which the material was sorted into codes. Examples of codes from this phase were \u201cThe style of management affected the unit\u201d and \u201cSuper users made their own teaching handbook.\u201d In total, more than 300 codes were identified during this phase. In the third phase, the process of organizing the data into meaningful categories was initiated. This was the point at which we began to discover the underlying themes by applying more in-depth analysis. During this phase, we discovered connections between elements that had not necessarily been obvious from the start of the process (Braun and Clarke, 2022), and these connections formed part of the process of combining the initial codes into themes (Braun and Clarke, 2006). During phase four, the themes were revised. This phase consisted of two sub-phases: in the first, we examined the coded material to ensure that connections were present within the themes; and in the second, we confirmed that the themes identified were congruent with the remainder of the data. As an example of the development of codes, the previously mentioned code relating to super users making their handbooks was included in this fourth phase in the theme \u201cSuper users designed courses for the end users.\u201d During the fifth phase, the researchers identified the essence of each theme and what it represented, as well as identifying which were major themes and which were sub-themes. For instance, within the theme of preferred super user characteristics, the \u201cproactiveness\u201d criterion, which was subsequently incorporated into our ECo-System Of Learning in Organizations (ECSO)Learn model (Figure 1), was developed at this stage. The objective at this point was to ensure that the findings were constructed on a solid foundation and to verify their relevance to the research question. Throughout this entire process, quotations relating to the themes were collected and examined, and memos were written. The process of theme development was inductive, meaning that it was guided by the interview material that was collected rather than being theory driven. The sixth and final phase of thematic analysis was to write down the findings in the form of a scientific article (Braun and Clarke, 2006)."

The third criterion relates to commitment, rigor, and coherence, and includes the requirement to explain the authors\u2019 degree of engagement with the research context, their methodological skills, how the data collection was carried out, and the process of analysis. We have therefore described our relevant background; additionally, every stage of the research, from planning to writing, was conducted by two or more members of the author group.

However, the informants varied with regard to the level of knowledge and skills that they believed to be required. The majority pointed out that the super user must have a high degree of expertise in the system that is to be implemented, and that they must have a full understanding of all the different parts of the system:\n\u201cThe person needs to understand what it is that he or she is a super user of. I think it\u2019s really important (. . . ) You have to have good knowledge of the tools. Simply. The whole toolbox.\u201d\nMany of the super users, however, pointed out that the training they received was not sufficient to enable them to do a good job as a super user. Therefore, if an organization is to avoid investing in extensive training for super users, the choice of super user must be based on who has pre-existing competence with the system, sufficient time to learn about the system on their own and interest\nin doing so, and a special interest in this area and technological skills in general.\n\u201cThe way I see it, it\u2019s hard for me to see who could take the job without it reducing productivity in other work. Because people have pretty much on their table already, and being a super user requires a lot of expertise. And it may require more expertise than what you got through the training.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I hope that those who have become super users had a pretty good basic understanding before they were chosen. Because without that basic understanding, it will become difficult.\u201d\nDespite this perspective, some informants also reported considering it less important to have previous knowledge of the system. Under this view, the super user will be able to do an equally good job as long as they have an interest in and preference for technology in general: \u201cYou should know how to turn on a PC, to put it nicely. You should have some interest in IT and be fond of using technology.\u201d Furthermore, some argued that the most important thing is to know what opportunities lie in the system, where these opportunities can be found, and whom to contact for help.

To be able to adopt the training they provide to the relevant employees, super users should be recruited from the local unit, as this means they will have local knowledge; this was also highlighted in criterion 1, as working in the relevant department means that the super user possesses useful information about routines, the department\u2019s employees, the various work tasks, and the like.

Be a little on edge\u201d; \u201cMaybe come up with some tips and tricks for us without us asking for it. . . \u201d Several of the informants pointed out that there is a lot to learn when a new computer system is implemented, and that it can therefore be difficult for employees to discover all the possibilities that the system offers. For this reason, it is important that the super user has an overview of the various functions, and actively shares information about the possibilities inherent in the system.\n\u201cAs I said, the [employees] do not currently use anything other than e-mail then. . . But it is about making them use a little more of the technology then, the fact that you can make them see the opportunities there. That you as a super user can show that there are many possibilities.\u201d\nSeveral informants also talked about a sense of responsibility and commitment in the role of super user. One of the informants said that 1 year after the system was implemented, she was still setting up internal courses to demonstrate new and useful functions that appeared in the system, in addition to providing training for new employees.\nInterest, Innovativeness, and Willingness to Learn The informants reported that their experience indicated the importance of the super user\u2019s ability to show the employees what opportunities lie in the system. For this reason, a super user\u2019s interest in identifying better ways to accomplish work tasks using technological aids is also considered an important factor. This sub-theme is therefore about being curious and innovative and seeing opportunities rather than challenges in new technology. The informants explained that the super users must be committed and willing to familiarize themselves with the system on their own, in addition to the training they receive: \u201cYou must be willing to learn yourself, I think.\u201d Additionally, the super user needs to be prepared for questions that may come from the employees.\n\u201cThat you understand things quickly. And that you can understand more than exactly what you are told. It has been the idea that when I meet with the unit and they ask about things that I have not been trained in myself, then I have tested it, or found out for myself because that. . . It is not so difficult to train me in technical computer programs. It actually goes pretty fast! That you can. . . that you have an interest in teaching yourself more, but also others.\u201d\nIn addition to this interest in learning the system for themselves, a super user\u2019s commitment must also involve a desire\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 928217\nto help others. The following quotation illustrates how a super user who is curious and eager to learn can explore the system and discover useful features that can make their own and others\u2019 work tasks easier:\n\u201cWhat I see that is useful is a lot of such extensions then, which we have not received any special training in. Which extensions are we going to use. . . and things like that, so there is a lot there that I have found myself then. And so I have told other employees that it may be a good idea to try them, such as an extension that allows you to save everything you copy, so that you get a list of everything that has been copied. (. . . .) I think they could have used me more really. . . Just figuring out how they can use the system, not just coming to me when they have a problem, but maybe also with how they can use it.\u201d\nThe informant\u2019s statement illustrates how the super user\u2019s initiative in training the employees functioned as a good supplement to the training the employees were offered by the workplace, which focused more on the technical aspects of the system than on useful functions. As mentioned above, both employees and super users reported believing that it is important to receive training in the possibilities offered by the system, and not just in how it works. Furthermore, this sub-theme suggests that committed and enterprising super users can contribute to making colleagues\u2019 everyday work more effective through their learning and knowledge sharing.\n\u201cHehe, I am very much a \u2018yes-person.\u2019 I say yes to everything. Now I am also a super user in a new accounting system. . . When you get new systems, it\u2019s fun to be able to influence [things], I get to be involved in influencing both myself and others\u2019 everyday work. When I then get to participate in design and say \u2018here is something missing,\u2019 \u2018here is the potential,\u2019 \u2018this is good. . . \u2019 I was saying, if one is to be a little selfish and think that if someone is going to shape my workday then I would like to help shape how it should be.\u201d\nOne of the informants compared an ideal super user with his views on the ideal employee for an organization more generally.\n\u201cMost important? Eh, \u2018positive,\u2019 \u2018solution-oriented,\u2019 \u2018interested in technology,\u2019 \u2018collaborative.\u2019 This is the employee that the organization wants everyone to be, and that many are. Whoever is positive about change, wants to try something new, is innovative, sees that this opens up smart opportunities to make things easier, smarter. The organization has 15,000 employees, and we cannot hire new people every time there exist new tasks to be done.\u201d\nThe focus on innovation, curiosity, and the ability to see technological possibilities for simplifying work tasks may indicate that the informants also perceive willingness to learn as an important characteristic of a super user."

So one can ask the question: are they then pushed down by the positivity so that they do not dare to say that this is hopeless? Or is it actually the case that the culture is like that, that \u2018we fix this, and we help each other with it?\u2019 I think it\u2019s the last thing.\u201d\nSeveral of the informants also pointed out that units vary in terms of their cultures in relation to being innovative and taking advantage of new opportunities. The quality of the learning culture contributed to how the tool was received by the employees. Several of the leaders described experiencing a positive culture in their own unit:\n\u201cSo yes, I want to say that there is a kind of culture on the unit here. . .

The middle managers and the super users facilitated the learning process among employees. Middle managers could send employees on courses or ask them to go through the training material online, ask for extra help and resources from the project group for training within the department, or request that the super user hold internal training sessions. The super users, in contrast, were often the ones who underwent the actual training and technical review. The informants reported that various forms of training were carried out, and also addressed aspects of these that were particularly relevant to their department:\n\u201cI encourage everyone to attend courses. Those courses were primarily for managers, but I think 2/3 of those who are here went on one. I sent them on that course. Simply so that they would have enough foundation to use it right away. So in that way, I think I have had influence, but at the same time the unit is not very backwards. They work digitally, and we work with a PC, it is our most important tool. . . \u201d\nThe super users were given a high degree of freedom to design the training provided in their own unit.\n\u201cThey were given free rein to do that, there is nothing we can do about it, but we knew that the units had a super user. As the unit leader had approved it, and the unit leader had said that this should be ours. And then there were unit leaders who had given them room to call in for courses, they had set up several courses, they simply took in employees for courses at the unit. Other units that were small, where they ran around when people got the accounts and helped them to their seats instead. True, there are many ways to do this.\u201d\n\u201cSome already had people who were going to say that there is a difference in the demographics of the units in the municipality. We have units that have a lot of people well up in years who may find this difficult, and who have not been so much inside this type of tool, and then we have units that have a lot of young people who then may be more used to it, and may have always used these tools. Always had a Google account and a Gmail. So there was a difference between units and then. But there they had free rein, so there was a lot of variation in how they solved this.\u201d\nSeveral of the informants said that it was largely up to the super users to take the initiative on how the training should take place. The provision of effective training was therefore dependent on the super user\u2019s ability to see what needs and challenges there were in their own department. The super user also had to influence to make this happen in their own department. There was therefore often a collaboration between the super user and the middle manager to achieve this:\n\u201cThe training I ran on my unit was something I initiated myself. I brought it up with the unit manager that this is something I want to do, and she said \u2018run on,\u2019 so then I called in for training and then I ran training on the things I felt they needed, and then they came back with questions, and then I said I was going to run a course on what they were wondering about next week. That\u2019s how it rolls and goes. So it was something I did on my own unit because I felt that\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 928217\nwhat I learned in the tutorial might not be something my unit could handle. So I tried to close the knowledge gaps we had on that unit here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then this fear of using new technology, we have not received any training in that. That is, how, like, the pedagogical way of implementing it. There was no focus. So that was how I had to address it on my own, and find out.\u201d"

It was also particularly important that the super user was present and available in the department when these challenges arose. The informants also emphasized the importance of having a specific person they could contact, who knew about the work in the department and who could easily understand the challenges any given employee faced:\n\u201cYes, I think as far as it has been very good, it is a person we have gone to when we have had questions and we have received good answers.\u201d\n\u201cI do not see how it could be done differently. Because then you always have one on the unit. If you were to hire a person, that person would have to come here and be instructed, then it would always be the case that you had to contact that person, and then the work would stop all the time until that person had come then. But since we have a super user on the unit who is here on a daily basis, you are always available.\u201d\nAlthough super users were happy to help solve problems, they often had to seek help from other parts of the organization as well.

            "text": "In this qualitative study, we investigated (1) which criteria should be emphasized in the selection of super users, and (2) how middle management and super users understand and negotiate the responsibilities of their respective roles during the implementation of technological change. In our analysis, we found that several relevant characteristics and skills should be taken into consideration in the selection of a super user, including local knowledge and pedagogical skills. We also found that the roles and responsibilities of management staff and super users could be grouped under two main headings of fostering individual learning and fostering a collective learning culture. This finding is in accordance with a socio-cultural perspective on learning, and with how Lave (1991) and Wenger (1998) describe how learning is situated, and how it occurs on both individual and collective levels through interactions in, what they describe as, communities of practice.\nBased on our findings, we proposed a conceptual model (Figure 1) of the process of selecting a super user, whom we now refer to as a learning agent, and clarify the allocation of roles and responsibilities between this learning agent and management to ensure that new technology is implemented broadly and comes into use widely, as well as the process of building a long-term culture of organizational learning.\nThe basic premise of this model is to combine a systems approach with the perspective of organizational learning. A systems approach is based on considering the organization from a systematic rather than an individual perspective (Leveson, 2020). The adoption of such an approach encourages\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 928217\ncustomization of the system to make it as reliable as possible in enabling individuals and groups to carry out their jobs in an optimal way. Through optimization of the daily working context for the humans involved and the tasks they are to perform, the organization will run smoothly.\nFor these reasons, management must provide the relevant tools and coordinate the relevant environmental factors in such a way as to enable employees to focus on their core tasks. This includes social structures as well as instrumental and physical factors (Leveson, 2020). During a change process, this becomes particularly important, as changes always will consume additional resources and change is regarded as a stress factor. One of the most important factors in enabling an organization to maintain productivity during this time of stress is the provision of extra resources to employees, such as a local super user. Our results show that the super user (whom we now refer to as the learning agent) is not only responsible for being an expert in the system or technology that is undergoing implementation within the organization; a local learning agent should also have expertise in learning and in process and knowledge management, with extended roles that should be clarified in consultation with the local manager. This is somewhat in line with Rizoto-Vidala-Pesoa and Kuzn\u0327ecova\u2019s (2017) suggestion that a super user should have a permanent process management role in their organization. However, our argument is specifically that learning agents should be involved in the facilitation of their organization\u2019s learning culture.\nFor a social working environment to support a culture of learning, it must encourage its inhabitants to engage in critical thinking. The data presented in the current study\nhave provided examples of embracing critical thinking, as the informants were open to suggestions that would enable them to exploit the local knowledge of learning agents. Critical thinking and open discussion in an environment of psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999) are important features of any highly reliable, resilient organization with a strong culture of learning (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2015; Leveson, 2020). To perceive new opportunities and identify new ways to optimize work processes and the social aspect of the working environment, it is very important to adopt a critical outlook and embrace critical thinking. Thus, organizations should tailor their systems to include critical voices. This could, for instance, be achieved by rewarding individuals who can express disagreement in a respectful matter and demonstrating an inclusive approach to skepticism by bringing critical voices to the table and discussing criticism openly. For this reason, social interaction is an important factor in an organizational learning culture or a learning organization (Figure 2)."

In our data analysis and the ECSO-Learn model, we suggest that local learning agents should be recruited from their local units; this enables the learning process to take place while work is being carried out, with the learning agent as a learning facilitator. In our model, this consideration is linked to the individual learning process in operation within a learning organization: in particular, the manager and learning agent need to clarify which roles each serves in this process, covering the facilitation of individual learning, as well as any necessary social and emotional support in the process.\nIn a second vision of the learning organization, \u00d6rtenblad (2018) puts forward the view that a learning organization is an organization with a climate for learning, in which organizations facilitate learning processes by making room for trial and error. This issue is linked to our group of factors that relate to the learning culture: specifically, the optimal learning culture is one in which the manager, learning agent, and organizational members all contribute to the facilitation of collective learning, engage in critical thinking, and promote collective sharing.\nUnder the third vision, a learning organization focuses on facilitating organizational learning (as opposed to merely individual learning). In our analysis and the ECSO-Learn model, this factor is represented by the learning culture as well as the continuous, circular learning process in which influence occurs in all directions between the learning culture, the manager, the learning agent, individual employees, and the desired outcome. From this perspective, organizational memory is upheld through this continuous learning cycle and the learning culture is supported through collective learning, sharing, and critical thinking.\nThese results, and the proposed model, are in line with the collective, relational, situated, and emerging aspects of organization and leadership (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Barker, 1997, 2001; Mintzberg, 2004; Alvesson and Spicer, 2012; Tourish, 2013), within which an individual (either a manager or a super user or learning agent) should be viewed as part of a collective set of processes. Furthermore, the results are also in line with previous descriptions of learning processes that occur among experienced leaders during their participation in university degree programs, which have underlined the importance of collaborative activities in learning (Rennemo and Vaag, 2018). The results also relate to the integrative approach put forward by Chiva and Alegre (2005)."

Through dialogue with the local manager, the learning agent ideally clarifies their roles and responsibilities to contribute to the circular learning process. It will be easier to recruit learning agents to facilitate learning processes on both the organizational and the individual levels in an organization with a mature learning culture.

The introduction of new technology is a complete routine but also an important occurrence in modern organizational life, and a successful implementation phase is crucial. A typical organization is likely to implement new technology regularly, and our research provides an understanding of the optimal process involved in accomplishing this.\nOur project involved a major technological implementation in a Norwegian municipality within the context of the Norwegian organization model. An investigation of the understanding and use of super users should also be conducted within other contexts. We did also choose to use informants in this project that were more involved with the use of the technology daily. Thus, although the informants are from different units, the informants may consider themselves to be from the same community of practice (Lave, 1991; Wenger, 1998). Our organization at hand could also be described as a fairly stable organization, with a less degree of turnover than one could expect. In cases where the new\ntechnology is less a part of the daily working routine and tasks (or less a part of their domain), and/or the members of the unit are less fixed, we probably could expect it to be more of a challenge to recruit members from the learning culture (or the community of practice) to be super users. Conceptually, the ECSO-Learn model should be critically investigated and linked to existing models of organizational learning. This should involve research employing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, investigating how it is applicable when the technology is less a part of the daily routine. More qualitative and observational research is needed to understand the specific components and processes involved in the provision of learning at the organizational and individual level, involving a larger variety of informants than in this project, from different contexts.\nA survey based on the model should be designed, validated, and tested to promote organizational learning and to determine the most relevant and important aspects of the learning agent\u2019s roles and responsibilities.

Pedagogical competence and an engaged, proactive, and collaborative attitude are also prominent in the descriptions of the skills required for learning agents (super users). We also found that learning processes related to the introduction of new technology should not be separated from the more general continued organizational learning processes that are in operation in an organization. The learning agent and manager should each be engaged in the process of facilitating learning on the organizational, cultural, and individual levels to facilitate long-term organizational learning processes, in a pattern described by the model that we have termed the ECSO.\nIn layperson\u2019s terms, the super user should not be a technological Superman recruited from the planet Krypton, but rather a Clark Kent recruited from next door, with insight into both the new technology and the uniqueness of the organization, as well as the pedagogical and collaborative skills needed to facilitate learning."
