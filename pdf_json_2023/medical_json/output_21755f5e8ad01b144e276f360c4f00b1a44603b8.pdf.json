The influences of pseudo-in situ moisture on CH4 adsorption/ desorption in the shales were explored at 353.15 K and pressures up to 30 MPa by using the volumetric method. Results showed that the pseudo-in situ moisture content of the shales ranges between 0.57% and 0.94%, which positively correlates with clay mineral content but negatively correlates with organic matter and quartz. The clay minerals contribute more to moisture occurrence mainly via adsorption effect. The pores with the diameters of 1.10\u20134.10 nm of the shales serve as dominant space for accommodating moisture. Moreover, the pseudo-in situ moisture reduces saturated adsorption capacity and isosteric adsorption heat of CH4 on the shales, suggesting the weakened adsorption affinity toward CH4-shale system. Typically, the minor pseudo-in situ moisture could significantly weaken CH4 adsorption capability of the shales with low clay mineral content through blocking pore throats of organic matter\u2013hosted pores. However, the abundant pseudo-in situ moisture only slightly reduces CH4 adsorption capability of the shales with high clay mineral content due to continuous distribution of organic matter\u2013hosted pores. The aforementioned different roles are dominated by the difference in occurrence characteristics of organic matter\u2013hosted pores and clay mineral-hosted pores between the shales with low clay mineral content and the shales with high clay mineral content. Furthermore, the pseudo-in situ moisture strengthens CH4 adsorption/desorption hysteresis on the shales associated with moisture uptake-induced clay mineral swelling, thereby raising difficulty for CH4 desorption from the shales.",

            "text": "Shale gas, an important category of unconventional natural gas, is pivotal to reduce dependence on foreign oil and gas resources and address environmental issues caused by massive consumption of traditional fossil fuels for China.1,2 The key component of shale gas is methane (CH4). It mainly occurs within shale reservoirs in physisorption state in nano-scale pores of organic matter and inorganic minerals,3 free state in large-scale pores and fractures, and dissolution state in kerogen or asphaltene.4\u20136 Among them, the volume fraction of in situ physiosorbed CH4 always occupies 40\u201385% of the total shale gas reserves.7,8 Thus, further knowledge on CH4-shale adsorption\ns Enrichment Mechanisms and Effective\nail: plum0627@163.com\noration & Production, SINOPEC, Beijing\ng University of Science and Technology,\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nsystem is critical to reveal occurrence mechanism of shale gas, thereby beneting its exploration and production.\nUp to now, CH4-shale adsorption system has been well investigated. Many studies indicate that adsorption capability of shale matrix for CH4 depends on the critical physicochemical properties of shale matrix and reservoir conditions such as pressure and temperature. The former mainly comprises total organic carbon (TOC) content, thermal maturity, inorganic mineral compositions, and moisture.9 Concretely, organic matter develops abundant nano-scale pores,10,11 particularly the micropores with pore diameters below 2.00 nm, thereby serving as main adsorption sites for CH4 molecules. Thus, the studies on the Lower Silurian Longmaxi shales in the Sichuan Basin in China,12 the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian shales in Appalachia Basin in America,13 the Upper Triassic Yan-Chang shales in Ordos Basin in China,14 the Devonian-Mississippian Woodford shales in America,15 the Paleozoic shales in south China,16 and the Cambrian shales in the Yangtze Platform in China indicate the remarkably positive correlation between CH4\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29291\u201329307 | 29291\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Some studies found that the elevated thermal maturity of organic matter could accommodate more adsorption sites,18,19 thereby increasing CH4 adsorption capacity normalized by TOC on shale matrix. However, thermal maturity of shale reservoirs increases with burial depth. As the reservoir depth increases, the enhanced compaction could lead to negative impact of thermal maturity on CH4 adsorption capacity of high or overmature shales through reducing adsorption space.20\u201322 Apart from organic matter, shale matrix is abundant in various inorganic minerals. Thereinto, the clay minerals, typically including kaolinite, smectite, illite, and chlorite, contain plentiful micropores, contribute greatly to CH4 adsorption on shale matrix.23\u201326\nNotably, there is always moisture existing in shale gas systems. Moisture molecules are prone to occupy hydrophilic clay mineral-hosted pores or block organic matter-hosted pore throat.11,27,28 Under such situations, moisture could take up adsorption sites or isolate pores from CH4.29 As a result, even minor moisture with mass fraction of 0.72\u2013 7.05% could remarkably decrease the saturated CH4 adsorption capacity of the shale samples derived from the Langmuir model tting by 16.67\u201381.82%.30 It has been reported that CH4 and CO2 adsorption as single component or mixed gases decreases with increasing amount of moisture in shales.31 Besides, given the striking effects of moisture on gas adsorption in shales, many mathematical models including the modied Langmuir model and the absolute adsorption model have been developed to describe the CH4 adsorption on wet shale samples.32\u201334\nDespite those considerable efforts have been made on occurrence rules of moisture in gas-bearing shales and their impacts on CH4 adsorption, there still exist some critical pending issues. One issue is that most studies on CH4 adsorption on dry or moist shales were conducted under mild pressures (7\u201325 MPa) and temperatures (298.15\u2013348.15 K).29,35\u201338 However, the practical reservoir temperature and pressure corresponding to dessert area of shale gas in China are always greater than 353.15 K and 30 MPa, respectively.39 Thus, the knowledge on CH4 adsorption capability of shales and its correlation with moisture under favorable reservoir conditions is required. More importantly, compared with widely studied CH4 adsorption on shales, the insight to CH4 desorption capability of shales makes more sense to shale gas production as the adsorbed gas can only be recovered aer desorption. However, the inuence and mechanism of moisture on CH4 desorption on shales are still unknown.\nIn order to bridge the aforementioned knowledge gap, the occurrence rules of pseudo-in situ moisture in the deep shales originated from the representative shale gas producing area were revealed to explore the moisture effects on gas desorption under more reasonable reservoir conditions. The pseudo-in situ moisture dependence of adsorption/desorption capability of shales under favorable reservoir conditions was also addressed. Finally, the implications for shale gas exploration and production were indicated.\n29292 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29291\u201329307"

The moisture content of shale matrix is highly dependent on organic matter and inorganic minerals as previously indicated. Hence, the correlation analysis was made in Fig. 3. Overall, the negative correlation exists between pseudo-in situ moisture content and TOC content (Fig. 3a) and quartz content (Fig. 3b), which highly depends on strong hydrophobicity of organic matter and quartz.58\u201360 Oppositely, the clay minerals favor moisture occurrence (Fig. 3c). The clay minerals such as illite with high cation exchange capacity own strong hydrophilicity.61 Thus, they can combine H2O molecules via hydration of exchangeable cationic within the interlamellar space of clay minerals.62 Additionally, the micropores within the interlamellar space, the interparticle\nles, (a) K1, (b) K3, (c) K5, (d) K7, and (e) K10.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29291\u201329307 | 29297\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The minor alterations found for the dry and moist shale samples imply that the micropores may not be the dominant pore space for accommodating the pseudo-in situ moisture.\nBased on the classication criteria recommended by the Brunauer\u2013Deming\u2013Deming\u2013Teller method,64 all the N2 adsorption isotherms displayed in Fig. 5 belong to Type IV. Despite that the pseudo-in situ moisture does not alter the adsorption mechanism of N2 on the shales, it notably shis down the adsorption/desorption isotherms for all the dry shales. This changing trend conrms that majority of the pores characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption method are occupied by the pseudo-in situ moisture. Moreover, the hysteresis phenomenon, i.e., separation between adsorption branch and desorption branch associated with capillary condensation of N2 molecules in mesopore space,65 exists for all the shales. According to the correlation between pore shape of porous media and hysteresis loop type,45 all the hysteresis loops belong to Type H4, probably indicating abundant narrow slit-like pores in the dry and moist shales.\nAs for each shale sample, the pseudo-in situmoisture cannot alter its micropore parameters (Smicro, Vmicro, and Dmicro) but obviously reduce the mesopore surface area and volume (Table 3). To further reveal dominant pores of the deep gas-bearing shale samples for pseudo-in situ moisture occurrence, the differential micro- and mesopore volume distribution proles obtained from the CO2 adsorption data and the N2 adsorption data, respectively, are plotted in Fig. 6. The difference found in the proles clearly indicates that the pores with diameters of 1.10\u20134.10 nm dominate the pseudo-in situ moisture occurrence for each shale sample. Both organic matter, kerogen in particular, and clay minerals contribute to formation and evolution of pores of shale matrix.66\u201368 Currently, the micropore parameter analysis toward the natural and organic matter-free shales by using CO2 adsorption method suggests that organic matter\u2013 hosted pores rather than clay mineral-hosted pores contribute more to the pores with diameters below 1.10 nm.69 Other studies also indicate that the organic matter and clay minerals mainly dominate micro- and mesopore development, respectively.70\u201372 Meanwhile, the organic matter of all the deep gas-bearing shales tested in this study exhibits strong hydrophobicity as veried by the negative correlation displayed in Fig. 3a. The combination of these two points could explain the unnoticeable alterations in distribution proles with pore diameters less than 1.10 nm between the dry and moist shale\n29298 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29291\u201329307\nsamples (Fig. 6). Moreover, it is found from Table 3 and Fig. 6c and d that the pseudo-in situ moisture signicantly alter the pore structure of the samples K5 and K7 with the higher clay mineral content (Table 1). Such agreement demonstrates the positive effect of clay minerals on moisture occurrence. Furthermore, the moisture occurrence in shale matrix mainly comprises adsorbed moisture, water clusters, and condensed water.30 As illustrated in Fig. 7,30 the moisture adsorption oen occurs in micropores and partial mesopores with small diameters at low relative humidity; the water clusters formed due to hydrogen bond interactions between adjacent water molecules are formed at medium relative humidity;73 the water condensation only occurs in macropores with preferable sites at high relative humidity.60 Therefore, in accordance with the relative humidity determined for preparing moist shale samples and pore diameter range alterations, the pores with diameters of 1.10\u20134.10 nm are most likely the dominant interaction space between the pseudo-in situ moisture and the shales. The aforementioned moisture occurrence mechanism also explains the unchanged distribution proles within diameters between 4.10 nm and 34.00 nm.\n3.3 Inuences of pseudo-in situmoisture on CH4 adsorption equilibrium\nFig. 8 displays the GSE adsorption isotherms at the favorable reservoir conditions. All the isotherms display a maximum in the adsorption amount with rising pressure. The maximum pattern and the reason for that have been widely reported.74\u201376 The pseudo-in situ moisture notably reduces CH4 adsorption capacity for each dry shale. In order to quantitatively explore the aforementioned negative impact, the Ono\u2013Kondo (O\u2013K) lattice theory with advantages of predicting adsorption equilibrium behaviors of various uids under reservoir conditions was employed in this study.57,77 This model is derived based on thermodynamic equilibrium theory with the following linear form:56\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Notably, the adsorption temperature (353.15 K) and\nFig. 10 Illustration for negative impacts of pseudo-in situ moisture on C\n29300 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29291\u201329307\nthe maximal adsorption equilibrium pressure (30 MPa) are far above the critical temperature (190.55 K) and critical pressure (4.59 MPa) of CH4.82 Therefore, the CH4-shale is a supercritical adsorption system, which is provided with the two adsorptionlayer pattern.77 The saturated adsorption capacity (n0) obtained from eqn (5) for each shale is listed in Fig. 9.\nn0 = 2am (5)\nOverall, the pseudo-in situ moisture reduces the saturated CH4 adsorption capacity of the dry shales by 1.65\u201350.64%. The aforementioned negative impacts of the pseudo-in situmoisture can be divided into the following two mechanisms through combining Table 2 and Fig. 9. In general, the organic matter\u2013 hosted pores instead of the clay mineral-hosted pores of shale matrix own stronger adsorption affinity to CH4 molecules.74 Thus, the adsorbed CH4 molecules are prone to occupy the organic matter\u2013hosted pores. As for the samples K1, K3, and K10 with relatively lower pseudo-in situ moisture content, the moisture occurrence signicantly reduces the saturated CH4 adsorption capacity by 15.69\u201350.64%. It is deduced that the organic matter-hosted pore throats of these shale samples could be blocked by water molecules,36,60 therefore remarkably weakening CH4 adsorption capability (Fig. 10a). Oppositely, the pseudo-in situ moisture mainly occurs in the clay minerals of the samples K5 and K7 with relative high clay mineral content (Table 1). The moisture cannot affect the organic matter\u2013hosted pores mainly accommodating adsorbed CH4 molecules. Thus, even high pseudo-in situ moisture content only decreases the\nH4 adsorption on shale matrix.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The aforementioned mechanisms can be veried by the difference in surface morphology between the shales with low clay mineral content and the shales with high clay mineral content. As displayed in Fig. 11, all the shale samples comprise few organic matter and majority of inorganic minerals. Among them, the organic matter of the samples K1, K3, and K10 sparsely and unevenly disperses within the matrix in the form of small aggregates, where develop abundant organic matter hosted-pores and fractures. Moreover, those organic matter usually coexists with inorganic minerals, clay minerals in particular. Considerable organic matter ll fractures formed by inorganic minerals. Overall, uid accessibility and migration within organic matter\u2013hosted pores of the samples K1, K3, and K10 are signicantly affected by the clay mineral hosted-pores. Unlike the aforementioned shale\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nsamples, the organic matter containing in the samples K5 and K7 continuously distributes within the matrix as massive aggregates with width up to approximately 60 mm. Thus, the moisture occurrence in the clay mineral-hosted pores of the samples K5 and K7 do not show distinct impacts on CH4 adsorption on the organic matter\u2013hosted pores.\nMoreover, the isosteric adsorption heat (q0) characterizing adsorption thermodynamics can be obtained from eqn (6).57 As shown in Fig. 12, the isosteric adsorption heat of CH4 of the dry shale is greater than that on the moist shales. Thus, the decreasing isosteric adsorption heat implies that the pseudo-in situ moisture weakens the adsorption affinity toward CH4-shale system.\nq0 = qv \u2212 3ANA (6)\nwhere qv is dened as vaporization enthalpy for CH4 is 8.15 kJ mol\u22121 corresponding to boiling point and standard atmospheric pressure;57 NA is the Avogadro's constant.\n3.4 Roles of pseudo-in situ moisture in CH4 adsorption/ desorption hysteresis\nThe knowledge on CH4 desorption rather than its adsorption should be given more priority to guide shale gas production. Hence, the impacts of pseudo-in situ moisture on CH4 desorption capability of shale samples are also investigated. The adsorption/desorption hysteresis is found for all the CH4-shale systems (Fig. 13). Furthermore, the pseudo-in situ moisture strengthens hysteresis for all the dry shales. To denitely address the impacts, the hysteresis index (HI) is employed in this study. The absolute adsorption isotherm representing actual adsorption amount derived from eqn (7) is shown in Fig. 14. Aerward, the hysteresis index for all the shales can be calculated from integral areas corresponding to absolute adsorption/desorption isotherms as indicated in eqn (8).6,83\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29291\u201329307 | 29301\nFig. 13 GSE adsorption/desorption isotherms of CH4 on deep shale samples at 353.15 K, (a) K1, (b) K3, (c) K5, (d) K7, and (e) K10.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Currently, the capillary condensation theory is always used to interpretate hysteresis phenomenon, especially for N2 adsorption/desorption on various porous media.84 However, the operating temperature far above the critical temperature of CH4 as previously indicated cannot make CH4 be liqueed. Therefore, the capillary condensation theory cannot address the hysteresis found in this study. Instead, the hysteresis is probably relevant to uid uptake-induced swelling of clay minerals. As for the dry shales, the adsorption of CH4 could induce matrix swelling.85 The resultant narrowed pore throat goes against CH4 desorption (Fig. 16b), thus leading to adsorption/desorption hysteresis of CH4 on the dry shales.

The occurrence of pseudoin situ moisture is also capable of inducing swelling of clay minerals, which mainly comprises crystalline swelling and osmotic swelling.86 The detailed interpretation regarding the mechanism of the above-mentioned swelling can be found in ref. 87 and 88. It is noteworthy that H2O uptake instead of CH4 adsorption could induce more remarkable swelling of clay minerals. Hence, the pore throat could become highly narrowed (Fig. 16d), which could further raise difficulty to CH4 desorption from moist shale matrix. Therefore, the adsorption/desorption hysteresis of CH4 on the moist samples tends to be more pronounced.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry"

Currently, the terahertz wave has been demonstrated as a competitive noncontact spectroscopic technique to monitor trace moisture. Fan et al. indicate that the limit of detection of moisture reaches 62 ppm under the atmosphere of CH4 with pressure of 10 MPa via terahertz wave.89 Hence, the integration of terahertz wave into current volumetric method or gravimetric method could become a novel and effective option to calibrate CH4 adsorption capacity of moist shales.\nMoreover, the occurrence of moisture in shale not only explains how the moisture impairs the gas adsorption but also gives insights into the moisture effect on gas transport, which is meaningful for shale gas recovery. On the other hand, the moisture effect on gas desorption claries the low contribution of adsorbed gas to gas production. Meanwhile, it suggests promising methods to improve the adsorbed gas recovery. For instance, microwave irradiation is expected to serve as an auxiliary technology to existing hydraulic fracturing to highefficiently produce shale gas. Concretely, microwave with frequency range of 0.3\u2013300 GHz is hopeful to eliminate negative impacts of moisture on shale gas production. Microwave irradiation is highlighted in volumetric and selective heating.90 The liquid moisture molecules own strong electric dipoles with dipole moment of 2.3\u20133.1 D.91\u201393 Therefore, the dipoles in moisture molecules could rotate in ultrahigh frequency under alternating electric eld induced by microwave energy,94 thereby further leading to rapid temperature rising of moisture molecules. Accordingly, microwave irradiation is capable of draining reservoir moisture and eliminating its negative impacts on CH4 desorption found in this study as well as the moisture-induced blocking effect and the Jamin effect.67 Consequently, microwave irradiation as an auxiliary technology to hydraulic fracturing could be employed to secondary shale gas production.\nn/desorption hysteresis on shale matrix.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
