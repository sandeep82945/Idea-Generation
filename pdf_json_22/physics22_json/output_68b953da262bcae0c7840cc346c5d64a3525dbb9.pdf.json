    "abstractText": "The new CDF II measurement of W-boson mass shows a 7\u03c3 deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, while the recent FNAL measurement of the muon g \u2212 2 shows a 4.2\u03c3 deviation (combined with the BNL result) from the SM. Both of them strongly indicate new physics beyond the SM. In this work we study the implication of both measurements on low energy supersymmetry. With an extensive exploration of the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we find that in the parameter space allowed by current experimental constraints from colliders and dark matter detections, the MSSM can simultaneously explain both measurements on the edge of 2\u03c3 level, taking theoretical uncertainties into consideration . The favored parameter space, characterized by a compressed spectrum between bino, wino and stau, with the stop being around 1 TeV, may be covered in the near future LHC searches.",

China (Dated: June 14, 2022)\nThe new CDF II measurement of W-boson mass shows a 7\u03c3 deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, while the recent FNAL measurement of the muon g \u2212 2 shows a 4.2\u03c3 deviation (combined with the BNL result) from the SM. Both of them strongly indicate new physics beyond the SM. In this work we study the implication of both measurements on low energy supersymmetry. With an extensive exploration of the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we find that in the parameter space allowed by current experimental constraints from colliders and dark matter detections, the MSSM can simultaneously explain both measurements on the edge of 2\u03c3 level, taking theoretical uncertainties into consideration . The favored parameter space, characterized by a compressed spectrum between bino, wino and stau, with the stop being around 1 TeV, may be covered in the near future LHC searches.\nKeywords: W-boson mass, Supersymmetry, Muon g-2, Large Hadron Collider\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAfter the discovery of Higgs boson, the main task of high energy physics is to precisely test the Standard Model (SM) and probe new physics beyond the SM. For the probe of new physics, the direct search of new particles is obviously the best way, which of course needs rather high energy. So far only the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has such an ability for directly probing TeV scale new physics and the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will continue the task of direct searches of new particles. On the other hand, new physics will contribute through loops to electroweak observables like the W-boson mass and the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g\u22122). Hence the precision measurements of electroweak observables and the muon g \u2212 2 can reveal the quantum effects of new physics and allow for an indirect probe.\nAlthough direct searches of new physics at the LHC have merely given disappointing results to date, two exciting harbingers of new physics have appeared, one is the measurement of muon g \u2212 2 and the other is the measurement of Wboson mass:\n\u2022 The muon g\u22122 from the recent FNAL measurement [1], combined with the BNL result, has a value which is 4.2\u03c3 above the SM prediction [2\u201322]\n\u2206aExp\u2212SM\u00b5 = a Exp \u00b5 \u2212 aSM\u00b5 = (2.51 \u00b1 0.59) \u00d7 10\u22129.

Among various new physics theories in the literature, the most popular candidate for TeV-scale new physics has been the low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) (for recent reviews see, e.g., [24\u201326]). There are numerous motivations for low energy SUSY, in which the most appealing ones are the solution or alleviation of the naturalness problem, the natural explanation of dark matter (DM) and the realization of gauge coupling unification. All these virtues may not be just a coincidence and instead they suggest that low energy SUSY may be the true story of nature. Actually, the 125 GeV Higgs boson discovered by the LHC is within the mass range predicted by low energy SUSY, which implies heavy stops above TeV (heavy stops are needed to push up the SMlike Higgs boson to 125 GeV). So the un-observation of any sparticles at the LHC, which has pushed up colored sparticles above TeV, is just consistent with the discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the framework of SUSY.\nConfronted with the two deviations, i.e. the W-boson mass and muon g \u2212 2, what is the situation of low energy SUSY ? In this work we restrain our analysis to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) which has the most economic particle content. We note that recently there are many studies on the MSSM contributions to muon g \u2212 2 and the MSSM parameter space allowed by other constraints (including DM) is shown to be able to explain the muon g \u2212 2 at 2\u03c3 level (see, e.g., [27\u201342]). Interestingly, the light electroweakinos and sleptons required for the muon g \u2212 2 explanation in the MSSM are partially accessible at the HL-LHC [32]. Confronted with the latest CDF II measurement of the W-boson mass, we should examine the MSSM parameter space allowed by current collider and DM experiments to figure out whether this model can accommodate this new measured MW value.\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n04 20\n2v 3\n[ he\npph\n] 1\n3 Ju\nn 20\n22\n2 This is the aim of this work.

The results are displayed in Section IV. Finally, we give a summary in Section V."

This relation arises from comparison between the prediction for muon decay with the Fermi constant.

            "text": "We investigate the prediction for MW in the MSSM by performing scan of the parameter space, considering relevant experimental constraints. We employ SUSY-HIT-1.5 [45] to generate the mass spectrum and decay tables of sparticles, and then use the package FeynHiggs-2.18.1 [46\u201353] to recalculate the Higgs and sparticles masses, as well as electroweak precision observables including the W-bosom mass MSUSYW 1 , the loop corrections to the \u03c1 parameter \u2206\u03c1, the effective leptonic weak mixing angle at the Z-resonance, sin2\u03b8\u0302(MZ). The muon g \u2212 2 is further evaluated by GM2Calc [54]. We also employ SuperIso v4.1 [55, 56] to calculate the flavor physics observables, and MicrOMEGAs-5.2.13 [57] to calculate DM relic density, direct and indirect detection cross sections. The packages HiggsBounds-5.10.2 [58] and HiggsSignals-2.6.2 [59] are used to apply constraints at colliders on SM-like and extra Higgs bosons. The SUSY direct searches at LHC are implemented by SModelS-2.1.1 [60\u201362] and CheckMATE-2.0.26 [63, 64].\nWe adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and MultiNest [68] algorithm to perform the scan of MSSM parameter space, using EasyScan HEP [69] . The Gaussian distributed constraints are implemented in the likelihood to guide the scan, which are listed in Table I and take the form of\nlnL = \u2212 \u2211\ni\n(\u00b5\u0302i \u2212 \u00b5i)2 2(\u03c32i + \u03c4 2 i ) \u2212 1 2 \u03c72HiggsSignals, (9)\nwhere \u00b5\u0302i denotes the predicted value of observable i, \u00b5i is the corresponding central value of experimental measurement, \u03c3i and \u03c4i are experimental and theory uncertainties respectively. Besides, the \u03c72 value of Higgs measurements derived from HiggsSignals with 3 GeV theoretical uncertainty on SMlike Higgs mass is also included. The ranges and priors of input parameters are shown in Table II. We neglect possible flavor violation in the SUSY sector.\n1 We discard samples that FeynHiggs-2.18.1 gives an warning about questionable Ab from DR to OS conversion, which may give untruest large MSUSYW .\nHere we do not intend to do a global fit study (see, e.g., [70, 71]) with such high dimension parameter space. So we collect all the samples, not only the reserved samples of the algorithms, and then discard the samples excluded by each of\nabove experimental constraints at 95% confidence level (CL). Note that the DM relic density restriction is implemented as an upper limit, so as to permit additional non-neutralino component. Moreover, the 90% CL bounds from the XENON-1T experiment [72, 73] on the spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon scattering cross-sections are applied, assuming the additional non-neutralino DM component has no interaction with nucleon. Finally, all the samples are further required to pass all the restrictions from HiggsBounds, SModelS and CheckMATE."

            "heading": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS",
            "text": "We find in our scan that all constraints listed in Table I and mh1 = 125.25 \u00b1 0.17 GeV [65] with 3 GeV theoretical uncertainty can be satisfied simultaneously at 2\u03c3 CL, without obvious conflicts. However, after further applying the 90% CL spin-independent limits of Xenon1T for DM direct detection, the surviving samples are characterized by light stops, sbottoms and sleptons. Therefore, we test the samples consisting with the CDF II measurement of MW at 2\u03c3 CL using SModelS, which implements constraints from SUSY direct searches at LHC by interpreting simplified-model results. Here the 2\u03c3 CL constraints are applied independently, so the overall confidence level of each displayed point is stricter than 2\u03c3 level [74].\nAlthough most of them are excluded by SModelS, there are two kind of samples surviving, as displayed in Fig. 1 by yellow and green bullets. The first case is obviously that the sparticles are relatively heavy. The other case is that the mass\n4 spectrum is compressed or in special structure. For example, we find that some surviving samples satisfy the condition of\nme\u03031,\u00b5\u03031 > m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 ,m\u03c7\u030302 > m\u03c4\u03031 . (10)\nTherefore, wino-dominated \u03c7\u0303\u00b11 and \u03c7\u0303 0 2 mainly decay to \u03c4\u03031\u03bd\u03c4 and \u03c4\u03031\u03c4 respectively, and then \u03c4\u03031 decay to \u03c4\u03c7\u030301. Meanwhile, sbottom and stop tend to decay to wino instead of bino. As a result, all the sparticle productions at LHC end up in tau-rich final status, which is not commonly used in simplified-models for LHC SUSY searches.\nHowever, with detailed simulations using MG5@NLO [75] and PYTHIA [76, 77], we find that some surviving samples are further excluded by CheckMATE. A robust constraint is from search for dark matter produced in association with bottom or top quarks using 36.1 fb\u22121 data at 13 TeV LHC [78]. It can exclude stop and sbottom up to 900 GeV, regardless of the structure in Eq. 10. Finally, only the green dots in Fig. 1 can survive. Note that the stop can not be further heavy because the contributions purely from eletroweak sector to MSUSYW can not reach 2\u03c3 regions of the CDF II measurements, as studied in [41]. Roughly speaking, with mt\u03031 > 950 GeV, the winodominated chargino has to be lighter than about 350 GeV, and the structure in Eq. 10 no longer exists. Thus, the mass splitting between \u03c7\u0303\u00b11 and \u03c7\u0303 0 1 has to be smaller than about 30 GeV to avoid multilepton searches at the LHC.\nmt tan \u03b2 \u00b5 M1 M2 M3 MA ME\u03031,2,3 ML\u03031,2,3 P1 173.642 19.7 800.6 201.1 222.0 2204.0 1743.5 601.7 210.2 P2 173.635 22.7 684.9 243.6 274.9 2105.5 2894.4 531.5 210.2\nMQ\u03031,2 MQ\u03033 MU\u03033 MD\u03033 AL1,2,3 AQ1,2 Ab At\nP1 4023.7 963.6 2652.5 4015.1 3408.8 3705.7 3158.7 5513.3 P2 4414.0 951.8 2633.0 3991.4 2573.9 2626.5 3174.8 5277.5\nMW sin2 \u03b8\u0302(MZ ) \u2206a\u00b5 B\u2192 Xs\u03b3 B0s \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 B+ \u2192 \u03c4+\u03bd\u03c4 P1 80.4064 0.2312355 2.15\u00d710\u22129 3.580\u00d710\u22124 2.853\u00d710\u22129 7.648 \u00d7 10\u22125 P2 80.3981 0.2312846 2.22\u00d710\u22129 3.501\u00d710\u22124 2.942\u00d710\u22129 7.672\u00d710\u22125\nmh1 mh2 mH\u00b1 m\u03c7\u030301 m \u03c7\u030302 m \u03c7\u030303 m \u03c7\u030304 m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 m\u03c7\u0303\u00b12 mg\u0303\nP1 119.7 1743.0 1745.9 200.0 218.9 804.2 808.4 218.7 809.5 2204.0 P2 122.3 2894.0 2895.9 242.0 269.8 688.9 695.6 269.5 696.4 2105.5\nIn Tab III, we list two benchmark points that satisfy relevant constraints including LHC direct searches at 2\u03c3 CL. Point P1 is consistent with the new MW measurements in 2\u03c3\n80.47\nCL, but has small SM-like Higgs mass. Considering conservative requirement on SM-like Higgs mass, we give a second benchmark point P2, which has mh = 122.3 GeV but MSUSYW lower than 2\u03c3 bound of the new MW measurements. From the view of LHC SUSY searches, the two point have similar mass spectrums. Thus, the R-value, ratio of 95% lower limit on the number of LHC signal events to corresponding experimentally measured 95% CL limit, obtained from CheckMATE is 0.84 for point P1 and 0.85 for point P2. The dominated contributions are pp \u2192 t\u03031 t\u03031 and pp \u2192 b\u03031b\u03031 processes, with similar final status. Therefore, they are on the edge of exclusion. With a more substantial scan, the R-value could be slightly reduced, but there is no doubt that the region around this benchmark point will be fully covered with higher luminosity at LHC.\nFrom the benchmark points, we see that our surving samples are also on the edge of 2\u03c3 limits from the LHC SM Higgs measurements and the CDF II MW measurements. Requiring mt\u0303 > 1 TeV, it is hard to push MSUSYW over 80.4 GeV, which is consistent with a precious study [47], and to obtain a correct SM-like Higgs mass in the MSSM. In Fig. 2, we display the\nm \u03c7\u0303 \u00b1 1 = m \u03c4\u0303 1\ntension between MSUSYW and mh1 . We define a criteria\nCriteria A : mt\u03031 > 0.95 TeV, mb\u03031 > 1 TeV,\nmg\u0303 > 1.5 TeV, mq\u0303 > 2 TeV, m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 \u2212 m\u03c7\u030301 < 30 GeV\naccording to results of CheckMATE. The samples satisfying this criteria are safe from the LHC direct searches. We can see from Fig. 2 that the LHC direct searches, the SM-like Higgs measurement and the CDF II MW measurement can be simultaneously satisfied at 2\u03c3 CL, but near the edge of 2\u03c3 range, with loose theoretical uncertainties. Besides, heavy stop in the MSSM may also cause vacuum stability problem, which could be avoid in extensions of the Higgs sector, such as the NMSSM.\nFor the surviving samples with MSUSYW > 80.406 GeV, the stop and sbottom contributions described in Eq. 7 dominate the SUSY correction to MSUSYW , while the contributions of stau constitutes about 10% of that. Nevertheless, a light stau is still needed, because its small contribution helps to push a sample into the 2\u03c3 range of MW . In addition, the universal slepton mass is required to be light to achieve agreement with the FNAL measurement of muon g \u2212 2. These features can be seen in Fig. 3.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 3, we plot the surviving samples in the plane of MSUSYW versus \u2206a\u00b5. The horizontal and vertical solid, dashed and dot-dashed lines indicate the current central value, 1\u03c3 limits and 2\u03c3 limits of the corresponding ob-\nservable. The samples satisfying Criteria A, i.e. the LHC SUSY search limits, are colored by green. We can see that the few surviving samples in the 2\u03c3 region of the new CDF II MW measurement can also agree very well with the FNAL muon g\u2212 2 measurement, due to the fact that they both favour light sleptons. Actually, the correlations between MSUSYW and other observables listed in Tab. I are rather weak, except for sin2 \u03b8\u0302(MZ) in which SUSY corrections are also proportion to \u2206\u03c1. We also check that requiring lightest neutralino to be the only DM candidate, i.e. applying also lower bound on DM relic density, the results will barely change.\nThe right panel of Fig. 3 shows the relation between the SUSY prediction of W-boson mass and the stau mass. Note that the point density in the plots does not have statistical meaning, because we have several scans focusing on special regions. For instance, the compressed region of (m\u03c4\u03031 ,m\u03c7\u0303\u00b11 ,m\u03c7\u030301 ) is heavily sampled, because it is promising to avoid constraints of LHC direct searches. We can see that before implementing constraints of LHC SUSY direct searches, a large MSUSYW can be achieved with a light stau. However, with requiring Criteria A, the maximal value of MSUSYW increases rather mildly with m\u03c4\u03031 decreasing. As a result, in the 2\u03c3 region of MW , we see that m\u03c4\u03031 < 260 GeV.\nIn such a mass region, DM can achieve desired relic abundance through chargino or/and stau co-annihilation mechanisms. Therefore, the lightest stau \u03c4\u03031 or/and chargino \u03c7\u0303\u00b11 have small mass splitting to the DM, where \u03c7\u0303\u00b11 is always winodominated in our results, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 4.\nThe final surviving samples, colored by green, have degenerated \u03c4\u03031, \u03c7\u0303\u00b11 and \u03c7\u0303 0 1. In the right panel of Fig. 4, we show the scaled spin-independent neutralino-proton cross-section of samples further satisfying the CDF II measurements at 2\u03c3 CL. We can see that the surviving samples can be fully covered by the projected LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment [79]. Even without the LHC SUSY constraints, the LZ experiment could exclude most of the samples, except for several samples that give tiny DM relic density via extremely degenerating mass spectrum."

The new CDF II measurement of W-boson mass, which showed a 7\u03c3 deviation from the SM prediction, and the FNAL measurement of the muon g \u2212 2, which showed a 4.2\u03c3 deviation (combined with the BNL result) from the SM, strongly indicate new physics. In this work we scrutinized the implication of both measurements on low energy supersymmetry. We explored the parameter space of the MSSM considering various experimen-\ntal constraints from colliders and DM detections. We found that in the allowed parameter space, the MSSM contributions can simultaneously satisfy both measurements at 2\u03c3 level, but quite near the edge. With a more comprehensive scan or a global fit, it is possible to improve agreement with the measurements. The favored parameter space, characterized by a compressed spectrum between bino, wino and stau, with the stop being around 1 TeV, may be covered in the near future LHC searches."
