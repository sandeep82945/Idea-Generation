Research on attention in sport using eye-tracking methodology has highlighted that the highest levels of expertise and performance are characterized by a specific gaze behavior consisting of a perception–action variable named quiet eye. The present study aimed to understand the role of quiet eye during the three-point shot, especially in game conditions in which even a single point may determine victory or defeat. Twenty-one basketball players (twelve competitive elites and nine semi-elites) with a high-shooting style performed three-point shots in four game scenarios different from each other for the time available (time pressure) and the relevance of the score (performance pressure). The results showed that competitive elites performed a longer quiet eye online duration and a shorter QE preprogramming duration than semi-elites, especially in the highest-pressure condition. On the one hand, these results suggest that quiet eye during three-point shots could fulfill an online control function. On the other hand, the findings stressed the importance of implementing experimental conditions that can resemble as closely as possible actual sport situations. Finally, we suggest that sport professionals interested in administering to athletes a quiet eye training protocol in order to improve three-point shot performance consider the shooting style of the players. 1. conclusions We aimed to deepen the knowledge on QE fixation in the basketball three-point shot through the current work. We conducted a mixed factorial design research, focusing on the role of expertise and its effect on QE characteristics during high-pressure conditions. The results confirmed previous evidence about QE behavior during jump shots performed with a high shooting style, extending the results of such literature to three-point shots. Moreover,
the results are in line with the ACT, confirming the superiority of the attentional control of the highest expertise levels. A core finding of the present work is that the online function of QE seems to have a relevant role in the conditions that resemble those of an actual sport situation.
