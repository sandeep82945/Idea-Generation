    "abstractText": "Background: Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for alcohol misuse has potential to radically improve access to evidence-based care, and there is a need to investigate ways to optimize its delivery in clinical settings. Guidance from a clinician has previously been shown to improve drinking outcomes in ICBT, and some studies suggest that pre-treatment assessments may contribute in initiating early change. The objective of this study was to investigate the added and combined effects of a pre-treatment assessment interview and guidance on the outcomes of ICBT for alcohol misuse delivered in an online therapy clinic. Methods: A 2X2 factorial randomized controlled trial was conducted where participants received access to an 8-week ICBT program, and either a pre-treatment assessment interview (Factor 1), guidance (Factor 2), a combination of these, or neither of these. Participants were 270 individuals (66.8% female, mean age = 46.5) scoring 8 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and consuming 14 standard drinks or more in the preceding week. Primary outcomes were number of drinks consumed and number of heavy drinking days during the preceding week, 3 months post-treatment. Results: Large within-group effects were found in terms of alcohol reductions (dw \u2265 0.82, p < 0.001), but neither of the factors significantly improved drinking outcomes. Guidance was associated with greater adherence (i.e. completed modules). Conclusions: Neither a pre-treatment assessment interview nor guidance from a clinician appears to improve drinking outcomes resulting from internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for alcohol misuse when delivered in a routine online therapy clinic.

Internet interventions could radically increase access to\n*Correspondence: christopher.sundstrom@ki.se\n1 Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Centre for Psychiatric Research, Norra Stationsgatan 69, 113 64 Stockholm, Sweden Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nevidence-based treatment for the alcohol misuse population, and with a recent individual patient-data meta-analysis (IPDMA) demonstrating that they render significant alcohol reductions [4], the question no longer appears to be whether these interventions are effective, but rather how their effects can be optimized when implemented in routine online therapy clinics [5] and other clinical settings.\nThe most common way of optimizing effects in internet interventions is through adding guidance from a clinician [6]. In the previously mentioned IPDMA, guided interventions were found superior to unguided ones (comparative reduction: \u2212\u00a0 6.78 drinks) [4]. However, there are several reasons that more research on guidance is needed: first, the IPDMA did not distinguish between the two main intervention formats: internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and personalized normative feedback (PNF). In fact, only three studies in the IPDMA compared guided to unguided ICBT; two found small and medium differential effects in favor of guidance [7, 8], and one did not find differential effects [9]. Second, several recent trials have failed to find differential effects between guided and unguided ICBT [10\u201312], indicating that effects of guidance may not be as robust as suggested by the IPDMA. Further, none of the above mentioned studies were conducted in routine care clinics, suggesting a need to investigate the effects of guidance when ICBT is delivered in clinical settings.\nExposure to structured assessments represents another factor that may improve drinking outcomes in alcohol treatment, a phenomenon referred to as assessment reactivity (AR) [13\u201315]. Although the exact mechanisms of AR are unknown, it has been hypothesized that being asked to reflect on one\u2019s own drinking may lead to recognition of a discrepancy between current behaviour and personal values, which, in turn initiates change [16]. AR has been observed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up assessments [17], and research suggests that semi-structured pre-treatment assessment interviews render immediate reductions in drinking. For example, in one study, where females with alcohol problems received three assessment interviews prior to being randomized to receive either individual or couples CBT, 44% of participants became abstinent prior to treatment start, and these participants also had significantly better drinking outcomes both during treatment and at 12-month follow-up [18]. In a trial of adolescents with substance use problems where all participants underwent an intake assessment interview before treatment start, 51% had become abstinent by the first session, with further analyses showing that those abstinent by the first session had significantly better drinking outcomes at the last session of the treatment than those not abstinent [19]. In a third\nstudy, significant reductions were observed in a non-help seeking control group after participating in an extensive intake interview [20]. Although none of these studies employed an experimental design, the findings appear consistent with an AR effect. Furthermore, the initial alcohol reductions observed were related to longer-term reductions in two of the studies [18, 19], suggesting that pre-treatment assessment interviews have potential as a treatment component that could help optimize treatment effects of internet interventions. However, there are no studies investigating the impact of pre-treatment assessment interviews in ICBT for people with alcohol misuse.\nThe aim of the current factorial randomized controlled trial was to examine optimal delivery of ICBT for alcohol misuse in a routine online therapy clinic through the application of two specific factors: an assessment interview guided by the alcohol use disorder module of the Structured Clinical Interview DSM-5 (SCID-5) (Factor 1) and guidance from a clinician (Factor 2).\nWe hypothesized that at the 3-month follow-up:\na) participants receiving the assessment interview would have reduced their drinking more than those not receiving the assessment interview; b) participants receiving guidance would have reduced their drinking more than those not receiving such guidance; and c) participants receiving a combination of the two factors (assessment interview and guidance), would have reduced their drinking more than any of the other three treatment conditions.\nSecondarily, we evaluated immediate effects of the assessment interview on drinking and motivation to change, hypothesizing that, at pre-treatment:\na) participants receiving the assessment interview would have reduced their drinking more than those not receiving the assessment interview; and b) participants receiving the assessment interview would have increased their motivation to change their drinking more than those not receiving the assessment interview.\nWe further hypothesized that reductions at pre-treatment would be significantly associated with drinking at the 3-month follow-up."

The purpose of the assessment interview was to increase participants\u2019 insight into their own alcohol habits and their consequences through a supportive conversation guided by the AUD module of the Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 \u2013 Research Version (SCID-5 RV) [29]. In total, three screeners were involved in the screening. The screeners ranged in background training and included Bachelor\u2019s degrees in social work (n = 2) and a Master\u2019s degree in counselling psychology (n = 1). Screeners received a SCID-5 training session as well as training and supervision provided by authors CS and MN. Since the goal of the interview was not to establish a diagnosis, participants were not informed about how many criteria they screened positive for. Screening calls with the assessment interview were 36.0\u00a0 min\n(SD = 11.2), while screening calls without the assessment interview were 18.4\u00a0 min (SD = 6.4), (t = \u2212\u00a0 14.771, p = < 0.001, Cohen\u00b4s d = 1.87, CI: 1.572\u20132.169).\nFactor 2: guidance Two clinicians provided guidance. Clinicians held graduate degrees in counselling psychology (MEd) and social work (MSW) and had been practicing for 1 and 13\u00a0years, respectively, at the time of study onset. They were blinded to whether participants had been randomized to the assessment interview or not and were instructed to spend approximately 15\u00a0 min per week communicating with each participant, primarily through messages on the treatment platform. In these messages, clinicians were to answer participants\u2019 questions, reinforce module completion, and boost motivation. In rare cases, clinicians contacted participants by telephone (i.e., if a participant requested a call, if there was increased suicide risk, or to address misunderstanding).\nAcross all four conditions, participants received automated, weekly emails with information about new lesson content. Those randomized to a group without guidance did not receive any other regular contact, but a member of the research team reviewed weekly survey responses to check for significant clinical issues requiring attention (i.e., major increase in drinking, sudden increase in depression symptoms or suicidal ideation). If any participant was deemed at risk, they were contacted and offered referral to appropriate health care. However, they were only discontinued from the trial if they requested it. All participants could contact the OTU if they experienced technical difficulties related to the treatment platform or wanted to discontinue the intervention."

Participants who did not complete questionnaires were contacted via telephone and/or email as a reminder to complete measures, with a maximum of three reminders per follow-up period. The primary outcomes were number of drinks and number of heavy drinking days (HDD; defined as \u2265 4 drinks per day for women and \u2265 5 drinks per day for men) in the preceding week. Secondary measures were the AUDIT [22], the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) [31], and the Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire (BSCQ) [32]. Additional measures included daily functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale; SDS) [33], depression (the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) [23], and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7) [34]. Initial motivation, as well as motivational changes between screening and treatment start were assessed using the Readiness to Change Questionnaire \u2013Treatment Version (RCQ-TV) [35]. Finally, treatment credibility was assessed at midtreatment using the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire [36]. Questions pertaining to treatment evaluation and negative effects were assessed at post-treatment and have previously been reported for the overall sample [37].

Regarding factor 2 (guidance), we estimated the effect size as 0.35, based on previously published studies [7, 8].

Missing responses were strongly associated with fewer lessons completed (p < 0.001) and with the self-guided course (p = 0.002). To attempt to control for possible bias from differential response rates we used a multiple imputation procedure to replace\nmissing outcome measures. Fifty imputed datasets were created with the MICE package in R [39]. The imputation models controlled for lesson completion, treatment factors, observed values of that measure at other observation times, and interactions between lesson completion, treatment, and observed values.\nTo evaluate changes in primary and secondary measures, we modeled responses using generalized estimating equations (GEE) [40] using the geepack package, version 1.3.2. in R. The GEE models used Gamma distributions to accommodate skewed response distributions and a log-link function to model changes as proportional to pre-treatment severity. We specified an exchangeable working correlation matrix within individuals to address within-subject correlations, estimated standard errors with robust \u201csandwich\u201d estimates, and tested whether interactions between Time and Factor were significant using the multivariate Wald test pooling results from the multiply imputed datasets. To evaluate whether the assessment interview had an effect on RCQ-TV change between screening and pre-treatment we planned to use a multinomial logit model. However, as virtually all participants were in the same \u201creadiness to change\u201d stage at screening (i.e., contemplation stage) and at pretreatment (i.e., action stage) respectively, we did not conduct this analysis. To evaluate changes in drinking between screening and pre-treatment, two-way ANOVA\u2019s were used, and to evaluate program engagement, credibility, satisfaction and negative effects by group, one-way ANOVA\u2019s were used. SPSS 25 was used for descriptive statistics and to analyze changes between screening and pre-treatment, while R version 4.1.0. was used for all outcome analyses."

Large within-group reductions were observed in all groups, but no main effects were observed for the two factors and neither did we observe an interaction effect. Similarly, moderate to large within-group effect sizes were found for secondary outcomes but no effects related to the two factors. As for initial change (between screening and pre-treatment), significant within-group reductions in both groups were observed, and nearly all participants moved from the contemplation stage to the action stage, regardless of whether they had received the assessment interview or not. Initial reductions in drinks\nand heavy drinking days correlated significantly with reductions at post-treatment and follow-up.\nThis is the first time that the effects of a pre-treatment assessment interview has been experimentally investigated in ICBT for alcohol misuse, and it did not improve outcomes in our study. Guidance did not improve outcomes either, which adds to recent studies failing to find differential effects [9\u201312]. One explanation for the lack of effects may be that the Online Therapy Unit, the clinic where the trial was conducted, by default provides some degree of human contact to all participants regardless of group assignment, something which could potentially increase engagement for everyone [41]. Specifically, the assessment interview was provided as an extension of a screening call that all participants received and may not have been sufficient to produce any additional effects over and above the screening call. Further, in line with routine procedures at the clinic, all participants were called by staff whenever concern about a major increase in alcohol consumption or suicidal ideation was noted in the weekly questionnaires. A relatively large proportion of those randomized to a group without guidance were contacted by staff, possibly contributing to a dilution of the effect of the guidance factor. As has been suggested in research on ICBT for depression and anxiety, it may be that optimal outcomes are achieved when high quality treatment material is combined with clinical interviews and clinical monitoring during treatment [42]."

We had missing data for 27% of participants on at least one primary or secondary measure at post-treatment and for 37% of participants at 3-month follow-up. Importantly, we also had differential attrition such that those receiving guidance were significantly more likely to complete both posttreatment and 3-month follow-ups. Although a multiple imputation analysis was conducted to account for potential bias in the data that was collected, it is possible that participants who did not complete the follow-ups differed in other important ways from those who did complete the follow-ups. Although no trends were apparent in the data, it is possible that with a larger sample size, small effects between factors may have been detected. Further, much of the data was collected after the COVID19 pandemic began in early 2020, something which may have impacted the results. According to Canadian statistics, the pandemic has been associated with increased alcohol use among the one-third of Canadian residents with a history of alcohol use [43] with residents reporting that factors such as stress, boredom and reduced mental health contributed to increased use [44].\nEven though the assessment interview did not increase alcohol reductions or initial motivation, the finding that initial reductions (i.e. between screening and pretreatment) correlated with reductions at follow-ups suggests that initial reductions (or lack thereof ) can predict long-term change among clients using these kinds of interventions. Other ways to optimize effects of internet interventions for alcohol misuse, such as post-treatment boosters [45] should be further investigated. Future research may also examine ways to improve engagement and treatment completion.\nMost participants moved from the contemplation stage in the screening to the action stage at pre-treatment, but motivation may have waned over the course of the treatment. Interventions that target low motivation when it arises in treatment, such as motivational interviewing (MI) may be beneficial [46] and further research could investigate ways to assess motivation during treatment and offer support when motivation wanes. In a meta-analysis on the treatment of comorbid AUD and depression, combined CBT and MI resulted in small but clinically significant benefits compared to treatment as usual [47]. Lastly, including additional resources related to the use of other substances (e.g., cannabis), may be beneficial to investigate, as individuals with AUD often have comorbid concerns [48]."
