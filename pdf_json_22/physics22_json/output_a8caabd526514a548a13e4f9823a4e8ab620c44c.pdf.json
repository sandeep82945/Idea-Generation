    "abstractText": "The explosion of space weather research since the early 1990s has been partly fueled by the unprecedented, uniform, and extended observations of solar disturbances from spaceand ground-based instruments. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from closed magnetic field regions and high-speed streams (HSS) from open-field regions on the Sun account for most of the disturbances relevant to space weather. The main consequences of CMEs and HSS are their ability to cause geomagnetic storms and accelerate particles. Particles accelerated by CME-driven shocks can pose danger to humans and their technological structures in space. Geomagnetic storms produced by CMEs and HSS-related stream interaction regions also result in particle energization inside the magnetosphere that can have severe impact on satellites operating in the magnetosphere. Solar flares are another aspect of solar magnetic energy release, mostly characterized by the sudden enhancement in electromagnetic emission at various wavelengths\u2014from radio waves to gamma-rays. Flares are responsible for the sudden ionospheric disturbances and prompt perturbation of Earth\u2019s magnetic field known as magnetic crochet. Nonthermal electrons accelerated during flares can emit intense microwave radiation that can drown spacecraft and radar signals. This review article summarizes major milestones in understanding the connection between solar variability and space weather.",

            "text": "The Sun is an ordinary star from an astronomical point of view, but it is the vital source of energy that supports life on Earth. Due to its proximity to Earth, we can observe and understand Sun\u2019s variability on various timescales, from sub-second to centuries. Most of the variability is caused by solar magnetism, thought to operate in the outer shell of the Sun. Observationally, the variability manifests as the appearance and dispersal of bipolar magnetic regions (e.g., sunspot regions) and unipolar regions (coronal hole regions). The solar dynamo is sustained by the exchange between toroidal flux, represented by sunspots, and the poloidal flux, represented by polar field strength. Solar eruptions are part of the life cycle of active regions (ARs), in that photospheric motions store energy in AR magnetic fields, and the stored energy is explosively released. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares are two manifestations of the energy release from closed magnetic regions. Coronal holes contain field lines open to the space, and the solar plasma can readily escape into space as high-speed streams (HSS). Thus, the two types of magnetic topology on the Sun result in two types of mass emission: CMEs and HSS. As CMEs and HSS propagate into the corona and interplanetary (IP) space, they interact with the ambient solar wind forming shock sheaths ahead of CMEs and stream interaction regions (SIRs) at the leading edge of HSS. A solar flare represents a transient increase in electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths from radio to gamma rays originating from localized closed magnetic field regions on the Sun. The flare emissions are caused by nonthermal electrons (radio bursts and hard X-ray bursts) and protons (impulsive gamma rays) energized in the magnetic reconnection region in the active region corona. The accelerated particles precipitating to the chromosphere cause chromospheric evaporation, and the heated flare plasma emits in\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781. https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13111781 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/atmosphere\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781 2 of 34\nsoft X-rays. Magnetic reconnection results simultaneously in a post-eruption arcade (PEA) and a magnetic flux rope (FR). Thermal emission from the PEA in soft X-rays is used as an indicator of flare strength. The FR is accelerated outwards as long as the reconnection proceeds, followed by interaction with the ambient solar wind. If a FR is fast enough, it drives a fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock that can accelerate particles to GeV energies. Such particles are known as solar energetic particles (SEPs). Flares may also contribute to SEPs. SIRs also accelerate particles to lower energies, typically beyond 1 au. All these phenomena\u2014flare electromagnetic emission, CMEs, SEPs, CIRs, and HSS\u2014 can contribute to adverse space weather in the heliosphere. Space weather effects can be felt in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, ionosphere, atmosphere, and surface when Earth is in the path of these disturbances. Therefore, forecasting the properties of these disturbances and their arrival time at Earth is important for space weather prediction. There has been significant progress in understanding how solar eruptions result in various space weather consequences over the past two decades, as reviewed recently [1\u20137]. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the observational results on solar disturbances and highlight some key results relevant to space weather. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an update on the basic properties of CMEs. Section 3 highlights the shock-driving capability of CMEs. Section 4 focuses on the CME origin of SEP events. Section 5 summarizes the CME link to geomagnetic storms via the southward magnetic field component and the speed of CMEs. Section 6 highlights those CME properties that seem to be essential for the acceleration of SEPs. Section 7 discusses the spacecraft anomalies that follow SEP events and geomagnetic storms. Section 8 summarizes the solar cycle (SC) variation of the CME rate and how it affects space weather events. Section 9 describes the extreme events of SC 23. Concluding remarks are given in Section 10."

Although white-light coronagraphs are the most commonly used instruments to detect CMEs, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers have become key instruments in observing CMEs closer to the solar surface. The combination of inner coronal images in EUV or other wavelengths, and white-light images, provide the full picture of CMEs early in their life. A CME typically starts with a slightly larger initial size than the solar source, grows in size as it expands, and becomes a large-scale coherent structure in the coronagraphic field of view. A typical CME has a number of substructures with different densities, temperatures, and magnetic field strengths [8]. CMEs often show a three-part structure consisting of a bright front followed by a dark void and a bright core [9,10]. The bright front is the compressed coronal material caused by the outward motion of the dark void interpreted as a magnetic flux rope, while the bright core in the CME interior is the eruptive prominence. The threepart structure is somewhat of an incomplete description when it comes to shock-driving CMEs: a shock forms ahead of the bright front with a compressed sheath behind the shock. Although the shock is too thin to be discerned from white-light observations, the sheath is identified as a diffuse feature surrounding the bright front [11\u201316]. The CME in Figure 1 has all the substructures: shock sheath, bright front, void, and core observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. The bright front in Figure 1b is thought to indicate the outline of a magnetic flux rope identified with the void region. The presence of a shock can be inferred from the kink (marked S in Figure 1b) in the nearby streamer. The shock sheath can be seen better in the difference (event minus pre-event) image in Figure 1c as a diffuse structure surrounding the CME flux rope [17]. The outer edge of the sheath is taken as the shock, because the shock is too thin compared to the spatial resolution of the coronagraph images. Different substructures have different space weather consequences. When the sheath and/or the flux rope contains a south-pointing, out-of-the-ecliptic magnetic field component, a geomagnetic storm ensues upon arrival at\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781 3 of 34\nthe magnetosphere. The bright prominence core has high density, and so it can enhance a geomagnetic storm if the density enhancement occurs during an interval in which the CME flux rope has a southward component (see, e.g., [18\u201320]). On the other hand, the outermost structure, viz., the CME-driven shock, is responsible for accelerating particles to high energies (e.g., [21,22]).\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 39\nspatial resolution of the coronagraph images.

The typical speed and width are ~400 km/s and ~40\u25e6, respectively. The speed is lognormally distributed, which has been attributed to the complexities of the elementary reconnection processes during an eruption [42]. The CME widths > 120\u25e6 are mainly due to projection effects. The last width bin corresponds to full halo CMEs, which constitute only ~2.5% of all CMEs. For a given coronagraph, halo CMEs represent an energetic population with the inherent width and speed larger than the average values shown in Figure 2 [43]. The accelerations have a large scatter, but there is a clear tendency for faster CMEs to decelerate on average. On the other hand, very slow CMEs (speed < 480 km/s) have a positive acceleration. However, there are many fast CMEs that do have positive acceleration within the LASCO FOV. All CMEs have to accelerate from zero speed, so the initial acceleration is always positive.

[55] found that the CME width W and speed V are reasonably correlated: W = 0.11 V + 24.3 (W in degrees and V in km/s). Wider CMEs are also more massive [56,57]: log M = 12.6 + 1.3 log W (M in g and W in degrees). Thus, fast and wide CMEs are more energetic. This is an important characteristic, because energetic CMEs are able to travel far into the IP medium and contribute to severe space weather. The mass loss from the Sun due to CMEs amounts to ~10% of the mass loss due to the solar wind [58,59]. In a recent investigation, Michalek et al. [57] reported that wider CMEs contribute significantly to the Sun\u2019s mass loss: halo and partial halo CMEs contribute ~20% each, while CMEs with widths in the range 50\u2013120\u25e6 contribute ~60%."

Type II bursts also point to the small fraction of fast and wide CMEs relevant for space weather [75]. By tracking the type II bursts to tens of kHz, it is possible to predict their arrival time at Earth [76]. Some high-frequency bursts have been found to have direct effect on global positioning system receivers [77]. On 6 December 2006, a radio burst occurred with an unprecedented intensity of >106 solar flux units (sfu). The radio burst most severely affected the civilian dual frequency GPS receivers in the Sun-lit hemisphere. Typically, signals from four members of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) are needed to be in view for a receiver to compute positioning. During the microwave burst, the number of satellites that could be tracked fell below four, and hence the positioning accuracy degraded significantly or was not even possible using the system for tens of minutes. A similar intense microwave burst occurred in SC 24 on 2015 November 4, with an intensity of ~105 sfu. During this event, signals from secondary air traffic control radars in Sweden, Norway, and Belgium became severely disturbed when the antennas were pointed in the direction of the Sun. Examination of the radio dynamic spectra reveals that solar radio flux dramatically increased near the L band at which the GNSS and radar signals are employed. There is also a lot of variability in the intensity of neighboring frequencies. Cliver et al. [78] have concluded that such high-intensity bursts belong to the \u201cdragon king\u201d type of events, in that the radio emission mechanism is different from that of regular events. The dragon king events are due to a coherent radio emission mechanism such as electron cyclotron maser, as opposed to gyro-synchrotron emission for regular bursts. X-ray photons during solar flares increase the ionization in the D and E layers of the ionosphere, thereby changing the conductivity. One of the consequences is the impact on the very low frequency (VLF) waves that bounce off from the bottom of the ionosphere. The amplitude and phase of the VLF waves are altered by the flare-induced changes in the ionospheric conductivity. By monitoring the VLF waves, one can detect solar flares of B5-class and above and the associated ionospheric disturbances [79]. Intense solar flares also cause the so-called magnetic crochet, which is a minor disturbance of Earth\u2019s\nFigure 10. solar eruptive event and the associated S /L SC E (a), ES soft X-ray flare of size M8.6 (b), and the radio bursts from the Radio and Plasma Waves experiment (WAVES) on board the Wind spacecraft (c).

            "text": "It was recognized a long time ago that geomagnetic disturbances are intimately related to the southward IP magnetic field [82,83]. When the southward magnetic field component of an IP structure such as an ICME reconnects with the Earth\u2019s field in the magnetosphere, a geomagnetic storm ensues. Following the dayside reconnection, a nightside reconnection occurs and particles are injected into the magnetosphere, enhancing the ring current, which affects Earth\u2019s magnetic field at ground level [82]. The storm strength is measured by an index such as Dst, which is an average deviation of Earth\u2019s horizontal magnetic field measured at four low-latitude magnetometer stations [84] (https://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ dstdir/dst2/onDstindex.html, accessed on 1 October 2022). While the southward magnetic field is necessary for a storm, the storm strength is determined by additional solar wind parameters such as the speed and dynamic pressure [85\u201391]. An IP structure that causes a geomagnetic storm is said to be geoeffective. In the undisturbed solar wind, the IP magnetic field is in the ecliptic plane and hence does not have an out-of-the-ecliptic component (Bz), except for Alfven waves. The CME connection to geomagnetic storms comes from the fact that the IP manifestation of CMEs such as magnetic clouds [92,93] possess significant Bz, which causes a geomagnetic storm when negative (southward) [94\u201396]. Sheath regions behind ICMEs often contain Bz < 0 and cause geomagnetic storms [97,98]. Coronal holes are regions of the corona where the density is low and the photospheric magnetic field underlying them is predominantly unipolar, indicating open magnetic flux (see [99] for a review). Plasma is free to escape along the open-field lines, observed as an HSS. The speed of HSS observed at 1 au has been found to depend on the coronal hole area, expansion factor of the magnetic field, and the photospheric magnetic field strength [100\u2013105]. Coronal holes are generally of limited spatial extent, so an HSS typically presses against a preceding slower wind, forming a SIR. When a SIR is observed for more than one solar rotation, it is called a corotating interaction region (CIR). A CIR/SIR is identified based on the increase in density, temperature, and magnetic field strength during the positive gradient of the solar wind speed [106\u2013110]. The occurrence rate of SIRs is solar-cycle dependent, with a majority of them occurring during the declining phase of a solar cycle (see e.g., [111] and references therein). The solar cycle variation of CIRs reflect the occurrence pattern of coronal holes on the Sun at low and high latitudes [103,112]. SIRs possess enhanced density, dynamic pressure, temperature, magnetic field strength, and speed compared to the preceding solar wind. Many of these are important in causing geomagnetic storms [113]. Table 1 compares the SIR parameters with the corresponding ones in the solar wind (from [114]).\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781 13 of 34"

One can think of the following geoeffectiveness scenarios depending on the location of Bz < 0 interval within the overall structure of ICMEs: (1) both sheath and cloud are geoeffective, (2) sheath alone is geoeffective, and (3) cloud alone is geoeffective, and (4) neither sheath nor cloud is geoeffective. When both the sheath and cloud portions are geoeffective, the Dst (disturbance storm time) profile can be complex, leading to multistep storms [116,117]. Figure 11 shows a shock-driving CME and a schematic of its IP manifestation. The flux rope is a bundle of helical field lines that are rooted on either side of the neutral line in the source region on the Sun. In the cross-sectional plane, the field lines appear circular, with the front and back field lines pointing in opposite directions. In reality, the cross-section can be elliptical or heavily deformed due to interaction with the ambient solar wind. If the MC arrives at Earth in the flux rope configuration shown Figure 11, it will be termed as south\u2013 north (SN) MC. If the rotation is reversed, it represents a north\u2013south (NS) MC, indicating that the leading edge now has a north-pointing magnetic field component. The NS and SN MCs are known as bipolar, as opposed to the unipolar MCs in which the axial field is in the north\u2013south direction, while the field rotates in the east\u2013west direction. Unipolar MCs are called fully-north (FN) or fully-south (FS) to indicate that the axial field points to the north or south, respectively. More details can be found in [118\u2013124]. The onset of a geomagnetic storm can be delayed with respect to the arrival time of the MC, depending on the MC type and the presence of a sheath [115]. The SN, FS, and NS type MCs have average delays of about 6, 9, and 19 h, respectively, from the cloud arrival to the Dst minimum time. The SN and NS type MCs have a similar storm strength (Dst ~ \u2212107 and \u2212104 nT, respectively), and the FS MCs result in stronger storms (average ~ \u2212125 nT). Sheath storms attain their peak strengths about 3\u20134 h before the MC arrival because the shock arrives earlier.

The blue concentric circles represent the cross-section of the MC flux rope, with the arrows indicating direction of field lines in a direction perpendicular to the flux rope axis (right). The downward (upward) arrows denote field direction pointing southward (northward) in the IP medium. When the field points southward, a geomagnetic storm ensues. When the flux rope axis is in the ecliptic plane, the azimuthal field becomes the Bz component. When the axis is highly inclined with respect to the ecliptic, the axial field becomes Bz. When shock-driving (see Figure 1), the sheath ahead of the flux rope contains Bz. CIRs can also be a source of Bz because they amplify the solar wind Alfven waves in the compression region.\nExamples of a double-dip storm and a sheath storm are shown in Figure 12. The underlying CMEs occurred on 28 and 29 October 2003 at the Sun [126]. The two CMEs are fast halo CMEs (speed > 2000 km/s) that ended up as dissimilar ICMEs. The first ICME has Bz < 0 in the sheath, followed by a large Bz < 0 in the cloud. In the second MC, the sheath has a large Bz < 0 with mostly Bz > 0 in the cloud. The reason for the different appearance of MCs is that they originate from different neutral lines in the source active region.

Two super-intense magnetic storms from the Halloween 2003 period, one caused by an FS MC, the other caused by a sheath. The underlying CMEs originated from the same active region, one day apart (f om [115]).\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781 15 of 34\nThe speed and magnetic content of ICMEs are ultimately connected to the free energy in the source magnetic region on the Sun. One of the parameters that is readily measured during an eruption is the total reconnected flux, which is highly correlated with the CME speed [128,129], CME kinetic energy, and flare fluence [130]. By combining the reconnected flux and the geometrical parameters of the CME obtained from flux rope fit to white-light images, it has been shown that the axial field strength near the Sun is correlated with the CME speed [130]. Such a relationship was obtained in MCs at 1 au [122,131]. These studies suggest that faster CMEs are likely to cause stronger geomagnetic disturbances when Bz < 0. Figure 13 shows three observational facts about CMEs causing intense (Dst \u2264 \u2212100 nT) geomagnetic storms: (i) The CMEs are two times faster than typical CMEs (955 km/s vs. 416 km/s). (ii) Two thirds of the storm-causing CMEs are halos; the average width of non-halo CMEs is 175\u25e6, much larger than the typical width of CMEs, viz, 38\u25e6. (iii) The heliographic locations of the storm-causing CMEs are concentrated near the solar disk center, especially the ones causing more intense storms. The geoeffectiveness of CMEs decreases as a function of the central meridian distance [132]. (i) and (ii) imply that the CMEs are very energetic (wider CMEs are more massive, and hence the kinetic energy is high\u2014see [55]). (iii) implies that CMEs heading directly toward Earth are more impactful in causing geomagnetic storms. Note that almost all storms with intensities < \u2212200 nT are within \u00b130\u25e6 longitude. This was recognized long time ago by H. W. Newton [133], who found that the locations of the flares associated with great storms are close to the central meridian, with a slight bias to the Western Hemisphere (see also [1] for details). The slight western bias has been demonstrated using CME data by [134]. The western bias is related to the fact that CMEs are deflected slightly eastward due to solar rotation [135]. The source locations are also distributed around N15 and S15 latitudes, which correspond to the active region belt. Active regions possess the highest levels of magnetic energy needed to power these energetic CMEs. Another implication of the source locations close to the disk center is that the CME speeds are underestimated because of projection effects. If we apply the empirical relationship V3D = 1.1 Vsky + 156 ([136]), we see that for Vsky = 955 km/s, the average 3D speed (V3D) of storm-producing CMEs becomes 1207 km/s. Occasionally, CMEs originating close to the limb also cause intense storms. There are five limb halos (CMD \u2265 60\u25e6) in Figure 13c that produced intense storms. These CMEs are geoeffective because they are very energetic and their sheath with significant Bz < 0 component is intercepted by Earth. One of these storms (Dst = \u2212288 nT) is due to the 4 April 2000 west limb CME with a sky-plane speed of 1188 km/s [137\u2013139]. The deprojected speed is ~1450 km/s.\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 39\nThe speed and magnetic content of ICMEs are ultimately connected to the free energy in the source magnetic region on the Sun. One of the parameters that is readily measured during an eruption is the total reconnected flux, which is highly correlated with the CME speed [128,129], CME kinetic energy, and flare fluence [130]. By combining the reconnected flux and the geometrical parameters of the CME obtained from flux rope fit to white-light images, it has been shown that the axial field strength near the Sun is correlated with the CME speed [130]. Such a relationship was obtained in MCs at 1 au [122,131]. These studies suggest that faster CMEs are likely to cause stronger geomagnetic disturbances when Bz < 0. Figure 13 shows three observational facts about CMEs causing intense (Dst \u2264 \u2212100 nT) geomagnetic storms: (i) The CMEs are two times faster than typical CMEs (955 km/s vs. 416 km/s). (ii) Two thirds of the storm-causing CMEs are halos; the average width of non-halo C Es is 175\u00b0, uch larger than the typical idth of C Es, viz, 38\u00b0. (iii) The heliographic locations of the stor -causing C Es are concentrated near the solar disk center, especially the ones causing ore intense stor s.

SEPs were first observed in the early 1940s using ionization chambers at the ground level [147]. The SEP events detected at Earth\u2019s surface are called ground-level enhancement (GLE) events. GLE events are now detected using neutron monitors or muon telescopes that detect secondary neutrons and muons caused by primary SEPs. The events reported by Forbush [147] were associated with intense H-alpha flares on the Sun; thus, flares became known as the accelerator of SEPs. Type II solar radio bursts were first detected in 1947 [148,149] and have been attributed to a fast-mode MHD shock [150]. Type II bursts are caused by nonthermal electrons accelerated at the shock via the plasma emission mechanism [72]. Lin et al. [151] found that energetic proton events occur in major eruptions accompanied by type II and type IV radio bursts, intense X-ray and microwave emission, and relativistic electrons. Rao et al. [152] suggested that energetic storm particle (ESP) events are accelerated by IP shocks when they are at Earth. Kahler et al. [153] attributed the shocks to CMEs, and hence the shock paradigm for SEPs became firmly established [154\u2013156]. The importance of CMEs in the occurrence of SEP events is illustrated in Figure 15. These are CMEs associated with large SEP events, defined as those with proton intensity expressed in particle flux units (pfu = 1 particle cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121) exceeding 10 in the >10 MeV energy channel. Such events have been determined to have important space weather consequences by the NOAA. The CME speeds range from ~600 km/s to >3000 km/s, with an average speed of ~1500 km/s. The speed is clearly much larger than that of an average CME. A vast majority (>80%) of SEP-associated CMEs are halos, indicating that such CMEs are very wide, further confirmed by the average width (~180\u25e6) of the non-halo CMEs. The distribution of CME source locations on the Sun heavily favors the Western Hemisphere because the accelerated particles propagate along magnetic field lines that have a Parker spiral configuration. The nominal connection angle is ~W58 for a background solar wind speed of ~ 400 km/s. While most of the high-intensity events are from the Western Hemisphere, there are some events originating from the Eastern Hemisphere, and even from the east limb. The east-limb events are of low intensity (\u2264100 pfu), but the CME speeds are extraordinarily high. For example, the average CME speed of the seven east-limb SEP events in Table 2 is ~1956 km/s, while the average SEP intensity (Ip) detected by GOES is only 44 pfu. The low intensity is a consequence of the poor connectivity\u2014Earth is connected to the extreme west flank of the CME shock. It must be noted that a spacecraft behind the east limb is well-connected to such east-limb events and hence would observe an intense particle event.

The inner belt is populated mainly by energetic protons resulting from the galactic cosmic rays via the CRAND (cosmic ray albedo neutron decay) mechanism (e.g., [167]. SEPs from energetic CMEs also contribute to the inner belt (see e.g., [168]). The CRAND mechanism can also contribute to energetic electrons in the inner belt [169]. Precipitation of radiation belt particles, SEPs, and GCRs to the Earth\u2019s polar atmosphere affects the atmospheric chemistry, including ozone depletion (see [170] and references therein). SEPs penetrate the polar atmosphere to various depths depending on their energy: 1, 10, 100, and 1000 MeV particles can penetrate to the mesopause, mesosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere, respectively. The 100 MeV particles in the stratosphere can dissociate molecules to produce radicals such as HOx and NOx that react with ozone,\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781 21 of 34\ncontributing to ozone depletion [171]. The GeV particles reach the troposphere, where the primary particles produce air shower, including secondary particles such as muons and neutrons detected by ground-based monitors (see e.g., [172] for a review). GLEs have a harder spectrum than regular SEP events and SEP events associated with filament eruption CMEs [157]. GLEs deposit their energy in Earth\u2019s polar and mid-latitude regions. Because of their higher energy, GLEs also significantly impact solar cells and star-sensor pointing systems on spacecraft. They also increase of the radiation environment on spacecraft components and transpolar aircraft. Solar disturbances have a significant impact on terrestrial technological systems as well [173]. The impact is in the form of a geomagnetically induced current (GIC) caused by rapid variation in ionospheric currents during a shock compression of the magnetosphere (SSC), a substorm, or other fast processes [174\u2013176]. GICs affect any large-scale conducting system at the surface of Earth such as railroads, telephone lines, pipelines, and electric power grids. Hazardous GICs have been found to be mainly associated with CMEs rather than CIRs [163,177]. GICs at high latitudes have been extensively studied (see [178\u2013180] and references therein). GICs can be significant at mid and low latitudes as well [181,182]. SSCs are followed by geomagnetic storms. Sudden impulses represent the arrival of CMEdriven shocks at the magnetosphere but are not followed by geomagnetic storms. Even during sudden impulses, GICs can increase significantly [182]."

            "text": "Solar activity represents the appearance and dispersal of closed and open magnetic field regions on the Sun. While CMEs originate from closed-field regions, high-speed streams originate from open-field regions. Indices such as sunspot number (SSN) and the radio flux at 10.7 cm wavelength (F10.7) are typical measures of solar activity, although there are many other indicators. For example, the magnetic butterfly diagram [183] provides information on the magnetic nature of solar activity and how the low-latitude and highlatitude magnetic regions are related. Since CMEs and CIRs originate from enhanced closedand open-field regions on the Sun, solar activity has clear relevance to space weather events. When the SSN is high (solar maximum phase), there are more closed-field regions on the Sun, and hence the probability is high for the occurrence of CMEs. Similarly, when there are many low-latitude coronal holes in the declining phase of the solar cycles, there are more HSS and the related CIRs and geomagnetic storms."

However, the amplitudes of the two phenomena are different in different solar cycles (Figure 19): the CME rates are similar in SCs 23 and 24, but the SSN is much smaller in SC 24. However, fast and wide (FW) CMEs relevant for space weather are very different between the two cycles and consistent with the reduction in SSN. The number of major flares is also smaller in SC 24. The occurrence of less energetic CMEs in SC 24 is further supported by the smaller average CME speed in that cycle (Figure 19c). The rise phase of SC 25 has witnessed CME and SSN behavior similar to those in SC 24. Figure 20 further examines the relation between the CME rate and SSN using a scatter plot. Considering all CMEs observed by SOHO/LASCO from 1996 to 2021, we see that the CME rate\u2013SSN correlation is high (r = 0.82). There is a large scatter in the SSN range 100\u2013150, which corresponds to the maximum phase. The scatter is drastically reduced when the data points are separated according to the solar cycle they belong to. The correlation improves significantly to r = 0.88 for SC 23 and 0.92 for SC 24. The different slopes of the regression lines are consistent with the higher amplitude in the CME rate, as shown in Figure 19. However, it must be noted that the CME identification was made by several people, so one cannot rule out the effect of subjectivity on the CME rate in cycle 23 (especially of the slow and narrow CMEs).

Several new events have been identified based on sightings of low-latitude overhead auroras: about six 100-year storms and three 1000-year storms have been identified over the past five centuries [78]. Extreme SEP events and geomagnetic storms are exclusively due to energetic CMEs. Figure 25 shows the cumulative distribution of CME speeds with the average speeds of various CME populations. CMEs associated with purely metric type II bursts have a speed of only ~600 km/s, still faster than the general population (~400 km/s). On the other hand, GLE-associated CMEs are the fastest (~2000 km/s). Halo CMEs and CMEs associated with magnetic clouds (MC), non-cloud ejecta (EJ), and IP shocks (S) are similar to those associated with geomagnetic (GM) storms. This is understandable because all these CME populations indicate CMEs directly impacting Earth and causing GM storms. The next two populations are CMEs causing decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts and large SEP events. These events are due to electrons and ions accelerated by CME-driven shocks, similar to GLE events but accelerated to lower energies. This figure shows that a couple of thousand CMEs with speed exceeding ~600 km/s have significant space weather consequences. Figure 25a also shows that the number of CMEs drops rapidly for speeds >2000 km/s. The drop is modeled using Weibull and power law functions, as shown in Figure 25b. The Weibull distribution indicates that 100-year and 1000-year CMEs have a speed of 3800 km/s and 4700 km/s, respectively. The highest-speed data point in Figure 25b is from the 10 November 2004 CME that had a speed of 3387 km s\u22121, close to a 100-year event.

Concluding Remarks We have a fairly good understanding of large space weather events that can be linked to solar eruptions from magnetically closed regions and coronal holes. The electromagnetic component of solar eruptions is the solar flares that have prompt response in the form of magnetic crochet and sudden ionospheric disturbances. It takes only ~8 min for the X-ray photons to reach Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Closely following flares are GLEs that are delayed only by a couple of minutes. CME-driven shocks, on the other hand, take anywhere from half a day to a few days to reach Earth and cause SSC or sudden impulse. Thus, the timescales involved range from minutes to a few days. Accordingly the predictability of flares, SEPs, and CME/shock arrival differ significantly [195]. While predicting flare/CME occurrence based on source region properties is a long way away, there are methods being developed actively using statistics and machine learning (see [196] and references therein]. Predicting SEP events also needs to be probabilistic in nature [197,198]. Methods of predicting SEP occurrence based on neural networks are being actively pursued (see e.g., [199] and references therein). The statistical result that spacecraft anomalies peak a couple of days after the start of an SEP event (see Figure 17) can be used to predict certain impacts after detecting a GLE event, because the GLE and SEP intensities are correlated [200]. Similarly, predicting the shock arrival (SSC) at 1 au [201] has value, because spacecraft anomalies also peak a couple of days after SSC (see Figure 18). We have mainly considered the space weather consequences of solar eruptions and coronal holes. We have not considered CME initiation or the trigger of eruptions [202\u2013 205]. The discussions in this paper are concerned with the mature stage of CMEs after the completion of magnetic reconnection in the eruption region [206]. The mature flux rope that follows after the initial seed flux rope becomes unstable and initiates the flare reconnection [207]. The seed flux rope can be hot [208] or cold (associated with a filament) [209,210]. We have also not discussed another aspect of CMEs and CIRs, viz., the Forbush decrease (see [211\u2013213] and references therein), nor the overall increase in cosmic ray flux due to weak solar activity [214]. The solar and heliospheric community has made enormous progress in understanding solar magnetic variability and its impact on the inner heliosphere, especially on Earth\u2019s space environment. The progress can be attributed to the rapid advances in space missions\nFigure 25.

            "text": "We have a fairly good understanding of large space weather events that can be linked to solar eruptions from magnetically closed regions and coronal holes. The electromagnetic component of solar eruptions is the solar flares that have prompt response in the form of magnetic crochet and sudden ionospheric disturbances. It takes only ~8 min for the X-ray photons to reach Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Closely following flares are GLEs that are delayed only by a couple of minutes. CME-driven shocks, on the other hand, take anywhere from half a day to a few a s to reach Earth and cause SSC or s dden impulse. Thus, the timescales involved ra ge from minutes to a few days. Accordingly the predictability of fl res, SEPs, nd CME/shock arrival differ significantly [195]. While predicting flare/CME occurrence based o sourc region propert es is a long way away, there are methods being developed actively using statistics and machine learning (see [196] and references th r in]. Predicting SE even s also needs to be pr babilistic in nature [197,198]. Methods of predicting SEP occurrence based on ne al etworks are being actively pu sued (see e.g., [199] and references therei ). The stati tical result tha spacecraft anomalies peak a couple of days after the start of an SEP event (see Figur 17) can be used to pr dict certain impacts after de ecting a GLE event, b cause the GLE and SEP intensiti s are co related [200]. Similarly, predicting the shock arrival (SSC) at 1 au [201] has value, because spacecraft anomalies also peak a couple of days after SSC (see Figure 18). We have mainly considered the space weather consequences of solar eruptions and coronal holes. We have not considered CME initiation or the trigger of eruptions [202\u2013205]. The discussions in this paper are concerned with the mature stage of CMEs after the completion of magnetic reconnection in the eruption region [206]. The mature flux rope that follows after the initial seed flux rope becomes unstable and initiates the flare reconnection [207]. The seed flux rope can be hot [208] or cold (associated with a filament) [209,210]. We have also not discussed another aspect of CMEs and CIRs, viz., the Forbush decrease (see [211\u2013213] and references therein), nor the overall increase in cosmic ray flux due to weak solar activity [214]. The solar and heliospheric community has made enormous progress in understanding solar magnetic variability and its impact on the inner heliosphere, especially on Earth\u2019s space environment. The progress can be attributed to the rapid advances in space missions\nAtmosphere 2022, 13, 1781 27 of 34\nthat culminated in SOHO and STEREO. Recent observatories, such as the Parker Solar Probe and the Solar Orbiter, have started aiding deeper investigations of solar variability. Data from multiple views of the Sun from vantage points away from the Sun\u2013Earth line (L4 and L5, polar orbit), coupled with global MHD modeling, are expected to rapidly advance our knowledge of solar magnetic variability.\nFunding: This research was funded by NASA\u2019s Living With a Star program.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: All data used in the article are publicly available and the URLs provided.\nAcknowledgments: This review article benefited greatly from NASA\u2019s open data policy in using SOHO, STEREO, and SDO data.
