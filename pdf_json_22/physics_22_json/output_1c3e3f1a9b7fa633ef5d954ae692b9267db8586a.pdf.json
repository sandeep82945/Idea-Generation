            "text": "i\nThe quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect has attracted extensive research interest because of the potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing, which is attributable to two\nii\nconducting edge channels with opposite spin polarization and the quantized electronic conduc- tance of 2e2/h. Recently, 2M-WS2, a new stable phase of transition metal dichalcogenides with a 2M structure showing an identical layer configuration to that of the monolayer 1T\u2032 TMDs, was suggested to be a QSH insulator as well as a superconductor with critical transition temper- ature around 8 K. Here, high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES are applied to investigate the electronic and spin structure of the topological surface states (TSS) in the superconducting 2M-WS2. The TSS exhibits charac- teristic spin-momentum-locking behavior, suggesting the existence of long-sought nontrivial Z2 topological states therein. We expect that 2M-WS2 with co-existing superconductivity and TSS might host the promising Majorana bound states.\nKEYWORDS: topological surface state, ARPES, spin-resolved ARPES, 2M-WS2,\nmonolayer 1T\u2032 TMDs, superconductor\nLayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of group VIB, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), which host variant intriguing quantum states of matter such as Weyl semimetal,1\u20135 topological insulator,6\u201310 quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect ,11\u201314 valley Hall effect,15,16 and superconductivity,17\u201320 have aroused great interest in both fundamental and applied research. Moreover,\nthe family of MX2 material have been discovered in a variety of stable phases with different stacking configurations (such as 3R, 2H 1T, 1T\u2032 and 1Td), which provide a unique knot to fine-tune properties of MX2 by simply regulating the number of layers and stacking configurations. At present, few-layer or even monolayer MX2 with a relatively large area (~ hundreds of microns) has been readily prepared through reliable means such as the mechanical exfoliation,9,18,21 chemical vapor deposition,22,23 and molecular beam epitaxy.6\u20138\nAmong the family of MX2 materials, monolayer 1T\u2032 structured TMDs (MoTe2 and WTe2) were suggested as promising candidates to realize QSH in strictly two-dimensional (2D) systems ,11\u201314 in contrast to those previously reported quantum-well heterostructures based on three-dimensional (3D) semiconductors such as HgTe/CdTe24\u201327 and InAs/GaSb.28,29 Such QSH\ninsulators are expected to harbor two conducting edge channels with quantized electric conductance 2e2/h and opposite spin polarizations, which are robustly protected by the timereversal symmetry.11\u201314,24\u201329 In terms of the electronic structure, the quantized electric\nconductance is attributed to the topologically protected edge modes, which are generated by the\niii\nstrong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced band inversion. In this regard, topological edge states are hallmarks of QSH.30 However, it is difficult to distinguish between electronic states from the bulk and surface for thin flakes,31 and the characteristic features of edge states in monolayer 1T\u2032-\nMX2 have not yet been fully investigated experimentally in photoemission measurements.\nRecently, a new meta-stable 2M-WS2, in which \u2018M\u2019 indicates the monoclinic crystallographic structure, has been synthesized, hosting both enchanting topologically surface state and supercon- ductivity.17,32\u201341 It is noteworthy that 2M-WS2 shares the identical monolayer crystal structure with that of 1T\u2032-WS2, while its stacking has a different packing to the 1T\u2032 phase, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). In other words, the bulk 2M-WS2 is regarded as the simple stacking of infinite 1T\u2032-WS2 monolayers, which are weakly coupled by the van der Waals interaction. Thus, the band structure obtained from surface sensitive photoemission spectroscopy on 2M-WS2 might shed light on the characteristic Z2 topological invariant and inverted band gap in monolayered 1T\u2032-WS2. 17,32,33,35,36 In addition, 2M-WS2 behaves as a type-II superconductor with the record-high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 8.8 K among all reported TMDs,17,34,38\u201341 and its extremely large magnetoresistance35 and Majorana bound states have been reported recently.37 Therefore, this material was considered as a promising candidate for\nachieving the topological superconductivity and QSH insulator due to the coexistence of\nsuperconductivity and topological non-trivial surface states.\nHerein, we employ both the high-resolution and spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure and helical spin texture of\ntopological surface states (TSSs) of 2M-WS2, respectively. Our photoemission spectra show a clear kz dependence of band dispersion which can demonstrate the surface localized state, and our model was derived using a hybrid approach that combines density-functional theory\ncalculations and symmetry considerations. Without SOC, the bulk bands with different parities\noverlap, forming the Dirac band crossing along the \u0393-Y direction. While the strong SOC would\nlift the degeneracy at the Dirac point, leading to an inverted band gap due to the preservation of\nthe inversion and time- reversal symmetries. Thus, it can allow to realize the existence of\ntopological surface states in the inverted band gap of 2M-WS2. The surface state exhibits no kz dependence inside the inverted bulk band gap, which is consistent with that predicted by the\nband calculation. Additionally, the spin polarization of 2M-WS2 is elucidated to show the spin helical texture in the TSS. The spin polarization along the y-direction Py has an opposite sign between \u2212k and +k momentum points, but Px and Pz are negligible. Our results show the helical\niv\nspin texture of the TSS in the topological superconductor 2M-WS2.\n2M-WS2 crystallizes in a layered monoclinic structure with the C2/m space group (No. 12), in which the inversion symmetry is conserved. The corresponding lattice constants are a = 12.87 \u00c5 , b = 3.23 \u00c5 , c = 5.71 \u00c5 , \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 and \u03b2 = 112.9\u00b0, respectively.17 Figure 1(a) displays the\nunit cell of the monoclinic crystallographic structure of 2M-WS2 along the b \u2212 c (top view) and a \u2212 c (side view) planes; zig-zag chains of W atoms along the b-direction and layer\nstacking configuration. The unit cell of 2M-WS2 consists of two S-W-S sandwich monolayers,\nv\nwhich are identical to those of 1T\u2032-WS2 but are stacked along the out-of-plane a direction. In contrast, the manner of stacking for 1T\u2032-WS2 involves a 180\u00b0 rotation about c/2 and c/2 translation along the c-direction as shown in Fig. 1(a). In this way, it draws a close analogy between bulk 3R phase and monolayer 2H phase MX2. 42 The crystal structure of 3R phase shares the same monolayer of 2H-MX2 but stacks such layers along the out-of-plane direction with a pure translation operation, so that bulk 3R-MX2 should retain a similar broken inversion symmetry to that of monolayered 2H-MX2. Moreover, bulk 3R-MX2 exhibits spin band splitting for the opposite sign at different valleys, which is unique and can thus demonstrate the valley Hall effect in monolayer 2H-MX2. 42\nFigure 1(b) shows the 3D bulk Brillouin zone (BZ) of monoclinic 2M-WS2. The surface BZ\nis projected to the kx-ky plane, and \u0393\u0304 -Y\u0304 (ky) corresponds to the W-W chain direction (b-axis). Figure 1(c) displays the calculated band structure of 2M-WS2 with the orbital characteristics along the C-\u0393-C high symmetry direction, akin to that of the monolayered 1T\u2032-MX2, one wellknown QSH insulator in TMDs.6,11\u201314,43 Our calculations imply that the conduction band\nminimum (valence band maximum) of 2M-WS2 is mainly attributed to the d (p) orbital of W (S) atoms, with an even (odd) parity around the \u0393 point, respectively. With SOC, considering the\nsymmetry of 2M-WS2, bands with different parity will be mixed, opening the inverted band gap around the zone center.\nFigure 1(d) further illustrates schematically such SOC-induced topological phase transition.\nGiven the distortion from the 1T to 1T\u2032 phase, the band inversion occurs around the \u0393 point, and\nband crossings give rise to Dirac cones along the ky-axis. With the SOC considered, the degeneracy at these crossing points will be lifted, which results in the gap opening between the\ninverted bands. The symmetry and band inversion, together with strong SOC, allow the\ntopological phase transition to a Z2 insulator, which guarantees the topologically protected edge states. It is expected that these edge states will connect the electron and hole pockets, which is similar behavior with predicted surface state in the monolayer 1T\u2032-MX2. 6\u201310,43 Figure 1(e) shows the photoemission intensity plot of 2M-WS2 along the ky-direction. Through comparing with the calculation, it was found that the Dirac point of the topological non-trivial surface band should\nbe above the Fermi level and the hole-like feature is the lower part of the Dirac cone. Thus, our\nfinding confirms the existence of the TSS of 2M-WS2 and such a surface band is markedly reminiscent of the predicted edge mode in monolayered 1T\u2032-MX2. 6\u201314\nFigures 2 (a) and 2 (b) compare our experimental Fermi surface mappings taken for kz = 0\nvi\n(h\u03c5 = 33 eV) and \u03c0 (h\u03c5 = 45 eV) planes with corresponding calculations, respectively. For the kz = 0 plane (Fig. 2(a)), two electron pockets intersect with the Fermi level, which resembles the Fermi surface topology of monolayered 1T\u2032-MX2. 6,8\u201310,43 The electron pocket is found to be elongated in the \u0393-E direction, compared with that of the monolayered 1T\u2032-MX2, and consists of only electron pocket with a bulk state at the Fermi surface. Given the kz dependence of states\nfrom the ARPES measurement (bulk band calculation). The kx (ky) refers to the \u0393\u0304 -X\u0304 (\u0393\u0304 -Y\u0304 ) direction. The blue (red) line at the \u0393 (Z) plane indicates the electron (hole) pocket. The\nARPES spectra at kz = \u0393 (c) and Z point (d) along the black dotted line from (a) and (b). The right-hand panel in (c) and (d) show second derivative spectra of the corresponding left-hand\npanels to enhance the visualization. The bulk band calculation at the \u0393 (e) and Z-plane (f).\nnear the Fermi level, the Fermi surface taken in the kz = Z plane shows hole pockets along both Z-E2 and Z-C2 directions as marked in Fig. 2(b). For both kz = 0 and \u03c0 cases, there exists evident spectral weight around the zone center which is absent in bulk band calculations. Furthermore,\nregardless of kz values, such a feature in the bulk band gap show the similar behavior as shown in the kx-ky plane. Both pieces of evidence suggest that this feature originated from the TSS of 2MWS2.\nMore detailed low-energy band dispersions taken along cuts marked by dashed black lines in\nFigs. 2(a) and 2(b) are displayed in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). Moreover, the corresponding second\nderivative intensity plots are demonstrated in the right-hand panels of Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). Both\nvii\nband dispersions exhibit good agreement with the calculations of the bulk bands as shown in\nFigs. 2(e) and 2(f). For kz = 0 (Fig. 2(c)), there exist extra features around the zone center in the vicinity of the Fermi level besides the predicted bulk electron-like bands; while for the kz = \u03c0 plane, the bulk bands crossing the Fermi level become hole-like. Given the strong SOC in 2M-\nWS2, the inverted band gap is located between the electron pocket as the CBM and hole pocket as\nthe VBM near the \u0393\u0304 point. This band gap is induced by the band inversion and lifting the state\ndegeneracy along the ky-direction, resulting in the emergence of the TSS inside the bulk band gap near the Fermi level. Besides, we performed the detailed polarization-dependent ARPES\nmeasurements on this compounds, as illustrated in Supporting Information. We note the orbital\ncharacter of 2M-WS2 along the \u0393-Y direction is almost identical to that of the monolayer 1T\u2032WTe2, 6,43 which further implies that the monolayer 1T\u2032-WS2 would be a promising candidate for the quantum spin Hall insulator.\nviii\nNext, the slab calculations along G-Y were calculated to demonstrate the details of the TSS\naround the zone center (Fig. 3(a)). Given the existence of the inverted gap around \u0393\u0305 close to\nthe Fermi level, the distinct feature in the gap is attributed to topologically protected helical surface band, which is also consistent with previous reports.17,32,33 This topological surface\nband connects the VBM with the 3p orbital (\u2212 parity) and the CBM with the 5d orbital (+ parity)\nso that it shows the hole-like dispersion as marked with orange lines in Fig. 3(a). It should be\nnoted that these calculations, particularly for the surface bands, are in good agreement with our\nexperimental band structure shown in Fig. 3(a). Figure 3(b) shows the evolution of the hole-like\ndispersion of the TSS in the constant energy contours at the different binding energy.\nThen, detailed photon-energy dependent ARPES measurements (27 \u2264 h\u03c5 \u2264 54 eV) on 2M-\nWS2 were performed to investigate the topological surface band (for details, see Supporting Information). It is noted that the probing photon energy range can cover more than one BZ along\nkz. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the clear periodic pattern is observed in the kz-ky intensity map. Given this periodicity, kz \u2248 1.06 \u00c5 \u22121 (kz = 2\u03c0/a *, where a* is 5.93 \u00c5 ) and an inner potential of 12.5 eV can be obtained. a* is determined by the perpendicular distance between the layer of 1M-WS2 as given by a* = (a/2) sin(\u03b2). The length of a* attributable to the periodicity of kz and inner potential is determined by the shortest distance between the 1M-WS2 layers, not the length of a in the mono- clinic unit cell of 2M-WS2. In contrast to the kz dispersion of the bulk band, the TSS has typical quasi-two-dimensional band dispersion along the kz-direction and the spectral weight remain at ky = 0 over more than one periodicity of BZ because the surface state is localized in the surface of the 2M-WS2.\nThe topological non-trivial surface band should be spin-polarized, as suggested by our first-\nprinciples calculations. Afterwards, spin-resolved ARPES was used to realize this prediction.\nThe low-energy photoemission spectra obtained from the laser-based ARPES with 6.994 eV\nphotons clearly displays the fine dispersion of the TSS in kx-ky plane with the higher momentum resolution in Fig. 4(a). The TSS dispersion at Fermi surface is good agreement with that obtained\nfrom the slab calculation in Fig. 4(b). The hole-like band dispersion near ky = 0 corresponds to the lower part of the Dirac cone of TSS, and the band crossings are expected to be located above\nthe Fermi level. To characterize the helical spin structure of the TSS, we utilize the spin-resolved\nARPES equipped with the double very-low-energy electron diffraction spin detectors for the 3D\nspin-resolution along the x, y, and z-axis, and the photon-electron intensity attributable to the\ndifferent magnetization directions M+ and M\u2212 for the x, y, and z-directions can be obtained. With\nix\nthe relationship (given the details of the experimental method), the spin-resolved energy\ndistribution curves (EDCs) sx, sy, and sz, were extracted respectively. Figure 4(c) shows the spinresolved EDCs of sy with red and blue colors assigned for spin-up and spin-down, respectively, which indicate that the sign of sy is reversed between kL and kR.\nTo reveal the difference of spin momentum at kL and kR, the magnitude of spin-polarization Py attributable to the spin-resolved EDCs sy was determined as shown in Fig. 4(d). The in-plane spinpolarization Py is reversed between kL and kR near the Fermi level in Fig. 4(d), but another spinpolarization Px and Pz are negligible (the spin-polarization map of Px, Py and Pz can be seen in Supporting Information). It is expected that the TSS of 2M-WS2 has the helical spin texture, thus allowing the opposite spin direction between left and right momenta at the Fermi level. Note that\nour experiments about the spin-polarization successfully show the spin-momentum-locked TSS in\nx\n2M-WS2 as illustrated in Fig. 4(d). In the view of the Fermi surface based on our experimental results, the lower Dirac cone branch of the TSS in 2M-WS2 has a helical spin texture with a clockwise rotation (for details of calculation, see Supporting Information). Our spin-resolved ARPES results are good agreement with the usual topological feature44 and the band calculation in\nFig. 4(b). Given the crystal and electronic structural similarity between 2M-WS2 and monolayer 1T\u2032-MX2, 6,8\u201310,17,33,43 it is expected that the spin-resolved ARPES results of the TSS in 2M-WS2 provide important information about the edge conductance and spin-based device as manufactured\nwith QSH insulator, monolayer 1T\u2032-MX2 and about the topology of the 2M phase of TMDs.\nTo conclude, both the high-resolution and spin-resolved ARPES were used to investigate the\nelectronic structure and helical spin texture of TSSs of 2M-WS2, respectively. The results indicate that the TSS is located in the inverted band gap, consistent with the calculation. Additionally, the\nspin polarization along the y-direction Py has opposite signs between kL and kR momentum points, but Px and Pz are negligible. Our results show the helical spin texture of the TSS in the topological superconductor 2M-WS2. Thus, the band structure obtained from surface-sensitive photoemission spectroscopy on 2M-WS2 may shed light on the characteristic Z2 topological invariant and inverted band gap in monolayered 1T\u2032-WS2. Besides, this material can be considered as a promising candidate for realizing the topological superconductivity and QSH insulator due to the\ncoexistence of superconductivity and topological non-trivial surface states."

The ARPES spectra taken with s-polarized light in Fig. S2(e) is similar to the band structure for ARPES spectra obtained from the synchrotron-based ARPES measurement in previous report [1]. For the briefly summary, Figure S3 show the schematic picture for the bulk state at the kz = \u0393 and Z plane, together with the parity of the orbital character and the polarization direction. The color coded with the blue (red) in the calculated bulk band indicate the non-vanishing photoemission intensity determined by the initial state and s- (p-) polarized light.\nxxii"

The bulk state near the Fermi level indicates strong kz dependence, but the TSS remains intact regardless of the photon energy. The TSS at 36 and 39 eV seems to show a disconnected state from the bulk state, indicating that the state exists in the bulk band gap. This feature of the TSS is consistent with the band calculation with the surface state in Fig. S4(a).\nxxiii"
