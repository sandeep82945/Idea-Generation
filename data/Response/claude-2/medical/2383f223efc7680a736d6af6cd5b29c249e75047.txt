 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop and validate a COVID-19 stigma scale for other countries and cultures. This paper developed a scale for Indonesia, but stigma likely manifests differently across cultures. Creating and validating scales for other locales would allow better understanding of stigma globally. 

2. Test interventions to reduce COVID-19 stigma. Now that a scale exists to measure stigma, researchers could develop and test educational campaigns, contact-based strategies, counselling approaches, etc. to reduce stigma. Effective interventions could then be implemented more broadly.

3. Examine the relationship between stigma and health outcomes. The paper hypothesizes stigma could prevent people from seeking care, but does not test this. Future studies could use the scale to correlate stigma levels with care-seeking behaviors, treatment compliance, and health outcomes. 

4. Study stigma's effects on COVID-19 control efforts. The paper suggests stigma slowed pandemic control, but does not empirically demonstrate this. Research could examine if higher stigma levels reduced testing rates, contact tracing participation, etc. and thereby worsened outbreaks.

5. Investigate stigma's psychological effects on patients. The paper focuses on stigma's public health impacts, but it likely also has psychological effects on infected individuals. Studies could look at stigma's influence on COVID-19 patients' stress, self-esteem, social isolation, and mental health.
