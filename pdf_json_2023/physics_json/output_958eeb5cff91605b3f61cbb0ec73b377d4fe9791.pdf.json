    "abstractText": "The robustness of NMR coherence transfer in proximity of a paramagnetic center depends on the relaxation properties of the nuclei involved. In the case of Iron-Sulfur Proteins, different pulse schemes or different parameter sets often provide complementary results. Tailored versions of HCACO and CACO experiments significantly increase the number of observed C\u03b1/C\u2019 connectivities in highly paramagnetic systems, by recovering many resonances that were lost due to paramagnetic relaxation. Optimized 13C direct detected experiments can significantly extend the available assignments, improving the overall knowledge of these systems. The different relaxation properties of C\u03b1 and C\u2019 nuclei are exploited in CACO vs COCA experiments and the complementarity of the two experiments is used to obtain structural information. The two [Fe2S2] clusters containing NEET protein CISD3 and the one [Fe4S4] cluster containing HiPIP protein PioC have been taken as model systems. We show that tailored experiments contribute to decrease the blind sphere around the cluster, to extend resonance assignment of cluster bound cysteine residues and to retrieve details on the topology of the iron-bound ligand residues.",

            "text": "The direct detection of 13C NMR is routinely used in biomolecular NMR to complement 1H detected experiments and to obtain information that cannot be obtained via 1H detection (Bermel et\u00a0al. 2006a; Felli and Pierattelli 2022). Usually, the gain in sensitivity is given by the polarization transfer from 1H to 13C spins, which largely overcomes the signal loss due to the 1H transverse relaxation during the\nINEPT transfer and, in many applications, provides better results than 13C-start experiments (Shimba et\u00a0al. 2004; Bermel et\u00a0al. 2009; Richter et\u00a0al. 2010; Pontoriero et\u00a0al. 2020; V\u00f6geli et\u00a0al. 2005; Pritchard and Hansen 2019). However, in paramagnetic metalloproteins, nuclear relaxation rates depend on the square of the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b32) of the nucleus investigated, on the r\u22126 dependence from metalto-nucleus distance and, for the first coordination sphere, on the amount of unpaired electron spin density delocalized from the metal ion(s) to the nuclear spins (Miao et\u00a0al. 2022; Pell et\u00a0al. 2019; Trindade et\u00a0al. 2022; Bertini et\u00a0al. 2017). Therefore, the choice of the most efficient experiment is not trivial: complementary results are often obtained when the same experiment is recorded with different pulse schemes (Arnesano et\u00a0al. 2003; Gelis et\u00a0al. 2003; Invernici et\u00a0al. 2020; Ciofi-Baffoni et\u00a0al. 2014) and \u201cnon-systematic\u201d assignment strategies, tailored according to the relaxation properties of specific spin systems, need to be defined (Trindade et\u00a0al. 2021a).\nIn protein NMR, backbone C\u03b1-C\u2019 connectivities are very useful for sequence-specific and site-specific assignments, because of the correlation between chemical shift values\n* Mario Piccioli piccioli@cerm.unifi.it\nRicardo O.

Many experiments have been designed to identify homonuclear C\u03b1-C\u2019 connectivities (Bertini et\u00a0al. 2005a; Lee et\u00a0al. 2005; Machonkin et\u00a0al. 2002; Kostic et\u00a0al. 2002; Bax 2011), which can also be used to address macromolecular dynamics and interactomics (Stenstrom et\u00a0al. 2022; Mori et\u00a0al. 2010; Ferrage et\u00a0al. 2006). In paramagnetic systems, relaxation losses easily make a 13C-start experiment comparable and eventually more sensitive than a corresponding 1H-start experiment (Pontoriero et\u00a0al. 2020; Balayssac et\u00a0al. 2006). The intrinsic asymmetry of CACO experiments can also be exploited: CACO is based on a single coherence transfer step from the excited nucleus to the observed nucleus, therefore transferring magnetization from C\u03b1 to C\u2019 or vice versa, in the COCA experiment, would call into the scene different relaxation rates. As a consequence, complementary information are obtained from C\u03b1 to C\u2019 and C\u2019 to C\u03b1 transfer pathways (Machonkin et\u00a0al. 2002; Bertini et\u00a0al. 2005b), contributing to characterize the first coordination sphere of a metal center. In the absence of magnetic anisotropies of the metal ions, when no structural information can be obtained from chemical shifts (Pintacuda et\u00a0al. 2007; Zhu et\u00a0al. 2023; Wu et\u00a0al. 2022; Herath et\u00a0al. 2021; Muntener et\u00a0al. 2022; Parker et\u00a0al. 2020), the proximity of the metal center can be monitored only by mapping the paramagnetic relaxation of nuclear spins nearby and each individual spin system has a different behaviour, depending on its topology vis-\u00e0-vis the metal center (Trindade et\u00a0al. 2021a).\nWithin this frame, we considered the behaviour of two different paramagnetic metalloproteins: CISD3 and PioC, both containing iron-sulfur clusters. At variance with other metalloproteins, in which the electron relaxation is driven by the coordination number of the metal ion (Spronk et\u00a0al. 2018; Ravera et\u00a0al. 2021; Beniamino et\u00a0al. 2022; Trindade et\u00a0al. 2021b), the electronic correlation times in iron-sulfur proteins are determined by the magnetic coupling among the iron ions. Therefore, different FeS clusters affect their protein environments at different extent (Blondin and Girerd 1990; Banci et\u00a0al. 2018, 1990; close to the molecular mechanism understanding 2018; Bennett et\u00a0al. 2022; Azam et\u00a0al. 2020; Gervason et\u00a0al. 2019; Stegmaier et\u00a0al. 2019; Mulliez et\u00a0al. 1999; Trindade et\u00a0al. 2023). CISD3 (CDGSH Iron Sulfur Domain-3) is a 93 aminoacids protein containing two [Fe2S2]+ clusters (Karmi et\u00a0al. 2018; Tamir et\u00a0al. 2015). Each cluster is coordinated by a 3-Cys, 1-His biding motif, embedded into a highly conserved domain, called CDGSH domain. The protein is a monomer and the two CDGSH domains are similar but not equivalent. Both clusters are in the reduced [Fe2S2]+ form, formally containing one Fe3+ and one Fe2+ ion (Golinelli-Cohen et\u00a0al. 2016; Gee et\u00a0al. 2021; Camponeschi et\u00a0al. 2022). The crystallographic structure of the protein is available only for the H75C/H113C mutant (Lipper et\u00a0al. 2018). We used CISD3 because an extended\nassignment of the protein has been recently obtained from a combination of standard and tailored 1H and 13C detected experiments (Silva et\u00a0al. 2023). The system is particularly challenging because [Fe2S2]+ clusters are efficient relaxing agents (Camponeschi et\u00a0al. 2021; Cai et\u00a0al. 2017; Pochapsky et\u00a0al. 2001; Valer et\u00a0al. 2022) and paramagnetism affects about 60% of residues in CISD3 (Grifagni et\u00a0al. 2023), preventing the identification of the NMR signals of the cluster-bound residues and the resolution of the NMR solution structure. PioC, a High Potential Iron Protein (HiPIP) from Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 (Bird et\u00a0al. 2014), is a very small protein (54 amino acids) that contains a single [Fe4S4]2+ cluster. The electron relaxation times of iron ions in [Fe4S4]2+ clusters are shorter than the [Fe2S2]+ case, for this reason the detection of C\u03b1/C\u2019 connectivities of ironbound cysteine residues can be attempted and a high-quality NMR structure has been obtained (Trindade et\u00a0al. 2021c) (PDB ID: 6XYV).\nTogether, these two iron-sulfur proteins will assess the performances of CACO experiments in systems characterized by different relaxation properties. On the one hand, we will show how the optimization and the combination of 1H and 13C start experiments contribute to improve the resonance assignment in highly paramagnetic systems. On the other hand, when signal losses due to paramagnetism are less severe and a complete resonance assignment can be obtained, the structural dependence of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements can be exploited in many intriguing ways."

            "text": "Tailored HCACO experiments contribute to\u00a0resonance assignment: the\u00a0case of\u00a0CISD3\nCISD3 is a small protein that contains two [Fe2S2]+ clusters. Triple resonance NMR experiments recorded using routine parameter sets, permit the identification of only ca 40% of the protein residues, consistent with a detectability threshold of about 9\u00a0\u00c5 from each iron ion of the cluster (Camponeschi et\u00a0al. 2021). Our interest here is to discuss the complementarity of various CACO experiments (Bertini et\u00a0al. 2005a; Bermel et\u00a0al. 2003, 2005a). In particular, the comparison of 1H vs 13C start CACO experiments promise to reveal unique information on the metal to nucleus distances of the spin systems that are affected by the paramagnetic center.\nFirst, we compared two HCACO experiments recorded with the same pulse sequence (Fig.\u00a01) but using two different parameter sets. One experiment was recorded with a conventional parameter set, optimized for a small/medium sized protein, the other was recorded by optimizing all delays for the detection of fast relaxing signals and for minimizing signal losses. While 43 signals are observed in the\n1 3\n\u201croutine\u201d version of the HCACO and then sequence specifically assigned, thirteen additional signals appeared in the \u201cparamagnetic\u201d spectrum. Out of them, nine signals have been sequence specifically assigned (black-labelled peaks in Fig.\u00a02A) using a combination of standard and tailored triple resonance NMR experiments (Grifagni et\u00a0al. 2023). These residues are at H\u03b1-Fe distances in the range 7\u20138.7\u00a0\u00c5 (except for Thr 80 and Ser 83, both in the linker region between the two CDGSH domains, where some conformational rearrangements in solution might take place), indicating that the blind sphere of the optimized HCACO experiment has decreased. The four peaks identified but not yet assigned in\nthe tailored HCACO are also expected to be within the same H\u03b1-Fe distance range, this significantly restricts the number of possible candidates for their assignment. Moreover, all nuclear spins within this distance range from the paramagnetic center should experience paramagnetic relaxation but no paramagnetic shift (Banci et\u00a0al. 2018; Camponeschi et\u00a0al. 2019), therefore chemical shift values can also be used for signal assignment. In the tailored CACO spectrum of Fig.\u00a02A, the signal at 175.4/44.5\u00a0ppm can be safely attributed to a glycine residue. There are three unassigned glycine residues in CISD3, all located in proximity to an iron ion. Only Gly 63 has an H\u03b1 more than 6\u00a0\u00c5 apart from the closest iron\nFig. 1 A Standard HCACO experiment. White and dashed 180\u00b0 pulses indicate IPAP scheme for virtual homo-decoupling of C\u03b1/C coherence. The colored panels highlight parts of the pulse scheme that have been modified during the optimization process. The delays utilized in the routine HCACO experiment are the following \u03b4 = 1.8\u00a0ms, \u03b4\u2019 = 1.1\u00a0ms, \u0394 = 4.5\u00a0ms, \u03a4 = 14.2\u00a0ms. The first modification, highlighted in yellow, eliminates the C\u03b1/C\u03b2 coupling evolution period. T is set equal to \u0394 = 4.5\u00a0ms, the two 180\u00b0 C\u03b1 and C\u2019 pulses are applied together. The next modification, highlighted in green, removes the IPAP scheme for virtual homo-decoupling. The entire block is removed and acquisition begins immediately after the last 90\u00a0\u00b0C\u2019 pulse. In the subsequent step, highlighted in\u00a0red, the H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT delay \u03b4 was shortened from 1.8\u00a0ms to 0.7\u00a0ms. The last modi-\nfication, highlighted in purple, shortens the C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 INEPT delay \u2206 from 4.5\u00a0ms to 2.7\u00a0ms. The phase cycle, maintained throughout the modifcations, is: \u03a61 = x; \u03a62 = y; \u03a63 = x, \u2212 x; \u03a64 = x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y; \u03a65 = x, x, x, x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x; \u03a66 = \u2212 y, \u2212 y, \u2212 y, \u2212 y, y, y, y, y; \u03a67 = x, x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x; \u03a6Rec = x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x, x, \u2212 x, x, x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x, x, x, \u2212 x, x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x, x. B The CACO-AP and C COCAAP pulse schemes implemented with a C\u03b1-to-C' INEPT delay equal to \u0394 = 2.7\u00a0ms. The phase cycle for the two experiments is the following: \u03a61 = x; \u03a62 = y; \u03a63 = x, \u2212 x; \u03a64 = x, x, x, x, y, y, y,y; \u03a65 = x, x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x; \u03a6Rec = x, \u2212 x, \u2212 x, x, \u2212 x, x, x, \u2212 x. Gradient strenght was gp1 = 30%, gp2 = 50%. PFG gradients used in all the pulse sequences had a sine bell shape and duration of 1\u00a0ms. The period set for the dissipation of circulating currents was 200\u00a0\u03bcs\n1 3\nion. This is the only distance compatible with the observed HCACO peak, and therefore we assign this signal to Gly 63. Likewise, the peak at 178.7/53.5\u00a0ppm is assigned because these chemical shifts are characteristic of alanine residues and the only alanine residue not yet assigned is Ala 102, which has the H\u03b1 at 6.1\u00a0\u00c5 from the iron ion. We are then left with two signals at relatively downfield C\u03b1 values (labelled with red asterisks in Fig.\u00a02A), whose C\u03b1/C\u2019 shifts might be consistent with valine, phenilalanine or leucine. The only candidates for the assignment are Val 61, Phe 76 and Leu 82, which have H\u03b1-Fe distances of 5.7\u00a0\u00c5, 7.0\u00a0\u00c5 and 7.9\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. Among them, we might speculate that Val 61 is probably too close to the iron ion to be observable and, therefore, Phe 76 and Leu 82 are the most likely candidates for the two unassigned peaks of Fig.\u00a02A."

            "text": "To compare the features of 13C- vs 1H-excitation, we performed a CACO-AP experiment, in which both the initial H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT and the final C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 IPAP are removed, and signal detected as a C\u2019 antiphase doublet, phased in dispersion mode (Bertini et\u00a0al. 2005a). The pulse sequence for this experiment is reported in Fig.\u00a01B. As expected, for signals that are not affected by the paramagnetic center, the sensitivity of the CACO-AP experiment is lower than the\nHCACO. Nevertheless, Fig.\u00a02B shows nine additional signals in the CACO-AP, compared to the 1H\u03b1-start HCACO. These resonances have not been observed in other 1H start experiments (with a few exceptions discussed here below), because their scalar coupled 1H nuclei are too close to the metal to be observed, with estimated metal-to-proton distances shorter than 7.0\u00a0\u00c5. Protonless experiments, in which fast relaxing protons are never involved into the coherence transfer pathway (Balayssac et\u00a0al. 2006), provide the best coherence pathways to circumvent signal losses due to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. As outlined previously in the case of tailored HCACO, signals identification within a given experiment is associated to a well-defined distance range between electron and nuclear spins. When a structure is available, the predicted distance range and the chemical shifts information allow us to propose some assignments. Among signals exclusively observed in the CACO-AP experiment (Fig.\u00a02B), two of them fall in the peculiar CACO region of threonine residues. There are three unassigned threonine residues in CISD3: Thr 99, Thr 103 and Thr 112, all belonging to the C-term CDGSH domain and close to the C-term cluster (cluster 2, hereafter). The signal at 173.1/62.9\u00a0ppm is completely missing in the tailored HCACO, however in the CON experiment (data not shown), there is a non-assigned correlation between a C\u2019 at 173.1\u00a0ppm and a, still unassigned, N backbone atoms\nFig. 2 175\u00a0MHz, 298\u00a0K NMR spectra of reduced CISD3. A HCACO spectra obtained using the sequence reported in Fig.\u00a0 1A. The spectrum shown in red (standard dataset) has been obtained with the following parameters: acquisition (t2max) and recycle delays 92\u00a0 ms and 1\u00a0 s; \u03b4 = 1.8\u00a0 ms, \u03b4\u2019 = 1.1\u00a0 ms, \u2206 = 4.5\u00a0 ms, T = 14.2\u00a0 ms. 32 scans each FID were recorded over a 1024 \u00d7 660 data point matrix. Total experimental time was 6.5\u00a0 h. The spectrum shown in black (paramagnetic tailored dataset) has been obtained with acquisition (t2max) and recycle delays 46\u00a0 ms and 400\u00a0 ms; \u03b4 = 1.4\u00a0 ms, \u03b4\u2019 = 1.1\u00a0 ms, T = \u2206 = 2.7\u00a0ms. 1024 scans each FID were recorded over a 512 \u00d7 50 data point matrix. Total experimental time was 6.5\u00a0 h. Assignment\nreported in black shows residues that could be sequence specifically assigned with a set of paramagnetic tailored experiments60, labels in red indicate peaks that were identified, and some of them assigned, in this experiment. B HCACO (black) vs CACO-AP (blue). The spectrum shown in black is the same reported in panel A, the spectrum shown in blue has been obtained with the pulse sequence reported in Fig.\u00a0 1B, with acquisition (t2max) and recycle delays 24.5\u00a0 ms and 300\u00a0 ms. The C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 INEPT period was set to \u2206 = 2.7\u00a0 ms. 1024 scans each FID were recorded over a 512 \u00d7 70 data point matrix. Total experimental time was 6.5\u00a0 h. Labels show peaks that were observed only in the CACO-AP and discussed throughout the text\n1 3\nat 116.6\u00a0ppm. This pattern suggests that this CACO peak belongs to a threonine residue with an H\u03b1 very close to the metal center but with the C\u2019 nucleus relatively far from the iron ion, enough to allow the detection of its CON peak. The nucleus-to-iron distances of all unassigned amino acids, which are reported in Table\u00a0S1, are well consistent with the assignment to Thr 103, connected with Gln 104, whose HN group has not been assigned. The other threonine peak, observed in the CACO-AP at 174.5/63.3\u00a0ppm, is barely detectable also in the HCACO experiment but it does not have any possible connectivity in the CON spectrum, indicating a different orientation of this spin system versus the cluster, compared with Thr 103. We expect for this residue larger Fe-H\u03b1 and shorter Fe\u2013C\u2019 distances than Thr 103. According to Table\u00a0S1, this is the case of Thr 112. By exclusion, Thr 99 would remain unobserved, because Thr 99 has shorter metal-to-carbon distances than the other two threonine residues. The two signals at 184.9/41.1 and 180.2/41.3\u00a0ppm can be attributed to C\u03b2-C\u03b3 connectivities of aspartate residues. According to the crystallographic structure of the H75C/H113C double mutant, both carboxylate groups of Asp 72 and Asp 110, which are the only two aspartate residues of the protein, are at about 6\u00a0\u00c5 from the iron and, therefore, they might be observable in a CACOAP experiment. Their residue specific assignment is much more tentative: both carboxylate groups are expected to form H-bonds with Ser 74 and Thr 112, respectively. At variance with Asp 72, the side chain of Asp 110 is also very close to the guanidinium moiety of Arg 105, which might explain the unusual downfield shift of aspartate C\u03b3 signals and suggest the assignment proposed in Fig.\u00a02B. There are five additional signals observed in the CACO-AP experiment that, following previous considerations, belong to residues with C\u03b1/C\u2019 distances in the range 5.0/6.5\u00a0\u00c5 from the metal center, i.e. the distance range experienced by the herewith assigned threonine backbone C\u03b1/C\u2019 and aspartate side chains C\u03b2/C\u03b3 signals. Possible candidates, according to Table\u00a0S1, are: Pro 46, Arg 64, Asp 72, Ser 74, Phe 76, Pro 84, Lys 101, Asp 110, which are in the proper distance range and are still unassigned. Among possible candidates we do not consider the iron-bound cysteine and histidine residues, because their C\u03b1 should experience considerable hyperfine shift (Querci et\u00a0al. 2023). The two signals at 176.2/61.5\u00a0ppm and 175.9/60.9\u00a0ppm, labelled with #, are in the Pro-Phe region and possible candidates are Pro 46, Pro 84 and Phe 76. On the other hand, the signal at 175.7/57.9\u00a0ppm, labelled with @, is within the Arg-Lys region and, therefore, candidates are Arg 64 and Lys 101. There is no possible assignment based on chemical shifts predictions for the two peaks at 181.2/57.7\u00a0ppm and 180.7/55.0\u00a0ppm, labelled with *. Unusual C\u2019 shift values may arise from the network of H-bonds around the two clusters: it has been shown that H-bonds are important to modulate the reduction potential of individual\niron ions (Langen et\u00a0al. 1992) and contribute to the delocalization of unpaired spin density from the iron ions to the backbone nitrogen atoms involved in H-bonds (Lin et\u00a0al. 2009; Xia et\u00a0al. 1999; Trindade et\u00a0al. 2020). Unpaired electron delocalization might be partly transferred also to the C\u2019 atom of the preceding residue. Ser 74, Asp 110 and also the two previously mentioned Arg 64 and Lys 101 might experience this effect. Even if these peaks are unassigned, they can be utilized to map intermolecular interactions. Indeed, they clearly arise from the immediate proximity to the cluster and are probably the NMR observables closest to the cluster that can be acquired.\nOptimization of\u00a0the\u00a0HCACO experiment: complete resonance assignment of\u00a0iron bound residues in\u00a0HiPIP protein PioC\nWe considered as a test system for the optimization of the HCACO experiment, the HiPIP protein PioC, containing a [Fe4S4]2+ cluster. At variance with CISD3, PioC is a very stable protein, its NMR assignment is almost complete and signals from residues that bind the metal center can be observed. PioC is therefore a paradigmatic case for the quantitative assessment of HCACO performances. A series of HCACO experiments, recorded with the same acquisition parameters (same number of scans, t1 increments, acquisition and recycle delays) was recorded at 1.2\u00a0GHz, and the peak intensities are reported for some selected peaks in Fig.\u00a03A. The lower panels show the C\u03b1/C\u2019 connectivities of Fe-bound cysteines, that are the residues most affected by paramagnetic relaxation; the middle panels report peak intensities of residues that are close to the paramagnetic center but do not belong to the first coordination sphere; the upper panels show peaks unaffected by paramagnetic relaxation. Figure\u00a03B shows the location of these residues within the protein frame. In the routine experiment (traces a), Cys residues are missing or only barely visible, the two Gly residues are weak and signals far from the paramagnetic center are recorded with good sensitivity. The stepwise implementation of the pulse sequence is schematically shown in Fig.\u00a01A and it allows one to analyse the contribution of each parameter to the overall effects. The removal, in the F1 dimension, of the constant time needed to refocus the homonuclear C\u03b1/C\u03b2 coupling (traces b), significantly contributes to revive signals affected by paramagnetic relaxation at the expenses of the sensitivity of signals not affected by paramagnetism. Similar effects are observed when the final IPAP scheme is replaced and signals detected as C\u2019 antiphase dispersion doublets (traces c). These two modifications are essential for the detectability of cysteine signals, but they also improve the intensities of the residues affected by paramagnetic relaxation at lower extent, like the two glycine residues Gly 23 and Gly 45 (Fig.\u00a03A middle\n1 3\npanels): whenever a significant paramagnetic contribution to relaxation occurs, these two implementations do contribute to increase the number of observable peaks. Further improvements can be obtained by shortening the delay of the H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT (d) and of the C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 INEPT (e). The sensitivity gain in these cases is strictly dependent on the behavior of the relaxation weighted coherence transfer functions, which are reported in Fig.\u00a04. In Fig.\u00a03A (lower panels), we observe that, when H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 and C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 INEPT delays are decreased from their \u201cstandard\u201d values of 3.6\u00a0ms and 9.0\u00a0ms to, respectively, 1.4\u00a0ms and 5.4\u00a0ms, signals of Fe bound Cys 25, Cys 34 and Cys 47 increase in intensity, although at different extent. On the other hand, signals of Gly 45 and Gly 23 decrease the intensity. The impact of relaxation rates on the coherence transfer affects both the efficiency of the transfer and the choice of the optimal delay. As shown in Fig.\u00a04C and D, optimal transfer delays decrease at increasing R2 values and, as a consequence, at decreasing metal-to-nucleus distances. In the case of the experiments reported in Fig.\u00a03A, delays were calibrated according to very fast nuclear relaxation, with the aim to identify signals close to the detection limit. Indeed, we observe an increase in signal intensity for C\u03b1/C\u2019 of Cys residues at the expenses, in this case, of the intensity of those signals that are affected by paramagnetism at a lower extent.\nEssentially, H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 and C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 polarization transfers act here as relaxation-based filters that select signals according to transverse relaxation rates. Figure\u00a05 shows optimized\nHCACO-AP and CACO-AP spectra recorded on PioC, in the spectral region where C\u03b1/C\u2019 connectivities of cluster bound cysteines have been assigned. Four signals, from the four iron-bound cysteine residues are observed in the CACOAP experiment. The optimized HCACO-AP experiment, recorded with an H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT transfer period of 1.4\u00a0ms, gives only three signals; indicating that the H\u03b1yC\u03b1z coherence of Cys 22 relaxes faster than the other three cysteine residues and its signal is lost prior to 13C\u03b1 t1 evolution. However, a further decrease of the transfer delay from 1.4\u00a0ms to 1\u00a0ms, succeeded to revive Cys 22 C\u03b1/C\u2019 connectivity also in an optimized HCACO-AP experiment (blue contour plot, in Fig.\u00a05).\nThe HCACO can be easily modified to evolve H\u03b1 instead of C\u03b1 during t1, i.e. an H(CA)CO experiments (Serber et\u00a0al. 2000; Bermel et\u00a0al. 2006b; Duma et\u00a0al. 2003). This was particularly useful in the case of PioC, where the \u201cmissing piece\u201d of the complete resonance assignment involve H\u03b1 of Cys residues. Three of the four cysteines\u2019 H\u03b1 protons could be unambiguously assigned with this experiment. In particular, the H\u03b1 at 8.18\u00a0ppm was previously observed in a 13C-HSQC experiment and, because of the severe overlap of three C\u03b1 cysteines\u2019 shifts, it was previously assigned to H\u03b1 of Cys 22. In the H(CA)CO-AP experiment (Fig.\u00a05, upper panel), the H\u03b1/C\u2019 correlation allows us to correctly assign the H\u03b1 at 8.18\u00a0ppm to Cys 47, leaving the H\u03b1 of Cys 22 as the only unassigned resonance of the first coordination sphere of the cluster.\nFig. 3 A Stacked rows extracted from five different HCACO experiments for seven residues of the HIPIP protein PioC.

            "text": "CACO\u2011AP vs COCA\u2011AP\nThe relaxation properties of C\u03b2, C\u03b1 and C\u2019 of iron bound cysteines depend on the orientation of backbone and side chain atoms with respect to the iron ions; different topologies of metal bound residues originate distinctive spectroscopic features. A promising tool to study this effect is the comparison of COCA-AP and CACO-AP experiments, shown in Fig.\u00a06.\nThe two pulse sequences are identical and only the C\u03b1/C\u2019 frequencies are swapped (Fig.\u00a01B, C). The experiments are based on a single coherence transfer step from the excited nucleus to the observed nucleus; performing the transfer from C\u03b1 to C\u2019 or viceversa would call into the scene different relaxation rates. Therefore, the relative intensity of COCA and CACO peaks depends on the different topologies of metal binding side chains. We recorded, on the [Fe4S4]2+ protein PioC, COCA-AP and CACO-AP under the same experimental conditions using recycle, coherence transfer\nand t1 acquisition delays of 500\u00a0ms, 5.4\u00a0ms and 2.7\u00a0ms respectively. Considering only the relaxation dependent part, peak intensities are modulated by:\nTwo parameters contribute to the asymmetry of peak intensities: (i) The different values of indirect and direct acquisition periods: in a COCA-AP experiment, the observable signals relax with R2C\u2019 during constant time 2\u2206 and R2C\u03b1 during t2 while the opposite occurs in the CACO-AP experiment; (ii) The choice of the recycle delay: the amount of initial magnetization depends on the progressive saturation of the excited nucleus, this will affect CACO and COCA spectra at different extents.\nIn order to discuss how the signal intensity in the two experiments is modulated by the geometry of the ligands, we\n(1)ICOCA = [( 1 \u2212 e(\u2212R C\ufffd 1 (RD+t 2 )) )][ e(\u2212R C\ufffd 2 2\u0394)e(\u2212R C 2 t 2) ]\n(2)ICACO = [( 1 \u2212 e(\u2212R C 1 (RD+t 2 )) )][ e(\u2212R C 2 2\u0394)e(\u2212R C\ufffd 2 t 2) ]\n1 3\nmaintained a 5.4\u00a0ms 2\u2206 constant time for the indirect dimension and measured the experimental intensity ratios, ICACO/ ICOCA, at different acquisition times t2, as reported in Fig.\u00a06B. When t2 is only 10\u00a0ms, the four cysteines have a similar behaviour, with CACO experiment being about 40% more sensitive than COCA. The increase of the evolution period t2 affects the ICACO/ICOCA ratio at different extents: for Cys 22, Cys 25 and Cys 34, the ratio increases at longer t2 values while an opposite trend is observed for Cys 47. According to Eqs. (1, 2) and keeping constant the recycle delay, the slopes experimentally obtained depend on the difference between R2C\u03b1 and R2C\u2019: Cys 22, Cys 25 and Cys 34 have a positive value of \u2206R2C\u03b1\u2212C\u2019, while for Cys 47 the \u2206R2C\u03b1\u2212C\u2019 is negligible or negative. There is a correlation between this finding and the metal-to-carbon distances observed in the NMR structure of PioC (Trindade et\u00a0al. 2021c): the orientation of Cys 47 is such that C\u2019 and C\u03b1 are at similar distances from the closest iron ion and in particular the C\u2019 atom is only 4.1 \u212b from the iron ion. For Cys 22, 25 and 34 the topologies are different, with significantly larger Fe\u2013C\u2019 distances, \u2265 4.9 \u212b (Fig.\u00a06C). We may speculate that, in the case of Cys 47,\nboth C\u03b1 and C\u2019 relaxation rates are dominated by the paramagnetic contributions (Querci et\u00a0al. 2023), and additional contributions to relaxation may result in negative values of \u2206R2C\u03b1\u2212C\u2019. In the other cases, C\u2019 is too far from the Fe ion electron-nucleus dipolar relaxation significantly affect only the C\u03b1 nuclei. The consequence is that the C\u2019yC\u03b1z coherence, acquired during t2 in a CACO experiment, relaxes much slower than the C\u03b1yC\u2019z. CACO is therefore the best experiment to observe the C\u03b1/C\u2019 connectivities of Cys 22, Cys 25 and Cys 34 whereas for Cys 47 the two experiments have the same sensitivity suggesting that, as a general strategy in paramagnetic systems, COCA should be used as a complementary experiment in order to observe C\u03b1/C\u2019 peaks that might escape detection in CACO."

            "text": "A complete, multinuclear NMR assignment provides unique site specific information which are essential to study conformational changes and intermolecular\n1 3\ninteractions. In metalloproteins, the development of experimental approaches to recover the NMR information in the proximity of a paramagnetic center represents a relevant topic, rejuvenated also in the last years by the extensive use of paramagnetic probes to obtain structural information from paramagnetic NMR (Su and Chen 2019; Dasgupta et\u00a0al. 2021; Parigi et\u00a0al. 2023; Ravera et\u00a0al. 2022; Clore and Iwahara 2009; Clore 2015; Ott et\u00a0al. 2021; Abelein et\u00a0al. 2022; Zambelli et\u00a0al. 2023).\nWe have analyzed here the performances of HCACO, CACO and COCA, three well known experiments, part of a very successful battery of 13C detected experiments (Felli and Pierattelli 2022). We have discussed the relevant modifications needed to adapt these experiments to study site-specific, fast relaxing systems. We also provided examples on how these experiments contribute to improve the available assignments and, therefore, to map the proximity of a metal center. Different coherence transfer pathways call into the scene specific relaxation mechanisms, this should be taken into account for the selection of the experiments to be performed. Apparently redundant experiments, such as CACO and COCA, do contain complementary information which can eventually be converted into structural information.\nIn the case of PioC, we have corrected the assignment of cluster bound cysteine residues and shown that, even when extended assignment and NMR structure are available, these experiments provide additional information and structural constraints. In the case of CISD3, the optimization of HCACO to paramagnetic system provides a 30% increase of the observed C\u03b1/C\u2019 signals, a further similar improvement is obtained when the 1H start experiment is replaced by the 13C start CACO experiment. HCACO and CACO-AP are complementary and reduce the blind sphere around the [Fe2S2]+ cluster from ca 9 to 6\u00a0\u00c5.\nThese experiments are important in the frame of nonsystematic sequence-specific assignment strategies: within tailored NMR experiments, the identification of a signal is related to the distance of these spins from the paramagnetic center. This is applicable in all paramagnetic metalloproteins; indeed the only relevant variable is the range of metal to proton distance where conventional NMR experiments do not work properly and complementary experiments must be designed. The information obtained are important to study the interaction of paramagnetic metalloproteins with small ligand molecules (Zuo et\u00a0al. 2023) and protein partners, particularly for CISD3 and its homologues (Ferecatu et\u00a0al. 2014; Karmi et\u00a0al. 2022).\nFig. 6 A COCA-AP (left-half) and CACO-AP (right-half) spectra. B ICACO/ICOCA peak intensity ratios related to increasing acquisition time in the direct dimension of the spectrum (t2). Peak intensities have been calculated by performing the experiments using a 46\u00a0 ms acquisition time in the direct dimension and then considering for FT a smaller number of effective data points.

Both spectrometers were equipped with a TXO probe head optimised for 13C carbon direct detection. Experiments were collected at 298\u00a0K.\n13C\u2011HCACO and\u00a0CACO\u2011AP acquired on\u00a0CISD3 protein\nThe standard HCACO (Duma et\u00a0al. 2003; Bermel et\u00a0al. 2005b) used a recycle delay of 1\u00a0s, acquisition time t2 of 92\u00a0ms and a H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT transfer period of 3.6\u00a0ms. A 1024 \u00d7 660 data point matrix was acquired, with 32 transients for each increment and a spectral width of 31\u00a0ppm and 44\u00a0ppm for direct (F2) and indirect (F1) dimensions. For paramagnetic optimized HCACO, the experiment was recorded shortening the H\u03b1\u2013 to \u2013C\u03b1 INEPT transfer period to 1.4\u00a0ms. The acquisition time of the direct dimension, t2, was shortened to 46\u00a0ms and a recycle delay of 400\u00a0ms was used together with 1024 scans. A data matrix of 512 \u00d7 50 point was collected, with a spectral width of 31\u00a0ppm and 44\u00a0ppm for F2 and F1 dimensions. The CACO-AP (Bertini et\u00a0al. 2005a) was recorded with 300\u00a0ms of recycle delay and with a acquisition time of 24.5\u00a0ms. The C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 INEPT transfer delay was shortened to 5.4\u00a0ms instead of 9\u00a0ms. The collected data matrix was 512 \u00d7 70 with 1024 scans for each increment, with a spectral width of 59\u00a0ppm and 60\u00a0ppm for F2 and F1 dimensions. C\u03b1 carrier was set to 46\u00a0ppm for the standard HCACO experiment and to 53.2\u00a0ppm for the paramagnetic optimized HCACO and CACO-AP. All the experiments were recorded using waltz65 and garp4 decoupling scheme for 1H and 15N decoupling, respectively. Smoothed square shape for all gradients was used. Q5 and Q3-shaped pulses, with a duration of 300\u00a0\u03bcs and 231\u00a0\u03bcs respectively (Emsley and Bodenhausen 1992), were used for 13C band-selective \u03c0/2\nand \u03c0 flip angle pulses. Except for HCACO experiments, acquired with the IPAP scheme for virtual decoupling of C\u03b1zC\u2019y component of the magnetization, CACO-AP was processed as pseudo-absorbed signals in the direct dimension, as reported elsewhere (Bertini et\u00a0al. 2005a). Before Fourier transformation, a square sine weighting function, shifted by 90\u00b0, was applied in both dimensions to all the spectra. The evaluation of signal intensity was performed considering the volume of each cross-peak in the spectra (Mori et\u00a0al. 2008), obtained through an integral operation using Computed-Automated NMR Assignment (CARA) software (Keller 2004).\n13C\u2011HCACO, CACO\u2011AP and\u00a0COCA\u2011AP acquired on\u00a0PioC protein\nOptimized HCACO-AP was acquired with recycle delay of 250\u00a0 ms, acquisition time of 46\u00a0 ms and an H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT transfer delay of 1.4\u00a0ms. The total data matrix for the experiment was 512 \u00d7 128 point, with 1024 transients for each increment and a spectral width of 31 and 80\u00a0ppm for F2 and F1 dimensions. A further optimized HCACO-AP was acquired with a data matrix of 512 \u00d7 100, with 7168 scans for each increment, and a H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT transfer delay of 1\u00a0ms. The recycle delay and acquisition time for the experiment were 250\u00a0ms and 46\u00a0ms, respectively. The spectral width for F2 and F1 dimensions were 21\u00a0ppm and 64\u00a0ppm, respectively. CACO-AP and COCA-AP experiments were recorded both with recycle delay, acquisition time and C\u03b1-to-C\u2019 INEPT transfer delay of 500\u00a0ms, 47\u00a0ms and 5.4\u00a0ms, respectively. A data matrix of 2048 \u00d7 120 points, with 128 transients for each increment, was collected and a spectral width of 123\u00a0ppm and 64\u00a0ppm for direct and indirect dimensions has been used. The H(CA)CO-AP experiment was acquired with recycle delay, acquisition time and H\u03b1-to-C\u03b1 INEPT transfer delay of 250\u00a0ms, 46\u00a0ms and 1.4\u00a0ms. A data matrix of 512 \u00d7 220 point was collected, with 512 transients for each increment. The spectral width for direct and indirect dimension were 31\u00a0ppm, 64\u00a0ppm and 11\u00a0ppm, respectively. Shaped pulses, 1H and 15N decoupling, processing parameters were as described above. The optimization of HCACO experiment was monitored at 28.2\u00a0T, using a series of experiments, recorded with the same acquisition parameters. Experiments were recorded with 128\u00a0ns, 1\u00a0s recycle delay, 9.6\u00a0ms and 50\u00a0ms as t1 and t2 acquisition dimensions. Each experiment was 5\u00a0h. Throughout this series of experiments, 15N CPD was achieved using a p5m4sp180 decoupling scheme. An 8\u00a0ms, smoothed adiabatic chirp pulse with 8.4\u00a0kHz sweep width was used.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10858- 023- 00425-4.\n1 3\nAcknowledgements The support of the CERM/CIRMMP center of Instruct-ERIC is gratefully acknowledged.
