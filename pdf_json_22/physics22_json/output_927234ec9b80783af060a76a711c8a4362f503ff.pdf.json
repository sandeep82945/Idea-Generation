INTRODUCTION\nThe Peierls transition, which leads to charge density wave (CDW) [1,2] is one of the key phenomena caused by electron-phonon coupling [3,4] in condensed matter. It is induced by the so-called \u201cnesting\u201d feature of electron Fermi surfaces (FS), where two sections of the FS are connected by a single wave vector Q. The longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon mode with wave vector Q is strongly coupled to electron-hole excitation between different sections of the FS by electron-phonon coupling, which leads to singular response at the low temperature and causes \u201ccondensation\u201d of that particular phonon mode. The Peierls transition to CDW usually happens in 1D materials like polyacetylene, where energy bands disperse along the chain direction and a LA phonon with Q \u00bc 2kF connecting two Fermi points condenses at low temperature. Another very different system that shares a similar Peierls picture is a 3D semimetal material [5] under a strong magnetic field, where the electronic states are fully quantized to be Landau levels within the perpendicular plane and only disperse along the field direction. In the quantum limit, the Fermi level only crosses a single Landau band, which also\nsatisfies the perfect nesting condition and leads to CDW. Comparing to 1D or quasi-1D materials, here the physics leading to completely flat band behavior along the perpendicular directions is not the lack of overlap between the neighboring electron wave functions but the Landau quantization. As a consequence, such a system has intrinsic 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) [6,7] after CDW transition, which is quite different from the simple stacking of 2D quantum Hall layers [8], because the Landau level spacing is overwhelmed by band dispersion in the former cases and 3D QHE only appears after an energy gap is open by interactions. Such a theoretical proposal of potential 3D QHE associated with CDW has been suggested for over three decades before it was finally observed in Dirac material ZrTe5 [9,10]. Comparing to QHE in 2D, much fruitful new physics\nwill emerge in its 3D version. The most obvious difference is that 3D QHE is a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase under a strong magnetic field, which leads to new collective dynamics originated from dynamics of the order parameters. For incommensurate CDW, which is the case in 3D QHE with generic field strength, such collective modes are the \u201cphason\u201d modes along the field direction. How the sliding motion of CDW induced by the phason modes couples with the quantum Hall physics will be an interesting problem to explore. The CDW and Peierls transition discussed so far in the 1D metal and 3D Landau band systems are both caused by the condensation of LA phonon modes. What about the transverse acoustic (TA) phonon mode?

These are key questions to be answered in the present paper. The results from our study reveal a completely different type of density wave instability associated with condensation of the TA phonon mode. Similar to the electromagnetic wave, a TA wave is also a type of vector wave, which can carry angular momentum. Along some high-symmetry directions, conservation of total angular momentum jz\u210f will lead to \u201cselection rules\u201d in the electron-TA phonon coupling, which is the analog of optical selection rules. Interestingly, depending on the detailed features of the low-energy electronic structure, the density waves caused by condensation of the TA phonons can be either linearly, elliptically, or circularly polarized, which are also similar to the light. The corresponding linearly polarized density wave is a unique type of shear strain with periodical modulation, and the circularly polarized density wave can be viewed as self-twisting of the crystal along the external field direction. As we introduce in detail below, in the present work we\nhave found two types of topological semimetals (TSMs) to realize the linearly and circularly polarized TA phonon condensation under magnetic field, respectively. One class is a Dirac semimetal with Dirac points being located along the high-symmetry axis. Because of the existence of inversion symmetry, the stable density wave in this case is the \u201cshear strain wave\u201d caused by linearly polarized TA phonon condensation. The chiral TA phonon condensation may happen in another noncentrosymmetric system, Kramers-Weyl semimetal, which is found to be a perfect type of material to form a \u201cself-twisting wave\u201d with the appearance of 3D QHE as its by-product."

Under the magnetic field, in-plane motions of 3D electrons are fully quantized to form Landau levels and these \u201cLandau bands\u201d only disperse along z direction. In the long wavelength limit, discrete rotation symmetry in crystals can be approximated to be continuous and the total angular momentum jz\u210f is conserved, which contains orbital part lez\u210f \u00bc \u00f0m \u2212 n\u00de\u210f [11] carried by the Landau level wave functions jn;mi (n is Landau level index and m the subindex) and internal part sz\u210f (which is called \u201cspin\u201d here) inherited from the k \u00b7 p model. Thus, all electronic states are uniquely labeled as c\u0302\u2020nmkz hereafter. Note that the effect of the direct coupling between charged ions and magnetic field is weak enough to be ignored (see Appendix A). Assuming that both the rotation and translation symmetries are along the z axis, on a linearly polarized basis, the canonical coordinates of the TA phonon modes can be expressed as X\u0302 qz \u00bc \u00f0X\u0302xqz iX\u0302yqz\u00de= ffiffiffi 2 p , which carry the orbital angular momenta \u210f. In the cases of TSMs with both electron-phonon coupling and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), spin sz, electron orbital lez , and phonon orbital lphz angular momenta are all coupled. However, n index is fixed in the quantum limit, andm is conserved. Thus, in our system, only sz and l ph z are coupled (see Appendix B). As a result, three selection rules are enforced to electron-phonon coupling due to translation T\u0302z and rotation C\u0302z symmetries:\nsz \u00bc s0z \u00fe lphz;\u03bb; m \u00bc m0; kz \u00bc k0z \u00fe qz: \u00f02\u00de\nIt is worth noting that, different from the real transition process, here we focus on the virtual process caused by electron-phonon coupling where the conservation of energy is unnecessary.

To be specific, a minimum nontrivial model with only two Landau bands is considered. Since these two bands (labeled by \u03b1, \u03b2) of our interest will hold the same n index, we drop it hereafter to lighten the notation.

            "text": "The first class of materials considered in the present study is Dirac semimetal, such as Na3Bi [15\u201318], in which a pair of Dirac points located at kz axis are protected by time reversal symmetry (TRS) T\u0302 , inversion symmetry P\u0302, and rotation symmetry C\u0302nz (n \u00bc 3 for Na3Bi), as shown in Fig. 1(a). Near \u0393 point, the effective Hamiltonian reads HDk \u00bc \u00f0mzk2z \u00fem\u22a5k\u00fek\u2212 \u2212m0\u00de\u03c4z\u03c30 \u00fe \u210fv\u22a5\u00f0\u03c4x\u03c3z \u2212 \u03c4y\u03c30\u00de \u2212 \u03bc on basis \u03a8\u0302D\u2020k \u00bc \u00f0c\u0302\u20201=2k; c\u0302\u2020\u22121=2k; c\u0302\u20203=2k; c\u0302\u2020\u22123=2k\u00deT , where electron states are denoted as c\u0302\u2020szk. After the magnetic field is applied, the low-energy physics is dominated by two zeroth Landau bands with spin sz \u00bc 1=2 and \u22123=2 as shown in Fig. 1(b). The basis becomes c\u0302szmkz , and the effective magnetic Hamiltonian is HDkz \u00bc \u00f0mzk2z \u2212m0\u00de\u03c3z \u2212 \u03bc (see Appendix D 1). The FS contains four points (except \u03bc \u00bc 0), corresponding to states c\u0302\u2020sz; kF;sz . Three phonons with different wave vectors are possible to participate in FS nesting, two intervalley QDsz and one intravalley Q D T .\nEnforced by the selection rules Eq. (2), the LA phonon mode is only allowed to participate in two intervalley scattering processes (connecting two electronic states with the same sz) to form a CDW phase. Note that two different sz states connected by the intervalley scattering are either both electron type or both hole type and will not contribute\nto the electron-hole-type instability. In contrast, the intravalley scattering process involving electronic states with different sz can happen only when circularly polarized TA phonon modes (lphz \u2260 0) are considered. Depending on the electron-phonon coupling strength g\u03bb, the competition between LA and TA phonons results in different phases, which are described by the Hamiltonian Eq. (4). The condensation of the LA phonon mode leads to ordinary CDW order, which spontaneously breaks the translation symmetry only. The situation of the TA phonon is quite different. Similar to electromagnetic wave, a TA phonon mode X\u0302\u03bbqz has two polarizations, which can be expressed\non circularly polarized basis X\u0302 ;qz \u00bc \u00f0X\u0302x;qz iX\u0302y;qz\u00de= ffiffiffi 2 p . When a TA phonon mode connects two different FS sections of the zeroth Landau bands as illustrated in Fig. 1(b), it can also be softened or even condensed. After condensation, in the generic case the expectation value of the phonon operators with both polarizations will be nonzero. Interestingly, the condensation of the TA phonon modes can be either linearly, elliptically, or circularly polarized depending on the relative phase factor ei\u03d5xy \u00bc hX\u0302yi=hX\u0302xi between the order parameters of two orthogonal linearly polarized TA modes as summarized in Table I.

Unlike charge redistribution along the wave vector in LA phonon condensation, the condensation of linearly polarized TA phonon generates a shear strain with periodicity QDT instead, which is called a shear strain wave in our work. Based on the model parameters listed in Table II, the meanfield phase diagram is plotted in Fig. 1(c), in which CDW and shear strain wave phases are both possible to be stabilized in different regions of the parameter space. The key parameter determining the ground state is the ratio of coupling strength jgDT =gDz0j, which is the horizontal axis of Fig. 1(c). When it exceeds vph;DT =v ph;D z \u00bc ffiffiffi 3 p =3 at \u03bc \u00bc 0, the shear strain wave phase is more stable than the CDW phase. Note that, after the CDWor self-twisting wave phases have been stabilized, the Dirac semimetal becomes a trivial insulator rather than 3D QHE state because the energy gap is opened on the zeroth Landau bands. Another class is Kramers-Weyl semimetal such as\n\u03b2-Ag2Se [19,22,23], which is not centrosymmetric and circularly polarized TA phonons will not be suppressed by P\u0302. Unlike ordinary Weyl semimetals, the Weyl points in Kramers-Weyl semimetal are all pinned at the time reversal invariant momenta. For example, the band structure around \u0393 point is shown in Fig. 2(a). Assuming that the system contains a Cnz (n \u00bc 2 in \u03b2-Ag2Se) symmetry, its k \u00b7 p model near \u0393 point reads HKWk \u00bc\u00f0uzkz\u00feu\u22a5k2\u22a5\u00de\u03c30\u00fe \u00f0vzkz\u03c3z\u00fev\u22a5k\u22a5 \u00b7\u03c3\u22a5\u00de\u2212\u03bc on basis \u03a8\u0302KW\u2020k \u00bc\u00f0c\u0302\u20201=2k; c\u0302\u2020\u22121=2k\u00deT . Then in the quantum limit, the low-energy physics is dominated by two Landau bands with Landau band index\nn \u00bc 1 and spin sz \u00bc 1=2, as shown in Fig. 2(b) (see also Appendix D 2). To reach the nesting condition that the FS contains only\ntwo points, the Fermi level has to be placed inside the gap at the \u0393 point, which is generated by a rotational symmetry breaking term in addition to the magnetic field. Such a rotation symmetry breaking term can be generated by either the Zeeman effect of an additional in-plane magnetic field or some kinds of strain. Strictly speaking, the wave functions of different Landau bands are mixed by the symmetry breaking term and angular momentum is no long a good quantum number. However, such mixing of states with different angular momenta is only significant near the \u0393 point, while for states at the FS, the mixing effect is negligible and the angular momentum is still approximately conserved as well as the corresponding selection rule of electron-phonon coupling. Thus, in such a system the dominant instability happens for the circularly polarized TA phonons because of the selection rule. As a result, electron-phonon coupling will lead to self-twisting wave phase followed by the condensation of chiral TA phonon modes, as shown in Fig. 3(c).

            "text": "In this section, we discuss the possible exotic physical phenomena caused by the condensation or softening of the TA phonon modes. The first is the Goldstone mode in selftwisting wave phase. Similar to CDW phase where the sliding mode is a supercurrent of charge as a result of spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry, the chiral\nsliding mode in the incommensurate self-twisting wave phase is a supercurrent of angular momentum instead. Also, the new ground state will be a perfect chiral crystal, where the chiral phonon is discussed in recent works in the context of chiral [24], nonsymmorphic [25], and twodimensional [26] materials. More interesting effects are from acoustical activity [27\u201329]. To analyze frequency renormalization, the leading order of phonon self-energy is considered (Appendix E),\n\u0394\u03c92\u03bbqz \u00bc \u00f0\u03c9ren\u03bbqz\u00de2 \u2212 \u03c92\u03bbqz \u00bc \u00f0gTqz\u00de2 M L\u03bbqz\u00f0\u03c9ren\u03bbqz\u00de;\nL\u03bbqz \u00bc 1\nN X \u03b1\u03b2mkz \u00f0f\u03b1kz\u00feqz \u2212 f\u03b2kz\u00de\u03b4\u00f0s\u03b1z \u2212 s\u03b2z \u2212 lphz;\u03bb\u00de \u03b5\u03b1kz\u00feqz \u2212 \u03b5\u03b2kz \u2212 \u210f\u00f0\u03c9\u00fe i\u03b7\u00de ; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere L\u03bbqz is the Lindhard response function with f\u03b1kz \u2261 f\u00f0\u03b5\u03b1kz\u00de being Fermi-Dirac distribution. At low temperature T < \u03b4T=kB, where the gap will not be smeared out by thermal fluctuation, the TA phonon frequencies at long wavelength regime are almost unscreened and quasidegenerate, while two different branches of chiral phonons deviate hugely near wave vector QT. The effective dispersion of the left-handed phonon branch near QT is \u03c9\u00f0 QT \u00de\u03b4qz \u00bc \u03c9QT \u00fe b\u00f0\u03b4qz\u00de2=2with\u03c9QT \u221d\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\u00f0T \u2212 Tc\u00de=Tcp [2] before phase transition happens (T higher than critical temperature Tc), and b \u00bc 8.71 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2=s is fitted at T \u00bc 1.1 K. Thus, the system is a gyromagnetic medium with acoustical activity, in which the group speed of the right-handed phonon branch is still vphT , and that of the left-handed chiral waves is renormalized to v\u00f0 QT \u00de\u03b4qz \u00bc \u2202\u03c9\u00f0 QT\u00de\u03b4qz =\u2202\u00f0\u03b4qz\u00de \u00bc b\u03b4qz, as shown in Fig. 3(a). After the degeneracy of TA phonon modes is lifted\nby electron-phonon coupling, a series of magnetoacoustic effects immediately follow, such as Faraday, Kerr, Cotton-Mouton, or Voigt effects [29,30]. As examples, here we discuss Faraday rotation and Kerr ellipticity as results of magnetoacoustic circular birefringence, which are also found in \u03b1 quartz [31,32] and superfluid 3He-B [33,34]. Consider a setup inwhich thegyromagnetic acoustic medium is surrounded by a normal medium such as chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) with shear acoustic wave speed 1060m/s. In the polar configuration, if a linearly polarized TAwavewith frequency\u03c9 > \u03c9QT travels from the CPVC side to the gyromagnetic medium, the reflected wave from the interface will become elliptical, while the polarization plane of refracted wave in the gyromagnetic medium will gradually rotate, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Under external magnetic induction Bz \u00bc 10 T at T\u00bc1.1K, for acoustic wave with frequency \u03c9\u00bc58.0GHz, a significant Kerr ellipticity \u03f5K \u00bc 0.41, and a giant Faraday angle per distance 1.77 \u00d7 105 rad=cm (see Appendix G) are estimated to be measured. Other typical effects, such as Faraday ellipticity\n011027-5\nand Kerr rotation induced by magnetoacoustic circular dichroism, can also be observed. Another easily observed signature of magnetoacoustic circular refringence is resonant frequency of chiral standing acoustic wave, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Given a system at T1 \u00bc 1.1 K with length d \u00bc 1 cm along the z axis, the resonant frequencies of the left-handed chiral modes with wave vector around QT are \u03c9QT \u00fe \u0394\u03c9\u00f0QT\u00den \u00bc 56.1 GHz\u00fe 0.086\u00f0n\u00fe 1=2\u00de kHz and of the normal long wavelength standing modes are \u03c9\u00f00\u00den \u00bc \u00f0268n\u00de kHz (see Appendix F). Because the electronic screening leads to the frequency local minimum \u03c9QT \u221d\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\u00f0T \u2212 Tc\u00de=Tcp [2], a tiny temperature change will lead to a significant lowering of fundamental mode frequency of the chiral standing waves as well as an increase of frequency differences. For example, \u03c9QT will decrease to 48.1 GHz and \u0394\u03c9 \u00f0QT \u00de n increase to 0.097\u00f0n\u00fe 1=2\u00de kHz if the system is cooled down to T \u00bc 1.08 K. Similar temperature sensitive behaviors of resonances can also be observed in shear strain wave phase of Dirac semimetal, while the standing modes are not chiral but linearly polarized. In the end, we would also mention the chiral phonon correction to the Einstein\u2013de Hass effect. When electronphonon coupling is turned off and the direct coupling of ions to magnetic field is neglected, TRS will pair two phonons with opposite angular momenta as T\u0302 X\u0302\u00fe;qT\u0302\n\u22121 \u00bc X\u0302\u2212;\u2212q, resulting in a zero net phonon angular momenta, which is one of the premises in the original proposal of the Einstein\u2013de Hass effect [35]. However, the TRS of the TA phonon subsystem is broken mediated by the electron-phonon coupling. As a result, the nonzero net phonon angular momentum has to be included in the conservation law of total angular momentum and will lead to an observable correction to the Einstein-de Hass effect. This correction is also investigated in the work of Zhang and Niu [36] where they discussed spin-phonon coupling. For \u03b2-Ag2Se under external magnetic field B \u00bc 5 T at temperature T \u00bc 15.7 K, the net phonon angular momentum per unit cell is estimated to be 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123\u210f (see Appendix I)."

            "text": "The interaction between electron and TA phonon mode has been overlooked for decades. In this article, we have proposed two kinds of exotic condensation of TA phonon modes, shear strain wave and self-density wave, induced by electron-TA phonon coupling in specific TSMs under magnetic field. We find that when a strong enough magnetic field is applied along the rotational axis of Dirac and Kramers-Weyl semimetal materials, the low-energy electronic states can be described by their zeroth or lowest Landau bands with different internal angular momentum sz\u210f. The presence of rotational symmetry enforces important selection rules to electron-phonon coupling terms for both LA and TA phonons. The combination of FS nesting and the selection rules of electron-phonon coupling induce two exotic new density wave states. The linearly polarized TA phonon condensation leads to a shear strain wave state while circularly polarized TA phonon condensation gives us a selftwisting state. The self-twisting phase is a typical chiral matter, which can lead to a number of new physical effects including chiral sliding mode, chiral standing wave, magnetoacoustic effects, and chiral phonon correction to the Eistein\u2013de Hass effect."

Taking the\nunperturbed frequency \u03c9T as a reference, the order of magnitude of shifting and splitting are around j\u03c9\u0303T \u2212 \u03c9T j= \u03c9T \u2248 10\u221210 and \u0394\u03c9T=\u03c9T \u2248 10\u22125 given jLzj \u00bc \u210f. Therefore, it is sensible to ignore both of these effects and treat phonons as neutral particles when we investigate electronphonon coupling."

In this work, we only consider electron-phonon coupling up to the zeroth order of k, so H\u0302epk is ignored in the following. Note that, if we are interested in Hamiltonian up to first order of q, treating strain tensor \u03b5 as a classical quantity during all the derivations then quantizing it at the very end in Eq. (C11) will obtain the same result. Because we focus on phonons with well-defined angular momenta along z direction, i.e., nonzero components are \u03b5\u0302iz (i \u00bc x, y, z), we only need to concern V\u0302iz terms and the others have no contributions to electron-phonon coupling. Keeping these nonzero coefficients in mind, the spherical components are defined as\nV\u03020 \u00bc V\u0302zz; V\u0302 1 \u00bc 1\n2 \u00f0V\u0302xz iV\u0302yz\u00de; V\u0302 2 \u00bc 0: \u00f0C12\u00de\nAs followed, we rewrite the electron-phonon coupling in terms of these symmetric components,\nH\u0302ep \u00bc \u03b5\u0302zzV\u0302zz \u00fe \u03b5\u0302\u00fe;zV\u0302\u22121 \u00fe \u03b5\u0302\u2212;zV\u0302\u00fe1; \u00f0C13\u00de\nwhere \u03b5\u0302 ;z \u00bc \u03b5\u0302x;z i\u03b5\u0302y;z.

Note that, in the case of jqj \u00bc 0, three acoustic normal modes correspond to global translations of the crystal, of which the displacement amplitude is not defined and such translations will not alter the electronic band structure. Therefore, it is assumed that these modes are skipped throughout this article. Considering that g0\u03c30 term means the coupling strengths between LA phonon and electrons while gz\u03c3z term controls the strength difference of coupling to two bands, either one is enough to introduce a CDW gap. Hence, we simply set g0 \u00bc 0 in the numerical calculations to reduce complications. To make the physical meaning of electron-phonon\ncoupling clearer, we rewrite the above electron-phonon coupling Gmkz\u03bbqz on the linearly polarized basis:\nX \u03bb\u00bc Gmkz\u03bbqz X\u0302\u03bbqz=\u03be\u03bbqz \u00bc iqz 0 g\u2212\u00f0X\u0302xqz \u2212 iX\u0302yqz\u00de g\u00fe\u00f0X\u0302xqz \u00fe iX\u0302yqz\u00de 0\n\u00bc iqz 0 \u00f0g1 \u2212 ig2\u00de\u00f0X\u0302xqz \u2212 iX\u0302yqz\u00de \u00f0g1 \u00fe ig2\u00de\u00f0X\u0302xqz \u00fe iX\u0302yqz\u00de 0 \u2261 iqz\u00f0g1X\u0302Tqz \u00b7 \u03c3T \u00fe g2X\u0302Tqz \u00d7 \u03c3T\u00de; \u00f0C18\u00de\nwhere g1 \u00bc \u00f0g\u2212 \u00fe g\u00fe\u00de=2, g2 \u00bc i\u00f0g\u2212 \u2212 g\u00fe\u00de=2, X\u0302Tqz \u00bc \u00f0X\u0302xqx ; X\u0302yqz\u00de, and \u03c3T \u00bc \u00f0\u03c3x; \u03c3y\u00de. These are exactly two possible forms of interactions between two vector operators: TA phonon normal coordinate and electron spin.

            "text": "In optics, according to the relative configuration of incident light and magnetic materials, there are three types of magneto-optical Kerr effects: polar, longitudinal, and transverse. Similarly, we also have three configurations in the acoustical counterpart. For simplicity, here we only take the polar configuration near normal incidence as an example since it has larger effect than the other two. The reflection coefficients for two chiral acoustic waves are obtained through Fresnel relations:\nr\u00fe \u00bc 1 \u2212 n\u00fe=nT1\u00fe n\u00fe=nT \u00bc 0.262; r\u2212 \u00bc 1 \u2212 n\u2212=nT1\u00fe n\u2212=nT\n\u00bc 0.109; \u00f0G3\u00de\nwhere we used n\u2212=nT \u00bc vph;CPVCT =vph;KWT \u00bc 1060=852 \u00bc 1.244 and n\u00fe=nT \u00bcvph;CPVCs =vph;KW\u00fe \u00bc1060=1811\u00bc0.585. The left-handed TA wave will be completely incident into the gyromagnetic material, while a proportion of the right-hand rotating wave can reflect with nonzero reflection coefficient r\u00fe.

            "text": "CACULATIONS OF Na3Bi\nAll calculations were performed using density-functional theory (DFT) and density-functional perturbation theory, pseudopotentials, and plane waves basis sets as implemented in the QUANTUM EXPRESSO suite [37,38]. We employed the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional [39], optimized norm-conserving pseudopotentials [40] from the PSEUDO-DOJO library [41] for total energy and lattice dynamics calculations, and the plane\n011027-14\nwaves kinetic energy cutoffs are set to achieve 1 meV accuracy as recommended in these libraries. The convergence criterion for the ionic steps was that the forces on every ion were less than 0.01 eV=\u00c5. The crystallographic data for Na3Bi are listed in Table IV [16,42]. We used a \u0393-centered 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 4 k-point grid. Two well-known Dirac points near the Fermi level lie at the \u0393-A axis, as shown in Figs. 7(b) and 7(c). The phonon calculation employs a \u0393-centered 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 q-point grid and its convergence threshold needs to be refined to 10\u221216\n(in atomic unit) to achieve convergence after many tests. Along the \u0393-A direction, all acoustic phonon modes are almost linear and two TA phonon modes are degenerate as shown in Fig. 7(d), which well satisfies our assumption for the speeds of acoustic phonons in the main text. The phonon self-energy based on electron-phonon\ncoupling g matrix is computed by using the software package EPW [43]. In Fig. 7(e), we plot the coupling strength between valance and conductance bands with TA and LA phonon modes at two specific phonon wave vectors: long wavelength limit Q \u00bc 0.06 and finite wave vector Q \u00bc 0.31 connecting two Dirac cones. First, the magnitude of jgj is around 0.2\u20131.0 eV, which justifies our parameter 0.5 eV used in the model. Along the \u0393-A direction, the speed of TA phonon vphT is around half of a LA phonon vphL , as shown in Fig. 7(d). According to our analysis of Na3Bi in the main text, the shear strain wave is favored when jgDT =gDL j > vphT =vphL \u2248 0.5. And the electronTAphonon coupling strength jgDT j is similar and even stronger than electron-LA phonon coupling jgDL j. Therefore, it is promising to predict that shear strain wave phase could be the ground state of Na3Bi at zero temperature.\nAPPENDIX I: ESTIMATION OF CORRECTION TO EINSTEIN\u2013DE HASS EFFECT\nWith external magnetic field B \u00bc 5 T, the rotation symmetry breaking term \u03b4T \u00bc 0.2 meV, the renormalized phonon dispersion, and density of state (DOS) of each chiral acoustic phonon mode are as shown in Fig. 8(b).\n011027-15\nInherited from sensitivity of phonon dispersion to temperatures, the net phonon angular momentum is also quite sensitive. At three different temperatures, 15.65, 15.7, and 15.8 K, the net phonon angular momentum per unit cell is \u22122.7 \u00d7 10\u22123\u210f, \u22121.5 \u00d7 10\u22123\u210f, and \u22121.47 \u00d7 10\u22124\u210f, respectively. They are close, in the order of magnitude, to the estimation of paramagnetic materials CeF3 and Tb3Ga5O12 in the literature [36].\n[1] G. Gr\u00fcner, The Dynamics of Charge-Density Waves, Rev. Mod.
