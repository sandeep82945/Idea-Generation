1. **Investigating the impact of different bidding strategies on market efficiency and security.** The paper assumes that consumers bid linear functions of their flexibility, but other bidding strategies could be explored, such as quadratic or piecewise linear functions. It would be interesting to see how these different strategies affect the market outcomes.
2. **Developing a more sophisticated algorithm for finding the v-GNE of the game.** The algorithm proposed in the paper is a simple gradient-based algorithm, but there may be more efficient or effective algorithms that could be developed.
3. **Extending the model to include other types of flexibility resources.** The paper only considers flexibility from dispatchable generators and adjustable loads, but other types of flexibility resources, such as energy storage systems and demand response programs, could also be included in the model.
4. **Investigating the impact of market power on market outcomes.** The paper assumes that all consumers are small and have no market power, but in practice, some consumers may have more market power than others. It would be interesting to see how market power affects the market outcomes.
5. **Developing a real-time implementation of the proposed market mechanism.** The paper presents a theoretical framework for a market mechanism, but it would be necessary to develop a real-time implementation of the mechanism in order to test its effectiveness in practice.
