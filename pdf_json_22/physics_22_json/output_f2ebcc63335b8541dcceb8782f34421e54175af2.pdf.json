Their optical response have been previously modelled by a purely bidimensional surface current or by a very thin film with some contradictory results. The advent of multilayer stacks of bidimensional materials and combinations of different materials in vertical van der Waals heterostructures highlights however that these materials have a finite thickness. In this article, we propose a new model that reconciles both approaches and we show how volume properties of stacked bidimensional layers can be calculated from the bidimensional response of each individual layer, and conversely. In our approach, each bidimensionnal layers is surrounded by vacuum and described as a kind of transfer matrix with intrinsic parameters that do not depend on the external medium. This provides a link between continuous thin films and discrete layers. We show how to model heterostructures of bidimensional materials and identify the parameters of the current sheet that represents the bidimensional material in the zero-thickness limit, namely the in-plane surface susceptibility and the out-of-plane displacement susceptibility. We show that our unified model is perfectly compatible with existing ellipsometric data with the same reliability as the existing interface model but with different values of the surface susceptibility or bulk dielectric function. We discuss in details the origin of the discrepancies and show that our approach allows to determine intrinsic properties of the bidimensional materials with the advantage that multilayer and monolayer systems are described in a same framework.",

INTRODUCTION\nFollowing the important impact of 2D materials in different domains of applications such as electronics, photonics, biomedical engineering, printing technology and aerospace [1], multilayer systems are progressively developing. They include vertical van der Waals heterostructures [2, 3] and could be used to increase the total layer response [4\u20137], study the interaction between layers [4], protect against electromagnetic microwave pollution [8], or to devise new materials combining their properties by stacking them together.\nOptical properties of single- and multilayer systems can be used to probe the number of layers [9, 10] or to investigate the evolution of the refractive and conductive properties with the number of layers [4\u20137, 11]. In waveguiding optics, 2D materials or multilayer systems are useful for functionalization [12], modulation [13, 14] or to enhance the nonlinear properties [15\u201318].\nWith their atomic thickness, 2D materials can be described either by surface currents at an interface or as ultrathin films of continuous materials. This is depicted on Fig. 1 that presents three approaches: (I) the surface current or interface; (II) the thin film; and (III)-(IV) our new anisotropic layer model in continuous and discrete versions. Up to now, the surface current and thin-film descriptions have been used in parallel, raising questions about which model is\n\u2217Electronic address: Pascal.Kockaert@ulb.ac.be\nmore physically sound and why they differ on their predictions [19].\nA first attempt to merge the two models in a single picture was provided by Maj\u00e9rus et al. in [20] within an Anisotropic Interface Model (AnisInt model), where the importance of the anisotropy of the thin-film model and of the out-of-plane component of the surface susceptibility was pointed out. In a very nice experimental work [21], Xu and co-workers highlighted the importance of the outof-plane component to interpret the measurements. More recently, Dell\u2019Anna showed how to model this out-of-plane response from a microscopic dipolar point of view in a Microscopic Dipolar Model (MicroDip model) [22]. Although the works in [20] and [21] present similarities, they do not provide the same analytical expressions for the reflection coefficient, and the first of these models is not purely conservative for a lossless 2D material immersed in a lossless medium as pointed out by [21]. Another major drawback of both approaches is that they do not provide intrinsic electromagnetic response quantities, independently of the surrounding medium. More over, while these two works describe the impact of a 2D material at the interface between two continuous bulk media, they do not provide a clear way to extend the models to multilayer systems. Tab. I summarizes the main characteristics of the different models that are depicted on Fig. 1. It shows that existing models, such as the AnisInt model and MicroDip model describe well the boundary conditions at an interface, but cannot be extended to the multilayer systems; while the Isotropic ThinFilm model (IsoFilm model) can describe multilayer systems but without anisotropy. ar X iv :2 20 7. 11 08 3v 2 [ ph\nys ic\ns. op\ntic s]\n7 N\nov 2\n02 2\nIn this work, we propose a new model that combines all the features mentioned above. Heterostructures made of successive stacking of several 2D layers are also described in the approach. These expressions will be cast on the convenient form of a transfer matrix that is very useful for theoretical descriptions or for applications like ellipsometry. In doing this, we will also show how the AnisInt model of Maj\u00e9rus [20] and the MicroDip model of Dell\u2019Anna [22] differ. Our model also identifies intrinsic parameters of a layer, i.e. parameters that do not depend on the surrounding media. This condition is mandatory for a general model but it was\nnot encountered previously. Our approach will be analytical in the first place and based on the description of a single sheet of 2D material: the Anisotropic Layer Model (AnisLay model). It will be compared with existing experimental results. We will show that the different proposed models can fit the experimental data quite well with, surprisingly, different conclusions on the deduced response functions (susceptibility and dielectric tensor). Our model is shown to be more general, as it is the only one that fits experimental results and describes a N-layer material as a (N-1)-layer material plus a single layer.\nOur analysis will be performed assuming that there is no change of the intrinsic parameters with the number of layers or the heterostructure stacking. We will on purpose ignore inter-layer effects as the charge transfer and the covalent bounding [4] that could lead to new physics related to the stacking order or orientation. This will allow to identify such interactions through the comparison of experimental data on multilayer systems with our optical model. Such effects of the interaction between bidimensional materials are however restricted close to the Fermi level and do not influence the electromagnetic properties in the near infrared and the visible.\nIn Section II, we introduce the existing interface 2D layer models. Then, in Sec. III, we present our new model, defined for a single anisotropic layer of 2D material and applied thereafter to an homogeneous multilayer system. After that, we relate the new model to the existing ones, showing how the new layer model leads to the existing interface model in the zero-thickness limit. In Sec. V, we apply the new model to build the response of a simple heterostructure and identify the parameters that should be used to describe 2D materials independently of the surrounding media. Then in Sec. VI, we show that our model is compatible with existing data on single-layer graphene and MoS2, with the same reliability as the previous models, but with the advantage that it makes use of intrinsic parameters. We extend our analysis to stacked 2D-layers in 10-layer and 100- layer structures of graphene and MoS2, and we highlight the importance of the choice of geometrical arrangement of the different layers to model as precisely as possible the real distribution of dipolar response in the structure. Finally, we summarize our main findings and conclude."

            "text": "Continuity conditions and translational invariance allow to calculate the evolution of an electromagnetic wave at a planar interface between homogeneous media. In particular, without surface currents, tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields are continuous, as well as normal components of the induction and displacement fields. This is not valid anymore in the presence of an interface 2D layer. Indeed, a surface polarization field orthogonal to the interface P\u22a5 appears in this case, as shown in [17, 20, 24] using a macroscopic model, and in [21, 22] using a microscopic dipolar approach involving reaction fields.\n3 This surface polarisation ~P is related to the electric field at the interface ~P by the surface polarisability tensor \u00af\u0304\u03c7s through ~P = \u03b50 \u00af\u0304\u03c7s~Es . In their microscopic approach Dell\u2019Anna et al. [22] consider the surface field equal to the transmitted electric field while in the continuum approach of [20] and [25], the average field of the incident and transmitted regions was used. This choice then influences the obtained value of \u03c7s that is then not intrinsic to the layer but depends also on the surrounding media. Note that others authors do not explicitly evaluate this field [17, 24].\nLater, in Sec. III, we consider the continuity of the displacement field by introducing the out-of-plane displacement susceptibility \u03bez , and its surface counterpart\n\u03besz = d \u03bez = d Pz Dz = d \u03b5z \u2212\u03b50 \u03b5z , (1)\nwith d the layer thickness, Pz , Dz and \u03b5z respectively the out-of-plane polarization field, displacement field, and permittivity. This resolves the arbitrary choice made in other approaches.\nHere below, we summarize results published in [20] and compare them to those reported in [22], as we will start from these results to build our new layer model. The geometry is depicted on Fig. 1(I). As detailed in [20], and summarized in appendix A, anisotropic boundary conditions at a 2-D interface between media a and b, on which a monochromatic plane wave is incident, write\n1\u2212 r t \u2212 1 t = i\u03d5ab t , (2)\n\u03b1ab + r t \u2212 1 t = i\u03c8ab t , (3)\nwhere the coefficients of transmission t and reflection r and the parameter \u03b1ab are defined differently for transverseelectric (TE, \u22a5) and transverse-magnetic (TM, \u2225) waves [see (A8) and (A11)]. To avoid coupling between TE and TM waves, we assume that the permittivity tensor is diagonal in the Ox y z reference frame (see Fig. 1). This condition is fulfilled by all bidimensional materials with a symmetry axis orthogonal to the 2D plane of order 3, 4 or 6, which includes graphene and MoS2. The complex phase shifts\u03d5ab and\u03c8ab are defined in appendix.\nA transfer matrix links the forward (F ) and backward (B) components of a plane wave, so that the components in the input medium (a) are obtained by multiplying the matrix of the system Ma\u2192b with the components at the output medium (b). (\nFa Ba\n) = 1\nt ( 1 \u2212r \u2032 r t t \u2032\u2212 r r \u2032 )( Fb Bb ) , (4)\nwhere r and t are the transmission and reflection coefficients appearing in (2) and (3), and their primed versions are calculated by swapping indices a and b.\nTransfer matrix coefficients are easy to calculate if we rewrite (2) and (3) as\n1 t = 1+\u03b1ab 2 \u2212 i\u03d5ab 2t \u2212 i\u03c8ab 2t , (5) r\nt = 1\u2212\u03b1ab 2 \u2212 i\u03d5ab 2t + i\u03c8ab 2t . (6)\nThis form is also very interesting to compare analytical predictions of different models, as they are usually provided in terms of r and t coefficients. In particular, when the 2D material is immersed in a single material \u03b1ab =\u03b1aa = 1,\nt = t \u2032 = 1+ i\u03d5aa 2 + i\u03c8aa 2 , (7) r = r \u2032 =\u2212i\u03d5aa 2 + i\u03c8aa 2 . (8)\nThese expressions can directly be compared to those of the MicroDip model [21]. Although these equations differ, they are the same at first order in \u03d5ab and \u03c8ab , if the surface polarisability is defined from the transmitted field in region b as ~P = \u03b50 \u00af\u0304\u03c7~Eb (see Suppl.

We will first define a layer and provide its transfer matrix expression. We will then use the concept of layer in the frame of a continuous medium and in the frame of a discrete medium, and we will show to which extent these two different visions are compatible, and provide an estimate of the precision required on phase measurements to distinguish between these two approaches."

As in Sec. II, we assume that this tensor is diagonal when written in the axes Ox y z. This layer includes interface matrices to model a homogeneous anisotropic material surrounded by vacuum. Denoting by Imn the usual interface matrix separating homogeneous media m and n and by Pm(d) the propagation matrix in medium m over a distance d , the layer matrix is\nLm(d)\n= IvmPm(d)Imv (9) = ( 1+\u03b1 2 1\u2212\u03b1 2\n1\u2212\u03b1 2 1+\u03b1 2\n)( e\u2212i\u03a6 0\n0 ei\u03a6\n)( \u03b1+1 2\u03b1 \u03b1\u22121 2\u03b1\n\u03b1\u22121 2\u03b1 \u03b1+1 2\u03b1\n) (10)\n4 = ( cos\u03a6\u2212 i 1+\u03b122\u03b1 sin\u03a6 i 1\u2212\u03b1 2 2\u03b1 sin\u03a6\n\u2212i 1\u2212\u03b122\u03b1 sin\u03a6 cos\u03a6+ i 1+\u03b1 2 2\u03b1 sin\u03a6\n) , (11)\nwhere we have defined \u03b1 = \u03b1vm = 1/\u03b1mv and written \u03a6 = kmz d the phase shift induced by the propagation. Detailed expressions for\u03b1mn and kmz are given in appendix, Eqs. (A8) and (A11).\nWe will show that the matrix of a layer of thickness d , seen as a continuous medium [Fig. 1(III)] is equivalent to the matrix of a zero-thickness current sheet surrounded by two vacuum layers of thickness d/2 [Fig. 1(IV)]. This explains the dual representation of the AnisLay model on Fig. 1.\nIt is important to notice that usual thin film models [Fig. 1(II)] differ from our definition of a layer as they consider a transfer matrix M f =IamPm(d)Imb . This prevents to combine different thin film matrices easily to form a multilayer by matrix multiplication.\nTo the contrary the layer matrices can be combined straightforwardly to make a thicker material as follows\nLm(d1)Lm(d2)\n= [IvmPm(d1)Imv ] [IvmPm(d2)Imv ] = IvmPm(d1 +d2)Imv (12) = Lm(d1 +d2), (13)\nas Imv = I\u22121vm and Pm(d1)Pm(d2) = Pm(d1 +d2). The matrix that we obtain has the same form as the initial layer matrices, but with a total thicknes dtot = d1 +d2.\nLayers with different permittivity tensors can also be combined. At the boundary, interface matrices of the two layers combine as\nImv Ivn =Imn , (14)\nto provide the usual interface matrix between m and n. The use of layer matrices with an interface to vacuum simplifies the analytical modelling, in particular because the vacuum is lossless and isotropic.\nWe have verified that layer matrices can be used quite efficiently to predict reflection and transmission at an interface, total internal reflection and Brewster\u2019s angle."

Considering an arbitrary number N of layers in the volume, we can write the volume matrix Vm depending on the thickness L = N d , as\nVm(N d) = [Lm(d)]N = [IvmPm(d)Imv ]N (12)= Lm(N d). (15)\nThe impact of layer N +1 is therefore given by\n\u03b4Vm \u03b4L = Vm(L+d)\u2212Vm(L) d = Lm(d)\u2212 I d Vm(L). (16)\nIf the medium is continuous, the thickness d of a layer is a continuously varying parameter. It can therefore be chosen arbitrarily small, which is equivalent to divide the continuous material in a very high number or layers. We can therefore consider the limit d \u2192 0, so that, using (10) and \u03a6= kmz d , (16) becomes\ndVm dL = lim d\u21920 \u03b4Vm \u03b4L = KmVm , (17)\nKm = ikmz Ivm ( \u22121 0 0 1 ) Imv , (18)\nas limd\u21920 ( exp(\u00b1ikmz d)\u22121 ) /d =\u00b1ikmz . The matrix Km contains all the information that is needed to build the volume layer. As it is obtained in the limit of small d , it can be calculated from (11) or from its first order Taylor expansion in d or\u03a6, showing that this first order expansion contains also all the physics of the system. In this limit,\nLm(d) = I +dKm . (19) This last expression is interesting as it can be computed either from the continuous medium approach, or from the complex phase jump conditions at the interface. Indeed, it was shown in [20] that to the first order in d the thin film model and the interface model coincide and then\nLm =IvmPm(d)Imv =Pv (d/2)Sv v Pv (d/2), (20) where the interface matrix with surface currents Sv v is built from the reflection and transmission coefficients in (5) and (6) using the matrix expression in (4), in the case where a and b correspond to vacuum. According to the AnisLay model in [20], equation (20) holds when\n\u03c7sx d = \u03b5 m x \u03b50 \u22121, (21) \u03c7sy\nd =\n\u03b5my \u03b50 \u22121, (22)\n\u03c7sz d = \u03b5 m z \u2212\u03b50 \u03b5mz (1)= \u03be s z d . (23)\nWe can therefore build Km in two different ways, using the two forms of (20). This provides a direct analytical link between the anisotropic volume layer in [Fig. 1(III)] and the\n5 surface layer [Fig. 1(IV)]. An important consequence of our definition of a layer, as a dipolar distribution surrounded by vacuum is that the parameters appearing in Km are independent from the effective surrounding media (a and b) on Fig. 1. This was not the case in the AnisInt model.\nAs a first step to our goal, which is to model heterogeneous stacked 2D materials, we will apply the approach of the previous section in the approximation of the homogeneous continuous volume, where d can be chosen arbitrarily small. In this limit, Eq. (17) is solved using matrix exponentials. As shown in Suppl. Inf. [26, Sec. IV] we get\nVm(L) = eKm LVm(0) =Ivm ( e\u2212ik m z L 0\n0 eik m z L\n) Imv . (24)\nAlthough this result is not surprising, as it corresponds to a layer matrix Lm(L), it is very instructive to demonstrate that Km corresponding to a microscopic thickness d \u2192 0, is sufficient to describe an homogeneous material of macroscopic thickness L. It allows to retrieve the propagation matrix and the interface matrices. This will be used in Sec. V to build the propagation matrix of an heterogeneous material and identify its effective permittivity tensor."

Then, in Sec. III we have introduced our AnisLay model that takes into account the effective thickness of one layer of 2D material.\nIn order to compare these models, either from a theoretical or an experimental point of view, we should either calculate the phase shift induced at the interface from the layer matrix or calculate the layer matrix from the phase jump at the interface.\nOur goal is to understand the relations between the different models in Tab. I. The final result is shown on Fig. 3, where models on the left have a thickness d = dm and those on the right are taken in the limit d \u2192 0. Red arrows between\n6 models correspond to loss of information, which is, for example, the case when going from an anisotropic model to an isotropic one, as in this case birefringence information is lost.\nWhen presenting the AnisInt model, we have seen that the surface polarization terms are associated to the quantities\u03d5ab and\u03c8ab in Eqs.

(32)\nNow comes the interesting physical interpretation. We expect that in the limit of infinitely thin layers, the righthand side of these last equations will provide the noncontinuity conditions of the electric field and displacement appearing in (2) and (3).\nWe first consider that the permittivity and the surface susceptibility are related by (21)\u2013(23) so that in the limit of very small dm , dm \u03b5mx \u2212\u03b50 \u03b50 \u2248\u03c7sx , and dm \u03b5 m x \u2212\u03b50 \u03b5mx\n\u2248 \u03besz . Alternatively, we can compute the interface matrix S mv v\nfrom Lm using back propagation\nS mv v =Pv (\u2212dm/2)Lm(dm)Pv (\u2212dm/2), (33)\nand we calculate TS \u00b1Rs \u22121 from this matrix to identify \u03d5ab and \u03c8ab from the phase jump at the 2D interface (2)-(3).\nBoth approaches provide the same results (See Suppl. Inf. [26, Sec. III]). This is important as it explains why the layer L (dm) can be presented either as a continuous layer as shown on Fig. 1(III), or as current sheet surrounded by vacuum, as depicted on Fig. 1(IV). This dual character of the AnisLay model allows to connect volume parameters such as permittivity, and propagation constant to surface parameters such as surface susceptibilities.\nAs \u03d5ab and \u03c8ab have different expressions for TE and TM configurations, they should be calculated separately. This provides\n\u03d5m\u22a5v v = 0, (34) \u03d5m\u2225v v = kvz \u03c7sx , (35)\n\u03c8m\u22a5v v = k20 kvz \u03c7sy , (36) \u03c8m\u2225v v = k2x kvz \u03besz , (37)\nwith \u03besz defined in (1). Importantly, in (34)\u2013(37) there is no coefficient involving response functions of the input or output material (see top boxes in Fig. 3).\nIn a practical experiment, data should be interpreted by including for the input layer a (resp. the substrate b), interface matrices Iav (resp. Ivb). Note that we are using kx here, which is defined at the input as kx = k0 na sin\u03b8a . This can introduce an apparent dependency on the refractive index of the input medium na and on the incidence angle in this medium \u03b8a , though the layer parameters are intrinsic.\nThe inverse problem of inferring the effective parameters of the layer (propagation constant, permittivity) from the phase jump at the 2D interface is an important step to describe heterogeneous multilayer systems.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to go from (34)\u2013(37) to a factorized version of Lm in terms of \u03a6m and \u03b1. The main difficulty here is that the three matrices in (9) depend on the effective permittivity of the layer. We will show that it is nonetheless possible to define effective propagation parameters using the eigenvalues of the Km matrix.\nStarting from boundary conditions (2) and (3), we build the interface matrix S mv v of a 2D layer surrounded by vacuum using (4) and the symmetry of the system leading to r = r \u2032, t = t \u2032. As detailed in Suppl. Inf. [26, Sec.

(38)\nThe layer matrix Lm is then built using (20) with an effective thickness dm that can be measured through electron microscopy [4], and a first order expansion of\nPv (dm) = I + ikmz dm ( \u22121 0 0 1 ) . (39)\nThe first-order layer matrix is\nLm(dm) = I + i ( \u2212A B \u2212B A ) dm , (40)\nA = \u03d5 m v v\n2tdm + \u03c8\nm v v\n2tdm +kvz , (41)\nB = \u03d5 m v v\n2tdm \u2212 \u03c8\nm v v\n2tdm . (42)\nEq. (40) has a convenient form to calculate Km from (19), and the volume matrix Vm(L) = exp(KmL) = Lm(L). This thick layer matrix has the form of (10).

This conclusion is valid within the error bound given in Sec. III C. It corresponds to the classical vision that on a subwavelength scale, dipole contributions can be summed to model the material response.\nWe see here that the total dipole contribution is handled separately from the total thickness. Though we can consider pure surface contributions from the dipole response of the 2D materials, we cannot neglect the thickness of the individual layers.\nHowever, for the out-of-plane component, it is convenient to use the displacement susceptibility \u03be defined in (1) so that (51) becomes\n1 \u03b50 \u2212 1 \u03b5z,h = 1 \u03b50 \u2212 d1 dh 1 \u03b5z,1 \u2212 d2 dh 1 \u03b5z,2 , (54)\ndh\u03beh = d1\u03be1 +d2\u03be2. (55)\nTherefore, as we have defined in (1) that \u03bes = d \u03be,\n\u03besh = \u03bes1 +\u03bes2. (56)\nAn important conclusion from (49) is that out-of-plane surface susceptibilities \u03c7sz do not sum in hybrid materials while the surface displacement susceptibilities \u03besz do.\nEquations (54) and (55) show that the displacement susceptibility \u03besz defined in (1) is the surface quantity that should be used to describe the out-of-plane response of a surface material, while \u03c7sx and \u03c7 s y are used for the in-plane response.\n8 To summarize previous results, the intrinsic surface quantities are defined through\n\u03c7m,sx = Px \u03b50E mx = Px \u03b50E tx = dm\u03c7mx = dm \u03b5mx \u2212\u03b50 \u03b50 , (57)\n\u03bem,sz = Pz Dmz = Pz D tz = dm\u03bemz = dm \u03b5mz \u2212\u03b50 \u03b5mz , (58)\nwith t denoting the transmitted fields and where the y component is obtained by the substitution x \u2192 y in (57).\nThese quantities are intrinsic in that they do not depend on the parameters of the surrounding layers. To clearly understand the meaning of this, remember that we have defined a layer as being surrounded by vacuum. In practice, when we evaluate the surface quantities of a layer m on a substrate b, we could do so based on the field in medium m [seen as a continuous medium, Fig. 1(III)]; in medium b; or in the vacuum when the layer is seen as a current sheet surrounded by vacuum [see Fig. 1(IV)].\nThe field and displacement components that appear in (57) and (58) are continuous across a surface without surface currents. Indeed, although we consider an interface with surface currents, we expect the phase shift induced by the currents to be small, as discussed in [23] and it can be neglected to calculate the field in the layer. Under this approximation, the tangential part of the electric field ~Et g (two components), and the normal component of the displacement field Dz (one component), are continuous across the interface. This means that we can decompose the interface matrix between medium m and substrate according to Imb = Imv Ivb , and assume that the three components mentioned above are the same in m, v and b, confirming that the surface quantities \u03c7m,sx , \u03c7 m,s y and \u03be m,s z are intrinsic.\nThese three quantities can be summed directly when stacking layers. This is especially useful to build an heterogeneous multilayer material, as the number of layers is limited. We remind here that calculations in Sec. V were performed in the first order limit and their precision is limited as estimated in Sec. III C."

            "text": "Experimental data about optical properties of 2D materials at different angles are very limited in the literature. This is probably due to the difficulty to record them with classical setups, as described in [20, 27]. To circumvent this difficulty, Xu [28] proposed an experimental configuration in which a 2D material is characterized in two steps: (i) on a polymer substrate; (ii) with the same polymer added on top, so that the 2D material is immersed in the polymer. As a test of our new AnisLay model, we will investigate if it is compatible with these experimental data.\nThe data in [21] are taken at a wavelength of 633 nm on a graphene and an MoS2 sample immersed in a polymer with refractive index np = 1.4233 at this wavelength. Four quantities are reported: the TE and TM reflectance, and the \u03a8\nand \u2206 ellipsometric parameters. The MicroDip model is fitted to these data with a good agreement. Analytical curves for this model are reproduced for graphene on Figs. 5.\nAs shown on Fig. 3 the different models do not use the same parameter for the out-of-plane polarization component. As the AnisInt model and the MicroDip model are both interface models, we will first use them to link \u03c7sz and \u03besz .\nIn Suppl. Inf. [26, Sec. VII], we compare the analytical expressions of the two models, and show that they are equivalent if, in matrix S mab =Iav S mv v Ivb , we set\n\u03c7sz = n2a \u03besz . (59)\nStarting from the surface susceptibilities published in [21], and reproduced in Tab. II, we can therefore calculate the line for the AnisInt model in this table. As both models are described by the same analytical expression, they are represented together in Fig. 5, where the TE and TM reflectance curves with respect to the input angle appear on the left, and the ellipsometric data appear on the right.\nIf the distinction that we made between the layer and the interface model is significant, we expect to find a difference in the reflectance and ellipsometric curves of the AnisLay model plotted with the parameters of the AnisInt model (line 2 in Tab. II). Fig. 5 shows that this is indeed the case for the TM reflectance curve past the pseudo-Brewster angle. However, the discrepancy for the TE mode is quite limited. Note that for the purpose of plotting data, the Lm matrix cannot be used directly, as it does not take into account the polymer surrounding the bidimensional layer. To this end, we build\nM maa =Iav Lm(dm)Iva . (60)\nThen, from the general shape of a transfer matrix M [Eq. (4)], we extract the reflection coefficient as a ratio of matrix components r = M21/M11. Doing so for TE and TM modes allows to retrieve the reflectance curves R(\u03b8) = |r (\u03b8)|2 and the ellipsometric ratio \u03c1 = r \u2225/r\u22a5 = tan\u03a8ei\u2206, from which we get the ellipsometric parameters\u03a8 and \u2206.\nFig. 5 confirms our expectation that different models will provide different retrieved parameters for the same set of data, raising the question of which are the intrinsic parameters. When comparing the AnisInt model and the MicroDip model, we have found equation (59) that relates both. It would be nice to find a similar link between the AnisLay model and the AnisInt model. We could not do so analytically, and resorted to numerical optimisation to match the curves of the AnisInt model with those of the AnisLay model by properly choosing the parameters. With the values reported on line \u201cAnisLay\u201d in Tab. II, we can match the two models almost perfectly, as reported on Fig. 5, where the optimally matching curve is identified by diamonds.\nThe difference between the AnisLay model and the AnisInt model comes from the additional propagation in vacuum in AnisLay model, and mainly affects the real part of the susceptibilities, and of the in-plane permittivity. We should note that this additional thickness has an impact on\n9\nboth the real and imaginary parts of the out-of-plane permittivity.\nThe same analysis on MoS2 leads to the curves in Fig. 6 and Tab. III, with similar conclusions as for graphene.\nSummarizing the previous results, the three models in Tab. II provide the same reflectance and ellipsometric parameters for different electromagnetic parameters. These models can therefore reproduce experimental results of ellipsometry with the same accuracy but with different susceptibilities and permittivities. However, as illustrated on Fig. 3, the newly proposed AnisLay model involves only intrinsic parameters in the description of the layer. Previous models provide therefore non-intrinsic parameters in Tab. II, which means that using the technique of [21], the retrieved susceptibilities of a given 2D material will vary if a\ndifferent surrounding polymer is used for the measurement. Moreover, as these models ignore the thickness of the 2D layer, they cannot be used directly to model multilayer systems.\nThe transfer matrix formalism accounts for multiple reflexions in stratified media and is therefore suited to the study of multilayer systems.\nHowever, to build the matrix of the system, we must consider a model and a geometry compatible with the model.\nDifferent possibilities are presented in Fig. 7. Interface models consider a thickness d = 0 with a dipolar response concentrated at the interface. A N-layer interface model corresponds to the transfer matrix\nMint = ( S mab )N . (61) The layer model, on the other hand provides\nMlay =Iav (Lm)N Ivb . (62)\n10\nInterestingly, for the immersed configuration where Iav = I\u22121vb , we have that(\nS mab )N = (Iav S mv v I\u22121av )N =Iav (S mv v )N Ivb , (63)\nwhich is similar to (62), with Sv v taking the place of Lm . In this case, we also have that(\nM mab )N =Iav (Lm)N Ivb . (64)\nAnother common model used in the litterature considers that the dipolar response is concentrated in a current sheet interface, with vacuum added (usually on top) to take into account the real thickness (N dm). Here, we consider three configurations depicted on Fig. 7, with the current sheet interface at the bottom, in the middle or at the top of the vaccuum layer. These correspond to\nMintvac,\u03b7 =Iav Pv ( \u03b7dm )( S mv v )N Pv ( (1\u2212\u03b7)dm ) Ivb , (65)\nwith \u03b7 = 0,1/2,1 respectively. From these matrices, we can again extract the reflection coefficient r =M21/M11.\nWe evaluate the reflectance and ellipsometric curves predicted for the five geometries of Fig. 7, with 10 and 100 layers. For the interface model, we consider the parameters of the AnisInt model in Tab. II and Tab. III, while for the other models we consider the intrinsic parameter reported in the last line of each table.\nResults are shown on Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, respectively for graphene and MoS2 sheets immersed in a polymer with refractive index na = 1.4233. For 10 layers, the change of reflectance between the interface and the layer models is negligible with respect to the experimental precision when graphene is considered. Modelling with the configurations \"vac+top/bot\" provides strong differences around the Brewster angle already at 10 layers for MoS2. For 100 layers, a change of the TM reflectance curve is clearly seen between the three configurations on the right of Fig. 7 while the three models labeled interface, layer and int+vac(mid) provide\nmore similar curves in the case of graphene. This is not the case for MoS2, where \u201cint+vac(mid)\u201d also differs from the interface and layer ones. The divergence between the AnisLay model and AnisInt model comes from their different angular dependency that is negligible for one layer but has an impact on 100 layers. From these results we conclude that AnisLay model should be used for multilayer systems, as it is the one that better reflects the physical distribution of dipolar response in the volume. Predictions made with the configuration \u201cint+vac(bot/top)\u201d should be avoided."

Our new layer model is based on intrinsic parameters. In particular, the out-of -plane polarization response of the current sheet is related to Dz using the displacement susceptibility \u03bez . The AnisLay model leads to simple expressions of the transmission and reflection ratios that predict flux conservation in a losless medium. It offers a complete picture where complex phase jumps at the 2D interface can be deduced from the volume parameters, or conversely. This shows that a first order description at this level contains all the physics. The AnisLay model offers a dual vision of layers that can be continuous or correspond to a current sheet surrounded by vacuum.\nApplication of the AnisLay model to heterostructures was straightforward. It demonstrated that the AnisLay model cannot be replaced by a simplified model for a high number of layers in TM configuration.\nThe relations with the previous models allow to connect volume parameters to ab-initio calculation [29] that can be performed in the 2D material.\nOur approach shows that for an accurate modelling, the thickness of the layer is important. For a low number of layers, the in-plane dipole contributions can be summed. For the out-of-plane component, we have introduced the displacement susceptibility \u03be allowing to assign surface values.\nWe believe that this work answers important questions for the community. In particular, we connect the different results published so far and provide the expressions to obtain intrinsic parameters from the different existing models. The use of these intrinsic parameters will be helpful to understand, characterize and tune properties of heterostructures."

However its first order expansion in \u03a6 has been criticized because it violates flux conservation for insulators [21].\nWhile this is true, from an algebraic perspective, this is fortunately not the case if the calculation is limited to the first order. To understand the origin of the problem, we consider (10) in the case where kmz is real. The interface matrices are not concerned with the Taylor expansion, and the flux violation can therefore not come from these matrices. The propagation matrix provides r = 0, t = exp(ikmz dm) and |t |2 = 1. Flux conservation is therefore verified if kmz is real. However, when t is expanded to first order, we get\nt = 1+ikmz dm so that |t |2 = 1+ \u2223\u2223kmz dm\u2223\u22232 showing that the flux is no more conserved. The error is of second order, which is negligible for typical values of \u03a6 = kmz dm , as shown in Sec.
