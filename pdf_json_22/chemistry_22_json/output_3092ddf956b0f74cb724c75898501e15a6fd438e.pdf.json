    "abstractText": "The burkholdines are a family of cyclic lipopeptides reported to exhibit antifungal activity. We synthesized a series of 18 burkholdine analogues in good yield by conventional Fmoc-SPPS followed by cyclization with DIPCI/HOBt in the solution phase. Although none of the synthesized peptides exhibited antifungal activity, several did potentiate the antibiotic effect of the antibiotic G418, including the Thr-bearing Bk analogue (4b) and the tartaramide-bearing Bk analogue (5b). This work exemplifies the potential of burkholdine analogues as potentiating agents.",

            "text": "The burkholdines (Bks) are a family of 25-membered cyclic lipopeptides composed of eight amino acids arranged in a lactam ring bearing a lipophilic side chain, which were first isolated from the proteobacteria Burkholderia ambifaria 2.2N by Schmidt in 2010 [1\u20134]. All naturally occurring Bks isolated so far have demonstrated potent antifungal activity, especially Bk-1119, whose activity is up to 25 times higher than that of amphotericin B [5\u20137]. The mechanism of this activity is thought to entail the inhibition of fungal \u03b2-glucan synthase, as is the case for the candine antibiotics micafungin [8] (MIC90 = 0.015 \u00b5g/mL (Candida albicans)) and caspofungin [9] (MIC90 = 0.25 \u00b5g/mL (C. albicans)) [10,11]. Bk-1119 is a promising lead compound for the development of safer antifungal drugs because it targets a \u03b2-glucan synthase not found in humans. However, neither the active site nor target enzyme of the Bks has been definitively identified, nor has the total synthesis of any Bk ever been reported. The role of the unusual residues \u03b2-OHTyr and \u03b2-OHAsn present in the Bk lactam ring is also unknown, but they are highly consequential, as their instability in strongly acidic solutions precludes the synthesis of peptides that incorporate them by conventional SPPS, which relies on TFA [12\u201314]. Accordingly, the scalable synthesis of Bks is needed to clarify their mechanism of action, establish the structural moieties essential for their good activity, and to generate enough material for mechanistic studies. In our laboratory, we have been conducting structure\u2013activity relationship studies of the Bks using Bk-1097 (1) as a lead compound [15,16]. Our studies so far have yielded two main findings. The first is that the 25-membered octapeptide structure is important for antifungal activity, although 27-membered octapeptides are also weakly active. The second is that the unusual amino acids present in the Bks are not essential for antifungal activity; analogue (2), which incorporates L-Tyr, L-Asn, and N-lauryl-3-amino-4-carbamoylpropanoic acid (LAP) in place of the unusual amino acids \u03b2-hydroxy Tyr, \u03b2-hydroxy Asn, and 3- amino-5,6,7-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (ATHOD) present in Bk-1097 (2), respectively, showed MIC = 25 \u00b5g/mL (S. cerevisiae).

For this work, we aimed to synthesize two series of 25- and 27-membered analogues incorporating either enantiomer of Dab at the Xaa8 position, as well as a third series incorporating L-Orn to investigate the efficiency of the ring size. To assess the influence of the length of the fatty side chain on antifungal activity, Bk analogues bearing undecane-, dodecane-, and octane-based side chains were all designed within each series.

Macrolactamization between the Xaa8 amine and the C-terminus carboxylic acid of the linear peptides was accomplished over 14\u201362 h in the presence of DIPC/HOBt. Global deprotection was performed with TFA/TIPS/H2O (95:2.5:2.5). The corresponding linear peptides were prepared by Fmoc-SPPS on 2-chlorotrityl resin (2-CT resin) starting from the loading of Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH onto the C-terminus of the corresponding linear peptides. The Alloc groups protecting the branched amino acids on Xaa8 were removed using catalytic Pd(0) and the corresponding linear peptides bearing protected side chains achieved cleavage from resin with 20% HFIP/CH2Cl2 (Scheme 1).

Yields of the requisite linear peptides incorporating the Dab residue by FmocSPPS were satisfactory (A%); those of the Orn-containing peptides (6a\u2013d, 7, and 8) were moderated. Macrolactamization of the linear peptides was accomplished according to our optimized conditions (B%). Purification of crude protected cyclic peptides was performed by silica gel column chromatography. The efficiency of the cyclization step was noted to be influenced by both the sequence of the amino acids of the linear precursor and their stereochemistry. The final deprotection of the cyclic peptides also gave various yields. However, the cyclic peptides incorporating a (R)-Dab residue (3e\u20135b) were obtained in moderate yields, confirming the stability of peptides (3e\u20135b) under acidic conditions. Yields for steps A\u2013D for each peptide are presented in Table 2. HPLC profiles and ESI-MS spectra data are included in the Supplementary Materials Figure S1.

In all cases, the retention times of the (S)-Dab-containing peptides were shorter than those of the (R)-Dab-containing peptides, which were similar to those bearing L-Orn. The retention times of the cyclic peptides were shorter for Tat > D-Ser > L-Thr > L-Ser, while peptides bearing the undecanoic acid moiety eluted faster than those bearing the decanoic acid by about 2 min. In addition, the polar surface areas (PSA) and logP values of these peptides were calculated using SPARTAN\u201918 (Wavefunction), using their stable conformers as calculated using molecular mechanics. The PSA of the Tat-bearing cyclic peptides (5a) was found to be similar to that of Bk-1097 (1). The logP values of these peptides also showed a similar tendency to the PSA values. The calculated PSA and logP values of synthesized peptides (3a)\u2013(8) were all negative and unlikely to exhibit cell penetration. Accordingly, any biological activities they exhibited almost certainly arose from their interactions with the cell surface. The antifungal activities of Bk analogues (3a)\u2013(8) were also evaluated at a concentration of 200 mg/mL. Against the yeast S. cerevisiae (ATCC204504), only 3b and 3f showed inhibitory effects, with MIC values of 100 and 200 mg/mL, respectively\u2014far higher than that of Bk analogue (2) (MIC = 25 \u00b5g/mL) [16]. None of the peptides inhibited A. oryzae (NBRC100959) or Candida viswanathii (NBRC10321) at 200 mg/mL concentration. This lack of activity may have been due to the high hydrophobicities of the analogues precluding their entry into the cells; the PSA and logP values for the analogues were all higher than those of Bk analogues (2). Future work will include a structure activity\u2013relationship study of natural Bk products and their analogues to better understand the mechanism of the antifungal inhibition (Table 3).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1191 7 of 14\nTwo antibiotics with different mechanisms of action can have a synergistic effect, together exerting an antifungal activity higher than the sum of their individual activities. Accordingly, the potentiation [17,18] of the antifungal effect of G418 (Geneticin) [19,20], an aminoglycosyl-type antibiotic that inhibits protein biosynthesis by binding to the ribosome 70S and 80S subunits, and zeocin (phleomucin D1) [21,22], a glycopeptide antibiotic and DNA intercalator, by cyclic peptides (3a)\u2013(8) was evaluated. Although the relatively high PSA and negative logP values of Bk analogues (3a)\u2013(8) are not conductive to cell penetration, there was the possibility that their fatty side chains have an affinity for cell surfaces. A dose of each 100 mg/mL of the cyclic peptides (3a)\u2013(8) did indeed potentiate the effect of G418 against the pathogenic fungus S. cerevisiae; the use of 3g, 4b, 5b, 6c, 7, and 8 dropped the MIC value of G418 from 25 mg/mL to 12.5 mg/mL, a two-fold increase in potency. The mechanism of action is not clear, but it is possible that the interaction of the cyclic peptides (3a)\u2013(8) with the cell wall increases its susceptibility to penetration by G418. However, no potentiation of zeocin by the cyclic peptides (3a)\u2013(8) was observed, perhaps because it proved a highly potent inhibitor on its own (MIC = 3.13 mg/mL) (Table 4).\nNote: a 3g was used at a rate of 100 mg/mL; b these assays were attempted three times."

Preparation of YPD Medium\nBacto yeast extract (0.63 g, 70161, Fluka, Barcelona, Spain), peptone (1.00 g, 26421, Mikuni, Japan), and glucose (1.00 g, 16806-25, Nacalai tesque, Japan) were added to H2O (50 mL) at room temperature and the mixture was heated to 60 \u25e6C. After 30 min, the mixture was sterilized by heating in an autoclave at 121 \u25e6C for 20 min.\n3.6.2. Preparation of Test Fungus Culture Solution\nDMSO (8 \u00b5L, 13406-55, Nacalai tesque, Japan) was added to YPD medium (750 \u00b5L). The test fungus culture solution (3 \u00b5L) was added to this solution (1.5 mL).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1191 13 of 14\n3.6.3. Preparation of Inhibitor\nThe inhibitor (each 1.0 mg; 3a\u2013h, 4a\u2013b, 5a\u2013b, 6a\u2013b, 7, 8) was dissolved in DMSO (40 \u00b5L).\n3.6.4. Assay of Antifungal Activity\nThe prepared test bacteria (50 \u00b5L) were placed in A1\u2013A12 of a 96-well plate. Bk analogue (50 \u00b5L) was added to A1, pipetting was performed, and then 50 \u00b5L was extracted from A1 and placed in A2. This operation was repeated until A11, and 50 \u00b5L extracted from A11 was discarded. The well plate was closed and incubated at 30 \u25e6C. After 24 h, the MIC values were evaluated.\n3.6.5. Potentiation Assay\nThe prepared test bacteria (50 \u00b5L) were placed in well A1\u2013A12 of a 96-well plate. G418 (200 mg/mL, 108321-42-2, Nacalai tesque, Japan) in H2O, then medium (50 mL) was added to A1, pipetting was performed, and 50 \u00b5L was extracted from A1 and placed in A2. This operation was repeated until A11, and 50 \u00b5L extracted from A11 was discarded. After 30 min, Bk analogue (200 \u00b5g/mL) in medium (50 mL) was added to each solution (final concentration = 100 \u00b5g/mL). The well plate was closed and incubated at 30 \u25e6C.

            "text": "We synthesized 18 cyclic Bk analogues via ordinary Fmoc-SPPS, macrolactamization, and global deprotection in solution phase. The antifungal activities of these cyclic peptides were very weak in comparison with the Bk analogue (2), but the Thr-bearing Bk analogue (4b) and Tat-bearing Bk analogue (5b) had weak potentiating effects on G418 and their syntheses were accomplished in good yield. We will investigate the optimized structures for potent potentiation activity and mechanisms of action in due course.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded.
