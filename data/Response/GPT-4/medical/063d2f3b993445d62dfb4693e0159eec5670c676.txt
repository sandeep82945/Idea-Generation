Long-Term Exposure Effects: Investigate the long-term effects (beyond two months) of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on Sprague Dawley rats to assess whether prolonged exposure exacerbates the mild liver and lung changes observed, leads to functional impairments, or affects other organs not affected in the short term.

Dose-Response Relationship: Explore the relationship between the intensity and duration of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure and biological effects. This study could involve varying the intensity and duration of exposure to determine thresholds for adverse effects, providing insights into safe exposure levels.

Mechanistic Studies on Inflammatory Responses: Conduct detailed mechanistic studies to understand how 150 kHz IF EMR exposure leads to inflammatory changes in the liver and lungs. This could include investigations into the role of oxidative stress, the activation of specific cellular pathways, and the production of inflammatory cytokines.

Effects on Other Biological Systems: Examine the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure on the immune system, reproductive system, and neurological system in Sprague Dawley rats. These studies could help to identify any potential systemic effects of EMR exposure that were not covered in the initial study.

Comparative Studies Across Different Species: Perform comparative studies to assess the effects of 150 kHz IF EMR exposure across different mammalian species, including humans, to determine species-specific vulnerabilities and extrapolate findings to human health risk assessments. This could involve using in vitro models, such as human cell lines, to study cellular responses to EMR exposure.
