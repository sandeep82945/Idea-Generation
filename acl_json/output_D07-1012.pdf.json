    "abstractText": "This paper compares a deep and a shallow processing approach to the problem of classifying a sentence as grammatically wellformed or ill-formed. The deep processing approach uses the XLE LFG parser and English grammar: two versions are presented, one which uses the XLE directly to perform the classification, and another one which uses a decision tree trained on features consisting of the XLE\u2019s output statistics. The shallow processing approach predicts grammaticality based on n-gram frequency statistics: we present two versions, one which uses frequency thresholds and one which uses a decision tree trained on the frequencies of the rarest n-grams in the input sentence. We find that the use of a decision tree improves on the basic approach only for the deep parser-based approach. We also show that combining both the shallow and deep decision tree features is effective. Our evaluation is carried out using a large test set of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. The ungrammatical test set is generated automatically by inserting grammatical errors into well-formed BNC sentences.",

An accurate method for carrying out automatic\n\u2217Also affiliated to IBM CAS, Dublin.\ngrammaticality judgements has uses in the areas of computer-assisted language learning and grammar checking. Comparative evaluation of existing error detection approaches has been hampered by a lack of large and commonly used evaluation error corpora. We attempt to overcome this by automatically creating a large error corpus, containing four different types of frequently occurring grammatical errors. We use this corpus to evaluate the performance of two approaches to the task of automatic error detection. One approach uses low-level detection techniques based on POS n-grams. The other approach is a novel parser-based method which employs deep linguistic processing to discriminate grammatical input from ungrammatical. For both approaches, we implement a basic solution, and then attempt to improve upon this solution using a decision tree classifier. We show that combining both methods improves upon the individual methods.\nN-gram-based approaches to the problem of error detection have been proposed and implemented in various forms by Atwell(1987), Bigert and Knutsson (2002), and Chodorow and Leacock (2000) amongst others. Existing approaches are hard to compare since they are evaluated on different test sets which vary in size and error density. Furthermore, most of these approaches concentrate on one type of grammatical error only, namely, context-sensitive or realword spelling errors. We implement a vanilla ngram-based approach which is tested on a very large test set containing four different types of error.\nThe idea behind the parser-based approach to error detection is to use a broad-coverage hand-crafted precision grammar to detect ungrammatical sen-\n112\ntences. This approach exploits the fact that a precision grammar is designed, in the traditional generative grammar sense (Chomsky, 1957), to distinguish grammatical sentences from ungrammatical sentences. This is in contrast to treebank-based grammars which tend to massively overgenerate and do not generally aim to discriminate between the two. In order for our approach to work, the coverage of the precision grammars must be broad enough to parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing system for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English grammar (Butt et al., 2002) for our experiments. This system employs robustness techniques, some borrowed from Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince and Smolensky, 1993), to parse extra-grammatical input (Frank et al., 1998), but crucially still distinguishes between optimal and suboptimal solutions.\nThe evaluation corpus is a subset of an ungrammatical version of the British National Corpus (BNC), a 100 million word balanced corpus of British English (Burnard, 2000). This corpus is obtained by automatically inserting grammatical errors into the original BNC sentences based on an analysis of a manually compiled \u201creal\u201d error corpus.\nThis paper makes the following contributions to the task of automatic error detection:\n1. A novel deep processing XLE-based approach\n2. An effective and novel application of decision tree machine learning to both shallow and deep approaches\n3. A novel combination of deep and shallow processing\n4. An evaluation of an n-gram-based approach on a wider variety of errors than has previously been carried out\n5. A large evaluation error corpus\nThe paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, we describe previous approaches to the problem of error detection; in Section 3, a description of the error corpus used in our evaluation experiments is presented, and in Section 4, the two approaches to error detection are presented, evaluated, combined\nand compared. Section 5 provides a summary and suggestions for future work."

            "text": "A precision grammar is a formal grammar designed to distinguish ungrammatical from grammatical senences. This is in contrast to large treebank-induced grammars which often accept ungrammatical input (Charniak, 1996). While high coverage is required, it is difficult to increase coverage without also increasing the amount of ungrammatical sentences that are accepted as grammatical by the grammar. Most publications in grammar-based automatic error detection focus on locating and categorising errors and giving feedback. Existing grammars are re-used (Vandeventer Faltin, 2003), or grammars of limited size are developed from scratch (Reuer, 2003).\nThe ParGram English LFG is a hand-crafted broad-coverage grammar developed over several years with the XLE platform (Butt et al., 2002). The XLE parser uses OT to resolve ambiguities (Prince and Smolensky, 1993). Grammar constraints reulting in rare constructions can be marked as \u201cdispreferred\u201d and constraints resulting in common ungrammatical constructions can be marked as \u201cungrammatical\u201d. The use of constraint ordering and marking increases the robustness of the grammar, while maintaining the grammatical / ungrammatical distinction (Frank et al., 1998). The English Resource Grammar (ERG) is a precision HeadDriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) of English (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000; Pollard and Sag, 1994). Its coverage is not as broad as the XLE English grammar. Baldwin et al. (2004) propose a method to identify gaps in the grammar. Blunsom and Baldwin (2006) report ongoing development.\nThere has been previous work using the ERG and the XLE grammars in the area of computer-assisted language learning. Bender et al. (2004) use a version of the ERG containing mal-rules to parse illformed sentences from the SST corpus of Japanese learner English (Emi et al., 2004). They then use the semantic representations of the ill-formed input to generate well-formed corrections. Khader et al. (2004) study whether the ParGram English LFG can be used for computer-assisted language learning by\nadding additional OT marks for ungrammatical constructions observed in a learner corpus. However, the evaluation is preliminary, on only 50 test items."

            "text": "Most shallow approaches to grammar error detection originate from the area of real-word spelling error correction. A real-word spelling error is a spelling or typing error which results in a token which is another valid word of the language in question.\nThe (to our knowledge) oldest work in this area is that of Atwell (1987) who uses a POS tagger to flag POS bigrams that are unlikely according to a reference corpus. While he speculates that the bigram frequency should be compared to how often the same POS bigram is involved in errors in an error corpus, the proposed system uses the raw frequency with an empirically established threshold to decide whether a bigram indicates an error. In the same paper, a completely different approach is presented that uses the same POS tagger to consider spelling variants that have a different POS. In the example sentenceI am veryhit the POS of the spelling varianthot/JJis added to the list NN-VB-VBD-VBN of possible POS tags ofhit. If the POS tagger chooses hit/JJ, the word is flagged and the correctionhot is proposed to the user. Unlike most n-gram-based approaches, Atwell\u2019s work aims to detect grammar errors in general and not just real-word spelling errors. However, a complete evaluation is missing.\nThe idea of disambiguating between the elements of confusion sets is related to word sense disambiguation. Golding (1995) builds a classifier based on a rich set of context features. Mays et al. (1991) apply the noisy channel model to the disambiguation problem. For each candidate correctionS\u2032 of the input S the probabilityP (S\u2032)P (S|S\u2032) is calculated and the most likely correction selected. This method is re-evaluated by Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn et al. (2006) on WSJ data with artificial real-word spelling errors.\nBigert and Knutsson (2002) extend upon a basic n-gram approach by attempting to match n-grams of low frequency with similar n-grams in order to reduce overflagging. Furthermore, n-grams crossing clause boundaries are not flagged and the similarity measure is adapted in the case of phrase boundaries that usually result in low frequency n-grams.\nChodorow and Leacock (2000) use a mutual in-\nformation measure in addition to raw frequency of ngrams. Apart from this, their ALEK system employs other extensions to the basic approach, for example frequency counts from both generic and wordspecific corpora are used in the measures. It is not reported how much each of these contribute to the overall performance.\nRather than trying to implement all of the previous n-gram approaches, we implement the basic approach which uses rare n-grams to predict grammaticality. This property is shared by all previous shallow approaches. We also test our approach on a wider class of grammatical errors."

A corpus of ungrammatical sentences can take the form of a learner corpus (Granger, 1993; Emi et al., 2004), i. e. a corpus of sentences produced by language learners, or it can take the form of a more general error corpus comprising sentences which are not necessarily produced in a language-learning context and which contain competence and performance errors produced by native and non-native speakers of the language (Becker et al., 1999; Foster and Vogel, 2004; Foster, 2005). For both types of error corpus, it is not enough to collect a large set of sentences which are likely to contain an error - it is also necessary to examine each sentence in order to determine whether an error has actually occurred, and, if it has, to note the nature of the error. Thus, like the creation of a treebank, the creation of a corpus of un-\nrammatical sentences requires time and linguistic knowledge, and is by no means a trivial task.\nA corpus of ungrammatical sentences which is large enough to be useful can be created automatically by inserting, deleting or replacing words\nin grammatical sentences. These transformations should be linguistically realistic and should, therefore, be based on an analysis of naturally produced grammatical errors.

            "text": "Following Foster (2005), we define a sentence to be ungrammatical if all the words in the sentence are well-formed words of the language in question, but the sentence contains one or more error. This error can take the form of a performance slip which can occur due to carelessness or tiredness, or a competence error which occurs due to a lack of knowledge of a particular construction. This definition includes real-word spelling errors and excludes nonword spelling errors. It also excludes the abbreviated informal language used in electronic communication. Using the above definition as a guideline, a 20,000 word corpus of ungrammatical English sentences was collected from a variety of written texts including newspapers, academic papers, emails and website forums (Foster and Vogel, 2004; Foster, 2005). The errors in the corpus were carefully analysed and classified in terms of how they might be corrected using the three word-level correction operators: insert, delete and substitute. The following frequency ordering of the three word-level correction operators was found: substitute(48%)> insert (24%)> delete(17%)> combination(11%) Stemberger (1982) reports the same ordering of the substitution, deletion and insertion correction operators in a study of native speaker spoken language slips. Among the grammatical errors which can be corrected by substituting one word for another, the most common errors are real-word spelling errors and agreement errors. In fact, 72% of all errors fall into one of the following four classes:\n1. missing word errors: Whatare the subjects?> What the subjects?\n2. extra word errors:\nWas that in the summer?> Was that in the summerin?\n3. real-word spelling errors: She couldnot comprehend.> She couldno comprehend.\n4. agreement errors: She steered Melissa round a corner.> She steered Melissa round acorners.\nA similar classification was adopted by Nicholls (1999), having analysed the errors in a learner corpus. Our research is currently limited to the four error types given above, i. e. missing word errors, extra word errors, real-word spelling errors and agreements errors. However, it is possible for it to be extended to handle a wider class of errors."

For each BNC sentence, the error creation procedure records all tokens in the sentence which appear as one half of one of these word pairs. One token is selected at random and replaced by the other half of the pair. The list of common real-word spelling error pairs contains such frequently occurring words asis anda, and the procedure therefore produces an ill-formed sentence for most input sentences."

The XLE deep-processing approach is better than the ngram-based approach for agreement errors (f-score +10.4). Examining the various types of agreement errors, we can see that this is especially the case for singular subjects followed by plural copula verbs (recall +37.7) and determiner-noun number mismatches (recall +23.6 for singular nouns and +18.0 for plural nouns), but not for plural subjects followed by singular verbs (recall -24.0). The relatively poor performance of Method 2 on agreement errors involving determiners could be due to the lack of agreement marking on the Penn Treebank determiner tag used by TreeTagger.\nMethod 1 is outperformed by Method 2 for realword spelling and extra word errors (f-score -4.2, -4.0). Unsurprisingly, Method 2 has an advantage on those real-word spelling errors that change the POS (recall -8.8 for Method 1). Both methods perform poorly on missing word errors. For both methods there are only very small differences in performance between the various missing word error subtypes (identified by the POS of the deleted word).\nMethod 3, which uses machine learning to exploit all the information returned by the XLE parser, improves performance from Method 1, the basic XLE\nmethod, for all error types.5 The general improvement comes from an improvement in recall, meaning that more ungrammatical sentences are actually flagged as such without compromising precision. The improvement is highest for agreement errors (f-score +7.2). Singular subject with plural copula errors (e. g.The man are) peak at a recall of\n91.0. The Method 3 results indicate that information\non the number of solutions (optimal and unoptimal),\nthe number of subtrees, the time taken to parse the sentence and the number of words can be used to predict grammaticality. It would be interesting to investigate this approach with other parsers.\nMethod 4, which uses a decision tree with ngram-based features, confirms the results of Method 2. The decision trees\u2019 root nodes are similar or even identical (depending on cross-validation run) to the decision rule of Method 2 (5-gram frequency below\n4). However, the 10 decision trees have between\n1,111 and 1,905 nodes and draw from all features, even bigrams and 7-grams that perform poorly on their own. The improvements are very small though and they are not significant according the criterion of non-overlapping cross-validation results. The main reason for the evaluation of Method 4 is to provide another reference point for comparison of the final method.\nThe overall best results are those for Method 5, the combined XLE, n-gram and machine-learningbased method, which outperforms the next best method, Method 3, on all error types apart from agreement errors (f-score -1.7, +2.7, +3.8, +0.8). For agreement errors, it seems that the relatively poor results for n-grams have a negative effect on the relatively good results for the XLE. Figure 2 shows that the performance is almost constant on ungrammatical data in the important sentence length range from 5 to 40. However, there is a negative correlation of accuracy and sentence length for grammatical sentences. Very long sentences of any kind tend to be classified as ungrammatical, except for missing word errors which remain close to the 50% baseline of coin-flipping.\nFor all methods, missing word errors are the worst-performing, particularly in recall (i. e. the ac-\n5The +0.3 increase in average accuracy for extra word errors is not clearly significant as the results of cross-validation runs overlap.\nFigure 2: Accuracy by sentence length for Method 5 measured on separate grammatical and ungrammatical data: Gr = Grammatical, AG = Agreement, RW = Real-Word, EW = Extra Word, MW = Missing Word\ncuracy on ungrammatical data alone). This means that the omission of a word is less likely to result in the sentence being flagged as erroneous. In contrast, extra word errors perform consistently and relatively well for all methods."

However, extending the shallow approach with the same learning algorithm gives only small improvements. Combining the deep and shallow approaches gives an additional improvement on all but one error type.\nOur plan is to investigate why all methods perform poorly on missing word errors, to extend the error creation procedure so that it includes a wider range of errors, to try the deep approach with other parsers, to integrate additional features from stateof-the-art shallow techniques and to repeat the experiments for languages other than English."
