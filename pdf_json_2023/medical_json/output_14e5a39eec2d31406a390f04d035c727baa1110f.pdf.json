    "abstractText": "Background Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This post hoc analysis assessed tofacitinib efficacy on enthesitis by baseline location and severity, and impact on disease activity and patient\u2010reported outcomes (PROs), in patients with PsA. Methods Data were pooled from two phase 3 studies (NCT01877668/NCT01882439) in patients with PsA receiving tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily to month (M)6 or placebo to M3. Endpoints were: change from baseline in Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) or Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Enthesitis Index (SPARCC); proportions of patients with enthesitis, relapsed enthesitis after resolution, de novo enthesitis, low disease activity (LDA) or remis\u2010 sion (minimal disease activity/very low disease activity; Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score; Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis, and Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis); and PROs (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy\u2010Fatigue [FACIT\u2010F] total and arthritis pain Visual Analog Scale scores). Descriptive statistics were generated by visit and treatment. Change from baseline in PROs was evaluated by multivariate linear regression. Results Seven hundred ten patients from two studies were included: 479 had LEI > 0; 545 had SPARCC > 0; and 136 had LEI = 0 and SPARCC = 0 at baseline. At baseline, among patients with LEI > 0 or SPARCC > 0, mean LEI and SPARCC across treatments and enthesitis locations/severities ranged from 1.0\u20134.4 and 1.3\u20139.4, respectively. Across several baseline enthesitis locations/severities, changes from baseline in LEI and SPARCC up to M3 were greater with tofacitinib (\u20102.0\u20130.4 and \u20103.5\u20130.2) vs placebo (\u20100.9\u20130.4 and \u20101.5\u20131.1). Enthesitis at M6 was more common in patients with greater baseline enthesitis severity. At M6, \u2264 40% of patients with baseline LEI > 0 or SPARCC > 0 whose enthesitis had resolved by M1/M3 experienced a relapse, and < 14% of patients with baseline LEI = 0 and SPARCC = 0 had de novo enthesitis. LDA/remission rates generally increased with tofacitinib over time. Baseline LEI location was significantly associated with change from baseline in arthritis pain score, while baseline SPARCC severity was significantly associated with change from baseline in FACIT\u2010F total and arthritis pain scores. Conclusion Tofacitinib treatment resulted in improvements in enthesitis in patients with PsA, regardless of baseline location or severity. Trial registration NCT01877668;NCT01882439.",

Endpoints were: change from baseline in Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) or Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Enthesitis Index (SPARCC); proportions of patients with enthesitis, relapsed enthesitis after resolution, de novo enthesitis, low disease activity (LDA) or remis\u2011 sion (minimal disease activity/very low disease activity; Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score; Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis, and Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis); and PROs (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy\u2011Fatigue [FACIT\u2011F] total and arthritis pain Visual Analog Scale scores). Descriptive statistics were generated by visit and treatment. Change from baseline in PROs was evaluated by multivariate linear regression.\nResults Seven hundred ten patients from two studies were included: 479 had LEI > 0; 545 had SPARCC > 0; and 136 had LEI = 0 and SPARCC = 0 at baseline. At baseline, among patients with LEI > 0 or SPARCC > 0, mean LEI and SPARCC across treatments and enthesitis locations/severities ranged from 1.0\u20134.4 and 1.3\u20139.4, respectively. Across several baseline enthesitis locations/severities, changes from baseline in LEI and SPARCC up to M3 were greater with tofacitinib (\u20112.0\u20130.4 and \u20113.5\u20130.2) vs placebo (\u20110.9\u20130.4 and \u20111.5\u20131.1). Enthesitis at M6 was more common in patients with greater baseline enthesitis severity. At M6, \u2264 40% of patients with baseline LEI > 0 or SPARCC > 0 whose enthesitis had resolved by M1/M3 experienced a relapse, and < 14% of patients with baseline LEI = 0 and SPARCC = 0 had de novo enthesitis. LDA/remission rates generally increased with tofacitinib over time. Baseline LEI location was significantly associated with change from baseline in arthritis pain score, while baseline SPARCC severity was significantly associated with change from baseline in FACIT\u2011F total and arthritis pain scores.\nConclusion Tofacitinib treatment resulted in improvements in enthesitis in patients with PsA, regardless of baseline location or severity.\nTrial registration NCT01877668;NCT01882439.

            "text": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with musculoskeletal and dermatologic manifestations [1]. Enthesitis, defined as inflammation where the tendon, ligament, or joint capsule insert in the bone, has been reported in 35\u201350% of patients with PsA [2]. Enthesitis has been associated with greater PsA disease activity [3, 4]. Moreover, enthesitis severity has been associated with radiographic peripheral and axial joint damage\u00a0 [5]. Patients with vs without enthesitis generally reported worse functional status, greater fatigue and pain, and reduced work productivity [3, 4]. When deciding on treatment strategies for PsA, enthesitis has been recognized as an important domain to be considered [6].\nTofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of PsA. Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5\u00a0mg twice daily (BID; recommended dosage) [7, 8] and 10\u00a0mg BID have been demonstrated in two phase 3 studies of patients with active PsA [9, 10], and in an open-label, long-term extension study [11]. In the two phase\u00a03 studies, tofacitinib treatment was associated with greater improvements in enthesitis vs placebo by month 3 [9, 10].\nIn this post hoc analysis, the effects of tofacitinib on enthesitis, its impact on PsA disease activity, and patientreported outcomes (PROs) in patients with vs without enthesitis at baseline, were further evaluated. Development of de novo enthesitis was also investigated."

Details of these trials have been reported previously [9, 10].\nOPAL Broaden was a 12-month study of tofacitinib in tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi)-na\u00efve patients with an inadequate response to a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic\u00a0 drug (csDMARD). Patients received tofacitinib 5 or 10\u00a0mg BID, adalimumab 40\u00a0mg subcutaneous injection once every 2\u00a0weeks, or placebo (advancing to tofacitinib 5 or 10\u00a0mg BID at month 3) [9]. OPAL Beyond was a 6-month study of tofacitinib in patients with an inadequate response to TNFi. Patients received tofacitinib 5 or 10\u00a0mg BID or placebo (advancing to tofacitinib 5 or 10\u00a0 mg BID at month 3) [10]. In both studies, patients also received a stable background dose of a single csDMARD.\nThis post hoc analysis included patients receiving tofacitinib 5 or 10\u00a0 mg BID to month 6, or placebo to month 3.\nBoth studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards and/or an Independent Ethics Committee at each study center, and all patients provided written, informed consent."

            "text": "In OPAL Broaden and Beyond, presence of enthesitis in patients was determined at baseline, and at months 1, 3, and 6, by a blinded, qualified assessor using\u00a0 the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) [12] and Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Enthesitis Index (SPARCC) [13]. To generate LEI scores, three bilateral enthesitis sites were assessed for tenderness: lateral epicondyle humerus, medial femoral condyle, and Achilles tendon insertion (Fig.\u00a01a). To generate SPARCC scores, eight bilateral enthesitis sites were assessed for tenderness: supraspinatus insertion into greater tuberosity of\nhumerus,\u00a0lateral epicondyle humerus, medial epicondyle humerus, greater trochanter, quadriceps insertion into superior border of patella, patellar ligament insertion into inferior pole of patella or tibial tubercle (assessed as one site), Achilles tendon insertion into calcaneum, and plantar fascia insertion into calcaneum (Fig.\u00a01b). A score was assigned dichotomously for each site assessed by LEI and SPARCC, where 0 = no tenderness and 1 = tenderness. LEI (range 0\u20136) and SPARCC (range 0\u201316) scores were calculated as the sum of the site scores, with higher scores indicating greater severity.\nPatients were categorized based on the presence (LEI > 0 or SPARCC > 0) or absence (LEI = 0 and SPARCC = 0) of enthesitis at baseline. Patients with enthesitis were further stratified by enthesitis location and severity at baseline. Enthesitis location was determined as the individual sites assessed for LEI (Fig.\u00a01a) and the location of the sites assessed for SPARCC (upper sites, lower sites, or both upper and lower sites; Fig.\u00a0 1b). Enthesitis severity was determined by the number of affected sites, with a higher number indicating greater severity: 1,\u00a0 2, or 3\u20136 affected sites for LEI and 1\u20132, > 2\u2013 \u2264 5, or > 5 affected sites for SPARCC.\nData at baseline and months 1, 3, and 6, from OPAL Broaden and Beyond, were included in this analysis. Individual patient-level data across the two studies were pooled, and data-handling conventions that were utilized in each study, including the handling of missing data, were also applied across the pooled data.\nThe following endpoints were assessed in patients with LEI > 0 or SPARCC > 0 at baseline: change from baseline in LEI or SPARCC, and the proportions of patients with enthesitis or with relapsed enthesitis (assessed at months 3 and 6 only) after resolution at months 1 or 3. The development of de novo enthesitis in patients with LEI = 0 and SPARCC = 0 at baseline was also assessed.\nDisease activity measures assessed were: the proportion of patients achieving low disease activity (LDA) and remission, based on minimal disease activity (MDA; \u2265 5/7 criteria)/very low disease activity (7/7 MDA criteria), Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS; > 1.9\u2013 < 3.2/ \u2264 1.9 [near remission]), Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA; > 4\u2013 \u2264 14/ \u2264 4), and Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (CPDAI; > 2\u2013 \u2264 4/ \u2264 2). Detailed descriptions of the disease activity measures are presented in Supplementary Table\u00a01 (see Additional file\u00a01).\nPROs included Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) total score (range 0\u201352; higher scores indicate less fatigue) [14] and arthritis pain (assessed by Visual Analog Scale [VAS]; range\u00a00\u2013100\u00a0mm) [15]."

Baseline covariates included were: the respective PRO being assessed; enthesitis in LEI locations (lateral epicondyle humerus [yes/no], medial femoral condyle [yes/no], Achilles tendon insertion [yes/no]); enthesitis severity based on LEI (0 vs 1, 2, or 3\u20136 affected sites); enthesitis in SPARCC locations (upper sites only [yes/no], lower sites only [yes/no], both upper and lower sites [yes/no]); and enthesitis severity based on SPARCC (0\u00a0 vs 1\u20132, > 2\u2013 \u2264 5, or > 5 affected sites). In the pooled tofacitinib analysis, a variable for dose group (tofacitinib 5\u00a0 mg BID vs 10\u00a0 mg BID) was included in the model as a covariate. Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons."

            "text": "In phase 3 studies of patients with PsA (OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond), greater improvements in enthesitis and more frequent enthesitis resolution were reported at month 3 with tofacitinib vs placebo [9, 10]. This post hoc analysis explored the effects of tofacitinib on enthesitis in patients with enthesitis at baseline, by location or severity, and compared outcomes among patients with vs without enthesitis at baseline.\nAt month 3, improvements in LEI were greater with tofacitinib 10\u00a0 mg BID vs placebo in patients with enthesitis at the lateral epicondyle humerus or medial femoral condyle at baseline (10\u00a0 mg BID) and in patients with 3\u20136 affected sites (5\u00a0 mg BID); while greater improvements in SPARCC were observed with tofacitinib vs placebo in patients with enthesitis\nin both upper and lower sites at baseline (10\u00a0 mg BID at month 3) and in patients with > 2\u2013 \u2264 5 affected SPARCC sites at baseline (5\u00a0 mg BID at month 1 and both doses at month 3). Improvements from baseline in enthesitis in tofacitinib-treated patients were observed as early as month 1 and maintained to month 6; greatest improvements were seen in patients with greatest severity at baseline. Regardless of baseline enthesitis location or severity, enthesitis presence generally decreased over time with tofacitinib treatment. At month 6, relapse of previously resolved enthesitis was observed in \u2264 40% of tofacitinib-treated patients with enthesitis at baseline. Disease activity remission rates and fatigue scores were generally similar across treatments. Tofacitinib treatment was associated with greater LDA rates or improvements from baseline in pain scores compared with placebo, though fluctuations were observed over time.\nThrough month 6, presence of enthesitis, as assessed by LEI, was similar across baseline enthesitis location, indicating that no site was at a greater risk for enthesitis. Enthesitis by SPARCC was more common in patients with enthesitis in both upper and lower sites at baseline. These differences in treatment response are aligned with results from a previous analysis of the US CorEvitas (formerly Corrona) PsA/Spondylarthritis (SpA) Registry, where impact of enthesitis, assessed by SPARCC, on disease activity was highest in patients with enthesitis at both upper and lower sites, followed by lower sites only and upper sites only [16]. In our study, longer-term enthesitis was less frequent in patients with lower vs greater severity at baseline.\nMultivariable linear regression analyses demonstrated that enthesitis at the lateral epicondyle humerus and Achilles tendon insertion, as assessed by LEI, was significantly associated with change from baseline in arthritis pain scores at month 3 following treatment with tofacitinib 5\u00a0 mg BID, suggesting that these sites may have a greater role on disease activity. When assessed by SPARCC, baseline enthesitis severity (specifically, > 5 vs 0 affected sites comparison) was significantly associated with change from baseline in FACIT-F total and arthritis pain scores in the pooled (months 3 and 6) and individual tofacitinib groups (tofacitinib 5\u00a0mg BID: month 6 for FACIT-F total and arthritis pain scores; tofacitinib 10\u00a0mg BID: month 3 for FACIT-F total scores, months 3 and 6 for arthritis pain scores); however, no significant association between baseline enthesitis location and change from baseline in FACIT-F total and arthritis pain scores was identified in the pooled or individual tofacitinib groups. This finding suggests that enthesitis severity, and not location, may have a greater impact on treatment\nresponse for patients; however, in the US CorEvitas PsA/ SpA Registry analysis, enthesitis presence in lower or both upper and lower sites was significantly associated with greater pain and fatigue score [16].\nIn this analysis, development of de novo enthesitis was low and similar for tofacitinib and placebo. Interestingly, when assessed by LEI, emerging enthesitis at the lateral epicondyle humerus was observed at all time points across treatments. It should be noted that enthesopathy at the lateral epicondyle humerus is not infrequent in the general population [17, 18], and tenderness at this site may not reflect new onset inflammatory enthesitis related to PsA. As such, the lateral epicondyle humerus may be less reliable in assessing treatment response although being commonly involved in PsA and tenderness at this site only partially links to sonographic enthesitis [19].\nThe effects of other PsA treatments on individual enthesitis sites or differing enthesitis severities have been reported previously. Efficacy of ixekizumab on enthesitis resolution rates was generally consistent across locations when assessed by LEI [20]. Differences in treatment response based on enthesitis location with adalimumab vs placebo were reported in a post\u00a0 hoc analysis of a phase 3 study that included 165 patients with peripheral SpA; at the Achilles tendon and lateral epicondyle humerus, the number of enthesitis sites was reduced by over 50%, and significantly greater resolution rates and less development of de novo enthesitis were observed in patients treated with adalimumab vs placebo [21]. At week 24, greatest improvement in LEI with guselkumab vs placebo was observed in patients with severe enthesitis at baseline; however, by week 52, resolution was more common in patients with mild or moderate enthesitis at baseline [22]. A pooled analysis of two phase 3 studies in patients with PsA treated with secukinumab demonstrated that enthesitis resolution at week 104 was less prominent in patients with more vs less severe enthesitis at baseline [23].\nLimitations of this study include the post hoc nature of the analysis, low patient numbers in several enthesitis location or severity subgroups, and lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons. Additionally, comparisons with placebo were restricted to 3\u00a0 months, and the effects of tofacitinib on enthesitis were only assessed up to month 6, consistent with the original study designs. The clinical enthesitis assessments used also have known limitations. While LEI was designed specifically to assess enthesitis in patients with PsA [12], and SPARCC has been used widely in patients with SpA [24], to our knowledge, intra-observer reliability for LEI and SPARCC has not been studied, and strong inter-observer reliability was demonstrated only in\npatients with PsA with axial involvement [25]. Furthermore, clinical enthesitis assessment at peripheral sites by physical examination may not accurately assess true inflammation in the entheses, compared with advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging [26, 27]. Central pain sensitization, manifested as widespread allodynia, may be associated with chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders; therefore, tenderness may be elicited on physical examination, even when no inflammation is present and vice versa [28]. When inflammation is abrogated, regardless of its mechanism, allodynia may diminish [26] and subsequently reflect as an improvement in the clinical \u201centhesitis\u201d score, despite any actual improvement in inflammation at the entheses [29]. This effect may be more prominent in enthesitis sites near the fibromyalgia points, including the elbows and knees."

            "text": "This post hoc analysis demonstrated greater improvements from baseline in enthesitis and disease activity measures in patients with PsA receiving tofacitinib vs placebo across several enthesitis locations and with varying enthesitis severity at baseline. An association between enthesitis at the lateral epicondyle humerus and Achilles tendon insertion and improvement in pain, and an association between enthesitis severity (assessed by SPARCC) and improvements in fatigue and pain were identified. These findings support tofacitinib as a treatment option for patients with PsA with enthesitis and affirm the importance of addressing enthesitis in the PsA treatment paradigm."
