Particularly interested in the intersection among religion, psychology, and wellness, his academic work over more than two decades has analyzed the transformational breakdowns and creative buildups in the form of apocalypses, mysticism, new religious movements, psychedelics, the Bible, Bob Dylan, and, of course, film. He regularly teaches \u201cReligion and Film\u201d at Truman and has overseen a number of student research theses that have contributed to the conversation about just why it is that movies capture our meaning-making imaginations in the way they do.\nThis sundance film festival review is available in Journal of Religion & Film: https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/ vol27/iss1/43"

            "text": "The phrase \u201ca still small voice\u201d is the King James Bible\u2019s rendering of 1 Kings 19:12, an\naccount of God\u2019s reassuring appearance to the prophet Elijah, who is exhausted and despairing after fleeing for his life from Ahab and Jezebel. In the film by that name, it\u2019s uttered by an elderly cancer patient to refer to how she has experienced a mental steeliness that quiets her anxiety in the face of difficulty. It is an inner resource that settles her, gives her direction, and lets her stick up for herself. As she awaits the results of more tests on her condition, she calmly listens for that voice to guide her in the days ahead.\nShe is relaying this account to Mati, who is, the opening text tells us, \u201ccompleting a\nresidency in spiritual care with a small cohort at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City,\u201d and it is Mati whom director Luke Lorentzen\u2019s film follows through the heartbreaking challenges of hospital spiritual care\u2014and in this case, all the more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mati herself is the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors and the daughter of a mother who left an\nPublished by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2023\nultra-Orthodox Jewish community, and thus has a complicated relationship with religion, especially when her cohort discusses the role of prayer in their work. One of her peers says, \u201cI can\u2019t do the work if I don\u2019t pray,\u201d but Mati struggles with not knowing \u201cwhere the prayers go,\u201d suggesting she is atheist or agnostic. Yet she seems to be driven by some need to convey a bigger and better reality\u2014a divinity\u2014to the patients in her care. Someone in the conversation articulates Mati\u2019s position in a way that she herself could not: \u201cReligion is a psychological crutch, but there\u2019s too much here that\u2019s nourishing\u201d to dismiss it completely.\nLater in the film, in consoling a woman who has suffered a major loss, Mati is able to\nexpress something authentic about death that comes out of her own father\u2019s sudden passing. She says, \u201cWhen a soul has finished its work in its current body, death is okay.\u201d But even that position raises any number of uncomfortable questions, most evident during a devastating sequence where Mati, a Jewish hospital chaplain, must perform an emergency baptism for a twin who is stillborn while her sister survived. The baptism honors the life the baby had within the mother\u2019s body, and the couple is nevertheless still bringing home a new child. Concluding the ritual, Mati acknowledges the irreconcilable difficulty of experiencing both tragedy and joy simultaneously: Grieving and celebrating together is \u201cone of the hardest things God has given us,\u201d she tells them.\nSadly, for Mati and her patients, much of the film documents the psychological toll the\nwork takes on her, despite the best efforts of her supervisor, Rev. David Fleenor, who struggles with his own exhaustion and failures. As Mati and David\u2019s professional relationship deteriorates, it starts to affect their ability to care for patients, themselves, and the other spiritual counselors. A running theme in David\u2019s supervisory sessions is Mati\u2019s inability\u2014or unwillingness\u2014to put up emotional boundaries with her patients, which Mati presents as an ethical issue early in the film. She seems clearly torn by the demands of the job, the needs of her patients, and her own\nhttps://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol27/iss1/43 DOI: https://doi.org/10.32873/uno.dc.jrf.27.01.43\nwellbeing. Mati is absolutely struggling to hear her own \u201cstill small voice\u201d in a way that will let her take care of all three aspects of her life with integrity.\nA Still Small Voice is a vital, distressing, and empathetic look at the pragmatic realities of\nspiritual counseling within what one of Mati\u2019s peers refers to as a health care system that \u201ccreates a real shitty experience around end of life.\u201d Unfortunately, even the valiant efforts to make the experience a little less shitty through spiritual care can put the caregiver in a position to be infected, as it were, by the despondency that permeates the system.\nPublished by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2023"
