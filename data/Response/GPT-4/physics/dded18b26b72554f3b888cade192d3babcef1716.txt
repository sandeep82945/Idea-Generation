Exploration of Other Metal Oxide Combinations: The significant findings regarding the synergistic effects of PANI with CeO2 and WO3 suggest that investigating other metal oxides might uncover further enhanced properties or new applications. Future studies could focus on identifying and characterizing nanocomposites with different metal oxides, potentially revealing novel sensing capabilities or improved performance metrics.

Long-term Stability and Durability Studies: While the current research highlights the enhanced sensitivity and linearity of PANI-based nanocomposites, there's a need to assess their long-term stability and durability in various environmental conditions. Research could focus on aging studies, exposure to harsh chemicals, and physical wear to determine the lifespan and reliability of these sensors in real-world applications.

Miniaturization and Integration into Wearable Devices: With the proven effectiveness of PANI/CeO2 and PANI/WO3 nanocomposites in sensing applications, there's potential for miniaturization and integration into wearable technology. Future research could explore developing compact, flexible sensors for health monitoring, environmental sensing, or food quality assessment, leveraging the thin film capabilities of these materials.

Investigation of the Interface between PANI and Metal Oxides: The interaction between PANI and metal oxides plays a crucial role in the enhanced performance of the nanocomposites. Detailed theoretical and experimental studies to understand the molecular interactions, electron transfer mechanisms, and structural compatibility could reveal insights into optimizing the composite formation for specific applications.

Development of Multi-analyte Sensors: Given the sensitivity of the PANI-based nanocomposites to pH changes, extending this research to detect other analytes, such as gases, ions, or biomolecules, could be fruitful. By modifying the composition or structure of the nanocomposites, researchers could design sensors capable of multi-analyte detection, offering broader applications in environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial process control.
