    "abstractText": "Patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) often suffer from cognitive decline. Accurate prediction of cognitive decline is essential for early treatment of at\u2010risk patients. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a multimodal machine learning model for the prediction of continuous cognitive decline in patients with early PD. We included 213 PD patients from the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Machine learning was used to predict change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score using the difference between baseline and 4\u2010years follow\u2010up data as outcome. Input features were categorized into four sets: clinical test scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain volumes, and genetic variants. All combinations of input feature sets were added to a basic model, which consisted of demographics and baseline cognition. An iterative scheme using RReliefF\u2010based feature ranking and support vector regression in combination with tenfold cross validation was used to determine the optimal number of predictive features and to evaluate model performance for each combination of input feature sets. Our best performing model consisted of a combination of the basic model, clinical test scores and CSF\u2010based biomarkers. This model had 12 features, which included baseline cognition, CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF total tau, CSF amyloid\u2010 beta1\u201042, geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores, and anxiety scores. Interestingly, many of the predictive features in our model have previously been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, showing the importance of assessing Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

Accurate prediction of cognitive decline is essential for early treatment of at\u2011risk patients. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a multimodal machine learning model for the prediction of continuous cognitive decline in patients with early PD. We included 213 PD patients from the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Machine learning was used to predict change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score using the difference between baseline and 4\u2011years follow\u2011up data as outcome. Input features were categorized into four sets: clinical test scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain volumes, and genetic variants. All combinations of input feature sets were added to a basic model, which consisted of demographics and baseline cognition. An iterative scheme using RReliefF\u2011based feature ranking and support vector regression in combination with tenfold cross validation was used to determine the optimal number of predictive features and to evaluate model performance for each combination of input feature sets. Our best performing model consisted of a combination of the basic model, clinical test scores and CSF\u2011based biomarkers. This model had 12 features, which included baseline cognition, CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF total tau, CSF amyloid\u2011 beta1\u201142, geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores, and anxiety scores. Interestingly, many of the predictive features in our model have previously been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, showing the importance of assessing Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a movement disorder that affects millions of people worldwide1. PD is primarily recognized by its motor symptoms. However, deficits in cognition such as memory impairment are noted even in the early stages of PD2,3. In some cases, these deficits can evolve rapidly and often result in dementia2,4,5. The ability to identify patients who are predisposed to cognitive decline at early stages of PD could enable early interventions, such as medication6,7, cognitive training8, neurostimulation9, physical exercise interventions10, or adaption of living conditions.\nThe cognitive spectrum in PD can be grouped into three categories: normal cognition (PD-NC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and dementia (PD-D)2. This categorization is often based on patient and caregiver report, cognitive test scores, and clinical judgement regarding the impact of cognitive decline on function11,12. Previous attempts to predict cognitive decline in PD have mainly focused on development of general cognitive\nOPEN\n1Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada. 2Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada. 3D\u00e9partement de Psychologie, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Pavillon Marie-Victorin, 90 Vincent d\u2019Indy Ave, Montreal, QC H2V 2S9, Canada. 4Centre de recherche de l\u2019Institut universitaire de g\u00e9riatrie de Montr\u00e9al, 4565 chemin Queen Mary, Montreal, QC H3W 1W5, Canada. 5Department of Radiology, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada. 6Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, and Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta, 7-112 Clinical Sciences Building 11350 83rd Avenue, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada. 7Alberta Children\u2019s Hospital Research Institute, Heritage Medical Research Building, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Dr. NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada. 8D\u00e9partement de radiologie, radio-oncologie et m\u00e9decine nucl\u00e9aire, Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Pavillon Roger-Gaudry, 2900 Boulevard. \u00c9douard-Montpetit, Montreal, QC H3T 1A4, Canada. 9Department of Psychiatry, University of Calgary, 3280 Hospital Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada. *email: Hannes.Almgren@ucalgary.ca\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:13193 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37644-6\nimpairment13,14, progression to dementia15, or MCI and dementia16. For example, Smith et\u00a0al.16 showed that a combination of clinical and brain morphological features performed well (AUC = 0.85) at predicting conversion from healthy cognition to PD-MCI or PD-D. Similarly, Shin et\u00a0al.15 showed that models integrating clinical features and cortical thickness outperformed models with only one feature in predicting conversion from PD-MCI to PD-D. Other studies have found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are also important predictors of cognitive decline in PD17,18. B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al.17, for instance, showed that adding CSF biomarkers to a clinical model increased the area under the curve (AUC) from 0.77 to 0.86. Other authors have developed models that include genetics for cognitive decline prediction in PD19,20. In a large-scale study, Liu et\u00a0al.20 showed that inclusion of GBA gene\u00a0mutations significantly increased the AUC in the validation set (from 0.827 to 0.854).\nAlthough categorization into MCI or dementia is useful, patients near cut-off thresholds might be misclassified, and sometimes symptom assessments are prone to subjective interpretation. Continuous cognitive scores could give more precise and specific information about a person\u2019s cognitive ability and individual risk21. As an alternative to binary classification, Caspell-Garcia et\u00a0al.22 attempted to identify biomarkers that can predict decline in continuous cognitive scores using longitudinal regression models. They found that cortical brain morphology (both volume and thickness) of specific brain areas, specific CSF biomarkers, and dopamine deficiency in the dorsal striatum were related to cognitive decline in people with early PD. However, they mainly restricted themselves to linear and logistic regression models, which may not be optimally suited to identify complex non-linear relationships in the data. More advanced machine learning methods enable the detection of patterns in high-dimensional data, and can be used to predict future outcomes in patients23. To date, machine learning has shown great promise for many precision medicine applications24. With respect to PD, machine learning has been used for predicting cognitive decline in PD after deep brain stimulation25, and conversion from PD-MCI to PD-D15.\nThe aim of this study was to develop, evaluate, and compare unimodal and multimodal machine learning models for the prediction of cognitive decline, as measured by change in continuous cognitive scores, in patients suffering from early PD using demographic, clinical, imaging, genetic, and CSF data."

Statistically significant positive associations with change in MoCA score (indicating that higher scores are related to less cognitive decline) were found for CSF amyloid-beta (t = 2.13; p = 0.018), while statistically significant negative relationships (indicating that higher scores are related to more cognitive decline) were found for baseline MoCA (t = \u2212 4.26; p = 0.00004), CSF total tau (t = \u2212 1.66; p = 0.049), total STAI scores (t = \u2212 1.73; p = 0.042), and autonomic dysfunction (t = \u2212 2.57; p = 0.005). The effect of CSF phosphorylated tau on MoCA change was close to significance (t = \u2212 1.64; p = 0.052). Results for all features are reported in Supplementary Table\u00a01."

            "text": "In this study we developed, compared, and evaluated unimodal and multimodal machine learning models to predict cognitive decline in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) over four years using a wide range of features from different modalities, including CSF biomarkers, genetics, regional brain volumes, and clinical test scores. Our best performing model included CSF markers and clinical test scores, in addition to simple demographics and baseline cognition. Commonly selected variables included CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF total tau, CSF amyloid-beta, geriatric depression scores, anxiety scores, sex, functional independence scores, autonomic dysfunction scores, daytime sleepiness, and CSF alpha-synuclein. The Pearson correlation between predicted and actual MoCA decline was 0.44, while the mean absolute error of the prediction was 2.11 in units of change in total MoCA score.\nThe best performing model included CSF-based biomarkers and clinical test scores, but no brain volumes or genetics data. The importance of CSF biomarkers is in line with the studies of B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al.17 and Siderowf et\u00a0al.18, who identified CSF amyloid-beta42 as a predictor of cognitive decline in PD. The importance of clinical test scores has been shown by both Shin et\u00a0al.15 and Smith et\u00a0al.16, who found that a combination of clinical test scores and brain structure is better at predicting conversion to dementia and MCI in PD compared to each set separately. The present study confirms that clinical test scores and CSF biomarkers are essential for the prediction of cognitive decline in PD. In contrast, brain volumes and genetics were not part of the best performing model in our study. One reason could be that genetics and CSF markers are associated (see, e.g., Kanekiyo et\u00a0al.26 for amyloid-beta and APOE \u03b54) which could make either of them redundant as a predictor. In contrast to genetics, CSF biomarkers measure the actual presence of protein pathology which might make them relatively more powerful in detecting and predicting cognitive decline. Similarly, hippocampal volume is known to be related to amyloid-beta pathology27,28, which could also make either of them a redundant feature. CSF biomarkers are likely a closer measure of underlying pathology compared to brain volumes that may not be as precise to determine, which could make them relatively more important for prediction of cognitive decline.\nFigure\u00a01.

CSF amyloid-beta42 has been found to be an important predictor for cognitive decline in PD in other studies17,18. Similarly, the results on phosphorylated and total tau are in line with other studies showing that tau pathology is related to dementia in PD29,30. Compta et\u00a0al.29, for instance, showed that Braak tau stages are significantly greater in PD with dementia compared to PD without dementia. This study also showed a negative correlation between Braak tau stages and cognitive performance in PD at the end of life. However, some studies did not identify CSF tau as a predictive feature of cognitive decline in PD18. CSF alpha-synuclein was also identified as a predictive feature in the majority of our cross-validation folds, which is in line with other research on dementia in PD showing an association between alpha-synuclein and Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia30. CSF alpha-synuclein was, however, a lower ranked predictor compared to the other CSF biomarkers.\nMost of the selected clinical features in our study have been previously identified in studies assessing correlates and predictors of cognitive decline in PD. Excessive daytime sleepiness has been found to be related to global cognition and specific cognitive functions, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally31. Moreover, depression has been identified as an important predictor of cognitive decline in PD20 and has been shown to be higher in converters to PD-MCI and PD-D compared to non-converters16. In the latter study, autonomic dysfunction was also found to be part of the optimal feature set16. Instrumental activities of daily living have been previously found to be related to executive function, attention deficits, and MCI32,33. Many of the predictive properties of clinical test scores have been related to impaired functional properties of the brain, such as altered neurotransmitter release and re-uptake. For instance, excessive daytime sleepiness has been linked to abnormal dopamine transporter binding in the caudate nucleus34. Acetylcholinesterase density was found to be decreased in the small intestine and pancreas of PD patients, potentially due to underlying issues with autonomic function (e.g., constipation;35). Instrumental activities of daily living have been shown to be sensitive to cholinesterase inhibitors36, suggesting a cholinergic underpinning. Finally, depression and anxiety have been associated with altered dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic mechanisms37. In the case of depression, some negative effects of motivation on cognitive test performance might also play a role38. Interestingly, pure motor scores (e.g., MDS-UPDRS part III) were not found to be part of the predictive feature set for cognitive decline in neither Smith et\u00a0al.16 nor in the present study, although UPDRS Part III was significantly higher in converters than in non-converters in Smith et\u00a0al.16 and was part of the predictive set in B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al.17.\nOur univariate analyses showed that CSF beta-amyloid was significantly associated with less cognitive decline, whereas higher baseline MoCA, CSF total tau, anxiety, and autonomic dysfunction were significantly related to more cognitive decline. Most of these results are in line with previous research2,16,27,28. Interestingly, we found a significant negative correlation between baseline MoCA and cognitive decline, indicating that participants with higher cognitive abilities showed the most cognitive decline over time. Several explanations are possible for this finding. It is possible that context-effects partly explain the negative relationship between baseline MoCA and change in MoCA scores. The presence of anxiety because of the new environment, or unfamiliarity with the test procedure, could have made some patients score lower at baseline, while in reality their baseline cognitive performance could have been higher than the test score indicated. We indeed found a slight negative correlation (r = -0.06) between state anxiety and baseline MoCA score (not reported in results). However, given the small magnitude of the correlation, this likely does not fully explain our observation. Regression-to-the-mean could also explain the predictive effect of baseline cognition21.\nIn summary, many of the predictive features of cognitive decline in PD identified in this work, such as CSF amyloid-beta, and tau pathology, have previously been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease39\u201341. Thus, our study adds to the body of evidence of an important pathological overlap between cognitive decline in PD and AD42\u201344.\nLimitations and future avenues. Our study sample focused on early PD, in which cognitive decline was found to be quite small in general. Moreover, test\u2013retest effects could have led to inflated MoCA scores at later timepoints45. Predictive performance and selected features in our models might be different in studies without annual repetition of the same task (PPMI assesses MoCA yearly). Future studies could focus on datasets with less repetition of cognitive tests, on tests with less practice effects, or could use datasets that show more cognitive decline, such as datasets that include participants at later stages of PD. Moreover, it is also important to focus on more precise measures of cognitive performance in future studies, possibly by combining multiple extensive cognitive tests. Multimodal imaging (e.g., including diffusion-weighted imaging) could also lead to improved predictive performance46. Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, also have the potential to improve predictive performance, provided large-scale data is available47,48. Finally, the generalizability of our results would ideally be assessed with an independent out-of-sample test set."

            "text": "Dataset and subjects. The data were obtained from the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative database (PPMI; https:// www. ppmi- info. org/). PPMI is an observational multi-center study that collects different types of longitudinal data (e.g., cognitive, clinical, T1-weighted MRI) from de novo PD patients without dementia and control subjects49. Each PPMI recruiting center received written informed consent from all the participants in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Each center also received ethics approval from their local ethics board. We do not have the name of the local ethics committees, as the dataset was acquired by PPMI. The present study was also approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary. We only included PD patients that met the following criteria: (1) a diagnosis of PD at the start of the study, (2) availability of a T1-weighted MRI scan and all features at baseline used in the present study, and (3) completeness of a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test score at baseline and approximately 4\u00a0years post-baseline (more precisely, between 3.5 and 4.5\u00a0years post-baseline). Supplementary Fig.\u00a01 shows a flowchart of subject selection and exclusion.\nCognitive assessment. Global cognitive ability was assessed at baseline and at follow-up using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). MoCA is a brief assessment that takes approximately ten minutes to complete, developed and used to detect MCI50. The primary outcome of our study was the difference in the total score between follow-up MoCA (acquired 3.5 to 4.5\u00a0years after baseline) and baseline MoCA scores. Here, negative values reflect a decline in test scores, while positive values reflect an improvement in test scores.\nMRI acquisition and processing. MRI acquisition. T1-weighted MRI images were acquired with scanners and scan sequences differing between the 23 PPMI acquisition sites. MRI scanner vendors used for the acquisition of the data in the present study included Siemens (134 subjects), GE (56 subjects), and Phillips (23 subjects). Magnetic field strength was either 3.0\u00a0T (119 subjects) or 1.5\u00a0T (94 subjects). Slice thickness varied between 1.0 and 2.0\u00a0mm, and almost all images were acquired in the sagittal orientation (92% of subjects).\nFreeSurfer processing. T1-weighted images were processed using FreeSurfer (version 7.1.1), which included removal of non-brain tissue, intensity normalization, tessellation of the grey/white matter borders, segmentation of subcortical structures, as well as cortical parcellation. Cortical volume was estimated for each of the 62 regions (31 per hemisphere) that are part of the Desikan\u2013Killiany\u2013Tourville (DKT) brain region atlas51 using standard automatic procedures (https:// surfer. nmr. mgh. harva rd. edu/ fswiki/ recon- all)52\u201355. Subcortical volumetry was estimated for 18 regions (see, Table\u00a02)56\u201359. Both cortical and subcortical volumetry was corrected for (i.e., divided by) total intracranial volume. Parcellation and segmentation results were visually checked and data showing mis-registration or mis-segmentations affecting the morphological analyses were excluded, which involved 10 subjects (for details see Supplementary Fig.\u00a01).\nFeature set. The full set of features extracted and available for our study is shown in Table\u00a02. The features included five demographic variables, baseline MoCA score, scores on eight clinical tests, four CSF biomarkers, volumes of 18 subcortical and 62 cortical regions (divided by total intracranial volume), total brain volume, and eight genetics variants. The five demographics were age, sex, years of education, handedness, and disease duration. Clinical tests included Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (REM-SBDQ), the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), MDS-UPDRS Part III, Modified Schwab & England Activities of Daily Living Score (MSEADL), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson\u2019s DiseaseAutonomic Dysfunction (total score; SCOPA-AUT), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (total score; STAI), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The four CSF biomarkers were amyloid-beta1-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau, and alpha-synuclein. We included genes that have been associated with cognitive decline in previous studies60. The genetic mutations we included as features were: APOE \u03b54, MAPT (rs17649553), GBA (N370S), BDNF (rs6265), COMT (val158met), LRRK2 (G2019S), SNCA (rs356181 and rs3910105). The input features were categorized into four sets consisting of clinical test scores, CSF-based markers, brain volumetry, and genetics, as well as a basic feature set including demographics and baseline cognition.\nThe outcome of our machine learning model was the difference in the total score between the follow-up and the baseline MoCA test.\nMachine learning pipeline. The machine learning pipeline used in this work consisted of an initial feature ranking followed by training of a support vector regression (SVR) model with a polynomial kernel (see Fig.\u00a02). The RReliefF algorithm, which is an extension of the ReliefF algorithm to regression problems61, was used for feature ranking. Briefly described, this method assigns a weight to each feature based on the extent to which its values can differentiate between different outcomes and based on the extent to which different features contain unique information62. Based on the RRelieFF feature ranking, the machine learning model was iteratively trained with reduced feature sets. More precisely, the least important feature was iteratively removed from the feature list used for training and evaluation of our machine learning models. Starting with the full set of ranked features, this procedure was repeated until only a single feature was left for training of each machine learning model. Feature ranking was performed individually for each machine learning model and was part of the crossvalidation (i.e., feature ranking was performed using the training set only) to prevent a potential double dipping.\nSupport vector regression models were trained and evaluated based on the ranked and selected features for the prediction of cognitive decline. Accuracy of the machine learning model for each subset of the features was assessed using tenfold cross validation. All combinations of the four feature sets (i.e., clinical test scores, CSF\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:13193 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37644-6\nbiomarkers, genetics, and brain volumes) were added to the basic model (consisting of demographics and baseline cognition) to form the input feature sets that were compared. The optimal combination of input feature sets and the optimal number of features were determined using the R2 metric.\nStatistical analyses. We explored univariate linear relationships between the predictors in our machine learning model and change in MoCA score. Permutation-tests for linear models with 50,000 permutations were used to determine statistical significance. Each linear model had one feature as predictor and change in MoCA score as outcome. We used one-sided tests for effects for which we had a prior expectation of the direction, which was positive for activities of daily living (i.e., more independence would implicate less decline) and CSF amyloidbeta, and negative for CSF phosphorylated and total tau, geriatric depression scores, anxiety scores, daytime sleepiness scores, and autonomic dysfunction. Two-sided tests were used for features for which we did not have a prior expectation, which were baseline MoCA, CSF alpha-synuclein, and sex. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nTable 2.
