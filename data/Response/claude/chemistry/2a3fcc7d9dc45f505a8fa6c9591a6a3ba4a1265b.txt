 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Further optimize PLE conditions for maximum recovery of all polyphenol classes from Hibiscus sabdariffa. Vary additional parameters like number of extraction cycles, flush volume, etc. 

2. Conduct bioavailability studies in animal models and humans to determine the uptake, metabolism and biological effects of Hibiscus polyphenols extracted by PLE. 

3. Investigate the mechanisms by which Hibiscus polyphenols modulate gut microbiota composition and impact obesity/metabolic diseases using in vitro gut models. 

4. Formulate polyphenol-rich Hibiscus extracts into functional foods/beverages and test their effects on obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health in randomized controlled human trials.

5. Identify the specific polyphenol compounds and metabolites responsible for the beneficial health effects of Hibiscus extracts using bioassay-guided fractionation. Elucidate their mechanisms of action.
