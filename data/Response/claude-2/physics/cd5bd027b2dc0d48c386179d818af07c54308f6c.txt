 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of using different polymers besides polyvinyl alcohol in the composite synthesis. Trying other polymers could lead to composites with different properties and catalytic performance. 

2. Vary the nickel content in the composites and study how this impacts the size and distribution of nickel nanoparticles formed, as well as the catalytic activity. This could help optimize the nickel loading.

3. Conduct more detailed characterization of the carbon nanotubes formed during methane decomposition over the composites, using techniques like Raman spectroscopy. This could provide insight into nanotube structure and growth mechanisms.

4. Test the composites for other catalytic reactions beyond methane decomposition, such as hydrogenation or reforming reactions. The composites may show promise for different applications.

5. Explore modifications to the composite synthesis method, such as using other nickel precursors besides nickel nitrate, or adding other metals. This could lead to composites with tuned properties and reactivity.
