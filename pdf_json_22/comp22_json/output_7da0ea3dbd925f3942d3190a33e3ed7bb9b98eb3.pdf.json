    "abstractText": "This work presents a fast direct solver strategy for electromagnetic integral equations in the high-frequency regime. The new scheme relies on a suitably preconditioned combined field formulation and results in a single skeleton form plus identity equation. This is obtained after a regularization of the elliptic spectrum through the extraction of a suitably chosen equivalent circulant problem. The inverse of the system matrix is then obtained by leveraging the Woodbury matrix identity, the low-rank representation of the extracted part of the operator, and fast circulant algebra yielding a scheme with a favorable complexity and suitable for the solution of multiple right-hand sides. Theoretical considerations are accompanied by numerical results both of which are confirming and showing the practical relevance of the newly developed scheme.",

INTRODUCTION Integral equation strategies are effective for solving scattering and radiation problems over a wide range of frequencies since they do not require absorbing boundary conditions, they are free from numerical dispersion, and they only require the discretization of the surfaces of the scatterers and the radiators. Unfortunately, matrices arising from their discretization are dense and have dimensions that grow for increasing frequencies. Naive solutions would scale cubically with the number of unknowns and easily jeopardize the advantages of integral equation approaches. Fast matrix-vector multiplication algorithms [1] can substantially decrease this computational burden, but they require iterative solutions, which renders them less attractive when many right-hand sides (RHSs) must be considered. An alternative is the use of fast direct solvers that are building, in reduced complexity, directly the inverse of the system matrix and are efficient for solving problems with multiple RHSs. There are several effective strategies for direct solutions that often rely on hierarchical decompositions both for problems in the low- and in the high-frequency regimes (see [2]\u2013[4] and references therein).\nIn this work, we leverage a different approach. We first precondition the combined field integral equation (CFIE) in\nThis work has been funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (ERC project 321, grant No.724846) and by the ANR Labex CominLabs under the project \u201cCYCLE\u201d.\na suitable way [5]. We then exploit the particular structure of the preconditioned spectrum to separate its principal part contribution and compress its remainder. This is made practical by extracting an equivalent circulant problem, which has the advantage of automatically extracting the principal part contribution and the remainder is compressed in favorable complexity. This results in a non-hierarchical scheme in which a single skeleton form is required and the solution for several RHSs can be obtained efficiently. Theoretical considerations are matched with numerical results confirming and showing the practical relevance of the new scheme."

Note that for ease of reading the singular values are ordered by the Fourier content of their singular vectors. This suggests that selecting the singular vectors corresponding to this region of maximal spectral strength and filtering out the deviation from the halved identity of the others would lead to a compression of the electromagnetic operator in the high frequency regime\u2014in which the discretization parameter is kept at a fixed proportion of the wavelength. In particular, this would correspond to searching the solution in the space of corrections to the RHS in (5) of the form s 7\u2192M(s)eiks, with M(s) slowly varying."

However, the discretization error in the elliptic part of the spectrum can interfere with this approach. The discretization will cause a constant (O(1)) error in the elliptic spectrum for first kind preconditioned operators (see Fig. 3). There are\nseveral strategies to overcome this problem. Here we opted for subtracting an equivalent circular problem from the operators defined on \u03b3. This will, in practice, extract the second kind part of the original operators, leaving only a compact operator for which the relative error (with respect to the identity) will be decreasing."

A close inspection of the spectrum of C (Fig. 3) reveals that the spectral corruption caused by the discretization error poses a real challenge for compression purposes, since they would artificially increase the rank of the compression if the lookedfor accuracy was too high (the limit case is indicated by the red lines in the figure). On the contrary, the elliptic spectrum of (C\u2212Cc) (Fig. 4) does not remain constant, but it decreases for the high spatial frequencies, which makes it an ideal candidate for applying the proposed compression scheme. Fig. 5 shows the behavior of the inner rank of the skeleton in (7) that shows a growth not larger than k 1 3 (which is a bound that can be theoretically predicted for the circular case). This provides in this case an upper bound for the computational complexity not larger than O(N 4 3 ) where in practice lower complexities can be obtained given that for a constant truncation error on the matrix the accuracy of the solution increases with frequency, as can be seen in Fig. 5. Thus, the effectiveness of the scheme is ensured in the high-frequency regime."
