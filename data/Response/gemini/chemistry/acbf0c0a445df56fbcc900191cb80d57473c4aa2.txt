1. **Investigate the use of other soft sensor techniques for product composition estimation.** PCR is just one of many soft sensor techniques that could be used for this purpose. Other techniques, such as partial least squares regression (PLS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), may be able to provide more accurate or robust estimates.
2. **Develop inferential ADRC control schemes for other types of distillation columns.** The proposed control scheme was applied to a methanol-water separation column, but it could be adapted to other types of distillation columns, such as those used for separating other binary or multicomponent mixtures.
3. **Investigate the use of inferential ADRC control for other process control applications.** Inferential ADRC control is not limited to product composition control in distillation columns. It could be applied to other process control applications where it is difficult or expensive to measure the primary controlled variables.
4. **Develop online adaptive inferential ADRC control schemes.** The proposed control scheme is based on static soft sensor models. However, it could be extended to use online adaptive soft sensor models that can update themselves in real time as the process operating conditions change.
5. **Investigate the use of inferential ADRC control for nonlinear distillation processes.** The proposed control scheme was applied to a linear distillation process. However, it could be extended to nonlinear distillation processes, such as those that occur in batch distillation or reactive distillation.
