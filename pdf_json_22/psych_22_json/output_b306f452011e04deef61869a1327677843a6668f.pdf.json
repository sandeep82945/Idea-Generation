    "abstractText": "Background The use of panic alarm systems for victims of domestic abuse is becoming increasingly popular. However, tests of these devices are rare. Consequently, it is presently unknown whether domestic abuse offenders are deterred by warning stickers informing them that a panic alarm system is installed on the premises, or whether alarm systems reduce domestic abuse recidivism. There is also a lack of data regarding whether adding an audio-recording feature to the panic alarm results in more prosecutions of domestic abuse offenders compared to standard panic alarm systems. Measuring the efficacy of warning stickers and audio recordings will enhance understanding of the overall effectiveness of panic alarm systems for domestic abuse. Methods This study used a pre-test-post-test, control group design, in which 300 eligible high-risk domestic abuse victims in London, UK, were randomly allocated to either a standard panic alarm system or a panic alarm system with audio-recording capabilities and a red warning sticker on a durable, A6-size sign displayed at eye level at the entrance to the premises. Each sticker was well lit to ensure maximum visibility. The gain scores of multiple measures at 6  months prior and 6  months post-randomisation were used to assess the treatment effects (including the number of calls for service, recorded crimes, and harm score), and a negative binomial generalised linear model was utilised to estimate the likelihood of criminal charges for domestic abuse offenders in the two systems. Outcomes Pre-post comparisons of recidivism suggested an overall reduction in both treatment arms, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two types of alarm systems across these crime measures. Nevertheless, the estimation model indicated a significant 57% increase in charges using the audiorecording alarm relative to the standard panic alarm system. Conclusions Using deterrent stickers to warn domestic abuse offenders of panic alarm systems does not lead to a reduction in subsequent harm to victims. Compared to ordinary panic alarms for high-risk domestic abuse victims, audio-recording Extended author information available on the last page of the article 596 W. Hodgkinson et al. 1 3 systems provide valuable evidence that increases subsequent charges, and thus, these systems should be explored further.",

In the same period, 124 victims of domestic homicide were recorded, giving an average of one homicide every 3\u00a0days (ONS 2020). Additionally, the cost of DA was estimated to be \u00a366 billion in 2017 (Oliver et\u00a0al., 2019). Given the concerning figures associated with DA, it is surprising that there is a lack of high-quality quantitative research focused on police practices for active crime prevention and target hardening.\nOne method for assisting high-risk victims of DA is through technology such as panic alarms (Blackstone et\u00a0al., 2020; Hakim et\u00a0al., 1995). For eligible victims at risk of further victimisation, a system that is directly linked to the police can be installed in their homes. Upon activation, emergency assistance can be provided directly to the victim, thus circumventing the usual call for service. However, the effectiveness of panic alarms in preventing subsequent harm to DA victims is largely unknown.\nIn this study, we report the results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effectiveness of a novel panic alarm system compared with the national standard panic alarm system for England and Wales. More specifically, we examine whether an alarm system that is advertised through entry point stickers and includes an audio-recording capability reduces repeat victimisation and harm suffered and improves the criminal justice outcomes when used by high-risk DA victims compared to a system without audio recording or a warning sticker. It is important to note that both types of panic alarms are silent to ensure comparability across the treatment and control groups.\nThis RCT is set in London, UK, within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) during 2020. Our design incorporates a simple trickle-flow RCT across 13 MPS boroughs. The identification of suitable cases begins when an officer detects a high-risk DA victim who would benefit from a panic alarm. If the DA victim agrees to the intervention, they would then be randomly assigned to either a national standard alarm or an audio-recording alarm with a visual warning sticker. Therefore, our experiment assesses two types of outcomes, including prevention through the warning sticker and the ability to record crime, as well as evidence-gathering to prosecute in otherwise difficult cases."

            "text": "To determine the methods that reduce harm and repeat victimisation in high-risk DA, it is essential to understand the differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary crime prevention. Primary crime prevention is focused on the whole population,\n597\n1 3\nComparing panic alarm systems for\u00a0high\u2011risk domestic abuse\u2026\nwhereas secondary crime prevention is more targeted and focuses on those at greater risk. Tertiary crime prevention concentrates on those who have already been victimised (Radford et\u00a0 al., 2011). The police are involved in prevention at the secondary and tertiary levels after at least one report has been made to them. Reports to the police of first-time DA involving intimate partners are usually the last instance of DA reported to them (Sherman & Berk, 1984). Indeed, most reported DA, particularly of the highharm type, occurs without any prior contact with the police and without additional reported incidents (Bland & Ariel, 2015; Bridger et\u00a0al., 2017).1 Furthermore, efforts led by Thornton (2017), Chalkey and Strang (2017), Button et\u00a0al. (2017), and Barnham et\u00a0al. (2017) to identify risk factors based on police records concluded that the majority of severe DA cases came \u2018out of the blue\u2019 with no prior police awareness about the dyads, hence the difficulty in primary prevention. Overall, it seems that the risk factors with the most robust prediction validity for subsequent, future DA are the offender\u2019s prior suicidal ideation, stalking, and separation from their partner (see Bland & Ariel, 2020; Goussinsky & Yassour-Borochowitz, 2012), but these factors are mostly not found within police records. Therefore, the focus on effective methods for preventing DA harm by the police is on a specific subgroup of DA dyads for whom at least one incident was reported to the police and potential for re-victimisation exists (Sherman et\u00a0al., 2017)."

            "text": "Personal and property alarms are a widely used tactic aimed at reducing levels of offending or harm. For example, in the USA, approximately 17 million intruder and fire alarms have been installed (Hakim et\u00a0 al., 1995). However, their effectiveness has been questioned, with 94\u201399% of police responses resulting from false alarms (Blackstone et\u00a0 al., 2020; see also Gaines & Bichler, 2007). Nevertheless, burglar alarms remain \u2018the most effective deterring and detecting measure for burglary\u2019 (Blackstone et\u00a0al., 2020; see also Scott, 2006; however cf. Knutsson, 1984).\nIn terms of DA prevention, personal panic alarms linked directly to the police have been widely used in the UK, but there is a lack of strong evidence supporting their scope and effectiveness (see more broadly Perkins et\u00a0 al., 2017). The use of panic alarms for DA was first documented by Farrell and Pease (1993) as a basic system that worked with landlines and \u2018alarm pendants\u2019, through which automated calls were made to the local police station when the alarm was triggered. However, Walker (2001) examined the effectiveness of panic alarms for preventing repeat victimisation and harm for DA victims and found a minimal deterrent effect on perpetrators, and there have been few rigorous replications of this study (Berry et\u00a0 al., 2014; Breckenridge et\u00a0 al., 2015). One study by Tumen and Ulucan (2019) in Turkey reported an increased likelihood of physical domestic violence against women equipped with panic alarms relative to a synthetic control group, possibly\n1 However, we note that such conclusions are based on official crime data rather than self-reported incidents, so \u2018first-time\u2019 and \u2018last-time\u2019 definitions are unlikely to provide information about the entire abuse cycle. Differentiating between the two data sources is important, as much of domestic abuse goes unreported.\n598 W.\u00a0Hodgkinson et al.\n1 3\ndue to a \u2018male backlash\u2019 against the empowerment of women from particular socioeconomic backgrounds (Y\u00fcksel & Ulucan, 2021). However, we are unaware of any other published studies to this effect.\nMoreover, mobile alert systems represent a similar technology to panic alarms. Specifically, the primary difference is that they operate outside of the home and use the global positioning system (GPS) to inform officers of the victim\u2019s location. Investigating this technology in England and Wales, Natarajan (2016) reported case studies in which rapid responses made possible by mobile alert system activations reduced the risk of repeat victimisation. However, to our knowledge, systematic evidence on the effectiveness of these devices under controlled settings is limited."

            "heading": "Warning notifications",
            "text": "A common preventative tactic against crime is the use of warning stickers to deter offenders from entering the premises. Such low-cost tactics are designed to alert offenders of a heightened risk of apprehension by police (Raphael, 2015). Indeed, these devices are commonly used for protection from domestic or commercial burglary, with varying degrees of success (Kyvsgaard & Sorensen, 2021; Laycock, 1985). In this regard, whilst reductions in burglaries and break-and-enters have been observed, these reductions were limited to the beginning of the study\u2019s observation period (Kyvsgaard & Sorensen, 2021). Additionally, the effect is not ubiquitous across all crime types, such as the consumption of restricted alcohol and drugs (Mackinnon, 1995). We are unaware of previous evaluations of the use of stickers by the police to prevent DA offenders from harming their victims either in their abodes or other areas.\nGiven the paucity of research in this area of policing, it is useful to examine the informative evidence from other disciplines. Whilst pictorial warnings have been found to effectively increase the intention to quit smoking compared to text warnings alone (Brewer et\u00a0al., 2016), warning stickers on prescription medicines often fail to attract the attention of the older population (Guy, 2012). An earlier study by Jones and Nowell (1973) identified a link between the colour of visual cues and physiological responses, suggesting that not all warning signs have the same effect. Furthermore, Cohen and Sloan (2016) as well as Nevo et\u00a0 al. (2010) documented that strong visual contrast is needed in visual cues because individuals\u2019 gaze is drawn and attracted to stimulus changes. Therefore, whilst stickers have been widely used to deter unwanted behaviours, evidence exists to both support and oppose the hypothesis that warnings ubiquitously affect choices to comply with certain rules."

Therefore, we do not have counterfactual conditions, as it would be unethical to deprive DA victims of the immediate protection provided by panic alarms. Conversely, this study investigates the relative effect of a novel system incorporating both a warning sticker outside the victim\u2019s premises and audio-recording capabilities compared with the existing \u2018call for immediate assistance-only\u2019 panic alarms.

Analysis of DA victimisation focused on the 6-month period prior to and following panic alarm request. The study ended on 27 November 2020. It is important to note that the pretest took place during the period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the post-test took place after the pandemic, which has direct implications for the external and internal validity of the study, especially the pre-post only comparisons. During this period, there were lockdowns in the UK that confined many individuals to their houses, thus changing not only crime but also police response to crime, including domestic abuse (see Nivette et\u00a0al., 2021; Walklate et\u00a0al., 2022)."

Following this, an engineer was instructed to install either an RDA2 or an RDA3 within 24\u00a0h of random allocation. Additionally, those who received an RDA3 also received an RDA2 as a backup in the event that the RDA3 failed to operate.\nThe alarm systems are a handheld \u2018fob\u2019 with two buttons, and both buttons had to be pressed simultaneously for 2\u00a0s to activate the alarm. Activation of the audio alarm generated the same immediate dispatch of a police unit to the victim\u2019s abode as the standard alarm. However, for the audio alarm, the call type detailed on the message was \u2018Audible Panic Alarm Activation\u2019 as opposed to \u2018Panic Alarm\u2019. Upon activation in an emergency situation (i.e., when the suspect appeared at the home of the victim), operatives in a control room received an alert with pre-recorded details of the location, victim, and case type, and a Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) reference was then generated. The CAD was passed to a dispatcher operating within the defined BCU area, and the dispatcher communicated the need for an immediate response to the pre-assigned location due to a high-risk DA alarm activation. A police unit was then dispatched to the location on an immediate grade (I Grade, which has a 15-min response time attached) call, and the responding officers were directed to turn on their body-worn video (BWV) cameras. The process of dispatching officers to the victim was similar in both experimental arms, except officers responding to addresses with an RDA3 were also informed that an audio recording would be available, and they were required to review the recording at the scene.\nUnique features of the RDA3 system The primary difference between the two systems is that the RDA3 also records audio within the household following activation. Furthermore, the RDA3 technology was accompanied by visual warning stickers, which informed people entering the property that audio-recording technology was present at the address. The signage was large enough to be noticeable during both day and night, was positioned at eye level on the front door of the victim\u2019s home (usually apartment), and was bright red in colour to attract attention. Therefore, the RDA3 treatment arm possessed five key elements that were not present in the RDA2 treatment arm:\n1. The capturing of audio recording within the address from the time of alarm activation\u00a0and 15 minutes of audio prior to activation. 2. The ongoing recording and review until police arrival. 3. The notification to police that audio recording was taking place and would be\navailable for review. 4. The presence of deterrent stickers at points of access to the property. 5. Governance to ensure that investigating officers were aware of the presence of\naudio evidence.\n601\n1 3\nComparing panic alarm systems for\u00a0high\u2011risk domestic abuse\u2026"

CRIS data are often inaccurate as the same victim can be inputted with slightly different name spellings. Indeed, unlike countries such as the USA, the UK does not have a system to identify individuals using a unique ID number. This issue meant that accurate data could not be easily retrieved from a simple search of the CRIS. To overcome this challenge, searches were completed using the victim\u2019s forename, surname, date of birth, and address, as well as the same corresponding categories for the offender. The data search parameters covered offences against the victim in the 6\u00a0 months prior to and the 6\u00a0 months after the alarm request.\nThe second data source, CMS, contained information on the alarm unit reference numbers, date of request, date of installation, sticker placement, any alarm installation refusals, and the reason for refusals. CMS was the system used before police dispatch via CAD. CMS captures all call demands to the MPS and categorises demand based on caller type."

For each case, we measured the number of emergency calls 6\u00a0months pre- and 6\u00a0months post-random assignment.\nCrimes Once a call for service incident is \u2018crimed\u2019 by a police officer, it is registered as a crime on CRIS. Not all calls for service are crimed due to misclassification or a lack of evidence. CRIS data are considered more precise than calls for service, as more investigatory efforts are applied to the incident. However, these data were filtered using search terms in the database and, as a result, susceptible to human errors. We observed both DA crimes and all other crimes at 6\u00a0 months pre- and post-random assignment. It should be mentioned that a thorough investigation was\n602 W.\u00a0Hodgkinson et al.\n1 3\nconducted for every call for service and, following this, a flagged DA was applied to the CRIS database accordingly.\nHarm There are different approaches to estimating the harm caused by a given crime (see recent review in Qureshi et\u00a0 al. (2021)). One recent approach involves employing the Cambridge Crime Harm Index (CCHI), which uses the England and Wales sentencing guidelines to attribute harm to crimes based upon the number of prison days; higher values on the CCHI indicate that more harm is assumed to be caused by that crime category (see Sherman et\u00a0al. (2017) for further details). Crime harm measures such as the CCHI present objective measurements of crime harm that are unaffected by the biases of victim reporting and sentences meted out by judges. Using this measure of crime harm at 6\u00a0months pre- and post-intervention allowed us to observe variations in harm scores.\nCharges The count of charges was measured post-random assignment only. We could not compute pre-test scores because many cases would have continued over the treatment period, as the decision to pass the case to the Crown Prosecution Services can take a long time. Higher levels of this output variable are interpreted as a positive change, as the treatment arm in which a charge is recorded means the case had sufficient evidence to press charges. It is important to mention that charges are recorded on the crime report system CRIS and are not a court outcome; in the UK context, charges represent the decision that there is a probable but not definite prospect of conviction.\nAlarm activations The number of activations post-randomisation was counted in each treatment arm to determine the extent of the use of the devices by victims."

For each study group, we computed the pre-test-post-test gain scores and then conducted independent sample t-tests between the two treatment arms on these gain scores. The scores were normally distributed (see Supplementary Materials A). We supplemented these analyses with Cohen\u2019s d and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate the magnitude of the differences between the two treatment groups.\nFurthermore, we modelled the likelihood of charging by predicting the number of charges in each arm based on group and including the activation of the alarm device as a covariate. Given the count distribution of the outcome variable and the overdispersed nature of charges (i.e., mostly nil counts), we used a negative binomial generalised linear model with robust estimators.

These results demonstrate that both the RDA2 (t(149) = \u2212 7, p < 0.001) and RDA3 (t(149) = \u2212 7.4, p < 0.001) groups showed statistically significant reductions in DA crime reports.\nThe total crime harm for the post-intervention period was 96,371.75, giving an overall reduction in crime harm of 80.8% or \u2212 321.2 per victim. Whereas victims in the RDA2 treatment group had a before-after harm reduction of 85.1% (\u2212 54,493.25; \u2212 362.34 reports per victim), those in the RDA3 group had a\n1 3\nbefore-after reduction of 75.9% (\u2212 41,878.5; \u2212 279.2 reports per victim). The RDA2 (t(149) = \u2212 5.1, p < 0.001) and RDA3 (t(149) = \u2212 4.1, p < 0.001) groups both demonstrated statistically significant reductions in crime harm. With regard to DA, there was a total before-after reduction of 83.1% (\u2212 97,881.2; \u2212 326.04 per victim).\n605\n1 3\nComparing panic alarm systems for\u00a0high\u2011risk domestic abuse\u2026\nThose in the RDA2 group had an 88.5% reduction (55,616.72; \u2212 370.78 reports per victim), whilst those in the RDA3 group had a 76.9% reduction in crime harm (\u2212 42,264.5; \u2212 281.19 reports per victim). Overall, the RDA2 (t(149) = \u2212 5.32, p < 0.001) and RDA3 (t(149) = \u2212 4.11, p < 0.001) groups both showed statistically significant reductions in crime harm.\nFinally, Table\u00a03 presents the calls for service by caller type. The number of victim callers reduced by 37.2% and 42.6% for RDA2 and RDA3, respectively. Concurrently, the number of other caller types in both groups increased from the pre-intervention to\n606 W.\u00a0Hodgkinson et al.\n1 3\nthe post-intervention period. The number of calls increased by 51 in the RDA3 treatment group, giving a mean increase of + 0.34 per victim, whilst the number of calls increased by 21 CFS in the RDA2 treatment group, giving a mean increase of + 0.14 per victim. Neither of these increases were statistically significant (RDA2: t(149) = 0.33,\n607\n1 3\nComparing panic alarm systems for\u00a0high\u2011risk domestic abuse\u2026\np = 0.74; RDA3: t(149) = 0.72, p = 0.47). With regard to police units deployed, a slight mean reduction was observed in the RDA3 group (\u2212 0.04 per victim), whilst there was a small increase for the RDA2 group (0.31 per victim). Neither of these changes between the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods were statistically significant (RDA2: t(149) = 0.6, p = 0.56; RDA3: t(149) = \u2212 0.06, p = 0.95)."

As shown, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups across all crime measures. Considering the before-after comparisons reported above, the between-group variations were similar and did not indicate significant gains for one system compared to the other in terms of calls for service to the police, total crimes, DA crimes, CHI, or CHI for DA.\nFrom a substantive perspective, it is clear that the magnitude of the differences between the two groups is minimal across all crime outcome measures, with marginal to small effect sizes throughout that are predominantly located near the null line (Cohen, 1980). Indeed, this suggests that neither treatment is preferable for reducing repeat calls for service to the police, recorded crimes, and harm scores.\nModelling likelihood of\u00a0charges based on\u00a0RDA2 and\u00a0RDA3 activations\nIn total, the trial generated 153 alarm activations from 77 discrete victims out of a total of 300 participants. RDA3 victims activated their alarms 93 times, whilst those in the RDA2 group made 60 activations. Importantly, alarm activations in the post-intervention period resulted in 28 charges, with 10 and 18 in the RDA2 and RDA3 groups, respectively.\nOur statistical model (Table\u00a0 5) suggests a significant effect of RDA3 treatment compared to RDA2, with substantial gains in charges (B = \u2212 1.377, standard error [SE] = 0.652, p = 0.035), as well as statistically significant interaction term between\n608 W.\u00a0Hodgkinson et al.\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 4\nP re\n-te st-\npo st-\nte st\nbe tw\nee n-\ngr ou\np ga\nin sc\nor es\n: t ot\nal c\nrim es\n, D A\nc rim\nes , h\nar m\n, D A\nh ar\nm , a\nnd c\nal ls\nfo r s\ner vi\nce\nC C\nH I C\nam br\nid ge\nC rim\ne H\nar m\nIn de\nx, D\nA do\nm es\ntic a\nbu se\n, C I c\non fid\nen ce\nin te\nrv al\n, R D\nA2 n\non -r\nec or\ndi ng\na la\nrm , R\nD A3\na ud\nio -r\nec or\ndi ng\na la\nrm\nN M\nea n\nSt d.\nd ev\nia tio\nn St\nd. e\nrr or\nm ea\nn t\np d\n95 %\nC I\nC rim\nes R\nD A\n2 15\n0 \u2212\n1. 01\n1. 94\n2 0.\n15 9\n0. 23\n1 0.\n81 7\n0. 02\n7 \u2212\n0. 20\n0 0.\n25 3\nR D\nA 3\n15 0\n\u2212 1.\n07 2.\n04 9\n0. 16 7 D A c rim e R D A 2 15 0 \u2212 1. 02 1. 77 4 0. 14\n5 0.\n10 0\n0. 92\n0 0.\n01 2\n\u2212 0.\n21 5\n0. 23 8 R D A 3 14 9 \u2212 1. 04 1. 71 6 0. 14 1\nC C\nH I\nR D\nA 2\n15 0\n\u2212 36\n3. 29\n87 2.\n76 2\n71 .2\n61 \u2212\n0. 85\n5 0.\n39 3\n\u2212 0.\n09 9\n\u2212 0.\n32 5\n0. 12 8 R D A 3 15 0 \u2212 27 9. 19 82 9. 40 2 67 .7 20\nD A\nC C\nH I\nR D\nA 2\n15 0\n\u2212 37\n0. 78\n85 4.\n33 0\n69 .7\n56 \u2212\n0. 88\n8 0.\n37 5\n\u2212 0.\n10 3\n\u2212 0.\n33 0\n0. 12 4 R D A 3 14 9 \u2212 28 3. 66 84 1. 13 7 68 .9 09\nC al\nls fo\nr s er\nvi ce\nR D\nA 2\n15 0\n0. 14\n5. 18\n5 0.\n42 3\n\u2212 0.\n31 5\n0. 75\n3 \u2212\n0. 03\n6 \u2212\n0. 26\n3 0.\n19 0\nR D\nA 3\n15 0\n0. 34\n5. 79\n6 0.\n47 3\n609\n1 3\nComparing panic alarm systems for\u00a0high\u2011risk domestic abuse\u2026\ntreatment condition and system activation, with those in the RDA3 group being more likely to activate their alarm and to result in a charge (B = 0.793, SE = 0.34, p = 0.021).

            "text": "This study aimed to examine the effects of two types of panic alarm systems on a number of outcomes for DA victims. Overall, the between-group comparisons in this study suggest no substantive or statistically significant treatment effects on crime counts, DA crime counts, crime harm (CCHI), DA harm (CCHI), calls for service, or the overall number of police units deployed. With a good sample size and relatively sufficient follow-up for each unit, our study suggests that neither system of panic alarms for DA victims produces greater prevention effects. RDA3 is an alarm system that aims to deter DA offenders via a visible sticker at the entrance to the premises warning them that an audio-recording system is present, but this system does not seem to generate a significant deterrent effect and, thus, provides no apparent benefit in terms of prevention. In contrast to our hypothesised effect, notifying DA offenders with stickers about the presence of a panic alarm system does not result in further reduction of harm to DA victims. Indeed, the very least we can conclude is that neither system is worse relative to the other.\nAt the same time, our model suggests a relatively strong and clinically significant effect of RDA3 in terms of providing evidence that can then be used in criminal charges against DA offenders. Relative to RDA2, which does not have recording capabilities, RDA3 produced a 57% increase in charges. We interpret this finding as carrying crucial practical significance, especially given the low rates of prosecution for DA. In this regard, the audio evidence assisted police in providing additional evidence linking the offender to the scene based on voice recognition. This incriminating evidence is commonly unavailable in DA crimes, which makes prosecuting offenders very difficult (Petersen et\u00a0al., 2021), Therefore, if evidence captured at the scene can be used to bring DA offenders to justice, the implications are far-reaching, despite the fact that subsequent harm was not prevented above and beyond the effects of the non-recording RDA2 system.\n610 W.\u00a0Hodgkinson et al.\n1 3\nAlthough before-after designs are weaker than others in terms of methodological rigour, the findings suggest strong before-after effects of both alarm systems, with significant reductions in subsequent reporting and recording of crime, as well as harm to DA victims. A more conclusive finding regarding the efficacy of panic alarms requires the estimation of treatment effects compared with no-treatment groups, which were not feasible in the present experiment. Indeed, other factors may explain the substantial reductions observed in the before-after comparisons (e.g., incapacitation of the offenders, deterrence of the offenders by police actions, selfprotection by the victims, or greater care by the police). However, if some of the reduction in harm to victims can be attributed to the panic alarms, then we recommend testing the use of these systems with more victims than those presently given these devices. Overall, further experiments, preferably with more diverse populations of DA types, are therefore warranted."

            "text": "Taken together, our evidence suggests that there is an overall reduction in DA once any panic alarm system is introduced. At the same time, the substantial reductions across all measures could be explained by any number of covariates, including differences in crime patterns during the COVID-19 period (see Nivette et\u00a0al., 2021); police deterrence (see Sherman, 1998); termination of the relationship; capacity for independence within a wider context of sociodemographic, economic, and cultural factors; and other legal instruments such as protection orders (Dowling et\u00a0al., 2018). As a result, we cannot robustly conclude an overall treatment effect with this prepost-only design (see review in Sect.\u00a04 in Ariel et\u00a0al. (2022)), and more sophisticated methodologies are needed. However, if our causal estimates are valid, then panic alarms of any kind may represent a useful instrument in the prevention of subsequent harm to DA victims who are deemed as high-risk cases by the police.\nTaking our before-after findings at face value, our study contradicts Tumen and Ulucan\u2019s (2019) study, which found an increased likelihood of physical domestic violence against Turkish women equipped with panic alarms. Differences may be attributed to contextual differences in households and families between the UK and Turkey, differences in experimental designs (synthetic control group versus beforeafter only comparisons), the type of technology used, and cultural differences between the participants. These inconsistencies call for more research in this sphere, given the mixed results of the two studies.\nFurthermore, we had no access to the audio recordings from the RDA3 panic alarms, and, thus, cannot ascertain how likely the captured evidence was to vindicate or incriminate those accused of DA. Given the overall context, whereby the police and its partner agencies deem cases as having a high risk of recidivism, often of the most violent or controlling type, then we can assume that the evidence often sides with the victim. Unlike the more common high-frequency, low-harm DA that the police often have to deal with (Bland & Ariel, 2020), victims equipped with panic alarms are at the \u2018high end\u2019 of both harm as well as risk. More research is needed as to the nature of the\n611\n1 3\nComparing panic alarm systems for\u00a0high\u2011risk domestic abuse\u2026\nevidence captured by the audio system, but we nevertheless hold a strong assumption that the evidence is incriminating rather than vindicating.\nFinally, we conclude that the evidence that would lead to charges and possible incarceration is critical, and an alarm system with audio-recording capabilities can be helpful. However, whether additional arrests and, possibly, further prosecution achieve a reduction in subsequent harm remains contestable (see Sherman & Harris, 2015a, b), and we are not able to report the distal effects on court outcomes. However, these audio recordings at least pave the way towards potentially reducing harm through the criminal justice system. Future research should incorporate these outcomes in assessing the technological approaches used by the police.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11292- 022- 09505-1.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
