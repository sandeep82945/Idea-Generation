"The unique electronic and optical properties of TMDs, such as their two-dimensional structure, high absorption coefficients, and strong light-matter interactions, make them promising for use as active materials in solar cells. TMDs have been demonstrated to have a high light conversion efficiency and are able to absorb a wide range of light frequencies, making them an attractive material for the design of next-generation solar cells with improved performance."
