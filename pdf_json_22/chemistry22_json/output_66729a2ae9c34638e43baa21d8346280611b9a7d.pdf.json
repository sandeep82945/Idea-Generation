            "text": "Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have become a research spotlight of chemists and materials scientists with their potential applications in the eld of sensors,1,2 organic light-emitting diodes (OLED),3 bioimaging4 and document security5 owing to their unique photophysical properties. Generally, the strategies for designing efficient RTP materials include promoting the intersystem crossing (ISC) from the lowest excited singlet state (S1) to the excited triplet state (Tn), suppressing the nonradiative transition from the lowest excited triplet state (T1) to the ground state (S0) and shielding oxygen effectively which can easily quench T1. Conventional RTP materials are mainly coordination complexes containing noble metals such as platinum and palladium which can enhance spin\u2013orbit coupling and facilitate the ISC process. However, the development of novel metal-free RTP materials is necessary due to drawbacks such as expensive, relatively toxic and limited resources for organometallic compounds. Based on the microscopic mechanism of RTP generation, several approaches have been put forward to prepare pure organic RTP materials, including crystallization-induced,6\u201310 embedding phosphors in a rigid matrix11,12 and H-aggregation13,14 etc. The nonradiative deactivation of triplet excitons is maximally suppressed due to\nials of Ministry of Education and College\ninal Chemical Biology, Nankai University, ail.nankai.edu.cn; spclbh@nankai.edu.cn tion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nthe rigidity and oxygen barrier properties of crystals, while the complex growth process and poor processability limit their commercial applications. The past decade has witnessed the extensive investigation of polymer-based RTP materials owing to low cost, easy processing and low toxicity compared with crystalline RTP materials and coordination complexes containing noble metals.15\u201322 For example, Kim and co-workers devised Diels\u2013Alder click chemistry as a method to covalent cross-linking between phosphors and polymer matrices to suppress molecular motions for enhanced RTP of metal-free organic materials.23 Tian and co-workers developed a facile way to construct pure organic amorphous polymers with high phosphorescent quantum yields and ultralong RTP lifetimes by the simple radical binary copolymerization of acrylamide and different phosphors without extra processing.24,25 Lu et al. proposed a reliable large-scale strategy for synthesizing the covalently efficient RTP materials via B\u2013O click reaction between boronic acid-modied phosphors and polyhydroxy polymer matrix.26 Tang et al. presented wide-color ranged and persistent RTP from amorphous lms by embedding electronrich organic phosphor into electron-decient matrix polyacrylonitrile.27 Despite numerous advances, developing advanced RTP materials still remains challenging in several aspects, for example, most of polymer-based RTP materials just emit a single color. If the luminescent color can vary with external stimulation, it will effectively expand the application range of materials andmeet the new development requirements of organic functional materials.28,29\nColor-tunable luminescent materials, especially phosphorescence emission, have attracted tremendous interests due to\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 8145\u20138153 | 8145\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Diuoroboron b-diketonates (BF2bdks) are a classic polar uorescent dyes and have emerged as a class of functionalized luminescent materials because of their large extinction coefficient, sensitivity to the surrounding environment, high quantum yields and chemical stability.38,39 Aer Fraser's group rst reported the RTP of BF2bdks induced by coupling with poly(lactic acid),40 emission color tuning for RTP materials based on BF2bdks has been investigated, while persistent RTP is restricted to inert conditions which limits the application of BF2bdks.41\u201344\nHerein, we proposed a new strategy to prepare a singlephosphor amorphous polymer (abbreviated as SPAP) with\nScheme 1 (a) Synthetic routes of BF2bad and SPAP.

Where the chemical crosslinking structures and high-density hydrogen bonds between polyacrylamide (PAM) chains are devised as the effective method to restrict molecular motion (Scheme 1b) of BF2bdks and polymer chains. It is demonstrated that the molar ratio of two comonomers (BF2bad and acrylamide) has a signicant effect on the photophysical properties of SPAP which can be used for fabricating tunable multicolor materials. Besides, since hydrogen bonding interactions can be broken by water, the moisture content is quantitatively detected by the change in RTP emission intensity, and information encryption is also realized."

For example, the emission spectra showed a red shi from 429 nm in tetrahydrofuran to 450 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide. In addition, owing to the interaction between molecules, the maximum emission wavelength bathochromic shied to 501 nm in the solid state with a uorescence lifetime of 5.49 ns (Fig. 1b and c). The abovementioned results demonstrate that BF2bad is an excellent stimuli-responsive phosphor and can be used for the preparation of color-tunable luminescent materials, which will be further discussed subsequently. However, due to the quenching effect and nonradiative relaxation process, phosphorescence emission was not observed for BF2bad monomer in either solution or solid state."

In general, solvatochromism is related to the difference in the polarity of the surrounding liquid or solid-state medium;52 however, the polarity of the medium may also be inuenced by polar dyes.53 In terms of materials containing BF2bdks, this is reected in the different phosphor loadings.44,54 Clearly, just as the uorescence emission of BF2bad red-shied with increasing solvent polarity, the uorescence emission wavelength of SPAP also showed a bathochromic shi from 468 nm (SPAP(1/100)) to 523 nm (SPAP(1/10)) as the BF2bad content increased which accompanied by the luminescence color turned from blue to green under environment conditions, and the spectra became broader. The RTP emission wavelength of SPAP showed the similar trend as the uorescence emission. The corresponding Commission Internationale de l'E\u0301clair-age (CIE) coordinates were calculated in Fig. 3c and d. According to previous reports, BF2bdks have a larger dipole moment38 and their emission is sensitive to the polarity of the surrounding medium.55 Higher concentration of BF2bad will result in a greater probability of BF2bad\u2013BF2bad interactions in the system. When the distance between BF2bad molecules is about 3 A\u030a,56,57 ground\u2013state\n8148 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 8145\u20138153\nassociation or excimers will be formed, which resulting in lower energy emission.37 Conversely, the reduction of BF2bad\u2013BF2bad interactions is responsible for the short-wave emission at lower BF2bad content. The results indicate that varying the feed amount of BF2bad is a simple but efficient approach to generate color tunability for PAM-based RTP systems.\nFurthermore, both phosphorescence lifetime (sP) and phosphorescence quantum yield (FP) of SPAP were also measured and calculated (Table 1 and Fig. 3e\u2013h). sP and FP are important physical quantities to describe the properties of phosphorescence, among which, sP refers to the time required for the phosphorescent intensity to decay to 1/e of the initial value. FP is a measure of the utilization efficiency of absorbed photons during the phosphorescent process, and is dened as the ratio of the number of emit ted phosphorescent photons and the number of absorbed photons. The equations are shown below:\nsP \u00bc 1/(kP + kts + kq) (1)\nFP \u00bc FisckP/(kP + kts + kq) (2)\nwhere Fisc is the rate constant of intersystem crossing, kP represents the rate constant of phosphorescence emission, kts refers to the nonradiative transition rate constant from T1 to S0 and kq is the rate constant of quenching T1 state by quenchers.\nFrom eqn (1), the key to obtaining long sP is to minimize kts and kq. The abundant hydrogen bonding interactions among the PAM chains restrict the molecular motion of phosphors associated with kts and effectively shield quenchers like oxygen associated with kq.25 Accordingly, longer sP can be observed at lower content of BF2bad. In contrast, higher BF2bad content will reduce the number of hydrogen bonds and weaken the shielding effect of quenchers, thus is thought to cause a shorter sP. As shown in Table 1, sP shortens from 16.8 ms (SPAP(1/50)) to 4.2 ms (SPAP(1/10)) as the BF2bad content increases. Even so, very low contents will also lead to a shortening of sP because enough BF2bad contact is necessary to achieve RTP.17,58,59 Besides, FP varies slightly with the molar ratio of SPAP, which is inuenced by the competition between phosphorescence emission and other nonradiative relaxations, such as vibrational dissipation and oxygen-mediated quenching.17,18,60\nTo verify the important role of copolymerization of BF2bad and acrylamide for realizing RTP emission, we tested the delayed photoluminescence spectra of mechanical mixture of BF2bad and PAM (SPAP0(1/50)) as a control experiment. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI\u2020), SPAP0(1/50) has no emission peak at 518 nm, indicating that simple mixing cannot bind BF2bad to PAM tightly and thus the thermal motion of BF2bad cannot be inhibited effectively. As mentioned above, the copolymerization of BF2bad with acrylamide is the key to active RTP emission. The abundant hydrogen bonding interactions and the inherent crosslinked structure in SPAP can effectively promote RTP emission by locking phosphors and shielding quenchers."

Since PAM is only soluble in water, we prepared seven suspension samples of 1.5 mgmL 1 by dispersing SPAP(1/50) in H2O/DMF mixed solutions to explore the effect of humidity on the RTP emission intensity. As shown in Fig. 4e, the RTP emission intensity of SPAP(1/50) at 518 nm gradually decreased with increasing the volume fraction of water, and was totally quenched when the water fraction reached 15%. It is noteworthy that the phosphorescence quenching efficiency followed a good linear correlation with water content (R2 \u00bc 0.9914) (Fig. 4f) and the LOD was calculated as 0.014%, which is comparable to other uorescent sensors for water detection,61 which makes SPAP(1/50) a potential candidate for moisture content detection in organic solvents."

            "text": "Beneting from the diversied RTP lifetimes and the humidity responsiveness, these polymers can be applied to multiple encodings for information encryption. As an example shown in Fig. 5, the digits were written by different inks in a piece of nonuorescent paper, where the number \u201c64\u201d was written by longlived SPAP(1/50) (dissolved in water, 20 mg mL 1), the blue part of \u201c88\u201d was marked by SPAP(1/75) (dissolved in water, 20 mg mL 1) and the purple part was coated with BF2bad (dissolved in dichloromethane, 20 mg mL 1). Number \u201c88\u201d could be found under the daylight in both the wet and dry state due to the uorescence properties of BF2bad. In the dry state, the bright number \u201c88\u201d appeared under the irradiation of UV lamp and disappeared immediately aer turning off the irradiation due to no RTP emission of BF2bad, leaving the long-lived SPAP(1/50) and SPAP(1/75) emitted a green luminescence of \u201c68\u201d. Thenceforth, the RTP of SPAP(1/75) decayed to invisibility and the residual phosphorescence of SPAP(1/50) emitted \u201c64\u201d\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n(Movie 2, ESI\u2020). Under moist state, number \u201c88\u201d was still visible under UV light, but nothing could be found aer turning off the UV light due to the quenching of RTP. As a result, the triple encoding of digital encryption was realized, and this process was completely reversible and could be repeated more than once."

            "text": "In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized concentration-dependent luminescent metal-free amorphous RTP materials with color-tunable through radical copolymerization of the single phosphor BF2bad and acrylamide. The results indicate that the chemical crosslinking structures and the hydrogen bonding interactions between polymer chains effectively restrict the molecular motion of phosphors and shield the quenching of the triplet excitons by oxygen, creating the necessary conditions for observing the persistent RTP with the naked eye under environmental conditions. Multicolor phosphorescence signals are observed in this polymer system which can be effectively regulated by changing the feed amount of phosphor. The phosphorescence quenching mechanism is attributed to the disassociation of hydrogen bonds in the presence of water. Furthermore, triple encoding of information encryption is achieved by utilizing the humidity response and the different RTP lifetimes of SPAP. This work is expected to have applications in the elds of moisture content detection and document security as well as will further contribute to the development of tunable multicolor materials.\nAuthor contributions\nYulei Gao: conceptualization, data curation, writing original dra, and visualization.
