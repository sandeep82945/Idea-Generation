 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Examine the information flows between geopolitical risk and other asset classes not covered in this study, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds, and cryptocurrencies. This could provide insights into how these alternative assets respond to geopolitical uncertainty.

2. Conduct a similar analysis on information flows during other major geopolitical events, such as the Gulf Wars, 9/11 terrorist attacks, Arab Spring, etc. Comparing the findings could reveal interesting patterns about how financial markets respond to different geopolitical crises. 

3. Use more advanced methods like deep learning algorithms to model the nonlinear relationships and predict future information flows between geopolitical risk and financial assets. This could lead to better risk management models and strategies.

4. Analyze the impact of geopolitical risk on information flows and connections between different national/regional financial markets. This could provide insights into changing global market integration during periods of geopolitical tensions.

5. Examine the role of investor sentiment and behavioral biases in driving the information flows from geopolitical risk to financial assets. Survey or social media data could help understand how investors perceive and react to geopolitical events.
