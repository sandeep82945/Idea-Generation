INTRODUCTION\nIn a quantum network, a coherent interface consists of a unitary interaction between light and matter that is much stronger than decay channels to the environment.1 Recent experiments with a single trapped ion coupled to a fiber-based optical resonator have demonstrated a coherent coupling rate g0 exceeding the atomic spontaneous-emission rate c.2\u20135 Due to this coherent ion\u2013photon interaction, fiber-based cavities integrated with ion traps offer a promising platform for a quantum network node. Additional strengths of the platform include both direct emission into optical fibers, for transmission in long-distance networks, and the small fiber footprint, for miniaturizing quantum nodes and scaling up their complexity.\nMany key applications of quantum networks, including distributed quantum computation, require the network nodes to host more than a single qubit.6,7 While a single trapped ion has been coupled to a fiber cavity,2,8 coupling of multiple ions has not yet been achieved. The ion-trap geometries used in Refs. 2 and 8 give rise to residual radiofrequency fields that vanish only at a single point within the trapping region and introduce excess micromotion away from this point. It is not possible to compensate for this micromotion,9 which compromises both the ion\u2013cavity coupling8 and the fidelity of gate operations between multiple ions.\nHere, we present an ion\u2013cavity system designed for coupling a fiber cavity to multiple ions, each in the strong coupling regime. The fiber mirrors are integrated along the axis of a linear Paul trap known as a wheel trap. Ions can be positioned along this axis without introducing excess micromotion. The paper is structured as follows: Sec. II describes the ion\u2013cavity system. The influence of surface charges and the influence of the fiber-mirror positions on the ion are studied with simulations in Sec. III. We then turn to experiments in Sec. IV, first with a test setup without integrated fibers, and subsequently with the integrated ion\u2013cavity system. We present measurements of micromotion in the test setup and heating rates of both the test setup and the ion\u2013cavity system. As a final test, we show that the effects of surface charges, commonly found on dielectric surfaces,10,11 can be counteracted by means of the trap electrodes."

            "text": "We first focus on the details of the wheel trap, a linear Paul trap developed for quantum metrology experiments.12\u201314 The trap consists of a diamond wafer, 300lm thick, on which gold electrodes are sputtered, 5lm thick, using titanium as an adhesive layer. The thinness of this wafer makes the wheel trap uniquely suited for integration with an optical microcavity along the trap axis.\nAVS Quantum Sci. 5, 012001 (2023); doi: 10.1116/5.0121534 5, 012001-1\nVC Author(s) 2023.\n18 January 2024 22:51:12\nA photo of our adaptation of the wheel trap is shown in Fig. 1(a), and a schematic of the trap center is shown in Fig. 1(b). We define the x\u2013y plane as the plane of the wafer and the z axis as the trap axis. The ion\u2013electrode distance is 250 lm. It is important to match the capacitances of the four RF electrodes. In the trap-design phase, we calculate these capacitances using finite-element-analysis software and adjust the electrode geometry accordingly. Compensation electrodes are used to minimize micromotion in the x\u2013y plane.9,15 In contrast to earlier wheeltrap designs,12\u201314 the DC electrodes (also known as endcaps) that confine ions along the z axis are hollow, allowing us to integrate fiber mirrors within them. The electrodes consist of stainless-steel tubes with an inner diameter of 250\u00f050\u00delm and an outer diameter of 500\u00f020\u00de lm.\nThe two fiber mirrors inside the opposing endcaps form a fiber Fabry\u2013P erot cavity (FFPC).16 To prevent charging of the fibers due to scattered laser light,10,11 we recess the fibers by 10\u00f02\u00delm into the tubes. We use one multimode (MM) fiber17 with a diameter of 220\u00f03\u00delm and one photonic-crystal (PC) fiber18 with a diameter of 230\u00f05\u00delm. A CO2 laser-ablation process generates concave, nearspherical profiles on each fiber facet.16,19 The radii of curvature are 318\u00f05\u00delm for the MM profile and 312\u00f05\u00delm for the PC profile. The mirrors consist of alternating layers of SiO2 and Ta2O5, applied to the fiber facets via ion-beam sputtering.20\nAt a wavelength of 854 nm, the MM mirror has a transmission of 2\u00f01\u00de ppm, whereas the transmission of the PCmirror is 16\u00f01\u00de ppm. The cavity finesse is 9:2\u00f02\u00de 104 for a length of 507\u00f08\u00delm, corresponding to a linewidth of j \u00bc 2p 1:61\u00f03\u00deMHz (half-width at half maximum). We calculate an ion\u2013cavity coupling strength of g0 \u00bc 2p 20:3\u00f03\u00deMHz for the j32D5=2i to j42P3=2i transition of a 40Ca\u00fe ion.21 The largest Clebsch\u2013Gordon coefficient for transitions between Zeeman states of these manifolds is a \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2=3 p , so that the largest possible coupling strength is g \u00bc ag0 \u00bc 2p 16:6\u00f03\u00deMHz. The two relevant spontaneous emission channels are from j42P3=2i to j32D5=2i, with a decay rate of cPD \u00bc 2p 0:67MHz, and from j42P3=2i to j42S1=2i, with a decay rate of cPS \u00bc 2p 10:74MHz; both rates are half widths.\nThese values satisfy the inequalities g > j and g > \u00f0cPD \u00fe cPS\u00de, a criterion for strong coupling that has been used to evaluate some experiments with ion\u2013cavity systems.4,22 A stricter criterion for strong atomcavity coupling requires the coupling rate g to be much greater than all relevant decay rates, that is, for coherent processes to dominate over dissipative ones.21 In our system, g is only 1.5 times larger than cPS and, thus, does not satisfy the inequality g cPS. However, quantum-network schemes have been proposed that remove cPS as a relevant decay channel, by removing the j42S1=2imanifold from the Hilbert space in which single photons are generated.23 For such schemes, our system also fulfills the strict requirement g j; cPD for strong atom-cavity coupling.\nThe ion\u2013cavity system is located inside an ultra-high vacuum chamber at a pressure below 1 10 10 mbar, the lowest pressure value that can be determined from the ion-pump current. The DC electrodes with integrated fiber mirrors are glued on quartz v-grooves,24 each of which is glued on a shear-mode piezo,25 as shown in Fig. 2. The length of the cavity is stabilized by applying a Pound\u2013Drever\u2013Hall feedback signal to one of the piezos.26 Each piezo is glued on a stainless-steel tiltadjuster, with which the angle of each fiber mirror is aligned during the construction of the setup. Each tilt-adjuster is mounted on a 3D nanopositioning assembly,27 which allows positioning of each fiber mirror along three axes over a range of 12mm with a resolution of 1 nm for relative movements. In practice, we translate the fiber mirrors over a range of at most 1mm along each axis.\nFor loading ions, we use single laser pulses with pulse energies around 150 lJ at a wavelength of 515 nm to ablate neutral 40Ca atoms from a target, which is mounted 2 cm from the trap along the line of sight (Fig. 2).28 Two objectives, each with a numerical aperture of 0.18, are mounted inside inverted viewports. The objectives collect the ion fluorescence, which is guided to an electron-multiplying CCD camera and to a photomultiplier tube."

We start by importing the geometry of the ion\u2013cavity system as depicted in Fig. 1(b) into finite-element analysis (FEA) software.32 We define our coordinate system to match the system indicated in Fig. 1(b), with the origin in the center of both the ion trap and the FFPC.\nFIG. 2.

In this image, one of two inverted viewports is shown.\nAVS Quantum Sci. 5, 012001 (2023); doi: 10.1116/5.0121534 5, 012001-3\nVC Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 22:51:12\nThe fiber-cavity length is set to 500lm in this geometry. Unless otherwise mentioned, the trap electrodes are grounded.\nWe now determine the contributions /RF; /DC, and /r separately for a 40Ca\u00fe ion (massm \u00bc 40 u, charge e), starting with /RF. As is standard for linear Paul traps, /RF is generated by driving the wheel trap in one of two possible configurations. In the first configuration (RF-GND), we ground one pair of opposing RF electrodes and apply a driving signal with amplitude VRF and frequency XRF to the other pair.33 In the second configuration (symmetric), we drive both RF electrode pairs such that the phase of the RF signal on one electrode pair is shifted by 180 relative to the signal on the other pair.34 While the RF-GND configuration is technically easier to realize,35 the symmetric drive can be advantageous for particular ion-trap geometries, such as that of the wheel trap.12,36,37 To simulate the RF-GND configuration, we set a voltage V0 \u00bc 1V on one pair of RF electrodes. To simulate the symmetric configuration, we set a voltage V0 \u00bc 0:5V on one pair of RF electrodes and a voltage V0 on the other pair. For both configurations, the FEA software simulates the electric field E\u00f0r\u00de, with which we calculate /RF from the expression 38\n/RF\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc VRF V0\ne2jE\u00f0r\u00dej2\n4mX2RF : (2)\nNext, we set a voltage VDC on the DC electrodes and simulate /DC\u00f0r\u00de. Finally, to simulate /r, we set a homogeneous surfacecharge density r on the facets of the fibers and assume the charges to be static. Since the fiber mirrors are located inside the DC electrodes, we do not consider charges on the sides of the fiber mirrors, in contrast to Ref. 11.\nFollowing Eq. (1), we sum the three potentials to determine /trap over the trapping region. In Fig. 3(a), /trap is plotted as a function of position along all three axes. Here, the symmetric drive configuration is used with VRF \u00bc 160V; VDC \u00bc 1V, and no charges present on the fiber mirrors. We fit a harmonic oscillator potential\n/\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc 1 2 mxr\u00f0r r0\u00de2 \u00fe /0 (3)\nwith offset /0 to /trap in order to extract the ion position r0 2 fx0; y0; z0g and the trap frequency xr along an axis r 2 fx; y; zg. This fit yields x0 \u00bc 0\u00f01\u00delm; y0 \u00bc 1\u00f01\u00de lm; z0 \u00bc 0\u00f01\u00delm, xx \u00bc 2p 3:134\u00f02\u00deMHz; xy \u00bc 2p 3:174\u00f02\u00deMHz, and xz \u00bc 2p 1:041\u00f01\u00de MHz, where the uncertainties on the positions are set by the mesh resolution in the simulation.\nIn Fig. 3(b), we compare /RF along the z axis for the two drive configurations. Over a range of 200lm around the trap center, the potential of the symmetric drive is constant at a value of approximately 1:22\u00f08\u00demeV. The potential of the RF-GND drive is harmonic with a minimum at z \u00bc 1\u00f01\u00de lm and reaches a maximum value of 89:0\u00f01\u00demeV. In the symmetric case, the 180 phase shift of the two RF signals causes the electric field to vanish along the z axis,34 while the asymmetric RF-GND configuration generates a vanishing field at only one point,9 meaning that ions displaced from this minimum will be subject to micromotion. This statement holds true for all linear Paul traps, but for typical centimeter-scale trap lengths, the curvature of /RF in the RF-GND configuration is negligible. However, for the 300 lm-long wheel trap, the curvature of /RF becomes significant, as we will see in Sec. IVA.\nB. Influence of surface charges\nWe now include surface charges on the fiber facets in our simulations. The trapping potential is simulated for surface-charge densities r ranging from 0.1 to 50 e=lm2, with VRF \u00bc 160V and VDC \u00bc 0V. In each simulation, the same value of r is used for both fiber facets. In this first simulation of charge densities, values less than or equal to zero are not considered, since they lead to unstable trapping without a voltage on the DC electrodes. As in Sec. IIIA, we determine the trap frequencies, with uncertainties given by the standard deviations of the fit parameters.\nFigure 4(a) shows the trap frequencies along all three axes as a function of the surface-charge density. We observe that xz increases with increasing charge density while xx and xy decrease. This is the same effect that one observes when increasing VDC for a linear Paul trap, since the surface charges and the applied voltage play the same role. Here, we highlight another advantage of using the wheel trap for an integrated fiber cavity: charges on the fiber mirrors are equivalent\nFIG. 3. (a) Simulated potential /trap for the symmetric drive configuration with VRF \u00bc 160 V and VDC \u00bc 1 V, plotted for all three axes. Fits of the data with Eq. (3) are also plotted.

In practice, it is difficult to add or remove surface charges in a controlled fashion,10,11 but VDC provides a knob with which we can achieve the equivalent result.\nAs a proof of principle for this approach, we determine the value of VDC that results in an axial trap frequency of xz \u00bc 2p 1MHz for surface charge densities between 10 and 50 e=lm2. These values are plotted in Fig. 4(b). This range of densities corresponds to the range from experiments reported in Ref. 11. The compensation voltage decreases linearly with increasing surface charge density. Note that the approach works for any value of xz; xz \u00bc 2p 1MHz was simply chosen as a round number.\nC. Influence of the cavity position\nAs a final consideration in our simulations, we vary the positions of the DC electrodes with integrated fiber mirrors in order to\nunderstand the effect on the trapping potential. In the experimental setup, it is necessary to adjust the relative positions of the electrodes so that the mirrors form a cavity. The laser-ablation process results in mirror profiles that are centered with respect to the fiber facets with an uncertainty of 0:9 lm.19 Gluing the fibers into the DC electrodes results in a centering uncertainty of 30 lm. Thus, we require a positioning range of 31lm. In addition, in order to position the cavity mode with respect to an ion, we will need to translate both mirrors and, thus, both electrodes.\nWe displace both fiber mirrors along the x axis for values df between 50 and 50 lm and determine the position of the ion r0 \u00bc \u00f0x0; y0; z0\u00de, which is plotted in Fig. 5 for the x axis. Again, we estimate a 1lm uncertainty for the ion position from the resolution of the simulation mesh. Within the uncertainty, we observe no displacement of the ion, from which we conclude that it will be possible to position the fiber mirrors within our setup without affecting the ion position."

We measure Rabi oscillations on the j42S1=2;mj \u00bc \u00fe1=2i to j32D5=2;mj \u00bc \u00fe1=2i transition (qubit transition) and on the micromotion sideband of this transition. We determine the Rabi frequency XQ of the qubit transition using a fitting model that assumes the Debye\u2013Waller coupling as the damping source.33 For the micromotion sideband, this approach is not applicable, since the period of Rabi oscillations is longer than the 259\u00f011\u00dels coherence time of the qubit. We instead extract the Rabi frequency XM by fitting a damped sinusoidal oscillation. Error bars correspond to one standard deviation of the fit parameters.\nFor XM < 1 kHz, we are unable to resolve multiple oscillations of the ion\u2019s state due to limitations in the experimental control hardware. For these Rabi frequencies, we estimate XM from the first data point at which the excitation on the micromotion sideband overlaps with 0.5, and the error ofXM is given by the quantum projection noise. When displacing the ion along the z axis, the mean voltage on both electrodes is held constant in order to keep xz constant. At each ion position, before determining XQ and XM, we minimize the micromotion using the compensation electrodes.\nIn Fig. 6, the modulation index b 2\u00f0XM=XQ\u00de is plotted as a function of the ion position. The modulation index is proportional to the residual RF electric field and is, thus, a measure of micromotion.9 The micromotion vanishes at a single point for the RF-GND configuration, as expected from the simulations in Sec. IIIA. In contrast, the micromotion vanishes over the full measurement range of 20 lm for the symmetric configuration. The setup has been designed to couple multiple ions to the fiber-cavity mode. As a typical ion\u2013ion distance is around 5 lm, we see from Fig. 6 that it is not possible to confine two ions in the RF-GND configuration without excess micromotion. In contrast, in the symmetric configuration, it should be possible to confine at least five ions without excess micromotion. For the symmetric drive, the compensation-electrode voltages are 0 and 50V for ion positions between 4:9\u00f07\u00de and 10\u00f01\u00de lm and 0 and 53V for positions below 4:9\u00f07\u00delm.\nThe ion position in Fig. 6 is calibrated as follows: we take an image of the ion at z \u00bc 0 lm, displace the ion with the DC electrodes, and take an image of the displaced ion. From the two images, we calculate the ion displacement in units of pixels per volt. After measuring the micromotion, we load two ions into the trap and take a third image, from which we determine the distance dz between the two ions in pixels. We also calculate dz in meters with the relation42\ndz \u00bc e 2\n2p 0mx2z\n!1=3 ; (4)\nthereby obtaining a conversion from pixels to meters. Combining both conversions yields the ion displacement in units of meters per volt.

            "text": "After integrating the fiber mirrors into the experimental setup, we measure the heating rates again. The distance between the fiber mirrors is set to 550 lm and the axial trap frequency to 2p 1:636\u00f05\u00deMHz. We find that the red motional sideband is no longer suppressed by sideband cooling, so, instead, the ion\u2019s temperature is determined from fits to Rabi oscillations.41,44\u201347 The laser beam driving Rabi oscillations overlaps with all three motional modes, so we cannot determine the phonon number of each mode separately. (The exact beam geometry is described in Ref. 48.) As the contribution of the axial mode dominates by more than one order of magnitude, we express the mean phonon number n as a projection onto the z axis, as described in Ref. 41. Note that n approximates the mean phonon number nz of the axial mode, but nz is smaller than n.\nIn Fig. 8, n is plotted for a variable waiting time tw before the interrogation pulse. From a linear fit, we determine a heating rate of _ n \u00bc 14\u00f02\u00de phononms 1, three orders of magnitude larger than the rates in Sec. IVB. We attribute this higher rate to the presence of the fiber mirrors. We have recently developed a model for ion heating based on dielectric losses in the fibers, which is supported by further experiments that we have conducted with this setup.41\nFor near-term experiments with this system, e.g., on singlephoton generation and ion\u2013photon entanglement, we do not foresee this heating rate to be a limitation: Techniques such as cavity cooling can be employed to prepare the ions close to the motional ground state.5 The relevant timescales for photon generation and single-qubit operations are below ten microseconds, an order of magnitude shorter than the mean time in which one phonon is added to the system. Finally, local entanglement can be realized with entangling operations that are robust to heating.49 In the long term, it may be advantageous for high-fidelity network applications to use longer fiber cavities.19"

            "text": "As a final test, we return to the predictions of Sec. III B and adjust the trap electrode voltages to counteract the effects of surface charges\non the fibers. Starting from L \u00bc 507\u00f08\u00de lm, which is determined from a measurement of the cavity free-spectral range, we increase the length via the nanopositioning assemblies. For each value of L, we adjust the voltages on the DC electrodes such that the axial trap frequency is xz \u00bc 2p 1:6\u00f01\u00deMHz and the ion position remains fixed within 25lm. Here, VPC and VMM are the voltages on the DC electrodes containing the PC fiber and the MM fiber, respectively. The uncertainties of VPC and VMM correspond to the precision of the voltage source. In Fig. 9, we plot VMM and VPC for fiber\u2013fiber distances up to 1200 lm. Both voltages increase for increasing distance, but VPC is always positive, while VMM takes on both negative and positive values over a range that is three times higher. We attribute this difference to the presence of surface charges on the fiber facets. This measurement shows that despite surface charges, a trapped ion can be confined at a fixed position over a range of cavity lengths."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "We have designed and constructed an ion\u2013cavity system with integrated fiber mirrors. The system is designed such that coupling of multiple ions to the fiber cavity will be possible without excess micromotion and that the coherent coupling rate of each ion to the cavity will be greater than the rates of decay processes. Simulations show that voltages on the DC electrodes compensate for surface charges on the fiber mirrors and that translation of the fiber mirrors does not affect the ion position.\nPrior to the assembly of the system, we built an ion-trap test setup without the fiber mirrors and measured micromotion and heating rates, both of which are consistent with values in the state-of-theart ion traps for quantum information processing. After integration of the fiber mirrors, we observed a heating rate that was three orders of magnitude higher, which we attribute to the presence of the fibers. This observation led to a recent study on the role of dielectrics in ion traps.41\nWe have trapped an ion within the cavity for cavity lengths as short as 507\u00f08\u00de lm, and we have confirmed that voltages on the DC electrodes compensate for surface charges. A next step will be to\nFIG. 9. Voltages VPC and VMM applied to the DC electrodes in order to keep both the ion position and trap frequency fixed over a range of fiber\u2013fiber distances L.
