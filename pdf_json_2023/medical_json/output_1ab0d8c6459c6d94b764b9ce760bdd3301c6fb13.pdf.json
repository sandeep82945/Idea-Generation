    "abstractText": "Purpose: To examine whether exercise self-efficacy mediates the contributions of pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia to exercise adherence in patients after total knee arthroplasty. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted. A total 211 post-total knee arthroplasty patients were recruited from three orthopedics units of a tertiary hospital in China. Participants were invited to complete questionnaires on pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, exercise self-efficacy, and exercise adherence. Mplus 8.3 software was used to construct mediation models. Results: Pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia were negatively correlated with exercise adherence (r = \u22120.509, r = \u22120.605, p < 0.001 respectively), while exercise self-efficacy were positively associated with exercise adherence (r = 0.799, p < 0.001). The results found exercise self-efficacy mediated the correlations of pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia with exercise adherence after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Pain catastrophizing indirectly affected patients\u2019 exercise adherence through its effect on exercise efficacy (indirect effect: \u22120.412), while Kinesiophobia is directly associated with exercise adherence and also indirectly through exercise self-efficacy (direct effect: \u22120.184, indirect effect: \u22120.415). Conclusion: Patients after total knee arthroplasty who have high levels of psychological distress (pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia) are vulnerable to be non-adherent to exercise behaviors. Exercise self-efficacy explains the effects of pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia on exercise adherence and may be a key target for measures to improve exercise behaviors in patients after total knee arthroplasty.",

Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted. A total 211 post-total knee arthroplasty patients were recruited from three orthopedics units of a tertiary hospital in China. Participants were invited to complete questionnaires on pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, exercise self-efficacy, and exercise adherence. Mplus 8.3 software was used to construct mediation models. Results: Pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia were negatively correlated with exercise adherence (r = \u22120.509, r = \u22120.605, p < 0.001 respectively), while exercise self-efficacy were positively associated with exercise adherence (r = 0.799, p < 0.001). The results found exercise self-efficacy mediated the correlations of pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia with exercise adherence after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Pain catastrophizing indirectly affected patients\u2019 exercise adherence through its effect on exercise efficacy (indirect effect: \u22120.412), while Kinesiophobia is directly associated with exercise adherence and also indirectly through exercise self-efficacy (direct effect: \u22120.184, indirect effect: \u22120.415). Conclusion: Patients after total knee arthroplasty who have high levels of psychological distress (pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia) are vulnerable to be non-adherent to exercise behaviors. Exercise self-efficacy explains the effects of pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia on exercise adherence and may be a key target for measures to improve exercise behaviors in patients after total knee arthroplasty.

It is characterized by three main components, including an excessive focus on pain sensations (rumination), an exaggerated perception of the threat value of pain symptoms (magnification), and beliefs that the control of pain is beyond one\u2019s ability (helplessness).24,25 Catastrophizing in a pain context, patients tend to avoid engaging in pain-inducing activities due to their excessive focus on pain, which may lead to a reduction in exercise adherence and have a negative effect on post-TKA joint function recovery and outcomes.23 Evidence has indicated that patients with high levels of pain catastrophizing are more prone to be non-adherent to exercise.26\nKinesiophobia, or fear of movement, is referred as an irrational and debilitating fear of physical movement and activity.27 According to the theoretical framework of Fear of Movement, patients can respond to fear of movement in one of two ways: by confronting fear or avoiding fear. Confrontation leads to decrease fear, active exercise, and faster recovery. In contrast, avoidance can result in kinesiophobia, which may cause negative health outcomes, such as physical inactivity and disability.28,29 Kinesiophobia patients believe that painful activity will result in damage and that will increase suffering and/ or functional loss, leading to activity avoidance or escape and further causing low levels of physical activity and exercise.30 Evidence found that kinesiophobia is negatively associated with physical activity and exercise in post-TKA patients,31 knee OA patients,21 and other populations.32,33\nSelf-efficacy is a critical predictor of exercise adherence for patients after TKA,34 and exercise self-efficacy can be described as the individual\u2019s ability to self-manage when faced with exercise task.35 According to the Theory of Self-efficacy proposed by psychologist Bandura,34 high levels of exercise self-efficacy increase patients\u2019 confidence and beliefs in their capacity to carry out post-TKA exercise tasks. When they encounter setbacks or challenges during exercise, they possibly make more effort and generate satisfying exercise performance.36\nA systematic review has shown that postoperative self-efficacy was more consistently related to recovery outcomes such as longer distance ambulation, exercise repetition and frequency, walking speed, and disability.37 And previous evidence revealed that exercise self-efficacy is positively correlated with exercise behaviors20 and selfefficacy enhancement intervention is demonstrated useful to increase patients\u2019 exercise adherence.38,39\nThe existing literature review demonstrated pain catastrophizing, Kinesiophobia, and exercise self-efficacy are associated with exercise adherence. While, to our best knowledge, none have examined the relationships between all three constructs together in post-TKA patients. Clarifying and understanding the mechanisms behind the strong correlations between these psychosocial variables and health-promoting behaviors may assist in tailoring effective measures and interventions that are targeted at promoting exercise adherence in post-TKA patients. To summarize, the study aims to clarify the direct/ indirect association and possible causal pathways of these variables by using the mediation model.\nBased on the Fear-Avoidance Model and the Theory of Self-Efficacy and the literatures mentioned above, we hypothesized that 1) pain catastrophizing is negatively correlated with exercise adherence; 2) exercise self-efficacy would mediate the relationship between pain catastrophizing and exercise adherence; 3) kinesiophobia is negatively correlated with exercise adherence; 4) exercise self-efficacy would mediate the relationship between kinesiophobia and exercise adherence. The hypothesized mediation model is shown in Figure 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S432106 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 3994\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

This study conformed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Institutional Review Board of Baoding No.1 Central Hospital (Approval Number: [2022]068). Each participant signed an informed consent form before participating in this study. The participants met the following inclusion criteria: 1) a definite diagnosis of osteoarthritis by an orthopedic physician; 2) underwent primary total knee arthroplasty; 3) age \u2265 18 years. Participants were excluded if they had 1) cancer or other severe diseases, and 2) a mental disorder that prevented them from understanding the questionnaires.\nPatients in the hospital followed the traditional (non-enhanced recovery after surgery, NRAS) pathway. Prior to the surgery, patients received ankle pump training as well as deep breathing and effective cough exercises. Upon returning to the ward, patients were provided in-person guidance (about 15\u201320 minutes) on knee joint exercises and encouraged patients to get out of bed the next day. Furthermore, they also were provided a paper-based functional exercise guidance program. Patients were encouraged to gradually perform exercises such as straight leg raises, knee joint bends, and walking with the assistance of auxiliary tools in the following days. Finally, nurses provided health education to patients who would be discharged from the hospital about how to continue joint exercises after discharge.\nFollowing study enrollment, each patient completed questionnaires under the guidance of trained research assistants before they discharge. Research assistants received uniform training sessions to ensure consistency in data collection. The survey and the brief interview took about 20 minutes to complete.\nThe required sample size was calculated using G*Power version 3.1 based on a Priori Power Analyses.40 It is based on a medium effect size of 0.02, \u03b1 of 0.05, and a power of 0.95.

            "text": "To our best knowledge, this is the first study to consider the correlation among pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, exercise self-efficacy, and exercise adherence in patients after TKA. It is also the first study to explore whether exercise self-efficacy mediates the relationship between pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and exercise adherence. This study provides a new insight towards understanding how pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia affect exercise adherence in patients after TKA.\nIn the current study, exercise adherence among post-TKA patients was 56.10, which was similar to the previous study.15 Our results showed the medium- and low-adherence rate was 42.6%, and the rate of adherence in the active learning dimension was the lowest, which is in line with the results in the early study.50 This result may be explained by the fact that 64% of the patients were old and generally obtained a low level of education in this study, and they had limited ability to actively learn and accept new things.15 Accordingly, HCPs should provide more detailed functional exercise protocols for old patients with low education levels, and increase patients\u2019 awareness of actively seeking help from multiple sources, such as HCPs, the Internet, or other patients.\nThe present study found a significant negative correlation between pain catastrophizing and exercise adherence, which is consistent with the previous study.26 This suggests that post-TKA patients who have a higher level of pain catastrophizing are more likely to be nonadherent with rehabilitation exercise. A possible explanation for this might be that pain catastrophizing probably contributes to escape and avoidance behaviors.29 Growing evidence indicated that preand post-operative pain catastrophizing has a negative effect on patients undergoing TKA, often leading to persistent pain and poor function.51,52 Post-TKA patients who catastrophize pain may perceive more persistent pain during rehabilitation exercise and concern that worsen their keen condition. Thus, patients are more likely to avoid or reduce their participation in post-TKA exercise, resulting in decreased exercise adherence.53 In addition, our results also showed exercise self-efficacy as a mediator of correlation between pain catastrophizing and exercise adherence, indicating patients with high pain catastrophizing would have a lower confidence to attend and insist on post-TKA exercise, further leading to poor exercise adherence. Early mobilization and exercise may cause pain and discomfort in patients due to knee joint swelling following TKA. It may boost catastrophizing thoughts and avoid pain-induced activities and behaviors in pain-catastrophizing patients, which reduce their confidence to engage in exercise and ultimately lead to poor exercise adherence.\nOur finding that kinesiophobia was associated with exercise adherence conforms to previous studies in post-TKA patients.30,31 Kinesiophobia patients are less to adhere to exercise after TKA. One qualitative study conducted in China to explore the real experience of post-TKA patients with kinesiophobia in early rehabilitation exercise,54 found that fear of pain, uncertainty about the effects of early rehabilitation exercise, high economic and psychological pressure, and lack of families, professionals, and social support might be the explanations for low enthusiasm for early exercise. Our study further demonstrated that kinesiophobia not only directly and negatively affected exercise adherence in post-TKA patients, but also indirectly influenced the level of exercise adherence through diminishing exercise self-efficacy. This result is similar to earlier studies55,56 on the relationship among kinesiophobia, physical self-efficacy, and physical activity in kidney transplant recipients. Liu et al55 and Zelle et al56 study reported self-efficacy mediated the relationship\nTable 4 Mediation Analysis of Kinesiophobia and Exercise Adherence (N = 211)\nEffect Boot SE 95% CI Proportion\nLower Upper\nDirect effect: Kinesiophobia \u2192 Exercise adherence \u22120.184 0.048 \u22120.280 \u22120.094 30.7%\nIndirect effect\nKinesiophobia \u2192 Exercise self-efficacy \u2192 Exercise adherence \u22120.415 0. 040 \u22120.494 \u22120.340 69.3%\nTotal effect \u22120.599 0.043 \u22120.676 \u22120.504 100%\nAbbreviations: CI, Confidence Interval; SE, Standard Error.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S432106 DovePress Journal of Pain Research 2023:16 4000\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nbetween kinesiophobia and physical activity. Based on Bandura\u2019s self-efficacy theory, physical and emotional states as major contributors to the promotion of self-efficacy.34 Positive emotion may enhance self-efficacy, while negative emotion diminishes them. Kinesiophobia as an emotional response to perceived health threats associated with physical movement and activity, is likely to reduce individuals\u2019 self-efficacy and thereby decrease exercise adherence.56\nThese findings suggest that exercise self-efficacy is a crucial cognitive mechanism by which pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia may affect exercise adherence behaviors in patients after TKA. Self-efficacy, a modifiable psychological factor, could be enhanced and increased through four major approaches proposed by Bandura, including performance accomplishments, verbal persuasion, vicarious learning and physiological, and emotional states or physiological feedback.34 For example, HCPs help patients to develop more detailed planning of early exercise, which contributes to attaining exercise goals, thereby increasing mastery experience. And focusing on small successes that have been achieved enhances self-efficacy.57,58 Patients with good self-efficacy and exercise adherence behaviors are encouraged and invited to share the successful experience of persistently participating in early exercise. And to improve verbal persuasion about the capacity, HCPs could provide more encouragement and persuasion to patients to perform early mobilization and exercise task, so that patients feel more confident to perform these tasks.58\nThis study adds to existing knowledge by showing that pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia have strong contributions to exercise adherence in post-TKA patients and that exercise self-efficacy may serve as a key mechanism for these correlations. The evidence from this study provides a direction for healthcare professionals to tailor targeted and effective interventions and measures to improve exercise adherence in post-TKA patients. Our findings suggest that exercise adherence in post-TKA patients with pain catastrophizing or kinesiophobia could be promoted by enhancing their exercise self-efficacy. HCPs are expected to pay closer attention to post-TKA patients who experience pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia and to apply effective measures and interventions strategies aimed at improving exercise self-efficacy. In this study, we focused on pain-related catastrophizing and kinesiophobia among post-TKA patients, while previous evidence also indicated that pre-TKA pain-related fear and anxiety were common, which are harmful for patients\u2019 recovery.59 Therefore, pre-TKA pain-related catastrophizing and kinesiophobia should be paid more attention in future studies. Furthermore, post-TAK patients need to continue functional exercise. However, the adherence to exercise was poor. Earlier evidence revealed that frequent physiotherapist\u2019s instruction helps the patients improve knee exercises and recovery outcomes.60 Thus, HCPs should explore establishing a post-discharge joint exercise guidance program based on physiotherapist."
