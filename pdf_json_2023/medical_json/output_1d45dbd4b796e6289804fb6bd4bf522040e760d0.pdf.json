Methods: In this prospective single-center study, participants with CRLM scheduled for chemotherapy were enrolled between May 2018 and June 2021. SWV measurements were obtained using shear-wave elastography at the CRLM site before and after initiating chemotherapy. Based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, the participants were categorized by chemotherapeutic response into responders (complete remission and partial remission) and non-responders (stable disease and progressive disease). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of changes in SWV measurements in predicting the chemotherapeutic response of CRLM. In addition, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify variables associated with PFS. Results: In total, 67 participants (40 men; mean age, 62.3\u00b110.1 years) were enrolled, including 34 responders and 33 non-responders.

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. Over half of patients with colorectal cancer develop colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) during the course of their disease [2]. The standard treatment for patients with CRLM is chemotherapy [3], and evaluating the treatment response to chemotherapy is important for the selection of an optimal chemotherapeutic regimen to improve patient prognosis. Traditionally, the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) standard has been used to assess treatment response to chemotherapy, relying on morphological criteria based on changes in tumor size [4]. However, among patients who receive chemotherapy, morphological changes such as tumor size reduction as assessed by RECIST have been found to occur relatively late, while functional or molecular changes often occur earlier [5,6].\nEfforts have been made to overcome the limitations of RECIST and assess treatment response earlier than changes in tumor size may occur, with shear-wave elastography (SWE) reportedly showing promise in this area [7-9]. SWE is a quantitative ultrasound technique that can be used to evaluate tissue stiffness by measuring shear-wave velocity (SWV) [10]. Since shear waves propagate at different velocities in tissues with varying stiffness, SWE has been widely used for characterizing tissues, such as grading liver fibrosis or differentiating malignant from benign tumors [11,12]. When patients with CRLM receive chemotherapy, changes such as tumor necrosis, desmoplastic reaction, or degeneration within CRLM occur [13]. These changes can affect SWV values, and changes in SWV measurements may have the potential to predict treatment response and prognosis in patients with CRLM. The usefulness of SWE in predicting treatment response has been investigated primarily in patients with breast cancer, as the breast is a superficial organ that can be easily assessed using SWE [7,8]. A recent study by Lee et al. [9] demonstrated that SWE can also be applied to the liver, similar to its application in the breast, and indicated that a decrease in SWE predicts better progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with\nCRLM. However, that study had a small sample size (n=25) and was not a registered clinical trial. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prognostic role of SWV values for predicting chemotherapeutic response and PFS in a larger cohort of patients with CRLMs."

To obtain re l iable SWV measurements, a representative CRLM for each patient was selected based on these criteria: (1) larger than 1 cm in diameter; (2) free from artifacts such as motion or reverberation; and (3) well-defined, allowing for reliable follow-up SWV measurement during chemotherapy. Subsequently, SWV measurements were made by assigning regions of interest within the tumor [11,16]. For each tumor, SWV measurements were taken at the periphery of the tumor (Fig. 2). The periphery was chosen for assessment because metastases like CRLM often include central fibrosis or necrosis but contain viable cells at the periphery [17], making chemotherapy-induced changes more pronounced in peripheral areas. SWV measurements were taken 10 times per tumor, and the median SWV measurement was used as a representative value [9,10,18,19]. In each participant, SWV measurements were considered reliable when the interquartile range-to-median ratio did not exceed 15% [20]. SWV measurements were performed twice. The first measurement was taken on the same day as chemotherapy, but before its initiation. The second occurred 48 to 96 hours after the initiation of chemotherapy [9,13]. The 48- to 96-hour time window was chosen to allow flexibility in\nFig. 2.

Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify variables associated with treatment response. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out to assess the predictive performance of changes in SWV measurements for distinguishing non-responders from responders. Cutoff values for changes in SWV values were determined using the Youden index and by maximizing specificity for detecting non-responders. PFS curves were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

            "text": "This study found a sensitivity of 97.0% and a negative predictive value of 95.2% for predicting non-responders, with a cutoff value of a 13.0% decrease in SWV values in patients with CRLM. By employing a cutoff value of a 10.5% increase in SWV values, non-responders were predicted with specificity and positive predictive values of 97.1% and 93.3%, respectively. This predictive performance of SWV values can be attributed to the change in tumor stiffness caused by chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, cellular damage occurs, leading to tumor necrosis [24,25]. As a result, the cellular density of the tumor decreases, which can cause the tumor to soften, as detected by a decrease in SWV values. In other words, a decrease in SWV measured in the CRLM indicates that the tumor has become softer due to necrosis development after chemotherapy, implying that the chemotherapeutic regimen was effective. Furthermore, non-responders were more prevalent among participants with increased SWV values. This early prediction of non-responders to chemotherapy treatment could benefit patients with CRLM by providing the opportunity to try alternative chemotherapeutic regimens that may be effective, rather than continuing an initial regimen that would be ineffective at the followup examinations performed approximately 2 months later. Therefore, the authors cautiously suggest that a change in SWV values after starting chemotherapy in patients with CRLM has the potential to be used as a biomarker to predict the response to chemotherapy, which can aid in earlier assessments of chemoresponsiveness. In addition, the change in SWV values differed significantly between responders and non-responders in our study (-18.4% vs. 7.3%; P<0.001). This result contradicts that of a previous study by Lee et al. [9], which reported no significant association between changes in SWV values during chemotherapy and treatment response. The reason for this discrepancy may be due to the different methods of analyzing the change in SWV values: our study used the exact values of SWV changes during chemotherapy, whereas the study by Lee et al. [9] dichotomized changes in SWV values as decreased or\nincreased. Furthermore, the present sample size was larger than that in the previous study (67 vs. 25) and was derived by calculating a statistically reasonable number of participants, which would support the higher validity of our results.\nSignificant changes in tumor burden, such as PD, may occur over only a single cycle of chemotherapy according to the revised RECIST 1.1 criteria. However, if a significant change takes place over an extended period, the treatment response after only one cycle of chemotherapy would be assessed as SD, not PD. To account for this limitation in evaluating treatment response after a single chemotherapy cycle, this study assessed PFS, which could reflect a slower response to chemotherapy. A change in SWV values during chemotherapy was an independent variable associated with PFS (HR, 1.020; P=0.029), as well as response in the initial cycle after chemotherapy and the presence of five or more CRLMs. This finding highlights the relatively long-term prognostic value of changes in SWV values for patients with CRLM undergoing chemotherapy and is consistent with the results of a previous study [9].\nLiver injury induced by chemotherapy, such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, has the potential to impact liver stiffness, which in turn can influence SWV measurements in tumors [21]. However, it is important to acknowledge a limitation of this study concerning the absence of an assessment of the effect of changes in background liver stiffness associated with chemotherapy. The authors recognize that liver injury resulting from chemotherapy is commonly observed in patients undergoing longer treatment regimens, typically encompassing six cycles [26,27]. In this study, the second SWV measurement was performed within 48 to 96 hours after chemotherapy, representing an early post-chemotherapy period. Consequently, the potential impact of chemotherapy on liver stiffness in our study may not have been significant. Additionally, follow-up CT images were examined to determine whether participants had liver injury, although the authors acknowledge that subtle injuries might not be detected on CT.\nThe present study had a few limitations. First, it was a singlecenter study, and SWV measurements were performed only once for each set, before and after chemotherapy, by a single radiologist. As a result, it was not possible to assess interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Second, pathological correlations were not conducted because obtaining tissue samples of CRLMs in patients undergoing chemotherapy is not feasible in real-world clinical practice. Third, only one representative CRLM was evaluated for each participant rather than all CRLMs, which could introduce selection bias. However, performing SWV measurements for all CRLMs would be time-consuming and may not be feasible in real-world clinical practice. Lastly, there was heterogeneity in the chemotherapeutic regimens used.\n464 Ultrasonography 42(3), July 2023 e-ultrasonography.org\nIn conclusion, an observed change in SWV values during the early stages of chemotherapy showed significant diagnostic potential for predicting non-responders in patients with CRLM. Additionally, the change in SWV value was independently correlated with PFS.\nORCID: Jae Seok Bae: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2768-7917; Jae Young Lee: https:// orcid.org/0000-0001-6946-6042; Dong Ho Lee: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8983851X; Sae-Won Han: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3275-431X; Yoojoo Lim: https:// orcid.org/0000-0002-4181-2916; Tae-You Kim: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-99862684"
