            "text": "When an expected utility decision-maker faces an increase in future risk, he changes his optimal saving decision in order to better accommodate his intertemporal consumption and risk exposure. The usual concept that arises in this type of analysis is the precautionary saving effect, which is the extra saving produced in response to the increase in future risk. Under additive risks, this effect is guaranteed as long as the third derivative of the utility function is positive (Leland 1968; Sandmo 1970; Kimball 1990).\nMost of the literature on precautionary saving assumes additively separable intertemporal utility functions and linear risks that are most frequently associated with a risk shock to future wages or to the interest rate (Menegatti 2007; Baiardi et al. 2014). In particular for interest rates, Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008) show that, when there is an increase in the Nth-degree risk in the return on saving, we observe a precautionary effect as long as the measure of relative \u00f0N \u00fe 1\u00deth-degree risk aversion exceeds N. This result is a generalization of the idea that, for secondorder risk increases, the condition that ensures precautionary saving is that the partial prudence index is greater than 2 (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1971). Recently, Magnani (2017) and Wong (2019) provided a new interpretation of these \u2019\u2019threshold conditions\u2019\u2019 for the cases of second- and higher- order risk increases that enrich the intuition. However, all these previous results are based on separable preferences and linear risk structures. In this paper, we advance the literature by relaxing both of these assumptions. This allows us to obtain new conditions, which help explain empirical findings that seem to be at odds with precautionary saving (Dercon 2005).\nIt is easy to find contexts where preferences are not intertemporally separable and risk structures are not linear. For example, heterogeneous agents with intergenerational transfer (which is a common feature of wealthy households) imply nonseparable intertemporal preferences (Ponce and Yuki 2006). We also have the case of ambiguous environments in dynamic settings (Gomes 2014; Peter 2019), or of habit-persistent models where past consumption has a direct effect on present utility (D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2003). Nonlinear risk effects are also not difficult to find in real world examples. For instance, Gunning (2010) describes developing economies that present nonlinear risk shocks due to credit market constraints and unsolved asymmetric information problems. In the insurance literature, we also find nonlinear effects in health care applications (Echazu and Nocetti 2013), where the health production function incorporates nonlinear cross effects between the marginal productivity of investment in health and the random variable that captures the risk effects. We also find nonlinear effects in self-insurance with technology risk (Li and Peter 2021) when decision-makers lack precise information about the benefits of risk mitigation. For these cases and others, a positive third derivative of the utility function (known as the prudence property) may not be enough to secure the precautionary effect (Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger 2008; Vergara 2017; Baiardi et al. 2020; Vergara and Bonilla 2021). Therefore, modeling nonseparable preferences and nonlinear risks are the key to understand decision-making in those contexts.\nTo study the effect of risk on saving, we decompose the risk shock using Davis\u2019s (1989) compensation method to distinguish between income and substitution effects of a risk increase. In our context, the income effect induces the prudent agent to save more in order to increase his expected income in the second period, when the uncertainty is present, whereas the substitution effect induces the risk-averse agent to save less in order to avoid the effect of an increase in risk. We show that a nonlinear risk shock amplifies both effects, and it also generates new effects that make it more difficult to sign the net effect on saving. We also show that, for the linear multiplicative risk case (interest rate and wealth risk), the income and substitution effects are slightly different from those found in Dardanoni (1988) for a utility function with two arguments and in Baiardi et al. (2020) for intertemporally separable preferences.\nWe share the perspective of Gunning (2010), who analyzed various sources of risk and studied labor, interest rate and wealth risk, and suggested that individuals in developing countries are exposed to great uninsured risks that are mostly nonlinear and have different effects on optimal decisions. Our paper is also related to Snow (2003) and Machina and Pratt (1997). The former decomposes a mean-preserving spread into a substitution and income effect but only for the case of an additively separable utility function with no specific applications whatsoever, and the latter extends the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970, 1971) characterization of a meanpreserving spread to a more general definition with an extension to second-order stochastic dominance. In this paper we develop specific applications and connect our results with recent literature on decision-making under risk through a perspective of using the signs of covariances that appear in optimal saving problems. This covariance representation has the advantage of incorporating not only the sign of the effects but also the magnitude of the slope of change. It is, therefore, potentially more informative than the usual representation of the typical comparative static analysis.\nIt is important to mention that we provide a theoretical grounding for the case in which increases in risk induce reductions in saving. This empirical regularity observed in the developing world (Dercon 2005 and Elbers et al. 2007)1, can now be explained under nonlinear shocks when comparing the effect of the income and substitution effect revealed using Davis (1989)\u2019s method."

The consumer has a utility function u\u00f0c1; c2\u00de, which is assumed to be continuous, 1 Elbers et al. (2007) looked at the situation in Zimbabwe, a low-income country with significant credit market constraints and an underdeveloped financial system, and discovered that increases in risk led to reductions in growth due to a drop in capital accumulation and saving. Risk increases did not induce a precautionary effect on saving and investment, highlighting the need to account for nonlinear effects.\nincreasing and concave in each argument, and at least three times differentiable. That is, u1 and u2 are positive while u11 and u22 are negative, where the subscripts denote partial derivatives. We assume that u12 \u00bc u21 0, meaning that consumption levels in the first and second periods interact as complements.2 Also, c1 \u00bc w1 s and c2 \u00bc g\u00f0h;w2; s\u00de, where h represents a stochastic shock that affects total income in the second period, w2 is a non-stochastic exogenous variable (second-period deterministic endowment) and s denotes saving. In order to avoid explosive behavior and to make sure that we have a concave problem with interior solution, we provide natural assumptions for the shape of function g. In particular, we assume that the function g is increasing in w2 and increasing and concave in s (gs [ 0 and gss 0), which implies that saving raises second-period consumption at a decreasing rate. The function g is also increasing and concave in h (gh [ 0 and ghh 0), which means that a positive shock of the random variable is beneficial to the decisionmaker at a decreasing rate. Finally, gs is increasing and concave in h; that is, gsh 0 and gshh 0, which implies that the random variable raises the incentive to save at a decreasing rate.3 It is worth noting that all of these assumptions regarding the curvature of g are intuitive in economic terms, and they also correctly represent a positive random shock with no explosive higher-order effects, thereby ensuring a concave and tractable program.\nLet F\u00f0h; s\u00de be the cumulative distribution function of h with support in the interval [a, b], where s is a parameter whose shift represents changes in risk, like in Diamond and Stiglitz (1974).

However, it has been customary in intertemporal economics to assume time-separable utility functions because of their simplicity and tractability (Baiardi et al. 2020). The problem with this assumption is that it rules out phenomena like intergenerational transfers or habit persistence (D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2003) and the positive effects of government spending on private consumption (Bilbiie 2009), which implies a positive correlation between first and second-period consumption (Gollier 2001). 3 For example, Gunning (2010) represents a capital income risk by making c2 \u00bc g\u00f0h;w2; s\u00de \u00bc w2 \u00fe \u00f01 d\u00des\u00fe hh\u00f0s\u00de, where w2 is the expected second-period labor income, \u00f01 d\u00des is the expected value of physical assets, d 2 \u00bd0; 1 is the depreciation rate and h(s) is the expected value of capital income. The function h(s) is increasing and concave, with h\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0. If d \u00bc 1 and h\u00f0s\u00de \u00bc rs, second-period consumption is c2 \u00bc g\u00f0h;w2; s\u00de \u00bc w2 \u00fe hrs, which is the usual interest rate risk case analyzed in the literature (Baiardi et al. 2020).

Later, Sinn (1983) and Meyer (1987) use it to define a location-scale family of distribution that allows mapping from the expected utility into the mean-variance space. Equation (12) is also related to the notion of \u2019\u2019strong increases in risk\u2019\u2019 by Meyer and Ormiston (1985) as an increase in c extends the support of h and allows us to go beyond the usual comparative statics of risk introduction to a comparative static considering increases in risk for already risk-averse agents.

Therefore, the compensation method (in a risky context) pursues the amount (given to or taken from w2) sufficing to obtain the same amount of c 2 if the choice of saving remains s\n. When the consumer experiences a mean-preserving spread, precautionary saving will induce an increase in saving. This increase in saving will, in turn, induce an increase in expected c 2.

The consumption in the second period is represented by\nc2 \u00bc g\u00f0lh \u00fe c ;u\u00f0c\u00de; s \u00de \u00f015\u00de\nThe compensation method implies the following compensation condition or random rule:\noc2 oc \u00bc gh \u00fe gw2uc \u00bc 0 \u00f016\u00de\nSolving for uc we get:\nuc \u00bc gh\ngw2 \u00f017\u00de\nIn order to obtain the substitution effect, we plug u\u00f0c\u00de into the first order condition (2) and apply the implicit function theorem to get\nds dc jcomp \u00bc \u00f0 Eu12 \u00fe Eu22gs\u00de\u00f0gh \u00fe gw2uc\u00de \u00fe Eu2\u00f0gsh \u00fe gsw2uc\u00de SOC\n\u00f018\u00de\nConsidering the compensation rule (16) and following Davis\u2019s (1989) assumption that gsw2 \u00bc 0, Eq. (18) is reduced to\nds dc jcomp \u00bc Eu2gsh SOC \u00bc cov\u00f0u2gsh; \u00de SOC \u00f019\u00de\nand, consequently, the substitution effect is linked to the sign of cov\u00f0u2gsh; \u00de. Now recall that Eq. (14) provides the total effect on s under a mean-preserving spread. In particular, a positive sign of cov\u00f0Uhs; \u00de \u00bc cov\u00f0\u00f0 u12 \u00fe u22gs\u00degh; \u00de \u00fe cov\u00f0u2ghs; \u00de guarantees precautionary savings. In addition, the compensation method provides the substitution effect by cov\u00f0u2ghs; \u00de. Therefore, cov\u00f0\u00f0 u12 \u00fe u22gs\u00degh; \u00de is the income effect. The sign of each covariance component is obtained by differentiating the following expressions:\no\u00f0 u12 \u00fe u22gs\u00degh o \u00bc f u122g2h u12ghh \u00fe u222g2hgs \u00fe u22ghhgs \u00fe u22ghghsgc\n\u00f020\u00de\nou2gsh o \u00bc fu22ghgsh \u00fe u2gshhgc \u00f021\u00de\nNote that the substitution effect is actually negative, which is given by the sign of (21). Also, by adding (20) and (21) and dividing by c, we get\nUshh \u00bc f u122g2h u12ghh \u00fe u222g2hgs \u00fe u22ghhgs \u00fe u22ghgsh|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl} Income effect \u00fe u22ghgsh \u00fe u2gshh|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl} Substitution effect\n\u00f022\u00de\nand we already know from previous propositions that, as long as Ushh [ 0, precautionary saving is guaranteed under a mean-preserving spread.\nWe can see from expression (22) that risk aversion and prudence are insufficient to ensure the existence of precautionary saving. To better understand our findings, let us rewrite Eq. (14) by separating the income and substitution effects as follows:\nds dc \u00bc cov\u00f0\u00f0 u12 \u00fe u22gs\u00degh; \u00de SOC \u00fe cov\u00f0u2ghs; \u00de SOC\nIt is worth noting that, according to (21), the substitution effect is always negative, whereas the income effects can be either negative or positive, given expression (20). As a result, our formulation implies that ds\ndc can be positive with precautionary\nsaving or negative, as suggested by Dercon (2005), in the case of developing countries.\nIn our model, an uncertainty shock is translated into a mean-preserving spread via lh \u00fe c , resulting in an increase in the spread parameter c. The substitution\neffect observed in (21) (which is derived from the compensation method) reflects the economic agent\u2019s desire to reduce risk exposure by decreasing saving in the face of an increase in risk. The substitution effect is always negative, given risk aversion (u22\\0), and a plausible assumption on the curvature of the function g (gshh\\0, explained in the previous section), as shown in (21). The income effect, on the other hand, represents and increases the riskiness of c 2 , which translates into a reduction in the certainty equivalent of c 2, which has both positive and negative effects on saving, as shown by (20). Part of the positive effect is due to prudence (u222g 2 hgs) and part of the negative effect is due to the nonlinear effects derived by function g (the component u22ghghs or u12ghh, for example). As a result, we cannot rule out any possible final effect on saving when we consider both the substitution and income effect in our nonseparable and nonlinear model. Under a positive shock of uncertainty, we may experience the traditional precautionary effect or, alternatively, we may also experience a decrease in saving, which is, as we explained earlier, an empirical fact found in some specific circumstances.\nTable 1 summarizes the income and substitution effects for different types of\nutility functions and risks.\nAt this point, it is important to mention that ghh and gshh allow having nonlinear risks in our analysis. As we mentioned before, nonlinearities are often present in developing economies where relevant risks are uninsured (Gunning 2010) and increases in risk have been proven to decrease saving instead of inducing a precautionary effect (Dercon 2005; Elbers et al. 2007). Note, then, that cases like the ones described above \u2013previously considered anomalies, from the traditional perspective of precautionary saving\u2013 are now incorporated into our general formulation.\nNonlinear risk also allows the theorization of new risks that are not commonly treated in the economics literature, like the risk of COVID-19 and its devastating economic consequences worldwide. In the end, Eq. (22) is a general expression that captures not only the traditional risk analysis commonly observed in the literature, but also new risks, with more complex functional forms and cross-related effects on saving.\nIn what follows, we will apply our general formulation to various sources of risk and define conditions for precautionary saving in each case. We connect these applications with previous literature and show that this general formulation\nincorporates the known results from precautionary saving but also provides space for nonlinear shocks and specific non-conventional types of risk."

            "text": "In this paper we developed a general formulation for the two-period model of saving and consumption under uncertainty, allowing for more general risk structures in the second-period uncertainty shock. We argue that nonlinear risk structures are a common feature in the developing world, as previous empirical literature suggests, and that they also appear when unexpected large-scale risks hit and affect the world economy as a whole. The most contemporaneous example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic downturn where still do not even know the shape its recovery will take.\nTo dive into the effects of increases in risk on saving, we use Davis (1989)\u2019s compensation method and observe that, when the consumer faces a mean-preserving spread, precautionary saving can be divided into an income and a substitution effect, and these effects can be represented by covariances. The substitution effect is negative, so the income effect must then be positive and larger in size than the substitution effect to induce increases in savings and the expected precautionary effect.\nThree applications are developed in the paper. In particular, we study the effects of various sources of risk such as income, interest rate and wealth risk. We then define the conditions for each case to exhibit the precautionary effect.\nFinally, when we go back to the classic set-up of the model and assuming additively separable utility functions, the conditions for precautionary saving relate to the concepts of prudence and relative prudence, which is consistent with current literature on saving under risk. Nevertheless, we discover that adding nonlinear effects into our generalized model allows for a more integral analysis of economic cases previously excluded under the traditional approach.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the useful comments of the Editor and two anonymous referees.
