    "abstractText": "A pseudoscalar \u201caxionlike\u201d field, \u03c6, may explain the 3\u03c3 hint of cosmic birefringence observed in the EB power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background polarization data. Is \u03c6 dark energy or dark matter? A tomographic approach can answer this question. The effective mass of dark energy field responsible for the accelerated expansion of the Universe today must be smaller than m\u03c6 \u2243 10\u221233 eV. If m\u03c6 \u2273 10\u221232 eV, \u03c6 starts evolving before the epoch of reionization and we should observe different amounts of birefringence from the EB power spectrum at low (l \u2272 10) and high multipoles. Such an observation, which requires a full-sky satellite mission, would rule out \u03c6 being dark energy. Ifm\u03c6 \u2273 10\u221228 eV, \u03c6 starts oscillating during the epoch of recombination, leaving a distinct signature in the EB power spectrum at high multipoles, which can be measured precisely by ground-based cosmic microwave background observations. Our tomographic approach relies on the shape of the EB power spectrum and is less sensitive to miscalibration of polarization angles.",

Is \u03d5 dark energy or dark matter? A tomographic approach can answer this question.

Our tomographic approach relies on the shape of the EB power spectrum and is less sensitive to miscalibration of polarization angles.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.105.123509\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA pseudoscalar \u201caxionlike\u201d field is a candidate for dark matter and dark energy in the Universe [1,2]. Like pion in the standard model of elementary particles and fields, a pseudoscalar can couple to the electromagnetic tensor F\u03bc\u03bd and its Hodge dual F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd via a Chern-Simons term in the Lagrangian density, L \u2283 \u2212 1\n4 g\u03d5F\u03bc\u03bdF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd [3,4], where g is the\naxion-photon coupling constant. This term rotates the plane of linear polarization of photons as they travel through space filled with \u03d5 [5\u20137]. Such a rotation produces nonzero odd-parity TB and\nEB power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization fields, which vanish in the standard cosmological model [8]. This effect is often referred to as \u201ccosmic birefringence,\u201d as it resembles birefringence in a material (see Ref. [9] for a review). The plane of linear polarization of CMB photons rotates\nclockwise on the sky by an angle \u03b2 \u00bc 1 2 g R t0 tLSS dtd\u03d5=dt, where d\u03d5=dt is the total derivative of \u03d5 along the photon trajectory, and the subscripts \u201c0\u201d and \u201cLSS\u201d denote the\npresent day and the last scattering surface of CMB photons, respectively. The CMB is an ideal target for measuring \u03b2, as it is proportional to the path length of photons when \u03d5 is evolving slowly. Cosmic birefringence can be caused by \u03d5 of dark energy\n[10,11] and dark matter [12,13], as well as by possible signatures of quantum gravity [14,15]. How can we tell the origin? The effective mass of \u03d5, m2\u03d5 \u2261 d2V=d\u03d52, is the key parameter, where V\u00f0\u03d5\u00de is the potential. The field does not change very much when m\u03d5 \u2272H\u00f0t\u00de, where H\u00f0t\u00de is the Hubble expansion rate at a time t; thus, \u03d5 would be dark energy today if m\u03d5 \u2272H0 \u2261H\u00f0t0\u00de \u2243 10\u221233 eV. The \u03d5 field with mass greater than this value would constitute a fraction of dark matter in the Universe today. A tantalizing hint for \u03b2 has been found in the EB power\nspectrum of the Planck mission with the statistical significance exceeding 3\u03c3 [16\u201318]. If confirmed with higher statistical significance in the future, it would have profound implications for the fundamental physics behind dark energy and dark matter, as well as for quantum gravity. Anticipating such a discovery, in this paper we show how to determine m\u03d5 using a tomographic approach to cosmic birefringence. There are two epochs in which linear polarization of the\nCMB was generated: (i) the epoch of recombination of hydrogen atoms and the subsequent decoupling of photons from plasma at a redshift of zrec \u2243 1090 [19]; and (ii) the epoch of reionization of hydrogen atoms at zrei \u2243 7 [20].

We can use this l dependence to infer \u03b2 from z \u2243 zrec to zrei and that from z \u2243 zrei to 0, i.e., tomography. For example, if m\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221231 eV, we should not detect the reionization bump in the EB spectrum at l \u2272 10 [23]. Such an observation requires a full-sky satellite mission like LiteBIRD [24] and would rule out \u03d5 being dark energy. The formula \u03b2 \u00bc 1 2 g R t0 tLSS dtd\u03d5=dt assumes an instantaneous last scattering at tLSS, but a finite duration of last scattering leaves unique signatures in the CMB power spectrum [12]. Ifm\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221228 eV, \u03d5 starts oscillating during or earlier than the recombination epoch, modifying the EB power spectrum at high l. This effect can be measured precisely by ground-based CMB observations such as Simons Observatory [25], South Pole Observatory [26], and CMB-S4 [27], which opens up new scientific opportunities for CMB experiments. In this paper, we solve the Boltzmann equation coupled\nwith the equation of motion (EOM) for \u03d5, assuming that \u03d5 is either a dark energy field or a \u201cspectator\u201d field with negligible energy density. The energy density of \u03d5 therefore does not enter the Friedmann equation explicitly. We show how the shape of the EB power spectrum depends on m\u03d5, and provide a forecast for future constraints on m\u03d5 and g\u03d5. The tomographic approach can also mitigate partially the\nartificial rotation angle, \u03b1, by miscalibration of polarization angles of detectors and other instrumental effects [28\u201332]. The artificial rotation affects the EB power spectrum at all multipoles equally, whereas the tomographic approach relies on the l-dependent effect. For example, the Galactic foreground emission experiences only a negligible amount of birefringence, and we can use the different l dependence of the foreground and CMB power spectra to determine \u03b1 and \u03b2 simultaneously [33]. As we show in this paper, the difference between recombination and reionization signals can probe 10\u221232 eV \u2272m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221231 eV (see Ref. [23] for an earlier, more qualitative study), and details of the shape of the high-l EB power spectrum can probe m\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221228 eV. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,\nwe present the Boltzmann equation and the EOM for \u03d5 [12,21,34,35]. Our approach is different from Ref. [36], which did not solve the EOM. In Sec. III, we solve these equations to calculate the EB power spectrum, and show new features that are important for cosmic birefringence tomography. In Sec. IV, we forecast expected constraints on the axion parameters for experiments similar to LiteBIRD [24], Simons Observatory [25], and CMB-S4 [27]. We discuss possible improvements for our calculation in Sec. V and conclude in Sec. VI. We use the Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker spacetime with a metric tensor given by a2\u00f0\u03b7\u00dediag\u00f0\u22121;1\u00de,\nwhere a\u00f0\u03b7\u00de is the scale factor of the expansion of the Universe. We use the conformal time, \u03b7, as time coordinates unless noted otherwise. We focus on the homogeneous axion background, \u03d5\u00f0\u03b7\u00de, and ignore inhomogeneity in \u03d5."

We did not include a2g\u03d5F\u03bc\u03bdF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd in the EOM, which is quadratic in cosmological perturbation and can be ignored safely. The field does not evolve very much when H\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u00bc a0=a2 \u226b m\u03d5. We choose the initial conditions at \u03b7in such that H\u00f0\u03b7in\u00de \u226b m\u03d5, \u03d50\u00f0\u03b7in\u00de \u00bc 0, and \u03d5\u00f0\u03b7in\u00de \u00bc \u03d5in. We do not include the energy density of \u03d5 in the Friedmann equation explicitly, but use H\u00f0\u03b7\u00de derived from a flat \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) model. This approximation is valid when the energy density of \u03d5 is negligible (e.g., a tiny fraction of dark matter) or the axion mass is so small (m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221233 eV) that it behaves as dark energy. The axion field with a tiny energy fraction can still induce a sizable amount of birefringence [37]. The EOM is a linear equation for \u03d5.

We implement Eq. (7) in the CLASS code [40,41] and calculate CEBl with the best-fitting Planck 2018 cosmological parameters for a flat \u039bCDM model [42]. One significant change made to the code is the treatment of B modes induced by scalar perturbations. Cosmic birefringence transfers a part of scalar E modes into B modes, and we need to compute \u0394B;l which vanishes otherwise. Specifically, we solve Eq.

In Fig. 2, we compare the evolution of \u03d5 with the\nepochs of recombination and reionization. The axion with m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221228.0 eV (green line) starts evolving significantly before recombination, which experiences a reduction in the amount of birefringence [12,13].\n123509-3\nThe axion with m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221230.3 eV (blue line) starts evolving after recombination but has decayed before reionization; thus, very little cosmic birefringence would occur after reionization. The axion with m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221231.2 eV (red line) starts oscillating during reionization, and that with m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221232.3 eV (black line) evolves only after reionization.

The tomography approach breaks this degeneracy by using the change in shape of CEBl induced by either m\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221232 eV [23] or the Galactic foreground [33]. The primordial tensor modes add small contributions to C\u0303EEl and C\u0303 BB l in the above equations, which can be safely ignored for the purpose of this paper."

However, the reionization bump does not disappear even for \u03b2rei \u00bc 0. The shape of CEBl can be understood as follows.

The first term dominates at l \u2273 20.\n123509-4\nThe second term produces the reionization bump at l \u2272 10. The third term was overlooked in Ref. [23]. The cross correlation of reionization and recombination E modes induces a small reionization bump even when the rotation angle is zero at reionization. This effect appears in the blue line of Fig. 3 where a small bump is seen at l \u2272 10. Therefore, there is always some CEBl at low l. When the rotation angle depends on time, CEBl is no longer given by Eq. (12).

Photons last scattered at different times experience different amounts of rotation of the plane of linear polarization, which can lead to partial cancellation of cosmic birefringence [12,13,48] as well as to complex features in CEBl at high l that can be used to probe m\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221228 eV in a completely new way. In the left panel of Fig. 6 we show CEBl for axion dynamics shown in the right panel. There are two effects on CEBl : the overall amplitude and shape.\n123509-5\nWe first discuss the amplitude, which changes dramatically depending on the value of \u03d5 during recombination. For m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221228.8 eV, \u03d5 is nearly constant, which results in CEBl \u221d CEEl except for the reionization bump. For m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.9 eV, \u03d5 starts evolving during recombination, resulting in a smaller CEBl . For m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.8 eV, \u03d5 averaged over recombination is tiny, resulting in a highly suppressed CEBl . For m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.7 eV, \u03d5 averaged over recombination is negative, hence CEBl < 0. In the previous work that did not solve the Boltzmann equation, the amplitude of CEBl has been calculated by averaging \u03d5 over the visibility function [13,37,48]:\nh\u03b2i\u2261 g 2 \u00bd\u03d5\u00f0\u03b70\u00de \u2212 h\u03d5iLSS ; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere\nh\u03d5iLSS \u2261 R \u03b7z\u00bc10 0 d\u03b7gvis\u00f0\u03b7\u00de\u03d5\u00f0\u03b7\u00deR \u03b7z\u00bc10\n0 d\u03b7gvis\u00f0\u03b7\u00de ; \u00f019\u00de\nwith \u03b7z\u00bc10 being a conformal time at z \u00bc 10.

We use gvis\u00f0\u03b7\u00de computed with CLASS as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 7 we compare \u03b2\u00f0eff\u00del computed from the Boltzmann equation and Eq. (18) for m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.9 eV (top panel) and m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.8 eV (bottom). It is clear that \u03b2\u00f0eff\u00del shows much more complex features than just the average value h\u03b2i shown by the horizontal lines. How can we understand such complex dependence of \u03b2\u00f0eff\u00del (hence C EB l ) on m\u03d5? We find that the location of the acoustic peaks in CEBl for m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.9 eV shifts to higher l compared to that for m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221228.8 eV (see the vertical dotted lines in Fig. 6). This peak shift is the origin of the oscillating behavior of \u03b2\u00f0eff\u00del at l > 100. The peak location is determined by DA=rs, where rs and DA are the sound horizon and angular diameter distance at\nlast scattering, respectively. In our fiducial cosmological model, DA=rs \u2243 \u00f01\u00fe zLSS\u00de1=2 where zLSS is the redshift of last scattering. For m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.9 eV, \u03d5 starts evolving before recombination, and the B modes are mainly generated in the early stage of recombination. In such case, DA=rs for the induced B modes becomes effectively large and the peaks shift to higher l. Ifm\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221227.7 eV, the time when polarization is mostly produced is close to that for m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221228.8 eV and the peak locations are almost identical to those of the black line while the amplitude is negative.\n123509-6\nThese features are important: we can use this complex dependence of CEBl to determine m\u03d5 in a completely new manner. While the overall amplitude h\u03b2i is degenerate with the miscalibration angle \u03b1 (unless we have access to l \u2272 10), the l dependence is not. This is relevant for ground-based CMB experiments (Sec. IV B)."

Lensing does not create CEBl but only distorts small-scale polarization anisotropies. To see this, we first note that CEBl is approximately given by Eq. (15). As discussed in Ref.

Since CEBl depends on m\u03d5 nonlinearly, the Fisher matrix formalism, in which the errors are estimated from curvature of the posterior distribution around the fiducial value, does not provide accurate results. We thus use the likelihood analysis. We define \u03c72 as\n\u03c72\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc fsky Xlmax l\u00bclmin \u00f02l\u00fe 1\u00de \u00bdC\u0302 EB l \u2212 C EB;th l \u00f0p\u00de 2 C\u0302EEl C\u0302 BB l ; \u00f024\u00de\nwhere CEB;thl is a theoretical model for the EB power spectrum and is given as the sum of the contributions from cosmic birefringence and \u03b1. For a given observed C\u0302EBl we compute \u03c72 for each parameter set, p \u00bc \u00f0m\u03d5; g\u03d5in=2; \u03b1\u00de, and obtain the posterior distribution, P\u00f0pjC\u0302EB\u00de \u221d exp \u00bd\u2212\u03c72\u00f0p\u00de=2 . We consider specifications similar to LiteBIRD [24],\nSimons Observatory (SO; [25]), and CMB-S4 [27]. For SO we assume lmin \u00bc 100, lmax \u00bc 2500, 6 \u03bcK-arcmin white noise, 1 arcmin Gaussian beam, fsky \u00bc 0.4, and no foregrounds. We also assume 30% residual lensing-induced B modes after delensing [52]. For CMB-S4 we assume the same beam, lmin, lmax, and fsky, but with 1 \u03bcK-arcmin noise and 10% residual lensed B modes [53].\n123509-7\nFigure 9 shows the expected 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 contours on log10m\u03d5 and g\u03d5in=2. We consider the LiteBIRD-like experiment with specifications given in Sec. IVA. The fiducial axion mass is m\u03d5;fid \u00bc 10\u221230 eV and g\u03d5in=2 is obtained from \u03b2rec \u00bc 0.35\u00b0 [16\u201318] via Eq. (18). The fiducial value of \u03b1 is set to zero. We marginalize the posterior distribution over \u03b1 using a prior distribution obtained from calibration of instruments. Specifically, we use a Gaussian prior, exp\u00bd\u2212\u03b12=\u00f02\u03c32\u03b1\u00de , with \u03c3\u03b1 \u00bc 0.5\u00b0 (top) and 0.1\u00b0 (bottom). The former precision is achieved already for calibration of the current generation of CMB experiments [54\u201356], whereas the latter can be achieved by employing a new calibration strategy [57\u201360]. The black dashed lines show the values of jg\u03d5in=2j giving \u03b2rec \u00bc 0.35\u00b0 for each m\u03d5. The spikes in m\u03d5 > 10\u221228 eV occur when CEBl at high l becomes highly\nsuppressed (see the blue line in Fig. 6). That is to say, we need a larger value of jg\u03d5in=2j to compensate for suppression of CEBl by a small value of h\u03d5iLSS [Eq. (19)]. We find that the prior on \u03b1 tightens the constraint on the\noverall amplitude parameter (g\u03d5in) significantly, butm\u03d5 can be constrained almost independently of the prior. We also find the same trend when removing the prior on \u03b1 entirely. This is because the information on m\u03d5 comes from the shape of CEBl . Form\u03d5;fid \u00bc 10\u221230 eV the reionization bump is already at its minimum (see the blue line in Fig. 4). Therefore, the shape of CEBl can tell us that m\u03d5 is greater than 10\u221232 eV, but cannot tell how large it is until m\u03d5 is so large that it affects the shape at high l. This explains an upper bound, m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221228 eV. The \u201cislands\u201d of parameter space seen inm\u03d5 > 10\u221228 eV are allowed because the peak locations of CEBl for the respective m\u03d5 in the islands happen to coincide with those for the fiducial mass of 10\u221230 eV, while the amplitudes are adjusted by varying g\u03d5in. The islands shrink when g\u03d5in is constrained by a tighter prior on \u03b1. For m\u03d5;fid \u00bc 10\u221228 eV the shape of CEBl at high l becomes quite different from that of \u03b1, which enables us\nBIRD-like experiment.FIG. 8. The expected 1\u03c3 error contours in the two-dimensional parameter space (\u03b1 and g\u03d5in=2 in units of degrees). The axion masses are m\u03d5 \u00bc 10\u221232 (top) and 10\u221230 eV (bottom). We show the results from the full l range (black), reionization bump (2 \u2264 l \u2264 20; orange dashed), and high multipoles (21 \u2264 l \u2264 500; green dot-dashed). We assume a LiteBIRD-like experiment without delensing. The black and green contours overlap in the top panel.\n123509-8\nto determine m\u03d5. However, the LiteBIRD-like experiment cannot determine such a large m\u03d5 accurately because of the limited angular resolution, giving only discrete islands of constraints (Fig. 10). Therefore, it gives effectively a lower bound for m\u03d5 almost independently of \u03c3\u03b1. Ground-based experiments such as SO- and S4-like\nexperiments have better sensitivity to large m\u03d5. In Fig. 11 we show the expected constraints for SO (m\u03d5;fid \u00bc 10\u221228 eV). The constraints tighten significantly compared to the LiteBIRD-like case. Some degeneracy between g\u03d5in and m\u03d5 still exist for \u03c3\u03b1 \u00bc 0.5\u00b0 (top panel): the shift of peak locations can be absorbed partially by a combination of the rescaled CEBl and \u03b1. The degeneracy is eliminated when a tighter prior is used (bottom panel). With CMB-S4 we can determine m\u03d5 precisely, independent of \u03b1 (see Fig. 12). As SO and CMB-S4 cannot measure the reionization\nbump, they can only place an upper bound on m\u03d5 if the fiducial mass is 10\u221230 eV. Thus, LiteBIRD and groundbased experiments are highly complementary."

            "heading": "V. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We have made some simplifying assumptions in our calculation of CEBl . First, we did not include the energy density of \u03d5 in the Friedmann equation explicitly. This assumption can be justified to some extent. For m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221233 eV, \u03d5 acts as dark energy and its energy\ndensity is included approximately as a cosmological constant in the Friedmann equation for \u039bCDM cosmology. For 10\u221232 eV \u2272m\u03d5 \u2272 10\u221225.5 eV, \u03d5 acts as a small fraction of dark matter today with the density parameter \u03a9\u03d5h2 \u2272 0.006 [61], which may be ignored for the current study. However, the change in shape of CEBl at high l is a subtle effect, which can be influenced quantitatively when \u03a9\u03d5 is included in the Friedmann equation. We leave the full treatment for future work. Second, we did not vary cosmological parameters when\ncalculating the expected future constraints on the axion parameters. This assumption can also be justified, as the\n123509-9\neffect of \u03d5 on CEBl is distinct from the cosmological parameter dependence of the parity-even temperature and polarization power spectra. Nevertheless, there may still be some subtle correlation between the cosmological parameters and the axion parameters, which should be accounted for when the axion energy density is included in the Friedmann equation. We now discuss possible future extensions of the\ncalculation. We did not include inhomogeneity in \u03d5, which causes anisotropic polarization rotation [62\u201364]. While there is no evidence for anisotropic birefringence [65\u201368], it seems natural to expect discovery of anisotropy if the 3\u03c3 hint of isotropic birefringence [16\u201318] is confirmed with higher statistical significance in future. Thus, incorporating anisotropic birefringence in the Boltzmann equation [35,48] would be a natural next step. We ignored the gravitational lensing effect on CEBl . The lensing would smear the acoustic peaks of CEBl and enhance the small-scale power, but these effects would not be degenerate with cosmic birefringence. Nevertheless, for completeness, the impact of the lensing effect will be included in future work. We have so far focused on cosmic birefringence by a\nsingle axion field, but it is entirely possible that cosmic birefringence is induced by multiple fields [15,69]. In this case, the time evolution of \u03b2\u00f0\u03b7\u00de becomes more interesting, which can be constrained by the tomographic approach. In this paper we considered two epochs, reionization and recombination, during which the polarization is efficiently generated. Other sources of polarization include the polarized Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies, the so-called remote quadrupole [70\u201373]. The polarization is generated after the epoch of reionization, and we can in principle use such large-scale polarization signals to probe \u03b2\u00f0\u03b7\u00de in a late-time universe."

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this paper, we solved the Boltzmann equation coupled with the EOM for an axionlike field \u03d5 to calculate the detailed shape of the EB power spectrum of the CMB due to cosmic birefringence. There are two critical axion masses: (i) m\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221232 eV, for which relative amplitudes\nof the reionization bump (l \u2272 10) and the high-l power spectrum are modified; and (ii) m\u03d5 \u2273 10\u221228 eV, for which the evolution of \u03d5 during recombination yields complex features (such as a shift in the locations of acoustic peaks) at high l. Such a change in shape cannot be mimicked fully by the miscalibration angle \u03b1, offering a powerful probe ofm\u03d5. In Ref. [23], this phenomenon was called \u201ccosmic birefringence tomography,\u201d as it allows us to measure the time evolution of \u03d5. Probing the first critical mass requires a full-sky\ncoverage by a satellite mission such as LiteBIRD [24], whereas the second one can be probed by ground-based experiments [25\u201327]. The important application of tomography is to distinguish whether \u03d5 is dark energy or (a fraction of) dark matter today. A convincing detection of the relative amplitude change of the lowand high-l power spectrum by LiteBIRD would rule out \u03d5 being dark energy. Ground-based experiments can constrain the value of m\u03d5, especially at \u227310\u221228 eV, almost independently of \u03b1. Together they can discover new physics and provide new scientific opportunities for CMB experiments [9]. Finally, the EB data at high l from on-going ground-\nbased CMB experiments such as Polarbear [74], Atacama Cosmology Telescope [75], and South Pole Telescope [76] may already set interesting constraints on m\u03d5."
