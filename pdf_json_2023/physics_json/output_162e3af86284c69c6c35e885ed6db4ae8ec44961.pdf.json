    "abstractText": "In this proof-of-concept study, a novel hybrid nanomaterial-based electrochemical sensor was developed for the simultaneous detection of four DNA bases. For the modification of the working electrode surface, graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) were synthesized using a solvothermal method. GOQDs were then used for the preparation of a hybrid nanomaterial with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (GOQD-MWCNT) using a solvothermal technique for the first time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the GOQDs-MWCNTs. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with the GOQDs-MWCNTs using NafionTM to prepare a GOQD-MWCNT/GCE for the simultaneous determination of four DNA bases in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.0) using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The calibration plots were linear up to 50, 50, 500, and 500 \u03bcM with a limit of detection at 0.44, 0.2, 1.6, and 5.6 \u03bcM for guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T) and cytosine (C), respectively. The hybrid-modified sensor was used for the determination of G, A, T, and C spiked in the artificial saliva samples with the recovery values ranging from 95.9 to 106.8%. This novel hybrid-modified electrochemical sensor provides a promising platform for the future development of a device for cost-effective and efficient simultaneous detection of DNA bases in real biological and environmental samples.",

            "text": "The key to the identity of any living organism lies in its genetic code, which is comprised of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA holds the instructions for the growth, development, reproduction, and functioning of all organisms. Although the genetic instructions from DNA result in the formation of complex protein structures, DNA can ultimately be broken down into one of the four nitrogen derivative nucleobases (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)). These four nucleobases subsequently fall into two subcategories: purines (paired together with two hydrogen bonds (T and A)) and pyrimidines (paired together with three hydrogen bonds (G and C) [1]. DNA naturally undergoes mutations due to environmental factors, aging, and lifestyle behaviours such as diet induced biochemical alteration and smoking [2]. Common mutations are mismatched nitrogen derivative nucleobases due to erroneous duplication of nucleosides that are undamaged, adducts that form on DNA or breakage of single and double strands [2]. With mutations in DNA, the range of genetic diseases is endless, such as cancer [3,4]. There has yet to be a cure for these genetically inherited diseases; thus, sensitive detection of the respective nucleobases may assist in the development of early anti-cancer agents that target specific DNA bases such as cis-platin. Furthermore, several metabolic diseases resulting\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1509. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13091509 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1509 2 of 16\nin abnormal levels of DNA bases such as HIV/AIDS, gout, Lesch\u2013Nyhan disease, and prostatitis can be diagnosed earlier [5,6]. To date, there are a wide variety of analytical methods that can detect DNA. One such method is ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography enabled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry. These methods were used to simultaneously detect 13 nucleosides and nucleobases in Cordyceps sinensis [7]. Capillary electrophoresis was used to detect A and C with high sensitivity [8\u201310]. Chemical luminescence studies made molecular recognition and DNA detection simple, sensitive and easy [10]. While Raman spectroscopy aided nucleotide identification and DNA sequencing [11]. Gas chromatography, spectrophotometric methods and high-performance liquid chromatography detected DNA bases in several different sample matrices [12\u201314]. These sophisticated analytical methods provided excellent quantification results; however, they may not be costand time-effective as the operations are complex and time consuming, requiring skilled technicians, making the cost for running these instruments expensive for routine analyses. With the huge commercial success of glucose biosensors, electrochemistry has gained attention for the analysis of other biomolecules with high sensitivity [15]. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of executing operations, portable devices have been developed to support electrochemical analysis at point-of-care sites [15]. As a result of non-specific adsorption issues, biosensors are generally challenged with the adsorption of the oxidized DNA products on the surface of the electrode. Thus, researchers have been attempting to address the issue of non-specific adsorption [16]. Oliveira-Brett et al. [17] reported the electrochemical oxidation of both pyrimidine and purine compounds using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in basic conditions. A linear range of detection (from 1 to 20 \u00b5M for pyrimidines and from 0.2 to 10 \u00b5M for purines) was established for the four nucleobases. GCE implements both the ceramic and glassy properties of graphite, which include hardness, low electrical resistance, extreme resistance to chemical contamination, low density and friction, impermeability to gases and liquids, high-temperature resistance, and low thermal resistance, making GCE popular in electrochemistry. Suprun et al. reported the electrochemical behavior of DNA bases on carbon electrodes [18]. Arul et al. used a modified GCE with AgNPs embedded covalent organic framework for the simultaneous determination of DNA bases [19]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) pose great chemical stability. When used for the modification of sensor surfaces, they aid in promoting electron transfer. Since 1991, the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of CNTs have been intensively studied [20]. To date, CNTs can be found in the forms of either multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). MWCNTs contain rolled-up graphene tubules that are centric to each other. SWCNTs, on the other hand, possess only one graphite sheet rolled up [21]. In order to prepare a MWCNT-modified graphite paste electrode (MWCNT-GPE), MWCNTs are usually mixed with a graphite paste that contains mineral oil, bromoform, Nafion\u2122, or liquid paraffin, and then packed into a glass or Teflon tube with a copper wire for electrical contact [22]. These electrodes could then be utilized to probe electrocatalytic and bioelectrochemical reactions [22\u201324]. CNTs are also widely used in the development of sensing surfaces in field-effect transistors and tips in scanning probe microscopy [25,26]. The latest research frontiers in carbon-based nanomaterials, carbon dots (CDs), graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) have opened new horizons in the field of electrochemical sensors. These nanomaterials present an excellent opportunity for biological sensing as they have great biocompatibility and intrinsically low toxicity [27]. They possess abundant edge sites for functionalization making them versatile as they present different possibilities for modification with attractive surface chemistries and other nanocomposites/nanomaterials. Furthermore, they maintain excellent electronic properties and large electro-active surface areas while being highly soluble in many solvents and relatively inexpensive to produce [28]. GOQDs and CDs can be used as electrode surface nanocomposites or signal tags for developing electrochemical bio-sensing strategies [29]. Due to its size, GOQDs have more\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1509 3 of 16\navailable edges, surface active sites, and a larger specific surface area than CDs. However, due to the long synthesis process of GOQDs, there is minimal commercial availability. Nevertheless, GOQDs as zero-dimensional graphene can be a great candidate for optical and electrochemical sensing applications [28,30]. In our previous studies, we modified GCEs with GO/MWCNTs [5] and GO nanoribbons in chitosan [31] for the simultaneous determination of four DNA bases. We have also shown that incorporating sugarcane biochar along with methylene blue in a graphite paste electrode can enhance the sensing of DNA bases using biocompatible material [6]. Researchers have also coupled carbon fiber microelectrodes with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to detect DNA bases [32]. Other reports included the use of epitaxial graphene to detect DNA bases [33]. Herein, GOQDs were synthesized and utilized for the development of a novel MWCNT/GOQDS hybrid nanomaterial via a solvothermal technique. The hybrid nanomaterial was incorporated into Nafion\u2122 polymer and drop-cast onto a GCE. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.0) for the simultaneous determination of G, A, C, and T. After the optimization of determination conditions, the hybrid nanomaterial-modified sensor was used for the determination of G, A, C, and T in artificial saliva using the standard addition method. This nanomaterial presents an opportunity to develop inexpensive, biocompatible materials that can be made into in vivo sensors that can be easily functionalized based on the analyte being sensed [27]. Ultimately, this sensor can be developed into a point-of-care device that can monitor, in real time, diseases that result in DNA nucleobase imbalances such as HIV/AIDS, gout, Lesch\u2013Nyhan disease, and prostatitis [5,6]."

Subsequently, 3 g of graphite was added to the mixture and stirred. A desired amount (18 g) of KMnO4 was added to the mixture and stirred for 4 h at 10 \u25e6C. As the mixture was stirred, the colour changed from purple to brown, indicating the oxidation of graphite. Once the stirring was completed, 300 mL of deionized water was added to stop the reaction. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to collect the product. The product was washed and centrifuged 3 times with ultra-pure water and dried at 70 \u25e6C overnight. The synthesis of GOQDs was adapted from Liu et al. [36]. Briefly, 500 mg of the GO was mixed with 5 g potassium permanganate and then 10 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid step by step under magnetic stirring. The mixture was transferred to an ice bath and then 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid was added slowly. The mixture was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave container and stirred.

The samples for TEM images were prepared by dispersing the nanocomposite in iso- propanol and an aliquot (5 \u00b5L) of the suspension was put on the carbon film with 300 mesh and copper grid (CF300-CU). The results are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1A,B show the TEM of MWCNTs with different magnifications. Figure 1E,F show the TEM of GOQD-MWCNT with different magnifications. In comparison with the TEM images of MWCNTs alone, GOQD-MWCNT images displayed the attached clusters of GOQDs, such as small nanoparticles on the surface of MWCNTs as indicated by arrows. Based on the TEM images, we estimated that the sizes of the GOQDs were approximately 15\u201320 nm in diameter, which agreed with previous literature [29,38,39]. For comparison, the TEM image of GOQDs is shown in Figure 1C. Figure 1D shows the AFM characterization of the GOQD, which was prepared by dispersing the GOQD in isopropanol, then adding a 10 \u00b5L aliquot onto a glass slide and allowing it to dry. The lateral sizes of GOQDs are in the range of 25\u201345 nm.

Figure 2 shows the typical DPV curves of bare GCE, MWCNT/GCE and GOQD- MWCNT/GCE in the presence of a mixture of G, A, T and C. The GOQD-MWCNT/GCE showed a significant increase in the peak currents of G, A, T and C, in comparison with those obtained using a bare GCE and MWCNT/GCE. Thus, this was clear evidence for the high electrocatalytic activity of GOQD-MWCNT in the electrochemical determination of G, A, T and C. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of GOQD-MWCNT could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the GOQDs with the MWCNTs. Due to the unique properties of GOQDs, the synergistic effect depends on the shape, size and high surface area of immobilized GOQDs on the surface of MWCNTs

            "text": "Using the GOQD-MWCNT/ , t effect of the p on the simultaneous determination of the four DNA bases was studied. Figure 3A shows the DPVs of the DNA bases spiked (16 \u00b5M G, A; 160 \u00b5M T, C) under various pH conditions ranging from pH 3.0 to 8.0. Based on this Figure, as the pH increased, the peak pot ntials of the analytes shifted to mor negative values. This shift is caused by protons\u2019 involvement in the analytes\u2019 electrooxidation mechanis , which results in changes in their oxidation peak potentials [5,31,41\u201345]. This highlights the importance of pH control in electrochemical measurements, particularly when detecting proton-involved analytes. Figure 3B demonstrates the linear relationship between the oxidation potential (Ep) and pH for the four DNA bases. The slope of the linear relationship indicated the relative number of protons and electrons that were exchanged in the oxidation reaction of the DNA bases [5,31,41]. The equations for these relationships and pH of the four DNA bases are shown in Figure 3B. Based on the equations, the observed slopes for G, A, T and C were 0.0562, 0.0660, 0.0597, and 0.0763 V/pH, respectively. These values were compatible with value m of the Nernstian slope (0.059 nmV/pH [42\u201345], where m and n are the numbers of protons and electrons exchanged, respectively). The results indicated a proton-coupled redox process with an equivalent number of protons and electrons being exchanged at GOQD-MWCNT/GCE.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1509 8 of 16ano aterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Differential\u00a0pulse\u00a0voltammograms\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0four\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases\u00a0(16\u00a0\u00b5M\u00a0G\u00a0and\u00a0A;\u00a0160\u00a0\u00b5M\u00a0T\u00a0\nand\u00a0C)\u00a0in\u00a025\u00a0mL\u00a0PBS\u00a0and\u00a0electrolyte\u00a0solutions\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0pH\u00a0conditions\u00a0between\u00a0pH\u00a03.0\u00a0and\u00a08.0\u00a0\nand\u00a0(B)\u00a0linear\u00a0relationship\u00a0between\u00a0Ep\u00a0and\u00a0pH\u00a0for\u00a0G,\u00a0A,\u00a0T\u00a0and\u00a0C\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0GOQD-MWCNT/GCE.\u00a0\nBased\u00a0on\u00a0these\u00a0results,\u00a0the\u00a0proposed\u00a0electrooxidation\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0four\u00a0DNA\u00a0 bases\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Scheme\u00a02,\u00a0Equations\u00a0(1)\u2013(4),\u00a0which\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0agreement\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0previously\u00a0reported\u00a0results\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0literature\u00a0[5,31,46\u201349].\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0Figure\u00a03A,\u00a0the\u00a0 voltammogram\u00a0displayed\u00a0well-defined\u00a0peaks\u00a0pH\u00a07.0\u00a0with\u00a0high\u00a0current\u00a0intensities\u00a0for\u00a0G,\u00a0 A,\u00a0T\u00a0and\u00a0C\u00a0at\u00a0low\u00a0oxidation\u00a0potentials\u00a0(except\u00a0pH\u00a08.0)\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0obtained\u00a0 using\u00a0other\u00a0pH\u00a0conditions.\u00a0In\u00a0addition,\u00a0pH\u00a07.0\u00a0was\u00a0close\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0physiological\u00a0pH\u00a0of\u00a07.4,\u00a0 thus,\u00a0pH\u00a07.0\u00a0was\u00a0chosen\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0optimum\u00a0pH\u00a0condition\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0simultaneous\u00a0determination\u00a0 of\u00a0four\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases\u00a0using\u00a0GOQD-MWCNT/GCE.\u00a0\n3.4.\u00a0Interference\u00a0Study\u00a0 Four\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases\u00a0can\u00a0coexist\u00a0at\u00a0varying\u00a0degrees\u00a0in\u00a0different\u00a0real-life\u00a0samples\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0 urine,\u00a0sperm\u00a0DNA,\u00a0serum,\u00a0and\u00a0saliva\u00a0 [5,32,50,51].\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0other\u00a0metabolites\u00a0may\u00a0 coexist\u00a0in\u00a0these\u00a0real\u00a0samples,\u00a0which\u00a0may\u00a0interfere\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0detection\u00a0of\u00a0these\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases\u00a0 such\u00a0as\u00a0glucose,\u00a0ascorbic\u00a0acid,\u00a0and\u00a0cysteine\u00a0[50].\u00a0Hence,\u00a0the\u00a0study\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0standard\u00a0addition\u00a0 of\u00a0each\u00a0DNA\u00a0base\u00a0is\u00a0important\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0whether\u00a0the\u00a0biomolecule\u00a0can\u00a0disrupt\u00a0the\u00a0detection\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0species.\u00a0In\u00a0all\u00a0experiments\u00a0conducted,\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0one\u00a0species\u00a0was\u00a0 increased\u00a0while\u00a0 the\u00a0others\u00a0were\u00a0kept\u00a0 at\u00a0 a\u00a0high\u00a0 constant\u00a0 concentration\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 solution\u00a0 throughout\u00a0to\u00a0test\u00a0the\u00a0electrooxidation\u00a0processes\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0analyte.\u00a0This\u00a0standard\u00a0addition\u00a0 study\u00a0for\u00a0G,\u00a0A,\u00a0T\u00a0and\u00a0C\u00a0is\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04A\u2013D.\u00a0Based\u00a0on\u00a0these\u00a0results,\u00a0the\u00a0peak\u00a0current\u00a0 of\u00a0one\u00a0analyte\u00a0increased\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0concentration-dependent\u00a0manner\u00a0while\u00a0the\u00a0peak\u00a0current\u00a0signals\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0three\u00a0bases\u00a0remained\u00a0unaffected\u00a0and\u00a0constant\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0relative\u00a0standard\u00a0 deviation\u00a0of\u00a0\u00b15.0%\u00a0(n\u00a0=\u00a03).\u00a0We\u00a0concluded\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0oxidation\u00a0processes\u00a0of\u00a0four\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases\u00a0 took\u00a0place\u00a0without\u00a0interfering\u00a0with\u00a0each\u00a0other\u00a0using\u00a0GOQD-MWCNT/GCE.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0 an\u00a0interference\u00a0study\u00a0was\u00a0conducted\u00a0using\u00a0varying\u00a0concentrations\u00a0of\u00a0ascorbic\u00a0acid\u00a0and\u00a0 glucose\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0whether\u00a0these\u00a0species\u00a0interfered\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0detection\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0four\u00a0DNA\u00a0 bases\u00a0(Figure\u00a0S4).\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a0S4,\u00a0even\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0cases\u00a0where\u00a0either\u00a0ascorbic\u00a0acid\u00a0or\u00a0 glucose\u00a0were\u00a0in\u00a0excess\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases,\u00a0negligible\u00a0interference\u00a0was\u00a0observed\u00a0for\u00a0 the\u00a0detection\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0four\u00a0DNA\u00a0bases.\u00a0\nFigure 3.

Additionally, based on Figure 3A, the voltammogram displayed well-defined peaks pH 7.0 with high current intensities for G, A, T and C at low oxidation potentials (except pH 8.0) compared with the results obtained using other pH conditions. In addition, pH 7.0 was close to the physiological pH of 7.4, thus, p 7.0 as chosen as the opti u p condition for the si ultaneous deter ination of four bases using - T/ E.\n. . t\ni t t i iff t l-lif l i , s , ser , a saliva [5,32,50,51]. t t\ni t i t r l s l , i i t f it t t ti f t s s c s l s , c r ic ci , stei e [ ]. , t t f t t iti\nf s is i rt t t see et r t e bio l l c isr t t etecti f t e ot er species.

Based on these results, the peak current of one analyte increased in a concentration-dependent manner while the peak current signals of the other three bases remained unaffected and constant with a relative standard deviation of \u00b15.0% (n = 3). e concluded that the oxidation processes of four DNA bases took place without interfering with each other using GOQD-MWCNT/GCE. Additionally, an interference study was conducted using varying concentrations of ascorbic acid and glucose to determine whether these species interfered with the detection of the four DNA bases (Figure S4). As shown in Figure S4, even in the cases where either ascorbic acid or glucose were in excess of the other DNA bases, negligible interference was observed for the detection of the four DNA bases.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1509 9 of 16 Nanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a02.

The concentrations of four analytes were increased in a stepwise manner, and the measurements were stopped when the saturation of peak current signals was reached. The voltammograms are shown in Figure 5A with the corresponding calibration curves and equations in Figure 5B\u2013E. For each analyte, the peak currents were subtracted by the background current of GOQD- MWCNT/GCE to produce \u2206I, and \u2206I was plotted against th conce tration of the analytes. All four calibration curves showed one segment. LOD was calculated by using the equation 3SD/m where SD is the standard deviation of the bl nk volt mograms ( = 10) and m is the slope of the curve obtained from the calibration curve. In addition, the repeatability of the GOQD/MWCNT/GCE wa nvestigated using the DPV technique f r 10 cons cutive trials while simultaneously detecting G, A, T, and C. The results in Figure 6 s ow that the relative standard deviations for G, A, T, and C were 2.36, .0 , 2.31, and 1.58%, respectively. Furthermore, the GOQD/MWCNT/GCE stability was investigated by measuring DPV signals for simultaneous detection of G, A, T, and C for 6 months in 0.2 M phosphate el ctrolyte solution (pH 7.0). The same conce tration of DNA b es was us d to record the DPV ignals. The retained peak pote tial and peak current (Ipa) values for G, A, T, and C were 98.3, 7.6, 98.1, and 97.5%, hi lighting the xcellent stability of the PBNS-PANI/GPEs.

            "text": "In this proof-of-concept work, the GOQD-MWCNT hybrid nanomaterial was developed and cast on the GCE surface using Nafion\u2122. To the best of our knowledge, this hybrid nanomaterial was used as an electrochemical sensor surface for the first time. The modified electrode was used for the simultaneous oxidation of four DNA bases: G, A, T, and C. The calibration curves were linear up to 50.0 \u00b5M for both G and A and up to 500.0 \u00b5M for e T and C. The LODs were 0.44, 0.2, 1.6, and 5.6 \u00b5M for G, A, T, and C, respectively. Finally, the GOQD-MWCNT/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of spiked G, A, T, and C in the artificial saliva samples with the recovery values ranging from 95.9 to 106.8%. We envisage that the electrochemical sensor provides a promising platform for the development of a rapid prescreening tool for the simultaneous detection of DNA bases in clinical diagnostic studies as well as in the quality control assessment departments of the pharmaceutical and food industries.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1509 14 of 16\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano13091509/s1, Figure S1: Cyclic voltammogram of a bare GCE in a solution of 5 mM of both K3[Fe(CN)6] and K4[Fe(CN)6] with 100 mM of KCl in 0.2 M PBS (pH 7.0).
