    "abstractText": "Due to their high electromechanical coupling and energy density properties, ultrathin piezoelectric films have recently been intensively studied as key materials for the construction of miniaturized energy transducers, and in this paper we summarize the research progress. At the nanoscale, even a few atomic layers, ultrathin piezoelectric films have prominent shape anisotropic polarization, that is, in-plane polarization and out-of-plane polarization. In this review, we first introduce the in-plane and out-of-plane polarization mechanism, and then summarize the main ultrathin piezoelectric films studied at present. Secondly, we take perovskite, transition metal dichalcogenides, and Janus layers as examples to elaborate the existing scientific and engineering problems in the research of polarization, and their possible solutions. Finally, the application prospect of ultrathin piezoelectric films in miniaturized energy converters is summarized.",

            "text": "Since the discovery and synthesis of piezoelectric materials, researchers have gradually realized that piezoelectric technology can be widely used in biomedicine [1\u20133], flexible electronic devices [4,5], flexible generators [6\u20139], ultrathin film vibrators [10], piezoelectric photoelectronic solar cells [11,12] and many other fields. Many kinds of piezoelectric materials have been reported to have high piezoelectric properties and high electromechanical coupling, such as epitaxial wurtzite ScxAl1-xN ultrathin films [13] and nanocomposite [14,15]. In addition, the premise of high performance, coupled with the principle of being green, environmentally friendly, safe and sustainable, calls for the emergence of a number of new materials; for instance, lead-free 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3\u20130.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 nanowire [16], lead-free perovskite [17] and lead-free nanocomposites [18]. Generally speaking, microscopically, potential piezoelectric materials only originate from materials with a non-centrosymmetric microstructure. The work of Gowoon Cheon et al. [19] describes 325 potential two-dimensional (2D) piezoelectric materials. They are not piezoelectric in the bulk phase but lack central symmetry in the monolayer. There are 32 crystal symmetry groups, among which 21 have broken central symmetry. Surprisingly, 20 of them have directly observed piezoelectric responses. Piezoelectric materials were first discovered in naturally occurring natural products (quartz crystals and Rochelle salt). Monocrystalline, polycrystalline and polymer materials with better piezoelectric properties were discovered or synthesized later [20]. The classification of piezoelectric materials is given in Figure 1. Grounding three different criteria, completely different classification results will be showed. Furthermore, each type of material uses several materials to illustrate [21,22]. Most importantly, our focus is on all the parts of the diagram marked blue, that is to say, the type of polarization is a key factor. In Section 3, in-plane and out-of-plane polarization will be introduced in more detail. Nevertheless, previous attention and research has focused mainly on materials with broken central symmetry [23\u201325]. Recently, in the reporting of D.-S. Park et al. [26], the piezoelectric phenomenon was realized in a centrosymmetric oxide. Unlike other methods,\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3107. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16083107 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3107 2 of 24\nthis exciting breakthrough was achieved by regulating the inserted oxygen vacancy with an applied electric field. In this regard, it also provides a new way to induce piezoelectricity. Under the action of a direct current (DC) electric field, the degree of defect migration has been significantly improved, which is represented by the numerical leap of dielectric constant. As a result, the achievement leads to the ultra-high voltage electrical property of the film [27]. Xiaoqing Yang et al. also used the first-principles method to predict the longitudinal piezoelectric effect of the oxide family AO (A = Cd, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, etc.) under the action of biaxial strain [28]. After this, it was also proved experimentally that the piezoelectric constant is enhanced in the 2D limit [29]. At the macro scale, a strain with a particular large gradient is required to cause significant polarization in the material, whereas, at the nano scale, even a small strain can do so [30,31]. For example, for the star material MoS2 in the 2D monolayer, an independent monolayer material is obtained experimentally through various preparation methods, and its piezoelectric properties are characterized [32,33]. These works provide an experimental basis and proof for 2D ultrathin piezoelectricity. Additionally, the layer odd\u2013even dependence of the piezoelectric response was also found [33].\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 25\nNevertheless, previous attention and research has focused mainly on materials with\nbroken central symmetry [23\u201325].

Additionally, we also observe that the intrinsic difference of polarization mechanism between thin film and bulk material lies in the difference of anisotropy. Afterwards, we find that there are layer thickness effects and odd\u2013even effects in these materials that already have theoretical and experimental foundations. Hence, we also summarize the physical mechanism grounding the instance of MoS2 and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Notably, the modes applied by the strain have the potential to induce novel quantum effects, which will be the focus of future research. In Section 3, we classify ultrathin piezoelectric films from an entirely different perspective from most of the previous reviews: ultrathin in-plane piezoelectric films and ultrathin out-of-plane piezoelectric films. Moreover, based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), Janus structure and novel ultrathin films, the piezoelectric polarization mechanism and modification methods are analyzed. For the purpose of helping the workers who are interested in ultrathin piezoelectric films to clarify the components and their respective characteristics, we compiled the details included in this review. Finally, in Section 4, we summarize the current research progress of ultrathin piezoelectric films and their applications in energy harvesting and conversion and point out that there are still unavoidable defects and limitations in the fabrication of 2D materials within the scope of current technology."

            "text": "The piezoelectric effect results from the uneven distribution of ions in the crystal structure in some materials [40]. \u201cElectric charge that accumulates in response to applied mechanical stress in materials that have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures\u201d is defined as piezoelectricity [41]. A piezoelectric material is one that can achieve energy collection and conversion through the piezoelectric effect. Typically, the dipoles are randomly distributed in the crystal structure and call for an equilibrium state of electroneutrality on a macroscopic level. In these materials, though, electrons and holes move in opposite directions towards the metal-semiconductor interface due to a piezoelectric potential, which is generated by an external stimulus (polarization). The behavior by which the dipole tends to the same random direction is known as the piezoelectric polarization effect [42]. The connection between elasticity and electrical behavior is made successfully from then. The piezoelectric effect can be modulated by regulating the interface properties of the electron transport as well as photoelectric properties [43]. The piezoelectric polarization effect can be divided into direct effect and inverse effect. The schematic diagram of the two working mechanisms is shown in Figure 2. Direct piezoelectric effects occur when the existing dipole balance in the crystal structure is disturbed due to the application of mechanical stress (stretching or compression) or vibrations. This disturbance results in an unbalanced distribution of charge, contributing to a surface charge density that is able to be captured by the electrode [44]. In this process, mechanical energy is converted to electric energy [45]. Conversely, the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is an inverse piezoelectric effect. The whole process can be described as applying an electric field of a certain magnitude to the piezoelectric material. This effect causes a mechanical displacement within the material. The intrinsic equation of the two effects can be expressed as bellow [41]:\nDirect Effect : D = dT + \u03b5E (1)\nInverse Effect : S = sT + dE (2)\nwhere T stands for the stress, d stands for the piezoelectric constant, S stands for the strain, D stands for the electric displacement, E stands for the electric field intensity,\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3107 4 of 24\ns stands for the mechanical flexibility, and \u03b5 stands for the dielectric constant of the material.

The reason for the phenomenon is that the response of the opposite direction layers is cancelled out. Meanwhile, any strain or electric field perpendicular to its surface will theoretically produce a zero piezoelectric response [30]."

This property is useful in that can be used to achieve different energy conversion effects by applying stretching or compression effects in different directions. In order to screen, distinguish and store different energy signals, it is often necessary to use anisotropic materials to design devices.\nTable 1.

            "text": "With the development of energy equipment towards miniaturization, the critical scale of transducers needs to be reduced. The scale of ultrathin films in this review is defined to the nanometer scale. Most 2D materials have intrinsic piezoelectric polarization. We introduce the piezoelectric properties of TMDs, h-BN and black phosphorus (BP). A schematic of each of these structures is shown in Figure 3. Ultrathin piezoelectric films are expected to be widely used as a result of their stresselectric conversion characteristics. Graphene has the longest history of study among 2D materials [103\u2013105], and therefore was the material in which researchers initially tried to achieve the piezoelectric effect. Grounding the piezoelectric mechanism, the effect calls for the breaking of central symmetry. Swapnil Chandratre and Pradeep Sharma achieved the piezoelectric effect in 2D materials for the first time by digging triangular holes in graphene [106]. Shortly after, Mitchell T. Ong et al. chemically modified graphene with hydrogen and fluorine adsorbed on different position, and induced both in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric effects [107], as shown in Figure 4. Ultrathin nanosheets of layered TMDs have tunable electronic structures, so as to be attractive for piezoelectric energy harvesting. TMDs can be represented as MX2 (M = Cr, Mo, W, Nb, Ta and X = S, Se, Te) [64]. Monolayer TMDs are constructed by a metal plane surrounded by two dichalcogenide planes [108]. Hexagonal structured monolayer TMDs are usually semiconductors and belong to D3h space group, the breaking of whose symmetry leads to piezoelectricity [109]. Duerloo et al. first predicted that 2D TMD materials are piezoelectric by the first-principles method [66]. MoS2 is the most widely studied TMD and it is worth going into more detail on. Monolayer MoS2 generates intrinsic electric dipoles due to the displacement of cationic Mo atoms and anionic S atoms when subjected to external strains. Additionally, the inherent electric dipoles lead to a voltage between the two sides of MoS2. The piezoelectric property of monolayer MoS2 is only restricted to the in-plane (d11) direction rather than the out-of-plane (d33) direction, since the symmetry feature along the vertical z-axis of monolayer MoS2 stays the same as in the initial state. Furthermore, Wu [71] and Zhu [33] et al. experimentally realized piezoelectricity in monolayer MoS2. Zhu et al. measured a piezoelectric coefficient of e11 = 2.9 \u00d7 10\u201310 C m\u22121 in a free-standing single layer of MoS2. Additionally, they observed a finite and zero piezoelectric response in odd and even numbers of layers, respectively, which is in sharp contrast to bulk piezoelectric materials [33]. This is because the intrinsic difference of the polarization mechanism between thin film and bulk material relies on the difference of anisotropy. The measurement results are shown in Figure 5b. This is because symmetry is broken only in odd layers, while it is restored in even layers. The measurement method is shown in Figure 5a. The MoS2 film was indented with a scanning\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3107 9 of 24\natomic force microscopy (AFM) probe, aiming to convert the in-plane stress to an out-of-plane force. The induced stress then changed the load on the tip and the curvature of the cantilever, which could be measured by the deflection of a laser beam [33]. Additionally, in the study of Wu et al., as shown in Figure 6, MoS2 was placed on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrate [71]. Uniaxial strain was applied to the MoS2 in the manner of mechanically bending the substrate. Therefore, periodic stretching and releasing of the substrate can generate piezoelectric outputs in external circuits with alternating polarity [71]. However, in principle, the exfoliated monolayer MoS2 lacks mechanical durability. Ju-Hyuck Lee et al. fabricated bilayer WSe2 with a mechanical durability of up to 0.95% of strain via turbostratic stacking [Figure 7a]. This form can increase the degrees of freedom in the bilayer symmetry and finally lead to non-centrosymmetry in the bilayers [Figure 7b] [72,110]. The density function theory (DFT) simulation results are shown in Figure 7c.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 25 289\u2013380 [92] 117 [92] ~250\u2013700 [97]\nAlN\n4.50 [92] 6.40 [92]\n5 [98,99]\nSapphire 6.40 [92]\nGaN 4.50 [92]\n128\u00b0 cut LiNbO3 12 [92]\n36\u00b0 YX cut LiTaO3 12 [92]\nPVDF Film\n\u221233 23 [44]\n\u221235 [92]\n~20\u201330 [90,100]\n3.1.

Yang et al. calculated the piezoelectric coefficient of monolayer MX (M = Sn or Ge, X = Se or S) and found that the in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d11 of MX was the biggest among 2D materials [68]. This result is two orders of magnitude larger than that of routinely used piezoelectric semiconductors, such as ZnO and monolayer MoS2. This is because monolayer group IV monochalcogenides have a unique \u201cpuckered\u201d C2v symmetry, as well as electronic structure. Monolayer h-BN is a wide-band insulator with the same crystal structure as graphene. Unlike graphene, monolayer h-BN is piezoelectric due to the asymmetry introduced into the structure by the two sublattices (B and N). The elastic and piezoelectric effects were theoretically calculated using Born\u2019s long-wavelength theory [111]. In 2020, Yang Nan et al. studied hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets through molecular dynamics simulations. Their simulation results indicated that the piezoelectric constants of boron nitride nanosheets depend very strongly on the macroscopic shape (Figure 8), while being nearly independent of the macroscopic size (Figure 9) [101]. In addition, when strain is applied to h-BN, some novel quantum effects, such as the quantum spin Hall phase [112], are born. These novel quantum effects, when combined with piezoelectric polarization effects, are bound to prompt researchers to ponder more interesting scientific questions.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3107 11 of 24\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 25 the exfoliated monolayer MoS2 lacks mechanical durability.

The piezoelectric properties of BP are demonstrated due to its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure [113]. In addition, surface-oxidization is an effective way to enhance the piezoelectricity of black phosphorene, since this method can break the structural symmetry. By first-principles methods, the calculated piezoelectric coefficients d11 for surface-oxidized BP are manifested as 88.54 pm V\u22121, which is comparable to those of group-IV monochalcogenides and larger than that of 2D h-BN and MoS2 [77]. However, this method of stripping or traditional chemical and physical vapor deposition can likely introduce defects or other impurities, which can interfere with the results of the study. It is worth further consideration by researchers. There are many kinds of means to control the properties of 2D materials, such as substitutional doping, staking, surface adatoms, or defects to break the centrosymmetry of pristine materials [114]. However, these strategies of regulating mainly affect the outof-plane piezoelectric properties, which will be discussed later. The in-plane piezoelectric properties are little affected by these methods in principle, since the intrinsic asymmetry of materials is the factor most important to in-plane piezoelectric properties. Unconventionally, in 2022, Park et al. induced high levels of piezoelectricity in centrosymmetric oxides [26]. They used a DC electric field to rearrange the oxygen vacancies in the CeO2\u2013x (CGO) thin film. The crystallographic symmetry was broken and piezoelectric effects were induced in centrosymmetric materials. The piezoelectricity is measured by applying an additional alternating current (AC) electric field (EAC). When the AC electric field is in the same direction as DC, oxygen vacancies are pushed up, which causes the material to expand. Conversely, when the AC electric field is in the opposite direction to DC, oxygen vacancies are pushed oppositely [27]. Their results show that the piezoelectric coefficients (d33) can reach up to nearly 200,000 pm V\u22121 at a frequency of 10 mHz under a DC electric field of 1 MV cm\u22121. This data is particularly significant, being two orders of magnitude larger than the ferroelectric oxide. They also discovered that the field-induced redistribution of oxygen vacancies could induce a cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition [26], as shown in Figure 10b. This inspired people to apply this method to more materials or look for new mechanisms to generate piezoelectricity.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 25\nchanges of different size boron nitride nanosheets when strained along the armchair direction and\n(c) zigzag direction [101].

TMDs are ideal candidates as low-dimensional piezoelectric materials, owing to their structural non-centrosymmetry [33]. Due to in-plane inversion s mmetry breaking, it was proved through experimental aracterization and theoretical calculation that only i trinsic inplane piezoelectricity exists in TMDs [64,66,117].

The piezoelectric coefficient d31 of Sc2CO2 MXene reaches 0.78 pm V\u22121. At 2.5% strain, 0.1 V vertical piezoelectric voltage can only be produced in such ultrathin Sc2CO2 monolayer [86]. Similarly, BiCrX3(X = S, Se, and Te) is a kind of piezoelectric ferromagnetism material with both in-plane and outof-plane polarization at room temperature. Additionally, this is another breakthrough in high-performance piezoelectric materials [128].

This is owing to the unique double-buckled stacking structure of these LiMX2 monolayers [87]. Later, it was found that \u03b3 phase structure (\u03b3-LialS2 and \u03b3-LialSe2) also has an excellent out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient; even the number is twice as high as that of \u03b2 phase structure [88]. When compared with the piezoelectric coefficients of other materials as shown in Figure 15, it is evident that the \u03b3-LiMX2 structures are very promising materials for high-performance piezoelectric nanodevices. Zr2P2BrCl monolayer is of particular interest for its ferroelasticity, controllable anisotropic properties along the in-plane direction and outstanding out-of-plane piezoelectricity. These monolayers have a strong out-of-plane piezoelectricity since the heterogeneous charge distribution results from its broken mirror symmetry. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 = 129.705 pm V\u22121 of Zr2P2BrCl monolayer is actually significant, which is two orders of magnitude higher than MoSTe multilayers. It can even be a new alternate material for the design of memory devices, robot bionic skin or multipurpose nanodevices [89].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3107 18 of 24\nTable 3.

            "text": "The intrinsic differences of ultrathin films, thick films and bulk materials regarding polarization due to gradually reduced anisotropy are explored in the first part of this review. When the thickness of material gradually decreases to several atoms thick, the effective piezoelectric polarization will enhance significantly. Secondly, several promising materials with strong anisotropy, such as ZnO, MoS2 and Zr2P2BrCl monolayer, are screened by summarizing the piezoelectric coefficient, polarization direction and preparation quality of the ultrathin films. It is noted that there are great difficulties in the acquisition and preparation of ultrathin piezoelectric films. The available methods have inevitable shortcomings and limitations, such as introducing a large number of defects, which is also a great challenge faced by the large family of 2D materials. Thirdly, based on the traditional piezoelectric hexagonal boron nitride structure, the effect of layer thickness, strain modes and sizes on polarization, and the novel quantum effects induced by it, such as topological state, quantum Hall effect, etc., are analyzed in detail. Particularly, the polarization mechanism of a few-atom-thick material is demonstrated by taking the symmetrically polarized monolayer TMDs as an example. In addition, to illustrate the construction and modification of a 2D piezoelectric material module, the Janus structure is taken as an example. Through this review, we have found that ultrathin piezoelectric films have made rapid progress and become a promising structure in the development of miniaturized energy conversion equipment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.L., Z.X. and H.L.; validation, B.L. and L.T.; investigation, B.L., Z.X. and H.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.L., Z.X. and H.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.T. and K.C.; supervision, L.T. and K.C.; funding acquisition, L.T. and K.C.
