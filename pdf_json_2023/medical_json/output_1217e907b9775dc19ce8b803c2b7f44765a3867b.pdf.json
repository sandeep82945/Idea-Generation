Moreover, it develops through an unclear pathophysiological mechanism, and effective therapies are lacking. Recently, RNA modification, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, has been found to be involved in various physiological processes and to play important roles in many diseases. However, the role of m6A modification in endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury is still in its infancy. Therefore, we attempted to construct the m6A modification map of myocardial injury in a rat model treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and explore the role of m6A modification in LPS-induced myocardial injury.\nMethod: Myocardial injury adolescent rat model was constructed by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit was used to detect overall level of m6A modification in rat cardiac tissue. m6Aspecific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were conducted to identify the altered m6A-modified genes and differentially expressed genes in cardiac tissue of rats treated by LPS and control rats (6 versus. 6). Bioinformatics was used to analyze the functions of differentially m6A modified genes, differentially expressed genes, and genes with both differential m6A modification and differential expression. qPCR was used to detect expression of m6A modification related enzymes.\nResult: We found that the overall level of m6A modification in cardiac tissue of the LPS group was up-regulated compared with that of the control group. MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq results showed that genes with differential m6A modification, genes with differential expression and genes with both differential m6A modification and differential expression were closely associated with inflammatory responses and apoptosis. In addition, we found that m6A-related enzymes (Mettl16, Rbm15, Fto, Ythdc2 and Hnrnpg) were differentially expressed in the LPS group versus. the control group.\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nConclusion: m6A modification is involved in the pathogenesis process of LPSinduced myocardial injury, possibly through the regulation of inflammatory response and apoptosis-related pathways. These results provide valuable information regarding the potential pathogenic mechanisms underlying LPSinduced myocardial injury.\nKEYWORDS\nm6A, cardiac, inflammation, apoptosis, endotoxaemia"

            "text": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host responses to infection (1). Approximately 48.9 million people worldwide are diagnosed with sepsis each year, and sepsis led to ~11million deaths in 2017 (2). Sepsis is often accompanied by multiple-organ dysfunction, involving conditions such as acute kidney injury, acute lung injury, and myocardial injury. Notably, epidemiological studies have found that the incidence of myocardial injury was as high as 70.2% in children (3), and sepsis-induced myocardial injury was closely related to mortality (4). In addition, endotoxic shock is a subtype of sepsis and is often accompanied by myocardial injury (5, 6). However, the pathophysiological mechanism of endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury is still unclear, and no specific drug can be targeted to treat endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury. Our team has found that myocardial apoptosis, inflammatory disorders (6), mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress (7) and autophagy (8) were involved in the occurrence and development of endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury. Epigenetic modifications have also been implicated (6), but many aspects of the occurrence and development of endotoxaemia/sepsisinduced myocardial injury remain to be discovered.\nm6A modification is the most frequent internal modification of eukaryotic mRNAs, and such modifications influence diverse fundamental cellular functions, such as pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear transport, stability, translation, and microRNA biogenesis (9). Recently, m6A modification has been found to be associated with the occurrence and development of many diseases, such as cancer (9), cardiovascular diseases (10). Moreover, recent studies showed that m6A modification played an important regulatory role in mediating inflammation responses, which was to be associated with the occurrence and development of endotoxaemia/sepsisinduced myocardial injury. For example, m6A methyltransferase Mettl3 could regulate inflammatory responses through IGF2BP1/ HDAC4 dependent manner in LPS-induced cardiomyocytes (11). However, as a widespread RNA modification, m6A modification sites and regulatory mechanisms are still worthy of further study.\nHere, considering endotoxin can trigger all of the cardinal feature of sepsis on its own and likely is a modulating factor during the syndrome (5), we conducted myocardial injury rat model of LPSinduced endotoxic shock and performed MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq to identify differentially m6A-modified RNAs and differentially\n02\nexpressed RNAs involved in LPS-induced myocardial injury. Then, understanding the functions that these differentially m6A-modified RNAs may be involved in regulation through bioinformatics. Combined analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq helped us identify genes that may be regulated bym6A at RNA levels. Detection of m6Arelated enzymes helped us understand which enzymes might play important functions by regulating m6A modification."

This study conformed to the relevant ethical standards. The rats used in this study (Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd.; Beijing, China) had a Wistar genetic background. The rats were adolescent, male, and pathogen-free; weighed approximately 160-180 g; and were housed in cages at 24\u00b0C with a 12h alternating light/dark cycle and free access to water and food. An adolescent rat model of endotoxic shock was generated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS, as we described previously (6). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 20% urethane (1g/kg, i.p.). The left femoral artery was cannulated (Biopac MP150; Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA, USA) to continuously measure the mean arterial pressure (MAP). After the MAP stabilized, LPS (L-2880; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was administered i.p. (20 mg/kg, 10 mg LPS dissolved in 1 ml of 0.9% saline). 2 hours after LPS injection, MAP began to decline, and the model was considered successful when MAP decreased by 20-25 percent. The control group was injected with an equal volume of 0.9% normal saline solution. The preliminary experiment found that the death rate of rats was relatively high 24 hours after injection of LPS, but could basically be stabilized to 12 hours. In order to obtain the pathological changes in the late stage of LPS-induced myocardial injury, we selected 12 hours after injection of LPS to conduct this study. Twelve hours post-LPS or normal saline injection, euthanasia was performed, and the left ventricle was excised and placed in an RNase-free centrifuge tube, quickly placed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u00b0C. Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta at 12h post-LPS or saline administration and centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 10 min) after incubation at room temperature (15\u00b0C-25\u00b0C) for 15 min. Supernatants were\nfrontiersin.org\ncollected and stored at -80\u00b0C for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Six pairs of left ventricles with endotoxaemia or controls were selected for MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq, and the remaining samples were saved for validation experiments."

The MAP in rats decreased by 25- 30% 2h after LPS administration (Supplementary Figure 1). Firstly, we assessed cardiac function using echocardiograph. As shown in\nFrontiers in Immunology 04\nTable 1, the IVSd, LVIDd, LVIDs, LVEDV, LVESV, SV, HR and CO were deceased significantly in the LPS group while the LVPWd and LVSs were increased significantly in the LPS group. However, no difference in LVPWs, EF and FS were observed between two groups. Then, we detected the pathological changes in the cardiac tissue founding that myocardial cells showed greater disorder and inflammatory cell infiltration in the LPS group than in the control group (H&E staining; Figure 1A). Strikingly, serum c-TNI and CKMB (markers of injury to cardiomyocytes) were significantly elevated in the LPS group (Figure 1B, C), as was the serum inflammatory biomarker, IL-6 (Figure 1D).We also analyzed the protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1b) in the heart using western blot. The protein expression levels of IL-6, IL-18, and IL-1b were upregulated in the LPS group compared to the control group (Figure 1E), suggesting inflammatory injury of cardiac tissue in the rat model induced by LPS.\nIn addition, higher total m6A modification levels were found in the LPS group than that in the control group (Figure 1F). Thus, we performed transcriptome-wide MeRIP-seq and RNA-Seq to generate an m6A modification map in cardiac tissue of rats with LPS-induced myocardial injury.\n3.2 Differential m6A modification patterns in cardiac tissue of rats treated by LPS and control rats\nNext, we compared the m6A peaks between LPS group and control group.

Most genes had one to three m6A modification sites (Supplementary Figure 2B).\nIn addition, we identified the top five consensus motifs for the m6A peaks in the LPS group and the control group (Figure 2C). RRACH motif was identified in both groups, where R = G or A; A = m6A, and H = U, A, or C, as described (19). The m6A peaks were predominantly distributed in coding sequences and the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) (Supplementary Figure 2C). Finally, m6A peaks were analyzed in whole transcriptome data and divided into exon, intergenic, intron, 3\u2019UTR, 5\u2019UTR regions, based on their location in RNA transcripts. The peaks were mainly distributed in 3\u2019UTR, exon and 5\u2019UTR and different distribution patterns were observed between the two groups. The LPS group showed slightly more m6A peaks in the exon (27.97% versus. 28.15%) and 3\u2032UTR (56.24% versus. 56.62%) and slightly less m6A peaks in the 5\u2032UTR (15.56% versus. 14.97%) than the control group (Figure 2D).\nFurthermore, we found 14,360 m6A peaks in the LPS group and the control group, 5,740 of which were differentially modification (P < 0.05).

However, no targeted treatments are available for this condition. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms underlying endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury remain unclear. Thus, it is necessary to explore the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury. m6A modification is a widespread mRNA modification in eukaryotes that participates in post-transcriptional gene regulation (9). Regulators of m6A modification include m6A writers, erasers, and\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\nreaders. m6A writers include Mettl3, Mettl14, Wtap, Rbm15/15b, Virma (Kiaa1429), and Zc3h13, which function together with m6A methyltransferase or cooperatively regulate m6A modification. Notably, dynamic m6A methylation can be reversed by nuclear m6A erasers, including Fto and Alkbh5 (24). In addition, m6A readers can regulate mRNA splicing, nuclear export, decay/degradation, translation, and stability by passing the m6A signal (9). The dysregulation of m6A modification and m6A-related enzymes have been found to be associated with cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarction (10), heart failure (19) and cardiac hypertrophy (25), but the role of m6A modification in endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury is relatively unexplored.\nIn this study, we conducted the rat model of LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Strikingly, we did not find changes in ejection fraction and shortening fraction of echocardiography results. We speculated that the possible reasons were: 1. Myocardial injury was not serious enough; 2. Ejection fraction and shortening fraction were affected by reduced afterload (26, 27), resulting from vascular paralysis existed in our model. Therefore, the ejection fraction and shortening fraction may remain unchanged even with reduced cardiac systolic function. Some studies have proposed that the diagnosis of endotoxaemia/sepsis-induced myocardial injury based on EF values may underestimate its incidence and lead to increased mortality (26).

To investigate whether cardiac systolic dysfunction existed in the rat model of LPS induced endotoxic shock, we detected cardiac systolic function by an invasive hemodynamic study in previous studies (6, 7, 28). The MAP began decreasing 2 h after LPS injection, accompanied by significant decreases in the heart rate, peak rate of left ventricular pressure rise, and left ventricular peak rate of pressure decay, as well as a prolonged relaxation time constant. These studies showed that our model existed reduced cardiac systolic function and was stable. In this study, although we did not conduct invasive hemodynamics study, we did examine the decreased MAP as an indicator of endotoxic shock.\nMoreover, as highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial damage, clinical studies have proved that troponin (cTn) including c-TNI and c-TNT were correlated with a greater degree of left ventricular dysfunction, illness severity, and mortality of sepsis patients (23, 29, 30). CK-MB was also biochemical markers of myocyte necrosis (31). We found that the markers of myocardial injury (c-TNI and CK-MB) of serum were up-regulated significantly, indicating the presence of some extent of myocardial injury in the LPS group. In addition, inflammatory markers\nFrontiers in Immunology 10\nincluding IL-6, IL-18 and IL1b of cardiac tissue were also upregulated significantly, indicating inflammatory injury in the LPS group. Furthermore, we have found increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis with LPS challenge by TUNEL staining in previous studies (6, 32). Therefore, there was myocardial injury in the LPSinduced endotoxic shock rats constructed in this study.\nWe performed MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq in cardiac tissue of rats treated by LPS and control rats. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that differentially expressed RNAs were mainly concentrated in inflammatory responses and apoptotic pathways. For example, the Hippo signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are closely associated with apoptosis (33\u201336). Our team have found infiltration of inflammatory cells and cardiomyocytes apoptosis existed in the cardiac tissue of rats with LPS-induced myocardial injury in previous study (7, 32). Other studies have also shown that inflammation and apoptosis are important pathophysiological processes of LPS-induced myocardial injury (37, 38). For example, TNFa, IL-6, IL1b and other inflammatory factors can directly or indirectly cause myocardial injury (39, 40). Chinese herbal preparations\nA B\nDC\nfrontiersin.org\nmay alleviate LPS-induced myocardial injury by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis (41).

In addition, Dubey et al. demonstrated that increased m6A-RNA methylation and Fto suppression was associated with myocardial inflammation and dysfunction during endotoxaemia in mice (42) and Shen et al. reported that Mettl3 knockdown repressed the inflammatory damage of LPS-induced cardiomyocytes by regulating m6A modification on HDAC4 mRNA (11). These studies indicated that m6A modification was involved in molecular regulation of inflammation in LPS-induced myocardial injury. In this study, we explored the differential m6A modification sites in cardiac tissue of rats with LPS-induced myocardial injury and control rats using deep sequencing, providing more potential regulation mechanisms and therapeutic targets. For example, we found that Stat3, Hif1a and Creb1 were the most interacting genes among the up-regulated m6A modified genes, while Tp53, Mapk11 and Hsp90aa1 were the most interacting genes among the downregulated m6A modified genes by PPI network analysis. Tp53, Creb1, Mapk11 and Hif1a have been reported to be closely related to apoptosis (43\u201346), while Stat3 and Hsp90aa1 are classical molecules of inflammatory response (47, 48). Our sequencing results found that these genes were modified by m6A and what role does m6A play in these genes deserve further investigation in LPS-induced myocardial injury. Moreover, other apoptotic and inflammatory pathways in the MeRIP-seq results are also worthy of further exploration, including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Hippo signal pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetes complications, MAPK signaling pathway, etc (33\u201336). These studies and results suggested that m6A modification may play an important role in LPS-induced myocardial injury through regulation of apoptosis and inflammatory response.\nNotably, m6Amethylation participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes and may regulate RNA-expression levels. Therefore, we performed combined analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq to identify potential genes that may be regulated by m6A modification at RNA level. Enrichment results of genes with both differential m6A modification and differential expression showed that inflammatory responses and apoptosis were significantly enriched. Moreover, Lasso analysis was used to identify key genes that may be regulated by m6A modification (49). These genes may play a more important role in LPS-induced myocardial injury and deserve further attention. Furthermore, we performed MeRIP-qPCR and qPCR to verify the m6Amodification and RNA expression levels of Lrrk2, Sele, Tnfrsf9, Bdkrb2, and Hsp90aa1 in the LPS group and the control group. Lrrk2 is closely associated with the MAPK pathway and participates in many inflammatory diseases (50, 51). Recently, Liu et al. reported that Lrrk2 deficiency protected against cardiac remodeling under pressure overload (52). Sele, as an adhesion molecular, was reported to be involved in occurrence and development of various inflammatory diseases (53). Tnfrsf9 is involved in T cell and natural killer cell activation and cytokine production and plays a critical role in LPS-induced septic shock (54). Bdkrb2, a receptor for bradykinin which act as mediators of pain and inflammation, can activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second\nFrontiers in Immunology 12\nmessenger system (55). Hsp90aa1, an inducible molecular chaperone that functions as a homodimer, can bind LPS and mediates LPSinduced inflammatory response, including Tnf secretion by monocytes (48). In addition, GO analysis revealed that Tnfrsf9, Bdkrb2, and Hsp90aa1 were significantly enriched in the apoptosis pathway. These genes with both differential expression and differential m6A modification provide a new idea for molecular regulation mechanism of LPS-induced myocardial injury. Furthermore, we found Mettl16, Rbm15, Fto, Ythdc2, and Hnrnpg were differentially expressed which may participate in regulation genes with differentially m6A modification in cardiac tissue of rats with LPS-induced myocardial injury compared to control rats, providing a new perspective for further exploring the regulation mechanism of m6A modification."

This study also has some limitations, such as the lack of deeper mechanistic research, the lack of exploration of m6A modification changes at early stage of endotoxaemia and MeRIP-seq including only mRNA but not noncoding RNAs. More research is needed to explore these aspects in the future."
