    "abstractText": "An effective strategy has been developed for the photoredox-catalyzed decarboxylative addition of cyclic amino acids to both vinylogous amides and esters leading to uniquely substituted heterocycles. The additions take place exclusively trans to the substituent present on the dihydropyridone ring affording stereochemical control about the new carbon-carbon bond. These reactions are operationally simplistic and afford the desired products in good to excellent isolated yields.",

            "text": "Reductive addition of carbon-centered radicals to electron-deficient olefins, known as the Giese reaction, has been utilized in a number of synthetic applications including total syntheses [1\u20137]. Visible-light photoredox-catalyzed Giese reactions have garnered a great deal of interest in recent years as a valuable method for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds in an atom-economical manner under relatively mild reaction conditions. Recent examples of carbon-centered radicals utilized in the Giese reaction have been generated via carboxylic acids [8\u201310], trifluoroborate salts [11,12], secondary and tertiary alcohols [13\u201315], organosilicates [16\u201318], alkyl halides [19], and via triplet enone diradicals [20]. Decarboxylative Giese reactions involving readily available amino acids have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds leading to the formation of molecules not previously accessible by other methods [8,9]. Reactions leading to increasing molecular complexity are extremely valuable synthetic tools and our interest in this area was inspired by the unique reactivity of cyclic vinylogous amides and esters of type 3 and 4 (Figure 1). It was envisioned that addition of carbon-centered radicals generated via a photocatalytic decarboxylation of amino acids would allow for the preparation of unprecedented and novel heterocyclic scaffolds 3 and 4. In this manuscript we document our investigations in this area.

A high throughput screen of 24 photocatalysts was conducted employing potassium phosphate dibasic or potassium carbonate as bases and dimtheylformamide (DMF) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents. The starting materials were dosed into pre-assembled vials containing a separate photocatalyst and base and were irradiated at 450 nm for 24 h. The samples were then analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). The first screen yielded two \u201chits\u201d for the desired mass. The photocatalysts of interest were identified as (Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbby))PF6 [22] and 1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-4,6-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) [23] employing potassium phosphate dibasic and DMF. These reactions were subsequently scaled up to 100 mg scale and purified by mass-directed HPLC. Interestingly, upon examining the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of the isolated product it was found that the radical added exclusively trans to the phenyl group on the dihydropyridone. We speculate that the initially formed product 7 undergoes cyclization to aminal 8 during the mass-directed purification which employed aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and acetonitrile. The observation that the radical approached trans to the phenyl group was further supported by molecular calculations which demonstrated that a cis approach is 3.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than the trans approach. This is perfectly in line with the fact that substituents on dihydropyridines bearing a carbamate prefer an axial orientation due to A1,3 strain between an equatorial substituent and the carbamate. This is also in line with the fact that Grignard reagents favor the trans products when reacted with dihydropyridones of type 5. The resulting steric environment of the axial substituent leads to the radical approaching from the opposite face leading to the observed cis-isomer. Although the desired product was formed in the reaction, the isolated yield was <10% for the iridium photocatalyst and < 5% for the 4CzIPN catalyst. Reexamination of the crude reaction mixture revealed that at least two other major products had formed but were inseparable from one another. After a series of NMR experiments on the crude reaction mixture the structures were determined to be a 2:1 mixture of 2+2 dimers 9 and 10. It is believed that the initially formed radical generated from amino acid 6 is sufficiently stable or self-quenches and dimerization becomes the major pathway. We speculate that intermolecular photocycloaddition leading to compounds 9 and 10 occurs through energy transfer from the iridium catalyst upon light absorption. The reaction was repeated with several other primary, secondary and tertiary acyclic amino acids and similar results were obtained.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 417. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27020417 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 417 2 of 13"

Our attention then turned to screening cyclic amino acids in order to probe whether these would have better reactivity and deliver the desired product in useful yields. The initial photocatalytic screen was performed employing dihydropyridone 5 and Boc Lproline 11 (Scheme 2). The same optimal conditions discovered above were found also in this screen and the desired product was formed in much higher apparent yield. The optimal conditions employed were to irradiate at 450 nm the dihydropyridone 5 in DMF in the presence of 1 mol% Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbby) and 2 equiv of both K2HPO4 and Boc L-proline for 20 h. Under these conditions, the desired product 12 was obtained in 82% isolated yield and as a 1:1 inseparable mixture of diastereomers about the carbon where the radical was formed. There were only trace amounts of 2 + 2 dimers in the crude NMR and these were easily separable from the products In addition, the trans product was the exclusive product formed, there being no detectable amounts of the cis products formed in the reaction.

In each of these cases the observed diastereoselectivity increased to 4:1; however, these diastereomers were inseparable from one another. Reaction of chromenone 30 with the radicals generated from amino acids 11 and 21, was also successful providing the addition products 35 and 36 in good yields and as inseparable mixtures of diastereomers. In addition, the radical generated from tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid gave product 37 in 68% isolated yield where the individual diastereomers could be separated from each other. Finally, reaction of chro enone 30 with amino acid 15 afforded heterocycle 38 in 92% yield and as a 1:1 mixtur of separabl diastereomers.\nScheme 5. 4-oxoquinoline 29 and chromen-4-one 30.

            "text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the photoredox-catalyzed decarboxylative formation of carbon-centered radicals from cyclic amino acids followed by conjugate addition to both cyclic vinylogous amides and esters provides access to novel heterocyclic structures. This versatile method is both mild and efficient giving rise to structural complexity previously inaccessible through current synthetic methodologies. Further manipulation of the products toward more complex synthetic targets is possible and will be disclosed in due course.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded.
