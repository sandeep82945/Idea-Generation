            "text": "Beneficence4 \u2014 while it is important to \u2018do good\u2019, there is sometimes an assumption that doing anything is better than doing nothing. Non-maleficence4 \u2014 the prevalence of presenteeism5 when doctors are unwell suggests that this principle is largely overlooked, potentially putting patients at risk.6 This may also put clinicians at risk through stress, poor performance, overwork, burnout, or disciplinary action. This can be expressed as a duty to work safely \u2014 The General Medical Council\u2019s (GMC\u2019s) Good Medical Practice7 emphasises patient safety and the need for patients to be treated to a high standard and in a timely fashion, but\nsays little about protecting the health and wellbeing of the doctor or the potential danger to patients from overworked doctors.8 Little is said either about the duty to be brave enough to escalate issues so that the responsibility is not completely assumed by the frontline clinician.\nSocial, professional, and cultural expectations \u2014 this relates to the organisational culture of the department or practice and to the social, professional, and cultural norms that are accepted and shared by the health professionals. For example, how acceptable is it for one doctor (if they are swamped) to ask another for help in getting through their workload? Related to this is the level of involvement of \u2018management\u2019 (those who lead and run the department or organisation) in day-to-day operations. Do messages about inadequate levels of staffing and toxic workload reach their ears? Consider the \u2018core values\u2019 of the NHS \u2014 these include a statement about compassion: \u2018We respond with humanity and kindness to each person\u2019s pain, distress, anxiety or need.\u2019 9 Does this apply to our clinical colleagues in the NHS as well as patients? Compassion can flourish when people feel safe, but if everyone is under huge stress then it may wither."

            "text": "Doctors do have a responsibility to do their work to a safe level and quality, and should have regard for the wider effects. There should be a balance between timely care and good-quality care. Individual doctors also have a responsibility not to put themselves at risk of error, disciplinary action, or health problems. Good Medical Practice doesn\u2019t specifically raise this issue, but it is surely unprofessional to persist with a working pattern that a doctor knows is likely to put them at risk of regulatory action or censure.\nExtracts from the GMC\u2019s Good Medical Practice:7\n\u2022 \u2018Good doctors make the care of their patients their first concern\u2019 (para 1);\n\u2022 \u2018Good doctors \u2026 do their best to make sure all patients receive good care and treatment\u2019 (para 2);\n\u2022 \u2018You must take part in systems of quality assurance and quality improvement to promote patient safety\u2019 (para 22);\n\u2022 \u2018You must take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is or may be seriously compromised. If a\n\u201cA \u2018black alert\u2019 results in demand being diverted to the next nearest service that is not yet overwhelmed, and we wonder what could provide a safety net of this kind in primary care.\u201d\n226 British Journal of General Practice, May 2022\nbjgpmay-2022-72-718-226.indd 1 12/04/2022 11:42\nEthics and toxic high-workload work environments\npatient is not receiving basic care to meet their needs, you must immediately tell someone who is in a position to act straight away. If patients are at risk because of inadequate premises, equipment or other resources, policies or systems, you should put the matter right if that is possible\u2019 (para 25); and\n\u2022 \u2018You must offer help if emergencies arise in clinical settings or in the community, taking account of your own safety, your competence and the availability of other options for care\u2019 (para 26).\nThere are professional, organisational, and societal pressures on individual doctors to work within accepted codes of practice; but it may be that these vary from one organisation to another, and are inadequately described, evidence based, and accepted.\nWhat is less clear is to what extent there is an individual duty of engagement with patient groups, the mainstream media, or social media to correct unhelpful or toxic narratives. How should the establishment and fellow professionals view doctors who are courageous (or foolhardy) enough to do this?\nEmployers have a responsibility10 to ensure that the workload on each member of staff is manageable; they have a common law duty to take reasonable care to safeguard staff health and safety, which includes controlling stress levels at work. Setting a daily cap on the number of patient contacts (or decisions) completed by each clinician, or declaring \u2018black alerts\u2019 if an organisation is under unmanageable pressure (common in secondary care but almost unheard of in primary care) might be options to consider. A \u2018black alert\u2019 results in demand being diverted to the next nearest service that is not yet overwhelmed, and we wonder what could provide a safety net of this kind in primary care. Those with management responsibility in general practice (such as GP partners in the UK) are not always themselves protected from such situations, and there should perhaps be much more recognition of the responsibilities of the organisation in GMC considerations. Heroic leadership at the frontline also has the potential to be toxic \u2014 if leaders expect staff to take on the same toxic burdens that they are struggling with.\nContractor responsibility for staff workload is relative \u2014 the degree of responsibility should be proportional to the degree of control that the doctor has over the work environment. While at first glance a GP partner might be seen as having a high level of control over the workload of each member of their staff, if in fact that expansion of the workforce isn\u2019t an option because of funding or the unavailability of suitable candidates then they don\u2019t have that control.\nWe would argue, however, that all of the above \u2014 individual doctors, employers, and contractors \u2014 do have a responsibility to take action over issues of unsafe workload, rather to ignore them. The approach of just ploughing on and working through the list of patients in front of you may be the simplest way of solving the short-term problem, but if it leads to the doctor becoming unwell (and absent from work), or to long-term recruitment problems to that particular work role or specialty, then that short-term solution causes a long-term problem. The risks of acquiescence \u2014 effectively supporting and colluding in an inherently unsafe system \u2014 seem to be frequently overlooked."

            "text": "We would propose a re-appraisal of our mutual obligations: what do we owe each other? What are the limits of these obligations? In terms of workload, we should be much clearer about when workload moves from obligatory to supererogatory \u2014 and then to dangerous. This may depend on the individual and the healthcare setting, but delineating some principles are clearly needed. Individual doctors must make a decision about how they should respond to being in a situation in which their workload is unacceptably high and unsafe. Retention of doctors in the profession might be improved if the options to stay and fight \u2014 whether taking non-patient-harming industrial action, whistleblowing, or simply gathering reports from colleagues to build a case for change \u2014 were clearer and more acceptable.\nThe risks and drawbacks of taking any of these actions need to be balanced against the very real risks of doing nothing and allowing an unsafe system to persist. We would propose a much broader debate on\nthese issues to explore and discuss more openly:\n1. The wider risks and negative effects of unacceptable workloads;\n2. Attitudes to and reasons for putting up with unsafe workloads;\n3. How the responsibility and liability for adverse events arising from unsafe workloads should be divided;\n4. How safe reporting systems for whistleblowers can be developed and implemented; and\n5. How safe organisational cultures around this toxic feature of the healthcare workplace can be embedded within the NHS.\nMartyn Hewett, Martyn Hewett is Head of Severn School of Primary Care, HEE, and a member of the RCGP Committee on Medical Ethics.\nEmail: Martyn.Hewett@hee.nhs.uk @drmartynhewett\nThis article was first posted on BJGP Life on 10 March 2022; https://bjgplife.com/toxic\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp22X719333\nAcknowledgements Martyn Hewett is grateful to the members of the Royal College of General Practitioners Committee on Medical Ethics for their advice and thoughts on this article.\nBritish Journal of General Practice, May 2022 227\nREFERENCES 1.
