    "abstractText": "Due to COVID-19 pandemic, different restrictive measures in terms of physical distancing and lockdowns have been introduced in most European countries, affecting all facets of social life. Currently, little is known about how partnered individuals perceive changes in their sexual life during this complex emergency. This study explored retrospectively assessed changes in sexual interest for one\u2019s partner and levels of distress related to perceived sexual interest discrepancy during the first phase of the pandemic in a large-scale online sample of partnered individuals (n = 4813; Mage = 38.5 years, SD = 10.74) recruited between May and July 2020 in seven European Union countries and Turkey. We also examined the possible role of approach/ avoidance motives for sex in reported changes in sexual interest and associated distress. Most participants (53%) reported no change in their sexual interest during the pandemic, followed by those who reported an increase (28.5%). The pattern was similar across the eight countries. Distress about discrepant sexual interest, which was only weakly related to changes in sexual interest, was significantly associated with relationship quality and emotional closeness with a partner, coping with and worrying about the pandemic, and specific motivation for sex. In contrast to avoidant and relationship-focused approach motivation, ego-focused approach motivation was related to stable sexual interest during the pandemic. The current study contributes to the understanding of the link between sexual interest and complex emergencies. Considering that the COVID19 pandemic continues, the reported experiences and perceptions are prone to change.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented global changes to daily life, both in public and private domains, affecting social life (Morris, 2020), economic activity (Fernandes, 2020), and psychological health (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). What makes this present crisis particularly challenging is the fact that there is no reliable narrative about its future dynamics, and even the optimism based on effective vaccines that may soon be available could be marred by increasing vaccine hesitancy (Lane et\u00a0al., 2018). The novelty and gravitas of this global disruption have spurred research activity, including studies focusing on reproductive and sexual health in times of the pandemic. Considering that complex crises, such as the current pandemic, have adverse effects on mental health\u2014which are commonly expressed through the increased prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms (Bendau et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020)\u2014the way they affect sexuality might be comparable (see Ibarra et\u00a0al., 2020).\nApart from focusing on the reduction of reproductive health and rights (Miranda et\u00a0al., 2020), increase in (mostly) domestic sexual aggression and violence (Mazza et\u00a0al., 2020; Roesch et\u00a0al., 2020; Usher et\u00a0al., 2020), disruption in sexual health services and increasing difficulties in accessing them (Aversa & Jannini, 2020; Miranda et\u00a0al., 2020), and risks of sexual transmission of SARS CoV-2 viral infection (Turban et\u00a0al., 2020), the emerging literature on the pandemic and sexuality also explored potential changes in sexual behavior and sexual well-being (Brotto et\u00a0al., 2021; Carvalho et\u00a0al., 2021; Lehmiller et\u00a0al., 2021). The current study aims to contribute to this developing body of knowledge about human sexuality under complex emergency circumstances by focusing on retrospectively assessed changes in sexual interest and sexual distress among individuals living with their partner.1 To explore these issues in cross-cultural context, we used data collected in seven EU countries and Turkey."

The COVID-19 global humanitarian emergency seems to be\ncharacteriyed by both. The sociopolitical dimension features prominently in the \u201cdisaster response\u201d phase, which ranged from lockdowns of different severity to various ordinances aimed at regulating daily life. Political and security components should also not be overlooked (Kavanagh & Singh, 2020); mostly in response to public health measures introduced to curb the pandemic, demonstrations and mass protests have been reported in a number of countries.\nWhen sexuality is discussed in the literature on complex emergencies and ensuing humanitarian crises, issues such as reproductive health risks, HIV, and sexual violence feature prominently (Khaw et\u00a0al., 2000; Wisner & Adams, 2002). Similarly, research on COVID-19 and sexuality-related phenomena focused primarily on reproductive health needs and domestic sexual violence. Studies investigating possible changes in sexual interest and sexual expression during the pandemic are still rare (D\u00f6ring, 2020), which should not be surprising given funding priorities associated with complex emergencies (Albala-Bertrand, 2000; Bedford et\u00a0al., 2020; Holmes et\u00a0al., 2020)."

This clearly resembles COVID-19 related burdens, such as having to stay at home, being concerned about health and fearing contagion, experiencing economic hardship and facing uncertain future, worrying about older parents, and being overwhelmed with children\u2019s education (Prime et\u00a0al., 2020). Considering the well-established negative link between stress and anxiety on the one hand and sexual interest on the other hand (Carvalheira et\u00a0al., 2014; Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2014), the current pandemic\u2019s potential to affect sexual interest in partnered individuals is an important issue to explore, both in the context of relationship quality and stability (Schoenfeld et\u00a0al., 2017; Sprecher & Cate, 2004), and individual well-being.\nOur cursory review of literature\u2014for a more systematic, but wider-reaching overview see D\u00f6ring (2020)\u2014identified a few empirical studies (carried out in Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, Canadian, and Turkish samples) that explored the pandemic-related changes in sexual desire. An Italian study included 89 partnered women (median age = 39\u00a0years) from a clinical sample and compared their FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index) scores before and after the beginning of the pandemic (Schiavi et\u00a0al., 2020). Composite scores on FSFI domains of desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction were all substantially lower at the second assessment. Another comparable and similarly low powered Turkish online survey (n = 58 women, Mage = 28\u00a0years) found a reduction in the FSFI scores\u2014except for the desire domain (Yuksel & 1 The affect of pandemic-related lockdowns and other restrictions on the sexual life of single women and men (as well as partnered inviduals who do not live together with their partner) has been recently discussed elsewhere (Lopes et\u00a0al., 2020).\n1 3\nOzgor, 2020). Two Chinese studies also used online samples of partnered and single individuals (G. Li et\u00a0al., 2020, W. Li et\u00a0al., 2020). In both studies, a great majority of participants (> 70%) were living with their parents. In the larger of the two (n = 967, age range = 15\u201335; 56% of men), 22% of participants retrospectively reported, among other changes in their sexual life, a decrease in sexual desire. Finally, in the first of two more recent studies, sexual desire domain scores were urrelated to the pandemic-related physical confinement but were significantly (and positively) associated with psychological adjustment in a non-probability-based sample of Portuguese women and men (Carvalho et\u00a0al., 2021). In a longitudinal study carried out from April to August 2020 using a large-scale sample of partnered and single Canadians, Brotto et\u00a0al. (2021) reported, somewhat unexpectedly, a link between COVID-19-related distress levels and increased dyadic sexual desire\u2014domonstrating that stressful reactions to the pandemic need not always stifle interest in partnered sex.\nTo summarize, there is insufficient evidence for any conclusion regarding the association between the pandemic and sexual interest in partnered individuals. Both decrease and increasea in sexual interest have been observed in a handful of study characterized by diverse methodological approaches."

            "text": "Building on the distinction between appetitive and aversive basic response systems (see Gable, 2006), the ApproachAvoidance Motivation Model (AAMM) posits that approach and avoidance represent two relatively independent sets of motives; the former characterized by stronger reactions, even bias, to positive cues (incentives, rewards) and the latter marked by stronger reactions to negative cues (threats, costs). Apart from being theorized as the evolutionary core of the affective system (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1999), approach and avoidance are seen as distinct dispositional preferences (Elliot et\u00a0al., 2006) and self-regulatory models (Gable & Impett, 2012) that are sensitive to circumstances and personal experience (Elliot et\u00a0al., 2006; Gable, 2006). This situational aspect is important\u2014particularly in the context of the current pandemic\u2014because it can qualify avoidant, but also approach, motives as (dys) functional.\nIn a number of studies, the AAMM has been linked to achievement, health outcomes, relationship quality, and wellbeing (Elliot et\u00a0al., 2006; Gable, 2006; Gable & Impett, 2012; Gable & Poore, 2008). For example, approach-motivated sacrifices in the context of a committed relationship (aimed at partner\u2019s benefit or happiness) were associated with personal well-being and relationship quality over time, while avoidance-motivated sacrifices (made to avoid conflicts and strained relations) had opposite effects (Impett et\u00a0al., 2005a).\nThe model has also been successfully applied to the study of sexuality (Gewirtz-Meydan & Ayalon, 2019; Impett et\u00a0al., 2005b, 2008), particularly in the exploration of motivation for sex (Muise et\u00a0al., 2013, 2017). For example, in a sample of North American college students, approach motivation for sex, compared to avoidance motives, was associated with a positive change in both personal and couple well-being (Impett et\u00a0al., 2005b). This was not only the result of the type of participants\u2019 motivation, but also of their perception of their partner\u2019s motives. Speculating about potential underlying mechanisms, Impett et\u00a0al. noted that approach motivated individuals are likely to have more positive expectations of sex, to be more focused on pleasurable sensations, more aroused, and to enjoy sex more compared to avoidance motivated individuals who may have difficulties in relaxing and focusing on pleasure\u2014in addition to being more sensitive to and critical about negative moments during sex (see also Gable & Impett, 2012).\nFollowing Gewirtz-Meydan and Ayalon (2019), we added the personal/interpersonal dimension to the AAMM to enable a further distinction between ego-oriented and relationshiporiented motivation for sex. In the case of ego-oriented motivation, sex is about personal pleasure and sexual selfaffirmation on the approach side, but mostly about avoiding or reducing partner\u2019s dissatisfaction on the avoidance side. An example of relationship-oriented motivation would be engaging in sex to increase emotional intimacy and closeness or, in the case of avoidant motivation, engaging in sex to save the relationship. The distinction between ego- and relationship-oriented motives may be somewhat more relevant for partnered women, as suggested in several studies (Gewirtz-Meydan & Ayalon, 2019; Sanchez et\u00a0al., 2011).\nThe current study applied this extended AAMM model to the context of a global emergency, exploring the role of different motives for sex in (retrospectively reported) change in sexual interest during the first pandemic phase. If approach motivation for sex is beneficial to partnered individuals under normal circumstances, it may also be relevant in times of crisis. Can approach motivation, compared to avoidance, protect against a situational decline in sexual interest? Is the personal/interpersonal dimension of the AAMM of any relevance in this context?\nSexual Interest Discrepancy and\u00a0Related Distress\nSexual interest is commonly understood to denote a subjective psychological state focused on engaging in sexual activity, which is triggered by internal and/or external stimuli (Nimbi et\u00a0al., 2020). Sexual interest has been shown to change with age (Tr\u00e6en et\u00a0al., 2017), and that its maintenance can be challenging in long-term relationships (Mark & Lasslo, 2018). Nevertheless, sexual interest for the partner remains an important component of relationship satisfaction\n1 3\nover time (Brezsnyak & Whisman, 2004), which explains a potential for distress about differences in partners\u2019 levels of interest in sex.\nStrong approach motivation has been observed to be positively associated with sexual interest (desire). In three repeated measurement studies, individuals who scored high on approach motives also reported higher levels of sexual desire and a lesser decline in desire on days marked by negative relationship dynamics than other participants (Impett et\u00a0al., 2008). Although it is currently unknown whether stable sexual interest in committed relationships is consistently associated with approach/avoidance motivation for sex, this question may be of particular importance in the context of discrepant sexual interest.\nDespite the fact that clinicians see discrepancy in partners\u2019 sexual interest as common, fluid, and not necessarily disruptive (using a novel methodological approach, a recent dyadic study found that desire discrepancy was a poor predictor of relationship and sexual satisfaction; Kim et\u00a0al., 2020), distress about a mismatch in sexual interest seems all but rare among partnered individuals (Dewitte et\u00a0al., 2020; Herbenick et\u00a0al., 2014). Distressing discrepancy can result in relationship discord and have a detrimental effect on relationship/marital stability (Schoenfeld et\u00a0al., 2017). More abrupt changes in partners\u2019 levels of sexual desire are more likely to be distressing. Such distress, which may reduce the capacity for cooperation and considerateness, can be particularly troubling in times of crisis\u2014such as the current pandemic\u2014when partners\u2019 mutual care and emotional support are needed most.\nUnlike gender differences in sexual interest, which have been extensively researched, both in evolutionary psychology (Buss, 1994) and sexology (see, for example, Mark et\u00a0al., 2014), it is unclear if distress about sexual interest discrepancy may be gender-specific. Both genders report such distress (Pereira et\u00a0al., 2019; Rosen et\u00a0al., 2018), but the (gendered) direction of the mismatch has been shown to matter, at least in couples who recently became parents (Rosen et\u00a0al., 2018)."

Considering the importance of sexuality for relationship satisfaction and stability, as well as for\nindividual quality of life, an investigation into factors related to changes in sexual interest under complex emergency conditions has clinical and non-clinical ramifications. Our study diverged from the available literature by using used a well-powered multi-country sample of individuals who were cohabiting with their partner at the time of the survey and by addressing a role of approach vs. avoidance motives in retrospectively assessed changes of sexual interest and related distress. The following research questions were explored in the current study:\nRQ1 Has sexual interest for their partner changed among cohabiting individuals during the current pandemic, and is the pattern gender-specific? RQ2 To what extent are these, retrospectively assessed, changes reflected in distress about perceived discrepant sexual interest? RQ3 What are the sociodemographic predictors, and relational and situational correlates of COVID-19 related changes in sexual interest? RQ4 What are the predictors and correlates of distress about discrepant sexual interest during the pandemic?\nBased on the reviewed evidence about the relationship between the AAMM and sexual interest, we also tested the following hypothesis and a related research question:\nH1 Based on some pre-pandemic evidence collected in student samples (Impett et\u00a0al., 2005b, 2008), we expect that approach motivation for sex, compared to avoidance motives, would be associated with better maintenance of sexual interest and less distress about discrepant sexual interest during the pandemic."

Using national news websites and online social networks, a convenience sample of individuals aged 18\u201380 was surveyed in each country. The\n2 In this study, we use the phrase sexual interest in place of the term sexual desire to express a more neutral (or deliberately ignorant) stance to biological underpinnings of human sexual motivation.\n3 The questionnaire was intentionally very brief (based mostly on single-item indicators with high face validity) to avoid increasing pandemic-generated frustration and stress, as well as to minimize the number of participants leaving the survey before completing it (common in lengthy online questionnaires).\n1 3\ntarget sample size of \u2265 500 participants was reached only in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Turkey (see Table\u00a02). Only individuals aged \u2265 18\u00a0years who were living with their partner/spouse at the time of the survey were eligible for the study. Data collection took place from May to July 2020 (Croatia: May 2\u201323; the Czech Republic: May 6\u2013July 7; the Netherlands: May 9\u201330; Germany: May 13\u2013June 20; Portugal: May 14\u2013July 18; France: June 8\u2013July 13; Sweden: June 12\u2013July 13, Turkey: June 11\u201320).\nThe analytical sample included 4813 women and men who were living with a partner/spouse at the time of the survey (Mage = 38.5\u00a0years, SD = 10.74; 73% of female participants). Of 6231 individuals who participated, 409 were excluded because they were either single or not living with their partner/spouse. Of those remaining, 1009 (17.3%) answered less than half of all the questions (such response was the least prevalent in Germany and the Czech Republic, and the most prevalent in Turkey [23.4%]). To address possible biases introduced by excluding these participants from the study, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out with the following binary outcome: 0 = completed less than 50% of the survey items and 1 = completed \u2265 50% of the survey items. Independent variables were country dummies (reference = the Netherlands), gender, age, years of (completed) formal education, and sexual orientation (living with a partner of the same or opposite sex). Being older (AOR = 1.02, p < .001) and more educated (AOR = 1.07, p < .001) increased the odds, while reporting a heterosexual partnership/marriage (AOR = 0.58, p = .006) decreased the odds of completing \u2265 50% of the survey items. Compared to Dutch participants, German (AOR = 0.60, p = .001) and Czech participants (AOR = 0.72, p = .033) were characterized by lower odds, and Croatian (AOR = 1.34, p = .029) and Turkish participants (AOR = 1.70, p < .001) by higher odds of responding to at least a half of questions.\nAlthough their small number precluded meaningful statistical comparisons, 15 non-binary individuals (Mage = 38.1, SD = 15.40) also participated in the survey (one in Croatia, two in the Czech Republic, five in Germany, two in Sweden, four in the Netherlands, and one in Turkey). All of them reported living with a partner; four with a man, eight with a woman, one with a non-binary partner, and two were in a polyamorous relationship. Four non-binary participants reported living with one or more children. On average, nonbinary individuals completed 16.2\u00a0years (SD = 5.12) of formal schooling, which is slightly higher compared to female (M = 15.8, SD = 3.88) and male participants (M = 15.3, SD = 3.73).\nBefore accessing the online questionnaire, participants were asked to read general information about the study and prospective participation and register their electronic informed consent. Median time to complete the study was under nine minutes."

Possible differences in sexual interest levels were addressed by asking participants if their \u201ccurrent interest in sex, compared to your partner\u2019s, is \u201cmuch lower\u201d (1) to \u201cmuch higher\u201d (7). Only individuals who reported a difference between their and their partner\u2019s levels of sexual interest at the time of the survey were asked about the related distress. Concurrent validity of the distress indicator was tested by carrying out a multivariable OLS regression with distress as dependent variable and change in sexual satisfaction (\u201cOverall, would you say that your sexual satisfaction in your relationship/marriage is currently lower, higher or about the same compared to six months ago, that is before the pandemic?\u201d) as an independent variable. With country, age, and gender controlled for, retrospectively assessed change in sexual satisfaction was significantly associated with the outcome (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.29, p < .001). Increase in sexual satisfaction was expectedly related to lower distress during the pandemic.\nRelationship satisfaction and emotional closeness before the pandemic was assessed by a latent combination of two constructs. The first was the 4-item Couples Satisfaction Index (Funk & Rogge, 2007) that measures how much one feels happy and satisfied about their relationship and describes it as warm and rewarding using a 7-point scale to anchor answers (higher scores reflect higher relationship satisfaction). The scale had high internal consistency in the current study (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.94). The second construct\n1 3\nwas perceived emotional closeness with a partner, which was a single-item measure showing seven Venn-like diagrams depicting a pair of circles with an increasing overlap representing partner\u2019s inclusion in the participant\u2019s self (Aron et\u00a0al., 1992). The diagrams were preceded by the following question: \u201cHow close to or emotionally intimate with your partner/spouse did you feel before this pandemic?\u201d The two constructs (five items in total) were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis with an oblique rotation. A single factor was extracted, with loadings in the 0.68\u20130.93 range. Higher factor scores indicate higher relationship satisfaction and emotional closeness.\nPandemic-related characteristics. Coping with the COVID-19 situation was measured by the following question: \u201cHow well do you cope with the current situation, that is with all life changes caused by this pandemic?\u201d. Answers were recorded on 7-point scale ranging from 1 = \u201cnot well at all\u201d to 7 = \u201cperfectly well.\u201d Partner's coping with the situation was assessed in a similar fashion: \u201cIn your opinion, how well does your partner cope with the current situation?\u201d. The same 7-point scale was used to anchor answers. Emotional well-being during the pandemic was indicated by answers to the following question: \u201cIn general, how are you doing, emotionally, these days?\u201d (1 = \u201ccompletely negative\u201d, 7 = \u201ccompletely positive\u201d). We also asked about mood changes (\u201cDo you experience mood changes these days?\u201d). Answers were anchored on a 7-point scale (1 = never, 7 = very often). Worries about health were also measured by a single-item indicator (\u201cHow worried are you for your and your partner\u2019s health at the moment?\u201d, with answers recorded on a 7-point scale (1 = \u201cnot at all\u201d, 7 = \u201cextremely worried\u201d). Finally, we asked about participants\u2019 perception of future (\u201cHow worried you are that this pandemic will negatively affect your future life in general?\u201d). Again a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 = \u201cnot at all\u201d to 7 = \u201ca great deal\u201d, was used to record responses.\nTo create a latent composite, all six items were factor analyzed with an oblique rotation. After omitting the mood swings item, which cross-loaded highly on both factors, a two-factor solution was obtained, that explained 72% of item variance. The two factors\u2014coping with the pandemic (k = 3) and worries about the pandemic (k = 2) were moderately correlated (r = \u2212 .37). Internal consistency of both scales, which were entered in multivariable regression analyses as factor scores, were acceptable (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1coping = 0.80 and \u03b1worries = 0.60). Higher scale scores indicate better coping with and more worries about the pandemic, respectively.\nMotivation for sex. Following the conceptual approach by Gewirtz and Ayalon (2019), in which approach/avoidance motives were combined with personal/interpersonal goals to produce a 2 \u00d7 2 table of categories, the following four items were used to address types of personal motivation for sex: (A) \u201cI want sex because it makes me feel good\u201d (approach-personal motivation); (B) \"I want sex because of what it does for\nmy relationship\u201d (approach-interpersonal motivation); (C) \u201cI avoid sex because it does not make me feel good\u201d (avoidancepersonal motivation); and (D) \u201cI avoid sex because of what is going on in my relationship\u201d (avoidance-interpersonal motivation). Participants were asked to select one of these \u201cfour possible motivations for sex in a committed relationship or marriage\u201d\u2014the one that \u201cbest represents how you felt before the pandemic\u201d. The categorical indicator\u2019s concurrent validity was supported by the finding that avoidance motivated participants (the personal/interpersonal goals distinction was disregarded in this analysis) were slightly more likely to report a significant reduction in sexual satisfaction during the pandemic than those characterized by approach motives (t(503) = 2.29, p < .023; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.12).\nDue to a small proportion of participants who reported personal and interpersonal avoidance motives (4.6% and 5.4%, respectively), the two categories were collapsed into one. In multivariable assessments, motives for sex were treated as two dummy variables, with personal approach motivation selected as reference category."

Due to their small number (n = 12), participants who gender identified as other, were excluded from further analyses. About a half of the sample reported living with one or more children (55.2%). Mean number of years of completed formal schooling was 15 (some college education), ranging from 13.5 in German to 16.9\u00a0years among Portuguese participants. Only 3.1% of surveyed individuals reported living with a partner/spouse of the same sex (1.4% in Turkey and 4.5% in the Netherlands). On average, participants in the current study had been living together with their partner for more than a decade (10.6\u00a0years).\nSlightly over a half of participants reported no change in their retrospectively assessed sexual interest during the COVID-19 pandemic (52.8%). Of the rest, 18.8% reported a decrease, while 28.5% reported an increase in their\nsexual interest. We observed a slight but statistically significant gender difference in mean changes: t(4794) = 3.04, p = .002; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.10), with a cross-tabulation analysis indicating that, compared to men, women more often reported a decrease and less often stability in sexual interest for their partner. No gender difference was observed among participants who reported an increased interest. When the pattern of change was compared across the eight countries, a single significant difference emerged, with Dutch participants reporting a slightly different pattern (characterized by a higher frequency of increased sexual interest) than the rest (F(7, 4807) = 7.00, p < .001). Table\u00a02 presents detailed information about mean changes in sexual interest by country and gender.\nThe pandemic-related changes in sexual interest were weakly associated with distress about perceived discrepancy (rS = \u2212 0.21, p < .001), with the link somewhat stronger among female (rS = \u2212 0.25, p < 0.001), compared to male participants (rS = \u2212 0.14, p < .001). The relationship was significant among heterosexual (rS = \u2212 0.22, p < .001) but not non-heterosexual participants (rho = \u2212 0.06, p = .597). Considering that changes in sexual interest were not necessarily accompanied with distress, we next explored levels of distress about perceived discrepant sexual interest. One fifth of individuals who reported any change in their sexual interest during the pandemic reported no distress (20.9%), 29.1% reported low distress levels (values 2\u20133),"

            "text": "The current study aimed to contribute to insights about the dynamics of sexual interest in the current complex emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Before delving into contextualizing and discussing the current study findings in more detail, we start with summary answers to the four research questions:\nHas sexual interest changed during the current pandemic and is the pattern gender-specific? Slightly over a half of the surveyed participants reported no perceived change in sexual interest for their partner during the pandemic; of the rest, there were more individuals who reported increased than decreased interest. This pattern of stability/change was gender-specific, with more female participants reporting a decrease and less reporting no change in their sexual interest compared to their male counterparts.\n1 3\nTo what extent are changes in partnered individuals\u2019 sexual interest reflected in distress about discrepant sexual interest? Retrospectively reported changes were only weakly associated with distress about perceived sexual interest discrepancy (the correlation was higher in female than male participants). A majority of surveyed individuals reported no or low distress, but 19% of participants were highly distressed (the categorization, it should be noted, was not based on clinically validated cutoff scores).\nWhich personal and situational characteristics are related to changes in sexual interest? Which characteristics are related to distress about discrepant sexual interest? Changes in sexual interest during the COVID-19 pandemic were consistently associated with two factors: relationship satisfaction and emotional closesness, and coping with the complex emergency situation. Similarly, levels of distress about discrepant sexual interest were best predicted by relationship\nsatisfaction and partner\u2019s emotional closeness, and participants\u2019 worries about the pandemic.\nFinally, we expected that approach motivation for sex, compared to avoidance motives, would be associated with better maintenance of sexual interest and less distress about discrepant sexual interest. Interestingly, we observed no differences in retrospectively assessed reduction in sexual interest across the four sexual motivation types. In contrast, compared to other types, ego-oriented motives were substantially associated with increase in sexual interest during the pandemic. Pointing to the importance of distinguishing between personal and interpersonal sexual motivation, relationship-oriented approach motivation was significantly related to distress about perceived discrepancy in sexual interest. The observation that individuals who reported that interpersonal benefits were their primary motives for sex before the pandemic were more distressed by the discrepancy than ego-oriented participants should not be surprising. The former motivation is markedly more vulnerable to complex emergencies than the latter motives for one simple reason\u2014with pandemic-related pressures increasing, the burden placed on sex to take care of the relationship intensifies. In the process, distress about a mismatch in sexual interest becomes more likely, as the discrepancy is perceived not only as an obstacle to sexual pleasure, but also as an obstacle to attending to partners\u2019 emotional bond.\nOur finding that almost a half of surveyed women and men reported no change in their sexual interest\u2014which was the pattern observed across the eight countries\u2014is at odds with most other studies, which noted a substantial decrease in sexual activity, sexual desire, and/or quality of their sex life (Jacob et\u00a0al., 2020; Lehmiller et\u00a0al., 2021; W. Li et\u00a0al., 2020; Schiavi et\u00a0al., 2020). Only a small Turkish study (Yuksel & Ozgor, 2020) reported findings comparable to ours. Recognizing that differences may be related to the fact that some of these studies collected data during earlier phases of the pandemic\u2014possibly fraught with more intense health-related concerns and fears\u2014the differences most likely reflect the fact that the earlier studies mostly surveyed single individuals and, in the case of the two Chinese studies, people living with their parents (G. Li et\u00a0al., 2020, W. Li et\u00a0al., 2020). Comparisons among the studies is further hampered by differences in participants age and their relationship status, the use of different measures, as well as by country-specific dynamics of the pandemic and the public health response regimes.\nThere were two notable gender differences in our study. The first was the gender-specific pattern of change in sexual interest, with partnered male participants reporting more stability and less decrease in sexual interest than female participants. The finding, which is compatible with the findings from a longitudinal study of sexual desire in a Canadian sample (Brotto et\u00a0al., 2021), may reflect women\u2019s higher parenting and household investments is some countries, particularly\n*p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001 a Before the pandemic; A = Ego-focused approach motivation; B = Relationship-focused approach motivation; C/D = Avoidance motivation b During the pandemic\nRelationship satisfaction and emotional\ncloseness \u2212 .51 (.05) \u2212 .26*** Motivation for sexa (reference = A)"

The second gender-related difference was higher distress about discrepant sexual interest observed among male participants. This may be related to the finding that more women than men reported a decrease in sexual interest during the pandemic. Thus, higher distress might reflect a combination of negative feelings and uneasiness about what could have been perceived as partner\u2019s sexual withdrawal in times of crisis. Finally, we observed some gender differences in types of motivation for sex, which were shown to be associated with sexual well-being during the pandemic. In all eight countries, women were more likely to report avoidant sexual motivation than men. However, the proportion of avoidant motivated female participants varied across country, suggesting a role of socio-cultural factors. Considering that ego-focused approach motives for sex were associated with increase in sexual interest for one\u2019s partner and were associated with lower levels of sexual distress when compared to other motivation types, it should also be noted that more men than women were characterized by ego-focused approach motivation before the pandemic. The difference should not be hastily ascribed to gender-specific sexual socialization and gendered social norms intended to regulate sexuality, because we found no gender differences in relationship-focused approach motives for sex.\nRetrospectivelly reported changes (i.e., decrease or increase) in personal sexual interest for the cohabiting partner during the pandemic were associated with all four groups of indicators: sociodemographic, relational, situational, or pandemic-related, and personal motivation for sex. Among sociodemographic characteristics, male gender increased the odds of reporting increased sexual interest, while age and education worked in the opposite direction. The link with education is interesting and may suggest that, during lockdown, white collar professions continued working online, sometimes with even more pressure and blurred lines between working and non-working hours. Higher relationship satisfaction and emotional closeness scores increased the odds of increased sexual interest, while lower scores increased the odds of reporting a decline in sexual interest during the pandemic. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of relationship quality for sexual health and well-being (Hinchliff & Gott, 2004; Schoenfeld et\u00a0al., 2017; \u0160tulhofer et\u00a0al., 2013, 2020).\nSituational, COVID-19-related, factors were also important. Better coping with the situation was linked to increased and worse coping to decreased sexual interest. Surprisingly, worries about the pandemic significantly (and with similar effect size) increased the odds of reporting both increased and decreased sexual interest. It appears that fear and concerns caused by the pandemic suppress sexual interest in some\nbut boost it for other participants. In the latter case, sex may serve as a distractor or a sexualized coping strategy, which resonates with observations that a proportion of individuals characterized by negative mood report increased, rather than decreased sexual desire (Bancroft et\u00a0al., 2003; Janssen et\u00a0al., 2013; Lykins et\u00a0al., 2006).\nFinally, ego-focused approach motivation for sex was significantly related to increased sexual interest in one\u2019s partner, but also to lower stress about perceived discrepant sexual interest compared to relationship-focused approach motives. The findings are surprising only if one believes that the pandemic increased pressure to have sex primarily to support the partner and the relationship\u2014which does not seem to be the case. If, however, the life-course framework proves essential for the AAMM, demonstrating that relationship-focused approach motives become more prominent and beneficial for sustaining a couple\u2019s sexual interest with aging (GewirtzMeydan & Ayalon, 2019; Hinchliff & Gott, 2004), our findings might be limited by the average age of participants in our sample.\nAmong other predictors and correlates of distress about partners\u2019 discrepant sexual interest during the pandemic, female gender, younger age, lack of privacy, and more worries about the COVID-19 situation were associated with higher distress levels. Higher frequency of sexual activity, higher levels of relationship satisfaction and emotional closeness, and self-reported better coping with the pandemic were related to lower distress levels. Comparable to the analysis of changes in sexual interest, the relational dimension (indicated by the relationship satisfaction and emotional closeness latent construct) and participant\u2019s reaction to the crisis most contributed to the explained variance in sexual discrepancyrelated distress. The fact that our model accounted for less than a fifth of variance in the outcome points to the existence of other, unmeasured, factors, possibly professional stress, wider emotional support networks, etc.\nAlthough cultural differences were not the main focus of this multi-country study, it should be noted that the reported pattern of retrospectively assessed change in sexual interest exhibited no difference across seven of the eight countries included\u2014despite notable differences in the severity of the pandemic and governmental responses to it at the time of our survey (Brauner et\u00a0al., 2021). We also observed some between-country differences, most notable in levels of distress about discrepant sexual interest and gender-specific motivation for sex. How much these differences reflect more durable socio-cultural differences, relative to the impact of COVID 19, remains unclear, but comparative social science research points to a substantial diversity of attitudes toward gender equality and sexual permissiveness in Europe (see, for example, Luijkx et\u00a0al., 2016).\nWe were unable to explore possible links between retrospectively assessed changes in sexual interest and levels\n1 3\nof distress as psychological reactions to the pandemic on the one hand and country-specific COVID-19 societal costs and psychosocial burdens on the other hand. The reasons are methodological (non-probability sampling, different timing of online recruitment in the eight countries, and a small number of countries included), bio-political (i.e., different dynamics of the pandemic and differences in country response), and socio-epidemiological (differences in national testing strategy, laboratory capacity, surveillance approach, public reporting of new cases, and the definition of COVID-19 related death). All this prompted the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to state that notification rates should not be used to \u201cdirectly compare countries\u201d (ECDC, 2020). Another possible approach to cross-country comparisons would be to focus on stringency levels of country-specific pandemic measures, which has recently been enabled by the Oxford University COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT; Hale et\u00a0al., 2021). According to the OxCGRT, the stringency levels on June 1 varied considerably in the eight countries included in the current study, ranging from 41.7 in the Czech Republic to 71.3 in Portugal.4 Although it would be tempting to explore possible links between government restrictions and sexualityrelated outcomes at individual level, such analysis would be unwarranted given the small number of countries in the current study. Furthermore, national responses to the pandemic were sometimes region-specific and changing in stringency during the time of our data collection."

So, the question arises as to the consequences of our results for possible counselling or clinical interventions. For couples who might be together 24\u00a0h a day due to a lockdown, possibly with children, and without sufficient privacy at home, the quality of relationship becomes essential. Considering that even satisfying relationships can be vulnerable to a combination of economic, psychological, and medical burdens of a complex emergency situation, it is important to think about possibilities of professional support and interventions. These could follow the recent recommendations of the European Society for Sexual Medicine (Dewitte et\u00a0al., 2020) to assist couples who are distressed by sexual desire discrepancy by depathologizing variations\nin sexual desire\u2014without neglecting the possibility that some couples will need a more complex intervention (i.e., sex therapy). In relation to the COVID-19 situation, promoting dyadic sexual communication about personal concerns, coping strategies, as well as sexual needs and motives, is of central importance. In the situation of restricted social contacts and limited access to health services, the use of e-health information, counselling, and/or sex therapy platforms could be an option (Kirana et\u00a0al., 2020)."

This resulted in a high completion rate, despite many COVID-19 related surveys circulating online at the same time. Probably the main limitation of our study, non-probability (i.e., convenience) sampling, precluded any generalizations, as well as any emphasis on direct comparisons between the eight countries. However, this shortcoming is of limited importance here because our main aim was not descriptive or prevalence-focused, but analytical. Compared to the former, the latter aim mostly requires a sample that is large enough (power issues) and heterogeneous (sufficient variability in characteristics of interest). Although women and highly educated individuals are markedly overrepresented in our sample5\u2014which is often the case with sexuality-related, particularly internet-based, studies (see, for example, Ross et\u00a0al., 2005)\u2014we believe that the sociodemographic characteristics presented in Table\u00a01 point to an acceptable diversity of partnered individuals. Another notable limitation is the fact that changes in sexual interest were assessed retrospectively. Compared to prospective (i.e., longitudinal) assessments, retrospective explorations are less valid and robust, mostly due to recall bias and the inability to address nestedness of the data in time.\nA different type of limitation is our approach to measuring approach/avoidance motivation for sex. Although the operationalization was firmly anchored in the literature (Elliot et\u00a0al., 2006; Gable & Impett, 2012; Gable & Poore, 2008; Gewirtz-Meydan & Ayalon, 2019), which suggests that the two motivations are relatively independent (and not the end points on a continuum), our use of single-item measures\u2014justified by the intentional brevity of our questionnaire\u2014to assess complex constructs is certainly not an ideal choice. In the future, the four motivation types should be treated as latent constructs (i.e., indicated by multiple items),\n4 On June 1, the OxCGRT stringency levels were 63.9 in Turkey, 50.9 in Croatia, 71.7 in the Czech Republic, 75.0 in France, 59.7 in Germany, 63.0 in the Netherlands, 71.3 in Portugal, and 64.8 in Sweden (see https:// covid track er. bsg. ox. ac. uk/ strin gency- scatt er).\n5 Similar overrepresentation of female participants (71% of the total sample) was reported in another recent large-scale online survey that focused on sexuality in times of the COVID-19 pandemic (Lehmiller et\u00a0al., 2021). The study, in which a large majority of participants were from North America, was carried out a couple of months before ours.\n1 3\nas such strategy should bring more precision and allow for testing some of the conceptual assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, no validated measure of the four motivation of sex types is currently available. This remains a task for future studies."

            "text": "Several findings from this cross-cultural study that sampled partnered individuals from the North, South, East, and West of Europe should be emphasized and checked against results from comparable studies (see D\u00f6ring, 2020). The first is the observation that the majority of individuals who lived with a partner or spouse at the time of the survey did not seem to have reacted to the pandemic with reduced sexual interest for their partner. In fact, almost a third retrospectively reported an increase in sexual interest, which may have been beneficial to their personal and relationship well-being, as well as for coping with the crisis generated by the pandemic. Second, changes in sexual interest were weakly associated with perceived distress about discrepant sexual interest, and only a minority of participants appeared highly distressed. Third, relationship satisfaction and emotional closeness were confirmed to be highly important couple resources in times of crisis. The novel insight in this respect is the current study finding that the effect (not meant here to denote causality) does not require that a couple\u2019s sex is primarily motivated by its benefits for the relationship. Under complex emergency circumstances, partnered women\u2019s and men\u2019s approach motives for sex seem to contribute to sexual well-being the most when they are ego-oriented (i.e., focused on personal pleasure and enjoyment). By shedding some light on factors that decrease/increase the risk of couple distress about discrepant sexual interest during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current study findings may facilitate clinical work with partnered individuals and couples whose sex life is affected by the pandemic\u2014particularly in terms of supporting adaptive coping and paying attention to possible gender-specific sexual reactions.\nFinally, two important caveats are required. The current study findings are clearly limited to European experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic in the period from May to July 2020. Considering that the complex emergency situation continues without an end in sight, the experiences, behaviors, and perceptions explored in this study are prone to change.\nFunding The study was carried out under the auspices of the COST 2019\u20132023 Action European Sexual Medicine Network (CA18124; https:// www. esmn- cost. eu/), but no direct funding was obtained for the study."
