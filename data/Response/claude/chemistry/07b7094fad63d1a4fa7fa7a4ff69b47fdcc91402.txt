 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of other catalyst supports besides SiO2 on the oxalic acid degradation reaction. The support material can impact the catalytic activity, so testing other options like Al2O3, TiO2, carbon nanotubes etc. could lead to further improvements.

2. Explore the use of bimetallic Pt catalysts like Pt-Pd and Pt-Ru instead of monometallic Pt. The second metal may provide additional benefits like increased stability or selectivity.

3. Study the degradation of other organic acids besides oxalic acid using this catalytic system. The paper focuses only on oxalic acid, but expanding to other acids like formic, acetic etc. would widen the applicability. 

4. Optimize the catalyst synthesis and pretreatment methods to maximize activity and durability. Varying factors like Pt loading, calcination temperature, acid treatment strength/time could further enhance the catalyst performance.

5. Investigate the scale up of the process from laboratory to pilot or industrial scale. This would involve reactor and process engineering studies to translate the bench-scale results to larger throughputs. Catalyst loading, mass transfer, mixing etc. would need consideration.
