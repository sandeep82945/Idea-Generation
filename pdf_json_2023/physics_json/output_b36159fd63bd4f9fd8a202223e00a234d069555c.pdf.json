    "abstractText": "Background and Objectives: Lorlatinib (LOR) belongs to the third-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors. People who are diagnosed with ALK-positive metastatic and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are eligible to get it as a first-line treatment option after it was given the approval by \u201cthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u201d. However, no study has described constructing high-throughput analytical methodology for LOR quantitation in dosage form. For the first time, this work details the construction of a high-throughput, innovative microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) for single-step assessment of LOR in its tablet form, for use in pharmaceutical quality control. Materials and Methods: Assay depended on charge transfer complex (CTC) formation between LOR, as electron donor, with 2,3-dichloro-3,5dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), as \u03c0-electron acceptor. Reaction conditions were adjusted, the CTC was characterized by ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometry and computational molecular modeling, and its electronic constants were determined. Site of interaction on LOR molecule was allocated and reaction mechanism was suggested. Under refined optimum reaction conditions, the procedures of MW-SPA were performed in 96-well assay plates, and the responses were recorded by an absorbance plate reader. Validation of the current methodology was performed in accordance with guidelines of \u201cthe International Council on Harmonization (ICH)\u201d, and all validation parameters were acceptable. Results: Limits of detection and quantitation of MW-SPA were 1.8 and 5.5 \u03bcg/well, respectively. The assay was applied with great success for determining LOR in its tablets. Conclusions: This The assay is straightforward, economic and has high-throughput characteristics. Consequently, the assay is recommended as a valuable analytical approach in quality control laboratories for LOR\u2019s",

In the year 2020, it was anticipated that 18.1 million people would be diagnosed with cancer worldwide. When considering all forms of cancer, lung cancer is the one that occurs in the second most people around the world. It is most frequent kind of cancer to affect men and second most common form of cancer to affect women. In the year 2020, there were more than 2.2 million newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer which makes it the largest cause of cancer-related mortality [1] and is responsible for the most deaths. It is important to note that lung cancer is subdivided into small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is responsible for roughly 80\u201385 percent of the total cases of lung cancer. Main treatment options for NSCLC include\nMedicina 2023, 59, 756. https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina59040756 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/medicina\nMedicina 2023, 59, 756 2 of 14\nsurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. For localized stage I and stage II of NSCLC, surgery and radiotherapy are usually useful; however, they are not authorized for advanced stages of NSCLC [2,3]. For ~80% of all patients with NSCLC, chemotherapy is usually recommended as a superior first-line treatment regime because It has been shown to increase both longevity and quality of life [4\u20136]. First-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefinitinib, erlotinib, and other have been widely prescribed [7,8]; however, a large proportion of patients have a chromosomal rearrangement that results in a fusion gene for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4). The created gene causes constitutive activity of the kinase protein, and ultimately leads to increased cell carcinogenesis and induces malignant phenotype [9\u201311]. First generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are unable to hinder fusion protein kinase activity. Therefore, drug discovery researchers were directed to discover novel drugs for treating patients with NSCLC including those harbor EML4/ALK proteins. The efforts of the researchers ultimately lead to the emerging of most potent third generation ALK inhibitor drugs, which gave a special interest and clinical benefits in treatment of ALK-positive patients NSCLC who are not responding to the earlier generations of ALK inhibitors. Lorlatinib (LOR) is the first member of the third generation of ALK inhibitors [12,13]. Because of the clinical success of LOR, US-FDA on 3 March 2021, has been approved LOR for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ALK-positive, distinguished by an FDA-approved test [14]. LOR was also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treating patients with advanced and ALK-positive NSCLC [15]. LOR is sold in the markets under the trade name of Lorbena\u00ae tablets \u201cPfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA\u201d. Recommended dose of LOR is 100 mg orally once daily [16]. The therapeutic benefits of LOR, in terms of its potency and safety, is principally depending on pharmaceutical formulation quality (Lorbrena\u00ae tablets). Also, the therapeutic success of LOR is expected to be encouraging to the pharmaceutical companies for the development of new pharmaceutical preparations for LOR once the patent of Lorbrena\u00ae tablets for Pfizer expires. Therefore, LOR determination in its pharmaceutical tablets would be necessary. To achieve this goal, a proper analytical method with high throughput is vital. Literature review revealed that only one analytical technology exists for determination of LOR; this technology is liquid chromatography [17\u201322]. Most of the existing chromatographic methods [18\u201322] relied on the expensive and instrumental intensive tandem mass spectrometric detectors and devoted to the analysis of LOR in biological samples. Only one chromatographic method is published for determining LOR in its bulk and pharmaceutical formulation [17]. The standards approach for quality control of pharmaceuticals require simple and high-throughput procedures, rather than the chromatographic procedures which usually have limited throughput. Because it allows the analysis of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of samples every day in a given laboratory or on a specific instrument, high-throughput analysis is becoming increasingly significant in the pharmaceutical sector. This approach is important in the speedy identification of pharmaceutical entities, testing the uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations [23\u201325]. This manuscript designates, for the first time, development and validation of new microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) with high-throughput for determination of LOR in pharmaceutical quality control laboratories. MW-SPA, described herein, is based on formation of colored charge-transfer complex (CTC) between LOR (electron donor), 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) (\u03c0-electron acceptor). Procedures of MW-SPA are performed in 96-well assay plates and absorbances are recorded by absorbance plate reader."

            "text": "Spectrophotometric assays are widely used in pharmaceutical industries [28\u201330]. These assays gained their importance and wide applications because they can be readily automated with spectrophotometric analyzers, that enable the analysis of hundreds of samples for the quality control assessment of pharmaceutical formulations, such as testing uniformity of contents and dissolution testing of tablets. The CT reactions have been widely employed as a basis for developing many spectrophotometric assays for the purpose of quality control of pharmaceuticals [31\u201334]. These assays are simple and rapid. Obviously, the chemical structure of LOR contains multiple electron-donating sites (e.g., amino group nitrogen atoms and ether-oxygen atom), which may contribute to the formation of CTC with electron acceptors. As revealed from an intensive literature review, CT reaction of LOR was not published yet. Therefore, our study is considered the first methodology in this area. DDQ is a versatile reagent which has been successfully utilized in varied chemical reactions and applications [35,36]. DDQ is commercially available, user-friendly, shelf-stable, solvent-soluble, and frequently produces non-toxic byproducts during its reactions. Alzoman et al. [37] established that DDQ is one of the most reactive acceptors in a prior work incorporating CT reactions with numerous polyhalo-/polycyanoquinone electron acceptors, and as a result, it has been widely used in the creation of several CTbased spectrophotometric tests for pharmaceuticals [37\u201340]. Due of these factors, DDQ was chosen as the electron acceptor for the MW-SPA presented here. The conventional practice of the spectrophotometric assays, including CT reactions, usually employ volumetric flasks/cuvettes in the analysis, thus these assays have limited throughputs that do not meet the needs of quality control laboratories for the processing of pharmaceutical formulations [23\u201325]. In addition, the conventional CT-based assays consume large volumes of costly and more prominently it may cause analysts\u2019 toxicity [41\u201344]. As a result, developing new methodologies of higher throughput and utilizing small volumes of organic solvents was considered in constructing CT-based assays. Recently, our laboratory successfully employed absorbance microplate reader in adopting MW-SPA for quantitation of active constituents in their dosage forms [45]. These assays provided high throughput analysis and consumed low organic solvents volumes. For these reasons, the present study has undertaken the development of this methodology for LOR."

            "text": "An LOR solution UV-visible absorption spectra (4.92 \u00d7 10\u22124 M, in methanol) was measured (Figure 1) and it displayed existence of two absorption maxima (\u03bbmax) at 298 and 390 nm. When different concentrations of LOR solutions (0.77 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20139.23 \u00d7 10\u22124 M) were mixed with a fixed concentration of DDQ solution (5.51 \u00d7 10\u22123 M), the reaction between LOR and DDQ was permitted to occur at 25 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C, and reaction mixture absorption spectra were measured vs. a DDQ reagent blank solution (Figure 1). Red color product with absorbance maximum of 460 nm was obtained and its intensity grew as the LOR concentration in reaction solution increased. This characteristic was clearly observed throughout the process of producing a new product from a reaction. The shape and pattern of resulting absorption band was comparable to DDQ radical anion as detailed in literature [37\u201340]. Hence, reaction was assumed to be a CT reaction involving LOR (electron donor, D) and DDQ (\u03c0-electron acceptor, A), and reaction continued in methanol (as an example of polar solvent) to create a CT complex (D-A), which was then dissociated by methanol giving radical anion of DDQ (A\u2022\u2212), as shown in Figure 1A.\nMedicina 2023, 59, 756 5 of 14\nMedicina 2023, 59, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\npolar solvent) to create a CT complex (D-A), which was then dissociated by methanol giving radical anion of DDQ (A\u2022\u2212), as shown in Figure 1A.\nFigure 1.

[46]. Eg value was 2.7036 eV. This small value indicated easiness of electron transfer from LOR to DDQ.\n3.3. Reaction Conditions\u2019 Optimization For determine utmost suitable solvent for optimal reaction, reaction between LOR and DDQ was performed in many solvents possessing different dielectric constants [47] and polarity indexes [48]. Results indicated that slight shifts in \u03bbmax accompanied with changes in molar absorptivity (\u03b5) occurred. Reaction in solvents possessing both high dielectric constants and polarity (methanol and acetonitrile) gave better \u03b5 values than those in solvents with low dielectric constants and polarity (diethyl ether and dichloroethane) did. This effect was explained by the fact that the process of transferring electron from electron donor molecule (LOR) to electron acceptor (DDQ) is favored in polar solvents and diminished in non-polar solvents. In all subsequent steps, methanol was utilized as the proper solvent. At 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C the reaction in methanol was immediate. The effect of DDQ concentration was studied by performing reaction using varying concentrations of DDQ (0.1\u20131%, w/v). Results revealed that color intensity of CTC increases as the DDQ concentration increases and the maximum color intensity was achieved when the DDQ concentration ranged from 0.25 to 0.5% (w/v), beyond which the color intensity decreased (Figure 2).

Results indicated that slight shifts in \u03bbmax accompanied with changes in molar absorptivity (\u03b5) occurred. Reaction in solvents possessing both high dielectric constants and polarity (methanol and acetonitrile) gave better \u03b5 values than those in solvents with low dielectric constants and polarity (diethyl ether and dichloroethane) did. This effect was explained by the fact that the process of transferring electron from electron donor molecule (LOR) to electron acceptor (DDQ) is favored in polar solvents and diminished in non-polar solvents. In all subsequent steps, methanol was utilized as the proper solvent. At 25 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C the reaction in methanol was i mediate. The effect of DDQ concentration was studied by performing reaction using varying concentrations of D Q (0.1\u20131%, w/v). Results revealed that color intensity of CTC increases as the DDQ concentration increases and the maximum color intensity was achieved when the D Q concentration ra ged from 0.25 to 0.5% (w/v), beyond which the color intensity decreased (Figur 2).

For intra\u2013 and inter\u2013assay precision, RSD ranged from 0.15 to 1.76 and 1.12 to 1.86%, respectively. It was clear from small RSD values that the assay was highly precise. At the same levels of LOR concentrations as the precision experiments, assay\u2019s accuracy was assessed by recovery studies.

Specificity and Interference\nSpecificity of proposed MW-SPA for LOR quantitation in tablets without any potential interference from the inactive excipients which are co-formulated with LOR is documented because of two main reasons. The first one is the measurements of LOR in the visible region (460 nm) which is far away from the UV-absorbing excipients which might be extracted from the tablets during the preparation of tablets solution. The second reason is the use of methanol for preparation of tablet solution which dissolve only LOR leaving the excipients because they do not dissolve in methanol.\n3.7.4. Robustness and Ruggedness\nMW-SPA robustness (impact of minor variation in assay variables on performance) was assessed. Concentration of DDQ, reaction time, and temperature were all altered by a factor of 10% from their optimum values (Table 1). Minor procedure variables didn\u2019t disturb assay results revealing assay suitability for routine LOR analysis. Two analysts performed the experiment on three different days to test ruggedness. Since the maximum RSD \u2264 2%, the results derived from differences in analysis from one analyst to another and from day to day were determined to be reproducible."

Reaction mechanism was hypothesized. The reaction between LOR and DDQ served as the basis for the development of a unique MW-SPA for analyzing LOR in bulk and tablets. Assay offers a high throughput, permitting a large number of samples to be analyzed in a short amount of time. Additionally, when employed in quality control laboratories, the assay is eco-friendly because it employs a very small volume of organic solvent.\nAuthor Contributions: A.M.A.-H.: Investigation, Visualization, Data curation, Writing\u2014review & editing.
