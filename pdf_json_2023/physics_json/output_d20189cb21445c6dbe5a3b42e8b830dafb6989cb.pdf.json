    "abstractText": "Layered double hydroxides are promising candidates for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. Unfortunately, their catalytic kinetics and longterm stabilities are far from satisfactory compared to those of rare metals. Here, we investigate the durability of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides and show that ablation of the lamellar structure due tometal dissolution is the cause of the decreased stability. Inspired by the amino acid residues in photosystem II, we report a strategy using trimesic acid anchors to prepare the subsize nickel-iron layered double hydroxides with kinetics, activity and stability superior to those of commercial catalysts. Fundamental investigations through operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the superaerophobic surface facilitates prompt release of the generated O2 bubbles, and protects the structure of the catalyst. Coupling between the metals and coordinated carboxylates via C\u2012O\u2012Fe bonding prevents dissolution of the metal species, which stabilizes the electronic structure by static coordination. In addition, the uncoordinated carboxylates formed by dynamic evolution during oxygen evolution reaction serve as proton ferries to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. This work offers a promising way to achieve breakthroughs in oxygen evolution reaction stability and dynamic performance by introducing functional ligands with static and dynamic compatibilities.",

Unfortunately, their catalytic kinetics and longterm stabilities are far from satisfactory compared to those of rare metals. Here, we investigate the durability of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides and show that ablation of the lamellar structure due tometal dissolution is the cause of the decreased stability. Inspired by the amino acid residues in photosystem II, we report a strategy using trimesic acid anchors to prepare the subsize nickel-iron layered double hydroxides with kinetics, activity and stability superior to those of commercial catalysts. Fundamental investigations through operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the superaerophobic surface facilitates prompt release of the generated O2 bubbles, and protects the structure of the catalyst. Coupling between the metals and coordinated carboxylates via C\u2012O\u2012Fe bonding prevents dissolution of the metal species, which stabilizes the electronic structure by static coordination. In addition, the uncoordinated carboxylates formed by dynamic evolution during oxygen evolution reaction serve as proton ferries to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. This work offers a promising way to achieve breakthroughs in oxygen evolution reaction stability and dynamic performance by introducing functional ligands with static and dynamic compatibilities.\nThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial electrochemical process that serves as the foundation for multiple energy storage applications, including rechargeable metal-air batteries, nitrogen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and water electrolyzers1,2. Although state-of-the-art noble metal electrocatalysts, such as iridium (Ir)- and ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts, have been developed as commercial benchmarks for practical OER applications, their scarcities and exorbitant prices have sparked the search for cost-effective catalysts3,4. Electrodes based on Ni, Co, and Fe have shown great potential in OER but failed to meet strict industrial criteria for reactivity and stability, e.g., a lifespan of >1000 h at a current density of >1000mA cm\u22122. More efficient electrocatalysts are urgently needed to meet commercial requirements.\nReceived: 9 February 2023\nAccepted: 4 October 2023\nCheck for updates\n1School of Materials Science and Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao 266580, P.

For example, nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) exhibited superior performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their unique 2D lamellar structure and controllable electronic properties6,7. However, the minimum overpotential of the NiFe-LDH catalyst was limited by the scaling relationships among the binding energies of *O, *OH and *OOH (* indicates the adsorbed state) according to the adsorbate evolution mechanism8. Conventional approaches such as morphology regulation, vacancy steering and dopant modification were successful in improving the activity. However, the difficulty in breaking the bottleneck of dynamics remains the critical factor limiting the activity at high current densities. Evenworse, the energetically favored metal segregation results in continuous leachingof transitionmetalsduring long-termoperation,which largely hampers large-scale commercialization9\u201312. Thus, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the active sites and structural features of the LDH to tailor improved kinetics and stability together.\nInspired by theMn4Caoxo cluster in photosystem II,mimickingof enzymes exhibiting specific binding was expected to increase the catalyst activity, kinetics and stability. In fact, it was confirmed that carboxylate ligands from the amino acid resides of protein backbones stabilize the metal clusters in homogeneous systems13. Whether direct or indirect coordination occurs, carboxylic acid groups with different numbers, positions or orientations performed their respective functions. In particular, as internal bases, they promoted proton transfer via concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) processes14\u201317. Similar processes have been used to stabilize Ru in different ruthenium complexes and enhance the activity for water oxidation18. Hence, introducing ligands in homogeneous systems is an effective method for improving catalyst stability. However, the synergy between anchoring the carboxylates and the multi-metal active sites in heterogeneous catalysts has never been fully understood, which hinders the rational design of practical electrocatalysts.\nHerein, we introduce a static and dynamic compatibility anchor strategy and report a subsize NiFe-LDH nanosheet catalyst modified with trimesic acid (SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)). Specifically, by introducing functional ligands into the NiFe-LDH with regulated electrodeposited ions, the resulting superhydrophilic and superaerophobic SU-NiFeLDH(TA) catalyst exhibited higher electrocatalytic performance and stability at a large current (1500mAcm\u22122) for 1300 h, outperforming those reported until now. The hybrid catalyst showed a higher stability for more than 800h at current densities larger than 1000mAcm\u22122 under industrial conditions (60 \u00b0C and 6M KOH). Operando experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that coordination between the ligands andNiFe-LDHvia C\u2012O\u2012 Fe bonding stabilized the activemetal centers. Moreover, the dynamic evolution of the functionalized ligand accelerated the OER kinetics by activating the O\u2012H bonds in the reaction intermediates."

As discussed in Fig. S1, rapid degradation of the NiFe-LDH catalysts under alkalineOER conditions was caused by metal dissolution. Currently, there are few effective methods for inhibiting metal dissolution at the atomic scale, particularly for enhancing the long-term stability under industrial conditions.Thus, we anchored the metal atoms at the atomic level by alternating the structures of LDH to inhibit the leaching of the transition metal hydroxides in alkaline media."

            "text": "Based on the processes of photosystem II and CPET in homogeneous catalysis18, carboxylate groups were used to stabilize themetal centers in the LDH. Electrochemical deposition provided both coordinated\nand uncoordinated carboxylate ligands through redox reactions occurring near the electrode. NiFe-LDH with trimesic acid ligands was prepared through direct electrochemical deposition on carbon paper and named NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp. Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O served as both the conditioning agent and the Ni source. FeSO4\u00b77H2O was used as the Fe source, while trimesic acid afforded carboxylate groups for the crucial proton transfers and metal anchoring. In addition, the SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp was prepared via a similar method except that ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O) with different dissociation constants and redox properties was used to replace the FeSO4\u00b77H2O. The fabrication of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a. During the electrochemical deposition process, the pH changed near the working electrode, and the deprotonated trimesic acid carboxylates bonded with the metal centers17.\nThe phase composition of the resulting catalyst was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. S3, the diffraction peaks were indexed to those of Ni(OH)2 (PDF# 38-0715), consistentwith the LDH\n24. The scarce differences in the XRD patterns indicated that the phase composition was well maintained after the introduction of the ligand. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were used to provide structural information. Themultilayered lamellar structure was identified, and the lattice spacings of NiFe-LDH@cp, NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp were 0.7 nm, which corresponded to the (003) planes of NiFe-LDH (Fig. S4). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Fig. S4c (inset) for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp displayed Debye-Scherrer rings for the (113), (015) and (101) planes of Ni(OH)2. The micromorphologies of the samples were assessed with SEM. As shown in Fig. 1b, after the introduction of the trimesic acid ligands, NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp exhibited a typical morphology with ultrathin wrinkled nanosheets. Unlike NiFeLDH(TA)@cp, the SEM images shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S5 for SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp exhibited ultrathin nanosheets with smaller lateral sizes (~47.90 nm) and rougher surface structures. In Fig. S6, the TEM images of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and NiFe-LDH@cp reveal obvious nanosheet structures. In contrast, thereweremore folds in SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp. These results indicate that trimesic acid bonded to metal ions with different valence states during electrochemical deposition, and this affected the growth and aging of the LDHphase17,25,26. Among themetal ions, Fe3+ induced the formation of smaller nanosheets due to the smaller acidity coefficient of Fe3+ compared with that of Fe2+ (pKa[Fe3+] =2.84, pKa[Fe2+]=6.74) (Fig. S7), which was confirmed by the TEM images of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp presented in Fig. S8. It was evident that SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp consisted of smaller nanosheets (~56.68 nm) than NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp (~733.67 nm), which was consistent with the SEM results. This provides an important strategy for optimizing the morphology to facilitate mass transfer and bubble diffusion.\nIn an effort to identify the composition of trimesic acid in the asprepared samples, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained and showed in Fig. S9. Two distinct peaks at 1650 and 1382 cm\u22121 were attributed to the bending vibrations of H2O and the stretching vibrations of NO3 groups, respectively. Signals associated with M\u2012OH bonds in the layered double hydroxides appeared within the range 400\u2013650 cm\u22121. Compared with NiFe-LDH, TA and TANa, the peaks at 1620 and 1433 cm\u22121 were ascribed to \u028bas(\u2012COO\u2012) and \u028bs(\u2012 COO\u2012). The broad bands at 769 and 727 cm\u22121 were related to vibrations of the benzene rings in TA. Significantly, two peaks at 1160 and 850cm\u22121 were observed for the SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) sample, which corresponded to C\u2012O\u2012Fe vibrational modes. These results indicated that the trimesic acid ligands were successfully anchored in NiFe-LDH. The Raman spectra of theNiFe-LDH@cpandNiFe-LDH(TA)@cpelectrodes (Fig. S10) contained two intense signals at 455 and 546 cm\u22121, which were assigned to the Eg bending mode and A1g stretching mode of M\u2012 OH species in the LDH, e.g., Ni\u2012O signals and overlapped Fe\u2012O signals20,27. Notably, the Ni\u2012OH peaks for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp were\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6714 2\nredshifted to 448 and 530 cm\u22121, respectively. This indicated electron transfer between Ni and Fe20,28. Two peaks at 683 and 721 cm\u22121 for SUNiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp were ascribed to the M\u2012OH signals of the LDH and C\u2012H signals of trimesic acid, respectively. The stretching modes of coordinated carboxylate groups derived from trimesic acid were observed at 1421 cm\u22121. These characterization data suggested that trimesic acid was successfully anchored in the NiFe-LDH.\nThe electronic states of the sampleswere investigatedwithX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S11, the Ni 2p peaks for NiFe-LDH@cp and NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp located at 856.1 eV and 873.7 eV were ascribed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 binding energies, respectively. The Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks for SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp appeared at 855.5 and 873.1 eV, respectively. The shifts originated from the different dissociation constants and valence states of the metal ions (Fe2+/Fe3+ salts), which slightly modified the local electronic structure of theNi atom. In Fig. 2b, the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cpwere broader than those ofNiFeLDH@cp and were deconvoluted into six peaks. The peaks at 712.5 and 725.5 eV, along with the satellite peaks, confirmed the presence of Fe3+, which was consistent with NiFe-LDH@cp. The peaks at 708.6 and 722.3 eV were assigned to C\u2012O\u2012Fe species, which proved that trimesic acid was anchored to the LDH by C\u2012O\u2012Fe bonds29,30. The high-resolution C 1 s spectra for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and NiFeLDH(TA)@cpwere deconvoluted into peaks for three surface carbon components (Fig. 2c), which were nonoxygenated carbon (C\u2012C: 284.8 eV), oxygen-containing carbon (C\u2012O: 286.2 eV), and carboxyl carbon (O = C\u2012O: 288.1 eV) in the ligands31. Additionally, three oxygen species, including adsorbed water molecules (Ow), defects with low oxygen coordination levels (Ov), and metal\u2012OH bonds (M\u2012OH), showed peaks at 529.0, 530.5, and 536.2 eV in Fig. 2d and Fig. S11d, respectively6,32. Additionally, the proportion of Ov in the SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp sample was dramatically higher (26.43%) than those in NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp (16.34%) and NiFe-LDH@cp (16.61%). These results indicated that ligand functionalization and structure optimization resulted in smaller and rougher nanosheet structures, which\nprovided more edge sites and optimized the local electronic structures.\nEnhanced OER electrocatalytic activity and stability To demonstrate the use of ligand functionalization and structural optimization to enhance the electrocatalytic performance, a typical three-electrode system immersed in a 1M KOH electrolyte solution was used to study the electrocatalytic OER performance of these LDH samples (Fig. 3). Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were measured with scan rates of 5mV s\u22121 with 90% iR compensation unless otherwise stated. Notably, the SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp catalyst displayed the highest OER catalytic activity (Fig. 3a). According to the LSV curves, it exhibited the lowest overpotential of 248mV at a current density of 100mAcm\u22122 and outperformedNiFe-LDH(TA)@cp (265mV) andNiFeLDH@cp (308mV). Figure 3b shows the Tafel plots for the catalyst samples, and both SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp exhibited lower Tafel slopes of 31.1 and 40.6mV dec\u22121, respectively, compared to that of NiFe-LDH@cp (98.4mV dec\u22121). The results indicated accelerated kinetics of the catalyst after carboxyl functionalization. The activities and kinetics of the catalysts prepared via ligand introductionwere better than those of previously reported LDH-based catalysts (Fig. 3c and Table S1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the catalytic kinetics33. As shown in Fig. 3d and Table S2, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp exhibited the smallest semicircle radius (1.69 \u03a9 cm\u22122) and the smallest charge-transfer resistance, implying fast charge-transfer kinetics in the OER. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst was calculated from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (Fig. S12). The Cdl was calculated fromcyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtainedwith different scan speeds over the potential range 1.183 to 1.233 V vs. RHE. As seen in Fig. 3e, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp exhibited the largest Cdl of 3.2 mF cm\n\u22122, which was nearly twice that of NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp (1.64 mF cm\u22122) and four times that of NiFe-LDH@cp (0.81 mF cm\u22122). The higher Cdl was mainly due to the uniquemorphology of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp, which provided many exposed active sites. To compare the intrinsic activities, the current densities were normalized with the electrochemical\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6714 3\nsurface areas of the catalysts (Fig. S13a). As a result, the SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp catalyst showed the highest intrinsic activity among the samples, indicating that both the trimesic acid ligands and the improved active surface area contributed to the increased activity. The LSV curves for the as-prepared samples were shown in Fig. S13b without iR correction. The SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp catalyst also showed optimal catalytic performance. Stability is another critical factor for OER electrocatalysts. The carboxyl-functionalized catalysts exhibited significantly improved stabilities. For example, NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp showed a higher stability after OER catalysis for 24 h (Fig. S14). The chronoamperometry curves for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp (Fig. S15) were determined with 1M KOH. Degradation of the current density was negligible after continuous testing for 150h at 1.73 V vs. RHE in a threeelectrode system. XRD, FTIR and Raman analyses were conducted on SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp after OER stability testing (p-SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) @cp). As shown in Fig. S16, the XRD pattern for p-SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) @cpwas consistent with that of fresh SU-NiFe-LDH(TA). In Fig. S17, the Raman peaks for p-SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp shifted to 474 and 544 cm\u22121, which were associated with Ni\u2012O vibrations in NiOOH moieties. In addition, Raman peaks for coordinated and uncoordinated carboxylates were observed in p-SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp, indicating that the trimesic acid ligands were stably anchored to the NiFe-LDH during the OER stability tests. This was validated by the FTIR spectrum of p-SUNiFe-LDH(TA)@cp. As seen in Fig. S18, the observed peak at 573 cm\u22121 was attributed to M\u2012O. The signals associated with coordinated carboxylates were detected at 1373, 769 and 727 cm\u22121. The signals associated with uncoordinated carboxylates appeared at 1608, 1454, 1404, 1276, 1246, 744 and 688 cm\u22121. In addition, the vibrational peaks of Fe\u2012 O\u2012C were observed at 1160 and 850 cm\u22121 in the p-SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) @cp spectrum, which confirmed the higher structural stability. To investigate the impact of the carboxylate ligands on the electronic structure before and after the OER, additional analysis was needed. XPS was used to investigate the electronic states of the three samples after the stability test (p-NiFe-LDH@cp, p-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cpandp-SUNiFe-LDH(TA)@cp), as shown in Fig. S19 andTableS3. In particular, the peaks at 856.1 (Ni 2p3/2) and 873.7 eV (Ni 2p1/2) for NiFe-LDH@cp increased to 856.8 and 874.4 eV (\u0394E = 0.7 eV) after the OER test (pNiFe-LDH@cp). The Fe 2p peaks of p-NiFe-LDH@cp were located at 712.8 and 725.8 eV, which are 0.3 eV higher than those for NiFeLDH@cp. Meanwhile, the proportion of Ov for p-NiFe-LDH@cp increased to 53.23%, indicating that metal dissolution created more defects. However, few changes were observed in the XPS spectra of NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp after the OER tests (named p-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and p-SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp, respectively). These results suggested that the strategy of anchoring carboxylate ligands stabilized the structure and coordination environment of the catalyst, thereby enhancing its stability. In addition, studies of the active sites areparticularly important for improving the stability. As shown in Fig. S20, Ni provided the main active sites, and TA anchoring of the Fe species was essential for high stability, as shown by comparing the activities of the samples with different metal and ligand contents. The concentration of dissolved metal ions was measured by ICP\u2012MS (Fig. 3f and Table S4). Compared with NiFeLDH@cp, the concentrations of Ni and Fe in the electrolyte were dramatically decreased for NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) @cp after 24 h of electrolysis. These results confirmed that the trimesic acid ligands stabilized the metal sites in NiFe-LDH, inhibited the dissolution of the metal ions and thus prolonged the lifetimes of the LDH electrocatalysts. To enable application as an OER catalyst in different fields and with different equipment, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) was prepared via electrochemical deposition on different conductive substrates, including carbon paper (cp), carbon cloth (cc), and nickel foam (nf) (Fig. S21a). Figure S21b shows the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cc, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@nf and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp. The nearly overlapping curves suggested similar OER activities, demonstrating that the preparation of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) met the requirements of different scenarios. Moreover, the performance of the targeted catalyst at an industrial current density (e.g., > 1000mA cm\u22122) was studied for practical application. An SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@nf OER\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6714 4\nelectrode and a platinum HER electrode were paired to construct an alkaline water electrolysis system (SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@nf(+)//Pt(-)AWE). As presented in Fig. 3g, the SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@nf(+)//Pt(-)AWE system maintained approximately 98% of the initial current density (1500mA cm\u22122) after 1300 h of continuous operation at 2.18 V. The stability was superior to those of recently reported advanced catalysts (Table S5 and S6). The SEM images of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@nf before and after continuous operation (1300 h) exhibited similar lateral sizes ( ~ 44.98 nm) and ultrathin nanosheet morphologies (Fig. S22), which corroborated thehigher structural stability of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) during industrial use. To move further toward industrial application, an SUNiFe-LDH(TA)@nf OER electrode and a commercial nickel foam (nf) HER electrode were paired to construct an alkaline water electrolysis cell (SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@nf(+)//nf(-)AWE) for use under industrial conditions (60 \u00b0C and 6MKOH). As shown in Fig. 3h, the SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) @nf(+)//nf(-)AWE cell delivered a current density of 1000mAcm\u22122 at 1.90 V and maintained its activity without decay for more than 800 h.

The corresponding evolution law andmechanism for theOERprocess could provide insight into the design and development of electrocatalysts.\nContact angle tests with water droplets and studies of the release mechanism for O2 bubbles are critical for understandingmass transfer and the stability of the OER electrode34. Fig. 4a\u2013c displays the contact angle test results for NiFe-LDH@cp, NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp, and SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp. The carbon paper used in this study was hydrophobic (Fig. S23). The contact angles for ultrapurewater onNiFe-LDH@cp and NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp were 18\u00b0 and 15\u00b0, respectively, while the contact angle of ultrapurewater on SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp was close to 0\u00b0. The rough surface of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp with the smaller nanosheets provided superhydrophilicity. Interestingly, the contact angle for ultrapure water on NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp dropped sharply to 0\u00b0 after standing for 0.1 s but remained at 14\u00b0 on NiFe-LDH@cp (Fig. S24). These significant changes showed that the inserted layers formed by trimesic acid increased the rate of electrolyte diffusion across the surfaces and between the layers. In addition, since the cavitation effect caused by the bursting bubbles could cause serious damage to the nanostructure35,36, the evolution of bubbles on the electrode surface could impact the structural stability37. Digital photographs of O2 release from different electrodes were captured during galvanostatic scans at 200mA cm\u22122. As shown in Fig. S25, the oxygen bubbles generated on theNiFe-LDH(TA)@cpand SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp electrodes were much smaller and almost invisible. To gain insight into the generation and disengagement of the bubbles, the process was recorded in situ with a 3D confocalmicroscope coupledwith an electrochemical workstation. Figure 4d\u2013f illustrates the formation and disengagement of O2 bubbles over 40 s. The O2 bubbles were firmly adhered to the surface of the NiFe-LDH@cp electrode and grew into a large bubble measuring 34.67 \u03bcm. In contrast, the O2 bubbles were much smaller before escaping fromNiFe-LDH(TA)@cpand SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp. In particular, the diameter of the oxygen bubble on SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)\n@cpwas only 8.54\u03bcm. Thismeant that the oxygen bubble disengaged immediately after it was formed, which provided much faster reexposure of the catalytic sites to the surrounding electrolyte. The superaerophobic and superhydrophilic behavior of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) @cp accelerated the release of the bubbles and mass transfer, which improved the activity and stability.\nTo understand the intrinsic mechanism for the efficient OER catalysis by SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp, in situ Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the evolution of the carboxyl groups in the trimesic acid ligands during water oxidation. In situ Raman spectra were collected over the potential range 0.30\u20130.58 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with intervals of 20mV. As shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. S26, the relative changes seen in the Ni\u2012OH vibrations at 450 and 521 cm\u22121 were related to oxidation during the OER process. Compared with NiFe-LDH@cp, weak peaks appeared at 1421 cm\u22121 for the coordinated carboxylates (\u2012COO\u2012) in the NiFeLDH(TA)@cp and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp samples, and the intensities varied little with the working potential. The coordinated carboxylates stabilized the metal centers and acted as static rivets to inhibit metal dissolution. Remarkably, as the potential was increased, a broad bond appeared at 1642 cm\u22121 and was assigned to a stretching mode of the uncoordinated carboxyl groups (\u2012COOH), and it remained stable during water electrolysis with the NiFe-LDH(TA)@cp and SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@cp samples. In addition, in situ FTIR testswereused to study the dynamic evolution between uncoordinated (\u2012COOH) and coordinated (\u2012COO\u2012) carboxylate groups and determine the electrochemical mechanism. The test pattern and details are provided in the Supporting Information and Fig. S27. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5b. In addition to the well-defined peak at 702 cm\u22121, which was attributed to vibrations of the M\u2012OH groups, two peaks appeared at 1620 cm\u22121 (\u028bas(\u2012COO\u2012)) and 1433 cm\u22121 (\u028bs(\u2012COO\u2012)) for the pristine SU-NiFeLDH(TA)@nf at 0 V. With increasing voltage, two broad peaks appeared at approximately 3000 cm\u22121 and were assigned to \u028b(\u2012OH) of the uncoordinated carboxylates (\u2012COOH), and these remained stable\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6714 6\nduring the operation. Meanwhile, a peak centered at 1608 cm\u22121 arose, and it corresponded to an antisymmetric stretching vibration of \u2012COOH (\u028bas(\u2012COOH)). These results provide solid evidence for the involvement of the carboxyl groups in proton transfer by the OER intermediates. Benefiting from the multiple carboxyl groups and their distribution in the trimesic acid molecules, the uncoordinated carboxylates located near the catalytic centers functioned as ferries to promote proton transfer from intermediate to base (Fig. 5c).\nDFT calculations were conducted to investigate the mechanism for stabilization/activation of themetal active sites by the ligands. Two lamellar structures for pristine NiFe-LDH and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) are illustrated in Fig. S28 and Fig. 6a. Anchoring of themetal centers by the trimesic acid in SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) was studied by the density of states (DOS) and charge analyses. The coordinated locations were labeled as SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Fea, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Nia, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Oa, and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Ob. As seen in Fig. 6b, the 3d orbitals of SU-NiFeLDH(TA)/Fea overlappedmore and thus had stronger interactions with the 2p orbitals of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Oa, which facilitated the binding of the ligands to the metal centers in SU-NiFe-LDH(TA). The charge density difference in Fig. 6c indicated electrons were transferred from C (trimesic acid) and Fe to the neighboring O atom via C\u2012O\u2012Fe bonds. Bader charge analysis was used to explore charge transfer between the NiFe-LDH and the deprotonated trimesic acid ligands in SU-NiFeLDH(TA). According to the Bader charges shown in Fig. S29, the electrons from Fea and C (trimesic acid) were transferred to Oa sites. The strong electronic interactions between the ligands and nickel-iron hydroxides in SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) stabilized the metal species and improved the stability of the SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) electrode during the OER.\nBased on the anchoring structures, the Gibbs free energies for the neighboring Nib and Feb sites in SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) were studied and compared with those in NiFe-LDH (Figs. S30, S31 and S32). Figure 6d and Fig. S33 show the free energy profiles obtained for the OER at the\nSU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Nib, SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Feb, NiFe-LDH/Nib, and NiFeLDH/Feb sites. The rate-determining step (RDS) for the OER on the Nib and Feb sites in NiFe-LDH was the formation of *O and *OOH, respectively, and the highest free energy changes were 2.67 and 2.12 eV at U = 0V. After introducing the ligands, the RDS was deprotonation of OH- to form *O in SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Nib. The reaction energies decreased to 2.06 and 1.94 eV at U = 0V for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Nib and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Feb, respectively, which were lower than those of NiFe-LDH/Nib and NiFe-LDH/Feb. Specifically, the reaction energies for conversion of *OOH to O2 were only 0.178 and 0.003 eV at U =0V for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Nib and SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)/Feb, respectively, which were much lower than those of NiFe-LDH/Nib (0.470 eV) and NiFeLDH/Feb (1.154 eV). These results indicated that the uncoordinated carboxylates of SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) reduced the energy of the deprotonation stepoccurring during theOERprocess, whichwas related to the dynamic evolution of the uncoordinated carboxylates (Fig. 5). To understand the dynamic role of the uncoordinated carboxylates, the O\u2012H bond lengths in both the *OOH and *OH intermediates were investigated. Figure 6e andTable S7 show that theO\u2012Hbond lengths in both the *OOH and *OH intermediates for SU-NiFe-LDH(TA) were longer than those in NiFe-LDH. This indicated that the uncoordinated carboxylates in the ligand acted as proton ferries to activate the O\u2012H bonds in the intermediates and improve the kinetic performance via rapid proton transfer. The in situ Raman spectra and DFT calculations provided experimental and theoretical evidence for proton transfer via the uncoordinated carboxylates.\nIn conclusion, we report here NiFe-LDH catalysts modified with trimesic acid (SU-NiFe-LDH(TA)) that were grown on various conductive substrates. The small lateral sizes and ultrathin structures generated the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic character of the SU-NiFe-LDH(TA). It exhibited OER performance with a lower overpotential (219mV at 10mA cm\u22122) and a decreased Tafel slope (31.1mV dec\u22121). Moreover, the material showed OER stability for over 1300 h at\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6714 7\n1500mAcm\u22122 without significant degradation or morphological collapse. In situ characterization and control experiments indicated that the high performance and stability originated from dynamic evolution of the uncoordinated carboxyl groups anchored on the LDH. That is, the coordinated carboxylates anchored via C\u2012O\u2012Fe bonds stabilized themetal active sites. The uncoordinated carboxylates ferried protons between the OER intermediates and bases to improve the OER performance. This work uncovered the intrinsic mechanism by which carboxylate ligands stabilized and activated metal centers and highlights the potential for commercial application of carboxyl ligandfunctionalized catalysts in high-current water electrolysis."
