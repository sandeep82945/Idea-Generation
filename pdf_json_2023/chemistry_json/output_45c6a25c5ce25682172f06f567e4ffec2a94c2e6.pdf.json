This hyperglycemia can be controlled temporarily using a-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) such as acarbose, sulfonylureas, miglitol, voglibose, etc.7\u201311,28 Diabetes is one of the top 10 causes of death globally. Together with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular, cancer, and respiratory diseases, diabetes account for over 80% of all premature deaths.29 Resistant bacterial infection in diabetic patients is also common. Diabetic patients have more exposure to antibiotics and have signicant problems with the healing of infections because of reduced blood supply, which affects the body to resist against disease.30 It has also been investigated that hyperglycemia-induced free radicals that cause oxidative stress, leads to the development and progression of diabetes and its complications.

Spectroscopic techniques conrmed all synthesized ligands (L1\u2013L8), and molecular docking analysis was performed into the catalytic pocket of the a-glucosidase enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1).40 Aer inspecting the best binding interaction and poses in the catalytic pocket of the enzyme, two ligands L1 and L4 were selected to synthesized the series of di- or triorganotin(IV) complexes by the reported procedure40,42 (R = butyl, phenyl, cyclohexyl), as presented in Scheme 2.

The absence of signals for \u2013OH proton at 12.95\u201310.95 ppm mentioning the deprotonation of \u2013COOH group and coordination to tin(IV) atom.53 The proton signals of \u2013CH2 at 1.38\u20131.19 ppm, \u2013CH at 1.55\u20131.40 ppm and aromatic protons at 8.15\u20137.41 ppm appeared at the same value in the both for ligands and complexes.

The literature revealed that such complexes behaved as monomeric diorganotin(IV) dicarboxylates following a hexa-coordination of tin(IV) with trans-octahedral geometry (Fig. 1 (a)).54\nIn dimeric complexes (2, 8), the butyl protons were resolved at proper positions. Only one set of signals for the butyl group indicative of the same tin(IV) environments around the butyl group. There was also one triplet of methylenic protons, which were probably because of the equivalent surroundings of similar protons to the endo and exo tin(IV) atom. Hence, it was challenging to identify the butyl of endo and exo Sn(IV) centers which veried the FTIR results.55 Therefore, it could be suggested that dimer existed in a hexa-coordinated geometry having a unique view linked from one unit to the other by Oatom of carboxylate of one unit to Sn(IV) atom of another unit as shown in Fig. 1(b).56\nThe 1H NMR spectra for triorganotin(IV) compounds (4\u20136, 10\u2013 12) veried the tetrahedral structure and exhibited that the carboxylate oxygen was coordinated to Sn(IV) core in this arrangement (Fig. 1(d)).57 All the butyl protons (4, 10) at 1.56\u20130.85 ppm, phenyl protons (5, 11) in multiplets at 7.45\u20136.79 ppm and cyclohexyl protons (6, 12) at 1.47\u20131.15 ppm were well resolved.58\nIn 13C NMR spectra of organotin(IV) complexes, the carboxylate group values were observed in the downeld region (179.45\u2013167.93 ppm) in contrast to the free acid ligands (173.70\u2013164.38 ppm).

In all complexes (1\u201312) the presumed 13C NMR signals were observable and ultimately agreed with the formation of expected compounds (Fig. S41\u2013S60 in ESI\u2020). The 13C NMR shi values of butyl in monomers (1, 3, 7, 9) were observed in the range at 29.45\u201313.15 ppm with octahedral geometry (Fig. 1 (a)),54 while for dimmers (2, 8) butyl groups of endo and exo centers had no different values indicating equal tin sites. The solution state studies of such complexes suggested that in non-coordinating solvents, there were two different environments for butyl groups linked by endo and exo-cyclic tin(IV) cores,56 but in this study the same environment for the butyl group was observed, which recommended a unique view with hexa coordinated tin(IV) and veried the 1H NMR and FTIR results (Fig. 1(b)). Triorganotin(IV) complexes (4\u20136, 10\u201312), 13C NMR values of butyl, phenyl and cyclohexyl have been observed at 29.45\u201313.15 ppm, 145.65\u2013137.39 ppm, and 29.19\u201320.44 ppm, respectively, which supported four coordinated tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 1(d)).57,58\nThe chemical shis values for 119Sn NMR proposed a coordination number pattern around the tin(IV) atom.

Scherrer formula to determine average particle size (D), specically valid for strain-free ne particles, is given as:\nD = (kl)/(b cos q) (1)\nwhere k is Scherrer constant or shape factor (here equals 0.9), l is the wavelength of incident X-rays and b is peak broadening related to the current sample determined aer subtracting the instrumental peak broadening from observed peak broadening.65 Average value of D for complex 1 was found to be 34.30 nm.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 10768\u201310789 | 10771\nTable 1 Lattice parameter, average crystallite size and intrinsic strain as calculated from the XRD data (value of 3 is positive for tensile strain and negative for compressive strain)\nMethods\nSample (ao = nm)\nL1 (0.3894) 1 (0.3896) 2 (0.3895) 3 (0.3896) 4 (0.3896) 5 (0.3892)\nScherrer method D (nm) 28.73 34.30 33.93 41.46 35.30 34.37 Hall method D (nm) 45.70 39.57 45.86 48.32 48.73 25.46 3 0.0016 \u22120.0024 \u22120.0027 \u22120.0019 \u22120.0028 \u22120.0032 Williamson\u2013Hall (UDMa) D (nm) 45.50 37.72 43.21 32.71 29.17 22.90 3 0.0008 \u22120.0023 \u22120.0018 \u22120.0024 \u22120.0013 \u22120.0009 Size\u2013strain plot D (nm) 35.50 43.13 36.78 39.80 39.33 26.68 3 0.0006 \u22120.0003 \u22120.0006 \u22120.0006 \u22120.0003 \u22120.0002 Halder\u2013Wagner method D (nm) 16.31 31.48 29.44 21.14 22.43 19.92 3 \u22120.0630 \u22120.0313 \u22120.0333 \u22120.0411 \u22120.0328 \u22120.0347 a UDM = uniform deformation model.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The conformation which has the highest binding affinity value was further used for analysis. The rst six compounds (L1\u2013L6) of the series showed docking scores ranging from \u22127.1 to \u22127.5 kcal mol\u22121. Compounds L7 and L8 led to the least predicted binding affinity value of \u22126.0 and \u22125.8 kcal mol\u22121 respectively compared to the reference PAA value of \u22126.7 kcal mol\u22121 (Table 2).\nThe compound L1 with the highest predicted affinity value of \u22127.5 kcal mol\u22121 showed an excellent binding pattern in the enzyme's catalytic cavity and exhibited the four hydrogen bond interactions.

The compound L2 possessing the \u2013OH group at the third carbon of phenyl ring exhibited similar binding patterns compared to ligand L1. The \u2013 OH group at the third carbon of the phenyl ring engaged the Asp202 and His332 via hydrogen bond interaction. The important side chain residue Arg400 showed the hydrogen bond interaction with an oxygen atom of acetamide carbonyl group. The amino acid residue Tyr65, Asp33 and the rest of amino acid residues Thr203, Phe206, Gly228, and Tyr235 showed similar interaction as for compound L1. The unfavorable interaction was observed among \u2013OH hydrogen atoms at the phenyl ring and amino acid residue Arg200. The ligand L3 bearing the \u2013OH group at the fourth carbon of phenyl ring showed completely different conformation in the enzyme's catalytic pocket than ligands L1 and L2.

At the same time, third hydrogen bond interaction was found with His332 and acetamide oxygen atom of the carbonyl group. The rest of the amino acid residues showed hydrophobic interactions. Ligands L4, L5 and L6 possessing the \u2013NO2 moiety at the second, third and fourth carbon atom of the phenyl ring displayed the binding affinity value of \u22127.5, \u22127.1, \u22127.0 kcal mol\u22121 respectively. Compound L4 bearing the \u2013NO2 moiety at the second carbon of phenyl ring showed the four-hydrogen bond interaction in the enzyme's catalytic pocket. A hydrogen bond interaction was formed between the oxygen atom of carbonyl of acetamide and side-chain residue Arg400. Three hydrogen bond interaction between carboxyl oxygen atom and side-chain residues Tyr65, Arg200 and His332. The \u2013NO2 group at the phenyl ring only showed the p\u2013anion interaction with Asp333 residue (Fig. 6(c) and (d), 2D and 3D). Compound L5 was found to mediate the four-hydrogen bond interaction with the target enzyme's active sites of side-chain residue. The hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid involved the Asp62 and Gln170 via hydrogen bond interaction.\nAt the same time, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of carboxylic acid occupies the His105 with hydrogen bond interactions. The fourth hydrogen bond interaction was found between His332 and the oxygen atom of acetamide carbonyl group. The rest of the amino acid residues in the pocket showed the salt bridge and hydrophobic type interactions. Ligand L6 with a predicted binding affinity value of \u22127.0 kcal mol\u22121 exhibited the four-hydrogen bond interaction. The \u2013NO2 group at the fourth carbon of the phenyl group was found to make two hydrogen bond interactions with Gly228. In contrast, for compounds L4 and L5 the \u2013NO2 group at the second and third carbon of the phenyl ring did not show any signicant interaction. The oxygen atom of carbonyl and hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid showed the hydrogen bond interaction with His105 and Asp62 respectively.\nCompounds L7 possessing the \u2013OH and \u2013OCH3 at the second and third carbon of phenyl ring and compound L8 keeping the \u2013 OH and \u2013OCH3 at second and fourth carbon of phenyl ring respectively showed the least predicted binding affinity values of \u22126.2 and \u22125.8 kcal mol\u22121 compared to the reference. Analysis of least conrmation of compound L7 in the targeted enzyme's binding cavity showed two hydrogen bond interactions with Glu271 and Arg400. The Arg400 was found in establishing the two-hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl group of acetamide and the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid. The hydrogen atom of \u2013NH acetamide showed the hydrogen bond interaction with amino acid Glu271. The conrmation of compound L8 in the enzyme's catalytic pocket only showed the hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 6(e) and (f), 2D and 3D with the least value). From the molecular docking poses and binding interaction analysis of proposed ligands (L1\u2013L8) in the catalytic pocket of the a-glucosidase enzyme, it was concluded that such type of derivatives could t well in catalytic pocket of selected enzyme. The position of substituent as \u2013OH and \u2013NO2 at the second carbon of phenyl ring (for compound L1 and L4) is mainly resulted in minimizing the compound and enzyme\n10774 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 10768\u201310789\ncomplex energy. It is due to the compounds orientation that established the strong bonding with Tyr65 and Arg400 compared to the position of identical substituents at third and fourth carbon of phenyl ring. In comparing chemical moieties \u2013 OH and \u2013NO2 we found that the \u2013OH moiety has an advantage over the \u2013NO2 due to its small molecular size and less polarity.\nDocking studies of metal complexes\nMolecular docking simulation was performed to explore organotin(IV) metal complexes effect and their binding pattern interaction in the catalytic pocket of a-glucosidase enzyme. For this purpose, L1 and L4 ligands has been selected to design the eight organotin(IV) metal complexes (3\u20136, 9\u201312). The ligand selection was made due to the higher predicted binding affinity value of\u22127.5 kcal mol\u22121, best orientation and excellent binding pattern in the enzyme's pockets. These metal complexes were named diorganotin(IV) and triorganotin(IV) complexes according to the chemistry of organic moieties (n-butyl, phenyl, and cyclohexyl) attached to tin(IV) center. These metal complexes showed the predicted binding affinity value of \u22126.04 to \u22120.61 kcal mol\u22121 (Table 2) and displayed the catalytic pocket's well-tted orientation (Fig. 7). The insertion of metal ion causes the subtle enhancement of the structural framework ligand and organic moieties on the tin(IV) center, which helped to establish hydrogen bonding, p\u2013p stacking and van der Waals interaction with amino acid residues. Triorganotin(IV) complex 4 showed the highest predicting binding affinity value of \u22126.04 kcal mol\u22121 among all the organotin(IV) complexes. The metallic center tin(IV) ion's tributyl group showed the p\u2013alkyl interaction with Ile146, Phe147, Phe166, Pro230, and Tyr389. A hydrogen bond was also found between \u2013OH of the ligand L1 and amino acid residue Ile272. At the same time, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, bonded to tin(IV) metal ion displayed the p-lone pair interaction with amino acid Phe297. The rest of the amino acid residues showed the van der Waals interactions (Fig. 8(a) and (b)). Complex 10 exhibited the second highest predicted binding affinity value of \u22125.64 kcal mol\u22121, indicating stable conformations in the targeted enzyme's catalytic pocket, did not display high-energy and unfavorable interaction (Fig. 8(c) and (d), 2D and 3D). The butyl chain exhibited the same interaction pattern, as explained for metal complex 4.\nThe third best predicted binding affinity was displayed by complex 6 of \u22121.70 kcal mol\u22121 and showed excellent conformation in the catalytic pocket. The \u2013OH group at the second carbon of the ligand's phenyl ring was found hydrogen bond interaction with Gly228. The rest of the amino acid residues in the catalytic pocket only displayed the hydrophobic interaction. At the same time, the tricyclohexyl group showed the p\u2013anion interactions with amino acid residues Ala229 and Tyr235. Complex 5, where the tin(IV) center is coordinated with three phenyl rings, displaying the predicted binding affinity values of \u22120.71 kcal mol\u22121.

The conformation of complex 3 occupied the extra space of the enzyme's pocket due to the more extensive framework than complex 4. The butyl group displayed the same interacting behavior as discussed for complex 4 and 8.

While the diorganotin(IV) complex 9 derived from ligand L4 showed a predicted affinity value of 13.59 kcal mol\u22121, which was found lower than complex 3. The conformation of complex 9 in the catalytic pocket occupied the signicant and insignicant amino acid residues. The \u2013NO2 group at both phenyl rings exhibited the four hydrogen bond interactions with two important amino acid residues Tyr65, Arg200 and two nonsignicant amino acid residues, Thr226 and Asp274. But an unfavorable interaction was also observed for amino acid residue Arg400 which was reported as essential amino acid residue to stabilize the enzyme and ligand in the catalytic pocket.

But in the case of L4 metal complexes, the \u2013NO2 substituent causes them to maximize the enzyme and tin(IV) metal complex energy and resulted in a decrease predicted binding affinity, which may be due to high electron-withdrawing effect and wider electronic environment of \u2013NO2 moiety. In comparing triorganotin(IV) and diorganotin(IV) metal complexes, triorganotin(IV) displayed the\n10776 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 10768\u201310789\nhighest predicted binding affinity values responsible for energetically stable enzyme and tin(IV) metal complexes. Diorganotin(IV) metal complexes showed the least predicted binding affinity values due to the more extensive framework of tin(IV) metal ion complexes, which caused unfavorable interactions with essential amino acid residues. In comparing of organic moieties coordinated to tin(IV) metal ion, it is observed that the butyl chain has the advantage over phenyl and cyclohexyl group, due to single bond rotation and exibility, so the butyl chain adjusted t well in the catalytic pocket. The rigidity of the phenyl ring and torsion of the cyclohexyl ring may be another factor.

Among the proposed ligands and complexes, the complexes 4, 6, and 10 showed potent inhibitory potential with IC50 values of 21.54 \u00b1 0.45, 35.20 \u00b1 1.02 and 37.96 \u00b1 0.81 respectively compared to standard acarbose with IC50 values of 42.51 \u00b1 0.21. The metal complex 12 displayed IC50 values of 44.00 \u00b1 0.41 which was found near the standard.While complexes 5 and 11 showed IC50 values of 73.61 \u00b1 0.71 and 87.91 \u00b1 1 which were found about one-fold high than the acarbose. On the other hand an abrupt decrease in inhibition value was observed for complexes 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 (Table 3). In comparing a-glucosidase inhibition of selected ligands L1 and L4, L1 displayed the IC50 values of 40.96 \u00b1 1.33 which was found equal to standard. In contrast, L4 exhibited the IC50 values of 44.00 \u00b1 1.43, which can be considered better than standard (Fig. 9).\nThe structure\u2013activity relationship of these compounds suggested that the ligand L1 possessing the \u2013OH at the second carbon of phenyl ring has an advantage over the ligand L4\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nbearing the \u2013NO2 at the second carbon of phenyl. If we compare these ligand's binding and interaction mode in the target enzyme's catalytic pocket, the \u2013OH group participated in establishing hydrogen bond interaction while the \u2013NO2 group remained inert.\nTriorganotin(IV) complexes (4, 10) possessing the butyl group coordinated to tin(IV) center showed the best inhibitory value of a-glucosidase. It is noteworthy that complexes 4 and 10 also have the highest predicted binding affinities value of \u22126.4 and \u22125.64 kcal mol\u22121. Both complexes showed the well tted orientation in the enzyme's catalytic pocket and butyl moieties established the p\u2013alkyl interactions. On the other hand triorganotin(IV) complexes 6 and 12 possessing the cyclohexyl moieties attached to the metallic center showed enzyme inhibition with IC50 37.96 \u00b1 0.81 and 44.01 \u00b1 1.4 respectively. Comparing the inhibitory activity with the molecular docking interaction pattern of both complexes 6 and 12 in the enzyme catalytic pocket displayed that the cyclohexyl moieties established the hydrophobic bonding with amino acid residues and did not form any unfavorable bump. A hydrogen bond interaction was also observed between \u2013OH of ligand and amino acid residue Gly228 for complex 6. The cyclohexyl moieties tted well inside the catalytic pocket due to exibility in the ring. In contrast, complexes 5 and 11 having the phenyl group coordinated to metallic center tin(IV), showed inhibition values of IC50 73.61 \u00b1 0.71 and 87.91 \u00b1 0.54 for the a-glucosidase enzyme. The rise in inhibitory values may be due to rigidity and the bigger size of the phenyl group by occupying more space in the cavity of the enzyme. The interaction pattern of these complexes in the catalytic pocket of enzymes displayed that the phenyl ring caused unfavorable bumps with insignicant amino acid residues outside the catalytic pocket. Diorganotin(IV) metal complexes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 displayed an abrupt increase in values of IC50 139 to <500 (Table 3). This behavior showed that the smaller metal framework (tri-organotin(IV)) has an advantage over the broader metal framework (diorganotin(IV)). Overall, the inhibition trend of organotin(IV) metal complexes depending on the organic moieties can be summarized as butyl > cyclohexyl > phenyl and triorganotin(IV) > diorganotin(IV)."

The obtained results are graphically summarized in Fig. 11. Antimicrobial results were evaluated as; inhibition zone of 15\u201321 mm, inactive; 22\u201328 mm, moderately active; 29\u201332 mm, highly active. Overall the organotin(IV) complexes displayed excellent activity against the bacterial strains than the free ligands. The highest activity of organotin(IV) complexes can be related to chelate formation, structure diversity, nature of attached ligand, molecular weight and lipophilicity.75 Generally in tin(IV) complexes, the antimicrobial mechanism of action involved the cellular enzyme, cellular impairment due to denaturing of proteins and alteration of the standard cell process due to the various interactions as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.76\nComplex formation and unique structure of organotin(IV) complexes cause an increased antimicrobial activity, which may be associated with the delocalization of electrons and alter the polar nature of metal. This electron delocalization causes an increase in the plasma membrane permeability. Comparing the cell wall structure of Gram-positive and Gram-negative, Grampositive bacteria possess the simpler cell wall, thus, were more induced by complexes to give higher activity. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have an outer lipid membrane formed from lipopolysaccharide, which involved antigenic specicity of Gram-negative bacteria.77,78 Triorganotin(IV) complexes 4, 10 (R = butyl), 5, 11 (R= phenyl), and 6, 12 (R= cyclohexyl), displayed the highest to moderate antibacterial activity with inhibitory zone 25\u201332 mm.\nComplex 10 showed the highest inhibition value for Gramnegative and Gram-positive with inhibition zone 30\u201332 mm. These results can be associated with exibility and polarity of butyl chain length, which may increase lipophilicity and penetrate via the bacterial wall. L1 and triorganotin(IV) complex 4 displayed the highest activity against Gram-positive but moderate for Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, triorganotin(IV) complexes 5 and 11 possessing the phenyl moiety displayed moderate activity for Gram-positive and negative strains with similar inhibition zone. The lower activity of phenyl bearing organotin(IV) complexes may be due to the more electron-withdrawing effect of phenyl ring and rigidity. Triorganotin(IV) complexes 6 and 12 bearing the cyclohexyl moiety showed excellent inhibition for Gram-positive bacterial strains but poor inhibitory values for Gram-negative.

            "text": "The synthesis of biological useful di- and triorganotin(IV) complexes from N-acetylated b-amino acids has been accomplished. Complete characterization of the complexes was achieved by elemental analysis, FTIR, multinuclear (1H, 13C, 119Sn) NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The results veried monodentate coordination of the triorganotin(IV) complexes with tetrahedral geometry in solid form and bidentate coordination with trigonal bipyramidal geometry in solution form. Diorganotin(IV) complexes exhibited bidentate coordination with trans-octahedral geometry as monomers and a hexa-coordinated geometry as dimers. Powder XRD analysis of selected complexes revealed that complexes crystallized as face-centered cubic phases and negative value of strain explained tin(IV) insertion in the organic framework, which resulted in elongation of the lattice. Molecular Docking analysis of ligands, diand triorganotin(IV) complexes (monomer) on the catalytic pocket of the a-glucosidase enzyme (PDB ID: 3WY1) revealed that ligands and triorganotin(IV) complexes (4, 6 and 10) showed the highest values of predicted binding affinity. The poses analysis of complexes in the catalytic pocket of enzyme displayed that triorganotin(IV) complexes can occupy the amino acid residues and have well tted in conformation in the catalytic pocket compared to diorganotin(IV) complexes. In vitro antidiabetic activity of compounds was evaluated against the aglucosidase enzyme and compared with standard acarbose. The results of activity reveal that triorganotin(IV) complexes 4, 6, and 10 exhibited the potent enzyme inhibition activity with values of IC50 21.54 \u00b1 0.45, 37.96 \u00b1 0.81 and 35.20 \u00b1 1.02 mg mL \u22121 respectively compared to standard acarbose with IC50 values of 42.51 \u00b1 0.21 mg mL\u22121 and diorganotin(IV) complexes. A good correlation among molecular docking of metal complexes and in vitro antidiabetic activity was also found. In vitro, antioxidant and antibacterial studies were also evaluated to determine the biocidal potential of synthesized ligands and complexes. Triorganotin(IV) complexes 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 displayed signicant antiradical activity near to standard. Complexes displayed the highest to moderate antibacterial activities inuenced by the nature of alkyl groups (butyl, phenyl, and cyclohexyl) attached to the central tin(IV) atom.
