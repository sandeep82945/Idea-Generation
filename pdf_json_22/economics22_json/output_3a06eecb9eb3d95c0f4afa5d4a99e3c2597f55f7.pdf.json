ABSTRACT Introduction Stillbirth continues to be a public health concern in highincome countries, and with mixed results from several stillbirth prevention interventions worldwide the need for an effective prevention method is ever present. The Safer Baby Bundle (SBB) proposes five evidencebased care packages shown to reduce stillbirth when implemented individually, and therefore are anticipated to produce significantly better outcomes if grouped together. This protocol describes the planned economic evaluation of the SBB quality improvement initiative in Australia. Methods and analysis The implementation of the SBB will occur over three statebased health jurisdictions in Australia\u2014New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, from July 2019 onwards. The intervention is being applied at the state level, with sites opting to participate or not, and no individual woman recruitment. The economic evaluation will be based on a wholeofpopulation linked administrative dataset, which will include the data of all mothers, and their resultant children, who gave birth between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2023 in these states, covering the preimplementation and postimplementation time period. The primary health outcome for this economic evaluation is late gestation stillbirths, with the secondary outcomes including but not limited to neonatal death, gestation at birth, mode of birth, admission to special care nursery and neonatal intensive care unit, and physical and mental health conditions for mother and child. Costs associated with all healthcare use from birth to 5 years post partum will be included for all women and children. A costeffectiveness analysis will be undertaken using a differenceindifference analysis approach to compare the primary outcome (late gestation stillbirth) and total costs for women before and after the implementation of the bundle. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for the SBB project was provided by the Royal Brisbane & Women\u2019s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: HREC/2019/QRBW/47709). Approval for the extraction of data to be used for the economic evaluation was granted by the New South Wales Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee (approval number: 2020/ETH00684/2020.11), Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: EO2020/4/1167), and Public Health Approval (approval number: PHA 20.00684) was also granted. Dissemination will occur via publication in peer reviewed journals, presentation at clinical and policyfocused conferences and meetings, and through the authors\u2019 clinical and policy networks. This study will provide evidence around the cost effectiveness of a quality improvement initiative to prevent stillbirth, identifying the impact on health service use during pregnancy and longterm health service use of children.",

This study will provide evidence around the cost effectiveness of a quality improvement initiative to prevent stillbirth, identifying the impact on health service use during pregnancy and long- term health service use of children.\nINTRODUCTION Reducing the rate of stillbirth has become a global priority, driven by consecutive calls for action over the last decade,1 in recognition of the frequency of the occurrence2 and suboptimal performance of many countries in reducing this often preventable tragedy.3 Globally, an estimated 2 million late gestation (28 weeks or more) stillbirth occur each year4 with over half potentially preventable with known effective interventions; an avoidable loss of human life with far reaching social and economic consequences.5 If the trends of stillbirth observed between 2000 and 2019 continue, it is projected that 20 million babies will be stillborn within the next decade.6 Among this 20 million, 2.9 million stillbirths could potentially be prevented by accelerating\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 Use of linked administrative data to capture the realworld costs and outcomes of the Safer Baby Bundle. \u21d2 Follow- up to 12 months post partum to potentially capture any unintended consequences of the Safer Baby Bundle. \u21d2 Inclusion of both in- hospital and out- of- hospital health service use. \u21d2 Lack of randomised controlled environment to identify the consequences of the Safer Baby Bundle on health service utilisation. \u21d2 Limited capture of some health services such as over the counter medications, some allied health services, and non- government funded services; and time period of the intervention aligns with COVID- 19 pandemic.\nP atna).

Within high- income countries, stillbirth has been noted to be associated with modifiable factors such as undetected fetal growth restriction, smoking during pregnancy, maternal supine sleeping position and decreased fetal movements,10\u201313 pointing to the need for ongoing improvement of the provision of maternity care around such factors. In recognition of this the Safer Baby Bundle (SBB) has been proposed for the Australian context14 15\u2014 this consists of five evidence- based elements, each shown to reduce likelihood of stillbirth individually, which grouped together should result in better outcomes.\nThe potential for stillbirth reduction interventions to increase the use of caesarean section and induction of labour rates, and birth at earlier gestation, including early term births, has been raised by findings from the AFFIRM trial8 and the Saving Babies\u2019 Lives Bundle.4 This may not be surprising per se, as delivering all babies early would in effect end all late gestation stillbirth.16 However, these results are significant as there is concurrent effort to stem the global increase in use of early caesarean section17 and induction of labour18 due to concern of long- term effects of child health and development outcomes such as allergies, asthma, diabetes, gastroenteritis, autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and poorer child cognitive and developmental outcomes.18\u201327 In addition to the health impacts, these health outcomes also have important economic consequences associated with longterm health service needs.28 29 Previous economic evaluation of stillbirth interventions has identified varying levels of cost effectiveness, and costs to healthcare funders.4 30\nThe evaluation of the SBB thus needs to consider the effect on reduction in stillbirth rate, as well as the costs implications\u2014through any effect on background health services use such as caesarean section, induction of labour and preterm birth\u2014independent of background trends in this area. This protocol describes the planned economic evaluation of SBB quality improvement initiative in Australia."

In partnership with the Centre of Research Excellence in Stillbirth, each state Department of Health is responsible for the roll- out and embedding of the SBB\u2014with the evidence- based education programme and resources in the five core elements. The SBB is being promoted across the entirety of the participating states\u2014and were freely available from October 2019 to all hospitals and healthcare professionals. The decision of whether to implement the SBB at the service level was left to individual hospitals within each state, and was dependent on each hospital committing formally to be part of the state- based initiative.\nThe overall evaluation of the SBB will quantify the population- level effect on late gestation stillbirth (primary outcome), clinical intervention and preterm birth; identifying variations in the provision of care on outcomes for vulnerable (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, migrant and refugee and rural and remote) women; evaluating the coverage, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity and sustainability of the SBB; exploring the indirect process and contextual factors that influenced the provision of the SBB in light of the COVID- 19 pandemic; exploring the views of women and maternity health professions on the bundle; and estimating the cost- effectiveness of the SBB compared with standard care. For the purposes of this protocol, we focus exclusively on this last element\u2014 the economic evaluation of the SBB. The design of the economic evaluation is independent of other components of the overall evaluation.\nThe design of the economic evaluation, as described in this protocol, follows the recommendations of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Randomised Controlled Trial Cost- Effectiveness Analysis (ISPOR RCT- CEA) Task Force31 and ISPOR Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards.32 This economic evaluation is being conducted alongside an observational study, rather a clinical trial; however, the ISPOR RCT- CEA recommendations are the most aligned with the study design."

This will use a within- study analysis, as opposed to a modelled economic evaluation, with all inputs into the evaluation coming from observation study data as opposed to being drawn from the literature. A 5- year time horizon will be used, which is considered sufficient to capture key longer term health impacts of the SBB, without introducing unnecessary uncertainty; however, a lifetime horizon will also be used in a sensitivity analysis. A health funder perspective will be used, as is preferred by Australian funding decision- makers33 as it is intended that this analysis will be used to inform ongoing funding decisionmaking around the SBB."

Victoria commenced implementation in June 2019; New South Wales in February 2020; and Queensland in October 2020. The wash- in implementation period, for the purposes of the evaluation will be for 2.5 years stretching from July 2019 to December 2021. The postimplementation maintenance phase will cover 2 years, stretching from January 2022 to December 2023. A list of formally participating hospitals in each state will be recorded as a part of the evaluation.\nBased on the annual number of births in 2018 in Victoria (n=77 700), New South Wales (n=94 200), and Queensland (n=59 600) it is expected that around 463 000 births will be exposed over the 2- year maintenance phase. Currently, 23 hospitals in Victoria, 25 hospitals in New South Wales and 43 hospitals in Queensland are participating, which together provide care for over half of the population giving birth annually. The evaluation will consider the effect of the intervention over the entire state, with the analysis considering the effect on both the \u2018targeted\u2019 implementing sites, and the sites not formally participating (\u2018non- targeted\u2019 implementors).\nControl\u2014preimplementation The control group will represent standard care prior to implementation. The preimplementation time period for the control time period will be prior to June 2019 for Victoria, February 2020 for New South Wales, and October 2020 for Queensland. All births across New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria prior to these dates will be included for the control group."

The PDC records all reported births within each state. It contains information on maternal demographics, clinical characteristics of mothers, medical interventions preformed in pregnancy and childbirth and infant outcomes. This will contain an estimated 1.8 million and 2.1 million children. The PDC within each state will then be linked to the \u25ba Admitted Patient Data Collection: contains details of all inpatient admissions to public and private hospitals, and day surgery units. Covers diagnosis and procedure (International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, ICD- 10), and diagnosis- related group (Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Group) codes for each admission. \u25ba Non- Admitted Patient Data Collection: contains details of all services provided through public hospital outpatient clinics, including of service, and investigations performed. \u25ba Emergency Department Information System/Data Collection: contains details of all emergency department presentations in public hospitals. Covers triage category and diagnosis.\nThese datasets will then be linked by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), a part of the Federal Department of Health, to: \u25ba Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims records: contains details of all healthcare services provided under the MBS, such as general practitioner, specialist and some allied health attendances, and diagnostic tests, plus serviced assessed in private hospitals.

However, for children born after December 2018 less than 5 years of follow- up data will be available, and any physical or mental health conditions for the child that developed up to the age of five will be imputed. A series of machine- learning informed risk prediction models will be constructed to predict the likelihood of developing infections, cancer, metabolic, mental health, gastrointestinal, neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, renal, or reproductive system conditions, injury or pregnancy, as classified by hospital admission and ICD- 10 code, or autism based on MBS service use (as defined above).\nThe data will be randomly split into a 70% sample to be used to construct the models and a 30% sample to be used for validating the models. Stepwise probit models will be constructed whereby all available variables will be used to predict the conditions of interest. Backward selection stepwise estimation will be used to remove any variables that were not significantly related to the outcome of interest, or that are perfectly correlated, with a cut- off of p<0.20. The final predictive risk model will include variables that can predict each of the conditions of interest.\nThe 30% validation sample will be used to assess the model\u2019s performance in correctly identifying women who gave birth in private hospitals. Model performance will be assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the 95% CI. These models will then be applied to the dataset for children with missing follow- up health data, with imputation commencing after last follow- up time point (rather than from birth). The relationship between birth characteristics and later onset of chronic health conditions is not thought to be\naffected by the SBB, although the SBB may affect the birth characteristics."

The cost of all services accessed will be identified (described in table 1 below), and then summed to provide a cost per woman and child dyad. Costs will also be disaggregated to present costs to government funders, private health insurers and individual of pocket costs of health service use. Sunk costs, such as those related to the design and development of the intervention will not be considered. Study data will be used to estimate ongoing implementation costs such as educational resource development, and training costs.

Based on these data, we will estimate the DDD estimator using an ordinary least square linear regression with robust standard errors. Due to the skewed nature of cost data, the costs will be log- transformed prior to analysis. This model will include a dummy variable for the implementation time period (preimplementation, wash- in, post implementation), a time (calendar year) variable, and an implementation/time period interaction term (the coefficient of which will be the DDD estimator). A dummy variable for sites formally participating in the quality improvement initiative will also be included, and costs will also be adjusted for mother\u2019s age, body mass index, if assisted reproductive technology was used for conception, mother\u2019s pre- existing health conditions deemed to influence pregnancy, parity and plurality. Changes in primary outcome measure between groups will be assessed as a linear probability model with a DDD approach, similar to the above.\nCost-effectiveness analysis The cost- effectiveness of the Safe Baby Bundle initiative will be conducted. An incremental cost- effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated by comparing the Safe Baby Bundle initiative to the usual care group using the following formula:\nICER = ( Implementation group total costs ) \u2212 ( Pre\u2212implementation group total costs ) (\nImplementation group number of stillbirths ) \u2212 ( Pre\u2212implementationgroup number of stillbirths )\nTo assess uncertainty around the ICER, we will use bootstrapping (running 1000 iterations) to estimate ICER CIs.34 35 This will be graphically presented in the form\nP atna).

            "text": "The aim of this study is to investigate the cost- effectiveness of the SBB. This will be achieved by comparing the costs and outcomes associated with SBB, including all background health service use of women during pregnancy and birth, as well as ongoing health service of the surviving children. This will also capture any unintended consequences of the SBB such as increase in induction of labour, caesarean section, birth at earlier gestation.\nThe key challenge in designing the economic evaluation lies in the lack of randomised controlled environment to assess the impact of the intervention. Maternity care in Australia, as in other high- income countries is constantly changing, with intervention rates that have been steadily increasing over the previous decades,37 38 and the impact of COVID- 19, which resulted in an increase in the use of telehealth, and a disruption in the provision of antenatal care delivery. A key challenge in this evaluation is to identify the true impact of the SBB, independent of background trends in service provision. The study design proposed in this protocol attempts to address this issue using a DDD approach, and the inclusion of both sites\nP atna).
