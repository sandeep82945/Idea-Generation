    "abstractText": "N6-methyladenosine (mA)modification plays important roles in bioprocesses and diseases. AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) is one of twomA demethylases. Here, we reveal that ALKBH5 is acetylated at lysine 235 (K235) by lysine acetyltransferase 8 and deacetylated by histone deacetylase 7. K235 acetylation strengthens the mA demethylation activity of ALKBH5 by increasing its recognition of mA on mRNA. RNA-binding protein paraspeckle component 1 (PSCP1) is a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5 and preferentially interacts with K235-acetylated ALKBH5 to recruit and facilitate the recognition ofmAmRNA by ALKBH5, thereby promoting mA erasure. Mitogenic signals promote ALKBH5 K235 acetylation. K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 is upregulated in cancers and promotes tumorigenesis. Thus, our findings reveal that the mA demethylation activity of ALKBH5 is orchestrated by its K235 acetylation and regulatory subunit PSPC1 and that K235 acetylation is necessary for the mA demethylase activity and oncogenic roles of ALKBH5.",

            "text": "of ALKBH5 and tumorigenesis\nXiao-Lan Zhang1,5, Xin-Hui Chen1,5, Binwu Xu2,5, Min Chen1,5, Song Zhu1,3,5, Nan Meng1, Ji-Zhong Wang1, Huifang Zhu1, De Chen1 , Jin-Bao Liu 4 & Guang-Rong Yan 1\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A)modification plays important roles in bioprocesses and diseases. AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) is one of twom6A demethylases. Here, we reveal that ALKBH5 is acetylated at lysine 235 (K235) by lysine acetyltransferase 8 and deacetylated by histone deacetylase 7. K235 acetylation strengthens the m6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5 by increasing its recognition of m6A on mRNA. RNA-binding protein paraspeckle component 1 (PSCP1) is a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5 and preferentially interacts with K235-acetylated ALKBH5 to recruit and facilitate the recognition ofm6AmRNA by ALKBH5, thereby promoting m6A erasure. Mitogenic signals promote ALKBH5 K235 acetylation. K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 is upregulated in cancers and promotes tumorigenesis. Thus, our findings reveal that the m6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5 is orchestrated by its K235 acetylation and regulatory subunit PSPC1 and that K235 acetylation is necessary for the m6A demethylase activity and oncogenic roles of ALKBH5.\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of eukaryotic mRNAs. In mammals, m6A is installed on mRNA by the m6Amethyltransferases METTL3 andMETTL14 (writers) and erased by the demethylases ALKBH5 and FTO (erasers)1\u20135. The m6A modification ofmRNAplays critical roles inmultiple fundamental cellular biological processes, including RNA splicing, stability, translation, sublocalization, and secondary structures1,5\u201311. Abnormal m6A on mRNA regulates the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including cancer1,12,13.\nALKBH5 is one of twomammalian RNAm6Ademethylases and can remove m6A methylation on mRNA3,14. ALKBH5 shares a nucleotide recognition lid and conserved active site residues with nucleic acid oxygenases such as FTO15. Knockout (KO) of ALKBH5 led to impaired spermatogenesis and male infertility in mice3. ALKBH5 expression can\nbe induced by hypoxia and HIF1\u03b1 in cancer cells16. Subsequent reports showed that ALKBH5 was upregulated and could facilitate cancer cell stemness and self-renewal, tumorigenesis, and progression by removing m6A from the mRNA of target genes in glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer; moreover, other studies have shown that ALKBH5 inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis in lung cancer and pancreatic cancer14,16\u201319.\nParaspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) is an RNA-binding protein and represents one of three proteins found in paraspeckles, which are nuclear bodies located in the interchromatin space of the cell nucleus adjacent to speckles.

K235 acetylation strengthens the m6Ademethylation activity of ALKBH5by increasing its binding tom6A on mRNA. RNA-binding protein PSPC1 is revealed here as a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5. PSPC1 binds to RNAs and preferentially interacts with K235-acetylated ALKBH5, recruiting and facilitating the recognition of m6A by ALKBH5, thereby promoting m6A removal frommRNA. Mitogenic signals stimulate ALKBH5K235 acetylation, which promotes tumorigenesis. Thus, our study revealed that K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 couples with the ALKBH5 subunit PSPC1 to regulate the m6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5 and also revealed the crosstalk between protein acetylation and m6A modification of mRNA."

            "text": "In the in vitro m6A-demethylation activity assays, surprisingly, we found that immunopurified ALKBH5 from eukaryotes had stronger demethylation activity and higher pan acetylation levels than recombinant ALKBH5 from bacteria (Fig. 1a, b). Therefore, the effects of ALKBH5 acetylation on the m6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5 are of interest. ALKBH5 was acetylated in cells when ALKBH5 was\nimmunoprecipitated and detected with an anti-pan acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 1c). A potential acetylated lysine site at 235 (K235) was further identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1d).\nTo confirm that ALKBH5 is acetylated at K235, ALKBH5 knockout (KO) cells were constructed using CRISPR\u2012Cas9 technology (Supplementary Fig. 1). We replaced K235 with either nonacetylated arginine (K235R) or acetyl-mimetic glutamine (K235Q) to construct ALKBH5 mutants. When wild-type ALKBH5 and its mutants K235R and K235Q were re-expressed in ALKBH5 KO cells, the acetylation of ALKBH5 was markedly reduced in the K235R and K235Q mutants compared with that of the wild-type ALKBH5 using the anti-pan acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 1e), suggesting that most acetylation in ALKBH5 is K235 acetylation. We generated an antibody (Ac-K235) specific to K235acetylated ALKBH5 and verified its specificity (Supplementary Fig. 2). K235-acetylatedALKBH5was readily detected inwild-type ALKBH5 but not in the K235R andK235Qmutants (Fig. 1e). K235 acetylationwas not detected in ALKBH5 KO cells (Fig. 1f). A similar result was obtained when ALKBH5 expression was knocked down using two anti-ALKBH5 siRNAs (Fig. 1g). Collectively, these results indicate that ALKBH5 is endogenously acetylated at K235 in cells."

Recombinant wild-type ALKBH5 also directly and efficiently decreased the m6A level of m6A-RNA oligos in the in vitro demethylation reaction, whereas the recombinant K235R mutant did not decrease the m6A level (Fig. 4d).\nNext, we performed transcriptome m6A sequencing to compare them6Aprofiles of the negative control (NC) cells andALKBH5KOcells stably re-expressing wild-type ALKBH5 (WT) or its mutant K235R (K235R). In total, m6A-seq identified 33044, 33561, and 34447 m6A peaks in NC, WT, and K235R cells, respectively. Compared with NC cells, 7011 m6A peaks, including 2247 upregulated peaks, were significantly altered in ALKBH5 KO cells stably re-expressing wild-type ALKBH5 (WT) (p <0.05); 10617m6Apeaks, including 6703 upregulated peaks, were significantly altered in ALKBH5 KO cells stably reexpressing the ALKBH5 K235R mutant (K235R). Compared with WT cells, 10648m6Apeaks, including 7931 upregulatedpeaks,were altered in K235R cells. More m6A peaks, particularly the upregulated m6A peaks, were altered in K235R cells than in WT cells compared with NC cells. The overall cellular RNAm6A abundance inWT cells was restored to that in NC cells, whereas the K235R cells did not exhibit restoration of the cellular RNA m6A abundance (Fig. 4e). The distribution of the m6A peaks in the 5\u2032UTR, coding DNA sequence (CDS), stop codon and 3\u2032UTRbetween the NC andWT cells was very similar but differed from that in the K235R cells (Fig. 4f). Themost commonm6Amotif \u201cGGACA\u201d was significantly enriched inm6A peaks in the NC andWT cells, and the m6Amotif was highly similar between theNCandWTcells but different from that in the K235R cells (Fig. 4g). Therefore, as expected, the\ndisappearance of ALKBH5 K235 acetylation eliminated RNA m6A demethylase activity and increased RNA m6A abundance, whereas the re-expression of wild-type ALKBH5, but not the K235R mutant, recovered the alteration of m6A induced by ALKBH5 KO.\nFurthermore, the overexpression of the acetyltransferaseKAT8 of ALKBH5 decreased the cellular RNA m6A, whereas the KD of KAT8 increased the cellular RNA m6A (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). Overexpression of the deacetylase HADC7 of ALKBH5 enhanced cellular RNA m6A, whereas KD of HDAC7 reduced cellular mRNA m6A (Supplementary Fig. 5e, f). KAT8overexpressionpromoted the reductionof cellular RNA m6A induced by wild-type ALKBH5 and K235Q reexpression in ALKBH5 KO cells but not by K235R re-expression (Fig. 4h, Supplementary Fig. 5g). Increasing K235 acetylation of recombinant ALKBH5, which was induced by purified KAT8, increased the removal of m6A on m6A-RNA oligos in the in vitro demethylation reaction, but the recombinant K235R mutant did not show the same effect (Fig. 4i). Decreasing K235 acetylation of recombinant ALKBH5, which was induced by purified HDAC7, impaired the removal of m6A from m6A-RNA oligos, but the recombinant K235R mutant did not show the same effect (Fig. 4j). Immunopurifiedwild-type ALKBH5 from KAT8-overexpressing cells and HDAC7 KD cells, but not the K235R mutant, directly and efficiently removed m6A from m6A-RNA oligos (Supplementary Fig. 5h, k), whereas immunopurified wild-type ALKBH5 from KAT8 KD cells and HDAC7-overexpressing cells, but not the K235R mutant, did not directly and efficiently remove m6A from m6A-RNA oligos (Supplementary Fig. 5i, j).

            "text": "To investigate how K235 acetylation affects the m6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5, the influences of K235 acetylation on ALKBH5 stability, subcellular localization, and RNA m6A recognition were determined. We found that the absence of K235 acetylation impaired the recognition andbinding of ALKBH5 toRNAm6A (Fig. 5a) but did not alter the protein level, half-life or sublocalization of ALKBH5 (Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013d). Relative to recombinant wildtype ALKBH5, the binding of the recombinant K235R mutant to RNA m6A was markedly impaired (Fig. 5b). Increasing K235 acetylation of recombinant ALKBH5, which was induced by purified KAT8, enhanced the binding of recombinant ALKBH5 to RNA m6A, but not that of the recombinant K235R mutant (Fig. 5c). Decreasing K235 acetylation of recombinant ALKBH5, which was induced by purified HDAC7, impaired the binding of recombinant ALKBH5 to RNA m6A, but not that of the recombinant K235R mutant (Fig. 5d). Therefore, K235 acetylation of ALKBH5promotes the binding and recognition of RNA m6A by ALKBH5. K235-acetylated ALKBH5 preferentially binds to the RNAbinding protein PSPC1 As shown in Fig. 6a, based on an analysis of the ALKBH5 structure (PDB: 4NJ4)15, the side chain of K235 is located on a loop that is distal to the structurally compact active site of ALKBH5, and K235 acetylation modification is on a surface that is accessible to binding partners, suggesting that K235 acetylation is unlikely to affect the catalytic activity of ALKBH5. We speculate that K235 acetylation may affect the binding of ALKBH5 to its regulatory subunits, thereby modulating the binding and recognition of RNA m6A by ALKBH5 and the removal of m6A in RNAs. However, to date, no regulatory subunits of ALKBH5 for erasing RNAm6A have been reported. Therefore, we further investigated the regulatory subunits of ALKBH5 for erasure of RNAm6A. The interactors of wild-typeALKBH5 and K235R mutants were investigated by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses in which the acetyltransferase KAT8 of ALKBH5 was overexpressed in cells.

We found that K235 deacetylation impaired the binding of ALKBH5 to endogenous PSPC1 and the colocalization of ALKBH5 with endogenous PSPC1 under normal cell culture conditions, whereas the acetyl-mimetic glutamine mutant K235Q retained the ability to interact and colocalize with PSPC1 (Fig. 6c, d, Supplementary Fig. 6d). Previous studies have shown that PSPC1 forms dimers and polymers with other RNA-binding proteins such as NONO and SFPQ20. We found that endogenous NONO and SFPQ did not bind towild-typeALKBH5or itsmutants K235R andK235Q (Fig. 6c),which is consistent with the interactome data (Fig. 6b), whereas NONO and SFPQ interacted with PSPC1 as previously reported (Fig. 6d), suggesting that PSPC1 formed other complexes with K235-acetylated ALKBH5. GST pull-down assays further showed that recombinant ALKBH5 directly bound to recombinant PSPC1 (Fig. 6e). Increasing the ALKBH5 K235 acetylation level, which was induced by the overexpression of KAT8, strengthened the interaction of ALKBH5 with PSPC1 but not the interaction of the ALKBH5 K235R mutant with PSPC1 (Fig. 6f). Increasing K235 acetylation of recombinant ALKBH5, which was inducedbypurifiedKAT8, increased the direct binding of recombinant ALKBH5 to recombinant PSPC1 (Fig. 6g). Collectively, these results indicate that K235 acetylation is essential for the interaction ofALKBH5 with PSPC1.\nWe speculate that the helix near K235 may be required for PSPC1 binding. The deletion of 70-75 aa (70-75 Del) near K235 in the ALKBH5 helix eliminated the interaction of ALKBH5 with PSPC1 (Fig. 6h), indicating that the 70-75 aa region near K235 in the ALKBH5 helix is required for the binding of ALKBH5 to PSPC1.\nALKBH5 has been shown to colocalize with mRNA-processing factors such as phosphorylated SC35 (SC35-pi) in nuclear speckles, and ALKBH5 KD resulted in the disappearance of SC35-pi staining3.\nWild-type ALKBH5 and K235Q mutant re-expression restored the signals of SC35-pi staining in ALKBH5 KO cells, whereas the re-expression of the ALKBH5 K235Rmutant failed to do so for the effects induced by ALKBH5 KD (Supplementary Fig. 6e); this is similar to the previously reported function of the demethylation-inactive mutant ALKBH5 H204A inwhich the iron ligand residueH204was substitutedwithAla3. The wild-type ALKBH5 and K235Qmutant colocalized with the nuclear speckle marker SC35-pi (Supplementary Fig. 6e), and PSPC1 also colocalized with SC35-pi under the condition of wild-type ALKBH5 or K235Q mutant expression (Supplementary Fig. 6f), suggesting that K235-acetylated ALKBH5 and PSPC1 were colocalized in nuclear speckles. Collectively, these results indicate that K235 acetylation promotes the interaction of ALKBH5 with PSPC1.\nPSPC1 is a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5 required for erasing RNA m6A We investigated the effect of PSPC1 on ALKBH5-mediated RNA m6A removal. The KD of PSPC1 increased the cellular RNA m6A levels, whereas PSPC1 re-expression decreased the cellular RNAm6A levels in PSPC1 KD cells (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Fig. 7a). The overexpression of PSPC1 decreased the cellular RNA m6A levels (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Fig. 7b). Furthermore, we found that neither recombinant PSPC1 itself nor purified PSPC1-FLAG from ALKBH5 KO cells could directly and efficiently decrease the RNA m6A levels of synthetic m6A-modified oligonucleotide substrates (Lane 3 in Fig. 7c, Supplementary Fig. 7c), suggesting that PSPC1 itself is not a demethylase for RNA m6A. The erasing of cellular RNA m6A by ALKBH5 was markedly blocked when the expression of PSPC1 was silenced in cells (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Fig. 7d), whereas PSPC1 overexpression increased the erasing of cellular RNA m6A by ALKBH5 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7e, Supplementary Fig. 7e). As expected, recombinant ALKBH5 directly removed the RNA m6A modification on m6A RNA oligos, and recombinant PSPC1 further directly increased the removal of the m6A\nb\nin pu\nt NC NC WT K2 35\nR\nNC NC WT K2 35\nR\nKO-ALKBH5 - + + + - + + +\nA m6A\nTo ta\nl p ro\nte in\nactin\nALKBH5-Flag\nALKBH5\nALKBH5\nALKBH5\nALKBH5-GST WT K235R WT K235R\nA m6A\nIn pu\nt\nInput ALKBH5\nALKBH5-GST WT WT K235R K235R HDAC7 - + - +\nm6A-oligos + + + +\nIn pu\nt\nHDAC7\nALKBH5\nAc-K235\nALKBH5 In pu\nt\nKAT8\nALKBH5\nAc-K235\nALKBH5\nALKBH5-GST WT WT K235R K235R KAT8 - + - + m6A-oligos + + + + In pu t\nIn pu\nt\na\ndc\n37\n37\n37\nkD 75 kD\n75\n75 kD\n75\n75\n100\n75 kD\n75\n75\n50\nFig. 5 | K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 increased its binding to RNA m6A. a The in vitro binding of wild-type ALKBH5 and itsmutant K235R tom6A-unmethylated or methylated RNA oligos was investigated in ALKBH5 KO HeLa cells stably reexpressing wild-type ALKBH5 or its mutant K235R using RNA pulldown assays. b The in vitro binding of recombinant wild-type ALKBH5 and its mutant K235R to\nm6A-unmethylated or methylated RNA oligos was investigated. c, d The in vitro binding of recombinant wild-type ALKBH5 and its mutant K235R to m6A-unmethylated or methylated RNA oligos was investigated after the recombinant wild-type ALKBH5 or its mutant K235R were treated by immunopurified KAT8 (c) or by immunopurifiedHDAC7 (d).

The immunopurified PSPC1 also directly and efficiently increased the erasing effects of immunopurified ALKBH5 on RNA m6A from synthetic m6A-modified oligonucleotide substrates in the in vitro demethylation reaction (Lane 3 in Fig. 7i).\nWe next performed transcriptome m6A sequencing to compare the RNA m6A targets regulated by ALKBH5 and PSPC1. A total of 5856 and 6111 m6A peaks were altered by ALKBH5 KD and PSPC1 KD, respectively. Among them, approximately 58% of the m6A peaks were commonly regulated byALKBH5KD and PSPC1 KD. As shown in Fig. 7f, both ALKBH5 KD and PSPC1 KD increased the overall cellular RNAm6A abundance, and the trendswere highly similar. The distributions of the ALKBH5-regulated m6A peaks and the PSPC1-regulated m6A peaks in the 5\u2032 UTR, CDS, stop codon, and 3\u2032 UTR were highly similar (Fig. 7g). These results indicate that the m6A targets mediated by ALKBH5 were highly similar to those mediated by PSPC1. Together, we show that PSPC1 is a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5 required for erasingRNAm6A.\nALKBH5 K235 acetylation is critical for the effects of PSPC1 on demethylation activity of ALKBH5 by facilitating the binding of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A Next, we demonstrated that the absence of K235 acetylation eliminated the synergistic effects of ALKBH5 and KD of PSPC1 on removing cellular RNA m6A (Fig. 7h). The immunopurified PSPC1 directly and efficiently increased the erasing effects of immunopurified ALKBH5 on RNA m6A from synthetic m6A-modified oligonucleotide substrates in the in vitro demethylation reaction, but not the erasing effects of ALKBH5mutant K235R (Fig. 7i). Taken together, K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 is critical for the effects of PSPC1 on the demethylation of ALKBH5.\nWe further showed that PSPC1 overexpression increased the binding and recognition of RNA m6A by ALKBH5 (Lanes 6 and 7 in Fig. 7j), whereas PSPC1 KD destroyed the binding and recognition of RNA m6A by ALKBH5 (Lanes 6 and 7 in Supplementary Fig. 7g) but did not change the protein level or sublocalization of the RNA m6A\nWT K2 35 R K2 35 Q ALKBH5-Flag\nPSPC1\nALKBH5\nInp ut\nIP: Flag IP: IgG\nWT K2 35 R K2 35 Q\nSFPQ\nNONO"

Recombinant PSPC1 increased the direct binding of recombinant ALKBH5 to RNA m6A (Fig. 7k). A previous study showed that PSPC1 bearing four mutations in its RNA binding domains (F118A/F120A/K197A/F199A, hereafter PSPC1mut) does not bind to RNAs26. PSPC1 did not increase the erasing of cellular RNA m6A by ALKBH5 or the binding of ALKBH5 to RNAm6Awhen the binding of PSPC1 to RNAswas eliminated (Fig. 7l, m, Supplementary Fig. 7h), implying that the binding of PSPC1 to RNA is essential for the effects of PSPC1 on the demethylation activity of ALKBH5 and the binding of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A.\nFurthermore, PSPC1 overexpression increased the recognition of RNA m6A by wild-type ALKBH5 but not by the ALKBH5 K235R mutant (Fig. 7j), whereas PSPC1 KDdestroyed the binding of wild-type ALKBH5 but not that of the K235Rmutant to RNAm6A (Supplementary Fig. 7g), suggesting that K235 acetylationof ALKBH5modulates the stimulatory\neffect of PSPC1 on the binding and recognition of RNAm6A by ALKBH5 Taken together, K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 is critical for the effect of PSPC1 on the m6A demethylation of ALKBH5 by facilitating the recognition of RNA m6A by ALKBH5.\nMitogenic signals stimulate K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 and the interaction of ALKBH5 with PSPC1 to reduce RNA m6A levels Next,we investigatedwhich signals promoteALKBH5K235 acetylation. We first examined the ALKBH5 K235 acetylation levels in response to serum deprivation and stimulation. Serum deprivation dramatically decreased the cellular ALKBH5 K235 acetylation level in cancer cells within 24 h but did not alter the ALKBH5 level (Fig. 8a). Conversely, the addition of serum to serum-starved cancer cells enhanced the ALKBH5 K235 acetylation level within 3 h (Fig. 8b).

Serum deprivation increased the mRNA m6A level, whereas serum restimulation of serum-starved cells decreased the mRNA m6A level (Supplementary Fig. 9). However, serum deprivation and restimulation did not change the K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 when the K235 site was mutated to K235R in ALKBH5 (Fig. 8e, f). Serumdeprivation and restimulation did not affect the cellular RNAm6A level when the K235 site wasmutated in ALKBH5 (Fig. 8g, h).\nFurthermore, we found that the mitogenic factor EGF increased K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 in a dose-dependent manner but did not alter ALKBH5 protein levels (Fig. 8i) and reduced cellular RNA m6A (Fig. 8j). To confirm that EGF increased ALKBH5 K235 acetylation through the acetyltransferase KAT8 of ALKBH5, KAT8 expression was knocked down during EGF treatment. KD of KAT8 completely blocked the enhancement of ALKBH5 K235 acetylation induced by EGF treatment, whereas KAT8 re-expression in KAT8 KD cells restored the\nenhancement of ALKBH5 K235 acetylation induced by EGF treatment (Fig. 8k). KAT8 KD attenuated the reduction in cellular RNA m6A induced by EGF treatment, whereas KAT8 re-expression recovered the reduction in cellular RNA m6A levels induced by EGF treatment (Fig. 8l). Collectively, our results indicate that mitogenic signals promote ALKBH5 K235 acetylation and ALKBH5 binding to PSPC1 and decrease RNA m6A through KAT8.\nK235 acetylation of ALKBH5 is critical for the roles of ALKBH5 in tumorigenesis Mitogenic signals play critical roles in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Previous studies have shown that ALKBH5 promotes tumorigenesis14,16\u201318,27. Therefore, the mitogenic signal that stimulated ALKBH5 K235 acetylation led us to speculate that ALKBH5 K235 acetylation affects tumorigenesis.

The ALKBH5KO-induced alterations in cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were restored to control levels after reexpression with wild-type ALKBH5 and K235Q but not after reexpression with K235R ALKBH5 (Fig. 9a\u2013d). Similar results were obtained in HCT-116 cells in which wild-type ALKBH5 and its mutants K235R andK235Q,whichwere resistant to anti-ALKBH5 siRNA,were reexpressed after cellular ALKBH5 expression was silenced by antiALKBH5 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. 10).\nFurthermore, HeLa cells stably re-expressingwild-type ALKBH5 or its mutant K235R in the ALKBH5 KO HeLa cell line were constructed. The tumors that arose in mice injected with ALKBH5 KO cells were much smaller than those in mice that were injected with NC cells in which ALKBH5 was not knocked out. The in vivo xenograft tumor growth with ALKBH5 KO cells stably re-expressing wild-type ALKBH5 was restored to thatwith NC cells, whereas the in vivo xenograft tumor growth with ALKBH5 KO cells stably re-expressing the K235R mutant was not restored to that with NC cells and was similar to that with ALKBH5 KO cells (Fig. 9e).\nThe differential m6A peaks between ALKBH5 WT and K235R (p \u22640.01 and logFC \u22651) were collected into a total of 1012 genes,\nincluding FOXM1, c-myc, SMAD7, and TACC3, which have been reported to be the m6A targets mediated by ALKBH5 in tumorigenesis. GO analyses showed that the 1012 genes were involved in system development, cell morphogenesis, cell differentiation, metabolic regulation, cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, cell migration, and immune regulation, which are related to tumorigenesis. As previously reported, KO of ALKBH5 decreased the protein levels of FOXM1, c-myc, SMAD7, and TACC3 (Fig. 9f). The ALKBH5KO-induced alterations of the FOXM1, c-myc, SMAD7, and TACC3 levels were restored to the control levels after re-expression with wild-type ALKBH5 but not after re-expression with the ALKBH5 K235R mutant (Fig. 9f).\nFinally, we determined the levels of K235 acetylation and ALKBH5, KAT8, and HDAC7 in ten pairs of matched fresh primary liver and gastric tumor samples and adjacent nontumor liver and gastric tissues. The K235 acetylation level of ALKBH5 was substantially higher in the primary liver and gastric tumors than that in their corresponding adjacent nontumor liver and gastric tissues. The ALKBH5 and KAT8 levels were also higher in tumors than those in their corresponding nontumor tissues, whereas the HDAC7 level was lower in tumors than that in their corresponding nontumor tissues (Fig. 9g).

            "text": "ALKBH5 is one of two RNA m6A demethylases3,14. Our findings reveal that the RNAm6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5 is orchestrated by its K235 acetylation and its regulatory subunit PSPC1 (Fig. 9h). K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 promotes its m6A demethylation activity by increasing the binding and recognition of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A, thereby strengthening the removal of m6A from RNAs. K235 acetylation strengthens the m6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5 by increasing the binding of ALKBH5 itself to RNAm6A. In addition, K235acetylated ALKBH5 preferentially binds to the RNA-binding protein PSPC1, which further facilitates the recruitment and recognition of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A, thereby facilitating the removal of RNA m6A modification by ALKBH5.\nLimited acetylation was detected in ALKBH5 mutants K235R and K235Q using the anti-pan acetylated lysine antibody, suggesting that other acetylation sites existed on ALKBH5 in addition to the K235 acetylation site. The K132 acetylation site has been reported in an acetylome profiling database28. The influences of K132 acetylation on ALKBH5 functionor activitywill be valuable to investigate in the future. Whether the activity of other methyltransferases or demethylases in them6Apathway is also regulatedbyacetylationmodificationswill also be valuable to explore in the future.\nIn this study, we found that the RNA-binding protein PSPC1 is a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5. PSPC1 preferentially binds to K235acetylated ALKBH5 and increases the demethylase activity of ALKBH5 by facilitating the recognition and binding of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A. PSPC1 itself did not alter the RNA m6A level based on an in vitro demethylation assay or alter the m6A level in ALKBH5 KO cells, indicating that the regulatory subunit PSPC1 is not a catalytic subunit of the ALKBH5 m6A demethylase complex. Previous studies have shown that PSPC1 is anRNA-binding protein and binds to RNA through its two RRMdomains (RRM1 andRRM2)29.When the binding of PSPC1 toRNAs is eliminated, PSPC1 does not strengthen the binding of ALKBH5 to RNAm6A and thus does not strengthen them6A demethylation activity of ALKBH5. The binding of PSPC1 to both RNAs and K235-acetylated ALKBH5 facilitates the recruitment and binding of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A, thereby facilitating m6A removal from RNAs by ALKBH5. Therefore, a regulatory model of the RNA m6A demethylase ALKBH5 eraser complexes is elucidated here in which ALKBH5 functions as the catalytic core, PSPC1 serves as an RNA-binding platform to recruit and facilitates the recognition of RNA m6A by ALKBH5 through the interaction with K235-acetylated ALKBH5, and K235 acetylation provides a link between ALKBH5 and its regulatory subunit PSPC1.\nPSPC1 is found in paraspeckles, which serve as dynamicmolecular scaffolds for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions to participate in the regulation of transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, RNA transport, A-to-I editing, andDNA repair20\u201322. PSPC1 forms dimers and polymers with other RNA-binding proteins such as NONO and SFPQ20. As expected, some PSPC1 binds to NONO and SFPQ to form a functional complex, whereas some PSCP1 binds to K235acetylated ALKBH5 to form another functional complex, which plays a critical role in RNA m6A demethylation.\nSurprisingly, the m6A distribution showed a higher start codon density for the K235Rmutant than for wild-type ALKBH5 (Fig. 4f). The cause of the distribution difference may be that in addition to binding to PSPC1, ALKBH5 regulates m6A demethylation in different regions of RNA, possibly by binding to different partners (subunits), which preferentially bind todifferent regions of RNA suchas the 3\u2032UTR,CDSor 5\u2032 UTR, indicating that other regulatory subunits or partners of ALKBH5 or K235-acetylated ALKBH5 exist. Wild-type ALKBH5 and ALKBH5 K235R mutants may bind to different partners to remove RNA m6A in different RNA regions. This phenomenon will be valuable for further investigation in the future.\nALKBH5 is upregulated in cancers and plays oncogenic roles as an m6A demethylase in glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, gastric\ncancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer14,16,17. We found that ALKBH5 expression and the levels of K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 and its acetyltransferase KAT8 are increased and its deacetylase HADC7 level is downregulated in liver and gastric cancers. KO and KD of ALKBH5 inhibited cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. K235-acetylated ALKBH5, but not non-K235-acetylated ALKBH5, exerts oncogenic functions, consistent with the results in which mitogenic signals stimulate K235 acetylation of ALKBH5 and cell growth. Therefore, we revealed that K235 acetylation is critical for the oncogenic roles of ALKBH5.\nIn summary, ALKBH5 is acetylated atK235by the acetyltransferase KAT8 and deacetylated by the deacetylase HDAC7. K235 acetylation is critical for them6Ademethylation activity of ALKBH5 by increasing the recognition and binding of ALKBH5 to RNA m6A. The RNA-binding protein PSPC1 is a regulatory subunit of ALKBH5 and preferentially interacts with K235-acetylated ALKBH5, recruits ALKBH5 to RNA m6A and further facilitates the recognition of RNAm6A by ALKBH5, thereby promoting m6A erasure. Mitogenic signals stimulate K235 acetylation of ALKBH5. K235 acetylation is upregulated in cancers and critical for the m6A demethylation activity and oncogenic functions of ALKBH5."

The ratio of m6A to A was determined based on the calculated concentrations.\nm6A-seq and data analysis m6A-seq was performed by LC-BIO Biotech, Inc. (Hangzhou, China) according to the reported protocol with minor modifications7,14. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s procedure. mRNA was purified using a poly-T oligo attached to magnetic beads (Invitrogen). mRNA was then fragmented into ~100 nt oligonucleotides using divalent cations under an elevated temperature. Fragmented mRNA was incubated with an m6A-specific antibody in IP buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 750mM NaCl and 0.5% Igepal CA-630) supplemented with 0.5\u03bcg/\u03bcl BSA for 2 h at4 \u00b0C. Elutedm6A-containing fragments (IP) anduntreated input control fragments (Input) were used for library preparation. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAll reads were mapped to the human genome (Version GRCh38.p12) by bowtie using default settings35. Mapped reads of m6A fragments and input libraries were provided through the R package exomePeak36, which identifies m6A peaks with a bed or bam format that can be adapted for visualization on the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) using IGV software (http://www.igv.org/). The HOMER program was used to identify de novo and known motifs37.\nThe m6A-seq data of K235 acetylation-mediated m6A profiles have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE142203. The m6A-seq data of ALKBH5- and PSPC1-mediated m6A profiles have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) of the BIG Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG, http://gsa.big.ac.cn) under accession number HRA000565.\nRecombinant ALKBH5 and PSPC1 protein production GST-ALKBH5 and PSPC1-His were cloned into the pGEX and pET 26b vectors, respectively. These vectors were transferred into BL21 (DE3) E. coli, and GST-ALKBH5, K235R mutant, or PSPC1-His expression was induced by 0.5mM IPTG for 4-5 h. The E. coli were then collected, lysed using extraction buffer (20mM HEPES, pH 7.6; 0.5M NaCl; 0.5\u03bcM EDTA; 10% glycerol; and 0.5% NP-40), and ultrasonicated. The supernatant fractions were then collected. Recombinant GST-ALKBH5 or K235R mutant protein beads were obtained from the supernatant fractions using Glutathione Sepharose (Millipore, G0924), and recombinant GST-ALKBH5 or its K235R mutant were eluted by L-glutathione reduction (Sigma, G4251). Recombinant PSPC1-His was purified from the supernatant fractions using a His-tag Protein Purification Kit (denaturant-resistant) (Beyotime, P2229S)."

Briefly, the reactions were performed in a 5\u03bcl demethylation reaction buffer containing 50pmolm6ARNAoligos, 500ng immunopurifiedwild-type ALKBH5-FLAG, ALKBH5-FLAG K235 and/or immunopurified PSPC1FLAG protein (or recombinant ALKBH5 and/or recombinant PSPC1), 50mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), 100mM KCl, 2mM MgCl2, 1.6 U/\u03bcl RNasin (Takara), 2 mM L-ascorbic acid, 300\u03bcM \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and 150\u03bcM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2\u00b76H2O. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then quenched by adding 5 \u03bcl denaturing buffer (2.2M formaldehyde, 50% deionized formamide, and 0.5\u0445 MOPS buffer) followed by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 10min. Next, 2\u03bcl of the reaction product was used for m6A dot blotting. The m6A-oligo sequence was 5\u2032-AUUGUGGm6ACUGCAGC-3\u2032.\nRNA affinity purification Biotin-labeled RNA oligos containing A or m6A were synthesized by GeneScript (China). RNA affinity purification was performed as previously described31,38. Briefly, 1 nmol of biotin-labeled A- or m6A-RNA oligos was bound to 100\u03bcl of Streptavidin Agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rotation. RNA-immobilized beads were mixed with whole cell extracts or recombinant ALKBH5 and PSPC1 and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 30min. These beads were eluted by adding 30\u03bcl of protein loading buffer and boiling for 5min. ALKBH5 and/or PSPC1 in the eluted mixtures were then detected using western blotting. The A and m6A oligo sequences were 5\u2032-CGUCUCGGACUCGGACUGCU-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGUCUCGGm6ACUCGGm6ACUGCU-3\u2032, respectively.\nCell proliferation, colony formation, andmigration and invasion assays Cell proliferation, colony formation, andmigration and invasion assays were performed as previously described31,39. Briefly, ALKBH5 KO HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated ALKBH5 plasmids for 12 h, or HCT-116 cells were cotransfected with anti-ALKBH5 siRNA together with the indicated ALKBH5 plasmids for 12 h. For the cell proliferation assay, 1 \u00d7 104 cells were then plated in 96-well culture plates and cultured. The cell number was counted at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h (n = 3). For the cell colony formation assay, 250cells were then plated in 6-well culture plates and cultured in a medium supplemented with 10% FBS. These cells were then fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet solution. The colony numberswere counted under amicroscope\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3815 13\n(n = 3). For themigration and invasion assays, 1 \u00d7 105 cells in 100\u03bcl cell suspensions with 0.05% FBS were added to the upper Transwell chambers for the migration assay (8.0\u03bcM pore size, BD) or the upper Transwell chambers coated with Matrigel for the invasion assay, and medium with 10% FBS was added to the bottom chamber. Migrated and invasive cells were stained with 5% crystal violet. Images were obtained from each membrane and migrated and invasive cells were counted under a microscope.\nConstruction of cell lines with stable expression of ALKBH5 or K235R ALKBH5 KOHeLa cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing wildtype ALKBH5-FLAG or itsmutant K235R and selected using puromycin. The ectopic expression of ALKBH5 was validated by western blotting. ALKBH5 KO HeLa cell lines stably expressing wild-type ALKBH5-FLAG (KO+WT) and ALKBH5-FLAG K235R (KO+K235R) were established."

Female BALB/c nude mice (3\u20134 weeks old) were purchased from Guangdong Medical Animal Experiment Center (Guangzhou, China). Briefly, the indicated HeLa cells (1 \u00d7 106) were injected subcutaneously into the right or left armpit of eachmouse to establish a tumor xenograft model (n = 10). After two weeks, these mice were euthanized by injecting sodium pentobarbital, and the tumor xenografts were excised and weighed.\nThe mice used in these experiments were bred and maintained under defined conditions (at room temperature (20-26 \u00b0C) and 40- 70% humidity with a 12 h light/dark cycle and access to food and water ad libitum) at the Guangdong Medical Animal Experiment Center (SPF-grade facility). The animal experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medicine University and Guangdong Medical Animal Experiment Center and conformed to the legal mandates and national guidelines for the care and maintenance of laboratory animals. The maximal tumor size permitted by this ethics committee should not exceed 20mm in any one dimension. In this study, the maximal tumor size was not exceeded 20mm in any one dimension."
