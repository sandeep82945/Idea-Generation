A given Hamiltonian may have several distinct Gibbs measures; in that case, one says that there is phase coexistence. This corresponds to the first-order phase transitions, when several phases are thermodynamically stable at the same value of the relevant parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.)\nFor models (Hamiltonians) defined on low dimensional lattices, it is known (see [4, 5, 19]) non-existence of infinite-volume Gibbs measures. However, pinning a field at the origin suffices to have a well-defined thermodynamic limit in any dimension ( [4, 19]). The resulting field is completely characterized by its gradients. These infinite-volume random fields of gradients are called gradient Gibbs measures, or Funaki-Spohn states [5] (for detailed motivations and very recent results see [1, 2], [7] - [12], [17, 18,20]).\nThis paper is devoted to GGMs of SOS model with alternating magnetism and spin values from the set of all integers on Cayley trees.\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n00 24\n5v 2\n[ m"

The gradient spin variables are defined by \u03b7\u27e8x,y\u27e9 = \u03c9(y)\u2212\u03c9(x) for each \u27e8x, y\u27e9 (see [12], [13]).\nThe space of gradient configurations is denoted by \u2126\u2207. The measurable structure on the space \u2126\u2207 is given by \u03c3-algebra\nF\u2207 := \u03c3({\u03b7b | b \u2208 L\u20d7}). Let T \u2207\u039b be the sigma-algebra of gradient configurations outside of the finite volume \u039b is generated by all gradient variables outside of \u039b and the relative height-difference on the boundary of \u039b.\nFor nearest-neighboring interaction potential \u03a6 = (\u03a6b)b, where b = \u27e8x, y\u27e9 is an edge, define symmetric transfer matrices Qb by\nQb(\u03c9b) = e \u2212\u03a6b(\u03c9b) = exp (\u2212\u03b2V (\u03c9(x)\u2212 \u03c9(y))) . (1.1)\nSuch potential \u03a6 is called a gradient interaction potential. Following [12] and [13] let us give definition of GGM. Define the Markov (Gibbsian) specification as \u03b3\u03a6\u039b (\u03c3\u039b = \u03c9\u039b|\u03c9) = (Z\u03a6\u039b )(\u03c9)\u22121\n\u220f b\u2229\u039b\u0338=\u2205 Qb(\u03c9b).\nDefinition 1. The gradient Gibbs specification is defined as the family of probability kernels (\u03b3\u2032\u039b)\u039b\u22d0V from ( \u2126\u2207, T \u2207\u039b ) to ( \u2126\u2207,F\u2207 ) such that\u222b\nF (\u03c1)\u03b3\u2032\u039b(d\u03c1 | \u03b6) = \u222b F (\u2207\u03c6)\u03b3\u03a6\u039b (d\u03c6 | \u03c9)\nfor all bounded F\u2207-measurable functions F , where \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 is any height-configuration with \u2207\u03c9 = \u03b6. Definition 2. A probability measure \u03bd on \u2126\u2207 is called a GGM if it satisfies the DLR equation\u222b \u03bd(d\u03b6)F (\u03b6) = \u222b \u03bd(d\u03b6) \u222b \u03b3\u2032\u039b(d\u03b6\u0303 | \u03b6)F (\u03b6\u0303)\nfor every finite \u039b \u2282 V and for all bounded functions F on \u2126\u2207.\nNow we define boundary laws (see [20]) which allow to describe the subset of G(\u03b3) of all Gibbs measures. Definition 3. \u2022 A family of vectors {lxy}\u27e8x,y\u27e9\u2208L\u20d7 with lxy = (lxy(i) : i \u2208 Z) \u2208 (0,\u221e) Z is called\na boundary law for the transfer operators {Qb}b\u2208L\u20d7 if for each \u27e8x, y\u27e9 \u2208 L\u20d7 there exists a constant cxy > 0 such that the consistency equation\nlxy(i) = cxy \u220f\nz\u2208\u2202x\\{y} \u2211 j\u2208Z Qzx(i, j)lzx(j) (1.2)\nholds for every i \u2208 Z.\n\u2022 A boundary law l is said to be normalisable if and only if\u2211 i\u2208Z ( \u220f z\u2208\u2202x \u2211 j\u2208Z Qzx(i, j)lzx(j) ) < \u221e (1.3)\nat any x \u2208 V .\n\u2022 A boundary law is called q-height-periodic (or q-periodic) if lxy(i + q) = lxy(i) for every oriented edge \u27e8x, y\u27e9 \u2208 L\u20d7 and each i \u2208 Z.\nIt is known that there is an one-to-one correspondence between normalisable boundary laws and tree-indexed Markov chains [20].\nIn [8], [9], [10], [12] some non-normalisable boundary laws are used to give GGM. For \u039b \u2282 V , fix a site w \u2208 \u039b. If the boundary law l is assumed to be q-height-periodic, then\ntake s \u2208 Zq = {0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1} and define probability measure \u03bdw,s on Z{b\u2208L\u20d7|b\u2282\u039b} by\n\u03bdw,s(\u03b7\u039b\u222a\u2202\u039b = \u03b6\u039b\u222a\u2202\u039b)\n= Z\u039bw,s \u220f\ny\u2208\u2202\u039b\nlyy\u039b ( Tq(s+ \u2211 b\u2208\u0393(w,y) \u03b6b) ) \u220f b\u2229\u039b\u0338=\u2205 Qb(\u03b6b),\nwhere Z\u039bw,s is a normalization constant, y\u039b denotes the unique nearest neighbor of y in \u039b, \u0393(w, y) is the unique path from w to y and Tq : Z \u2192 Zq denotes the coset projection.\nTheorem 1. [12] Let (l\u27e8xy\u27e9)\u27e8x,y\u27e9\u2208L\u20d7 be any q-height-periodic boundary law for some gradient interaction potential. Fix any site w \u2208 V and any class label s \u2208 Zq.

If q-height-periodic boundary law and the underlying potential are translation invariant then it is possible to obtain probability measure \u03bd on the gradient space by mixing the pinned gradient measures:\nTheorem 2. [12] Let a q-height-periodic boundary law l and its gradient interaction potential be translation invariant. Let \u039b \u2282 V be any finite connected set and let w \u2208 \u039b be any vertex. Then the measure \u03bd with marginals given by\n\u03bd(\u03b7\u039b\u222a\u2202\u039b = \u03b6\u039b\u222a\u2202\u039b) = Z\u039b \u2211 s\u2208Zq \u220f y\u2208\u2202\u039b l ( s+ \u2211 b\u2208\u0393(w,y) \u03b6b ) \u220f b\u2229\u039b\u0338=\u2205 Q(\u03b6b), (1.5)\nwhere Z\u039b is a normalisation constant, defines a translation invariant GGM on \u2126\u2207.\nThe aim of this paper is to study GGMs of gradient potential constructed by an SOS model with alternating magnetism. By Theorem 2 each q-height-periodic boundary law l, which is independent on edges of tree, defines a translation invariant GGM. We find q-height-periodic boundary laws for this SOS model and use Theorem 2 to construct GGMs corresponding to these laws."

(2.26)\nBy (2.23) for u = w from (2.26) we get\nv = 2\n\u03b8\n( 2 + \u03b82v + 2v2\n2\u03b8(1 + v)\n)2 .\nThat is 4v4 \u2212 2\u03b82(\u03b8 \u2212 2)v3 + (\u03b84 \u2212 4\u03b83 + 8)v2 \u2212 2\u03b82(\u03b8 \u2212 2)v + 4 = 0. (2.27)\nIntroduce \u03be = v + 1\nv > 2.\nThen from (2.27) we get 4\u03be2 \u2212 2\u03b82(\u03b8 \u2212 2)\u03be + \u03b83(\u03b8 \u2212 4) = 0.

Recall \u03b8 (3) c defined by (2.14). A numerical analysis shows that\n\u03be1 > 2, iff \u03b8 > \u03b8(3)c ,\n\u03be2 > 2, iff \u03b8 > 2.\nIf \u03bei > 2 then we denote by v\u0302i and 1/v\u0302i two solutions of v+1/v = \u03bei. Then corresponding u\u0302i can be found from equality 2u\u03022i = \u03b8vi, i.e., denote xi = u\u03022i = \u03b8 2 v\u0302i and x\u0302i = \u03b8 2v\u0302i\n. Thus we obtain the following 4-periodic sequences\n\u03b8 > \u03b8(3)c : . . . , 1, x1, v\u0302\n2 1 , x1, 1, x1, v\u0302 2 1 , x1, 1, . . .\n. . . , 1, x\u03021, v\u0302 \u22122 1 , x\u03021, 1, x\u03021, v\u0302 \u22122 1 , x\u03021, 1, . . .\n(2.29)\n\u03b8 > 2 : . . . , 1, x2, v\u0302\n2 2 , x2, 1, x2, v\u0302 2 2 , x2, 1, . . .\n. . . , 1, x\u03022, v\u0302 \u22122 2 , x\u03022, 1, x\u03022, v\u0302 \u22122 2 , x\u03022, 1, . . .\n(2.30)\nCase u \u0338= w. Using (2.23) and (2.24) (for u \u0338= w) from (2.25) we get\nu+ w = 1 + v\nu+ w = \u03b8 2v+2(1+v2) \u03b8(1+v) . (2.31)\nThus\n1 + v = \u03b82v + 2(1 + v2)\n\u03b8(1 + v) \u21d4 (\u03b8 \u2212 2)(v2 \u2212 \u03b8v + 1) = 0. (2.32)\nThe last equation has infinitely many solutions (i.e. \u2200v > 0) if \u03b8 = 2 and two solutions\nv1,2 = 1\n2 (\u03b8 \u00b1\n\u221a \u03b82 \u2212 4), if \u03b8 \u2265 2. (2.33)\nIf \u03b8 = 2 then for each v > 0 using (2.23) from the first equation of (2.22) (with k = 2) we get\n2u2 \u2212 2(1 + v)u+ v2 + 1 = 0 \u21d4 (u\u2212 1)2 + (u\u2212 v)2 = 0.\nThe last equation has unique solution u = v = 1. For these values we get w = 1 too. If \u03b8 > 2 for a given solution v to find corresponding u and w we use (2.23) and from the first equation of (2.22) we get \u03b8u2 \u2212 \u03b8(1 + v)u+ v2 + 1 = 0. Since v2 + 1 = \u03b8v we have\n\u03b8u2 \u2212 \u03b8(1 + v)u+ \u03b8v = 0 \u21d4 u2 \u2212 (1 + v)u+ v = 0.\nThis has solutions u = 1 and u = v. Similarly, from the third equation of (2.22) we get w = 1 and w = v. Hence solutions (u, v, w) under conditions u \u0338= w, v \u0338= 1 have the form\n(1, v1, v1), (v1, v1, 1), (1, v2, v2), (v2, v2, 1). (2.34)\nGoing back to (2.9) we note that solutions (2.34), with vi defined in (2.33), generate only two distinct sequences\n\u03b8 \u2265 2 : . . . , 1, 1, v21 , v 2 1 , 1, 1, v 2 1 , v 2 1 , 1, 1, v 2 1 , v 2 1 , . . .\n. . . , 1, 1, v22 , v 2 2 , 1, 1, v 2 2 , v 2 2 , 1, 1, v 2 2 , v 2 2 , . . .\n(2.35)\nBy Lemma 3, Remark 1, above obtained solutions and Theorem 2 we get the following result.\nTheorem 5. For the model (1.6) with graph G given in Fig. 1, the number \u03bd4(k, \u03b8) of 4-heightperiodic GGMs (which are NOT 2- and 3-periodic) is given by the following formula\n\u03bd4(2, \u03b8) =  0, if \u03b8 \u2264 2 5, if \u03b8 \u2208 (2, \u03b8(3)c )\n6, if \u03b8 = \u03b8(3)c 8, if \u03b8 > \u03b8(3)c\nRemark 2. Some our results can be generalized for k \u2265 3. For example, if u = 1 and v = w then system (2.22) is reduced to vk+1\u2212 (\u03b8+1)vk +(\u03b8+1)v\u22121 = 0. This equation is very similar to (2.3)."
