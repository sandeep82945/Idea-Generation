The Asteraceae family is a promising source of bioactive compounds, such as the famous Asteraceae plants Tanacetum cinerariifolium (pyrethrin) and Artemisia annua (artemisinin). As a result of our series of phytochemical studies of the subtropical plants, two novel sesquiterpenes, named crossoseamines A and B in this study (1 and 2, respectively), one undescribed coumarin-glucoside (3), and eighteen known compounds (4–21) were isolated from the aerial part of Crossostephium chinense (Asteraceae). The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR experiments (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY), IR spectrum, circular dichroism spectrum (CD), and high-resolution electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (HR-ESI–MS). All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against Leishmania major, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei (gambiense and rhodesiense), and human lung cancer cell line A549 because of the high demand for the discovery of new drug leads to overcome the present side effects and emerging drug-resistant strains. As a result, the new compounds (1 and 2) showed significant activities against A549 (IC50, 1: 3.3± 0.3; 2: 12.3± 1.0 μg/mL), L. major (IC50, 1: 6.9± 0.6; 2: 24.9± 2.2 μg/mL), and P. falciparum (IC50, 1: 12.1 ± 1.1; 2: 15.6 ± 1.2 μg/mL). 1. conclusions The ethyl acetate extract of C. chinense was intensively fractionated to obtain previously undescribed sesquiterpene-amino acid conjugate crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) and a coumarin glucoside, 6′-O-caffeoyl scopolin (3) together with 18 known compounds (4–21). The plausible biosynthetic pathway of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) is the Michael-type reaction of the nitrogen of proline to the eudesmanolide moiety (Figure 7). Crossoseamine A (1) showed potent activity against A549 and L. major, while the introduction of the hydroxy function on position 8 (crossoseamine B (2)) decreased the activity. The polarity and/or functionality of eudesmane moiety may be necessary for the cytotoxicity against these targets. Among the evaluated compounds, chrysosplenol D (6) showed substantial toxicity for all tested organisms, probably by general toxicity, and has already been reported previously [21,25,56]. While some flavonoids (7–9) and caffeic acid derivatives (14) are relatively specific for both Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, compounds (11–13, 15, 18) showed specificity for Plasmodium. As a result, these compounds have the potential to treat human cancer, leishmaniasis, malaria, and trypanosomiasis.
