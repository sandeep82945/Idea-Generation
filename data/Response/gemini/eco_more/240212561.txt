1. **Investigate the impact of different waiting time guarantee policies on customer satisfaction and loyalty.** For example, one could compare the effects of a policy that guarantees a maximum waiting time of 30 minutes to a policy that guarantees a maximum waiting time of 15 minutes.
2. **Develop heuristic algorithms for solving the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting Time Guarantees.** This would be useful for solving larger instances of the problem than can be solved with the exact algorithms presented in the paper.
3. **Extend the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting Time Guarantees to consider other factors, such as patient preferences and provider availability.** This would make the model more realistic and applicable to a wider range of settings.
4. **Develop a decision support system for appointment scheduling that incorporates the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting Time Guarantees.** This would make it easier for healthcare providers to implement the model in their own settings.
5. **Conduct a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting Time Guarantees in reducing patient waiting times and improving customer satisfaction.** This would provide empirical evidence of the benefits of the model.
