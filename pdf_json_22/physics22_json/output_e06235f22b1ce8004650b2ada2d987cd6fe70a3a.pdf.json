            "text": "Anyonic statistics revealed by the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip for fractional excitations\nT. Jonckheere, J. Rech, B. Gre\u0301maud, T. Martin Aix Marseille Univ, Universite\u0301 de Toulon, CNRS, CPT, Marseille, France\n(Dated: December 1, 2023)\nThe fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is known to host anyons, quasiparticles whose statistics is intermediate between bosonic and fermionic. We show here that Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferences between excitations created by narrow voltage pulses on the edge states of a FQHE system at low temperature show a direct signature of anyonic statistics. The width of the HOM dip is universally fixed by the thermal time scale, independently of the intrinsic width of the excited fractional wavepackets. This universal width can be related to the anyonic braiding of the incoming excitations with thermal fluctuations created at the quantum point contact. We show that this effect could be realistically observed with periodic trains of narrow voltage pulses using current experimental techniques.\nFractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is an important example of a many-body system where electronic correlations have an essential impact.[1] When a fraction \u03bd of the states of the lowest Landau level is occupied, the system reaches a state which cannot be understood without electronic interactions. The well-known Laughlin wavefunction describes the highly correlated ground state of the FQHE when \u03bd = 1/(2n + 1) for n integer. The fundamental excitations of the FQHE are anyons: quasiparticles which bear a fractional charge, and obey fractional statistics.[2, 3] In a given Laughlin state, when two anyons are exchanged, the system acquires a phase exp(i\u03c0\u03bd), to be contrasted with the \u00b11 of bosonic/fermionic statistics. More complex fractions exist, potentially hosting non-Abelian anyons, relevant for quantum computing applications.[4]\nA fractional charge e/3 was experimentally observed for the Laughlin state with \u03bd = 1/3 more than twenty years ago, by measuring the shot noise across a quantum point contact (QPC) in the tunneling regime, where individual fractional quasiparticles can tunnel between opposite edge states.[5\u20138] Fractional statistics, however, has proved more difficult to observe. Only very recently, two different experiments have been able to clearly show specific signatures directly associated with the fractional statistics of anyonic quasiparticles.[9, 10]\nElectronic transport in FQHE occurs only through chiral edge modes, traveling along the boundary. These can be used as 1d electron beams enabling to realize transport experiments inspired from quantum optics, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference experiment, where two identical photons are sent with a controlled time delay on a beam-splitter.[11] The electronic counterpart was performed a few years ago in the integer QHE, where current correlations were shown to give precious information on the electronic wavepackets and the many-body electronic state.[12\u201315] Recently, twoparticle time-domain intereferences were obtained in the FQHE, demonstrating that quasiparticles keep their coherence allowing for time-domain interference.[16]\nIn this work, we show that using narrow periodic pulses of voltage, periodically exciting fractional charges, and measuring the HOM noise at the output of a QPC, one obtains a signal which is directly related to the anyonic statistics. To this aim, we first explain the unique properties of the time-dependent tunneling current at a QPC when a single fractional quasiparticle is incident, which are associated with braiding of the fractional quasiparticle with the thermal anyonic excitations occurring at the QPC. Our quantitative predictions, obtained with perturbative calculations performed using the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green function formalism, could be checked with current experimental techniques, providing a relatively easy path for the study of fractional statistics. We consider a FQH bar, with Laughlin filling factor \u03bd = 1/(2n + 1) for n integer, and describe the edge states in terms of the bosonic Hamiltonian H0 = vF 4\u03c0 \u222b dx \u2211 \u00b5=R,L(\u2202x\u03d5\u00b5)\n2 where \u03d5R/L are the bosonic fields describing the right-/left-moving edge states propagating with velocity vF .[17] A bosonization identity, \u03c8R/L(x) = UR/L/(2\u03c0a)e \u00b1ikF xe\u2212i \u221a \u03bd\u03d5R/L(x), relates the quasiparticle (QP) operator to the bosonic field, with a a small cutoff parameter a and UR/L a Klein factor. The presence of a QPC (at x = 0), in the weak backscattering regime, allows the tunneling of individual QP of charge e\u2217 = \u03bde between the two edges. This is described by the tunneling Hamiltonian HT = \u0393\u03c8 \u2020 R(0)\u03c8L(0)+H.c. See Fig. 1 for a sketch of the setup. To better understand the importance of the anyonic statistics for tunneling at the QPC, let us first consider the somewhat simpler situation where a single QP of charge e\u2217 is incoming on the R edge. To this aim, when computing physical quantities (current, etc.), we replace the ground state by a prepared state |\u03c6\u27e9 = \u03c8\u2020R(\u2212x0,\u2212T )|0\u27e9 where a single QP has been added at an initial time \u2212T < 0. Without loss of generality, we choose x0 = vFT , such that the QP reaches the QPC at t = 0. We now proceed with the perturbative calculation of the mean tunneling current \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 at the QPC, using standard Keldysh Green function forar X iv :2 20 7. 07 17 2v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n3 0\nN ov\n2 02\n3\n2 VR(t)\nVL(t)\ne *\ne *\nIT\n\u03d5R\n\u03d5L\nFQHEFQHE\nFIG. 1. The setup: a Hall bar in the Laughlin series, whose edge states are described by the bosonic fields \u03d5R and \u03d5L, with a QPC at position x = 0. The right- and left-moving edges are driven respectively by the time-dependent potential VR(t) and VL(t), resulting in a tunneling current IT in between edge.\nmalism. The tunneling current operator is given by IT (t) = ie\n\u2217(\u0393\u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8L(0, t) \u2212 H.c.). To lowest order in \u0393, the mean current is given by [18]\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u2212 i\n2\n\u222b dt\u2032 \u2211 \u03b7,\u03b7\u2032 \u03b7\u2032 \u2329 \u03c6 \u2223\u2223\u2223TK IT (t\u03b7)HT (t\u2032\u03b7\u2032)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6\u232a ,\n(1)\nwhere TK is time-ordering along the Keldysh contour, and \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 = \u00b1 are Keldysh indices.

G is the quasiparticle Green function (identical for right and left movers), directly obtained from its bosonic counterpart, with \u03b2 the inverse temperature. Note that the power \u03bd leads to a slow decay of this Green function at long times since \u03bd < 1, up to the thermal time scale \u03c4Th = \u210f\u03b2. In the limit of vanishing cutoff a \u2192 0, it is easy to check that G(t)/G(\u2212t) = exp(\u2212sign(t) \u00d7 i\u03c0\u03bd). This directly arises from the nontrivial exchange properties of anyonic quasiparticles, exploiting their linear dispersion along\nthe edge.[18] It follows that the last factor of Eq. (2) can be simplified as\nG(\u2212t\u2032)G(t) G(t\u2032)G(\u2212t) = exp\n( \u2212i \u03bd \u222b t t\u2032 d\u03c4 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c4) ) . (4)\nThe current can thus be written as \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = 2ie\u2217\u03932 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 sin ( 2\u03c0\u03bd \u222b t t\u2032 d\u03c4 \u03b4(\u03c4) ) \u00d7 [ G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 \u2212 G(t\u2032 \u2212 t)2 ] . (5)\nOne readily sees from Eq. (5) that the tunneling current has remarkable properties, which are unique to fractional charge tunneling in the FQHE.[18] It is of course zero for t < 0, i.e. before the arrival of the e\u2217 QP. On the other hand, for t > 0, the t\u2032 integration is restricted to the negative portion of the real axis, and the current is simply proportional to sin(2\u03c0\u03bd). This, in turn leads to a non-zero current even for a time t taken long after the e\u2217 QP has reached the QPC position, as a consequence of the slow decay in time of the Green function G(t\u2212 t\u2032). The mean current thus remains finite for a long time interval, set by the thermal time scale \u03c4Th. We emphasize that this is in sharp contrast with the case of an incoming electron charge, since even for fractional edge states, the mean tunneling current is non-zero only at the specific time that the electron arrives at the QPC. [18] This nontrivial behavior of the tunneling current after the arrival of a single QP of charge e\u2217 can be directly linked to the anyonic statistics of the fractional excitations. The phase 2\u03c0\u03bd occurring for t\u2032 < 0 < t can be understood qualitatively from Eq. (1) by considering the time-ordering of the right-moving edge operators (\u03c8R, \u03c8\u2020R). From the expressions of |\u03c6\u27e9, IT and HT , one readily sees that the average current in Eq. (1) involves a contribution of the form T\u03c8R(0)\u03c8 \u2020 R(t)\u03c8R(t\n\u2032)\u03c8\u2020R(0), as the prepared state ensures that the QP reaches the QPC at time 0. For t > 0 and t\u2032 < 0, the time ordering thus requires to bring both \u03c8R(0) and \u03c8 \u2020 R(0) between the operators at t and t\u2032, yielding twice a phase \u03c0\u03bd. On the opposite, if t and t\u2032 have the same sign, one can easily see that the exchanges needed for the ordering now contribute with opposite phases, thus giving a zero net result. An equivalent point of view, developed in Refs. [19\u201321] is to see the expression of Eq. (1) as the interference between a process where a quasiparticle/quasihole (QP/QH) excitation is created at the location of the QPC at time t\u2032, before the passage of the e\u2217 QP, and another where the QP/QH is created at time t, after the passage of the e\u2217 QP. In both points of view, the tunneling current is non-zero because of the braiding of the incoming fractional QP with a thermal QP/QH excitation created at the QPC. This braiding results from the anyonic statistics, giving a nontrivial phase \u03c0\u03bd when two quasiparticles are exchanged.\nWe now show that the same tunneling current, with the same signature of fractional statistics, can be obtained by\n3 applying a short voltage pulse which excites a fractional average charge. This is a highly nontrivial statement, as it is known that such a voltage pulse does not create the same many-body state as the one obtained by adding a single quasiparticle on top of the ground state.[22]\nThe presence of an external time-dependent voltage bias leads to an extra term in the total Hamiltonian, of the form HV = \u2212 2e \u221a \u03bd\nvF V (x, t)\u2202x\u03d5R. The voltage can\nbe taken into account by using the following transformation: \u03d5(x, t) = \u03d5(0)(x, t) + e \u221a \u03bd \u222b t \u2212\u221edt \u2032 V (x\u2032, t\u2032) , with x\u2032 = x\u2212vF (t\u2212 t\u2032) and where \u03d5(0)(x, t) is the equilibrium bosonic field.[22] Assuming that the voltage is applied on\na long contact, we can simplify \u222b t \u2212\u221edt\n\u2032V (vF (t \u2032 \u2212 t), t\u2032) \u2243\u222b t\n\u2212\u221edt \u2032V (t\u2032). This leads to a time-dependent tunneling amplitude at the QPC \u0393(t) = \u0393exp[ie\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\n\u2032V (t\u2032)]. Proceeding with the perturbative calculation of the tunneling current, one gets [18]\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = 2ie\u2217\u03932 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 sin ( e\u2217 \u222b t t\u2032 dt\u2032\u2032V (t\u2032\u2032) ) \u00d7 [ G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 \u2212 G(t\u2032 \u2212 t)2 ] . (6)\nOne can thus readily recover the result of Eq. (5), provided that one chooses a voltage pulse V (t) = 2\u03c0e \u03b4(t), which excites a mean charge e\u2217 = \u03bde. The tunneling current \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 is the same for a single QP of charge e\u2217 arriving on the QPC, or when applying a very short voltage pulse V (t) exciting a mean charge e\u2217.\nThis picture is further generalized by considering a voltage V (t) composed of several short pulses of charge e\u2217. There, the phase of the sine term counts the number of fractional charges e\u2217 that have passed through the QPC, each of them contributing a phase 2\u03c0\u03bd. This then has important consequences for the tunneling current. For example, at filling factor \u03bd = 1/3, when two short fractionally charged pulses arrive at the QPC with a time delay much smaller than the thermal scale, the main contribution to the current in Eq. (6) comes with a factor sin(4\u03c0/3) < 0, making it negative. Fig. 2 shows the current for an ensemble of short pulses (each with a charge e\u2217, and a width \u03b4t \u226a \u03b2). The dashed lines show the arrival times of the pulses at the QPC. We see that the current decreases slowly in absolute value after each pulse reaches the QPC, reflecting the slow decrease of the QP Green function G. More interestingly, the value of the current depends on the history of the pulses applied at earlier times. In particular, as argued above, the current can be negative when two pulses arrive at closely separated times (e.g. for t between 0.2 and 0.4\u03b2). The inset of Fig. 2 shows the equivalent picture when similar pulses, but carrying a charge e rather than e\u2217, are incident on the QPC. There, the current is non-zero only when the pulse reaches the QPC, with no effect from earlier pulses. Note that the same expression for the tunneling current, Eq. (6), allows one to describe a random stream of pulses,\n-0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 -0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nt\n<IT (t)>\nFIG. 2. Mean current \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 (in units of e/\u03b2) as a function of t (in units of \u03b2) corresponding to Eq. (6) with \u03bd = 1/3, for a random ensemble of short pulses of width \u03b2/100, each carrying a charge e/3. The arrival times at the QPC are shown as dashed vertical lines (pulses for t < \u22120.4\u03b2 are not shown). Inset: same figure for pulses carrying a charge e.\nrecovering known results for the collision between two Poissonian streams of charges e*.[23] While the use of voltage pulses is routinely performed, the measurement of time-dependent currents still constitutes an experimental challenge in quantum Hall junctions. We now propose a simpler alternative, within grasp of modern experiments, in order to reveal the effect of anyonic statistics. This relies on the measurement of the HOM noise, i.e. the current correlations resulting from two individual voltage pulses of fractional charge colliding at the QPC with a controllable time delay. Let us first consider two narrow pulses of charge e\u2217, incoming on the two inputs of the QPC. The tunneling current noise is defined as\nS(t, t\u2032) = \u2329 TK \u03b4IT (t \u2212) \u03b4IT (t \u2032+) \u232a , (7)\nwith \u03b4IT (t) = IT (t)\u2212\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9, and \u00b1 are Keldysh indices. The HOM noise is the zero-frequency tunneling noise, when two pulses are incident on the QPC with a given time delay \u03b4t. It serves as a measure of the interference between the colliding excitations at the QPC. It can be written as [18]\nSHOM (\u03b4t) = 1\n2SHBT \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dtdt\u2032 G(t\u2032 \u2212 t)2\n\u00d7 {cos [2\u03c0\u03bdf\u03b4t (t, t\u2032)]\u2212 1} , (8)\nwhere f\u03b4t(t, t \u2032) is 1 if only one of the times t or t\u2032 is in the interval [\u2212\u03b4t/2, \u03b4t/2], and 0 otherwise, and normalization is given by twice the value of the Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) noise SHBT [24]. A very good approximation of Eq. (8) (exact for \u03b4t/\u03b2 \u2192 0), is given by\nSHOM (\u03b4t) \u03b4t\u226a\u03c4Th\u2212\u2192 1\u2212 exp ( \u22122\u03c0\u03bd |\u03b4t|\n\u03b2\n) . (9)\n4 This result shows a behavior typical of a HOM dip for long and short time delays. For very large |\u03b4t|, it saturates to 1 as the two incident charges e\u2217 reach the QPC at very distant times without interfering, therefore reproducing twice the amount of the HBT noise. For \u03b4t = 0, the HOM dip drops all the way to 0, as a result of perfect interference between the two identical incoming charges. This can be understood as a fractional charge injected from the left and another one injected from the right braiding with opposite phases with the thermal excitations of the QPC. At \u03b4t = 0 these phases cancel exactly. The most important result, however, is the behavior at intermediate \u03b4t: Eq. (9) shows that the width of the HOM dip is \u223c \u03b2, set by the thermal time scale \u03c4Th, independently of the width of the incoming pulses. This is in sharp contrast with the conventional HOM dip, for example between electronic wavepackets in the integer QHE [14, 25], where the dip width is directly proportional to that of the incoming wavepacket. This striking result can be understood from our discussion of the tunneling current above. Indeed, we showed that, as a consequence of anyonic statistics and the braiding with thermal excitations, a single charge e\u2217 reaching the QPC creates a nonzero current up to times \u223c \u03b2 after the tunneling event occurred.\nTwo charges incident on both inputs of the QPC thus interfere up to times set by the thermal time scale, which explains the width of the HOM dip. The observation of such an HOM dip can thus provide a direct proof of the anyonic statistics of the incoming fractional charges. We now show how a realistic periodic voltage bias with frequency \u03c9, sending pulses of charge q e (with non-integer q), can be used to observe the HOM dip of width \u223c \u03b2. For illustrative purposes, we consider a periodic voltage V (t) consisting of Lorentzian pulses, also known as levitons, [26\u201329] but the results are independent of the actual shape of the voltage potential, as long as the pulse width is small compared to \u03b2. We use the Floquet formalism, where the essential ingredients are the coefficients pl, which correspond to the Fourier coefficients of the phase \u03d5(t) = e\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt \u2032VAC(t \u2032) created by the AC part of the time-dependent voltage V (t). The DC part of the voltage leads to a mean charge qe injected per period, with q = e\u2217VDC/\u03c9. We consider that the voltages VR(t) and VL(t), applied on the right and left edge respectively, differ by a time-shift \u03b4t only, so that\nVL(t) = VR(t\u2212 \u03b4t) = VDC \u03c0 \u2211 k\n\u03b7\n\u03b72 + (t/T0 \u2212 k)2 , (10)\nwhere T0 = 2\u03c0/\u03c9 is the period of the drive, and \u03b7 is the finesse.\nFig. 3 shows the normalized HOM noise for a periodic Lorentzian drive, at \u03bd = 1/3, with realistic values for the experimental parameters (frequency \u03c9 = 1 \u00d7 2\u03c0 GHz, and finesse \u03b7 = 0.01).[30] The black dotted line shows\n- T0\n2 -\nT0 4 0 T0 4\nT0 2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\u03a9 = 2\u03c0 GHz\n\u03b7 = 0.01\nq=1/3\n25\n50 100\n250\n\u03b4t\nSHOM\na)\n- T0\n2 -\nT0 4 0\nT0 4\nT0 2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\u03a9 = 2\u03c0 GHz\n\u03b7 = 0.01\nT = 25 mK\n\u03b4t\nSHOM\n1/3\n2/3\n0.9\n1.0\nb)\nFIG. 3.

The thick dashed line shows the theoretical prediction of Eq. (9) for two infinitely narrow pulses at T =25mK. The dotted curve shows the shape of V (t) over one period.\nthe shape of the narrow Lorentzian pulse over one period. The full curves show the HOM dip as a function of the time-shift \u03b4t. In panel a), the average charge per pulse is fixed to qe = e/3, and the temperature T is varied from 250mK down to 25mK. At T = 25mK, the hierarchy of the different time scales is thus: pulse width (\u223c 20ps) \u226a thermal time-scale (\u223c 300ps) < period (\u223c 1000ps). One can readily see that, while the width of the HOM dip is close to that of the Lorentzian pulse at T =250mK, it significantly increases as the temperature is lowered, ultimately being much larger at T =25mK. We consider, in panel b), a fixed temperature T =25mK, and an injected charge per period which varies from qe = e down to qe = e/3. There, the width of the HOM dip is similar to that of the incoming pulse for q = 1 (corresponding to the injection of a full electron per period on each edge), before increasing substantially as q is lowered, recovering a wide HOM dip for q = 1/3. The thick dashed line\n5 corresponds to the analytical prediction of Eq. (9) for T = 25mK. This shows a very good agreement with the full numerical result obtained for q = 1/3, with only a small underestimation of the width of the dip associated with the assumption of infinitely sharp pulses.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the anyonic statistics of quasiparticles in the FQHE has direct consequences on the HOM interference of excitations created by narrow voltage pulses. Contrarily to the usual picture, where the width of the HOM dip is trivially related to the temporal extension of the incoming excitations, here it is fixed by the thermal scale, which dominates at low temperature. We have shown how this can be explained by the anyonic braiding of the incoming quasiparticles with thermal excitations naturally occurring at the QPC. Reducing temperature increases the thermal time, which enhances the time scale on which braiding is effective, and thus leads to a wider HOM dip. Our proposal could be realized with current experimental techniques, and could lead to an original and relatively simple way to observe directly the consequences of anyonic statistics in the FQHE. A natural extension of this work would be to consider more exotic fractions like \u03bd = 2/5 or \u03bd = 2/3 [31, 32], or even \u03bd = 5/2, characterized by non-Abelian statistics.[4, 33\u201335].\nWe are grateful to G.

(S1)\nUsing the properties of time ordering, and the linear dispersion along the edge, this can be recast under the simplified form\nGR/L ( x, x\u2032; t\u03b7, t\u2032\u03b7 \u2032 ) = GR/L ( \u03c3\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032\ntt\u2032\n( t\u2212 t\u2032 \u2213 x\u2212 x \u2032\nvF\n)) , (S2)\nwhere \u03c3\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032\ntt\u2032 = sign(t\u2212 t\u2032)(\u03b7 + \u03b7\u2032)/2 + (\u03b7\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7)/2 and\nGR/L(t) = \u2329 \u03c8\u2020R/L(0, t)\u03c8R/L(0, 0) \u232a . (S3)\nInvoking the bosonization identity, this is further reduced as\nGR/L(t) = 1\n2\u03c0a\n\u2329 e i \u221a \u03bd\u03d5\u2020 R/L (0,t) e\u2212i \u221a \u03bd\u03d5R/L(0,0) \u232a = 1\n2\u03c0a e\u03bdGR/L(t), (S4)\nwhere we introduced the bosonic Green function GR/L(t) = \u2329 \u03d5\u2020R/L(0, t)\u03d5R/L(0, 0) \u232a .\nFrom the free Hamiltonian H0, one can readily extract the corresponding Green function for the bosonic modes as\nGR/L(t) = \u2212 log\n sinh ( i \u03c0a\u03b2vF \u2212 \u03c0t \u03b2 ) sinh ( i \u03c0a\u03b2vF )  , (S5)\nso that the quasiparticle Green function ultimately reads\nGR/L(t) = 1\n2\u03c0a\n sinh ( i \u03c0a\u03b2vF ) sinh ( i \u03c0a\u03b2vF \u2212 \u03c0t \u03b2 ) \u03bd (S6)\nOne can easily show that this Green function is identical for right- and left-movers, so that we can safely drop the R/L subscript from this point onward. As anyons obey fractional statistics, they show nontrivial exchange properties which ensure that, at equal time, one has\n\u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8R(x, t) = e \u2212i\u03c0\u03bdSign(x)\u03c8R(x, t)\u03c8 \u2020 R(0, t) (S7)\nMaking use of the linear dispersion along the edge, this is rewritten as\n\u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8R\n( 0, t\u2212 x\nvF\n) = e\u2212i\u03c0\u03bdSign(x)\u03c8R ( 0, t\u2212 x\nvF\n) \u03c8\u2020R(0, t) (S8)\nSince this is valid for any set of parameters (x, t), one can choose x = vF t, without loss of generality. Taking then the quantum average, this yields \u2329\n\u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8R(0, 0) \u232a = e\u2212i\u03c0\u03bdSign(t) \u2329 \u03c8R(0, 0)\u03c8 \u2020 R(0, t) \u232a G(t) = e\u2212i\u03c0\u03bdSign(t)G(\u2212t) (S9)\nIt follows that the value of the ratio G(t)/G(\u2212t) can be viewed as a direct consequence of the exchange statistics of anyons.\n2 COMPUTING THE TUNNELING CURRENT\nTunneling current when injecting a single quasiparticle\nThe tunneling current operator reads IT (t) = ie \u2217(\u0393\u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8L(0, t)\u2212H.c.). Here, we consider the situation where a single quasiparticle is incoming along the right edge, described by a prepared state of the form |\u03c6\u27e9 = \u03c8\u2020R(\u2212x0,\u2212T )|0\u27e9. To lowest order in \u0393, the mean current is thus given by\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u2212 i\n2\n\u222b dt\u2032 \u2211 \u03b7,\u03b7\u2032 \u03b7\u2032 \u2329 \u03c6 \u2223\u2223\u2223TK IT (t\u03b7)HT (t\u2032\u03b7\u2032)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6\u232a\n= e\u2217\n2\n\u222b dt\u2032 \u2211 \u03f5,\u03f5\u2032 \u2211 \u03b7,\u03b7\u2032 \u03f5\u03b7\u2032\u27e80|TK \u03c8R(\u2212x0,\u2212T \u2212) ( \u0393\u03c8\u2020R(0, t \u03b7)\u03c8L(0, t \u03b7) )(\u03f5)\n\u00d7 ( \u0393\u03c8\u2020R(0, t \u2032\u03b7\u2032)\u03c8L(0, t \u2032\u03b7\u2032) )(\u03f5\u2032) \u03c8\u2020R(\u2212x0,\u2212T +)|0\u27e9 (S10)\nwhere \u03f5 = \u00b1 is used to include the Hermitian conjugated terms, such that for \u03f5 = +, one has for any operator O, O(+) = O while for \u03f5 = \u2212, one has O(\u2212) = O\u2020.\nHere, TK ensures the time-ordering along the Keldysh contour, and \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 = \u00b1 are Keldysh indices. Note that we consider the injection of QP to have happened in the distant past. The Kelsdysh indices added to the times \u2212T have been chosen to ensure that the \u03c8R(\u2212x0,\u2212T \u2212) and \u03c8\u2020R(\u2212x0,\u2212T +) operators remain in the same position after time ordering, independently of the values of t and t\u2032, for T large enough. In particular, keeping in mind that x0 = vFT (corresponding to a quasiparticle reaching the QPC at t = 0), this allows us to simplify some of the resulting Green functions as\nG(\u2212x0, 0;\u2212T \u2212, t\u03b7) = G(\u2212t) (S11) G(0,\u2212x0; t\u03b7,\u2212T +) = G(t), (S12)\nindependently of \u03b7 and t, provided that t\u226a T . Using the bosonized form of the quasiparticle operators, we have\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u03932 e\u2217\n2\n\u222b dt\u2032 \u2211 \u03f5 \u2211 \u03b7,\u03b7\u2032 \u03f5\u03b7\u2032 [ G ( \u03c3\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 tt\u2032 (t\u2212 t \u2032) )]2 (G(\u2212t\u2032)G(t) G(t\u2032)G(\u2212t) )\u03f5 (S13)\nUsing the properties of the Green function derived in Eq. (S9), this then becomes \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = 2ie\u2217\u03932 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 sin ( 2\u03c0\u03bd \u222b t t\u2032 d\u03c4 \u03b4(\u03c4) ) \u00d7 [ G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 \u2212 G(t\u2032 \u2212 t)2 ] (S14)\nChanging the integration variable to \u03c4 = \u2212t\u2032, and using the expression of the Green function, we get:\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u03b8(t)2ie\u2217 \u03932\n(2\u03c0a)2 sin(2\u03c0\u03bd) \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c4 [( sinh(i\u03c0T\u03c40) sinh(\u03c0T (i\u03c40 \u2212 t\u2212 \u03c4) )2\u03bd \u2212 ( sinh(i\u03c0T\u03c40) sinh(\u03c0T (i\u03c40 + t+ \u03c4) )2\u03bd] (S15)\nwhere \u03c40 = a/vF , T = 1/(kB\u03b2) is the temperature, and we use kB = \u210f = 1. Defining the reduced variables \u03b1 = \u03c0T\u03c40, u = \u03c0T\u03c4 and z = \u03c0Tt, the first term in the integral can be written as\u222b \u221e\n0\ndu\n( sinh(i\u03b1)\nsinh(i\u03b1\u2212 z \u2212 u)\n)2\u03bd = \u222b \u221e 0 du ( ei\u03b1 \u2212 e\u2212i\u03b1 \u2212e\u2212i\u03b1ez 1 1\u2212 e2i\u03b1e\u22122ze\u22122u )2\u03bd e\u22122\u03bd u (S16)\n= ( e\u2212z ( 1\u2212 e2i\u03b1 ))2\u03bd \u222b \u221e 0 du ( 1\u2212 e2i\u03b1e\u22122ze\u22122u )\u22122\u03bd e\u22122\u03bd u (S17) = 1\n2\n( e\u2212z ( 1\u2212 e2i\u03b1 ))2\u03bd (1 \u03bd ) 2F1 ( 2\u03bd, \u03bd, \u03bd + 1, e2i\u03b1\u22122z ) (S18)\nwhere 2F1 is the hypergeometric function. Using this result, the current can eventually be recast as \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u03b8(t) 2e\u2217 ( \u0393\n2\u03c0vF \u03c40\n)2 sin(2\u03c0\u03bd)\n2\u03c0\u03bdT e\u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tt (2 sin(\u03c0T\u03c40)) 2\u03bd\n\u00d7 2Im [ 2F1 ( 2\u03bd, \u03bd, \u03bd + 1, e\u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tte\u22122i\u03c0T\u03c40 ) ei\u03c0\u03bd(1\u22122T\u03c40) ] (S19)\n3 Taking then the leading order in the cutoff parameter \u03c40 leads to\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u03b8(t) 2e\u2217 ( \u0393\n2\u03c0vF\n)2 \u03c42\u03bd\u221220 2 sin(\u03c0\u03bd) sin(2\u03c0\u03bd)\n\u03bd e\u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tt(2\u03c0T )2\u03bd\u22121 2F1\n( 2\u03bd, \u03bd, \u03bd + 1, e\u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tt ) (S20)\nWe see that this is a function of 2\u03bd\u03c0T t = 2\u03bd\u03c0t/\u03b2, which implies that the typical length scale for this function is \u223c \u03b2. The behavior of the current in the two limits t \u226a \u03b2 and t \u226b \u03b2 is obtained by using the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric function:\n2F1 ( 2\u03bd, \u03bd, \u03bd + 1, e\u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tt ) =\n{ \u03bd \u0393(\u03bd) 2\n\u0393(2\u03bd) sin(\u03c0\u03bd) sin(2\u03c0\u03bd) \u2212 \u03bd 1\u22122\u03bd\n( 1\u2212 e\u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tt ) t\u226a \u03b2\n1 + 2\u03bd 2 \u03bd+1e \u22122\u03bd\u03c0Tt t\u226b \u03b2\n. (S21)\nTunneling current when injecting a single electron\nIt is instructive to repeat the same kind of derivation, only this time considering the situation where a single electron is incoming along the right edge. The prepared state now takes the form |\u03c6\u27e9 = \u03a8\u2020R(\u2212x0,\u2212T )|0\u27e9, where the electron operator \u03a8R satisfies the bosonization identity \u03a8R(x) = UR 2\u03c0ae ikF xe \u2212i 1\u221a \u03bd \u03d5R(x).\nFollowing a similar derivation to the one above, one obtains instead of Eq. (S13), the following expression for the tunneling current\n\u27e8IT (t)\u27e9 = \u03932 e\u2217\n2\n\u222b dt\u2032 \u2211 \u03b7,\u03b7\u2032 \u03f5\u03b7\u2032 [ G ( \u03c3\u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 tt\u2032 (t\u2212 t \u2032) )]2 [(G(\u2212t\u2032)G(t) G(t\u2032)G(\u2212t) )1/\u03bd \u2212 ( G(t\u2032)G(\u2212t) G(\u2212t\u2032)G(t) )1/\u03bd] (S22)\nFrom the properties of the quasiparticle Green function, Eq. (S9), one readily sees that for t \u0338= 0( G(\u2212t\u2032)G(t) G(t\u2032)G(\u2212t) )1/\u03bd = exp ( \u2212i \u222b t t\u2032 d\u03c4 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c4) ) = 1, (S23)\nso that the tunneling current vanishes at all times t \u0338= 0 and is nonzero only at the specific time that the electron reaches the QPC.\nTunneling current in the presence of a time-dependent voltage\nIn the presence of a voltage bias, the tunneling part of the Hamiltonian can be written as\nHT (t) = \u0393 exp\n[ ie\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 V (t\u2032) ] \u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8L(0, t) + H.c.

The tunneling current operator now reads\nIT (t) = ie \u2217 ( \u0393 exp [ ie\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 V (t\u2032) ] \u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8L(0, t)\u2212H.c. ) .

(S28)\nwhere the Keldysh summations end up restricting the t\u2032 integral from \u2212\u221e to t.\nCOMPUTING THE NOISE\nGeneral expression\nThe current noise is defined as:\nS(t, t\u2032) = \u2329 TK\u03b4IT (t \u2212) \u03b4IT (t \u2032+) \u232a (S29)\nwith \u03b4IT (t) = IT (t)\u2212 \u27e8IT (t)\u27e9, and \u00b1 are Keldysh indices. In the presence of a voltage bias applied to both edges, the tunneling part of the Hamiltonian can be written as\nHT (t) = \u0393 exp\n[ ie\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 (VR(t \u2032)\u2212 VL(t\u2032)) ] \u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8L(0, t) + H.c. (S30)\nwhere we applied a standard gauge transformation in order to reabsorb the effect of the voltage drives into the tunneling amplitude. In this situation, the tunneling current operator reads\nIT (t) = ie \u2217 ( \u0393 exp [ ie\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 (VR(t \u2032)\u2212 VL(t\u2032)) ] \u03c8\u2020R(0, t)\u03c8L(0, t)\u2212H.c. ) . (S31)\nSubstituting this back into Eq. (S29), one readily obtains, up to lowest order in the tunneling amplitude \u0393\nS(t, t\u2032) = 2\n( e\u2217\u0393\n2\u03c0a\n)2 cos ( e\u2217 \u222b t t\u2032 dt\u2032\u2032(VR(t \u2032\u2032)\u2212 VL(t\u2032\u2032)) ) G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2. (S32)\nIn what follows, we focus on the Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) and the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setups, corresponding respectively to applying a single voltage drive, or to applying both of them.\nHOM noise for two narrow pulses of average charge e\u2217\nWe consider here the case of two infinitely short pulses so that both VR(t) and VL(t) are composed of a single delta function, with a time-shift \u03b4t between them. Focusing on pulses of average charge e\u2217, one can thus write\nVR(t) = 2\u03c0\ne \u03b4\n( t+ \u03b4t\n2\n) VL(t) = 2\u03c0\ne \u03b4\n( t\u2212 \u03b4t\n2\n) . (S33)\nThe cosine factor entering the expression for the noise in Eq. (S32) then simply reduces to either cos(2\u03c0\u03bd) or to 1, depending on the values of t and t\u2032, so that we write it as cos [2\u03c0\u03bdf\u03b4t(t, t \u2032)]. The newly defined function f\u03b4t(t, t \u2032) is 1 if one of the times t or t\u2032 is in the interval [\u2212\u03b4t/2, \u03b4t/2] while the other one is not, and reduces to 0 otherwise. The HOM noise is defined as the zero-frequency noise due to the collision of these two excitations, as a function of the time-interval \u03b4t. Focusing on the zero-frequency contribution, and filtering out the equilibrium thermal noise (by subtracting the value in the absence of voltage drives), one has for the un-normalized HOM noise\nSHOM = S(VR, VL)\u2212 S(0, 0) = 2 ( e\u2217\u0393\n2\u03c0a )2 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dt \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 {cos [2\u03c0\u03bdf\u03b4t(t, t\u2032)]\u2212 1} G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 (S34)\n5 Similarly, one can work out the expression for the corresponding noise when only one of the drives is present. The resulting HBT noise reads\nSHBT = S(VR, 0)\u2212 S(0, 0) = 2 ( e\u2217\u0393\n2\u03c0a )2 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dt \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 [ cos ( 2\u03c0\u03bd 1\u2212 sign(t\u00d7 t\u2032) 2 ) \u2212 1 ] G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 (S35)\nThe standard HOM noise ratio is then defined as the ratio of the un-normalized HOM noise to twice the HBT noise, so that\nSHOM (\u03b4t) = SHOM 2SHBT\n=\n\u222b dtdt\u2032 {cos [2\u03c0\u03bdf\u03b4t(t, t\u2032)]\u2212 1} e2\u03bdG(t \u2032\u2212t)\n2 \u222b dtdt\u2032 [ cos ( 2\u03c0\u03bd 1\u2212sign(t\u00d7t\n\u2032) 2\n) \u2212 1 ] e2\u03bdG(t\u2032\u2212t)\n(S36)\nSubstituting the actual value of f\u03b4t(t, t \u2032), this can be further rewritten as\nSHOM (\u03b4t) =\n\u222b |\u03b4t| 0 dt \u222b\u221e 0 dt\u2032 [ e2\u03bdG(t+t \u2032) + e2\u03bdG(\u2212t\u2212t \u2032) ]\n\u222b\u221e 0 dt \u222b\u221e 0 dt\u2032 [ e2\u03bdG(t+t\u2032) + e2\u03bdG(\u2212t\u2212t\u2032) ] = Re [\u222b |\u03b4t| 0 dt \u222b\u221e 0 dt\u2032e2\u03bdG(t+t \u2032) ]\nRe [\u222b\u221e\n0 dt \u222b\u221e 0 dt\u2032e2\u03bdG(t+t\u2032) ] = 1\u2212 Re [I (\u03b4)]\nRe [I (0)] (S37)\nwhere we introduced\nI (\u03b4) = \u222b \u221e 0 dz z ( sinh(i\u03b1) sinh(i\u03b1\u2212 z \u2212 \u03b4) )2\u03bd (S38)\nwith the reduced variable \u03b4 = \u03c0 |\u03b4t| /\u03b2, and the infinitesimal \u03b1 = \u03c0\u03c40/\u03b2. This integral can be worked out as\nI (\u03b4) = \u22121 4\n( 1\u2212 e2i\u03b1 )2\u03bd e\u22122\u03bd\u03b4\u2202\u03b3\n[ 1\n\u03bd + \u03b3 2F1\n( 2\u03bd, \u03bd + \u03b3; \u03bd + \u03b3 + 1; e2i\u03b1e\u22122\u03b4 )] \u03b3=0\n(S39)\nwhere one clearly sees that for \u03b4 \u226a 1, the exponential prefactor dominates, so that\nI (\u03b4) \u2243 \u03b4\u226a1\ne\u22122\u03bd\u03b4I (0) (S40)\nIt follows that, in the regime where |\u03b4t|/\u03b2 \u2192 0, one has\nSHOM (\u03b4t) \u2212\u2192 |\u03b4t|/\u03b2\u21920\n1\u2212 e\u22122\u03c0\u03bd |\u03b4t| \u03b2 (S41)\nHOM noise for two narrow pulses of average charge qe\nThe previous results can be easily extended to the case of pulses carrying a different charge. We now define\nVR(t) = 2\u03c0q\n\u03bde \u03b4\n( t+ \u03b4t\n2\n) VL(t) = 2\u03c0q\n\u03bde \u03b4\n( t\u2212 \u03b4t\n2\n) . (S42)\nFollowing the lines of the previous calculation, one can similarly obtain an expression for the HOM noise ratio as\nSHOM (\u03b4t) =\n\u222b dtdt\u2032 {cos [2\u03c0qf\u03b4t(t, t\u2032)]\u2212 1} e2\u03bdG(t \u2032\u2212t)\n2 \u222b dtdt\u2032 [ cos ( 2\u03c0q 1\u2212sign(t\u00d7t\n\u2032) 2\n) \u2212 1 ] e2\u03bdG(t\u2032\u2212t)\n(S43)\nInterestingly, while the resulting integrals are finite for different domains in time, they always contain a prefactor cos(2\u03c0q) \u2212 1. For q /\u2208 Z, this prefactor simplifies between numerator and denominator, leaving us with the same expression as Eq. (S37), independently of q. This, however, is specific to the very short pulse situation, as a finite extent leads to slightly different contributions for the numerator and denominator, which depend on q in a nontrivial way.\n6 HOM noise in the Floquet formalism\nThe applied voltages on the right and left edges are now given by periodic Lorentzian pulses. They are identical except for a time-shift \u03b4t, so that\nVL(t) = VR(t\u2212 \u03b4t) = VDC \u03c0 \u2211 k\n\u03b7\n\u03b72 + (t/T0 \u2212 k)2 (S44)\nIn the Floquet formalism, the essential ingredients are the coefficients pl, which are the Fourier components of the accumulated phase \u03d5(t) = e\u2217 \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt \u2032VAC(t \u2032) created by the AC part of the time-dependent voltage. In practice, it is convenient to introduce the time-dependent voltage Vdiff(t) = VR(t)\u2212VL(t) which naturally appears in the expression of the noise.\nStarting back from the general expression of Eq. (S32), and inserting the pl coefficients associated with a generic drive V (t) (this allows us to replace V with VR, VL or Vdiff), one can write\nS(t, t\u2032) = 2\n( e\u2217\u0393\n2\u03c0a\n)2 cos [ e\u2217 \u222b t t\u2032 dt\u2032\u2032V (t\u2032\u2032) ] G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2\n=\n( e\u2217\u0393\n2\u03c0a )2 \u2211 l,m p\u2217l pm ( eie \u2217VDC(t\u2212t\u2032)eil\u03c9te\u2212im\u03c9t \u2032 + e\u2212ie \u2217VDC(t\u2212t\u2032)e\u2212im\u03c9teil\u03c9t \u2032 ) G(t\u2212 t\u2032)2 (S45)\nwhere \u03c9 = 2\u03c0T0 is the frequency of the drive. In this Floquet formalism, the zero-frequency noise is now defined as\nS = \u222b d\u03c4 \u222b T0 0 dt\u0304 T0 S ( t\u0304+ \u03c4 2 , t\u0304\u2212 \u03c4 2 ) (S46)\nwhich becomes S = \u222b d\u03c4 \u222b T0 0 dt\u0304 T0 ( e\u2217\u0393 2\u03c0a )2 \u2211 l,m p\u2217l pm ( eie \u2217VDC\u03c4eil\u03c9(t\u0304+ \u03c4 2 )e\u2212im\u03c9(t\u0304\u2212 \u03c4 2 ) + e\u2212ie \u2217VDC\u03c4e\u2212im\u03c9(t\u0304+ \u03c4 2 )eil\u03c9(t\u0304\u2212 \u03c4 2 ) ) G(\u03c4)2\n= 2\n( e\u2217\u0393\n2\u03c0a )2 \u2211 l |pl|2 \u222b d\u03c4 cos [(l + q)\u03c9\u03c4 ]G(\u03c4)2 (S47)\nwhere we introduced the average charge q = e \u2217VDC \u03c9 injected by the drive over one period.\nIntroducing the coefficients pdiff,l for the voltage difference Vdiff(t), as well as the coefficients pL,l and pR,l corresponding to VL(t) and VR(t) applied individually, and noticing that VR,DC = VL,DC = q\u03c9 e\u2217 , while Vdiff,DC = 0, one finally has for the HOM noise ratio\nSHOM (\u03b4t) = SHOM 2SHBT =\n\u2211 l F (pdiff,l, 0)\u2212 |\u0393(\u03bd)|\n2\u2211 l [F (pL,l, q) + F (pR,l, q)]\u2212 2 |\u0393(\u03bd)| 2 (S48)\nwith\nF (pl, q) = |pl|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u0393(\u03bd + i l + q2\u03c0\u03b8 )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 cosh( l + q2\u03b8 )\n(S49)\nand \u03b8 = kBT/\u210f\u03c9 is the reduced temperature. Note that this expression is very general and can describe any kind of periodic potentials, provided that one uses the correct corresponding expressions of the pl coefficients."
