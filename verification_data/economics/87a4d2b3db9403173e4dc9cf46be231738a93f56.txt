"Nevertheless, similar results on ageadjustement would be expected for similar population health metrics such as life expectancy or mortality. Regarding the inputs, health expenditure is one of the most commonly considered when estimating health systems efficiency. This indicator itself can depend on several other factors, including age structure. In fact, it is important to highlight that several efforts have been made to estimate health expenditure by age group [14, 34, 44–46]. Even though proximity to death seems to be the most appropriate approach for health expenditure prediction [16, 18, 47–51], age structure might be a good proxy and summary of proximity to death and could, therefore, be included in efficiency analysis to account for the aforementioned factor."

"Our study demonstrates that despite producing reasonable estimations, the precision of the common approach can be improved by adopting an age-adjusted model. The implications of these results highlight the relevance of the initial step in health efficiency studies in which health expenditure data availability, trustworthiness and detail is assessed, since the choice of these inputs has the potential to improve the quantification."

"Nevertheless, the scope of this work is to open the discussion on how to modulate the effect of environmental variables on health systems efficiency analysis, such as age structure. The differences found in the efficiency scores between models, particularly in the case of countries with lower efficiency scores, must be taken into account when comparing and interpreting the literature on health systems efficiency analysis."

"Given the importance of national health care systems efficiency scores and identifying factors that cause inefficiency to support the design policies to raise health care efficiency, the accuracy of efficiency quantification evidence is key."
