Boderie, Frank J. van Lenthe\nDepartment of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\nCorrespondence: Frank J. van Lenthe, Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands, Tel: \u00fe31 10 070 44220; e-mail: f.vanlenthe@erasmusmc.nl\nBackground: Experiencing financial scarcity taxes cognitive bandwidth. This leaves less capacity to withhold temptations and makes relying on easiest default options more likely. Whether this default option is (un)healthy may depend on the amount of cultural capital acquired during life course. This study examined whether the association between financial scarcity and health behaviours is moderated by cultural capital. Methods: Selfreported data were used from Dutch adults of the 2014-survey of the GLOBE study (N\u00bc2466). Using linear regression analysis, financial strain (no, some, great) and cultural capital (institutionalized, objectivized, incorporated) were related to body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, sports participation, cycling and walking, fruit intake and vegetable consumption. The interaction between financial strain and cultural capital was used to assess moderation. Results: Experiencing some financial strain was associated with a higher BMI (0.7 kg/m2) and less sport participation ( 31.8 min/week). Great financial strain was associated with less sport participation ( 41.4 min/ week). Being in the lowest tertile of cultural capital was associated with a higher BMI (1.3 kg/m2), drinking less alcohol ( 10.0 units/week), less sport participation ( 31.5 min/week) and consuming less fruit ( 2.9 pieces/week). Cultural capital had no significant moderating effect on the relationship between financial strain and these health behaviours. Conclusion: Financial strain and cultural capital seem associated with different health behaviours. Cultural capital had no moderating effect on the relationship between financial strain and different health behaviours. While financial strain and cultural capital could both be entry points for interventions to improve health behaviour, underlying mechanisms require further attention. . . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . . .. . . .. . .. . ."

            "text": "Reducing socioeconomic health inequalities remains a major soci-etal challenge. In the Netherlands, the highly educated live about 7 years longer than the lower educated and the difference in healthy life years is as high as 18 years.1 To reduce these inequalities, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms. A large part can be explained by more unhealthy behaviours among those in lower socioeconomic groups,2 but what determines inequalities in health behaviour is less clear.\nTwo theories increasingly used for understanding socioeconomic inequalities in health behaviour are Mullainathan and Shafir\u2019s3 theory of scarcity and Bourdieus\u2019 theory of cultural capital.4,5 Scarcity means \u2018having less than you feel you need\u2019. Scarcity is a broad concept that can relate financial resources, social isolation or lack of time. The experience of scarcity is thought to capture the mind, may change ways of thinking, and make people less forwardthinking and less self-regulated. The theory implies that scarcity, for example financially, captures a great part of cognitive bandwidth. This then cannot be used for executive functions, such as problem solving and withholding temptations, and may make unhealthy food consumption in widely available obesogenic environments more likely. By scarcity induced less forward-thinking may also imply less engagement in other health behaviours, with health consequents later in life (such as physical activity in leisure time). This explains why previous studies suggest that financial scarcity is associated with unhealthy behaviour.6,7\nCultural capital is a concept conceived by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to explain the unequal scholastic achievement of\nchildren originating from different social classes by relating academic success.5 Cultural capital can be divided in three forms: (i) incorporated cultural capital contains knowledge, skills, habits and preferences obtained through socialization processes. The transmission and accumulation of incorporated cultural capital begins early and more in families with much incorporated cultural capital; (ii) objectivized cultural capital is about material objects and media, such as books, paintings and musical instruments that require cultural abilities to appreciate this and (iii) institutionalized cultural capital is the objectification of cultural capital in the form of academic qualifications and thereby a neutral representation of competences. Since educational attainment is one of the three components of cultural capital, high education does not equal high cultural capital. Evidence suggests that cultural capital is related to healthier behaviour.8\u201312 This is because cultural capital comes with differences in lifestyle, not only in cultural taste, but also in eating habits, sport preferences and other habits related to health.13 The important function in society of this differentiation in lifestyle is showing to which social environment you belong. Hereby health behaviour can be a way to distinguish itself from other social groups. Social advantage cumulating in such groups can help keeping body mass index (BMI) lower in obesogenic environments.14\nFollowing the theory of scarcity, it is expected that when people face difficulties in making ends meet, they fall back on the default option, the easiest way, because this option taxes bandwidth the least.3,6,15 Applied to health behaviour, the default option may often be unhealthy behaviour, including little physical activity, eating easily available unhealthy diets and alcohol consumption. However, the default option possibly depends on the amount of cultural capital.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/33/5/771/7236010 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nLong lasting dispositions internalized over the life course play an important role in the establishment of health behaviours; as such, cultural capital may provide the resources needed to resist temptations for an unhealthy lifestyle.4 Thus, to what extent financial scarcity causes unhealthy behaviour may depend on the amount of cultural capital. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between financial scarcity and different health behaviours and whether cultural capital moderates this association."

The main aim of the GLOBE study is to quantitatively assess mechanisms and factors explaining socioeconomic inequalities in health. The GLOBE study was initiated in 1991 at the Department of Public Health of Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, in cooperation with the municipal health services in the region of Eindhoven, where the study was conducted among residents aged between 15 and 75 years. The study was conducted in Eindhoven and 15 surrounding villages, given its reasonably representative population for the Netherlands in those years. For representativeness of the study sample, a new random sample was included in 2004 and 2014. The GLOBE study contains (postal) surveys and oral interviews with questions about a wide range of indicators of socioeconomic position, material and social deprivation, cultural factors, health outcomes and health-related behaviours. Surveys were executed six times so far between 1991 and 2021. Interviews were held eight times between 1991 and 2012. For this study, we used cross-sectional survey data from the latest (2014) wave of data collection (N\u00bc 2466, after 45.5% response). These participants were representative of the source population in terms of health-related behaviours.16 More detailed information on the objectives, study design and data collection of the Dutch GLOBE study can be found elsewhere.16"

For objectivized cultural capital, the number of books in possession was used [0\u201310 books (1 point), 11\u201325 books (2 points), 26\u2013100 (3 points), 101\u2013200 (4 points) and >200 books (5 points)]. For institutionalized cultural capital the educational level of the respondent and, if available, the educational level of the respondent\u2019s father, mother and partner were asked to capture both institutionalized and family institutionalized cultural capital. More points were given to a higher educational level\n[no education (1 point), primary education (2 points), up to 8 points for bachelor\u2019s till doctoral]. Available answers were summed after which the mean educational level was calculated (table 1).\nThe scores for each of the three forms of cultural capital were divided into quintiles. Subsequently, the quintiles of the different forms of cultural capital were summed. This total score was used to divide the score of cultural capital in tertiles, with tertile 1 including those with the most cultural capital.\nBody weight and health behaviour Body mass index (BMI in kg/m2) was calculated by self-reported weight (kg) and height (cm).6 While BMI is not a health behaviour, we also refer to BMI in our term \u2018health behaviours\u2019 for readability purposes.\nAlcohol intake was measured combining questions about the amount (number of glasses) of alcohol consumed per occasion, as well as the frequency of consumption (drinking days/week) to calculate the average units of alcohol consumed per week.\nSports participation was measured with the standardized and validated Short Questionnaire to Assess Health enhancing physical activity, SQUASH,18 by asking which sports were practiced, up to four, on a weekly basis. For each type of sport, respondents reported the frequency (days per week) and duration (hours and minutes a week), which was reported per thirty minutes activity a week (a score of 1 equals 30 min).\nWalking and cycling were also measured by using the SQUASH questionnaire.18 For walking and cycling in both leisure time and active commute, self-reported frequency (days per week) and duration (hours and minutes per day) were assessed. When hours and/ or minutes were registered but not the number of days, it was assumed that respondents had been active for at least one day.19 The total time spent walking and cycling per thirty minutes a week was calculated by multiplying the amount of days with the amount of time spent a day on walking and cycling.\nFruit and vegetable intake were examined with a food frequency questionnaire. Respondents reported frequency (days per week) of both fruit and vegetable consumption over the past month and indicated the portion size [i.e. number of pieces of fruit (\u00bc100 g), and number of serving spoons (\u00bc50 g) of vegetables] on an ordinary day. Total weekly intake of fruit and vegetables was calculated by using the two questions above.6"

Mean BMI was 26.3 kg/m2 (SD\u00bc 4.9), 11.7% was a daily smoker, mean alcohol intake was 19.7 units per week (SD\u00bc 19.1). Among respondents with the most cultural capital, 1.7% experienced great financial strain, among those with the least cultural capital this was 7.8%. Two-third (66.7%) of the respondents experiencing great financial strain was in the tertile with the least cultural capital. Among respondents experiencing no financial strain, this was 33.4% (table 3). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between cultural capital and financial scarcity was 0.24. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between financial scarcity and income was 0.40.\nIn terms of financial strain, some as compared to no financial strain was associated with a 0.7 kg/m2 higher BMI (95% CI 0.20:1.20) and with 31.8 (-1.06 30) min less sports participation per week (95% CI 1.75: 0.38) (model 1). Great financial strain was associated with 41.4 min less sports participation per week (95% CI 2.75: 0.01) when compared with no financial strain. Other associations in model 1 were not significant (table 4).\nIn the matter of cultural capital, less cultural capital (middle and lowest tertile) was associated with a higher BMI, drinking less alcohol, less sport participation and less fruit intake. For those in the middle tertile of cultural capital, this was 3.8 less units of alcohol a week (95% CI 5.8: 1.9) and 1.7 less pieces of fruit a week (95% CI 2.8: 0.7).

            "text": "Using data from the Dutch GLOBE study, we investigated the moderation effect of cultural capital on the association between financial scarcity and health behaviours. Some financial strain was associated with a higher BMI and less sport participation and experiencing great financial strain was associated with less sport participation. The theory of scarcity hypothesizes that more financial strain is associated with more unhealthy behaviour, which has only been confirmed for a few health behaviours (BMI and sport participation).3 Cultural capital, however, was significantly associated with many health behaviours (BMI, alcohol and fruit intake, sports participation). Our hypothesis that cultural capital moderates the association between financial strain and health behaviour could not be endorsed by these results, possibly due to limited power as the number of respondents with great financial strain per tertile of cultural capital was low.\nThe association between financial strain and a higher BMI is in line with the findings in other studies. Prentice et al.28 found that prolonged financial stress was associated with subsequent obesity, and Siahpush et al.7 and Beenackers et al.6 also showed that financial stress was associated with obesity. An association between financial strain and fruit and vegetable consumption was not affirmed in this study, unlike the study of Beenackers et al.6 in which financial strain was associated with the combined consumption of less fruit and vegetables. Our study analysed fruit and vegetable consumption separately, which may explain the difference in results. Similar to previous studies, we also found a positive association between cultural capital and sports participation,8,9 a higher self-perceived general health status,12 the consumption of more healthy foods10,29 and a\nTable 1 Measurements and possible answers of the variables for cultural capital\nVariables Measurement in the survey Possible answers\nIncorporated cultural capital Visiting different cultural practices: historical museums, art museums, opera or ballet, classical concerts, theatre, architecture and popular concerts or festivals\n0\u00bcnever, 1\u00bconce per year, 2\u00bcmore than once per year\nObjectivized cultural capital Numbers of books in possession 1\u00bc0\u201310 books, 2\u00bc 11\u201325 books, 3\u00bc 26\u2013100 books, 4\u00bc 101\u2013200 books, 5\u00bc>200 books Institutionalized cultural capital Educational level of the respondent\u2019s father, mother, partner and themselves.

Research of Wang et al.30 shows lower frequency of alcohol drinking when reporting more cultural participation. This study looked only at incorporated cultural capital, which could explain the difference in outcome. That is, when taking all parts of cultural capital into account, higher education contributes to more cultural capital. And since people with a higher level of education drink more alcohol than people with a lower level of education this could lead to a higher alcohol intake among respondents with more cultural capital.31\nRespondents experiencing financial strain did not walk and cycle more than respondents who did not experience financial strain. On one hand, experiencing financial strain could increase walking and cycling behaviour as they are cheaper and more accessible options compared to for example riding a car. However, less mental bandwidth to think about healthier options may also make car riding or inactive transportation a more convenient and quicker option, thus cancelling out the effects of scarcity on walking and cycling behaviour.\nThe correlation between cultural capital and financial scarcity was low. Financial scarcity therefore does not necessarily lead to less participation in cultural activities, which is in line with the theory of cultural capital and earlier research.14 The correlation between financial scarcity and income was moderate. Higher income does help to prevent financial scarcity, but does not necessarily avoid financial scarcity, as shown by Beenackers et al.6: having great compared to no financial scarcity increases risk of different unhealthy health behaviours independent of income.\nThis was the first study to investigate the potential moderating role of cultural capital on the association between financial scarcity and different health behaviours. Although the use of questionnaires will have excluded participants with low literacy, the sample seems representative of the source population in terms of health behaviours.16 Further, the amount of respondents experiencing some or great financial strain (28.4%) is reasonably in accordance with the numbers of the whole Dutch population (32.9% according to the National Institute for Budget Information).32 The possibility that participants with financial strain were less likely to fill in the questionnaire, probably because of less cognitive bandwidth available, does not seem to be the case.\nSeveral limitations, however, should be noted. Firstly, our results are less generalizable to groups with a migration background; they are underrepresented in the GLOBE study.16 Secondly, self-reported data were used which could lead to socially desirable answers and recall bias. This is particularly problematic as such bias differs by levels of financial strain or cultural capital; most likely, this will have resulted in an underestimation of associations. The use of valid questionnaires for sport participation, walking and cycling, fruit and vegetable intake, alcohol intake, and cultural capital may have mitigated some of the bias, but it cannot be excluded to have influenced our findings.18,33\u201335\nStudying cultural capital can contribute to a better understanding of socioeconomic inequality and what resources people\nTable 3 Distribution of financial strain by tertiles of cultural capital\nNo financial strain\nSome financial strain\nGreat financial strain\nTertile 1 cultural capital\n663 (37.7%) 107 (18.1%) 13 (11.1%)\nTertile 2 cultural capital\n507 (28.9%) 150 (25.4%) 26 (22.2%)\nTertile 3 cultural capital\n588 (33.4%) 334 (56.5%) 78 (66.7%)\nNote: With tertile 1 of cultural capital containing the respondents with the most cultural capital.\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/33/5/771/7236010 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\n(unconsciously) use to determine their health behaviour. Future research could focus on potential differences between specific elements of cultural capital. Policy actions to improve health behaviour should take into account the effects of financial scarcity and the possible preventive role of cultural capital. For instance, for effective improvement of health behaviour, financial stress needs to be reduced first. To improve cultural capital lowthreshold access, for example through a city discount pass for\naffordable prices for museums, theatre, etc. and free access to the library as well as a wide range of cultural activities can help. In addition, more (financial) opportunities for further education can be of added value.\nIn conclusion, financial strain and cultural capital were both associated with health behaviours, but general cultural capital had no moderating effect on the relationship between financial strain and different health behaviours."
