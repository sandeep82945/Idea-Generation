    "abstractText": "Background: men who have sex with men (MSM) are a high-risk group for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and the HPV vaccine is effective in preventing it. However, according to risk compensation theory, people may increase sexual risk behaviors after receiving HPV vaccination. Based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), this study investigated the influencing factors to predict intention to reduce condom use (risk compensation intention) among MSM after taking HPV vaccination in southwest China. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study among 948 MSM in southwest China using a non-probability sampling method and an electronic questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual risk behavior characteristics, HPV-related prevention behavior, and the HAPA scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using a structural equation model. Results: among 948 MSM, the incidence rate of reducing the frequency of condom use was 14.1%. The structural equation model showed that self-efficacy (\u03b2 = \u22120.378, p = 0.020) and positive outcome expectancy (\u03b2 = 0.366, p < 0.05) had greater effects on behavioral intention, followed by negative outcome expectancy (\u03b2 = \u22120.296, p < 0.05) and risk perception (\u03b2 = \u22120.232, p < 0.05). Conclusions: risk compensation may not be a major barrier to receiving HPV vaccination among MSM. Nevertheless, the recognition of possible risk compensation is necessary to implement appropriate interventions to reduce the occurrence of risk compensation.",

            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STD) worldwide. At present, more than 200 types of HPV have been identified [1]. Almost all cervical cancers, 90% of anal cancers, and 30% of oropharyngeal cancers worldwide are caused by HPV [2]. HPV infection is common among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM have significantly higher rates of HPV infection compared to heterosexual men and women [3\u20135]. Meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of HPV infection was very high among MSM internationally (63.9% for HIV-negative MSM and 92.6% for HIVpositive MSM) [6], and the overall HPV prevalence in China was 66.3% [7]. HPV infection can cause genital warts, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers in men [8\u201310]. MSM are at high risk of HPV infection and persistence, carrying multiple HPV types and HPV-related diseases with rapid progression to malignancies [11]. The HPV vaccine is effective in preventing HPV infection and the diseases it causes. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends either ninevalent HPV or four-valent HPV vaccines for MSM [12]. Numerous studies have shown that nine-valent HPV or four-valent HPV vaccines are both effective and cost-effective in preventing HPV-related diseases among males [13\u201315]. In 2011, the United States became\nVaccines 2023, 11, 1429. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11091429 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines\nthe first country to incorporate regular HPV vaccination for men, including MSM under the age of 26, into its national vaccination program [16]. By March 2017, 11 countries had provided male vaccination [17]. In China, males are still excluded from the HPV vaccination program [18]. Previous studies have found that MSM had a high willingness for HPV vaccination in China, and more than 80% of MSM were willing to vaccinate; thus, they could be considered for inclusion in the HPV vaccination program [19,20]. However, HPV vaccination has the potential to increase sexual risk behavior while providing benefits to MSM. This phenomenon is called risk compensation. Risk compensation theory refers to the concern that those who undergo a preventive intervention (e.g., HPV vaccination) may engage in behaviors that put them at risk (e.g., reducing condom use) because they feel protected [21]. It has been used to study the sexual behaviors of people at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV infection. For example, the introduction of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), though significantly reducing the risk of HIV transmission, was associated with a decrease in the willingness to use condoms and an increase in the number of sexual partners [22,23]. Therefore, some studies have been concerned with HPV vaccination encouraging sexual risk behaviors, leading to the occurrence of risk compensation [24,25]. At present, studies on risk compensation after taking HPV vaccination mainly focus on women. As an intervention to reduce the risk of STD among MSM, there are few studies on the behavioral intention and influencing factors of risk compensation among MSM after receiving HPV vaccination. The theoretical framework of this study is the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) proposed by German psychologist Schwarzer, which is often applied to predict various health behaviors [26,27]. The HAPA is a dual-phase model that distinguishes pre-intentional motivational and post-intentional volitional phases involved in behavior formulation [28]. In the pre-intentional motivational phase, intention is regarded as a primary predictor of behavior. Outcome expectancy (i.e., the belief that the target behavior will lead to effective outcomes for the individual) and self-efficacy (i.e., beliefs in one\u2019s personal capacity to perform the target behavior) are posited as the main factors influencing intention. Risk perception (i.e., the belief in the severity and susceptibility that may result from not performing the target behavior) is posited as a remote antecedent of intention formation. In the volitional phase, there are mainly two parts: (1) action planning and coping plan, and (2) maintenance and recovery self-efficacy. The volitional phase could not be used for this study because MSM do not receive HPV vaccination. It is appropriate to apply the pre-intentional motivational phase of HAPA as the theoretical framework of this study. Some research has also only focused on it [29\u201331]. Previous studies have consistently supported the use of HAPA for vaccination, as all structures of the model predict subsequent vaccination behavior. It has also been applied to explore intentions for influenza vaccination [32], HPV vaccination [24], and COVID-19 vaccination [33]. As more and more countries include males in the HPV vaccination program, it is worth paying attention to whether the psychological cognition and sexual behavior of individuals among MSM will change after receiving HPV vaccination. Therefore, this study investigates the influencing factors to predict risk compensation intention among MSM after taking HPV vaccination in southwest China, and provides evidence for subsequent risk coping strategies of such prevention measures."

Cronbach\u2019s alpha and composite reliability (CR) were used to measure reliability, both of which needed to be greater than 0.70, indicating good internal consistency. The average variance extracted (AVE) was used to measure the convergent validity, and a value greater than 0.50 indicated good convergence. The discriminant validity was considered acceptable if the correlation coefficient between structures was lower than the square root of the corresponding structure. Model fit was assessed using the chi-squared and degree of freedom ratio (\u03c72/df), comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker Lewis index (TLI), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The model fitting was acceptable when \u03c72/df < 5, CFI > 0.90, TLI > 0.90, SRMR < 0.08, and RMSEA < 0.08. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05."

The potential risk compensation after receiving HPV vaccination, as an intervention to reduce the risk of STD among MSM, is a topic of concern. Based on the HAPA, this study investigated the influencing factors to predict risk compensation intention among MSM after taking HPV vaccination in southwest China. The structural equation model was used for confirmatory factor analysis. Overall, the model fits well. This study found that 87.6% of MSM were willing to receive HPV vaccination, which is similar to the results of previous studies in China (86.2% and 82.8%) [19,20]. It can be seen that MSM had a high willingness to receive HPV vaccination. Risk compensation intention was investigated among all participants in a hypothetical situation of having received HPV vaccination. We only studied one form of risk compensation (changes in condom use intention). Theoretically, MSM might increase the number of sex partners while reducing the frequency of condom use. Such cases may just be rare occurrences [42]. The results showed that 14.1% of MSM would reduce their intention to use condoms after taking HPV vaccination. The incidence rate of risk compensation intention investigated in our study was higher than the previous study among MSM in Hong Kong (8.0%) [24], but lower than those related to some other biomedical prevention measures among men who have sex with men, such as voluntary medical male circumcision (15.9%) [43] and HIV vaccines (34.6%) [44]. This study suggests that risk compensation may not be a major barrier to receiving HPV vaccination among MSM. Nevertheless, the recognition of possible risk compensation is necessary to implement appropriate interventions for reducing the occurrence of risk compensation after HPV vaccination. Structural equation model analysis showed that self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancy had a greater effect on behavioral intention, followed by negative outcome expectancy and risk perception. Risk perception was negatively correlated with risk compensation intention, that is, the reduced risk perception of HPV in MSM may lead to an increased willingness to risk compensation after taking HPV vaccination, which is similar to the results of previous studies on risk compensation behavior [42,45]. Our finding on the relationship between risk perception and risk compensation intention also confirmed the risk compensation theory. After taking HPV vaccination, MSM\u2019s perceived risk may decrease, thereby increasing sexual risk behavior and generating risk compensation. Therefore, when promoting HPV vaccination, we should take care to remind MSM that the protective effect of the HPV vaccine is limited and it should not be used as a substitute for condom use, but rather as a complementary strategy to prevent STDs. Positive outcome expectancy was one of the main influencing factors of risk compensation intention and was positively correlated with it. After receiving HPV vaccination, MSM believed that condomless anal intercourse would increase intimacy and trust between them and their male sex partners. Such a positive outcome expectancy was related to a higher intention to conduct risk compensation behavior. Several studies have also paid attention to the effect of intimacy and trust on sexual risk behavior among MSM. Condomless anal intercourse was seen by MSM as a bond to build a trusting relationship, and more than half of the participants cited it as a reason for not using condoms [46]. A quantitative study on MSM found that there was a relationship between relationship length, trust, and condom use. If the relationship lasted longer, the increase of trust would lead to a decrease in condom use [47]. Negative outcome expectancy had a negative effect on behavioral intention, and increasing it might reduce risk compensation. Based on this, future interventions should emphasize negative outcomes (e.g., condomless anal intercourse can give\nyou HPV/other STDs.) and should improve the negative outcome expectancy of MSM to prevent the occurrence of risk compensation after HPV vaccination in this population. Self-efficacy had a direct negative effect on risk compensation intention, and increasing self-efficacy may reduce risk compensation. Self-efficacy of condom use refers to how confident people are in their ability to use condoms. Previous studies have shown that lower self-efficacy of condom use was strongly associated with higher sexual risk behaviors [48\u201350], and our study confirmed this relationship. This finding highlights the importance of finding creative, effective ways to improve self-efficacy of condom use among MSM and suggests that achieving this goal may help reduce the likelihood of risk compensation after receiving HPV vaccination among MSM. Combined with the above negative correlation results, it is suggested that when promoting HPV vaccination to MSM, we should enhance the risk awareness of MSM, emphasize the negative outcome expectancy of condom use reduction, improve the self-efficacy of condom use, and decrease the positive outcome expectancy of condom use reduction to reduce the occurrence of risk compensation. There are some limitations to the current study. First, our study is a cross-sectional survey, which limited causal inference. Cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings in the future. Second, MSM do not receive HPV vaccination. We investigated the risk compensation intention in a hypothetical situation of having received HPV vaccination. Although behavioral intention is deemed to be a major factor affecting actual behavior, some differences occur between actual behavior and intention. Third, due to the obscuring nature of the MSM, a non-probabilistic sampling method was used in this study. The results may be biased, which may limit the generalization of our findings to other MSM populations."
