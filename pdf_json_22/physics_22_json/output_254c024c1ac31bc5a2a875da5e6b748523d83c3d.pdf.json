    "abstractText": "Photocurrent-voltage characteristic (PC-V) is a method of determining the critical parameter in X-ray and gamma-ray detector plates, i.e., the carrier mobility-lifetime product, \u03bc\u03c4. We show for the (Cd,Mn)Te samples that the measurement results depend strongly on the surface treatment and the space charge distribution. The PC-V characteristics obtained for h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg and h\u0304\u03c9 ~ Eg indicated that etching with 20% HCl caused an appearance of a significant concentration of very shallow surface traps at the (Cd,Mn)Te sample surface. These traps seriously changed the results of measurements of PC-V characteristics and PC kinetics. We also noticed a small contribution of holes to photoconductivity in the PC kinetics. The measurements of PC-V characteristics for h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg may test the detector plate surface quality.",

            "text": "(Cd,Mn)Te is a wide bandgap semiconducting compound. We want to make it competitive with commonly used CdTe and (Cd,Zn)Te compounds for X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. The attained values of the resistivity, \u03c1~1010 \u2126 cm, and the \u00b5\u03c4 product, \u00b5\u03c4 > 10\u22123 cm2V\u22121, make us hope for the commercial use of the material. A review of (Cd,Mn)Te studies as material for those detectors may be found in Reference [1]. One of the critical parameters is the \u00b5e\u03c4e product, where \u00b5e is the carrier mobility (here electrons) and \u03c4e is the carrier lifetime (here also electrons). It is not easy to attain a large \u00b5e\u03c4e parameter (>5 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2V\u22121), uniform in the whole volume of the sample with an area of 20 \u00d7 20 mm2 or more. Usually, the \u00b5e\u03c4e parameter is determined by illuminating the sample with alpha particles or gamma rays and investigating the charge collection efficiency (CCE). CCE is defined as the fraction of injected charges that is collected in the external circuit. For alpha particles with energy of 5.5 MeV, the penetration depth is about 20 \u00b5m. Concerning the typical sample thickness (~2000\u20133000 \u00b5m), it is like a surface effect. The penetration is much deeper for the gamma radiation (Am-241 59.5 keV). The incident gamma radiation with energy of 60 keV is absorbed in 90% at a distance of about 600 \u00b5m; it is ~20% of the sample thickness. The CCE value may be obtained by fitting the experimental PC-V data with the Hecht\u2013Many function [2,3], where the fitting parameters are \u00b5e\u03c4e and the surface recombination velocity, se.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2941. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22082941 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2941 2 of 16\nThe Hecht\u2013Many model assumes no space charge in the sample in stationary conditions. Therefore, the internal electric field is uniform: E = VL\u22121, where E is the field, V is the applied voltage, and L is the sample thickness. The model also assumes that the parameters \u00b5e and \u03c4e are uniform in the sample volume. This means that \u00b5e 6= \u00b5e(a) and \u03c4e 6= \u03c4e(a), where a is distance from the illuminated cathode to the anode. Next, in this model an electric charge is generated just below the sample surface at a distance \u03b4 much smaller than the sample thickness, L. For (Cd,Zn)Te, Cui et al. [4,5] have shown that the \u00b5e\u03c4e product may be determined by measuring the photocurrent as a function of the applied voltage (PC-V). The energy of the light used for the electron injection was either higher or smaller than the energy gap, Eg. The experiments indicated that the results strongly depended on the surface conditions and the surface processing methods. The authors recall similar observations of the impact of surface conditions on the carrier transport measurements in HgI2 [6\u20138]. The aim of our study was to perform comparable measurements for (Cd,Mn)Te by using the PC-V technique and different methods of sample surface preparation. Similar experimental and theoretical studies were performed for (Cd,Zn)Te [9\u201313]. Shen et al. [14] showed interesting results of processing the (Cd,Mn)Te surfaces. The main conclusion of that study was that the final etching with 5% HCl created the smoothest surface with the average value of the surface roughness, Ra, 0.84 nm. We decided to test Shen\u2019s method. We etched the polished surfaces of the (Cd,Mn)Te samples with HCl, changing the concentration of the solution. In the next sections, we present results of measurements of the PC-V characteristics. The results obtained by using LED light were compared with the measurements performed by using the gamma rays (Am-241 59.5 keV). We show that the results of the PC-V investigation are significantly different for different methods of the sample surface preparation. Finally, we present the PC-V characteristics for the excitation by the light with the energy above Eg and slightly below Eg."

            "text": "The crystals of Cd0.95Mn0.05Te:In ([In] \u2248 1 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123) were prepared by the lowpressure Bridgman (LPB) method in the vertical configuration. The diameters of the crystals were 2 or 3 inches and the weight 500 g and 1500 g, respectively. Usually a few twins which pass from the bottom to the top of the crystal are visible (see, e.g., Figure 22 in Reference [1]). Single-crystal blocks allowed us to obtain monocrystalline plates with dimensions of 20 \u00d7 20 mm2, 30 \u00d7 30 mm2, or more. The concentration of Te inclusions is \u22645 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123. To obtain semi-insulating materials with \u03c1~1010 \u2126 cm, the crystals were doped with indium. To obtain deep donors TeCd2+ [15,16], tellurium was added in proportion 50\u2013100 mg Te per 100 g of material. The crystallization speed was 0.5\u20131.0 mmh\u22121. Before cutting, the crystals were etched with the Durose etchant [17,18] to reveal twins and grain boundaries. Durose etchant reveals the polarity of the CdTe plate cut along the (111) plane, i.e., the twin plane. Then, the Cd-face is (111)-oriented and is named A-face, and the Te-face is ( 111 ) -oriented and is named B-face. The etched Cd-face is matt black and the Te-face is shiny. The (Cd,Mn)Te crystal usually consists of a few, differently oriented monocrystalline blocks and a few twins. Basing on the shade of gray of differently oriented grains in the (Cd,Mn)Te crystal, one can clearly determine the position of grain boundaries and twin planes. Then, the samples were cut parallel to the twin planes (111). The samples were initially ground and etched with Durose etchant to determine the planes A (cadmium) and B (tellurium). After that, the samples were mechanically ground by using a water suspension of 4.5 \u00b5m SiC powder, and mechano-chemically polished in 2% bromine-methanol solution. The mechano-chemical polishing of the samples was followed by etching with HCl acid. Min Shen et al. [14] described interesting methods of preparing surfaces of (Cd,Mn)Te samples for depositing contacts. The results inspired us to use HCl in the procedure of the sample surface preparation. The last stage of the authors\u2019 method is chemical polishing\nSensors 2022, 22, 2941 3 of 16\n(CP) with 5% HCl. We prepared three sets of samples, the surfaces (A and B) of which were treated with differently concentrated HCl, namely: 10%, 15%, or 20% for 10\u201320 s. In the next sections we will show that these three sets of samples can be divided into two groups depending on the observed surface effects. The first group of samples was etched with 10% or 15% HCl. We do not observe any effects related to the generation of surface traps for this group. The second set of samples was etched with 20% HCl. The density of generated surface traps is significant for this group. Onto both types of surfaces, A and B, thin contact layers with thicknesses ~30 nm were deposited by using the sputtering method. For this purpose, we used two types of metal alloys: Au/Pd or Pt/Pd, where the proportion of Au or Pt to Pd was 80:20. Palladium added to Au or Pt target increases adhesion. The monocrystalline samples had dimensions of 10 \u00d7 10 mm2 or 20 \u00d7 20 mm2 and thicknesses roughly of 1\u20133 mm. In the center of the sample surface the metal contact layers (anode and cathode) had diameters \u03d5 = 5 mm for samples with dimensions 10 \u00d7 10 mm2 and \u03d5 = 8 mm for samples with dimensions 20 \u00d7 20 mm2. On the surfaces close to the sample edges, rings, whose role was to insulate the current between the anode and the cathode from the leakage current on the sidewalls of the sample, were deposited by sputtering. For PC-V measurements, the light sources were light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and the light passed through interference filters (IF) to reduce the width of a spectral range of the exciting radiation. The Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM) of the IF will be shown in Section 3.1. The central part of the cathode was illuminated through an aperture with d = 3 mm for samples with dimensions 10 \u00d7 10 mm2 and d = 5 mm for samples with dimensions 20 \u00d7 20 mm2. The incident light power in \u00b5W, converted to eV/s and divided by the photon energy, enabled us to determine the number of incident photons. Each photon, reaching the sample surface through the metal contact, especially with the energy h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg, creates an electron-hole pair. We believe that for thin (approximately 30 nm) metal contacts, the loss of light intensity is mainly due to reflection. We estimate that at least 30% photon flux reaches the sample. The energy gap, Eg, of Cd0.95Mn0.05Te crystals is 1.575 eV at room temperature. For h\u0304\u03c9 greater than Eg (e.g., Eg + 30 meV) the absorption coefficient in our samples is about 2 \u00d7 104 cm\u22121 [19,20]. The radiation is absorbed at a distance from the surface smaller than 1 \u00b5m. Holes quickly return to the cathode and electrons conduct the electric current. So, the current measured in the PC-V characteristic is an electron current. The PC-V characteristics were measured at a constant illumination of the middle part of the cathode by increasing the bias voltage. Kinetics of photocurrent was measured at a selected constant bias voltage by applying a nearly rectangular light pulse (pulse rise time ~0.5 ms). As will be shown in Section 3.2, the increase and stabilization of the PC signal after sample illumination, and the extinction of the PC signal after turning off the light source last longer than 1 s. Therefore, we did not use a chopper in the experiments of photocurrent kinetics. We excited the samples with photon energies h\u0304\u03c9 ~ Eg and h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg, i.e., h\u0304\u03c9 = Eg + x, where x changed from 15 meV to 76 meV and Eg = 1.575 eV. The experiments of PC-V characteristics with the use of LEDs and photocurrent kinetics were performed with the use of the following equipment:\n\u2022 The PC-V measurements were carried out by using the samples with rings. The grounded cathode was illuminated by LED. The cathode and ring on the cathode side were biased with the same negative voltage, and the anode and the ring on the anode side were biased with the same positive voltage. Two Keithley 6517B Electrometers were used to apply the bias voltage and to measure the current between cathode and anode and the current between rings on the cathode and anode sides. \u2022 Illuminating Thorlabs LEDs were powered by the Keithley 6220 Precision Current Source. We used six types of LEDs, the maximum light intensities of which are at energies: 1.434 eV, 1.507 eV, 1.556 eV, 1.590 eV, 1.602 eV and 1.656 eV. The FWHM of the LED emitted spectra is approximately 58 meV. The interference filters we used are characterized by maximum transmissions at 1.461 eV, 1.509 eV, 1.556 eV, 1.608 eV and\nSensors 2022, 22, 2941 4 of 16\n1.651 eV. The FWHM of IF are from 16 to 23 meV. In our measurements in the energy range Eg \u2212 15 meV > h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg + 15 meV a small value of IF FWHM is negligible but in measurements at h\u0304\u03c9 ~ Eg the IF FWHM may be misleading due to a sharp change of the absorption coefficient in this spectral range.\n\u2022 The LED light passing through IF was uncovered and covered by the Thorlabs SC10 Shutter Controller. The shutter open and close time was about 0.5 ms. Radiation power was measured by the Thorlabs PM100D Optical Power Meter. \u2022 PC kinetics was registered by the Tektronix MSO 54 Oscilloscope by using the preamplifier from the Keithley 6517B Electrometer. \u2022 The PC-V characteristics were measured at room temperature 294 K (21 \u25e6C) and at a higher temperature of 306 K (33 \u25e6C) by using a slightly heated sample holder.\nWe also made measurements as follows:\n\u2022 The room-temperature current-voltage (I-V) characteristic was measured at a voltage up to \u00b1700 V by using the Keithley 6517B voltage source. \u2022 The resistivity map was obtained by a contactless method, i.e., the Time-Dependent Charge Measurement (TDCM) method [21], with the use of the EU-\u03c1-\u00b5\u03c4-SCAN apparatus. In the TDCM method the sample is placed into a capacitor as a lossy dielectric substance and the resistivity is evaluated by measuring a time-dependent charge transient observed after application of a voltage step. The measurement is non-contacting, i.e., it avoids the problems connected with the fabrication of ohmic contacts [22]. \u2022 Measurement of the absorption coefficient (absorption edge) was performed at room temperature on a 100 \u00b5m thick sample by using the Fluorolog 3 spectrometer equipped with a photomultiplier as a detector. \u2022 The measurements of the gamma-ray response current were made by using the Am-241 gamma source, the activity of which was 925 MBq (single-encapsulated stainless steel source). A small lead collimator with a hole diameter of 3 mm and a length of 3 cm was used. The current flowing through the sample under X-ray irradiation was measured with a digital multimeter Keysight 2901A. \u2022 Alpha particle energy spectra for (Cd,Mn)Te samples were examined with a spectrometric system. This system consisted of a charge preamplifier, a spectrometric amplifier and a multichannel analyzer. Alpha particle energy was 5.5 MeV. \u2022 The measurement of the X-ray spectrum centroid as a function of the applied voltage was made by using the Spectroscopic Pixel Mapping apparatus by Eurorad. The activity of the Co-57 source used by us was 398 kBq. The sample was polarized by a negative high voltage. The spectrum was performed via a multichannel analyzer, which was connected to the amplifier. \u2022 In the experiments with the use of alpha particles and X- and gamma rays, the application of rings was eliminated. The incident particles or radiation passed through a collimator and reached the sample from the cathode side."

For the A surface we obtained \u03bce\u03c4e = 5.85 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2V\u22121, I0 = 6.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 A, and for B \u03bce\u03c4e = 4.62 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2V\u22121, I0 = 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 A.\nComparing the results shown in Figures 1\u20133, we concluded that for the first group of samples, i.e., when the sample surfaces were treated by less concentrated HCl, namely 10% or 15%, the results of both experiments, i.e., photocurrent measurements with the use of LED and Am-241 radiation sources, can be well described by the Hecht formula. Below we will discuss certain shortcomings of this method.\nFigure 3. PC-V characteristic for two opposite surfaces (A and B) of a (Cd,Mn)Te:In sa ple etched ith 15 Cl.

Below we will discuss certain hortcomings of this method. Before the PC-V characteristics, resistivity maps of all investigated samples were obtained. A typical result is shown in Figure 4. Let us pay attention to the upper left corner of the map, the sample border (and the crystal border). We see that the leakage side current may influence the measurement result up to about 3 mm from the side. Therefore, in measurements of PC-V and I-V we used rings close to the sample sides. Semi-insulating samples, chosen for measurements of PC-V characteristics and PC kinetics, had resistivities with average values from 5 \u00d7 109 \u2126 cm to 2 \u00d7 1010 \u2126 cm. As was mentioned in Section 2, the samples were cut out of the crystals parallel to the (111) plane. Metal contact layers, deposited onto polished and etched surfaces, had thicknesses ~30 nm. In the I-V measurements, we noticed that when the anode (+) was on the A (cadmium) side, the current had a lower value than when the current was applied in the opposite direction, especially for the high voltage. This is due to the non-ohmic contacts. A typical I-V characteristic is shown in Figure 5. The right side of the plot shows the case when the anode is on the A (cadmium) side. This effect was checked on many samples with surfaces prepared by different methods. Experimentalists may pay attention to that.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2941 7 of 16\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 18\nBefore the PC-V characteristics, resistivity maps of all investigated samples were obtained.

[13] (Equation (9) in that cited paper):\nV = \u03b50 \u03b5r\u00b5e \u03b8\n3J\n [( se J \u00b5e(F\u2217e\u2212 J) )2 + 2JL \u03b50 \u03b5r\u00b5e\u03b8 ] 3 2 \u2212 ( se J \u00b5e(F\u2217e\u2212 J) )3, (3) where J represents the current density, \u03b50, \u03b5r, V, F*, and e are the vacuum and the relative permittivity, the applied bias voltage, the photon flux which reaches the sample passing the metal layer and the elementary charge, respectively. Parameter \u03b8 is defined as follows:\n\u03b8 = n\nn + nt , (4)\nwhere n is the free electron density, and nt is the trapped electron density. Usually nt >> n, so \u03b8 = nnt . In this model, the fitting parameters were \u03b8 and se. The F* value was determined from the saturation of photocurrent versus voltage [13]. The model considers surface effects and the non-uniform electric field distribution in the sample, especially in the vicinity of the cathode. Fits of the experimental data with the model from Reference [13] are shown in Figure 9. We can see that for the sample etched with 20% HCl, the photocurrent measured at different photon fluxes changes exponentially with applied bias voltage, with the exponent close to 3/2, which is shown in Figure 10. Such behavior may be expected for traps generating a \u201cCoulomb-attractive\u201d potential. This effect is similar to the Poole\u2013Frenkel model [23,24] analyzed in Reference [25]. In that paper, the de-trapping mechanism is described by the relation E3/2, following the change of the capture cross section proportional to E\u22123/2. Such a relationship was obtained in Reference [26], where in lithium-doped germanium detectors a decrease of the trapping cross section as a function of electric field was observed (see Figure 17 in Reference [26]). The results and their interpretation indicate quite deep traps. For a sample etched with 20% HCl, the results of which are indicated in Figures 6 and 8\u201310, we registered X-ray spectra using Co-57 source. According to our interpretation, saying that a treatment of (Cd,Mn)Te sample with 20% HCl causes a formation of surface traps, we cannot expect sharp peaks in the detected spectra.

The excitation energy was equal to \u0127\u03c9 = 1.651 eV = Eg + 76 meV. Photocurrent increased with the bias voltage roughly like V3/2. When the current is inversely proportional to the cross section for Coulomb trapping, it should depend on the electric field like E3/2 [23\u201326].\nIn order to explain the results presented in Figures 6 and 8\u201310 we measured PC-V characteristics for another (Cd,Mn)Te sample at two slightly different temperatures: 294 K and 306 K. The result is shown in Figure 11. The small temperature change (~4%) caused an evident change in the measured PC-V curve. The dependence changed from a power function to a nearly exponential function at the low voltage, resembling the Hecht\u2013Many function. Because of the presented results, we believe that we observe very shallowly localized (i.e., localized close to the sample surface) traps capturing electrons moving from the cathode, where they are generated by light. The increasing voltage causes de-trapping, and at the higher voltage the PC-V curve saturates. Figure 11 indicates that in a low voltage region a temperature change from 294 K to 306 K causes an increase of the PC-V signal by a factor of 2.5. We estimated that the ionization energy of these surface traps is approximately 0.6 eV below the conduction band. It is valid for semiconductors partially compensated [27]. Their ionization at low voltage may be similar to the Poole\u2013Frenkel effect. Moreover, for (Cd,Mn)Te crystals, the measurements of the Pockels effect and Pockels E-field profiling [28\u201330] indicated at the high voltage the non-uniform distribution of the electric field in the sample up to about 200 \u00b5m from the cathode. Therefore, we cannot consider the electric field inside the sample, E as VL\u22121, because the field is not uniform. We can only take into consideration the applied voltage, as was done in Reference [13].\nFigure 10. PC-V characteristics fro Figure 9 in logarith ic scale.

We can only take into consideration the applied voltage, as was done in Reference [13]. Due to the fact that from the Ridzonova model [13] we could not determine the \u00b5e\u03c4e value, we made an attempt to roughly estimate this value. We used the relation:\nJ = e Ne \u00b5e V L , (5)\nwhere Ne is the free electron concentration. Here we assume \u00b5e = 800 cm2V\u22121s\u22121 [31\u201333]. From this relation and the PC-V saturation current, we obtained the free electron concentration, Ne, given in Table 1. In Figure 9, we see for each PC-V curve a definite knee, above which the current saturates. Therefore, we believe that all electrons generated by light reach the anode for the bias voltage, V, corresponding to the knee. That would mean that the mean drift time, \u03c4dr, corresponds to the electron lifetime, \u03c4e (\u03c4dr \u2248 \u03c4e).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2941 12 of 16Sensors 20 2, 2, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 18\nFigure 11.

It changes shape after raising temperature up to 306 K (by about 4%) and resembles the Hecht\u2013Many function. The conducting electrons may appear due to thermal ionization of surface trapping. In this sample deep traps must also exist, e.g., tellurium antisites TeCd2+. Deep traps can be emptied by the application of higher voltages. Thus, in a voltage range higher than 50 V the increase of the PC-V signal is noticed.\nDue to the fact that from the Ridzonova model [13] we could not determine the \u03bce\u03c4e value, we made an attempt to roughly estimate this value.

We are aware of the possible non-uniform electric field distribution, especially for high bias voltage and high photon flux. However, we try to estimate the \u03bce\u03c4e product from the relation: \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udc38 = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udf0f , (6)\nThen, \ud835\udc3f \u2245 \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc38 and \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0f \u2245 .

PC-V characteristics measured at two slightly different te peratures. The results were obtained on a (Cd,Mn)Te:In sample etched with 20% HCl but different from the one whose results were presented in Figures 6 and 8\u201310. The excitation energy was equal to h\u0304\u03c9 = 1.608 eV = Eg + 33 meV. Below 30 V at 294 K, the dependence is power like. It changes shape after raising temperature up to 306 K (by about 4%) and resembles the Hecht\u2013Many function. The conducting electrons may appear due to thermal ionization of surface trapping. In this sample deep traps must also exist, e.g., tellurium antisites TeCd2+. Deep traps can be emptied by the application of higher voltages. Thus, in a voltage range higher than 50 V the increase of the PC-V signal is noticed.\nWe are aware of the possible non-uniform electric field distribution, especially for high bias voltage and high photon flux. However, we try to estimate the \u00b5e\u03c4e product from the relation:\nvdr = \u00b5e E = L\n\u03c4dr , (6)\nThen, L \u223c= \u00b5e \u03c4e E and \u00b5e \u03c4e \u223c= L 2\nV .

Charge carriers are generated at the surface of the sample. The PC time dependence does not change much above 250 V.\nThe saturation current values increase with bias voltage like in the spectra shown in Figure 9. However, after shutting (shutter close time ~0.5 ms) the photocurrent decay is fast and does not depend on the bias voltage. Decay time has two components: (1) Very short time, much less than 1 s; (2) time about 5\u20138 s. The time decay was not analyzed in detail in the present work. The kinetics of photocurrent for the photon energy \u0127\u03c9 = 1.531 eV (Eg \u2212 44 meV) is very different from the one observed when \u0127\u03c9 > Eg (Figure 12), and is shown in Figure 13. For such photon energy in the tail of the absorption edge, the absorption coefficient is about 20 cm\u22121. The LED light with energy of 1.531 eV is absorbed in 90% at a distance of about 350 \u00b5m, which is about 10% of the thickness of this sample (3210 \u00b5m). For comparison, Am-241 gamma radiation with energy of 60 keV is absorbed in 90% at a distance of about 600 \u00b5m, as was mentioned in Section 1. If defects created by etching the sample surface with 20% HCl are surface defects, we can expect different PC characteristics for \u0127\u03c9 > Eg and \u0127\u03c9 < Eg. The light of energy \u0127\u03c9 > Eg is absorbed close to the sample surface and can interact with surface defects. The light of energy \u0127\u03c9 < Eg penetrates the sample deeper and to a lesser extent generates charge carriers near the surface. A similar phenomenon takes place if the sample is illuminated by gamma rays from Am-241 59.5 keV. Therefore, the Am-241 source cannot be used in photocurrent kinetics investigations.

A similar phenomenon takes place if the sample is illuminated by gamma rays from Am-241 59.5 keV. Therefore, the Am-241 source cannot be used in photocurrent kinetics investigations. In Figure 13, we can see that after opening the shutter, the signal rise time at the lowest voltage (5 V) is about 2 s, and at the highest voltage (300 V) is about 1 s. Decay time, like for h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg, is at first very fast and thereafter several seconds and does not depend on the bias voltage. For h\u0304\u03c9 = 1.531 eV the saturation current values increase with bias voltage like in the Hecht\u2013 Many formula. When we compare the results presented in Figures 12 and 13, taking into account the penetration depth of the radiation, we come to important observations. We may estimate a possible influence of holes flowing back to the cathode on the kinetics of photocurrent. For photons with energy below Eg, the PC kinetics is very fast, on the order of single seconds, and the hole contribution to the electric current is nearly negligible.

We noticed that in the voltage region below saturation, the current is proportional to V3/2 (in the case of uniform E that would correspond to E3/2). This is in agreement with the Poole\u2013Frenkel model [23,24]. The I ~ V3/2 dependence is observed even at voltages as low as about 30 V (for our samples with thicknesses ~0.3 cm that would correspond to E ~ 100 Vcm\u22121). We have shown that the PC-V method that uses excitation with energy of h\u0304\u03c9 > Eg + z, where z varies from 20 to 30 meV, is the most suitable for surface effect measurements. We also noticed that a change in the sample temperature by 4% significantly changed the PC-V characteristic. We roughly estimated that the ionization energy of these surface traps is approximately 0.6 eV below the conduction band. We measured the PC kinetics for samples with a high density of surface electron traps.

The model considers the non-uniform distribution of the electric field. We also point out that when the metallic contacts (Au/Pd, Pt/Pd) are deposited directly onto the surface of a high-resistive (Cd,Mn)Te sample with orientation (111), it is better to place the anode on the A (cadmium) side of the plate to obtain high resistivities.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.M., D.M.K., M.M.; methodology, A.M., D.M.K., K.G., \u0141.J., \u0141.S\u0301., J.I.-H.; software, W.D.; validation, W.C.; formal analysis, D.M.K., A.W., M.S., W.D., \u0141.J.; investigation, A.M., D.M.K., A.W., K.G., M.S., G.J., \u0141.J., W.C.; resources, A.M., D.M.K., K.G.; data curation, \u0141.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.M., M.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.M.K., A.W., K.G., M.S., W.D., \u0141.J., M.M.; visualization, D.M.K., A.W.; supervision, A.M., J.I.-H., M.M.
