Acupuncture (Acu) is a flexible treatment with few adverse\neffects and is thus widely used to treat neurological problems.\nMethods: We recruited a total of 60 patients and assigned them to two groups\n(n = 30 each group). During the study, some participants were excluded by\nquality control, and a total of 44 subjects (25 Acu and 19 controls) were\ncompleted to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture on CSVD\ncognitive impairment (CSVDCI). The following demographic and clinical variables\nwere compared between the two groups: gender, age, education, smoking,\nalcohol, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), symbol digit modalities test\n(SDMT), verbal fluency test (VFT), digit span task (DST), Boston naming test (BNT)\nscores, and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) under the typical band\n(0.01\u20130.08 Hz). Mixed effect analysis was utilized to test for differences between\nthe two groups before and after the treatment.\nResults: Following acupuncture treatment, the Acu group scored higher on\nMoCA, SDMT, VFT, DST, and BNT compared to controls (P < 0.05). The brain\nregions showing substantially greater ALFF values in the Acu group were the right\ninferior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left\ninsula, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, right cerebellum,\nright precuneus, and right precentral gyrus (P < 0.005, no correction). The ALFF\nvalues in the right inferior temporal gyrus (P = 0.027), left middle occipital gyrus\n(P = 0.005), left superior occipital gyrus (P = 0.011), and right superior parietal\ngyrus (P = 0.043) were positively associated with MoCA.\nConclusion: We found that acupuncture modulates the functional activity of\ntemporal, occipital, and parietal regions of the brain in CSVDCI patients.\nKEYWORDS\ncognitive function, acupuncture, small vessel disease, fMRI, brain activity\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "CSVDCI is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), accounting for approximately 74% of all occurrences (Rao et al., 2009). It is not commonly known that CSVDCI is an important subtype of VCI due to its quiet onset and lack of prominent clinical features (Brookes et al., 2014), also representing the primary clinical manifestation of CSVD. CSVDCI shows a similar pattern of cognitive decompensation to the VCI, which is characterized by reduced executive function, attention, and information processing speed, with relatively intact memory function in the early stages and gradual development of dementia (Chen et al., 2019). In addition, cognitive impairment worsens with the development of the disease, which severely impacts patient quality of life.\nEarly management of CSVDCI can enhance cognitive performance and patient quality of life, while partially slowing the course of cognitive decline. Several conservative treatments, including the use of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist were proposed for the symptomatic treatment of dementia (Arvanitakis et al., 2019). However, a limited number of targeted drugs effectively improved cognitive function in CSVDCI patients (Pantoni, 2010), with minimal efficacy for dementia (Bath and Wardlaw, 2015). Interestingly, acupuncture has been widely used in China as a complementary alternative treatment for dementia, and also been accepted for VCI treatment in Western medicine (Ji et al., 2021). The main advantage of acupuncture is the lower incidence of adverse effects that characterize pharmaceutical approaches (NIH Consensus Conference, 1998; Kim et al., 2019). Importantly, clinical randomized trials demonstrated the short-term impact of acupuncture on cognitive function in VCI patients (Yang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021).\nWith an increasing understanding of the etiological basis of CSVD in the elderly population, inflammatory responses have been associated with its development and progression (Li et al., 2020). Wang et al. demonstrated that acupuncture attenuates inflammation-related cognitive impairment in experimental vascular dementia (VD) by inhibiting the miR93-mediated TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Wang et al., 2020). In addition, acupuncture reduces oxidative stress and inflammation associated with TXNIP, plays a neuroprotective role in VD rats (Du et al., 2018), enhances cognitive function and induces neuroprotective effects against inflammation in CCH rats by activating \u03b17nAChR and the JAK2-STAT3 pathway (Cao et al., 2021).\nVarious ancient and modern acupuncture publications showed the Shenting (GV24) and Baihui (GV20) are vital distal acupoints associated with the cure of dementia, dizziness, headache, among other brain diseases. Huang et al. (2015) conducted a meta-analysis study that included 1,637 subjects with post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), and found that integrating Shenting and Baihui acupuncture with computer-assisted cognitive training significantly improves attention deficits in stroke patients. Similar results were found in a randomized controlled trial of 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design conducted by Yang S. et al. (2014).\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been extensively employed to investigate the functional\nmechanisms underlying a variety of neurological diseases, and may also provide insights on the ability of acupuncture to improve cognitive performance (Cai et al., 2018). Measurements such as functional connectivity (FC) and degree centrality (DC) were created to mimic the brain network (Park and Friston, 2013). Zang et al. (2007) suggested ALFF to estimate regional brain activity and found it could represent the activity of different brain regions at the resting state. In addition, abnormal ALFF levels were found in people with cognitive problems and abnormal brain function, a powerful determinant of cognitive decline (Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Zhang J. et al., 2021), and different brain regions, including the parietal, insular and cingulate regions. This is significantly correlated with cognitive function in patients with subcortical vascular cognitive dysfunction, which may lead to decreased cortical activation (Li et al., 2015). CSVDCI patients with cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) have altered spontaneous brain activity of the default, sensorimotor, and fronto-parietal lobe networks, that may impact potential neurophysiological mechanisms of intrinsic brain activity (Feng et al., 2021).\nSince 1990, an increasing number of studies used imaging to explore the physio-pathological mechanisms of acupuncture for the treatment of disease (Dhond et al., 2007). Acupuncture improves cognitive function in patients with Parkinson and increases ALFF values of the default network, visual network, and insular lobe. This has led to the hypothesis that acupuncture can activate the cerebellum-thalamus-cortex loop by regulating the spontaneous activity of the brain in key regions, a neurophysiological mechanism to improve cognitive dysfunction (Li Z. et al., 2018). Moxibustion therapy can improve the cognitive function of patients with mild cognitive impairment by adjusting the ALFF values of the default, visual and subcortical networks (Lai et al., 2022), and might thus reveal the brain regions involved in cognitive function improvement through acupuncture.\nHere, we examined the differences in ALFF values between the Shenting/Baihui acupoints and conventional drug treatment in CSVDCI patients, before and after treatment (in 12 weeks), to uncover the associated neural mechanisms."

The protocol was approved by the research ethics committee of the Zhongshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (reference: 2017ZSZY-LLK-219). We recruited CSVDCI patients at the neurology outpatient and inpatient departments. All participants signed an informed consent form prior to enrollment.\nPatients with the following conditions were considered eligible: (i) age between 40 and 80 years, (ii) comply with diagnostic imaging criteria for cerebral small vessel disease and vascular cognitive impairment, (iii) MoCA score between 10 and 26, (iv) not receiving regular acupuncture treatment for the recent six months.\nPatients with the following conditions were excluded: (i) cognitive dysfunction caused by macrovascular, cardiogenic cerebral embolism, (ii) patients with severe speech, vision,\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\nor hearing impairments or mental disorders that impact cognitive examinations, (iii) cognitive dysfunction caused by neuropsychological disorders (e.g., depression), (iv) illiterates that could not cooperate with cognitive examinations, (v) prior alcohol and drug abuse experience, (vi) combination of serious diseases, including of the cardiovascular, hepatic, nephrology, endocrine system and hematopoietic systems, (vii) participating in other clinical trials.\nThe CSVD patients were diagnosed according to the Neuroimaging Standards for Research into Small Vessel Disease (Wardlaw et al., 2013). Specifically, the diagnostic standard for imaging of CSVD included: (i) Recent small subcortical infarct: Axial views showing an infarct diameter smaller than 20 mm, which could be larger than 20 mm in the coronal or sagittal views, (ii) Lacunes of presumed vascular origin: round or ovoid, 3\u201315 mm in diameter, distributed in subcortical regions, filled with the same signals as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), (iii) white matter hyperintensity (WMH) of presumed vascular origin: abnormal brain white matter (WM) signals, lesions of variable size, showing a high signal on the T2-weighted or T2-weighted FLAIR images. (iv) Perivascular space: the signal of perivascular space was the same as that of the CSF in all MRI sequences. The shape was linear when the image plane ran parallel to the blood vessels and round or oval when running perpendicular to the vessels, usually smaller than 3 mm in diameter, (v) Cerebral microbleeds, which were defined as the following changes in the images obtained with T2\u2217-weighted gradient-echo sensitive to magnetizing effects. For example: (1) small round or oval, clear boundary, homogeneity, lack of signal focus; (2) diameter of 2\u20135 mm (maximum 10 mm) and lesion surrounded by the brain parenchyma; (3) brain atrophy: reduced brain volume not associated with specific focal lesions, such as trauma and cerebral infarction.\nThe sample size was estimated using the Gpower3.1 software. The MoCA total score was used as the main impact indicator. Based on previous studies (Wang et al., 2016), which estimated the MoCA difference for VCI patients treated with acupuncture as 5.5 \u00b1 2.2, and the MoCA difference for the control group as 3.1 \u00b1 1.8. The Gpower3.1 software estimated the effect value for acupuncture to improve cognitive function in VCI patients to be 1.194045, whereby we set the \u03b1 value to 0.01, the Power (1-\u03b2) value to 0.9, and the effect value to 1.194045, which was calculated using a sample size of 23 cases per group. With a shedding rate of 20%, we predicted a total sample size of 56, with 28 cases per group.\nA total of sixty patients were enrolled after screening for eligibility, and were randomly allocated to either the acupuncture or conventional treatment groups. At the baseline, all patients underwent fMRI. We removed 11 and 5 patients from the conventional and acupuncture groups, respectively, due to excessive head motion or rejection of the second fMRI scan."

According to our findings, and in contrast to conventional treatments, acupuncture at Shenting and Baihui significantly improved the cognitive function of patients. Importantly, we found an increase in spontaneous activity in regional brain areas, such as the right inferior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal gyrus.\nBy comparing ALFF changes with those observed in the control group, we found that acupuncture combined with conventional treatment increased ALFF values of the right inferior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left insula, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, right cerebellum, right precuneus, and right precentral gyrus in\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nCSVDCI patients. This suggests that acupuncture at Shenting and Baihui may improve cognitive function by enhancing neuronal excitability in some brain regions of CSVDCI patients.\nThe inferior temporal gyrus is located in the temporal lobe. The structures in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, the internal olfactory and perirhinal cortex, and parietal hippocampal cortex, are important elements of long-term memory processing (Lech and Suchan, 2013). Wu et al. (2017) found that the combination of acupuncture and conventional treatment significantly improves motor and cognitive functions in stroke patients, and increased Reho values in the middle temporal gyrus. According to the authors, acupuncture may have a specific mechanism of action. PET technology showed that acupuncture points, such as Baihui, significantly increased glucose metabolism in the temporal and frontal lobes, improving cognitive function (Huang et al., 2007). Combined with our findings, the evidence supports that acupuncture of Shenting and Baihui significantly improve temporal lobe glucose metabolism levels, enhance energy supply, and increase local neuronal activity in CSVDCI patients, thus improving temporal lobe related cognitive functions.\nBoth the middle and superior occipital gyrus are part of the occipital lobe, an essential component of the visual center that transmits spatial information to the parietal lobe, which conveys the integrated spatial information to the prefrontal lobe, eventually forming spatial memory in the prefrontal area (Andersson et al., 2019). Previous studies found that the size of the white matter lesion volume in the occipital lobe in MCI patients is negatively correlated with cerebral blood flow, suggesting that decreased cerebral blood flow in the occipital lobe may lead to lesions in occipital lobe structures and to a decrease in cognitive function (Kim et al., 2020). According brain neuroimaging studies metaanalysis (Cao et al., 2020), the occipital lobe plays a role in the pathophysiology of dementia, suggesting it should be a target region for scalp acupuncture for treating dementia. Acupuncture of Shenting and Baihui improved executive function and visuospatial localization in CSVDCI patients, and their improvement was also correlated with improved spontaneous activity in the occipital lobe region.\nThe parietal cortex is an interesting part of the association cortex. Throughout modern neuroscience research, this region has been associated with a wide range of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions (Freedman and Ibos, 2018). Functional magnetic resonance imaging has been widely used to study the effects of acupuncture on neural activity. A study on functional MRI in MCI patients suggested that acupuncture increases functional connectivity between the parietal lobe and other cognitively relevant areas (Tan et al., 2017). Conversely, acupuncture increased Reho values of the parietal lobe in MCI patients. Hence, it is possible that that acupuncture also improves the regional homogeneity of different delicate structures in the parietal gyrus and increases spontaneous brain activity (Liu et al., 2014). Zhang J. et al. (2021) found that acupuncture reorganizes cognition-related brain areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus, and the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and modulates post-stroke function and structural plasticity.\nAcupuncture is widely used to cure post-stroke hemiplegia, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, among others (Wang et al., 2018; Du et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). Li A. et al. (2018)\nexplored the activating effects of acupuncture on the brain of healthy individuals using fMRI techniques and found it activates the postcentral gyrus, the precuneus, and the temporal and occipital lobes. Our results further validate these findings and reinforce the fact that acupuncture positively impacts spontaneous activity in various brain regions of CSDVDCI patients. Specifically, significant brain responses were observed after acupuncture stimulation at Shenting and Baihui, as well as improved ALFF values of the right inferior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal gyrus, which were positively correlated with an improvement in cognitive function."
