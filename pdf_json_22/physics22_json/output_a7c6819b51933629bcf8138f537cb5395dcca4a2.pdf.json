    "abstractText": "Rheology serves to measure the deformation and flow of materials. Its associated quantities, for example, the Young\u2019s modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, or longitudinal modulus, are important in the biomedical field, in particular for soft materials, to characterize the response of materials to external force. Usually, mechanical probes, in particular rheometers or atomic force microscopy, are used to characterize these quantities. In the last decade, optical measurements have been derived to obtain these quantities even in small sample volumes. However, usually only one quantity is evaluated using optical techniques, such as Brillouin microscopy, which does not allow a full rheological characterization. The latter requires measuring at least two quantities, which allows for calculating all further rheological properties. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by combining two optical rheology methods, Brillouin microscopy to measure the longitudinal modulus and Laser Speckle Rheology for the shear modulus. We built an optical setup that allows the non-contact and hence non-destructive and non-invasive measurement of both quantities simultaneously in the same sample using a 780 nm, narrow linewidth (~50 kHz) laser system. We evaluate our approach using defined samples of glycerol and polydimethylsiloxane and we demonstrate image acquisition using the combined setup. We also investigate porcine corneae, as biological samples, and demonstrate direct measurement of longitudinal modulus and shear modulus and calculation of Young \u0301s modulus, bulk modulus, and the Poission ratio, which are all in good agreement with published quantities. In the future, our approach allows for full characterization of the rheology of biological specimens. INDEX TERMS Biomechanics, brillouin scattering, Cornea, Rheology, Speckle",

Usually, mechanical probes, in particular rheometers or atomic force microscopy, are used to characterize these quantities. In the last decade, optical measurements have been derived to obtain these quantities even in small sample volumes. However, usually only one quantity is evaluated using optical techniques, such as Brillouin microscopy, which does not allow a full rheological characterization. The latter requires measuring at least two quantities, which allows for calculating all further rheological properties. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by combining two optical rheology methods, Brillouin microscopy to measure the longitudinal modulus and Laser Speckle Rheology for the shear modulus. We built an optical setup that allows the non-contact and hence non-destructive and non-invasive measurement of both quantities simultaneously in the same sample using a 780 nm, narrow linewidth (~50 kHz) laser system. We evaluate our approach using defined samples of glycerol and polydimethylsiloxane and we demonstrate image acquisition using the combined setup. We also investigate porcine corneae, as biological samples, and demonstrate direct measurement of longitudinal modulus and shear modulus and calculation of Young\u00b4s modulus, bulk modulus, and the Poission ratio, which are all in good agreement with published quantities. In the future, our approach allows for full characterization of the rheology of biological specimens.\nINDEX TERMS Biomechanics, brillouin scattering, Cornea, Rheology, Speckle\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe elasticity is an important quantity of soft materials. In the field of biomedicine, it is, for example, applied to characterize implant materials, as control of corneal stiffness, or to further characterize tissue sections.[1]\u2013[3] In the future, it might become a further clinical parameter, for instance, in Keratoconus diagnosis where it can assist to assess the biomechanical state of the cornea.[4] Further, it can be applied in therapy, for instance, to measure the degree of cross linking and to assess the process of cross linking\nitself, with the ultimate aim to adapt cross linking protocols to the patient\u2019s needs.\nUsually, rheological characterization of the elasticity of materials is performed using mechanical rheometers. These exert stress on the material to measure its deformation and calculate the moduli from the stress-strain curve. To characterize the biomechanics of specimens, conventionally atomic force microscopy, optical coherence elastography, and ultrasonic methods are applied.[5]\u2013[9] The most important measurands in rheology are the Young\u00b4s modulus E, shear modulus G, bulk modulus K, and longitudinal\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Assuming isotropic tissue, only two of these quantities are necessary to calculate the others.\nIn the last decades, several optical methods, which allow to assess the rheological properties of materials have been developed. The idea of using optics has several advantages. Firstly, it enables a much higher spatial resolution. Secondly, the required sample volume is smaller compared to conventional rheological measurements. Thirdly, it enables non-destructive or even non-contact measurement of the sample. The optical methods, which have been applied to characterize cells and tissue-like structures include Optical Tweezers, Optical Coherence Elastography, Laser Speckle Rheology (LSR), and Brillouin Microscopy (BM).[1], [8], [10], [11]\nBM was first applied in material sciences and was later transferred to biological samples by Scarcelli et al..[12], [13] A Brillouin microscope measures the frequency shift of a narrow linewidth laser, which is generated by the interaction of the laser photons with acoustic phonons in the sample. If a photon interacts with an acoustic phonon, the phonon and photon may be destroyed and a new photon with higher energy originates. This is called the anti-stokes shift. Also, the photon can be destroyed so that a phonon and a photon with lower energy originates. This is called stokes-shift. The difference between stokes and anti-stokes-shift to the original laser frequency are equal and dependent on the laser frequency, the refractive index, the velocity of sound in the sample, as well as on the scattering angle. With this information, it is possible to calculate the longitudinal modulus of the sample M = \u03c1 \u22c5 ((\u03c5B \u22c5 \u03bb)/(2 \u22c5 n))2, whereby \u03c1 is the density, \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser, \u03c5B the Brillouin shift and n is the refractive index of the sample. [1], [14] Today, several improvements of the initial technique exist, for instance, using different acquisition modalities (tandem Fabry-Perot-Interferometer, virtually imaged phased array (VIPA), two-stage VIPA) or by the application of stimulated Brillouin scattering.[12], [15]\u2013[17] BM has also found wide application in biological sciences and has, for instance, recently been used to analyze spinal cord repair in zebrafish larvae.[18]\nViscoelastic properties from dynamic light scattering was first measured by Thomas G. Mason and David A. Weitz.[19], [20] They combined the theory of Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy with the General-Stokes-Einstein equation to calculate the absolute value of the frequency dependent viscoelastic shear modulus |G*(\u03c9)| = |G'(\u03c9) + i \u22c5 G''(\u03c9)|. This is a complex number consisting of storage modulus G'(\u03c9) and loss modulus G''(\u03c9). The storage modulus indicates the stiffness and described by the ratio between strain and deformation. The loss modulus represents the viscosity of the sample. The group of Nadkarni et al. extended this to the Laser Speckle Rheology technique.[21] Here the viscoelastic shear modulus is calculated from laser speckle images. The sample\nis illuminated with a coherent light source. The backscattered light is strongly influenced by Brownian motion in the sample, which generates a time-varying interference pattern, called laser speckle.[22] A fast Camera (>100 fps) takes a series of images for a duration of ~2 s. With the second order autocorrelation function g2(t), the Mean-SquareDisplacement (MSD) <\u0394r2(t)> is calculated and thereby the viscoelastic shear modulus. The applicability of LSR is found in material and biological science and can be used to evaluate the elasticity of hydrogels or coronary plaque.[23], [24] Mason and Weitz derived the theory for purely viscous fluids, it is important to note that the application on viscoelastic samples is just an approximation.[19] In this work only the storage modulus, also termed shear modulus, is determined.\nBoth, BM and LSR provide a single rheological quantity, similar to the other optical rheological techniques. Since two known quantities are sufficient for a full rheological characterization, we aimed to build a combined setup for BM and LSR, which allows the concurrent acquisition in the same sample using the same laser source. We used this setup to characterize defined chemical samples of glycerol and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Additionally, we show its applicability to analyze porcine corneae. Both techniques can be applied for point acquisition but also in laser-scanning mode, which is additionally demonstrated."

The combination of a halfwave plate and a polarizing beam splitter (PBS1) cube allows for controlling the laser intensity on the sample. An Etalon (OP-7423-6743-2, LightMachinery Inc., Canada) is used for better suppression of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The laser is scanned over the sample using a galvo-system (GVS012/M, Thorlabs, US). The galvo-system is controlled with a DAQ (USB-6003, National Instruments, US) and a customized Labview (National Instruments, US) code. The quarter-wave plate in front of the objective lens serves to change the linearly polarized laser light to circular polarization on its way to the sample and finally to linearly polarized light again with perpendicular orientation on its way to the detection units.

A typical acquisition of a single point for LSR involves the capture of 2000 frames with a framerate of 325 fps and a size of 480 px x 480 px.\nIn the Brillouin detection unit, PBS2 separates the backscattered light, which underwent a polarization change of 90\u00b0 by passing the quarter-wave plate two times, from the incoming light. The spectrometer consists of a 85Rb-vapor cell, which is heated up to 70 \u00b0C to suppress the Rayleigh signal. After the cell, there is a telescope pinhole construction, with a four times magnification of the beam waist. With a 300 mm cylinder lens, the beam is focused into the VIPA and a 1000 mm lens transforms the VIPA output into spectrally and spatially resolved signals onto the camera (Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus, Oxford Instruments plc, UK). Typically, a Brillouin spectrum with 1 s to 2 s exposure time is collected at every point.\nThe two detection units allow for measuring Brillouin signal and laser speckle without changing the setup or moving of the sample."

This serves to validate the alignment of the setup, to avoid temporal fluctuations, and to calibrate the Brillouin measurements.

Because of this, the number of frames must be greater than the length of the curve in frames added to the number of the start points. The equation is transformed into the timedependent MSD of the Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy theory and approached with a logistic fit. To do this, we use the standardized autocorrelation curve (g2(t))/(g2(0)) with the wavenumber k of the laser and the refractive index n of the sample.

Its shear modulus varies in a range of 100 kPa to 3 MPa.[28] The longitudinal modulus depends directly on the longitudinal sound velocity, which ranges from 1050 m/s to 1219 m/s according to the molecular weight and the cross-link density. This results in an expected longitudinal modulus of 1.14 GPa to 1.54 GPa.[29], [30]\nGlycerol-water mixtures are well characterized by Nadkarni et al. and have previously been used to evaluate the LSR.[31] For a 90% :10% glycerol-water mixture, the shear modulus at 10 Hz varies between 10 Pa to 100 Pa.[31]\nThe expected Brillouin shift for water and glycerol are 5.12 GHz and 7.24 GHz, respectively.[32] To estimate a literature value of our mixture, we calculate the longitudinal modulus of water Mw and glycerol Mg from their Brillouin shift. Provided, that the expected longitudinal modulus of the mixture Mm can be calculated by 1/Mm \u2248 (1-\u03f5)/Mg +\u03f5/Mw , with the volume fraction of water \u03f5 \u22480.75 and the longitudinal moduli Mg= 4.65 GPa and Mw= 2.25 GPa of glycerol and water to Mm= 2.58 GPa.[33], [34]\nIn both samples, TiO2 particles (anatase) (Merck KGaA, Germany) with a size of around 200 nm were added to increase scattering for speckle acquisition.\nTo create the PDMS sample, a 1:10 ratio of curing agent and silicon (DOW Europe GmbH, Germany) doped with 0.25% w/w TiO2 is mixed and the sample is cured for three\nhours at 60\u00b0 C. To create a glycerol sample, a water glycerol mixture with 25% v/v glycerol is doped with 0.068% w/v TiO2. In total, 16 independent PDMS and glycerol samples were measured. In each sample, the longitudinal modulus and the shear modulus were evaluated at five different points. The median value of these five measurements was used to determine the longitudinal and shear modulus of a single sample, subsequently the moduli of all samples were averaged and the mean value was used for further statistics. For the calculations, for 25%-glycerol, a density of 1071 kg/m\u00b3 and a refractive index of 1.36 were used based on the literature.[35], [36] PDMS has a density of 1035 kg/m\u00b3 calculated from the volume and weight measurements and a refractive index of 1.39 [37]. The results of all samples and both moduli were visualized using the software OriginPro 2020 (OriginLab, US).

Dots represent outliers. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student\u2019s t-test. For image acquisition, a new PDMS sample was prepared, as explained above. A randomly selected hole is cut off in the sample and filled with a 12.5%-glycerol mixture, doped with 0.068% w/v TiO2 particles. At the transition of the materials, a scan area of around 200 \u00b5m x 200 \u00b5m in 20 \u00b5m steps was defined and both detection methods were applied. In the case of the speckle scan, at every point, 400 frames with a frame rate of 200 fps were captured. The autocorrelation function was averaged over 60 pixels x 60 pixels.

For 25%-glycerol, we obtained a longitudinal modulus of about 3.06 GPa and a shear modulus of about 0.159 kPa. In the case of PDMS, the longitudinal Modulus is 1.50 GPa, while the shear modulus results in 555 kPa. In particular, both moduli are significantly different between the samples (t-test, p<0.0001). The obtained values are in good agreement with our literature research, GPDMS: 100 kPa to 3 MPa, MPDMS: 1.14 GPa to 1.54 GPa, Gglycerol: 10 Pa to 100 Pa, Mglycerol: 2.58 GPa [28]\u2013[32]. The minor deviations are explained in the following. The theoretical M value of the 25%-glycerol is lower than the results of our experiment, which might be associated with unavoidable evaporation during sample measurement. The results of the shear modulus for our glycerol sample are higher than the values from Nadkarni et al. (10 to 100 Pa) which could be due to different raw materials or attributed to the lower frame rate of the CMOS camera in our measurements [31]. In addition, the concentration of the scattering particles could be lower, because a lower scattering coefficient might lead to a slower falling autocorrelation curve [31]. However, higher concentrations were not feasible, as the Brillouin signal would be too weak to measure with our setup. The measurements allowed us to calculate further rheological moduli, summarized in Table 3.1.\nTABLE I RESULTS OF 25%-GLYCEROL AND PDMS AND CALCULATED ADDITIONAL MODULI AND CORRESPONDING EQUATIONS.\nSample Equation[40] 25%-\nglycerol PDMS\nExperimental Data\nShear\nmodulus [kPa] G 0.159 555 Brillouin shift [GHz] \ud835\udf10B 5.89 4.29\nCalculated Data\nLongitudina l modulus\n[GPa] \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udf0c (\n\ud835\udf10B \u22c5 \ud835\udf06 2 \u22c5 \ud835\udc5b )\n2\n3.06 1.50\nDifference from\nPoisson\nratio\n\u0394\u03bd = 0.5 \u2212 \u03bd\n= 0.5 \u2212 \ud835\udc40 \u2212 2 \u22c5 \ud835\udc3a\n2 \u22c5 \ud835\udc40 \u2212 2 \u22c5 \ud835\udc3a\n2.59 \u22c510-8 1.84 \u22c510-4\nBulk\nmodulus [GPa] \ud835\udc3e = \ud835\udc40 \u2212 (4 \u22c5 \ud835\udc3a)/3 3.06 1.5 Young`s modulus\n[kPa]\n\ud835\udc38 = \ud835\udc3a \u22c5 (3 \u22c5 \ud835\udc40 \u2212 4 \u22c5 \ud835\udc3a)\n\ud835\udc40 \u2212 \ud835\udc3a\n0.476 1664.8\nThe results show, that a higher longitudinal or bulk modulus does not necessarily imply a higher shear or Young\u2019s modulus. For investigating materials, especially of different physical states, a full rheological characterization is necessary for comparison. If M is magnitudes larger than G, it is further possible to assume with high validity K\u2248M and E = (G\u22c5(3\u22c5M-4\u22c5G))/(M-G) \u2248 (G\u22c53M)/M = 3G. Additionally, we evaluated whether we can obtain a microscopy image with a full rheological analysis of a sample of PDMS and 12.5%-glycerol (see Fig. 5). The longitudinal modulus of PDMS was between 1.41 GPa and 1.72 GPa and the values of the 12.5%-glycerol varied between 2.34 GPa and 2.65 GPa. The PDMS values are in good agreement with our single point measurements and the values of the 12.5 %-glycerol are, as expected, lower than the values of 25%-glycerol in the single measurements.\nWith both methods, a two-dimensional measurement is possible and enables the calculation of two-dimensional images of the other moduli. This is shown in Fig. 5D with the Young\u00b4s modulus, representatively for all other moduli.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Both materials are good to distinguish because of the different TiO2 concentrations. The red dashed square marks the scanning area and the bright point in the middle is the central back reflection of the laser. B and C) A two-dimensional measurement of the longitudinal and shear modulus. In both scans the transition from PDMS to 12.5%-glycerol is well recognizable. D) The green map represents the calculated Young\u00b4s modulus. Each pixel is determined by the corresponding pixels from the longitudinal and shear modulus map.\nThe application of combined speckle and BM allows a more precise characterization of corneal stiffness.\nA clinical relevant setting of rheological characterization is the determination of corneal stiffness, for instance, to evaluate keratoconus. Therefore, as a proof-of-example, we examined porcine corneas and determined both longitudinal and shear modulus on both sides of the cornea in the central and peripheral regions, respectively (see Fig. 6 and 7). Because corneae are not isotropic and we measure the moduli just in one direction, the determined values are not generally valid. This have to be known when the results are compared with other measurements, but for this work it is not further relevant.\nFor the anterior side of the cornea, we obtained a longitudinal modulus of 2.63 GPa in the central region, and a statistically insignificant different value of 2.62 GPa in the peripheral region (p=0.61, t-test). For the posterior side of the cornea, we obtained a longitudinal modulus of 2.43 GPa in the central region, and a statistically insignificant different value of 2.45 GPa in the peripheral region (p=0.30, t-test). However, the central and peripheral anterior regions were statistically significantly different (p<0.001, t-test) from their posterior counterparts. Scarcelli et al. obtained corresponding measurements on the posterior and anterior sides of the cornea, which might indicate that the anterior part seems to be stiffer than the posterior part.[6] However, another reason for the lower longitudinal modulus in the posterior part could also be a higher degree of hydration.[33], [39] Other studies detected a higher hydration of the posterior part of the cornea for bovine and rabbits.[41], [42] This might affect the Brillouin signal.\nThe shear modulus of the anterior central region was 173.3 kPa, while the shear modulus in the peripheral region was statistically insignificantly different with 147.1 kPa (p=0.77, t-test). The posterior central region yielded a shear modulus of 715.2 kPa and a statistically insignificantly different peripheral shear modulus of 275.1 kPa (p=0.078, ttest). Again, the central and peripheral anterior regions were statistically insignificantly different (p<0.13, t-test) from their posterior counterparts. This indicates that the posterior part of the cornea is stiffer. The corneal posterior side contains the Descemet\u2019s membrane and the endothelium. This is in agreement with measurements on human and rabbit cornea, which also show a higher stiffness in these regions.[43], [44]"

The relative changes in\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

However, we also observed greater uncertainties, which demands a consequent statistical validation.\nFurther, we demonstrated the possibility for a full twodimensional rheological characterization with our setup. This enabled us to detect rheological differences with a spatial resolution of around 20 \u00b5m. However, this scanning approach currently requires long integration times limiting its applicability for many biological applications, especially if other factors such as sample hydration or sample movement influence the measurement.\nA drawback of speckle imaging is the necessity for scattering samples. A high scattering provides sufficient backscattered light such that high frame rates are possible or less laser power is needed. However, this also limits the applicability of the same sample for Brillouin microscopy, as in strongly scattering samples the Brillouin peak is weak.\nTherefore, currently, our approach cannot be generalized to all biological samples.\nA drawback of BM is the uncertainty, which is associated with the degree of hydration of the investigated sample. Our corneal measurements obtained by BM indicated that the anterior side seems to have a higher a higher longitudinal modulus than the posterior side. This is in contrast to our speckle analysis and studies on human and rabbit corneae.[43], [44] It might be attributed to the higher hydration of the posterior side. One limitation we did not mentioned in this analysis, is that we measure the shear modulus at a low frequency (10 Hz) and the longitudinal modulus in the GHz range.[1], [27] At the current state of the art, it is not possible to measure the shear modulus in the GHz range, because exposure times of less than one nanosecond would be needed.[22] On the other side, to the best of our knowledge, there is no way to measure the longitudinal modulus in a low frequency range or concluding these values from an optical Brillouin measurement. This needs to be addressed in future studies.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.
