This has been interpreted as being related to disruptions in daily routines and social life caused by pandemicrelated societal restrictions. Although the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the routines of all adolescents, not all adolescents developed insomnia in response to pandemic-related changes. A\u00a0 reduced ability to regulate negative emotions is associated with a higher risk of developing insomnia, yet it is not known if it is associated with higher levels of insomnia in adolescents. Cognitive reappraisal, which consists of changing the way one thinks about potentially emotion-inducing events, is effective in downregulating negative emotion. Expressive suppression, which is changing the way one behaviorally responds to emotion-eliciting events, can decrease a positive emotional experience but does not alter the experience of negative emotion. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between insomnia symptoms in typically developing adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression to regulate emotions. It was hypothesized that high levels of insomnia symptoms among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with more frequent use of expressive suppression and less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal when regulating emotions. Methods: 49 adolescents aged 11-16 (M= 13.43, SD= 1.67) participated in the study during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada (May 15 to June 30, 2020). The Insomnia Severity Index\n(ISI) was used to assess the severity of nighttime and daytime components of insomnia. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used to assess respondents' tendencies to regulate their emotions using cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression. Results: Higher ISI total scores were significantly associated with lower reappraisal scores on the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Conclusion: A higher level of insomnia symptoms among typically developing adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with less frequent use of emotional regulation strategy that is effective in downregulating negative emotion. Limitations:\u00a0Given the cross-sectional design of the study, it is not possible to determine causality. Support (If Any): CIHR 418638 to Reut GruberRGPIN-2015-04467\u00a0to Reut Gruber\n0495"

Many adolescents do not get adequate amounts of sleep each night, and chronic sleep disturbance has been associated with increased risk of several inflammatory diseases. However, the relationship between sleep disturbances and inflammation during adolescence is not well understood. In this study, we examined the relationship between specific features of sleep disruption and cytokine levels in adolescents. Methods: A total of 88 adolescents (18.36\u00a0\u00b1 0.51\u00a0years, 56.8% female) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a selfreported questionnaire used to assess subjective sleep quality over a 1-month time period. Blood plasma samples were obtained for each participant at the same timepoint to measure levels of proinflammatory cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Samples were assayed using a Meso Scale Discovery multiplex immunoassay. Linear regression models were used to test the effect of PSQI sleep latency, duration, efficiency, quality, disturbance, and total score on each cytokine level, while covarying for sex and body mass index. We corrected for multiple comparisons using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. Results: Overall, disruption in sleep was associated with distinct cytokine differences. Worse sleep, reflected by the PSQI total score and greater sleep disturbance, was associated with lower IL-6 levels (p=0.013, p=0.015, respectively), however theses associations were attenuated to a trend after FDR correction (q=0.083, q=0.092, respectively). Longer sleep latency was also associated with lower IL-6 (p=0.028), and IFN (p=0.016) levels, however these effects were also attenuated after FDR correction (q=0.138, q=0.094, respectively). Reduced sleep efficiency was associated with higher TNF (q=0.046) and CRP (q=0.021) levels. Conclusion: Our findings show that different components of sleep disruption have varying effects on cytokine release, resulting in an overall blunted immune response. This underscores the significant impact of sleep disturbances on perturbing immune function during this critical developmental period.
