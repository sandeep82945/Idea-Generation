    "abstractText": "The level of organizational self-esteem of employees, whether on the production line or as managers or directors of enterprises, does not only correlate with individual performance but has also become a key factor in determining the completion of team core tasks. Based on the theory of self-consistency, this study explores the correlation between negative workplace gossip and employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by revealing the intermediary role of workplace exclusion and poor-order atmosphere. A survey of 228 employees from enterprises in Shandong and Shanghai showed that negative workplace gossip exerted a significant negative impact on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, suggesting that negative workplace gossip reduces employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem in the context of Chinese organizations. In addition, workplace exclusion exerted a complete intermediary effect between negative workplace gossip and employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, and poor-order atmosphere perception played a partial intermediary role. This study uncovers the black box that negative workplace gossip affects employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem and has a strong enlightening significance for management practice.",

Based on the theory of self-consistency, this study explores the correlation between negative workplace gossip and employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by revealing the intermediary role of workplace exclusion and poor-order atmosphere. A survey of 228 employees from enterprises in Shandong and Shanghai showed that negative workplace gossip exerted a significant negative impact on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, suggesting that negative workplace gossip reduces employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem in the context of Chinese organizations. In addition, workplace exclusion exerted a complete intermediary effect between negative workplace gossip and employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, and poor-order atmosphere perception played a partial intermediary role. This study uncovers the black box that negative workplace gossip affects employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem and has a strong enlightening significance for management practice.\nKeywords: workplace negative gossip, workplace exclusion, poor-order atmosphere, organizational self-esteem, intermediary effect\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the new era, the objective of employees to enter the workplace is no longer simply to fulfill material needs but also to attain self-worth to attain spiritual satisfaction. In the complex and changeable market environment, employees\u2019 performance has always been a topic of concern in management and economics. Organizational self-esteem has a significant impact on employee performance (Pierce et\u00a0al., 1989). Employees with different levels of organizational self-esteem exhibit different performance in the enterprise. Employees with high-level organizational self-esteem are typically opinion leaders in the organization, and they have a strong sense of responsibility (Pierce et\u00a0 al., 1989). Usually, they come forward to exhibit their abilities at critical moments. When organizations face difficulties, they empathize with each other and have a strong sense of ownership and mission. Contrarily, employees with a low-level organizational self-esteem lack confidence in their ability and value and often have a low\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854520\nsense of organizational identity; thus, it is challenging to mobilize their enthusiasm for work and create better value for the enterprise.\nPrevious research mainly focused on the intermediary effect of organizational self-esteem (Yang et\u00a0 al., 2016; Li and Tian, 2017) and the impact of organizational self-esteem on employees\u2019 attitude and behavior (Korman, 1970; Ghosh et\u00a0al., 2012; Decoster et\u00a0 al., 2013; Gu and Yu, 2020), and few studies (Lu and Tu, 2014; Ahmed et\u00a0 al., 2021) focused on variables that affect organizational self-esteem. The research on the antecedent variables of organizational self-esteem primarily starts from two aspects: individual characteristics and organizational characteristics. For example, overall self-esteem, self-efficacy, need for success, organizational setting, organizational fairness, organizational ownership (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2009), and the quality of the exchange relationship between leaders and subordinates positively correlate with organizational self-esteem (Kong et\u00a0 al., 2020). Conversely, negative emotion, gender discrimination, and negative workplace gossip negatively correlate with organizational self-esteem (Ellwardt et\u00a0 al., 2012). Negative workplace gossip is common in many workplaces (Foster, 2004; Samnani and Singh, 2016; Du et\u00a0 al., 2017), however, as a negative workplace phenomenon, it might bring many adverse effects to enterprises and employees (Ming, 2018). Negative workplace gossip has three crucial characteristics: (i) it spreads quickly and is accompanied by a magnifying effect (Yue et\u00a0 al., 2015); (ii) the degree of its influence depends largely on the subjective perception of the person being gossiped (Persson et\u00a0 al., 2016); and (iii) negative workplace gossip is hidden, which makes it extremely challenging to trace the source of gossip (Beersma and Kleef, 2012). Some studies (Pierce et\u00a0 al., 1989; Samnani et\u00a0 al., 2014) proposed that negative workplace gossip often damages the emotional relationship between employees through the spread of negative information, which results in the occurrence of workplace exclusion. Conversely, individuals experiencing workplace exclusion decrease their psychological cognition and assessment of the organization because of the rupture of interpersonal relationships (Williams et\u00a0 al., 2005). In addition, some studies (Yue et\u00a0 al., 2015; Du and Zhu, 2018) reported that in the Chinese organizational context, a close relationship exists between employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem and the atmosphere of team order. As a negative organizational atmosphere, in the environment of a strong poor order, employees\u2019 perceived unfair treatment due to negative workplace gossip does not match their fair and just values, which is highly likely to cause employees\u2019 cognitive dissonance, which might lead to further reduction of employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Unfortunately, currently, the research on the impact of workplace negative gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem is still in its infancy (Du et\u00a0 al., 2017; Liu and Zong, 2019), and the correlation between negative gossip and many intermediary variables still lacks theoretical analysis and empirical test (Gkorezis et\u00a0 al., 2016; Du and Zhu, 2020). Although some studies (Jose et\u00a0al., 2015; Peng et\u00a0al., 2016) have explored negative workplace gossip, not much attention has been paid to the mechanism and boundary conditions of how it affects employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Self-consistency theory can provide an explanation for the relationship between workplace negative gossip and organizational self-esteem. The self-consistency theory was proposed by Aronson and Golden (1962) and held that a person\u2019s motivation was consistent with his sense of self-worth, and a person with a high sense of self-worth was mainly governed by selfenhancement motivation. According to the self-consistency theory, individuals strive to keep their self-cognition consistent with the expectations and comments of others, and their behavioral responses will be\u00a0consistent with their self-cognition (Wu et\u00a0al., 2020). Negative workplace gossip refers to the spread of negative comments or negative information that individuals perceive others to have made about them in the workplace. Negative workplace gossip can bring negative self-perception to the person being gossiped about. Such negative self-perception will make the employees who are gossiped about have a strong sense of rejection in the workplace, meanwhile, will make them more sensitive to the internal atmosphere of difference in the organization. Both of these two aspects have a negative impact on the perception of value and importance in the organization of employees who are gossiped about, resulting in a lower sense of organizational self-esteem. Overall, considering the significance of employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem to the whole organization or team, this study is based on the selfconsistency theory and constructs a multi-intermediary model in which negative workplace gossip affects organizational selfesteem. Specifically, the model discusses how negative workplace gossip affects employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, as well as the mediating effects of workplace exclusion and poor-order atmosphere perception. Different from previous studies, this study incorporated workplace negative gossip and employee organizational self-esteem into a unified research framework, and explored the influence relationship and internal mechanism. The contribution of this paper are as follows: (1) Empirically tests the effect of negative gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, which enriches the research content of organizational self-esteem. (2) Analyzes the impact path of negative gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, and further clarify the functional mechanism and boundary conditions of negative gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. (3) Introduces poor-order atmosphere, a variable of organizational environment influenced by Chinese culture, to empirically test the mediating effect of this variable on the impact of negative gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, providing a basic reference for relevant organizational management of the world."

Organizational self-esteem reflects the degree to which employees believe they can fulfill their\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854520\nneeds by playing a corresponding role in the organization (Pierce et\u00a0 al., 1989). In addition, it reflects whether individuals perceive their importance, value, and significance in the organization. Employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem inextricably correlates with the environment in which they work. According to the self-consistency theory, employees\u2019 self-concept is influenced by influential others in the organization. When people handle information, they selectively associate it with self-concept based on the influence of information on selfworth and self-perception.\nIn an organization, gossip is the main tool to fortify informal employee relations. Such \u201cnegative informal evaluative conversation in an organization about another member of the organization who is not present\u201d is called negative workplace gossip (Mccaughey et\u00a0 al., 2013; Yue et\u00a0 al., 2015). The existing studies investigated the antecedents of negative workplace gossip, such as the value of individual factors, and the level of organization (Ellwardt et\u00a0 al., 2012) and organizational integrity, power structure, and so on. Some studies (Richman and Leary, 2009; Jose et\u00a0 al., 2015; Du and Zhu, 2018) claimed that negative workplace gossip is a type of damage to employees\u2019 social relations, and it is challenging for employees who are surrounded by this negative gossip to trust others or establish a good cooperative relationship (Wu et\u00a0 al., 2018). Meanwhile, negative workplace gossip exerts a great negative impact on employees, such as decreasing employees\u2019 work efficiency and job satisfaction. The disadvantages to their team far outweigh the benefits. In the existing research, few studies (Du and Zhu, 2020) investigated the negative workplace gossip from the perspective of the gossiped. In addition, we\u00a0 know very little about how negative workplace gossip affects work-related behavior, especially the process in which perceived negative workplace gossip might affect employees\u2019 organizational selfesteem (Brady et\u00a0 al., 2017). According to the self-consistency theory, the perception of negative workplace gossip essentially depicts the belief that other members of the organization have a negative view of the person being gossiped, which indicates that negative workplace gossip might negatively affect employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Hence, the following assumption is proposed:\nH1: Negative workplace gossip exerts a significant negative effect on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem.\nThe Intermediary Role of Workplace Exclusion Workplace exclusion implies that employees deliberately ignore or crowd out other members in the workplace, including silent treatment, turning a blind eye and avoiding eye contact (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2016). As a negative behavior, this phenomenon is standard in the workplace. It has the following crucial characteristics: first, workplace exclusion is a subjective feeling that employees can perceive, which has nothing to do with the objective existence of exclusion or the repeater\u2019s motivation (Hitlan and Noel, 2009). Even if the colleagues around them are not deliberately isolated and excluded, as long as the\nemployee subjectively feels overlooked or excluded, this constitutes workplace exclusion (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2008). Second, workplace exclusion is characterized by the exclusion or neglect of individual employees, such as intentionally hiding useful information, disregarding treatment (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2008). Third, the sources of workplace exclusion are complex and diverse, not only from within the team, including colleagues and bosses (Brady et\u00a0 al., 2017), but also from outside the team, even in the virtual world or when told by others to be\u00a0excluded (Kong and Li, 2019). Workplace exclusion and negative workplace gossip are both forms of workplace bullying, but there are obvious differences and connections between them. Workplace bullying refers to a situation in which an employee is subjected to frequent and long-term negative behavior from a supervisor or colleague, and the imbalance between formal and informal power makes it difficult to resist and retaliate. The perpetrators of workplace bullying and workplace exclusion can come from different levels of the organization, and both have a negative impact on the object. When workplace exclusion causes persistent and repeated injury to the object, workplace exclusion becomes workplace bullying. Workplace exclusion and negative workplace gossip can both come from superiors and co-workers. However, different from workplace exclusion, the object of negative workplace gossip is not present (Yue et\u00a0 al., 2015). In addition, Ferris et\u00a0al. (2008) pointed out that out-of-the-loop perceptions are subjective perceptions of external relationships. Then, when employees interpreted spiritual leadership behaviors in this context based on their perceived exclusion from leaders or colleagues. Workplace exclusion can make the excluded employees feel that they are not accepted by the organization, thus reducing their organizational identity, especially in the typical relationsoriented social context like China (Wu et\u00a0 al., 2010). As a standard phenomenon of \u201ccold violence\u201d in the workplace, although workplace exclusion is not as intense and direct as other negative behaviors, its negative impact is even worse (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2019), which not only seriously affects the individual\u2019s psychological state, such as threatening the individual\u2019s basic psychological needs and awakening the individual\u2019s negative emotions (Jiang et\u00a0 al., 2011), but also exerts a negative impact on the individual\u2019s work attitude. In addition, cold violence reduces individual work commitment and organizational commitment, and even reduces individual prosocial behavior, initiative behavior, and induces negative work behavior (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2016; Wu et\u00a0 al., 2016b). Thus, whether such behavior is intentional or not, as long as individuals feel excluded, it causes destructive consequences to their physical and mental health and exerts a significant impact on their cognition, emotion, and behavior (Yang and Treadway, 2018).\nSome studies (Smart and Leary, 2009; Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2016) claimed that negative workplace gossip is a type of social damage to employees, and employees surrounded by this negative gossip find it difficult to trust others or establish a cordial relationship, and is more likely to be\u00a0 ostracized by other organizational members (Ellwardt et\u00a0al., 2012). Meanwhile, negative workplace gossip brings great side effects to employees, such as decreasing employees\u2019 work efficiency, job satisfaction, and organizational self-esteem. According to the self-assessment\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854520\nperspective, people in an organization consider their values and roles as part of their self-concept, and comments from other colleagues are one of the external sources of information for self-assessment (Li and Ling, 2011). In contrast, employees who have a negative impact on negative workplace gossip tend to combine external negative assessment with their own self-evaluation, thereby perceiving exclusion from members, which, in turn, exerts a negative impact on behavior. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs theory (Maslow, 2007) divides human needs into physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, respect needs and self-actualization needs from low to high. At present, many scholars at home and abroad (Hu, 2015; Jin and Luo, 2019) based on Maslow\u2019s theory of needs, made different exploration in enterprise management, education, cultural construction and other aspects, and believed that Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs created on the basis of humanistic psychology had begun to integrate into all aspects of social life. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs theory highlights that the needs respected in social interaction are people\u2019s high-level needs (Maslow, 2013), but workplace exclusion markedly suppresses people\u2019s chances of acquiring these needs. When people feel isolated and excluded in the workplace, they tend to decrease mental effort to not spend more energy, thereby exhibiting negative interpersonal interaction behavior (Du and Zhu, 2020). As a result, workplace exclusion significantly reduces the excluded object\u2019s sense of belonging, self-esteem, and even existence significance, especially when the excluded object does not understand the reasons for exclusion. In addition, a sense of belonging and self-esteem are more hurt. Pierce et\u00a0 al. (1989) claimed that organizational self-esteem is created by individuals in interpreting and perceiving the behavioral motivation and attitude of organizational members, and it reflects the matching of organizational cognition and self-cognition to some extent. Thus, it can be\u00a0 inferred that if individuals lack positive feedback from organizational members, the components of their negative self-cognition will increase accordingly, while the degree of organizational self-esteem would decline correspondingly. Meanwhile, some studies (Zhang, 2021) highlighted through meta-analysis that organizational context is a crucial predictor of organizational self-esteem, and signals transmitted by organizational environment or team members, such as organizational support and organizational identity, are a critical source of employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem (Yu and Zhang, 2016). Workplace exclusion behavior is a type of serious negative feedback for individuals, which conveys negative signals from organizations on their cognition and evaluation; it makes employees feel that their value cannot satisfy the organization\u2019s expectations. Thus, it gives a negative adjustment to the cognition of individual self-worth, and then decreases the individual\u2019s perception of organizational self-esteem (Wu et\u00a0 al., 2010; Soltani et\u00a0 al., 2014; Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2020). Hence, we\u00a0 propose the following assumption:\nH2: Workplace exclusion plays an intermediary role in the correlation between negative workplace gossip and organizational self-esteem."

            "heading": "Differential Atmosphere Perception",
            "text": "Differential atmosphere refers to the difference in the relationship between near and far formed by an organization members centered on the person who holds organizational resources (Peng and Zhao, 2011). In China, the differential treatment in the differential atmosphere will results in different degrees of resource allocation for employees. Employees who perceive the atmosphere of organizational differentiation will have feelings of marginalization (Luo et\u00a0al., 2016), thus affecting the psychology and behavior of employees. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the relationship between negative workplace gossip and organizational self-esteem from the perspective of organizational differential atmosphere. Differential atmosphere denotes the consensus level of organizational self-esteem. In Western culture, the leadership formed in the organization\u2014the differentiation of member exchange relationships\u2014is similar to the Chinese circle culture, but the differential atmosphere clearly shows the role of non-work relationships in the workplace (Shen et\u00a0al., 2019; Kong et\u00a0al., 2020). Managers in organizations are based on their loyalty and to treat and interact with employees with their intimate relationships. Employees in the organization exert a crucial impact on the perception of differential atmospheres in the workplace owing to these differential management behaviors, as well as exert a crucial impact on behavioral guidelines, thinking, and management operations in daily work. For instance, in the enterprise led by the Chinese, there exists a phenomenon that treats the subordinates, and they divide their employees into two people outside the circle, and a difference exists in resource allocation and emotional communication. This way, when the layer structure is formed, it is easy to create a dense or light workplace differential atmosphere (Han and Shen, 2018). The differential atmosphere in the workplace essentially depicts the distribution of resources and even power in the organization, which plays a vital role in organizational operation (Kong et\u00a0 al., 2020). For instance, an intense workplace differential atmosphere exerts a serious negative impact on the cohesiveness of the team and hinders its integration and collaboration to some extent, ultimately affecting the innovative ability of the organization and performance (Xue, 2017; Huang et\u00a0 al., 2018). \u201cCircle\u201d can often get more opportunities and resources in the workplace, as well as have higher upper and lower values match and loyalty to managers. \u201cLandscapes\u201d is perceived by the inclination of internal resource allocation, which is marginalized in tissues, which, in turn, leads to further enhancement of pressure (Lin et\u00a0 al., 2017).\nIn the environment of poor organizational order, employees\u2019 perceived unfair treatment due to negative workplace gossip does not match their fair and just values (Redding, 1990; Liu et\u00a0 al., 2009), which is highly likely to cause employees\u2019 cognitive dissonance. The sense of unfairness in the organization, such as resource tilt, interpersonal conflict, and emotional antagonism, further escalates stress and even in the workplace (Neubert et\u00a0al., 2008). In organizations where the poor-order atmosphere is relatively weak, employees might enhance their perception of matching their superiors\u2019 values because they perceive an atmosphere of fairness and justice (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015). Meanwhile, the perception\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854520\nof these positive emotions is internalized into recognition and support from the organization, which positively enhances employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem (Mcallister and Bigley, 2002). Quite the reverse, in organizations with a strong poor-order atmosphere, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d are easy to form a state of hostility because of the bias in the allocation of resources and the closeness of the interaction between superiors and subordinates (Wu and Peng, 2018). Owing to the \u201cfavor\u201d of managers, \u201cinsiders\u201d think that their power space is constantly expanding, which leads to identity deviation. According to the focus adjustment theory, employees who are \u201coutsiders\u201d or on the edge of the center of power lower the sense of security among colleagues because of biased treatment, resulting in a stronger sense of unfairness and stress. In turn, it negatively affects employee\u2019s organizational selfesteem (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2009; Ling and Cheng, 2017; Wang, 2020). Hence, the following is proposed:\nH3: The perception of the differential-order atmosphere plays an intermediary role in the correlation between negative workplace gossip and organizational self-esteem.\nBy summarizing the above theoretical analysis and research hypothesis, we\u00a0can use the Figure\u00a01 to generalize and describe the relationship between the core variables studied in this paper.\nAs can be\u00a0 seen from Figure\u00a0 1, this paper mainly studies the impact of negative workplace gossip, workplace exclusion and the perception of the differential-order atmosphere on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Among them, negative workplace gossip has a direct negative impact on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, which is also the core hypothesis of this paper. From the perspective of the possible influence path, on the one hand, negative workplace gossip influences employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by strengthening workplace exclusion; On the other hand, negative workplace gossip has an impact on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by influencing their perception of the differential-order atmosphere."

The industry involves automobile production, machinery manufacturing, software development, electronic communication, biotechnology, research institutes and planning and design. The total fixed assets of all units are more than 50 million yuan, and the number of employees is more than 800. All employees work 5 days a week. This paper adopts online and offline data collection methods. When collecting online data, we\u00a0 sent the link of the electronic questionnaire to the person in charge of the corresponding enterprise by email for the employees to fill in. The collected electronic questionnaire was saved in a special computer folder with the help of software tools. For offline data collection, we\u00a0 collected questionnaires at the enterprise site. After completing the questionnaire, the respondents sealed the paper questionnaire in an envelope as required and saved it in the questionnaire recycling box. Before the formal survey, to augment subjects\u2019 understanding of the questionnaire as much as possible, a presurvey was conducted, and the questionnaire was revised and further improved per the feedback and suggestions of the members participating in the presurvey. To minimize the impact of common method bias on the research results, we\u00a0 collected data at three time-points at an interval of 1 month and measured the relevant demographic variables, including gender, age, education, position, length of service, and negative workplace gossip questionnaire, at the first time-point. At the second time-point, the measurement variables included workplace exclusion and differential atmosphere perception. At the third time-point, the measurement variable was employee organizational self-esteem. In the first survey, a total of 350 questionnaires were distributed, and 298 valid questionnaires were collected. One month later, 253 valid questionnaires were collected from the samples with contact information. After 1 month, the samples with contact information in the second survey were\nFIGURE\u00a01 | Theoretic analysis framework.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854520\ncollected for the third time, and a total of 228 valid questionnaires were collected, with a recovery rate of 65.14%.\nThe public sector and private sector accounted for 25% and 75%, respectively, in the sample. Regarding gender, women accounted for 50% and men accounted for 50%. According to age, most survey samples aged <40 years, of which 25% aged <30 years, 30.3% aged 35 years, 30.3% aged 36 years, and 24.1% aged 40 years. Regarding education, high school (including vocational high school) and below accounted for 4.8%, junior college accounted for 22.8%, undergraduate accounted for 38.2%, graduate students accounted for 32.0%, and doctoral students accounted for 2.2%. Most survey samples were employees at the production line, accounting for 62.3%, and those who had worked for >10 years in the enterprises to which they belong were the most, accounting for 32.5%.

Second, gender is negatively correlated with negative gossip. The possible reason is that female employees in organizations are more vulnerable to negative gossip in the workplace influenced by gender bias in Chinese traditional culture. Thirdly, education level is negatively correlated with negative gossip, showing that the higher the education level is, the less likely the employees are to be\u00a0attacked by negative gossip, while those employees with lower education level are vulnerable in the organization and are also vulnerable to the attack of negative gossip.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "From the viewpoint of negative workplace gossip and with the help of self-consistency theory, this study investigated the mechanism and boundary conditions of negative workplace gossip affecting employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem and constructed a multiple intermediary model. Through the three-stage survey data of a sample of 228 members of 7 teams, we\u00a0 found that\nnegative workplace gossip exerts a negative impact on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Workplace exclusion plays a complete intermediary role between negative workplace gossip and employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, and the perception of poor-order atmosphere plays a partial intermediary role.\nThe theoretical contribution of this study is primarily reflected in the following aspects: first, it expands the relevant literature on the influencing factors of organizational self-esteem. In the previous literature, many studies examined the role of variables such as employee self-efficacy (Pierce et al., 1989; Bowling and Eschleman, 2010), employee optimism (Lee, 2003), psychological resilience (Dumont and Provost, 1999) in affecting employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem from the standpoint of personal and organizational characteristics. Nevertheless, relatively few studies have been conducted on how negative workplace gossip affects employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Existing study (Yue et\u00a0 al., 2015) only theoretically analyzed the direct negative impact of negative workplace gossip on organizational self-esteem, and lacked empirical studies on its influencing relationship and internal mechanism. This study enriches the relevant research on the influencing factors of employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by examining the mechanism and boundary conditions of negative workplace gossip affecting employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. In addition, the results of this study (Table\u00a0 4) demonstrate that negative workplace gossip is not conducive to the establishment of organizational self-esteem of employees, and as a negative human\u2013computer interaction experience, negative workplace gossip is a crucial factor affecting employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem, which expands the explanatory boundary of the study that affects employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Second, it reveals the influence mechanism of negative workplace gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Some studies demonstrated that negative workplace gossip can affect employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by affecting organizational atmosphere, workplace exclusion, employees\u2019 psychological empowerment, and employees\u2019 organizational identity; this also provides some ideas for this study. Our findings (Table\u00a0 5) revealed that negative workplace gossip could significantly augment workplace exclusion in organizations, and then negatively affect employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Through relatively covert attacks, negative workplace gossip poses a serious threat to the mental and psychological resources of the gossiped, which makes them\nTABLE\u00a05 | Bootstrap analysis results of mediation effect.\nAction path\nDirect effect Mediation effect\n95% confidence interval 95% confidence interval\nEffect size Lower limit Upper limit Effect size Lower limit Upper limit\nNegative workplace gossip\u2192workplace exclusion\u2192employee organizational self-esteem\n\u22120.108 \u22120.230 0.014 \u22120.410 \u22120.530 \u22120.296\nNegative workplace gossip\u2192differential atmosphere perception\u2192employee organizational self-esteem\n\u22120.535 \u22120.617 \u22120.452 0.017 0.001 0.042\nNegative workplace gossip\u2192workplace exclusion, perception of bad order atmosphere\u2192employee organizational self-esteem\n0.122 \u22120.243 \u22120.002 \u22120.395 \u22120.515 \u22120.280\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 854520\ngradually rejected by most employees. The excluded employees are in a work atmosphere where they are not trusted and their work results are not valued, and lack of interpersonal connections with colleagues. As a result, work is difficult to meet their sense of belonging and the sense of value they experience and other needs, so that their organizational selfesteem is seriously hurt. Some scholars (Williams, 2007; Scott et\u00a0 al., 2013) came to the similar conclusions. This conclusion is a useful supplement and expansion of the existing research. Third, starting from the Chinese cultural context, this study examined the intermediary effect of the unique perception of differential-order atmosphere in Chinese culture. The research result (Table\u00a05) reveals that the perception of differential-order atmosphere in the organization partly mediates the correlation between negative workplace gossip and employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Negative gossip in the workplace can damage employees\u2019 physical and mental health and bring negative emotions (Yue et\u00a0 al., 2015; Du and Zhu, 2018) and enhance the perception of differential atmosphere to some extent. Employees will receive negative signals about injustice and feel less support from the organization and supervisor, forming negative ego in the workplace (Yu and Zhang, 2016), thus reducing organizational self-esteem. This discovery further enhances the explanatory power of the existing research framework to employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem.\nIn addition, the results in this paper verifies the negative effects of workplace negative gossip, but it is not consistent with the conclusions of some foreign scholars. For example, some scholars (Feinberg et\u00a0 al., 2014; Wu et\u00a0 al., 2016a) showed that employees who experienced workplace negative gossip would become more generous, show more cooperative behaviors and increase their contributions to the organization, and enhance the organizational self-esteem finally. The possible reason for these different conclusions above lies in the different effects caused by the cultural differences between China and the West. Influenced by Chinese traditional culture, the workplace negative gossip as a form of informal communication has become a natural part of Chinese enterprises, negative workplace gossip through a negative message by gossip is obstructive pressure source, and its damage to the organization atmosphere and interpersonal relationship, resulting in a loss of the employee organization self-esteem. The individual-centered differential pattern is the basic form of interpersonal communication in Chinese traditional culture, leading to the differential management atmosphere plays a negative role in the relationship between workplace negative gossip and organizational self-esteem.\nThe management enlightenment of this study primarily lies in the following. First, enterprises should focus on avoiding the negative impact of negative workplace gossip. In this study, negative workplace gossip was used as an independent variable to guide managers to comprehend the potential negative effects of negative workplace gossip from the employees\u2019 viewpoint. Besides, enterprises should introduce clear rules and regulations, fortify the personal management of employees, and minimize negative workplace gossip. Conversely, enterprises should strengthen the emotional construction between employees, establish a good communication mechanism, and strive to\ncontrol the breeding of negative workplace gossip from the source. Once negative effects emerge, managers should intervene in time to avoid further harm. For employees who are attacked by negative gossip, managers should pay timely and active attention to the emotional status of the gossips, and supplement the resources and energy of the employees by means of in-depth communication, personalized care and team building activities.\nSecond, considering the intermediary role of workplace exclusion between negative workplace gossip and employee organizational self-esteem, enterprises should focus on the ostracism among employees. Workplace exclusion behavior will not only create job problems for employees but also markedly hurt employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Thus, corresponding measures must be\u00a0taken to intervene reasonably. Moreover, organizational managers can prevent workplace exclusion by guiding employees to engage in fair competition. In addition, they should also try to avoid hiring employees with workplace exclusion tendencies. In contrast, when workplace exclusion occurs, managers should take positive protection and intervention measures to build a harmonious working environment and reinforce communication to alleviate the mental pain of excluded employees.\nThird, this study demonstrates that negative workplace gossip is universal and difficult to trace. The emergence of this phenomenon closely correlates with the organizational atmosphere, and the strong differential atmosphere nourishes the emergence of negative workplace gossip, especially in the special context of \u201ccircle\u201d culture. Thus, it is suggested that organizations should develop and maintain effective channels of information exchange and create a healthy, positive, and fair organizational culture. Essentially, organizations should fundamentally curb the emergence of workplace gossip. In addition, the existence space of differential atmosphere can be\u00a0 compressed through task arrangement and culture shaping. Improve the overall design of the organization and team work, clarify the task interface on the production value chain of the team, make the team members become an important link of value-added value, and guide the staff to complete the organizational tasks and innovation direction.\nFourth, pay attention to the different effects of negative gossip on organizational self-esteem caused by the differences between Chinese and Western cultures. Take corresponding management measures according to the internal reality of the enterprise. In the organization which oriental culture atmosphere is relatively strong, managers should pay attention to restrain the negative gossip in the workplace, at the same time, through the development object of organizational trust and fair management measures of organization atmosphere of difference expansion, maintain an atmosphere of fairness and justice within the organization."

Based on the self-consistency theory, this study explored the impact of negative workplace gossip on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem by constructing a mediating model and using 228 employee survey data. The findings are as follows: First, negative workplace gossip has a significant negative impact on employees\u2019 organizational self-esteem. Second, workplace exclusion was a complete mediator between negative workplace gossip and organizational self-esteem. Third, the perception of differential atmosphere plays a partially mediating role in the relationship between employees\u2019 organizational selfesteem and negative workplace gossip. On the one hand, this study helps to open the black box of the influence mechanism of negative gossip in the workplace, and provides theoretical support for further exploring the mechanism of the generation of organizational self-esteem in the context of negative cultural atmosphere. On the other hand, it is helpful for managers to properly intervene and manage negative gossip in the workplace, so as to improve the innovative performance of employees."

            "text": "Some limitations of this study and future research areas are as follows:\nFirst, the study has adopted mature and recognized negative workplace gossip, and the scale of China\u2019s cultural context remains in the exploration stage; however, there is a lack of clear classification standards considering the impact of the differences between Chinese and Western cultural differences. Thus, future research could develop a negative gossip table with higher reliability and a valid workplace in the context of China. Moreover, all measurements were self-reported in this study, raising the risk of general methods.\nSecond, the nature and size of the sample also limited universal research. We\u00a0 assume that some control variables, including education, position, and working age, would affect, but the results showed no significant correlation between them, which could be\u00a0owing to regional and scale restrictions. Besides, our study sample came from Shandong Province and Shanghai. Thus, future research could increase sample quantity and regional scope through cross-cultural research and choose different types of enterprises and employees.\nThird, this study explored the mediation of workplace exclusion and differential atmospheres from the standpoint of self-consistency theory; however, there could be\u00a0other potential intermediaries in this process. Regarding research design, other variables from employees or leadership could affect the organization of employees (such as psychological authorization, leadership membership, and leadership authorization). In the future, based on the alternative explanations of these variables, the conclusion of this study can be\u00a0 further confirmed."
