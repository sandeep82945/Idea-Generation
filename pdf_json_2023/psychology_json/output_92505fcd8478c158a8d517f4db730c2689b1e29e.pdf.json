    "abstractText": "2-Ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate (EMHPS, Mexidol) is an original antioxidant and an anti-ischemic drug with the possibility of wide applications in the complex therapy of diseases, accompanied by the development of oxidative stress and ischemia; for example, ischemic stroke, chronic cerebral ischemia, and chronic heart failure. The use of EMHPS in the complex therapy of the above diseases may cause the development of drug\u2013drug interactions, particularly pharmacokinetic interactions at the level of transporter proteins. In the present study, we evaluated the interaction of EMHPS with ABCB1 and SLCO1B1. In Caco-2 cells, it was shown that EMHPS is not a substrate of ABCB1 and that it does not affect its expression, but at the same time, it inhibits the activity of this transporter. Its inhibitory activity was inferior to verapamil\u2014a classic inhibitor of ABCB1. In HEK293 and HEK293-SLCO1B1 cells, it was shown that EMHPS is not a substrate of SLCO1B1 either, but that it inhibited the activity of the transporter. However, its inhibitory activity was inferior to the classic inhibitor of SLCO1B1-rifampicin. Furthermore, it was found out that EMHPS does not affect SLCO1B1 expression in HepG2 cells. The approach proposed by the FDA (2020) and the International Transporter Consortium (2010) was used to assess the clinical significance of the study results. The effect of EMHPS on SLCO1B1 and the systemic inhibition of ABCB1 by EMPHS are not clinically significant, but ABCB1 inhibition by EMHPS in the gastrointestinal tract should be tested in vivo through clinical trials.",

Structure of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate.\nThe antioxidant properties of EMHPS are caused by hydroxypyridine and are determined via its radical scavenging activity and the suppression of lipid peroxidation [3\u20135]. The succinate in the molecule of EMHPS is an energy-rich substrate, undergoing oxidation via succinate dehydrogenase in mitochondrial enzyme complex II. During ischemia, this oxidative process counteracts the reduction of mitochondrial enzyme complex I, thereby maintaining the synthesis of ATP [6]. Moreover, succinate can activate its specific receptors (SUCNR1) and initiate different metabolic cascades that increase tissue resistance to hypoxia [7].\nEMHPS is used for the treatment of acute disorders of cerebral circulation, craniocerebral trauma, encephalopathy, and a number of other diseases. In a randomized double blind multicenter placebo-controlled, parallel groups clinical trial (EPICA) on 151 patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke, it was shown that EMHPS administration improved the neurological status of patients compared with the placebo [8]. The statistically significant benefit of EMHPS over the placebo was confirmed through basic neurological tests in a multicenter, randomized double-blind trial including 318 patients with chronic brain ischemia [9]. A number of studies have also shown the possibility of using EMHPS in the complex therapy of chronic heart failure [10].\nThe use of EMHPS in the complex therapy of the above diseases may cause the development of drug\u2013drug interactions (DDIs), particularly pharmacokinetic interactions. During the development of the drug, it was shown that ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate is an inducer of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme [11], and the main route of its metabolism is the formation of glucuronoconjugate [12]. Therefore, the logical step in further research is to study its affiliation with the substrate/inhibitors/inducers of transporters.\nDrugs are transported by two superfamilies of transporters: single solute carrier (SLC) transporters and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. As they play crucial roles in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME), these drug transporters are of great pharmacological importance. Transporters take part in the transmembrane translocation of drugs in the intestine, liver, kidneys, and other organs [13]. Drugs can potentially compete with each other for binding the transporters, which can lead to unexpected changes in serum and tissue drug levels, and cause possible toxic side-effects.\nIn the current study, we evaluated the interaction of EMHPS with ABCB1 and SLCO1B1. ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein, MDR1) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter) family. ABCB1 is an efflux pump that uses the energy of ATP and transports a large number of compounds (structurally diverse) out of the cells [14,15].\nABCB1 is localized on the biliary membrane of hepatocytes, where it mediates the excretion of substrates into bile; on the luminal membrane of enterocytes, where it limits the absorption of drugs from the intestine; and on the luminal membrane of proximal renal tubule cells, where it promotes the renal secretion of drugs [16]. ABCB1 reduces the permeability of many pharmaceutical compounds across the blood\u2013brain barrier into the brain [17]. Thus, ABCB1 inhibitors are thought to enhance substrate absorption and to reduce their elimination [18].\nFigure 1.

Thus, ABCB1 inhibitors are thought to enhance substrate absorption and to reduce their elimination [18]. The organic anion-transporting polypeptide SLCO1B1, also known as LST1, SLCO1B1, OATP2, OATPC, SLC21A6, is a part of the SLC superfamily and is highly expressed on the hepatocyte basolateral membrane. SLCO1B1 mediates the sodium-independent uptake of drugs at the sinusoidal pole of hepatocytes [19]. Several studies have shown that SLCO1B1 is involved in DDI that leads to change the systemic exposure of its substrates [20]. Both ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 can be involved in DDI. Thus, a potential role of new molecules as ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 substrates or inhibitors is recommended for evaluation in vitro [21,22]. The effect of EMHPS on the activity and expression of ABCB1 in the gut has not been properly studied yet. Also, it is unknown as to whether EMHPS is a substrate of ABCB1. EMHPS is extensively metabolized in the liver to 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine glucuronide and 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine phosphate, which have no pharma-\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1529 3 of 15\ncological activity [12]. Since the liver plays an important role in the elimination of EMHPS, it is advisable to test whether this drug is an SLCO1B1 substrate or not. Studies testing the EMHPS effect on SLCO1B1 activity have not been conducted either. The aim of the work is to research EMHPS properties as a potential ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 inhibitor, and to further characterize EMHPS as a potential factor for altered drug disposition in humans. Also, in the study, we tested the affiliation of EMHPS to the substrates of these transporters. We used cell lines expressing the human transporters ABCB1, SLCO1B1 and fexofenadine, and atorvastatin as prototypical substrates of the respective transporters."

The ER was used to test the permeability through the Caco-2 cells monolayer. An ER of higher than 2.0 means an increase in the transport of the analyzed compound from the basolateral to the apical chamber with the involvement of efflux transporters (for example, ABCB1 or the breast cancer resistance protein\u2014ABCG2), while an ER between 0.5 and 2.0 means that there is no directed transport. There was no difference between transepithelial transport of EMHPS at all concentrations (10, 100, and 250 \u00b5M) from the basal-to-apical chamber, and from the apical-to-basal chamber.

            "text": "EMHPS is an original antioxidant and anti-ischemic drug with the possibility of wide application in the complex therapy of diseases, accompanied by the development of oxidative stress and ischemia [23]. The effectiveness of the use of EMHPS, particularly in the treatment of ischemic stroke, chronic cerebral ischemia, and chronic heart failure, was established [8\u201310]. Given the wide range of drugs used in the treatment of these diseases [24], there is a high probability of developing drug\u2013drug interactions involving EMHPS when it is included in the therapy. Therefore, in the current study, we have tested whether EMHPS belongs to the substrates and inhibitors of the main clinically significant transport proteins, ABCB1 and SLCO1B1. ABCB1 can recognize substrates with very different molecular weights. For example, it can transport small molecules such as cimetidine (MW 252) and small peptides such as Nacetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (MW 383), as well as large molecules such as cyclosporine A (MW 1203) and gramicidin D (MV 1882) [25]. SLCO1B1 also transports a wide range of substrates such as statins, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and several others [26]. It was shown that transport of EMHPS from the apical to the basolateral chamber was equivalent to transport from the basolateral to the apical chamber. The ER (the ratio of basal-to-apical transport to apical-to-basal transport) of EMHPS through the Caco-2 cells monolayer was around 1. These results indicate that the transport of EMHPS through the Caco-2 monolayer occurs without the participation of specific transporters, including ABCB1 [27]. Thus, EMHPS is not a substrate of ABCB1. Similarly, EMHPS is not a substrate of SLCO1B1. This is evidenced by the same EMHPS uptake in HEK293-SLCO1B1 and HEK293. At the same time, the uptake of the SLCO1B1 substrates (rosuvastatin, pitavastatin [28], or atorvastatin, in our research) is significantly higher in HEK293- SLCO1B1 cells rather than in HEK293 cells. Our study has also determined that EMHPS inhibits the activity of ABCB1 (the IC50 value of ER (Papp b-a/Papp a-b) of 150 \u00b5M of fexofenadine was 92.00 \u00b1 24.31 \u00b5M) and SLCO1B1 (the IC50 value of the inhibition of SLCO1B1-mediated uptake of 1 \u00b5M of atorvastatin was 12.1 \u00b1 7.64 \u00b5M). However, succinic acid had no effect on the studied transporters; thus, the inhibitory activity of EMHPS on ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 was due to the presence of hydroxypyridine in its molecule. The clinical significance of the study results can be assessed by the approach proposed by the FDA (2020) and The International Transporter Consortium (2010). For SLCO1B1, the ratio of Cmax of EMHPS in the blood plasma to the IC50 value was evaluated. If the value obtained is higher than or equal to 0.1, then this pharmacokinetic interaction between the test substances and SLCO1B1 substrates\u2014in particular, atorvastatin\u2014may be of clinical significance. The EMHPS Cmax is 0.39 \u00b5M [12]. The calculated value for Cmax/IC50 (0.39 \u00b5M/12.1 \u00b5M = 0.032) indicates that the effect of EMHPS on SLCO1B1 is most probably not clinically significant. EMHPS will not affect the activity of the studied transporters in the clinical practice; that is, they are safe drugs with regard to the development of drug\u2013drug interactions at the level of SLCO1B1. The obtained results are consistent with the ideas regarding the structures of clinically significant inhibitors of SLCO1B1 (IC50 < 10 \u00b5M). If a drug has a predicted clogP > 3.5 and \u22651 negatively charged atom, the compound is an SLCO1B1 inhibitor 94% of the time. The combination of clogP > 3.5 and \u22651 negatively charged atom provided a 25-fold enrichment of inhibitors compared to the original dataset distribution [29]. There are several approaches to translate the results of assessing the effect of test drugs on the activity of ABCB1 obtained in vitro to in vivo. Oral drugs can affect the activity of the transporter in the intestine, where the concentration is quite high, and influence ABCB1 in other organs and tissues, for which the concentration of the substance in the systemic circulation is important. Zhang et al. proposed that drugs exhibiting an [I]1/IC50 \u2265 0.1 or [I]2/IC50 \u2265 10 should be evaluated to determine whether inhibition occurs in vivo, where [I]1 is the mean drug steady-state total Cmax at the highest clinical dose, and [I]2\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1529 9 of 15\nis the theoretical maximal gastrointestinal drug concentration after oral administration, calculated as the highest clinical dose (mg) in a volume of 250 mL [21,30]. For EMHPS, [I]1/IC50 was = 0.39 \u00b5M/92.00 \u00b5M = 0.0042. It means that the systemic inhibition of ABCB1 by EMPHS is most probably not clinically significant. At the same time, [I]2/IC50 was (0.250 g/255 g/mol/0.25 L)/92.00 \u00b5M = 42.6. It means that an inhibition of ABCB1 by EMPHS in the gastrointestinal tract is most probably clinically significant. These results indicate the possible clinical significance of ABCB1 inhibition by EMHPS and the need for clinical studies of drug\u2013drug interactions between EMHPS and ABCB1 substrates, such as digoxin and dabigatran etexilate [31]. In the current study, it was shown that EMHPS is not an ABCB1 substrate, indicating that substrate inhibition of the activity of the transporter protein is unlikely. It can be assumed that the most likely mechanism of interaction was the allosteric inhibition of ABCB1 activity. This mechanism was previously described for drugs of the dihydropyridine series\u2014nicardipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine, and nifedipine [32]. Currently, three substrate binding sites (transported substances) and one allosteric site, called the M site, are isolated in the ABCB1 structure; the M site changes the activity of the transporter [33]. The M site cross-reacts with both halves of the transporter protein, being able to change its conformation and thus regulate the efflux of ABCB1 substrates. More recent studies have found that allosteric inhibitors (such as tariquidar) are able to disrupt the closure of the intracellular transmembrane domain, and in general, form corresponding changes in the structure, leading to difficulty in transporting the substrate from the cell to the outside [34]. The presence of a hydrogen atom bonded to a nitrogen atom located in the aromatic cycle, two alkyl residues in the ortho-position and an oxygen-containing radical in the meta-position (during the formation of a zwitterion) can justify the similarity of the reaction sites of EMHPS and the molecules of dihydropyridine derivatives."

The Transwell\u00ae system consists of two chambers, apical and basolateral. The bottom of the apical chamber (Transwell\u00ae insert) is a semipermeable membrane on which Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of about 60,000 cells/well, and grown for 21 to 23 days to reach confluence and to differentiate into enterocytes exhibiting transporter proteins and tight junctions. The medium was changed every 2\u20133 days. The apical and basolateral chambers represent the luminal and blood/mesenteric lymph sides of the gastrointestinal tract, respectively. Therefore, transport from the apical chamber to the basolateral is a model of substances absorption, and from the basolateral to the apical it is a model of intestinal efflux transporters work; for example, ABCB1 [37]. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across the cell monolayers was monitored using a Millicell-ERS (electrical resistance system) to assess cell monolayer integrity. For transport studies, only monolayers with a TEER > 500 \u2126 cm2 were used. The medium in chambers was removed and the cell monolayers were washed twice in warm (37 \u25e6C) transport medium (Hanks\u201a balanced salt solution containing 10 mM HEPES and 1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)). The apical (for apical to basolateral transport) or basolateral (for basolateral to apical transport) chamber were filled with an equal volume of pre-warmed transport medium containing EMHPS (50, 100, and 500 \u00b5mol/L). Chamber\u2013 recipient was filled with transport medium without EMHPS. At 60, 120, and 180 min, 100 \u00b5L samples were taken from the recipient chamber and the drug concentration was analyzed. EMHPS transport was assessed in the absorptive (apical to basolateral, a-b) and secretory (b-a) directions. The apparent permeability (Papp) of EMHPS through Caco-2 monolayers was calculated using Equation (1).\nPapp = dQ dt \u00d7 1 (A\u00d7 C0) (1)\nA, membrane surface area (1.12 cm2); C0, EMHPS concentration at t = 0 \u00b5M; and dQ/dt, amount of EMHPS transported within a given time period \u00b5M/s.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1529 11 of 15\nThe ratio of Papp (b-a) and Papp (a-b), known as the efflux ratio (ER), was calculated in accordance with the following Equation (2):\nER = Papp b-a Papp a-b\n(2)\nThe ER was used as a marker for permeability through Caco-2 cell monolayers. To assess the effect of EMHPS on the activity of ABCB1, we studied the transport of\nfexofenadine 150 \u00b5mol/L\u2014a transporter substrate through a monolayer of Caco-2 cells, and its change under the action of EMHPS at concentrations of 1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5M. To study the roles of different parts of the EMHPS molecule for its action on ABCB1, experiments with succinic acid were also carried out. As a positive control, verapamil (classic inhibitor of ABCB1) was used. EMHPS, succinic acid, or verapamil were added to both chambers (apical and basolateral), regardless of the direction of transport of fexofenadine. Prior to the transport experiments, the culture media was aspirated, and the monolayers were washed twice with transport medium and preincubated with EMHPS, succinic acid, or verapamil for 30 min.\nThe data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD from three monolayers."
