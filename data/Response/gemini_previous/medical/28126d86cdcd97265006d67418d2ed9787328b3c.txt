1. **Investigate the use of different deep learning architectures for ROI localization and segmentation.** The proposed framework uses SqueezeDeepLabv3+ for ROI localization and 3D-ARU for segmentation. However, other deep learning architectures could be explored to improve the performance of the framework. For example, one could investigate the use of U-Net, V-Net, or DenseNet for ROI localization and segmentation.


2. **Explore the use of different attention mechanisms for segmentation.** The proposed 3D-ARU architecture uses a spatial attention mechanism to improve the segmentation results. However, other attention mechanisms could be explored to further improve the performance of the framework. For example, one could investigate the use of channel attention, self-attention, or transformer-based attention mechanisms.


3. **Develop a method for segmenting the biventricular in the presence of artifacts.** The proposed framework is designed to segment the biventricular in the absence of artifacts. However, in clinical practice, CMR images often contain artifacts, such as motion artifacts, noise, and metal artifacts. These artifacts can make it difficult to segment the biventricular accurately. Therefore, it is important to develop a method for segmenting the biventricular in the presence of artifacts.


4. **Investigate the use of the proposed framework for segmenting other cardiac structures.** The proposed framework is designed to segment the biventricular. However, it could also be used to segment other cardiac structures, such as the left atrium, right atrium, and pulmonary veins. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the framework for segmenting these other cardiac structures.


5. **Develop a method for using the proposed framework to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.** The proposed framework could be used to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. For example, the framework could be used to identify patients at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, to monitor the progression of cardiovascular diseases, and to plan treatment for cardiovascular diseases. It would be interesting to investigate the use of the framework for these applications.
