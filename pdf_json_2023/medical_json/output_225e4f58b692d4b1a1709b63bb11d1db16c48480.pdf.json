    "abstractText": "Hopping locomotion has the potential to enable small-scale robots to maneuver lands quickly while overcoming obstacles bigger than themselves. To make this possible, in this paper, we propose a novel design of a high-power linear actuator for a small-scale hopper. The key design principle of the linear actuator is to use a power spring and an active clutch. The power spring provides a near constant torque along the wide range of output displacement. The active clutch controls the moving direction and operation timing of the linear actuator, which enables the hopper to take off at the right timing. As a result, the hopper has a size of 143 mm, a mass of 45.9 g, and hops",

            "text": "Mobile robots can survey the environment and perform detection missions on behalf of humans. Among mobile robots, small and lightweight robots are less expensive to build and more energy efficient. Their size and weight also make them easy to carry, allowing them to be paired with humans or other carrier robots. These features make them versatile for many specialized purposes and applications. However, due to their small size, small mobile robots are highly affected by terrain and obstacles and need a way to overcome them. Jumping locomotion overcomes the limitations imposed by their small size and is an effective locomotion method for travelling over discontinuous paths and obstacles. Several studies have attempted to increase jumping performance by amplifying the power output of the motor and have used elastomers to do so [1\u20137]. Mechanisms for storing and releasing energy in elastic materials are an effective way to improve jumping performance without excessively increasing weight and size. Jumping robots developed to date have demonstrated successful performance. However, the process of storing energy for power amplification takes tens of seconds or longer, making agile movement difficult. To solve this problem, recent studies have been conducted to achieve hopping. Hopping locomotion involves a series of jumps, with some of the impact of the landing being reabsorbed and used for the next hopping. The kangaroo rat is a good example of hopping on the small-scale. Among kangaroo rats, Dipodomys deserti can travel a distance of 0.28 m (2 BL) horizontally and 0.15 m (1 BL) vertically in a single hop. When confronted with a predator, they can jump vertically up to 0.4 m with high acceleration [8\u201310]. Furthermore, kangaroo rats reabsorb about 14% of their energy on each landing and use it for the next hop [11]. To achieve kangaroo rat-like hopping locomotion, a high-powered drive design is essential. To achieve this, several hopping robots have been developed recently. Salto adopts a power modulation approach to maximize its hopping performance. An optimized eight-bar linkage was designed for power modulation. During the first half of the jump, the energy from the motor is stored in the rubber tube. In the second half, the energy\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 339. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics8040339 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomimetics\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 339 2 of 15\nstored in the rubber tube and the torque of the motor are simultaneously released in an explosive burst, resulting in a high-performance continuous jump. The trajectory of the leg tips is also designed to be close to a straight line, while still passing through the center of mass, so that there is very little rotation of the entire robot. Additionally, Salto uses a mechanical advantage through an 8-bar linkage and achieves high vertical agility through series elastic actuation [12\u201314]. Dipo is a small hopping robot with a four-bar linkage leg structure and an active clutch. Dipo has a total height of 5 cm and weighs about 45 g in the stance phase. To make it small and lightweight, the robot used a power spring that requires less torque to store energy compared to a typical spring. In addition, the power spring requires less space to store energy compared to a large total displacement, allowing for a compact design. Dipo is capable of hopping up to 54.9 cm using the active clutch and power spring, which is 11 times the length of the robot in stance [15]. The inverted cam-based hopper is a robot that has legs with a six-bar linkage and uses an inverted cam to modulate power as a mechanism to store and release energy. The inverted cam consists of two cranks and a cam-shaped shell. In addition, the crank is composed of two links and a torsion spring, and when storing energy, the energy is stored in the torsion spring inside the crank in the form of a parallel elastic actuator (PEA) by the cam-shaped shell. The crank then leaps out of the shell, releasing energy like a series elastic actuator [16]. Nasonov et al. shows a hopping robot using computational design of closed-chain linkages [17]. Through morphological computation, the robot is designed to have minimum control effort needed to excite and stabilize. As a result, the robot uses two low-performance actuators and achieves hopping and running. Chen et al. proposes an origami-inspired jumping leg that can directly tune the leg\u2019s stiffness [18]. Stiffness of the jumping leg is tuned through a laminated design and fabrication method, providing the option to adjust both the stiffness coefficient and the nonlinearity of the force-displacement curve. As a result, the properly tuned jumping leg showed an increase of 19% improvement in peak power output. There are also hopping robots that use a linear structure as shown in Table 1. Hopping robots based on rotational links have asymmetrical leg structures with respect to the coronal plane. When a linkage-based hopping robot takes off, each link rotates around its joint, resulting in a nonlinear trajectory for the foot, which increases the rotational momentum of the body. In order for the robot to take off stably, the foot must follow a straight trajectory and pass through the center of gravity of the robot to minimize the rotational momentum of the body. Since these robots are structurally designed to take off with a straight trajectory, it is relatively advantageous to reduce the rotational momentum. REBO hopper is a hopping robot that uses the REBO pattern in the origami structure as a spring to store and release energy. The hopper consists of three REBO springs connected in parallel to form one compliant leg, and each spring is controlled by an individual motor, pulley, and tendon, giving it three degrees of freedom (DoF). The compliant leg changes the position of the foot as the length of each tendon changes, and this allows the hopper to perform fore-aft hopping as well as vertical hopping [19]. Another hopping robot uses power modulation based on auxetic tubular springs fabricated using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material and a 3D printer. The robot consists of three springs, a motor, a tendon, and a foot. The motor controls the length of the tendon, and the tendon stores or releases energy to the spring. An auxetic spring has a negative Poisson\u2019s ratio, which means it gets stiffer as it stores energy, and this feature makes it more efficient than a linear spring. By adjusting each tendon, the robot can change direction and has a total of one degree of freedom in the vertical direction and two DOFs in the forward direction [20]. Disney LEAP is a hopping robot composed of voice coil actuators and parallel springs. The voice coil actuator has low inertia due to its lightweight coil and has no gearing parts, resulting in virtually no friction. The spring connected in parallel with the actuator reduces the force and power required for hopping and allows the voice coil to store energy directly\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 339 3 of 15\nin the linear spring. To maximize the robot\u2019s hopping performance, a strategy is employed\nto not pre-compress the spring in mid-air during hopping, but to apply voltage only when\nthe spring is compressing and extending [21]. The mentioned robots above have shown successful hopping locomotion in terms of hopping height shown in Table 1; however, there still exists room to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a small-scale and lightweight linearly hopping robot, as shown in Figure 1. To improve the robot\u2019s hopping performance, a powerful linear actuator is newly developed. The key components are a power spring, specially designed rack-and-pinion, and an active clutch. The power spring is suitable for dividing the desired amount of energy into as many parts as needed because the torque required to charge the elastic energy is small, and it has a central flatter section where the magnitude of the output torque is almost constant. The specially designed rack-and-pinion structure is created to make a linear motion. Linear actuation is advantageous to minimize the rotational momentum during hopping. If the reaction force always follows a straight line and is designed so that the reaction force passes through the mass center, the momentum can be reduced to almost zero during hopping. An active clutch enables the pinion gear to contact the left or right side of the rack, controlling the direction of motion of the rack. With these key components, the proposed hopper has a size and weight of 143 mm and 45.88 g, respectively, and a maximum hopping height of 58 cm.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16 gearing parts, resulting in virtually no friction.

At the same time, designing the reaction forces to pass through the robot\u2019s center of gravity is important. We first focus on the straight trajectory of the hopping robot\u2019s feet, and linear actuators can easily achieve this. However, we need a linear actuator that is lightweight, compact, and high powered. We design a linear actuator with a rack-and-pinion structure using a power spring-based series elastic actuator to produce the output required for hopping with a small motor. Since the spring can only rotate in one direction, we use an active clutch and a specially designed rectangular rack structure for bi-directional drive output. The drive direction of the rectangular rack changes depending on the side that the pinion touches. The active clutch allows the pinion to selectively change the side that the rack touches. As a result, the design allows for bi-directional drive through the active clutch mechanism."

The rack receives power from the actuation part and performs reciprocating motion up and down. At the lower end of the rack, there is a compliant structure connected in series, which acts as a passive spring. The passive spring installed at the feet absorbs the impact of landing in the form of elastic energy, which is used for the next hopping. There is another passive spring connected in parallel at the top of the rack. The top passive spring also absorbs the energy of the landing and uses it for the next hopping. At the end of the leg, there is a sensor to detect contact with the ground.

During the landing phase, a sensor at the end of the foot detects ground contact, which triggers the active clutch. The active clutch moves the actuation part containing the power spring, allowing the energy to be released. Finally, the rack moves downward, and the robot performs a leap as shown in Figure 3c.

Power-Amplifying Actuator Jumping robots have different amounts of time to store energy depending on the purpose of the jump. Unlike the robots that are intended to move in a single jump, the robots that are intended to move by hopping continuously have a limited amount of time to store energy. Hopping robots require high-powered actuators because they need to releap within a short contact time with the ground. In this paper, a power spring is utilized as a key element to achieve continuous high-power drive. Figure 4 shows the torque curve as a function of displacement for a typical torsional spring and a power spring. A typical torsional spring has a maximum torque at the beginning, and the torque decreases linearly with displacement. In order to store energy in a torsional spring, a motor capable of producing a higher torque than the maximum torque is required, which requires a high reduction ratio in the motor or a strong torque in the motor itself. However, increasing the reduction ratio of the motor reduces the actuation bandwidth, which is unfavorable for hopping, and using a motor with high torque increases the weight and size, which negatively affects the jump. We use a power spring to amplify the output while using a small and low-speed motor. As shown in Figure 4, the power spring has a very wide range of angular displacement [22]. In addition, the increase rate of torque to displacement is lower than that of a typical spring, and the torque output is almost constant, especially in the central flatter section. In other words, as long as the winding motor is higher than the torque in the central flatter section, there is no problem storing energy in the power spring. Furthermore, because the power spring stores energy in a wide range of displacements, it is suitable for using as much energy as desired by splitting it into sections. In terms of volume, it also allows for a compact design because it stores energy within a limited space. The radius of the unidirectional gear in Figure 5 has been selected as 6 mm. For a single hop, the power spring releases the stored energy during 425.9 degrees. Therefore, at least 44.6 mm travel length is required to the rack. Finally, the rack is designed to have 55.6 mm travel length just in case the pinion gear does not collide with the end of rack structure. This robot uses a power spring as an energy source due to the above advantages, and the power spring used for the proposed robot has an angular displacement of about 1800 degrees and a torque output of 0.05 Nm in the central flatter section. In addition, the power spring stores enough energy for 3.5 hops, excluding sections other than the central, flatter\nFigure 3. Overall hop ing process.

To solve this problem, the position of the actuation part, including the pinion gear, can be changed through the active clutch as shown in Figure 5. In addition, in order to change the drive direction of the rack using a single pinion, two racks must be placed in opposite positions. To implement this, a rectangular rack structure is designed with two racks facing each other. The rectangular rack is designed considering the pitch diameter and overall diameter of the pinion gear, so that the pinion gear cannot engage with both racks during clutching. Figure 5a,b shows the rack being driven in the downward direction. As the active clutch rotates clockwise, the actuation part moves to the left, so the pinion gear engages the rack on the left. This causes the rack to move downward, allowing the robot to leap. Figure 5c,d shows when the rack is driven in the upward direction. When the active clutch motor rotates counterclockwise, the actuation part moves to the right. Therefore, the pinion gear engages the rack on the right side, resulting in the rack moving upward and retracting the hopping leg. The basic purpose of the active clutch mechanism is to move the pinion gear to provide bi-directional drive. Therefore, the active clutch must operate smoothly. For example, the pinion gear must disengage well from the rack when the clutch motor is commanded. Failure to do so would result in a long clutching time, making it difficult to perform a well-timed leap. For smooth operation, the force from the clutch motor must be well transmitted to the pinion gear, which is related to the angle at which the pinion gear approaches the rack. Figure 6 shows the forces that affect the clutch. Fc is the force exerted by the clutch motor and Fext is the force with which the rack holds the pinion gear. The clutch force must be equal to or greater than Fext, x, the force with which the rack holds the pinion gear, in order for the pinion gear to disengage from the rack smoothly. Therefore,\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 339 8 of 15\nit is necessary to minimise the x-direction component of Fext, and for this purpose, Fext is designed to be perpendicular to the clutch force so that Fext,x does not occur.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16 characteristics of the power spring.

            "text": "The proposed hopping robot has two passive springs. One tension spring is located above the actuation part and the other compression spring is located below. The spring constants of the two springs change the amount of energy recovered upon landing, which in turn affects the take-off speed. To understand the effect of the springs, the take-off velocity of the robot is investigated through the dynamic model by adjusting the spring constants of the passive springs as shown in Figure 11. First, for the parallel spring installed at the top, the take-off velocity increases as the spring constant increases. For the series spring installed at the bottom, the take-off velocity decreases as the spring constant increases. This is because there is little compression displacement when the spring constant is large. While there is a clear limit to the ground reaction force applied by a hopping robot\u2019s weight, if the spring constant is too large, it is difficult to store elastic energy because the spring is hardly compressed. When the spring stiffness is low, it is useful to store the elastic energy and accordingly, the hopper tends to take off with high speed as shown in Figure 11. However, if the stiffness is too low the spring over-compresses and the spring structure collides with each other.

Conclusions In this study, a small hopping robot is developed using a power spring-based linear actuator. The power spring stores energy even with a small amount of torque and stores energy efficiently because the spring has a central, flatter section. The power spring also has a displacement of more than 1800\u00b0, so it can store a lot of energy at once. The linear actuator is designed as a rack-and-pinion structure, and in order to achieve bi-directional linear motion, a rectangular rack and an active clutch mechanism are introduced. The active clutch mechanism solves the problem of limited directionality of the power spring and actively changes the driving direction of the rack. This ensures that the hopping robot can release energy at the right time during the short contact time with the ground. In order\nig re 13. ( ) rajectory of the mass center during eleven hops.
