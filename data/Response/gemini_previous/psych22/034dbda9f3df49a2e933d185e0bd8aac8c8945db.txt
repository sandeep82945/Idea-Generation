1. **Investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the association between cannabis use and psychosis.** This could be done using neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI or PET to compare the brain activity of cannabis users with and without psychosis. This research could help to identify the specific brain regions and pathways that are involved in the development of psychosis in cannabis users.


2. **Examine the role of genetic factors in the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis.** This could be done by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic variants that are associated with both cannabis use and psychosis. This research could help to determine whether there is a causal link between these two conditions.


3. **Develop and test interventions to prevent or reduce the risk of psychosis in cannabis users.** This could include interventions that target the underlying neural mechanisms of the association between cannabis use and psychosis, as well as interventions that address the social and environmental factors that contribute to cannabis use.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of cannabis use on brain structure and function.** This could be done using longitudinal neuroimaging studies to track changes in brain structure and function over time in cannabis users. This research could help to identify the long-term consequences of cannabis use and inform the development of interventions to prevent or mitigate these effects.


5. **Examine the relationship between cannabis use and other mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.** This could be done using epidemiological studies to compare the rates of these conditions in cannabis users and non-users. This research could help to determine whether cannabis use is a risk factor for these conditions or whether it is simply associated with them.
