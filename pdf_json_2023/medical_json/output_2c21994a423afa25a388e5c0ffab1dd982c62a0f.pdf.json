These processes involve profound gene expression and epigenome remodeling and linking Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling to chromatin modifications has been a challenge over the past decades. Functional studies of the histone demethylase KDM1a/LSD1 converge to indicate that this epigenetic regulator is a key regulator of cell fate 1, although the extracellular cues controlling LSD1 action remain largely unknown. Here we show that \u03b2-Catenin is a substrate of LSD1. Demethylation by LSD1 prevents \u03b2-Catenin degradation thereby increasing its nuclear levels. In muscle stem cells, \u03b2-Catenin and LSD1 are both recruited on the MyoD Core Enhancer to control MyoD expression and promote muscle stem cell commitment 2,3. Moreover, a \u03b2-Catenin reporter construct shows that the involvement of LSD1 in \u03b2-Catenin regulation is not restricted to MyoD activation. Altogether, by inscribing them in the same molecular cascade linking extracellular factors to epigenetic modifications and gene expression, our results provide a rational explanation to the similarity of action of canonical Wnt signaling and LSD1 on cell fate. Introduction Resident quiescent muscle stem cells (MuSCs) confer skeletal muscle unique regenerative capacities and play a central role in skeletal muscle plasticity. While quiescent under resting conditions, upon muscle injury MuSCs activate a specific cascade of transcription factors, leave the quiescent state, expand and further differentiate into myocytes, before maturing into myofibers.

Notably, a subset of activated MuSCs resists the differentiation process, thereby returning in quiescence to replenish the pool of MuSCs 4\u20137 sufficient to support future rounds of muscle growth/regeneration. The control of the balance between MuSC commitment and self-\nrenewal is crucial for muscle homeostasis and the fine tuning of MyoD expression plays a key role to set this balance 8.\nWe have previously shown that LSD1 is crucial for the timely activation of MyoD expression during the\ncommitment of muscle progenitors, via the activation of the Core Enhancer region (CER) of the MyoD gene 3. Consistently, LSD1 ablation delays MyoD expression during embryonic myogenesis. However, none of the histone modifications occurring on the CER upon activation can be directly attributed to LSD1 enzymatic activity 3, thus raising the question of its actual role in CER activation.\nThe function of canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in regulating MuSCs homeostasis has been\nextensively studied over the past decade. In the absence of Wnt ligands, \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated in the cytosol by the destruction complex (mainly composed by Axin, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli and the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 \u03b2), which triggers its ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the proteasome. Activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is required for myogenesis since disruption of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling or \u03b2-catenin mutations cause muscle developmental and regenerative defects 9. In MuSCs, upon binding of Wnt ligands to their receptor, the destruction complex is inhibited, thus preventing \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. \u03b2-catenin is then methylated by the methyltransferase SETD7 10 to allow its translocation into the nucleus to participate to the engagement of MuSCs into differentiation."

            "text": "LSD1 inactivation increases MuSC self-renewal potential.\nTo investigate the role of LSD1 in adult MuSCs, LSD1 was specifically inactivated in MuSCs using LSD1 conditional Knock-Out mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible CRE-recombinase under the control of the Pax7 promoter (Pax7-CreERT2:Lsd1tm1Sch\u00fcle, hereafter named LSD1 SCiKO mice). 10 weeks old mice were treated with tamoxifen (TAM), and MuSCs were FACS-isolated 1 week later. MuSCs isolated from Pax7-CreERT2 mice treated with TAM (hereafter named CTRL SC) were used as a control (Supplementary Fig. 1a). A high degree of recombination was evident in FACS-purified MuSCs from LSD1 SCiKO mice based on the amount of LSD1 protein level (Supplementary Fig. 1b). As previously reported the ablation of LSD1 did not impact the proliferation rate of MuSCs in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1c). After 2 days in myogenic differentiation medium (MDM) LSD1 SCiKO MuSCs displayed impaired myogenesis as evidenced by a strong reduction in the proportion of Myogenin positive (+) cells compared to CTRL SC MuSCs (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Conversely, the proportion of PAX7+ cells was significantly increased in LSD1 SCiKO MuSCs compared to CTRL SC MuSCs (Fig. 1a). This increase was caused by the loss of LSD1 enzymatic activity since the LSD1\npharmacological inhibitors Pargyline and OG-L002 produced the same effect on control MuSCs (Fig. 1b). Altogether, these results suggested that the loss of LSD1 delayed MuSC commitment as we previously showed for myogenic progenitors during development 3. Reduced myogenesis could not be attributed to activation of the adipogenic program, since LSD1 SCiKO MuSCs did not produce lipid-containing mononucleated cells in MDM (Fig. 1c). We next examined the effect of LSD1 inactivation on MuSCs in vivo. Lsd1 gene inactivation did not affect the number of quiescent MuSC in healthy muscles, as shown by PAX7 immunofluorescence on Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle cryosections (Supplementary Fig. 2 a-b). Of note, 7 and 56 days after the last TAM injection, the number of fibers per mm2 and the histological features (Supplementary Fig. 2 c-d) were also similar in LSD1 SCiKO and CTRL SC uninjured TA muscles. To investigate LSD1 role during muscle regeneration, TA muscles of LSD1 SCiKO and CTRL SC were injured by cardiotoxin (CTX) injection. Seven days after CTX injury (Supplementary Fig. 2e), LSD1 SCiKO TA muscles displayed smaller regenerating fibers than CTRL SC TA muscles (Supplementary Fig. 2 f-g). Consistently with the in vitro results, we did not observe an increase in adipocyte-like cells (Supplementary Fig. 2h). Surprisingly, 28 days post injection (dpi) (Fig. 1d), when muscles were completely regenerated and MuSCs had returned into quiescence, the number of PAX7+ cells per mm2 was increased by 50% in LSD1 SCiKO muscles compared to CTRL SC (Fig. 1e). Staining for PAX7 and the proliferation marker Ki67 showed that in both conditions more than 95% of the PAX7+ cells were negative for Ki67, indicating that they were not proliferating (Supplementary Fig. 2i). Evaluation of regeneration 28 dpi showed that the number of fibers per mm2 and the distribution of myofiber cross sectional area (CSA) were similar in CTRL SC and LSD1 SCiKO TA muscles (Fig. 1 f-g). Altogether, these results indicated that in the absence of LSD1, MuSC self-renewal is increased but the regenerative potential of muscle is preserved in vivo. To investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 produced similar effects, wild-type (WT) mice were treated with the pharmacological inhibitor of LSD1 (OG-L002 11) and TA muscles were injured by CTX injection (Fig. 1h). Twenty-one dpi, the number of quiescent MuSCs (PAX7+/Ki67-) in TA muscles was significantly higher in mice treated with OG-L002, compared to vehicle (Fig. 1i). The histological analysis and the number of fibers per mm2 showed no significant differences between treated and untreated mice (Fig. 1 j-k). These results support the conclusion that the effect of LSD1 inactivation on MuSC self-renewal is due to the loss of LSD1 enzymatic activity.\nLSD1 inactivation enhances MuSC regenerative potential after repeated injury\nSince LSD1 ablation or inhibition increased the pool of MuSCs, we hypothesized that it could either be beneficial or detrimental for further regeneration events. Three consecutive muscle regenerations were therefore performed by three successive CTX injections 28 days apart from each other in LSD1 SCiKO and CTRL SC TA muscles. Injured muscles were analyzed 7 and 28 days after the third CTX injection (dpiIII, Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, fiber number per mm2 were not reduced anymore at 7 dpiIII in LSD1 SCiKO conversely to what was observed after a single round of regeneration (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2f). In addition, regeneration efficiency at 28 dpiIII was similar to what was observed after a single CTX injection in CTRL SC: the distribution of regenerated fibers CSA, the number of fibers for mm2 as well as the histological analysis was similar between CTRL SC and LSD1 SCiKO mice (Fig. 2 b-d) but a 40% increase in the number of MuSCs/mm2 in LSD1 SCiKO mice compared to CTRL SC was still present (Fig. 2e). These results indicated that the loss of LSD1 in MuSCs both increased the pool of PAX7+ while preserving the regenerative potential of muscles even after repeated injuries.\nLSD1 inactivation stimulates symmetric division.\nTo better understand the mechanism underlying this phenotype, we investigated at which specific stage LSD1 inactivation affected MuSC division in vivo. After muscle injury, MuSCs undergo a first round of division between 28 and 40 hours (h) 12,13. A pulse labeling of mitosis was performed by injecting the deoxynucleotide analog EdU 28 h post injury (hpi). MuSCs were isolated 12 h later (40 hpi) (Fig. 3a). In absence of LSD1, MuSCs activated as well as the control ones (Fig. 3b). After completing the first round of division MuSCs rapidly proliferate to expand their number to allow the repair of the muscle. To measure the rate of MuSC expansion, muscles were analyzed by immunostaining PAX7, Ki67 and EdU incorporation at 96 h post injury (Fig. 3 a-c). No difference was observed between the proliferation rate of CTRL SC and LSD1 SCiKO MuSCs (Fig. 3c). As expected, the absolute number of PAX7+ cells was already significantly increased in absence of LSD1 (Fig. 3d). MuSCs can undergo either planar symmetric division to give rise to two MuSCs (to increase the pool) or alternatively undergo an asymmetric division to give rise to a stem cell and a committed one. Altogether, our data suggested that LSD1 might be involved in the regulation of the balance between symmetric and asymmetric MuSC first division. To test whether LSD1 regulated such Symmetric/Asymmetric division balance, myofibers were placed in culture for 42 h before immunostaining PAX7 and MYF5, as previously described 14. In the absence of LSD1, the percentage of asymmetric divisions yielding one Pax7+/MYF5+ cell was drastically reduced to 2% compared to CTRL SC MuSCs that underwent 15% of\nasymmetric division (Fig. 3e). These data indicated that LSD1 has a pro-differentiation action by favoring asymmetry during the first division of MuSCs. LSD1 is required for transcriptional activation by \u03b2-catenin. During development and to preserve tissue homeostasis, many types of stem cells rely on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to set the balance between self-renewal and differentiation by promoting asymmetric cell division 15\u2013 19. In embryonic stem cells, Wnt-coreceptors and \u03b2-catenin control the orientation of the mitotic spindle to favor asymmetric division 18. Since both LSD1 and \u03b2-catenin promote asymmetric division and since both were shown to activate the MyoD CER 2,3, we investigated whether LSD1 function could be linked to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to evaluate the potential role of LSD1 in \u03b2catenin recruitment on the MyoD CER during myoblast commitment. As expected, in myoblast expressing control shRNA (shSCRA cells 3), \u03b2-catenin was strongly enriched on the CER after 72 hours in myogenic differentiation medium. Conversely myoblasts expressing a LSD1 shRNA (shLSD1 cells 3) failed to recruit \u03b2catenin on the CER (Fig. 4a). This indicated that LSD1 is required for the recruitment of \u03b2-catenin on the MyoD CER. To determine if LSD1 was globally required for \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity in myoblasts, shLSD1 and shSCRA myoblasts as well as CTRL SC and LSD1 SCiKO primary MuSCs were transfected with a \u03b2-catenin reporter luciferase construct and treated with Wnt3A or LiCl 20 to activate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. In absence of LSD1 myoblasts displayed very low luciferase expression compared to control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Next, we evaluated the effect of LiCl on the activation of \u03b2-catenin target genes and as expected, LiCl increased the expression of Fst, Porcn and Axin2 in shSCRA cells whereas their expression was hardly increased in shLSD1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). To promote myogenic cells differentiation, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling required the formation of a complex between \u03b2-catenin and BCL9 21. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to evaluate the interaction between \u03b2-catenin and BCL9 in CTRL SC and LSD1 SCiKO MuSC treated with Wnt3A. The results indicated that significantly less \u03b2-catenin/BCL9 complexes were formed in LSD1 SCiKO than in CTRL SC MuSCs (Fig. 4b). Altogether, these results showed that LSD1 is required for the activation of gene expression by \u03b2-catenin in myogenic cells.\nDemethylation by LSD1 is required for \u03b2-catenin stabilization in the nucleus\nWe next investigated the mechanism through which LSD1 promoted \u03b2-catenin activity. Analysis of shLSD1 and shSCRA nuclear extracts by western blot showed that \u03b2-catenin levels were significantly lower in shLSD1\nthan in shSCRA nuclei, whereas the levels of \u03b2-catenin transcript were similar in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3c-d). A time-course experiment with cycloheximide (CHX) to evaluate the stability of \u03b2-catenin protein showed that \u03b2-catenin half-life was strongly reduced in shLSD1 cells compared to shSCRA cells (Fig. 4c). It was recently shown that the lysine 180 of \u03b2-catenin must be mono-methylated by SETD7 to shuttle into the nucleus 10. In addition, \u03b2-catenin lysine 180 methylation was shown to destabilize the protein 22. Consistently, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was more efficient to accumulate a non-methylable SETD7 \u03b2-catenin mutant (\u03b2-CAT K180R) than WT \u03b2-catenin (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that either over-expressed \u03b2-catenin and LSD1 or endogenous \u03b2-catenin and LSD1 co-immunoprecipitated (Supplementary Fig. 3f-g). We thus speculated that LSD1 directly demethylates \u03b2-catenin to stabilize it in the nucleus. \u03b2-catenin methylation was thus evaluated by western blot with an anti-pan methyl lysine (KpanMe) antibody on \u03b2-catenin immunoprecipitated from shSCRA or shLSD1 nuclear extracts. After 72h in myogenic differentiation medium, nuclear \u03b2-catenin methylation was very low in shSCRA nuclei whereas nuclear \u03b2catenin remained strongly methylated in shLSD1 nuclei, suggesting that in the absence of LSD1 nuclear \u03b2catenin was not demethylated during myoblast commitment (Fig. 4d). Finally, an in vitro de-methylation assay was performed with recombinant LSD1 to assess whether LSD1 is a \u03b2-catenin demethylase. A methylated \u03b2catenin peptide encompassing lysine 180 ( \u03b2-CAT K180Me) was incubated with recombinant LSD1 or with cellular extracts of HEK 293T cells overexpressing WT LSD1 or catalytically inactive LSD1 mutants (LSD1K661A and LSD1 K661A/W754A/Y761S, 23). As shown in Fig. 4e, recombinant LSD1 and overexpressed WT LSD1 efficiently demethylated the \u03b2-cat K180Me peptide. Conversely, the catalytically inactive LSD1 mutants failed to demethylate the \u03b2-cat K180Me peptide. These results demonstrated that \u03b2catenin is a non-histone substrate of LSD1 demethylase activity."

            "text": "Using molecular and genetic approaches, we have demonstrated that in MuSCs \u03b2-catenin and LSD1 act together to promote asymmetric division and to activate the Core Enhancer of MyoD, thereby promoting myogenesis. The Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway plays a key role in cell fate determination during development and in adult tissue regeneration by stem cells. These processes are complex and involve profound gene expression and epigenomic remodeling. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that relay and fine tune Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling in cell fate determination has been a challenge over the past decades. Here we have identified a new check point of Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling by showing that once in the nucleus \u03b2-Catenin must be demethylated by LSD1 to prevent its degradation via the proteasome.\nIt has been recently demonstrated that in myoblast cultures, LSD1 inhibition could promote the switch\nof myogenic cells into brown adipocytes in pro-adipogenic conditions 24. Our results indicate that in promyogenic conditions, MuSCs, lacking LSD1, do not lose their myogenic identity. Similarly, in vivo LSD1 inactivation did not induced adipogenesis. Both genetic inactivation and the pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 led to a significative expansion of PAX7+ MuSCs after muscle injury, which remained fully myogenic even after repeated injuries.\nAltogether, our results identify LSD1 essential in the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, required for\ntranscriptional regulation by \u03b2-catenin during MuSC commitment (Fig. 4f). It will be important in the future to determine whether the requirement of LSD1 for transcriptional regulation by \u03b2-catenin also applies to nonmyogenic lineages."
