    "abstractText": "African swine fever virus is considered an emerging virus that causes African swine fever, a disease characterised by high mortality and elevated transmission rates and that, as it is for most other viral diseases, cannot be treated with specific drugs. Effective and reliable detection of the virus is relevant to prevent uncontrolled contagion among boar populations and to reduce economic losses. Moreover, animal health laboratories are demanding standardisation, optimisation and quality assurance of the available diagnostic assays. In the present study, the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit was validated following the UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 guidelines. Analytical validation terms include in silico and in vitro specificity, sensitivity, efficiency and reliability (repeatability/reproducibility). Diagnostic validation of the method was assessed through the analysis of a total of 181 porcine samples originating from six different matrix types doped with African swine fever virus DNA received from the European reference laboratory for African Swine Fever (INIA-CISA, Madrid, Spain): whole blood, blood serum, kidney, heart, liver and tonsil. Results agreed with those obtained from a reference detection method also based on real-time PCR, endorsed by WOAH, but the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit incorporates some technical innovations and improvements which may benefit end-users. This kit, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, can recognise all known ASFV genotypes and brings additional benefits to the current qPCR technology.",

            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus, and it is the sole member of the genus Asfarvirus, the only member within the family Asfarviridae [1]. ASFV is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF), a transboundary\nVet. Sci. 2023, 10, 564. https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci10090564 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vetsci\nVet. Sci. 2023, 10, 564 2 of 12\nswine viral disease which affects the Suidae family, and it is responsible for increased mortality rates in pig farms worldwide, generating one of the main crises in the swine industry [2,3]. According to genomes sequenced and deposited in public databases, ASFV revealed a great diversity and, so far, 24 genotypes have been described on the basis of partial sequencing of the p72 protein-coding region included in the B646L gene [4\u20136]. Genotyping of viral isolates may help identify the origin of an outbreak, providing an insight into the viral distribution and route of transmission [4,7]. Regarding ASFV transmission, eight species of the Ornithodoros genus of soft ticks have been identified as viral vectors and reservoir hosts. In Africa, the virus is maintained though a sylvatic cycle between soft ticks and warthogs; nevertheless, some tick species present in Africa and Europe are capable of infecting domestic swine [8]. Wild boars are, at least, as susceptible to this virus as domestic pigs, but the disease has established self-sustaining cycles in wild swine, helping ASF spread and maintain its prevalence [9]. In Europe and Asia, transmission between pigs and boars can happen when livestock\u2013 wildlife interaction occurs on farms with deficient biosecurity [8]. Reports also indicate a large number of cases in the wild boar population, which is consistently increasing and spreading across large geographic areas, therefore representing a virus reservoir dangerous for the pig industry [8,9]. ASFV is highly resistant to extreme conditions, as it can survive under diverse environmental circumstances and may be transmitted through contaminated objects [10]. This malignancy does not only harm the health and welfare of animals, but also has a negative impact on biodiversity and causes important financial losses for producers [3]. The considerable mortality rate, rapid spread and negative socioeconomic impact are some of the reasons why the notification of ASF to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE) is mandatory [11,12]. It seems necessary to continue improving current methodologies to identify ASF-affected animals in order to enhance the prevention of viral escalation and to reduce economic losses caused by the expansion of the pandemic [11,13]. Though the identification of infected individuals, areas where the virus has been eradicated will continue to be free of ASFV by preventing the introduction of the disease [13]. Laboratory molecular diagnostic techniques for infectious agents need standardisation, optimisation and quality assurance, as demanded by national and international authorities, which require objective evidence that the diagnostic assays are as reliable as possible [14,15]. ASFV detection methods recommended by the WOAH are virus isolation, antigen measurement using fluorescent antibody tests (FAT) and viral genome detection via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virus isolation is considered the gold standard diagnostic technique for ASFV; however, it is time-consuming and labour-intensive [16,17]. FAT are a methodology that have been used to detect ASFV antigens in pig meat, and, even though it is a quite sensitive method when analysing peracute and acute ASF cases, the sensitivity decreases up to 40% in subacute and chronic disease due to the formation of antigen\u2013antibody complexes in the tissues of infected swine [18]. Currently, the use of PCR-based methods for the detection of ASFV is widespread, since they have been proved to be sensitive, rapid and specific alternatives to virus isolation and antigen detection. PCR assays enable virus detection even in inactivated samples [19]. Even though effective PCR [20,21] and real-time PCR (qPCR) [22\u201326] assays to detect ASFV have been previously developed, there are still opportunities for further enhancement in order to fulfil some additional requests from diagnostic laboratories. The validation of the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit (GPS\u2122, Orihuela, Spain) could offer the possibility of a fast and reliable method to detect all known genotypes of ASFV. This kit can be easily distributed worldwide without substantial costs, since it can be transported at room temperature in the absence of dried-ice. The newly developed MONODOSE format, in which all the reagents are included in individual ready-to-use tubes, enables technicians to rapidly prepare the mix for testing. The fast thermic cycling allows for the qPCR time to take about half an hour. In the present report, the results from the analytical and diagnostic validation of the qPCR-kit for ASFV detection following the UNE-EN\nVet. Sci. 2023, 10, 564 3 of 12\nISO/IEC 17025:2005 criteria [27] are presented and compared with two reference qPCR methods [22,26] suggested by the WOAH."

With the objective of evaluating the extraction yield of the method, DNase/RNase-free water (molecular grade) was doped with 5 \u00b5L of ASFV genetic material. Additionally, to test the robustness of the method for the extraction and purification of ASFV from porcine samples, six different matrices (whole blood, blood serum, kidney, heart, liver and tonsil) where doped with 5 \u00b5L of reference total DNA. In the case of the viscera (kidney, heart, liver and tonsil), a previous sample-homogenisation step was carried out with a 0.9% NaCl solution.

During the development of the present study, 5 \u00b5L of each sample analysed was added to the supplied ready-to-use tubes. The qPCR reactions were carried out in a QuantStudio3 (ABI) device, with a thermal protocol composed of an activation step at 95 \u25e6C for 2 min and 40 amplification cycles organised as follows: denaturation at 95 \u25e6C for 5 s, annealing/extension at 60 \u25e6C for 20 s and, in the end, data collection. Positive control using the Standard Template, negative control (nuclease-free water) and internal control (IC) were included in all tests, with all these materials supplied in the qPCR kit. Data were collected using the HEX channel to read the IC and using the FAM channel for the target. The IC was optimised to detect the presence of possible qPCR inhibitors in the case of negative samples without affecting the main target sensitivity. It was designed against an external target not related to ASFV or to the host. Calibration of the qPCR was performed with a standard curve prepared from ten-fold dilution series of a Standard Template provided in the kit, with a range between 106 and 10 copies. For the qPCR method developed by Fern\u00e1ndez-Pinero et al. [26] for the molecular diagnosis of ASFV by using Universal Probe Library, oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). The thermal protocol included an activation step of 5 min at 95 \u25e6C and 45 amplification cycles, which encompassed the denaturation step at 95 \u25e6C for 10 s and the annealing/extension step at 60 \u25e6C for 30 s. Fluorescence acquisition was in the FAM channel. The PCR assay developed by King et al. [22] was adapted to be used as a qPCR test as described by the WOAH. The thermal protocol started with an activation step of 5 min at 95 \u25e6C and was followed by 45 amplification cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 \u25e6C for 10 s and annealing/extension at 58 \u25e6C for 30 s."

The 21 ASFV reference DNAs, representative of seven different genotypes, and eight additional reference samples from Warsaw yielded positive results when the ASFV dtec-qPCR kit was employed for detection (Table 2). In order to calculate the yield of the extraction method used, a DNase/RNase-free water (molecular grade) extraction was performed before extracting the DNA from doped matrices. The DNA extraction yield (% \u00b1 standard deviation, SD) achieved using water samples doped with ASFV genomic DNA was 63.4 \u00b1 6.4%. Moreover, the 21 ASFV reference genomic DNAs were employed to dope the different porcine tissue matrices and to estimate the robustness. The minimum yield was obtained in blood serum samples, with 45.2 \u00b1 12.1%, followed by 69.0 \u00b1 25.7% in kidney samples and 73.9 \u00b1 25.4%, 77.1 \u00b1 21.9% and 79.5 \u00b1 29.6% for liver, heart and tonsil samples, respectively (Figure 2). Diagnostic validation was carried out using the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit and results were compared with those obtained from two reference qPCR-based methods [22,26]. Of 181 total samples (Supplementary Table S1), 105 were doped with viral DNA of ASFV and 76 were left unmodified (not doped). The outcomes of both the GPS\u2122 kit and the reference qPCR method described in Fern\u00e1ndez-Pinero et al. [26] were in full agreement,\nVet.

            "text": "ASFV is the pathogen responsible for ASF, one of the most threatening diseases affecting swine, among which are included wild boars and domestic pigs, while being asymptomatic in natural reservoir hosts [32]. Since ASFV can endure extreme environmental conditions, it can be easily transmitted and rapidly spread [8]. The relevance of the disease has led to the redaction of the Council Directive 2002/60/EC (EC, 2002) (European Commission, 2002), which establishes the measures to be applied for ASFV control in the European Union [33]. There are several research groups developing new and diverse technologies to stop the spread of ASF, but, so far, a completely safe and effective vaccine against ASFV is not available on the market [3]. Due to the lack of vaccination, the control of ASF outbreaks depends only on the application of health measures, such as slaughtering infected or suspected-of-being-infected animals, and the cleaning, disinfection and disinfestation of premises, vehicles and equipment [34]. All these circumstances are reasons to remark on the need to develop, validate and make widely accessible a rapid, simple and accurate method for ASFV detection to prevent virus spread and to reduce economic losses. GPS\u2122 has developed a new real-time PCR for ASFV detection which improves the manageability of the qPCR technology and minimises the time and cost required to perform the tests. This kit has been subjected to validation following the recommendations indicated by the international norm ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and compared with reference methods. The results obtained from the validation of the kit were optimum according to the ranges established as acceptance criteria derived from the guidelines of the norm (Table 1). Specificity in silico was assessed through primer and probe sequence analysis, while specificity in vitro was studied with reference genomic material. The results seemed to indicate that the newly developed methodology is inclusive for all genotypes of ASFV described so far. In addition, the in silico exclusivity of the design was proven by analysing all sequences available in public databases and, in particular, those viral species that share a natural host with the target and may be present in analysed samples. The evaluation of the quantitative PCR phase inside the range of the standard curve is essential to perform quantification, and, for that purpose, it was examined whether the average efficiency and R2 values obtained were acceptable in the ranges established by the norm. For the validation process, it was considered appropriate to replicate the analysis a minimum of 10 times. The Fisher test was applied to evaluate the linear model, and it was found acceptable since Fassay was significantly below Ffisher. The performance of the method can be evaluated using the efficiency (e), which was found to be 98.1%; although e values above 75% are usually considered acceptable, results above 90% will ensure the yield of the PCR amplification is optimum. The method was found to be repeatable and reproducible because the coefficient of variation (CV) was lower than 10% in all cases, hence being considered reliable. Sensitivity was assessed during the validation of the method since it indicates the ability\nVet. Sci. 2023, 10, 564 9 of 12\nof the kit to correctly detect the target. The current study provided positive outcomes in 100% of the cases where the detection of 10 copies was tested to determine if the limit of detection (LOD) was reproducible. Finally, the limit of quantification (LOQ) result was accepted, as it was within the stipulated range because the t value obtained was lower than the tstudent value (1.161 < 2.145). The values obtained for the diagnostic validation of the samples analysed showed a 100% diagnostic specificity and 100% diagnostic sensitivity when Fern\u00e1ndez-Pinero et al. [26] was taken as the reference method for this validation. In conclusion, the results of the analysed parameters passed the acceptance criteria established for the validation and agreed with the data obtained from the most recently developed qPCR method recommended by the WOAH, verifying the method to be suitable for use (Table 1). Between different ASFV detection methods recommended by the WOAH, conventional and qPCR assays have been adopted for routine diagnosis in reference laboratories [20,22,26]. Out of the methodologies recommended for ASFV detection in the WOAH terrestrial manual, it was decided to contrast the performance of the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR detection kit only with the procedures that could be used to perform qPCR assays [16]. The results obtained with the kit under validation in the present study and the method developed by Fern\u00e1ndez-Pinero et al. [26] showed the same outcome for both methodologies. However, the results obtained with the qPCR by King et al. [22] presented discrepancies in seven specimens, which in this case resulted negative (Supplementary Table S1). The highest number of discordant results was obtained in blood serum, which could be related to the lower extraction yield observed for that matrix during the evaluation of the robustness of the chosen method of extraction. Nevertheless, discrepancies were also obtained in heart, liver and tonsil doped samples, which showed very favourable results regarding extraction robustness. In all, these data suggest that a correlation between the matrices employed and the results obtained cannot be established. Another possibility was that these discrepancies could be due to the sequence specificity of the primers and probe of King\u2019s method [22]. At the time of designing that qPCR design, the number of ASFV sequences available in public repositories was probably low. Currently, there are 249 complete genome sequences in the NCBI database which belong to ASFV; meanwhile, in 2003 there were only 6 complete genome sequences uploaded. This may be considered an indicator of the ongoing growth of information available in public databases. Newer studies can access a higher number of widely accessible sequences than the reference methods established decades prior. This illustrates the relevance of performing periodical updates to the specificity of current qPCR assays. Furthermore, a report published prior to this study [35] showed that the WOAH-validated PCR method developed by King et al. [22] had a low sensitivity, since it was unable to detect the virus in a sample obtained from an asymptomatic pig experimentally exposed to the virus and also failed to detect three samples obtained from hunted wild boars with antibodies for ASFV [35]. This report from Gallardo et al. [35] agrees with a previous work performed by Fern\u00e1ndez-Pinero et al. [26], in which it was proved that a PCR with a Universal Probe Library (UPL) was more sensitive than the early WOAH-PCR recommended test developed by King et al. [22], since lower Ct values were obtained for 20 ASFV reference isolates. It was concluded that the robustness of the method developed by King et al. [22] decreased when positive samples with a weak signal were tested [26]. Hence, the obtained results during the validation of the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR are supported by previous published works. These data enhance the importance of keeping up-to-date the recommended ASFV qPCR designs in order to enable the detection of all possible circulating ASFV genotypes and face all possible epidemiological scenarios. The ASFV MONODOSE dtec-PCR kit incorporates additional benefits, such as individual ready-to-use tubes which include all the components needed for the specific detection of this pathogen by performing a qPCR test, enabling the minimisation of time invested in reaction preparation. This technology is very user-friendly and straightforward, as all the reagents required are dehydrated together, which enables technicians to just add their\nVet. Sci. 2023, 10, 564 10 of 12\nsamples and run the PCR without requiring any intermediate steps, therefore avoiding possible mistakes and incidences derived from a long manipulation process. Another benefit granted by this kit format is that it can be transported at room temperature, avoiding the use of dried ice, considerably reducing the required time for delivery and shipment expenses. The risk of enzyme rupturing has been eliminated because the enzyme is not frozen\u2013thawed. Also, cross-contamination and fluorophore deterioration by UV light have been minimised to the greatest extent possible due to the dehydration of the reagents and the reduction in manipulation time required in the MONODOSE format.

            "text": "In the present article, a new qPCR previously designed for the detection of African swine fever virus, the ASFV MONODOSE dtec-qPCR kit developed by GPS\u2122 and fully available worldwide, was validated following the guidelines recommended by the international standard UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005. The qPCR method showed a 100% diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and efficiency in this study when it was used with different porcine tissue samples doped with reference ASFV genetic material. These findings suggest that the method is an effective, fast, sensitive and specific tool for the detection of ASFV in clinical porcine samples. Furthermore, the newly developed kit was compared with reference qPCR methodologies endorsed by the WOAH. Data obtained agreed with the most recently developed method, indicating that this kit may be confidently used for the detection of ASFV in porcine samples. Also, the results highlighted the need to update the existing technology, as publicly available data are constantly increasing and further improvements can still be achieved. This kit, with full analytical and diagnostic validation following international standards, improves the results obtained with most of the current reference methodologies and brings additional benefits to qPCR technology.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/vetsci10090564/s1, Table S1: Diagnostic analysis results (Cts) for African swine fever virus qPCR.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N. and A.M.-M.; methodology, G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N. and A.M.-M.; software, G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N. and A.M.-M.; validation, G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N., A.M.-M., G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N. and A.M.-M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N. and A.M.-M.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.B., M.M.-C., P.R., A.N. and A.M.-M.
