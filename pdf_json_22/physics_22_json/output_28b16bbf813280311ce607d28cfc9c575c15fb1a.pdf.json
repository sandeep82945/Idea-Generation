            "text": "General relativity is a Lagrangian theory, i.e., the Einstein equations are derived as the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation of the Einstein\u2013Hilbert functional\u222b\nN (R\u0304\u2212 2\u039b), (1)\nwhere N = Nn+1, n \u2265 3, is a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold, R\u0304 is the scalar curvature, and \u039b is a cosmological constant. We also omitted the integration density in the integral. In order to apply a Hamiltonian description of general relativity, one usually defines a time function x0 and considers the foliation of N given by the slices\nM(t) = {x0 = t}. (2)\nWe may, without loss of generality, assume that the spacetime metric splits\nds\u03042 = \u2212w2(dx0)2 + gij(x0, x)dxidxj, (3)\ncf. [1] (Theorem 3.2). Then, the Einstein equations also split into a tangential part\nGij + \u039bgij = 0 (4)\nand a normal part G\u03b1\u03b2\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212\u039b = 0, (5)\nwhere the naming refers to the given foliation. For the tangential Einstein equations, one can define equivalent Hamilton equations due to the groundbreaking paper by Arnowitt,\nUniverse 2022, 8, 404. https://doi.org/10.3390/universe8080404 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe\nDeser, and Misner [2]. The normal Einstein equations can be expressed by the so-called Hamilton condition\nH = 0, (6)\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian used in defining the Hamilton equations. In the canonical quantization of gravity, the Hamiltonian is transformed to a partial differential operator of a hyperbolic type H\u0302 and the possible quantum solutions of gravity are supposed to satisfy the so-called Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nH\u0302u = 0 (7)\nin an appropriate setting, i.e., only the Hamilton condition, (6) was quantized, or equivalently, the normal Einstein equation, while the tangential Einstein equations were ignored.\nIn [1], we solved the Equation (7) in a fiber bundle E with the base space S0,\nS0 = {x0 = 0} \u2261 M(0), (8)\nand fibers F(x), x \u2208 S0, F(x) \u2282 T0,2x (S0), (9)\nthe elements of which are the positive definite symmetric tensors of order two, the Riemannian metrics in S0. The hyperbolic operator H\u0302 is then expressed in the form\nH\u0302 = \u2212\u2206\u2212 (R\u2212 2\u039b)\u03d5, (10)\nwhere \u2206 is the Laplacian of the DeWitt metric given in the fibers, R the scalar curvature of the metrics gij(x) \u2208 F(x), and \u03d5 is defined by\n\u03d52 = det gij det \u03c1ij , (11)\nwhere \u03c1ij is a fixed metric in S0, such that, instead of densities, we consider functions. The Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation could be solved in E but only as an abstract hyperbolic equation. The solutions could not be split into corresponding spatial and temporal eigenfunctions. In a recent paper [3], we overcame this difficulty by quantizing the Hamilton equations instead of the Hamilton condition.\nAs a result, we obtained the equation\n\u2212 \u2206u = 0 (12)\nin E, where the Laplacian is the Laplacian in (10). The lower order terms of H\u0302\n(R\u2212 2\u039b)\u03d5 (13)\nwere eliminated during the quantization process. This result was valid for all dimensions 3 \u2264 n, provided n 6= 4.\nThe fibers add additional dimensions to the quantized problem, namely,\ndim F = n(n + 1)\n2 \u2261 m + 1. (14)\nThe fiber metric, the DeWitt metric, which is responsible for the Laplacian in (12), can be expressed in the form\nds2 = \u221216(n\u2212 1) n dt2 + \u03d5GABd\u03be Ad\u03beB, (15)\nwhere the coordinate system is\n(\u03bea) = (\u03be0, \u03beA) \u2261 (t, \u03be A). (16)\nThe (\u03beA), 1 \u2264 A \u2264 m, are coordinates for the hypersurface\nM \u2261 M(x) = {(gij) : t4 = det gij(x) = 1, \u2200 x \u2208 S0}. (17)\nWe also assumed that S0 = Rn and that the metric \u03c1ij in (11) is the Euclidean metric \u03b4ij. It is well-known that M is a symmetric space\nM = SL(n,R)/SO(n) \u2261 G/K. (18)\nIt is also easily verified that the induced metric of M in E is isometric to the Riemannian metric of the coset space G/K. Now, we were in a position to use the separation of variables, namely, we wrote a solution of (12) in the form\nu = w(t)v(\u03be A), (19)\nwhere v is a spatial eigenfunction of the induced Laplacian of M\n\u2212 \u2206Mv \u2261 \u2212\u2206v = (|\u03bb|2 + |\u03c1|2)v (20)\nand w is a temporal eigenfunction satisfying the ODE\nw\u0308 + mt\u22121w\u0307 + \u00b50t\u22122w = 0 (21)\nwith\n\u00b50 = 16(n\u2212 1)\nn (|\u03bb|2 + |\u03c1|2). (22)\nThe eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in G/K are well-known and we chose the kernel of the Fourier transform in G/K in order to define the eigenfunctions. This choice also allowed us to use the Fourier quantization similar to the Euclidean case, such that the eigenfunctions were transformed to Dirac measures and the Laplacian to a multiplication operator in the Fourier space. In the present paper, we quantize the Einstein\u2013Hilbert functional combined with the functionals of the other fundamental forces of nature, i.e., we look at the Lagrangian functional\nJ = \u03b1\u22121N \u222b \u2126\u0303 (R\u0304\u2212 2\u039b)\u2212 \u222b \u2126\u0303 1 4 \u03b3a\u0304b\u0304 g\u0304 \u00b5\u03c12 g\u0304\u03bb\u03c11 Fa\u0304\u00b5\u03c11 F b\u0304 \u03c12\u03bb\n\u2212 \u222b\n\u2126\u0303 { 12 g\u0304 \u00b5\u03bb\u03b3a\u0304b\u0304\u03a6 a\u0304 \u00b5\u03a6\u0304 b\u0304 \u03bb + V(\u03a6)}\n+ \u222b\n\u2126\u0303 { 12 [\u03c8\u0303I E \u00b5 a \u03b3 a(D\u00b5\u03c8)I + \u03c8\u0303I E \u00b5 a \u03b3a(D\u00b5\u03c8)I ] + m\u03c8\u0303I\u03c8I},\n(23)\nwhere \u03b1N is a positive coupling constant, \u2126\u0303 b N = Nn+1 and N is a globally hyperbolic spacetime with metric g\u0304\u03b1\u03b2, 0 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2264 n, where the metric splits as in (3). The functional J consists of the Einstein\u2013Hilbert functional, the Yang\u2013Mills and Higgs functional, and a massive Dirac term.\nThe Yang\u2013Mills field (A\u00b5) A\u00b5 = f c\u0304 Ac\u0304\u00b5 (24)\ncorresponds to the adjoint representation of a compact, semi-simple Lie group G with Lie algebra g. The f c\u0304,\nf c\u0304 = ( f a\u0304c\u0304b\u0304) (25)\nare the structure constants of g. We assume the Higgs field \u03a6 = (\u03a6a\u0304) to have complex valued components.\nThe spinor field \u03c8 = (\u03c8IA) has a spinor index A, 1 \u2264 A \u2264 n1, and a color index I, 1 \u2264 I \u2264 n2. Here, we suppose that the Lie group has a unitary representation R, such that\ntc\u0304 = R( f c\u0304) (26)\nare anti-Hermitian matrices acting on Cn2 . The symbol A\u00b5\u03c8 is now defined by\nA\u00b5\u03c8 = tc\u0304\u03c8Ac\u0304\u00b5. (27)\nThere are some major difficulties in achieving a quantization of the functional in (23). Quantizing the Hamilton equations, to avoid the problem with the scalar curvature term, runs into technical difficulties, even if the required quantization of the matter fields in the curved spacetimes could be achieved since the resulting operator would no longer be hyperbolic because the elliptic parts of the gravitational resp. matter Hamiltonians would have different signs in the case of n = 3. This particular problem would not occur when the Hamilton condition would be quantized. The Hamilton condition has the form\nHG + HYM + HD + HH = 0, (28)\nwhere the subscripts refer to gravity, Yang\u2013Mills, Dirac, and Higgs. On the left-hand side are the Hamilton functions of the respective fields. They depend on the Riemannian metrics gij, the Yang\u2013Mills connections, and the spinor and Higgs fields. The main part of the quantized gravitational Hamiltonian is a second-order hyperbolic differential operator with respect to the variables gij while the scalar curvature term R is of zero-order. With this in mind, we also shall apply these categories to the gravitational Hamilton function where the main part, quadratic in the conjugate momenta, is said to be of the second-order and the zero-order terms consist of the scalar curvature and the cosmological constant \u039b. Similarly, we consider the matter Hamilton functions to be zero-order terms with respect to the metric gij, i.e., there is no qualitative difference by assuming gij to be flat or non-flat, or more precisely, quantizing a matter Hamiltonian in a curved spacetime (when gij is a given, fixed metric and not a variable) is qualitatively the same as quantizing it for the Euclidean metric, though the task is certainly more difficult. Thus, the difficulties arising from quantizing the Hamilton condition can best be explained by considering the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nH\u0302Gu = 0 in E, (29)\ncf. (7), where we wrote H\u0302 instead of H\u0302G. This is a hyperbolic differential equation, which can be expressed by\nH\u0302Gu = \u2212\u2206u + \u03d5(R\u2212 2\u039b)u = 0, (30)\nwhere the Laplacian is the Laplacian of the fiber metric (15). In the coordinate system (16), we have\nH\u0302Gu = t\u2212m \u2202\n\u2202t (tm \u2202u \u2202t )\u2212 t\u22122\u2206Mu + t2(R\u2212 2\u039b)u, (31)\nwhere M is the hypersurface (17). Since M is isometric to the symmetric space (18) it is mathematically irresistible to solve (31) by applying separation of variables and using the functions of the Fourier kernel of M as spatial eigenfunctions v, where v = v(\u03c3ij), \u03c3ij are the elements of M. Since\ngij(x) = t 4 n \u03c3ij(x) (32)\nthe critical term R can be expressed as\nR(gij) = t\u2212 4 n R(\u03c3ij) (33)\ndue to the relation between the scalar curvatures of conformal metrics. Thus, it is obvious that the ansatz\nu = wv, (34)\nwhere w = w(t) solves an ODE is only possible if R(\u03c3ij) is constant\nR(\u03c3ij) = \u03bb0. (35)\nThe constant is arbitrary but determined by the metrics we consider to be important, e.g., in the case of a black hole, we would choose \u03c3ij to be the limit metric of a converging sequence of Cauchy hypersurfaces of the interior region of the black hole, which converge to the event horizon topologically but the induced metrics of which converge to a Riemannian metric, cf. [4,5] or [6] (Chapters 4 and 5). In the present case, where we want to include the matter fields of the standard model, we could choose \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij. However, this ansatz implies that the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation is not solved for all (t, \u03c3ij) but only for the \u03c3ij satisfying (35). Given the simplicity and mathematical beauty of the solution, we are inclined to accept this restriction. Let us now consider the quantization of the Hamilton condition (28) taking all Hamilton functions into account. In view of the relation (32), let us propose the following model: If we were able to express the non-gravitational Hamiltonians as\nHYM = tpH\u0303YM, HD = tp H\u0303D, HH = tpH\u0303H , (36)\nwhere the embellished Hamiltonians depend on \u03c3ij, then, by choosing in addition n = 3 and \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij, these Hamiltonians could be quantized by the known methods of QFT, if the Lie groups would be chosen appropriately. The Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation would then not be solved for all (t, \u03c3ij) but only for (t, \u03b4ij). However, the spatial eigendistributions of the Hamilton operator H\u0302G, i.e., the eigendistributions of the Laplacian of M, cf. (20), would still be used but they would be evaluated at \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij. In Section 4, we prove that the expressions in (36) are indeed valid with p = \u2212 23 provided n = 3 and provided that the mass term in the Dirac Lagrangian and the Higgs Lagrangian is slightly modified. The embellished Hamiltonians are then standard Hamiltonians without any modifications, for details, we refer to Section 4. The Hamilton constraint then has the form\nH = HG + HYM + HH + HD\n= HG + t\u2212 2 3 (H\u0303YM + H\u0303H + H\u0303D) \u2261 HG + t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303SM = 0,\n(37)\nwhere the subscript SM refers to the fields of the standard model or a corresponding subset of fields. The solutions of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nH\u0302u = 0 (38)\ncan then be achieved by using the separation of variables. We proved:\nTheorem 1. Let n = 3, v = e\u03bb,b0 and let \u03c8 be an eigendistribution of H\u0303SM when \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij such that\n\u2212 \u2206Me\u03bb,b0 = (|\u03bb| 2 + 1)e\u03bb,b0 , (39)\nH\u0303SM\u03c8 = \u03bb1\u03c8, \u03bb1 \u2265 0, (40)\nand let w be a solution of the ODE\nt\u2212m \u2202\n\u2202t (tm \u2202w \u2202t ) + 32 3 (|\u03bb|2 + 1)t\u22122w + 32 3 \u03b1\u22121N \u03bb1t \u2212 23 w\n+ 64 3 \u03b1\u22122N \u039bt 2w = 0\n(41)\nthen u = we\u03bb,b0 \u03c8 (42)\nis a solution of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nH\u0302u = 0, (43)\nwhere e\u03bb,b0 is evaluated at \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij and where we note that m = 5.\nWe shall refer to e\u03bb,b0 and \u03c8 as the spatial eigenfunctions and w as the temporal eigenfunction.\nRemark 1.

(103)\nThe first functional on the right-hand side of (101) can be written in the form\n\u03b1\u22121N \u222b b a \u222b \u2126 { 14 G ij,kl g\u0307ij g\u0307klw\u22122 + R\u2212 2\u039b}w\u03d5, (104)\nwhere Gij,kl = 12{g ikgjl + gil gjk} \u2212 gijgkl (105)\nis the DeWitt metric, (gij) = (gij)\u22121, (106)\nR the scalar curvature of the slices\n{x0 = t} (107)\nwith respect to the metric gij(t, \u00b7), and where we also assumed that \u2126\u0303 is a cylinder\n\u2126\u0303 = (a, b)\u00d7\u2126, \u2126 b S0, (108)\nsuch that \u2126\u0303 \u2282 Uk for some k \u2208 N, where the Uk are special coordinate patches of N, such that there exists a local trivialization in Uk with the properties that there is a fixed Yang\u2013Mills connection\nA\u0304 = (A\u0304a\u0304\u00b5) = f a\u0304 A\u0304 a\u0304 \u00b5dx \u00b5 (109)\nsatisfying A\u0304a\u03040 = 0 in Uk, (110)\ncf. [8] (Lemma 2.5). We may then assume that the Yang\u2013Mills connections A = (Aa\u0304\u00b5) are of the form\nAa\u0304\u00b5(t, x) = A\u0304 a\u0304 \u00b5(0, x) + A\u0303 a\u0304 \u00b5(t, x), (111)\nwhere (A\u0303a\u0304\u00b5) is a tensor, see [8] (Section 2). The Riemannian metrics gij(t, \u00b7) are elements of the bundle T0,2(S0). Denote by E the fiber bundle with base S0 where the fibers F(x) consist of the Riemannian metrics (gij). We shall consider each fiber to be a Lorentzian manifold equipped with the DeWitt metric. Each fiber F has the dimension\ndim F = n(n + 1)\n2 \u2261 m + 1. (112)\nLet (\u03ber), 0 \u2264 r \u2264 m, be coordinates for a local trivialization, such that\ngij(x, \u03ber) (113)\nis a local embedding. The DeWitt metric is then expressed as\nGrs = Gij,kl gij,rgkl,s, (114)\nwhere a comma indicates partial differentiation. In the new coordinate system, the curves\nt\u2192 gij(t, x) (115)\ncan be written in the form t\u2192 \u03ber(t, x) (116)\nand we infer Gij,kl g\u0307ij g\u0307kl = Grs \u03be\u0307r \u03be\u0307s. (117)\nHence, we can express (104) as\nJ = \u222b b\na \u222b \u2126 \u03b1\u22121n { 14 Grs \u03be\u0307 r \u03be\u0307sw\u22121 \u03d5 + (R\u2212 2\u039b)w\u03d5}, (118)\nwhere we now refrain from writing down the density \u221a\n\u03c1 explicitly, since it does not depend on (gij) and, therefore, should not be part of the Legendre transformation. Here, we follow Mackey\u2019s advice in [9] (p. 94) to always consider rectangular coordinates when applying canonical quantization, which can be rephrased that the Hamiltonian has to be a coordinate invariant, hence no densities are allowed.\nDenoting the Lagrangian function in (118) by L, we define\n\u03c0r = \u2202L \u2202\u03be\u0307r = \u03d5Grs 1 2\u03b1N \u03be\u0307sw\u22121 (119)\nand we obtain for the Hamiltonian function H\u0302G\nH\u0302G = \u03be\u0307r \u2202L \u2202\u03be\u0307r \u2212 L\n= \u03d5Grs ( 1\n2\u03b1N \u03be\u0307rw\u22121 )( 1 2\u03b1N \u03be\u0307sw\u22121 ) w\u03b1N \u2212 \u03b1\u22121N (R\u2212 2\u039b)\u03d5w\n= \u03d5\u22121Grs\u03c0r\u03c0sw\u03b1N \u2212 \u03b1\u22121N (R\u2212 2\u039b)\u03d5w \u2261 HGw,\n(120)\nwhere Grs is the inverse metric. Hence,\nHG = \u03b1N \u03d5\u22121Grs\u03c0r\u03c0s \u2212 \u03b1\u22121N (R\u2212 2\u039b)\u03d5 (121)\nis the Hamiltonian that will enter the Hamilton constraint, for details see [6] (Chapter 1.4). Let us recall that the fibers F can be considered Lorentzian manifolds, even globally hyperbolic manifolds, equipped with the DeWitt metric (\u03d5Gij,kl), where \u03d5 is a time function, cf. [6] (Theorem 1.4.2). In the fibers, we can introduce new coordinates, (\u03bea) = (\u03be0, \u03beA) \u2261 (t, \u03be A) , 0 \u2264 a \u2264 m, and 1 \u2264 A \u2264 m, such that\nt = \u221a \u03d5 (122)\nand (\u03be A) are coordinates for the hypersurface\nM = {\u03d5 = 1} = {\u03be0 = 1}. (123)\nThe Lorentzian metric in the fibers can then be expressed in the form\nds2 = \u221216(n\u2212 1) n dt2 + t2GABd\u03beAd\u03beB, (124)\nwhere (GAB) is a Riemannian metric on M, which is independent of t. When we work in a local trivialization of the bundle E, the coordinates (\u03beA) are independent of x. The time coordinate t is also independent of x, cf. [1] (Lemma 1.8). Moreover, the fiber elements (gij) can be expressed in the form\ngij = t 4 n \u03c3ij, (125)\nwhere (\u03c3ij) is an element of M, i.e., t(\u03c3ij) = 1, (126)\nor equivalently, det \u03c3ij = det \u03c1ij. (127)\nNext, let us look at the Yang\u2013Mills Lagrangian, which can be expressed as\nLYM = 12 \u03b3a\u0304b\u0304g ij A\u0303a\u0304i,0 A\u0303 b\u0304 j,0w \u22121 \u03d5\u2212 14 FijF ijw\u03d5. (128)\nLet E0 be the adjoint bundle\nE0 = (S0, g, \u03c0, Ad(G)) (129)\nwith base space S0, where the gauge transformations only depend on the spatial variables x = (xi). Then the mappings t\u2192 A\u0303a\u0304i (t, \u00b7) can be looked at as curves in T1,0(E0)\u2297 T0,1(S0), where the fibers of T1,0(E0)\u2297 T0.1(S0) are the tensor products\ng\u2297 T0,1x (S0), x \u2208 S0, (130)\nwhich are vector spaces equipped with the metric\n\u03b3a\u0304b\u0304 \u2297 g ij. (131)\nFor our purposes, it is more convenient to consider the fibers to be Riemannian manifolds endowed with the above metric. Let (\u03b6 p), 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n1n, where n0 = dim g, be local coordinates and\n(\u03b6 p)\u2192 A\u0303a\u0304i (\u03b6 p) \u2261 A\u0303(\u03b6) (132)\nbe a local embedding, then the metric has the coefficients\nGpq = \u3008A\u0303p, A\u0303q\u3009 = \u03b3a\u0304b\u0304g ij A\u0303a\u0304i,p A\u0303 b\u0304 j,q. (133)\nHence, the Lagrangian LYM in (128) can be expressed in the form\nLYM = 12 Gpq \u03b6\u0307 p \u03b6\u0307qw\u22121 \u03d5\u2212 14 FijF ijw\u03d5 (134)\nand we deduce \u03c0\u0303p =\n\u2202LYM \u2202\u03b6\u0307 p = Gpq \u03b6\u0307qw\u22121 \u03d5 (135)\nyielding the Hamilton function\nH\u0302YM = \u03c0p \u03b6\u0307 p \u2212 LYM = 12 Gpq(\u03b6\u0307 pw\u22121 \u03d5)(\u03b6\u0307qw\u22121 \u03d5)w\u03d5\u22121 + 14 FijF ijw\u03d5\n= 12 G pq\u03c0\u0303p\u03c0\u0303qw\u03d5\u22121 + 14 FijF ijw\u03d5 \u2261 HYMw.\n(136)\nThus, after introducing a normal Gaussian coordinate system, such that w = 1, the Hamiltonian that will enter the Hamilton constraint equation is\nHYM = 12 \u03d5 \u22121Gpq\u03c0\u0303p\u03c0\u0303q + 14 FijF ij \u03d5. (137)\nCombining, now, (122), (125) and (133) we infer that the Yang\u2013Mills Hamiltonian can be expressed as\nHYM = t 4 n\u22122G\u0303pq\u03c0\u0303p\u03c0\u0303q + 14 FijF ijt2\u2212 8 n , (138)\nwhere the indices in the last term are raised with respect to the metric \u03c3ij, i.e.,\nFij = \u03c3ik\u03c3jl Fkl . (139)\nIn the case of n = 3, the exponents of t in (138) are equal\n4 3 \u2212 2 = 2\u2212 8 3 = \u22122 3 (140)\nand we can write HYM = t\u2212 2 3 {G\u0303pq\u03c0\u0303p\u03c0\u0303q + 14 FijF ij}\n\u2261 t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303YM.\n(141)\nMoreover, if (\u03c3ij) as well as (\u03c1ij) are equal to the Euclidean metric (\u03b4ij), then the quantization of H\u0303YM would be achieved by known methods of QFT. Hence, we shall attempt to express the Hamiltonians of the other physical forces, such as the Dirac and Higgs Hamiltonians, when evaluated for\n\u03c3ij = \u03c1ij = \u03b4ij (142)\nand in the case of n = 3 in the form\nHD = t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303D (143)\nresp. HH = t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303H (144)\nsuch that the quantization of the spatial Hamiltonian\nH\u0303YM + H\u0303D + H\u0303H (145)\nwould be well known, and in the end, all spatial Hamiltonians of the standard model could be incorporated. Let us first consider the Dirac Hamiltonian. In the Dirac Lagrangian LD, defined in Equation (100) on page 11, the volume density \u221a g is missing, i.e., in order to define the Hamiltonian, we have to multiply the Lagrangian with \u221a\ng, or, since we work with functions instead of densities, we have to multiply the Lagrangian with \u03d5.\nIn addition, we shall also consider\u2014at least locally\u2014a normal Gaussian coordinate system, such that w = 1. Then, the final Dirac Lagrangian has the form\nLD = i2 (\u03c7\u0304I \u03c7\u0307 I \u2212 \u02d9\u0304\u03c7I\u03c7I) + mi\u03c7\u0304I\u03b30\u03c7I\n\u2212 i2{\u03c7\u0304I\u03b3 0Eka\u2032\u03b3 a\u2032 D\u0303k\u03c7I \u2212 \u03c7\u0304I\u03b30Eka\u2032\u03b3a \u2032 D\u0303k\u03c7I},\n(146)\nThe spinorial variables \u03c7IA are anti-commuting Grassmann variables. They are elements of a Grassmann algebra with involution, where the involution corresponds to the complex conjugation and will be denoted by a bar.\nThe \u03c7IA are complex variables and we define the real resp. imaginary parts as\n\u03be IA = 1\u221a 2 (\u03c7IA + \u03c7\u0304 I A) (147)\nresp. \u03b7 IA = 1\u221a 2i (\u03c7IA \u2212 \u03c7\u0304IA). (148)\nThen, \u03c7IA = 1\u221a 2 (\u03be IA + i\u03b7 I A) (149)\nand \u03c7\u0304IA = 1\u221a 2 (\u03be IA \u2212 i\u03b7 IA). (150)\nWith these definitions, we obtain\ni 2 (\u03c7\u0304I \u03c7\u0307 I \u2212 \u00af\u0307\u03c7I\u03c7I) = i 2 (\u03beAI \u03be\u0307 I A + \u03b7 A I \u03b7\u0307 I A). (151)\nCasalbuoni quantized the Bose\u2013Fermi system in [10] (section 4), the results of which can be applied to spin 12 fermions. The Lagrangian in [10] is the same as the main part our Lagrangian in (146) on page 15, and the left derivative is used in that paper; hence, we use left derivatives as well such that the conjugate momenta of the odd variables are, e.g.,\n\u03c0AI = \u2202L \u2202\u03be\u0307 IA = \u2212 i 2 \u03be AI , (152)\nand, thus, the conclusions in [10] can be applied. The Lagrangian has been expressed in real variables\u2014at least the important part of it\u2014and it follows that the odd variables \u03be IA, \u03b7 I A satisfy, after introducing anti-commutative Dirac brackets as in [10] (equ. (4.11)),\n{\u03beAI , \u03be J B} \u2217 + = \u2212i\u03b4 J I \u03b4 A B , (153)\n{\u03b7AI , \u03b7 J B} \u2217 + = \u2212i\u03b4 J I \u03b4 A B , (154)\nand {\u03beAI , \u03b7 J B} \u2217 + = 0, (155)\ncf. [10] (equ. (4.19)). In view of (149), (150) we then derive\n{\u03c7\u0304AI , \u03c7 J B} \u2217 + = \u2212i\u03b4 J I \u03b4 A B , (156)\nwhere \u03c7\u0304AI are the conjugate momenta. Canonical quantization\u2014with h\u0304 = 1\u2014then requires that the corresponding operators \u03c7\u0302IA, \u02c6\u0304\u03c7 B J satisfy the anti-commutative rules\n[\u03c7\u0302IA, \u02c6\u0304\u03c7 B J ]+ = i{\u03c7IA, \u03c7\u0304BJ }\u2217+ = \u03b4IJ \u03b4BA (157)\nand [ \u02c6\u0304\u03c7AI , \u02c6\u0304\u03c7 B J ]+ = [\u03c7\u0302 I A, \u03c7\u0302 J B]+ = 0, (158)\ncf. [11] (equ. (3.10)) and [10] (equ. (5.17)). From (146), we then deduce that the spinorial Hamilton function is equal to\nHD = i2{\u03c7\u0304I\u03b3 0Eka\u2032\u03b3 a\u2032 D\u0303k\u03c7I \u2212 \u03c7\u0304I\u03b30Eka\u2032\u03b3a \u2032 D\u0303k\u03c7I}\n\u2212mi\u03c7\u0304I\u03b30\u03c7I . (159)\nWhen we attempt to quantize this Hamilton function, then the vielbein ea \u2032\nk and its inverse Eka\u2032 will correspond to a given element gij(x) in the fiber F, which can be expressed as in (125), and we deduce that the vielbein\ne\u0303a \u2032 k = t \u2212 2n ea \u2032 k (160)\nand its inverse E\u0303ka\u2032 = t 2 n Eka\u2032 (161)\ncorrespond to the metric \u03c3ij. Furthermore, the covariant derivative D\u0303k\u03c7I is independent of t, in view of (97) and (98) on page 10. Thus, the Hamilton function HD can be expressed as\nHD = t\u2212 2 3 ( i 2{\u03c7\u0304I\u03b3 0E\u0303ka\u2032\u03b3 a\u2032 D\u0303k\u03c7I \u2212 \u03c7\u0304I\u03b30E\u0303ka\u2032\u03b3a \u2032 D\u0303k\u03c7I} ) \u2212mi\u03c7\u0304I\u03b30\u03c7I ,\n(162)\ni.e., the main part already has the form that we looked for in (143), provided n = 3, only the mass term spoils the necessary configuration. To overcome this setback, we either have to omit the mass term or modify it by multiplying the mass term in (23) on page 3 with the factor\n\u03d5\u2212 1 n , (163)\nwhere \u03d5 is defined in (87) on page 10. Note that \u03d5 = 1 if\ngij = \u03c1ij = \u03b4ij (164)\nas is the case in QFT. Either by omitting or by modifying the mass term, the Dirac Hamilton function can be expressed in the required form\nHD = t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303D, (165)\nwhere the underlying Riemannian metric is \u03c3ij, provided n = 3. The remaining Hamiltonian is the Hamiltonian of the Higgs field. The Higgs Lagrangian is defined by LH = \u2212 12 g\u0304 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3ab\u03a6 a \u03b1\u03a6 b \u03b2 \u2212V(\u03a6), (166)\nwhere V is a smooth potential. We assume that in a local coordinate system \u03a6 has real coefficients. The covariant derivatives of \u03a6 are defined by a connection A = (Aa\u00b5) in E0\n\u03a6a\u00b5 = \u03a6 a ,\u00b5 + f a cb A c \u00b5\u03a6 b. (167)\nAs in the preceding section, we work in a local trivialization of E0 using the temporal gauge, i.e.,\nAa0 = 0, (168)\nhence, we conclude \u03a6a0 = \u03a6 a ,0. (169)\nExpressing the density g as in (87) on page 10, we obtain Lagrangian\nLH = 12 \u03b3ab\u03a6 a ,0\u03a6 b ,0 \u03d5\u2212 12 g ij\u03b3ab\u03a6 a i \u03a6 b j \u03d5\u2212V(\u03a6)\u03d5, (170)\nwhere, again, we use local coordinates, such that w = 1. In order to apply our approach, outlined in (144), we have to modify the Lagrangian. Instead of the above Lagrangian, we have to consider\nLHmod = { 12 \u03b3ab\u03a6 a ,0\u03a6 b ,0 \u2212 12 g ij\u03b3ab\u03a6 a i \u03a6 b j }\u03d51+\u03b31 \u2212V(\u03a6)\u03d51+\u03b32 . (171)\nLet us define pa =\n\u2202LH \u2202\u03a6\u0307a , \u03a6\u0307a = \u03a6a,0, (172)\nthen we obtain the Hamilton function\nHHmod = pa\u03a6\u0307a \u2212 LH = 12 \u03b3 ab pa pb \u03d5\u2212(1+\u03b31) + 12 g ij\u03b3ab\u03a6 a i \u03a6 b j \u03d5 1+\u03b31 + V(\u03a6)\u03d51+\u03b32 . (173)\nAfter quantization, the gij are elements of the fiber F, i.e.,\ngij = t 4 n \u03c3ij. (174)\nIf n = 3, then \u03b31 has to be chosen, such that\n\u2212 2(1 + \u03b31) = \u2212 4 3 + 2(1 + \u03b31) = \u2212 2 3\n(175)\nwhich is the case if \u03b31 = \u2212\n2 3 . (176)\nFor \u03b32, we obtain\n2(1 + \u03b32) = \u2212 2 3\n(177)\nyielding\n\u03b32 = \u2212 4 3 . (178)\nThus, the Hamilton function of the modified Higgs field has the required form\nHHmod = t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303Hmod, (179)\nwhere H\u0303Hmod = 12 \u03b3 ab pa pb + 12 \u03c3 ij\u03b3ab\u03a6 a i \u03a6 b j + V(\u03a6) (180)\nis a standard Hamiltonian of a Higgs field in QFT by choosing \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij and \u03a6, V(\u03a6) as well as the Yang\u2013Mills connection appropriately. Combining the four Hamilton functions in (120), (138), (179) and (162), the Hamilton constraint has the form\nH = HG + HYM + HH + HD\n= HG + t\u2212 2 3 (H\u0303YM + H\u0303H + H\u0303D) \u2261 HG + t\u2212 2 3 H\u0303SM = 0,\n(181)\nwhere we omit the subscript mod and where SM refers to the fields of the standard model or to a corresponding subset of fields.\nThe Hamiltonian\nHG = \u03b1N \u03d5\u22121Grs\u03c0r\u03c0s \u2212 \u03b1\u22121N (R\u2212 2\u039b)\u03d5 (182)\nwe quantize, as in our former papers [1,12], to obtain\nHG = \u2212\u03b1N\u2206\u2212 \u03b1\u22121N Rt 2 + 2\u03b1\u22121N \u039bt 2, (183)\nwhere the Laplacian is the Laplacian of the metric (124) acting in the fibers F of E. The Laplacian acts on smooth functions u of the form u = u(gij). Choosing the Gaussian coordinate system (\u03bea) = (t, \u03beA), such that the fiber metric has form as in (124), then, the hyperbolic term \u2212\u2206u can be expressed as\n\u2212 \u2206u = n 16(n\u2212 1) t \u2212m \u2202 \u2202t (tm \u2202u \u2202t )\u2212 t\u22122\u2206\u0304u, (184)\nwhere \u2206\u0304 is the Laplacian of the hypersurface\nM = {t = 1}. (185)\nUsing the separation of variables we consider functions u which are products\nu(t, \u03be A) = w(t)v(\u03beA), (186)\nwhere v is a spatial eigenfunction, or eigendistribution, of the Laplacian \u2206\u0304\n\u2212 \u2206\u0304v = \u03bbv. (187)\nThe hypersurface M = {\u03d5 = 1} (188)\ncan be considered a subbundle of E, where each fiber M(x) is a hypersurface in the fiber F(x) of E. We shall use the same notation M for the subbundle as well as for the hypersurface, and in general, we shall omit the reference to the base point x \u2208 S0. Furthermore, we specify the metric \u03c1ij \u2208 T0,2(S0), which we used to define \u03d5, to be equal to the Euclidean metric, such that in Euclidean coordinates\n\u03d52 = det gij det \u03b4ij = det gij. (189)\nThen, it is well-known that each M(x) with the induced metric (GAB) is a symmetric space, namely, it is isometric to the coset space\nG/K = SL(n,R)/SO(n), (190)\ncf. [13] (equ. (5.17), p. 1123) and [14] (p. 3). The eigenfunctions in symmetric spaces, and especially of the coset space in (190), are well-known; they are the so-called spherical functions. One can also define a Fourier transformation for functions in L2(G/K) and prove a Plancherel formula, similar to the Euclidean case, cf. [15] (Chapter III). Moreover, similar to the Euclidean case, we shall use the Fourier kernel to define the eigenfunctions or eigendistributions, cf. [3] (Section 5).\nLet G = NAK (191)\nbe an Iwasawa decomposition of G, where N is the subgroup of unit upper triangle matrices, A is the abelian subgroup of the diagonal matrices with strictly positive diagonal components and K = SO(n). The corresponding Lie algebras are denoted by\ng, n, a and k. (192)\nHere,\ng = real matrices with zero trace\nn = subspace of strictly upper triangular matrices with zero diagonal\na = subspace of diagonal matrices with zero trace\nk = subspace of skew-symmetric matrices.\n(193)\nThe Iwasawa decomposition is unique, when\ng = nak (194)\nwe define the maps n, A, k by g = n(g)A(g)k(g). (195)\nWe also use the expression log A(g), where log is the matrix logarithm. In the case of diagonal matrices,\na = diag(a1, . . . , an) (196)\nwith positive entries log a = diag(log ai), (197)\nhence, A(g) = elog A(g). (198)\nRemark 3. (i) The Lie algebra a is a (n \u2212 1)-dimensional real algebra, which, as a vector space, is equipped with a natural real, symmetric scalar product, namely, the trace form\n\u3008H1, H2\u3009 = tr(H1H2), Hi \u2208 a. (199)\n(ii) Let a\u2217 be the dual space of a. Its elements will be denoted by Greek symbols, some of which have special meanings in the literature. The linear forms are also called additive characters.\n(iii) Let \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217, then there exists a unique matrix H\u03bb \u2208 a, such that\n\u03bb(H) = \u3008H\u03bb, H\u3009 \u2200H \u2208 a. (200)\nThis definition allows defining a dual trace form in a\u2217 by setting for \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 a\u2217\n\u3008\u03bb, \u00b5\u3009 = \u3008H\u03bb, H\u00b5\u3009. (201)\nThe Fourier theory in X = G/K, which we summarized in [3] (Section 6), uses the functions\ne\u03bb,b(x) = e(i\u03bb+\u03c1) log A(x,b), (\u03bb, b) \u2208 a\u2217 \u00d7 B, x \u2208 X, (202)\nas the Fourier kernel, where B = K/M. (203)\nHere, M is the centralizer of A in K and \u03c1 is a special character with the norm\n\u3008\u03c1, \u03c1\u3009 = 1 12 (n\u2212 1)2n, (204)\ncf. [3] (Lemma 1). If n = 3, then |\u03c1|2 = 1. (205)\nFor a precise definition of A(x, b) \u2208 A, we refer to [3] (p. 19), which also contains references to the corresponding mathematical literature given, especially to Helgason\u2019s book [15] (Chapter III).\nThe Fourier transform for functions f \u2208 C\u221ec (X,C) is then defined by\nf\u0302 (\u03bb, b) = \u222b\nX f (x)e(\u2212i\u03bb+\u03c1) log A(x,b)dx (206)\nfor \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217 and b \u2208 B, or, if we use the definition in (202)\ne\u03bb,b(x) = e(i\u03bb+\u03c1) log A(x,b), (207)\nby\nf\u0302 (\u03bb, b) = \u222b\nX f (x)e\u03bb,b(x)dx. (208)\nThe functions e\u03bb,b are real analytics in x and are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, cf. [15] (Prop. 3.14, p. 99),\n\u2212 \u2206\u0303e\u03bb,b = (|\u03bb|2 + |\u03c1|2)e\u03bb,b, (209)\nwhere |\u03bb|2 = \u3008\u03bb, \u03bb\u3009, (210)\ncf. (201), and similarly for |\u03c1|2. We also denote the Fourier transform by F , such that\nF ( f ) = f\u0302 . (211)\nIn Equation (209), we identified\n\u2206\u0303 = \u2206M = \u2206X . (212)\nIn [3], we finally dropped the embellishment and simply wrote \u2206 when referring to the above Laplacian, but at the moment we refrain from doing so to avoid confusion. We shall consider the eigenfunctions e\u03bb,b as tempered distributions of the Schwartz space S(X) and shall use their Fourier transforms\ne\u0302\u03bb,b = \u03b4(\u03bb,b) = \u03b4\u03bb \u2297 \u03b4b (213)\nas the spatial eigenfunctions of\nF (\u2212\u2206) = m(\u00b5) = (|\u00b5|2 + |\u03c1|2), (214)\nwhich is a multiplication operator, such that\nF (\u2212\u2206)e\u0302\u03bb,b = m(\u00b5)e\u0302\u03bb,b = (|\u03bb|2 + |\u03c1|2)e\u0302\u03bb,b, (215)\ncf. [3] (Section 6) for details. Looking at the Fourier transformed eigenfunctions\ne\u0302\u03bb,b = \u03b4\u03bb \u2297 \u03b4b (216)\nit is obvious that the dependence on b has to be eliminated, since there is neither a physical nor a mathematical motivation to distinguish between e\u03bb,b and e\u03bb,b\u2032 . We discard the integration over B in [3] (Section 6) and pick instead a special element b0 \u2208 B, namely,\nb0 = eM, e = id \u2208 K, (217)\nand only consider the eigenfunctions e\u03bb,b0 with corresponding Fourier transforms\n\u03b4\u03bb \u2261 \u03b4\u03bb \u2297 \u03b4b0 = e\u0302\u03bb,b0 , \u03bb \u2208 a \u2217. (218)\nFor justification, see [3] (Lemma 4) and the arguments preceding the referenced Lemma. The eigenfunctions e\u03bb,b0 depend on the characters \u03bb \u2208 a\n\u2217 but not all characters are physically relevant. For a definition of the physically relevant characters, let us rephrase [3] (Remark 2, p. 18):\nRemark 4. There are characters \u03b1ij, 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, that will represent the elementary gravitons stemming from the degrees of freedom in choosing the coordinates\ngij, 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, (219)\nof a metric tensor. The diagonal elements offer, in general, additional n degrees of freedom, but in our case, where we consider metrics satisfying\ndet gij = 1, (220)\nonly (n \u2212 1) diagonal components can be freely chosen, and we shall choose the first (n \u2212 1) entries, namely,\ngii, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1. (221)\nThe corresponding additive characters are named \u03b1i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1. The characters \u03b1i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, and \u03b1ij 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n will represent the (n+2)(n\u22121)2\nelementary gravitons at the character level. We shall normalize the characters by defining\n\u03b1\u0303i = \u2016H\u03b1i\u2016 \u22121\u03b1i (222)\nand \u03b1\u0303ij = \u2016H\u03b1ij\u2016 \u22121\u03b1ij (223)\nsuch that the normalized characters have unit norm, cf. (201).\nWe can now define the corresponding forms in a\u2217 with arbitrary energy levels:\nDefinition 1. Let \u03bb \u2208 R+ be arbitrary. Then we consider the characters\n\u03bb\u03b1\u0303i \u2227 \u03bb\u03b1\u0303ij, (224)\nwhere we recall that the terms embellished by a tilde refer to the corresponding unit vectors. Then the eigenfunctions representing the elementary gravitons are e\u03bb\u03b1\u0303i ,b0 and e\u03bb\u03b1\u0303ij ,b0 . The corresponding eigenvalue with respect to \u2212\u2206\u0303 is |\u03bb|2 + |\u03c1|2, where, by a slight abuse of notation, |\u03bb|2 = \u03bb2 and |\u03c1|2 = \u3008\u03c1, \u03c1\u3009. Note that |\u03c1|2 = 1 if n = 3, cf. (205). We define a zero-point energy eigenfunction by choosing \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217 = 0. The corresponding eigenfunction would be e0,b0 , satisfying\n\u2212 \u2206\u0303e0,b0 = |\u03c1| 2e0,b0 = e0,b0 . (225)\nif n = 3.\nWe are now able to quantize the Hamiltonian H in (181). For brevity we denote the quantized Hamiltonians, which are operators, by using the same symbols as for the Hamilton functions. For the Hamilton operator HG, we express as in (183)\nHGu = \u2212\u03b1N n 16(n\u2212 1) t \u2212m \u2202 \u2202t (tm \u2202w \u2202t )v\u2212 \u03b1Nt\u22122w\u2206\u0304v\n\u2212 \u03b1\u22121N t 2\u2212 4n R(\u03c3ij)wv + 2\u03b1\u22121N \u039bt\n2wv, (226)\nwhere we use the separation of variables in (186), the form of the metric in (125), namely,\ngij = t 4 n \u03c3ij (227)\nand the relation between the scalar curvatures of conformal metrics\nR(g) = t\u2212 4 n R(\u03c3). (228)\nLet us recall that for the quantization of H\u0303SM we shall specify \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij, such that the spatial eigendistributions, or approximate eigendistributions, \u03c8, satisfying\nH\u0303SM\u03c8 = \u03bb1\u03c8, \u03bb1 \u2265 0 (229)\ncan be derived by applying standard methods of QFT. We then solve the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nHu = 0 (230)\nnot for all (t, \u03c3ij) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 M but only for (t, \u03b4ij), where t > 0 is arbitrary. Thus, we shall solve\n\u2212 \u2206\u0303v = (|\u03bb|2 + |\u03c1|2)v (231)\nby using v = e\u03bb,b0 (232)\nfor arbitrary \u03c3ij \u2208 M, but we shall evaluate e\u03bb,b0 only at \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij. Furthermore, we observe that for x = gK \u2208 X and b = kM \u2208 B, we have\nA(x, b) = A(gK, kM) = A(k\u22121g), (233)\ncf. [3] (equ. (202), p. 18), hence, if b = b0, i.e., if k = e = id, then\nA(x, b0) = A(g). (234)\nMoreover, let \u03c0 : G/K \u2192 M (235)\nbe the isometry, then \u03c0(gK) = gg\u2217, (236)\nwhere g\u2217 is the adjoint. Thus, if g = (\u03b4ij) = e, we infer\n\u03c3ij = \u03b4ij \u2208 M =\u21d2 e\u03bb,b0(\u03c3ij) = 1, (237)\nand we have proved:\nTheorem 3. Let n = 3, v = e\u03bb,b0 , and let \u03c8 be an eigendistribution of H\u0303SM when \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij such that\n\u2212 \u2206\u0303e\u03bb,b0 = (|\u03bb| 2 + 1)e\u03bb,b0 , (238)\nH\u0303SM\u03c8 = \u03bb1\u03c8, \u03bb1 \u2265 0, (239)\nand let w be a solution of the ODE\nt\u2212m \u2202\n\u2202t (tm \u2202w \u2202t ) + 32 3 (|\u03bb|2 + 1)t\u22122w + 32 3 \u03b1\u22121N \u03bb1t \u2212 23 w\n+ 64 3 \u03b1\u22122N \u039bt 2w = 0\n(240)\nthen u = we\u03bb,b0 \u03c8 (241)\nis a solution of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nHu = 0, (242)\nwhere e\u03bb,b0 is evaluated at \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij and where we note that m = 5.\nWe shall refer to e\u03bb,b0 and \u03c8 as the spatial eigenfunctions and to w as the temporal eigenfunction.\nRemark 5. We could also apply the respective Fourier transforms to \u2212\u2206\u0303e\u03bb,b0 resp. H\u0303SM\u03c8 and consider\nwe\u0302\u03bb,b0 \u03c8\u0302 (243)\nas the solution in the Fourier space, where \u03c8\u0302 would be expressed with the help of the ladder operators.\nIn the next section, we shall analyze the temporal eigenfunctions."

            "text": "The temporal eigenfunctions in the theorems of the previous section all become unbounded if t\u2192 0, which can be described as a big bang on a quantum level. Furthermore, if we consider t < 0, then the functions\nw\u0303(t) = w(\u2212t), t < 0, (255)\nalso satisfy the ODE (244) for t < 0, if we replace t\u2212 2 3 by |t|\u2212 23 , i.e., they are also temporal eigenfunctions if the light cone in E is flipped. Thus, we conclude\nTheorem 7. The quantum model we derived for gravity combined with the forces of the standard model can be described by products of spatial and temporal eigenfunctions of corresponding selfadjoint operators with a continuous spectrum. We have a zero-point energy state as a spatial eigendistribution of the gravitational Hamiltonian with the smallest eigenvalue |\u03c1|2 = 1, which could be considered the source of the dark energy. Furthermore, we have a big bang singularity in t = 0. Since the same quantum model is also valid by switching from t > 0 to t < 0, with appropriate changes to the temporal eigenfunctions, one could argue that at the big bang, two universes with different time orientations could have\nbeen created, such that, in view of the CPT theorem, one was filled with matter and the other with anti-matter.\nRemark 6. One of the reviewers raised two questions. First, he wondered about the logic to combine a low energy event, the quantization of the fields of the standard model with a flat metric, with an high-energy event, the quantization of gravity. As we have already pointed out in the introduction, a unified quantization of gravity and matter fields leads to a hyperbolic equation of second order in a fiber space, where the main part of the hyperbolic operator acts in the fibers. The zero-order terms of the operator contain the contributions of the quantized matter Hamiltonian and the interaction of gravity with matter fields occurs with the help of the fiber variables (t, \u03c3ij). The metric \u03c3ij is used in the quantization of the matter fields. Looking at the spatial eigenfunction v of the gravitational Hamiltonian and its eigenvalue, which expresses the energy, then the eigenvalue is independent of the metric \u03c3ij at which v is evaluated and only the evaluation point is relevant for the interaction, i.e., even if a non-flat metric \u03c3ij would have been used in the quantization of the matter fields, the contribution to the unified operator would not have changed qualitatively. Furthermore, as we already mentioned in the introduction, due to the scalar curvature term R, we cannot expect to solve the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation for all (t, \u03c3ij) if we use the separation of variables, instead, we have to choose metrics with constant scalar curvatures. Thus, we opted for \u03c3ij = \u03b4ij, also out of necessity because we could not quantize the matter field in the curved spacetime. The second interaction with respect to the variable t, the quantum time, is realized in the ODE, where the contributions by the spatial gravitational resp. matter eigenfunctions and also by the cosmological constant \u039b have a power of t as a multiplicative factor with different exponents. For small t, the gravitational energy dominates because of the factor t\u22122, for larger t, the matter energy dominates because of the factor t\u2212 2 3 , and if \u039b 6= 0, then the cosmological constant dominates for very large t because of the factor t2. This is also reflected in the results of Lemmas 4 and 5. The second question raised concerned the QFT renormalizability in this unified setting. The quantization of gravity takes place in the fibers of E while the quantization of the matter fields takes place in the base space S0 = Rn, which we equipped with the Euclidean metric for this task. Hence, the usual renormalization techniques can be used to deal with infinities. The fibers are ignored in this process.\nRemark 7. The Academic Editor of the journal also requested some observational predictions of the theory presented in this paper. In Theorem 7, we already offered possible answers to two open questions, namely, the source of the dark energy and why matter dominates anti-matter. The Big Bang is only predicted by the singularity of the Friedmann model, a classical theory. In this paper, the Big Bang is predicted on a quantum level, which is a more appropriate level because the Big Bang is certainly a quantum event. Powerful gravitational waves might be caused by quantum gravitational forces, such as the collision of two black holes. If this is the case, then they should satisfy an ODE similar to what we analyzed in Section 5. The patterns produced by the wave detectors should be similar to the plots produced by the solutions of the ODE in (244) on page 23, though the scalar curvature term does not appear in the ODE since R(\u03b4ij) = 0, and in the case of black holes, R would be constant but different from zero, i.e., the ODE should contain a term, probably positive, with the factor t 2 3 , and most likely no contribution by the standard model fields.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nConflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest.\nReferences 1.
