1. **Development of aerogels with enhanced selectivity for uranium:** The current aerogels exhibit limited selectivity for uranium, which can be a significant drawback in real-world applications. Future research should focus on developing aerogels with surface modifications or functionalization that can enhance their selectivity for uranium over other metal ions and anions.

2. **Investigation of the adsorption mechanism at the molecular level:** While spectroscopic studies have provided some insights into the adsorption mechanism, a more comprehensive understanding is needed. Future research should employ advanced techniques such as EXAFS and DFT calculations to elucidate the specific interactions between uranium and the surface active groups of the aerogels.

3. **Optimization of the aerogel structure for uranium adsorption:** The structure of the aerogel, including its porosity, surface area, and pore size distribution, can significantly impact its adsorption capacity and efficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing the aerogel structure through tailored synthesis methods to enhance uranium adsorption performance.

4. **Development of aerogels for uranium recovery from industrial processes and wastewater:** The potential of aerogels for uranium recovery from industrial processes and wastewater has been demonstrated, but further research is needed to develop practical and scalable systems. This could involve the integration of aerogels into existing treatment processes or the development of novel recovery technologies.

5. **Exploration of the use of aerogels for the removal of other radionuclides:** While the focus of this review has been on uranium adsorption, aerogels may also be effective for the removal of other radionuclides from aqueous environments. Future research should investigate the adsorption behavior of aerogels towards a wider range of radionuclides, including those of concern in nuclear waste management and environmental remediation.
