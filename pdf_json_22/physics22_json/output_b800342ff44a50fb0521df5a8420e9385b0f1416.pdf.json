This diversity makes the study of emission-line ources particularly important to understand the composition and volution of our Galaxy. While some of these objects are frequently bserved, others might be intrinsically very faint and/or belong to he rarest types of stellar populations. Isolated H \u03b1-emitting sources nclude young stellar objects (YSOs), coronally active M-dwarfs, uminous blue variables, classical Be stars, and Wolf\u2013Rayet stars. ccretion-driven H \u03b1 emission can also be observed from interacting inaries such as cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotic stars, and ccreting neutron stars or black holes. These types of sources are not nly rare, but also difficult to both identify and precisely classify. 1\nE-mail: matteo.fratta@durham.ac.uk (MF); imone.scaringi@durham.ac.uk (SS) For instance, the list of CVs produced by Ritter & Kolb ( 2003 ) includes 429 objects.\nh t s S ( T\n2022 The Author(s). ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

Even though these source ypes do not present evidence of H \u03b1 emission, their intensities in aid band might still significantly exceed the ones of the objects they re compared to. An example is provided by the elusive population f low mass transfer rate CVs that ha ve ev olv ed be yond the soalled period minimum (Podsiadlowski, Han & Rappaport 2003 ; reedt et al. 2012 ; Pala et al. 2020 ). Among the several ways to dentify and classify stellar objects, the most telling is a moderateesolution spectroscopy. Ho we ver, spectra collection tends to be enerally e xpensiv e, in particular when attempting to classify large nsembles of targets. Similar issues also affect classification studies ased on light-curve analysis. In order to alleviate the burden, several pre-selection methods av e been dev eloped and applied o v er the years. A popular approach o pre-select targets is based on optical photometry; it deploys pecific colour and magnitude cuts to select targets for spectroscopy. pecifically related to H \u03b1 emission-line sources, Witham et al. 2008 ) leveraged photometric measurements from the Isaac Newton elescope Photometric H \u03b1 Surv e y of the Northern Galactic Plane\nis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative h permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nM\n( c t a t W t n t T a e s H a t\nF t c r c i M b m c s e a o p t i r t m c i d A c o o G m r\nC i s e h C o s\n2\n3\na p\n( d s o S \u223c W a t a s r\ni s I o F s o\n2\nT l \u2264 t m a m o 2 l p b t d m\nd t o c b t t o ( f H a z\n2\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/3/3301/6815736 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nIPHAS; Drew et al. 2005 ) to produce a list of \u223c5000 H \u03b1-excess andidates. These objects were selected by isolating H \u03b1-bright argets in the r\u2013H \u03b1 versus r\u2013i colour\u2013colour diagram (CCD), on field-by-field basis. More recently, Mongui \u0301o et al. ( 2020 ) produced he IGAPS catalogue, thus expanding and refining the work of\nitham et al. ( 2008 ). By testing \u223c53 000 000 targets for H \u03b1 excess, hey identified \u223c21 000 excess-line candidates relative to spatially earby sources in the sky, from IPHAS and UV-Excess surv e y of he Northern Galactic Plane (UVEX; Groot et al. 2009 ) surv e ys. hese \u2018position-based\u2019 selections are generally rather conserv ati ve, nd the amount of bogus detections is usually low. While Mongui \u0301o t al. ( 2020 ) did not pursue a spectroscopic confirmation of their election, Witham et al. ( 2008 ) observed the spectra of \u223c300 of their \u03b1-excess candidates. Out of them, 97 per cent were thus confirmed s emission-line sources. Ho we ver, position-based approaches, due o their conserv ati ve nature, may fail to identify some outliers.\nIn order to include these objects, Fratta et al. ( 2021 ; henceforth R21 ) developed a novel technique that prioritizes a better represen-\nation of the potential H \u03b1-emitting populations. This impro v ement an sometimes be achieved at the expense of a higher false-positive ate. Taking advantage of the Gaia DR2 parallaxes, their method onsisted in augmenting the classic position-based selection by dentifying H \u03b1-excess candidates relative to nearby sources in the G versus G BP \u2013G RP colour\u2013absolute 2 magnitude diagram (CMD)ased selection. Ho we ver, it is rele v ant to point out that the absolute agnitudes in the G band, as well as the colour indices, were alculated with the assumption of zero extinction, and therefore they hould be treated as upper limits. This contributes to increase the ffects of population mixing in this parameter space. The authors ssigned two significance values (or simply \u2018 significances \u2019, n \u03c3 ) 3 f H \u03b1 excess to each object in their meta-catalogue, one for each artitioning criterion (position-based or CMD-based): These defined he distance from the main stellar locus in IPHAS r \u2013H \u03b1 versus r \u2013 parameter space, expressed in units of standard deviation of the \u2013H \u03b1 distribution. The objects with at least one significance higher han three were identified as (3 \u03c3 ) H \u03b1-excess candidates. Out of \u223c7.5\nillion targets, this selection criterion yielded \u223c28 000 H \u03b1-excess andidates. To test the statistics of their selection, FR21 visually nspected \u223c2000 randomly selected spectra from LAMOST DR5 ata base (Cui et al. 2012 ), relative to a subset of their 3 \u03c3 outliers. mong these spectra, 49 per cent showed H \u03b1 emission; a more onserv ati ve 5 \u03c3 threshold yielded \u223c7000 outliers, and the purity f this cut was 82 per cent. Ho we ver, we point out that LAMOST bservation strategy privileges relatively blue, bright objects in the alaxy (Carlin et al. 2012 ). Therefore, an unconstrained crossatch with these data does not necessarily result in a homogeneous epresentation of the objects in the Gaia CMD. This study is part of a pilot program to validate and test the\nMD-based technique described in FR21 , while simultaneously dentifying and classifying new H \u03b1-excess sources. To this end, a et of spectroscopic follow-up observations of the brightest 5 \u03c3 H \u03b1xcess candidates from FR21 is presented. The targets examined ere are chosen in an attempt to homogeneously sample the Gaia MD. In addition, we discuss in Appendix A how the distribution of ur spectroscopically confirmed H \u03b1-emitters across the Gaia CMD, upplemented by UVEX and Wide-field Infrared Surv e y Explorer\nNRAS 518, 3301\u20133311 (2023)\nTo simplify the notation, in this paper the adjective \u2018absolute\u2019 is implicit. In FR21 , the authors refer to the significance just as \u03c3 . As \u03c3 is commonly ssociated to the standard deviation of a distribution, a different notation is referred in this paper.\nO S c\n4\nt\nWISE) parameter spaces, can be used to efficiently separate the ifferent populations. This is essential to ease the task of target election for large surv e ys such as the forthcoming WEAVE multibject fibers facility (Dalton et al. 2012 , 2018 ) or 4-m Multi-Object pectroscopic Telescope ( 4MOST ; de Jong et al. 2022 ). With its 1000 fibers, its large integral field unit (IFU), and 20 mini IFUs, EAVE will provide spectroscopic follo w-up observ ations for Gaia nd for the Low Frequency Array (Kassim et al. 2000 ) surveys, in he 370\u20131000 nm wavelength range, with intermediate ( R \u223c 5000) nd high resolution ( R \u223c 20 000). The 4MOST surv e y will be able to imultaneously obtain spectra for \u223c2400 objects, with a resolution ange comparable to WEAVE.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the nitial selection cuts employed to define our target list. Gemini pectroscopic observations and data reduction are also discussed. n Section 3 , our source classification is presented. In Section 4 , ur spectroscopic classification is used to test the CMD selection by R21 . In Appendix A , additional photometric parameter spaces for tellar population discrimination purposes are explored. In Section 5 , ur conclusions are drawn.\nOBSERVATI ONS A N D DATA R E D U C T I O N\nhe \u223c28 000 3 \u03c3 H \u03b1-excess candidates identified by FR21 are ocated in the Northern Galactic Plane, within the | b | \u2264 5 \u25e6 and 29 \u25e6\nl \u2264 215 \u25e6 coordinate ranges, and inside a 1.5-kpc radius relative to he Sun. 4 The distances were calculated with the parallax-inversion\nethod; the \u2018 \u03c0 / \u03c3\u03c0 > 5\u2019 constraint (with \u03c0 representing the parallax, nd \u03c3\u03c0 the corresponding uncertainty) for parallax measurements inimized the difference between this estimator and the distances btained with a probabilistic approach (Astraatmadja & Bailer-Jones 016 ). The availability of Gaia DR2 parallaxes enabled FR21 to ocate the objects in the CMD, and thus complement the classic osition-based H \u03b1-excess candidates selection with the novel CMDased technique. The results described in FR21 can be updated with he use of more precise Gaia DR3 parallaxes. Ho we ver, the average ifference between parallaxes from Gaia DR2 and EDR3 is 0.06 as, for all the targets inspected by FR21 . The H \u03b1-excess candidates from FR21 are represented by the grey ots in Fig. 1 . From their distribution in the Gaia CMD (top panel), hey can be tentatively visually divided into five groups. The regions f this parameter space occupied by each group are labelled with apital letters. Region A is usually associated to bright and relatively lue Be/Ae stars; CVs mostly populate region B, i.e. the area between he zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) and the white dwarf (WD) racks; the targets in region C are mainly pre-main-sequence (MS) bjects; D area is a predominantly populated by reddened red giants RGs), ho we ver, reddened Be stars and bright YSOs can also be ound; and E region is commonly associated to f aint M-dw arfs. o we ver, a classification based on this criterion is indicative at best, s it is strongly affected by population mixing effects, and by the ero-extinction assumption.\n.1 Sample selection\nur spectroscopic data were obtained at the Gemini (North and outh) telescopes, via a poor-weather queue. In order to reach a ompromise between a minimum required signal-to-noise ratio of\nHo we ver, we point out that this threshold does not constitute a hard cut, and he distance of some objects from the Sun exceeds 1.5 kpc.\nFigure 1.

While red colour refers to the H \u03b1-excess candidates selected in FR21 from both partition types, the targets depicted in blue were identified from CMD-partitions only. No objects in our sample were identified in positional-partitions only. The grey dots plotted in the background as a reference represent all the 3 \u03c3 outliers selected by FR21 .

In an attempt to obtain a omogeneous sample across the tentative clusters A\u2013E, our strategy as been to request follow-up observations of up to 2230 targets, ampled as evenly as possible across the Gaia CMD. Out of these 230 spectra, 114 were obtained (67 from Gemini North and 47 rom Gemini South ). These are displayed as the red and blue dots n the Gaia CMD and in the IPHAS CCD (top and bottom panels, espectively). The red candidates were identified by both positionased and CMD-based outliers selection; ho we ver, the blue ones were etected only by the CMD-based selection. None of these outliers\nesulted only from the position-based selection. As it can be seen n the top panel, the minimum-brightness constraint excludes, from ur spectral follow-up, all the H \u03b1-excess candidates that crowd the owest stripe of the Gaia CMD. Among them we can list, for instance, ll the objects that lie on (or around) the WD track. The bottom panel n the same figure brings out the value of the CMD-based selection echnique. In fact, a non-negligible amount of outliers from FR21 mainly blue dots) blends with the main stellar locus, in the IPHAS arameter space; without the prior population discrimination, these bjects would have been hidden.\n.2 Gemini spectra\nhe spectra analysed in this work were acquired with the Gemini ulti-Object Spectrograph (Allington-Smith et al. 2002 ; Hook et al. 004 ), with individual exposure times of 450 s. Gemini observatory onsists of two 8.1-m telescopes, based in Mauna Kea (Hawaii; emini North ) and in Cerro Pachon (Chile; Gemini South ), respeci vely. The observ ations were carried out between 2019 August and he end of 2020 January. The use of the R 400 grating yielded a pectral resolution at the blaze wavelength (764 nm) of R \u223c 1900. he obtained wavelength resolution is 1 \u00c5. The set-up of the detector caused systematic gaps in the data. o eliminate this effect, two spectra with different central waveengths (more specifically, 525 and 535 nm, respectively) were onsecutively collected for each target. 5 These two spectra were hen averaged, in order to associate one single spectrum to each ource in our list. Gemini raw data were reduced with the Image eduction and Analysis Facility Software System (Tody 1986 ) and he SAOImage DS9 tool (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory 000 ). The process involved a cosmic rays subtraction, as well as bias nd flat-field corrections. CuAr arcs were used during wavelength alibration step. Flux calibration could not be performed, because he poor-weather program did not include the observation of any ux standard objects. A spline function was instead fitted to the on-calibrated counts. During this procedure, the spectral lines were ask ed-out. The flux w as then divided by the spline. Fig. 2 displays n example of a reduced spectrum.

Our classification is made more solid with the upport of previous designations found in SIMBAD (Wenger et al. 000 ) data base (when available). Out of 114 targets, 32 are already abelled in SIMBAD. Our classifications confirm the ones found in aid data base for almost half of the matches (15/32). In the remaining 7 cases, SIMBAD does not provide unambiguous classifications: o we ver, 12 of these targets are classified as \u2018emission-line stars\u2019, our are labelled as \u2018variable stars\u2019, and one simply as \u2018star\u2019. The most common spectral features that distinguish the stellar opulations mentioned in Section 2 are the follo wing. Gi ven the istribution of our targets in the Gaia CMD, MS stars other than lassical Be stars and active M-dwarfs are also listed here:\n(1) MS stars (except for classical Be stars and acti v e Mwarfs) : Their spectra are characterized by absorption in the main almer and He lines (the latter ones are shown mainly in the hottest bjects of this category). Among them, \u03b3 -Doradus are typically A\u2013F pectral types stars, characterized by line-profile and radial velocities ariability (predominantly produced by g-mode oscillations; Kaye t al. 1999 );\n(2) Coronally-acti v e M-dwarfs : Molecular (TiO and CaH) aborption is one of the most prominent spectral features of (mainly arly type) M-dwarfs (Rajpurohit et al. 2018 ) due to the low tmosphere temperature. This population usually shows relatively arrow H \u03b1 (and sometimes Ca) emission lines due to coronal activity; (3) Be and Ae stars : The spectra of both these object types are haracterized by a blue continuum, with narrow H \u03b1 emission. Broad bsorption lines might be found in correspondence to the other almer lines. Furthermore, Fe II and O I emission lines might be bserved in the spectra of Be stars; ho we ver, Ae stars often show mission in some forbidden lines. One of the peculiarities of these lasses of objects is the high variability of the strength of the emission ines (Porter & Rivinius 2003 );\n(4) RGs : as red giants, these objects are characterized by a red ontinuum emission. Narrow absorption is commonly observed in he H \u03b1, He, and Fe II lines;C\n(5) YSOs : Due to the diverse nature of the pre-MS objects, their pectra can show very different features. Nonetheless, they usually resent an infrared (IR) excess, as well as the H \u03b1 line in emission. dditionally, TiO and VO molecular absorption bands can be often potted from T-Tauri stars and from Orion variables (Itoh et al. 2010 ). ources in this latter group might also present Paschen emission lines n their spectra (Hillenbrand, Hoffer & Herczeg 2013 ); (6) CVs : Generally characterized by a blue continuum, broad\nalmer \u2013 and often He \u2013 emission lines originate from the hot ccretion disc (Sheets et al. 2007 ; Han et al. 2020 ).\nTarget classification can be further supported by the analysis of he full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the H \u03b1 line. Henceforth, he acronym \u2018FWHM\u2019 will refer to the full width at half-maximum f the H \u03b1 line, unless otherwise specified. The width of a given ine can provide an indication for the presence of an accretion isc (in compact accretors): Due to Doppler broadening, disc-fed ccretors are characterized by relatively broad spectral lines. Out of he inspected spectra, 69/114 belong to confirmed H \u03b1-emitters, and he FWHM is measured for 68 of them. The peculiar shape of the \u03b1 line of one of our sources does not allow the measurement of its WHM, as testified by Fig. 3 . The distribution of our targets in the aia CMD, colour-coded with respect to their FWHM, is displayed n Fig. 4 . The H \u03b1-emitters (the coloured dots), are evenly spread on he CMD. The objects with the largest FWHM can be found between he ZAMS and the WD tracks. Said region of the Gaia CMD is\nNRAS 518, 3301\u20133311 (2023)\nommonly associated to accreting WDs; both these source types are haracterized by the presence of a disc surrounding the accreting bject (Smak 1992 ; Szkody 1992 ; Beltr \u0301an 2020 ; Zhao et al. 2020 ). he remaining 45 objects, characterized by absorption in the H \u03b1 line, re depicted by the turquoise triangles. These objects are discussed ater in the text.\nAs an outcome of our spectral classification, the examined data et is found to be a compound of: 35 MS stars (except for Be tars and M-dwarfs); 30 YSOs (while Marton et al. 2019 recently roduced a catalogue of more than 1.1 million of YSO candidates, elected from Gaia DR2 and WISE surv e ys with machine learning echniques); 18 Be stars (whereas the all-sky Be Star Spectra data ase described in Neiner et al. 2011 counts more than 2000 Be tars); 17 CVs (to be added to the 1429 CVs listed by Ritter & olb 2003 ); 10 RGs; and four active M-dwarfs (L \u0301epine & Gaidos 011 found \u223c9000 bright active M-dwarfs from the SUPERBLINK urv e y.

Ho we v er, the o v erlaps of these re gions learly demonstrate that the location in the Gaia CMD does not rovide enough information to unambiguously tie a source to a stellar opulation. For instance, a particularly dominant companion would ake it an extremely difficult task to discern a CV from a MS star; oreo v er, the bright and red tail of the YSO distribution seems to\nlend with the RGs; furthermore, distinguishing line emitting Be tars from common, bright, and MS stars can be very tricky.\nTESTING T H E CMD-BA SED DENTI FI CATI ON\nhe distribution of our sample in the Gaia CMD (top panel) and in the PHAS CCD (bottom panel) is shown in Fig. 7 .

Here, the dots represent the spectroscopically onfirmed H \u03b1-emitters, while the triangles display the absorbers. Out f the 69 emitters, 55 were selected by both the position-based and MD-based techniques. The remaining 14 emitters were obtained nly through the CMD-based method (no outliers in our sample were dentified by the position-based selection only), demonstrating the mpro v ements introduced by this selection in terms of completeness. his is further shown by the fact that the CMD-significance is higher han the position-significance for 45/55 of the common emitters. ll the 14 CMD-emitters are spectroscopically classified as YSOs. his confirms that the CMD-based method is more efficient than the osition-based one in identifying emission-line sources within this opulation (as also stated in section 5 of FR21 ). Out of the 45 absorbers, 28 (62 per cent) were selected by oth position-based and CMD-based selections. The remaining 17 bsorbers were identified only by the CMD-based method. The 45 bsorbers include 35 MS stars (other than classical Be stars and Mwarfs) and all the 10 RGs. The variability time-scale typical of these tellar populations is significantly longer than the \u223c10 yr that separate PHAS and LAMOST observations. For this reason, the photometric dentification of these absorbers as H \u03b1-excess candidates cannot be ustified solely on the basis of temporal v ariability. Ho we ver, it is ele v ant to stress that the algorithm presented in FR21 does not im at identifying H \u03b1- emitters , but rather objects that present an xcess in the H \u03b1 flux, with reference to nearby targets in the Gaia MD. Fig. 17 in FR21 shows two examples to visually explain his phenomenon. Out of the 10 RGs in our sample, seven were elected only by the CMD-based method. To test the reliability of his selection criterion in region D of the CMD, a group of outliers hat lie in that area is visually isolated. Considering that the vast\najority of them was identified only by the CMD-based method, the urity yielded by this selection criterion in region D of the Gaia CMD eems to be significantly lower than the one from the position-based\nNRAS 518, 3301\u20133311 (2023)\nelection. Ho we ver, half of the YSOs identified only by the CMDased method also lie in that area. The position-based selection alone ould have missed these outliers. A similar test is performed for the S stars population: The majority of the visually selected outliers long the ZAMS were identified only by the CMD-based technique. o we ver, 25/35 of the MS stars in our sample were identified by oth selections. Therefore, the position-based one does not seem o provide advantages in terms of purity, along the ZAMS. On the ther hand, one YSO that lies in the region was selected only by the MD-based technique. Table 1 summarizes how many members of each population in our ample were identified as H \u03b1-excess candidates by the CMD-based election and how many by the position-based one. The number f spectroscopically identified H \u03b1-absorbers in each population is rovided within the parentheses.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nR21 developed a method to identify H \u03b1-excess candidates with eference to nearby sources in the Gaia CMD. In this study, part of pilot-program to validate this CMD-based selection technique is resented. More specifically, its performances in terms of completeess are compared to those of classical position-based methods. Our nalysis involves the spectral observation and classification of 114 right ( r \u2264 17.5 mag) H \u03b1-excess candidates. These are drawn from group of 2230 5 \u03c3 outliers that homogeneously sample the Gaia MD. Their spectra were obtained by the two Gemini telescopes. able 1 shows how man y H \u03b1-e xcess candidates were identified by ach selection criterion, on a population-by-population basis. The mount of H \u03b1-absorbers in each group of objects is specified within arentheses. Since the spectra that present the H \u03b1 line in absorption elong to either RGs or MS stars (other than classical Be stars or cti ve M-dwarfs), H \u03b1 emission v ariability seems to be discarded as\nFigure 7.

The last paragraph f Section 3 sho ws ho w the distribution of our sample in the Gaia MD can be used as indication to classify H \u03b1-excess sources. This\nNRAS 518, 3301\u20133311 (2023)\ntudy shows how this information can be augmented with additional iagnostics, to ease a spectroscopic classification. The physical and hemical properties of diverse source types can affect wider different ass-bands out of the Gaia ones. Additional information from luer/redder pass-bands can thus better inform on the exact class. The optical photometry from Gaia is complemented here with ltraviolet and IR intensities. These are leveraged from UVEX and ISE surv e ys, respectiv ely. The UVEX started in 2006, and it is ased on the island of La Palma (Spain). With the same set-up s IPHAS, the Wide Field Camera mounted on the Isaac Newton elescope provides U , 6 g , r , and He I5875 magnitudes for targets in | b | 5 \u25e6 (Groot et al. 2009 ; Mongui \u0301o et al. 2020 ), up to 22 mag. Its main ask consists in the identification of new Galactic stellar remnants. n the other hand, the WISE is an all-sky survey funded by NASA hat was launched in 2009 December. In 6 months, it scrutinizes he IR properties of the entire sky in four bands ( W 1, W 2, W 3, and 4), centred at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 \u03bcm (Wright et al. 2010 ). With ts 4 million pix els, this surv e y achiev es a remarkable sensitivity: ore than 1000 times better than InfraRed Astronomical Satellite Neugebauer et al. 1984 ) in the 12- \u03bcm band, and 50 000 times etter than Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment (Smith, Price & aker 2004 ) in the two mid-IR bands. Thanks to its features, WISE s particularly efficient in detecting (even old, faint) brown dwarfs, ltra-luminous infrared galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quasitellar objects.\nOut of the 114 H \u03b1-excess candidates in our dataset, 78 have an vailable measurement in UVEX U , g , and r bands, whilst 73 have ssociated W 1, W 2, and W 3 WISE measurements. 7 A cross-match etween these two groups yields 57 matches, i.e. half of our data et. The non-detection of a source carries valuable information for lassification purposes, per se. In fact, objects that appear to be too aint (or too bright), in relation to the limiting magnitudes of the urv e y, are not detected. Among the 36 objects in our sample that are ot included in UVEX surv e y, 27 are MS stars 8 (one of them being Be star), and eight are RGs. These two populations are usually aint in UVEX bands, as confirmed by the fact that the MS stars and Gs included in UVEX are among the faintest objects in our sample, n the U band. The faintest target in our sample sets a lower limit f U MS/RG > 21.3 mag on the apparent magnitude of the remaining S stars and RGs in our sample. Similarly, 23 MS stars (including hree Be stars and one M-dwarf) and 13 CVs have no detections n WISE bands. The sources in these categories with also a WISE ounterpart are among the faintest in all WISE bands of interest. The 1 MS/CV > 14.8 mag, W 2 MS/CV > 14.8 mag, and W 3 MS/CV > 12.7 ag constraints for the remaining MS stars and CVs in our sample re set by the faintest objects with WISE counterparts. Fig. A1 shows the locations in the M U versus g\u2013r CMD 9 (top anel) and in the W 2\u2013W 3 versus W 1\u2013W 2 CCD (bottom panel) f all the objects with valid measurements in the corresponding ands. Limiting the analysis to the H \u03b1-emitting populations, a visual nspection of the three parameter spaces combined shows that Be tars and YSOs seem to be better separate in UVEX CMD than in he Gaia CMD. CVs are clearly bluer compared to the ZAMS in\nTable A1. Results of our spectroscopic classification.
