    "abstractText": "Leaf senescence accompanied by yellowing and Rubisco degradation occurs prematurely in response to various stresses. However, signaling pathways between stress perception and senescence responses are not understood fully, although previous studies suggest the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While investigating the physiological functions of autophagy in Physcomitrium patens using wild-type (WT) and autophagy-deficient atg5 strains, we found that Physcomitrium colonies senesce prematurely under dark or nitrogen-deficient conditions, with atg5 senescing earlier than WT. In the present study, we measured cellular H2O2, and examined whether H2O2 mediates premature senescence in Physcomitrium colonies. Methyl viologen, an ROS generator, increased cellular H2O2 levels and caused senescence-like symptoms. H2O2 levels were also elevated to the same plateau levels in WT and atg5 under dark or nitrogen-deficient conditions. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine and the ROS source inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibited the increase in H2O2 levels as well as senescence. Upon transfer to a nitrogen-deficient medium, H2O2 levels increased earlier in atg5 than in WT by ~18 h, whereas atg5 yellowed earlier by >2 days. We conclude that the increased H2O2 levels under dark or nitrogen-deficient conditions mediate premature senescence in Physcomitrium but do not explain the different senescence responses of WT and atg5 cells.",

            "text": "Leaf senescence is a degenerative process in which leaf cells and tissues are degraded. During senescence, cellular components, including chlorophyll and the Rubisco protein, are degraded, and the degradation products, including amino acids and sugars, are transported from the senescing leaf to adjacent or distant organs. Leaves typically senesce after reaching maturity; however, leaf senescence can be induced prematurely by a variety of stresses, such as darkness, nutrient starvation, drought, and salinity. Autophagy is one of the pathways in which cells degrade their own components. During autophagy, a portion of the cytoplasm is transported to lysosomes and/or vacuoles, where it is degraded [1]. The various autophagy types include macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperon-mediated autophagy, of which macroautophagy is widely\nPlants 2022, 11, 2280. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11172280 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2022, 11, 2280 2 of 14\ncharacterized. In macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), cytoplasmic components are enclosed in an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome or vacuole and is degraded into amino acids and nucleotides. The amino acids are reused in protein synthesis or energy production through oxidation. Autophagy is executed and controlled by various autophagy-related (Atg) proteins [2]. The signaling pathways in premature senescence from stress perception to senescence responses are not fully elucidated. However, previous studies have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in these pathways. First, it has been reported that increased ROS levels mediate the premature senescence of leaves in plants under drought stress [3]. Specifically, the cellular H2O2 level increases and premature senescence occurs in Arabidopsis leaves under drought stress; however, in Arabidopsis mutants deficient in the expression of ROS-generating enzymes, H2O2 levels are reduced and senescence is delayed [3]. In addition, increased H2O2 levels increase during NaCl-induced senescence in sweet potato have been reported [4]. The study also found that a calmodulin inhibitor decreased H2O2 levels and inhibited premature senescence [4]. Second, cellular H2O2 levels are shown to increase during natural senescence in Arabidopsis and oilseed rape, and senescence is delayed by reducing H2O2 levels through the overexpression of exogenous proteins that scavenge H2O2 [5,6]. Third, increased H2O2 levels are observed in Arabidopsis autophagy-deficient mutants that exhibit earlier senescence [7,8]. In addition, several studies have indicated that cellular ROS levels are elevated in response to abiotic and biotic stress [9,10]. Collectively, these results suggest that ROS, especially H2O2, are mediators between stress perception and senescence responses. We have been investigating the physiological significance of autophagy in plants using the moss Physcomitrium patens. This moss has the property of undergoing homologous recombination with DNA introduced into cells with high efficiency, and techniques for disrupting specific genes have been developed [11]. We also reasoned that the simple cellular structure and few cell types of Physcomitrium protonema colonies would facilitate physiological analysis at the cellular level. In a previous study, we constructed ATG5 gene knockout (atg5) mutants and found that Physcomitrium protonema colonies show stress-induced senescence symptoms similar to those in green leaves and that atg5 mutants senesce earlier than the wild-type (WT) under dark or nitrogen starvation conditions [12]. In the present study, we investigated whether H2O2 is a mediator between the perception of stress, i.e., darkness and inorganic nitrogen starvation, and senescence responses, including yellowing and Rubisco degradation, in WT and atg5 mutants of Physcomitrium. As we found that H2O2 acts as a mediator of premature senescence, we further investigated whether increased H2O2 levels account for the difference in senescence responses between WT and atg5 cells. However, we found that increased H2O2 did not explain the earlier premature senescence phenotype of atg5 mutants that occurred under dark or nitrogen starvation conditions."

Conversely, the result also supports the notion that yellowing is caused by MV-produced ROS under light conditions. Premature senescence induced by darkness or nitrogen starvation is accompanied by a decrease in Rubisco content [12]. Thus, we also examined the effect of MV treatment on Rubisco content. WT and atg5 colonies were transferred into liquid BCDATG medium containing MV and cultured under light conditions. Rubisco levels per fresh weight (FW) decreased significantly 5 d after MV treatment in both WT and atg5 strains (Figure 2B, MV), although these levels were also reduced by the control treatment (DMSO) due to the increase in water content in the colonies upon initiation of liquid culture. Notably, the MV-induced decrement in Rubisco content was higher in atg5 colonies than that in WT colonies, indicating that MV facilitates the net degradation of Rubisco and does so more drastically in the atg5 mutant relative to the WT strain. Taken together, these results show that MV treatment induces senescence symptoms, yellowing, and net Rubisco degradation in Physcomitrium."

In contrast, H2O2 levels did not differ between atg5 and WT colonies after 2\u20133 d following their transfer to the dark or after 1\u20132 d following their transfer to nitrogen-starvation medium, and these times correspond to the time immediately before yellowing occurred in atg5 colonies.

            "text": "In this study, we found that MV, an H2O2 generator, increased cellular H2O2 levels and reproduced senescence-like symptoms, e.g., yellowing and Rubisco degradation (Figures 2A and 3), in Physcomitrium colonies. Furthermore, we showed that cellular H2O2 levels increased under conditions of darkness and inorganic nitrogen starvation, both of which induced premature senescence. Moreover, we showed that reducing cellular H2O2 levels using NAC and CCCP treatments decelerates premature senescence. Based on these results, we conclude that H2O2 is a mediator between senescence-inducing stress, such as darkness and inorganic nitrogen starvation, and the symptoms of senescence, such as yellowing and Rubisco degradation, in Physcomitrium cells. We also investigated whether increased H2O2 levels explain the different senescence responses of the WT strain and atg5 mutant and concluded that factors other than higher H2O2 levels should be considered when attempting to explain these differences. H2O2 levels increased from 70\u2013100 to 150\u2013200 \u00b5moles/kg FW in Physcomitrium cells upon darkness or nitrogen starvation treatment (Figures 4 and 5). Cellular H2O2 levels are generally thought to be maintained by H2O2-producing and degrading reactions. Specifically, ROS are produced as byproducts of several metabolic pathways in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes or produced directly by NADPH oxidase, after which they converge with H2O2, which is decomposed by cellular H2O2-scavenging enzymes, such as catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and antioxidants including glutathione and ascorbic acid. During natural senescence in Arabidopsis and rapeseed,\nPlants 2022, 11, 2280 12 of 14\nelevated H2O2 levels are due to decreased levels of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase [5]. Activation of NADPH oxidase also contributes to H2O2 production in response to osmotic stress in Arabidopsis [14]. In our study, increased H2O2 levels during stress treatment were reduced by CCCP treatment, which is thought to inhibit ROS production via the ETC of mitochondria and chloroplasts, suggesting that the ETCs of these organelles contribute to H2O2 production under our experimental settings. However, even in the presence of CCCP, H2O2 levels were higher than those detected before stress treatment (Figure 7), indicating that H2O2-producing and/or -scavenging reactions other than those that occur via ETCs, including those involving NADPH oxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, might also contribute to H2O2 production. H2O2 levels increased and reached the same plateau levels in WT and atg5 cells under both dark (Figure 4) and inorganic nitrogen starvation conditions (Figure 5), although senescence in atg5 cells occurred earlier than that in WT cells under both conditions (Figure 1). Therefore, the difference in senescence responses between WT and atg5 cells, such as the rate and extent of senescence, cannot be explained by differences in H2O2 plateau levels. The time course of H2O2 levels after the start of nitrogen starvation treatment varied significantly between WT and atg5 cells over 18 h (Figure 9A). Specifically, H2O2 levels were elevated earlier or accelerated in atg5 cells than in WT cells; however, the difference in the time lag required for H2O2 levels to reach a plateau was no more than 18 h (Figure 9A), which is not sufficient to explain the time lag in the yellowing response, which is longer than 2\u20133 d (Figure 1). Similarly, treatment with MV elevated H2O2 levels in a similar manner to the same plateau levels in WT and atg5 cells (Figure 3) although the senescence response did differ between the two cell types (Figure 2; Supplemental Figure S1). These results suggest that higher H2O2 levels act as a trigger of senescence but not as an amplifier of senescence and that the rate and/or extent of senescence is predetermined before the colonies are treated with MV or placed on nutrient-starvation medium. The symptoms of senescence in WT cells are probably alleviated by the constitutive autophagy that occurs in the cells before stress is applied. This notion is supported by the findings in Physcomitrium [12], showing that expression of the senescence marker genes PpSEN1 and PpSAG12 is higher in atg5 cells than that in WT cells before dark treatment. Therefore, it is likely that the atg mutants were preparing for senescence during culture on nutrientsufficient medium under light conditions. It has been shown that accelerated natural senescence in Arabidopsis atg mutants is attributable to the higher accumulation of salicylic acid and the consequent activation of salicylic acid signaling; however, even when salicylic acid levels are maintained low by expressing bacterial salicylic acid oxidase in atg mutants, dark-induced senescence remains accelerated [7]. In Physcomitrium cells cultured on nutrient-sufficient medium under light, salicylic acid levels do not differ significantly between WT and atg5 cells (personal communication, Dr. Seo). Thus, we still need to determine the factors that are responsible for the difference of premature senescence responses between WT and atg5 cells."

For the nitrogen starvation treatment, we used an inorganic nitrogen-depleted BCDATG medium, in which KNO3 was removed and ammonium tartrate was replaced with potassium tartrate in the BCDATG medium.\nPlants 2022, 11, 2280 13 of 14"

Approximately 0.05 g fresh weight of colonies was homogenized with 1 mL 25 mM H2SO4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7 g for 5 min. Subsequently, 100 \u00b5L of the resulting supernatant was mixed with 1 mL of FOX solution consisting of 150 \u00b5M ammonium ferrous sulfate (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), 150 \u00b5M xylenol orange (398187, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) and 100 mM sorbitol (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) in 25 mM H2SO4. The mixture was incubated in the dark for 20 min, after which A560 was measured. Commercially available H2O2 (084-07441, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Osaka, Japan) was used as a standard."

The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7 g and 4 \u25e6C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was collected and mixed with the same volume of 2-fold-concentrated SDS sample buffer (Cosmo Bio Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and the mixture was boiled at 100 \u25e6C for 2 min. The proteins were then loaded into each lane on the basis of FW and separated on SDS-polyacrylamine gels (10%, Ready Gel model E-T10L e-PAGEL, Atto Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), after which they were stained using Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Merck, Rahway, NJ, USA). Relative intensities of the Rubisco band were quantitated using Image J (im-agej.nih.gov/ij/download/). The highest value of the band was set as 100%."

However, increased H2O2 levels do not explain the earlier senescence phenotype in autophagy-deficient mutants.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/plants11172280/s1, Supplemental Figure S1. Senescence-like symptoms in atg3, atg7, and ATG5 (in which the Phycomitrium ATG5 gene was introduced into the atg5-3 mutant) mutant Physcomitrium colonies were induced by methyl viologen (MV) treatment under light conditions. Colonies of atg3, atg7, and ATG5 mutants were transferred onto and cultured on a BCDATG agar medium containing MV (0, 100, and 500 \u00b5M) under light conditions. Individual colonies in each treatment group were photographed successively immediately (0 d), 3, 5, and 7 d after the transfer. Scale bar: 2 mm; Supplemental Figure S2.
