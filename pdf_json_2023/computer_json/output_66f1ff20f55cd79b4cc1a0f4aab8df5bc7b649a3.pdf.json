    "abstractText": "Cross-lingual adaptation has shown effectiveness in lowresource spoken language understanding (SLU) systems However, existing approaches often show unsatisfactory performance on intent detection and slot filling, especially for distant languages, which are dramatically different from source language in scripts, morphology, or syntax. To solve the aforementioned challenges, we propose l,lltent \u5207alogue Action (LaDA) layer to optimize decoding strategy. The model consists of an extra latent dialogue action layer. It enables our model to enhance a system's ab\u5c71ty to handle conversations in complex multi-lingual intent and slot value of distant languages. To our best knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive study of the use of latent variables for cross-lingual SLU policy optimization during decode stage. LaDA achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot and few-shot adaptation both on public datasets",
