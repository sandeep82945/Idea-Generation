    "abstractText": "At present, the study of the neurotropic activity of polyunsaturated fatty acid ethanolamides (N-acylethanolamines) is becoming increasingly important. N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine (synaptamide, DHEA) is a highly active metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with neuroprotective, synaptogenic, neuritogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties in the nervous system. Synaptamide tested in the present study was obtained using a chemical modification of DHA isolated from squid Berryteuthis magister liver. The results of this study demonstrate the effects of synaptamide on the astroglial response to injury in the acute (1 day) and chronic (7 days) phases of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) development. HPLC-MS study revealed several times increase of synaptamide concentration in the cerebral cortex and serum of experimental animals after subcutaneous administration (10 mg/kg/day). Using immunohistochemistry, it was shown that synaptamide regulates the activation of GFAPand S100\u03b2-positive astroglia, reduce nNOS-positive immunostaining, and stimulates the secretion of neurotrophin BDNF. Dynamics of superoxide dismutase production in synaptamide treatment confirm the antioxidant efficacy of the test compound. We found a decrease in TBI biomarkers such as GFAP, S100\u03b2, and IL-6 in the blood serum of synaptamide-treated experimental animals using Western blot analysis. The results indicate the high therapeutic potential of synaptamide in reducing the severity of the brain damage consequences.",

            "text": "According to clinical studies, 80\u201390% of all TBI cases may be classified as a mild form (mTBI), but they represent a serious problem of modern health care due to the development of significant long-term consequences. Maladaptation of glial activation is the main cause of these pathological transformations. Glial cells play a critical role in brain remodeling during injury and secondary neuroinflammation development. Astrocytes are known to be sensitive to changes in the extracellular environment and serve as critical early responders to brain injury [1]. Under pathophysiological circumstances, astrocytes respond to brain injury through a variety of molecular and cellular mechanisms called reactive gliosis [1,2]. Structural and biochemical changes occurring in astrocytes during the CNS injuries have a wide variability depending on the severity of the injury. Reactive astrocytes activate the production of ATP and extracellular Ca2+ [3], recruit immune cells from the peripheral blood [4], regulate the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier [5], participate in post-traumatic synapse remodeling [6], and also contribute to neuroprotection by activating the production of neurotrophins. In this regard, the impact on astroglia through pharmacological agents seems to be the most promising therapeutic treatment strategy of the mTBI consequences. Currently, research into various natural compounds as therapeutic agents for the treatment of CNS injuries is gaining popularity. These substances\nMar. Drugs 2022, 20, 538. https://doi.org/10.3390/md20080538 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/marinedrugs\nusually have less toxicity and interactions with other drugs [7,8]. To date, there is a massive amount of preclinical data showing the presence of a positive therapeutic effect of drugs containing\u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their derivatives in acute brain damage [9]. \u03c9-3 PUFAs exhibit anti-inflammatory activity due to the synthesis of resolvins, protectins, and maresins (bioactive mediators with pro-resolvent properties) [10]. In addition, PUFAs stabilize the cell membrane, making it more resistant to damage and more amenable to nerve impulse conduction [11]. The most important pathological factor in TBI is the neuroinflammatory response, so the treatment of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), which has anti-inflammatory properties, seems to be very promising. Ndocosahexaenoylethanolamine (synaptamide, DHEA) is an endogenous endocannabinoidlike metabolite synthesized from DHA [12]. Synaptamide has a complex effect similar to that of DHA, but much more pronounced [13]. Our previous study demonstrated that synaptamide reverses the cognitive deficits caused by mTBI and also reduces post-traumatic neuroinflammation [14]. This study is a continuation of previous work and is aimed at a more detailed study of the synaptamide effects in rat TBI model."

            "text": "Using the HPLC-MS method, it was found that synaptamide, even after a single subcutaneous injection demonstrates multiple increases in serum DHEA concentration. In this study, synaptamide was administered for 7 days after surgery. Day 1 and day 7 of the synaptamide administration were considered as control periods at which the measurement of the studied parameters took place. On the day 1 (in 24 h after the first injection), the level of DHEA rises by almost 25 times. A similar trend is observed on the 7th day after mTBI (Figure 1A). Interestingly, synaptamide therapy also affects serum concentration of N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA), which doubles. However, under injury conditions, the synaptamide treatment have no influence on the AEA concentration (Figure 1B). mTBI changes the lipid composition of the brain lead to a decrease in DHEA (Figure 1C) and AEA concentration (Figure 1D). Surprisingly, the 7-day administration of synaptamide in the setting of trauma restore the cortex DHEA, but not AEA, levels to control values."

            "text": "The use of blood biomarkers is a supplementary tool for assessing the severity of the brain damage and temporal profiles of the mTBI development. The main proteins expressed in the blood during TBI (GFAP, S100\u03b2 and IL-6) were analyzed by Western blotting of the blood serum of experimental animals. Data are normalized to \u03b2-Actin. GFAP, a protein of intermediate filaments of the astrocytic cytoskeleton, has been successfully used to assess the severity of damage and predict outcomes in acute TBI [15]. Our data confirm the previously published results [16] on the increase in the GFAP concentration in the blood serum after mTBI. Moreover, there is a tendency to progression of GFAP expression and accumulation from 1 to 7 days. After 24 h, the concentration of serum GFAP exceeds the control values by 65%, and after 7 days of the experiment, this difference is about 88% (Figure 2A,D). Therapy with synaptamide, even with a single injection in animals with mTBI, induces a decrease in serum GFAP concentration relative to those in the \u201cmTBI\u201d group.\nIn many studies, S100\u03b2, a calcium-binding protein that is predominantly expressed in astroglia, applied to assess the extent of injury in the acute care clinical setting [17]. In the present work, Western blotting revealed a significant increase in the concentration of S100\u03b2 protein in the blood serum of animals with mTBI compared to Sham-operated animals. We found an increase in the concentration of the S100\u03b2 protein in the blood serum of animals with mTBI from day 1 to day 7, which indicates the progression of secondary brain damage a week after the injury induction (Figure 2B,D). Synaptamide therapy causes a significant decrease in the concentration of serum S100\u03b2 on day 1 by 20%, and on day 7 the downward trend persists, but there is no significant difference between the \u201cmTBI\u201d and \u201cmTBI+Syn\u201d groups. After TBI, both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are upregulated and their combined activity determines the overall degree of inflammation [18]. Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is a biomarker for various disease states, including TBI [19]. mTBI causes an increase in the IL-6 concentration in the blood serum both after 24 h (by 16%) and after 7 days of the experiment (by 55%) (Figure 2C,D). On the day 1, synaptamide therapy restored the studied parameter to control values, and after 7 days a decreasing\ntendency in the IL-6 concentration was seen; however, no significant difference was found between the \u201cmTBI\u201d and \u201cmTBI+Syn\u201d groups."

After mild or diffuse TBI, as well as in the perifocal zones around focal CNS lesions, large areas of functioning tissue contain astrocytes in a state of reactive gliosis [20]. Evaluation of GFAP+ immunostaining showed an increase in astroglial activity in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex of animals with mTBI on the first day of the experiment (Figure 3A). After 24 h, both the area of immunostaining and the number of GFAP+ cells per mm3 increase, while synaptamide therapy reduces astrogliosis to the level of Sham-operated animals (Figure 3C,D). At the same time, on the day 7 in the groups of animals treated with synaptamide, astroglial activity reached the level of the \u201cSham\u201d group (Figure 3A,C,D).\nAs an intracellular regulator, another astrocytic marker S100\u03b2 stimulates cell proliferation and migration, inhibits apoptosis and differentiation, as well as astrocyte activation,\nwhich may be important for brain recovery after CNS damage [21]. Figure 3B,E demonstrates that S100\u03b2 production is increased after mTBI at both periods of the experiment. Synaptamide inhibiting the expression of S100\u03b2 in astrocytes for a period of 24 h does not have a similar effect after 7 days."

            "text": "Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a local neuronal messenger and neuromodulator, is widely expressed in nervous tissue [22]. In CNS trauma, nNOS is the main effector of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity pathways [23], and is also an inducer of DNA damage due to enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO) and its highly reactive metabolite peroxynitrite [24]. The data of immunohistochemical studies demonstrate the effect of synaptamide on the nNOS production in the rat brain (Figure 4A). The area of nNOS+ neurons immunostaining doubles in both periods of the experiment. Synaptamide reduces nNOS synthesis almost to control values (Figure 4B).\nAfter TBI, a complex of oxidative stress markers is produced in the brain (carbonylated proteins, lipid peroxides, reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species), while the synthesis of antioxidant defense enzymes (GSH, GPx, GR, GST, G-6PD, SOD, CAT) is reduced. One of the most important endogenous antioxidants is the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), which rapidly catalyzes the dismutation of O2\u2212 into H2O2 and oxygen. It has been established that mTBI causes a significant decrease in the SOD enzyme on day\n1, and synaptamide, after the first injection, increases its production even above the level of Sham-operated animals. However, after 7 days, the administration of synaptamide does not affect the synthesis of the enzyme, while mTBI causes a significant increase in SOD (Figure 4C)."

At the same time, NAAA/ASAHL is a lysosomal enzyme, while FAAH is an enzyme localized in the endoplasmic reticulum [26]. It has been established that inhibition of NAAA/ASAHL affects the development of neuroinflammation to a greater extent than inhibition of FAAH [27]. NAAA/ASAHL is highly expressed in macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, and in peripheral tissues. Our data show that astrocytes also use NAAA/ASAHL to neutralize excess synaptamide. The results of Western blotting indicate a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of the enzyme when synaptamide is added to the culture medium (Figure 5C).\nBDNF is one of the most widely distributed and well-studied neurotrophins in the mammalian brain. The effect of synaptamide on BDNF protein expression was assessed by Western blotting of a primary culture of astrocyte cells. The data shown in Figure 5C indicate an increase in the synthesis of neurotrophin, depending on the increase in the concentration of synaptamide. The immunolocalization of the BDNF protein in the rat cerebral cortex is shown in Figure 5A. The BDNF+ cell pool is heterogeneous and includes both neurons and glial cells. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates no effect of synaptamide therapy on BDNF synthesis in the rat brain on the 1st day of the study; however, there is a significant increase in immunoreactivity induced by mTBI. On the 7th day after injury, the synthesis of neurotrophin in the brain of animals from the mTBI group, on the contrary, decreases compared to the Sham-operated animals. At the same time, under the injury conditions, the synaptamide treatment sharply increases the zone of BDNF-immunopositive staining (Figure 5B)."

            "text": "Previously, we have already shown that synaptamide therapy in mTBI causes an improvement in cognitive functions, such as the level of anxiety and long-term memory, as well as a decrease in the development of post-traumatic neuroinflammation mediated by specific pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative damaging mediators, such as NO, ROS, and nitrites [14]. In the present study, we explored the repair mechanisms implemented by modulating astrogliosis, the production of neurotrophins, nitric oxide, and enhancing the antioxidant defense of the brain during the treatment of mTBI with synaptamide. Synaptamide when administered subcutaneously (dose 10 mg/kg) has good bioavailability. Lipid chromatography data suggest that there are multiple increases in DHEA in rat serum after a single injection. There is also a slight increase in AEA on the 1st and 7th days of experiment, but only in the group of Sham-operated animals. Probably, the concomitant increase in AEA occurs due to the redistribution of the NAAA/ASAHL enzyme toward DHEA substrate. The activity of this enzyme increases in the primary rat astrocytes when synaptamide is added to the culture medium. Synaptamide therapy also increases the concentration of DHEA and AEA in the cerebral cortex. However, it is interesting that the injury itself causes a sharp decrease in NAE in the brains of animals after mTBI. There is evidence to support a decrease in endocannabinoid levels in the ipsilateral cortex at day 155 after severe TBI [28]; however, this effect in mild TBI was described for the first time. Currently, many clinical studies confirm the importance of serum biomarkers in characterizing the severity and temporal profiles of TBI development. They allow tracking progression, predict clinical outcomes, and provide information on current pathophysiological changes [29]. In the present study, plasma protein S100\u03b2, GFAP, and IL-6 are detected in serum and show clear time profiles during the week after mTBI, which is consistent with earlier biomarker studies in TBI [30]. Treatment with synaptamide, apparently reducing the severity of damage, inhibits the production of mTBI biomarkers. Micro- and astroglia play a crucial role in the adaptation of the brain to damage and secondary neuroinflammation development. Neuron-glial interaction is aimed at homeostasis maintaining, viable cells protecting, and cell debris utilizing. Reactive astrogliosis influences various processes that occur after injury, including (1) regulation of inflammation, (2) isolation of injury and protection of adjacent neural tissue, (3) regulation of blood-brain barrier permeability, and (4) modulation of synaptic plasticity and neural circuit reorganization [1]. Astrocytes contain dense networks of intermediate filaments such as GFAP. Mechanical damage associated with TBI disrupts the integrity of these networks and serves as a trigger for astrocyte deformation, determining the appropriate course of reactive astrogliosis and triggering the upregulation of GFAP and other intermediate filaments [31]. Our immunohistochemical data indicate an increase in GFAP expression on the 1st day after injury. However, by the 7th day in the \u201cmTBI\u201d group, both the area and the amount of GFAP+ astroglia decreased to the control level, which may indicate the\ndepletion of adaptive capabilities. During the initial stages of damage, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is activated in reactive astrocytes, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), \u03b1-chemokines, cyclooxygenase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 [32]. Astrocyte-driven neuroinflammation is maintained by other cell populations, such as microglia/macrophages, as well as lymphocytes recruited from the peripheral blood. Our previous studies demonstrate an increase in the inflammatory activity of microglia and the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines only on the 7th day after surgery [14], while on the first day microgliosis is not so pronounced [33]. In the delayed period of TBI, astrocytes perform a rather neuroprotective function by secreting neurotrophins and participating in synapse remodeling through the production of extracellular matrix molecules [34]. The depression of GFAP+ astroglia observed in mTBI is leveled out by synaptamide therapy. After 7 days, the proliferation of GFAP+ cells is activated both in the \u201cSham+Syn\u201d and \u201cmTBI+Syn\u201d groups. Whereas the inflammatory component of secondary brain damage is reduced during synaptamide therapy [14]. Another astrocytic marker S100\u03b2 is a functional protein that exhibits its activity depending on the concentration of extracellular calcium [35]. A significant increase in extracellular calcium caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of ion channels, or brain cell death in TBI triggers astrocyte transformation and activation, as well as the synthesis of S100\u03b2. In the present study, the amount of S100\u03b2+ astroglia in trauma doubled on day 1 of the experiment, and decreased by day 7, but remained significantly higher than the control values. Synaptamide suppresses S100\u03b2 synthesis 24 h after injury; however, after 7 days, no significant difference was found between the \u201cmTBI\u201d and \u201cmTBI+Syn\u201d groups. Probably, in this case, synaptamide affects astroglial cells by inhibition of neuroinflammation, a decrease in glutamate production and excitotoxicity, reducing concentration of extracellular calcium, and preventing cell damage and death [3,4,36]. NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor that induces the expression of several pro- and antiapoptotic genes, is one of the major triggers for inflammation [37]. TNF\u03b1 and NMDA receptor activation induces NF-\u03baB-mediated increase in BDNF synthesis [38]. Increased BDNF concentrations trigger neuroprotective mechanisms in cortical and hippocampal neurons [39,40]. In the presented study, it was found that on the first day after injury, the number of BDNF+ cells increase sharply compared to the \u201cSham\u201d group, while after 7 days, the adaptive capacity is probably depleted and BDNF synthesis decreases. It is known that chronic activation of NF-\u03baB through the expression of a constitutively active form of the kinase NF-\u03baB (IKK2) inhibitor beta-subunit, leading to neuroinflammation and decrease in the BDNF level, which correlates with cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Notably, when chronic NF-kB activation is turned off, BDNF expression and neurogenesis are restored [41]. Synaptamide increases the level of cAMP in cells and inhibits the translocation of the RelA subunit (p65\u2014the main transcription factor of the NF-\u03baB pathway) into the nucleus [42]. The addition of synaptamide at concentrations of 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M leads to a dose-dependent increase in BDNF synthesis in primary astrocytes. Synaptamide also enhances the synthesis of BDNF in vivo in the cerebral cortex of experimental animals. On the 7th day of the experiment, the staining area of BDNF+ cells in the \u201cmTBI+Syn\u201d group significantly exceeded that of the \u201cmTBI\u201d group. Our results are supported by the literature data that describe improvements in BDNF-mediated physiological functions such as learning and memory in TBI rats supplemented with DHA [9]. Over-activation of astrocyte N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) and associated activation of nNOS play a critical role in neuronal death in TBI [43]. The mechanism of cell damage is associated with the aberrant activity of nNOS, leading to the formation of a large amount of peroxynitrite. Production of neuronal peroxynitrite in TBI causes calpain activation and consequently damage to neurons and their axons [44]. Our data indicate that nNOS production increases on the 1st day after injury and remains above control values for a week. Synaptamide reduces the production of nNOS at both periods of the experiment, thereby protecting neurons from the toxic effects of NO and peroxynitrite. Another mechanism of neuronal oxidative damage is based on excessive production of ROS\nand depletion of the endogenous antioxidant system, which causes peroxidation of cellular and vascular structures, protein oxidation, and inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain [45]. The enzyme SOD, which converts O2\u2212 to H2O2 and oxygen, has been extensively studied and demonstrates therapeutic potential in a variety of disease models exhibiting excitotoxicity, including an in vitro of NMDA-induced neuronal culture [46] and in vivo model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats [47]. In addition, the SOD enzyme, through the regulation of redox balance, plays a critical role in various biological processes, including inflammation, autophagy, and cell survival [48]. The presented data indicate an endogenous SOD concentration increase in 24 h after synaptamide administration in both Sham-operated and injured animals. This is consistent with the previous data obtained in the primary culture of astrocytes with the addition of synaptamide at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M [49]. However, in \u201cmTBI\u201d group, the growth in SOD activity is observed one week after the surgery, when neuroinflammation was most pronounced [14]. At the same time, the effect of treatment on the 7th day was not pronounced. Probably, synaptamide, reducing neuroinflammation, creates conditions for oxidative balance, in which there is no necessity for hyperproduction of SOD, which remains at the level of Sham-operated animals in the \u201cmTBI+Syn\u201d group. The data obtained are consistent with our previous results, where the ability of synaptamide to reduce the level of microgliosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines in mTBI, as well as ROS, NO, and nitrites production in LPS-induced inflammation was reveled in microglial cell culture [14]. The results of this study indicate the wide range of synaptamide glial-based and neuroprotective effects, emphasizing its high therapeutic potential."

Western Blot ECL Substrate (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to carry out the chemiluminescence reaction (1 mL of substrate per membrane, 5 min). Visualization was performed using the ChemiDoc gel documentation system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). The resulting images were analyzed using the ImageLab software package."

            "text": "The cerebral cortex of rats (n = 7 animals/group) were taken for the analysis of Nacylethanolamines (NAE). The animals were anesthetized, after which each brain was quickly extracted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221270 \u25e6C until use. Internal standard 0.1 nM (22:0-NAE) was added to each rat brain sample, followed by lipid extraction according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959) [53]. The final lipid residue was reconstituted in 1 mL of ice-cold CHCl3, purged with argon, and stored at \u221270 \u25e6C until high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was performed. NAE analysis by HPLC-MS was achieved by Ascentis C18 analytical column (2.1 292 mm \u00d7 100 mm \u00d7 3-micron, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and LC-MS 8060 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectra were obtained during ionization in an electric field in the positive ion detection mode. Mixtures were analyzed by multiple reaction\nmonitoring (MRM). The ion source parameters were set at: interface temperature 380 \u25e6C; desolvation line temperature 250 \u25e6C; nebulizing gas (N2) flow\u20143 L/min; drying gas (N2) flow\u20143 L/min; and heating gas (dry air) flow\u201417 L/min. Collision energy was optimized for each compound individually. The molecular ion and fragment for each compound measured were as follows: 348\u219262 for AEA, 372\u219262 for DHEA, and 384\u219262 for the internal standard (22:0-NAE). Quantification of each NAE in the tissue samples was achieved using LabSolution (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) followed by comparison of the peak area with the internal standard peak area."
