1. **Investigate the effects of climate change and population growth on the production of other major crops in China, such as rice, maize, and soybeans.** This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts of these factors on China's food security.


2. **Examine the potential impacts of climate change and population growth on the global food trade.** This would help to identify countries that may be at risk of food shortages and those that may be able to increase their food production to meet the growing demand.


3. **Develop adaptation strategies to help farmers cope with the impacts of climate change on wheat production.** This could include developing drought-resistant and heat-tolerant wheat varieties, improving irrigation systems, and providing farmers with access to information and resources to help them adapt to changing conditions.


4. **Explore the potential for increasing wheat production through the use of new technologies, such as precision agriculture and genetic engineering.** This could help to offset the negative impacts of climate change and population growth on wheat production.


5. **Conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties associated with the projections of wheat production under climate change and population growth.** This would help to identify areas where more research is needed to improve the accuracy of the projections.
