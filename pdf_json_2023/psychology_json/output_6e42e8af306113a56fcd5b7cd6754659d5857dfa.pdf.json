These data provide information on an important component of the bornavirus replication complex.\n1. Introduction\nMammalian Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) is a pathogen in the Bornaviridae family that causes neurological complications, and in some cases encephalitis and death (Hoffmann et al., 2015; Tappe et al., 2021). Other members of the Bornaviridae have been found to infect both avian and reptilian species (Kuhn et al., 2015; Rubbenstroth, 2022). Early reports on the virus suggested a causal role in many psychiatric disorders; however, this is no longer widely accepted (Rubbenstroth et al., 2019).\nBornaviridae are members of the order Mononegavirales, the members of which are nonsegmented negative-sense viruses (nsNSVs) with a single linear RNA genome (Rubbenstroth et al., 2021). While most members of the order replicate in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, currently only the Bornaviridae and a subset of plant-infecting Rhabdoviridae have been described to replicate in the cell nucleus (Jackson et al., 2005; Rubbenstroth et al., 2021).\nBoDV-1 has the smallest genome of the Mononegavirales order, at 8.9 kilobases, which encodes at least six viral proteins (Fig. 1a; Rubbenstroth et al., 2021). Similar to other nsNSVs, the virus encodes proteins which facilitate cellular entry (glycoprotein), virion formation (matrix protein) and genome transcription and replication (nucleoprotein, large protein and phosphoprotein). BoDV-1 contains a viral accessory protein (X protein) which is poorly understood and is implicated to have a range of functions (Wensman et al., 2013; Fujino et al., 2012). Together, the nucleoprotein (N), large protein (L),\nISSN 2053-230X\nPublished under a CC BY 4.0 licence\nphosphoprotein (P) and the viral RNA form a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. The viral N protein encapsulates the viral genome, protecting it from cellular nucleases. The L protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and carries out transcription and genome replication. The P protein is a cofactor of the L protein and appears to also interact with the viral X protein (Fujino et al., 2012).\nIn members of the Mononegavirales order, the P protein plays two discrete roles while in complex with the L protein. One function is to tether the L protein to the RNP complex via interaction with RNA-bound N (Green & Luo, 2009). The second function is to bind and recruit RNA-free N (also denoted N0), which is added to newly synthesized RNA (Leyrat et al., 2011; Yabukarski et al., 2014; Guryanov et al., 2016; Leung et al., 2015; Renner et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017; Aggarwal et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2022). Phosphoproteins appear to have a globally conserved structure with a central oligomerization domain flanked by largely unstructured Nand C-termini (Cardone et al., 2021).\nStructures of phosphoprotein oligomerization domains of viruses within the Mononegavirales order have been determined both alone and in complex with other viral proteins. The most widely studied are those from the Paramyxoviridae, which have been shown to form tetramers with oligomerization mediated by a large coiled coil (Blocquel et al., 2014;\nBloyet et al., 2019; Bruhn et al., 2014; Communie et al., 2013; Cox et al., 2013; Tarbouriech et al., 2000). This tetrameric assembly has also been observed in complex with the viral L protein (Abdella et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2021). The oligomerization domain of Filoviridae forms trimers under certain crystallization conditions (Bruhn et al., 2017; Zinzula et al., 2019), while forming tetramers when in complex with the L protein (Yuan et al., 2022). There are two examples of Rhabdoviridae P-protein oligomerization domains from rabies virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, which each form different dimeric assemblies (Ding et al., 2006; Ivanov et al., 2010). One Pneumoviridae oligomerization domain has been determined in isolation (Leyrat et al., 2013) and in complex with the L protein (Cao et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020), with all of the structures showing oligomerization as a short, coiled-coil tetramer.\nIn the present study, we present the structure of the phosphoprotein oligomerization domain from BoDV-1, revealing a tetrameric assembly in solution and in a crystal structure. Analysis of the structure shows a helix-breaking motif, which combined with the pitch of the helix causes displacement of the helices. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and in silico model generation suggest the unresolved N- and C-termini to be highly flexible in solution. Our study shows a close similarity to phosphoproteins from paramyxoviruses.\n52 Jack D. Whitehead et al. Borna disease virus 1 phosphoprotein Acta Cryst. (2023). F79, 51\u201360"

A primary-sequence search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) yielded no models with sufficient similarity for use as a search template for molecular replacement. Attempts were made to use ab initio models from ARCIMBOLDO (Caballero et al., 2018); however, these were unsuccessful. To leverage developments in protein prediction methods, a model was generated using the ColabFold implementation of the AlphaFold2 algorithm (Mirdita et al., 2022).\nActa Cryst. (2023).

These solutions showed the features that would be expected in a correctly phased map, including connected helical density and molecules which would pack to form a lattice; however, subsequent refinement of these models did not decrease the Rfree or improve the map quality. The data set was expanded to P1 and molecular replacement was run again, searching for a truncated tetrameric oligomerization domain comprising residues 95\u2013145. This solution contains two antiparallel tetramers. The P1 solution was then refined with iterative rounds of manual model building in Coot (Casan\u0303al et al., 2020) and refinement in phenix.refine (Afonine et al., 2018). Refinement in Phenix was carried out with torsion-angle noncrystallographic symmetry restraints and two TLS groups describing the region N- and C-terminal to the helix-breaking motif for each chain.\nAttempts to extend the resolution of the usable data did not lead to a more interpretable map, to an improved fit to the data or to improved model statistics. After the model was complete in space group P1, Zanuda (Lebedev & Isupov, 2014) was used to determine whether a higher order space group could be used. No alternate space groups were found that yielded solutions that could be refined satisfactorily. Analysis of space group P1 using phenix.xtriage suggested that pseudo-merohedral twinning may be present in the data. Refinement using either automatic twin refinement in REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011) or manual input of the twin law in phenix.refine resulted in a decrease in both Rwork and Rfree by 6% using REFMAC5 and by 2% using phenix. refine. However, the resulting 2Fo Fc electron-density maps were of notably poorer quality compared with the P1 maps\n(Figs. 2a and 2b). From these analyses, we concluded that twin refinement should not be included in the final processing of our data.\nFinal structure-solution and refinement statistics can be found in Table 3.

To first confirm that the protein was correctly folded and achieve an initial understanding of the fold, we performed circular-dichroism spectroscopy. The spectrum showed minima at 208 and 222 nm and a maximum at 193 nm, which is a characteristic spectrum of a highly\n-helical protein (Fig. 1c). Further analysis of the spectrum using BeStSel (Micsonai et al., 2018) predicts the protein to be 62% helical (good helix-1, 47%; distorted helix-2, 15%) and the rest of the structure to be 6% sheet, 5% turn and 27% other. This initial assessment suggests that the protein may be structured similarly to the Paramyxoviridae or Pneumoviridae proteins.\n54 Jack D. Whitehead et al. Borna disease virus 1 phosphoprotein Acta Cryst. (2023). F79, 51\u201360\nTo determine the oligomeric state of the protein, we used SEC-MALLS and applied protein at concentrations of 1\u20134 mg ml 1. At all concentrations, we observed a symmetric elution peak with a consistent retention of 23.5 min (Fig. 1d). The coincident peaks suggest no concentration dependence of the oligomerization. The calculated protein molecular mass of the peak was approximately 82 kDa, which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular weight of a phosphoprotein tetramer of 90 kDa. The mismatch between the calculated and predicted molecular weight may arise from minor degradation of the phosphoprotein, which was observed even in freshly purified sample (Fig. 1b).\nTo determine the stability of the protein, we carried out thermal melt experiments using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The melt experiment showed two distinct transitions at 59.7 and 68.3 C corresponding to two unfolding events (Fig. 1e). By analogy to other phosphoproteins, this could correspond to dissociation of the oligomer into protomers and subsequent unfolding of the coiled-coil domain\n(Bruhn et al., 2017). Next, we sought to understand the molecular details of the oligomerization of the phosphoprotein."

The crystal form contains large gaps between the ordered proteins of 29\u201345 A\u030a; presumably, this volume partially or fully contains the unresolved N- and/or C-terminal residues. The A\u2013D tetramer is essentially identical to the E\u2013H tetramer (r.m.s.d. of 0.31 A\u030a for equivalent C atoms).

Analysis of the structure shows a classical repeating heptad repeat, with hydrophobic residues forming \u2018knobs-in-holes\u2019 packing with hydrophobic residues from adjacent chains (Fig. 3e) (Walshaw & Woolfson, 2003).\nThe helix-breaking motif, formed by residues Cys125, Asp126, His127 and Ser128 (Fig. 3b, inset), causes a rotational displacement of the chain by approximately 90 such that the C-terminal helix of one chain sits above the N-terminal helix of an adjacent chain in the tetramer. Surprisingly, the N-terminal and C-terminal helices are parallel, in contrast to the coiled-coil trimers/tetramers observed for paramyxovirus (Abdella et al., 2020; Blocquel et al., 2014; Bloyet et al., 2019; Bruhn et al., 2014; Communie et al., 2013; Cox et al., 2013; Tarbouriech et al., 2000) and filovirus (Bruhn et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022; Zinzula et al., 2019) phosphoproteins, which twist around each other, placing the N-and C-termini of each chain above those of the adjacent chain.

In this work, we present the structure of the BoDV-1 phosphoprotein, showing it to be a stable tetramer both in solution and when crystallized. Tetramerization is important for at least two reasons. Firstly, during replication a tetrameric phosphoprotein will be able to maintain a higher local concentration of N0, which can readily bind RNA that is exposed as part of the replication process, minimizing the chance of recognition by the host. Secondly, the phosphoprotein needs to bind to L as well as to the N-RNA nucleocapsid (via N), so the tetrameric nature of P, containing multiple similar or identical interaction sites, allows it to act as a molecular chaperone binding simultaneously to these different components of the replicase complex. While this work was in preparation, Tarbouriech and coworkers published a similar structure of the BoDV-1 phosphoprotein oligomerization domain complemented by functional studies showing the importance of the helix-breaking motif (Tarbouriech et al., 2022)."
