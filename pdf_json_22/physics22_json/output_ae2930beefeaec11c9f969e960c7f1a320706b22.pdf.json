    "abstractText": "For a long time, transverse optical forces with continuous-wave laser beams have been used for non-contact manipulation of micro-scale objects. By replacing the continuouswave lasers with pulse-mode lasers many novel physical effects related with the influence of Poynting vector on the longitudinal part of the optical force can be observed. The following question arises: What is the impact of this longitudinal addition to the optical force, connected with the flow of energy, on the ensemble of thousand particles in continuous media? The aim of this work is to find analytical expressions of the radiation force and potential densities arising from a laser pulse propagating in a dielectric media. This allows us to find an effective averaged longitudinal real force at the level of the laser pulse\u2019s spot. The obtained force is proportional to the initial pulse energy and inversely proportional to its time duration. In the femtosecond region the force becomes strong enough to confine neutral particles into the pulse envelope and translate them with the group velocity in gases. Additionally, if the trapped particles into the pulse\u2019s spot are with high density, the probability of collision with the free atoms and molecules in air become significant. The collision energies are in the range of 12 24 GeV and high enough to ionise the neutral atoms. Thus, a new type of collision ionisation can be observed, when powerful femtosecond pulses propagate in gaseous media.",

The analytical expression of the radiation force on one individual particle is obtained in dipole approximation and as it is well known, is proportional to the transverse gradient of the square of the electrical field. In case where the CW regime is replaced with optical pulse propagation, additional terms associated with the Poynting vector and the flow of energy appear [3, 4]. The forces are connected with the polarization of atoms and molecules, and depending of the initial power, the nonlinear polarization can play a significant role [5]. The question, what kind of radiation forces applied to ensemble of neutrals with linear and nonlinear polarization, from a laser pulse in continuous dielectric media is still open. In this paper is obtained and discussed the analytical expressions of the longitudinal radiation force density, and after integration \u2013 the effective real force at the level of the pulse width in approximation of first order of dispersion. The influence of the nonlinear polarization on the radiation force is considered. The obtained force density is proportional to the first derivative of the pulse time envelope, while the real force at the level of the pulse width is inversely proportional to\nthe pulse time duration. This is the reason the force to vanish in CW regime, while in the femtosecond region leads to trapping of particles into the pulse envelope. When the trapped particles into the pulse\u2019s spot are with high density, the probability of collision with the free atoms and molecules in air becomes significant."

In these regimes the transfer shape (the spot) of the pulse does not change of few diffraction lengths, and the flow of energy is in a surface orthogonal to the propagation direction.

In this way an effective real force at the\nlevel of the pulse spot expressed in conventional units is\n     \n0\n0 02\n12\n2\n0\n0 02\n12\n2\n2\n66 t\nE In\nc\nv\nz\nE In\nc\nv F grgrP\nz   , (25)\nwhile for the potential is obtained\n   002122\n2\n6 EIn c\nv U grP\nz   , (26)\nwhere 0E is the initial energy of the laser pulse. The optical force, as gradient ones, is inversely proportional to the longitudinal length or temporal duration of the laser pulse. The long pulses are with relativelly small gradient in respect to femtosecond ones and thus, this force usually is negligable. Comparing the expressions in the braskets one can see again that the nonlinearity does not add significant valuses for intensities up to 21312\n0 10 cmWI  . That is why in the present examples we\ncalculate the linear part of the force and potential only. Here a question arises - How deep is the radiation potential in air?

            "text": "The investigations in the previous section point that a confinement into the pulse envelope of neutral atoms or molecules (nitrogen\u2019s N and oxygen\u2019s O2) in air can be realized by femtosecond optical pulses, propagating in diffraction-free regime (with power values less than the critical one for selffocusing [6]) or in nonlinear wave-guiding regime [7-9]. These regimes correspond to initial pulse\nenergy in the range from 10 nJ up to 1-2 mJ (pulse duration around fst 1000  and\nwidth mmd 1010  ). Let\u2019s now assume that the trapped into the pulse envelope particles move\nalong with the group velocity. Then, the kinetic energy of translation of one nitrogen atom can be given as\n GeV vm E grNkinetic\nN 12 2\n2\n , (30)\nwhile the energy of translation of one oxygen molecule is in the order of\n GeV vm E grokinetic\nO 24 2\n2\n2\n2  . (31)\nThe probability of collision with the free atoms and molecules in air become significant if we realize the high density of trapped particles into the pulse\u2019s spot. The collision energies in order of 12-24 GeV are higher enough from the energy of ionization of neutral atoms. Consequently, we can expect a new regime of collision ionization when femtosecond pulses propagate in gases. The main differentiation from the well-known multi-photon and tunnel ionizations, where all processes are included into the pulse width, and depend from intensity, the new ionization regime will realizes one conical emission of charged particles, due to the collisions between trapped particles and free ones."

            "text": "Up to now, the basic experimental and theoretical investigations in the field are related to the study of radiation forces generated by laser beams and pulses acting on individual Rayleigh dielectric particles. In this paper the impact of the radiation force on continuous media (air) and an ensemble of neutral particles is explored. In the employed approach, the applied individual force to an atom is transformed to density force per volume. It is further considered that the optical response of dielectric media, connected with the propagation of laser pulses, is no stationary and nonlinear. As a result, analytical expression for the longitudinal density force and density potential of Gaussian laser pulse propagating in gaseous media is obtained. The recent theoretical and experimental results for diffraction-free regime [6] and nonlinear wave guiding propagation [7-9] of ultra-short femtosecond laser pulses, facilitate and enable the simplification and integration of these densities utilizing the first order of dispersion approximation in optics. Consequently, an effective longitudinal potential and force, acting in the media at level of the pulse width are obtained. The longitudinal radiation force depends on the time duration of the laser pulse. As the laser pulse duration decreases the force strength increases. In air the longitudinal potential of Gaussian laser pulse with energy of 1mJ is of twelve orders of magnitude greater than the Boltzmann energy of free particles. An important finding of this research is the demonstrated governed conditions under which the neutral particles can be confined in the pulse envelope and to move along with the group velocity. When the trapped particles into the pulse\u2019s spot are with high density, the probability of collision with the free atoms and molecules in air becomes significant. The collision energies are in 12 - 24 GeV range and are sufficient to ionize the neutral atoms. Therefore, a new type of collision ionization can be observed, in condition of powerful femtosecond pulse propagation in air. It is noteworthy to mention that the main difference of this new type of collision ionization from the multi-photon and tunnel ionizations, where all processes are included into the pulse width. Thus, the new ionization regime will realizes one conical emission of charged particles, due to the collisions between trapped particles and free ones.\nFurthermore, the dipole interaction of the moving neutral particles with the electromagnetic field\nwill be at the carrier to envelope frequency  0CEF ph grk v v   ) instead the main ones \u03c90. This type of oscillation is in the sub-THz range for gases, THz in solids, and can be measured in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the laser pulse propagation. The dipole oscillation measured in the direction of propagation will be again with carrying frequency \u03c90 due to the Doppler effect. In nonlinear regime the neutral trapped particles will not generate at the third harmonics, but at a frequency proportional to three times carrier to envelope frequency  grphTHz vvk  033 . Such coherent sub THz (94 GHz) is experimentally observed in air [11, 12] and in different type glass plates [13-16] and explained theoretically by an avalanche parametric conversion mechanism [13].\n8.
