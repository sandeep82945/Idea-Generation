    "abstractText": "Puerariae Flos, a representative homology plant of medicine and food for alcoholism, has a long history of clinical experience and remarkable curative effect in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, its effective forms and hepatoprotective mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, a strategy based on UPLC-QTOF MS combined with mass defect filtering technique was established for comprehensive mapping of the metabolic profile of PF in rat plasma, urine, bile, and feces after oral administration. Furthermore, the absorbed constituents into plasma and bile with a relatively high level were subjected to the network analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and molecular docking to clarify the potential mechanism. Finally, the therapeutic effect of PF on ALD and predicted mechanisms were further evaluated using a rat model of alcohol-induced liver injury and Western blot analysis. In total, 25 prototype components and 82 metabolites, including 93 flavonoids, 13 saponins, and one phenolic acid, were identified or tentatively characterized in vivo. In addition, glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, hydroxylation, and reduction were observed as the major metabolic pathways of PF. The constructed compound\u2013target\u2013pathway network revealed that 11 absorbed constituents associated with the 16 relevant targets could be responsible for the protective activity of PF against ALD by regulating nine pathways attributable to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, and lipid regulation as well as inflammation and immune regulation. In addition, four active ingredients (6\u2032\u2032-Oxylosyltectoridin, genistein-7-glucuronide-4\u2032-sulfate, tectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate, and 6\u2032\u2032-O-xylosyltectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate) as well as two target genes (MAO-A and OPEN ACCESS",

However, its effective forms and hepatoprotective mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, a strategy based on UPLC-QTOF MS combined with mass defect filtering technique was established for comprehensive mapping of the metabolic profile of PF in rat plasma, urine, bile, and feces after oral administration. Furthermore, the absorbed constituents into plasma and bile with a relatively high level were subjected to the network analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and molecular docking to clarify the potential mechanism. Finally, the therapeutic effect of PF on ALD and predicted mechanisms were further evaluated using a rat model of alcohol-induced liver injury and Western blot analysis. In total, 25 prototype components and 82 metabolites, including 93 flavonoids, 13 saponins, and one phenolic acid, were identified or tentatively characterized in vivo. In addition, glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, hydroxylation, and reduction were observed as the major metabolic pathways of PF. The constructed compound\u2013target\u2013pathway network revealed that 11 absorbed constituents associated with the 16 relevant targets could be responsible for the protective activity of PF against ALD by regulating nine pathways attributable to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, and lipid regulation as well as inflammation and immune regulation.

            "text": "With the development of social economy, alcohol drinkers have been increasing in recent years. Alcohol abuse and\nalcoholism have emerged as common public health problems all round the world (Addolorato et al., 2016). As an important organ responsible for alcohol metabolism, the liver is the main target organ for alcohol toxicity. Accordingly, the incidence rate of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) caused by long-term heavy drinking is increasing year by year (Mathurin and Bataller, 2015). Therefore, exploring the effective treatment of ALD has become a particularly important issue which captures the attention of academic research. At present, the treatment of ALD largely relies on three medications or health products, namely, synthetic alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor fomepizole (Gonz\u00e1lez-Santiago et al., 2009), commercial plant extracts of Camette Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (Milk Thistle) and hydrodol tablets imported from Denmark and Australia (Rambaldi et al., 2005; Abenavoli et al., 2010), and an extract of oyster powder known as the Haiwang Jinzun tablet. However, their application is restricted due to side effects (hypotension, slow heartbeat, etc.), high price that depends on import, and\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\nsafety problems incurred by the influence of fresh storage and marine pollution on raw materials. Overall, the drugs for treatment of ALD enjoy huge market capacity and potential in two respects. First, it has a stable and huge beneficiary population. Second, it is in a situation where imported drugs are dominant and domestic new drugs are obviously scarce.\nThere have been some records of \u201calcohol injury,\u201d \u201calcohol jaundice,\u201d and \u201calcoholism\u201d in ancient Chinese medicine books for a long time. As an important part of traditional Chinese medicine, some ethnic and edible medicines have rich clinical experience and remarkable curative effect in the treatment of ALD, and they are valuable and prospective for drug research and development. Puerariae Flos (PF), known as \u201cGe-hua\u201d in Chinese, is botanically from the dried flowers of Pueraria montana var. thomsonii (Benth.) M.R. Almeida or P. montana var. lobata (Willd.) Maesen and S.M. Almeida ex Sanjappa & Predeep. As a homology plant of medicine and food, it has been traditionally used to relieve toxic symptoms caused by excessive alcohol consumption, such as hangover, nausea, headache, and red face in China, Japan, and Korea for over 1,500 years (National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine \"Chinese Materia Medica\" Editorial Committee, 1999). Consequently, PF has been considered as the most representative antidote in traditional medicine. In clinical application, compound preparations such as Gehua Jiecheng Decoction (\u845b\u82b1\u89e3\u9172\u6c64) and Jiusuyu (\u9152\u901f\u6108) are its main forms, which have regulatory and protective effect on the nervous system and the liver caused by alcohol. Meanwhile, diet therapy is also the embodiment of the clinical application of PF. Products of medicine food homology including functional slimming food\u2014PILLBOX Onaka, PF tea, and beverage have become increasingly popular among Asian people. Recent pharmacological studies showed that extracts and compounds from PF possessed various bioactivities, such as hepatoprotective (Xiong et al., 2010), hypoglycemic (Lee et al., 2000), hypolipidemic (Lee et al., 2000), estrogenic (Shin et al., 2006), and anti-inflammatory effects (Yuan et al., 2009). With respect to the chemical constituents of PF, more than 80 compounds have been isolated and identified to date (Qu, 2014), among which, isoflavanoids and triterpenoid saponins are two major types of constituents and play important roles in its pharmacological effects. In addition, five isoflavanoids kakkalide, irisolidone, 6\u2033- O-xylosyltectoridin, tectoridin, and tectorigenin have been proved for potential medicinal values and regarded as important phytochemical markers for quality evaluation and differentiation between species under PF (Lu et al., 2013).\nAccording to the concept of \u201ceffective forms\u201d and \u201cadditive effect\u201d of pharmacodynamics substances of TCMs, only the constituents and/or metabolites that are successfully assimilated into the circulatory system and maintain a considerable concentration level by additive effect in target organs may exert curative effects. In the past decade, the metabolism of PF isoflavanoids in vitro has been reported by\nsome scholars (Hirayama et al., 2011). Our research group have also been devoting our efforts toward their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) characteristic by column separation, ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS), and NMR spectroscopy (Bai et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2011a; Bai et al., 2011b; Qu et al., 2012; Wang H. et al., 2013; Wang S. et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Qu et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). A total of ten urinary and biliary metabolites have been isolated and structurally identified, and the plasma pharmacokinetics as well as urinary and biliary excretion of the conjugated metabolites was also determined in rats after oral administration. The results indicated that glucuronidation and/or sulfation after deglycosylation at the C-7 position was the major metabolic pathway of isoflavanoids from PF in vivo. In addition, kaikasaponin III, soyasaponin I, and kakkasaponin I were the most abundant saponins in PF and showed powerful protective effects against liver damage in the previous study, which are also responsible for the overall curative effects of PF (Kinjo et al., 1999). However, to the best of our knowledge, no reports have described the global metabolic profile of triterpenoid saponins or whole plant extract of PF in vivo. Moreover, pharmacological mechanisms and bioactive components of PF for the treatment of ALF are still not clear.\nIn this study, the absorbed and excreted prototypes and metabolites of the extract of Pueraria montana var. thomsonii (Benth.) M.R. Almeida in rat plasma, urine, bile, and feces were first characterized by UPLC-QTOF MS. Furthermore, with subsequent visualization of \u201cingredient\u2013target\u2013pathway\u2013disease\u201d association network constructed by using a network analysis and the binding interactions between key ingredients with targets performed by molecular docking simulation, the potential active components and underlying pharmacological mechanisms for the effect of PF on ALDwere explored. Furthermore, the predicted key targets of PF against ALD were validated in an alcohol-induced liver injury rat model, which would promote better application of PF, which is a medical resource for developing a supplement food or an herbalmedicine for the treatment of ALD (Graphic abstract)."

P18 and P20 with precursor ions detected atm/z 911 (M\u2212H)\u2212 are a pair of isomeric with an identical elemental composition of C47H76O17. Both displayed a series of characteristic fragment ions at m/z 765, 615, 457, and 437 by simultaneously losing sugar units including 146 Da (rhamonose), 132 Da (arabinose, xylose), 176 Da (glucuronosyl), and 18 Da (H2O) at the site of C-3. They were ascribed to astragaloside VIII and soyasaponin II, respectively (Lu et al., 2013). Similarly, P19 was identified as soyasaponin I according to our previous reports (Lu et al., 2013). The metabolites M78 and M81 exhibited the protonated molecular ion at m/z 635.4177 (C36H60O9) and m/z 649.4307 (C37H62O9), which were 2Da (2H) and 16 Da (CH2+2H) higher than that of the soyasapogenol B-3-\u03b2-D-glucuronide, suggesting that both were reduced and methylated metabolites. The reduction at 12,13-double bond of the C ring is a metabolic pathway for saponins such as \u03b1-hederin (Liang et al., 2014), which was also reduced to hydrogenated metabolite in rat feces by the gut microflora. Accordingly, M78 and M81 were tentatively identified as reduct-soyasapogenol B-3-\u03b2-D-glucuronide and methyl-reduct-soyasapogenol B-3-\u03b2-D-glucuronide based on the aforementioned researches. Similarly, M82 with m/z 473.3635 (C30H50O4) was 16 Da (O) higher than that of aglycone, which was identified as 1-hydroxyl-soyasapogenol B because C-1 was the active site according to the related research (Yu et al., 2016).\nP22~P25 andM77 could be grouped because they possess the same aglycone sophoradiol. P22~P25 were identified as kaikasaponin III, kaikasaponin I, kakkasaponin I, and baptisiasaponin I by comparison with the identified constituent in PF extracts, respectively (Lu et al., 2013). M77 exhibited a protonated molecular ion at m/z 749.4461 (C41H66O12), which was 30 Da (-CH2-O) lower than that of kakkasaponin I (P23). Thus, it was demethylated and dehydroxylated metabolite of P23. Since there is only one hydroxyl substituted at C-22, M77 was deduced as dimethyl22-dehydroxyl-kakkasaponin I. Analogously, M79 andM80 were identified as methylated and C1, C21-dihydroxyl of aglycone soyasapogenol E based on the similar metabolic pathway of saikosaponin G and glycyrrhetinic acid (Gao et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2016)."

Among them, the interaction between MAO-A and compounds M3, M11, and M16 and PPAR-\u03b1 and M16 presented the best performance. P15 andM16 were selected as representative prototype components and metabolites, respectively. Their binding mode in the active site of MAO-A and PPAR-\u03b1 has been shown in a three-dimensional pattern in Figure 4B.\nAs for MAO-A, P15 showed two H-bond interactions with PHE208 and ALA68, which were C-7 and C-4\u2032 phenolic hydroxyls on the A and B rings, respectively. M16 showed eight H-bond interactions as follows: four hydroxyl groups on glucose with Gly443, Gly49, ARG51, and THR52; three hydroxyl groups on xylose with THR435, SER24, and ALA27; and a phenolic hydroxyl at C-4\u2032 on the B ring with GLN215. While Gly443 and ILE23 were involved in the N-H Bond interactions with a representative MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide, the former was also the connection site of M16 with MAO-A.\nAlong the similar lines, interaction between P15 and PPAR-\u03b1 showed three H-bond interactions, a phenolic hydroxyl, and a carbonyl group from the isoflavonoid skeleton with ASN219; a methoxy group and a phenolic hydroxyl on the A ring with ALA333; and a methoxy group on the A ring with TYR334. Similarly, M16 showed five H-bond interactions, two phenolic hydroxyls with ASN219 and ALA333, and three hydroxyl groups on glucose and xylose with THR279, Glu286, and Gly335.

Thus, exploring the constituents absorbed and excreted in vivo can narrow the screening scope of effective forms and build a foundation for the follow-up mechanism research of PF in treating various diseases. In the present study, a global metabolic profile of PF including the identification and classification was provided by detecting the metabolites in rat plasma, urine, bile, and feces after oral administration owing to high sensitivity of the UPLC-QTOF MS system. Moreover, the relative content of the prototypes and metabolites in the four biological samples were determined to evaluate the contribution of different metabolic reactions in vivo. As shown in Table 1, two categories of the parent compounds and related metabolites, including flavonoids and saponins, were observed in rat biological samples. The saponins were only detected in urine and feces in the form of prototypes or metabolites that were produced from phase I metabolism, such as hydroxylation, dehydroxylation, methylation, demethylation, and reduction. The flavonoids were generally speculated to be the bioactive components, and the effective forms should be absorbed into blood with appropriate concentrations.\nIf we evaluate the contribution of different metabolic reactions to the metabolite formation according to their number and relative content, we could find that sulfation and glucuronidation are both major metabolic reactions for PF flavonoids. The route of in vivo metabolism or biotransformation for flavonoids is a process to transform them into more hydrophilic metabolites, which not only\nFIGURE 6 Potential molecular mechanism of PF acting on ALD.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org14\nenhanced their oral absorption and bioavailability but also enhanced the excretion from the body via the bile and urine. O\u2019Leary et al. (2003) demonstrated that the isoflavone conjugates formed at intestinal are easy to be transported into the hepatocytes and then excreted into the bile. Moreover, hepatic uptake and efflux transporters on the basolateral membrane participate in drug elimination, which can facilitate endogenous compounds and metabolites with poor membrane permeability to transport into hepatocytes (Funk, 2008). Except for some conjugated metabolites that were eluted in bile, deconjugated by intestinal microflora, and excreted to feces, the others were reabsorbed in vivo and then underwent enterohepatic circulation. Therefore, the metabolites with higher relative content in bile were also selected for a followup mechanism analysis.\nThe network analysis combined with the docking analysis revealed that 6\u2033-O-xylosyltectoridin (P6) and three metabolites genistein-7-glucuronide-4\u2032-sulfate (M11), tectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate (M17), and 6\u2033-O-xylosyltectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate (M16) may be the effective forms in the treatment of PF on ALD. The latter three belong to conjugatedmetabolites. Over the past two decades, several studies showed that glucuronides, sulfates, or bis-conjugates were the major existent form of flavonoids in systemic circulation and closely associated with their pharmacological actions. Our previous study found that tectorigenin-7S (M55) and tectorigenin-7G (M36) exhibited stronger inhibitory activity against aldose reductase than tectorigenin (P15) (Qu et al., 2014). In addition, several flavonoids conjugates, such as daidzein-7-glucuronide-4\u2032-sulfate; daidzein4\u2032,7-disulfate; apigenin-7-O-glucuronide; quercetin-3O-glucuronide; quercetin-4\u2032-O-glucuronide; quercetin-3\u2032O-sulfate; and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide, have also been proved to possess some pharmacological activities, including antiinflammatory (Min et al., 2009), anti-oxidative (Moon et al., 2001), antitumor (Chuang et al., 2016), and triglyceride-lowering effects (Eseberri et al., 2019). Therefore, these Phase II metabolites may be responsible for the pharmacological and medicinal properties of flavonoids in vivo, and the conjugation site should be considered as their benefit for structural modification.\nWhen compare the difference in connecting targets, 6\u2033-Oxylosyltectoridin (P6), 6\u2033-O-xylosyltectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate (M16), and tectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate (M17) were strongly associated with fatty acid metabolism, adipocytokine signaling pathway, arginine and proline metabolism, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis via targeting ALDH2 and TNF. 6\u2033-O-xylosyltectoridin (P6) was also involved in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis via regulating the candidate targets HSP90A1 and TPI1. Remarkably, GOT2 and CHKB, involved in the regulation of lipid and amino acid metabolism, were only found to be related with the metabolites genistein-7G-4\u2032S (M11), 6\u2033-Oxylosyltectoridin-4\u2032-sulfate (M16), and tectoridin-4\u2032S (M17). These results showed that the protective role of PF depended on the interacting and synergetic of both prototypes and\nmetabolites. The prototypes are more likely to act on glycolysis/gluconeogenesis as well as inflammation and immune regulation, while the metabolites are highly involved in regulation of lipid and amino acid metabolism.\nALD is characterized by oxidative stress, inflammation, and disturbance of hepatocyte metabolism as well as bacterial translocation (Louvet and Mathurin, 2015). In the present study, the KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the targets were regulated by 16 genes correlated with multiple biological processes inclusive of nine pathways, which were interacting and synergetic. Combined with docking results, the regulation of lipid and amino acid metabolism should highly involve in the protective effect of PF against ALD (Figure 6).\nGrowing evidence has demonstrated that the development of ALD is associated with disturbance of lipid regulation. Fatty acid metabolism (hsa00071), adipocytokine signaling pathway (hsa04920), and PPAR signaling pathway (hsa03320), selected on the basis of the enrichment by five genes ACOX1, CHKB, ALDH2, PPARA, and TNF, participate in the lipid regulation process of PF. Peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1), a key nuclear transcription factor abundantly expressed in the liver, plays a major role in lipid metabolism regulation. Several studies reported that PPAR-\u03b1 agonists were expected to be a treatment for ALD by reducing oxidative stress, regulating fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, inhibiting the production and release of inflammatory and profibrogenic factors, and alleviating liver tissue damage (Kersten, 2014). As the target genes of PPAR-\u03b1, the expression of peroxisomal acylcoenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and choline/ethanolamine kinase (CHKB) through fatty acid oxidation will be reduced, and the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and the content of TNF-\u03b1 in serum was accordingly increased in the development and progression of ALD. Concordantly, increased TNF affects the expression of CHKB through the NF-kB pathway and induces inflammation, which aggravates the course of disease.\nAbnormal amino acid metabolism, including tyrosine metabolism (hsa00350), phenylalanine metabolism (hsa00360), and arginine and proline metabolism (hsa00330), is closely related to intestinal flora metabolism, and bacterial translocation from the gut microbiota into the portal blood stream is an important driver of ALD (Vassallo et al., 2015). MAO-A, a mitochondrial enzyme, exists mainly in the human liver, kidney, small intestine, and nerve tissues and could remove the metabolites of tyrosine and phenylalanine by oxidative deamination. It had been closely associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders due to its degradation of catecholamine neurotransmitter. Recent studies provide insights into the application of MAO-A as a novel predictor of clinical outcomes that MAO-A expression was negatively correlated with the alcohol consumption level and hepatocellular carcinoma (Cervera-Juanes et al., 2016). Increasing MAO-A expression or enzyme activity may be a new approach that can be used for ALD treatment. In addition, researchers\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org15\nfounded that ALDH2, aldehyde dehydrogenase located in mitochondria, was the downstream gene of MAO-A. A link between capacity to reduce alcohol consumption and increased liver ratio of MAO to ALDH2 has been established by using an animal model (Cervera-Juanes et al., 2016). Other targets, such as GOT2, TYR, and MIF, are also involved in the gut bacterial pathway for dopamine and tyrosine metabolism, which affect the intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation.\nAn increasing number of studies have shown that inflammation and immune regulation was also critical for the progression of ALD. Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), an emerging therapeutic target in ALD, was a main effector in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (hsa04621). It is involved in initiation of the early phases of ER stress contributing to stimulation and accumulation of hepatic lipids (Ambade et al., 2014). Hsp90 inhibitors could alleviate serum ALT, endotoxin, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 in acute and chronic alcoholic liver injury and regulating PPAR-\u03b1 to influence fatty acid oxidation and synthesis. In addition, ALOX12, ALOX15, and PTGS1, which catalyze the generation of leukotrienes and prostaglandins by arachidonic acid metabolism (hsa00590), also participate in the processes of ALD through activation of inflammatory responses (Zhang et al., 2017). Their chemical inhibitors have been confirmed to significantly alleviate alcoholinduced oxidative stress, lipid accumulation, and liver damage. In addition, LDHB, TPI1, and ALDH2, which act as master regulatory genes of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (hsa00010) due to the increased cells\u2019 need for oxygen by chronic alcohol consumption, also play a vital role in the treatment of PF in ALD.\nIn this study, the bioinformatic method was combined to elucidate the active components and mechanism of PF in the treatment of ALD. Some of the predicted results are confirmed by in vivo experiments, which preliminarily prove the scientific nature of this method. In addition, some of the compound\u2013target\u2013pathway interactions predicted by the network analysis have also been confirmed in the previous studies. For example, protective effects of genistein against chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in mice were related to regulate expression of inflammatory-related factors TNF\u03b1, NF\u03baB, and PTGS1 (Zhao et al., 2016). Tectoridin, a characteristic isoflavone glycoside found in PF and Belamcanda chinensis (L.) DC., could protect against ethanol-induced liver steatosis mainly by modulating the disturbance of the PPAR-\u03b1 pathway and ameliorating the mitochondrial function (Xiong et al., 2010). In addition, attenuated alcoholism by daidzin has been proved to be associated with the liver mitochondrial MAO\u2013ALDH2 pathway (Ambade et al., 2014). However, other constituents and targets especially conjugated metabolites predicted in the present study still need to be validated in the follow-up study.\nThere are still two shortcomings in this study. On the one hand, benchwork assessing affinity using several technologies such as the surface plasmon resonance biosensor should be combined with a docking analysis to evaluate and validate the importance of relative compounds and targets. As our research focus on the in vivo metabolites, the phase II metabolites including glucuronides, sulfates, and/or bis-conjugates that account for the most part were difficult to isolate due to their exclusivity distribution in the biological matrix rather than the plant kingdom. Therefore, the absence of metabolite references\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org16\nrestricted further affinity evaluation. On the other side, the single dose in the present study was chosen to continue and compare with our previous metabolism research, which determined the pharmacokinetic parameters of tectoridin and tectorigenin after oral administration at dosages of 200 and 130 mg/kg, respectively (Qu et al., 2012; Wang S. et al., 2013). However, three dosages (low, middle, and high) should be set to reflect the dose\u2013effect relationship more scientifically in the pharmacological research. These deficiencies will be improved in our subsequent studies."

Glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, hydroxylation, and reduction are the major metabolic reactions. Furthermore, the constructed absorbed constituent\u2013target\u2013pathway\u2013disease network and the docking analysis revealed that phase II metabolites may play more important roles in the PFmediated protection against ALD. Also, the protective effects and predicted mechanism associated with decreased and elevated expression of MAO-A and PPAR-\u03b1 in rat ALD models were also validated (Figure 7). However, the absence of metabolite references restricted the reliability of predicted conclusions about importance of key metabolites. In the future, we will try to purify the glucuronides, sulfates, and/or bis-conjugated metabolites and employed the benchwork assay to obtain the affinity and Michaelis constant of active compounds bound to key targets, which make the research more credible."
