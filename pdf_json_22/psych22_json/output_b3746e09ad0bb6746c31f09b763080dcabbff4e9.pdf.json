Additionally, developed theoretical constructs to understand the cyberbullying process from social sciences seems not to be used in the creation of these games. This study proposes a set of theoretical constructs, built upon social interaction theory, as a theoretical perspective for understanding the social aspects of cyberbullying, to ground and introduce design lenses, that can be used as design principles, for informing the creation of counter cyberbullying games.",

In relation to cyberbullying, research has reported psychosomatic health problems such as depression, anxiety [7], loneliness, but also headache, stomach ache, and sleeping problems and even suicidal ideation [18]. Countering cyberbullying games have been developed as promising means to prevent cyberbullying or mitigate its consequences. Given that playing video games is a popular leisure activity among adolescents [23], serious games are considered effective for this target audience. Games are called \u2019serious\u2019 games when they are\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Efforts on targeting cyberbullying call for an approach on multiple dimensions [2] and a variety of countering cyberbullying games have been developed and reported in the literature with different purposes: some focus on teaching knowledge or creating empathy for the victim while others aim to stimulate the development of emotional skills [4]. However, the majority of the developed games have not reported their effectiveness results [4]. Furthermore, while most research on cyberbullying comes from psychological and educational perspectives [11], some field researchers relate bullying to the social interaction process [2, 6, 20], moving to the area of social sciences where bullying is considered a \u2019particular type of social interaction\u2019 [9] (p. 473). However, from a social science perspective, i.e., using social interaction theories, it seems there is a knowledge gap concerning the development of serious games for countering cyberbullying. This leaves the development of serious games on cyberbullying with a potential to be more theory driven with respect to the multifaceted nature of cyberbullying.\nDesign lenses [21] have outlined a promising approach to developing serious games in various context. This study is a part of a broader research aiming at introducing and utilizing the concept of design lenses in counter cyberbullying serious games. As the first phase of this broader study, in this paper, we search for the related theoretical constructs on cyberbullying from social science perspective, to ground and inform the development of a set of design lenses for designing counter cyberbullying games. Thus, the current study is directed by the following research question:Which concepts from the social interaction theories are suitable to develop counter cyberbullying games?"

Design lenses have been practised in other areas as well, e.g. interaction design [22] and gameful design [5], demonstrating their versatile use. In our study, the intended function of design lenses is to present existing theory on cyberbullying from social sciences to the game designers in order to review existing games and to provide insights on the cyberbullying process that guides the creation of serious games for detecting or preventing cyberbullying, see Figure 1."

Thus, to understand the meanings children assign to bullying, understanding the interaction patterns of children on bullying is needed. The authors interpreted the data of children\u2019s bullying experiences from a semi-structured interview among Swedish schoolchildren (fourth to seventh grade) and found that the perspectives and experiences of the children was heavily influenced by a striving to belong, which the researchers conceptualized as the \u2019social ordering of belonging\u2019 divided into three sub-categories: social hierarchical ordering (TC1), peer ordering (TC2), and new member ordering (TC3).\nIn another study, Jang and Kim [14] started with the premise that posting benevolent online comments by people can be used to counter cyberbullying. In order to understand the motivation behind the posting of benevolent comments, the field researchers interviewed 57 Korean students and professionals and used the results to develop a theoretical framework that combined social exchange theory and social choice theory. Jang and Kim defined perceived net value as the psychological cost analysis that people use when they decide whether or not to post a benevolent comment. It was shown that perceived net value, online social contribution, and pleasurewere the main motivators behind the posting of benevolent comments. However, online social anxiety was found to have a negative influence on perceived net value (TC4).\nAn overview of the derived theoretical constructs for design lenses for counter cyberbullying games, built upon social interaction theory, is summarized as follows:\n\u2022 TC1 Social hierarchical ordering: a social hierarchical order based on normative dichotomies such as cool vs. uncool, beautiful vs. ugly or normal vs. deviant that constitute a normative moral order among the school children; \u2022 TC2 Peer ordering: sub groups of school children based on friendships, shared sports, or games that leads to inclusion or exclusion in a social group; \u2022 TC3 New member ordering: a newcomer who disrupts the established social order by acting and or looking differently and saying the wrong things to the wrong persons; \u2022 TC4 Posting benevolent comments: people determine if a benevolent online comment (perceived net value) is worth posting by calculating if the benefits (online social contribution) and (pleasure) out weights the costs (online social anxiety)."

Each of these provide a good level of detail to understand cyberbullying from a specific viewpoint and as a result can be translated to a design lens. The next step on our road map is to construct design lenses out of the theoretical constructs and validate them with experts as well as with undergraduate students. Future research should target a broader set of social perspectives such as phenomenology and ethnomethodology [9] as well as other scientific domains that yield valuable theory on cyberbullying, such as psychology, in addition to using a larger set of scientific databases."
