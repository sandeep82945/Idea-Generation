 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop a statistical test to empirically distinguish whether a dataset of conditional distributions was generated by a population of rationally inattentive consumers versus some alternative model of consumer behavior.

2. Extend the model to allow for more flexible substitution patterns between alternatives by using different information cost functions beyond Shannon entropy. This could improve the empirical applicability of the model.

3. Incorporate dynamics into the model to study how rationally inattentive behavior evolves over time as consumers repeatedly make choices. This could shed light on learning and habit formation.

4. Apply the model empirically to study demand in different markets, such as grocery shopping, financial assets, healthcare plans, etc. This would demonstrate the usefulness of the model for real-world data.

5. Generalize the model beyond rational inattention to other models of costly information acquisition like rational ignorance or motivated cognition. This could uncover new insights into how consumers balance information costs versus decision accuracy.
