    "abstractText": "Bioactive compounds are major reasons for the value of Eleutherococcus senticosus, which can be modified by different lighting spectra. Light-emitting diode (LED) provides lights with specific spectra which can interact with other treatments to impact plant bioactive production. Chitosan nanoparticle (CN) is a biopolymer derived from marine creatures. It\u2019s usage may be a practical approach to cope with uncertainties in secondary metabolites induced by illumination. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cyclings link plant eco-physiological performance and bioactive substance; hence their associations may reveal the mechanism of joint lightCN interaction. In this study, E. senticosus seedlings were raised under artificial lighting spectra from high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps (44% red, 55% green, 1% blue) and white (44% red, 47% green, 8% blue) and red colored (73% red, 13% green, 14% blue) LED panels. Half of the seedlings received CN and the other half received distilled water as the control. Compared to the HPS spectrum, the red-light induced stronger shoot growth with greater biomass accumulation and higher water uptake but resulted in lower N concentration and biomass ratio in the root. The white light caused more biomass allocated to the root and strengthened stem C concentration. Stem eleutheroside B increased with shoot growth, while root eleutheroside B had a positive association with leaf C and stem protocatechuic acid had a negative association with leaf N. Having the CN treatment in white and red LED lights is recommended for increasing accumulation of bioactive compounds in the shoots and roots of E. senticosus seedlings, respectively.",

Light-emitting diode (LED) provides lights with\nspecific spectra which can interact with other treatments to impact plant bioactive produc-\ntion. Chitosan nanoparticle (CN) is a biopolymer derived from marine creatures. It\u2019s usage\nmay be a practical approach to cope with uncertainties in secondary metabolites induced by\nillumination. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cyclings link plant eco-physiological performance\nand bioactive substance; hence their associations may reveal the mechanism of joint light-\nCN interaction. In this study, E. senticosus seedlings were raised under artificial lighting\nspectra from high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps (44% red, 55% green, 1% blue) and white\n(44% red, 47% green, 8% blue) and red colored (73% red, 13% green, 14% blue) LED pan-\nels. Half of the seedlings received CN and the other half received distilled water as the con-\ntrol. Compared to the HPS spectrum, the red-light induced stronger shoot growth with\ngreater biomass accumulation and higher water uptake but resulted in lower N concentra-\ntion and biomass ratio in the root. The white light caused more biomass allocated to the root\nand strengthened stem C concentration. Stem eleutheroside B increased with shoot growth,\nwhile root eleutheroside B had a positive association with leaf C and stem protocatechuic\nacid had a negative association with leaf N. Having the CN treatment in white and red LED\nlights is recommended for increasing accumulation of bioactive compounds in the shoots\nand roots of E. senticosus seedlings, respectively."

The Eleutherococcus genus encompasses 35 species in the natural habitats of China, Japan, Korea, and in the mild-climate zones of North America [11]. Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Harms is an unique species from Eleutherococcus genus that is being authenticated by American Herbal Pharmacopoeia and European Pharmacopoeia (10.0 edition) [11, 12]. The root bark of E. senticosus was found to be a restorative tonic in Japan [13]. The thorny stem and branches were also found to be the source of extracts used for treating disease, tuberculosis, and bruises [14\u201316]. Natural E. senticosus habitats may have been impacted by climate, which induced bioactive extracts along a heterogenous spatial distribution pattern [9]. Therefore, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in E. senticosus may differ by regional climate change. The plant factory is an alternative and stable environment to cultivate E. senticosus [17\u201320]. Technological details in plant factory have to be determined according to E. senticosus\u2019 ecophysiological responses to controlled environment factors that benefit dry mass production and lower antioxidant activities.\nPlants from the Araliaceae family are mostly shade tolerant in the understory layer with\nlimited sunlight transmittance [6\u20138, 21, 22]. Low light is an inevitable factor in the habitat environment, which benefits accumulation of medicinal bioactive extracts, but restricts growth [6, 8, 23, 24]. In temperate forests, a low light intensity refers to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) between 75\u2013100 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1. [5, 6]. Therefore, low light irradiation is a fundamental aspect of an undergrowth and light quality in varied spectra plays a critical role. Therefore, the spectrum of low-intensity light is an important determinant of medicinal bioactive compounds in shade-tolerant plants. For example, both total flavonoid and saponin concentrations were found to be higher in Alpinia oxyphylla plants subjected to a red-light spectrum (30% red, 10%, green, 20% blue) [25]. Allium victorialis plants had higher concentrations of total flavonoids and saponins when subjected to a green-light spectrum (28% red, 71% green, and 1% blue) [26]. Saponin concentration were lower in the shoots of Aralia elata plants subjected to the green-light spectrum (26.6% red, 59.9% green, 13.5% blue) [8]. Regarding the highly varied responses of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants to different spectra, an additive may be needed to attain the desired amount of bioactive compounds.\nChitosan is a biological additive used in agricultural and horticultural plant factory systems.\nChitosan is the product of alkaline deacetylation of chitin, which is derived from marine organisms such as insect cuticles, fungal cell walls, and crustacean shells [27]. Chitosan is the second most abundant polysaccharide next to cellulose [28]. Additives with chitosan oligosaccharide were reported to benefit plant growth and promote resistance against droughts [29], nitrogen remobilization [30], and increase nutrient uptake and utilization [31]. Chitosan based nanoparticles (CN) release bioactive molecules at a controlled speed, which was found to benefit plant growth and mitigate stress [28, 32]. The CN addition has been identified to promote protective secondary metabolites in response to biotic and abiotic stressors [33]. Therefore, CN can be used as an additive to potentially enhance secondary metabolite accumulation in cultivars in the plant factory environment. To our knowledge, one study tested the effect of chitosan addition on Araliaceae plants, i.e. Aralia continentalis Kitagawa [34]. Therein, root extracts intereacted with chitosan to increase antioxidant capacity. Hence, adding CN may promote the bioactive synthesis of secondary metabolites that have medicinal uses. More evidence is needed to verify the bioassay response of Araliaceae plants to CN addition. There is still uncertainty in the interaction of CN addition with light spectrum regarding contrasting outcomes with a joint [8] or a null effect [10].\nEleutherococcus senticosus (Eleuthero) (colloquially, ciwujia, Siberian ginseng, Devil\u2019s shrub) is a small woody shrub in the Araliaceae family native to Northeast Asia. It has been used as a traditional herb medicine in China for over 2000 years and recently accounted for over 3% of the market share of the medicinal herb industry in North America [35]. E. senticosus contains\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277233 December 1, 2022 2 / 19\nHeilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program (grant number: [2019] No. 5) (received by S.G.), http://jyt.hlj.gov.cn/ Heilongjiang Province Postdoctoral Scientific Research Foundation (grant number: LBH-Q21044) (received by S.G.), http:// jyt.hlj.gov.cn/.

For example, they were reported to contain abundant amounts of bioactive metabolites such as phenylalanine (PHE) [36], protocatechuic acid [37], eleutherosides, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid [38], isofraxidin [39], etc. These compounds can treat many illnesses due to their antioxidant abilities [40]; therefore, the accumulation of these bioactive compounds is one of the major goals when culturing E. senticosus. Although C and N metabolisms account for an important proportion of synthesis and accumulation of bioactive compounds in E. senticosus, little is known about the identifications of bioactive compounds and their association. In natural habitats, bioactive compounds in E. senticosus were found to show a significant plasticity that is shaped by understory environmental factors [9]. Specifically, some LED light spectra can modify the root growth of E. senticosus seedlings and the addition of chitosan can strengthen this effect [10]. The response of bioactive compounds to the interaction between some LED light spectra and chitosan is not clear. There still needs to be more research on the relationship between C and N metabolisms.\nIn this study, E. senticosus seedlings were cultured in a plant factory and tested for bioactive content and antioxidant activity. All seedlings were cultured using artificial illumination from sodium (HPS) and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps. HPS lamps have long been used to supplement illumination for woody plants to promote growth or enhance their quality [8, 19, 41, 42]. Alternatively, LED panels and lamps are being adapted by a growing number of plant managers for their lower energy consumption and higher efficacy in quality elevation [18, 25, 26, 43, 44]. Light spectra and CN addition were imposed onto seedlings as a combined treatment. The objective was to detect the combined effects of spectra and CN-additive on bioactive compounds and their associations with C and N concentrations in E. senticosus. According to current findings, we hypothesized that: (1) bioactive compound contents were higher in the spectrum with high red-light and low green-light, (2) CN addition can increase bioactive compounds in E. senticosus, and (3) bioactive compounds had negative associations with C and N. Our results will contribute to E. senticosus development and provide new evidence for medicinal plant quality evaluation in plant factories."

The red-light LED spectrum emitted a spectrum with a higher proportion of red light but a lower proportion of green light. LED panels were placed 80cm above the bench surface. Two tanks of potted seedlings were placed together under a LED panel. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was measured to be 93.6\u201394.8 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 (depending on the type of LED spectra) ~35 cm beneath the diodes. Two HPS lamps were hanged over the other pair of tanks with one lamp per tank. HPS lamps were placed at a height such that potted seedlings were subjected to a similar PPFD to those exposed to LED spectra. Lights were turned on from 05:00 am to 21:00 pm.\nChitosan nanoparticle addition synthesis and application\nIonotropic gelation was used to synthesize CN primary products [46, 47]. Briefly, CO was dissolved in distilled water into an aqueous solution (2.6 mg mL-1) with acetic acid (0.175 M) (AS1). Sodium tripolyphosphate solution (0.6 mg mL-1) was added dropwise to the suspension of AS1 in a volumetric proportion of 1:3. The mixture was stirred for 45 min at 25\u02daC, cooled to room temperature as a CN reagent, and sealed in ice until being delivered to the seedlings.\nHalf of the potted seedlings were treated with the CN addition and the other half only\nreceived distilled water at the same volume. A volume of 10 mL CN was delivered to the surface of the growing media through a 5-mL pipettor. Delivery avoided contact with plants to prevent contamination from entering through stem cells [48, 49]. All seedlings were watered through a sub-irrigation system where leaching was mostly avoided from substrates [41]. All seedlings received nutrient supply with a formulation of Song et al. [50], which consisted of 10% N, 4% P2O5, and 7% K2O at a total rate of 60 mg N plant -1. A tank of eight seedlings was the basic unit for a combined treatment (spectra \u00d7 CN) and every treatment was replicated three times. Seedlings were cultured for four months and sampled."

The addition of CN increased dry mass weight in the root for all spectra treatments. Root to shoot mass ratio (R/S) was lower in seedlings subjected to the red-light LED spectrum compared to those subjected to the HPS, and both were lower compared to those subjected to the white-light spectrum (Fig 4D).

The white-light LED spectrum caused lower fresh and dry weight and water content in the shoots compared to the red-light LED spectrum; the white-light LED spectrum did not promote as efficient water uptake which limited fresh weight. Overall, both types of LED spectra promoted increased mass relative to the HPS spectrum but in different ways. The redlight spectrum was effective in promoting water uptake but not in dry mass allocation to the roots, while the white-light spectrum was the opposite. The response of seedlings to these effects were not impacted by the CN treatment."

A lower C concentration in the stems of E. senticosus seedlings exposed to the red-light spectrum was due to the cost of water uptake [54]. The addition of chitosan oligosaccharide (CO) was reported to enhance starch allocation to promote root resistance [29]. This and the red-light spectrum interacted to increase root C concentration. The white-light spectrum probably lowered root C concentration through the consumption of carbohydrate for synthesizing bioactive compounds. Lower root C concentration in LED light with less red-light wavelength was also reported in Allium victorialis [26], which, along with our findings, suggests that one effect of seedlings being exposed to white LED light is increased C usage.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277233.g009\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277233 December 1, 2022 13 / 19\nIn E. senticosus seedlings, the LED-light spectrum led to the decline of N concentration in shoot organs, especially when interacting with CN addition. This was because increased mass production and allocation consumes more N compounds but there was no additional N inputs [51, 55, 56]. In another Araliaceae-family plant, Aralia elata, LED spectrum also resulted in the decline of N concentration and the decline in shoots was higher than that in roots [4]. This was identified as N dilution induced by stimulated growth [20, 42, 44]. Stem N concentration was lower in the red-light spectrum than in the white-light spectrum, which was the result of greater mass allocation and its consequence of N dilution. The CN addition had a similar effect which reduced N concentration by stimulating mass production and promoting dilution. This effect of CN addition concurred with the effect of CO addition to P. macrophyllus [30] and Eustoma grandiflorum [57]. The interactive effects of CN addition and LED spectra resulted in even lower N concentration in the stem."

            "text": "Our results on bioactive compound contents did not clearly support the first hypothesis. The red-light LED spectrum mostly lowered bioactive compound contents compared to the HPS spectrum except for eleutheroside B content in the stem and root and chlorogenic acid content and isofraxidin content in the root.\nThe white-light spectrum induced a higher level of eleutheroside B content in the stem,\nwhich agrees with findings in E. senticosus somatic embryos by Shohael et al. [58]. Although our eleutheroside E content was lower in the red-light spectrum, the inverse was reported in E. senticosus somatic embryos [58]. In our PC analysis, eigenvalues between eleutheroside-B and -E contents were plotted at generally contrasting positions which suggests discrete distributions of secondary metabolites for these two compounds. Contrasting responses of eleutheroside B and eleutheroside E to light spectra were reasonable. Eleutheroside is a lignan compound which is further divided into syringin (eleutheroside B) and (-) syringaresinol-di-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside (eleutheroside E), both of which were frequently found in Acanthopanax species [59].\nSeveral pieces of evidence demonstrate that low-red-light spectrum can promote chloro-\ngenic acid synthesis in lettuce [60], jasmonide [61], and strawberry [62]. In our study, chlorogenic acid content in stems was lower in red-light which concurs with previous findings. However, the response of chlorogenic acid content in roots to red-light was contrary. \u2018Chlorogenic acid is a caffeoylquinic acid derivative known to have antioxidant activity [63].\u2019 The upregulation of chlorogenic acid in roots is a defense mechanism to cope with underground stress when dry mass allocation is insufficient [63, 64]. Therefore, the upregulation of chlorogenic acid synthesis in roots may be a response to lower mass allocation to roots in red-light.\nIn our study, the red-light spectrum increased root isofraxidin content relative to the HPS\nspectrum, but the white light spectrum increased even more. The white light spectrum was also found to promote isofraxidin content in the roots of Sarcandra glabra seedlings [65]. Isofraxidin belongs to coumarin, which was also shown to be upregulated in low-red lights [66, 67]. Isofraxidin in plant root is synthesized as a bioactive response to abiotic stress. It was found that in natural E. senticosus populations, isofraxidin was strongly synthesized in roots when rainfall was limited and droughts impacted the rhizosphere [9]. Root isofraxidin synthesis was closely associated with growth and shoot and root masses, which were highly responsive to combined light and CN factors. Again, in the red-light spectrum, less dry mass was allocated to roots which likely induced the upregulation of isofraxidin.\nThe CN addition interacted with LED spectra and had contrasting effects on the contents\nof L-PHE, chlorogenic acid, eleutheroside B, and eleutheroside E. Most of these bioactive compounds were also secondary metabolites that were upregulated by the lack of dry mass\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277233 December 1, 2022 14 / 19\nallocation to roots. In the stem, the addition of CN impacted all bioactive compounds in a combination of red light exposure by switching higher levels of bioactive compound content to lower levels. According to results from Ficus hirta and Alpinia xyphylla [25], stem N concentration had a negative association with secondary metabolites. Leaf N concentration in seedlings under red-light was at a lower level without CN addition but at a higher level with CN addition. CO addition has been shown to promote N uptake, which was corroborated in our study by the interaction of CN addition with red light. Hence, the increase in N concentration may account for the decrease in bioactive compound contents in the stem. In addition, CN addition can promote resistance to stress [29]. The downregulation of bioactive compounds was also the result of enhanced resistance."

The effect of CN addition on eleutheroside B content and C-N cyclings can be used to maximize the production of this bioactive compound for medical uses. Our study reveals that the cultivation of E. senticosus seedlings can be independent from field nursery and all aimed compounds can be produced by adjusting light spectra and CN addition."

We designed the illumination environment using empirical data derived from former studies, but more precise lighting simulation should be adapted from the natural environment [6, 8]. Therefore, our first limit was managing the environment habitat of E. senticosus populations. Second, this study is the first one to detect the response of secondary metabolites in E. senticosus seedlings to CN addition; hence we did not have sufficient background information for designing the doses of CN input. Our results may be limited by the rate of CN additions to seedlings, and a wider range of doses are suggested in the future. Finally, our results were limited to an artificial plant factory condition, which can be referred to by future studies with similar settings. However, a wider spectra may be available to induce higher levels of secondary metabolites."

            "text": "In this study, E. senticosus seedlings were raised under exposure to three types of artificial lightings: HPS, red-light LED, and white-light LED. Half of the seedlings were treated with CN while the other half received distilled water as the control. Lighting spectra and CN addition had an interactive effect on nearly all parameters measuring the seedlings\u2019 growth, mass production, C/N concentrations, and bioactive content. With the HPS spectrum as a reference, the red-light spectrum induced greater stem elongation and shoot dry mass accumulation with accelerated water uptake, but elicited low biomass allocated to roots. The white-light spectrum benefitted more in mass allocation in roots, maintained C concentration in stems, and alleviated N dilution. In stems, the white-light spectrum induced high protocatechuic acid with lower N concentration; in roots, the red-light spectrum resulted in higher eleutheroside B content in accordance with high N concentration. Therefore, CN addition in combination with white or red LED lights is recommended for increasing accumulation of bioactive components in the shoots and roots of E. senticosus seedlings, respectively.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277233 December 1, 2022 15 / 19"
