    "abstractText": "Protective coatings for bronze relics should adhere to the basic principles of cultural relic preservation, such as not altering the color and appearance of the artifacts, and being moderately combined with the artifacts to resist erosion due to external environments (such as water and gas). This paper presents the development of a physically crosslinked supramolecular hydrogel produced from guanidinium-based chitosan (GC). The hydrogel exhibits the excellent adsorption protection of bronze, and the addition of clay enhances the water barrier properties of the chitosan film. The supramolecular interaction between sodium polyacrylate/GC/clay confers corrosion buffering capability to the hydrogel coating in corrosive environments, and the gel coating can be self-healing at room temperature for 24 h. The fabricated nanocomposites were comprehensively characterized using various methods (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, etc.). The electrochemical properties of coated specimens were evaluated, and the impedance spectrum revealed a large impedance arc indicating high charge resistance, which has a corrosion resistance effect.",

Introduction\nBronze artifacts are an important heritage of ancient Chinese civilization. Bronze artifacts that have been excavated and stored are subject to corrosion because of their burial environment and inherent characteristics. This corrosion can cause the loss of surface inscriptions and ornaments as well as ulceration and perforation, leading to irreversible damage. The prevention of continued rusting and deterioration of bronzes in collected artifacts has been an urgent worldwide problem in the field of cultural conservation [1,2]. The application of a protective layer on bronze can effectively protect it by inhibiting and slowing down further corrosion aggravation caused by environmental changes. In light of the basic principle of cultural relic protection and restoration, transparent and flexible gel protective coatings have received widespread attention [3,4]. Nevertheless, the barrier performance of coatings tends to be weakened over time due to complex environmental conditions or corrosion attacks, resulting in subsequent damage. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure that the self-healing capability remains effective to prevent any additional corrosion damage until the necessary repairs can be carried out. Thus, it is imperative to develop novel coatings with the dual abilities of anti-corrosion and self-healing. Chitosan is a linear bio-polymer derived from chitin which is found in the shells of crustaceans [5]. It has bio-adhesive and antibacterial [6] effects and acts as a chelating agent [7] and antioxidant. Chitosan and its derivatives are widely used as corrosion inhibitors due to the presence of electron-rich sites. Amino (\u2013NH2) and hydroxyl (\u2013OH)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3357. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15163357 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3357 2 of 19\ngroups serve as adsorption sites and can protect against corrosion attacks [8,9], enabling chitosan to bind to metal surfaces [10]. However, chitosan is highly soluble in acidic aqueous media and insoluble in alkaline solutions [11]. To improve the water solubility of chitosan, researchers studied guanidinylated chitosan [12]. They found that the guanidine group enhanced the antimicrobial activity of chitosan under neutral conditions. The chemically modified guanidinium-based chitosan (GC) exhibited superior abilities in metal binding and anticorrosion compared with unmodified chitosan [10]. Additionally, chitosan has excellent film-forming properties [13]. Although the chitosan coatings have good air tightness, their ability to block water is weak [14]. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of single-component chitosan coatings are poor. By incorporating nanoclay, the coating maintains its original level of airtightness while improving its resistance to moisture. Additionally, the inclusion of nanoclay allows the coating to self-heal to some extent. Nasim et al. [15] developed nanohybrid interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-alginate containing lithium saponite (LN). It has been shown that the addition of LN nanosheets to IPN hydrogels of PVA-alginate leads to nanohybrid hydrogels with appropriate mechanical, physical, and biological properties. The study of polymer/clay nanocomposites was first reported in 1961. At that time, Blumstein [16] demonstrated the polymerization reaction of vinyl monomers embedded in montmorillonite (MMT). LN is a synthetic smectite clay mineral of the trioctahedral 2:1-type layered silicates [17]. Compared with other silicate layers, LN exhibits superior swelling performance, a larger specific surface area, and greater cation exchange capacity. Organic cations can replace Na+ and K+ in LN. Additionally, because of the ion exchange mechanism, an intercalation structure can be realized. Although LN can adsorb bacteria, it does not have an antibacterial effect. Therefore, an organic material is usually inserted into the lithium soapstone flake. The introduction of guanidinium groups enhances the surface charge of chitosan [18], enabling better formation of crosslinked networks with LN and facilitating bonding with the bronze surface. Numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of chitosan and its derivatives combined with diverse organic and inorganic substances as corrosion inhibitors for safeguarding bronze. In this paper, nanoclay particles were first mixed in an aqueous solution, and swelling occurred when they were dispersed in water, gradually cleaving into discrete disc-shaped particles. The resulting aqueous phase clay suspension consisting of exfoliated clay particles was homogeneous and transparent, because the clay particles have a negatively charged surface and a positively charged edge [19]. When the dispersant sodium polyacrylate (PAANa) was added to the suspension, it adsorbed onto the positively charged edges of the clay particles to produce electrostatic interactions and disperse the nanoclay. In addition, the subsequent addition of GC created electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions with the LN surface to form a crosslinked network [20\u201322]. The surface mechanism for bronze is shown in Scheme 1. The experimental results show that the supramolecular gel (LN/PAANa/GC) with guanidine chitosan had better corrosion resistance than the gel coating (LN/PAANa) without guanidine chitosan. In addition, the gel coating has a corrosion barrier zone and good self-healing ability.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3357 3 of 19\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 21 groups serve as adsorption sites and can protect against corrosion attacks [8,9], enabling chitosan to bind to metal surfaces [10].

The scratched gel coating was kept at ambient temperature for 24 h, and then its self-healing ability was observed.\n2.6. Artificial Aging\nTo evaluate the long-term protective effect of the gel coating, we conducted artificial aging of the coated copper sheets. HCl vapor was prepared by heating 1.0 M HCl in water in a closed glass vessel at 50 \u25e6C and 100% relative humidity (RH) (constant temperature and humidity test chamber). Then, the bronze sheet was subjected to an accelerated corrosion test for 60 h. Electrochemical analysis was performed on the bronze sheet before and after corrosion. The changes in the protective effects of the gel coatings were detected using electrochemical analysis.\n2.7. Characterization\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry was performed using a Nicolet IS10. A comparison of the IR spectra of glycol chitosan and GC was obtained between 4000\u20135000 cm\u22121 using the potassium bromide pellet method. Patina bronze flakes coated with the gels without guanidine chitosan or the composite gels were measured in total reflection mode. Thermogravimetry/derivative thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) was heated from room temperature to 600 \u25e6C using a NETZSCH STA 449 F3/F5 under nitrogen flow at a ramp rate of 10 \u25e6C/min. Gel coatings were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany). The tube current was 40 mA and the Cu target was used to radiate the sample. Synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were performed on a Xeuss 2.0 of Sanop (France) with an X-ray wavelength of 1.54189 \u00c5. The two-dimensional (2D) SAXS data was converted to one-dimensional (1D) intensity (I(q)) as a function of the scattering vector q [q = 4\u03c0sin\u03b8/\u03bb] by circular averaging, where 2q is the scattering angle. SAXS was used for the analysis of the blank gels (chitosan-free gel). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to evaluate the binding of the gel to the patina bronze sheet. The binding energy reference C1s peak was 284.80 eV. A spectrophotometer (CS-5960GX) was used to analyze the patina bronze flakes coated with hydrogel and the uncoated patina bronze flakes. A field emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) was used to observe the surface morphologies of the gel coating and bronze binding sites, as well as the gel coating on the bronze surface. The working voltage was 3 kV, and the working mode was the secondary electron mode [23]. A traditional three-electrode system comprising the reference (saturated calomel), working, and auxiliary (platinum) electrodes was used in the experiment to monitor the corrosion potential of the studied electrode (Wuhan Crest Instrument Co., Wuhan, China). The frequency range was 0.1\u2013105 Hz, and the AC amplitude was 30 mV. The measurements are represented as Nyquist plots or Bode plots. To evaluate the long-term protective effect of the gel coatings, the coated and uncoated bronze sheets were heated in closed glass containers at 50 \u25e6C in the presence of HCL vapor (1.0 M HCl in water) and 100% RH. The sheets were then subjected to the 60 h accelerated corrosion tests, and the electrochemical analysis of the bronze sheets was performed before and after corrosion.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3357 5 of 19\n3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Chemical Structure and Thermal Analysis of Gel Coating\nFTIR spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation of the GC and hydrogel networks. Figure 1a shows that the ethylene glycol chitosan sample exhibits characteristic absorption bands [11,24,25] at 3317 cm\u22121 (\u2013OH stretching), 2928 cm\u22121 and 2870 cm\u22121 (C\u2013H stretching), 1359 cm\u22121 (C\u2013N stretching), 1456 cm\u22121 (N\u2013H bending), and 1649 cm\u22121 (C=O stretching), which are related to the residual N\u2212acetyl group. The peaks observed 1655 cm\u22121 and 1359 cm\u22121 are related to GC. The comparison of the spectra of these two samples [26] indicate that strong absorptions occur at 1655 cm\u22121 and 1359 cm\u22121 in the spectrum of the GC, which appeared blue-shifted, indicating the successful introduction of the guanidinium moiety.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 21\nstretching), 1359 cm\u22121 (C\u2013N stretching), 1456 cm\u22121 (N\u2013H bending), and 1649 cm\u22121 (C=O\nstretching), which are related to the residual N\u2212acetyl group.

FTIR spectra of: (a) glycol chitosan and GC, and (b) LN/PAANa gel, LN/PAANa/GC gel, and GC (c) LN/PAANa gel (coated), LN/PAANa/GC (coated), LN/PAANa gel and LN/PAANa/GC gel.\nAs shown in Figure 1b, the characteristic peaks of GC are 1456 cm\u22121 (in-plane bending\nvibration absorption peak of secondary amine N\u2013H) and 1363 cm\u22121 (stretching vibration\nof C\u2013N). This demonstrates that the bands of N\u2013H shifted to 996 cm\u22121 when LN and Pa-\ngana were added to the hydrogels in the composites, possibly resulting from hydrogen\nbonding between CS and LN or PAANa. The characteristic peak of C=O in the LN/PAANa\nhydrogel is observed at 1658 cm\u22121. Figure 1b shows that the GC has no obvious C=O char-\nacteristic peak. The characteristic C=O peak at 1660 cm\u22121 appears after the formation of the\nLN/PAANa/GC hydrogel, and the intensity of the absorption peak considerably decreases,\nindicating intermolecular interactions between LN and GC. For the LN/PAANa hydrogel,\nthe peak observed at 646 cm\u22121 is a characteristic peak of Si\u2013O. The electrostatic interaction\nbetween LN and GC caused a redshift of the characteristic peak in the LN/PAANa/GC\nhydrogel, which appeared at 613 cm\u22121. This indicates that a supramolecular gel network\nwas formed in the hydrogel containing GC.\nAfter LN/PAANa gel and LN/PAANa/GC coating are applied on the bronze plate,\nthe copper on the surface of the bronze can react with the carbon\u2013oxygen double bond in\nthe carbonyl group, forming a metal\u2013carbonyl bond. This type of bonding can provide\nstrong adhesion, allowing the carbonyl functional group to firmly attach to the surface of\nbronze. Therefore, the characteristic peak of the coated gel layer C=O becomes weaker. In\naddition, the LN/PAANa/GC gel coating contains an \u2013OH peak at 3200\u20133500 cm\u22121 and an\nFigure 1.

This demonstrates that the bands of N\u2013H shifted to 996 cm\u22121 when LN and Pagana were added to the hydrogels in the composites, possibly resulting from hydrogen bonding between CS and LN or PAANa. The characteristic peak of C=O in the LN/PAANa hydrogel is observed at 1658 cm\u22121. Figure 1b shows that the GC has no obvious C=O characteristic peak. The characteristic C=O peak at 1660 cm\u22121 appears after the formation of the LN/PAANa/GC hydrogel, and the intensity of the absorption peak considerably decreases, indicating intermolecular interactions between LN and GC. For th LN/PAAN h rog l, the peak observed at 646 cm\u22121 is a characteristic peak of Si\u2013O. The electrostatic interaction between LN and GC caused a red hift of the characteristic peak in the LN/PAANa/GC hydrogel, which ppeared at 613 cm\u22121. This indicates that a supramolecular gel network was formed in t e ydrogel con aining GC. After LN/PAANa gel and LN/PAANa/GC coating are applied on the bronze plate, the copper on the surface of the bronze can re ct with the carbon\u2013oxygen double bond in\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3357 6 of 19\nthe carbonyl group, forming a metal\u2013carbonyl bond. This type of bonding can provide strong adhesion, allowing the carbonyl functional group to firmly attach to the surface of bronze. Therefore, the characteristic peak of the coated gel layer C=O becomes weaker. In addition, the LN/PAANa/GC gel coating contains an \u2013OH peak at 3200\u20133500 cm\u22121 and an N\u2013H peak at 1456 cm\u22121. From Figure 1c, it can be seen that the characteristic peaks of \u2013OH and N\u2013H are weakened after coating. In conclusion, the analysis reveals the adsorption between the coating and bronze. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the hydrogels was performed to evaluate the thermal stability of the samples (Figure 2). As shown in the corresponding TGA curve, the weight of all samples gradually decreased with the increasing temperature. The initial weight loss of the hydrogels at ~100 \u25e6C was due to the loss of water. The LN/PAANa gel showed a weight loss of ~20% at 450 \u25e6C, indicating that the interaction between PAA and clay was electrostatic and that ion exchange did not occur. Moreover, the thermal stability decreased after adding GC because the interaction between GC and the nanoclay included both ion exchange and intermolecular interactions such as electrostatic adsorption. The ion exchange interaction led to an increase in GC in the nanoclay interlayer. Therefore, the LN/PAANa/GC gel showed greater weight loss. Furthermore, because electrostatic interactions are more stable than ion exchange interactions at high temperatures, the decomposition temperature of the LN/PAANa gel was slightly higher than that of the LN/PAANa/GC gel.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 21\nN\u2013H peak at 1456 cm\u22121.

Additionally, the adsorption of GC chain segments to the bronze surface limited chain movement, which was consistent with the TGA results. It was also shown that GC in the LN/PAANa/GC gels tended to adsorb more on the bronze surface when interacting with LN. After the \u201cunbinding\u201d of GC and LN, the interaction between LN and PAANa formed a double layer of protection for the bronze flakes. Furthermore, after aging, the distribution of the diffraction peaks of the gel coating at 42\u25e6 was more consistent. This indicated that the c mposite layer of LN a d PAANa consumed the hydrogen ions in the acid mist through ion exchange of sodium ions with hydrogen ions, hich led to a more uniform thickness distribution of the LN wafers. This was verified in the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the gel coating after corrosion.\n3.3. SAXS\nThe 2D SAXS data of the samples are shown in Figure 4. This study was a fourcomponent system consisting of nanoclay, PAANa, GC, and water, and the entire X-ray scattering intensity can be described by the sum of several partial scattering functions. The X-ray scattering will be dominated by the signal from clay particles because the electron density of clay in an aqueous solution is much larger than that of GC units. \u2206\u03c1, P(q), and Sexp (q) are the scattering length density difference between the clay particles and matrix, the shape factor of the clay particles, and the experimental structure factor, respectively. K is the experimental constant and nclay is the number density of clay particles with volume vclay [21].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3357 8 of

J1 denotes the first-order Bessel function, since the inhomogeneity of the radius of the disk ions and the inhomogeneity of the Gaussian distribution are taken into account (R = 13 nm, 2H = 1.0 nm). All samples showed clear scattering patterns, indicating the presence of multiphase microstructures. The 2D scattering data showed isotropic scattering rings (circles), indicating the isotropic multiphase structure of the gel. With qmax = 0.14 and L = 2\u03c0/q = 45 nm, the nanoclay diameter was ~30 nm, indicating that some nanoclays are in direct contact with each other. The peak height decreased in the absence of GC, probably due to the presence of exfoliated nanoclay structures. After the introduction of GC, the LN binding state changed and the layer spacing increased. From the XRD pattern (Figure 3a), it can be concluded that the layer spacing is widened to 16.6314 \u00c5.\n3.4.

The gel coating is related to the magnitude of the impedance arc; the larger the impedance arc, the better the corrosion resistance [33]. As shown in Figure 11, an impedance value of 102 \u2126 was observed in the low-frequency region, indicating that the bare bronze could be corroded. Conversely, the bronze sheet with the gel coating displayed high impedance values in the low-frequency impedance region, the impedance arc of the coated electrode increased, and the maximum value of the phase angle obtained was considerably higher. In Figure 11, the impedance arc of the LN/PAANa/GC gel-coated electrode was larger than that of the LN/PAANa gelcoated electrode, showing a higher |Z| and a phase angle of nearly 30\u25e6 at high frequencies, indicating that the gel coating had good capacitive properties. The fitting circuit shown in Figure 12b was selected for fitting according to the gel coating. The fitting results showed that the total impedance values of the LN/PAANa/GC gel electrode and the LN/PAANa gel electrode were 6250 \u2126 and 4000 \u2126, respectively. The results showed that the LN/PAANa/GC gel coating had a superior impedance effect; therefore, the impedance effect increased with the addition of guanidine chitosan. From the SEM, it was also clear that the composite gel containing guanidine chitosan was more resistant to corrosion.\n3.9. Artificial Aging\nTo evaluate the long-term protective effect of the gel coating, we conducted artificial aging of the coated copper sheets. HCl vapor was produced by heating 1.0 M HCl in water in a closed glass vessel at 50 \u25e6C and 100% RH. The bronze sheet was subjected to an accelerated corrosion test for 60 h and electrochemical analysis was performed on the bronze sheet before and after corrosion. The changes in the protective effects of the gel coating were detected using electrochemical analysis. As shown in Scheme 2, after corrosion, GC tended to adsorb on the surface of the bronze after unbinding with LN.
