INTRODUCTION\nThe study of quantum error correction has proven quite fruitful in the context of AdS=CFT, from the resolution of the commutator puzzle [1] to the formalization of bulk reconstruction [2\u20135] to ideas on subregion duality [6]. For recent reviews on holography and quantum error correction, see [7,8]. Increasingly, there is also interest in how holographic studies of quantum error correction can influence quantum error correction as applied in quantum computing. There are some known limitations of existing nonholographic quantum error correcting codes such as the surface code, particularly in terms of their robustness against fractal noise [9]. In a previous work [10], we demonstrated the robustness of the holographic code and presumably codes derived thereupon to such types of noise using entanglement wedge-based arguments. In the present work, we seek to expand upon this study by studying robustness properties against fractal noise in the presence of a black hole background in AdS=CFT, or equivalently at states of finite temperature in the boundary CFT.Theworkwill be divided as follows. InSecs. II and IIIwe will give a brief review of state-specific bulk-reconstruction and uberholography, as developed in [11,12], respectively. In Sec. IV, wewill generalize this study to higher dimensions,\nin the context of a black hole background, and demonstrate that the robustness property continues to hold. Finally, wewill give some concluding comments in Sec. V."

            "text": "Recently it has been shown in [11] that there is a macroscopic breakdown of the entanglement wedge when the von Neumann entropy of an object in the bulk cannot be ignored. In particular, this can occur when the bulk state is a highly mixed state. While one way to get past this is to purify those highly mixed states into, e.g., Bell pairs, the existence of this breakdown nevertheless establishes the fact that the entanglement wedge is state-specific in general. An object that was defined in the study of such breakdowns is the reconstruction wedge, defined by [11] as the following: Definition: The reconstruction wedge of a boundary region A is the intersection of all entanglement wedges of A for every state in the code subspace, pure or mixed. It is the region of space-time within which bulk operators are guaranteed to be reconstructible from the boundary in a state-independent manner. Recently, it has also become clear that the entropy of the boundary at higher orders is no longer given by the RT surface area, but a more generalized entropy is associated with the quantum extremal surface, which is also defined in a state-dependent way [13]. More recent works on quantum error correction and quantum extremal surfaces have further established the importance of state-dependent bulk reconstruction [14]. Nonisometric codes [15] seem to suggest some state dependence in the nonisometric encoding in the sense of not modifying simple states but heavily modifying complex states. *ningbao@bnl.gov \u2020naskar.j@northeastern.edu Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

UBERHOLOGRAPHY IN AdS3=CFT2\nThe scheme of uberholography in AdS3=CFT2 was first proposed in [12] and was extended to AdS4=CFT3 in [10]. More literature related to uberholography can be found in [17\u201319]. The idea of uberholography is as follows is: Given a boundary subregion R, one punches a hole H from it leaving disjoint boundary subregions R1, R2 and hole H as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 with their respective entanglement wedges. The hole H is punched such that with 0 < r < 1\njR1j \u00bc jR2j \u00bc r 2 jRj; jHj \u00bc \u00f01 \u2212 r\u00dejRj: \u00f02\u00de\nFor the same boundary subregion R, there are two candidate surfaces that might be the minimal surface, giving rise to two different candidate entanglement wedges.\nBulk reconstruction is possible when the RT surface (in this dimension, a geodesic) corresponding to the candidate entanglement wedge \u03f5\u00bdR0 \u00bc \u03f5\u00bdR n\u03f5\u00bdH (Fig. 2) is smaller than the one corresponding to \u03f5\u00bdR0 \u00bc \u03f5\u00bdR1 \u222a \u03f5\u00bdR2 (Fig. 1) where \u03f5\u00bdA is the entanglement wedge in the bulk corresponding to boundary subregion A and the RT surface of this entanglement wedge is denoted by \u03c7A. The area of this RT surface is simply given by [20,21]\nj\u03c7Aj \u00bc 2L log jAj\na\n; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere L is the AdS radius and jAj denotes the length of A. The division of the boundary subregion R into H, R1 and R2 imposes a constraint on the allowed values of r as it has to satisfy\nj\u03c7R1 j \u00fe j\u03c7R2 j \u2265 j\u03c7Rj \u00fe j\u03c7Hj \u00f04\u00de\nat level 1.1 Solving the critical case saturating this inequality, one arrives at the value\nrC \u00bc 2\u00f0 ffiffiffi 2 p \u2212 1\u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere rC is the critical value of r for the continuous phase to be favored over the discontinuous one. We will drop the subscript C from now on for convenience and just write r. It is interesting to note here that as we increase the number of iterations, the value of this critical r remains unchanged. This property of m-independence breaks down by the inclusion of bulk entropy Sb. 2\nRecalling the definition of distance of the code with operator algebra A in bulk region X to be\nd\u00f0AX\u00de \u2264 jRminj a \u00bc 2m \u00bc jRj a \u03b1 ; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere\n\u03b1 \u00bc log 2 log 2=r \u00bc 1 log2 \u00f0 ffiffiffi 2 p \u00fe 1\u00de \u00bc 0.786 \u00f07\u00de\nand Rmin is the union of boundary subregions remaining after punching fractals holes until level m when the size of the smallest subregion is of the order of short-distance cutoff \u201ca.\u201d\n1Level 0 indicates no holes in the boundary, Level 1 refers to punching out holes once, Level 2 twice and so on...\n2The bulk entropy Sb could be arising from a pure or mixed state. We shall be referring it as the entropy of the maximally mixed state.\n066014-2\nA. Reconstruction wedge in AdS3=CFT2 There are two questions that we will address in this section. First, does uberholography survive state-dependent reconstruction, i.e., can we still perform bulk reconstruction with fractal erasures in the boundary, when the bulk has a mixed state with large von Neumann entropy? Second, even if the scheme of reconstructing bulk information with fractal erasures on the boundary survives, to reconstruct the bulk information, how does the support on the boundary change, i.e., does it increase with the introduction of a maximally mixed state in the bulk? We find that the answer to the first question is yes at every level of iteration and the answer to second question turns out to be \u201cno\u201d to leading order as m \u2192 \u221e. The effect of entropy of the bulk state is exponentially suppressed with increasing iteration. Consider a state in the bulk with entropy Sb. At the first iteration, for the continuous phase to dominate over the discontinuous one, the following inequalitymust be satisfied:\nj\u03c7R1 j \u00fe j\u03c7R2 j \u2265 j\u03c7Rj \u00fe j\u03c7Hj \u00fe 4GSb \u00f08\u00de\nhinting an upper bound on Sb for a scheme for bulk reconstruction of deep interior operators to exist. This perceived upper bound is given by\n4GSb \u2264 2L log \u00f0r=2\u00de2 \u00f01 \u2212 r\u00de : \u00f09\u00de\nRearranging, the critical condition for r is given by\n\u00f0r 2 \u00de2\n\u00f01 \u2212 r\u00de \u00bc e 4GSb=2L: \u00f010\u00de\nSetting Sb \u00bc 0, we recover the condition in [12] \u00f0r 2 \u00de2\n\u00f01 \u2212 r\u00de \u00bc 1; \u00f011\u00de\ngiving us (5). Apparently it may look like from (9) that at level 1, Sb is bounded above by a finite value and as the bulk entropy becomes larger than this value, the connected phase gets dominated by the disconnected one, implying that information in the bulk can no longer be reconstructed. But it is not the case, as we will show here. For simplicity, let x \u00bc e4GSb=2L, which gives us the inequality\nr2 \u00fe 4rx \u2212 4x \u2265 0: \u00f012\u00de\nSolving for the critical case of equality, we get\nr \u00bc 2x ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe 1 x\nr \u2212 1 : \u00f013\u00de\nSetting x \u00bc 1 (Sb \u00bc 0), we recover the value of r as in (5). But it is clear that 0 < r < 1 for any value of Sb, making\nbulk reconstruction possible in principle. However, as we increase Sb, r approaches 1, making it less viable for any practical considerations (see Fig. 3). Our central interest is in understanding the behavior at large m. At level m of the fractal boundary erasure, the disconnected phase has a RT surface given by:\nj\u03c7R0 jdisconn \u00bc 2L 2m log \u00f0r 2 \u00demjRj a ; \u00f014\u00de\nwhile the connected phase has a RT surface\nj\u03c7R0 jconn\u00bc2L log jRj a \u00fe Xm j\u00bc1 2j\u22121 log \u00f0r 2 \u00dej\u22121\u00f01\u2212r\u00dejRj a :\n\u00f015\u00de\nWith a bulk state having entropy Sb, we arrive at the following inequality in place of (9):\n4GSb \u2264 2L\u00f02m \u2212 1\u00de log \u00f0r=2\u00de2 \u00f01 \u2212 r\u00de : \u00f016\u00de\nIn the m \u2192 \u221e limit, bulk reconstructability holds for any finite nonzero bulk entropy Sb, i.e., the connected phase always dominates over the disconnected one and the scheme of quantum error correction via uberholography for fractal erasures on the boundary is robust against statedependent reconstruction. However, the support on the boundary increases. We will now show that this increment is very small (negligible). Inverting Eq. (16) and considering the critical equality, we get the condition on r\n\u00f0r 2 \u00de2\n\u00f01 \u2212 r\u00de \u00bc e 4GSb=2L\u00f02m\u22121\u00de: \u00f017\u00de\n066014-3\nIn the limit m \u2192 \u221e, the RHS \u2192 1, approaching the value of r in Sb \u00bc 0 limit [12]\nr \u2192 2\u00f0 ffiffiffi 2 p \u2212 1\u00de: \u00f018\u00de\nComparing this result with Fig. 3, the asymptotic value of r at a higher level m \u2192 \u221e is not 1, but (18) (see Fig. 4). Thus, the code distance remains the same and we have a robust, state-independent uberholographic quantum error correcting code. This becomes more clear in the context of the construction discussed in [12]. In Fig. 5, with Sb \u00bc 0, \u039b is the logical boundary and \u03a6 is the physical boundary. The boundary subregion R is the remaining boundary after punching out holes. One may interpret the introduction of a bulk state with entropy Sb as the bulk geodesic moving further away from the logical inner boundary \u039b increasing the support on the boundary for bulk reconstruction. One may imagine a boundary \u039b0 to be the new \u201ceffective\u201d logical boundary with the inclusion of a mixed state in the bulk. This means that the radius of the inner boundary rin gets modified to some r0in (r 0 in > rin) while the radius of the outer boundary rout remains the same. As long as rout is much greater than r0in, the bulk reconstruction is possible. This is a reasonable assumption as rout is the boundary of the AdS space. Said another way, we can write the code rate (with Sb \u00bc 0) to be\nk n \u00bc e\u00f0rin\u2212rout\u00de=L; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere k and n are the number of logical and physical qubits respectively expressed in terms of lengths of inner and outer boundaries. With the introduction of mixed state in the bulk, rin \u2192 r0in, implying that the code rate depreciates with k \u2192 k0 (k0 > k). As long as k0 \u226a n, the is a reasonable error correcting scheme."

            "text": "CODE IN AdS4=CFT3\nAn example of uberholography in AdS4=CFT3 with a Sierpinski triangle shaped boundary is constructed in [10]. We will briefly review this. Consider the boundary Sierpinski triangle at level 0 (without holes) which is an equilateral triangle having sides of length l0. At level 1, we divide this triangle R into four smaller triangles and make a hole H by taking away the equilateral triangle in the center of side l1 \u00bc l02 \u2212 \u03f5 where \u03f5 > 0 is extremely small compared to l0. It suffices to take the length of the remaining triangles R1, R2, and R3 to be l0 2 (see Fig. 6). The punching of holes is reiterated (see Fig. 7). At level m, the 3m small triangles are taken to have a side of length lm \u00bc l0=2m, while the length of triangles forming holes ranges from l0=2 \u2212 \u03f5 to l0=2m \u2212 \u03f5. This construction is more subtle in the sense that the connected phase and disconnected phase have equal RT surface area at leading order at every level of hole iteration in the \u03f5 \u00bc 0 limit. It is shown in [22] that the minimal surface associated with a regular polygon with sharp corner picks up a corner contribution. For the case of a boundary subregion A in the shape of equilateral triangle of side L, the area of RT surface is given by\n066014-4\nj\u03c7Aj \u00bc 3L a \u2212 6b \u03c0 3 log 3L a ; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere a is the short-distance cutoff and \u03c7A is the RT surface associated with the boundary subregion A. Here b\u00f0\u03c0\n3 \u00de is a\nregulator-independent coefficient that depends only on the opening angle (in this case \u03c0=3) defined in [22]. See [23] for illuminating details about this coefficient. Recalling that in the absence of a bulk entropy, one arrived at the following inequality at level 1\nj\u03c7Rj \u00fe j\u03c7Hj \u2264 j\u03c7R1 j \u00fe j\u03c7R2 j \u00fe j\u03c7R3 j; \u00f021\u00de\nwhere the boundary is divided as shown in Fig. 6. Solving the critical case where this inequality is saturated under reasonable approximations discussed in [10], we get a lower bound on the value of \u03f5\n\u03f5 \u2265 2ab \u03c0\n3\nlog 3l0 4a : \u00f022\u00de\nFor a generic levelm, \u03f5 depends onm and now in general it would also depend on the bulk entropy Sb. This should be contrasted with the construction in AdS3=CFT2, where in the absence of bulb entropy Sb, the critical value of r did not depend on the level of m. The m-dependence of r was introduced by the presence of bulk entropy Sb on which r depended as well (as illustrated in Fig. 4)."

However, it is worth mentioning that as we make the length of the side of the triangle smaller than this cutoff length \u201ca,\u201d there is a breakdown of the entanglement wedge. Such a case would mean that the cutoff could be bounded below by a negative number and is thus unphysical. This is perhaps a relic of the untrustworthiness of theories below cutoffs. As we are talking about the Sierpinski triangle as boundary to AdS4, it is reasonable to assume l0 is very large and short-distance cutoff a is very small, one can always choose sufficiently large m to allow for state-independent bulk reconstruction (see Fig. 8)."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "We see that the robustness of the holographic quantum error correcting code against fractal noise persists even in finite temperature states of the CFT, or equivalently in black hole backgrounds. This is a priori surprising, as one might have thought that the black hole horizon size would have served as a finite cutoff to the uberholography generalization to higher dimensions. We believe that any purely IR contribution (e.g., a black hole in the center) becomes entropically negligible when the fractal contributions of (infinitely) many holes are considered, rendering the property of state-independence. A recent work [19] that appeared at the time of completion of this manuscript discusses uberholography in Cantor-set like erasures in higher dimensions. It also discusses the finite temperature effects on uberholography. This work is complementary to our work and tells a similar story in a different language.3\nGiven the continued robustness of uberholographic codes to fractal noise, the logical next step would be to determine the precise features of the holographic quantum error correcting code that permit its robustness against this form of error, and to port a novel code with such features into the realm of quantum computing. We will reserve both of these studies for future work."
