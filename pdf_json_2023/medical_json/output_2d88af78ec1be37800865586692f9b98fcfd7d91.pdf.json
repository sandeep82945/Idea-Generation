    "abstractText": "Carob (Ceratonia siliqua) is an exceptional source of significant bioactive compounds with great economic importance in the Mediterranean region, where it is widely cultivated. Carob fruit is used for the production of a variety of products and commodities such as powder, syrup, coffee, flour, cakes, and beverages. There is growing evidence of the beneficial effects of carob and the products made from it on a range of health problems. Therefore, metabolomics could be used to explore the nutrient-rich compounds of carob. Sample preparation is a crucial step in metabolomics-based analysis and has a great impact on the quality of the data obtained. Herein, sample preparation of carob syrup and powder was optimized, to enable highly efficient metabolomics-based HILICMS/MS analysis. Pooled powder and syrup samples were extracted under different conditions by adjusting pH, solvent type, and sample weight to solvent volume ratio (Wc/Vs). The metabolomics profiles obtained were evaluated using the established criteria of total area and number of maxima. It was observed that the Wc/Vs ratio of 1:2 resulted in the highest number of metabolites, regardless of solvent type or pH. Aqueous acetonitrile with a Wc/Vs ratio of 1:2 satisfied all established criteria for both carob syrup and powder samples. However, when the pH was adjusted, basic aqueous propanol 1:2 Wc/Vs and acidic aqueous acetonitrile 1:2 Wc/Vs provided the best results for syrup and powder, respectively. We strongly believe that the current study could support the standardization of the metabolomics sample preparation process to enable more efficient LC-MS/MS carob analysis.",

Its popularity is mainly due to its excellent nutritional and medicinal properties, as it is considered a functional food associated with the Mediterranean diet [1]. In the last decade, the interest in the sustainability and valorization of the carob tree (fruits, pods, and leaves) has increased beyond its unique agricultural importance as a fire- and drought-resistant tree [2]. Therefore, in modern societies, where the circular economy and climate change are gaining emerging attention, the potential contribution of the carob tree to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) is driven by the promotion of social (no poverty), health (well-being), and ecological (restoration and support of terrestrial ecosystems) balance; as a nutraceutical product, it supports UN SDGs 1\u20133, 5, 12, and 15 [3].\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13050645 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645 2 of 12\nThe chemical composition of the carob fruit depends on multiple factors such as cultivar, origin, climate conditions and harvesting time. Carob contains high amount of sugars (mostly sucrose, glucose, and fructose), proteins, minerals, and dietary fibers. It is also rich in polyphenols, such as tannins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, and contains lipids and vitamins, but is a caffeine- and theobromine-free pod with low fat content [4,5]. In analytical chemistry, there is a growing body of research on the importance of sample preparation, perhaps the most intensive, multi-stepped, time-consuming, and costly stage, before chemical analysis. As reported in Table 1, analysis of carob and its products includes the use of single, hyphenated, and instrumental platforms with low or advanced detection capabilities, covering mainly the fields of chromatography (liquid and gas chromatography), spectrometry (LC-MS, GC-MS, and tandem MS/MS) with low (photodiode array (PDA), refractive index (RI)) or high resolution (HR) detectors, and spectroscopy (NMR). As detailed below, almost all parts of the carob tree have been analysed for their phytochemical constituents. The nutritional benefits of carob pods, and traditional products of Cyprus origin are presented in [6]. The small molecules, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are responsible for the intense flavoring power of carob pods [7] and can be correlated with carob\u2019s ripening [8]. VOCs in association with multivariate data analysis (MDA), achieved the discrimination of carob pods based on their geographical origin [9]; the same was performed using MDA and carob\u2019s nutritional compositional values [10]. Lately, a wide range of sample extraction techniques have been applied to achieve better extraction performance from food matrices in general, and in particular for carob matrix: maceration (ME), liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), pulsed or continuous ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), Soxhlet extraction, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), QuEChERS, etc. All approaches aim to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of analytical methods, while boosting green extraction techniques with the goals of protection of the operator and the environment by minimizing solvent use [11]. For example, the phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of carob pods varied significantly with type of extraction process (UAE, MAE, Soxhlet, and SFE-CO2 were investigated) [12]. The work of Christou et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of UAE parameters of solid-solvent ratio, solvent concentration, extraction time, sonication amplitude, and sonication mode in the extraction of carob polyphenols [13]. Huma et al. (2018) focused on the MAE technique and its optimal conditions: microwave power, ethanol concentration, and solvent-to-sample ratio were tested for the extraction of total phenolic content (TPC) and condensed tannins [14]. Other researchers used the extracts of different solvents (diethyl-ether and ethyl acetate) to highlight the anti-cancer activity of carob pods [15]. Overall, a wide variation is observed in the applied extraction techniques, the employed analytical tools, as well as the agricultural characteristics of the investigated carob samples (e.g., carob variety, geographical origin, cultivation practices, maturation, altitude, micro-environment, etc.) [16]. This creates variations in the published results both on qualitative and quantitative level. The simultaneous analysis of several endogenous compounds in a single analytical run can present challenges due to the different physicochemical properties of analytes of interest. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), suitable for the analysis of polar or/and semi-polar metabolites, has been employed as a complementary chromatographic technique to reverse phase (RP) chromatography or ion-pair chromatography (IPC) for MS analysis. Commonly, in HILIC mode chromatography, a polar stationary phase is used (e.g., non-silica-based amino packings, underivatized silica, or modified silica), combined with high organic content (>90% v/v) mobile phases with the addition of different additives, such as HCOONH4 or CH3COONH4 [17]. The most important but tedious and difficult part of the analysis is that of sample preparation. According to a recent study by Justyna Potka-Wasylka et al. (2022), nearly 80% of the workflow time for instrumental chemical analysis is spent on sample preparation before analysis, a difficult and time-consuming step that directly affects the quality of the\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645 3 of 12\nresults even though operators occasionally underestimate this step [18]. The present work aims to determine the optimal protocol for the analysis of two carob matrices, namely syrup (liquid) and powder (solid), in order to identify the largest number of metabolites; towards this, the effects of extraction, pH adjustment, solvent, and sample weight to solvent volume ratio (Wc/Vs) were examined. To our knowledge, there is no other work on sample optimization of carob products using HILIC-MS/MS.\nChl: Chloroform; DE: Diethyl ether; EA: ethyl acetate; EtOH: Ethanol; H2O: Water; HCl: Hydrochloric acid; MeOH: Methanol; PE: Petroleum ether.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645 4 of 12"

            "text": "In total, two replicates of the 20 different prepared carob samples of each matrix were analysed and further assessed the worth of commonly used organic solvents and their respective aqueous mixtures in two extraction ratios (Wc/Vs), as well as in three pH values. The aim was to define the optimal protocol for the analysis of both matrices, in order to fully cover the extracted metabolites. Sample preparation, a fundamental process prior to\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645 6 of 12\nthe analysis, plays a crucial role in the quality of the obtained results and the robustness of the methodology [30]. Carob and carob products are considered challenging matrices due to the physicochemical characteristics of raw carob fruit and processed carob products. The criteria of the optimal Wc/Vs ratio for both analysed matrices were the total area (sum of peak areas) and the number of maxima (higher peak areas) [30]. Based on both criteria, for both carob products, the 1:2 Wc/Vs ratio was selected as it provided higher intensities and peak areas, as expected. Neither deterioration of the analytical system nor saturation of the detector (as possible obstacles) were observed for the dense extracts; thus, the last was chosen. For the solvent selection in the 1:2 Wc/Vs ratio resulting from the previous step, acetone, ACN, MeOH, PropOH, ACN:H2O, MeOH:H2O, and PropOH:H2O were tested. The aforementioned solvents and solvent mixtures are easy to use, commonly available in analytical laboratories, less toxic, easy to evaporate, and suitable for one-step global analysis and for the extraction of polar and semi-polar analytes providing reproducible results. The aqueous organic solvents were evaluated to achieve enhanced extraction recovery of the metabolites. As illustrated in the bar plots for carob syrup (Figure 2), aqueous ACN 1:2 Wc/Vs presented the highest total area, followed by aqueous MeOH and aqueous PropOH, by an infinitesimal difference. The highest total peak area was also attributed to the highest number of maxima for aqueous ACN 1:2 Wc/Vs. Interestingly, while aqueous MeOH showed a higher total peak area compared to aqueous PropOH 1:2 Wc/Vs, the number of maxima presented the opposite trend. For carob powder, in Figure 3 it is observed that aqueous ACN 1:2 Wc/Vs presented the highest total peak area, as expected, due to the very large number of maxima. Although neat and aqueous MeOH 1:2 Wc/Vs and aqueous PropOH 1:2 Wc/Vs showed similar total peak areas, the aqueous PropOH 1:2 Wc/Vs was, notably, the only extraction solvent mixture that presented maximum peak areas. In both carob products, neat organic solvents indicated lower peak area values and a minor number of maximum peaks, compared to their respective aqueous mixtures. As expected, polar and semi-polar compounds were favorably extracted in the presence of an aqueous amount in the solvent mixture. Metabolites 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 15\nFigure 2.

Carob is considered an acidic product, with a pH value close to 6.5, while the pH value of both tested products also ranged between 4.4 and 5.5 [32,33]. Thus, it was an interesting point to investigate, whereas pH adjustment of solvent mixtures would affect metabolites extraction of the acidic matrices. For syrup samples, independent of the aqueous extraction solvent, basic pH demonstrated higher total peak areas, as it probably favors the measured metabolites.

Furthermore, the analysed samples were clustered by solvent mixture and propanol showed the lowest deviation in both matrices.

PCA score plot of carob products according to aqueous solvent mixtures and pH conditions.\nFrom the 80 metabolites included in the targeted metabolomics-based method, the detected metabolites in each carob product were categorized into eight lasse , according to their ch mical taxonomy (Table 2), ased on Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) [34]. In syrup, 32 compounds were not det cted, while 16 metabolites namely adenine, creatine, creatinine, cytidine, kynurenate, maltose, nicotinic acid, putrescine, pyruvic acid, serine, taurine, theobromine, threonine, tyrosine, xanthine, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, did\nnot satisfy the aforementioned criteria. Th highest number of compounds were met in\n5 tested conditions, namely basic aqueous PropOH, PropOH, MeOH, neutral aqueous MeOH, and neutral aqueous ACN, while the lowest was met in ACN. The majority of the extracted analytes belonged to organooxygen compounds carbohydrates and carbohydrate conjugates, followed by carboxyl acids and derivatives, amino acids, peptides, and analogs, both classes of high biological significance. Notably, cytidine was only extracted in neutral aqueous ACN protocol, while nicotinic acid was favorabl extra ted in n utral aqueous PropOH. Caffeine w s not detected since carob is a on-caffeine product [6]. To our surprise,\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645 9 of 12\nglycine, isoleucine, arginine, tryptophan, aspartic acid, methionine, glutamic acid, lysine, and histidine were not detected or were under the limit of detection (LOD) for the applied method, although it was expected to be present in carob syrup. A possible explanation may be attributed to the thermal process of carob syrup production [35]. The total numbers of detected metabolites in syrup, based on the criteria described in Section 2.4, is summarized in Table 3. A greater number of compounds were detected in carob powder samples compared to syrup. Forty-three out of 80 analytes were excluded according to the discussed criteria. Neutral aqueous ACN favored the extraction of most analytes, while neat ACN solvent extracted the least. Guanine was only extracted with aqueous PropOH but was further excluded from statistical evaluation. As illustrated in Table 4, most of the extracted analytes belonged to the same chemical categorization.\n* S: Carob syrup; ** P: Carob powder.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 645 10 of 12\nThis study attempted to provide an optimal sample preparation protocol for carob products. However, a single extraction sample preparation process for such diverse molecules with different physicochemical properties, is considered a challenging task. All criteria selected for the optimal conditions, number of extracted peaks, number of maxima, total area, and standard deviation of replicates, were chosen to provide a more global and, at the same time, selective approach limited for the specific carob analytes. Solvent evaporation and reconstitution in the mobile phase in the sample preparation protocol were performed to secure comparable results among the studied methodologies. The optimal extraction sample weight to solvent volume ratio was selected upon the set criteria, although the high density of the obtained extract could affect the analytical system\u2019s performance (detector saturation, analytical column, source contamination, peak overlap). In an analysis of a large number of samples this should be taken into consideration."

            "text": "Carob syrup and carob powder sample preparation were studied for the optimal extraction of nutrient polar and semi-polar metabolites using HILIC-MS/MS. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt where various parameters, namely the number of metabolites, the effects of extraction, pH adjustment, solvent, and sample weight to solvent volume ratio (Wc/Vs) were examined with the aim of polar profiling the two different carob matrices. Aqueous acetonitrile at 1:2 Wc/Vs satisfied the established criteria for both carob syrup and powder samples. Nevertheless, when the pH was modified, a ratio of 1:2 Wc/Vs in basic pH using aqueous PropOH as the extraction solvent presented the optimal results for syrup analysis, while for carob powder analysis, acidic aqueous acetonitrile 1:2 Wc/Vs would be the best possible choice to obtain a satisfactory number of metabolites and extraction recovery. The current study suggests an optimal sample preparation protocol focused on small polar and semi-polar metabolites appropriate for HILIC-MS/MS analysis. The optimal process should be adapted to the specific needs and intentions of each study; thus, the suggested protocol should not be considered a universal approach.
