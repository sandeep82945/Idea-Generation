    "abstractText": "The miniaturization of ion trap mass analyzers is an important direction in the development of mass spectrometers. In this work, we proposed two models of miniaturized HreLIT with a field radius of about 2 mm based on the existing research on conventional HreLIT and other ion traps, one with ions ejection slits on one pair of electrodes only (2-slit model) and the other with the same slits on all electrodes (4-slit model). The relationship of mass resolution with r/rx and the \u201cstretch\u201d distance of electrodes in the ejection direction is investigated by theoretical simulations. Trends of electric fields inside the ion traps were discussed as well. The comparable maximum resolution is observed at r/rx = 2/1.4 in both models, but stretching simulations revealed that the peak resolution of the 2-slit model was higher than that of the other model by about 8%. The highest value of 517 was obtained when stretching 1.1 mm. Furthermore, the resolution of ions with m/z = 119 could exceed 1000 when the scan rate was reduced to 800 Th/s. The mass spectrometry capability of miniature HreLIT has been confirmed theoretically, and it laid the foundation for the subsequent fabrication with MEMS technology.",

            "text": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is an essential analytical technique for measuring the m/z of ions. Recent developments in mars and lunar exploration [1,2] and public health emergencies [3] have heightened the need for portable mass spectrometers capable of rapid on-site detecting, and the miniaturization of mass analyzers is the key to reducing the size of MS devices. Ion traps consist of simple structures, possessing the capability to multi-stage tandem mass analysis with only one single device, and are superior in miniaturization compared with other mass analyzers. In addition, the low requirements for the supporting experimental conditions are of benefit to satisfying the needs of diverse real-time analysis. The three-dimensional (3D) ion trap reported by Paul [4] and the two-dimensional linear ion trap (LIT) proposed by Schwartz [5] laid the foundation for modern research of ion trap mass analyzers. The latter provided higher ion capacity and trapping efficiency. Both ion traps were built with hyperbolic-shaped electrodes that require extremely high machining and assembly accuracy, and the performance is sensitive to machining errors. Therefore, a growing number of ion traps with simplified electrodes based on the two models were reported to reduce the difficulties of preparation with acceptable performance loss. For example, a cylindrical ion trap [6,7] (CIT) was proposed to simplify the electrodes of a 3D ion trap; a rectilinear ion trap [8] (RIT) with planar-shaped electrodes combined some advantages of LIT and CIT; a triangular-electrode linear ion trap [9] (TeLIT) was built\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1572. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13101572 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1572 2 of 9\nby modifying RIT, etc. Offering a resolution higher than 4000, the LIT-based half-round rod electrodes linear ion trap (HreLIT) reported by Li et al. [10] is conducive to fabricating compact analyzers. Various novel ion traps with electrodes that are easy to prepare could have significant applications for miniaturization. The common ion traps with simplified electrodes were reported with field radii ranging from 4 mm to 6 mm and have been applied in benchtop or over-the-shoulder mass spectrometers. Despite the certain size reduction, there has been an increasing interest in high-performance palm portable mass spectrometers with miniature mass analyzers because of nowadays timely detection requirements under complicated conditions. For example, a palm portable mass spectrometer (PPMS) reported by Sam Yang Chemical Company [11] has a size of 82 \u00d7 77 \u00d7 245 mm; the MX908 developed by 908 Devices [12] is a little bigger but just 298 \u00d7 216 \u00d7 122 mm in size, both instruments are capable of detecting environmental components with single-handed operation. In order to miniaturize ion traps, micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology, which could break the bottleneck of conventional processing methods, has been exerting a tremendous fascination on researchers. In this case, a Halo ion trap [13] with a field radius of only 0.5 mm was fabricated with MEMS technology, but the low resolution was confirmed; Yu et al. [14] reported an RIT with a field radius of 1.5 mm, being built by stereo lithography apparatus (SLA) and offering a slightly higher resolution of 100; Huang and co-worker [15] optimized a MEMS-based RIT by working on the relationships of ion trapping efficiency with length\u2013 width ratio and radio frequency (RF) voltage; Szyszka et al. [16] combined the MEMS with 3D printing technology successfully to fabricate a miniature quadrupole mass analyzer, but this structure has lower resolution and ion capacity compared with ion traps. The miniature RIT array proposed in our laboratory [17] was prepared by MEMS technology, and the resolution could exceed 700. However, there remains much room for improvement compared with ion traps in conventional size. Definitely, MEMS technology plays a prominent role in the miniaturization of mass analyzers, and there exists an obvious conflict between mini size and high performance. The exploration of more balanced miniature ion traps with different structures is indispensable. LIT, CIT, and RIT are widely applied in miniaturized ion traps. Although CIT facilitates miniaturization, the physical limits of 3D ion traps determine the low resolution and charge capacity. For LIT and RIT, on the one hand, the closer the shape of electrodes is to the hyperboloid, the more ideal the quadrupole field will be. On the other hand, the mass resolution could be improved significantly by optimizing the geometric parameters in a fixed shape of electrodes [5,18]. The excessive high-order fields introduced by the oversimplified planar-shaped electrodes of the RIT are more pronounced at micro size, and in consequence, the resolution would be limited to an unremarkable range even with sufficient optimization [17]. Meanwhile, the promising HreLIT with a field radius of about 5 mm provides excellent MS capability, and the performance could be further improved after optimization [19,20]. Its performance at micro size is worth investigating accordingly. In the present work, the miniature HreLIT with a field radius of about 2 mm was modeled and optimized, referring to the methods applied by conventional ion traps. How the slits on electrodes, field radius, and \u201cstretch\u201d distance of electrodes in ejection direction affect, MS capability was investigated by computer simulations. The objective was to explore the feasibility of miniaturizing HreLIT and lay the foundation for future fabrication based on the non-silicon MEMS technology in our laboratory."

            "text": "In order to verify the feasibility of developing miniature HreLIT, two models with two slits and four slits on electrodes, respectively, were proposed and investigated by theoretical simulations. The results indicated that at 2250 Th/s, both models performed comparably and excellently when r/rx = 2/1.4. Furthermore, the \u201cstretch\u201d simulations on this basis manifested that the 2-slit model possessed about 8% higher peak resolution, but the 4-slit model performed well in 0.6~1.6 mm of \u0394ry, a wider range compared with 0.7~1.4 mm. The highest resolution of 517 was obtained by the 2-slit model with \u0394ry = 1.1 mm (ry = 2.5 mm). This value could be significantly improved with a reduction in scan rate at the acceptable cost of intensity. Consequently, the resolution of 1017, 44% higher than that of the previous miniature four-channel RIT, was observed at a scan rate of 800 Th/s. In future research, MEMS technology will be applied to fabricate the miniature HreLIT, and its MS capability will be characterized experimentally."
