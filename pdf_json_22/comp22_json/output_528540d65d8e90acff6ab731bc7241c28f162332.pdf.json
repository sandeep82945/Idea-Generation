            "text": "For any salient property of recursively enumerable (RE) theories P , one can ask the obvious question is there a weakest RE theory satisfying P? But what does weakest mean here? A traditional answer is to take a theory T to be given by a RE set of axioms A. Weakest is then interpreted as T has P and no theory axiomatized by a proper subset of A has P .\nA paradigmatic example of an answer to our question under this reading, for the case where we take P to be essential undecidability, is the well-known result by Tarski et al. that the theory Q with its standard axiomatization is minimally essentially undecidable in the sense that all theories given by a proper subset of the axioms have a decidable extension. See [13, Chapter 2, Theorem 11]. Similar results for theories of concatenation were obtained by Juvenal Murwanashyaka. See [8]. For the theory R, a result in the same spirit is due to Cobham. See [7]. Only here minimality is applied to natural groups of axioms rather than to single axioms.\nThe above results crucially depend on the chosen axiom set. After all, each nontrivial finitely axiomatizable theory is axiomatizable by a single axiom. Suppose pure predicate logic does not satisfy P . If a finitely axiomatized theory has property P , then it is automatically minimal with respect to the single-axiom axiomatization.

For example, we may relativize the quantifiers in the axioms for plus and times to the class of x such that Sx = x. Jones and Shepherdson [7] provide an example of an essentially undecidable sub-theory of R that is strictly below R in the sense that it proves strictly less theorems. However, they do strengthen one axiom group in order to be able to drop another.\nIn this paper, we zoom in on the property of essential undecidability of RE theories and we consider an ordering of RE theories that only depends on the theory-qua-set-of-theorems, to wit interpretability. So, we ask whether there is an interpretability-minimal RE essentially undecidable theory. In this paper, we show that there is no such theory. Thus, our main result is the following.\nTHEOREM 1.1 There is no interpretability-minimal RE essentially undecidable theory.\nIt is easy to see that, if an RE theory is minimally essentially undecidable with respect to interpretability, then it is, ipso facto, the minimum RE theory, modulo mutual interpretability. This is because essentially undecidable RE theories are closed under finite infima. Thus, it is sufficient to prove the following lemma.\nLEMMA 1.2 There is no RE essentially undecidable theory that is the interpretability-minimum.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic concepts needed for the paper as a whole. This section also contains the reduction of Theorem 1.1 to Lemma 1.2. In Section 3, we give a simple proof that there is no minimal theory with respect to interpretability among finitely axiomatized theories. In Section 4, we prove Theorem 1.1. We provide two different proofs. The first proof employs a direct diagonalization argument; the second reduces our question to a general recursion theoretic result.\nREMARK 1.3 Our main question can be asked for other notions than essential undecidability. The question whether there is an interpretability minimal recursively inseparable theory is answered negatively in [2]. The question whether there is an interpretability minimal essentially hereditarily undecidable theory is answered negatively in [16].\nIt seems reasonable to demand that the property under consideration is preserved by the relevant reduction relation. We brief ly look at the case of undecidability, which is not preserved under mutual interpretability.\nPredicate logic with one binary relation symbol is interpretable in all theories. However, it is mutually interpretable with, e.g. the decidable theory that says that there is precisely one element. So, in a sense, predicate logic with one binary relation symbol is the interpretability minimal undecidable theory, but, we feel, this statement is somewhat misleading.\nThe more reasonable question would be whether there is an undecidable theory W that is minimal w.r.t. faithful interpretability. The answer here is no. By a classical theorem of Feferman [3], we have undecidable theories in each RE Turing degree (see Theorem 4.9 of this paper for Shoenfield\u2019s strengthening of Feferman\u2019s result). If U is faithfully interpretable in V , then the Turing degree of U is lesser or equal to the Turing degree of V . So, W should have the minimum non-recursive RE Turing degree, but there is no such degree.\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /logcom /advance-article/doi/10.1093/logcom /exad005/7080260 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nNo minimal essentially undecidable theories 3"

We will encounter some theories of infinite signature and some theories that are not RE, but these cases will be clear from the context.\nOur results are about theories-qua-sets-of-theorems. However, our methods sometimes demand the intensional perspective where the axiom set is given by a formula or by a recursive index.\nThere is a whole range of notions of interpretability. We can or cannot have pieces, multidimensionality, parameters, relativization, non-preservation of identity. Our main result is not sensitive to the specific details of the notion of interpretation as long as we consider mixtures of these specific features.\nWe want to prove that there is no interpretability-minimal RE essentially undecidable theory. The proof can be divided in a preliminary step and a main step.\nI. We show that, modulo mutual interpretability, if there is an interpretability-minimal RE essentially undecidable theory, then there is an interpretability-minimum RE essentially undecidable theory. To do this, we show (i) that interpretability is a lower semi-lattice (modulo mutual interpretability), i.e. binary infima exist and (ii) that infima preserve essential undecidability. This gives the reduction of Theorem 1.1 to Lemma 1.2.\nII. We prove Lemma 1.2.\nBelow, we will define one uniform construction on theories defining the binary minimum operation. This construction provides a binary minimum for all notions of interpretability that are given by combinations of the above features. So, (I) works for all such notions.\nIt is immediate that, if we have (II) for the most inclusive notion, where we have pieces, multidimensionality, parameters, relativization, non-preservation of identity, then we also have it for all weaker notions. So, we only need to prove (II) for our strongest notion of interpretability. Alternatively, one could look at what is used in the proof of (II) and see that all notions satisfy these assumptions.\nIn this paper, we will use the most inclusive notion, to wit piecewise, multidimensional (with dimensions varying over pieces), relative, non-identity-preserving interpretability with parameters.\nWe refer the reader for definitions to [15]. Here, we will just fix notations and give some basic facts.\nWe write U V for U interprets V and V U for V is interpretable in U . Given two theories U and V , we form W := U V in the following way. The signature of W is the disjoint union of the signatures of U and V with an additional fresh zero-ary predicate P. The theory W is axiomatized by the axioms P \u2192 \u03c6 if \u03c6 is a U-axiom and \u00ac P \u2192 \u03c8 if \u03c8 is a V -axiom. One can show that U V is the infimum of U and V in the interpretability ordering . This result works for all choices of our notion of interpretation.1 We note that preserves finite axiomatizability.\nA theory is essentially undecidable iff all its consistent extensions in the same language are undecidable. Salient examples of essentially undecidable theories are R and Q. See [13]. We have the following basic insights.\n1It is a bit strange that we use a disjunction-like notation for an infimum. This strangeness is due to the fact that the conventional choice for the interpretability-ordering puts the weakest theory below where in boolean algebras the strongest proposition is the lower one. In our notation, we follow the boolean intuition and view our operation as a kind of disjunction of theories.\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /logcom /advance-article/doi/10.1093/logcom /exad005/7080260 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024"

The first claim follows immediately from Theorem 2.1 and the transitivity of interpretability. To prove the second claim, we assume for a contradiction that there is a consistent decidable extension T of U V . Either T is consistent with P or with \u00acP. If T is consistent with P, then T + P is a consistent decidable theory that interprets U , contradicting essential undecidability of U . Analogously, if T is consistent with \u00acP, then T + \u00acP is a consistent decidable theory that interprets V , contradicting essential undecidability of V .\nWe note that the fact that essentially undecidable theories are closed under binary infima implies that, if there is an interpretability-minimal one, then there is a minimum with respect to interpretability.

It follows that there is a sequence of arithmetical sentences (\u03b1i)i<\u03c9 such that the complete consistent extensions of PA are precisely the theories PAX , for X \u2286 \u03c9. Of course, here, the sequence of the \u03b1i cannot be recursive.\nAny PLL theory would be a suitable tool for the development in this paper. In Appendix A.1, we prove a characterization of PLL that suggests that there are many such theories. It is pleasant, however, to employ one specific PLL theory. We choose the theory Jan, that has the further good property that all its extensions are locally finite. See below. The theory Jan is the theory of one equivalence relation with the following extra axioms, for each n.\n\u2022 There is at most one equivalence class of n elements. \u2022 There are at least n equivalence classes of at least n elements. The theory Jan is an extension of the theory of one equivalence relation studied by Janiczak. See [5]. We define the statement An as the sentence expressing that there is at least one equivalence class with precisely n + 1 elements. THEOREM 4.3 Jan is PLL.\n2This notion is not precisely the same as recursive boolean isomorphism in the sense of the existence of a recursive bijection of sentences that commutes with the propositional connectives and that preserves provability. See [1] and [16] for further discussion of such distinctions.\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /logcom /advance-article/doi/10.1093/logcom /exad005/7080260 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nNo minimal essentially undecidable theories 7\nThe theorem follows immediately from the quantifier elimination presented in [5]. For completeness, we present here a simple alternative proof.\nPROOF. The countable models of Jan are precisely the models of the following form: (i) for each n, there may or there may not be an equivalence class of size n; and (ii) there are \u03ba countably infinite equivalence classes, where, if there are infinitely many finite equivalence classes, 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 \u21350 and, if there are finitely many finite equivalence classes, \u03ba = \u21350.\nConsider any countable model M of Jan. We extend the language of Jan with new constants ci. Let W be the theory of M in the extended language plus the following axioms:\n\u2022 ci is not equivalent to cj, for i = j; \u2022 the equivalence class of ci has at least n elements, for any i and n. By compactness, W is consistent. So, it has a countable model N with countably infinitely many countably infinite equivalence classes. In the original language, N is elementarily equivalent to M. Modulo isomorphism, N is uniquely determined by which finite equivalence classes there are in M.\nIn the role of the \u03b1i, we take the statements Ai. Thus, given X \u2286 \u03c9, all models M of JanX are elementarily equivalent, and so JanX is complete.\nREMARK 4.4 Theorem 4.3, in combination with Theorem 4.1, implies that any extention-in-the-same-language of Jan is locally finite. This means that every finite sub-theory has a finite model. It follows that every RE extention-in-the-same-language of Jan is interpretable in the Tarski\u2013Mostowski\u2013 Robinson theory R by the main result of [14].\nInstead of Jan, we can also employ a certain successor theory Succ\u25e6. We treat this theory in Appendix A.2."

Thus, there is an essentially undecidable theory in every RE, non-recursive Turing degree.\nPROOF. For any consistent RE extension V of sh(a), the set {i | V Ai} clearly is an RE set separating B and C and hence A is Turing reducible to V . It is obvious that sh(a) is consistent. Thus, to finish the proof we only need to show that sh(a) is Turing reducible to A.\nWe describe an A-recursive procedure of checking whether a given sentence \u03d5 of the language of Jan is a theorem of sh(a). We can effectively find a boolean combination \u03d5\u2217 of Ai that is equivalent over Jan to \u03c6. Let the set of indices of Ai occurring in \u03c6\u2217 be I. Also, we can effectively find, using A as an oracle, the conjunction \u03c8 of the Aj with j \u2208 B \u2229 I and the \u00acAs with s \u2208 C \u2229 I.

We see that N is, w.r.t. the original language, elementarily equivalent to M and that N has countably infinitely many copies of Z. This means that N is uniquely determined by the finite cycles in M.\nWe take as \u03b1n the statement that there is a cycle of size n + 1.
