FACT-19, the\nquestionnaire for the assessment of pandemic stress load, measures (1) pre-pandemic\nstress, (2) pandemic stress, and (3) contextual factors (functioning as facilitators or\nbarriers). Derived from this model, the stress barometer as a brief screening instrument\ncaptures these factors. The purpose of this study is a preliminary validation of\nthe instrument.\nMethod: The stress barometer was applied in conjunction with the Symptom-Checklist\nSCL-90-S at the beginning of the first lockdown in psychosomatic and\npsychotraumatological care in two federal states in Germany. The sample consists of\nn = 341 (68.6% female) from 18\u201373 years of age (M = 49.36, SD = 11.4).\nResults: The structure of the short screening was examined in the overall sample\nusing an exploratory factor analysis [Chi\u00b2 (78) = 875.720, KMO = 0.688]. The results\nindicate a four-factor-structure that explains 59.5% of the total cumulative variance. The\nfactors of the stress barometer correlate with the Global Severity Index (GSI, measured by\nSCL-90-S) with moderate to weak effects: pre-pandemic stress (rs = 0.431, p < 0.001,\nn= 295), pandemic stress (rs = 0.310, p< 0.001, n= 298), distal facilitator (rs =\u22120.155,\np < 0.001, n = 312), and proximal barriers (rs = 0.232, p < 0.001, n = 312).\nDiscussion: The results indicate the suitability of the stress barometer to complement\nthe measurement of the impact of pandemics with an ICF-oriented approach, taking into\nconsideration pre-pandemic stress as well as interactions with facilitators and barriers.\nFurther analysis will be necessary for a revision of the items of the scale.\nKeywords: stress barometer, COVID-19, pandemic stress reaction, ICF-orientated, short screening"

            "text": "As SARS-CoV-2 began to spread, the far-reaching psychosocial impacts of the pandemic quickly became apparent. The protective measures taken to contain the pandemic (e.g., quarantine, contact restrictions) are among others accompanied by social isolation, of which negative consequences for mental health have been proven (R\u00f6hr et al., 2020). Moreover, an increase in domestic violence has been recorded since the lockdown began (Kofman and Garfin, 2020). For working parents, school and daycare closure in combination with the shift to working from home represents a double burden of balancing work, childcare, and homeschooling, which at the same time is tightening gender differences (Feng and Savani, 2020). Furthermore, widespread closure of restaurants, retail, and the event industry go along with loss of income leading to economic existential fear (Blustein and Guarino, 2020). All in all, the courses of the disease itself, the impact of protective measures, and fear of infection led to a particular risk suspected among people with mental health disorders (Hossain et al., 2020; Javed et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020).\nNot only existing psychometric instruments have been applied to assess pandemic-related stress reaction since the beginning of the pandemic, but also several newly developed subjective scales have emerged, such as the fear of COVID-19 scale (Bitan et al., 2020), the COVID stress scales (CSS; Taylor et al., 2020), the pandemic stress index (Harkness et al., 2020), and the COVID19 Pandemic Stress Scale (CPSS; Werner et al., 2021). These scales tend to follow a bio-medical perspective on pandemicrelated stress reaction, focusing primarily on one dimension, e.g., fear and anxiety or perceived stress. So far, there has been little empirical attention on bio\u2013psycho\u2013social approaches.\nWe postulate that due to the dynamic evolution of pandemics, an exclusive consideration of psychological symptom burden or the assignment of diagnosis is not sufficient to assess their psychosocial impact. Instead, a more dimensional, bio\u2013psycho\u2013 social approach is necessary to consider pre-existing risk factors as well as resources and barriers alongside the pandemic stress itself (Eckhard et al., 2021a)."

            "text": "To introduce a bio\u2013psycho\u2013social approach to determine the impact of pandemics, firstly an adequate classification system is needed at the base of a screening instrument. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) was officially endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 as the international standard for the description and measurement of functioning and disability (World Health Organization, 2002). Since then, the ICF is complementing the bio-medical system of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\nThe base of the ICF is the universally applicable bio\u2013 psycho\u2013social model, in which the effects of a health condition (coded according to the ICD) on a person\u2019s activity and participation are displayed on interaction with their facilitating or inhibiting contextual factors. Functional\nhealth and disability are therefore defined as outcomes of the interactions between health conditions and contextual factors (DIMDI, 2005).\nTo approach the assessment of pandemic stress reaction from a bio\u2013psycho\u2013social perspective, a model called FACT-19 was developed in orientation to the ICF during the first national lockdown in Germany (Bering et al., 2020a). FACT-19 suggests a triangular model for the measurement of pandemic-related stress reactions (Bering et al., 2020c). It consists of the following three components:\n1) Risk factors\nPart one of the model is designed to capture pre-pandemic stress burden. Pre-existing risk factors such as traumatic experiences, general medical risk factors, or other stressful life experiences are thought to have a greater influence on the probability of developing long-term health effects after stressful experiences instead of acute psychological symptom burden, and are therefore examined (Bering et al., 2011).\n2) Sources of pandemic stress load\nThe second part of the model aims to identify the individual pandemic-related stress burden. Considering the number of known psychosocial consequences of pandemics, four sources of pandemic stress load are proposed:\na. Lethal threat\nSource A, lethal threat summarizes the confrontation of those affected and their relatives with a potentially lethal threat due to an infection with SARS-CoV-2, especially, and not only the elderly and people with previous illnesses are particularly at risk.\nb. Economic existential threat\nThe term economic existential threat (Source B) describes the economic consequences of the pandemic. A widespread shutdown of restaurants, the event industry, and retail go alongside job loss, indebtedness, or insolvency of self-employment, leading to a perceived existential threat.\nc. Isolation\nIn Source C, experiences in connection with isolation due to quarantine and contact restrictions are summarized. For many, the beginning of the pandemic meant balancing working from home with childcare and the assumption of homeschooling due to the closure of schools and daycare. These factors furthermore are accompanied by an increase in conflicts and domestic violence.\nd. Fear dynamic\nFear dynamic (Source D) represents concerns and worries related to the pandemic: fear of infection with the virus and its health consequences, as well as worries related to possible social and economic consequences for those affected, their relatives included.\n3) Facilitators and barriers\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879535\nThe third factor of the FACT-19 model represents the interaction with contextual factors, which in accordance with the ICF, can be perceived as moderating or reinforcing the experienced stress burden (e.g., social support and stable job and housing situation vs. lack of social network or debt). In terms of the pandemic, additional contextual factors can be identified: psychoeducation, health behavior education as resources or facilitators vs. visitation bans in hospitals, limited living space, COVID-19 reporting in social media as barriers (Eckhard et al., 2021a)."

The brief screening instrument, the stress barometer (Bering et al., 2020b), for the immediate and rapid measurement of subjective pandemic stress was implemented in psychotraumatological and psychosomatic care in two clinics in Germany and will be subject to the present study.\nGiven the psychosocial impact factors of the pandemic, the need for an effective screening instrument with practical applicability became apparent at the beginning of the pandemic. The intention to develop the stress barometer was to create a short, easy-to-perform, subjective questionnaire that can be applied and evaluated in a short amount of time. Furthermore, the aim was to capture not only the acute stress caused by the pandemic and its consequences but to consider the pre-pandemic stress (risk factors that can influence the perceived pandemic impact as well as contextual factors), following hereby a bio\u2013 psycho\u2013social approach. The identification of the individual, dominant sources of pandemic stress load serves to efficiently provide the necessary support to those affected.\nThe present study aims at a preliminary evaluation of the short screening instrument, as well as an investigation of its suitability to measure pandemic stress experiences."

Considering the course of the pandemic, the data collection in Sample 2 started during a period of the pandemic when restrictions were being eased and ended with the beginning of the second national lockdown.

The handling of participants who scored high is based on the individual pandemic stress load. The sources of pandemic stress and participation serve as a starting point for the initiation of necessary therapeutic interventions and participation-oriented, rehabilitative services. For a patient scoring high in Source B, economic existential threat, the instruments of social work and rehabilitation take effect (e.g., direct advice and mediation of state assistance or occupational rehabilitation measures as interventions for patients whose earning capacity is at risk in the long term). Given a dominance in Source C on the other hand, interventions might focus on psychosocial conflict resolution.\nPractical support for the identified profile of individual pandemic stress burden was provided in Sample 1 in individual sessions and in Sample 2 in group therapy sessions."

According to Kaiser, a value of 0.50 is suggested as the lowest acceptable limit, even though a value above 0.80 is desirable (Kaiser, 1974).\nThe principal component analysis with varimax rotation suggests the presence of four factors with eigenvalues >1.0. The items of the stress barometer and the corresponding factor loads are displayed in Table 2. On this ground, a four-factor solution is chosen, which explains 59.5% of the cumulative total variance. Accordingly, the measurement accuracy of these is tested via internal consistency as a measurement of reliability: pre-pandemic stress (items 1\u20133; Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.520) and sources of pandemic stress (items 4-7, \u03b1 = 0.783). For the remaining items, the factor analysis suggests a distinction between proximal (items 8\u20139) and distal contextual factors (item 10), which due to the bipolarity of the items will be further subdivided into facilitators and barriers. Due to the subdivision of each into two separate items, the item count in Table 2 differs from the original number of items of the screening instrument.\nGiven that the factors consist of only two items, the measurement accuracy is tested via the Spearman\u2013Brown coefficient. The following values are obtained: proximal facilitators (0.692) and proximal barriers (0.549). Preliminary theoretical assumptions suggest that items 8\u201310 each correspond to the general component contextual factors. To mark the subdivision indicated by the findings of the factor analysis, in the following they will be called proximal and distal facilitators and barriers."

The analysis shows that the t-tests for the regression coefficient of age (t = 2.180, p < 0.05), general symptom burden (t= 4.539, p< 0.01), and risk factors (t= 2.596, p < 0.05) are significant and therefore have a significant effect on pandemic stress load. The variables sex, school education, and vocational education are not significant and therefore are not further analyzed.\nWhen the general symptom burden increases by one-unit, the pandemic stress burden increases by 0.912 units, holding all other independent variables constant. When risk factors increase by one, pandemic stress increases by 0.193 units. When age increases by one unit (year), pandemic stress increases by 0.29 units, holding all other independent variables constant. The corrected R\u00b2 is = 0.152, meaning that 15.2% of the total variance in pandemic stress burden is explained by general symptom burden, risk factors, and age, which according to Cohen (1992) corresponds to a medium effect."

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to provide an initial review of the application-oriented brief screening for pandemic stress exposure. The findings suggest that the underlying construct of the stress barometer postulating the components pre-pandemic stress, pandemic stress, and contextual factors can be partly confirmed. Instead of assigning item 10 to contextual factors as presumed, the results of the explorative factor analysis indicate a further subdivision of this component into proximal (social and family support) and distal contextual factors (e.g., precautions of the government). The hereby emerging four-factor solution explains 59.5% of the overall variance. Considering preliminary theoretical assumptions as in the bio\u2013psycho\u2013social model, we postulate that proximal and distal facilitators and barriers correspond to the more general term of contextual factors.\nThe Spearman rho correlation between the components of the brief screening instrument and the global severity index serves as a preliminary evaluation of the suitability of the stress barometer to measure subjective stress burden. From the factors of the instrument, the highest correlation is observed between pre-pandemic stress and the GSI. The factor pre-pandemic stress evaluates the existing stress burden in the immediate time before the outbreak of the pandemic, which functions as a risk\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879535\nfactor. The higher the risk factors, the higher seems to be the general symptom burden. Preliminary theoretical assumptions postulate the interaction of contextual factors with stress burden. Functioning as facilitators or barriers, contextual factors are thought to have a moderating or aggravating influence on the impact of the individual. Considering the findings of this analysis, the strongest correlation becomes apparent between facilitators and barriers. The deriving question is, why do contextual factors influence relatively little the symptom burden? Earlier investigations have shown that functional levels serve as a more adequate parameter to indicate long-term effects than the actual symptom burden (Bering et al., 2011). Further analysis will be necessary to examine functional levels, e.g., the global assessment of functioning (GAF) (Aas, 2011). The multiple regression analysis confirmed that 15.2% of the total variance in pandemic stress burden is explained by general symptom burden, risk factors, and age. To investigate the consistency of the short screening, a sample comparison is conducted. The analysis shows small to no differences in the factors of the stress barometer between\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879535\nthe samples, indicating similar findings of the short screening in both samples."

            "heading": "LIMITATIONS",
            "text": "The following limitations of the present studymust be considered in the interpretation of the results. First, the sample sizes are relatively small with unequal group sizes. Second, the KMO measure indicates that the data are only moderately suitable for the application of the factor analysis. Similarly, the values of internal consistency for the factors of pre-pandemic stress and proximal barriers are low. Therefore, further analysis for a revision of the items of the scale will be necessary.\nThe descriptive sample comparison indicates similar findings of pandemic stress burden in both samples. The differences noted between the samples can be partly attributed to clinical differences, e.g., the greater number of pre-existing traumatic experiences can be explained due to the psychotraumatologic specialization of the clinic from Sample 1. However, the overall comparability of the samples is limited due to various reasons. On the one hand, the samples differ due to the specialization of the clinics. Sample 1 consists of patients in curative care and rehabilitants in the rehabilitative care, while Clinic 2 focusses on rehabilitative care. More importantly and regarding the dynamic development of the pandemic, data were collected at different times during its course. The survey in Sample 1 was conducted at the beginning of the first lockdown. Sample 2, however, was surveyed at a time between two waves of the pandemic, where at the beginning of the survey the restrictions were eased. The survey ended with the beginning of the second national lockdown. An influence in the form of experiences with the pandemic and knowledge gained about protective measures or the expected course of the pandemic on the pandemic stress burden collected cannot be excluded.\nFurthermore, the participants reported pre-pandemic risk factors retrospectively."

            "text": "Further studies will be necessary to approach the limitations in the present study as well as a revision of the items, especially in terms of the components pre-pandemic stress and contextual factors. Yet, the advantage of the short screening is apparent: The stress barometer provides a solution to the previously existing problem of the lack of a specific instrument to assess the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to other investigations, instead of applying or revising an existing psychometric instrument, a new instrument was developed. In comparison to other newly developed subjective scales focusing on a bio-medical approach, the stress barometers specifically capture the individual pandemic impact based on the bio\u2013 psycho\u2013social model of the ICF. Hereby, the brief screening instrument meets the German obligatory requirement set by the Federal Participation Act and the Ninth Social Code to determine the need for participation based on the ICF (Art. 1, 26 BTHG in accordance with \u00a7118 SGB IX).\nInstead of offering a large test battery, the brief screening stress barometer can be applied and evaluated by different occupational groups in the health care system within a few minutes and without greater effort. Taking into consideration pre-pandemic stress as well as interactions with facilitators and barriers, the short screening gives first indications of a possible risk profile. Its advantage, therefore, lies in the immediate consideration of the therapeutic curse. Necessary therapeutic interventions (e.g., psychosocial support, conflict counseling, and mediation of government aid) can be derived based on the dominant source of pandemic stress and can be initiated in a timely manner to prevent deterioration (Eckhard et al., 2021b).\nSo far, the brief screening instrument has been mainly applied to people with pre-existing mental health conditions. Nonetheless, the scale can be suitable for the early detection of people in the general population who may be at risk. A pilot study was conducted in the social environment of students at a German university. At the present, results are not available yet, and further analysis of participants from the general population will be necessary.\nAll in all, the results indicate the suitability of a bio\u2013 psycho\u2013social approach on the measurement of pandemic stress burden. The advantage of this more-dimensional perspective lies in the assessment of pre-existing risk factors, as well as resources and inhibiting factors alongside the pandemic impact itself. By identifying the dominant sources of pandemic stress, immediate therapeutic intervention can be deduced and applied. With further analysis, the stress barometer as a brief screening instrument with an ICF-oriented approach can complement the measurement of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
