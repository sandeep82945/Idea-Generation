    "abstractText": "Most existing studies on autonomous intersection management (AIM) primarily focus on modeling and resolving conflicts between vehicles within an intersection, assuming predetermined routes of the autonomous vehicles (AVs) as exogenous inputs. Additionally, these studies presume scenarios in which AVs traverse the intersection at a constant speed without stopping. However, such scenarios are difficult to realize under heavy traffic demand. To address this issue, this study firstly discretized the intersection into numerous grids and proposed formulations to calculate the time at which the vehicles enter and exit a given grid at different speeds and accelerations based on the outer-boundary-projection dimension-reduction method. Thereafter, a bi-level programming model was established to optimize the route choices and traffic control schemes. The upper-level model aimed to minimize the conflicts within the intersection zones, considering the lane options for vehicles entering and exiting the intersection as the decision variable to optimize the AV routes. In addition, the lower-level model strived to minimize the delay for all upcoming vehicles. The time when a vehicle enters an intersection and whether it stops are utilized as decision variables. Based on the sliding time-window technique, the proposed model was transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is compiled by a mathematical programming language (AMPL) and solved by CPLEX. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed models significantly reduced the conflicts between the vehicles, and consequently, improved the space utilization of the intersection, reduced vehicle delays, and saved a significant amount of energy.

Additionally, these studies presume scenarios in which AVs traverse the intersection at a constant speed without stopping. However, such scenarios are difficult to realize under heavy traffic demand. To address this issue, this study firstly discretized the intersection into numerous grids and proposed formulations to calculate the time at which the vehicles enter and exit a given grid at different speeds and accelerations based on the outer-boundary-projection dimension-reduction method. Thereafter, a bi-level programming model was established to optimize the route choices and traffic control schemes. The upper-level model aimed to minimize the conflicts within the intersection zones, considering the lane options for vehicles entering and exiting the intersection as the decision variable to optimize the AV routes. In addition, the lower-level model strived to minimize the delay for all upcoming vehicles. The time when a vehicle enters an intersection and whether it stops are utilized as decision variables. Based on the sliding time-window technique, the proposed model was transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is compiled by a mathematical programming language (AMPL) and solved by CPLEX. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed models significantly reduced the conflicts between the vehicles, and consequently, improved the space utilization of the intersection, reduced vehicle delays, and saved a significant amount of energy.\nINDEX TERMS Autonomous intersection management (AIM), Route planning, All-direction lanes, Mixed-integer\nlinear programming(MILP), Intersection\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIntersections are widely recognized as bottlenecks of traffic flow in urban road networks [1]. In recent years, many studies have focused on traffic control at intersections, with the majority of these studies aimed at optimizing traffic signals timing scheme to improve the traffic efficiency at intersections [2]. Although intersection signal control has made significant progress in improving the safety and throughput of traffic flows, it still presents notable disadvantages that cannot be overlooked, they are listed as follows:\n1. The unpredictable and fluctuating traffic arrivals from multiple directions at intersections can lead\nto suboptimal lane and phase configurations, resulting in reduced vehicle mobility during green lights [3, 4].\n2. The duration of the time interval between two sequential green light phases at an intersection is\naffected by factors such as clearance distance, clearance speed, entering speed, and passing time of vehicles. However, the transition between\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Liu: A route planning and traffic control model for autonomous intersections\n2\nphases often results in wasted space and time resources at the intersection [5].\nConsequently, numerous researchers and urban planners have sought to enhance the traffic control methods at intersections. Recently, the advancement of autonomous driving technology has presented new challenges to traffic control, while also providing opportunities for addressing the aforementioned problems [6, 7].\nAs far as the authors know, Dresner and Stone first proposed the concept of autonomous intersection management (AIM), which involves the use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that cooperate with each other to cross intersections without the need for signal control [8, 9]. Previous studies have demonstrated that AIM can effectively address the two signal control issues mentioned earlier, thereby enhancing traffic efficiency [10, 11]. AIM can be classified into two categories, i.e., centralized and distributed. Centralized control relies on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and utilizes infrastructure/intersection managers for traffic control. In this mode, a central controller makes global decisions regarding the right-of-way for all AVs [12].\nNumerous studies have focused on centralized control strategies to improve traffic efficiency at intersections while prioritizing traffic safety. These studies aim to optimize the order and timing of vehicle entry into intersections [13, 14]. For instance, in [15] proposes a cooperative scheduling mechanism for autonomous vehicles passing through an intersection without traffic lights. The mechanism uses priority setting, window searching and trajectory planning to ensure safety and efficiency. In [16], proposes a robust autonomous intersection control (AIC) approach with global optimization scheduling and demonstrates its superiority in transportation efficiency and robustness. In [17], devised a collaborative, sequence-based control system and put forward two control strategies to determine the safe passing sequence of vehicles at intersections. The efficiency of the proposed system was confirmed via the use of microscopic simulations. In [18], created a dynamic programming model aimed at maximizing intersection throughput at signal-free intersections. In order to mitigate traffic conflicts, they proposed a stochastic look-ahead technique based on the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. [19] proposed a prioritybased, signal-free control algorithm and a discrete forward-rolling optimal control algorithm. To minimize energy consumption and maximize traffic capacity, [20] optimized vehicle routes at intersections by establishing a correlation between minimizing energy consumption and maximizing throughput. [21] proposed a two-level optimization model for vehicle scheduling and trajectory optimization, which proved to be more effective than the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method in reducing vehicle delays and fuel consumption.\nDistributed control relies on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, enabling vehicles to independently\ndevelop their optimal intersection passage plans by gathering local traffic information [22]. Specifically, it can be categorized into heuristic-based and optimizationbased control [23, 24]. For heuristic control, [25] introduced the concept of safety driving patterns, which utilizes a spanning tree to describe the solution space of allowable movement schedules with safety constraints. Accordingly, they proposed four trajectory planning algorithms and used the spanning tree to determine the driving plans with least execution times. Based on this outcome, [26] proposed a cooperative control strategy that combines Monte Carlo tree search with heuristic rules to efficiently discover a nearly globally optimal passing order for vehicles at intersections. For optimization-based control, [27] modeled the intersection control problem as a distributed computing problem of classical mutual exclusion and designed a solution algorithm accordingly. [28] proposed a decentralized coordination method that combines optimal control with model-based heuristic algorithm. [29] proposed a distributed conflict resolution mechanism to achieve realtime feasible solutions for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, [30] proposed a fully distributed control method build upon a fully distributed model predictive control approach.\nThe aforementioned studies have enabled safe and efficient passage of vehicles through intersections without signal control, with reduced traffic delays and improved traffic efficiency of the intersections. In particular, numerous research results have been reported for optimizing vehicle passing order (i.e., the sequences for vehicles entering the intersection) and the entering time. However, most existing studies assuming predetermined routes of the AVs and using them as exogenous inputs, and assume that the vehicle travels at a pre-determined speed as prescribed by the model, resulting in the following shortcomings:\n1. Most studies have only considered a few conflict points at the intersections [31, 32] and focused\non optimizing the order of vehicles entering the intersections to avoid collisions, without considering the optimization of the vehicle routes inside the intersections. However, route optimization can significantly reduce conflicts between vehicles at intersections. For example, [33] constructed a mixed-integer programming model to optimize the vehicle routes within intersections, demonstrating that optimizing the route is an efficient approach to increase traffic efficiency at intersections compared to optimizing entering time. Nonetheless, their research did not consider the optimal utilization of the intersection space, which may diminish the traffic efficiency.\n2. Most AIM studies assume that vehicles pass through intersections at a predetermined speed\nwithout stopping, which is difficult to realize in\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

To address this issue, [19] designated speed adjustment zones on the entry lane and set the stop line on the road section, where vehicles can adjust their speed before entering the intersection. Although this method can resolve the issue of vehicle acceleration inside intersections, it changes the organization of traffic flow in the intersection area, reduces the queuing space of the intersection, and is difficult to replicate in the field.\nThus, this study proposes an approach to resolve the aforementioned limitations and achieve efficient traffic flow at intersections. The contributions of the study are summarized as follows.\n1) To minimize the conflict zones, the vehicle routes inside the intersections were optimized before entering the intersections based on \u201call-direction\u201d lanes, where the entry lanes were not dedicated to certain traffic flows, i.e., an entry lane can accommodate all left turns, through passes, and right turns [34-36]. Through route planning, the utilization of space resources at intersections was enhanced, and conflicts between vehicles at the intersections were reduced.\n2) Contrary to the existing literature, which assumed that vehicles would pass the intersections at a predetermined speed without stopping [19, 26, 31, 34, 35, 37, 38], the present study takes into account the possibility of AVs halt and restart at the intersections during heavy traffic flows. By considering vehicle stoppage as an optimization decision variable, conflicts between AVs at intersections are separated, enabling the optimization of the ideal entry time for each vehicle.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The problem description is presented in Section \u2161, which intuitively expounds the key research points. The model parameters are listed in Section \u2162. The modelling procedure of the proposed model is detailed in Section \u2163, which includes the model for determining the instant at which the vehicles enter and exit the grids, route optimization model, and conflict separation model. Thereafter, the results of the model solution are discussed in Section \u2164. The model validation and the benefits of the proposed model are summarized in Section \u2165. Section \u2166 concludes this paper."

To mitigate these concerns, we have developed an optimization approach that optimizes the routes depicted in Fig. 1b. Notably, these optimized routes demonstrate a reduction in overlap.

All vehicle routes inside the intersection were determined according to multiple combinations of the entry and exit lanes in each direction.

The location points of the vehicles entering and exiting the grid may correspond to the intersection points of the grid and route boundaries or the grid vertex. Taking point A of the vehicle entering the grid and point B of the vehicle leaving the grid as an example (As shown in Fig. 2), the time and speed of the vehicle running from point A to point B are calculated. Upon entering the intersection, it is strictly forbidden for vehicles to come to a halt within the confines of the internal intersection area. It is noted that there are four scenarios of vehicle speeds when traveling from point A to B (As shown in Fig. 3). The algorithm to determine travel speed is presented in Table \u2161.\nIn the algorithm presented in Table II, the first step\ninvolves determining the intersections between vehicle\ntrajectory boundaries and grid lines. To explain this\nprocess, consider Fig. 2 as an illustrative example. Fig.\n2 illustrates the path of a left-turning vehicle within the\nintersection. The points of intersection between the\ninner trajectory boundary and grid lines are depicted in\ngreen, while those between the outer boundary and grid\nlines are designated in blue. Furthermore, the vertices\nof the grids within the trajectory's spatial domain are\ndenoted by orange points. The black points are the\nprojected points of the blue points and orange points on\nthe outer boundary trajectory, as indicated by lines 1 to\n10 in the algorithm.\nSubsequently, Line 11 in the algorithm determines\nthe entry and exit points for each grid. For instance,\ntaking the red grid in Fig. 2 as an example, the points\nwhere the trajectory enters and exits the grid are\ndenoted as points A and B, respectively. Line 12\ncalculates the distance between the entry and exit\npoints, denoted as |AB|, which depends on whether the\nvehicle follows a turning path, where |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35| = \u222b \u221a1 + \ud835\udc66\u2032(\ud835\udc65)2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc54\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 , or a straight path, where\n|\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35| = \u221a[(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc54\uff0d\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc54)2 + (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc54\uff0d\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc54)2] . By\ncalculating the time and velocity at which the vehicle\npasses point B, we can determine the time and velocity\nat which the vehicle exits the red grid.\nIt is noteworthy that vehicles may need to accelerate\nwithin the intersection, so it is required to ascertain if\nthere is acceleration within segment AB. This\ndetermination is guided by the velocity-time graph, as\nillustrated in Fig. 3, which exhibits four possible cases:\nacceleration followed by constant velocity (as\nillustrated in cases 3 and 4 in Fig. 3), constant speed\nmotion (as shown in case 1 in Fig. 3), and uniformly\naccelerated motion (as depicted in case 2 in Fig. 3).\nThe evaluation of acceleration in segment AB begins\nby examining whether the vehicle's velocity at point A,\ndenoted as \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 , equals to the maximum allowable speed, \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40. If \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40, it indicates that the vehicle\ntravels at a constant speed throughout AB, as displayed\nin case 1 in Fig. 3. If \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 < \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40 , traveling at a constant acceleration with an initial velocity of \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 and an acceleration of \ud835\udc4e until reaching \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40 covers a distance of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40 2\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 2\n2\u2219\ud835\udc4e . This distance is compared with\n|\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35| and |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35| + \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50.

When \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40\n2\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 2\n2\u2219\ud835\udc4e < |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35|, it indicates\nthat the vehicle has already reached its maximum speed\nbefore arriving at point B, as demonstrated in case 3 in\nFig. 3. Due to the consideration of the vehicle's length,\ndenoted as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50 , the velocity of the vehicle's front reaching point B and the velocity of its rear leaving\npoint B are different. When |\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35| \u2264 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40\n2\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc34 2\n2\u2219\ud835\udc4e <\n|\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35| + \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50 , it indicates that the vehicle's front end reaches point B without attaining maximum speed,\nwhile the rear end achieves the maximum speed upon\ndeparting from point B. As illustrated in case 4 in Fig.\n3.

The vehicle routes at the intersections were determined using both the entry and exit lanes. As each entry may turn left, right, or travel straight, the vehicles can choose from several route choices available at the intersections. Considering the intersection of an eight-lane bi-directional road as an example (as shown in Fig. 4), there are 16 potential routes for vehicles turning left in the east approaching direction, with the curve representing the centerline of the vehicle's turning route. The grid for each route can be calculated using the method described in Section \u2163-A. Importantly, the location and size of the conflict zone generated at the intersection will vary depending on the routes selected by vehicles to cross the intersection.\nN\nFIGURE 4. Optional routes for left-turning vehicles at east\napproaching direction\nTo minimize conflicts and improve utilization of the internal intersection zone, we optimized vehicle routes by optimizing the entry and exit lanes. By discretizing the internal intersection zone, we reformulated the issue of conflicts between vehicles at the intersection into the problem of vehicles occupying specific grids. Our objective was to optimize the lanes for vehicles entering and exiting the intersection in order to minimize the number of vehicles occupying the grids. The modeling procedure is detailed as follows:\nVehicles can select only one route to pass the intersection, as expressed in Equation (1) :\n\u2211 \ud835\udef7\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\u2208\ud835\udc45 = 1 \u2200\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b, (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b is the set of vehicles in the \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\u210e time window., \ud835\udc5f is a route, \ud835\udc5f \u2208 \ud835\udc45, \ud835\udc45 is the set of all routes, and \ud835\udef7\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f is a binary variable indicating whether vehicle \ud835\udc56 passes the intersection along route \ud835\udc5f . If \ud835\udef7\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f = 1 , vehicle \ud835\udc56 passes the intersection from route \ud835\udc5f otherwise, \ud835\udef7\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f = 0.\nThe entry lane selected by the vehicle is represented as \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\u2032, whereas the selected exit lane is denoted as \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56\u2032. Thus, the selected entry and exit lanes can be determined according to the numbering of the selected route and that of the corresponding entry and exit lanes of each route, as expressed in Equations (2)-(3):\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56 \u2032 = \u2211 (\ud835\udef7\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f \u2219 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f)\ud835\udc5f\u2208\ud835\udc45 \u2200\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b (2) \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 \u2032 = \u2211 (\ud835\udef7\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f \u2219 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f)\ud835\udc5f\u2208\ud835\udc45 \u2200\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b, (3)\nwhere \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f and \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f is the numbering of the entry and exit lanes corresponding to route \ud835\udc5f, respectively.\nThe grids comprising each route were determined using the method described in Section \u2163-A, where \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5f denotes a binary variable.

In case \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 = 1 , vehicle \ud835\udc56 passes through grid \ud835\udc54 otherwise, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 = 0.\nEach grid may be used by multiple vehicles. The total number \ud835\udefa\ud835\udc54 of vehicles clear grid \ud835\udc54 at any given time is calculated using Equation (5):\n\ud835\udefa\ud835\udc54 = \u2211 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b \u2200\ud835\udc54 \u2208 \ud835\udc3a (5)\nThe number of vehicles in the most frequently used grid is calculated using Equation (6):\n\ud835\udefa = \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc54\u2208\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udefa\ud835\udc54 (6)\nwhere \u03a9 is the number of vehicles in the most occupied grid.\nIn [22], a centralized and coordinated method for intersection control is proposed, aiming to minimize the overall length of overlapping vehicle trajectories however, it does not optimize the routes of vehicles within the intersection. Upon discretizing the internal zone of the intersection into multiple grids, the traversal routes of vehicles inside the intersection can be expressed as a series of grids. In this study, we present a novel approach of route overlap planning, whereby the problem is reframed as a determination of the number of vehicles clearing each grid. By minimizing the number of vehicles clear each grid, we aim to reduce the overlap of routes at intersections, which in turn ensures minimal conflict between vehicles. The optimization objective of the route planning model is expressed as Equation (7):\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc54\u2208\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udefa\ud835\udc54) (7)\nC Traffic control model\nAlthough the route optimization model effectively\nminimizes conflicts between vehicles at intersections, however, achieving complete separation of all potential conflicts requires further optimization of the sequencing and timing of vehicle entry as determined by the lowerlevel traffic control model. The traffic control model takes the results of route optimization from section IV-B as input and optimizes the times of vehicle entry into the intersection with the aim of minimizing total vehicle delay. This model is subject to three primary constraints: the intersection arrival time constraint, the grid entering and exiting time constraint, and the conflict separation constraint.\nIntersection arrival time constraints: Considering the operation of vehicles, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032, the instant at which vehicles actually enter the intersection, is not less than \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032 , the instant at which the vehicles actually arrive at the intersection, and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032 is not less than \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 , the instant at which the vehicle planed arrives at the intersection. The\nconstraint is expressed in Equation (8):\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 \u2265 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032 \u2265 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2200 \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c. (8)\nThere are two scenarios for vehicles: those that come to a stop before entering the intersection and those that do not. If the vehicle stops before entering the intersection, the actual time the vehicle entering the intersection is greater than the planed time of its arrival at the intersection, i.e., \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 > \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 otherwise, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\n\u2032\u2032 = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 . The relationship between \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 is expressed in Equation (9):\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udf0c 0,\ud835\udc56 = 1 \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 > \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 . (9)\nBy linearizing Equation (9), the instants of the vehicle actually entering the intersection and planned arriving at the intersection should satisfy the following equations:(10)-(11)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 > \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc40 \u2219 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0c0,\ud835\udc56) \u2200 \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c (10) \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 \u2264 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc40 \u2219 \ud835\udf0c0,\ud835\udc56 \u2200 \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c. (11)\nGrid entering and exiting time constraint: The timespan between the entry and exit of the vehicle from the grid can be determined based on the time \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 when the vehicle enters the intersection, and the time required by the vehicle to cross the intersection, where \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 is the decision variable of the traffic control model. The time at which the vehicle passes any grid on the route has been calculated in Section \u2163-A. The time \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 at which the vehicle enters the grid should follow the conditions expressed in Equations (12)-(13):\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2265 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 + \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc63 \u2219\u2219 \ud835\udf0c0,\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc401 \u2219 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54), (12)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2264 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 + \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc63 \u2219 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63,\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc401 \u2219 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54). (13)\nThe time \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2032 at which the vehicle exits the grid should suffice the conditions presented in Equation (14)-(15):\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2032 \u2265 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 + \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc63 \u2032 \u2219 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63,\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc401 \u2219 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54), (14)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2032 \u2264 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 + \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc63 \u2032 \u2219 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63,\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc401 \u2219 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54), (15)\nwhere \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc63 and \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc54,\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc63 \u2032 is the time at which the front of the vehicle \ud835\udc56 enters grid \ud835\udc54 and the time at which the tail of vehicle \ud835\udc56 exits grid \ud835\udc54 after the vehicle enters the intersection, respectively.\nTo address the complexity associated with\ncalculating the time of a vehicle entering and leaving an intersection due to the continuous nature of vehicle speeds, it is necessary to discretize the speed variable. This discretization restricts the vehicle's options for entering the intersection to a finite set. The vehicle can only select a certain speed to enter the intersection. The constraint is expressed in Equation (16).\n\u2211 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc63,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\u2208\ud835\udc49 = 1 (16)\nWhere, \ud835\udc49 represent the set of discretized speeds, i.e., \ud835\udc49 = {0, \u2026 , \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc5a}.\nConflict separation constraint: To ensure the safe passage of vehicles at intersections, prior studies have assumed that each grid can be occupied by only one\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

When multiple vehicles pass through a grid two or more times, temporal separation is required to prevent collisions. To address this issue, we formed conflict sets {(\ud835\udc54, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57), \u2026 } , and then formulated constraints (17)\u2013(18) to ensure that the entry and exit times of each vehicle pair did not overlap. Notably, unlike [33], which investigated all vehicles under a discrete grid set, we only conducted conflict separation on grids traversed by two or more vehicles, thereby eliminating redundant solutions and effectively reducing the size of the solution space. The conflict separation constraint is expressed in Equations (17)\u2013(18).\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2032 \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc54 \u2264 \ud835\udc40 \u2219 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 \u2200 \ud835\udc54, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 \u2208 {(\ud835\udc54, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57), \u2026 }(17) \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc54 \u2032 \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2264 \ud835\udc40 \u2219 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57) \u2200 \ud835\udc54, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 \u2208\n{(\ud835\udc54, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57), \u2026 }, (18)\nwhere \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 is a binary variable.

The conflict set {(\ud835\udc54, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57), \u2026 } was calculated following the method described in Section \u2163-B.\nThe delay of all vehicles was calculated using Equation (19):\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3c = \u2211 (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc3c .

Therefore, the rolling time window method is used [31]. Specifically, we segmented various time windows based on the arrival times of vehicles at the intersection to optimize their routes and entry times. If the entry time of any vehicle in the subsequent time window is later than or equal to the latest exit time for all vehicles in the previous time window, we must satisfy the conditions outlined in Equation (21):\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc54 \u2265 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\n{\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2032 } \u2219 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc54 \u2200 \ud835\udc54 \u2208 \ud835\udc3a, \ud835\udc58 \u2208 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b+1, (21)\nwhere \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b is the set of vehicles in the \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\u210e time window.\nThe upper- and lower-level models were both mixedinteger linear programming models that can be solved using the branch and bound method.

            "text": "In this Section, we selected the intersection of Fu rong Road and Ying pan Road in Changsha, China, which encompasses eight lanes in each direction and allows bidirectional traffic flow. Fig. 5 illustrates that the entry and exit lanes in all directions of the intersection were clearly numbered, each with a width of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc59 = 3.5\ud835\udc5a . Grid granularity significantly impacts intersection efficiency [40]. The grid\u2019s side length should not be set to very large, e.g., if the whole intersection is taken as a single grid, this means only one vehicle can be inside the intersection at a time, which would certainly cause massive efficiency losses. Therefore, in order to take better advantage of the space inside the intersection, the side length of a grid is better shorter than the vehicle length and lager than zero. However, smaller side length corresponding to more numbers of girds, and because all the conflicts on each gird should be avoided, more numbers of girds lead to more computational time. By following Wu et al. (2022), the grid dimension is set to 3.5m * 3.5m in this study. The vehicles involved in this study had a length of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50 = 4.5\ud835\udc5a and a maximum speed of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc40 = 16.7 m/s (60km/h) when passing through the intersection. To ensure passenger comfort, the maximum acceleration of the AV was limited to \ud835\udc4e = 2.5 \ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc602 . The arrival of vehicles at the intersection followed the Poisson distribution. The average time headway per entrance lane between two successive vehicles is 3.75 seconds, which is equivalent to 960 vehicles per hour per entrance lane. Given that there are 16 entrance lanes, the average arrival rate at the intersection is approximately 4.27 vehicles per second.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The layout of the intersection\nBased on the planed arrival time, we categorized the vehicles into time windows of 10 seconds [33]. The proposed model utilized a desktop computer equipped with a Windows 10 (64-bit) system, featuring an Intel (R) CoreTM i5-9400F processor clocked at 2.90 GHz and 8 GB of memory. To ensure the efficiency of solving, we set the maximum solving time at 10 seconds, i.e., if the optimal solution cannot be obtained within 10 seconds, the solver will return the best feasible solution derived within 10 seconds.\nIn this study, the global optimization (GO) model optimized the vehicle routes, the order and the time of entering the intersection. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, we have developed several comparison models to use in our analysis.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of the route optimization, we utilized the global optimum method without route choices (GO-WR) as the comparison model. Unlike the proposed model, GO-WR did not optimize the vehicle routes at the intersection. Instead, it focused on optimizing the timing of the vehicles entering the intersection. The route was determined based on the initial entry and exit lanes provided as inputs.\nIn addition, we employed the first-come-first-served with optimal route choices (FCFS-R) method to compare the effects of optimizing the time of vehicles entering the intersection. The FCFS-R model used the same optimization method for vehicle routes inside the intersection as the proposed model. However, the order of vehicles entering the intersection followed the first-comefirst-serve rule, meaning that the vehicles entered the intersection according to the sequence of their arrival, and the time of vehicles entering the intersection was not optimized.\nThe application of the GO model effectively reduced the number of conflicts between vehicles in each time window when compared to the GO-WR model. As illustrated in Fig. 6, during the first, second, and third time windows, the GO-WR model recorded 2,237, 1,940, and\n2,363 conflicts, respectively. In contrast, with GO model, the conflicts reduced to 865, 908, and 906, respectively, which represents a significant decrease of 61.33%, 53.2%, and 61.66%, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in reducing the conflicts between vehicles at intersections.\nIn addition, the time at which the vehicles entered the\nintersection was recorded to determine the delay\nexperienced by the vehicles passing through the\nintersection in each time window. The delay comparison\nis illustrated in Fig. 7.\nThree conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in Fig. 7. First, It can be observed that the blue box corresponding to the GO model results occupied the lowest position and spanned the shortest length compared to those of the GO-WR and FCFS-R models. This indicates that the GO model has shorter delay. Second, the average vehicle delay in the GO model for the three time windows was 1.79s, 4.32s, and 6.71 s, respectively, while that in the GO-WR model was 6.99s, 14.18s, and 21.80 s, respectively. Compared with the GO-WR model, the average vehicle delay in the GO model was reduced by 74.43%, 69.51%, and 69.22%, respectively. This suggests that minimizing the number of vehicles clearing grid can optimize the vehicle trajectory, reduce conflicts between vehicles, thus effectively reducing vehicle delay. Finally, the average vehicle delay of the FCFS-R model for the\nW E\nS\nN\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1 2 3 41234\n1 2 3 41234\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56\n57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\nAll-direction lanes\nConflict area\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Liu: A route planning and traffic control model for autonomous intersections\n11\nthree time windows was 10.06s , 19.79s, and 32.91s s, which further reduced the average vehicle delay of the GO model by 82.22%, 78.16%, and 79.61%, respectively. This finding indicates that optimizing the time of the vehicles entering the intersection can significantly reduce vehicle delay. The number of stops before the vehicle entering the intersection is shown in Fig. 8.\nAccording to Fig. 8, there is a significant decrease in the total number of the vehicle stops in the proposed model across different time windows. Specifically, in comparison to the GO-WR model, the GO model demonstrated a reduction of 4.35%, 40.54%, and 44.44% in the total number of stops, respectively. Additionally, when compared with FCFS-R, the GO model exhibited a decrease of 51.22%, 12.20%, and 12.20%, respectively. The time spent by vehicles crossing intersection is shown in Fig. 9.\nFig. 9 revealed that the time spent by vehicles crossing intersection in the GO model was significantly shorter than those in the GO-WR and FCFS-R models. During the three time windows, the GO model resulted in average occupation times of 2.83s, 2.75s, and 3.41s, respectively, while the corresponding values for the GO-WR model were 3.32s, 3.87s, and 4.20s , respectively. This results in a reduction of 14.74%, 29.01%, and 18.72% in average occupation time when comparing GO and GO-WR. Moreover, the average occupation time in FCFS-R was 3.39s, 3.58s, and 3.60s, respectively, which is longer than that of the GO model by 16.53%, 23.22%, and 5.28%, respectively.\nThe results indicate that optimizing vehicle routes and the time of entering the intersection can significantly reduce the time spent by vehicles crossing intersection. This is due to optimized routes and reduced travel time, resulting in fewer vehicle conflicts and less frequent stops by vehicles at the intersection. The average speed of vehicles traveling through the intersection increases, and time spent inside the intersection is decreased.\nFig. 10 presents the vehicle count clear each grid at the intersection, which shows a more evenly distributed conflict distribution among the vehicles following the vehicle route optimization approach. Notably, the proposed approach resulted in a significant reduction in the number of vehicles clear each grid. For instance, during time window 1, the maximum number of vehicles clear a single grid in the model was seven, while in the comparison model without route optimization, 15 vehicles passed through a same grid. This result suggests that the vehicle route optimization approach promotes a more equitable distribution of spatial resource utilization at the intersection.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

While this study incorporates vehicle size and represents their trajectories using enclosed regions defined by inner and outer boundaries, the figure portrays the centerline of the trajectories for clarity purposes. From the Fig. 11, it is evident that the first-come-first-served with optimal route choices (FCFS-R) model, which does not optimize vehicles\u2019 routes within the intersection, results in chaotic vehicle trajectories with numerous instances of trajectory\ncrossings. However, by employing the proposed model, a more structured distribution of trajectories is achieved.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, in different time windows, the predominant behavior observed in vehicle trajectories can be summarized as follows: the majority of left-turning vehicles tend to opt for inner lanes, exemplified by Lane 1 or Lane 2 in Figure 5, while right-turning vehicles typically prefer outer lanes, such as Lane 3 or Lane 4 in Figure 5. Specifically, within the time windows, left-\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Liu: A route planning and traffic control model for autonomous intersections\n13\nturning vehicles displayed a distribution of 16.7%, 25%, and 25% for selecting Entrance Lanes 3 or Lanes 4, respectively. Meanwhile, right-turning vehicles exhibited proportions of 8.33%, 16.67%, and 15.38% for choosing Entrance Lanes 1 or Lanes 2 in the respective time windows. On the other hand, the selection of entrance lanes by through-traffic vehicles did not demonstrate a discernible pattern. The analysis of the vehicle's choice of exit lane shows that within the different time windows, the proportion of vehicles following a circular turning trajectory is 75.00%, 95.83%, and 88.00%, respectively. Furthermore, all straight trajectories parallel to the x-axis or y-axis.\nAs demonstrated by the analysis presented above, our proposed model has exhibited a significant reduction in both vehicle conflicts and delays. Given the transportation industry's increasing concern with energy consumption and pollutant emissions, considerable efforts have been made towards traffic control systems\nthat prioritize energy conservation and emission reduction [41]. In line with this, we have evaluated the energy consumption and pollutant emissions of vehicles passing through intersections, utilizing the fuel consumption model to determine the impact of our proposed model on these factors. Specifically, we have employed the VT-Micro model, which efficiently calculates fuel consumption and emissions of carbon oxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX), and carbon hydride (HC) based on vehicle speed and acceleration, as outlined in Equations (21)-(22). The regression coefficient values for these equations are detailed in Appendix I, and Fig. 12 presents the calculated fuel consumption and emissions of CO, HC, and NOX for all vehicles across the three time windows.\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 = \u2211 exp(\u2211 \u2211 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc523 \ud835\udc57=0 3 \ud835\udc56=0 \u2219 \ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc56 \u2219\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc61=0 \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc57) /3.6, \ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 (22)\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 = \u2211 exp(\u2211 \u2211 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc523 \ud835\udc57=0 3 \ud835\udc56=0 \u2219 \ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc56 \u2219\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc61=0 \ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc57) , \u2200\ud835\udc52 \u2208 {\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42, \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc65} (23)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

This feature allows for a more versatile and efficient use of the available space, enhancing the overall performance of the intersection. As the location and dimensions of the conflict zones differ for each route, optimizing vehicle routes at the intersection can be instrumental in reducing traffic conflicts and enhancing traffic efficiency. By customizing routes planning for each vehicle, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of conflicts and promote a more streamlined flow of traffic at the intersection. Most existing AIM models adopt predetermined routes for AVs and treat them as exogenous inputs, directing attention towards conflicts that arise at intersections. Additionally, these models assume a constant speed for AVs and neglect the possibility of stops during intersection traversal. However, this is not practically possible in case of heavy traffic flow.\nThe present study establish a time calculation model for vehicles entering and exiting an intersection grid, enabling accurate estimation of traversal time for vehicles crossing the grids of the intersection. Second, a bi-level programming model is proposed in this study, which involves an upper-level model for optimizing vehicle routes at intersections and a lower-level model for optimizing entry time of vehicles, thereby mitigating potential conflicts between them. The model was solved using Python and AMPL. The outcomes of our study demonstrate that, by route optimization, the number of conflicts between vehicles reduced significantly. This impressive decrease of over 50% stands in stark contrast to the GO-WR model which without route optimization. The results suggest that the proposed model is effective in optimizing travel routes for vehicles at intersections.\nFurthermore, the optimization ensures a more uniform distribution of conflict points within the intersection, ultimately leading to an improved utilization of space resources at intersections. In comparison to the GO-WR model, the proposed route optimization model results in a significant reduction of vehicle delay, ranging between 69-74%. The model reduces the number of stopping vehicles by 4-44%, and reduces the time spent by vehicles crossing intersection by 14-29%. Notably, the proposed model enables evaluation of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions during vehicle operation based on trajectory data, resulting in a mean reduction of 35-68%. These findings confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.More importantly, the model is capable of reducing the fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of vehicles while reducing vehicle delay and improving the traffic efficiency at intersections.\nMoreover, the present study offers potential avenues for further research, including but not limited to the following zones: First, future research may consider the formation of vehicle platoon for modeling and optimization, as demonstrated in previous studies [42]. Furthermore, it may be worthwhile to investigate scenarios that involve both pedestrians and AVs simultaneously [43]. Additionally, developing a simulation platform to validate the control effect of the proposed model can also be further expanded in the following studies[44]. Finally, we can consider employing a distributed traffic control approach, where each autonomous vehicle can independently plan and adjust its trajectory in real-time [45]. This could involve designing an entirely new traffic control strategy for autonomous vehicles at intersections.\nAppendix I: Parameters of regression coefficient\nTABLE \u2164\nREGRESSION COEFFICIENTS IN THE FUEL CONSUMPTION MODEL\nParameters Fuel CO HC NOx\n\ud835\udc580,0 \ud835\udc34 \u22120.679439 0.887447 \u22120.728042 \u22121.067682 \ud835\udc580,1 \ud835\udc34 0.135273 0.148841 0.012211 0.254363 \ud835\udc580,2 \ud835\udc34 0.015946 0.03055 0.023371 0.008866 \ud835\udc580,3 \ud835\udc34 \u22120.001189 \u22120.001348 \u22120.000093243 \u22120.000951 \ud835\udc581,0 \ud835\udc34 0.029665 0.070994 0.02495 0.046423 \ud835\udc581,1 \ud835\udc34 0.004808 0.00387 0.010145 0.015482 \ud835\udc581,2 \ud835\udc34 \u22120.000020535 0.000093228 \u22120.000103 \u22120.000131 \ud835\udc581,3 \ud835\udc34 5.5409285E-8 \u22120.000000706 0.000000618 0.000000328 \ud835\udc582,0 \ud835\udc34 \u22120.000276 \u22120.000786 \u22120.000205 \u22120.000173 \ud835\udc582,1 \ud835\udc34 0.000083329 \u22120.000926 \u22120.000549 0.002876 \ud835\udc582,2 \ud835\udc34 0.000000937 0.000049181 0.000037592 \u22120.00005866 \ud835\udc582,3 \ud835\udc34 \u22122.479644E-8 \u22120.000000314 \u22120.000000213 0.00000024 \ud835\udc583,0 \ud835\udc34 0.000001487 0.000004616 0.000001949 0.000000569 \ud835\udc583,1 \ud835\udc34 \u22120.000061321 0.000046144 \u22120.000113 \u22120.000321 \ud835\udc583,2 \ud835\udc34 0.000000304 \u22120.00000141 0.00000331 0.000001943 \ud835\udc583,3 \ud835\udc34 \u22124.467234E\u20139 8.1724008E\u20139 \u22121.739372E\u20138 \u22121.257413E\u20138\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.
