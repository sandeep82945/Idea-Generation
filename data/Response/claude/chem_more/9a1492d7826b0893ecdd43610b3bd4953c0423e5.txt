 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibition by licochalcone A and licochalcone B through additional in vitro and in vivo studies. This could involve measuring incretin hormone levels, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance in animal models. 

2. Investigate the effects of licochalcone A and B on other therapeutic targets relevant to type 2 diabetes, such as alpha-glucosidase, PPAR-gamma, GLUT4 translocation, etc. 

3. Evaluate the antidiabetic efficacy and safety of licochalcone A and B in animal models of type 2 diabetes, including studies on bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.

4. Explore the synergistic effects of combining licochalcone A and B with other antidiabetic agents like metformin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors etc. This could lead to potential combination therapies. 

5. Perform structure-activity relationship studies on licochalcone A and B to identify structural analogs with improved DPP-4 inhibitory activity and drug-like properties. This can aid in lead optimization and drug development.
