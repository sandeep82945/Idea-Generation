    "abstractText": "In order to develop chemical kinetics models for the combustion of ionic liquid-based monopropellants, identification of the elementary steps in the thermal and catalytic decomposition of components such as 2-hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate (HEHN) is needed, but is currently not well understood. The first decomposition step in protic ionic liquids such as HEHN is typically the proton transfer from the cation to the anion, resulting in the formation of 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HEH) and HNO3. In the first part of this investigation, the high temperature thermal decomposition of HEH is probed with flash pyrolysis (<1400 K) and vacuum ultraviolet (10.45 eV) photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (VUV-PITOFMS). Next, the investigation into the thermal and catalytic decomposition of HEHN includes two mass spectrometric techniques: 1) tunable VUV-PI-TOFMS (7.4-15 eV) and 2) ambient ionization mass spectrometry utilizing both plasma and laser ionization techniques whereby HEHN is introduced onto a heated inert or iridium catalytic surface and the products are probed. The products can be identified by their masses, their ionization energies, and their collision-induced fragmentation patterns. Formation of product species indicate that catalytic surface recombination is an important reaction process in the decomposition mechanism of HEHN. The products and their possible elementary reaction mechanisms are discussed. * Email: ghsanshyam.vaghjiani@us.af.mil; Tel 661-275-5657; Fax: 661-275-5471.",

The first decomposition step in protic ionic liquids such as HEHN is typically the proton transfer from the cation to the anion, resulting in the formation of 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HEH) and HNO3. In the first part of this investigation, the high temperature thermal decomposition of HEH is probed with flash pyrolysis (<1400 K) and vacuum ultraviolet (10.45 eV) photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (VUV-PITOFMS). Next, the investigation into the thermal and catalytic decomposition of HEHN includes two mass spectrometric techniques: 1) tunable VUV-PI-TOFMS (7.4-15 eV) and 2) ambient ionization mass spectrometry utilizing both plasma and laser ionization techniques whereby HEHN is introduced onto a heated inert or iridium catalytic surface and the products are probed. The products can be identified by their masses, their ionization energies, and their collision-induced fragmentation patterns. Formation of product species indicate that catalytic surface recombination is an important reaction process in the decomposition mechanism of HEHN. The products and their possible elementary reaction mechanisms are discussed.\n* Email: ghsanshyam.vaghjiani@us.af.mil; Tel 661-275-5657; Fax: 661-275-5471."

            "text": "The application of energetic materials based on room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs)\ncontinues to provide an important strategy to develop new monopropellants that can provide enhanced performance capabilities compared to the current state-of-the-art baseline system, which is hydrazine (N2H4). 1 Furthermore, the strong Coulombic bonding present in these ionic materials imparts a very low vapor pressure.2 Consequently, their handling does not require the precautions and safety protocols associated with the highly toxic hydrazine. However, reliable ignition and sustained combustion of these energetic materials presents a major challenge, as washout (flame quenching) can be a major concern.3 Therefore, in order to fully utilize the available energy release of these RTIL monopropellants, the ignition and combustion behaviors of these materials need to be characterized. This information is required to construct detailed chemical ignition and combustion models that would facilitate in the design and evaluation of the combustion chamber configuration for a given thruster application. In order to have reliable, sustained ignition in high-energy density fuels, it is necessary to control the conditions that will lead to flammable gas mixtures and to avoid conditions and thruster geometries leading to instabilities in the flame that can cause washout. Ignition leading to sustained combustion occurs when sufficient amount of heat is released into a gas mixture within the proper flammability limits.4\nThe substantially higher adiabatic flame temperatures of these fuels (typically > 1800 oC)\nand the corrosive nature of the combustion products (e.g., HNO3, super-heated steam, and CO2) present a particular difficulty in high-temperature material design that can withstand the extreme thermochemical environment during ignition and combustion of these monopropellants.5 While ignition is exclusively a gas-phase phenomenon that can be described by chemical kinetics and\nflammability limit models,4 there are condensed-phase homogeneous and heterogeneous processes that produce the gaseous species that contribute to ignition.6-11 Although many physical and thermodynamic properties of materials are now being predicted theoretically with reasonable reliability using molecular dynamics and quantum chemical ab initio computations,1213 the same is not true for a priori prediction of their chemical reactivity. This is because, often, detailed mechanistic information on the transient and dynamical behavior of the system is lacking. Therefore, an important goal of our research is to use sensitive and selective experimental probes to understand at the molecular level the underlying chemistry involved under relevant extreme environments. Molecular level studies of the interfacial reaction chemistry are key to the development and improvement of theoretical models for catalytic ignition.\nVacuum ultraviolet-photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (VUV-PI-TOFMS),\nnanotip ambient ionization mass spectrometry (NAIMS)14 and laser desorption/ionization droplet delivery mass spectrometry (LDIDD-MS)15 provide the necessary experimental sensitivity and are used in this effort to investigate the thermal and catalytic reaction mechanisms. This experimental data intends to serve to guide an ab initio quantum chemical effort, yielding accurate reaction energetics and rate coefficients for the proposed catalytic reactions. This information will feed into chemical kinetics/multiphysics models that will make ignition predictions possible in high-temperature catalytic systems. This capability will lead to improved design of propellant formulations and catalysts resulting in sustained combustion and reliable propulsive thrust that could lead to the extension of thruster lifetimes.\nWhile N2H4 is a single species fuel, high-energy density ionic liquid monopropellants\nconsist of both the fuel (cation) and oxidizer (anion) constituents also containing O and C atoms\nthat can greatly complicate the ignition and combustion reaction mechanisms versus N2H4. The ignition mechanism of N2H4 involves both catalytic decomposition of N2H4 on iridium 16-17 and homo- and heterogeneous thermal decomposition of N2H4 prior to ignition. 18-20 Recent studies have shown that in the catalysis of N2H4 with iridium, the interaction of the nitrogen lone pair with the Ir initiates N2H4 chemisorption and the formation of mixed nitrides on the Ir surface, which react further to lead to NH3 and H2 as final products. 21 These catalytic and thermolytic decomposition products can then directly compete with N2H4 for reactive sites on the Ir. To our knowledge, the identities of the initial complexed species for 2-hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate (HEHN) on iridium have not been determined previously. Thermal decomposition of HEHN has been studied by Chowdhury and Thynell using confined rapid thermolysis (CRT),22 and more recently by Esparza and co-workers by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.20 These studies have both shown that the primary step in the decomposition reaction is the proton transfer from the hydroxyethylhydrazinium cation to the nitrate anion to produce 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HEH) and HNO3. Based on the evolution profiles of products such as NH3, H2O, N2, NO, CO2, N2O, NO2, etc. coupled with kinetic modeling, the models indicate that the subsequent reactions are likely autocatalytic with HNO3. 20 In the CRT work, the proposed reaction scheme included three reaction steps; the first two being proton transfer and a subsequent reaction of HEH with HNO3 produced in the first step, where the third step was a global reaction with fractional stoichiometric values. In the TGA work, a heterogeneous reaction pathway for the production of NH3 and ethanolamine was proposed. Both studies yielded effective decomposition rate parameters that could be useful for simple kinetic modeling of HEHN chemistry. Here, one objective is to identify elementary reaction steps not previously proposed in the initial thermal\nand catalytic decomposition mechanism to develop an improved decomposition mechanism for HEHN. In order to understand the chemical processes involved when HEH and HEHN are thermally decomposed and catalytically decomposed on iridium surfaces, the structure of this paper is broken down as follows: 1) the unimolecular thermal decomposition of HEH by flash pyrolysis (Section 4A), 2) the thermal and catalytic decomposition of liquid HEHN using an effusive source with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time of flight mass spectrometry (VUVPI-TOFMS, Section 4B), 3) the thermal and catalytic decomposition of aerosol beams of HEH and HEHN via VUV-PI-TOFMS (Section 4C), 4) catalytic decomposition of HEHN via nanotip ambient ionization mass spectrometry (NAIMS, Section 4D), and 5) catalytic decomposition of HEHN via laser desorption/ionization droplet delivery mass spectrometry (LDIDD-MS, Section 4E)."

(> 98% purity) and was used without further purification. HEH was introduced by bubbling He (P = 1.5 atm) through the liquid at elevated temperature to control the vapor pressure. The bubbler bath temperature for HEH was T=60 \u00b0C and the vapor pressure of HEH was estimated to be Pvap = 100 mTorr, and\nthe concentration for HEH was low enough to avoid secondary reactions of the HEH and decomposition products in the source. Similarly, ethanol was introduced in a separate experiment with the bubbler bath temperature at T=0 \u00b0C. Flash pyrolysis was achieved by expanding the gas mixture through a heated SiC nozzle (Carborundum, heated length 10 mm, 2 mm o.d., 1 mm i.d.). The nozzle was heated resistively with the electrical current being controlled by a Variac transformer. The nozzle temperature was monitored by a type C (Omega) thermocouple attached to the outside of the nozzle that had previously been calibrated to the internal temperature of the nozzle. With a near sonic velocity of the sample within the nozzle, the residence time in the heater has been estimated to be approximately 50 s.23, 37 After leaving\nthe nozzle, products were cooled and isolated by supersonic expansion into vacuum where they proceeded through a skimmer to the photoionization region.\nThe parent molecules and products were ionized by 118.2-nm (10.5-eV) photons produced\nby frequency tripling the 354.7-nm output of a Nd:YAG laser in a Xe cell (20 Torr) and were subsequently detected by a linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer (R. M. Jordan Co.). The 118.2- nm radiation was focused by an MgF2 lens through a small aperture into the photoionization zone, while the fundamental 354.7-nm beam diverged in this region. This divergence and the aperture minimized multiphoton ionization (MPI) and the amount of scattered 354.7-nm radiation within the ionization region. The TOF spectra were collected using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS3032) and averaged over 512 laser shots; they were then converted to mass spectra using the appropriate Jacobian transformation."

The present experimental IL effusive source setup is a modification of a setup used previously,28-32 and used successfully in ref.33 It uses a new, smaller effusive IL source that is mounted directly onto the repeller plate of the mass spectrometer ion optics; a pinhole in the repeller plate introduces the HEHN decomposition product vapor into the ionization region. This new configuration increases the IL product vapor number density in the ionization region by approximately 250 times versus the previous setup. The IL effusive source was maintained between 373 and 473 K, initially with only the pure IL, and subsequently with the IL and a small amount of Ir catalyst added to the glass sample holder in order to compare thermal decomposition versus catalytic decomposition products. The HEHN sample (generated in-house at AFRL, purity > 98%, GC/MS) was loaded into the source, mounted into the vacuum chamber, pumped to <10\u22127 Torr, and degassed for 12 h at 298 K, prior to carrying out the pure IL photoionization measurements. After the pure IL experiment, the vacuum chamber was vented, a new sample of HEHN and an Ir catalyst granule were introduced into the glass sample container, and the vacuum chamber was pumped down to <10\u22127 Torr, and degassed for 4 h at 298 K. The ambient pressure in the interaction vacuum chamber during operation does not exceed 1 \u00d7 10-7 Torr (1.33 \u00d7 10-5 Pa).\nThermal decomposition of HEHN using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that a 10% mass loss is achieved at 423 K at a heating rate of 1 K/min.20 Here, it is assumed that HEHN has negligible thermal decomposition at 373 K and significant thermal decomposition at 473 K for this experiment.\nThe mass spectra and ion yield are measured with a pulsed TOF mass spectrometer38 and\nare recorded as a function of wavelength, tunable between 7.4 and 15.0 eV in 100 meV steps.\nAbsolute photon energy calibration and monochromator resolution (VUV line width was 0.023 eV, fwhm) were determined using the atomic absorption line spectrum of an argon gas filter located between the light source and beamline 9.0.2.3 end station and used to prevent higher harmonics of the desired photon energies to be transmitted to the end station. At each photon energy setting, 500,000 mass spectra were collected before moving the undulator and monochromator to the next photon energy setting. The ALS was maintained at a constant electron current of 500 mA using top off mode. The relative photon flux was monitored with a calibrated photodiode and is used to normalize the relative ion yields taken at different photon energies. Typical ion yields at \u223c9.3 eV photon energies are on the order of hundreds up to a few thousands of ions/sec, depending on the photon flux, whereas the typical background signal at mass peaks of interest was <1 count/sec."

Generated liquid droplets are then entrained in a nitrogen carrier gas at 10 psi and are dried by passing through a 1-meter long silica gel diffusion dryer tube. Due to the increased vapor pressure of HEH, no HEH aerosols were detected using the drying tube (mentioned for HEHN above), and so for the case of generating HEH aerosols, the HEH aerosol flow was directly introduced into the aerosol mass spectrometer, and the presence of H2O in the\nHEH aerosols was determined to not affect the HEH thermal and catalytic decomposition chemistry. A portion of the aerosol flow was diverted to the SMPS. The aerosol particle size distribution and number density were measured with an SMPS consisting of a commercial differential mobility analyzer (DMA; TSI model 3081) coupled to a condensation particle counter (CPC; TSI model 3772). Aerosol particles of HEHN produced in our experiment have a median diameter of 81 \u00b1 3 nm and a total concentration of 4.3 x 106 particles/cm3, while similarly produced aerosol particles of HEH have a median diameter of 173 \u00b1 11 nm and a total concentration of 1.2 x 107 particles/cm3.\nThe chemical composition of the aerosols is measured using the ATOFMS, a custom-\nbuilt, soft-ionization vacuum ultraviolet aerosol mass spectrometer described by Gloaguen et al.35 Briefly, a portion of the aerosol flow is sampled through a 500 m orifice coupled to an\naerodynamic lens that focuses the particle beam and reduces the gas-phase molecular concentration by means of a pinhole plate system described by Liu et al.36 Only particles with diameters > 50 nm are transmitted by the aerodynamic lens, and the particle flux entering the interaction region is estimated to be about 3 x 107 particles/s.39 Subsequently, inside the mass spectrometer, the particles are thermally or catalytically decomposed between 100 \u00b0C and 317 \u00b0C on a heated copper or iridium target in the ATOFMS ionization region, and products are vaporized and photoionized by tunable VUV radiation produced by the Chemical Transformations Beamline at the Advanced Light Source. The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra and ion yields of the aerosol decomposition products are measured with a pulsed TOF mass spectrometer and recorded as a function of the target temperature and the photon energy of the tunable VUV source. Mass spectra were taken as scans of the photon energy in the range from\n7.4 to 15.0 eV, typically in 0.1 eV steps and averaged for 500,000 repeller pulses to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured photoionization energy curves of the detected products.\nIn previous experimental work at the aerosol endstation at the ALS beamline 9.0.2.1,\nisolated ion pairs of aprotic ionic liquids were generated in the gas phase by thermal vaporization of IL aerosol particles on a heated copper target and were monitored using soft ionization detection with tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization mass spectrometry.7, 30 However, in this case, HEHN is considered a protic ionic liquid, and thermal mass loss (vaporization) of this class of ionic liquids is generally assumed to occur via a proton transfer mechanism and vaporization of the resulting neutral species,2 and this detail is discussed in the manuscript.\nThe ATOFMS was designed to promote flash vaporization, and, based on previously\nmeasured mass loss rates of ionic liquids and our measured aerosol mass flow rate into the ATOFMS, the residence and reaction time on the heated targets is estimated to be on the order of tens of microseconds before the volatile initial products are rapidly vaporized into the ionization region at \u223c10\u22126 Torr.6 By integrating the photoion current over all photon energies and plotting the product photoion response as a function of target temperature, differences in the thermal decomposition (Cu target) versus catalytic decomposition chemistry (Ir target) can be evaluated."

The LDIDD-MS system was built by combining a pulsed laser and an apparatus for generating droplets and coupled to the Orbitrap mass spectrometer described above. The cone and capillary voltages of the mass spectrometer inlet were set to 44 and 60 V, respectively. The capillary temperature was set to 275 \u00b0C. A voltage of 5 kV was applied to the metal tips of a syringe infused with solvent for droplet delivery. A DCR-11 pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Spectra Physics, CA) with a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm was used to generate UV pulses. An HG-2 harmonic generator and PHS-1 harmonic separator were used to generate and separate the output of the UV laser at 266 nm. The UV laser beam was fired at 15 Hz and was aligned and focused using a 4 cm focal length lens on the sample surface. Dried N2 gas was supplied at 80 psi to\npromote nebulization and generation of aerosol droplets, to propel the aerosols to the catalyst surface and to deliver the analytes to the mass spectrometry inlet. A stream of liquid droplets generated by nebulizing N2 gas and electrospray was tilted at 50\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 downward and directed onto the laser-irradiated region to capture desorbed molecules and molecular ions from the substrate and deliver them to the inlet (extended capillary at a length of 9 cm) of the mass spectrometer. The electrospray source was placed at a distance of 3\u22125 mm from the focused laser spot. Either a 10% solution of HEHN in methanol was sprayed directly on the target surface, or pure HEHN was placed on the target and a mixture of methanol and water (1:1, v/v) was used as a solvent for droplets. For the former case, solvent flow rate and pressure of N2 gas supply were adjusted such that desorption solely by the liquid droplets was minimized. The optimal condition for LDIDD-MS was a flow rate of 0.5 \u03bcL/min and a N2 pressure of 80 psi. The diameter of the electrospray on the sample surface was around 200 \u03bcm.

The supersonic cooling further reduces photoionization fragmentation by minimizing the internal energy of the parent molecules and the pyrolysis products.\nThe literature regarding the thermal decomposition mechanism of HEH is sparse, and the\nonly article that we could find indicated that HEH primarily decomposes at ~215 \u00b0C to methylhydrazine and formaldehyde (HOCH2CH2NHNH2 \u2192 H2CO + H3CNHNH2), although traces of ethanolamine, ammonia and hydrazine were also detected.42 Ando et. al. reported an exothermic decomposition of gaseous HEH by DSC at To=251.0 \u00b0C and an associated heat of decomposition of Q=240 cal/g (76.3 kJ/mol), but no decomposition mechanism was indicated.43 A related article using high-resolution mass spectrometry indicated that the C-C bond dissociation of the related cationic HEH+ to form HOCH2 and CH2NHNH2 + is possible, with an\nappearance energy of 9.1 eV for CH2NHNH2 +, and that CH2NHNH2 + is unstable when neutralized.44 The literature mass spectrum (electron-impact ionization) of HEH indicates mass fragment peaks at m/z 45 (100%), 31(10%) and smaller peaks at m/z 15, 17-19, 26-32, 39-46 and 55-59.45\nThe thermal decomposition of HEH by flash pyrolysis between 295 and 1400 K can be\nseen in Figure 1. At 295 K, masses at m/z 76 and 45 correspond to the parent HEH and the dissociative photoionization product CH2NHNH2 +,44 respectively, and a very small peak at m/z 31 is observed. At 1230 K, significant peaks appear at m/z 44, 43 and 31 and smaller peaks at m/z 28 and m/z 29. Above 1300 K, there are additional peaks at m/z 15 and m/z 17. In order to explain the peaks observed in Figure 1, a systematic series of DFT calculations of the enthalpies\n(H298) and free energies of reaction (G298), ionization energies (IE) and dissociative photoionization appearance energies (AE) are compiled in Table 1, and these calculations are discussed in detail below.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the unimolecular thermal decomposition of the simpler\nmethylhydrazine system that has been studied both experimentally46 and theoretically47 and has been shown to produce a combination of free radicals and molecular species with activation barriers of around 63.1-69.5 kcal/mol (264.0-290.8 kJ/mol). If the primary unimolecular thermal decomposition of HEH produced methylhydrazine (m/z 46, IE = 7.7 eV) and H2CO (m/z 30, IE = 10.9 eV: not ionized at 10.45 eV) as suggested in ref42, intact methylhydrazine would exhibit significant peaks in the mass spectrum at m/z 45 and 46 and a smaller m/z 31 peak (Fig. 1, top in Ref. 48). If the methylhydrazine is produced with enough internal energy to further decompose, there would be a series of peaks at m/z 15, 17, 28, 29, 30 and 31 (Fig. 1, bottom in Ref. 48). However, since there are no significant m/z 46 or m/z 30 peaks apparent in Figure 1, the\nformation of methylhydrazine is negligible (<1%) under our experimental conditions. Perhaps the pronounced formation of methylhydrazine in ref42 was a result of surface reactions with the sample container walls.\nIn assessing the unimolecular thermal decomposition of HEH using density functional\ntheory (at the M06/6-31+G(d,p) level), a systematic approach to identify the lowest activation barrier pathways was utilized that included all possible elementary reactions, and the results are reported in Table 1 (Rxns. 1-32) in order of increasing activation barrier \u2013 either activation enthalpy, H\u2021298, or the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE). In Table 1, the reaction types are identified as simple bond dissociations (BD), hydrogen transfer (e.g. OH to C1) reactions and H2 eliminations (H2 elim.). Possible secondary reactions (2\u00b0, Rxns. 34-43) and photoionization\nprocesses (Rxns. 44-70) are also included in Table 1. It is noted here that the simple bond dissociations and any H2 elimination pathways identified all have activation barriers that are too high to proceed (\u2265 ~275 kJ/mol) and are not believed to be accessible in this experimental setup. The systematic DFT approach and results are described in detail below.\nFirst, the structures of the lowest energy isomers were determined. In contrast to\nmethylhydrazine, HEH has more isomers possible due to rotations around the bonded heteroatoms, and the lowest energy isomer is identified as a 5-membered cyclic structure with the OH group hydrogen, hydrogen-bonded to N1 (HEH0, Fig. 2). A slightly higher energy structure was located that has a 6-membered cyclic structure with the NH of the terminal nitrogen (N2) hydrogen-bonded to the oxygen (HEH1, Fig. 2). While there are multiple lowenergy HEH structures that can lead directly to bond fission processes, the structure HEH1 has the lowest direct barriers to decomposition products and all energies in Figure 2 are calculated relative to HEH1.\nFigure 2. Atomic numbering and HEH thermal decomposition reaction profile. H298 (G298) values calculated in kJ/mol at the M06/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory and are relative to HEH1. Reaction numbers are from Table 1.\nSecond, the simple bond dissociation energies (BDE) were assessed (Fig. 2 and Rxns 6,\n8, 17, 19, 21, 26, and 28-30, Table 1). It can be seen that the enthalpies (H298) of bond dissociation of the N-N and C-N bonds - yielding products with masses of 16 and 60 amu (Rxn. 6), and 31 and 45 amu (Rxn. 8) in HEH are very similar: 268.2 and 274.3 kJ/mol, while for C-C (product masses 31 and 45 amu, Rxn. 19) and C-O (product masses 17 and 59, Rxn. 28) bond cleavages, they are higher in energy at 335.9 and 393.0 kJ/mol, respectively. In the mass spectra in Figure 1 above, there is no indication of the formation of m/z 60 or m/z 59 peaks corresponding to the larger fragments in the N-N (Rxn. 6) and C-O (Rxn. 28) bond cleavages that would be expected to be ionized at 10.45 eV (IE(HOCH2CH2NH, m/z 60) = 10.1 eV (vertical IE, M06); IE(CH2CH2NHNH2, m/z 59) = 9.6 eV). While the enthalpy of the C-O bond cleavage is prohibitively high (393.0 kJ/mol, Rxn. 28), it is noted that no m/z 60 product stemming from the N-N bond cleavage (HOCH2CH2NH, Rxn. 6) is detected even though the enthalpy barrier is similar to the C-N cleavage channel (Rxn. 8). Therefore, it is unlikely that thermally-activated bond dissociation between the heteroatoms is occurring under these experimental conditions. The lack of m/z 75 in Figure 1 also indicates H-fission processes (Rxns 17, 21, 26, 29 and 30) are not occurring.\nThird, the energetics of possible hydrogen transfer reactions were investigated by running\nbond scans between each hydrogen and the target heteroatom (O, C1, etc.). Remember that HEH1 is a six-membered ring with the terminal NH hydrogen-bonded to the oxygen. By far the lowest energy barrier pathway (H\u2021 = 173.4 kJ/mol, Rxn. 1) involves a hydrogen transfer from O\nto N1, followed by a spontaneous second hydrogen transfer from N2 to O, leading to the\nformation of HOCH2CH2N +H2N -H (Figure S1a). This product remains as m/z 76 and therefore is not discernable from the HEH (reactant) by this experimental method. Possible reactivity of this isomer will be discussed below. The next highest activation barrier pathway involves a transition state (TS3, Fig. 2) having a single imaginary frequency where the OH hydrogen transfers to the terminal nitrogen (N2) leading to NH3 elimination (Rxn. 2).

The activation enthalpy for this transition state is H\u2021 = 236.0 kJ/mol, significantly lower than for any of the bond fission processes mentioned\nabove and for any of the thermal decomposition processes of methylhydrazine mentioned above.42 On other hand, OH hydrogen to N1 followed by dissociation could lead to H2COCH2 (ethylene oxide, IE = 10.56 \u00b1 0.01 eV45) and N2H4, (IE = 8.1 \u00b1 0.15 eV 45), the latter of which would be easily detectable in our setup at m/z 32. Figure 1 shows complete lack of the signal at m/z 32 (S/N < 2), hence this pathway may be ruled out.\nThe OH hydrogen to N2 pathway of Rxn. 2 leading to NH3, H2CNH and H2CO could\naccount for the detection of m/z 17 and m/z 29 above T = 1230 K, although the H2CO product is not detected due to its higher photoionization threshold. Other low-barrier hydrogen transfer processes leading to stable stationary state HEH isomers include H transfer between C1, N1 and N2 (Rxns. 3, 4 and 7). Reaction 5 involves H transfer from N1 to C1 and leads to the formation of HOCH2CH3 + H2N=N:, and this pathway will be discussed in more detail below.\nIn the bond scans that were performed in the search for transition states for H-transfer\nreactions, several transition states were instead located for H2 elimination processes. These resulted in H2 elimination reactions from O-C1, O-C2, C1-C2 or N2-C1, respectively, Rxns 12, 13, 20 and 27) having substantial enthalpy barriers (H\u2021 > 350 kJ/mol) similar to hydrogen\nBDEs (Rxns 17, 21, 26, 29 and 30), and this explains the lack of a peak at m/z 74. No direct transition state was located in the bond scan between the OH hydrogen and C1 to produce H2CO and H3CNHNH2, but instead yielded a transition state for H2 elimination, with one H from O and one H from C1, resulting in H2CO + H2 + HC\u0308NHNH2, H \u2021 = 379.7 kJ/mol (Rxn. 27), and this route is not accessible in this experiment. Attempts to locate a direct transition state between\nHEH and H2CO + H3CNHNH2 by investigating the reverse reaction: H2CO + H3CNHNH2 \u2192 HOCH2CH2NHNH2 always converged to the same H2 elimination saddle point as Rxn. 27 with H\u2021 = 379.7 kJ/mol. A possible HEH unimolecular decomposition pathway to produce H3CNHNH2 + HOC\u0308H (Rxn. 20, H \u2021 = 341.1 kJ/mol) was identified, but the high barrier also precludes this route. Since, at this level of theory, no direct H-migration transition state was located for the elementary unimolecular decomposition of HEH to form H2CO and H3CNHNH2, (OH hydrogen to C1), this could suggest that the H2CO and HOCH2CH2NH2 products observed in ref. 37 were formed through a heterogeneous pathway, although higher-level quantum calculations may be able to locate this possible transition state. It should be noted that, in the BOMD simulations, multiple trajectories resulted in H3CNHNH2 formation plus HCO\u0308H, but when these trajectories were analyzed in detail, they appear to first proceed through a C1-C2 bond cleavage with subsequent H-abstraction from OH by carbon in the leaving H2C\u0307NHNH2 radical to give H3CNHNH2. This reaction has a barrier that is likely similar or higher in energy than the C1-C2 bond cleavage energy (H = 335.9 kJ/mol, Rxn. 19).\nIn Table 1, when comparing elementary reactions with the lowest enthalpy barriers H\u2021,\nor H for the bond dissociation (BD), the next highest enthalpy barriers above that for O\nhydrogen transfer to N2 (Rxn. 2) mentioned earlier are for the hydrogen migration between the nitrogens: N2 hydrogen \u2192 N1, H\u2021 = 254.1 kJ/mol (Rxn. 4) and N1 hydrogen \u2192 N2, H\u2021 =\n249.0 kJ/mol (Rxn. 3), resulting in stationary points that are high-energy structural isomers of HEH that cannot be experimentally differentiated from HEH at m/z 76. Next, the N1H to C1 hydrogen transfer resulting in HOCH2CH3 + H2N=N: has a similar barrier of H \u2021 = 255.3 kJ/mol (Rxn. 5, Fig. 2), and this channel will be discussed in detail below. Formation of HOCH2CH3 + HNNH is also possible via N1H to C1 (Rxn. 34) in the structural isomer HOCH2CH2NH2NH\nformed in Reactions 11 and 26 but with a higher enthalpy barrier of H\u2021 = 344.8 kJ/mol (Fig.\nS1a).\nAbove the HEH1 \u2192 HOCH2CH3 + H2N=N: reaction channel (Rxn. 5, H \u2021 = 255.3\nkJ/mol), the next highest activation enthalpy barrier pathways are the N-N and C-N bond cleavages, H\u2021 = 268.2 (Rxn. 6) and H\u2021 = 274.3 kJ/mol (Rxn. 8), respectively, and since no\nphotoions were detected (S/N < 2) that correspond to the m/z 60 species produced through N-N cleavage, it is likely that these pathways are not accessed under these experimental conditions. Similarly, all of the other H-migration, H2 elimination and BD pathways identified in Table 1 have higher barriers and are not likely activated under these experimental conditions.\nIn order to explore the possibility of HOCH2CH3 formation, flash pyrolysis of\nHOCH2CH3 was performed at up to T = 1270 K, and the results are shown in Figure S2. Although the literature IE values for HOCH2CH3 range from 10.4 to 10.7 eV, 50 at 295 K, the parent peak at m/z 46 is seen, indicating that HOCH2CH3 can be photoionized using this technique. At T = 720 K, a small peak is observed at m/z 44, indicating H2 loss. At 1090 K, m/z 15 appears, indicating the formation of the \u00b7CH3 radical. At the highest temperature, 1270 K, the appearance of a small peak at m/z 28 is observed, perhaps indicating the formation of H2CCH2 or H3CC\u0308H.\nThe pyrolysis of HOCH2CH3 (ethanol) has been studied extensively 51-53 and has a high-\npressure thermal decomposition onset temperature of ~700 K. The accepted mechanism proceeds primarily through three channels, see Table 1:53\nHOCH2CH3 \u2192 H3CCH + H2O (35)\n\u2192 CH3 + H2COH (36) \u2192 C2H5 + OH (37)\nA fourth channel \u2013 HOCH2CH3 \u2192 O=CHCH3 + H2 (Rxn. 38) - with a similar activation barrier to the CH3 + H2COH channel is also possible. 53-54 The 10.45 eV ionizing photons in our experiment should photoionize the products H3CCH (m/z 28, IE = 8.3 eV, M06), CH3 (m/z 15, IE = 9.84 eV50), C2H5 (m/z 29, IE = 8.1 eV 43) , H2COH (m/z 31, IE = 7.56 eV 55, with AE = 8.61 for m/z 29, CHO+55) and O=CHCH3 (m/z 44 IE = 10.23 eV 50), and possibly any hot H2CCH2 (m/z 28 IE = 10.51 eV50) as well as the parent product HOCH2CH3 (m/z 46, IE=10.4-10.7 eV 50) , whereas the H2O, OH and H2 all have IEs that are too high for photoionization at 10.45 eV. It is reported in the literature that O=CHCH3 can fragment to C2H3O + + H at an appearance energy of as low as 10.50 \u00b1 0.05 eV,56 and this could account for the detection of m/z 43 in Figure 1. Additionally, in the BOMD molecular dynamics simulations of HEH1 (T=3000-5500 K, PM6, described in detail in the SI), 0.67% of the reactive pathways lead to HOCH2CH3 + H2N=N:/HNNH products, and starting from the HOCH2CH2N +H2N -H intermediate (formed via Rxns 11 and 26), 12.0% of the reactions lead to HOCH2CH3 + HNNH.\nAdditional discussions on N2H2 isomerization, the analysis of relative peak intensities\nand possible contributions to the thermal decomposition of HOCH2CH3, literature rate constant analysis on the thermal decomposition of HOCH2CH3, H3CCH to H2CCH2 isomerization, and thermal contributions to the ionization energies of the possible products are included in the SI, pages S3-S5.\nIn summary, we propose that the flash pyrolysis of HEH results can be explained by two\nmain pathways: 1) OH hydrogen to N2 migration yielding NH3 (m/z 17), H2CO (not detected) and H2C=NH (m/z 29), and 2) N1H hydrogen to C1 migration from HEH1 or HOCH2CH2N +H2N -H to form HOCH2CH3 that further decomposes to CH3 (m/z 15, IE = 9.84 eV50), H3CCH (m/z 28, IE = 8.3 eV, M06) or H2CCH2 (m/z 28, IE = 10.51 eV 50), C2H5 (m/z 29,\nIE = 8.1 eV43) and H2COH (m/z 31 IE = 7.56 eV 55). M/z 44 is formed upon the pyrolysis of HOCH2CH3 to O=CHCH3 + H2. M/z 43 could be due to dissociative photoionization of O=CHCH3 + hv \u2192 C2H3O + + H, with an appearance energy of 10.50 \u00b1 0.05 eV.56"

            "text": "The first tunable VUV-PI-TOFMS experiment on HEHN, [HOCH2CH2NH2NH2 +][NO3 -],\nutilized an effusive source for the ionic liquid sample, where the ionic liquid is placed in a temperature-controlled glass sample container.33 The vapors given off of the heated sample penetrate through a pinhole into the photoionization region, and the product photoion masses are recorded as a function of sample temperature and photoionization energy (8.0-15.0 eV). The resulting photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves measure the photoion current as a function of photon energy and can be used to determine the ionization energy (IE) of parent photoions and appearance energies (AE) of dissociative photoionization fragments with an estimated uncertainty of below \u00b1 0.2 eV. From the heated ionic liquid sample, the vaporization of the ionic liquid (if any), its volatile impurities and its thermal decomposition products are detected simultaneously, somewhat complicating interpretation of the mass spectra. It should be noted that the time scale for these condensed-phase decomposition reactions is on the order of minutes, which is significantly longer than the time scale of the aerosol experiments (~10 sec). This experiment only allows for the detection of stable, closed shell decomposition products, and this will be discussed in detail later.\nIn Figure 3, mass spectra can be seen for the HEHN ionic liquid at 200 \u00b0C at 9.0 eV and\n12.6 eV photoionization energies. The primary thermal decomposition product of the protic ionic liquid HEHN is the neutral 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HOCH2CH2NHNH2, HEH, m/z 76) formed via proton transfer from the cation (HOCH2CH2NH2NH2 +) to the anion (NO3 -), and the\nmajor dissociative ionization fragment of HEH+ is m/z 4545 (similar to Fig. 1); The HNO3 coproduct is detected at m/z 63 (HNO3 +, IE = 12.0 eV50) with a major dissociative ionization fragment at m/z 46 (NO2 +, AE = 12.0 eV50) and a minor fragment at m/z 30 (NO+, AE=12.2 eV, M06/6-31(+)G(d,p)): [HOCH2CH2NH2NH2 +][NO3 -] +  \u2192 HOCH2CH2NHNH2 + HNO3 (71) HOCH2CH2NHNH2 + hv \u2192 HOCH2CH2NHNH2 + + e- m/z = 76, IE = 7.8 eV (72) HOCH2CH2NHNH2 + \u2192 HOCH2CH2 + + HNNH2 m/z = 45, AE = 8.9 eV (73) HNO3 + hv \u2192 HNO3 + + e- m/z = 63, IE = 12.0 eV (74) HNO3 + \u2192 NO2 + + OH m/z = 46, AE = 12.0 eV (75) HNO3 + \u2192 NO+ + OOH m/z = 30, AE = 12.2 eV (76) Although HEH and HNO3 are produced in a 1:1 ratio via Rxn. 71, the significant difference in relative total ion current intensities of HEH versus HNO3 (Fig. 3) could be due to the higher IE of HNO3, its significant ion fragmentation to m/z 46 via Rxn. 75 and to a smaller photoionization cross section of HNO3 below 15 eV photon energies. It has been noted previously that the facile fragmentation of HNO3 + must be considered in interpretation of mass spectrometric data.6\nIn order to look for major decomposition products, it is informative to first generate the\ntotal ion current (TIC) mass spectrum, defined here as the sum of all mass spectra over all photon energies for a given temperature. In this way, significant differences in ion currents between various experimental conditions can be observed. For example, in Figure 4 the TIC mass spectrum at 105 \u00b0C is compared to the TIC mass spectrum at 200 \u00b0C (normalized to the 105 \u00b0C HEH m/z 76 peak). Besides the formation of HEH and HNO3, the major difference in the TIC mass spectra between 105 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C is the formation of m/z 30 with an experimental IE = 9.1 \u00b1 0.2 eV and smaller peaks (and IEs) are also observed at m/z 56 (8.8), 60 (9.8), 61 (8.8), 69 (9.0), 70 (8.8), 74 (9.0), 96 (9.8), 114 (8.8), 120 (~7.8), 129 (9.0), 143 (9.2), 167 (9.4), 174 (<8.0 (~7.0)), 182 (11.6), 197 (9.2), 212 (11.0) and 251 (11.2). The m/z 30 peak cannot be H2CO (IE = 10.8 eV)50 as has been previously proposed as a thermal decomposition product of HEH42 or C2H6 (IE = 11.5 eV), 50 but can be assigned to the formation of NO (IE=9.26 eV).50 Although an m/z 30 NO+ fragment is possible from the dissociative ionization of HNO3, via Reaction 76 above, it would need an appearance energy of greater than the IE of HNO3 of 12.0 eV, where the calculated appearance energy AE(NO+) = 12.2 eV (M06/6-31+G(d,p)). The possible mechanism for the formation of NO from the thermal decomposition of HEHN is unclear, and this will be addressed in a future publication.\nFigure 4. Total ion current VUV-PI mass spectra of HEHN from the VUV-PI-TOFMS effusive source (normalized to m/z 76) at 105 \u00b0C (black) and 200 \u00b0C (red): a) full-scale, b) enlarged spectra m/z 55-80 and c) enlarged spectra m/z 80-255.\nIn previous work, the evolution of ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, IE = 8.9 eV, 50 m/z\n61) as a decomposition product from HEH42 and HEHN20 has been proposed. The experimental IE of m/z 61 of 8.8 eV matches the literature value well, and m/z 61 is identified to be from ethanolamine, likely produced here by the heterogeneous dissociation of the N-N bond in HEH to produce ethanolamine and NH3, and catalytic NH3 production is discussed below. The IE/AEs of m/z 56 and 60, at 8.8 and 9.8 eV, respectively, could indicate the photofragmentation of the ethanolamine cation (m/z 61). Ethanolamine also exhibits a significant dissociative ionization fragmentation channel to produce CH4N + with an AE of 9.5 eV that could also contribute to the formation of m/z 30. (Note, since we do not see ethanolamine formation in homogeneous pyrolysis of HEH during flash pyrolysis, m/z 30 was also absent there.) Observation of peaks at m/z 69, 70 and 74, with IE/AEs of 9.0, 8.8 and 9.0 eV respectively, could be a result of subsequent fragmentation of HEH+ (m/z 76, HOCH2CH2NHNH2, IE = 7.8 eV) having in excess of 1.0 eV internal energy, although these peaks are not observed in the electron-impact ionization mass spectrum of HEH.45 They could also be a result of dissociative photoionization of heavier products (effusing from the source) observed in Figure 4, or the dehydrogenation of HEH, although the loss of six or seven hydrogens to form m/z 70 and 69, respectively, is unlikely. The other thermal decomposition peaks in Figure 4 that are above m/z 77 will be compared to observations in the other techniques and will be discussed in Section E.\nThe introduction of a small amount of iridium catalyst into the HEHN in the effusive\nsource at 200 \u00b0C results in the significant increase in photoions of m/z 17, 18 and 28 (Figure 5), and the formation of photoions not seen in significant quantities in the thermal decomposition\nproducts of HEHN (Fig. 4), namely m/z 71, 97 and 102. The IE and/or AE of these photoions can be found in Table S1 in the SI. Possible identities of these photoions will be discussed briefly here and in more detail in comparison to the aerosol VUV-PI-TOFMS, NAIMS and LDIDD-MS results below.\nA significant benefit of tunable VUV-MS is that the PIE curves that are generated can be\nused to determine the IE of parent photoions and AE of dissociative photoionization fragments. PIE curves for m/z 17, 63, 46 and 76 photoions can be seen in Figure 6. The experimental IE for m/z 17 of 10.0 \u00b1 0.2 eV matches very well with the literature IE for NH3 (10.05 eV), 50, 57 and the shape of the PIE curve is nearly identical to the literature data,57 and so the m/z 17 product is identified as NH3\nwith a high degree of confidence. Similarly, the literature IE for HNO3 is 12.0 eV 50 with an AE for m/z 46 (NO2 + fragment from HNO3 +, Rxn. 5) of essentially the same energy, 12.0 eV,50 and are a good match to both the experimental IE of m/z 63 (11.8 \u00b1 0.2 eV) and the AE of m/z 46\n(11.8 \u00b1 0.2 eV). For HEH (m/z 76), both the literature IE (7.6 eV)50 and the M06/6-31+G(d,p) calculated IE (7.55 \u00b1 0.2 eV) values match very well with the experimental IE (7.8 \u00b1 0.2 eV) for m/z 76. M/z 18 is a good match for H2O (literature IE = 12.621 eV) 50 with an experimental IE of 12.4 \u00b1 0.2 eV. The detection of enhanced signal of m/z 28 (IE=10.4) cannot result from photoionization of N2, CO, H2CN\u00b7 or HCNH\u00b7 products, as their IEs are 15.58, 14.014, 9.4 and 7.3 eV, respectively.50 The timescale for this experiment is likely too long to observe the possible production of H2CN\u00b7 or HCNH\u00b7, as they would react to form closed shell species in solution. The likely identity of m/z 28 is C2H4, with an IE 10.5 eV, which was also proposed in the flash pyrolysis of HEH above. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that m/z 28 results from dissociative photofragmentation of the heavier species (m/z 71, 97 and 102) being formed upon iridium addition to HEHN.\nIn comparing the PIE intensities for the species in Figure 6, it is apparent from the PIE signals for m/z 63, 46 and 76 that not only does thermal decomposition produce HNO3 + HEH products \u2013 as evidenced by the increase in PIE signals from 105 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C \u2013 but also that the addition of the Ir catalyst into the effusive source with the HEHN enhances the evolution of HEH and HNO3 relative to HEHN thermal decomposition alone. This indicates that there is competition between thermal and catalytic routes to form HEH + HNO3. In contrast, when evaluating the m/z 17 NH3 PIE signals in Figure 6, there is very little difference in the PIE signals from 105 \u00b0C to\n200 \u00b0C for HEHN only, whereas there is a large enhancement (5x) in signal upon introduction of the Ir catalyst at 200 \u00b0C, indicating near-exclusive formation of NH3 via heterogeneous catalysis. In order to quantify product enhancement due to the catalytic effect, by comparing the total ion currents for thermal versus catalytic decomposition as a function of temperature (Fig. S3), it is observed that significant enhancement (~3-10x) of m/z 17, 71, 97 and 102 occurs when the Ir catalyst granule is introduced at 200 \u00b0C, whereas only modest enhancement (~2x) occurs for m/z 18, 28, 30, 63 and 76. The possible identities of the m/z 71, 97 and 102 species will be discussed in detail in Section C2 (ii)."

In Figure 7, the total ion currents of HEHN aerosols on copper as a function of temperature (normalized to m/z 76) show significant increases in m/z 18, 28 and 30 between 150 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C. Smaller ion current increases were also observed for m/z 43, 44, 46, 55-57, 64, 69-71, 81-85, 92-99, 109-114, 129 and 133, and a small new peak appears at m/z 15. Relative percent intensity values (%I) and IE/AEs for all of these photoion peaks are listed in Table S2. A more detailed look at the PIE curves for the photoions produced as a function of temperature indicates that N2O (m/z 44) formation is possible at 300 \u00b0C (Figure 8). 7 Decreases in m/z 63 and 76 TIC mass spectral signal as the\npeaks seen in the thermal decomposition of HEHN aerosols on copper will be discussed in Section C2. (ii) Catalytic decomposition of HEHN aerosols on iridium\nUpon introduction of an iridium catalyst target in the ATOFMS, the total ion current\nspectra (normalized to m/z 76) comparison of the thermal decomposition of HEHN on copper at 300 \u00b0C with HEHN on an iridium catalyst target at 300 \u00b0C can be seen in Figure 9a-b. HEHN on the hot catalyst target displays an increase in all photoions that were observed in the thermal decomposition TIC mass spectrum (Fig. 8) plus new peaks at m/z 36, 38, 39 and 87 (Table S3). The increase in peaks can be attributed to the catalytic enhancement of the proton transfer in Reaction 1, thereby increasing the formation of HEH and HNO3. The small m/z peaks at 36 and 38 (IE = 12.5 \u00b1 0.2 eV) found only upon introduction of the Ir catalyst can be attributed to HCl (IE =\n12.744 \u00b1 0.009 eV45) formed by Ir surface reaction of HNO3 with Cl - impurities in the ionic liquid, and the isotopic ratio of 35Cl:37Cl ~ 3:1 matches well with the intensity ratio of m/z 36:38 in Figure 9b. The peak forming at m/z 39 indicates the formation of a C3H3 species and this will be discussed in more detail in Section C2(ii). The appearance of m/z 87 could result from H2 loss from m/z 89, and dehydrogenation reactions are also observed in the catalytic decomposition of HEH aerosols, discussed below.\nThe comparison of HEHN on an iridium catalyst target at 150 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C is shown in\nFigure 9c (full scale) and Figure 9d (magnified 10x). Increases in peaks at 300 \u00b0C occur at m/z\n15, 17, 18, 28, 30, 43, 44, 45, 55 and 56 and a new peak appears at m/z 39. Upon further analysis of the PIE curves for each photoion, new features due to the introduction of the iridium catalyst granule are observed (m/z 39 and m/z 44, Fig. 10). Again, the significant increase in m/z 39 signal (Fig. 10a) could indicate the formation of a C3H3 species, and this will be discussed in more detail below. While a small amount of N2O (m/z 44) was observed for thermal decomposition of HEHN on copper at 300 \u00b0C (Fig. 8), N2O production is detected as low as 150 \u00b0C upon introduction of the iridium catalyst, indicated by the peak in the m/z 44 PIE at 14.2 eV (Fig. 10b). The mechanism for the formation of N2O from HEHN must be somewhat complex and understanding how N2O is formed could play a critical role in the catalytic ignition of HEHN-based monopropellants, as has been noted previously in other ionic liquid ignition mechanisms.11, 58 An increase in m/z 15 upon introduction of the iridium catalyst granule can partially be attributed to the possible formation of CH3 + due to dissociative photoionization of catalytic products with higher masses above 14.0 eV. However, possible formation of \u00b7CH3 radical was observed both in thermal decomposition at 300 \u00b0C and on the Ir catalyst target above 250 \u00b0C, both detected at IE = 9.6 \u00b1 0.3 eV, and this IE matches reasonably well with the literature IE of \u00b7CH3 of 9.837 \u00b1 0.005 eV. 50 The formation and detection of \u00b7CH3 was also seen in the flash pyrolysis of HEH (Fig. 1), and CH3 may be one contributor to the formation of the C3H3 (m/z 39) species mentioned above, and this is discussed further below."

            "text": "Thermal decomposition of HEH aerosols (i) on copper and (ii) on iridium\nAs has been established above, the primary thermal decomposition products of HEHN\nare HNO3 and HEH neutrals formed upon proton transfer from the HOCH2CH2NH2NH2 + cation to the NO3 - anion. In a separate experiment, 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HEH-the neutral precursor to HEHN) aerosols were formed and introduced into the aerosol mass spectrometer at the ALS beamline 9.0.2 with either a heated copper surface or a heated Ir catalyst as the aerosol target.\nDue to the relatively low enthalpy of vaporization for HEH, Hvap = 52.3 \u00b1 6.3 kJ/mol\n(determined by isothermal TGA8), HEH aerosol formation and introduction into the MS was rather difficult caused by the volatility of HEH. However, it was possible to introduce HEH aerosol particles into the aerosol mass spectrometer to a measurable extent by bypassing the drying tube. Mass spectra were recorded from 7.4-15 eV photoionization energy at heater block temperatures of up to 300 \u00b0C. Total ion current mass spectra (normalized to m/z 76) for HEH on\nthe copper heater block at 110 \u00b0C (black traces) and 300 \u00b0C (red traces), can be seen in Figure 11. Increases in mass peaks are observed at m/z 18, 59, 69, 71, 87 and 89. Experimental IE/AEs of peaks in Figure 11 are reported in Table S4. Total ion current mass spectra (normalized to m/z 76) for HEH on the iridium catalyst at 102 \u00b0C (black traces) and 317 \u00b0C (red traces), can be seen in Figure 12, and experimental IE/AEs of peaks in Figure 12 are reported in Table S5. It should be noted that, upon inspection of the m/z 44 PIE curves, N2O was detected from HEH on iridium at 317 \u00b0C, indicating that the formation of N2O does not necessarily require the presence of NO3 - or HNO3 in order to occur, and yet N2O formation is more facile with HEHN (Figures 8 and 10b). An unavoidable impurity in the 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HEH) used to synthesize HEHN was previously identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as bishydroxyethylhydrazine (HOCH2CH2)2N2H2, with m/z 120 (IE = 7.0 eV, M06/6-31+G(d,p)). This species exhibits significant fragment ions at 118, 89 (AE = 8.1 eV), 87, 71 and 69, and these peaks are also detected in this experiment and are attributed, at least in part, to bishydroxyethylhydrazine increases in the m/z 87 to m/z 89 and m/z 69 to m/z 71 peak ratios\nby four and two times, respectively, which indicates the enhancement of dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of iridium catalyst. The catalytic dehydrogenation of bis-HEH to form m/z 118 could indicate that the two hydroxyethyl functional groups are bonded to neighboring N atoms and H2 loss forms an N=N double bond in the m/z 118 product, whereas H2 loss from a terminal NH2 group is not energetically favorable. More discussion on the possible bis-HEH structures is below. The increase in mass peaks with molecular masses that are higher than HEH indicates that heterogeneous recombinations on the iridium surface, such as the addition of a second hydroxyethyl group to HEH to form bis-HEH, as well as the addition of \u00b7CH3 to a C2 species to form C3H3, are possible. The implication here is that catalyst surface radical formation could play important roles as initiators and propagators in the ignition and combustion of HEHNbased monopropellants.\nAs mentioned previously with the HEHN aerosol catalytic results (Fig. 10), a significant\nnew product was also observed in the HEH aerosol experiment that was not present in the HEHN effusive source experiment is the appearance of photoion m/z 39 above T = 300 \u00b0C. The experimental IE of 8.7 eV matches well with the literature value of 8.67 eV for propargyl radical\n(C3H3\u2219), 59 and is significantly different than the literature IE for the alternative m/z 39 cyclopropenyl radical (IE = 6.6 eV).50 Additionally, the experimental PIE curve for m/z 39 matches reasonably well with literature PIE curves59 found for the propargyl radical (see Fig. 13), and m/z 39 is identified here with a reasonable level of certainty as the propargyl radical. The formation of propargyl radical in this catalytic system is significant in that HEH consists of a hydroxyethyl (C2) moiety, and the presence of the iridium catalyst likely plays an important and perhaps necessary role in the transformation of a C2 to a C3 species, possibly in reacting with a \u00b7CH3 species formed as mentioned earlier. Additional theoretical work is required to address this finding."

            "text": "There are several important differences in the effusive versus aerosol experiments to\nconsider when analyzing the data: 1) The HEHN in the effusive source first must undergo decomposition (thermal and/or catalytic) to form HEH + HNO3, and HNO3 is not present in the HEH aerosol experiment, 2) the effective reaction time for the effusive source is on the order of tens of minutes, whereas for the aerosol source, the residence time of HEH on the catalyst is likely tens of microseconds6 as the products are flash vaporized from the hot catalyst surface into vacuum, and 3) the higher temperature of the aerosol experiment (300 \u00b0C versus 200 \u00b0C) could provide sufficient (thermal) energy for the HEH to react via pathways that are inaccessible in the lower temperature effusive source. It should also be noted that the rapid vaporization into high vacuum in the aerosol source could potentially minimize collisions (i.e., radical-radical recombinations) and allow for detection of highly reactive radical species such as \u00b7CH3 and \u00b7C3H3 discussed previously.\nshown as a dashed black line Reprinted from reference 59, with the permission of AIP Publishing."

            "text": "Nanotip ambient ionization mass spectrometry (NAIMS)14 provides an alternate method\nto investigate the catalytic reactivity of HEHN on iridium. We employed two ambient ionization mass spectrometric techniques, including NAIMS and LDIDD-MS, which do not require a high vacuum for the reaction, and therefore provide a more realistic environment for the reaction of HEHN in the presence of Ir catalyst. Previous attempts to investigate this reactivity using another atmospheric mass spectrometric technique \u2013 desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS)61 \u2013 found that the DESI-MS method had insufficient ionizing power to detect the reaction products, and the nanotip ionization method that provides a harder ionization was selected and discussed here. NAIMS creates a localized plasma between the sample and the nanotip by applying a high DC or AC voltage to the nanotip, and ionization takes place within the plasma. The plasma is considered to be a hard ionization technique, which enables the ionization of species that are difficult to be ionized with soft ionization techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI), DESI-MS, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Because the plasma generated in the NAIMS creates rather harsh conditions for samples, it can cause fragmentations of molecular and ionic species within the plasma and possible ablation of clusters from the sample surface, making the resulting mass spectrum somewhat complex. Ionization using NAIMS can create cationic species primarily by H+ addition to neutral species (especially for amines) rather than by removal of an electron that is typical in electron-impact ionization (EI) mass spectrometry. In these experiments, investigation of HEHN catalytic reactivity measured the high-resolution NAIMS mass spectra for HEHN on\nan iridium catalyst at room temperature and at 100 \u00b0C, and any new or enhanced peaks observed at 100 \u00b0C indicate catalytic reaction products. The high resolution afforded by the Orbitrap mass spectrometer allows for the precise determination of molecular formulas of the catalytic products at 100 \u00b0C and of the HEHN species present at 30 \u00b0C. Additionally, we employed collisioninduced dissociation (CID) to identify structural information of selected ions via tandem mass spectrometric analysis.\nMass spectra for HEHN on iridium catalyst at 30 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C are presented in Figure\n14, from which predicted molecular formulas of specific masses observed by high-resolution NAIMS are listed in Table S6. CID fragmentation and detection of the fragment masses of specific products are also listed as primary (1\u00b0) and secondary (2\u00b0) fragments in Table S6. These fragmentation patterns give insight into the bonding structure of the parent ion. At 100 \u00b0C iridium catalyst temperature, significant enhancement of mass peaks are observed at m/z 62, 106, 113, 115, 127-130, 142, 144, 172 and 175, and signal enhancement to a lesser extent is observed for m/z 69, 74, 83, 103, 121, 125, 130 and 134. The signal loss was observed for m/z 89, 101, 133 and 145. Higher mass peaks up to m/z 500 were detected but, based on isotopic abundances, these peaks are believed to be products incorporating either iridium or tungsten from the catalyst surface or the nanotip, respectively, and are therefore excluded from this analysis.\nThe lowest mass product observed in Figure 14 is mass 62.0597, corresponding to the\nmolecular formula C2H8ON. CID fragmentation and detection of the fragment masses from m/z 62 indicates the loss of m/z 18 - an H2O molecule - upon fragmentation, indicating an OH group in the m/z 62 product. Based on the original structure of the hydroxyethylhydrazinium cation reactant, [HOCH2CH2NH2NH2] +, along with its molecular formula C2H9ON2, the product at m/z 62, C2H8ON, has lost an HN (m/z 15) and this leads to the proposed structure of m/z 62 as HOCH2CH2NH3 + as seen in Scheme 1.\nThe structure of the observed peak at m/z 106.0860 can be revealed by its molecular\nformula C4H12O2N, and its fragmentation pattern and structural similarity to HEH +. The CID fragmentation of the m/z 106 shows a primary loss of H2O and secondary loss of another H2O, indicating the presence of two \u2013OH groups in the m/z 106 product. From subsequent CID of the\nprimary m/z 88 fragment, several fragmentation processes can occur: besides the second loss of an H2O mentioned above, fragmentation can also eject an m/z 28 (C2H4) species, or a 44\nScheme 1. CID fragmentation patterns and possible chemical structures for masses 62.05968 and 106.08604 detected from NAIMS of HEHN on Ir catalyst at 100 \u00b0C.\n(C2H4O) fragment, and at higher fragmentation energy, an m/z 46 (C2H6O) fragment also. The observed fragmentation processes are proposed in Scheme 1, yielding (HOCH2CH2)2NH2 + and indicating the loss of an NH2 group from HEH and the addition of a hydroxyethyl (HOCH2CH2) group to the same N atom as the other hydroxyethyl group in HEH. This structure would indicate that the bis-HEH is also formed on the hot catalyst surface with both hydroxyethyl groups bonded to the same N atom (1,1-bis-HEH), in contrast to the previously mentioned bisHEH structure (1,2-bis-HEH), in which proposed catalytic dehydrogenation from neighboring N atoms occurs to form m/z 118.\nAs the product masses become larger, identifications of the catalytic products are more\nchallenging. The products detected at m/z 113.0707 (C5H9ON2) and m/z 115.0864 (C5H11ON2) only differ by two hydrogens, potentially indicating the formation of a C=C or C=N bond in m/z 113.0707 versus a C-C or C-N bond in m/z 115.0864, and it is possible they have very similar structures and formation mechanisms. The primary loss of H2O and m/z 44.0262 identified by high-resolution MS as C2H4O from both m/z 113.0707 and 115.0864 indicates the presence of an \u2013OH group and a hydroxyethyl group in these products, respectively. Presumably, the H2O loss may arise from the hydroxyethyl group itself, indicating either the loss of H2O or C2H4O but not both (which would form a product fragment of, for example, 113.0707 \u2013 (18.0106 + 44.0262) = 51.0339, and m/z 51.0339 is not observed in the fragmentation of m/z 113.0707). While the secondary fragments of m/z 113.0707 and 115.0864 are different, one secondary fragmentation pathway of the primary fragments m/z 95 from 113.0707 and m/z 97 from 115.0864 both produce an m/z 68.0500 fragment (C4H6N). These common CID fragments could indicate that both species detected at m/z 113.0707 and m/z 115.0864 share a common or similar structure with slightly different bond orders, such as an alkenyl vs. an alkyl or imine vs. amine moiety present. For example, the common m/z 68.0500 fragment C4H6N could be the 2H-pyrrolium cation (C4H6N +, Scheme 2). The primary fragment of H2O loss from m/z 113.0707, m/z 95.0609 (C5H7N2), could be the 1-ethenyl-1H-pyrrazolium cation or the 1-ethenyl-1H-imidazolium cation. The primary fragment of H2O loss from m/z 115.0864, m/z 97.0766 (C5H9N2) could be the 1-ethenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H- pyrrazolium cation or the 1-ethenyl-4,5 dihydro-1H-imidazolium cation. In Scheme 2, the CID fragmentation pathways of the proposed catalytic products 1-(2- hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-ium (m/z 113.0707) and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1Hpyrazol-1-ium (m/z 115.0864) are depicted.\nScheme 2. Proposed structures of m/z 113.0707 (left) and m/z 115.0864 (right) HEHN catalytic decomposition products and their CID fragmentation pathways.\nIn order to verify the fragmentation mechanisms depicted in Scheme 2, Born-\nOppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations (Gaussian 16, PM6, 3000-5000 K, step size =10000) were carried out on the mz 113, 95 and 97 species. Multiple trajectories confirmed the H2O loss (via hydroxyethyl C1H to OH transfer) from m/z 113.0707 to form m/z 95.0609, and m/z 95.0609 can fragment to m/z 68.0500 either by C2H3 loss from C-N bond cleavage or by HCN loss due to ring breaking. Similar processes were observed in the fragmentation of m/z 115.0864 in Scheme 2, and instead of HCN elimination, H2CNH was observed to be eliminated from the ring to form m/z 68.0500.\nA useful tool to help determine the structures of these products is the degree of\nunsaturation (DOU), defined as the sum of double bonds, triple bonds and the number of rings in the molecule.62 Determination of the DOU for the corresponding neutral product molecules and their fragments are listed in Table S6. For m/z 113.0707 and 115.0864, having a DOU of 3 and\n2, respectively, indicated the presence of multiple bonds and/or rings in the structure. The DOU values for the fragmentation patterns indicated above are consistent with the proposed fragmentation mechanisms.\nFrom Table S6, the molecular formula of m/z 127.0864 is C6H11ON2 and m/z 129.1020 is\nC6H13ON2. Like m/z 113.0707 and 115.0864, the products m/z 127.0864 and 129.1020 only differ by two hydrogens, so their structures are assumed to be similar and the fragmentation patterns of these products could imply that both species can fragment by H2O or C2H4O loss, indicating that the hydroxyethyl group is present/intact in these products. Two possible structures for m/z 127.0864 and 129.1020 that are consistent with the fragmentation patterns and DOU values in Table S6 are presented in Scheme S1.\nOne product in the NAIMS experiments that is of interest due to its possible similar\nstructure to the m/z 102 product observed in the photoionization mass spectra earlier in this work (Fig. 14), is m/z 103.0864, which is identified here as C4H11ON2. If this product, ionized by H + addition producing an [M+H]+ ion, is similar to the m/z 102 in the ALS experiments that is ionized by electron removal/photoionization to produce an M+ ion, the molecular formula for m/z 102 in the ALS experiments would be C4H10ON2. This product could be a result of dehydration of one of the hydroxyethyl (HOCH2CH2-) groups on bis-HEH (m/z 120), resulting in a vinyl (H2C=CH-) group on the N-N backbone, with the possibility of having both the vinyl and remaining hydroxyethyl functional groups on the same N atom ((HOCH2CH2)(H2C=CH)NHNH2) or on neighboring N atoms ((HOCH2CH2)NHNH(CH=CH2)).\nPrimary fragmentation of the NAIMS m/z 103.0864 product indicates the presence of a\nhydroxyethyl group (by 18/H2O and 44/C2H4O loss discussed above), as well as C2H6O loss and C2H4 loss to a lesser extent, and these fragments are consistent with the m/z 102 species proposed\nabove. Secondary fragmentation of the (m/z 103.0864 \u2013 H2O) fragment m/z 85.0758 indicates the loss of 41/C2H3N, 28/C2H4, 55/C3H5N and 17/NH3. Interestingly, the NAIMS fragmentation pattern of m/z 103 can arise from the loss NH3 from the m/z 85.0758 primary fragment (C4H9N2) as a secondary fragmentation process, and this could indicate that both the hydroxyethyl and vinyl groups are on the same N atom, leading to facile NH3 elimination. However, it is also possible that both isomers are formed - if the hydroxyethyl and vinyl groups are located on neighboring N atoms, CID would display fragmentation to either m/z 42 and 43 or m/z 41 and 44 species, and fragmentation of m/z 85.0758 to m/z 44 (-C2H3N) is also observed. The two isomers have similar free energies of formation at 298 K (Gf) within 11 kJ/mol (M06/6-31+G(d,p)), with the isomer having both of the functional groups on the same N being slightly favored. One possible m/z 103.0864 structure and CID fragmentation pathway (with both of the functional groups on the same N) is depicted in Scheme S2, and is consistent with the calculated DOU values in Table S6.\nIdeally, the IEs of the two possible m/z 103 isomers could help in identifying the isomers\nobserved in the catalytic products. The experimental value of m/z 102 with an IE = 8.0 \u00b1 0.2 eV eV, and theoretical IEs (M06/6-31+G(d,p)) of two possible isomers of C4H10ON2, having either the hydroxyethyl and vinyl on the same N ((HOCH2CH2)(H2C=CH)NNH2) or with each group on neighboring N atoms ((HOCH2CH2)NHNH(CH=CH2)), are 7.2 (8.5 vertical) and 7.0 (8.4 vertical) eV, respectively:\nScheme 3. Proposed m/z 103 isomers.\nThe experimental IE of m/z 102 (IE = 8.0 \u00b1 0.2 eV) does not match with the calculated adibatic IEs but is closer to the calculated vertical IEs. This observation suggests that the Franck-Condon factor for the adiabatic photoionization is small at the adiabatic threshold due to large geometry changes between the neutrals and their corresponding cations. In any case, the theoretical IEs for the two isomers are nearly identical, and it would be difficult to distinguish with confidence the isomer(s) detected in this experiment. It should be noted that if both m/z 103.0864 and m/z 106.0860 are formed from bis-HEH (m/z 120.1017), the former via elimination of a hydroxy group and the latter via NH3 elimination, then the NH3 elimination pathway (direct elimination to form m/z 106.0860 and secondary fragmentation of the m/z 85.0758 primary fragment from m/z 103.0864) could support the formation of the bis-HEH isomer with the two hydroxyethyl groups on the same N atom. In the future, a more detailed theoretical analysis of this process will be necessary for determining the energetics involved in the heterogeneous formation of these isomers and for quantifying the branching ratios in these processes.\nThe remaining higher m/z peaks observed in the experiments, along with their molecular\nformulas and DOU values, are reported in Table S6. Identification of these products is more complicated and will be addressed in a future publication."

The tunable VUV-PI-TOFMS approach adds an additional dimension to the mass spectra, allowing determination of not only the mass-to-charge ratios of the products but their photoionization energies and/or appearance energies as well. This enhanced technique can thus help to differentiate between species with the same mass-to-charge ratios but different IEs, such as N2O vs. CO2. The power of the high mass resolution ambient ionization mass spectrometric techniques of NAIMS and LDIDD-MS additionally allows for the determination of the product molecular formulas with a high degree of certainty. Finally, the added benefit of collisioninduced fragmentation of parent ions in NAIMS and LDIDD-MS further provides structural information about the parent ion, such as the possible nature of functional groups and the structural motifs. For example, the loss of m/z 18 indicates the elimination of water, which could be the result of a 1,2-H transfer to the O on a terminal OH group in HEH+ (m/z 77), resulting in H2O elimination, thereby indicating the presence of an OH functional group in the parent molecule.\nWhen these complementary techniques are used together, the entire dataset generated in\nthis manuscript helps to identify the thermal and catalytic products of HEHN by measuring, 1) the mass-to-charge ratios of products, 2) the ionization energies of products or appearance energies of photofragments, 3) the molecular formulas, and thus their degrees of unsaturation, and 4) the fragmentation patterns of selected products. From this data, possible reaction product structures can be proposed. Energetic properties (thermodynamic stabilities, ionization energies, fragmentation energies, etc.) of the proposed products can then be calculated using quantum chemical ab initio methods to further elucidate the details of the possible structures.\nRather than attempt to identify all of the observed peaks in the mass spectra, we focused\nhere on selected products that are commonly observed across different experiments and those\nproducts that are likely to give the most insight into the thermal and catalytic decomposition mechanisms. We have previously identified the HEH and HEHN thermal and catalytic decomposition products \u00b7CH3 (m/z 15), NH3 (m/z 17), H2O, (m/z 18), C2H4 (m/z 28), H2CNH (m/z 29), NO (m/z 30), N2O (m/z 44), HOCH2CH2NH2 (m/z 61), HNO3 (m/z 63), HEH (m/z 76), as well as higher mass products at m/z 102 and 120 and at m/z 103, 106 and 121 (VUV-PITOFMS and NAIMS/LDIDD, respectively). Possible structures of higher-mass products based on their high-resolution masses of m/z 113, 115, 127 and 129 have also been proposed.\nFrom the species identified above, there are several similarities that can give insight into\nthe HEHN decomposition process. The identification of ammonia (NH3) ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, m/z 61) and m/z 106 ((HOCH2CH2)2NH2 +) indicate that the N-N bond in HEH is readily broken on the iridium catalyst. The formation of m/z 106 ((HOCH2CH2)2NH2 +) could occur either directly by way of reaction of a hydroxyethyl with ethanolamine HOCH2CH2 + HOCH2CH2NH2 \u2192 (HOCH2CH2)2NH or indirectly via de-amination of 1,1-bis-HEH. Bis-HEH (m/z 120) could form directly by the reaction of a hydroxyethyl with HEH, although it cannot be determined whether the second hydroxyethyl adds to the same or neighboring N atom as the hydroxyethyl in HEH. The formation of m/z 102-103 ((HOCH2CH2)(H2C=CH)N2H2) could occur by C2H3 addition to HEH, or, more likely, by dehydration of bis-HEH. Again, it is not clear if the hydroxyethyl and vinyl groups reside on the same or neighboring N atoms in this product. It is also possible that for both bis-HEH and m/z 102, both isomers (1,1- and 1,2-) are formed. The higher mass products detected in these experiments could possibly be formed by sequential addition, dehydration, de-amination and cyclization to species with m/z > 76 (HEH).\nIn comparing the catalytic product masses observed using NAIMS and LDIDD-MS to\nthose observed using VUV-PI-TOFMS, there are some interesting similarities. For example,\nfrom the ALS experiments, product photoions are observed at m/z 102, 114, 120, 129, 143 and 174, while in the NAIMS experiment, product ions are observed at 103, 115, 121, 130, 144 and 175, and in the LDIDD-MS experiment, product ions are also observed at 103, 121 and 175 that could potentially be similar to the products detected in the ALS experiments. Due to the differences in product ionization, reaction temperatures and reaction pressures between the experimental techniques, the differences in the masses could be the result of 1) protonation (m/z + 1) process upon ionization from NAIMS, 2) dissociative photoionization process from VUVPI-TOFMS (m/z \u2013 1, m/z \u2013 2 for H or H2 elimination), or 3) high-temperature catalytic dehydrogenations (m/z \u2013 2: H2 elimination). Dehydrogenation is likely responsible for the observation of m/z 74 (HEH-H2), 118 (bis-HEH-H2) and the dissociative photoions of bisHEH/bis-HEH-H2, namely m/z 89/87 and 71/69.\nFinally, the production of several species that are likely responsible for and significantly\ncontribute to ignition and combustion of HEHN are \u00b7CH3, NO, \u00b7C3H3 and N2O. Methyl and propargyl radicals can facilitate and propagate further reactions by H-abstraction or addition to closed-shell species and are possibly responsible for formation of products with an odd number of carbons such as m/z 113 (C5H9ON2 +) and 172 (C7H14O2N3 +). The formation mechanism of NO from HEHN is unclear at this point, but could result from HNO3 decomposition, and this will be addresses in a future publication. NO may easily convert to NO2. The production of N2O, an oxidizer/combustion accelerator, likely proceeds through a complex reaction mechanism, and the presence of the nitrate anion in HEHN is not required to produce N2O, as it is also observed to evolve from HEH only on the hot catalyst. 5. CONCLUSION\nThis work describes experimental work performed on the decomposition of HEHN and\non 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine, the molecular precursor and primary thermal decomposition product of HEHN. Products observed experimentally and identified through DFT calculations and BOMD simulations are generally consistent with previous studies of HEH and HEHN. Herein, we have attempted to identify new chemical species from thermal and catalytic decomposition processes. Perhaps of most significance are the observation of \u00b7CH3 and propargyl radical (\u00b7C3H3) formation, and these species are believed to lead to recombination reactions resulting in products with higher masses than the original HEH reactant. Other reactions of significance are the heterogeneous dehydration and de-amination reactions and possible vinyl or hydroxyethyl addition reactions. Finally, the formation and subsequent decomposition of ethanol upon homogeneous, unimolecular thermal decomposition of HEH may proceed through a non-statistical, dynamic process. These products could be important in developing improved chemical kinetics models for catalytic ignition and combustion of HEHNbased monopropellants, and incorporation of these species into the kinetics models could result in improved fidelity for predictions of monopropellant thruster performance. Additional theoretical work, such as high-level ab initio, molecular dynamics and phase space theory or RRKM kinetics calculations, are needed to understand HEH pyrolysis and to explain such observations as the transformation of C2 to C3 to form the propargyl radical and the formation of N2O in the catalytic reaction of HEH on an iridium catalyst. 6.
