We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating the association 21 between antidepressant or antipsychotic drug prescribing and diabetes outcomes. 22 Methods 23 We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO to 15th August 2022 to identify eligible 24 studies. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess study quality and performed a narrative 25 synthesis. 26 Results 27 We included 18 studies, 14 reporting on antidepressants and four on antipsychotics. There were 11 28 cohort studies, one self-controlled before and after study, two case-control studies, and four cross-29 sectional studies, of variable quality and highly heterogeneous in terms of study population, 30 exposure definition and outcome analysed. Antidepressant prescribing may be associated with 31 increased risk of macrovascular outcomes, whilst evidence on antidepressant and antipsychotic 32 prescribing and glycaemic control was mixed. Few studies reported on microvascular complications 33 and cardiometabolic factors other than glycaemic control and just one study reported on 34 antipsychotics and diabetes complications. 35 Conclusions 36 There has been little study of antidepressant and antipsychotic drug prescribing in relation to 37 diabetes outcomes. Further, more methodologically robust, research is needed to inform and 38 enhance antidepressant and antipsychotic drug prescribing and monitoring practices in people with 39 diabetes. 40 41 Keywords: Diabetes mellitus; diabetes outcomes; diabetes complications; antidepressant 42 medication; antipsychotic medication; systematic review 43\n3"

            "text": "Antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs are common psychotropic medications used in treating 45 mental illness such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia [1, 2], with prescribing 46 having increased in high income countries in recent years [3, 4]. This may be partly driven by longer 47 treatment duration, but also by more frequent use, including for other indications (such as 48 agitation and aggression in autism spectrum disorder and dementia [5] and chronic pain, migraines, 49 and insomnia [6]). This increased use is of psychotropic drugs is of particular concern given that they 50 appear to be associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes such as 51 obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia [7, 8], as well as major cardiovascular events such as 52 coronary heart disease and stroke [9, 10]. 53 These adverse effects must be considered in the context of their use among people with diabetes, 54 including the bidirectional links between mental illness and diabetes [11] and the use of tricyclic 55 antidepressants (TCA) to treat neuropathic pain occurring as a complication of diabetes [12]. 56 Previous reviews have summarised evidence from experimental studies on the effect of 57 antidepressants on cardiometabolic risk factors in people with diabetes [13, 14]. Although these 58 reviews concluded that some antidepressant subtypes may be associated with improved glycaemic 59 control, the overall evidence was inconclusive, in part due to low study quality, small sample sizes, 60 and insufficient follow-up to adequately investigate longer-term outcomes such as vascular 61 morbidity or mortality. 62 To our knowledge there is no previous systematic review of observational studies reporting the 63 association between antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs and diabetes outcomes. We therefore 64 conducted a systematic review of observational studies in people with diabetes that examined the 65 association between antidepressant or antipsychotic drug prescribing and clinical complications of 66 diabetes (including cardiovascular and microvascular morbidity), mortality, or cardiometabolic risk 67 factors. 68 69\nAll rights reserved.

Details of the antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs 102 included with each study are given in Supplemental Table 2. Eleven studies were cohort [16-26], one 103 was a self-controlled before and after study [27], two were case-control [28, 29], and four were 104 cross-sectional studies [30-33]. Two studies included overlapping study populations [21, 27], but 105 adopted different study designs to address a similar question and so both were included in the 106 narrative synthesis. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies in terms of study 107 population, exposure definitions and outcomes analysed. All studies were from high-income 108 settings. Study populations were most frequently derived from people with newly diagnosed 109 diabetes in the general population. Two studies included a study population with comorbid mental 110 illness and diabetes (one with depression [25] and one with schizophrenia [24]). 111 3.2 Quality assessment 112 Methodological study quality ranged from three to eight out of nine stars (Supplemental Table 3). 113 Concerns arising in some studies included: poor comparability due to insufficient adjustment for 114 relevant confounders including confounding by indication; use of self-report for exposure and/or 115 outcome assessment; poor representativeness of the population; low precision due to small sample 116 sizes; and no description of the response rate and/or attrition (where applicable). 117 3.3 Antidepressant prescribing and diabetes outcomes 118 3.3.1 Diabetes complications 119\nAll rights reserved.

Outcomes were heterogeneous and 122 findings were mixed. 123 Receipt of antidepressant prescriptions, in comparison to no record of anti-depressant prescribing, 124 was associated with higher crude incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) [20] and of a composite 125 macrovascular outcome [25]. However, lack of adjustment for age, sex and other factors that may 126 differ between groups limits conclusions from these studies. A third cohort study found that 127 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant prescribing was associated with 128 increased risk of 30-day post-stroke mortality [26], with the excess risk greatest for people whose 129 SSRI prescription was initiated shortly before stroke. A cross-sectional study of older men of low-130 income from one treatment centre reported greater odds of a composite cardiovascular morbidity 131 outcome and of MI specifically in crude analyses without control of confounding factors [30]. In 132 contrast, a cohort study with a median of 9.6 years follow-up derived from post-hoc analyses of a 133 clinical trial for a weight loss intervention [19] reported that antidepressant prescribing was 134 associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in women, but not men. Risk of 135 peripheral artery disease was reported to be similar in those with diabetes prescribed versus not 136 prescribed antidepressants [18]. Finally, the only cohort study to describe microvascular 137 complications reported higher crude incidence of a composite microvascular outcome in people 138 prescribed anti-depressants among a Taiwanese cohort of people newly treated for diabetes [25], 139 whilst a small cross-sectional study of people with a diagnosis of diabetes or with HbA1c 6.5% who 140 took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the US found that self-reported 141 antidepressant was associated with lower odds of retinopathy compared to people not reporting 142 anti-depressant use after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics [33] (Table 2). 143 Supplemental Table 5a includes details of additional results reported in some studies, including 144\nAll rights reserved.

Of the three cohort studies, two reported no statistically significant 149 difference in the association between antidepressant prescribing and optimal glycaemic control [21, 150 22]. The third study reported that antidepressant use was associated with lower risk of sub-optimal 151 glycaemic control [16]. Interestingly, a pre-post study reported lower HbA1c levels following 152 antidepressant medication initiation [27]. One cohort study also reported that receipt of 153 antidepressants was associated with increased odds of prescribing of glucose lowering drugs (GLDs) 154 [21]. Similarly, a case-control study found that among people with newly diagnosed diabetes, 155 current receipt of SSRI antidepressant prescriptions was associated with a more than two-fold 156 increased risk of insulin prescription [29]. Similar associations were observed for other 157 antidepressant classes and for other durations, with no associations observed for past prescriptions 158 (Table 2). A cross-sectional study among people from low-income areas found that antidepressant 159 prescribing from multiple classes was associated with higher values of HbA1c, after adjustment for 160 depression severity [31], whereas there was no association between individual antidepressant class 161 prescribing and HbA1c levels. 162 3.3.3 Lipid profile and lipid-lowering treatment 163 One cohort study found that antidepressant prescribing was associated with abnormal lipid profiles 164 or receipt of lipid-lowering medication [22], whereas a second reported that antidepressant 165 prescribing may have a small protective effect on cholesterol levels [21], with findings broadly 166 consistent by prescription timing and across antidepressant subtypes (Supplemental Table 5a). 167 3.4 Antipsychotic prescribing and diabetes outcomes 168 3.4.1 Diabetes complications 169\nAll rights reserved.

The two 170 studies that investigated the association between antipsychotic prescribing and clinical 171 complications of diabetes used population-based national registers [24, 32]. A cohort study of 172 people with schizophrenia found that, compared to no antipsychotic prescribing, regular 173 antipsychotic prescribing was associated with a 20% and 27% reduced risk of cardiovascular 174 morbidity, and all-cause mortality, respectively [24] (Table 3). There was no clear evidence of an 175 association between antipsychotics and microvascular complications. When stratifying by metabolic 176 risk of antipsychotics, the authors found that drugs considered to have an intermediate or high 177 metabolic risk were associated with a significantly reduced risk of all complications including 178 cardiovascular and microvascular morbidity (Supplemental Table 5b). 179 A second, cross-sectional, study found that the prevalence of retinopathy was lower in people who 180 had been prescribed antipsychotics for a total of more than 12 months than in a comparison group 181 matched for age, sex, diabetes type and duration, body mass index and smoking status that had not 182 been prescribed antipsychotics (Table 3) [32]. 183 Two studies reported a link between that antipsychotic prescribing and poorer glycaemic control 184 [23, 28], and one reported the opposite finding [32]. The only cohort study [23] found that receipt of 185 antipsychotic prescriptions within the first two years of diabetes diagnosis was associated with a 186 two-fold increased risk of first insulin prescription, which attenuated to a 30% increased risk after 187 adjustment for other drug prescriptions (Table 3). In a case-control study of older adults, receipt of 188 an antipsychotic prescription in the previous 180 days was associated with an increased risk of 189 hospitalisation for hyperglycaemia, regardless of diabetes medication type [28]. This effect was 190 strongest among those receiving a first prescription of antipsychotics (Table 3) and consistent across 191 antipsychotic subtypes (Supplemental Table 4b). In contrast, a cross-sectional study found that mean 192 HbA1c values were significantly lower in people prescribed antipsychotics for more than 12 months 193 in total than in those who never received antipsychotics [32]. 194 3.4.3 Other cardiovascular risk factors 195\nAll rights reserved.

Studies of associations 200 with microvascular complications and cardiometabolic factors other than glycaemic control and the 201 association between antipsychotic prescribing and any diabetes complication were particularly 202 limited. The published studies are highly heterogeneous, particularly in terms of the study 203 population, exposure definitions, and outcomes. Lack of comparability and study shortcomings 204 highlight key gaps and limit conclusions. Tentative conclusions are that, among people with diabetes, 205 antidepressant prescribing may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity or 206 mortality, and both antidepressant and antipsychotic prescribing may be linked to poorer glycaemic 207 control, but the evidence is very mixed. 208 4.1 Strengths and limitations 209 To the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review of observational studies reporting 210 associations between antidepressant or antipsychotic drug prescribing and complications, mortality, 211 or cardiometabolic risk factors in people with diabetes. Other strengths include our use of a detailed 212 and comprehensive search strategy applied to three bibliographic databases, independent screening 213 and data extraction by two reviewers, and assessment of study quality. 214 A limitation of this review is the exclusion of outcomes related to weight changes and obesity, that 215 have previously been linked to antidepressant and antipsychotic use [34, 35], as these outcomes 216 were beyond the scope of our review. Also beyond our scope were studies which reported on 217 progression of diabetes complications or compared prescribing of one psychotropic drug versus 218 another. The latter is particularly important when investigating adverse effects of antidepressant 219 and antipsychotic prescribing in people with SMI, where given the clinical need to prescribe, 220 comparison of type of medication becomes more important than comparison of use versus non-use. 221\nAll rights reserved.

Many of these have 224 insufficient control of confounding factors, including lifestyle behaviours, socioeconomic status, and 225 critically, confounding by indication, particularly for mental illness. It is difficult to estimate how the 226 latter might have affected estimates with potential bias in both directions. Mental illness is 227 associated with higher risk of poor diabetes outcomes [36-38], partly through higher prevalence of 228 unhealthy lifestyle factors, including overweight/obesity, lower socioeconomic status [39], poorer 229 treatment adherence, and in some settings, receipt of sub-optimal care [39]. Conversely, in other 230 settings, people with comorbid mental illness and diabetes may be more likely than people with 231 diabetes without mental illness to receive optimal routine monitoring of certain care indicators [40], 232 perhaps due to more frequent visits to their primary care practitioner [41]. 233 Although ascertainment of prescriptions through electronic records minimises information bias and 234 loss to follow-up, prescribing records do not reflect actual drug use. For studies where exposure 235 status was identified using interviews or assessment visits, this information may be subject to social 236 desirability and recall biases. Misclassifying people as exposed, either where people do not take 237 drugs as prescribed or fail to disclose the drugs prescribed, would weaken effect estimates. Similarly, 238 electronic records often only include outcomes resulting in hospitalisation and may also be subject 239 to misclassification bias. 240 Some studies had low precision due to small sample sizes, which affects interpretation of effect 241 estimates, especially for less common microvascular complications, as well as for the investigation of 242 differences by drug subtypes. 243 Finally, in anticipation of limited evidence, we included cross-sectional studies in our review. It is 244 however possible that diabetes complications increase the risk of a person developing mental illness, 245 such as depression [36], and in turn the likelihood of being prescribed antidepressant or 246 antipsychotic medications. 247\nAll rights reserved.

These contrasting findings may 251 reflect key differences in associations for different population sub-groups. Indeed, pooled results of 252 only studies including people with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease similarly found that 253 antidepressant use/prescribing was associated with a statistically non-significant reduced risk of 254 cardiovascular morbidity [42]. Systematic reviews of trials suggest that SSRI use can improve short-255 term glycaemic control in people with diabetes [13, 14]. Some of the observational studies we 256 identified found similar results but others found no differences in glycaemic control between groups, 257 perhaps related to study population, design, sample size and approaches to control of confounding. 258 4.3 Interpretation of findings: antipsychotics 259 Our review revealed the sparse evidence on antipsychotic prescribing and diabetes outcomes. 260 Although based on just one cohort study [24], the association between antipsychotic prescribing and 261 lower mortality risk in people with schizophrenia and diabetes aligns with findings on antipsychotic 262 use and lower long-term mortality in people with schizophrenia [43, 44] and short-term mortality in 263 the general population [45]. However, in contrast to previous reports of a link between antipsychotic 264 use and increased risk of cardiovascular disease in general populations [10, 46], this cohort study 265 found the opposite. Although counter-intuitive, given their adverse metabolic and cardiovascular 266 effects [8, 34, 47], antipsychotic use alongside psychological support in people with SMI may 267 improve physical and psychosocial functioning, thereby improving lifestyle and compliance with 268 diabetes care and treatment, which in turn could reduce risk of diabetes complications. . The few 269 studies on antipsychotic prescribing suggest an association with increased risk of poorer glycaemic 270 control, which aligns with established adverse glycaemic effects of some antipsychotics [48]. 271 4.4 Implications 272\nAll rights reserved.

There are 274 major gaps that should be addressed in future research in order to inform clinical practice. The 275 increased use of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications in the general population is 276 concerning given the evident lack of understanding of potential for adverse effects and increasing 277 prevalence of diabetes. The striking gap in the evidence on antipsychotic drug prescribing in relation 278 to diabetes outcomes in particular should be urgently addressed. Antidepressant and antipsychotic 279 drugs are an essential component of the treatment of mental health conditions, and timely 280 treatment in people with diabetes is crucial, given the poor diabetes outcomes for people with both 281 diabetes and mental ill health [49]. It is therefore important to establish treatment-associated risks 282 of diabetes outcomes within population sub-groups to inform and enhance drug prescribing and 283 monitoring practices for diabetes and its complications. To improve upon existing studies and 284 advance our understanding, future studies should: be well-powered (particularly to investigate 285 differences); include information on mental illness, lifestyle, and other confounding factors; 286 distinguish between drug subtypes; assess whether and how risk changes over time; and consider 287 the potential effects of cumulative exposures. 288 4.5 Conclusions 289 Few studies have described the association between antidepressant and antipsychotic medications 290 and diabetes outcomes, with shortcomings and mixed findings limiting the ability to draw 291 conclusions. While future research addresses this evidence gap, clinicians, including diabetologists, 292 primary care practitioners, and where appropriate, psychiatrists, should attempt to ensure regular 293 monitoring of cardiometabolic risk factors and early indicators of complications in people with 294 diabetes who are being treated with antidepressant or antipsychotic medication (irrespective of 295 indication). 296 297\nAll rights reserved.
