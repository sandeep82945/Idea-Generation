    "abstractText": "Semidefinite programs are optimization methods with a wide array of applications, such as approximating difficult combinatorial problems. One such semidefinite program is the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, a popular integer relaxation technique. We introduce a variational quantum algorithm for the GoemansWilliamson algorithm that uses only n+1 qubits, a constant number of circuit preparations, and poly(n) expectation values in order to approximately solve semidefinite programs with up to N = 2n variables and M \u223c O(N) constraints. Efficient optimization is achieved by encoding the objective matrix as a properly parameterized unitary conditioned on an auxilary qubit, a technique known as the Hadamard Test. The Hadamard Test enables us to optimize the objective function by estimating only a single expectation value of the ancilla qubit, rather than separately estimating exponentially many expectation values. Similarly, we illustrate that the semidefinite programming constraints can be effectively enforced by implementing a second Hadamard Test, as well as imposing a polynomial number of Pauli string amplitude constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by devising an efficient quantum implementation of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for various NP-hard problems, including MaxCut. Our method exceeds the performance of analogous classical methods on a diverse subset of well-studied MaxCut problems from the GSet library.",

One such semidefinite program is the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, a popular integer relaxation technique. We introduce a variational quantum algorithm for the GoemansWilliamson algorithm that uses only n+1 qubits, a constant number of circuit preparations, and poly(n) expectation values in order to approximately solve semidefinite programs with up to N = 2n variables and M \u223c O(N) constraints. Efficient optimization is achieved by encoding the objective matrix as a properly parameterized unitary conditioned on an auxilary qubit, a technique known as the Hadamard Test. The Hadamard Test enables us to optimize the objective function by estimating only a single expectation value of the ancilla qubit, rather than separately estimating exponentially many expectation values. Similarly, we illustrate that the semidefinite programming constraints can be effectively enforced by implementing a second Hadamard Test, as well as imposing a polynomial number of Pauli string amplitude constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by devising an efficient quantum implementation of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for various NP-hard problems, including MaxCut. Our method exceeds the performance of analogous classical methods on a diverse subset of well-studied MaxCut problems from the GSet library. Taylor L. Patti: taylorpatti@g.harvard.edu"

A versatile technique, SDP can be used to approximately solve a variety of problems, including combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., NPhard problems, whose computational complexity grows exponentially in problem size) [2], and is heavily used in fields such as operations research, computer hardware design, and networking [3, 4]. In many such cases, semidefinite programs (SDPs) are integer programming relaxations, meaning that the original objective function of integer variables is reformed as a function of continuous vector variables [5], such as the Goemans-Williamson algorithm [6]. This allows the SDP to explore a convex approximation of the problem. Although such solutions are only approximate, SDPs are useful because they can be efficiently solved with a variety of techniques. These include interior-point methods, which typically run in polynomial-time in the number of problem variables N and constraints M [7]. In recent years, more efficient versions of these classical methods have been developed [8, 9].\nAn additional advantage of optimization with SDPs is that many have performance guarantees in the form of approximation ratios. Approximation ratios are a provable worst-case ratio between the value obtained by an approximation algorithm and the ground truth global optimum [10]. In short, SDPs represent an often favorable compromise between computational complexity\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.

A variety of quantum SDP algorithms (QSDPs) that sample n-qubit Gibbs states to solve SDPs with up to N = 2n variables and M \u223c O(N) constraints have been devised [19\u2013 23] (Table 1), as have methods for approximately preparing Gibbs states with near-term variational quantum computers [25\u201327]. The former of these\nalgorithms are based on the Arora-Kale method [28] and provide up to a quadratic speedup in N and M . However, they scale significantly poorer in terms of various algorithm parameters, such as accuracy, and are not suitable for nearterm quantum computers. Quantum interiorpoint methods have also been proposed [29, 30], in close analogy to the leading family of classical techniques.\nVariational methods have long played a role in\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 2\nquantum optimization protocols [31] (Table 1), such as adiabatic computation [12\u201314], annealing [15, 16], the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [17], and Boson Sampling [18]. However, only recently have variational QSDPs been proposed [24, 32]. Patel et al [24] addresses the same optimization problems as the quantum Arora-Kale and interior-point based methods, but instead uses variational quantum circuits, which are more feasible in the near-term. Like other SDPs, this method offers specific performance guarantees in the form of approximation ratios [10]. While exact methods are efficient for some SDPs, for worst-case problems (e.g., problems with a large number of constraints M , such as MaxCut) they may require the estimation of up to O(2n) observables per training epoch. Although it has been demonstrated that solving NP-hard optimization problems on variational quantum devices does not mitigate their exponential overhead, problems such as MaxCut may still retain APX hardness and are upper bounded by the same approximation ratio of classical methods [33]. Likewise, while parameterized quantum circuits can form Haar random 2- designs that result in barren plateaus [34], numerous methods of avoiding, mitigating, or and perturbing these systems to effectuate a more trainable space have been developed [35\u201337].\nOur Approach: We propose a new variational quantum algorithm for approximately solving QSDPs that uses Hadamard Test objective functions and Approximate Amplitude Constraints (HTAAC-QSDP, Fig. 1).\nTheorem 1 HTAAC-QSDP for the GoemansWilliamson algorithm uses n+1 qubits, a constant number of quantum measurements, and O(poly(n)) classical calculations to approximate SDPs with up to N = 2n variables.\nThe details of the HTAAC-QSDP implementation must be engineered to each SDP and, in this work, we focus on the Goemans-Williamson algorithm [6], with particular emphasis on its application to MaxCut. In some cases, our method is nearly an exponential reduction in required expectation values, e.g., for high-constraint problems such as MaxCut. As described in Sec. 2, we achieve this, in part, through a unitary objective function encoding with the Hadamard Test [38] (Fig. 1a), which allows for the extremization of the entire N -dimensional objective by estimating only a single quantum expectation value (Fig. 1c). Our quantum Goemans-Williamson algorimth for MaxCut requires M = N \u2264 2n amplitude constraints, which we effectively enforce with only 1) a constant number of quantum measurements from a second Hadamard Test (Fig. 1b) and 2) the estimation of a polynomial number of properly selected, commuting Pauli strings (Fig. 1d).\nIn Sec. 3, we demonstrate the success of the HTAAC-QSDP Goemans-Williamson algorithm (Algorithm 1) by approximating MaxCut [39] for large-scale graphs from the well-studied GSet graph library [40] (Fig. 5). In addition to satisfying the 0.878 MaxCut approximation ratio [6], HTAAC-QSDP achieves cut values that are commensurate with the leading gradient-based classical SDP solvers [41], implying that we reach op-\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 3\ntima that are very near the global optimum of these SDP objective functions.\nFinally, in Sec. 4.1 we discuss the feasibility of the Hadamard encoding. For general SDPs, we establish an upper bound (Theorem 2) on the phase \u03b1 of our Hadamard encoding, such that our technique is a high-quality approximation of the original SDP. The purpose of this upper bound is to demonstrate that tractably large values of the unitary phase \u03b1 are permissible (i.e., \u03b1 need not become arbitrarily small) for encoding a wide variety of large-scale problems. We discuss the known difficulty, and thus usefulness, of graph optimization problems under these conditions. Specifically:\nTheorem 2 Our approximate Hadamard Test objective function UW \u223c i\u03b1W (Sec. 2.1) holds for graphs with randomly distributed edges if\n\u03b12 \u2272 N4\ne3 = N \u03be3 ,\nwhere e is the number of non-zero edge weights and \u03be is the average number of edges per vertex.\nWe can view the criteria of Theorem 2 in two ways: for SDPs with arbitrarily many variables N , the size of \u03b1 can be kept reasonably large while the Hadamard Test objective function (see Sec. 2.1) remains valid as long as 1) N does not grow slower than the total number of edges e, or 2) N does not grow slower than the the cube of \u03be. Both of these conditions hold for graphs that are not too dense, meaning that they are widely satisfiable. For instance, the majority of interesting and demonstrably difficult graphs for\nMaxCut are relatively sparse [10, 39, 40, 42, 43]. We note that for graphs where edge-density is unevenly distributed, Theorem 2 should hold for the densest region of the graph, i.e., \u03be should be the average number of edges per vertex for the most highly connected vertices."

We generate these quantum ensembles \u03c1 from an initial density matrix \u03c10 such that \u03c1 = UV \u03c10U \u2020V , where UV is a variational quantum circuit. This yields the quantum objective function\nminimize \u27e8W,\u03c1\u27e9 = Tr [W\u03c1] .

In the case of pure states, Eq. 3 yields\nminimize \u27e8\u03c8|W |\u03c8\u27e9. (4)\nThe Hadamard Test (Fig. 1c) is a quantum computing subroutine for arbitrary n-qubit states |\u03c8\u27e9 and n-qubit unitaries U [38]. It allows the real or imaginary component of the 2n-state inner product \u27e8\u03c8|U |\u03c8\u27e9 to be obtained by estimating only a single expectation value \u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9, which is the z-axis Pauli spin on the n+1th (auxiliary) qubit. For example, to obtain the imaginary component of \u27e8\u03c8|U |\u03c8\u27e9, we prepare the quantum state |\u03c8\u27e9\u2297 1\u221a2(|0\u27e9\u2212i|1\u27e9) and apply a controlled-U from the n+1th qubit to |\u03c8\u27e9, followed by a Hadamard gate on the n+1th qubit. This produces the state\n1 2 [(I \u2212 iU)|\u03c8\u27e9 \u2297 |0\u27e9 + (I + iU)|\u03c8\u27e9 \u2297 |1\u27e9] (5)\nupon which projective measurement yields\n\u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9 = Im [\u27e8\u03c8|U |\u03c8\u27e9] . (6)\nRather than estimate the N \u2264 2n expectation values required to characterize \u03c1 and optimize the loss function of Eq. 3, our method encodes the N -dimensional objective matrix W as the imaginary part of an n-qubit unitary UW = exp(i\u03b1W ) (Fig. 1a). Here, the phase \u03b1 is a constant scalar. UW is then conditioned on the n+1th (or auxilary) qubit as a controlled-unitary. We then use the Hadamard Test to calculate the objective term in the loss function\n\u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9W = Im [\u27e8\u03c8|UW |\u03c8\u27e9] = Im [\u27e8UW , \u03c1\u27e9] . (7)\nThe intuition for this objective function is that, for sufficiently small \u03b1, Im[UW ] \u2248 \u03b1W . By restricting ourselves to quantum circuits with realvalued output states, we render the single expectation value \u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9W proportional to the objective function of Eq. 3, which requires N expectation values to estimate. In Sec. 4.1, we analytically prove that, for many optimization problems, \u03b1 has a practical upper bound such that Im[UW ] \u2248 \u03b1W with a reasonably large \u03b1, even for arbitrarily large W ."

The Goemans-Williamson algorithm is also applicable to to numerous other optimization problems, such as MaxSat and Max Directed Cut [6].\nFor a MaxCut problem with N vertices vi, vj , let W be the matrix that encodes the up to N(N \u2212 1)/2 non-zero edge weights in its entries Wij . As the vertices lack self-interaction, Wii = 0. The optimization problem is then defined as\nmaximize \u2211 j<i Wij 1 \u2212 vivj 2\nsubject to vi = \u00b11, (8)\nwhich can be mapped to the classical SDP with M = N constraints\nminimizeX\u2208S+ \u27e8W,X\u27e9 subject to Xii = 1, \u2200i \u2264 N.\n(9)\nAs described by Eq. 3, we can transform the optimization portion of Eq. 9 by substituting the classical positive semidefinite matrix X for the quantum density operator \u03c1. The solution to the SDP is then stored in |\u03c8\u27e9, i.e., vi = sign(\u03c8i) (for more details, see Sec. 2.3). As detailed in Sec. 2.1, the evaluation of this objective function can be optimized by estimating a single expectation value with the Hadamard Test. Likewise, we now introduce a quantum alternative to the constraint Xii = 1 from Eq. 9. First, note that due to the orthonormality of quantum states, the exact quantum equivalent of Eq. 9 is\n\u03c1ii = 1/2n \u2264 N\u22121. (10)\nThis rescaling changes neither the effectiveness nor the guarantees of the semidefinite program, because the salient feature of the constraint is that all of the quantum states have the same amplitude magnitude |\u03c8i|, such that all of the vertices are of equal magnitude and none are disproportionately favored. The solutions \u03c1 and X differ only by a constant factor, such that \u03c1 = X/2n. This yields the quantum MaxCut SDP\nminimize \u27e8W,\u03c1\u27e9 subject to \u03c1ii = 2\u2212n, \u2200i \u2264 N.\n(11)\nAs graph weights are real-valued and symmetric (i.e., Wij = Wji), W is Hermitian. We can thus use it as the generator of UW such that (Fig. 1a)\nUW = exp(i\u03b1W ) = \u2211\nl\n(i\u03b1)l\nl! W l\n= I + i\u03b11!W \u2212 \u03b12 2! W 2 \u2212 i\u03b1 3 3! W 3 + O(W 4).\n(12)\nAs W is real, the odd powers of l in Eq. 12 are the imaginary components. The condition that Im[UW ] \u221d W is upheld iff, for the vast majority of variables i, j, \u03b1Wij \u226b \u03b1 3 6 (W 3)ij . Note that, when this condition holds, \u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9W approximates \u27e8W \u27e9 with only vanishing error and a rescaling by \u03b1. In Sec. 4.1, we prove Theorem 2, demonstrating that this condition is achievable with a tractable \u03b1 (i.e., \u03b1 larger than some fixed finite value that is constant in problem size N) for a wide variety of graphs.\nNext, we note that enforcing the M = N \u2264 2n amplitude constraints \u03c1ii = 2\u2212n, i \u2264 N would require the estimation of all z-axis Pauli strings of order k \u2264 n (all Pauli strings with k \u2264 n Pauli-z operators) of the state |\u03c8\u27e9. This would be a total of N \u2212 1 expectation values. As an alternative to this large overhead, HTAAC-QSDP proposes the use of Approximate Amplitude Constraints (Fig. 1d). For example, consider the set of m = n(n \u2212 1)/2 + n \u223c n2/2 Pauli strings of length k \u2264 2\n\u27e8\u03c3za, \u03c1\u27e9 = 0, \u2200a \u2264 n \u27e8\u03c3za\u03c3zb , \u03c1\u27e9 = 0, \u2200b \u0338= a, a, b \u2264 n,\n(13)\nwhere \u03c3za are the Pauli z-operators on the ath qubit. We can use these equalities as partial constraints for the n-qubit output state |\u03c8\u27e9. This set of m \u223c n2/2 constraints approximates the same restrictions as the set of M = N constraints of Eq. 11 by limiting quantum correlations, as these indicate subsets of states with unequal populations. That is, each such z-axis Pauli string is the difference of the total populations of two equal partitions of state space. To gain intuition, let us consider a two-qubit state |\u03c8\u27e9 = [\u03c800, \u03c801, \u03c810, \u03c811]T and the k = 1 Pauli string \u03c3z0 \u2297 I. Using the constraints for Eq. 13, we enforce the equality |\u03c800|2 + |\u03c801|2 = |\u03c810|2 + |\u03c811|2\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.

The highest known MaxCut values (CMAX, found by intensive heursitics [44]) are greater the highest results obtained by the classical method (max(CSDP)), but the approximation ratio max(CSDP)/CMAX > 0.878 is satisfied. The largest cut values of our HTAAC-QSDP Goemans-Williamson algorithm (max(CQ)) are comparable with max(CSDP), as are the average results (mean(CQ)).\nGraph CMAX max(CSDP) max(CQ)/max(CSDP) mean(CQ)/max(CSDP) G11 564 542 0.967 0.940 G12 556 540 0.982 0.953 G13 582 564 0.972 0.933 G14 3064 2922 1.011 1.000 G15 3050 2938 1.009 0.996 G20 941 838 1.007 0.983 G21 931 841 1.001 0.978\nwhich, while not fully enforcing the constraints of Eq. 11 (e.g., not enforcing that all states have equal populations), does enforce equal populations among a subset of states. This results in a lighter-weight and more flexible set of constraints. As an example, \u03c3z0 \u2297 I promotes all state components to be populated by disallowing states where the first qubit is in a computational basis state, such as |00\u27e9 or 1\u221a2(|00\u27e9 + |01\u27e9). Likewise, the k = 2, z-axis Pauli string \u03c3z0 \u2297 \u03c3z1 constraint produces the equality |\u03c800|2 + |\u03c811|2 = |\u03c801|2 + |\u03c810|2, which would, for example, disallow the Bell State (|00\u27e9+ |11\u27e9)/ \u221a 2. We highlight that the Pauli string constraints of Eq. 13 are commuting, such that they can be estimated as m different marginal distributions from a single set of n-qubit z-axis measurements.\nWe again emphasize that these k \u2264 2 constraints only approximately enforce the SDP constraint \u03c1ii = 2\u2212n. Fully satisfying this constraint would require restricting Pauli-z correlations between any subset of the n qubits, such that no states of unequal amplitude magnitudes are permitted. Eq. 10 can be fully satisfied if we constrain |\u03c8\u27e9 with all of the Pauli strings of length k \u2264 n. However, as there exist n choose k z-axis Pauli strings of order k, this requires estimating\u2211n\nk=1 ( nk ) = 2n \u2212 1 different expectation values and greatly decreases the efficiency of the algorithm. Sec. 3 details that, in practice for 800- vertex graphs, competitive results are obtained using only k \u2264 2 constraint terms (Fig. 2 and Table 2), and optimization performance is largely saturated with terms k \u2264 4 (Fig. 4 and Table 3).\nIn order to explicitly see how the m \u223c n2/2 constraints of Eq. 13 largely enforce the con-\nFigure 3: The cut value estimated by quantum observables \u27e8CQ\u27e9 obtained by HTAAC-QSDP vs the true SDP rounded cut value CQ for the G11 (toroid), G14 (binary), and G20 (integer) graphs.

However, it still permits a small subset of states that do not satisfy Eq. 10 due to three-qubit correlations, e.g.,\n|\u03c8\u2217\u27e9 = 12 [ \u00b11, 0, 0,\u00b11, 0,\u00b11,\u00b11, 0 ]T .\nStates with higher-order correlations such as |\u03c8\u2217\u27e9, which neither satisfy Eq. 10 nor are disallowed by Eq. 13, can be avoided by adding higher-order Pauli string constraints. For the above n = 3 example, we would add the k = n = 3 constraint \u27e8\u03c3z1\u03c3z2\u03c3z3 , \u03c1\u27e9 = 0, which would disallow |\u03c8\u2217\u27e9 as \u27e8\u03c3z1\u03c3z2\u03c3z3 , \u03c1\u2217\u27e9 = 1.\nEq. 10 can also be systematically undermined by the unequal distribution of graph edges among the quantum states. For instance, the asymmetrically distributed edge-weights in skewed graphs (Fig. 5 left and Sec. 3). With such graphs, the minimization of the loss function can lead to outsized state populations for quantum states that encode high-degree (high edge-weight) vertices. Moreover, as the number of classical variables will not generally be a power of two, there will often be quantum states that are not encoded with a classical variable. For example and as detailed in Sec. 3, we use n = 10 qubits (2n = 1024 states) to optimize the 800-vertex (N = 800) GSet graphs, such that the states 801 to 1024 are absent from the objective function. In such cases, the minimization of the loss function can lead to outsized state populations of quantum states that are present in the optimization function. In principle, these imbalances can be addressed by increasing\nthe magnitude of the Pauli string amplitude constraints, but this is known to cause poor objective function convergence [46].\nTo redress this systematic skew, we add a population-balancing unitary UP (Fig. 1b), which is implemented on |\u03c8\u27e9 via a second Hadamard Test (Sec. 2.1, Fig. 1c) and adds the loss function term \u27e8\u03c3n+1\u27e9P . Specifically, UP = exp(i\u03b2P ) where P is some diagonal operator of edge weights Pii = \u2212(Pmax \u2212 \u2211 j |\u03c9ij |), where \u03b2 is an adjustable hyperparameter and Pmax = maxi( \u2211 j |\u03c9ij |) is the maximum magnitude of edge weights for any given vertex.

Like in other QSDP protocols, |\u03c8\u27e9 may either be used to extract the full N - variable solution or for less computationally intensive analysis (i.e., to characterize the features of the solution or as an input state for further quantum protocols). For many SDPs, such as MaxCut, a good approximation of the solution (here, cut value) can also be extracted from the expectation values comprising the cost function.\nTo extract this approximate cut value, we note that Eq. 8 can be rewritten as\nWsum 2 \u2212 1 2min( \u2211 j<i Wijvivj), (16)\nwhereWsum = \u2211\nj<iWij .

Alternatively, the element-wise rounded cut value calculated using Eq. 21 can still be utilized as an approximation to the traditional GoemansWilliamson rounding scheme. Although it would not result in the typical inner-product rounding, the sign of each vertex could still defined as the relative sign between each \u03c8i and \u03c80.\nThis mixed state formalism of the HTAACQSDP Goemans-Williamson algorithm works not only in principle, but also in practice.

We compare CQ, the cut values obtained by HTAAC-QSDP, to max(CSDP ), the best results obtained by the leading gradient-based classical method [41]. We study all of the 800- vertex MaxCut problems explored in [41] (Table 2) in order to make an extensive comparison with the leading classical gradient-based interior point method. These graphs represent a\nbroad sampling from the well-studied GSet graph library [40]. Graphs G11, G12, and G13 have vertices that are connected to nearest-neighbors on a toroid structure and \u00b11 weights (Fig 5, right), while G14 and G15 (G20 and G21) have binary weights 0 and 1 (integer weights \u00b11) and randomly distributed edge density that is highly skewed towards the lower numbered vertices (Fig 5, left).\nHTAAC-QSDP with k \u2264 2-Pauli term constraints exceeds the performance of its classical counterpart on skewed binary and skewed integer graphs, and falls narrowly short of classical performance on toroid graphs (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The slight differences between the HTAAC-QSDP solution quality and those of the classical solver are typical of comparing different SDP solvers, which often differ slightly in their answers due to different numerical factors, including sparsity tolerance, rounding conventions (especially in the context of degenerate SDP solutions), and other hyperparameters [56]. All trajectories converge above the 0.878-approximation ratio CQ/Cmax (dashed red line) guaranteed by classical semidefinite programming, where Cmax is the highest known cut of each graph found by intensive, multi-shot, classical heuristics [44]. As SDPs are approximations of the optimization problem, the extremization of the loss function and the figure of merit (here, cut value) are highly correlated, particularly for well-enforced constraints. Fig. 3 demonstrates the strong correlation between the cut values estimated by quantum observables \u27e8CQ\u27e9 (Eq. 19) and the fully rounded SDP result CQ, indicating that the HTAAC-QSDP Goemans-Williamson algorithm measurement of few quantum observables closely approximates the rounded and composited cut values of all variables.\nThe addition of Pauli string amplitude constraints with k > 2 can better enforce Eq. 10, leading to higher-quality solutions to the SDPs.

Note that, in the absence of the competing objective function (\u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9W ) dynamics, all Pauliz correlations become restricted as k \u2192 n. This results in the complete constraint |\u03c8i| = N\u22121/2, \u2200i, such that \u03c3\u03c1 \u2192 0 (black dashed line in Fig. 4, left). We can understand this behavior in the context of other penalty methods [57]. In particular, consider the penalty methods formulation q(t, \u03bb) = f(xt)+\u03bbtg(xt), where in our case xt are the time-dependent optimized parameters, f(xt) = \u27e8\u03c3zn+1\u27e9W,t, and g(xt) represents the constraints. In the limits t \u2192 \u221e and \u03bbt \u2192 \u221e, it is known that xt \u2192 x, where x is the fully enforced solution of the hard constraints in some neighborhood of x0 [58]. That is, the constraint-only dynamics (black dashed line of Fig. 4) represents the solution quality with respect to constraints in the \u03bbt \u2192 \u221e limit.\nThe HTAAC-QSDP Goemans-Williamson algorithm was also tested against the G81 graph, a 20,000 vertex graph with a similar structure to G11-G13, and which is the largest MaxCut graph available that has been benchmarked against classical SDP methods. The average ratio between the HTAAC-QSDP obtained cut value for G81 and that of the classical counterpart was within 1% of the 800-vertex toroid graphs tested (ratio of 0.93). While the requisite circuit-depth for some\nquantum objective functions is known to grow linearly with the size of the circuit\u2019s Hilbert space [59], this has not been shown for objective functions of the form of Eq. 15. This is in agreement with our observation that, while Hilbert space required to solve the G81 graphs is 32 times larger than that for G11-G21, it\u2019s circuit-depth is < 8 times larger. This reduction in requisite circuitdepth could also be due to the influence of constraints, which may effectively limit the degrees of freedom of the quantum circuit, a phenomenon that has been referred to as a \u201cHamiltonian informed\u201d model [59].\nThat being said, even if the worst-case exponential bounds for quantum optimization were saturated, that would not preclude them from having lesser overhead than classical SDPs. We note that classically solving an NP-hard problem of 2n variables is exponentially hard with respect to the 2n variables (that is, it scales as O(22n)) and that, while these problems can be classically approximated using polynomial time and memory with respect to the number of variables, this still yields a classical complexity \u223c polynomial(2n). For instance, the leading classical techniques, interior point methods [56], have a memory cost that scales as O(N4) \u223c O(24n) and a computational cost that scales as O(N2) \u223c O(22n), making them in fact less efficient than the exponential bounds put on some worst-case quantum objective functions of O(2n/2) = O(2n\u22121) \u223c O(2n) memory cost and O(2n\u22121) \u223c O(2n) computational cost, a quartic and quadratic reduction, respectively.\nEven among the lighter-weight yet often less powerful first-order methods, the classical overhead is considerable. For example, the popular branch of projection-based methods has arithmetic and memory complexity of O(23n) and O(22n), respectively, for such 2n variable problems [60]. Alternative algorithms, such as the Arora-Kale algorithm, can have time complexity as efficient as O\u0303(M) [61], although for problems such as MaxCut this still reduces to O\u0303(2n)). On a similar topic of scale, we note that G81 was optimized with constraints of orders k \u2264 4, which results in a similar ratio of approximate to exact constraints as that of smaller experiments.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.

We again note that Theorem 2 should hold for the\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.

As the conditions of Theorem 2 hold for graphs that are not too dense, they are widely satisfiable as the majority of interesting and demonstrably difficult graphs for MaxCut are relatively sparse [10, 39, 40, 42, 43]. Many classes of graphs for which MaxCut is NP-hard satisfy Theorem 2 with tractably large \u03b1, even for arbitrarily large N .\nAs an example, we consider non-planar graphs, for which optimization problems like MaxCut are typically NP-complete. While planar graphs can be solved in polynomial time [66], a graph is guaranteeably non-planar when e > 3N \u2212 6, which reduces to \u03be \u2265 3 in the limit of large N [67]2. In accordance with Theorem 2, constant values of \u03be actually permit \u03b1 to grow as N1/2, while for constant \u03b1 \u03be can grow as N1/3, such that our approximation is valid for a wide variety of large-scale non-planar graphs. Indeed, most standard benchmarking graph sets have a small average number of edges per vertex, e.g., \u03be = 3 [40, 42, 43], as sparse edge-density is common among graphs with real-world applications. In fact, solving MaxCut with many classes of dense graphs (i.e., graphs with nearly all non-zero edges) is provably less challenging, and therefore less interesting, than with their relatively sparse counterparts [69].\nWe here sketch a brief proof of Theorem 2 for Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs [70] with edge weights Wij \u223c U[0,b], where U[0,b] is the uniform distribution on the interval [0, b]. The edge density of a graph is described as d = e/E, where e is the number of non-zero edges e and E = N(N \u2212 1)/2 is the number of total possible edges. We provide a detailed proof of this and other graph types in the Appendix A.\nProof sketch of Theorem 2:\n\u2022 The Hadamard Test encoding is a good approximation when UW \u221d i\u03b1W .\n\u2022 This is satisfied when \u03b1 3 3! |W 3|ij \u226a \u03b11! |W |ij\nfor typical edges between vertices i,j.\n2Other families of easy graphs are even more restrictive, such as graphs that lack a giant component. In the limit of large N , these graphs only occur in more than a negligible fraction of all possible graphs when d \u2265 1/N and thus \u03be \u2265 1/2 [68].\n\u2022 The mean of the non-zero elements in W is Wij = b/2 3.\n\u2022 Elements (W 3)ij are the sum of \u223c N2 terms WijWjkWkl, with expectation value WijWjkWkl = b3d3/8. That is, the additive error between the Hadamard encoding terms and the matrix elements Wij scales as b3d3/8.\n\u2022 \u03b1 3\n3! (W 3)ij \u226a \u03b1 1!Wij \u2192 \u03b1 2 \u226a 24/(N2b2d3).\n\u2022 Substituting d = 2e/N(N \u2212 1) \u2248 2e/N2 and \u03be = e/N , we obtain Theorem 2."

            "text": "While some optimization problems of O(2n) variables may only be represented by graphs W of O(4n) distinct Pauli strings, we here illustrate that there are many interesting (indeed, NP-hard optimization problems) for which this is not the case. In particular, we focus on the MaxCut problem and discuss toroid and Erdos Renyi random graphs.\nToroid graphs, or graphs that can be embedded on a toroid such that none of the edges connecting vertices cross, have a regular, yet still threedimensional (non-planar), topological structure [71]. While encoding difficult problems, these data sets can often be represented in just poly(n) Pauli strings, as is the case with the 8-100 tourus family to which G11 pertains (Fig. 6, right, gray). What is more, the number of Pauli strings can be reduced even further by instead constructing an approximate operator Wapprox and permitting a small amount of error |Wapprox\u2212W |/|W | \u2264 0.015 (Fig. 6, right, red). The population balancing graphs P are a similar subset of structured graphs, whose diagonality renders them expressible with Pauli strings of only z-axis and identity gates.\nLikewise, we can use similarly few terms to construct Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs, in which edges between any two vertices are equally likely and occur with probability p [70]. As Pauli strings are a spanning set, these same statistics are replicated when such strings are chosen randomly. Moreover, we note that each Pauli string\n3The mean value of all elements of W is Wij \u2032 = db/2, however the relevant comparison is between the elements of W 3 and the non-zero elements of W .\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.

            "heading": "4.3 Construction of Controlled Unitaries",
            "text": "The construction of unitary rotations UW and UP follows naturally from ZX calculus [72]. Specifically, Pauli Gadgets can be used to generalize unitary rotations from the qubit to which they are applied to multiple qubits through the use of O(n) CNOT gates, one on either size of each qubit and its rotated counterparts in a conjugated ladder scheme [73]. Moreover, rotations along distinct Pauli axes are achieved by conjugating these qubits with \u03c0/2 rotation gates along said axis. The gates are selected to match the terms of W or P and \u03b1 is the phase applied.\nAs this method generalizes to all rotations, it can also be paired with the controlled gates required for the Hadamard Test. Specifically, the Pauli rotation gate applied to the auxiliaryadjacent qubit is fashioned as a controlled rotation, with the control conditioned on the auxiliary qubit. Moreover, the small values of \u03b1 used in this work make the addition of multiple Pauli terms by Trotterization favorable, as the error of this technique is bounded by \u03b12/2 times the spectral norm [74]."

            "heading": "5 Conclusion",
            "text": "The efficient optimization of very large-scale SDPs on variational quantum devices has to the potential to revolutionize their use in operations, computer architecture, and networking applications. In this manuscript, we have introduced HTAAC-QSDP, which uses n + 1 qubits to approximate SDPs of up to N = 2n variables and M \u223c O(N) constraints by taking only a constant number of quantum measurements and a polynomial number of classical calculations per epoch. As we approximately encode the SDP objective function into a unitary operator, the Hadamard Test can be used to optimize arbitrarily large SDPs by estimating a constant number of expectation values. Likewise, we demonstrate that the constraints of many SDPs can also be efficiently enforced with approximate amplitude constraints.\nDevising a quantum implementation of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, we approxi-\nmately enforce the M = 2n constraints with a population-balancing Hadamard Test and the estimation of as few as m \u223c n2/2 Pauli string expectation values. We demonstrate our method on a wide array of graphs from the GSet library [40], approaching and often exceeding the performance of the leading gradient-based classical SDP solver on all graphs [41]. Finally, we note that by increasing the order k of our Pauli string constraints, we improve the accuracy of our results, exceeding the classical performance on all graphs while still estimating only polynomiallymany expectation values.\nThe approximate amplitude constraints of HTAAC-QSDP make it particularly helpful for problems with a large number of constraints M . The benefits of using the Hadamard Test objective function depend on the original optimization problem. The optimization matrix of many NPhard problems can be encoded with controlledunitaries of polynomially-many Pauli terms, such that the Hadamard Test would be efficient to implement. While such cases could instead be optimized by directly estimating polynomially-many different non-commuting expectation values, use of the Hadamard Test circumvents the need to prepare an ensemble of output states for each Pauli term, eliminating these extra circuit preparations. Conversely, optimizing worst-case objective functions with the Hadamard Test would require controlled-unitaries with up to O(2n) Pauli terms. While exact implementation of these problems with HTAAC-QSDP on purely gatebased quantum computers would be inefficient, such objective functions could be engineered as the natural time-evolution of quantum devices with rich interactions (e.g., quantum simulators [75\u201377] in their future iterations), or by approximate means.\nDue to the immense importance of SDPs in scientific and industrial optimization, as well as the ongoing efforts to generate effective quantum SDP methods that are often limited by poor scaling in key parameters such as accuracy and problem size, our work provides a variational alternative with tractable overhead. In particular, the largest SDPs solved via classical methods, which required over 500 teraFLOPs on nearly ten-thousand CPUs and GPUs [78], could be addressed by our method with just \u223c 20 qubits.\nIn future work, the techniques of this\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 16\nmanuscript can be extended to additional families of SDPs. For instance, SDPs that extremize operator eigenvalues are a natural application for quantum circuits [79]. Similarly, variational quantum linear algebra techniques [80] can potentially be adapted to enforce the more general constraints\n\u27e8A\u00b5, X\u27e9 = b\u00b5, \u2200\u00b5 \u2264 M\nof Eq. 1. In many cases, more general constraints are likewise satisfiable with the Pauli string constraints, as suggested in this work. For instance, when the number of requisite constraints M is much smaller than the number of variables N , or, as is the case with our quantum implementation of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, by enforcing a relatively small subset of the constraints."

In order for the efficient encoding UW = exp(i\u03b1W ) \u221d i\u03b1W to hold, it is sufficient to enforce that the thirdorder term in Eq. 12 is substantially smaller than the first-order term. That is\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.

By induction, the criterion in Eq. 32 also guarantees that odd (imaginary) powers >3 will likewise be smaller than the first order term, and are thus also negligible. While this condition can always be satisfied with an arbitrarily small \u03b1, we in practice require that \u03b1 maintain some finite size to avoid unitary rotations with vanishingly small gate times \u03c4 \u221d \u03b1 and imaginary components \u27e8\u03c3n+1\u27e9W \u221d \u03b1. We now demonstrate that this criteria can be met for a wide array of graphs with NP-complete MaxCut optimization complexity.\nFirst, we consider Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs [70] with elements Wij \u223c U[0,b], which are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, b]. The graphs are said to have edge density d, which is the fraction of non-zero edges e over total possible edges E = N(N \u2212 1)/2. Typical elements (W 3)ij are the sum of \u223c N2 terms WijWjkWkl, with expectation value WijWjkWkl = b3d3/8, such that the matrix elements of W 3 have the expectation value (W 3)ij = N2b3d3/8. As the mean of the non-zero elements in W is Wij = b/2, the criterion of Eq. 32 becomes\n\u03b12N2b3d3\n48 \u226a b 2 \u2192 \u03b1 2 \u226a 24 N2b2d3 . (33)\nWe can rewrite this criterion in terms the number of non-zero edges e by noting that graph density d scales as d = e/E, where E = N(N \u2212 1)/2 \u2248 N2/2 is the number of non-zero edges possible for an N vertex graph. Likewise, the average number of edges per vertex is then \u03be = e/N , and Eq. 33 can be rewritten as\n\u03b12 \u226a 3N 4 b2e3 = 3N b2\u03be3 . (34)\nFor graphs where edge density d is not uniformly distributed, the above conditions should hold for the most densely connected vertices of the graph.\nWe briefly illustrate how our approximation holds for a few other classes of graphs. For instance, graphs with elements Wij \u223c U[\u2212b,b] drawn\nfrom uniform distributions with both positive and negative components generally require \u03b1 ranges that are even more permissible (i.e., can be even larger) than those of the positive case, with the criterion of Eq. 33 serving as a small lower-bound.\nSimilar proofs of implementability can also be done for graphs with normally distributed weights Wij \u223c N (\u00b5, \u03c32) of mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32. For the case \u00b5 \u0338\u226a \u03c3, (W 3)ij = N2\u00b53d3 and \u03b1 need only satisfy\n\u03b12N2\u00b53d3\n6 \u226a \u00b5 \u2192 \u03b1 2 \u226a 6 N2\u00b52d3 , (35)\nwhich requires the same permissive scaling between N and d (e or \u03be) as the condition Eq. 32 (Eq. 33) for positive uniform distributions. Likewise, for normal distributions where \u03c3 \u226b \u00b5, Eq. 35 with \u00b5 \u2192 \u03c3 would be a large upper bound.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-03, click title to verify.
