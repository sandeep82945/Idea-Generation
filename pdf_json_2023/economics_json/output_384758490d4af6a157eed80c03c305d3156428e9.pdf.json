    "abstractText": "Large-scale events like the UEFA Euro 2020 football (soccer) championship offer a unique opportunity to quantify the impact of gatherings on the spread of COVID-19, as the number and dates of matches played by participating countries resembles a randomized study. Using Bayesian modeling and the gender imbalance in COVID-19 data, we attribute 840,000 (95% CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) COVID-19 cases across 12 countries to the championship. The impact depends non-linearly on the initial incidence, the reproduction number R, and the number of matches played. The strongest effects are seen in Scotland and England, where asmuch as 10,000 primary cases permillion inhabitants occur from championship-related gatherings. The average match-induced increase in R was 0.46 [0.18, 0.75] on match days, but important matches caused an increase as large as +3. Altogether, our results provide quantitative insights that help judge and mitigate the impact of large-scale events on pandemic spread.",

Iftekhar 1, Oliver Schulz 2, Philip Bechtle 3 & Viola Priesemann 1,4,5\nLarge-scale events like the UEFA Euro 2020 football (soccer) championship offer a unique opportunity to quantify the impact of gatherings on the spread of COVID-19, as the number and dates of matches played by participating countries resembles a randomized study. Using Bayesian modeling and the gender imbalance in COVID-19 data, we attribute 840,000 (95% CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) COVID-19 cases across 12 countries to the championship. The impact depends non-linearly on the initial incidence, the reproduction number R, and the number of matches played. The strongest effects are seen in Scotland and England, where asmuch as 10,000 primary cases permillion inhabitants occur from championship-related gatherings. The average match-induced increase in R was 0.46 [0.18, 0.75] on match days, but important matches caused an increase as large as +3. Altogether, our results provide quantitative insights that help judge and mitigate the impact of large-scale events on pandemic spread.\nPassion for competitive team sports is widespread worldwide. However, the tradition of watching and celebrating popular matches together may pose a danger to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation, especially in large gatherings and crowded indoor settings (see, e.g., refs. 1\u20136). Interestingly, sports events taking place under substantial contact restrictions had only a minor effect on COVID-19 transmission7\u201311. However, large events with massive media coverage, stadium attendance, increased travel, and viewing parties can play a major role in the spread of COVID-19\u2014especially if taking place in settings with few COVID-19-related restrictions. This was the case for the UEFA Euro 2020 Football Championship (Euro 2020 in short), staged from June 11 to July 11, 2021. While stadium attendance might only have a minor effect12\u201314, it increases TV viewer engagement15\u201317, and encourages additional social gatherings18. These phenomena and previous observational analyses19 suggest that the Euro 2020\u2019s impact may have been considerable. Therefore, we used this championship as a case study to quantify the impact of large events on the spread of COVID-19. Counting with quantitative insights on the impact of these events allows policymakers to determine the set of interventions required to mitigate it. Two facts make the Euro 2020 especially suitable for the quantification. First, the Euro 2020 resembles a randomized study across countries: The time-points of the matches in a country do not depend on the state of the pandemic in that country and how far a team advances in the championship has a random component aswell20. This independencebetween the time-points of thematch and theCOVID-19 incidence allows quantifying the effect of football-related social gatheringswithout classical biasing effects. This is advantageous compared to classical inference studies quantifying the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on COVID-19 where implementing NPIs is a typical reaction to growing case numbers21\u201323. Second, the attendance atmatch-related events, and thus the cases associatedwith each match, is expected to show a gender imbalance24. This was confirmed by news outlets and early studies25\u201328.

In the following, we use \u201ccase\u201d to refer to a confirmed case of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a human and \u201ccase numbers\u201d to refer to the number of such cases. Not all infections are detected and represented in the cases and cases comewith a delay after the actual infection. Ourmodel simulates COVID-19 spread in each country using a discrete renewal process22,29 for each gender separately, such that the effect of matches can be assessed through the gender imbalance in case numbers. This is defined as \u201c(male incidence \u2212 female incidence)/total incidence\u201d, and through the temporal association of cases to match dates of the countries\u2019 teams. Regarding the expected gender imbalance at football-related gatherings, we chose a prior value of 33% (95% percentiles [18%, 51%]) female participants, which is more balanced than the values reported for national leagues (about 20%)24. However, this agrees with the expected homogeneous and broad media attention of events like the Euro 2020. For the effective reproduction number Reff we distinguish three additive contributions; the base, NPI-, and behavior-dependent reproduction number Rbase, a match-induced boost on it \u0394Rfootball, and a noise term \u0394Rnoise, such that Reff =Rbase +\u0394Rfootball +\u0394Rnoise. We assume Rbase to vary smoothly over time,while the effect of singlematches\u0394Rfootball is concentratedonone day and allows for a gender imbalance. The term \u0394Rnoise allows the model to vary the relative reproduction number for each gender independent of the football events smoothly over time. We analyzed data fromall participating countries in the Euro 2020 that publish daily gender-resolved case numbers (n = 12): England, the Czech Republic, Italy, Scotland, Spain, Germany, France, Slovakia, Austria, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands (ordered by resulting effect size). We retrieved datasets directly from governmental institutions or the\nCOVerAGE-DB30. See Supplementary Section S1 for a list of data sources.

            "text": "The main impact arises from the subsequent infection chains We quantified the impact of the Euro 2020 matches on the reproduction number for the 12 analyzed countries (Fig. 1a) and for every single match (Supplementary Fig. S8). On average, a match increases the reproduction number R by 0.46 (95% CI [0.18, 0.75]) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S4) for a single day. In other words, when a country participated in amatch of the Euro 2020 championship, every individual of the country infected on average \u0394Rmatch extra persons (see Supplementary Section S2 for more details). The cases resulting from these infections occurring at gatherings on the match days are referred to as primary cases.\nHowever, primary cases are only the tip of the iceberg; any of these cases can initiate a new infection chain, potentially spreading for weeks (see Supplementary Section S2 for more details). We included all subsequent cases until July 31, which is about two weeks after the final. As expected, subsequent cases outnumber the primary cases considerably at a ratio of about 4:1 on average (Supplementary Table S3). As a consequence, on average, only 3.2% [1.3%, 5.2%] of new cases are directly associated with the match-related social gatherings throughout that analysis period (Fig. 1b). This surge of subsequent cases highlights the long-lasting impact of potential single events on the COVID-19 spread (see Supplementary Table S2).\nWe find an increase in COVID-19 spread at the Euro 2020matches in all countries we analyzed, except for the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, a \u201cfreedom day\" coincided with the analysis period32 and was accompanied by the opposite gender imbalance compared to the football matches, thereby apparently inverted the football effect.\nprimary infection at a match can start an infection chain. The total number of primary and subsequent cases that were inferred to be causally related to the Euro 2020 from its start until 31 July depend on the COVID-19 prevalence and the base spread during the analysis period. In parentheses are the number of matches played by the respective team. White dots represent median values, black bars and whiskers correspond to the 68% and 95% credible intervals (CI), respectively, and the distributions in color (truncated at 99% CI) represent the differences by gender (Supplementary Table S2). TheNetherlands is left out from the average calculations and subsequent analyses.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:122 2\nTherefore, we exclude the Netherlands from general averages and correlation studies, but still display the results for completeness.\nThe primary and subsequent cases on average amounted to 2200 (95% CI [986, 3308]) cases per million inhabitants (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table S2). This amounts to about 0.84 million (CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) cases related to the Euro 2020 in the 12 countries (cf. Supplementary Table S3). With the case fatality risk of that period, this corresponds to about 1700 (CI: [762, 2470]) deaths, assuming that the primary and subsequent spread affects all ages equally.Most likely this is slightly overestimated since the age groupsmost at risk fromCOVID19-related death are probably underrepresented in football-related social activities and thus more unlikely to be affected by primary championship-related infections. However, the overall number of primary and subsequent cases attributed to the championship is dominated by the subsequent cases, and the mixing of individuals of different age-groups then mitigates this bias. Individually, three countries, England, the Czech Republic, and Scotland showed a significant increase in COVID-19 incidence associatedwith the Euro 2020, and Spain and France show an increase at the one-sided 90% significance threshold. In other countries such as Germany, only a relatively small contribution of primary cases was associatedwith the Euro 2020 championship, and a small gender imbalance was observed. Low COVID-19 incidence during the championship or imprecise temporal association between infection and confirmation of it as a case can lead to a loss of sensitivity and hinder the detection of an effect, as can be seen from the large width of several posterior distributions (e.g., Italy and Slovakia, which had particularly low incidence).\nThe strongest effect is observed in England and Scotland Overall, the effect of the Euro 2020 was quite diverse across the participating countries, ranging from almost no additional infections to up to 1% of the entire population being infected (i.e., from Portugal to England, Fig. 1). To illustrate this diversity, the comparison between England, Scotland, and the Czech Republic is particularly illustrative\n(Fig. 2). For all countries,wedisentangled the cases that are considered to happen independently of the Euro 2020 (Fig. 2a, gray), the primary cases directly associated with gatherings on the days of the matches (red), and the subsequent infection chains started by the primary cases (orange; see Supplementary Figs. S24\u2013S36 for all countries).\nEngland, being the runner-up of the championship and thus played themaximumnumber ofmatches, displays the strongest effect over the longest duration, with a substantial increase in reproduction number \u0394Rmatch towards the last matches of the championship. This reflects the increasing popularity of the later matches, as e.g., quantified by the increase of the search term on Google (Supplementary Fig. S20). Scotland shows a particularly strong effect of a single match (Scotland vs England) staged in London during the group phase, with \u0394Rmatch = 3.5 [2.9, 4.2] (Fig. 2c). This means that on average over the total Scottish population, every single person infected additional 3.5 persons at or around that single day. These are very strong effects. As a consequence, in Scotland the subsequent cases from the single match accounted for about 30% of the cases in the following weeks, illustrating the impact of such gatherings on public health.\nLow overall incidence prevents large match-related spread In theCzechRepublic, the situationwasdifferent compared to England and Scotland, although the analyses point to similarly strong gatherings on thematchdays (i.e., large\u0394Rmatch, Fig. 1a).However, becauseof theoverall low incidencemuch fewer peoplewere infected throughout the championship. The advantage of low incidence or fewer games is illustrated in two counterfactual scenarios. Even under the assumption that the Czech team had continued to the final and the population had gathered exactly like the English (i.e., showing the same \u0394Rmatch in the matches they played), the total number of cases (per million) would have been more than 40 times lower than in England, owing to the lower base incidence and a lower base reproduction number (Fig. 2d). Assuming, as a counterfactual scenario, that England had dropped out in the group stage, the number of cases associated with the Euro 2020\nFig. 2 | Example cases illustrate that the spread associated with the Euro 2020 can encompass a substantial fraction of the observed cases. a The model enables one to split the observed incidence (black diamonds) into: cases independent of Euro 2020matches (gray area), primary cases (directly associated with Euro 2020 matches, red area), and subsequent cases (additional infection chains started by primary cases, orange area). See Supplementary Information for all countries (Supplementary Figs. S24\u2013S36).Here and in all following figures, the light blue shaded area signifies the time span of the Euro 2020. b Football-related gatherings, and hence the case numbers, show a gender imbalance. This facilitates the inference of the football-related increase in COVID-19 spread. Here the turquoise shaded areas correspond to 95% CI. c The effect of social gatherings at match days is modeled as a single additive increase in the reproduction number\n\u0394Rmatch concentrated on the day of each match. For example, \u0394Rmatch = 2 means that, on the day of the match, each infected individual on average infected two additional persons (on top of the base trend). d, e The counterfactual scenario assumes that England would not have reached the knockout phase (d, Scen. 1), or that the Czech fans and matches would have been equal to the English (i.e., reaching the final, and Czech people doing the same football-related gatherings as the English by their impact on disease spread; e, Scen. 2). f In the counterfactual scenarios, the Euro 2020 would have hadmuch smaller impact with fewermatches (Scen. 1), or with an overall more favorable pandemic situation as in the Czech Republic (Scen. 2). White dots represent median values, bars and whiskers correspond to the 68% and 95% credible intervals (CI).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:122 3\nwould have been much lower. This suggests that both the success in the championship and the base incidence and behavior in a country influence the public health impact of such large-scale events.\nTo better understand the impact of the Euro 2020, we quantified the determinants of the spread across countries. From theory, we expect the absolute number of infections generated by Euro 2020 matches to depend non-linearly on a country\u2019s base incidence N0, which determines the probability to meet an infected person, and on the effective reproductionnumber prior to the championshipRpre, as a gauge for the underlying infection dynamics generating the subsequent cases, which determines how strongly an additional infection spreads in the population.We can then define the potential for COVID19 spread as the number of COVID-19 cases that would be expected during the time T a country is playing in the Euro 2020 (N0 RT=4pre ), assuming a generation interval of 4 days. Indeed, we find a clear correlation between the observed and the expected incidence Fig. 3a, R2 = 0.77 (95% CI [0.39,0.9]), p <0.001, with a slope of 1.62 (95% CI [1.0, 2.26]). The strong significance of this correlation relies mainly on England and Scotland. However, the observed slope in an analysis without these two countries (0.76, 95% CI: [\u22121.46, 3.04]), while not significant at the 95% confidence level, is consistent with the findings including all countries. This is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7.\nFurthermore, quantifying correlations between N0 and Rpre and the number of primary and subsequent cases related to the Euro 2020, we see a trend for each (Supplementary Fig. S6a, b).However, these are weak and statistically significant only for Rpre. Altogether, our data suggest that a favorable pandemic situation (low Rpre and low N0) before the gatherings, and low Rbase during the period of gatherings jointly minimize the impact of the Euro 2020 on community contagion. A prerequisite for this is that the known preventive measures, such as reducing group size, imposing preventive measures, and minimizing the number of encounters remain encouraged.\nIndependently on the epidemic situation, Euro 2020\u2019s effect might be influenced by people\u2019s prudence and the team\u2019s popularity and success during the championship. While we do not observe any obvious effect of local mobility as a measure of the prudence of people (Fig. 3b, R2 = 0.06 (95%CI [0.00, 0.34]), p=0.54, and Supplementary Fig. S4), the potential popularity\u2014representedby thenumberofmatchesplayedand hosted by a given country\u2014had a more notable trend (Supplementary Fig. S6c). Still, this correlation was not statistically significant. Moreover, we found no relationship between the effect size and the Oxford governmental response tracker33 (Supplementary Fig. S5)."

            "text": "Large international-scale sports events like the Euro 2020 Football Championshiphave thepotential to gather people like noother typeof event. Our quantitative insights on the impact of such gatherings on COVID-19 spread provide policymakers with tools to design the portfolio of interventions required for mitigation (using, e.g., results of refs. 22,23,34). Thereby, our quantification can support society in carefully weighing the positive social, psychological, and economic effects of mass events against the potential negative impact on public health35. Our analysis attributes about 0.84 million (95% CI: [0.39M, 1.26M]) additional infected persons to the Euro 2020 championship. Assuming that the primary and subsequent spread affects all ages equally, this corresponds across the 12 countries to about 1700 (CI: [762, 2470]) deaths. Thus, the public health impact of the EURO 2020 was not negligible.\nTo prevent the impacts of these events, measures, such as promoting vaccination, enacting mask mandates, and limiting gathering sizes, can be helpful. Besides, the effectiveness of such interventions has already been quantified in different settings (e.g., refs. 22,23) so that policymakers can weigh them according to specific targets and priorities. Furthermore, focusedmeasures that aim tomitigate disease spread in situ, such as testing campaigns and requiring COVID passports to attend sport-related gatherings and viewing parties, present themselves as helpful options. In addition, one could encourage participants of a large gathering to self-quarantine and test themselves afterward. Moreover, the championship distribution of matches every 4\u20135 days coincides with the mean incubation period and generation interval of COVID-19. This means that individuals who get infected watching a match can turn infectious by the subsequent while potentially pre-symptomatic. Such resonance effects between gathering intervals and incubation time can increase the spread considerably34. It thus depends on the design of the championships, on the precautionary behavior of individuals, and on the basic infection situation how much large-scale events threaten public health, even if the reproduction number is transiently increased during these events.\nPrevious studies that evaluated the impact of sports events on the spread of COVID-19 and considered the spectator gatherings at match venues were not conclusive7,8,36. This agrees with our results as we find the impact of hosting a match to be small to non-existent (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, location having little effect may well be specific to the Euro 2020, where matches were distributed across different countries. In the traditional settings of the UEFA European\nScotland are left out, but the slope is still consistent with this result.). b Mobility changes from baseline during the Euro 2020 are not correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases associated with the championship in each country. Furthermore, the direction of the effect ofmobility per se in this context is unclear.

Whiskers denote one standard deviation.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:122 4\nFootball Championship or the FIFA World Cup, a single country or a small group of countries hosts the entire championship, and the championship is accompanied by elaborate supporting events, public viewing, and extensive travel of international guests. Hence, for other championships, such as, e.g., the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar or the Euro 2024 in Germany, the impact of location might be considerably larger.\nOur model accounts for slow changes in the transmission rates that are unrelated to football matches through the genderindependent reproduction number Rbase. We find Rbase to increase at least transiently during the championship in all 12 countries except for England and Portugal (Supplementary Figs. S24\u2013S35). The above may suggest that our estimate of the match effect \u0394Rmatch is conservative: The overall increase of COVID-19 spreadmight in part be attributed to Rbase, but will not be incorrectly associated with football matches. Our results might further be biased if the incidence and the teams\u2019 progression in the Euro 2020 are correlated. It is conceivable that high incidencewould negatively correlatewith teamprogression through ill or quarantined team members. However, there were only few such cases during the Euro 202037, and the correlation might also be positive: At higher case numbers the team might be more careful. Hence, the correlation is unclear and probably negligible.\nThe COVID-19 spread obviously depends on many factors. However, many of those parameters, such as the vaccination rate, the contact behavior or motivation to be tested, are changing slowly over time and hence can be absorbed into the slowly changing base reproduction rate Rbase and the gender-asymmetric noise \u0394Rnoise; other parameters, like social and regional differences, age-structure or specific contact networks are expected to be constant over time and average out across a country. To further test the robustness of our model, we systematically varied the prior assumptions on the central model parameters, among them the delay (Supplementary Fig. S12), the width of the delay kernel (Supplementary Fig. S13), the change point interval (Supplementary Fig. S14), the generation interval (Supplementary Fig. S16) and a range of other priors (Supplementary Fig. S17). Furthermore, when using wider prior ranges for the gender imbalance, football-related COVID-19 cases remain unchanged but the uncertainty increases (Supplementary Fig. S15), thus validating our choice. Even for the case of prior symmetric gender imbalance assumptions, the posterior distribution of the female participation converges for the three most significant countries to median values between 20 and 45%. As last cross-check, we made sure that we found no effect when shifting the match dates by 2 weeks relative to the case numbers (Supplementary Fig. S10) nor by shiftingmatchdates outside the championship range, by more than \u00b130 days (Supplementary Fig. S11).\nBesides quantifying the impact of matches on the reproduction number, our methodology allowed us to estimate the delay between infections and confirmation of positive tests D without a requirement to identify the source of each infection (Supplementary Fig. S19). Our estimates for D in the participating countries were around 3-5 days (England: 4.5 days (95%CI [4.3, 5]), Scotland: 3.5 days (95%CI [3.3, 3.8]), Supplementary Figs. S24 and S33g and Supplementary Table S4). This agrees with available literature and is an encouraging signal for the feasibility of containing COVID-19 with test-trace-and-isolate38\u201342. However, we expect that some individuals would actively get tested right after a match, thereby increasing the case finding and reporting rates. This can slightly affect our estimates for the delay distribution D and would require additional information to be corrected. Altogether, analyzing large-scale events with precise timing and substantial impact on the spread presents a promising, resource-efficient complement to classical quantification of delays.\nUnderstanding how popular events with major in-person gatherings affect the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 can help us design better strategies to prevent new outbreaks. The Euro 2020 had a\npronounced impact on the spread despite considerable awareness of the risks of COVID-19. We estimate that, e.g., about 48% of all cases in England until July 31 are related to the championship. In future, with declining awareness about COVID-19 but potentially better immunity, similarmass events, such as the footballworld cups, the Super Bowl, or the Olympics, will still unfold their impact. Acute, long-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 will continue to pose a challenge to societies in the years to come. Our analysis suggest that a combination of low Rpre and low initial incidence at the beginning of the event, together with the known preventive measures, can strongly reduce the impact of these events on community contagion. Fulfilling these preconditions and increasing health education in the general population can substantially reduce the adverse health effects of future mass events."

Ethical approval was not sought as we only worked with openly available data. A graphical overview of the inference model is given in Fig. 4 and model variables, prior distributions, indices, country-dependent priors, and sampling performance are summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\nModeling the spreading dynamics, including gender imbalance The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in each country separately using a discrete renewal process22,29,43. We infer a timedependent effective reproduction number with gender interactions between genders g and g 0, Reff,g,g 0 \u00f0t\u00de, for each country21.\nEven though participation of women in football fan activity has increased in the last decades44, football fans are still predominantly male24. Hence one expects a higher infection probability at the days of thematch for themale compared to the female population. Integrating this information into the model by using gender resolved case numbers, allows improved inference of the Euro 2020\u2019s impact. In the following, genders \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d are denoted by the subscripts \u2022g=1 and \u2022g=2, respectively. Furthermore, we modeled the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in each country separately.\nIn the discrete renewal process for disease dynamics of the respective country, we define for each gender g a susceptible pool Sg and an infected pool Ig. With N denoting the population size, the spreading dynamics with daily time resolution t reads as\nIg \u00f0t\u00de= Sg \u00f0t\u00de N X2 g 0 = 1 Reff,g,g 0 \u00f0t\u00de X10 \u03c4 =0 Ig 0 \u00f0t 1 \u03c4\u00deG\u00f0\u03c4\u00de, \u00f01\u00de\nSg \u00f0t\u00de= Sg \u00f0t 1\u00de Eg \u00f0t 1\u00de, \u00f02\u00de\nG\u00f0\u03c4\u00de=Gamma\u00f0\u03c4;\u03bc=4,\u03c3 = 1:5\u00de: \u00f03\u00de\nWe apply a discrete convolution in Eq. (1) to account for the latent period and subsequent infection (red box in Fig. 4). This generation interval (between infections) is modeled by a Gamma distributionG(\u03c4) with a mean \u03bc of four days and standard deviation \u03c3 of one and a half days. This is a little longer than the estimates of the generation interval of the Delta variant45,46, but shorter than the estimated generation interval of the original strain47,48. The impact of the choice of generation interval has negligible impact on our results (Supplementary Fig. S16). The infected compartment (commonly I) is not modeled explicitly as a separate compartment, but implicitly with the assumed generation interval kernel.\nThe effective spread in a given country is described by the country-dependent effective reproduction numbers for infections of\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:122 5\nindividuals of gender g by individuals of gender g 0\nReff,g,g 0 \u00f0t\u00de=Rbase\u00f0t\u00deCbase,g,g 0 +\u0394Rfootball\u00f0t\u00deCmatch,g,g 0 +\u0394Rnoise\u00f0t\u00deCnoise,g,g 0 , \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Cbase,g,g 0 , Cmatch,g,g 0 , and Cnoise,g,g 0 describe the entries of the contact matrices Cbase, Cmatch, Cnoise respectively (purple boxes in Fig. 4).\nThis effective reproductionnumber is a functionof threedifferent reproduction numbers (yellow and orange boxes in Fig. 4): 1. A slowly changing base reproduction number Rbase (22) that has\nthe same effect on both genders; besides incorporating the epidemiological information given by the basic reproduction number R0, it represents the day-to-day contact behavior, including the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), voluntary preventive measures, immunity status, etc. 2. The reproduction number associatedwith social gatherings in the context of a football match Rmatch(t) (11); this number is only different from zero on days with matches that the respective\ncountry\u2019s team participates in and it has a larger effect on men than on women. 3. A slowly changing noise term \u0394Rnoise(t) (31), which subsumes all additional effects which might change the incidence ratio between males and females (gender imbalance).\nThe interaction between persons of specific genders is implemented by effective contact matrices Cmatch, Cbase and Cnoise. All three are assumed to be symmetric.\nCbase describes non-football related contacts outside the context of Euro 2020 matches (left purple box in Fig. 4):\nCbase = 1 coff coff coff 1 coff , \u00f05\u00de\nwith coff \u223cBeta\u00f0\u03b1 =8,\u03b2=8\u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:122 6\nHere, we have the prior assumption that contacts between women, contacts between men, and contacts between women and men are equally probable. Hence, we chose the parameters for the Beta distribution such that coff has a mean of 50% with a 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of [27%, 77%]. This prior is chosen such that it is rather uninformative. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S17, this and other priors of auxiliary parameters do not affect the parameter of interest if their width is varied within a factor of 2 up and down.\nCmatch describes the contact behavior in the context of the Euro 2020 footballmatches (right purplebox inFig. 4).Here,we assumeas a prior that the female participation in football-related gatherings accounts for\u2243 33% (95% percentiles [18%,51%]) of the total participation.

The robustness of the choice of this parameter is explored in Supplementary Fig. S15. Cmatch is normalized such that for balanced case numbers (equal case numbers formen andwomen) and an additive reproduction number Rmatch = 1 will lead to a unitary increase of total case numbers. The reproduction number of women will therefore increase by 2\u03c9gender\u0394Rmatch(t) on match days whereas the one of men will increase by 2(1 \u2212\u03c9gender)\u0394Rmatch, assuming balanced case numbers beforehand.\nCnoise describes the effect of an additional noise term, which changes gender balance without being related to football matches (middle purple box in Fig. 4).

To account for the latent period and an eventual apparition of symptoms we apply a discrete convolution, a Gamma kernel, to the infected pool (right blue box in Fig. 4). The prior delay distributionD is defined by incorporating knowledge about the country specific reporting structure: If the reported date corresponds to the moment of the sample collection (which is the case in England, Scotland and France) or if the reported date corresponds to the onset of symptoms (which is the case in the Netherlands), we assumed 4 days as the prior median of the delay between infection and case. If the reported date corresponds to the transmission of the case data to the authorities, we assumed 7 days as priormedian of the delay. If we do not knowwhat the published date corresponds to, we assumed a median Dcountry of 5 days, with a larger prior standard deviation \u03c3log D (see Table 4):\nCyg t\u00f0 \u00de= XT \u03c4 = 1 Eg \u00f0t \u03c4\u00de Gamma\u00f0\u03c4;\u03bc=D,\u03c3 = \u03c3D\u00de \u00f040\u00de\nD= log Dy \u00f041\u00de\nDy \u223cN \u03bc= exp Dcountry ,\u03c3 = \u03c3log D \u00f042\u00de \u03c3D \u223cN \u03bc=0:2 Dcountry,\u03c3 =0:08 Dcountry : \u00f043\u00de\nHere, Gamma represents the delay kernel. We obtain a delayed number of infected persons Cyg by delaying the newly infected number of persons Ig(t) of gender g fromEq. (1). The robustnessof the choice of the width of the delay kernel \u03c3D is explored in Supplementary Fig. S17.\nWeekday-dependent delay. Because of the different availability of testing resources during aweek, we further delay a fraction of persons, depending on the day of the week (left blue box in Fig. 4). We model the fraction \u03b7t of delayed tests on a day t in a recurrent fashion, meaning that if a certain fraction gets delayed on Saturday, these same individuals can still get delayed on Sunday (Eq. (44)). The fraction \u03b7t is drawn separately for each individual day. However, the prior is the same for certain days of the week d (Eq. (45)): we assume that few tests get delayed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, using a prior with mean 0.67% (Eq. (48)), whereas we assume that more tests might be delayed onMonday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Hence compared to Cyg , we obtain slightly more delayed numbers of cases C\u0302g , which now include a weekday-dependent delay:\nC\u0302g t\u00f0 \u00de= 1 \u03b7t Cyg t\u00f0 \u00de+\u03b7t 1C\u0302g t 1\u00f0 \u00de with C\u0302g 0\u00f0 \u00de=Cyg 0\u00f0 \u00de \u00f044\u00de\n\u03b7t \u223cBeta \u03b1 = rd e ,\u03b2= 1 rd e with d = Monday ,:::, Sunday \u00f045\u00de\nrd = sigmoid r y d\n\u00f046\u00de\nryd = r y base,d +\u0394r y d \u00f047\u00de\nrybase,d \u223cN 5,1\u00f0 \u00de for d = Tuesday,Wednesday, Thursday \u00f048\u00de\nrybase,d \u223cN 3,2\u00f0 \u00de for d = Friday, Saturday, Sunday,Monday \u00f049\u00de\n\u0394ryd \u223cN 0,\u03c3r \u00f050\u00de\n\u03c3r \u223cHalfNormal 1\u00f0 \u00de \u00f051\u00de\ne\u223cHalfCauchy 0:2\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f052\u00de\nThe parameter rd is defined such that it models the mean of the Beta distribution of Eq.

This allows to define the hierarchical prior structure for the different weekdays. We chose the prior of rybase,d for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday such that only a small fraction of cases are delayed during the week. The chosen prior in Eq. (48) corresponds to a 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of rd of [0%; 5%]. For the other days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday,Monday), the chosenprior leaves a lot of freedom for inferring the delay. Equation (49) corresponds to a 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of rd of [0%; 72%]. The robustness of the other priors \u03c3r and e is explored in Supplementary Fig. S17."

As random initialization often leads to some chains getting stuck in local minima, we run 32\nchains for 500 initialization steps and chose the 8 chains with the highest unnormalized posterior to continue tuning and sampling. We then let these chains tune for additional 2000 steps and draw 4000 samples. The maximum tree depth was set to 12.\nThe quality of the mixing was tested with the R-hat measure51 (Table 5). The R-hat value measures how well chains with different starting values mix; optimal are values near one. We measured twice: (1) for all variables and (2) for the subset of variables encoding the reproduction number. Variables modeling the reproduction number are the central part of our model (lower half of Fig. 4). As such, we are satisfied if the R-hat values is sufficiently good for these variables, which it is (\u22641.07).

It is reasonable to ask whether the matches of foreign countries occurring in local stadium have an effect on the case numbers, caused by transmission in and around the stadium and related travel. To investigate this question we ran a model with an additional parameter (in-country effect) associating the case numbers to the in-country matches (Eq. (17)). In some countries the in-country effect parameter and the original fan gathering effect are covariant, as a large number of matches are played by the country at home, whereas in other countries the additional parameter had no significant effect (Supplementary Fig. S9).\nWe checked that the inferred fractions of football related cases are robust against changes in the priors of the width \u03c3D of the delay parameter D (see Supplementary Fig. S13) and the intervals of change points of Rbase (Supplementary Fig. S14). The results are also, to a very largedegree, robust against amoreuninformativeprior on the fraction of female participants in the fan activities dominating the additional transmission \u03c9gender (Supplementary Fig. S15). To reduce CO2 emissions, we performed fewer runs for these robustness tests:We only ran the models for which the original posterior distributions might indicate that one could find a significant effect. Each country required eight cores for about 10 days to finish sampling.\nIn order to further test the robustness of the association between individual matches and infections, we varied the dates of the matches, i.e., shifted them forward and backward in time. The results for the twelve countries under investigation are shown in Supplementary Figs. S10 and S12. In the countries where sensitivity to a championshiprelated case surge exists, a stable association is obtained for shifts by up to 2 days. As shown for the examples of England and Scotland in Fig. S19, such a shift is compensated by themodel by a complementary adjustment of the delay parameter D. For larger shifts, the model might associate other matches to the increase of cases, as matches took place approximately every 4 days."
