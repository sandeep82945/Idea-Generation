1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on LBP care-seeking behavior.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study that follows participants over time to see how their care-seeking behavior changes as the pandemic progresses and eventually ends.


2. **Explore the reasons why people with LBP are avoiding seeking care during the pandemic.** This could be done by conducting qualitative studies to interview people with LBP about their experiences and barriers to care.


3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to increase LBP care-seeking behavior during pandemics.** This could involve developing educational campaigns, providing financial assistance for care, or making it easier for people to access care remotely.


4. **Examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of LBP care.** This could be done by comparing the quality of care received by people with LBP before and during the pandemic.


5. **Investigate the relationship between LBP care-seeking behavior and other health outcomes.** This could involve studying the association between LBP care-seeking behavior and things like pain severity, disability, and mental health.
