    "abstractText": "We revisit the recipe for hadron formation in the Lund string hadronization model. Given an incoming quark or quark-diquark pair, weights for hadron formation are updated to take hyperfine splitting effects arising from the mass difference between u, d-type and s-type quarks. We find that the procedure improves the description of hadron yields in e+e\u2212 collisions and the \u03c6 cross section in neutral current DIS. We also show results for proton collisions, and discuss the future use of this study in the context of small system collectivity.",

            "text": "The surprising discovery from LHC [1] of continuous strangeness enhancement with final state multiplicity across collision systems, has spurred a renewed interest in hadronization models. While increased strangeness production in heavy ion collisions is traditionally seen as a signature of Quark\u2013Gluon Plasma (QGP) formation [2\u20134], microscopic hadronization models such as the Lund string model [5] or the cluster model [6] can describe similar effects using models of cluster reconnections [7,8] or string interactions, such as rope formation [9,10] or junction formation [10,11]. In the case of junction formation, even more attention has been gathered by the observation that also charm baryon yields are enhanced in hadronic collisions compared to e+e\u2212 [12].\nWhat all these approaches have in common, is their connection to the LEP baseline. As the basic notion of the models is that of jet universality, i.e. that the same physics model should hold in all collision systems, parameters are often estimated using data from e+e\u2212 collisions at the Z pole [13].\na e-mail: christian.bierlich@thep.lu.se (corresponding author) b e-mail: smita.chakraborty@thep.lu.se c e-mail: gosta.gustafson@thep.lu.se d e-mail: leif.lonnblad@thep.lu.se\nThis, in turn, means that no model attempting to describe features of pp collisions, will perform better than the LEP baseline. And while e.g. the Lund model as implemented in the PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator [14] does a reasonable job at describing the data, there are still details less well described, even total yields of some of the most intensely studied baryon and meson species in proton collisions, such as the \u03c6 meson and \u03a9\u2212 baryon, both characterized by having the maximal amount of inner strangeness.\nSeveral tunes for the PYTHIA event generator have been presented, as new experimental results have been available; the present default tune in PYTHIA 8 is the \u201dMonash tune\u201d from 2014 [13]. However, the basic parametrization is not changed at least since JETSET 6.2 in 1986 [15].\nThe production of different hadrons depends both on their quark content and the hadron mass. As discussed in Sect. 2, the string can break via qq\u0304 pair production in a kind of tunnelling process [16]. Here the virtual quark and antiquark are regarded as produced in a single point and pulled apart by the string tension until they come on shell, and the result is a Gaussian suppression for higher quark masses.\nThe production probability also depends on the mass of the hadron, which is sensitive to the spin-spin interaction between two quarks, proportional to M1 \u00b7 M2, where Mi \u221d g/\u03bci are the magnetic moments and \u03bci the masses of the quark and the antiquark in a meson, or in any pair of two quarks in a baryon. This effect separates the mass of the \u03c1-meson and the pion, leading to a suppression of the \u03c1/\u03c0 ratio by about a factor 1/2 (on top of the factor 3 from spin counting). Due to the larger mass of the strange quark the mass difference between K\u2217 and K is smaller, and the K\u2217/K similarly less suppressed. However, lacking experimental information at the time, the interaction between two strange quarks in an ss diquark in a baryon, or in an ss\u0304 pair in a \u03c6 meson, did not get a corresponding extra reduced suppression, beyond the suppression from a single s-quark. (The \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 mesons, both with a significant ss\u0304 content and with very low production rates, got their individual tunable\nsuppression factors fitted to data; see also the discussion in Ref. [17].) In Sect. 3 below, we present a relatively simple way to take the modified spin interaction between two strange quarks into account. It is most important for multistrange baryons, but it has also a non-negligible effect on the production of \u03c6 mesons. The lower suppression of multistrange baryons will also imply a larger suppression for \u0394++.\nIn the following we will first recap the basic features of string hadronization in Sect. 2, before we introduce the improvements concerning the strange quarks in Sect. 3. A tune to the modified hadronization is presented in Sect. 4. We present some result in Sect. 5, noting that the majority of results presented here are either for e+e\u2212 collisions or low-multiplicity proton collisions, in order to compare to an environment as free as possible from effects from rope hadronization, junction formation etc. Finally in Sect. 6 we present our conclusions."

            "text": "We will here discuss the basics of the Lund string hadronization model as implemented in PYTHIA; for more details see Ref. [5]. In the model the confining colour field is approximated by a \u201cmassless relativistic string\u201d. (For the dynamics of such a string we refer to Ref. [18].) A straight string is invariant under longitudinal boosts, with a given energy per unit length (or tension) \u03ba \u2248 1 GeV/fm, but no longitudinal momentum. It can be visualised as a thin tube with a homogeneous electric field, similar to a vortex line in a superconductor (with electric and magnetic fields exchanged).\nThe string can break by the production of a qq\u0304 pair, in a process analogous to the production of e+e\u2212 pairs in a homogeneous electric field. This gives [19]:\nexp(\u2212\u03c0(\u03bc2 + p2\u22a5)/\u03ba)= exp(\u2212\u03c0\u03bc2/\u03ba) \u00d7 exp(\u2212\u03c0p2\u22a5/\u03ba), (1)\nwhere \u03bc and p\u22a5 are the mass and transverse momentum for the quark and anti-quark in the pair. The quark and antiquark are then pulled in opposite directions by the string tension. The result in Eq. (1) can also be regarded as a result of tunnelling, where the quark and antiquark are produced in a single point as virtual particles, and pulled apart a distance\n2 \u221a\n\u03bc2 + p2\u22a5/\u03ba until they can come on shell [16]. A quark and an anti-quark from neighbouring breakups can combine to form a meson, if the mass is correct.\nAnother important feature of the model is that a gluon is treated as a momentum carrying \u201ckink\u201d on the string, pulled back by the force 2\u03ba from the two adjacent string pieces. The fragmentation of such a string with several intermediate gluons is discussed in Ref. [20]. In this section we will, however,\nfocus on the fragmentation of a straight string between a quark and an antiquark, without intermediate gluons.\n2.1 Meson production"

            "text": "For simplicity we first limit ourself to the situation with a single hadron species, neglecting also transverse momenta. In this simplified situation the breakup to a state with n hadrons is given by the expression [21]:\ndP\u221d n\u220f\ni=1\n[ Nd2 pi\u03b4(p 2 i \u2212m2) ] \u03b4(2) (\u2211 pi \u2212Ptot ) exp (\u2212bA).\n(2)\nHere pi (with i = 1, ..., n) and Ptot are two-dimensional vectors. The expression is a product of a phase space factor, where the parameter N expresses the ratio between the phase space for n and n\u22121 particles, and the exponent of the imaginary part of the string action, bA. Here b is a parameter and A the space\u2013time area covered by the string before breakup (in units of the string tension \u03ba). This decay law can (for large enough energies) be implemented as an iterative process, where each successive hadron takes a fraction z of the remaining light-cone momentum (p\u00b1 = E \u00b1 pz) along the positive or negative light-cone, depending on from which end the hadron is \u201dpeeled off\u201d. The values of these momentum fractions are then given by the distribution\nf (z) = N (1 \u2212 z) a\nz exp(\u2212bm2/z). (3)\nHere a is related to the parameters N and b in Eq. (2) by normalization.

A Lorentz boost in the x-direction will expand the figure in the (t + x) direction and compress it in the (t \u2212 x) direction (or vice versa). Thus the breakups will be lying along the same hyperbola, and low momentum particles in a specific frame will always be the first to be produced in that special frame.

            "text": "In practice it is also necessary to account for different quark and hadron species, and for quark transverse momenta. With \u03ba \u2248 1 GeV/fm Eq. (1) implies that strange quarks are suppressed by roughly a factor 0.3 relative to a u- or a d-quark. It also means that the quarks are produced with an average p\u22a5 \u223c 250 MeV, independent of its flavour. When a u- and a d\u0304-quark from neighbouring breakups combine to form a meson, it can result in either a pion or a \u03c1-meson.2 As stated in the introduction, the relative probabilities depend on the number of available spin states, but also by the normalization of the meson wavefunction affected by the spin-spin interaction between the quarks. The latter is proportional toM1 \u00b7M2, where Mi \u221d g/\u03bci are the colour magnetic moments of the two components. As discussed in Ref. [5], this can compensate the factor 3 from spin counting, giving a relative probability closer to 1, in agreement with observations [13,22].\nOf interest here is that the colour magnetic moment is proportional to 1/\u03bc, where \u03bc is the \u201ceffective\u201d mass of the quark. Therefore this effect is smaller for hadrons with a\n1 The Monash tune [13] gives a = 0.68 and b = 0.98 GeV\u22122. 2 In default PYTHIA only ground state hadrons, where the constituent quarks have relative angular momentum L = 0, are included. This means the octet and singlet pseudoscalars and vector mesons, and the octet and decuplet baryons. The semiclassical picture, with a string piece and a quark and an anti-quark at the ends, which have average transverse momenta \u2248 250 MeV, will give \u3008L\u3009 \u223c 0.1, and therefore a contribution from about 10% L = 1 states may be expected. An option which includes L = 1 states is also available in the PYTHIA event generator. However, when these resonances have decayed, the result is very similar to the default version.\nstrange quark, giving a K\u2217/K ratio which is larger than the \u03c1/\u03c0 ratio. This effect was included already in early versions of PYTHIA. In conclusion the overall qq\u0304 production rate is determined by the parameters a and b in Eq. (3), and the relative rates for \u03c0 , \u03c1, K, and K\u2217, which are determined by three tuneable parameters, and which we for the purpose of this paper name as follows:\n\u03c1: The overall suppression of ss\u0304 string breaks relative to u or d ones. (In PYTHIA settings this parameter is called StringFlav:probStoUD, and has a default value of 0.217). yud: The relative production ratio of vector mesons to pseudoscalar mesons for u or d types, not accounting for the factor 3 from spin counting. (In PYTHIA settings this parameter is called StringFlav:mesonUD vector, and has a default value of 0.50).\nys: The relative production ratio of vector mesons to pseudoscalar mesons for s types. (In PYTHIA settings this parameter is called StringFlav:mesonSvector, and has a default value of 0.55).\nThis implies that for e.g. a ud\u0304 pair becomes a \u03c0+ or a \u03c1+ with the following probabilities (the factor 3 comes from spin counting):\nP\u03c0 = 1/(1 + 3yud); P\u03c1 = 3yud/(1 + 3yud), (5) and similar probabilities for K and K\u2217, with yud exchanged to ys.\nThe production of mesons with an ss\u0304 pair is more complicated. For the isospin 0 vector mesons, \u03c6 is essentially a pure ss\u0304 state, while \u03c9 contains only non-strange quarks. Thus we have \u03c9 = (uu\u0304 \u2212 dd\u0304)/\u221a2 (with the iso-triplet \u03c10 = (uu\u0304+dd\u0304)/\u221a2). The \u03c9 mass is approximately the same as for \u03c1, and their production rates are also approximately the same. In default PYTHIA an ss\u0304 pair will give a \u03c6 meson, with the same probability (3ys/(1 + 3ys)) as a K\u2217\u2212 from an su\u0304 pair, although the \u03c6 has two strange quarks and K\u2217 only one. In Sect. 3.1 we discuss how we can take this difference into account.\nThe isospin 0 pseudoscalars, \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032, are mixtures of the flavour singlet state \u03b71 = (uu\u0304 + dd\u0304 + ss\u0304)/ \u221a 3 and the octet\nstate \u03b78 = (uu\u0304 + dd\u0304 \u2212 2ss\u0304)/ \u221a\n6, with a mixing angle \u03b8P between \u221210\u25e6 and \u221220\u25e6: \u03b7 = cos(\u03b8P ) \u03b78 \u2212 sin(\u03b8P ) \u03b71, \u03b7\u2032 = sin(\u03b8P ) \u03b78 + cos(\u03b8P ) \u03b71. (6) In a chiral symmetry limit, with all quarks being massless, \u03b78 would be a pseudo-Goldstone particle, along with the pion and the kaon. However, as both \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 are quite heavy, we are far from this limit. These particles also have quite low production rates. The solution in PYTHIA is to suppress\nthem both with an individual tunable parameter. We note that this procedure makes the interpretation of the parameter ys as the vector to pseudoscalar ratio ambiguous, as if no meson is chosen, a new trial break-up is made.\n2.2 Baryon production\nWe here describe baryon production in a single string as realized in the \u201cpopcorn\u201d model, which is the default treatment of baryon production in PYTHIA.\nIn analogy with the production of mesons in Sect. 2.1, a baryon\u2013antibaryon pair can be formed if the string breaks by the production of a diquark\u2013antidiquark pair, forming a colour antitriplet and a triplet respectively [23]. In this case the BB\u0304 pair will always have two quark flavours in common and lie close to each other in momentum space. Experimental data from e+e\u2212 annihilation show that this is not always the case, and a model, with a stepwise production mechanism, called the popcorn model, was presented in Ref. [24].3\nIn a red\u2013antired (rr\u0304) string-field, a bb\u0304 pair can be produced as a vacuum fluctuation. If the r and b charges form an antiblue antitriplet, then new qq\u0304 pairs can be produced in the green string field. With a single such pair, the result would be similar to the diquark\u2013antidiquark production described above. However, if more than one such pair is produced, we get not only a BB\u0304 pair, but also one or more mesons in between them, as seen Fig. 2. In this case the baryon and the antibaryon may have only a single flavour in common. However, as the first qq\u0304 pair (the blue pair above) is produced as a virtual fluctuation with limited lifetime, the production of several intermediate mesons, or the more massive vector mesons, is strongly suppressed. In the PYTHIA implementation therefore only a single intermediate meson is allowed, with the overestimated \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons simulating the neglected combinations of two or three pions.\nThe default PYTHIA implementation of diquark production, has three relevant parameters in addition to the suppression for every strange quark compared to non-strange quarks:\n\u03be : suppression for a diquark compared to a single quark, independent of flavour and spin. (In PYTHIA settings this parameter is called StringFlav:probQQtoQ, and has a default value of 0.081).\nx : extra suppression for diquarks with (any) strange content relative to diquarks without. (In PYTHIA settings this parameter is called StringFlav:probSQ toQQ, and has a default value of 0.915.) This suppression is in addition to the normal suppression due to the presence of an s-quark (\u03c1),\n3 A stepwise production mechanism was also suggested by Casher et al. in Ref. [25].\nydiq: suppression of spin 1 diquarks relative to spin 0 diquarks. (In PYTHIA settings this parameter is called StringFlav:probQQ1toQQ0, and has a default value of 0.0275.) This suppression comes on top of the factor 3 enhancement of vector diquarks from counting spin states.\nThe production rate of each (single) diquark can thus be calculated as the product of a spin factor, a vertex factor and a single-diquark tunnelling factor. These can in turn be combined for each possible diquark pair.\nAn essential feature here is that a baryon is an antisymmetric colour singlet state, and thus symmetric in flavour and spin. Therefore a diquark formed by two equal quarks can only have spin 1, and a ud-diquark must either have both spin and isospin 1, or both spin and isospin 0. The quark and diquark is then combined into a baryon, then again taking into account the total symmetry of the three-quark state. All relevant flavour information is determined by the parameters above, and in addition a baryon weight depending on the relevant SU(6)Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. As for the mesons, these may not necessarily add up to 1, and if no baryon is chosen a new trial is made."

            "heading": "3 Accounting for hyperfine splitting effects",
            "text": "As discussed in Sect. 2 the production rate for different hadrons is affected by the spin interaction of the quarks. The spin-spin interaction between a quark and an anti-quark or between two quarks is proportional to the product of the two colour-magnetic moments, M1 \u00b7 M2, which gives the ratio 3:(-1) between pairs with spin 1 and spin 0. As example this reduces the \u03c1/\u03c0 ratio from 3 (as given by spin counting) by approximately a factor 0.5. This effect is naturally related to the increased hadron mass due to the spin-spin interaction [5]. As this effect is due to the colour-magnetic moments of\nthe quarks, the difference between ud-, us-, and ss-diquarks is given by relative factors 1/\u03bc2u : 1/(\u03bcu\u03bcs) : 1/\u03bc2s , where \u03bcu and \u03bcs are unknown \u201ceffective\u201d (constituent or current) quark masses. The same relative factors are obtained for the quark-antiquark pairs ud\u0304, us\u0304, and ss\u0304.\nAs also discussed in Sect. 2, due to lack of experimental data at the time, in the implementation in PYTHIA there is a reduced suppression for all quark pairs with at least one strange quark, but no further reduction for pairs with two strange quarks, neither for mesons nor for baryons. For meson production a correction will enter into the assignment of meson species, when the ingoing qq\u0304 pair is given, i.e. as corrections to the parameter yud and ys, as introduced above. For baryon production, the effect enters into the relative weights given to spin 1 diquarks (ydiq) and diquarks with strange content x . To keep the amount of parameters constant, we will in the following set x = 1 (thus removing the possibility of further suppression), and focus only on ydiq.\n3.1 Modified meson production\nWe choose a simple ansatz for including the hyperfine splitting (HFS) effect. As explained in Sect. 2.1.2, in default PYTHIA the relative rates of vector to pseudoscalar mesons is determined by the two parameters yud and ys, where the latter determines the suppression of both K\u2217 and \u03c6. We now want to introduce a more flexible formalism, which allows a suppression which depends on the number of strange quarks. To keep the number of parameters unchanged, we re-parametrize the suppression of vector mesons as a common parameter ym, which depends on the number of strange quarks, ns, in the meson, as follows:\nym(ns) = ym1 + nsym2. (7) Here ym1 and ym2 are two new parameters. In order to obtain the same rate for the vector mesons \u03c1 and \u03c9, with only nonstrange quarks, one can consider ym1 = yud.\nThe important difference between this ansatz and the previous parametrization, is instead for K\u2217 and \u03c6 mesons. While they were equally suppressed before, K\u2217 will be suppressed by a factor ym1 + ym2, while \u03c6 now is less suppressed by the larger factor ym1 + 2ym2. Remember that, as discussed in Sect. 2.1.2, \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 are further suppressed by two individual parameters. Therefore the factor ym does not give the ratio between the vector meson \u03c6 and a corresponding isoscalar pseudoscalar meson. It rather gives the probability 3ym/(1 + 3ym) for an ss\u0304 pair to form a vector meson \u03c6. Thus the production of the pseudoscalars \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 will not be affected; their individual suppression factors will just be rescaled to give the same production probabilities as before. As the probabilities do not add up to 1, if no meson is chosen a new trial is made.\n3.2 Modified baryon production\nAs explained in Sect. 2.2, baryon production is governed mainly by the production of diquarks in the popcorn model, where two parameters x and ydiq governs the diquark rates. The production rate of each (single) diquark is calculated as the product of a spin factor, a vertex factor and a singlediquark tunnelling factor where the two parameters enter. These can in turn be combined for each possible diquark pair. We set x = 1 to keep the number of tunable parameters unchanged, and modify ydiq according to the same simple ansatz as above for mesons. Thus ydiq is redefined as:\nydiq \u2261 PvPs = yd1 + nsyd2. (8)\nTechnically, this modification enters only in the singlediquark tunnelling factors, and it suffices therefore to modify those. The default and updated tunnelling factors are then given by (written as (tunnelling factor(s)) = (default expression) \u2192 (updated expression)):\nP(ud1) = P(uu1) = \u221aydiq \u2192 \u221ayd1, (9) P(us0) = \u221ax \u2192 \u221ax, (10) P(su0) = \u221a\u03c1x \u2192 \u221a\u03c1x, (11) P(us1) = \u221aydiqP(us0) \u2192 \u221ayd1 + yd2P(us0), (12) P(su1) = \u221aydiqP(su0) \u2192 \u221ayd1 + yd2P(su0), (13) P(ss1) = \u221a\u03c1yx \u2192 \u221a \u03c1(yd1 + 2yd2)x . (14)\nNote that the two quarks in a diquark must be symmetric in spin and flavour, just like the three quarks in a baryon. Therefore the uu-, dd-, and ss-diquarks always have spin 1, the ud1 diquark has both spin and isospin 1, and ud0 has spin and isospin 0. Note that the apparent difference between e.g. P(us1) and P(su1) is due to which quark is considered to be produced \u201cfirst\u201d in the model. The missing factor \u221a \u03c1 appears in the vertex factor, and the resulting production probability turns out equal.\nWe also note that a baryon in the spin 1/2 octet can always be produced by adding a quark to a spin 0 diquark. Therefore this modification, when compared to standard PYTHIA, is in particular important for the decuplet, where it enhances \u03a9\u2212 production and suppresses \u0394++.\nIn the our implementation we introduce the new parameter c, which defines the two new parameters from the old one:\nyd1 = (1 \u2212 c)ydiq, and yd2 = cydiq. (15)\nThis choice means that ydiq now denotes the suppression for a diquark with a single s-quark, while c describes the enhanced suppression of nonstrange diquarks and the reduced suppression of doubly strange diquarks."

Such a \u201ctuning\u201d process is to assure that the altered model has at least as good a global description of data as the previous model. A modification such as the one introduced here would be unsuccessful if it turned out that it could only improve some aspects of descriptions of data, by making others worse. To keep a somewhat limited scope, we do, however, not perform a full retuning of all fragmentation parameters, or parameters related to final state radiation. Instead we only re-tune parameters directly affected by the performed changes, and stick to defaults [13], the so-called \u201cMonash 2013\u201d tune for the rest. The resulting set of parameters can thus not be taken as a new \u201cfull tune\u201d, but serve as reassurance that this model addition improves the overall description, in addition to providing a reasonable set of parameters.

Since reported values are not always consistent with each other and PDG [28], we will in selected cases we give the published numbers some further attention in the following:\n\u2022 The total charged multiplicity is taken as a combination of data4 from ALEPH [29], MARKII [30], OPAL [31] and DELPHI [32]. \u2022 Meson multiplicities K\u00b1 and K0s are taken from PDG [28]. \u2022 The K\u22170 and K\u2217\u00b1 multiplicities from PDG [28] are compatible with the individual measurements from DELPHI [33,34], ALEPH [29,35] and OPAL [36,37]. We re-use the PDG average. \u2022 The measured \u03c6 multiplicities at LEP and SLD are, as also noted in Ref. [13] mutually discrepant. We take a very conservative approach, and use the envelope of the reported results by OPAL [38], ALEPH [29], DELPHI [34] and SLD [39], meaning that \u03c6 is not really given much constraining power. \u2022 As mentioned above, the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 have special parameters to ensure their individual suppression. They are therefore not given any particular attention, but PDG values are included (without constraining power) for completeness.\n4 In cases where we have performed a data combination ourselves, the average of data from different sources is taken as the normal weighted mean \u03bc = \u2211\nxi /\u03c3 2i\u2211 1/\u03c3 2i with the error on the weighted mean \u03c3 2 = 1\u2211 1/\u03c3 2i .\n\u2022 The proton multiplicity is given particular attention. The PDG average of 1.050 \u00b1 0.032 per Z -event seems dominated by the result by SLD [40] (1.054 \u00b1 0.035). The SLD result is slightly higher than results by ALEPH [41] (1.00 \u00b1 0.07), OPAL [42] (0.92 \u00b1 0.11), but agrees with DELPHI [43], which however does have a large error (1.07 \u00b1 0.14). If we exclude SLD from the average, we obtain a proton multiplicity per Z -event of 0.99 \u00b1 0.05, which is the value we use. We cross check against the SLD value not extrapolated to full phase space. \u2022 As noted in Ref. [13], the published measurements of \u0394++ are mutually discrepant by 2\u03c3 . We re-use the conservative average with increased errors from that reference (0.09 \u00b1 0.017). \u2022 The \u039b0, \u039e\u00b1 and \u03a9\u2212 multiplicities are taken from OPAL [44], which also correspond well with (and in fact drives) the PDG averages.\nIn Fig. 3 we show hadron yields per Z boson from e+e\u2212 collisions at the Z pole. The model addition based on HFS is shown in red, and compared to default PYTHIA in blue. There are many parameter combinations which can describe e+e\u2212 yields at a reasonable level, not least because the experimental error bars on the rare mesons and baryons, which are most sensitive to the presented model additions, are rather large. Hence, it also makes little sense to perform the tuning as a global \u03c72 minimization or similar. The strategy used is as follows, resulting parameters are listed in Table 1:\n\u2022 Event shape observables will not change, as the parton shower is left untouched, and Lund fragmentation function parameters a and b are fixed to default values. Also the total charged or \u03c0\u00b1 multiplicity is left almost unchanged. \u2022 A value of the parameter \u03c1 is chosen, such that kaons from the pseudoscalar nonet is reproduced at least as well as in the default tune. \u2022 A value of the parameter \u03be is chosen, such that our updated proton multiplicity is well reproduced. In Fig. 3 (right) we show the proton multiplicity from SLD next to it for comparison. \u2022 Values for parameters ym1 and ym2 are chosen such that all recorded mesons in the vector nonet are now reproduced within error bars. \u2022 Parameters for \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 suppression are chosen to reproduce the yields form the default tune. \u2022 Parameters ydiq and c are chosen to give a reasonable description of \u0394++ and \u03a9\u2212."

            "text": "In this section we go on to study ep and pp collisions, using the updated fragmentation model with parameters listed in\nTable 1. We first note that while some effects are expected, the default PYTHIA description already does a reasonable job for most relevant observables, so enormous effects are not expected. This is also not the point. As indicated in the introduction, the main goal of this paper is to establish a more thorough baseline for further studies.\nIn ep collisions, results from ZEUS [45] from 2002 on inclusive \u03c6 production in neutral current DIS, showed a large enhancement with respect to expectation. The most stunning result from that paper is arguably the \u03c6 cross section in the target region at small Bjorken x (less than \u2248 0.006), which is more than a factor of 2 above expectation. Indeed this result was taken as a clear indication of an enhanced strange sea in the proton at small x . As the PYTHIA DIS description is generally not capable of correctly describing basic particle multiplicities at small x in the target region, we have to compare to some of the less spectacular results of the paper, still showing the same trend. In Fig. 4 (left) we show a comparison to the integrated (over 2 \u00b7 10\u22124 < x < 10\u22122) \u03c6 cross section as function of Q2. In blue we show PYTHIA default, which performs similarly as the HERWIG 5.1 Monte Carlo event generator [47] did in the original paper. Somewhat better agreement was achieved by the LEPTO 6.5 [48] and ARIADNE 4 [49] models, but only after an artificial decrease of the model parameters corresponding to the PYTHIA parameter \u03c1 (see Sect. 2.1.2). Accounting for hyperfine splitting alone cannot bring PYTHIA in agreement with this data. In magenta we show the effect of changing the parton distribution function (PDF, through LHAPDF6 [50]) to one obtained by the ATLAS collaboration [51], where sensitivity to the strange quark density of protons on W\u00b1 and Z production at small x is exploited. On top of this effect, we show (in red) the effect of hyperfine splitting, which makes the calculation compatible with data.\nGoing to pp collisions in Fig. 4 (right), we show comparisons to ALICE data at low forward multiplicity,5 at \u221a s = 7 TeV [1] and 13 TeV [46] respectively. At higher multiplicity we would expect rope effects (see Sect. 1) to dominate, in particular for multi-strange baryon production, which is why we limit ourselves to the lowest multiplicity class. Even the lowest multiplicity class is, however, not completely free from overlapping strings, but as close as one can get in a pp collision. We note that there is about a factor of six between the e+e\u2212 results in Fig. 3 and the pp results in Fig. 4 (right). Accounting for the different rapidity ranges, a factor of two remains. In the string model, this gives the direct interpretation that these events corresponds to two strings, meaning exchange of a single gluon or Pomeron. The exception to this argument is \u03a9\u2212 production, on which we comment separately below.\nAll hadron multiplicities are described to the same level or better than PYTHIA default. There are two interesting points to be mentioned, pointing towards future work. First of all, we see that even with retuning to the lower proton yield in e+e\u2212, PYTHIA still overshoots the proton multiplicity in low multiplicity pp collisions, giving apparent tension between the description of pp and e+e\u2212. This leaves two possibilities. Either one of the data sets cannot be trusted \u2013 we re-iterate that the e+e\u2212 results also had notable internal tension \u2013 or a key physics ingredient is missing. In the first case, future studies could consider simply leaving the proton yields out of the e+e\u2212 tuning efforts, and instead tune to low multiplicity pp. Secondly, the \u03a9\u2212 yield is still not well described, even with the baseline changed. This marks an opportunity for future studies of the rope model. We re-iterarate the argu-\n5 The data is, with inspiration from heavy ion collisions, divided into multiplicity classes based on forward production. We compare to the lowest multiplicity class only.\nment above, that the low-multiplicity collisions should correspond roughly to two strings, leaving room for string overlap. We remark that also previous literature [1] showed an effect of rope formation for \u03a9\u2212 production, even in the lowest multiplicity bin.6 Our result confirms that even with further attention given to the e+e\u2212 baseline, there is still room for collective effects in low multiplicity pp. This is potentially a game-changing realization, as it is common for experimental analyses of small system collectivity, to use low multiplicity collisions as a no-collectivity baseline. This result suggests that the common strategy might be flawed. We will follow this point up in a future paper."

            "text": "The Lund string model and its basic recipe for string breakings and formation of hadrons from the ingoing quarks and anti-quarks, has been a cornerstone of the PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator, and provided the basis for many phenomenological and experimental studies in e+e\u2212, ep, and pp, mostly in an unchanged form since it\u2019s first versions in the 1980s. In this paper we have updated the model to account for the impact of light quark mass differences, giving rise to modifications in the hadronic wave functions. With a simple ansatz, and no further parameters added to the model, we manage to improve in particular the description of \u03c1\u00b1, \u03c9, \u0394++ and \u03a9\u2212 yields in e+e\u2212 collisions. With this update, as well as by using updated PDFs, it is also possible to give a reasonable description of integrated \u03c6 production in neutral current DIS, and the updated baseline makes future precision studies of strangeness enhancement in pp using the rope hadronization model possible.\nAcknowledgements This work was funded in part by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation, contract number 2017.0036, Swedish Research Council, contracts number 2016-03291, 2017-0034 and 2020- 04869, in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, grant agreement No 668679, and in part by the MCnetITN3 H2020 Marie Curie Initial Training Network, contract 722104.\nDataAvailability Statement This manuscript has no associated data or the data will not be deposited.
