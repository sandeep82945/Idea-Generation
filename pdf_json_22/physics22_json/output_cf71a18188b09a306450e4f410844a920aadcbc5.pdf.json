    "abstractText": "We introduce two exotic lattice models on a general spatial graph. The first one is a matter theory of a compact Lifshitz scalar field, while the second one is a certain rank-2 U(1) gauge theory of fractons. Both lattice models are defined via the discrete Laplacian operator on a general graph. We unveil an intriguing correspondence between the physical observables of these lattice models and graph theory quantities. For instance, the ground state degeneracy of the matter theory equals the number of spanning trees of the spatial graph, which is a common measure of complexity in graph theory (\u201cGSD = complexity\u201d). The discrete global symmetry is identified as the Jacobian group of the graph. In the gauge theory, superselection sectors of fractons are in one-to-one correspondence with the divisor classes in graph theory. In particular, under mild assumptions on the spatial graph, the fracton immobility is proven using a graph-theoretic Abel-Jacobi map.",

The first one is a matter theory of a compact Lifshitz scalar field, while the second one is a certain rank-2 U(1) gauge theory of fractons. Both lattice models are defined via the discrete Laplacian operator on a general graph. We unveil an intriguing correspondence between the physical observables of these lattice models and graph theory quantities. For instance, the ground state degeneracy of the matter theory equals the number of spanning trees of the spatial graph, which is a common measure of complexity in graph theory (\u201cGSD = complexity\u201d). The discrete global symmetry is identified as the Jacobian group of the graph. In the gauge theory, superselection sectors of fractons are in one-to-one correspondence with the divisor classes in graph theory. In particular, under mild assumptions on the spatial graph, the fracton immobility is proven using a graph-theoretic Abel-Jacobi map.\nContents"

            "text": "The past decades have seen an explosion of various exotic lattice models including gapped fracton models [1\u20133] (see [4\u20136] for reviews)1 and gapless models [9] with subsystem symmetries. These models have various peculiar properties:\n1. Exotic global symmetries such as (planar or fractal) subsystem global symmetries [9,3],\nmultipole global symmetries [10\u201313], etc. (See [14,15] for recent reviews on generalized global symmetries [16].)\n2. In gapped fracton models, the logarithm of the ground state degeneracy (GSD) grows,\ntypically subextensively, with the linear size of the system [17].\n3. Massive particle-like excitations that have restricted mobility\u2014a particle can be com-\npletely immobile, a.k.a. fracton, or can move only along a line, a.k.a. lineon, etc.\nThese peculiarities do not fit into the framework of conventional continuum quantum field theory. In particular, the gapped fracton models do not admit a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) description at low energies. Instead, one has to go beyond the standard relativistic continuum field theory to describe them (see, for example, [18] for a recent review, and references therein).\nWhile there is a plethora of exotic lattice models, in most cases, the spatial lattice is assumed to be cubic with manifest translation invariance in the three spatial directions. There is usually no obvious way to define them on a triangulation of an arbitrary spatial manifold. See [19\u201321] for fracton models on more general manifolds. In some examples, a foliation of spatial manifold is essential [22\u201331]. In contrast, standard lattice models, such as the Ising model, or the toric code, can be defined on an arbitrary triangulation of the spatial manifold.\nWhat is the minimal structure we need to assume about the lattice? We need a set of vertices, which host the degrees of freedom, and a set of edges connecting them. This defines a mathematical object known as a graph. For example, the quantum Ising model can be defined on any spatial graph where the interaction is along the edges. In fact, lattice models on general graphs can be engineered in cold atom experiments. See [32\u201334] for examples. One is then naturally led to the question: can we construct exotic lattice models such as fractons on a general graph? (See [35] for an example in this direction.)\nIn this work, we propose two lattice models on an arbitrary finite, undirected graph \u0393. (For simplicity, we assume that the graph is simple and connected. See Section 2 for the\n1The word \u201cfracton\u201d was also used in other different contexts, for example [7, 8].\ndefinitions of these adjectives.) We work with a Euclidean spacetime where each spatial slice is \u0393 (see Figure 1). Our results can easily be recast in a Hamiltonian formulation. One model is a matter theory based on a compact scalar field \u03c6, while the other is a pure U(1) gauge theory associated with the global symmetry of the matter theory. We refer to them as the Laplacian \u03c6-theory and the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory, respectively, because they are constructed using the discrete Laplacian operator \u2206L on a general graph \u0393.\nNa\u0308\u0131vely, the Laplacian \u03c6-theory can be viewed as a particular regularization of the com-\npact scalar Lifshitz theory described by the Lagrangian\nL = \u00b50 2 (\u2202\u03c4\u03c6) 2 + \u00b5 2 (\u22072\u03c6)2 , (1.1)\nwhere \u22072 is the Laplacian differential operator on the spatial manifold. On the other hand, the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory can be viewed as a particular regularization of a rank-2 U(1) gauge theory with gauge fields (A\u03c4 , A) satisfying the gauge symmetry 2\nA\u03c4 \u223c A\u03c4 + \u2202\u03c4\u03b1 , A \u223c A+\u22072\u03b1 . (1.2)\nThe Lagrangian is\nL = 1 2g2 E2 , (1.3)\nwhere E = \u2202\u03c4A \u2212 \u22072A\u03c4 is the gauge invariant electric field. However, these continuum Lagrangians do not specify the systems unambiguously. In this paper, we use the modified Villain formulation [36, 37] to provide a precise formulation of these systems. We will see that various physical observables (including the GSD) depend sensitively on how the space is discretized by a discrete lattice graph \u0393. In particular, the discrete Laplacian difference operator \u2206L does not have a smooth continuum limit to the differential operator \u22072. It is important to emphasize that the Laplacian \u03c6-theory is not robust. Small deformations of the short distance theory change the elaborate long distance structure that we find here. (See the discussion in [38].) On the other hand, the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory is a robust model. In an upcoming paper [39], we will discuss gapped robust models that are related to these models.\nSince our models can be placed on any spatial graph \u0393, they can be defined in general spatial dimensions. In particular, we can take the graph \u0393 to be a d-dimensional torus lattice for any d \u2265 1. We will examine our models on 1d and 2d torus graphs in details below. More generally, we can place our models on a general graph where there is no clear notion of dimensionality or locality. In particular, foliation structure is not needed to define these\n2We call this a \u201crank-2\u201d gauge theory because the gauge transformation of the spatial gauge field involves a second-order spatial derivative.\nmodels.\nIn analyzing these models, we follow the approach advocated in [40,38,41\u201345,37,46\u201348], i.e., we focus on the global symmetries and pursue their consequences. Here are the highlights of these models:\n1. The discrete global symmetry of the matter theory is based on the Jacobian group of the\ngraph \u0393, denoted as Jac(\u0393), which is a well-studied finite abelian group associated with a general graph in graph theory. Relatedly, the discrete time-like global symmetry [48], which acts on defects, is also given by Jac(\u0393) in the gauge theory.\n2. In the matter theory, the ground state degeneracy is equal to | Jac(\u0393)|, the order of the Jacobian group. This in turn is equal to the number of spanning trees of \u0393, which\nwe will define in the main text. The number of spanning trees is a common measure of the complexity of a general graph in graph theory (see, for example, [49, 50]). This is one manifestation of the UV/IR mixing phenomenon observed in many of these exotic models: certain low-energy/long-distance observables depend sensitively on the shortdistance details [38, 46]. In our matter theory, the GSD equals the complexity of the discretized spatial graph, which can be thought of as a short-distance regularization. Under a mild assumption on \u0393, the ground state degeneracy grows exponentially in the number of vertices of \u0393 [50].3\n3. In the gauge theory, the defects, which describe the worldlines of infinitely heavy\nprobe particles, are immobile under a mild assumption on the graph \u0393. Therefore, the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory is a theory of fractons on a general graph.4 There is a beautiful correspondence between the physical observables for fractons and various graph-theoretic concepts. In particular, the space of superselection sectors for fractons is translated into the theory of divisors of a graph.\nThese features are analogous to those at the beginning of this introduction. Interestingly, they are intimately related to some well-studied properties of a graph.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we collect some useful mathematical facts about graphs, and functions on their vertices. We define the Laplace difference operator\n3One might wonder if this system is as trivial as decoupled spins on the sites of the graph because the GSD grows exponentially in N in both cases. However, as we will show below, the origins of this exponential behavior are very different. When both systems are placed on a 2d torus spatial lattice with L sites in each direction, the minimal number of generators of discrete momentum symmetry group of the Laplacian \u03c6-theory grows only linearly in L, whereas it grows as L2 in the decoupled spin system. So the large GSD of the Laplacian \u03c6-theory comes from the large orders of some of the generators of Jac(\u0393) rather than the number of generators.\n4In contrast to the matter theory, the ground state of the gauge theory (which has fractons) is nondegenerate (assuming that the \u03b8-angle is not \u03c0). See Section 4.2.\n\u2206L on the graph \u0393, and discuss the properties of solutions to discrete Laplace and Poisson equations. We introduce the theory of divisors on a finite graph, and define the Picard group and the Jacobian group of \u0393. We also define the Abel-Jacobi map on the graph and discuss its properties. We relate the Jacobian group to the Smith normal form of the Laplacian operator and the spanning trees of \u0393. These results can be found in any standard textbook on graph theory such as [51, 52]. In Appendix A, we solve the discrete Poisson equation on any graph using the Smith decomposition of the Laplacian matrix.\nIn Section 3, we introduce the Laplacian \u03c6-theory on the graph \u0393. It is a self-dual model with momentum and winding symmetries. The momentum (or winding) symmetry is U(1) \u00d7 Jac(\u0393), where Jac(\u0393) is the Jacobian group of \u0393. The noncommutativity of the momentum and winding symmetries leads to a ground state degeneracy equal to | Jac(\u0393)|, the order of the Jacobian group. This is also equal to the number of spanning trees or the complexity of \u0393. We note that this model is not robust\u2014deforming the theory by a winding operator breaks the winding symmetry and lifts the degeneracy.\nIn Section 4, we introduce the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory on the graph \u0393. It is the pure gauge theory associated with the momentum symmetry of the Laplacian \u03c6-theory. While the space-like global symmetry of this model is simply U(1), the time-like global symmetry is U(1) \u00d7 Jac(\u0393). This leads to selection rules on the mobility of defects. In particular, we prove that a defect with unit charge is completely immobile when \u0393 is 2-edge connected (we will define this below). In other words, a single charged particle is a fracton. We also give a complete characterization of mobility of defects for arbitrary \u0393. Finally, we note an interesting correspondence between divisors in graph theory and configurations of fractons on \u0393, which is summarized in Table 1.\nIn both Sections 3 and 4, we discuss two concrete examples where we place each model on spatial circle and torus respectively. While the former gives the 1+1d dipole theories analyzed in [48], the latter gives new 2+1d models with interesting properties. These new 2+1d models can be interpreted as extensions of the 1+1d dipole theories of [48] to 2+1d. In fact, there are other ways to extend the 1+1d dipole theories to 2+1d. In an upcoming paper [53], we compare all these 2+1d models, and discuss their relation to the 2+1d compact Lifshitz theory [54\u201363] and 2+1d rank-2 U(1) tensor gauge theory [10,11].\nIn another upcoming paper [39], we propose and analyze two gapped ZN models on a graph. One of them is a fracton model, which is a Higgsed version of the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory on the graph. The other is a robust lineon model. We also study these gapped models on a spatial torus, and compare them with 2+1d rank-2 ZN tensor gauge theory [64\u201368]."

            "text": "In this subsection, we compute the ground state degeneracy of the Laplacian \u03c6-theory. To facilitate this computation, we find it convenient to first gauge fix the integer gauge fields. First, we gauge fix n\u03c4 = 0 everywhere except at \u03c4\u0302 = 0. The remaining integer gauge freedom is the set of time-independent gauge transformations k(i). By the flatness condition, we also have \u2206\u03c4n = 0, so n(\u03c4\u0302 , i) = n(i). By the analysis in Appendix A around (A.23), the honolomies of n(i) with gauge parameter k(i) are precisely the winding charges (3.9) and (3.10).\nIn this gauge, a discrete winding configuration with discrete winding charges Q\u0303a = pa mod ra for a < N and zero U(1) winding charge, Q\u0303 = 0, is given by11\n\u03c6(\u03c4\u0302 , i) = 2\u03c0 \u2211 a<N Qiapa ra , n(\u03c4\u0302 , i) = \u2211 a<N (P\u22121)iapa .

All these configurations have zero energy. Therefore, the ground state degeneracy is\nGSD = | Jac(\u0393)| = \u220f a<N ra . (3.12)\nAs mentioned in Section 2, this is equal to the number of spanning trees of the graph \u0393, which measures how complex a graph is. It follows that, when \u0393 is k-regular with k \u2265 3, the ground state degeneracy grows exponentially in the number of vertices N [50].\nLet us compare the Laplacian \u03c6-theory with a decoupled spin system: a finite dimensional spin at every site with trivial Hamiltonian. In both systems, the GSD grows exponentially in the number of vertices N. How do we differentiate these systems? For simplicity, let us place both systems on a torus graph, \u0393 = CL\u00d7CL. Then, in the Laplacian \u03c6-theory, the minimal number of generators of the discrete momentum symmetry group (3.8) grows linearly in L (see Section 3.6.2), and some of these generators have very large orders. On the other hand, in the decoupled spin system, there is a generator at each site, so the symmetry group has L2 generators each with the same fixed order. In other words, the large GSD of Laplacian \u03c6-theory comes from the large orders of some of the generators of Jac(\u0393) rather than the number of generators.\nThere is another way to derive the above ground state degeneracy. The discrete momentum and winding symmetries do not commute with each other: the shift (3.7) of n changes\n11This configuration has Q\u0303 = 0 because \u2211i(P\u22121)ia = 0 for a < N as shown in (A.3).\nthe discrete winding charge Q\u0303a in (3.10) by pa mod ra. This can be interpreted as a mixed \u2019t Hooft anomaly between the discrete momentum and winding symmetries, and it leads to the ground state degeneracy (3.12). In fact, the entire Hilbert space is in a projective representation of Jac(\u0393)\u00d7 Jac(\u0393), so every state is | Jac(\u0393)|-fold degenerate."

This is the modified Villain action of the 1+1d dipole \u03c6-theory [48], which is the lattice regularization of the 1+1d compact Lifshitz scalar field theory.\nThe invariant factors of L are\nra =  1 , 1 \u2264 a < Lx \u2212 1 , Lx , a = Lx \u2212 1 , 0 , a = Lx .\n(3.23)\nIt follows that the Jacobian group for a cycle graph CLx is\nJac(CLx) = ZLx . (3.24)\n(3.24) is a demonstration of the fact that the large GSD comes from the large orders of some of the genrators of Jac(\u0393) rather than the number of generators. Physically, (3.24) means that the discrete momentum and winding symmetries of the 1+1d dipole \u03c6-theory are ZLx .\nA spanning tree of a cycle graph CLx is obtained by removing any one of the Lx edges. See Figure 2. Therefore, there are exactly Lx spanning trees of a cycle graph CLx . In other words, the complexity of CLx is simply Lx, which equals the ground state degeneracy of the\n14Actually, it is common to define \u22062xf(x\u0302) = f(x\u0302+ 1)\u2212 2f(x\u0302) + f(x\u0302\u2212 1), so \u2206L = \u2212\u22062x. We will ignore this discrepancy in sign since it does not affect the rest of the discussion.\n1+1d dipole \u03c6-theory. This is in agreement with the analysis of [48]. As both the discrete global symmetry (which is Jac(CLx)) and the ground state degeneracy (which is | Jac(CLx)|) grow as we increase the number of lattice sites Lx, it is clear that this 1+1d model does not have an unambiguous continuum limit Lx \u2192\u221e. Incidentally, using (2.12) to compute the ground state degeneracy in terms of the eigenvalues of \u22062x leads to the following identity:\nLx = 1\nLx Lx\u22121\u220f kx=1 4 sin2 ( \u03c0kx Lx ) .

            "text": "Let \u0393 be a torus graph, i.e., \u0393 = CLx \u00d7 CLy = ZLx \u00d7 ZLy , where Li is the number of sites in the i direction. The operator \u2206L associated with the Laplacian matrix of \u0393 is the same as the standard Laplacian operator \u22062x + \u2206 2 y in the xy-plane. The action (3.2) becomes\nS = \u03b20 2 \u2211 \u03c4 -link (\u2206\u03c4\u03c6\u2212 2\u03c0n\u03c4 )2 + \u03b2 2 \u2211 site [ (\u22062x + \u2206 2 y)\u03c6\u2212 2\u03c0n ]2 + i\n\u2211 \u03c4 -link \u03c6\u0303 [ \u2206\u03c4n\u2212 (\u22062x + \u22062y)n\u03c4 ] .\n(3.26)\nWe refer to this as the 2+1d Laplacian \u03c6-theory. This is a natural lattice regularization of the 2+1d compact Lifshitz scalar field theory that can be defined on a general spatial graph \u0393.\nThe discrete momentum and winding symmetries are determined by the Jacobian group of the torus graph. The latter is quite complicated and not known in closed form in general as a function of Lx, Ly. Below we record a few examples for small values of Lx = Ly:\nJac(C2 \u00d7 C2) = Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z8 , Jac(C3 \u00d7 C3) = Z6 \u00d7 Z6 \u00d7 Z18 \u00d7 Z18 , Jac(C4 \u00d7 C4) = Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z8 \u00d7 Z24 \u00d7 Z24 \u00d7 Z24 \u00d7 Z96 .\n(3.27)\nThe minimal number of generators of Jac(CLx\u00d7CLy) is at most the number of nontrivial spatial integer gauge fields, n\u2019s, after gauge fixing. One can gauge fix the n\u2019s to be zero everywhere except along x\u0302 = 0, 1, or along y\u0302 = 0, 1. Therefore, after gauge fixing, the number of nontrivial n\u2019s is min(2Lx, 2Ly). In other words, on a square torus graph CL\u00d7CL, the minimal number of generators of Jac(CL\u00d7CL) grows at most linearly in L. Once again, this shows that the large GSD is due to the large orders of some of the generators of Jac(\u0393)\nrather than the number of generators.\nThe ground state degeneracy is given by the order of the Jacobian group, GSD = | Jac(CLx \u00d7 CLy)|. While there is no closed form formula for the Jacobian group itself, the order of this group can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian on the torus graph (see (2.12)). We therefore obtain\nGSD = 1\nLxLy \u220f 0\u2264ki<Li\n(kx,ky)6=(0,0)\n[ 4 sin2 ( \u03c0kx Lx ) + 4 sin2 ( \u03c0ky Ly )]\n= LxLy Li\u22121\u220f ki=1 [ 4 sin2 ( \u03c0kx Lx ) + 4 sin2 ( \u03c0ky Ly )] ,\n(3.28)\nwhere we used the identity (3.25) in the second line. Since the discrete global symmetry Jac(CLx \u00d7 CLy) and the GSD depend sensitively on the number theoretic properties of the lattice sites Lx, Ly, this regularization of the 2+1d compact Lifshitz theory does not have an unambiguous continuum limit Lx, Ly \u2192\u221e. Let us discuss the asymptotic behavior of the GSD on a torus. The GSD grows asymptotically as [83]\nlog GSD \u2248 LxLy \u03c02 \u222b \u03c0 0 \u222b \u03c0 0 dpxdpy log [ 4 sin2(px) + 4 sin 2(py) ] = 4G \u03c0 LxLy , (3.29)\nwhere G \u2248 0.916 is the Catalan constant. This is consistent with the intuition that the number of spanning trees of the torus graph CLx \u00d7 CLy , which is also equal to GSD, grows with Lx and Ly. Indeed, the result of [50] implies the ground state degeneracy of the 2+1d Laplacian \u03c6-theory grows exponentially in LxLy. 15\nA closely related matter theory is the 2+1d dipole \u03c6-theory, which is another possible regularization of the 2+1d compact Lifshitz field theory. While the 1+1d dipole \u03c6-theory is the same as the 1+1d Laplacian \u03c6-theory, their 2+1d versions are very different. In an upcoming paper [53], we compare the 2+1d Laplacian and dipole \u03c6-theories, and discuss their relation to the 2+1d compact Lifshitz theory.\n15Here we have used the fact that the torus graph \u0393 = CLx\u00d7CLy is 4-regular in applying the result of [50]. In contrast, a cycle graph is only 2-regular, and indeed the GSD of the 1+1d dipole \u03c6-theory grows linearly in the number of vertices.\n4 U(1) Laplacian gauge theory and fractons on a graph\nWe can gauge the momentum symmetry of the Laplacian \u03c6-theory by coupling it to the gauge fields (A\u03c4 ,A;m\u03c4 ). Here A\u03c4 and A are real-valued fields living on the \u03c4 -links and the sites, respectively, and m\u03c4 is an integer-valued gauge field living on the \u03c4 -link. Their gauge transformations are A\u03c4 \u223c A\u03c4 + \u2206\u03c4\u03b1 + 2\u03c0q\u03c4 , A \u223c A+ \u2206L\u03b1 + 2\u03c0q , m\u03c4 \u223c m\u03c4 + \u2206\u03c4q \u2212\u2206Lq\u03c4 , (4.1)\nwhere \u03b1 is a real-valued gauge parameter and q\u03c4 , q are integer-valued gauge parameters.\nWe can leave out the matter fields and study the pure gauge theory of (A\u03c4 ,A;m\u03c4 ). It is described by the following Villain action\nS = \u03b3\n2 \u2211 \u03c4\u0302 ,i E2 + i\u03b8 2\u03c0 \u2211 \u03c4\u0302 ,i E , (4.2)\nwhere E = \u2206\u03c4A \u2212 \u2206LA\u03c4 \u2212 2\u03c0m\u03c4 is the gauge-invariant electric field of (A\u03c4 ,A;m\u03c4 ). The \u03b8-angle is 2\u03c0-periodic, i.e., \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8 + 2\u03c0, because \u2211\u03c4\u0302 ,i E = \u22122\u03c0\u2211\u03c4\u0302 ,im\u03c4 \u2208 2\u03c0Z. See [37] for similar Villain formulation of various standard and exotic U(1) gauge theories.\nThe theory (4.2) can be viewed as an extension of the 1+1d rank-2 U(1) gauge theory of [48] with \u22062x on the 1d spatial lattice replaced by the discrete Laplacian operator \u2206L on the graph \u0393."

            "heading": "4.1 Global symmetry",
            "text": "Here we discuss the global symmetry of the U(1) Laplacian gauge theory. There are two kinds of global symmetries that we should distinguish in gauge theory. The first kind is the space-like global symmetry, which acts on operators and states in the Hilbert space. The second kind is the time-like global symmetry, which acts on defects extended in the (Euclidean) time direction. In an ordinary, relativistic gauge theory, both the space-like and time-like global symmetries are parts of the one-form global symmetry [16]. In contrast, the two global symmetries can be drastically different in non-relativistic systems. For example, even the groups for them can be different. We refer the readers to [48] for comprehensive analyses of time-like global symmetries in various standard and exotic models.\nThis theory has an electric symmetry that shifts\n(A\u03c4 ,A;m\u03c4 )\u2192 (A\u03c4 ,A;m\u03c4 ) + (\u03bb\u03c4 , \u03bb; p\u03c4 ) , (4.3)\nwhere (\u03bb\u03c4 , \u03bb; p\u03c4 ) is a flat U(1) gauge field, i.e.,\n\u2206\u03c4\u03bb\u2212\u2206L\u03bb\u03c4 = 2\u03c0p\u03c4 . (4.4)\nThe shift (\u03bb\u03c4 , \u03bb; p\u03c4 ) is subject to the gauge transformation in (4.1). Below we will use this freedom of gauge transformation to gauge-fix the shift in a particular form. Using the integer gauge parameter q, we can set p\u03c4 = 0 everywhere except at \u03c4\u0302 = 0. Similarly, we can\nuse \u03b1 to set \u03bb\u03c4 = 0 everywhere except at \u03c4\u0302 = 0. Since \u2211 i p\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) = 0 by flatness, by the analysis in Appendix A around (A.23), we can use q\u03c4 to set\np\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) = \u2212\u03b4\u03c4\u0302 ,0 \u2211 a<N (P\u22121)iap\u03c4a , (4.5)\nwhere p\u03c4a = 0, . . . , ra \u2212 1. Now, the remaining gauge symmetry is time-independent \u03b1(i) and q(i), and q\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) = \u03b4\u03c4\u0302 ,0q\u0304\u03c4 , where q\u0304\u03c4 is an integer. By flatness, we have \u2206\u03c4\u03bb = 0. By the analysis in Appendix A around (A.22), using \u03b1(i) and q(i), we can set\n\u03bb(\u03c4\u0302 , i) = c\nN , (4.6)\nwhere c \u223c c+ 2\u03c0. Since \u2206\u03c4\u03bb = 0, we have \u2206L\u03bb\u03c4 + 2\u03c0p\u03c4 = 0 at \u03c4\u0302 = 0. Using (2.6), the solution for \u03bb\u03c4 is\n\u03bb\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) = \u03b4\u03c4\u0302 ,0 [ c\u03c4 + 2\u03c0\n\u2211 a<N Qiap\u03c4a ra\n] , (4.7)\nwhere c\u03c4 \u223c c\u03c4 + 2\u03c0. The parameter c generates a U(1) electric global space-like symmetry that shifts A \u2192 A+ c N . The operator charged under this symmetry is\nexp [ i \u2211 j A(\u03c4\u0302 , j) ] . (4.8)\nThere are no other gauge invariant operators other than those mentioned so far. Relatedly, there is no discrete electric global symmetry.\nThe parameters c\u03c4 and p\u03c4a\u2019s generate the electric global time-like symmetry that shifts A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i)\u2192 A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) + \u03b4\u03c4\u0302 ,0 [ c\u03c4 + 2\u03c0\n\u2211 a<N Qiap\u03c4a ra\n] ,\nm\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i)\u2192 m\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i)\u2212 \u03b4\u03c4\u0302 ,0 \u2211 a<N (P\u22121)iap\u03c4a .\n(4.9)\nComparing with (2.6), we see that a general time-like global symmetry transformation is labeled by a U(1)-valued discrete harmonic function, which forms the group U(1)\u00d7 Jac(\u0393). This shift does not act on operators. Rather, it acts on defects that extend in the time direction. More specifically, a charged defect at site i is\nexp [ i \u2211 \u03c4\u0302 A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) ] . (4.10)"

To do this, we first take L\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, and gauge fix m\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) = 0. We then introduce the lattice spacing a\u03c4 in the \u03c4 - direction, and take the limit a\u03c4 \u2192 0 while keeping \u03b3\u2032 = \u03b3a\u03c4 fixed. We also define a scaled temporal gauge field A\u03c4 =\n1 a\u03c4 A\u03c4 and a scaled electric field E = \u2202\u03c4A \u2212 \u2206LA\u03c4 while taking\nthis limit. Finally, we Wick rotate from Euclidean time \u03c4 to Lorentzian time t.\nThe Gauss law (i.e., the equation of motion of A0) gives\n\u2206LE(t, i) = 0 =\u21d2 E(t, i) = E(t) .

For \u03b8 6= \u03c0, the ground state is non-degenerate, while for \u03b8 = \u03c0 there are two degenerate ground states.\nWe now discuss the robustness of the theory. All the local operators in the theory are made of the gauge-invariant electric field E. Adding them to the Lagrangian does not change the qualitative behavior of the theory. Hence, we conclude that the theory is robust."

            "text": "The pure U(1) gauge theory has defects (4.10) describing the world lines of infinitely massive particles. The U(1) time-like symmetry charges of these defects can be interpreted as the gauge charges of the massive particles. More generally, a static configuration of particles carrying gauge charge q(i) at site i is represented by the following defect:\nexp [ i \u2211 \u03c4\u0302 \u2211 i q(i)A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) ] , q(i) \u2208 Z . (4.15)\nA \u201cmove\u201d at time \u03c4\u03020 on a configuration is implemented by applying products of operators exp[iA(\u03c4\u03020, i)] at different sites. A configuration of particles can \u201cmove\u201d to another configuration if and only if there is a gauge-invariant defect that connects the two.\nSince the discrete Jac(\u0393) time-like global symmetries depend on the sites, they constrain the possible shapes of defects, and therefore the mobility of the particles. Moreover, they lead to superselection sectors of defects distinguished by the time-like symmetry charges. See [48] for more discussions on time-like global symmetries.\nFrom (4.9), we see that the discrete time-like symmetry charges of a static defect (4.10) at site i are given by Qia mod ra with a = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,N \u2212 1. The defect (4.10) can hop from site i to site i\u2032 if and only if the time-like charges of the defects at these two positions are the same, i.e., Qi\u2032a = Qia mod ra , a = 1, . . . ,N\u2212 1 . (4.16) Then, the defect that \u201chops\u201d a particle from i to i\u2032 at time \u03c4\u0302 = \u03c4\u03020 is\nexp [ i \u2211 \u03c4\u0302<\u03c4\u03020 A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) ] exp [ i \u2211 a<N,j ( Qi\u2032a \u2212Qia ra ) PajA(\u03c4\u03020, j) ] exp [ i \u2211 \u03c4\u0302\u2265\u03c4\u03020 A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i\u2032) ] . (4.17)\nWe are now ready to phrase the mobility of the probe particles in terms of a graphtheoretic statement. The condition for mobility (4.16) is equivalent to the property that all U(1)-valued discrete harmonic functions (2.6) take the same value at i and i\u2032. If the\ncondition (4.16) is not satisfied, i.e., if there is a U(1)-valued discrete harmonic function that takes different values at i and i\u2032, then the particle cannot move from i to i\u2032. If this is the case for all i, i\u2032 \u2208 \u0393, then the particle is a fracton. Using the Abel-Jacobi map Si0 , we can completely characterize the mobility of a particle by general properties of the graph \u0393. (See Section 2 for the definition and properties of the Abel-Jacobi map Si0 , where i0 is some fixed vertex of the graph.)\n\u2022 If there is a unique path from i to i\u2032, then Si0(i) = Si0(i\u2032). By the universal property of Si0 , for any U(1)-valued discrete harmonic function f that vanishes at i0, there is a\nunique group homomorphism \u03c8f : Jac(\u0393)\u2192 U(1) such that f = \u03c8f \u25e6Si0 . In particular, f(i) = f(i\u2032) for any U(1)-valued discrete harmonic function f \u2208 H(\u0393, U(1)), so there is no selection rule imposed by the time-like symmetry for a particle to move from i to i\u2032. Indeed, Figure 3 illustrates how a particle can move from i to i\u2032 in this case.\nWe can also write down the defect that describes this motion. Let i = i0 \u2192 i1 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 iK\u22121 \u2192 iK = i\u2032 be the unique path from i to i\u2032.16 The following defect describes the motion of a particle from i to i\u2032 at time \u03c4\u0302 = \u03c4\u03020:\nexp [ i \u2211 \u03c4\u0302<\u03c4\u03020 A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i) ] exp i K\u2211 k=1 \u2211 j\u2208\u0393(k) A(\u03c4\u03020, j)  exp[i\u2211 \u03c4\u0302\u2265\u03c4\u03020 A\u03c4 (\u03c4\u0302 , i\u2032) ] , (4.18)\nwhere \u0393(k) is the connected component of ik in \u0393 \\ \u3008ik\u22121, ik\u3009 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 K.\n\u2022 On the other hand, if there are at least two paths from i to i\u2032, then Si0(i) 6= Si0(i\u2032). Moreover, there is a group homomorphism \u03c8 : Jac(\u0393) \u2192 U(1) such that \u03c8(Si0(i)) 6= \u03c8(Si0(i\n\u2032)).17 So, \u03c8 \u25e6Si0 is a U(1)-valued discrete harmonic function that takes different values at i and i\u2032. It follows that a particle cannot move from i to i\u2032.\nIn particular, if \u0393 is 2-edge connected (such as a torus graph), any particle on \u0393 is a fracton. More generally, any \u0393 has the structure shown in Figure 4, where each \u0393k is a 2- edge connected graph, and the \u201clines\u201d represent paths/bridges connecting two vertices from adjacent \u0393k\u2019s\u2014for example, when each \u0393k is a single vertex, then \u0393 is a tree. By the last two paragraphs, a particle on a bridge can move along that bridge or any other bridge that shares a vertex with that bridge but nowhere else, whereas a particle \u201cinside\u201d a \u0393k cannot move anywhere.\n16Note that the arrows do not imply that the edges are directed; they only indicate that the path is from i to i\u2032.\n17Let g, h be two distinct elements in Jac(\u0393) = \u220f a<N Zra . Any element of Jac(\u0393) can be represented as an (N \u2212 1)-tuple: (s1, . . . , sN\u22121) where 0 \u2264 sa < ra. Say a < N is the first component at which g and h differ. Consider the group homomorphism \u03c8 : Jac(\u0393) \u2192 U(1) given by \u03c8 : (s1, . . . , sN\u22121) 7\u2192 e2\u03c0isa/ra . It is clear that \u03c8(g) 6= \u03c8(h)."

In particular, a configuration associated with a principal divisor can \u201ctrivially move\u201d by first being annihilated and then being created elsewhere.\nThese statements can be understood by the selection rules imposed by the time-like symmetry. A time-like superselection sector is labelled by the time-like charges of a configuration. Since the time-like symmetry group is U(1) \u00d7 Jac(\u0393), the time-like charges are valued in the Pontryagin dual, i.e., Z \u00d7 Jac(\u0393).18 The latter is precisely the Picard group Pic(\u0393). In other words, the superselection sector of a configuration is associated with the equivalence class of a divisor in Pic(\u0393). In particular, the \u201ctrivial\u201d superselection sector (with trivial time-like charges) corresponds to the equivalence class of Pic(\u0393) that consists of all the principal divisors. Therefore, a configuration can \u201cmove\u201d to another configuration if and only if they are in the same superselection sector, i.e., if and only if their divisors differ by a principal divisor (see Figure 3 for an illustration). This correspondence is summarized in Table 1."

It follows that the discrete electric time-like symmetry is ZLx . Since \u0393 is 2-edge connected, a single particle cannot move, i.e., it is a fracton. On the other hand, dipoles can move (this is similar to the dipole motion shown in Figure 3). This is in agreement with the analysis of [48].\n4.5.2 2+1d U(1) Laplacian gauge theory\nLet \u0393 be a torus graph, i.e., \u0393 = CLx \u00d7 CLy = ZLx \u00d7 ZLy , where Li is the number of sites in the i direction.

We refer to this as the 2+1d U(1) Laplacian gauge theory. It is one of the natural higher dimensional versions of the 1+1d rank-2 U(1) tensor gauge theory of Section 4.5.1.\nWhile the Jacobian group of a 2d torus graph is not generally known, since \u0393 is 2-edge connected, a single particle is a fracton. In fact, in an upcoming paper [53], we show that any finite set of particles with arbitrary charges is completely immobile (modulo sets of particles that can trivially move) on the infinite square lattice.\nA closely related gauge theory is the 2+1d rank-2 U(1) tensor gauge theory. While the 1+1d rank-2 U(1) tensor gauge theory is the same as the 1+1d U(1) Laplacian gauge theory, their 2+1d versions are very different.

We are interested in the case where X is R, U(1), Z, or ZN . Recall that the Laplacian operator \u2206L is defined as\n\u2206Lf(i) = \u2211 j Lijf(j) = dif(i)\u2212 \u2211 j:\u3008i,j\u3009\u2208\u0393 f(j) = \u2211 j:\u3008i,j\u3009\u2208\u0393 [f(i)\u2212 f(j)] . (A.1)\nOne is usually interested in the following questions: given a function g, is there a function f that satisfies the discrete Poisson equation on the graph,\n\u2206Lf(i) = g(i) ? (A.2)\nIf yes, how many solutions are there, and what are they?\nOne way to answer these questions is to use the Smith normal form of L [71]. The Smith normal form of L is given by R = PLQ, where P,Q \u2208 GLN(Z), and R = diag(r1, . . . , rN) is an N \u00d7 N diagonal integer matrix with nonnegative diagonal entries such that ra|ra+1 (i.e., ra divides ra+1) for a = 1, . . . ,N\u2212 1. While R is uniquely determined by L, the matrices P and Q are not.\nUsing the index notation, we can write the Smith normal form as Rab = \u2211 i,j PaiLijQjb, where Rab = ra\u03b4ab. While all the indices run from 1 to N, the indices i, j have natural interpretation as vertices of the graph \u0393, whereas the indices a, b do not have an immediately\nobvious interpretation.\nFor a connected graph \u0393, we have ra > 0 for a = 1, . . . ,N\u2212 1, and rN = 0. This implies\u2211 i (P\u22121)ia = 0 , \u2211 i (Q\u22121)ai = 0 , (A.3)\nfor all a < N. In fact, a convenient choice of P and Q is given by the block matrices:\nP =  P\u0303 0 1T 1  , Q =  Q\u0303 1 0T 1  , (A.4) where P\u0303 , Q\u0303 \u2208 GLN\u22121(Z). It follows that\nP\u22121 =  P\u0303\u22121 0 \u22121T P\u0303\u22121 1  , Q\u22121 = Q\u0303\u22121 \u2212Q\u0303\u221211 0T 1  , (A.5) where (A.3) is manifest.\nThe discrete Poisson equation (A.2) simplifies in a new basis. Defining\nf \u2032a = \u2211 i (Q\u22121)aif(i) ,\ng\u2032a = \u2211 i Paig(i), (A.6)\nwe can write (A.2) as\nraf \u2032 a = g \u2032 a , a = 1, . . . ,N . (A.7)\nEach a gives an independent equation, so we can solve for each f \u2032a independently. If a solution exists for all a, then a solution exists for (A.2), and vice versa.\nLet us first focus on a = N. Since rN = 0, a solution exists if and only if g \u2032 N = \u2211 i PNig(i) =\u2211\ni g(i) = 0. This condition is the same for any choice of X. If it is satisfied, then f \u2032 N can take any value in X.19 This corresponds to the zero mode (or constant mode because QiN = 1 for all i) of the Laplacian.\nNow, consider a < N so that ra > 0. Let us analyze each X separately.\n19Note that since Q \u2208 GLN(Z), if f takes values in X, then f \u2032 also takes values in X.\n\u2022 When X = R, there is always a unique solution\nf \u2032a = 1\nra g\u2032a , (A.8)\nAssuming g\u2032N = 0, the solution in the original basis is\nf(i) = \u2211 a<N \u2211 j QiaPaj ra g(j) + c , (A.9)\nwhere c is a real constant (it is the zero mode mentioned above).\n\u2022 When X = U(1), the equation (A.7) can be written as\nraf \u2032 a = g \u2032 a mod 2\u03c0 . (A.10)\nA general solution takes the form\nf \u2032a = 1\nra g\u2032a + 2\u03c0pa ra , (A.11)\nwhere pa is an integer. Since X = U(1), the integers pa and pa + ra correspond to the same solution, so there are ra inequivalent solutions associated with pa = 0, . . . , ra\u2212 1. Hence, assuming g\u2032N = 0 mod 2\u03c0, the general solution in the original basis is\nf(i) = \u2211 a<N \u2211 j QiaPaj ra g(j) + 2\u03c0 \u2211 a<N Qiapa ra + c , (A.12)\nwhere c \u223c c+2\u03c0 is a circle-valued constant.

Here, r\u0303a is a fixed integer given by r\u0303ara = gcd(N, ra) mod N (which exists by Be\u0301zout\u2019s identity), and pa is an integer.20 Note that pa \u223c pa+gcd(N, ra) because X = ZN , so there are gcd(N, ra) inequivalent solutions associated with pa = 0, . . . , gcd(N, ra)\u2212 1. So, assuming g\u2032N = 0 mod N , and g\u2032a = 0 mod gcd(N, ra) for a < N, the general solution is\nf(i) = \u2211 a<N \u2211 j Qiar\u0303aPaj gcd(N, ra) g(j) + \u2211 a<N NQiapa gcd(N, ra) + p , (A.18)\nwhere p is an integer modulo N . Since gcd(N, rN) = gcd(N, 0) = N , and QiN = 1, defining pN = p mod N , we can write the above solution as\nf(i) = \u2211 a<N \u2211 j Qiar\u0303aPaj gcd(N, ra) g(j) + \u2211 a NQiapa gcd(N, ra) , (A.19)\nwhich exists if and only if g\u2032a = 0 mod gcd(N, ra) for all a.\nThere is another useful perspective to the above analysis. Say g is a gauge field on \u0393,\nand f is its gauge parameter with gauge symmetry\ng(i) \u223c g(i)\u2212\u2206Lf(i) . (A.20)\nIn other words, g represents an equivalence class in cokerX \u2206L. We are interested in the gauge invariant information in g, i.e., the holonomies of g. Alternatively, we can ask what part of g can be gauge-fixed to zero, i.e., if there is an f satisfying (A.2). From the above analysis, the answer is the following:\n\u2022 When X = R, the only holonomy of g is g\u2032N = \u2211 i g(i). If g \u2032 N = c, then we can use the\ngauge freedom to gauge-fix g to be of the form\ng(i) = (P\u22121)iNg \u2032 N = \u03b4iNc , or g(i) =\nc N . (A.21)\n20There are infinitely many choices of r\u0303a but they can be absorbed into pa.\nHere, c is a real constant. \u2022 When X = U(1), the only holonomy of g is g\u2032N = \u2211 i g(i) mod 2\u03c0. If g \u2032 N = c, then we\ncan use the gauge freedom to gauge-fix g to be of the form\ng(i) = (P\u22121)iNg \u2032 N = \u03b4iNc , or g(i) =\nc N . (A.22)\nHere, c \u223c c+ 2\u03c0 is a circle-valued constant.\n\u2022 When X = Z, the holonomies of g are g\u2032N = \u2211 i g(i), and g \u2032 a = \u2211 i Paig(i) mod ra\nfor a < N. If g\u2032N = pN and g \u2032 a = pa mod ra, then we can use the gauge freedom to gauge-fix g to be of the form\ng(i) = \u2211 a (P\u22121)iapa . (A.23)\nHere, pN is an integer, and pa = 0, . . . , ra \u2212 1 for a < N. When pN = 0, each function in (A.23) represents a unique equivalence class of Jac(\u0393). Therefore,\nJac(\u0393) \u223c= \u220f a<N Zra . (A.24)\n\u2022 When X = ZN , the holonomies of g are g\u2032N = \u2211 i g(i) mod N , and g \u2032 a = \u2211 i Paig(i)\nmod gcd(N, ra) for a < N. Since rN = 0, we can combine them into g \u2032 a = \u2211 i Paig(i) mod gcd(N, ra) for all a. If g \u2032 a = pa mod gcd(N, ra), then we can use the gauge freedom to gauge-fix g to be of the form\ng(i) = \u2211 a (P\u22121)iapa . (A.25)\nHere, pa = 0, . . . , gcd(N, ra)\u2212 1 for all a."
