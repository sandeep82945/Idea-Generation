    "abstractText": "A parent Mg-Al-LDH was upgraded in its adsorption properties due to the incorporation of tri-metal species oxy(hydroxide) nanoparticles obtaining Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite for the phosphate recovery from simulated urban treated wastewater. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH make promising for real application without being environmentally harmful. The performance of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was evaluated through batch adsorption assays. The support of iron, manganese, and zinc (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles onto the parent Mg-Al-LDH structure was performed by precipitation, isomorphic substitution, and complexation reactions. The main improvement of the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH composite was the highest phosphate adsorption capacity (82.3 mg\u00b7g\u22121) in comparison to the parent Mg-Al-LDH (65.3 mg\u00b7g\u22121), in a broad range of concentrations and the effective phosphate adsorption at neutral pH (7.5) near to the real wastewater effluents conditions in comparison to the conventional limitations of other adsorbents. The effectiveness of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH composite was higher than the conventional metal LDHs materials synthesized in a single co-precipitation step. The phosphate adsorption onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was described to be governed by both physical and chemical interactions. The support of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ oxy(hydroxide) nanoparticles over the parent Mg-Al-LDH was a determinant for the improvement of the phosphate adsorption that was governed by complexation, hydrogen bonding, precipitation, and anion exchange. The intra-particular diffusion also described well the phosphate adsorption onto the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. Three specific stages of adsorption were determined during the phosphate immobilization with an initial fast rate, followed by the diffusion through the internal pores and the final equilibrium stage, reaching 80% of removal and the equilibrium within 1 h. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH was strongly selective towards phosphate adsorption in presence of competing ions reducing the adsorption capacity at 20%. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/MgAl-LDH has limited reusability, only 51% of the adsorbed phosphate could be recovered in the second cycle of the adsorption-desorption process. Around 14% of phosphate was loosely-bond to Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH which brings the opportunity to be a new source of phosphorus. The use of eluted concentrates and the final disposal of the exhausted adsorbent for soil amendment applications can be an integral nutrient system (P, Mn, Zn, Fe) for agriculture purposes.",

The intra-particular diffusion also described well the phosphate adsorption onto the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. Three specific stages of adsorption were determined during the phosphate immobilization with an initial fast rate, followed by the diffusion through the internal pores and the final equilibrium stage, reaching 80% of removal and the equilibrium within 1 h. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH was strongly selective towards phosphate adsorption in presence of competing ions reducing the adsorption capacity at 20%. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/MgAl-LDH has limited reusability, only 51% of the adsorbed phosphate could be recovered in the second cycle of the adsorption-desorption process. Around 14% of phosphate was loosely-bond to Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH which brings the opportunity to be a new source of phosphorus. The use of eluted concentrates and the final disposal of the exhausted adsorbent for soil amendment applications can be an integral nutrient system (P, Mn, Zn, Fe) for agriculture purposes.\nKeywords: Mg-Al-LDH; Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+; composite; phosphate; equilibrium; kinetic; thermodynamics"

The increase of urbanization is traduced on more water consumers which is the cause of deterioration of water quality since wastewater discharges contain excessive amounts of nutrients (e.g., phosphates, nitrates, and ammonia) [1]. Phosphate is the ionic\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12203680 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 2 of 25\nform of phosphorous in water; naturally, the phosphate enters the water bodies from weathering of rocks and the leaching of soil and rain [2]. Also, phosphate comes from agricultural runoff and domestic sewage (e.g., detergents and household wastes). The anthropogenic phosphorous input is responsible for the acceleration of eutrophication [3]; which is the enrichment process of nutrients in any aquatic body that outcomes in the incontrollable growth of aquatic plants. The algae\u2019s death and decay result in the reduction of dissolved oxygen [1]. Then, eutrophication is a global problem in all aquatic environments. One target of sustainable development proposed by the United Nations is the improvement of water quality by reducing pollution. However, many countries do not even have any sewage treatment systems or even it is deficient [4]. The use of wastewater seems to be the most important source for nutrient recycling since common wastewater treatment systems have a limited nutrient removal efficiency. Conventionally, phosphate removal includes biological, chemical, and physical treatment processes; however, they are expensive and non-effective in removing traces [5]. The adsorption treatment for wastewater has attracted scientists\u2019 attention as one of the most promising strategies for wastewater purification. Several organic and inorganic harmful pollutants have been efficiently removed from water and wastewater using adsorption techniques [6,7]. Thus, the adsorption process is considered optimal for phosphate removal [8] due to its high efficiency, sensitivity, and selectivity. Also, the easy operation and maintenance of the adsorption systems have been reported as the most important advantages. Several, organic and inorganic adsorbents have been largely used for phosphate removal, such as: industrial [9] and agricultural wastes [10], polymeric exchangers, natural zeolites, natural clays, and also other synthetic material (e.g., zeolites, hydrotalcites) [2,11]. However, nowadays research efforts are focused on the development of high-quality adsorbents with high performance, that allow regeneration and quick final disposal. The advent of nanotechnology has become strategic to synthesize nanoparticles and composites with high-performance properties. Unfortunately, within the manufacture of several nano-adsorbents, some harmful chemicals are necessarily becoming an environmental problem [12]. Therefore, environmentally friendly adsorbents are also desirable for real application at full scale. Within this background, the LDHs materials have been reported to be non-toxic by in vitro essays since they were used for drug delivery purposes [13]. Thus, we considered hydrotalcites (LDHs) as an ideal candidate for adsorbent for phosphate removal since maximum adsorption capacities are up to three times that reported for natural clays and zeolites [2,14]. The hydrotalcites are layered double hydroxides (LDHs) which belong to the minerals of the anionic clay family. The LDHs are hydrated minerals that can be easily synthesized as hydrotalcite-like compounds by rarely found in nature [15]. The LDHs consist of a positively charged brucite-like octahedral layer that is formed by partial substitution of a trivalent metal for a divalent one [16]. LDHs can be represented by the general formula [M2+ 1\u2212x M3+ x (OH)2]x+(An\u2212)x/n\u00b7mH2O. M2+ represents the divalent cations (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Cu2+), M3+ denotes the trivalent cations (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+) and An\u2212 is the anion (e.g., CO32\u2212, NO3\u2212, Cl\u2212, SO42\u2212). The value of x is equal to the molar ratio of M3+/(M2+ + M3+), whereas A is the interlayer anion of valence n [17]. The specific elements occupying the M2+, M3+, and An\u2212 position of LDHs determine their physicochemical properties. Also, LDHs contain anions and water molecules in the interlayer with high anion exchange capacity. The interlayer anions are exchangeable for other anions with higher selectivity [18]. LDHs provide higher characteristics in comparison to other adsorbents due to their structural stability and crystallinity. LDHs also provide binding sites for pollutant removal at both the external surface and internal surface of each individual hydroxide sheet [19]. Conventionally, the parent Mg-Al-LDHs have been reported as excellent adsorbents for phosphate removal [20,21], but the incorporation of transition metals has been used as an alternative for phosphate removal (e.g., Zn-Al, Fe-Mg) [22,23]. The binary metal combination on LDHs revealed good physicochemical properties for application in water\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 3 of 25\ntreatment. Conversely, the ternary metal combination LDHs have been reported to provide higher surface area than bimetal ones because LDHs develop a synergistic effect between two divalent metals making it interesting for its adsorption properties [9] of ionic species from water. Thus, the replacement of divalent cations (e.g., Mg2+) by trivalent cations (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+) in the layers of LDHs materials provides a positive charge that improves the phosphate adsorption capacity. Some ternary LDHs have demonstrated effectiveness towards anionic pollutants, such as the arsenate adsorption onto Cu-Mg-Fe-LDH [24], an Mg-Ca-Fe LDH for fluoride removal [25], and a Fe-Mg-Mn-LDH for phosphate removal [26]. Usually, the metallic elements are incorporated during the synthesis of the LDHs materials by the co-precipitation method [19,26]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the incorporation of metals onto LDHs has not been performed over a synthesized Mg-Al-LDH. Thus, we have developed a novel composite incorporating Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles onto Mg-Al-LDH as a promising adsorbent with high affinity to phosphate. We have considered the doping method could determine the physicochemical properties and hence the efficiency. Also, the combination of the Fe-Mn-Al elements has been proposed considering that published research based on this strategic nutrient system has not been easily found. Thus, the nutrient recovery, which is the purpose of this work, using a Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was conceived as non-toxic and non-harmful material with the potential for being used as fertilizer. Also, non-harmful elements (e.g., heavy metals) intervene during the synthesis of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. This inorganic material after the phosphate adsorption can potentially provide macro and micronutrients in the scenery of final disposal for soil amendment application. The improvement of the physical and chemical properties of soils can be performed without the risk of releasing any harmful pollutants into the water or soil. In this work, a novel Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was prepared for phosphate removal from simulated wastewater. We developed a phosphate adsorbent that does not require pH adjustment during treatment, considering the expected value of treated wastewater was in the range of pH values between 6 and 8. Most studies regarding LDHs materials are focused on the phosphate removal mechanism, with little attention given to their possible regeneration. The lack of information about the lifespan and alternatives for the environmentally friendly final disposal was our motivation to perform a complete evaluation of the phosphate adsorption onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. In this study we: (i) obtain a novel Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite for the phosphate removal at a neutral pH range, (ii) estimate the effect of pH on phosphate adsorption, (iii) determine the phosphate maximum adsorption capacity and thermodynamic behavior, (iv) assess the kinetic of phosphate adsorption, (v) investigate the selectivity towards phosphate over competing ions, (vi) evaluate the regeneration and lifespan of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite in continuous adsorption-desorption cycles and (vii) propose an alternative for final disposal of the exhausted Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH composite by means of the phosphate fractioning essay verifying the phosphate availability for plants in case of a soil amendment application. We considered that the overall information here detailed is important for further real implementation in pilot plants or large-scale systems."

The nitrogen adsorption method was used to determine the specific surface area of the adsorbents with an automatic adsorption analyzer (Micrometrics Chemisorb 2720, Norcross, GA, USA) using the single-point nitrogen gas adsorption technique. The infrared absorption spectra were recorded in the range of 4000\u2013550 cm\u22121 with a Fourier Transform FTIR spectrometer (4100 Jasco, Easton, MD, USA). The point of zero charge (PZC) by the pH drift method of the hydrotalcite samples in the modified form was determined. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was equilibrated at different ionic strength solutions in the range of pH 3\u201310, as it was described in previous work [3]. The assay was replicated three times for each sample and the average data is reported."

The pH of the phosphate solution used for each essay was adjusted by the addition of 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M NaOH. In each essay, it was determined the initial and the final phosphate concentration. It used the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, specifically the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method (4500-P C) [28]. It also used a Thermo Scientific Ionic Chromatograph (Dionex ICS-1100 and ICS-1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for anion and cation determination.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 5 of 25\n2.4.1. Effect of pH on Phosphate Adsorption\nA measured amount of 0.05 g Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample was equilibrated in 25 mL of phosphate solutions containing (25 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212) at pH values from 4 to 11. Centrifuge tubes in a rotatory stirrer, at 100 rpm at room temperature ~20 \u25e6C, were used. Afterward, the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membrane before analysis of the liquid phase. The adsorption capacity of each essay was calculated by using Equation (1)\nqe = v \u00d7 (co \u2212 ce)\nw (1)\nwhere qe was the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212), v was the volume of phosphate solution (L), co and ce were the initial and equilibrium concentration of the phosphate solution (mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212), and w was the mass of the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH (g). The essays were performed in triplicate and the average values were reported.\n2.4.2. Maximum Phosphate Adsorption Capacity\nA measured amount (0.05 g) of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample was equilibrated in 25 mL of phosphate solutions containing (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212 at pH 7.5 which is the expected conditions of real treated wastewater). The essays were performed by triplicate in centrifuge tubes in a rotatory stirrer at 100 rpm at 20 \u25e6C, 25 \u25e6C, and 30 \u25e6C. The resultant suspension was centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membrane before analysis of the liquid phase. The experimental equilibrium phosphate adsorption data were fitted to the two isotherm models. The Langmuir and Freundlich [29] isotherm models are conventionally used to describe the macroscopic adsorption data. The Langmuir model describes the homogeneous sorption sites with equal affinity, accordingly, while the Freundlich isotherm model explains adsorption onto heterogeneous sorption sites [30]. The Langmuir model is represented in the linearised form by Equation (2).\nce qe = ce qm + 1 kLqm (2)\nwhere qm is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212), kL Langmuir adsorption constant (L\u00b7mg\u22121). In the Langmuir isotherm model, the favourability of the adsorption process is defined by the separation factor rL when 0 < rL< 1 and can be calculated by Equation (3). It is a dimensionless constant that explains the Langmuir isotherm shape.\nrL = 1\n1 + kLc0 (3)\nThe Freundlich model is represented in the linearised form by Equation (4).\nln qe = ln kF + 1 n ln ce (4)\nwhere kF (mg\u00b7g\u22121) is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212) and n were the Freundlich constant.\n2.4.3. Adsorption Thermodynamics\nThe thermodynamic studies allowed the prediction of adsorption mechanisms by chemical and physical interactions. The experimental data were fitted according to the parameters of the thermodynamic laws described by Gibbs free energy (\u2206G0, kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), enthalpy (\u2206H0, kJ\u00b7mol\u22121), and entropy (\u2206S0, kJ\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121) conventionally used, determined from Equations (5) and (6) [31].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 6 of 25\n\u2206G0 = \u2212RT ln kc (5)\nThe relationship between \u2206G0, \u2206H0, and \u2206S0, is obtained as Equation (6), the wellknown van \u2019t Hoff equation.\nln kc = \u2212\u2206H0 R \u00d7 1 T + \u2206S0 R (6)\nwhere kL (L\u00b7mg\u22121) is the Langmuir constant and which could be obtained as a dimensionless parameter. The kc is obtained as a dimensionless parameter by multiplying kL by a molecular weight of adsorbate (Mw, g\u00b7mol\u22121) and then by factors 1000 and 55.5 which is the number of moles of pure water per liter, described in Equation (7) [32]. The R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121), and T is the absolute temperature (K).\nkc = kL \u00d7 Mw \u00d7 1000 \u00d7 55.5 (7)\n2.4.4. Kinetic Behavior of Phosphate Adsorption\nA measured amount of 0.05 g Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample was equilibrated in 25 mL of phosphate solutions containing (100 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212 at pH 7.5 which is the expected conditions of treated wastewater). The essays were performed by triplicate in centrifuge tubes in a rotatory stirrer at 100 rpm at room temperature ~20 \u25e6C. The centrifuge tubes were withdrawn at given times (e.g., 0.5, 1, 2.5, 10, 30 s until 24 h) and quickly separate from the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample by filtration. The resultant suspension was centrifuged for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membrane before the determination of phosphate content in the liquid phase. The phosphate adsorption capacity at time t was calculated using Equation (8).\nqt = v \u00d7 (co \u2212 ct)\nw (8)\nwhere qt was the adsorption capacity as a function of time (mg\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212) and ct was the concentration of the phosphate solution at a specific time (mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212). The phosphate removal capacity of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was calculated by Equation (9).\nRemoval (%) = (co \u2212 ct)\nco \u00d7 100 (9)\nThe experimental data of phosphate equilibrium sorption kinetics were fitted to the kinetics model of pseudo-first order (Equation (10)), pseudo-second (Equation (11)), and intraparticle diffusion model (Equation (12)) that considered adsorption might be influenced by diffusion in the spherical adsorbent and by convective diffusion in the phosphate solution.\nln(qe \u2212 qt) = ln(qe)\u2212 k1t (10) t qt = 1 k2q2e + t qe (11)\nwhere k1 (h\u22121) and k2 (g\u00b7mg\u22121\u00b7h\u22121) are the kinetics constants.\nqt = kt t 1 2 + A (12)\nwhere kt (mg\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121/2) is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and A (mg\u00b7g\u22121) is a constant that provides information about the thickness of the boundary layer. The homogenous particle diffusion model was computed for the phosphate sorption onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. If diffusion occurred in the film phase (D f , m2\u00b7s\u22121) governs the adsorption rate is described by Equation (13), but when the\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 7 of 25\nrate of adsorption is controlled by Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite particle diffusion (Dp, m2\u00b7s\u22121) it can be determined by Equation (14) [33].\n\u2212 ln ( 1 \u2212 (\nqt qe\n)) =\nD f Cs h r Cz t (13)\n\u2212 ln ( 1 \u2212 (\nqt qe\n)2) =\n2 \u03c02Dp r2 t (14)\nwhere Cs (mg\u00b7L\u22121) and Cz (mg\u00b7kg\u22121) are the phosphate concentrations in solution and in the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite, respectively, r is the average radius of the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH particle (particles below 200 mesh \u2248 radius: 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 m), t is the contact time (min) and h is the film thickness of the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite particle (1 \u00d7 10\u22125 m for a poorly stirred solution).\n2.4.5. Phosphate Adsorption Influenced by Competing Ions\nThere was a prepared binary combination of phosphate and competing anions, simulating the real wastewater scenery. A measured amount of 0.05 g Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/MgAl-LDH composite sample was equilibrated in 25 mL of phosphate solutions containing (25 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212 at pH 7.5 which is the expected conditions of treated wastewater). After, it was evaluated the effect on phosphate adsorption by the presence of nitrate, bicarbonate, chloride, and sulfate (25 mg\u00b7L\u22121). The phosphate adsorption also was evaluated in the simultaneous presence of competing anions at the same content level (25 mg\u00b7L\u22121). The essays were performed by triplicate in centrifuge tubes in a rotatory stirrer at 100 rpm at room temperature ~20 \u25e6C. The resultant suspension was centrifuged for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membrane before the determination of phosphate content in the liquid phase.\n2.4.6. Desorption of Phosphate Loaded Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH\nA measured amount of 0.05 g Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample was equilibrated in 25 mL of phosphate solutions containing (100 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212 at pH 7.5 which is the expected conditions of treated wastewater). The essays were performed by triplicate in centrifuge tubes in a rotatory stirrer at 100 rpm at a temperature of ~20 \u25e6C. The resultant suspension was centrifuged for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membrane before the determination of phosphate content in the liquid phase. The solid samples were separated from the aqueous phase for further tests. The saturated phosphate Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample was further equilibrated in closed containers using deionized water at pH 3, 6, and 9. The phosphate desorption capacity qdes was calculated using Equation (15).\nqdes = v \u00d7 ce\nw (15)\n2.4.7. Phosphate Speciation of Loaded Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH\nThe species of phosphorus loaded in saturated Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was determined based on a modified three sequential-step extraction protocol [34]. The labile fraction, metal fraction, and alkaline fractions were quantified. A weighted amount of 0.05 g Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample was equilibrated in 25 mL of phosphate solution containing (100 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7PO43\u2212 at pH 7.5 which is the expected conditions of treated wastewater). The essay was performed by triplicate in centrifuge tubes in a rotatory stirrer at 100 rpm at room temperature ~20 \u25e6C. The resultant suspension was centrifuged for 10 min and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membrane before the determination of phosphate content in the liquid phase. The solid samples were separated from the aqueous phase for further tests. The solid sample (Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH composite) was washed and dried prior to the extraction trials. The loosely bound\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 8 of 25\nphosphorus fraction (physical bound) was obtained by two consecutive extractions of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite sample (0.05 g) in 10 mL of 1 M NH4Cl (pH 7). The metal-bound fraction (e.g., iron, aluminum, etc.) was extracted by two consecutive extractions in 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH followed by extraction in 1 M NaCl. Finally, the phosphorus linked to the alkaline fraction (e.g., calcium, magnesium, etc.) was extracted by two consecutive extractions in 10 mL of 0.5 M HCl. The residual phosphorus (another type of bound) was obtained by means of mass balance between the phosphorus adsorbed and the extracted fractions."

The diffraction peaks of Mg-Al-LDH match well with the standard (Ref. Code 30000048). The hexagonal crystal hydrotalcite system of parent Mg-Al-LDH was characterized by the lattice parameters a = b = 3.05 \u00c5 which is the cation-cation distance in the brucite-like sheet and c = 22.81 \u00c5 the thickness of the brucite-like sheet and the interlayer space, comparable with other reported Mg-Al hydrotalcites [17], and indexed in the space group R-3m. The peaks with great intensity were found at 2\u03b8 = 10.1\u25e6 and 20.8\u25e6 corresponding to the diffraction planes (003) and (006); while the smaller broad and asymmetric peaks were determined at 2\u03b8 = 34.8 (009), 39.3 (012), 45.2 (018), 61.3 (110) and 63.2\u25e6 (113) [35]. The basal spacing d003 = 8.74 \u00c5 is the sum of the brucite-like sheet (4.80 \u00c5) and the interlayer space (3.94 \u00c5) of the NO3\u2212 intercalated anions. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH pattern in comparison to the parent Mg-Al hydrotalcite revealed the shifted and change of intensity of some of the characteristic peaks remained in its characteristic form. The occurrence of the anion exchange between the nitrate ions of the parent LDH and the chloride used during the incorporation of Mn2+, Fe3+, and Zn2+. Simultaneously, occurred the precipitation of iron, manganese, and zinc (oxy)hydroxides nanoparticles Fe(OH)3 (s), Zn(OH)2 (s), and Mn(OH)2 (s) by the addition of NaOH (adjusting the pH 9.0) over the surface of Mg-Al-LDH. The incorporation of Mn2+, Fe3+, and Zn2+ resulted in a decrease in the crystallinity as has been reported for other FeMgMn-hydrotalcites [26]. The partial dissolution of the metal hydroxides M(OH)n (s) into the ionic species M+ (aq) and OH\u2212 (aq) can promote the coexistence of both metal species forms M(OH)n and M+. In this study the isomorphic substitution occurred between Mn2+, Zn2+and Fe3+ elements and the original elements (e.g., Mg2+ and Al3+) of parent Mg-Al-LDH; since Mg2+ and Al3+ were quantified in the aqueous solution. Besides, the increase of the basal spacing of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite d003 = 9.71 \u00c5 was 0.97 \u00c5 higher than the parent Mg-Al hydrotalcite (8.74 \u00c5) which is commonly promoted by the increase of cation-cation distance due to the increase of interlayer distance by the decrease of electronegativity of the cations: Fe3+ (1.64) > Mn2+ (1.60) > Al3+ (1.47) according to Allred-Rochow scale. The increase of the lattice parameter of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH composite a = b = 3.04 \u00c5 and c = 27.7 \u00c5, in comparison to the parent hydrotalcite has been reported as consequence of the isomorphous replacement of Mg2+ (0.065 nm) and Al3+ (0.053 nm) by higher ionic radius elements such as Fe3+ (0.070 nm), Mn2+ (0.070 nm) [36]. The Mn-Mg-Fe-Al-LDH after the phosphate and ions adsorption increased to d003 = 10.68 \u00c5 and d003 = 10.70 \u00c5, respectively. The increase of the basal spacing in comparison with the non-adsorbed Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was attributed to the phosphate and anions intercalation in the interlayer.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 9 of 25 Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 25\nThe SEM images of the Mg-Al-LDH showed the typical structure of LDH (Figure 2).

The parent Mg-Al-LDH was characterized by the presence of magnesium, aluminum, and oxygen. After the incorporation of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ in the parent Mg-Al-LDH, it was determined the presence of new elements (e.g., chloride, manganese, zinc, and iron). The reduction of Mg2+ and Al3+ from parent Mg-Al-LDH was also verified by quantification in an aqueous solution with Mg2+: 4 mg\u2219L\u22121 and Al3+: 8 mg\u2219L\u22121. The above-mentioned mechanism of isomorphic substitution between Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ and both Mg2+ and Al3+ from the parent Mg-Al-LDH was confirmed. The existence of chloride in the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH only can be explained in terms of anion exchange between chloride and nitrate from the parent Mg-Al-LDH, because in aqueous solution it was determined 14 mg\u2219L\u22121\u2219NO3\u2212. After the phosphate adsorption, the reduction of the chloride content occurred due to the anions exchange between phosphate and both chloride and nitrate from the interlayer of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite (the aqueous solution content was determined as NO3\u2212: 4 mg\u2219L\u22121 and Cl\u2212: 5 mg\u2219L\u22121).

The existence of chloride in the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH only can be explained in terms of anion exchange between chloride and nitrate from the parent Mg-Al-LDH, because in aqueous solution it was determined 14 mg\u00b7L\u22121\u00b7NO3\u2212. After the phosphate adsorption, the reduction of the chloride content occurred due to the anions exchange between phosphate and both chloride and nitrate from the interlayer of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite (the aqueous solution content was determined as NO3\u2212: 4 mg\u00b7L\u22121 and Cl\u2212: 5 mg\u00b7L\u22121). Previous reports established metals cations (e.g., Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) are\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 11 of 25\nincorporated into the LDH structure by means of specific adsorption [inner sphere complexation reactions with the surface functional hydroxyl groups (OH\u2212)] and by non-specific adsorption [outer sphere electrostatic interactions due to the existence of deprotonated hydroxyl groups (-O\u2212)] [9]. Thus, the incorporation of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ (oxy)hydroxide nanoparticles onto the Mg-Al-LDH composite were performed by precipitation, isomorphic substitution, and surface complexation.\nThe specific surface area of parent Mg-Al-LDH was measured as 49.1 m2\u00b7g\u22121 was higher than the functionalized Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite with a value of 37.8 m2\u00b7g\u22121. The decrease in surface area was attributed to the intercalation of metals and this behavior was comparable with other hydrotalcites [35]. Even though our developed Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+-Mg-Al-LDH demonstrated a lower surface area in comparison to the parent Mg-Al-LDH. The phosphate adsorption onto LDHs has been reported not to be dependent at all on the surface area since other mechanisms are also involved [22]. The functional groups at the surface of parent Mg-Al-LDH and Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/MgAl-LDH composite were determined by Fourier transform analysis. The FTIR spectra of both LDH samples are depicted in Figure 3. The FTIR spectrum of the parent Mg-AlLDH revealed four main bands at 3398, 1649, 1348, 748, and 608 cm\u22121. The broad peak at 3398 cm\u22121 belongs to the stretching vibration of -OH groups from brucite-like layers and interlayer water molecules. The band at 1348 cm\u22121 is related to the NO3\u2212 groups existing in the interlayer of the hydrotalcite materials [35]. Besides, the bands at 608 and 748 cm\u22121 are attributed to the metal (M: Mg and Al)-oxygen bands (e.g., M-O stretching and M-O-H bending) and the band at 1649 cm\u22121 belongs to the water bending vibration of interlayer water [17]. The FTIR spectra almost remained constant after the incorporation of metal cations (e.g., Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) on the parent Mg-Al-LDH. However, the main change was identified at 3398 cm\u22121 which belongs to the -OH groups, the shift of this band was attributed to the incorporation of Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ cations on the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite structure.

After phosphate adsorption, the band at 1348 cm\u22121 shifted and the appearance of a new band at 1054 cm\u22121 was attributed to the phosphate incorporation on the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite structure.

Phosphate Adsorption Isotherms The phosphate adsorption onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models (Table 2). The maximum adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is one of the most important physicochemical parameters to characterize the adsorbent's performance [43]. In this study, we select the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms models as practical guidelines for the description of phosphate adsorption data. Even though they cannot be used to prove a specific sorption mechanism (e.g., precipitation, ion exchange, etc.) [30]. Our results can be compared to other reported LDH materials that used Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. For example, the values of phosphate maximum adsorption capacities developed by our Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite in this study are around 80 mg\u2219g\u22121, which is higher than other reported for LDHs materials obtained by a single step co-precipitation method and other adsorbents previous reported (Table 2).\nThe phosphate adsorption capacity remained invariable in the pH range from 4 to 9 which is below the pHPZC 8.9 \u00b1 0.1 of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. The phosphate adsorption can be explained in terms of electrostatic attraction betw en both H2PO4\u2212 and HPO42\u2212 species and the positive charge of the electric field over the surfac of Mn2+/Zn2 /Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite (pH < pHPZC) due to the protonation of metal cations hydroxyl groups. The for ed sites are very reactive for p osphate removal due\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 13 of 25\nto hydrogen bonding interactions. Phosphate anions (especially, HPO42\u2212) have high basicity with a pair of high electronic densities that can form a hydrogen bond with the protonated Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite surface -(OH)+ [37,38]. However, it was not detected any new mineral phase by means of XRD analysis. On the other hand, the decrease of phosphate adsorption capacity occurred at pH 10 and 11 (pH > pHPZC) which is attributed to the hydroxylation of metal cations hydroxyl groups and the hard Lewis base (OH\u2212 ions) [39] at the surface of the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite promoting the electrostatic repulsion effect with the phosphate H2PO4\u2212, HPO42\u2212 and PO43\u2212 species. Even though above the pHPZC > 8.9 \u00b1 0.1 the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/MgAl-LDH composite is supposed to promote the electrostatic repulsion effect canceling the phosphate adsorption. However, the slight reduction of the phosphate adsorption capacity above the pHPZC suggested that physical adsorption is not the unique governing mechanism. We detect a low content of Fe3+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+ and Al3+ in aqueous solution after the phosphate adsorption by means of ionic chromatography (Fe3+: 4 mg\u00b7L\u22121, Mn2+: 2 mg\u00b7L\u22121, Zn2+: 2 mg\u00b7L\u22121, Mg2+: 2 mg\u00b7L\u22121 and Al3+: 4 mg\u00b7L\u22121 at pH 7.5). Besides, the semiquantitative analysis of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH (Table 1), also suggested the reduction of Fe3+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ content after the phosphate adsorption. The release of Fe3+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ cations after the phosphate adsorption was in accordance with the conventional behavior of LDHs materials. The removal of phosphate has been reported to occur in three steps: (i) the phosphate complexation with the surface hydroxide, (ii) the adsorbed phosphate acts as a new adsorption site for the dissolved metal ions hydroxide and (iii) the adsorbed metal ion hydroxide act as a new sorption site for the phosphate remaining in the solution [40]. In the conditions used in this study, the phosphate complexation occurred when the phosphate replaced the protonated hydroxyl groups generating mono-dentate and bi-dentate inner sphere phosphate complexes with the release of OH\u2212 as a secondary product. The released cations from the LDH structure, as well as from the partial dissolution of the metal Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ (oxy)hydroxides, supported the LDH occurrence. Hence, the important issue of the pH of the equilibrated solution after the phosphate adsorption that reached an average value of 8.9 \u00b1 0.1 (Figure 4) which is associated with the buffering pH function of metal cations (e.g., Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) and their hydroxides [37]. The hydroxide forms of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ released metals precipitated over the adsorbed phosphate. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+ metal ion hydroxides act as new sorption sites for the phosphate remaining in the solution. The released cations and their hydroxides work effectively as coagulants/or precipitants for phosphate removal on the surface [41] which is another mechanism of adsorption enhancing phosphate removal. Thus, the existence of Fe3+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ in an aqueous solution can be explained in terms of the residual fractions of metal cations that cannot be precipitated in the hydroxide or phosphate forms [41]. The FTIR analysis revealed the participation of the OH groups of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite during the phosphate adsorption. Our theory about the phosphate complexation reactions was endorsed by the increase of the equilibrium pH by the effect of the release of OH\u2212 as a secondary product. Finally, anion exchange also occurred between both NO3\u2212 and Cl\u2212 the interlayer anions of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite and both phosphate H2PO4\u2212 and HPO42\u2212 species since the release of NO3\u2212 (4 mg\u00b7L\u22121) and Cl\u2212 (5 mg\u00b7L\u22121) anions were verified by means of ionic chromatography. The Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH used in this study has an advantage in comparison to other functional materials because of the high effectiveness of phosphate removal at real pH conditions of treated wastewater (between pH 6 and 8). The use of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite can be an efficient alternative for the phosphate recovery from wastewater treatment plants at their operational conditions pH of main- or side-streams after anaerobic digestion [42].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 14 of 25"

Phosphate Adsorption Kinetics The phosphate removal by Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite as a function of time is depicted in Figure 7. 50% of phosphate was removed from the synthetic wastewater solution within the five initial minutes. Within one hour the phosphate removal increased to 80%, at this time the equilibrium adsorption was almost reached. The fast adsorption of phosphate from synthetic aqueous solution is suitable for the application of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite in stirred reactors. The occurrence of electrostatic interaction and anion exchange mechanism seems to be responsible for the fast phosphate adsorption at the initial stage. Since phosphate complexation and precipitation are chemical processes that have higher time and energy requirements. The performance of phosphate adsorption onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite is better than other adsorbents used for this purpose (e.g., natural zeolites, natural clays) [2,46].\nFigure 7. Phosphate removal profile onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH as a function of time.\nThe phosphate adsorption kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 5. The experimental data of phosphate adsorption was best fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and an R2 value \u2248 0.99 was obtained. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model attributed to the occurrence of chemical adsorption is in concordance with the phosphate complexation reactions above discussed. The experimental data was also well described by the intraparticle diffusion model. The intraparticle diffusion was not the unique ratelimiting step during phosphate adsorption since the plot revealed the existence of multistage adsorption. The phosphate adsorption onto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was characterized by three specific phases: an initial stage of fast rate, followed by a slower rate, and a final equilibrium stage.

The intraparticle diffusion was n t the u ique rate-limiting step during hosphate adsorption since the plot revealed the xistence of multi-stage adsorption. The phosphate adsorption nto Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was characterized by three specific phases: an initi l stage of f st rate, followed by a slower rate, and fin l equilibrium stage. The first stage wa promoted by the film diffusion of phosphate through the hydrodynamic layer and then diffusion through the boundary layer to the external surface of the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. The second stage when the rate slows down the adsorption was endorsed by intraparticle diffusion. The final equilibrium phase was characterized by the decrease of phosphate concentration in the synthetic wastewater solution and the reduction of active sites on Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/MgAl-LDH composite [47]. The values of effective diffusion coefficients (Dp and Df) were determined in the range of 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221214 and 5.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 m2\u00b7s\u22121, respectively. The diffusion coefficients in this study are lower in comparison to other phosphate adsorbents such as metallic-loaded zeolites and clays (e.g., Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) since no comparable information was easily found on LDH materials.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 20 of 25"

The absence of competing anions (q0) was compared with the presence of each anion (qmix) and quantified as the adsorption ratio (qmix/q0) determining the decrease or improvement of phosphate adsorption. The phosphate adsorption capacity onto the Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was reduced a 10% by the presence of sulfate. In the simultaneous presence of competing anions (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, chloride, bicarbonate) a reduction of 20% of phosphate capacity was obtained. The inhibition of phosphate adsorption in presence of sulfate is explained in terms of preference for divalent charge density anions in comparison to monovalent anions as it has been previously reported for LDH materials [48]. The interference in the phosphate adsorption promoted by the coexisting anionic species (nitrate, sulfate, chloride, bicarbonate) has been attributed to the occupation of specific bonding sites [49]. On the other hand, the phosphate adsorption capacity was maintained in the presence of chloride; this phenomenon can be explained due to the preference of LDH materials towards divalent charge density anions such as phosphate. Also, chloride has been reported not to be a good competitor for phosphate adsorption since it forms preferably outer sphere complexes [47] verifying that monovalent anions did not interfere in the divalent anions adsorption. The phosphate adsorption capacity in presence of bicarbonate and nitrate was noteworthily potentiated in 10% and 40%, respectively [47]. The increase of phosphate adsorption on Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite by the effect of nitrate and bicarbonate is explained in terms of the increase of ionic strength in the solution [41]. The existence of new mineralogical phases after the phosphate adsorption on Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite in presence of competing ions was discarded by means of XDR analysis maybe be due to the content below the detection limit.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 21 of 25\nThe Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite was selective towards phosphate adsorption in presence of coexisting anions. The selectivity of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-AlLDH becomes an important operational feature since wastewater composition is diverse. Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH becomes a promising material for further application in wastewater treatment processing plants for phosphate recovery purposes."

It validates our hypothesis of electrostatic attraction (outer sphere complexation) is not the unique mechanism involved in phosphate adsorption. Besides, the loosely bound phosphorus fraction provides a guideline about the availability of phosphorous for soils and plants in the scenery of further use. The phosphorous bounded to metallic species (e.g., Mn2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) hydroxides that belong to the (Fe + Zn + Mn)\u2013P fraction is equal to 51%. It suggests the participation of hydrated metal oxide groups in phosphate adsorption by means of inner sphere complexation and precipitation. Additionally, the phosphorous bound to magnesium and other alkaline metals belong to the (Mg)\u2013P fraction. It suggests the phosphate is immobilized by the participation of precipitation reactions with the Mg hydroxides, even though no new mineralogical phases were identified by means of XRD analysis.

The intraparticular diffusion model described the best kinetical data due to the existence of three well-defined stages of adsorption. The presence of sulfate and chloride was irrelevant for the phosphate adsorption since they\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3680 23 of 25\ndid not interfere with the ability of phosphate to adsorb in the specific and non-specific bonding sites of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite. The phosphate adsorption was potentiated by nitrate and bicarbonate due to the increase of ionic strength in the solution. The reusability of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite is limited to two cycles of operation which suppose a weakness in comparison to polymeric exchangers. However, the saturated phosphate solutions obtained from adsorbent regeneration can be used for soil amendment application. Then, the use of Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite in tertiary wastewater treatment could reduce the phosphorous contents within the normative and being a new source of phosphorous nutrients for agriculture. The exhausted Mn2+/Zn2+/Fe3+/Mg-Al-LDH composite could be finally disposed of for soil amendment since it is highly selective towards phosphate and did not represent an environmental problem with the release of harmful pollutants.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: J.L.C., C.V. and D.G.; methodology: D.G.; investigation: H.C. and D.G.; resources, D.G.; data curation: H.C. and D.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation: D.G.; writing\u2014review and editing: J.L.C., C.V. and D.G.; project administration, J.L.C.; funding acquisition, J.L.C.
