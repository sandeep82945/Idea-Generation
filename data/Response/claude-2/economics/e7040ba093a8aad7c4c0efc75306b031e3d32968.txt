 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Conduct a micro-costing study with a large sample of breast cancer patients in Germany to directly estimate stage-specific costs. Link claims data from sickness funds with clinical data on cancer stage. 

2. Expand the model to account for disease recurrence and progression. Incorporate costs of treating recurrent and metastatic breast cancer.

3. Incorporate age-specific costs in the model. Compare costs of treating younger versus older breast cancer patients.

4. Validate model estimates against real-world data from multiple treatment centers in Germany. Assess generalizability of costs across different settings.  

5. Project how costs will change in the future with newer treatments and technologies. Model the budget impact of emerging personalized medicine approaches.
