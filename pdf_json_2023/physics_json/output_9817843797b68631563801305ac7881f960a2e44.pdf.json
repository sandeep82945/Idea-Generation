    "abstractText": "Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a traditional Chinese medicine with multiple pharmacological and biological activities including anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects. However, whether baicalein has a therapeutic impact on peritoneal fibrosis has not been reported yet. In the present study, network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches were performed to evaluate the role and the potential mechanisms of baicalein in attenuating peritoneal dialysis-associated peritoneal fibrosis. The results were validated in both animal models and the cultured human mesothelial cell line. Nine intersection genes among baicalein targets and the human peritoneum RNA-seq dataset including four encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis samples and four controls were predicted by network analysis. Among them, MMP2, BAX, ADORA3, HIF1A, PIM1, CA12, and ALOX5 exhibited higher expression in the peritoneum with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis compared with those in the control, which might be crucial targets of baicalein against peritoneal fibrosis. Furthermore, KEGG and GO enrichment analyses suggested that baicalein played an anti-peritoneal fibrosis role through the regulating cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. Moreover, molecular docking analysis revealed a strong potential binding between baicalein and MMP2, which was consistent with the predictive results. Importantly, using a mouse model of peritoneal fibrosis by intraperitoneally injecting 4.25% glucose dialysate, we found that baicalein treatment significantly attenuated peritoneal fibrosis, as evident by decreased collagen deposition, protein expression of \u03b1-SMA and fibronectin, and peritoneal thickness, at least, by reducing the expression of MMP2, suggesting that baicalein may have therapeutic potential in suppressing peritoneal dialysis-related fibrosis.",

However, whether baicalein has a therapeutic impact on peritoneal fibrosis has not been reported yet. In the present study, network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches were performed to evaluate the role and the potential mechanisms of baicalein in attenuating peritoneal dialysis-associated peritoneal fibrosis. The results were validated in both animal models and the cultured human mesothelial cell line. Nine intersection genes among baicalein targets and the human peritoneum RNA-seq dataset including four encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis samples and four controls were predicted by network analysis. Among them, MMP2, BAX, ADORA3, HIF1A, PIM1, CA12, and ALOX5 exhibited higher expression in the peritoneum with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis compared with those in the control, which might be crucial targets of baicalein against peritoneal fibrosis. Furthermore, KEGG and GO enrichment analyses suggested that baicalein played an anti-peritoneal fibrosis role through the regulating cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. Moreover, molecular docking analysis revealed a strong potential binding between baicalein and MMP2, which was consistent with the predictive results. Importantly, using a mouse model of peritoneal fibrosis by intraperitoneally injecting 4.25% glucose dialysate, we found that baicalein treatment significantly attenuated peritoneal fibrosis, as evident by decreased collagen deposition, protein expression of \u03b1-SMA and fibronectin, and peritoneal thickness, at least, by reducing the expression of MMP2, suggesting that baicalein may have therapeutic potential in suppressing peritoneal dialysis-related fibrosis.\nKEYWORDS\nchronic kidney disease, peritoneal dialysis, peritoneal fibrosis, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, baicalein"

            "text": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an important alternative therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease (See et al., 2018). Effective PD depends on structural and functional integrities of the peritoneal membrane, but long-term PD may cause progressive peritoneal membrane fibrosis or even encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), ultimately resulting in ultrafiltration failure and increased mortality (Morelle et al., 2015). EPS is characterized by intraperitoneal inflammation and marked sclerotic thickening of the peritoneum, as well as systemic malnutrition accompanied by intestinal adhesion and obstruction (Johnson et al., 2010). Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, accumulating evidence has suggested that peritoneal fibrosis occurs in response to a cascade of injuries, including continuous exposure to bioincompatible dialysate (Davies et al., 2001), uremic toxins (Williams et al., 2002), and peritonitis (Davies et al., 1996). Upon these stimulations, inflammation (Balzer et al., 2019), neoangiogenesis (Kariya et al., 2018), and mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) (Chen et al., 2014) are thought to be crucial pathological changes and ultimately result in discontinuation of PD treatment (Zhou et al., 2016). Multiple therapeutic regimes for PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis have been trialed, but most of them have been animal studies and further clinical validation is lacking (Nakayama et al., 2017; Herzog et al., 2021). Thus, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PD patients with EPS and performed target-based screening by network pharmacology to explore the anti-fibrotic compound targeting EPS.\nBaicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone; BAI) is a flavonoid derived from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis and has a long history of use (Li et al., 2014). Baicalein has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-fibrotic effects (Bie et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2017). Among the five extracts of S. baicalensis, baicalein exhibits the highest anti-fibrotic efficacy (Zhou et al., 2022). Additionally, baicalein ameliorates fibrosis in multiple organs, including the heart, lung, liver, and kidney, by regulating inflammatory signaling pathways (Li et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018). Baicalein is also safe and well tolerated in animal studies. Notably, baicalein transdermal administration significantly attenuates skin hypertrophic scar formation and collagen deposition in a mechanical load-induced mouse model (Zhang et al., 2016), suggesting that baicalein acts on the skin surface. The peritoneum has the surface area and resembles the body surface (Lemoine et al., 2016). We, thus, hypothesized that baicalein may exert a therapeutic effect on peritoneal fibrosis via intraperitoneal injection.\nGiven multidirectional pharmacology and system biology, network pharmacology is an emerging subject of systematic drug research. The associations among a drug, target, and disease are comprehensively analyzed by data mining at the molecular level, and potential targets of a drug are predicted (Li et al., 2022a). To date, network pharmacology has been widely applied to explore the mechanism of compounds in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).\nIn this study, network pharmacology analysis was performed to investigate the role and mechanisms of baicalein in PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis. The prediction results were validated in vitro by the TGF-\u03b21 treatment of the cultured human mesothelial cell line (MeT-5A cells) and in vivo using a mouse model of peritoneal\nfibrosis. The flowchart of this study is shown in Figure 1. This is the first report of the anti-fibrotic effect of baicalein in PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis via formulation with peritoneal dialysate as an intraperitoneal injection drug, which provides a new strategy for the development of novel dialysates to slow down peritoneal fibrosis."

DEGs between EPS and CTL were obtained using the limma package in R software (Ritchie et al., 2015). DEGs were defined as | log (fold change) |\u2265 1 and p < 0.05. A volcano map and clustered heat map were generated using ggplot2 plotting and pheatmap library in R software, respectively (Gu et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2018).\nBaicalein target gene acquisition and common target gene analysis\nThe molecular structure of baicalein was retrieved from PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database and the SwissTargetPrediction and analysis platform (Ru et al., 2014) were used to determine baicalein target genes. CTGs of baicalein among EPS-related DEGs (EPS-DEGs) were identified using the Venn diagram R package. To better understand the interactions of DEGs, a Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) was performed to construct a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network for CTGs (Kathuria et al., 2020). PPI networks were visualized by Cytoscape v3.5.1. The expression condition of CTGs in EPS was visualized by a clustered heat map using complex pheatmap library in R software. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed in R using the pROC software package to calculate the cutoff values of CTGs, and AUC was used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy.\nMetascape common target gene list analysis\nFor the CTG list, pathway and process enrichment analysis was carried out with the following ontology sources: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets, Canonical Pathways, Collection of experimentally verified mammalian protein complexes, and Wiki Pathways using Metascape (https:// metascape.org) (Chen et al., 2021). Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text-mining was used to infer regulatory interactions between human\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\ntranscription factors and CTGs (Han et al., 2018). All genes in the genome were used as the enrichment background. Terms with p-value < 0.01, a minimum count of 3, and enrichment factor > 1.5 (enrichment factor is the ratio between the observed count and the count expected by chance) were collected and grouped into clusters by their membership similarities. To further capture the\nFIGURE 1 Flow chart of this study.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03\nrelationships between the terms, a subset of enriched terms was selected and rendered as a network plot, where terms with similarity >0.3 were connected by edges. The network was visualized using Cytoscape v3.5.1.\nMolecular docking of baicalein components\nThe three-dimensional (3D) structure of baicalein was obtained from the PubChem database. The structure was minimized with the MMFF94 force field (Anderson et al., 2017). All crystal structure coordinates were downloaded from the protein data bank (http:// www.rcsb.org/) or AlphaFold database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk) (Trott et al., 2010). All water, hydrogen, and ligand molecules were removed from the crystal structure using PyMol 2.5 software prior to docking. The docking site was defined to cover the entire active site. Both the ligand and receptor were converted to the PDBQT format using ADFRsuite 1.0. Docking calculations were performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 (http://vina.scripps.edu/) with exhaustiveness set at 32 (Sahoo et al., 2018). We selected the conformation with the highest total score, visualized, and analyzed with PyMOL 2.5 (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA, United States)."

The baseline clinical characteristics are detailed in DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0056389.A box plot showed the median of each sample on a horizontal line, indicating good normalization between the samples (Supplementary Figure S1). Next, we identified DEGs with the criteria of | log (fold change) | \u22651 and p < 0.05 (Supplementary Excel File 1).

Therefore, we compared common target genes (CTGs) of baicalein and EPS-DEGs. A total of 125 target genes of baicalein were obtained by TCMSP and SwissTargetPrediction (Figure 3A) and converted into symbols of corresponding genes using UniProt (Supplementary Excel File 2). Additionally, nine intersecting target genes were identified among baicalein targets and EPS-DEGs\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05\n(Figure 3B) that were further explored by the PPI analysis. The PPI network of these nine common genes yielded significant gene interactions using the STRING database (Figure 3C). Moreover, BAX, ADORA3, HIF1A, PIM1, CA12, MMP2, and ALOX5 exhibited low expression in the CTL group and high expression in the EPS group (Figure 3D). Combined with\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org06\nthe results of PPI, these genes may be major therapeutic targets of baicalein. We validated these results through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the nine CTGs for PD-related EPS. As shown in Figure 3E, all area under curve (AUC) values of CTGs except for PLA2G4A and ADORA3 were more than 0.9 and exhibited high sensitivity and specificity. This suggests that CTGs had a superior ability as predictive diagnostic biomarkers for PD-related EPS.\nFunctional enrichment analysis of CTGs\nTo clarify the potential biological functions of nine CTGs, further analysis was performed using Metascape. The pathway and process enrichment analysis revealed that these CTGs were closely associated with cell proliferation and inflammation including interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling, AGE-RAGE signaling, cancer pathways, regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, regulation of cell secretion, and the inflammatory response\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07\n(Figure 4A; Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Excel File 3). These pathways and processes exhibited significantly overlap or intersected with each other (Figure 4A). Moreover, these CTGs were transcriptionally regulated by RELA, NFKB1, and HIF-1 (Figure 4B; Supplementary Table S3). These results implied that baicalein might improve peritoneal fibrosis by regulating CTG-mediated pathways and processes."

            "text": "Peritoneal fibrosis is a critical complication of PD. The pathological alterations may lead to ultrafiltration failure and eventually to the discontinuation of therapy. Chronic exposure to the bioincompatible dialysate has demonstrated to result in the fibrosis of the peritoneal membrane, but there is lack of effective treatment strategies. Although the new peritoneal dialysis solution, such as icodextrin, has been demonstrated to slow down the occurrence of peritoneal fibrosis (Goossen et al., 2020), a study revealed that icodextrin may lead to early local inflammation and marked angiogenesis in the peritoneum (Schaefer et al., 2018). The addition of Ala-Gln to PDs protected the peritoneum, probably via the modulating IL-17 expression (Ferrantelli et al., 2016). Additionally, H2 (Nakayama et al., 2017) and LiCl (Herzog et al., 2021) have been studied as dialysate additives to preserve peritoneum integrity, whose safety, feasibility, and cost effectiveness need to be further investigated.\nPrevious studies have shown that intravenous administration of baicalein significantly improves multi-organ fibrosis, suggesting its anti-fibrotic effect (Sun et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015b). Moreover, baicalein administered intradermally attenuates hypertrophic scar formation, demonstrating direct absorption of baicalein by penetrating the skin barrier to exert an anti-fibrotic effect (Zhang et al., 2016). The peritoneum as a serosal membrane lining in the abdominal cavity consists of mesothelial cells and connective tissue, which suffers from repeatedly stimulation by high-glucose peritoneal dialysate and glucose metabolites. However, it is unclear whether baicalein has a therapeutic effect on PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis.\nIn this study, we attempted to explore the protective role of baicalein in both a mice model of peritoneal fibrosis and the cultured human mesothelial cells. We found that treatment with baicalein resulted in remarkably decreased extracellular matrix deposition and improved thickening of the peritoneum in mice, as compared with those treated with vehicle. Additionally, baicalein suppressed TGF\u03b21-induced ECM secretion of mesothelial cells. Our results indicated that baicalein has a great clinical potential and might be a therapeutic strategy for peritoneal fibrosis.\nTo investigate how baicalein protected the peritoneum from fibrosis, network pharmacological analysis was performed to identify nine common genes among baicalein targets and EPS-related DEGs. The PPI network showed that many important proteins of biological pathways were involved in baicalein-mediated therapeutic processes in PD-associated peritoneal fibrosis. HIF1A widely participates in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. A study by Yang et al. (2021) showed that activation of STAT3/HIF1A signaling mediated mesothelial to mesenchymal transition and ultimately alleviated peritoneal fibrosis. MMP2 expression increased after Chlorhexidine Gluconate-induced peritoneal fibrosis, whichmay be related to ECMdegradation (Cui et al., 2022). BAX, PIM1, AR, and others are involved in signaling pathways such as apoptosis, cell migration, and metabolism which also involved in peritoneal fibrosis (Li et al., 2022b). The PPI indicated the complexity of peritoneal fibrosis and suggested that the therapeutic effects of baicalein involved multiple molecular mechanisms and network interactions of target proteins. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis further indicated that the most important mechanism of baicalein in protection against peritoneal fibrosis were probably related to cell secretion and inflammation.\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a large family of zincrequiring enzymes, and involved in several pathological processes such as migration, wound healing, inflammation, and fibrosis. Numerous studies have shown that MMPs exhibit low activity under normal conditions and increased activity during inflammation or repair (Santos et al., 2014). In CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, mRNA expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in the liver is elevated significantly (Zhang et al., 2022). Additionally, MMP7 mRNA expression is markedly upregulated in kidney tissues of chronic kidney disease patients (Zheng et al., 2022). At the early stage of renal fibrosis, MMP2 facilitates degradation of the glomerular baseline membrane and destroys the filtration barrier, which accelerates CKD progression (Cheng et al., 2022). However, in the late stage, the MMP2 activity is inhibited and ECM degradation decreases, promoting renal fibrosis (Ronco et al., 2007). A study showed that MMP2 alleviates kidney fibrosis in gene knockout mice (Tveitaras et al., 2015). Consistently, downregulating MMP2 by siRNA inhibited TGF-\u03b21 stimulated the expression of \u03b1-SMA and fibronectin in cultured human mesothelial cells. Therefore, targeting MMP2 may attenuate the progression of peritoneal fibrosis during PD treatment.\nIn the present study, molecular docking analyses showed that MMP2 had great binding potential with baicalein. We validated the mRNA expression levels by RT-qPCR. Among nine DEGs, baicalein only reduced TGF-\u03b21-induced MMP2 expression in cultured human mesothelial cells, indicating that MMP2 might be a crucial target of baicalein in alleviating peritoneal fibrosis. Indeed, in a mice model of high-glucose based dialysis solutioninduced peritoneal fibrosis, we found that the mice on PD developed peritoneal fibrosis with increased MMP2 expression, which was reversed by baicalein addition to the PD solution.\nThere are some limitations in this study. The results were limited because of the small sample size obtained from a public database with only eight samples. Moreover, although nine CTGs were found and MMP2 was verified to be involved in mechanism of action, the underlying upstream or downstream relationship between MMP2 and baicalein needs to be explored. We also only studied the anti-fibrosis effects of baicalein in mesothelial cells and did not explore its role in regulating inflammatory. Therefore, further\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12\nstudies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which baicalein inhibits the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis."
