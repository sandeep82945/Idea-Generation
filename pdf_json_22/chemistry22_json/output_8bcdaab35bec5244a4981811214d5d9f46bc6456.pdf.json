    "abstractText": "The present study encompasses the ethnomedicinal consumption of Corchorus depressus (L.) C.Chr. (C. depressus) for diabetes. Plant samples were subjected to LC-ESIMS analyses. The n-hexane, methanolic and water extracts were screened for \uf061-glucosidase inhibition and in vivo anti-diabetic studies. Further, antioxidant (DPPH) and antiinflammatory study was performed via luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay. The identified compounds were docked against the target enzymes of diabetes. The n-hexane fraction (CD-J1) showed IC50 of 8.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg mL -1 \uf020against\uf020\uf061-glucosidase enzyme. The subfractions CD-12 and CD-13 of CD-J1 obtained after flash column chromatography displayed further reduced IC50 values of 4.3 \uf0b1 0.1 and 6.3 \uf0b1 0.1, respectively, as compared with standard drug acarbose (IC50 values of 37.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcg mL -1 ). Simultaneously, dereplication of the most active sub-fraction CD-12 by LC-ESI-MS led to the identification of strophanthidin and some other active metabolites responsible for anti-diabetic activity. Molecular docking of strophanthidin with \uf061-glucosidase and \uf061-amylase revealed high affinity for these target enzymes.",

Warris (Voucher No.3473/CIDS/IUB) a taxonomist at Cholistan Institute of Desert Studies, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. Dried and powdered whole plant material (150 g) collected in different seasons (January, May and September) was macerated separately in 1.5 L of n-hexane at room temperature for 10 days. Extraction was repeated x 3 to get hexane extracts. The whole procedure resulted 03 extracts of hexane namely CD-J1 (January 2018), CD-M1 (May 2018), CD-S3 (September 2018) for three different seasons. Subsequently, similar procedure was repeated with 1.5 L of methanol to get methanol extracts namely CD-J4 (January 2018), CD-M5 (May 2018), CDS6 (September 2018) followed by maceration with double distilled water to get aqueous extracts namely CD-J7 (January 2018), CD-M8 (May 2018), CD-S9 (September 2018). For fractionation and chromatographic purposes, 7 kg dried plant powder (collected in January)\nwas soaked in 15 L hexane for 10 days.

The alloxan dose was optimized through earlier trials (data not shown). Subsequently experimental rats were given a 20% dextrose solution after four hours of alloxan injection to avoid alloxan induced hypoglycemia in rats due to excessive discharge of insulin from necrotic pancreas (Mohammed, Kakey et al. 2020). All experimental rats were maintained on 5% glucose in drinking water (Kumar, Nandakumar et al. 2011) for next 24 hours. Glucometer was used to monitor glucose levels. All the animals with \u2265 200 mg/dL blood glucose levels were selected for the evaluation of anti-diabetic effect of crude C. depressus extracts (Ahmad, Ullah et al. 2020).\nAnimals grouping and drug administration The on-set of diabetes mellitus DM was noted from the fifth day of initial dose of alloxan. Animals were acclimatized in this condition around one week. Fasting blood glucose levels were tested on 7 th day after dividing animals into different groups. As per literature, the DM management was commenced at the same day by considering it the 0 day of the study. Sequel determination of fasting blood glucose levels was carried out on 0, 1 st and 4 th days (ElDemerdash, Yousef et al. 2005; Kumar, Nandakumar et al. 2011).

Therefore, homology modeling was performed using isomaltase from S. cerevisiae (PDB ID: 3A4A) as a template (Yamamoto, Miyake et al. 2010), using the protocol mentioned in the (Barakat, Ali et al. 2017). While, the crystal structure of alpha \u03b1-amylase (PDB ID: 1B2Y) was retrieved from protein data bank. Water molecules were removed, and both proteins were prepared and protonated by using structure preparation module available in MOE. The compound was build using the builder module of MOE 2018.0101 (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2013.08; Chemical Computing Group ULC, 1010 Sherbooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2018. 2018). Further compound was charged and minimized by using MMFF94x force field (Halgren 1996). For docking simulation default parameters were used. Thirty conformations were generated and saved in mdb format (Ghufran, Rehman et al. 2020).\nResults\nFigure S1a. LC-MS chromatogram of the analyzed sample.\nFigure S1b.
