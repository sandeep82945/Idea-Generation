    "abstractText": "In the realm of nanoparticles, metal-based nanoparticles have traditionally been regarded as the pioneering category. Compared to other nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles have several advantages, including optical and biological properties, which provide them a significant competitive advantage in clinical and biological applications. In the current investigation, we used an aqueous Mangifera indica seed extract to synthesize nanoparticles of zinc oxide (ZnO NPs). UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, atomic force spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the synthesized ZnO NPs. The nanoparticles were assessed for their potential to inhibit bacterial growth and protect cells from free radical damage. According to the current study\u2019s findings, zinc oxide nanoparticles that had been modified with the aid of mango seeds were very efficient in preventing the development of the tested bacteria and were also powerful antioxidants.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology has been gaining attention recently as a potential platform for future growth in several fields. Nanotechnology has drawn significant attention in the healthcare, engineering and food industries by offering novel prospects in the respective fields. In particular, theranostics, a cutting-edge combination system of therapeutics and diagnostics, utilize nanotechnology principles for target-specific drug delivery and enhanced bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients [1,2]. The field of nanotechnology deals with various synthesis methods, particle size reformations and structural variations of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are nanosized materials ranging in size <100 nm with high thermal stability, high surface-to-volume ratio, high electrical, mechanical, optical as well as magnetic properties [3]. In the last decade, the use of nanoparticles has been the most significant archetype advancement in engineering, medicine and technology [4]. Nanoparticles may be classified as organic and inorganic nanoparticles. While metals and metal-derived oxide nanoparticles come under the inorganic nanoparticles classification, organic nanoparticles include solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based nanocarriers, liposomes and carbon-based nanomaterials [5]. Metal nanoparticles are promise for site-specific drug administration, clinical diagnostics, bio-imaging, dental implants, and biomedicine due\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2818. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062818 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2818 2 of 15\nto their selectivity, sensitivity, optical, and electrical capabilities [6,7]. The method used to synthesize metal nanoparticles is an important key factor. Synthesis of metal nanoparticles may be accomplished using a wide variety of physical and chemical methods, including solgel, chemical reduction, hydrothermal, laser ablation, ion sputtering, etc., [8,9]. However, these methods encounter many downsides, including cost-expensive, instrumentations, skilled labour and environmental toxicity. Therefore, the green synthesis method has become an optimal method of choice for nanoparticles, wherein plants and microorganisms are used [9,10]. Furthermore, the green synthesis method of nanoparticle preparation has been considered eco-friendly and safer due to its stabilizing and reducing potentials [10]. Many different metals, including silver (Ag) [10], gold (Au) [11], copper (Cu) [12] and trace elements [13], have been used as reduction and coating agents for the fabrication of nanoparticles. Nevertheless, Ag, Au and Cu nanoparticles have been reported for their toxicity and consequent limit in clinical applications [10\u201312]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a rare, inorganic metallic oxide that has received significant attention as a safe, biocompatible and economical material. US FDA has approved ZnO as the safest metal oxide [14]. Zinc is best recognized for maintaining protein and nucleic acid interactions in cells and tissues. As compared to other physiologic metals like iron, cobalt, and manganese, ZnO\u2019s chemical stability is far superior [15]. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) possess a wide range of engineering applications, such as catalysis, a piezoelectric device, pigments, chemical sensors, bio-molecular detection, diagnostic, cosmetic material and especially for UV protection [16\u201322]. Additionally, ZnO NPs have been demonstrated to possess anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic properties [23\u201326]. As ZnO is considered safe and exhibits significant antimicrobial properties, it has the potential against infectious diseases [26]. On exposure to metal nanoparticles, the bacterial cell membrane undergoes depolarization due to adsorption, resulting in permeability changes in the bacterial cell wall. Further, the changes lead to the free radical formation and thus cause membrane damage resulting in antibacterial or bactericidal activity [27,28]. Green nanotechnology has originated from green chemistry, which seeks to synthesize metal nanoparticles using medicinal plants. Medicinal plants are reliable sources of several chemical components needed to synthesize metallic nanoparticles [29], viz. polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenes, etc., which act as potent agents to reduce the metal from ionic state into its respective oxide forms during the process [8,30]. Phytochemicals found in medicinal plants have replaced the reducing agents\u2019 sodium citrate, ascorbate and sodium borohydride in the chemical manufacturing technique of nanoparticles. As a result, the potentially harmful effects of chemical-reducing agents on the environment will be mitigated [29,31]. As a result, scientists are increasingly interested in developing methods for creating metal-based nanoparticles from plant extracts that are benign to the surrounding ecosystem. The biosynthesis of ZnO NPs has been shown utilizing several plant extracts, including Lobelia leschenaultiana [32], Agathos mabetulina [33], Laurus nobilis [34], Moringa olifera [35], Acalypha indica [36], Aspalathus linearis [37], Carica papaya [38], green tea leaves [39], Euphorbia jatropa latex [40], Andrographis paniculata [41], Chamaecostus cuspidatus [42]. Compared to the above sources, the advantage of preparing ZnO NPs using mango seed extracts has been cost-effectiveness, as rinds and seeds are considered waste materials. However, the mango seed powder contains protein, oil, crude fiber and carbohydrate and is also enriched in potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium and sodium. Non-essential amino acids such as arginine and glutamic acid and essential amino acids such as valine and phenylalanine are also present. In addition, it has other vitamins, including different Vitamin B (1, 2, 6 and 12), Vitamin C and Vitamin K. The nutritious value of mango seed powder is much higher [43]. Mangoes were used in the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles, an economically and ecologically sound breakthrough [44,45]. Hence, our work synthesized ZnO NPs using mango seed extract. The structure and shape of synthesized ZnO NPs were investigated using a variety of techniques, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis.), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2818 3 of 15\n(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and including atomic force microscopy (AFM). The antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ZnO NPs that were produced through green synthesis have also been investigated."

UV-Visible Spectrum of synthesized ZnO NPs using Magnifera indica seed extract.\n2.2. FT-IR Spectroscopy Characterization and an explanation of the functional groups involved in the synthesis, reduction, and stabilization of ZnO NPs were accomplished with the assistance of FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2, ZnO NPs may be mediated by extracts from mango seeds. Specifically, a prominent peak was detected at 3336.85 cm\u22121, analogous to the stretching vibration of \u2212OH and \u2013NH2 groups. These functional groups could be produced from the water and mango seed extract [8]. Further, another broad peak was observed at 2924.09 cm\u22121, corresponding to the carboxylic group\u2019s O-H stretch. This peak can be seen in the spectrum. The peak at 1658.78 cm\u22121, which coincides with the C = O stretch that the ketone group has. The N = O bend of nitro groups is related to a peak located at 1352.10 cm\u22121, and peaks at 1203.58 cm\u22121 and 1020.34 cm\u22121, are associated with the C-O stretch of ester and ether groups, respectively. The peaks associated with aromatic groups are located at 825.53 cm\u22121, 754.17 cm\u22121, and 416.62 cm\u22121. Although numerous studies have reported using plant extracts for metal nanoparticle synthesis, the mechanism of bio-reduction is still elusive. On the other hand, the phytochemicals that are present in the plant source are the ones that are thought to be responsible for the nanoparticles' reduction and stabilization [14,46]. In agreement, we speculate in the present study that the phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenes found in the seed extract, might be deeply involved in the bio-reduction of the nanoparticles [42,43]."

            "text": "Green nanotechnology employs medicinal plants for the synthesis of metal as well as other nanomaterials that have the potential to be used in the identification and treatment of various diseases/disorders. Metal nanoparticles synthesized from medicinal plants, microbes and other food sources have been shown to be safe and economical. However, environmental sustainability is a concern due to the load on global food security and the scarcity of natural resources [51]. In this context, researchers have initiated to utilize the biowaste materials from various plant and fruit sources to synthesize metal-based and metallic oxide nanoparticles. Several ways for generating ZnO NPs utilizing various plant extracts have been established by researchers [32\u201342]. We report here on the large - scale production of ZnO NPs by using an aqueous extract of mango seed powder as the raw material. The ZnO NPs were produced by combining a zinc nitrate solution combination with an aqueous extract of mango seeds as the phytoconstituents throughout the synthesis process. The solution\u2019s colour dramatically altered after being incubated for a certain amount of time. The shift in hue is attributed to the production of ZnO NPs and the resulting surface plasmon resonance from the collective excitation of free electrons in the NPs. The qualitative phytoconstituent analysis of aqueous mango seed extract showed the presence of polyphenols, tannins, flavonoids and terpenoids, which might be attributed as responsible for biological properties. These phytochemicals found in the mango seed aqueous extract may also be liable for reducing the Zinc ions to zinc oxide and, thus, nanoparticle preparation. In this work, we used green synthesis, an environmentally friendly approach to create ZnO NPs from fruit biowaste. A zinc nitrate solution was combined with an aqueous extract of mango seeds in order to produce ZnO NPs. This method was determined to be cheap, quick and safe for the environment. In a previous investigation, ZnO NPs were synthesized using the seeds of the longan fruit. The seed was found to be enriched in catechin and flavonoids [52]. The current investigation also employed Mango seed extract to produce ZnO NPs. The findings demonstrated the emergence of ZnO NPs. ZnO NPs formation was originally seen as a colour shift in the metal solution upon addition of mango seed extract; this observation was subsequently confirmed using further physicochemical techniques. Absorption spectra at 480 nm, typical of ZnO NPs, were observed through UV-Vis spectroscopy. Previous research also reported the UV-Visible absorption peak up to 381 nm using Pomegranate extract [53]. The FT-IR analysis demonstrates the presence of carboxylic, ketone, nitro, ester and ether groups. The XRD analysis predicts seven prominent peaks. The SEM data indicate the presence of spherical and cylindrical nanoparticles between the size range of 40\u201370 nm and a few rectangular and triangular particles. Recently, a study by Rini et al. (2021) reported that ZnO NPs synthesized using Ananas comosus peel extract had a spherical shape [54]. The findings of EDAX indicate the existence of carbon, oxygen and zinc. The morphology of the nanoparticle\u2019s surface is studied using an AFM. In addition, data on the size and surface roughness of the produced nanoparticles are provided. The TEM analysis identified the nanoparticle\u2019s shape as spherical and the size ranging from 40\u201360 nm. It was reported in a prior research that the average size of the ZnO NPs that were synthesized using Azadirachta indica extract was 9.6\u201325.5 nm, and that their form was spherical [55]. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2818 12 of 15\nAFM may be used to take 3D images without causing any damage. The AFM data indicated that the nanoparticles were present in the spherical form [56]. Furthermore, the mango seed extract-assisted ZnO NPs have been demonstrated to possess potent antibacterial and antioxidant properties, as observed from agar well diffusion assay and DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Even while research has shown that ZnO NPs has a powerful antioxidant capacity, the method by which this occurs is still a mystery. During the green synthesis of nanoparticles, the functional groups of the phytoconstituents have been shown to form a linkage with the ZnO. This linkage may improve the potential of ZnO NPs in free radical scavenging effect [57]. The high redox potential of the ZnO breaks the water molecules into hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals, stabilizing the DPPH free radicals and inhibiting the DPPH effect [58]. According to the findings, there was a considerable increase in the inhibitory capacity of ZnO NPs against the DPPH free radicals that was dose-dependent. It may be deduced from this that the ZnO NPs that were manufactured using the mango seed extract exhibited a substantial amount of antioxidant activity. Furthermore, as was previously indicated, the phytoconstituents\u2019 functional groups adsorbing onto the nanoparticles\u2019 surfaces might be a contributing cause to their inhibitory action on free radicals [59]. One of the most significant issues in the medical field is the incorrect and excessive use of antibiotics, which results in antimicrobial resistance. The persistent emergence of bacterial resistance has raised the need for novel antibiotics. Metal nanoparticles, which have been reported to have potent antibacterial action in a majority of investigations, are considered among the promising as well as novel antibiotic agents [27,28]. Production of new biomedical implants involves the use of metallic nanoparticles in order to prevent any bacterial infections [59]. As a result, one of our goals was to determine whether or not the ZnO NPs that we had manufactured using mango seed extract have any antibacterial properties. In the present experiment, it was discovered that the ZnO NPs that were artificially manufactured have a substantial antibacterial activity. ZnO NPs have been shown to inhibit bacterial growth via a variety of distinct methods, which has led to its use in antibacterial applications. According to a number of studies, metal nanoparticles have the ability to physically interact with the cell wall of bacteria, as well as with sub-cellular components [60]. On exposure to metal nanoparticles, the bacteria\u2019s cell wall undergoes membrane damage due to the adsorption of metal oxide on the cell wall. The negatively charged surface of the bacteria stimulates electrostatic interactions between strong positive charges such as ZnO (>9) with high isoelectric points [58]. This results in the membrane depolarization effect, which alters the cell wall\u2019s permeability, allowing an easier penetration of the nanoparticles and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the bacterial cell. The increased ROS production eventually causes oxidative stress and elevates lipid peroxides, thereby degradation of macromolecules and resulting in cell death [61,62]. Ion leaching is another proposed mechanism for the antibacterial effect of metal nanoparticles. The pH and rate of dissolution of ZnO NPs have also been shown to cause inhibition in bacterial cell growth [28,63]. Further, it was also reported that spherical-shaped nanoparticles could easily penetrate the cell wall of the bacteria, thus resulting in cellular membrane damage [48]."
