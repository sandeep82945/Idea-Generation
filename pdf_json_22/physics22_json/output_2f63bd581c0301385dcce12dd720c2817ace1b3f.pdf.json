    "abstractText": "This report outlines a proposed method of packaging wide-angle (WA) mini-light-emitting diode (mini-LED) devices without optical lenses to create a highly efficient, ultrathin, flexible planar backlight for portable quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED) displays. Since the luminous intensity curve for mini-LEDs generally recommends a beam angle of 120\u25e6, numerous LEDs are necessary to achieve a uniform surface light source for a QLED backlight. The light-guide layer and diffusion layer were packaged together on a chip surface to create WA mini-LEDs with a viewing angle of 180\u25e6. These chips were then combined with a quantum dot (QD) film and an optical film to create a high-efficiency, ultrathin, flexible planar light source with excellent color purity that can be used as a QLED display backlight. A 6 in (14.4 cm) light source was used as an experimental sample. When 1.44 W was supplied to the sample, the 3200-piece WA mini-LED with a flexible planar QLED display had a beam angle of 180\u25e6 on the luminous intensity curve, a planar backlight thickness of 0.98 mm, a luminance of 10,322 nits, and a luminance uniformity of 92%.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, scientists have made substantial efforts to develop highly efficient, energy-saving, white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with high color saturation and long lifetimes, for flexible lighting and display technologies [1\u20133]. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are competitive candidates for next-generation illumination technologies and could replace current liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic LED (OLED) displays due to their superior photoluminescence, narrow-spectrum emission, high quantum efficiency, flexibility, and color-tuning capabilities. These advanced qualities in QDs could allow for smaller pixel sizes in micro-LED displays [4\u20138]. White-light-emitting materials are widely used in lighting and planar illuminator applications [9\u201311], and typically utilize inorganic phosphors containing rare earth elements (REEs) as their color conversion material. The current solution is not sustainable, as mining and utilization of REEs cause environmental and economic problems [12,13]. The development of REE-free color conversion materials with high efficiency, stability, and flexibility is a common research topic. In recent years, thin, flexible, and self-emissive OLED materials have been used for flexible lighting and displays, but their reliability is problematic and they have issues related to low driving currents [14,15]. Current research has improved QD technologies by improving their efficiency, reliability, and tunability with respect to emission colors [16\u201319]. Portable consumer electronics require lighting elements\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1326. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13081326 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1326 2 of 11\nto be lightweight, thin, and flexible, so researchers have proposed designs using blue or ultraviolet chips with colloidal QD films as flexible planar light-source modules [6,7,20\u201324]. Research on high-color-gamut displays indicates that hybrid-type LEDs based on perovskite QDs (PQDs) may be a viable solution for wide-color-gamut display backlights. Mixed PQDs containing high-stability mesoporous silica nanocomposites with a wide color gamut, as well as white LEDs with QD color converters, have been used as backlights for display applications [25\u201327]. In mini-LED displays, drive-current algorithms have been applied to maximize the color gamut and high dynamic range [28\u201330]. Micro-LED displays have been found to have innate performance advantages over LCD displays, including higher contrast ratios, lower latency, advanced color saturation, intrinsic self-illumination, and higher efficiency. Despite their advantages, there are several factors preventing them from being mass produced, including inspection requirements, poor mass transfer yield, chip leakage currents, angular color shifts, and highly difficult repairs [31\u201336]. Conversely, QLED displays can provide the same perfect black as OLEDs, have high color saturation without burn-in, and have higher brightness than LCD displays [7,37\u201339]. QLED displays developed in relevant research have used conventional side-lit backlights, but have drawbacks such as low brightness, thick modules, inflexibility, and a lack of local dimming capabilities that prevent their use in practical applications [40\u201343]. Zhi Ting Ye et al. have previously developed a large-angle, blue-chip, scale package LED design but have not explored solutions that combine quantum dot films for mobile phone backlight modules [44]. Using different chip sizes will lead to different optimized package structure sizes. Therefore, the light distribution will also be different. Herein, we propose a method of packaging WA mini-LEDs with a quantum dot (QD) film to create an ultrathin, flexible, planar light source that can be used as a backlight for portable QLED displays, while greatly reducing the number of LEDs required for the same area compared to the previous packaging requirements."

The second step involved depositing a light-guide layer on top of the diffusion layer, with the silicone resin functioning as the source material [44]. The light-guide layer was used to control the light extraction efficiency and light distribution shape. The third step was to arrange the microscale chips and perform die bonding. Great care must be taken to preserve the appropriate spacing between the microscale chips. The fourth step was to apply the TiO2/silicone resin composite glue to mold a side wall around the microscale chips and then cut the WA mini-LEDs. The added side wall was used to prevent transverse blue-light emission. The final step involved separating the WA mini-LEDs from the glass substrate through ultraviolet (UV) exposure. The resulting WA mini-LED square package dimensions were 800 \u00d7 800 \u00d7 580 \u03bcm3.

Fabrication of QD Film The TiO2 particles and PET films were provided by Harvatek Corporation. A QD film\n(6 in (14.4 cm)) was prepared by dispersing commercial green QDs (\u03bbg \u2248 530 nm) and red QDs (\u03bbr \u2248 626 nm) in a UV-cured poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. The UVcured poly (methyl methacrylate) transparent adhesive used was Vitralit\u00ae 1655.\nThe CdSe-based QDs were from Unique Materials Co., Ltd. and had weight ratios of about 20:1 (polymer: QD). The hybrid QD\u2013PMMA monomer layers were coated on two poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films as covering layers, using an automatic blade coater to produce sandwich-like structures. The PET/QD\u2013PMMA/PET film was then laminated and cured through irradiation with 365 nm UV light for 30 s. Finally, a doctor-blade coater was used to coat the optical diffusion layer (ODL) onto the PET/QD\u2013PMMA/PET film to form an ODL/PET/QD\u2013PMMA/PET/ODL film [45], as shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 2.

A QD film (6 in (14.4 cm)) was prepared by dispersing commercial green QDs (\u03bbg \u2248 530 nm) and red QDs (\u03bbr \u2248 626 nm) in a UV-cured poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. The UV-cured poly (methyl methacrylate) transparent adhesive used was Vitralit\u00ae 1655. The CdSe-based QDs were from Unique Materials Co., Ltd. and had weight ratios of about 20:1 (polymer: QD). The hybrid QD\u2013PMMA monomer layers were coated on two poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films as covering layers, using an automatic blade coater to produce sandwich-like structures. The PET/QD\u2013PMMA/PET film was then laminated and cured through irradiation with 365 nm UV light for 30 s. Finally, a doctor-blade coater was used to coat the optical diffusion layer (ODL) onto the PET/QD\u2013PMMA/PET film to form an ODL/PET/QD\u2013PMMA/PET/ODL film [45], as shown in Figure 3.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1326 4 of 11Micromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 11\nFigure 3.
