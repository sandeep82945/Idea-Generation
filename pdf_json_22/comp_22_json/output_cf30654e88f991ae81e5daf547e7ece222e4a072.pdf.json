    "abstractText": "As digital inclusion becomes a growing indicator of wellbeing in later life, the ability to understand older adults\u2019 preferences for information and communication technologies (ICTs) and develop strategies to support their digital literacy is critical. The barriers older adults face include their perceived ICT risks and capacity to learn. Complexities, including ICT environmental stressors and societal norms, may require concerted engagement with older adults to achieve higher digital literacy competencies. This article describes the results of a series of co-design workshops to develop strategies for increased ICT competencies and reduced perceived risks among older adults. Engaging older Australians in three in-person workshops (each workshop consisting of 15 people), this study adapted the \u201cScenario Personarrative Method\u201d to illustrate the experiences of people with technology and rich pictures of the strategies seniors employ. Through the enrichment of low-to-high-digitalliteracy personas and mapping workshop participant responses to several scenarios, the workshops contextualized the different opportunities and barriers seniors may face, offering a useful approach toward collaborative strategy development. We argued that in using co-designed persona methods, scholars can develop more nuance in generating ICT risk strategies that are built with and for older adults. By allowing risks to be contextualized through this approach, we illustrated the novelty of adapting the Scenario Personarrative Method to provide insights into perceived barriers and to build skills, motivations, and strategies toward enhancing digital literacy.",

            "text": "The growth in the use and adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by older adults\u2014accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014provided unique opportunities and challenges. Most explicit during the pandemic was how technologies became essential to reducing social isolation and related issues [1]. This trend, alongside a broader dependence on devices, reflects older adults\u2019 use of ICT to stay and age in place (i.e., at home) longer, support decision-making, and access and share information [2]. The movement to \u201cdigital by default\u201d inadvertently left many older adults behind [3]. An outcome of these circumstances is that an individual\u2019s capacity to learn, use, and adapt to technology (i.e., their digital literacy) is inextricably linked to their wellbeing and quality of life [4]. A lack of exposure and experience with ICT can lead to hesitancy around technology use. Research demonstrates how personal circumstances, such as marital status and residential status, can influence device support and digital inclusion for older adults [5].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 52. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20010052 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 52 2 of 15\nThe likelihood of ICT take-up and use can also be informed by attitudes, education level, and past occupation, with perceptions of technology cost and cognitive ability limiting interest [6]. The literature highlights that those in later life do not have homogeneous device adoption and technology use; as a cohort, older adults are one of the most divergent segments on digital literacy spectrums [7,8]. Training remains a key feature of successful ICT adoption. Learning is most successful when it is linked to real-world needs, cooperative and informal, and supported by memory aids, which are essential to developing strategies and richer experiences [9]. The aim of this collaborative endeavor with older adults was to understand how those in later life manage their issues and the complexity of ICT use in their day-to-day lives. In this study, we explored the ways perceptions of ICT risks shape older adults\u2019 use and how co-created strategies could support individuals and organizations to overcome barriers. The tailoring of strategies to support ICT adoption and refining information delivery provides an opportunity to improve digital literacy beyond existing educational models. This study focused on the following question: How can we support older adults\u2019 digital literacy by understanding their perceptions of risk and developing strategies with them? Centering on approaches to this issue, this study examined how participatory methods, which is a maturing approach to aging research, can support and enable access to a digitally engaged society. The study engaged the Scenario Personarrative method [10] as a novel approach to collaborating with older adults and developing nuanced and contextualized ICT engagement strategies. Section 2 presents further literature on the role of perceived ICT risks in limiting the digital literacy of older adults and the role of human-centeredness in technology design. Section 3 provides an overview of the workshop methodology, detailing the development of persona and scenario methods and the adaption of the scenario personarrative method to the context of technology and later life. Section 4 frames the perceived risks and potential strategies around the three degrees of digital literacy that the persona enrichment explored. Section 5 explores the implications of these findings and the benefit of this methodology in addressing the research question. Finally, Section 6 includes a summary of the findings and implications for future studies."

            "text": "Examining the role of perceived risks and co-designed strategies requires an understanding of how digital literacy shapes the experiences of older adults. Due to the scale of the concept, digital literacy does not have a universally agreed-upon definition. However, it does encompass a range of technical, cognitive, and socio-emotional aspects of becoming competent with a computer [5]. Within our context, improving digital literacy for older adults can vary widely from getting set up with a device to becoming a \u201cpower user\u201d. The variety of digital literacy skills and changes in those skills reflect an individual\u2019s experiences of everyday ICT use [11]. While digital literacy upskilling programs may seek to teach technologies prescriptively, scholars have emphasized that these digital workshops should employ more flexible culturally and socially sensitive practices toward building trust and confidence rather than a pre-destined outcome [4,12]. With these practices in mind, rather than focusing on digital literacy through learning and education [13], we noticed that perceptions of ICT risk became a central concern, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the regular technology classroom setting and instruction for older adults rapidly moved online. Perceived risks reflect older adults\u2019 genuine concerns about the potential harm or the possibility of loss that technology can often pose. These risks may be security- or privacy-related, crossing many aspects of daily life\u2014from financial concerns, performance issues, physical injury, social harm, time-related losses, and psychological risks [14]. While the pandemic has undoubtedly highlighted the perceived usefulness of ICT for social connection [15], human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) researchers noted and demonstrated the barriers to adoption and use. These barriers include perceived surveillance and paternalism from children; explicit barriers, such as physical abilities or financial capability;\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 52 3 of 15\nand structural misperceptions or stigmatization of older adults remain [16]. Scholars from gerontology, psychology, and human behavior studies point to the role of training in developing confidence, indicating the importance of family members and caregivers empowering the use of and exposure to ICT [15,17,18]. While these recommendations are useful for those supporting older adults, they lack an understanding of older adults\u2019 experiences with the ICT strategies they employ. The participation of older adults and inclusion in technology development is wellestablished; however, efforts to engage how they appropriate and adapt ICT devices are less so. Studies that did involve older adults in evaluating emerging technologies for older adults, such as virtual reality (VR), focused on how participatory methods can help to build a stronger collaborative partnership, highlighting the benefit of engaging individuals with vastly different levels of technical knowledge [19]. While product-orientated research does offer important insights into design and development, such as how wearable technology can be perceived to diminish an older user\u2019s independence instead of improving it [20], increasingly, the actions of the users in domesticating products and services are being highlighted [21]. As socio-gerontechnologist Alexander Peine [21] suggested, the agency of older people in relation to technology is better explored through supporting these individuals to become co-creators and informed users, as well as reframing perceptions of them as \u201cpassive recipients of technology.\u201d If digital literacy centers upon making individuals more competent, supporting more active roles and strategizing with older adults can greatly improve their outcomes with ICT use. If existing interventionist approaches to technology in later life are limiting in realizing digital practices, modes of research that support self-management and self-care can address issues of technology-driven neglect and burdens for older adults. This study offered an analysis of a series of collaborative workshops conducted with older adults to support their forming and sharing of strategies and knowledge around reducing their perceived risks of ICT. The workshops centered on their perceptions of ICT aspirations, barriers, and strategies for older adults with various digital literacies. Conducted with older Australians (65 years and older), the workshops engaged the senior residents of several local government areas who collaborated on two activities: persona enrichment and scenario mapping. Adapting the scenario personarrative method [22], these activities centered around a spectrum of low-to-high-digital-literacy personas, which participants enriched before mapping their persona responses to several scenarios, indicating how they would cope with ICT failure or seek support. Below, we detail our adaptation of this existing method to suit an aging population in a technological context and describe the accessibility and flexibility the method offers in the context of the pandemic. These aspects were central to how these workshops provided a platform for encouraging new discourses around digital literacy through the more human-centered lens of ICT risk and strategies."

            "text": "The series of workshops, which took place from January to April 2022, was based on a collaborative \u201cScenario Personarrative method\u201d [10], which effectively engages with the multi-dimensional factors of digital literacy. This method combines two tasks\u2014scenario thinking and persona narratives\u2014in a common participative approach that Flore Vallet and colleagues [10] saw as a structured yet flexible process. As they highlighted, scenarios deal with broader trends, using projections to build several narratives that detail alternative possible futures to navigate through. Whilst personas may draw on demographic data or not, they often form highly detailed yet representative profiles that express the social and political aspects that technology designers might not consider. This combination of two often discrete activities offers many benefits, such as enabling \u201cmultiple views of an interaction\u201d [23], with this approach enabling \u201cparticipants to use their own experiences and perceptions to help guide the development of complex interventions\u201d [24]. This fosters a very different type of information than focus groups or usability\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 52 4 of 15\nwalkthroughs can, as persona and scenario activities engage with the lived experiences of people, such as those with certain disabilities and health conditions [22]. When used for primary care interventions [24], speculating on autonomous technologies [25], or disaster responses [26], this combination of persona\u2013scenario exercises has seen participants develop fictitious yet authentic personas placed into several scenarios that participants must work together to understand how they might navigate it [27]. These qualities illustrate how this approach can be valuable in the context of eliciting ICT strategies from older adults by navigating perceived risks with them. More broadly, workshops form a common method in collaborative design research, supporting the evaluation of propositions and co-creation of innovations that we have employed to capture older adults\u2019 thoughts and responses. As a participatory approach where individuals can learn and creatively problem-solve together, workshopping focuses on how participants can express themselves through different channels by facilitating and capturing discussion and constructive processes [28]. In essence, workshops provide a clear purpose and set of goals to participants, involve pre-allocated roles, and often incorporate various research methods ranging from group discussion to creative tasks to interviews and observations [29]. As detailed in Figure 1, the workshops this study focused on were centered around understanding older adults\u2019 perceived ICT risks and strategies in relation to their digital literacy. For the workshops, personas were developed that represented several older adults that were defined by digital literacies ranging from low to high. In addition, the scenarios crafted were situations of potential or actual risk, where ICT strategies that were appropriate to the persona in question needed to be applied. These sessions engaged older adults as collaborators whose activities and discussions were facilitated by a member of the research team. Using printed templates and sticky notes to capture and respond, groups worked through the persona enrichment and scenario mapping exercises. Each activity was supplemented by a wider workshop session involving discussion and reflection on group responses. We note how sticky notes can be used to record, visualize, and communicate emerging insights as an effective method of data collection [30]. The resulting analysis of these materials, enriched personas, and mapped scenarios formed the key results in this article, as arranged by the fictional senior\u2019s digital literacy. Int. J.

A persona would be allotted to a group and introduced by the facilitator, with questions around certain concepts and terminology explained and discussed in the group (for example, digital literacy would be introduced as the competency of someone with a given technology; however, the group might decide that speaks more to their skill in navigating an interface than being knowledgeable with the programming of a device). After the group reviewed and discussed this individual, their facilitator would then direct participants to \u201cenrich\u201d this basic profile, offering several prompts for them to respond to. These prompts would be listed on a large, printed template (Figure 3), with sticky notes, markers, and other stationery provided to capture thoughts and comments.

Discussion This study focused on how we might support digital literacy in later life by understanding ICT risks and developing strategies. The workshops offered key insights into the potential for adapting scenario personarrative methods to collaborate with older Australians. In drawing on collaborative, co-creative techniques to facilitate this series of workshops, we noted how this approach saw participants actively engage in capturing the aspirations, barriers, sources of support, and ICT use they perceived at varying levels of technical skill and digital literacy. By enriching several fictional personas and mapping how they might respond to risk-based scenarios, individuals applied their own perceptions of ICT risk. They shared their own experiences and strategies with a wider group, enabling discussions that led to three key levels of digital literacy and associated qualities formed through our content analysis. In describing the contextualized data and nuanced results, we established how adapting this persona\u2013scenario methodology with older stakeholders can support collaborative approaches to understanding the perceptions and strategies that inform digital literacy. We also considered the benefits of this collective experience in helping catalyze practices that addressed the needs and challenges of those participating. Ultimately, we suggested that employing methods that extend the scenario personarrative method can\nengage a more human-centered agenda. This is particularly true regarding the ICT strat-\negies we supported and the perceived risks we addressed in the design and deployment of technologies (Figure 9).\nAspirations\nConnecting with family, viewing on Social media, wanting to use online banking, somewhat forced), supporting emergencies (wellbeing, dogs, call 000), make technology more easy/intuitive.\nBarriers\nNot being well enough to get to phone, a lack of interest (needs practicality), pressure to use, no trust using financial apps, memory issues (won\u2019 t remember), getting distracted when using device\nWhere/Who Support\nNurses and gardener/cleaners, welfare companies (help/reach out), calling family, help from council/social workers\nWhen/Where use\nWhen issues arise (seeking support), safety issues (fall, etc.), calling phone company for information\nHealth Priorities\nKeeping mind active, keeping social + active, online groups\nTech Devices\nMobile and Home Phone to receive messages, packaged with internet provider, access to iPad (better screen, cheaper than computer) perhaps second-hand.\nFigure 8.

Older adults participating in scenario personarrative activities.\nThe qualitative content analysis revealed six predetermined topics categorized by persona digital literacy, establishing key differences and commonalities between older adults of differing competencies online and with ICT. Focusing upon the aspirations of these enriched, fictional individuals, we noted how older adults perceived higher literacy as a platform for becoming a power user, which was centered around ICT experiences and integration rather than the functional and social objectives of medium- and low-level personas. Regarding commonalities, we found multiple barriers associated with all levels of digital literacy. Reflecting the literature, perceptions of aging-related and educational limitations were prominent, while location-based ones, such as the city\u2013country divide, and economic and budgetary restraints were perceived to reduce technology accessibility [16,34,35]. Previous studies generally associated these opportunities and limitations with a combination of individual and environmental qualities, with older adults often highlighting aging-related physical and mental barriers (memory loss, fear, low self-esteem) [34] over less obvious structural (the pandemic, teaching, media skepticism) and implicit barriers (surveillance, paternalism, appliance design) [16]. In responding to the ICT risk scenarios, the sources of support, mindsets, and strategies individuals brought were central to how they addressed the functional, social, or financial problem. Low-to-medium literacies were often perceived as most likely to go to a family member or existing supporter to manage a problem; however, participants suggested that lower-literacy individuals might see a burden in this and limit support over time. In seeing the same burden, medium-literacy individuals could be seen to make these support sessions more educational, drawing on existing methods of recording, listing, and attempting to resolve recurrent issues themselves. Meanwhile, high-literacy personas were most associated with a flexible and problem-solving attitude to these issues, leaving support systems as a backup option rather than the first point of call. Scholars like Alonso Gonzalez and colleagues [7] documented how building on previous skills and seeking informal learning are more engaging for older adults, as evident in the strategies these seniors perceived as being more beneficial to them. This is clear in how those from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds sought community-based ICT support in their own languages rather than just translated materials. The perceptions of risk and chosen strategies older adults highlighted during the workshops reflected a need for more nuanced and contextualized approaches to supporting their digital literacies. Through workshop discussions and focusing on personas as a way to ground practices with perceptions, we considered the challenges and possibilities for researchers in navigating digital literacy beyond just a pedological paradigm. As indicated, scholars already highlighted how both individual and systematic factors played a role in the capacity of older adults to use and improve their ICT skills and online literacies. In addition to enabling durable skillsets and constructive attitudes, we indicated that interventions and programs acknowledged the diversity and richness of older adults\u2019 digital media engagement spectrum from non-users to tech-savvy users.\nFigure 9.

In adapting this methodology, we considered how human-centered approaches can effectively engage older adults, the complexity of the issues they face in addressing perceived risks, and the often tacit ways they address them. This combination of persona enrichment and scenario mapping is not only flexible to this context but also reduces the onus on older adults to identify their own literacy and explore that in a group setting, instead applying their perceptions to a fictional individual and problem-solving through them. Because these workshops involved multiple seniors sharing their ideas and strategies through this individual, we saw the potential for these collaborative and informal settings to act as educational and informative opportunities to learn from others (Figure 10). By negotiating contemporary technical risks and social norms with their peers, the workshops involved participants in peer-to-peer discovery and learning that involved finding out about new mobile applications, such as password managers, and better approaches to their issues and local sources of support. While this exercise, in realizing the risks and strategies older adults engage with, can support future programs and interventions, the collaboration also supported participants in discovering new ones, which is a form of mutual learning scholars increasingly document with older adults [36].\nInt.

Council staff and older adults contributing to the conversation and agenda\nThese findings suggested we need to offer more nuanced models that acknowledge the diversity and richness of older adults\u2019 digital media engagement spectrum from nonusers to tech-savvy users. They also added to the notion that those in later life do not require unique interventions compared with the broader population. Instead, programs, products, and systems that provide more understanding of the contexts, passions, and experiences individuals seek are required. As data further saturates our everyday lives, we will increasingly need creative, co-designed, and speculative ways to think through the possibilities and limits of the digital across various literacies, subjectivities, and spectrums. We need a more robust discussion about the role of methods in workshops to bring often tacit practices and perceptions to the forefront and how those possibilities shape how we move forward together. This is especially true in a data-saturated world in which digital literacy has become synonymous with social inclusion. Approaches such as the scenario personarrative method allow for topics such as perceived risks and ICT use to be discussed in ways that allow for nuance and context. Based on this study, a scenario personarrative approach can help to provide insights into perceived barriers and to encourage older adults to build skills, motivations, and strategies to enhance digital literacy. The persona enrichment and scenario mapping process described here forms an example of a broader shift in focus from technological to human aspects in the design for later life. As social scientists Linda Nierling and Emma Dom\u00ednguez-Ru\u00e9 [37] highlighted, this is a move toward questioning how technology is integrated into the social surroundings that shift the focus from technical features to social phenomenon. Persona and scenario exercises, as opposed to usability testing, address this by reshaping the relationship between individuals and technologies, building out the technologies based on a persona and engaging with the barriers and strategies of individuals. In working through several levels of digital literacy, this method also focuses more on human complexity, from\nFigure 10.

They also added to the notion that those in later life do not require unique interventions compared with the broader population. Instead, programs, products, and systems that provide more understanding of the contexts, passions, and experiences individuals seek are required.

Persona and scenario exercises, as opposed to usability testing, address this by reshaping the relationship between individuals and technologies, building out the technologies based on a persona and engaging with the barriers and strategies of individuals. In working through several levels of digital literacy, this method also focuses more on human complexity, from personal attitudes to embedded contexts, which is often not engaged within the ICT strategies offered to those around older adults. Such qualities benefit not only older adults as ICT consumers but also the designers of technologies and educators. Our analysis demonstrated that digital literacy can effectively determine the potential risks associated with an individual and the strategies they use, as long as these aspects are contextualized and examined with the individuals. For both technologists and instructors, this might mean tailoring resources for particular literacies; responding to the aspirations and barriers individuals have; and forming programs, products, or services that better align with the mindset and attitude that level of digital literacy brings. We also hope that in adapting this methodology, and by workshopping these issues with older adults, future studies might refocus on digital literacy beyond the classroom and explore with older adults the dynamics that shape, limit, and enable their ICT use and skills."

The series of workshops employed the \u201cScenario Personarrative Method\u201d to focus on personal experiences and collaborative discourse to enable more nuanced and contextual perspectives on digital literacy in later life. These workshops captured the similarities and differences in how older adults at different levels of digital literacy conceived of their barriers and employed certain strategies in relation to ICT use. This study indicated the promising application of the scenario personarrative method in participatory activities with older adults, indicating the benefits of persona enrichment and scenario mapping for understanding the ICT practices and perspectives of those in later life.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed to the coordination and conducting of the study.
