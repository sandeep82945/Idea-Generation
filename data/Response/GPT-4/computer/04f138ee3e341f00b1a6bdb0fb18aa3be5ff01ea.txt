Exploration of Advanced Encoding Techniques for Real-Time 360-Degree Video Applications: Investigate novel encoding algorithms that further reduce the latency and increase the efficiency of real-time 360-degree video streaming, especially for live events and interactive virtual reality (VR) experiences. This could involve the development of more sophisticated SVC layers or the integration of machine learning models to predict and pre-encode potential viewport changes.

Adaptive Streaming Based on Network Conditions and Device Capabilities: Develop adaptive streaming protocols that dynamically adjust the quality of 360-degree videos based on current network conditions and the capabilities of the receiving device. This includes researching methods to seamlessly switch between different resolutions and compression rates without negatively impacting the user experience.

Improved Methods for Non-Adjacent Region Packing: The paper highlights challenges with packing non-adjacent regions in 360-degree videos. Future research could focus on creating more efficient algorithms for this task, potentially leveraging advances in computational geometry or machine learning to optimize the packing and streaming of these regions, thereby reducing the complexity and computational requirements on both the server and client sides.

Enhanced Quality Metrics for 360-Degree Video: As 360-degree and VR content become more prevalent, traditional quality metrics like PSNR may not fully capture the user experience. Future research could involve developing new metrics or enhancing existing ones to better account for the unique aspects of 360-degree video, such as the importance of video quality in the user's viewport versus peripheral areas.

Cross-Layer Optimization for 360-Degree Video Streaming: Investigate cross-layer optimization techniques that consider both the network layer and the application layer to improve the streaming of 360-degree videos. This could include research on optimizing packet scheduling, error resilience, and adapting streaming rates in real-time to ensure the best possible quality of experience (QoE) for users, especially in mobile and highly variable network environments.
