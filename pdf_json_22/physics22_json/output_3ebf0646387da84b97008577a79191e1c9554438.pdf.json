    "abstractText": "The ultrasonic Lamb wave detection principle can realize the noncontact measurement of liquid level in closed containers. When designing an ultrasonic Lamb wave sensor, it is vital to thoroughly study and select the optimal wedge size at the front of the sensor. In this paper, firstly, we select the best working mode of Lamb waves according to their propagation dispersion curve in aluminum alloy, and we obtain the best angle of wedge through experiments. Secondly, we study the impact of the size of the wedge block on the results, and we obtain the selection method of wedge block parameters. The evaluations show that, when the frequency\u2013thickness product is 3 MHz\u00b7mm, the Lamb waves work in the A1 mode, and the experimental effect is the best. At this time, the incident angle of the ultrasonic wave is 27.39\u25e6. The wedge thickness should be designed to avoid the near-field area of the ultrasonic field, and we should choose the length as odd multiples of 1/4 wavelength. The rules obtained from the experiment can effectively select the best working mode for ultrasonic Lamb waves, while also providing a basis for the design of the wedge block size in a Lamb wave sensor.",

            "text": "In the fields of food safety, industry, and aviation, it is very necessary to monitor liquids in closed containers under harsh environments [1]. Therefore, the research and development of nondestructive testing (NDT) sensors is important. At present, liquid-level sensors mainly include capacitive, resistive, float, radar, laser, acoustic, and fiber-optic sensors [2\u20135]. Capacitive, resistive, float, and fiber-optic sensors are all contact sensors, which are not suitable for large, closed containers and cannot achieve NDT. Although radar-type and laser-type sensors are not directly in contact with the measured liquid, they need to be installed inside the container, which destroys the integrity of the container and is expensive. The acoustic-based detection method can realize true noncontact measurement outside the tank [6] and is, therefore, best suited for this application. Commonly used acoustic wave-based liquid-level detection techniques include the interface reflection method [7], penetrative method [8], and attenuation method [9]. Since the attenuation of the ultrasonic guided wave along the propagation path is very small, it can even travel a very long distance along with the detected object [10]. At the same time, ultrasonic waves can result in particle vibration on the upper and lower surfaces of the plate, as well as in the middle part, and the sound field can cover the whole detected structure [11]. Therefore, ultrasonic guided wave detection technology can overcome many shortcomings of traditional methods [12]. It is more suitable for the detection of liquid level in large containers such as space launch vehicle fuel tanks.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5046. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22135046 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 5046 2 of 13\nLamb waves are a type of guided waves. During the propagation process, they carry information such as the group velocity, phase velocity, and amplitude attenuation related to material properties, waveguide thickness, and propagation frequency. They have been widely used in various sensors and liquid-level detection [13]. Spratt et al. [14] proposed a new intrusive torsional waveguide sensor for temperature and liquid-level measurement. The variation of the flight time of the torsional wave in the waveguide can be related to the temperature and liquid level. Balasubramaniam et al. [15] described noninvasive ultrasonic guided wave systems for fluid-level sensing, and presented the finite element modeling, design, and construction of waveguide sensors for fluid-level sensing. Lingyu et al. [16] presented a case study of guided waves in a steel plate with one side immersed in water. They proposed that the water level affects the wave propagation time linearly and can be potentially used for estimation of water level in a container. Although Lamb waves have the above advantages, their application is limited due to the complex dispersion relationship and multimode characteristics. The detection effect and detection accuracy of ultrasonic Lamb waves are determined by whether the corresponding dispersion curve can be quickly and accurately obtained [17]. Zamanov et al. [18] used the three-dimensional linearized theory of propagation of elastic waves in bodies with initial stresses and investigated the propagation of Lamb waves in this plate. Kim et al. [19] developed a hybrid one-dimensional finite element (1D FE) analytical method to analyze the Lamb wave propagation characteristics of composite panels. It allows using a small number of finite elements even for high-frequency analysis in a computationally efficient manner. Wilcox and Lowe et al. [20] conducted a study on excitation modes and sensors for long-range Lamb wave detection, pointed out that six factors should be considered in the selection of Lamb wave modes and frequencies, which are dispersion, attenuation, sensitivity, excitability, detectability, and selectivity. Although many researchers have conducted a large number of studies on the propagation characteristics of Lamb waves and liquid-level detection applications using Lamb waves, it is difficult to find specific research results on internal wedge parameters in making Lamb wave sensors. The wedge is an essential component in the Lamb wave sensor, as it can act as a buffer block to avoid the near-field area [21]. Liu et al. [22] compared the materials of the buffer block in detail and drew the curve of the sound velocity with frequency and temperature in PMMA. They combined other physical properties of PMMA, and finally proposed that PMMA is the most suitable material in the measurement experiment of liquid acoustic properties. Nikolaevtsev et al. [23] investigated Lamb wave excitation by a wedge-shaped ultrasonic phase array transducer using the finite element (FEM) method. They investigated the influence of three different liquid layers and the dependence on the aperture of the transducer. In conclusion, on the basis of the principle that ultrasonic Lamb waves can propagate in thin walls, this paper builds an external fixed-point noncontact liquid-level monitoring system. In this method, we use a wedge with a certain inclination angle, so that Lamb waves can be generated after ultrasonic waves are incident. The Lamb waves propagate in the container wall, and the residual waves are received by the receiving device. Firstly, we draw the dispersion curve of Lamb waves according to the properties of the experimental device material, select the optimal working mode of Lamb waves required for the experiment, and then verify its feasibility by experiments with wedges with different inclination angles. Secondly, we study the impact of wedge thickness on the experiment and select the best wedge size available for the experiment. On this basis, we study the impact of the wedge size on the results when there is a multiple relationship between the size of the wedge and the wavelength of ultrasonic wave. The general rules summarized in this paper provide a powerful basis for the selection of the best working mode of Lamb waves and the design of wedge size in NDT based on ultrasonic Lamb waves.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5046 3 of 13"

Second, the wedge block can be a delay block, which can make the ultrasonic work in its far-field area. Therefore, the angle and thickness of the wedge are important factors in the experiment. For the selection of wedge material, the acoustic impedance of the polymer is close to that of water, which makes the sensor more sensitive [31].

            "text": "On the basis of the above theory, this paper builds an external fixed-point liquid level NDT system based on ultrasonic Lamb waves. The material of the tested container is aluminum alloy, which is the same as the commonly used liquid storage tank material for space rockets. The internal measured medium is air and water. We use a continuous sine wave with amplitude of \u00b115 V to excite the transducer to produce ultrasonic waves. The wedge of a certain angle is used to generate the Lamb wave working mode required for the experiment. We use an ultrasonic couplant to closely fit the wedge to the wall of the container and the ultrasonic transducer, so as to discharge air, allowing the ultrasonic wave to be maximally transmitted into the container. Two ultrasonic transducers are installed symmetrically on the outside of the container, one is the transmitter and the other is the receiver. The p-waves are emitted to the container at a certain angle, and, after penetrating the container, a Lamb wave propagating along the container wall is generated. Some of the waves produce secondary transmission at the interface between the inner wall of the container and the inner medium. According to the ultrasonic impedance method, the ability to reflect and transmit ultrasonic waves from different media is related to the difference in the acoustic impedance of materials. The sound intensity reflectance R and sound intensity transmittance T satisfy the following equations [33]:\nR = (Z2 \u2212 Zi)2\n(Z2 + Zi) 2 , (12)\nT = 4Z2Zi\n(Z2 + Zi) 2 , (13)\nwhere Z2 is the acoustic impedance of the tested container (Mrayl), and Zi is the acoustic impedance of the inner medium (Mrayl). In this paper, the material of the tested container is aluminum alloy, Z2 = 32 Mrayl, and the inner medium is water and air; the acoustic impedance of water is ZW = 1.48 Mrayl, and the acoustic impedance of air is ZA = 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 Mrayl. By substituting the above parameters into Equations (12) and (13), it can be obtained that the transmittance of water and air is RW = 83.10% and RA = 99.99%, respectively [32]. Therefore, water has less reflectivity and greater transmissivity than air. When there is liquid between the two transducers, the liquid absorbs part of the ultrasonic waves and forms a leaky Lamb wave. The remaining ultrasonic energy delivered to the receiver is reduced. There is a certain relationship between residual energy and liquid level. According to this relationship, we can get the liquid level corresponding to the received energy [17].

Firstly, to overcome the problem of multimode, it is best to choose a point farther away from other modes. Secondly, it is optimal to choose a situation where the group velocity curve is flat, whereby the group velocity changes less, and the echo distance is relatively stable [34]. As can be seen from Figure 3, dispersion curves of different materials were drawn according to ultrasonic frequency and material wall thickness.

It can be seen from Figure 3a that 3 MHz\u00b7mm was available for four modes, namely, S0, S1, A0, and A1. However, the phase velocities of the S0 mode and A0 mode were too close to be suitable for selection. From Figure 3b, we chose a mode with a relatively flat group velocity curve, i.e., A1, for the Lamb waves selected in this experiment.

Then, the working mode was selected according to the frequency\u2013thickness product and the principle mentioned above. From Figure 3a, when \u0192d = 3 MHz\u00b7mm, the corresponding Lamb wave phase velocity cp in A1 mode was 6 mm/us. According to Table 1, cL1 = 2775 m/s; substituting it into Equation (7), we could obtain the incident angle of the ultrasonic wave according to the Snell theorem, i.e., \u03b1 = 27.39\u25e6. When p-waves are obliquely incident on the interface between two media, a first critical angle and a second critical angle are generated. The first critical angle is the incident angle when the refracted p-wave is 90\u25e6, and the second critical angle is the incident angle when the refracted s-wave is 90\u25e6.

Selection of Wedge Thickness According to Table 1, when T = 20 \u00b0C, the ultrasonic sound velocity in the PMMA wedge cL1 = 2775 m/s, f = 1 MHz, and sensor diameter DS = 10 mm; substituting them into Equation (8), we could obtain that the length of the near-field area of p-waves N = L1 at this time was 9 mm, and the wavelength was 2.775 mm. By substituting \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, cL1 = 2775 m/s, and cT2 = 3157.8 m/s into Equation (9), we could obtain the s-wave refraction angle \u03b2 = 34.7\u00b0. Substituting them in Equation (10), we could get N = 7.50 mm. From Equation (11), we could get N\u2019 = 0.03 mm, which we could ignore. At this time, there was almost no swave near-field area in the second medium. The refraction angle of the Lamb waves was 90\u00b0. From Equations (10) and (11), we could get N = 0, and N\u2019 = \u2212L2. That is, when we analyzed the near field of the Lamb sound field, only the near field of the incident p-waves could be considered. For the design of the wedge\u2019s long side, it was only necessary to ensure that the energy generated by PZT could be directly emitted to the bottom surface of the wedge (the contact surface between the wedge and the measured object), but not to the vertical surface of the wedge to cause the reflection of waves in the wedge. After calculation, when the wedge thickness (height) was 0, the long side was at least 11.54 mm. The long side increased with the increase in thickness. In the experiment, the maximum height was 12.21 mm, and the long side was at least 18 mm. Therefore, the selection of the long sides had little effect on the energy collection. We made some wedges from PMMA with the same width of 20 mm, the same dip angle of 30\u00b0, and different thicknesses.

The impact of ultrasonic wavelength on experimental results.\nAs can be seen from the above results, when the propagation distance of the transmitted wave through the buffer block to the container wall was an even multiple of a quarter-wavelength, the received ultrasonic energy was lower, and it existed at the trough of the sound wave.

Therefore, combining the evaluations of Sections 3.2 and 3.3, it can be concluded that, to ensure the most ideal experimental effect, when designing the wedge at the front end of the ultrasonic sensor, the vertical distance between the probe and the container wall should be just longer than the distance in the near field.

            "text": "According to the principle of ultrasonic Lamb wave nondestructive testing, this paper built a measurement system for liquid monitoring in a closed thin-wall container and studied the internal wedge parameters of the Lamb wave sensor. We first used MATLAB and corresponding programs to draw the phase velocity and group velocity dispersion curves of Lamb waves in aluminum alloy. According to the dispersion curves, we theoretically analyzed and selected the most suitable working mode as A1 when fd = 3 MHz\u00b7mm and calculated the corresponding ultrasonic incident angle as 27.39\u25e6. Then, we verified the correctness of the theory through experiments. Secondly, we studied the wedge thickness. The evaluations showed that, when the vertical distance L1 from the transmitter sensor to the container wall just avoided the near-field area (9.84 mm), the experimental effect was better, and the received energy decreased with the increase in thickness. When the sound wave propagation distance was an odd multiple of a quarter-wavelength, the received ultrasonic energy was larger. Therefore, when designing a Lamb wave sensor wedge, the inclination angle of the wedge must first be determined according to the material properties of the measured object. When determining the thickness of the wedge, the ultrasonic near-field area should be avoided appropriately. Lastly, it is necessary to ensure that the distance L1 is an odd multiple of the quarter-wavelength of the ultrasonic wave.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5046 12 of 13\nThe liquid-level detection method proposed in this paper can realize fixed-point noncontact liquid level measurement, which can be used in aerospace and industrial fields. This paper comprehensively studied the key parameters of the inner wedge of the ultrasonic Lamb waves sensor. The research results can be used to select the best working mode of ultrasonic Lamb waves, while also providing an effective basis for designing the optimal and minimum sizes of wedge blocks.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, W.L. and H.Z.; data curation, W.X., W.G. and R.G.; formal analysis, W.X., W.G. and W.L.; funding acquisition, H.Z.; investigation, W.G., W.L. and H.Z.; methodology, R.G.; project administration, W.L. and H.Z.; resources, W.L.; software, W.X.; supervision, W.G., W.L. and H.Z.; validation, H.Z.; visualization, R.G.; writing\u2014original draft, W.X.; writing\u2014review and editing, W.G.
