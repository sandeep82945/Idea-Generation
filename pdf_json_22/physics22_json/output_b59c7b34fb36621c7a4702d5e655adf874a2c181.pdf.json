    "abstractText": "Fe-doped III-V ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)Sb is a promising material for spintronic device applications because of the n-type carrier conduction and the ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature (TC > 300 K). To clarify the mechanism of the high-TC ferromagnetism, we have investigated the electronic structure and magnetic properties of an (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb thin film by performing x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Fe L2,3 edges. The magnetic-field (\u03bc0H) dependence of the XMCD spectra reveals that there are ferromagnetic-like Fe and paramagnetic-like Fe components in the (In,Fe)Sb thin film. 2 The XAS and XMCD spectra of the ferromagnetic-like and paramagnetic-like Fe components resemble those of other Fe-doped FMSs and extrinsic oxides, respectively. The finite value of the ratio between the orbital and spin magnetic moments estimated by applying the XMCD sum rules indicates that the valence state of the Fe ions substituting for the In sites in (In,Fe)Sb is not purely ionic Fe, but intermediate between Fe and Fe. The qualitative correspondence between the \uf06d0H dependence of the visible-light magnetic circular dichroism intensity and that of the XMCD intensity demonstrates that the Zeeman splitting of the InSb band is proportional to the net magnetization of the doped Fe. These results suggest that the ferromagnetism of (In,Fe)Sb originates from the Fe 3d orbitals hybridized with the host InSb bands.",

To clarify the mechanism of the high-TC ferromagnetism, we have investigated the electronic structure and magnetic properties of an (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb thin film by performing x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Fe L2,3 edges. The magnetic-field (\u03bc0H) dependence of the XMCD spectra reveals that there are ferromagnetic-like Fe and paramagnetic-like Fe components in the (In,Fe)Sb thin film.\nThe XAS and XMCD spectra of the ferromagnetic-like and paramagnetic-like Fe components resemble those of other Fe-doped FMSs and extrinsic oxides, respectively. The finite value of the ratio between the orbital and spin magnetic moments estimated by applying the XMCD sum rules indicates that the valence state of the Fe ions substituting for the In sites in (In,Fe)Sb is not purely ionic Fe3+, but intermediate between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The qualitative correspondence between the 0H dependence of the visible-light magnetic circular dichroism intensity and that of the XMCD intensity demonstrates that the Zeeman splitting of the InSb band is proportional to the net magnetization of the doped Fe. These results suggest that the ferromagnetism of (In,Fe)Sb originates from the Fe 3d orbitals hybridized with the host InSb bands.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFerromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) exhibit both the properties of semiconductors and ferromagnets simultaneously and thus are promising materials for spintronics devices [1-3], which exploits both the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons. In III-V FMSs, magnetic elements such as Mn and Fe partially replace the group III sites. The Fedoped III-V FMSs, (In,Fe)As [4-6], (In,Fe)Sb [7,8], (Ga,Fe)Sb [9-11] and (Al,Fe)Sb [12], have been successfully grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in the last decade. Since the doped Fe ions substitute for group III elements as Fe3+, it has been believed that the Fe ions in a III-V semiconductor matrix do not simply act as donors or acceptors. In fact,\nvarious carrier types of Fe-doped III-V FMSs have been realized by co-doping or defect control: (In,Fe)As:Be [4] and (In,Fe)Sb [7] are n-type, (Ga,Fe)Sb [9] is p-type, and (Al,Fe)Sb [12] is insulating. Moreover, (Ga,Fe)Sb and (In,Fe)Sb show ferromagnetism whose Curie temperature (TC) is higher than room temperature. The highest TC of (Ga1x,Fex)Sb is about 400 K at Fe concentration x = 0.20 [13], and that of (In1-x,Fex)Sb is about 385K at x = 0.35 [14]. Therefore, Fe-doped III-V FMSs are promising materials for the realization of spintronics devices with pn junctions [15] operating at room temperature.\nVarious studies of the physical properties of n-type (In,Fe)Sb have been carried out to clarify the origin of the ferromagnetism [7,8,16]. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated that (In1-x,Fex)Sb maintains the zinc-blende-type crystal structure up to at least x \u2266 0.16 [7]. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) in a visible-light range (1 \u2013 5 eV) and anomalous Hall effect measurements have confirmed intrinsic ferromagnetism in (In,Fe)Sb, in which ferromagnetic order appears in the zinc-blende semiconductor phase (there is no visible evidence for secondary phases) [7]. A first-principles calculation [16] for (In,Fe)Sb has predicted that the isoelectronic Fe dopants induce antiferromagnetic interaction between the Fe ions through the super-exchange mechanism and the transition from the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic states is induced by additional carrier doping. This behavior can be well\nunderstood in terms of the Alexander-Anderson-Moriya mechanism [17,18]. The electrical control of ferromagnetism in (In,Fe)Sb by applying a gate voltage indicated that both the electron-carrier-induced ferromagnetic interaction and the super-exchange mechanism contribute to the emergence of the ferromagnetism in (In,Fe)Sb [8].\nFor further understanding of the origin of magnetism in (In,Fe)Sb, it is necessary to characterize and reveal the electronic states of the doped Fe ions related to the ferromagnetism in detail. To address this issue, we investigate the relationship between the local electronic states of the Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb and the ferromagnetic behavior by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Synchrotron radiation based XMCD is an element-specific magnetic probe and a powerful tool to study the electronic state of the doped magnetic ions in FMSs [19-23]. The experimental findings based on the XMCD measurements suggest that the ferromagnetism in (In,Fe)Sb is intrinsic and originates from the Fe 3d orbitals hybridized with the ligand bands of the host InSb.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nAn (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb thin film with a thickness of 15 nm was grown on a p-type GaAs(001) substrate by MBE. In order to avoid surface oxidation, the sample was\ncovered with a thin amorphous As capping layer after the MBE growth of the (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb layer. The sample structure is, from top to bottom, As capping layer ~1 nm/(In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb 15 nm/AlSb 100 nm/AlAs 6 nm/GaAs:Be 100 nm grown on a p + GaAs (001) substrate. The TC of the sample was about 100 K estimated by the Arrott plot of visible-light MCD intensity - perpendicular magnetic field (\u03bc0H) characteristics.\nXAS and XMCD measurements were performed at beamline BL23-SU of SPring-8. The measurements were conducted under an ultrahigh vacuum below 1.0\u00d710-8 Pa at a temperature (T) of 10 K. Circularly polarized x-rays in the energy range of 690 \u2013 740 eV near the Fe L2,3 absorption edges were used for the measurements. The absorption spectra for circularly polarized x-rays were obtained by reversing photon helicity at each photon energy (\u210e\ud835\udf08 or \u210f\ud835\udf14) and were taken in the total electron yield mode. Here, XAS spectra taken with left and right circularly polarized x-rays are defined as \ud835\udf07+ and \ud835\udf07\u2212 , respectively, and then the XAS spectrum \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14) and the XMCD spectrum \u2206\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udf14) are represented as \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14) = (\ud835\udf07+ + \ud835\udf07\u2212) 2\u2044 and \u2206\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14) = (\ud835\udf07+ \u2212 \ud835\udf07\u2212) , where \u210f\ud835\udf14 is the photon energy. Magnetic fields were varied from -7 T to 7 T and applied parallel to the incident x-rays corresponding to the surface-normal direction. The sample was divided into two pieces and one of them was etched by HCl to obtain the clean surface. We etched the sample with HCl (2.4 mol/L) for 5 s to remove the capping layer and subsequently\nrinsed it with water just before loading the sample in the vacuum chamber of the spectrometer, following the same procedure reported elsewhere [19].\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1(a) shows XAS spectra of the as-grown and HCl-etched (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb thin films at the Fe L2,3 absorption edges. The XAS spectrum of the as-grown sample shows two peaks at h\u03bd \u223c 707.7 eV and \u223c 709.7 eV in the Fe L3 edge, while the XAS spectrum of the HCl-etched sample shows a single peak at h\u03bd \u223c 707.7 eV. This spectral line-shape difference indicates that there are two Fe components in the film: the component having a peak at 709.7 eV, which disappears by the HCl etching, and the component having a peak at 707.7 eV, which remains after the HCl etching.\nFigure 1(b) shows the XMCD spectra of the as-grown film with varying \u03bc0H. At the Fe L3 edge, only the peak around 707.7 eV is observed in the XMCD spectrum taken with \u03bc0H = 0.1 T, while the peak around 709.7 eV increases with increasing \u03bc0H. This suggests that there are mainly two kinds of magnetic components in the (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb thin film, and the components having the peaks at 707.7 eV and 709.7 eV are ferromagnetic-like (FM-like) and paramagnetic-like (PM-like), respectively. The peak positions of the two peaks in the XMCD spectra are almost the same as those in the XAS spectra, as shown\nby the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 1. The XAS and XMCD peaks around 707.7 eV are also observed in other Fe-doped FMSs, such as (Ga,Fe)Sb [19] and (In,Fe)As:Be [22], while the peak position at \u223c 709.7 eV coincides with that of \u03b3-Fe2O3 [24].\nFigure 2 shows the \u03bc0H dependence of the XMCD intensities (XMCD - H curve) measured at h\u03bd = 707.7 eV and 709.7 eV. The XMCD - H curve measured at 707.7 eV steeply increases near the zero magnetic field (0 T < \u03bc0H < 1 T) and gradually increases above \u03bc0H ~1 T. In contrast, the steep increase is almost absent for the XMCD - H curve measured at 709.7 eV, but the linear gradual increase is dominant. These results indicate that the two components having peaks at 707.7 eV and 709.7 eV in the measured thin film are predominantly FM and PM, respectively.\nSince the \u03bc0H dependence of the XMCD intensities indicates that there are two components in (In,Fe)Sb, it is necessary to clarify the origin of each component. We denote the FM-like and PM-like components by \u03b1 and \u03b2. The XMCD spectrum and the XAS spectrum were decomposed into the two components respectively by the following procedure: Firstly, assuming that the magnetization of the \u03b2 component responds linearly to the magnetic field, the XMCD spectra of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 components (\u2206\ud835\udf07\ud835\udefc and \u2206\ud835\udf07\ud835\udefd) were obtained by the following equations:\n\u2206\ud835\udf07\ud835\udefd = 7\n3 (\u2206\ud835\udf077T \u2212 \u2206\ud835\udf074T), (1)\n\u2206\ud835\udf07\ud835\udefc = \u2206\ud835\udf077T \u2212 \u2206\ud835\udf07\ud835\udefd. (2)\nHere, \u2206\ud835\udf07nT is the XMCD spectrum at \u03bc0H = n T. Secondly, we conducted the decomposition of the XAS spectra. Since XAS spectral line shapes are usually insensitive to \u03bc0H, the XAS spectra cannot be decomposed from the \u03bc0H dependence as done for the XMCD spectra. Therefore, we have extracted those Fe components by comparing the XAS spectra before and after the HCl etching as in the previously reported XAS spectra of (Ga,Fe)Sb [19]. Since the peak position of 707.7 eV in the XAS spectrum after the HCl etching corresponds to that of the FM-like component in the XMCD spectra, it is likely that the \u03b1 component is predominant in the XAS spectrum after the HCl etching. Therefore, we have adopted the XAS spectrum after the HCl etching as the XAS spectrum for the \u03b1 component (\u03bc\u03b1). The XAS spectrum for the \u03b2 component (\u03bc\u03b2) is then obtained by subtracting a fraction of \u03bc\u03b1 spectrum from the XAS spectrum of the as-grown sample such that the \u03b1-component shoulder at 707.7 eV disappears in the \u03bc\u03b2 spectrum.\nFigure 3 shows the XAS and XMCD spectra decomposed into the \u03b1 and \u03b2 components at \u03bc0H = 7 T. The XAS spectrum of the \u03b1 component shows a peak only at 707.7 eV in the Fe L3 edge. The spectral line shapes of the XAS and XMCD spectra of the \u03b1 component resemble those of other FMSs such as (Ga,Fe)Sb [19], (In,Fe)As [22], (Al,Fe)Sb [20]. This indicates that the electronic state of the \u03b1 component is close to those\nof the substitutional Fe ions in the other Fe-doped FMSs and that the \u03b1 component is intrinsic to (In,Fe)Sb. On the other hand, the spectral line shapes of the XAS and XMCD spectra of the \u03b2 component having peaks at 708 eV and 709.7 eV in the Fe L3 edge are similar to those of \u03b3-Fe2O3 [24]. Since the HCl etching is considered to remove the layers near the surface, the \u03b2 component removed by the HCl etching is most likely an extrinsic component such as surface oxides.\nTo identify the electronic states of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 components in more detail, we have estimated the magnetic moments using the XMCD sum rules [25,26]. By applying the XMCD sum rules to the obtained XMCD spectra \u2206\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14), the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the doped Fe ions in units of \u03bcB/atom are estimated separately. The XMCD sum rules are as follows:\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f = \u2212 2\ud835\udc5e\n3\ud835\udc5f (10 \u2212 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51),\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \u2248 \u2212 3\ud835\udc5d \u2212 2\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udc5f (10 \u2212 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51).\n(3) (4)\nHere, \ud835\udc5d = \u222b \u2206\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc3f3 , \ud835\udc5e = \u222b \u2206\ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc3f2,3 , \ud835\udc5f = \u222b \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udf14)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc3f2,3 and Nd is the number of 3d electrons. It should be noted here that the ratio between Morb and Mspin can be estimated from the XMCD spectra without the values of r and Nd. The estimated values of Morb/Mspin for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 components at \u03bc0H = 7 T and T = 10 K are listed in Table I. The Morb/Mspin value of the \u03b1 component, which appears to be intrinsic to (In,Fe)Sb, has\na finite positive value of 0.06 \u00b1 0.01. This value is close to 0.065 \u00b1 0.014 reported for (In0.95,Fe0.05)As:Be [21] and larger than 0.043 \u00b1 0.001 for Fe (bcc) [27]. Therefore, the electronic state of the substitutional Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb is similar to that of (In,Fe)As:Be but is different from that of Fe (bcc). Since the orbital magnetic moment of an ionic Fe3+ ion (d5 high-spin state) is zero, the finite Morb/Mspin suggests that the valence of Fe in (In,Fe)Sb is different from the purely ionic Fe3+. The valence state of the doped Fe ions is likely an intermediate state between trivalent and divalent due to a charge transfer from the ligand Sb to the Fe 3d orbitals via the hybridization with the surrounding ligand Sb bands. Assuming that C1|d 5> + C2|d 6L> as the Fe 3d state, which is a superposition of the states d5 and d6L (L is the hole in the ligand), the values of C1 2 and C2 2 for the \u03b1 component are estimated to be 0.94 and 0.06, respectively, from Morb/Mspin. Therefore, the number of electrons Nd is estimated to be 5.06. The values of Morb and Mspin estimated by applying Nd = 5.06 are shown in Table I. Here, the applied correction factor is 0.685 (d 5) [28]. Since the Morb/Mspin value for the \u03b2 component is almost zero, the \u03b2 component probably originates from trivalent Fe3+ (d5) oxides like Fe2O3.\nTo further clarify the magnetic behavior, the \u03bc0H dependences of the magnetizations (M - H curves) are studied. The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows the M - H curves. Here, the magnetization values estimated from the XMCD sum rules are in units of \u03bcB per Fe atom.\nWhile the magnetization of the \u03b2 component is linearly proportional to \u03bc0H, the magnetization of the \u03b1 component shows FM-like behavior with \u03bc0Hs. It should be noted here that the magnetization of the \u03b1 component is not saturated even at the highest \u03bc0H, and the magnetization at 7 T of ~2.8 \u03bcB/Fe is smaller than the full moment of 5 \u03bcB/Fe for Fe3+ (d5). This suggests that the magnetic behavior of the doped Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb involves not only a FM component, but also a PM component. The details of the magnetic components are discussed later.\nFigure 4(a) shows comparison between the M - H curve of the intrinsic Fe component (\u03b1) and the MCD - H curve from visible-light MCD measurements. Since the MCD is the difference between the intensities of the transition from the valence band to the conduction band with circularly polarized lights under an applied \u03bc0H, the MCD signal reflects the Zeeman splitting of the host InSb bands. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the MCD - H curve is almost identical to the M - H curve estimated from the XMCD spectra, indicating that the magnetic behavior of the doped Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb is proportional to the Zeeman splitting of the InSb bands. It should be mentioned here that the net magnetization of the intrinsic Fe component contributes to the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting, although the intrinsic Fe of (In,Fe)Sb contains not only a FM component but also a PM component. Considering the finite Morb discussed above, the substitutional Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb induce\nthe Zeeman splitting of the host InSb via the hybridization between the Fe 3d orbital with the ligand sp bands. Based on these findings, we conclude that the ferromagnetism in (In,Fe)Sb originates from the hybridization between the Fe 3d orbitals and the valence or conduction bands of InSb, but not from oxidized Fe or precipitated Fe metal.\nAs we noted above, the intrinsic component involves both the FM-like and PM-like components. To further investigate this magnetization process of the intrinsic component, we have analyzed the shape of the M - H curve. Note that the local electronic state of the doped Fe ions is common for these FM-like and PM-like components within the experimental accuracy. This suggests that the different magnetic behavior of the doped Fe ions comes from the inhomogeneous distribution of the Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb [20,22]. While the PM component likely originates from isolated Fe ions in regions with low Fe density, regions with high Fe density may contribute to the FM and/or superparamagnetic (SPM) magnetic behavior depending on the size of the regions (Fe domain). In order to determine the ratio of the FM, SPM, and PM components, the M - H curve has been fitted using the following functions:\n\ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5asat\ud835\udc3f ( \ud835\udf07FM\ud835\udf070\ud835\udc3b\n\ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 ) + \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5asat\ud835\udc3f (\n\ud835\udf07SPM\ud835\udf070\ud835\udc3b\n\ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 ) + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc60 \u2212 \ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udf070\ud835\udc3b\n\ud835\udc47 + \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34 . (5)\nHere, the FM and the SPM components are assumed to be represented by Langevin functions, and the PM component is represented by a linear function. \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61) is the ratio of\nFe atoms participating in the FM (SPM), \ud835\udc5asat is the total magnetic moment of the Fe atom, \ud835\udf07FM (\ud835\udf07SPM) is the magnitude of the magnetic moment per FM (SPM) region where the magnetic moments are aligned, \ud835\udc36 is the Curie constant, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34 is the Weiss temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. We have assumed that \ud835\udc5asat = 5 \ud835\udf07B, which is the total magnetic moment of Fe3+. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the fitting well reproduces the M - H curve, suggesting that all the three magnetic components contribute to the intrinsic magnetic behavior. Table II lists the fitted results of the parameters. The percentages of FM, SPM, and PM are about 27 %, 13 %, and 60 %, respectively. Note that we have also tried fitting with a single Langevin function and a linear function, but the M - H curve obtained by the experiment is not reproduced well. \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34 is about 28 K, which is close to the Weiss temperature of PM (Ga0.96,Fe0.04)As without carrier doping (32 K) [29]. This implies that the magnetic interaction between the isolated PM Fe ion in (In,Fe)Sb is antiferromagnetic, consistent with previous theoretical calculations [16]. The magnetic moment per FM domain \ud835\udf07FM is deduced to be about 840 \u03bcB \u2013 1025 \u03bcB, which corresponds to 168 \u2013 205 Fe atoms in each FM domain on average, and \ud835\udf07SPM is about 80 \u03bcB \u2013 125 \u03bcB, which corresponds to 16 \u2013 25 Fe atoms in each SPM domain on average. The formation of Fe-rich domains is consistent with the attractive interaction of Fe atoms in (In,Fe)Sb at the second nearest neighbor site, as predicted by theoretical calculations\n[16]. Although the majority of the Fe ions seems isolated in (In,Fe)Sb and shows PM behavior, a significant fraction of the Fe ions are located close to each other and exhibit the FM or SPM behavior. As the Fe doping concentration is increased, the fraction of Fe atoms involved in the FM region is expected to increase. This model is consistent with the experimental results that TC increases with increasing Fe doping concentration [7,14]. To elucidate the magnetic behavior of (In,Fe)Sb in more detail, the XMCD studies on (In,Fe)Sb with different Fe concentrations are desirable.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, we have performed XMCD measurements on an (In0.94,Fe0.06)Sb thin film to investigate the electronic states of the doped Fe ions related to the ferromagnetism. The XAS and XMCD spectra taken at the Fe L2,3 edges have been decomposed into the substitutional Fe ions of (In,Fe)Sb and extrinsic Fe oxides formed near the surface. The finite ratio of the orbital to spin magnetic moments estimated by applying the XMCD sum rules indicates that the valence state of the substitutional Fe ions in (In,Fe)Sb is not purely ionic Fe3+, but intermediate between Fe3+ and Fe2+. The qualitative correspondence between the visible-light MCD - H and XMCD - H curves demonstrates that the Zeeman splitting of the InSb band is proportional to the net magnetization of the doped Fe atoms.\nBased on these findings, we conclude that the ferromagnetism in (In,Fe)Sb originates from the Fe 3d orbitals hybridized with the host InSb bands. In addition, the fitting result of the M - H curve suggests that the magnetism of (In,Fe)Sb consists of FM, PM, and SPM components, and that all of the magnetic components are derived from the orbital hybridization of the Fe 3d orbitals with the host InSb bands. These results are important for understanding the physical properties of (In,Fe)Sb, such as the mechanism of ferromagnetism, and will be useful for applications such as spintronics devices using (In,Fe)Sb in the future.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work was supported by a Grants-in-Aid (Nos. 20H05650, 18H05345), CREST (No. JPMJCR1777), and PRESTO Programs (Grant No. JPMJPR19LB) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.
