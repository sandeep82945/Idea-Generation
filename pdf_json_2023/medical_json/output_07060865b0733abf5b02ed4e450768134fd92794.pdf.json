    "abstractText": "Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is characterized by increased intestinal permeability. Previous studies have shown that the microRNA-29 gene is involved in the regulation of intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. NF-\u03baB was proved to play a key role in inflammatory response of intestine and resultant disruption of tight junction integrity, whose activity could be inhibited by TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3). However, the exact mechanism that induces increased intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients has not been clarified. In this study, we found that microRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b-3p) was significantly upregulated, while TRAF3 was decreased and the NF-\u03baB-MLCK pathway was activated within the colonic tissue of IBS-D patients. Subsequently, we confirmed the targeting relationship between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3 through a double-luciferase reporter assay. Lentivirus transfection of NCM460 cells with miR-29b-3p-overexpressing and -silencing vectors demonstrated that the expression of TRAF3 was negatively correlated with the level of miR-29b-3p. The NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway was activated in the miR-29b-3p-overexpressing group and inhibited to some extent in the miR-29b-3p-silencing group. Results in WT and miR-29 knockout mice showed that miR-29b-3p levels were increased, TRAF3 levels were decreased, and the NF-\u03baB/MLCK signaling was activated in the WT IBS-D group as compared with the WT control group. The protein levels of TRAF3 and TJs in the miR29b IBS-D group were partially recovered and NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway indicators were, to a certain extent, decreased as compared with the WT IBS-D group. These results suggested that miR-29b-3p deletion enhances the TRAF3 level in IBS-D mice and alleviates the high intestinal permeability. In brief, through the analysis of intestinal tissue samples from IBS-D patients and miR-29b IBS-D mice, we showed that miR-29b-3p is involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal hyperpermeability in IBS-D via targeting TRAF3 to regulate the NF-\u03baBMLCK signaling pathway.

            "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is characterized by increased\nintestinal permeability. Previous studies have shown that the microRNA-29 gene is involved in the regulation of intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D. NF-\u03baB was proved to play a key role in inflammatory response of intestine and resultant disruption of tight junction integ-\nrity, whose activity could be inhibited by TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3). How-\never, the exact mechanism that induces increased intestinal permeability in IBS-D patients\nhas not been clarified. In this study, we found that microRNA-29b-3p (miR-29b-3p) was significantly upregulated, while TRAF3 was decreased and the NF-\u03baB-MLCK pathway was activated within the colonic tissue of IBS-D patients. Subsequently, we confirmed the target-\ning relationship between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3 through a double-luciferase reporter\nassay. Lentivirus transfection of NCM460 cells with miR-29b-3p-overexpressing and -silenc-\ning vectors demonstrated that the expression of TRAF3 was negatively correlated with the level of miR-29b-3p. The NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway was activated in the miR-29b-3p-overexpressing group and inhibited to some extent in the miR-29b-3p-silencing group. Results in\nWT and miR-29 knockout mice showed that miR-29b-3p levels were increased, TRAF3 levels were decreased, and the NF-\u03baB/MLCK signaling was activated in the WT IBS-D group as compared with the WT control group. The protein levels of TRAF3 and TJs in the miR29b-/- IBS-D group were partially recovered and NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway indicators were, to a certain extent, decreased as compared with the WT IBS-D group. These results suggested\nthat miR-29b-3p deletion enhances the TRAF3 level in IBS-D mice and alleviates the high\nintestinal permeability. In brief, through the analysis of intestinal tissue samples from IBS-D patients and miR-29b-/- IBS-D mice, we showed that miR-29b-3p is involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal hyperpermeability in IBS-D via targeting TRAF3 to regulate the NF-\u03baBMLCK signaling pathway.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597 July 10, 2023 1 / 18\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Wang Y, Ke W, Gan J, Zhu H, Xie X, He G, et al.

            "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with defecation or altered bowel habits. Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) is one of the major subtype of IBS [1], which imposes a substantial burden on patients and the healthcare system, resulting in decreased quality of life for patients [2]. At present, the pathogenesis of IBS-D is not fully understood, which may involve genetic predisposition, intestinal hyperpermeability, altered intestinal barrier function, immune dysregulation, and brain-gut imbalance [3, 4]. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the underlying pathomechanism of IBS-D in order to develop effective treatments for this disease.\nIntestinal hyperpermeability proved to play an important part in the pathogenesis of IBS-D\n[5]. Maintenance of intestinal permeability relies on an intact intestinal barrier function. The intimate connections between cytoskeletal structures and intercellular tight junctions (TJs) contribute to the integrity of the intestinal barrier [6]. Cytoplasmic claudins, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) proteins are important TJs proteins that determine intestinal permeability [7]. JAMs play a crucial role in forming cell polarity and cell junctions [8]. Claudin-1 is involved with certain channel and sealing functions [9]. Occludin is an essential component of the maintenance and regulation of the intestinal barrier function [10]. All these are important intestinal epithelial TJs, once destructed, can lead to increased gut permeability, which could finally induce local or systemic inflammation [11]. Interestingly, and vice versa, increased permeability of the colonic epithelium could also be a consequence of inflammatory response and disruption of TJ integrity, through which process, NF-\u03baB was shown to play a key role via multiple cellular signaling pathways [12]. Indeed, NF-\u03baB is extensively involved in numerous inflammatory diseases, including inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract [13]. The most abundant form of NF-\u03baB activated by pathological stimulation through a typical pathway is the p50:p65 heterodimer [14]. And furtherly, myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) is an important signaling node that regulates the integrity of TJs. Previous research has demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 activates NF-\u03baB via a pathway involving MLCK, thereby influencing the intestinal barrier function [15].\nMicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of target\ngenes by complementary pairing with the target gene mRNA 3 UTR [16]. Studies have reported that microRNA-29 is involved in regulating IBS-D intestinal epithelial barrier function [17]. The increased expression of miR-29 in the intestinal tissues of IBS-D patients resulted in the decreased expression of NKRF [18], a transcriptional silencer of NF-\u03baB [19]. Moreover, TRAF3 can inhibit the activity of NF-\u03baB by continuously mediating the degradation of NF-\u03baB-induced kinase [20]. In the previous study, it was found that the expression level of miR-29b-3p was increased and the expression level of TRAF3 was decreased in the intestinal tissues of IBS-D patients, and there was a targeted inhibition relationship between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3. However, the mechanism of regulation of IBS-D by miR-29b-3p through targeted inhibition of TRAF3 has not been reported. In order to explore the specific role of miR-29b-3p in IBS-D, this study was verified by clinical tissue samples, animal experiments and cell experiments. This study aims to elucidate the mechanism by which miR-29b3p regulates the NF-\u03baB-MLCK signaling pathway involved in IBS-D intestinal hyperpermeability through targeted inhibition of TRAF3. This will provide a new idea for the establishment of biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of IBS-D.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597 July 10, 2023 2 / 18\ncollection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."

            "text": "IBS-D is a common gastrointestinal disorder in clinic characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea, whose etiopathogenesis is associated with hyperpermeability and hypersensitivity of the intestinal tract [31]. Previous studies have shown that mild inflammation and disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier play an crucial role in the progression of IBS-D, as both allow increased amounts of D-LA produced by the intestinal flora to enter the blood circulation through the damaged mucosal cells [32]. DAO is a catabolic pathway enzyme that frequently accumulates within the intestinal mucosa and microvilli. During ischemia or hypoxia, DAO can be released into the blood, and its serum concentration is positively correlated with the integrity of the intestinal mucosa [33]. Similarly, LPS has been shown to be closely related to intestinal barrier integrity resulting from dysregulated intestinal homeostasis [34]. Therefore, D-LA, DAO, and LPS are widely used to assess intestinal cell damage and dysfunction in IBS-D, and all these three indicators are negatively correlated with intestinal mucosal permeability. Our results demonstrated higher serum levels of D-LA, DAO, and LPS in IBS-D model\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597.g006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597 July 10, 2023 13 / 18\nmice than control mice, with miR-29b-/- mice in much lower level compared with corresponding WT mice.\nIntestinal hyperpermeability induced by acetic acid stimulation leads to damage of the\nintestinal mucosal barrier and allows for invasion of pathogenic bacteria [28]. What\u2019s more, anxiety and depression are common in patients suffering from functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS-D [35]. Repeated exposure to WAS successfully reproduced sustained visceral hyperalgesia after stress sensitization in animals in parallel with psychiatric comorbidity of IBS-D patients in clinic, which is widely accepted as an suitable IBS model [36]. Therefore, we established IBS-D mice model by combination of acetic acid enema and WAS. In the current study, H&E staining of intestinal biopsies from IBS-D patients and IBS-D mice exhibited mild inflammatory cell infiltration, crypt damage, and TJ destruction. Serum D-LA, DAO, and LPS levels were also remarkably increased (Pall < 0.01) in IBS-D patients and IBS-D mice. In addition, the visceral sensitivity of IBS-D model mice was enhanced as indicated by AWR score and the severity of diarrhea in IBS-D mice was aggravated as indicated by fecal water content, which were consistent with the abdominal pain and pathological diarrhea manifestations of IBS-D patients in clinic.\nMicroRNAs, which are small RNAs capable of regulating protein levels, have attracted\ninterest in recent years as diagnostic biomarkers, pathogenic indicators, and potential therapeutic targets. Members of the miR-29b family include miR-29b-3p, and miR-29b-5p, and their mature sequences have high similarity. Nonetheless, due to the different isomers, their determined functions differ [37]. Recent studies have shown that miR-29b-3p plays an important role in the progress of IBS-D concerning intestinal permeability [18]. Studies have reported that miR-29b-3p plays a key role in ischemia-reperfusion injury by targeting TRAF3 [30]. Our dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that microRNA-29b-3p\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597.g007\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597 July 10, 2023 14 / 18\ncould target to TRAF3 in NCM460 cells. TRAF3 is an important signal transducer involved in the interferon regulator NF-\u03baB and apoptotic signaling pathways [38], which is widely expressed in the brain, lung, heart, spleen, and liver and is a target gene of miR-29b-3p. A previous study reported an important \u03b2-cell-macrophage pathway mediated by miRNA29-TRAF3 [39], while another study found that miR-29b-3p affects the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 by targeting TRAF3 and activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway [40]. More importantly, studies revealed that microRNA-29 and its target genes NF-\u03baB inhibitor (NKFR) and Claudin-1 play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBS-D as key regulators of intestinal permeability [18]. TNF-\u03b1, a common inflammatory cytokine, can promote the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, which leads to an increase in intestinal permeability [41]. After activation of NF-\u03baB, both p50 and p65 were significantly upregulated [42]. Studies have shown that NF-\u03baB within the intestinal epithelium directly targets to MLCK and modulates the activity of MLCK. Specifically, activated NF-\u03baB released p50 and p65 to act on MLCK [43]. Consequently, MLCK mediates the phosphorylation of MLC, causing contraction of the cytoskeleton of intestinal epithelial cells, eventually leading to TJ dysregulation and intestinal hyperpermeability [44].\nIn the current study, we found that the expression level of miR-29b-3p within the colonic\nmucosa of IBS-D patients was significantly increased, the expression level of its target gene TRAF3 was reversely decreased, and the related NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway indicators (TNF-\u03b1, p65, p50, and MLCK) were increased. These results suggested that miR-29b-3p and its target gene TRAF3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS-D. To verify this hypothesis, we silenced and overexpressed miR-29b-3p in NCM460 cells and further assessed the function of miR-29b in miR-29b knockout mice.\nIn the cell experiment, we found that the expression of TRAF3 in NCM460 cells in the\nmiR-29b-3p-overexpressing group was significantly reduced, which further verified the negative targeting relationship between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3. The elevation of miR-29b-3p significantly inhibited the normal expression of TRAF3. Due to the absence of TRAF3, the NF\u03baB pathway was activated, which resulted in the subsequent activation of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB heterodimer p50/p65, and increased MLCK gene activity and protein expression. Phosphorylation of MLC proved to eventually lead to the disruption of TJs and increased permeability [45]. However, in the miR-29b-3p-silencing group, the expression of the miR-29b-3p gene was relatively decreased, resulting in enhanced expression of TRAF3, which inhibited the NF-\u03baB/ MLCK pathway to a certain extent. Our results confirmed a negative feedback regulation between TRAF3 and NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway at the cellular level. Overexpression of miR-29b3p inhibited the level of TRAF3, which resulted in the activation of the NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway and disruption of TJs.\nFurtherly, we compared the gene and protein expression of TRAF3, NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway-related indicators, and TJs in the colon tissue of IBS-D mouse model. It was found that compared with the WT control group, the expression of TRAF3 in the WT IBS-D group was significantly reduced, the NF-\u03baB/MLCK pathway was activated, and the expression of TJs were significantly downregulated. Our experimental results confirmed that the expression levels of JAM-A, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were reduced in IBS-D mice, which was in parallel with the significantly increased intestinal permeability as indicated by enhanced serum levels of D-LA, DAO, and LPS in IBS-D model group. However, compared with WT IBS-D mice, miR-29b-/- IBS-D mice showed less protein damage to JAM-A, Occludin, and Claudin-1 and alleviated intestinal hyperpermeability. These data suggested that miR-29b deficiency (or downregulation) could improve intestinal barrier function by targeting TRAF3 to inhibit the NF-\u03baB/MLCK signaling pathway.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287597 July 10, 2023 15 / 18"

While in miR-29b knockout mice and miR-29b-3p-silenced NCM460 cells, activation of NF-\u03baB-MLCK pathway was inhibited and the TJs and intestinal epithelial barrier function were restored. Hence, we speculated that the colon hyperpermeability of IBS-D patients may be regulated by the endogenous interaction between miR-29b-3p and TRAF3 along with its downstream NF-\u03baB-MLCK pathway.\nSupporting information"
