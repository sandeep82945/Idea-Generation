Literature reports show the successful use of inorganic materials e.g., carbon, metal oxide, and their combinations produce adsorbents and membranes with catalytic properties or magnetic properties for the removal of metal ions and dyes.1\u20135\nCellulose and nanocellulose (either cellulose nanocrystals CNC or cellulose nanobril (CNF)) have emerged in recent years as versatile biobased choices for water treatment6\u201311 thanks to their meritorious properties, such as low environmental impact, high natural abundancy, and versatile surface chemistry which allows for functionalization.6,7 Cellulose offers an abundance of hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) which are susceptible to modication.\nChemistry, Stockholm University, Svante\nweden.

See DOI:\n2\u20135899\nAn efficient method to introduce carboxyl groups (\u2013COO\u2013) and increase the affinity of cellulose towards cationic species is by selectively oxidizing the primary alcohol of its structure via 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) mediated oxidation12 Currently, TEMPO oxidation constitutes the most used pretreatment method (before mechanical disintegration of cellulose pulps) for the preparation of highly charged CNF (oen denoted as TEMPO-CNF or TO-CNF) and has been reported as a successful in situ modication method of cellulosic membranes.13 Despite the broad use of cellulose membranes in water purication, there are certain limitations in their capabilities.\nThe typically dense structure of the bodies of membranes leads to a high-pressure drop when used in dead-end ow and cross-ow. Pressure drop is dened as the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet of a lter and it can result in the movement or even fracture of the lter. One way to reduce the pressure drop is to increase the permeability of a membrane either by reducing its thickness or increasing its porosity. However, both approaches involve a tradeoff between the mechanical properties and the efficiency of the lter. A less dense membrane matrix entails that a smaller amount of material is used and fewer functional groups are present to facilitate the adsorption. To overcome these drawbacks, 3-D adsorbents have been developed, for instance in the form of spherically shaped and porous aerogel and hydrogel particles.14\u201317 Such particles were successfully prepared from\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Fig. 1 depicts the GGMMG conguration, as an example of an alginate structural motif.\nDue to its structure, alginate forms hydrogels upon interaction with ionic cross-linking agents such as divalent cations. When aqueous alginate solutions are poured dropwise into CaCl2 solutions they instantly form spherical-shaped hydrogels because of the ionic-crosslinking of the G units of adjacent polymer chains, forming a so-called egg-box structure.6 Notably, it is believed that only the G units bind to Ca2+ because of their higher degree of coordination.21\nThe carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of alginate and cellulose make cellulose/alginate composites highly promising for use in water treatment applications for the removal of cationic pollutants. Stand-alone alginate25,26 as well as cellulose/alginate beads27,28 have already been reported for heavy metal ion removal.\nWe aimed to investigate the effect of in situ TEMPO oxidation on nanocellulose/alginate composite beads to control and enhance the performance which has not explored to date. We hypothesize that by oxidizing the available hydroxyl groups of cellulose, the amount of carboxyl groups would increase and thereby improve the removal capacity of the beads. For this purpose, commercial-grade debrillated cellulose and SA were used for the preparation of beads which were then modied in situ by TEMPO-mediated oxidation. The effect of this modication was monitored by comparing the adsorption capacity of the pristine hydrogel beads (denoted as C-SA) with that of TEMPO-oxidized beads (denoted as TO-C-SA) toward Methylene Blue (MB, a cationic model dye) and metal ion (Cd2+ from mining effluent), respectively.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Our beads are pure organic biopolymers without any inorganic materials with good efficiency. It should be also notted that most of these efficiencies are based on the biopolymer of the beads e.g., chitosan.31 Cellulose-based beads are economically cheaper than chitosan based beads.32 Copper ions were suggested to replace Ca2+ for the formation of Graphene oxide (GO)/SA/Carrageenan (GO/Alg-Car) beads (Ala : Car : GO = 2 : 2 : 1).33 The use of Ca2+ is environmentally benign compared to Cu2+ ions that can be released into the aqueoutic system causing secondary pollution.

It was established that Cu2+ ions are adsorbed onto the TCNF via electrostatic interactions involving the carboxyl groups on the oxidized cellulose ber surface.36 The proton of the carboxyl group is exchanged with a metal ion during the adsorption process. Although the obtained data from EDS and XPS follow the same trend, there are signicant differences in at% values. XPS is a surface analysis technique using a lower energy X-ray beam compared to EDS. In XPS, the beam penetration depth is about 10 nm while EDS assesses the entire bulk. In addition, the XPS measurements were performed on beads that were used to treat samples of actual effluents from mining. The presence of a plethora of charged contaminants may have affected the interaction between the beads and Cd2+.\nads after Cd2+ adsorption.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Similarly, the deconvolution of the C 1s spectrum of TO-C-SA beads aer adsorption shows peaks at BE of 284.8, 286.7, 288.2, 288.9, and 289.4 eV (Fig. 6b). The rst three peaks are assigned to C\u2013C, C\u2013O, and C]O, respectively. The peaks at 288.9 and 289.4 eV correspond to the carboxyl groups (O\u2013C]O) for alginate (G or M) and TEMPO-oxidized cellulose (O\u2013C]O), respectively.37\nThe deconvolution of the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of C-SA beads aer Cd2+ adsorption reveals peaks at BE of 530.9, 531.9, 532.9, and 533.9 eV, which correspond to C\u2013O, C]O, O\u2013 C]O, and O\u2013Cd, respectively (Fig. 7a). From the deconvolution of the O 1s spectrum of TO-C-SA beads aer adsorption, peaks at BE of 530.4, 531.4, 532.5, and 533.9 eV are revealed (Fig. 7b). The peaks correspond to the same type of O as in C-SA; however, the intensity of the peak that corresponds to C]O increases, presumably due to the contribution of the carboxyl O atoms that are introduced with the TEMPO oxidation.38,39\nFig. 8 Cd 3d high-resolution XPS spectra of (a) C-SA and (b) TO-C-SA\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Cd\n2+ is adsorbed on the surface of the beads due to interactions with the O atoms of the carbonyl groups of alginate. However, the deconvolution of the Cd 3d2 spectrum of the TO-C-SA beads reveals two additional lower-intensity peaks at 404.8 and 413.2 eV (Fig. 8b). These two peaks presumably correspond to Cd2+ ions that are adsorbed on the surface of the beads due to interactions with the carboxyl O atoms that are introduced with the TEMPO oxidation. Binding energies of approximately 7 eV of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 are characteristic of the two states of Cd2+.8"

The dewatering time increased to 46.3 \u00b1 2.6 s with the use of commercial-grade lter paper. The required dewatering time was 28.8 \u00b1 2.2, 30.5 \u00b1 3.1, and 44.2 \u00b1 3.6 s when packing the column with 1, 5, and 10 g of C-SA beads, respectively (the corresponding ux was calculated to be 16 720, 17 724, 11 541 L h\u22121 m\u22122 bar\u22121) The required dewatering time was identical when instead lling the column with TO-C-SA beads was 28.6 \u00b1 1.1, 30.4 \u00b1 0.7, and 44.0 \u00b1 2.5 s for 1, 5, and 10 g of beads, respectively (the experimental set up is shown in Fig. 9). The obtained dewatering times clearly show that a single layer of beads with 1 g of beads did not affect the water ow. An amount of 10 g of beads, which formed a stack of layers of approximately 2.5 cm, showed better water ux than commercial lter paper. Additionally, the average dewatering times for TO-C-SA and C-SA beads are the same which indicates that, in this range, the functionalization does not affect the water ux. Furthermore, the water ux was found to be higher than that reported for cellulose-based layered membrane systems in previous studies from our group which uctuated from 3417 to 14 742 L h\u22121 m\u22122 bar\u22121.13,40\u201343"

            "text": "We devised a facile method of preparing nanocellulose/alginate composite beads with increased adsorption performance derived from the in situ TEMPO oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Oxidation of the beads increased the number of carboxyl groups which can facilitate the removal of cationic impurities from aqueous samples. The enhancement of removal efficiency of the cationic dye MB and Cd2+ was conrmed with UV-vis measurements (for MB), EDS, and XPS\n5898 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5892\u20135899\n(for Cd2+). Interestingly, the EDS elemental analysis of the beads showed an almost 3-fold improvement in Cd2+ removal aer the in situ oxidation. Furthermore, the obtained water ux data indicates that the prepared beads can be used for the manufacturing of column lters. This approach offers lters with a higher amount of adsorbent and better water permeability than 2D membrane lters. Overall, the abundance of the component feedstock, as well as the ease and efficiency of the modication route indicate that the nanocomposite beads are promising candidates for larger production and manufacturing of column lters for water purication. Nevertheless, how the mechanical properties of the beads were affected by the oxidation and how the presence of several charged contaminants in the same sample affects the adsorption performance of the beads will be a subject of future investigation. The long-term stability and recyclability of the beads will also be a topic of further investigation."
