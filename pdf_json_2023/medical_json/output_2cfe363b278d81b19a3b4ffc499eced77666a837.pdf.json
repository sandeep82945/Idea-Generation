    "abstractText": "\u2018Glomerulonephritis\u2019 (GN) is a term used to describe a group of heterogeneous immune-mediated disorders characterized by inflammation of the filtration units of the kidney (the glomeruli). These disorders are currently classified largely on the basis of histopathological lesion patterns, but these patterns do not align well with their diverse pathological mechanisms and hence do not inform optimal therapy. Instead, we propose grouping GN disorders into five categories according to t he ir i mm un op at ho ge nesis: infection-related GN, autoimmune GN, alloimmune GN, autoinflammatory GN and monoclonal gammopathy-related GN. This categorization can inform the appropriate treatment; for example, infection control for infectionrelated GN, suppression of adaptive immunity for autoimmune GN and alloimmune GN, inhibition of single cytokines or complement factors for autoinflammatory G N a r i s i ng f r o m inborn errors in innate immunity, and plasma cell clone-directed or B cell clone-directed therapy for monoclonal gammopathies. Here we present the immunopathogenesis of GN and immunotherapies in use and in development and discuss how an immunopathogenesis-based GN classification can focus research, and improve patient management and teaching.

            "text": "Acute GN most frequently presents with high blood pressure (hypertension), proteinuria (excessive protein in the urine) and haematuria (blood in the urine), whereas GN with predominant podocyte injury causes\u00a0nephrotic syndrome presenting with a massive proteinuria causing leg oedema (Box\u00a01). In general, proteinuria with a predominant component of albumin indicates podocyte injury, whereas haematuria implies ruptures of the GBM. As these unspecific clinical signs rarely allow a precise diagnosis of the GN subtype, only kidney biopsy can confirm GN, and histopathological lesion patterns visualized by immunostaining for immunoglobulin and complement components are used to define GN subcategories15,16.\nLesion patterns and histological signs A diagnostic kidney biopsy can distinguish GN from other kidney disorders and define the injured glomerular compartment. This has led to descriptive terms such as \u2018mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis\u2019, \u2018membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis\u2019, \u2018membranous glomerulonephritis\u2019, \u2018crescentic glomerulonephritis\u2019, \u2018minimal change disease\u2019 and \u2018focal segmental\u00a0glomerulosclerosis\u2019 (Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02). Histological signs of immunological activity, such as the presence of deposits of complement factors and immune complexes, their isotypes and their clonality, as well as ultrastructural changes observed with electron microscopy, provide further clues to the underlying cause of GN. For example, expansion of the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, named \u2018tubuloreticular structures\u2019, in glomerular cells is considered an ultrastructural hallmark of type\u00a0I interferon signalling, although the molecular mechanisms remain unknown17. However, lesion patterns such as immune complex GN, complement factor C3 GN (C3GN) and pauci-immune GN are nonspecific regarding the underlying pathophysiology. Frequently, additional immunophenotyping is needed to precisely define the type of GN (Box\u00a01).\nKidney biopsy also allows active and potentially reversible lesions to be distinguished from inactive disease or chronic and irreversible lesions (Table\u00a01), and this informs immunotherapy. Active lesions include intravascular neutrophil karyorrhexis or NETosis, immunothrombosis and fibrin deposition, endothelial and mesangial cell proliferation, glomerular leukocytic infiltrates, vascular loop necrosis, cellular crescents (that is, massive hyperplasia of parietal epithelial cells in the Bowman space obstructing glomerular outflow)10 and periglomerular lymphocyte infiltrates18. Glomerular deposits of IgM, IgG, C1q, C3c and C4d or a combination of these support complement activation. Only GN with such evidence of immunological activity may benefit from immunotherapy. By contrast, any fibrous transformation of glomerular structures and atrophy of kidney tubules or fibrosis within the interstitium indicate irreversible loss of kidney parenchyma. However, pathology lesion-based GN categories often do not dissect the diversity of underlying immunological disorders, which require different treatments19\u201321; hence, treatment of lesion-based GN categories results in many \u2018non-responders\u201922."

            "text": "Glomerulonephritis (GN) describes a variety of relatively rare immunemediated diseases characterized by damage to the glomerular compartment of the\u00a0nephrons of the kidney1. If not properly treated, acute GN can lead to chronic kidney disease and irreversible kidney failure2,3, with patients requiring kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation). Data from a US Medicare cohort (with average age of 75 years) indicated that up to 1.2% of individuals are affected by GN4. Moreover, GN accounts for 18.7% of Germans with chronic kidney disease and 30\u201336% of end-stage kidney disease in US children and adolescents5,6. In addition, GN is more prevalent and may be more\u00a0severe in certain ethnic groups, such as African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Australian and Canadian First Nations populations.\nTraditionally, GN has been classified by histopathological lesion patterns. However, the growing understanding of immunopathogenesis of the wide spectrum of GN and the increasing numbers of immunomodulatory drugs require a categorization that better connects with effective treatments. Here we propose a new classification for GN, present the latest insights on their respective immunopathogenesis and discuss how these imply specific immunotherapies.\nKey features of glomerular anatomy and function The\u00a0glomerular filtration barrier is responsible for creating an ultrafiltrate of water and low molecular weight solutes, while retaining most high molecular weight proteins and blood cells within the vasculature7. The glomerular microvasculature is particularly vulnerable to immunemediated injury because the filtration process involves delicate anatomical structures that are exposed to substantial shear stress and perfusion pressure. Highly specialized glomerular endothelial cells build a size- and charge-dependent barrier to serum proteins, while in a similar manner the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) itself is also highly specialized. The outer aspect of the filter membrane harbours postmitotic epithelial cells with octopus-like primary, secondary and interdigitating tertiary foot processes, cells known as\u00a0podocytes8 (Fig.\u00a01). A zipper-like slit membrane between these foot processes comprising nephrin and other podocyte proteins forms the ultimate barrier to small serum proteins9. The glomerular tuft is surrounded by\u00a0parietal epithelial cells along the\u00a0Bowman capsule, which directs the ultrafiltrate towards the draining tubule. Immune-mediated injury to any of these structures can cause loss of serum proteins into the urine or even stop filtration, the key function of the kidney needed to maintain internal homeostasis1,10.\nInfectious organisms, their immunostimulatory or toxic components, immunoglobulins activating complement, spontaneous activation of the complement system, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), infiltrating myeloid cells, helper or cytotoxic T cells and other innate and adaptive immune effectors can cause glomerular injury, detectable as leakage of albumin or other serum proteins, erythrocytes and leukocytes into the urine1. Depending on the acuity of the immune process, GN presents as a chronic, a subacute or even a peracute illness1. For example, certain infectious or autoimmune stimuli can lead to massive activation of complement or NET release inside glomeruli, causing diffuse capillary loop necrosis and necroinflammation and impairing glomerular filtration, leading to a rapid decline in the excretory function\u00a0of the kidneys11,12. Because the filtration process occurs under high perfusion pressure across a delicate barrier, serum proteins can be easily trapped within the\u00a0mesangium or along the GBM. Diabetes mellitus, obesity, a high-salt diet and hypertension further increase filtration pressure and accelerate glomerular injury (glomerular barotrauma) and promote barrier dysfunction even in less severe inflammatory states13. Finally, leukocytes\nNature Reviews Immunology | Volume 23 | July 2023 | 453\u2013471 455\nhost defence. This category of GN responds to infection control with antibiotics or antivirals. The second category is autoimmune GN, which involves adaptive immune responses directed against distinct autoantigens, and thus therapeutic targets involve suppression of autoantigen presentation and clones of autoreactive lymphocytes. Third, alloimmune GN can occur in the context of kidney transplantation and requires suppression of donor-specific immunity. Fourth, autoinflammatory GN originates from inborn errors of innate immunity and responds to inhibitors of single cytokines or complement factors. Finally, monoclonal gammopathy-related GN involves direct glomerular deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulins and requires therapies directed against the pathogenic plasma cell clone or B cell clone. Here we discuss recent developments in immunophenotyping, immune mechanisms of glomerular injury, and recent and upcoming immunotherapies for each of these GN subtypes."

GN affects 30% of patients with endocarditis (a rare and potentially fatal infection of the inner lining of the heart)25 and 0.7\u20132% of patients with infected ventriculoatrial shunts25,26. HIV-associated nephropathy is more common in individuals of sub-Saharan descent due in part to the high prevalence of\u00a0apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles in this population27,28. GN occurs in more than 50% of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection29. GN due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HBV-endemic areas but has become rare in HBV-vaccinated populations30. Like other helminthic diseases, schistosomiasis can cause GN31,32. Limited data exist in developing countries, but in sub-Saharan Africa, eosinophil-mediated glomerular injury is common in children, likely due to the infections prevalent in this region33. Indeed, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), parvovirus B19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u00a02 (SARS-CoV-2), syphilis, tuberculosis and malaria have all been linked to the development of GN34."

The glomerulus is the blood-filtering unit of the kidney. Each glomerulus drains the filtrate into its own tubule, and the glomerulus and its tubules together constitute the functional unit of the kidney, the nephron. The vascular part of each glomerulus includes an afferent arteriole, an efferent arteriole and a capillary network inside the glomerulus, where the filtration occurs under conditions of high perfusion pressure and shear stress. The capillary network is held together by mesenchymal cells, known as mesangial cells, and a matrix, which regulate capillary tension. Parts of the glomerular filtrate pass through the mesangium; hence, circulating antigens and immunoglobulins can get trapped there. Glomerular capillaries are characterized by a fenestrated endothelium covered with glycocalyx\nand attached to the glomerular basement membrane. At the outer aspect of the glomerular capillaries, podocytes attach to the glomerular basement membrane. Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells with neuron-like primary and secondary foot processes interdigitated with the respective secondary foot processes of neighbouring podocytes. Between podocyte foot processes is the slit diaphragm, which covers a large area of the filtration barrier and is essential for preventing the passage of serum proteins such as albumin into the filtrate. Water, ions and other small solutes cross the filtration barrier through pores in the slit diaphragm. Inflammatory processes in the glomerulus typically alter the barrier function and cause leakage of serum proteins and frequently also of intact blood cells into the urine.\nNature Reviews Immunology | Volume 23 | July 2023 | 453\u2013471 456\nand sometimes IgA bind to streptococcal antigens trapped in glomeruli, and the in situ formation of immune complexes triggers endothelial damage by activating the classical complement pathway. However, chemokine-binding evasins secreted by streptococci and other proteins of the bacterial surface suppress activation of the classical complement pathway35. The leading candidate antigens are nephritisassociated plasmin receptor (NAPlr; identified as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin\u00a0B (SpeB; a cationic cysteine proteinase)36. These antigens also induce the release of IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-8 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 from peripheral blood leukocytes, promoting glomerular inflammation36. NAPlr activates C3, and SpeB evades innate host defence by degrading lytic complement factors35\u201337. Both induce adhesion molecule expression, increase leukocyte recruitment and directly activate the alternative complement pathway. The alternative complement pathway may also be activated by transiently produced autoantibodies targeting factor\u00a0B, a regulator of the alternative complement pathway38. Sometimes, infections also induce a transient production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), antinuclear\nantibodies or cryoglobulins24 as an additional autoimmune component to infection-related GN.\nDeposition of circulating immune complexes The most important mechanism precipitating kidney injury during active infection involves the deposition of circulating immune complexes, as observed in endocarditis, skin ulcers and cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, visceral abscess and urinary tract infection39, a process that implies persistent presence of antigens in the blood40. Indeed, impaired clearance of pathogens in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to infection-related GN and the deposition of pathogen antigens in the glomeruli. Antigens can also persist in the blood in infections with pathogens that integrate into the host genome, such as HCV, HIV, EBV, intracellular Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leading to deposition of antigen\u2013antibody immune complexes in the glomeruli. Similarly, parasites that encode strategies of immune evasion, such as members of the genus Schistosoma, which cover themselves with host proteins, can persist in the blood. Some body compartments are difficult to reach for immune effectors or antibiotics, including biofilms on implants, heart valves or bones, allowing pathogens to escape elimination and establish chronic infection.\nDirect cytotoxic effects of pathogens Some pathogens have direct effects on kidney cells, precipitating glomerular filtration barrier impairments (Fig.\u00a03). HIV, EBV, arbovirus, parvovirus B19 or SARS-CoV-2 can infect and injure glomerular epithelial cells41\u201343. Moreover, viral nucleic acids promote intraglomerular production of type\u00a0I interferons leading to podocyte detachment or death, reduced production of podocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor needed for maintaining glomerular endothelial cells and collapse of glomerular capillaries8,44. Podocyte loss is associated with proteinuria and irreversible glomerulosclerosis45. Type\u00a0I interferons induce podocyte death by catastrophic mitosis and block the differentiation of local podocyte progenitors into new podocytes17,46,47. By contrast, activation of immature progenitors among the parietal epithelial cells can result in the formation of hyperplastic lesions that obliterate the Bowman space and block glomerular filtration loss48.\nPodocyte loss in viral infections also relates to their ability to promote the release of type\u00a0I interferons through activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein\u00a03 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the cytosolic nucleotide sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). This pathway is confounded by the presence of APOL1 risk kidney alleles27, which have been selected in individuals of sub-Saharan ancestry, including 30% of African Americans, as they confer protection against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection (sleeping sickness)27. However, they predispose to progressive disease in a variety of glomerular diseases27. Expression of high-risk APOL1 genotypes, called \u2018G1\u2019 and \u2018G2\u2019, induces activation of STING, leading to the production of type\u00a0I interferons, with consequent podocyte loss. High-risk APOL1 alleles also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, with consequent release of IL-1\u03b249 that promotes the death of podocytes by pyroptosis50. In turn, APOL1 expression itself is upregulated by type\u00a0I interferons and this further enhances podocyte loss8, in an autoactivation loop21,50. This may explain why Schistosoma infection-related GN progresses quickly to kidney failure in APOL1 carriers or in patients co-infected with HIV, HCV or HBV8. Type\u00a0I interferons, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF induced by SARS-CoV-2 trigger the expression of pathogenic APOL1 via JAK\u2013STAT signalling, resulting in podocyte loss and COVID-19-associated nephropathy51.\nBox 1\nImmunophenotyping for the classification of patients with glomerulonephritis\n\u2022 Clinical signs and symptoms of glomerular injury: impaired glomerular barrier function (proteinuria and haematuria); impaired excretory kidney function indicated by hypertension, oedema (both related to salt and water retention) or increased levels of metabolites, such as creatinine and urea, in the blood. \u2022 Clinical context: history of extrarenal manifestations of infections, autoimmune disease, transplantation, autoinflammatory disorders or multiple myeloma. \u2022 Blood tests to detect leukopenia, acute phase proteins, immunoglobulin levels, complementopenia, autoantibodies, alloantibodies, antivaccine titres, HLA type, free light chains, monoclonal gammopathy or pathogen-related changes. \u2022 Microbiology tests: blood pathogen microscopy, blood cultures, swabs, catheter or implant cultures, tissue aspirates or biopsies. \u2022 Kidney biopsy: immunofluorescence for immunoglobulins, \u03ba/\u03bb idiotypes, complement factors, standard stains (periodic acid\u2013Schiff, hematoxylin\u2013eosin and silver stains), immunostaining for pathogens and electron microscopy. \u2022 Genetic testing: panel sequencing for cytokine, interferon and complement pathways (autoinflammation), Sanger sequencing for collagens, apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles (glomerulosclerosis), whole-exome sequencing (primary immunodeficiencies). \u2022 Miscellaneous examinations: imaging studies (kidney, origin of infections or multiple myeloma), bone marrow aspirate, immune cell flow cytometry and B cell sequencing for clonal analysis."

GN involving ANCAs, anti-podocyte antibodies or antichromatin antibodies is also relatively common57\u201359 (Table\u00a03). The higher prevalence and disease severity of IgA nephropathy in Asia or of lupus nephritis in people of African descent may be explained by gene variants that affect checkpoints of immune tolerance, including monogenic primary immunodeficiencies60 or variants in HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and Fc receptors61,62. Alternatively, it has been proposed that somatic mutation-driven expansion of autoreactive B cell clones resembling features of clonal haematopoiesis may explain the pathogenesis of autoimmune GN63,64.

The reasons for loss of tolerance differ, and are usually difficult\nNature Reviews Immunology | Volume 23 | July 2023 | 453\u2013471 458\nto determine. Primary immunodeficiencies and impaired regulatory T\u00a0cell function are rarely clinically obvious65. Despite the shared involvement of innate and adaptive immunity, the nature and distribution of the self-antigen within and outside the kidney explains the spectrum of different subtypes of autoimmune GN. For example, loss of tolerance to IgA or IgG can cause IgA vasculitis (Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura) or cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis, respectively, with highly active polyclonal immune complex GN as a typical classical lesion pattern66\u201368. For reasons still unknown, some individuals release hypoglycosylated IgA from intestinal B cell reservoirs into the blood, where it is handled as an autoantigen, resulting in circulating anti-IgA\u2013IgG immune complexes and IgA nephropathy66. Another form of autoimmune GN involving ubiquitous antigens is lupus nephritis, as commonly occurs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and is characterized by loss of tolerance to chromatin components and other ubiquitous self-antigens69. The various lesion patterns involve polytypic deposits of IgA, IgM, IgG and complement factors C1q and C3, indicating involvement of the classical complement pathway70. Autoimmune vasculitis characterized by ANCAs, specific for the neutrophil antigen myeloperoxidase or proteinase\u00a03, frequently results in severe GN. ANCAs bind to and prime neutrophils71,72. When migrating through the high shear stress glomerular capillary network, neutrophils degranulate and release NETs, which induces complement-driven microvascular endothelial injury12,58,73.\na Endocapillary proliferative GN b Mesangioproliferative GN c Membranoproliferative GN\nHE\nNeutrophils\nIgG4\nC3 IgA C3 IgA \u03ba \u03bb\nIgGFibrinogen\nParietal cell crescent\nTuft compression\nHE Silver\nd Membranous GN\ng (IgA) immune complex GN\ne Crescentic GN f Pauci-immune GN\nh C3GN i Proliferative GN with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits\nFig. 2 | Histopathological lesion patterns common in glomerulonephritis.\nCommon histopathological lesion patterns characteristic of glomerulonephritis (GN) are shown; for example, endocapillary lesions (part a), mesangioproliferative lesions (part b) and membranoproliferative lesions (part c). Immunostaining is routinely performed as one element of immunophenotyping and shows, for example, granular IgG4 positivity along the filtration barrier in a membranous GN (part d), diffuse fibrinogen positivity in necrotizing and crescentic GN (part e) and\na relative lack of immunoglobulins and complement deposition in pauci-immune GN (part f). Mesangial IgA positivity is typical of IgA nephropathy (part g) and complement factor C3 positivity in absence of IgG deposits defines complement factor C3 GN (C3GN) (part h). Staining for \u03ba and \u03bb immunoglobulin chains (part i) helps to distinguish monotypic and polytypic immune deposits. For example, monotypic \u03bb deposits occur in proliferative GN with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits. HE, hematoxylin\u2013eosin.\nNature Reviews Immunology | Volume 23 | July 2023 | 453\u2013471 459\nMoreover, the C5 cleavage product C5a acts as an anaphylatoxin in ANCA\u00a0GN and drives local neutrophil recruitment and inflammation72; hence, C5aR blockade is efficacious in active ANCA\u00a0GN74. Despite its autoimmune nature, ANCA\u00a0GN is misleadingly described as pauciimmune due to minimal antibody and complement deposition in the glomerulus upon standard kidney biopsy assessment58,75.\nC3GN, a GN lesion pattern defined by complement deposits without concomitant immunoglobulin deposits, can be categorized as autoimmune in the presence of circulating autoantibodies known as nephritic factors to C3, C5 or factors\u00a0B and H that lower the physiological threshold for activation of the alternative complement pathway, leading to complement-mediated glomerular injury76\u201378. Autoimmune C3GN, involving all elements of the adaptive immune system in the\nproduction of the causative nephritogenic autoantibody within secondary lymphoid organs, is distinguishable from autoinflammatory C3GN that lacks any involvement of the adaptive immune system and from monoclonal gammopathy-related C3GN caused by an aberrant plasma cell clone or B cell clone in the bone marrow.\nAutoimmune GN involving high-affinity antibodies to the noncollagenous domain of the \u03b13 chain of type\u00a0IV collagen (\u03b13(IV)NC1) presents as rapidly progressive GN with or without pulmonary manifestations (historically known as Goodpasture syndrome), due to the restricted expression of \u03b13(IV) in the GBM and the alveolar basement membrane79.

Indeed, peroxidasin antibodies reduce peroxidasin activity before anti-GBM\u00a0IgG production and the onset of GN, probably by exposing the cryptic B cell \u03b13(IV) NC1 epitope81. In addition, individuals expressing HLA-DR15 serotypes present the immunodominant \u03b13(IV)NC1 peptide in a way that thymic selection results in the generation of conventional \u03b13(IV)NC1 peptide-specific CD4+ T cells that can potentially target self-tissues. However, the same peptide adopts a different structural confirmation when bound to HLA-DR1 and preferentially selects thymus-derived antigen-specific regulatory T cells that dominantly protect from loss of tolerance in mice and in human in vitro assays65.\nFinally, autoimmune GN involving podocytes as the sole target structure induces lesion patterns of either membranous nephropathy (targeting antigens localized at podocyte surfaces) or minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (targeting filtration slit antigen) and has no extrarenal manifestations. Podocytes localize to the outside of glomerular capillaries, a site that is not accessible to intravascular immune cells under normal conditions (Fig.\u00a03), which may limit the effectiveness of peripheral tolerogenic mechanisms. Indeed, a surprising spectrum of antigens are involved in autoimmune podocytopathies, including the podocyte proteins M-type PLA2R82 and thrombospondin type\u00a01 domain-containing protein 7A83, as well as the extrarenal proteins semaphorin 3B19, protocatherin\u00a07 (ref. 84), human high temperature requirement A1 (ref. 85), contactin\u00a01 (ref. 86), netrin G1 (ref. 87) and NEL-like protein\u00a01 (ref. 88) (Table\u00a03). Antibody binding to these antigens at the podocyte\u2013GBM interface is followed by in situ immune complex formation and complement-driven podocyte injury along the outer aspect of the GBM. Autoimmunity to PLA2R is the most common autoimmune podocytopathy, and genome-wide association studies document unusual variants\u00a0at a locus in proximity to the gene encoding PLA2R as a potential factor in the loss of tolerance to this podocyte antigen62. By contrast, autoantibodies binding to components of the slit diaphragm between podocyte foot processes appear as tiny dust-like IgG deposits that are detectable only on frozen sections by confocal microscopy89. As the resulting podocyte foot process effacement is not visible by standard microscopy, this variant of autoimmune GN has been referred to as \u2018minimal change disease\u20198. Indeed, autoimmune podocytopathies are not characterized by immune cell infiltrates due to their antigens being in a relatively immune privileged location to which leukocytes do not have ready access."

In addition, the lectin\ncomplement pathways can be involved91; for example, in membranous GN associated with glomerular deposits of anti-PLA2R IgG4 (ref. 92). In patients with anti-PLA2R GN and genetic deficiency of mannan-binding lectin, activation of the alternative pathway predominates93. Subendothelial immune complex deposits first activate endothelial cells, triggering endocapillary lesions. Entrapment of immune complexes in the mesangium leads to mesangioproliferative or membranoproliferative lesions. These glomerular compartments are also accessible to leukocytes; hence, antagonists of pro-inflammatory chemokines, such as CC-chemokine ligand\u00a02, and their chemokine receptors can attenuate such lesions94.\nThe specialized nature of the glomerular capillaries influences effector T cell functions within the glomerulus. CD4+ T cells migrate within capillaries95, but in healthy conditions or in the early stages of disease they do not extravasate inside the glomerulus. Studies using model antigens have demonstrated that the distribution of the antigen within the glomerulus is an important determinant of the pattern of injury. When the antigen is present on the endothelial side of the GBM (or in the GBM itself), both T helper\u00a01 (TH1) cells and TH17 cells induce antigen-specific endocapillary injury95\u201397. Unusually, in this setting antigens can be presented within glomerular capillaries by intravascular monocytes to effector CD4+ T cells95. Thus, in autoimmune GN and infection-related GN, endocapillary antigens result in proliferative GN that can progress rapidly. When T cells accumulate around the Bowman capsule, the capsule itself serves as a niche for the cells of the glomerular tuft that protects them from cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, at least until there is concurrent significant glomerular endothelial injury98. Kidney-resident memory TH17 cells, generated following infection of the kidney, can be reactivated during subsequent GN by local pro-inflammatory cytokines and can exacerbate GN through the production of IL-17A in an antigen-independent manner99. Incident infections also exacerbate pre-existing GN, for example via circulating pathogen-associated molecular patterns that activate Toll-like receptors and other pattern recognition receptors in macrophage infiltrates, which accelerates glomerular inflammation and injury100,101. Bacterial lipopeptides specifically injure the glomerular filtration apparatus by activating Toll-like receptors\u00a02 and 4 on glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes102."

For example, intestinal-release capsules of the glucocorticoid budesonide limits the release of aberrantly glycosylated IgA from Peyer patches in the intestinal wall of patients with IgA nephropathy and shows less systemic steroid toxicity105.\nPotential targets of immunotherapy for autoimmune GN include cells of the adaptive immune system and molecules involved in antigen presentation and recognition, for example using B cell-directed therapies and co-stimulation blockers, acting primarily inside lymphoid organs (Fig.\u00a04). Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody to B cell activating factor, is approved for the treatment of lupus nephritis, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody to CD20, is approved for the treatment of ANCA\u00a0GN and is also broadly used as a steroid-sparing agent in autoimmune podocytopathies. Other B cell targets are under evaluation (for example, APRIL and TACI). Cathepsin\u00a0S inhibition can attenuate autoimmune GN by suppressing MHC class\u00a0II-mediated CD4+ T cell and B cell priming106. Another group of drugs targets the maturation, activation, proliferation and survival of autoreactive lymphocyte clones; for example, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors, anti-IL-23, anti-IL-17A and anti-CD40 ligand. Calcineurin inhibitors combine the T cell-directed immunosuppressive effect with a stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, which generates strong antiproteinuric effects in addition to suppressing T cell function, for example in lupus nephritis107,108 (Fig.\u00a04). The first reports support the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy directed against CD19+ B cells and of a monoclonal antibody to CD38 (daratumumab) for targeting long-lived plasma cells in lupus nephritis109,110.\nIn addition, overwhelming preclinical evidence supports the role of innate immune pathways in autoimmune GN. For example, mice deficient in Toll-like receptors, complement factors C3, C5 and C5aR, adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory chemokines and their receptors, or TH1-type, TH2-type and TH17-type cytokines are generally protected from immunopathology in GN models111. Therefore, complement inhibitors could possibly replace glucocorticoids for the control of glomerular inflammation. Indeed, the C5aR inhibitor avacopan is now used to minimize steroid use in active ANCA\u00a0GN74, because this anaphylatoxin antagonist can quickly suppress glomerular inflammation and injury. Numerous other antibody-based or small interfering RNA-based complement inhibitors are currently under study (Table\u00a04). By contrast, despite robust preclinical evidence, IFNAR1 blockade failed to control proteinuria in\u00a0active lupus nephritis112."

Glomerulonephritis (GN) comprises a group of immunemediated disorders with the involvement of different innate and adaptive immune pathways in glomerular injury. a, Infection-related GN is triggered by pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that elicit host defence mechanisms, which may affect the kidney in various ways as indicated. Circulating immune complexes (ICs) can become trapped in the mesangium or they can form in situ in the subendothelial space, where they can trigger complement activation. In addition, some pathogens have direct cytopathic effects, precipitating glomerular filtration barrier impairments. b, Autoimmune GN involves loss of tolerance to self-antigens in glomerular cells but frequently also to extrarenal antigens, which localize to the kidney or affect the kidney in other ways. Memory T cells in lymphoid tissues and long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow maintain chronic autoimmunity. Infections can\ntrigger flares of autoimmune GN via a nonspecific activation of autoreactive lymphocyte clones. c, Alloimmune GN can occur following transplantation and is associated with the development of donor-specific antibodies to HLA and non-HLA antigens of the graft and can lead to thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial damage. d, Genetic variants in genes encoding cytokine pathways or regulatory elements of the complement cascade cause autoinflammatory disorders, some of which cause GN. Mechanisms of kidney pathology include spontaneous complement activation in complementopathies and AA amyloid deposits in periodic fever syndromes. e, Monoclonal gammopathy-related GN develops from somatic mutations in B cell clones or plasma cell clones that produce immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin components with nephrotoxic properties. These reach the glomerulus via the circulation.

Some of these autoantigens are cryptic and are released by the obligate ischaemia\u2013reperfusion injury occurring in kidney transplantation. Antibody-mediated mechanisms of injury are often\ncritical in transplant glomerulopathy, but in some circumstances, particularly in the absence of detectable anti-HLA antibodies and glomerular C4d deposition, other cellular effectors (for example, natural killer cells119) participate in injury independently of humoral effectors120.\nOther immunological processes can result in glomerular injury in the transplanted kidney.

Although the immunopathogenesis of GVHD affecting the native kidneys remains unclear, observations in humans and rodent models of GVHD suggest several different patterns of injury and implicate a variety of immune mediators115. Glomerular lesions reported in GVHD include subepithelial deposits representing immune complex deposition or in situ immune complex formation122. However, patterns of injury are variable, reflecting not only the variable participation of immune responses but also the involvement of non-immune mediators or endothelial and mesangial injury. At a molecular level, data from animal models early in GVHD implicate antigen-presenting genes and the T cell chemoattractants CXC-chemokine ligands\u00a09 and 11, with corresponding T cell infiltrates123. In humans, urinary levels of IL-6, IL-15 and CC-chemokine ligand\u00a02 were associated with the risk of developing proteinuric kidney injury after bone marrow transplantation124. Membranous nephropathy, usually autoimmune in nature, can occur after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and antibodies to protocadherin FAT1, as well as the FAT1 protein itself, have been detected in the kidney in this setting125."

Fluids filtered from the blood in the glomerulus are drained into tubules along the Bowman capsule.\nCryoglobulins Autoantibodies (directed against IgG) that form immune complexes and cause small vessel vasculitis. They precipitate at low temperatures, which can be used as a diagnostic test.\nGlomerular filtration barrier A semipermeable membrane\u00a0in nephrons\u00a0that is localized in a vascular network inside the glomerular tuft. The filtration barrier encompasses, from the inside to the outside, the endothelial glycocalyx, glomerular endothelial cells, glomerular basement membrane and visceral epithelial cells (podocytes).\nGlomerulus The corpuscular part of the nephron encompassing the glomerular tuft, which is a capillary network formed by arterioles. Each glomerulus has a single afferent arteriole and a single efferent arteriole entering and leaving the glomerulus at the vascular pole. To direct the filtrate towards the draining tubule, the Bowman capsule surrounds the glomerular tuft and represents the outer border of the glomerulus.\nGlomerulosclerosis Irreversible glomerular scarring leading to waning of filtration. Usually, podocyte loss is the starting point for glomerulosclerosis.\nHaematuria The presence of blood in the urine, a consequence of vascular injury, for example rupture of the glomerular basement membrane in glomerulonephritis, due to complement activation or local release of proteolytic enzymes. Nephritic syndrome is manifested as haematuria and proteinuria, often with hypertension and impaired kidney function, and is a common clinical presentation of glomerulonephritis.\nMesangium A component of the glomerulus formed of smooth muscle cell-like or pericytelike mesenchymal cells in between the glomerular capillary network. Glomerular endothelial cell dysfunction during local or systemic inflammation promotes the passage and entrapment of plasma proteins in the mesangium, which activates or injures mesangial cells.\nNephrons Independent functional units of the kidney. The sum of all nephrons defines kidney function. Nephron number is set at birth and declines with ageing. Injury-related nephron loss induces compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining nephrons to meet the unchanged haemodynamic and metabolic demands. This adaptive capacity differs across species and is much lower in humans than in rodents, which represents a hurdle in translational research.\nNephrotic syndrome Massive loss of plasma proteins into the urine due to diffuse podocyte injury. The clinical definition includes a massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia (urinary losses exceed plasma protein production by the liver), hyperlipidaemia (compensatory increase in lipoprotein production, lipase dysfunction) and oedema (retention of sodium by the diseased kidney). Urinary losses of IgG and coagulation inhibitors can cause life-threatening secondary immunodeficiency and thromboembolism.\nParietal epithelial cells Epithelial cells lining the inner aspect of the Bowman capsule. Parietal cells are usually a relatively quiescent lining, but severe glomerulonephritisrelated leakage of plasma proteins can drive local hyperplasia (as glomerular crescent formation). The parietal epithelial cell monolayer hosts immature progenitors with a dedicated capacity to differentiate and replace lost podocytes on the glomerular tuft.\nPlasma exchange A therapeutic modality used to eliminate circulating pathogenic agents via an extracorporal circulation, separation of plasma proteins (for example, by ultrafiltration of serum proteins or by columns that bind and retain specific proteins) and reinfusion of the remainder.\nPodocytes Cells comprising the epithelial layer on the outside of the glomerular capillaries and gatekeepers of protein selectivity of the glomerular filter. Selective podocyte injury is the central pathological mechanism of \u2018podocytopathies\u2019 presenting as nephrotic syndrome. Podocytopathies can be genetic, immunological, metabolic, monoclonal gammopathy related or shear stress related, presenting as nephrotic syndrome.\nProteinuria Excessive protein in the urine, a urinary biomarker of glomerular dysfunction or podocyte dysfunction when albumin is the predominating urinary protein. Other plasma proteins prevail in tubular or overflow types of proteinuria. Albuminuria is a general biomarker of systemic endothelial dysfunction, for example, in sepsis.\nThrombotic microangiopathy A lesion pattern characterized by immunothrombosis in arterioles, capillaries and venules and frequently caused by humoral or toxic triggers of endothelial injury, including antiphospholipid antibodies or inherited and acquired dysregulation of the complement cascade.\nNature Reviews Immunology | Volume 23 | July 2023 | 453\u2013471 468\nperiodic syndrome, IL-1 blockers for cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndromes130,135, interferon blockers for interferonopathies132 and complement inhibitors for hereditary C3GN77,136."

Monoclonal immunoglobulins deposit as intact immunoglobulin or as fragments, for example in light chain deposition disease or immunoglobulin heavy chain amyloidosis. Such deposits can have various ultrastructural characteristics138. They can be amorphous (in monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease and proliferative GN with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits) or organized, such as \u03b2-sheet amyloid fibrils (in amyloidosis) and microtubules (in immunotactoid glomerulopathy), or can form cryoglobulins (in cryoglobulin-associated GN) and microcrystals (in crystalloglobulin GN). Indirect modes of injury occur when monoclonal immunoglobulins activate complement, resulting in C3GN or thrombotic microangiopathy139,140.\nAlthough a minority of individuals with monoclonal gammopathyrelated GN also have overt multiple myeloma or high-grade lymphoma per se requiring immediate treatment, the source of the monoclonal immunoglobulin in most cases is small B cell clones or plasma cell clones137. These small clones are collectively designated as \u2018monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance\u2019141 and are the result of non-malignant somatic mutations in B cell or plasma cell precursors64. Nevertheless, the nephrotoxic effect of such monoclonal immunoglobulins is the result of the primary amino acid sequence142\u2013144.\nThe monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits detected by immunostaining are the most common and most important pathological histological finding in monoclonal gammopathy-related GN138 (Fig.\u00a02). Monotypic deposits are defined by \u03ba or \u03bb light chain restriction. In cases where the entire immunoglobulin is deposited, a heavy chain restriction (that is, IgG subclass) combined with light chain restriction strongly implies the deposits are monoclonal. Of note, heavy chain restriction by itself does not prove monoclonality unless it relates to a heavy chain disease such as AH amyloidosis or heavy chain deposition disease. Ultrastructural characteristics resolved by electron microscopy can help to distinguish one monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney disease from another (for example, fibrils in amyloidosis or microtubules in immunotactoid GN). Deposits of C3 with little immunoglobulin are seen in C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy. Finally, no immune deposits occur in monoclonal gammopathy-related thrombotic microangiopathy."

Standard immunosuppressive therapies are insufficient to induce a beneficial haematological response, which is usually a greater than 90% reduction in the level of monoclonal immunoglobulin145\u2013147. To accomplish this, clone-directed therapy is required (Table\u00a04). Chemotherapy is used often combined with immunotherapy137,148. For example, CD20expressing B cell clones can be depleted by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, obinutuzumab or ofatuzumab149. These can be used in combination with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. For plasma cell clones, anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab or isatuximab can be used alone or in combination\nwith other targeted therapies (such as cyclophosphamide, proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs148) to achieve the necessary response150\u2013153. High-dose therapy followed by stem cell transplantation is sometimes necessary to achieve a sufficient reduction154.\nProteasome inhibitors are a successful class of drugs against myeloma cells155, with three currently approved (bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib)156 (Fig.\u00a04). They target the 20S unit of the proteasome, inhibiting the ubiquitin degradation pathway for proteins and activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB157. However, as the 20S proteasome is ubiquitously expressed, proteasome inhibition has adverse effects. Immunoproteasomes, on the other hand, are predominantly expressed in lymphocytes and monocytes and are involved in cell-mediated immunity and production of MHC class\u00a0I ligands during infections158. In addition, immunoproteasomes contribute to autoimmune diseases159. Theoretically, inhibition of immunoproteasomes should have fewer off-target side effects. Several immunoproteasome inhibitors have demonstrated promising in vitro results by targeting the large multifunctional peptidase\u00a07 subunit160\u2013162. Some immunoproteasome inhibitors may act synergistically with proteasome inhibitors156,157,163."

            "text": "The growing awareness of the immunopathogenesis of GN has revealed the limitations of lesion-based classifications in identifying the ultimate cause to select appropriate treatments. The recent improvements in immune phenotyping, including the detection of autoantibodies to specific glomerular antigens, different complement subunits and immune complexes by immunofluorescence of kidney biopsies, have increased its value for diagnosis (Box\u00a01). In addition, more immunotherapies are becoming available (Table\u00a04). Extended genetic testing, with next-generation sequencing, is another evolving diagnostic tool to ultimately define a molecular diagnosis (Box\u00a01). Indeed, mutations in complement genes128, in Toll-like receptors131 or in genes of the interferon pathways17 can directly trigger different types of immune-related GN or favour the production of autoantibodies17,128,129,131. Kidney biopsy can in many situations assist in diagnosis and remains the gold standard to determine disease activity and chronicity. Activity and chronicity are relevant parameters in determining treatment intensity, and\u00a0these indices integrate with treatments targeting non-immune mechanisms of chronic kidney disease progression. Novel urinary biomarkers of immunological GN activity can be used to monitor treatment responses and be validated against repeated kidney biopsies.\nAn intuitive pathophysiology-based classification will facilitate the management of these conditions. We propose that individuals with GN be described under three headings: firstly, as having one of the five types of GN discussed in this Review (infection-related GN, autoimmune GN, alloimmune GN, autoinflammatory GN and monoclonal gammopathy-related GN); secondly, by detailing the exact disease type on the basis of the pathogenesis; and, thirdly, on the basis of the features of the histological lesion, if a kidney biopsy has been performed.\nDespite the challenges in defining the pathogenesis of the large number of individual GN diseases, there has been significant progress in understanding the fundamental basis of immune glomerular disease. However, our understanding of GN is incomplete and requires greater depth if we are to develop more targeted immunotherapies. Among the infection-related GN disorders, the contribution of genetic susceptibilities in primary immunodeficiency and acquired complementopathies (genetic or acquired disorders of the complement system) driving clinically relevant GN deserves further study. The plethora of novel autoantigens in autoimmune GN mandates further investigation, not only\nNature Reviews Immunology | Volume 23 | July 2023 | 453\u2013471 469\nto ensure accurate diagnostic tests are clinically available but also to determine the role of the related autoantibodies as biomarkers for diagnosis, disease activity and guidance of immunotherapy. In particular, the recently discovered anti-nephrin antibody-related podocytopathy is likely to have significant clinical implications89. Why alloimmune GN responds poorly to immunotherapy is not well understood. Prevention of priming of donor-specific antibodies early after transplantation is probably the key to preventing transplant glomerulopathy. Among autoinflammatory GN disorders, genotype\u2013phenotype associations of the hereditary complementopathies encompass many unsolved questions. The wide spectrum of monoclonal gammopathy-related GN will benefit from plasma cell-targeted therapies under development.\nGN requires an immunopathophysiology-based classification system to better connect with the growing number of available immunotherapy drugs. As GN comprises immune-mediated disorders, GN research needs more input from experts in immunology. Indeed, clinical immunologists may help to overcome traditional lesion-based concepts in this domain and improve the management of these important and at times difficult to treat diseases."
