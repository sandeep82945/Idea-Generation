After a brief historic overview\nof the major scientific achievements using these methods, we will focus on the covariant and\ndi erential geometric formalism originally proposed by Vilkovisky and DeWitt (VDW). We\ndiscuss recent developments made in addressing the uniqueness of the path-integral measure of the\nVDW e ective action, and so address the problem of quantum frame dependence in cosmologically\nrelevant scalar-tensor theories beyond the classical approximation. Particular attention will be\ndrawn to a long-standing problem concerning the obstacles that the VDW formalism was facing\nfrom its original conception in describing generic QFTs that include fermions. We show how\nin addition to bosons the VDW e ective action can be extended to supermanifolds to include\nfermions. The so-extended formulation appears to be very promising for a complete geometrisation\nof realistic theories of micro-cosmos, such as the Standard Model and its gravitational sector.\nCorfu Summer Institute 2021 \"School and Workshops on Elementary Particle Physics and Gravity\" 29 August - 9 October 2021 Corfu, Greece\n\u21e4Speaker\n\u00a9 Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). https://pos.sissa.it/\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0"

We only have to look at General Relativity, which did away with the mysterious action at a distance for which by Newton famously \u201co ered no explanations\", and instead explained gravitation purely as a the result of geometry of the spacetime manifold [1]. Indeed, geometry seems to hold a certain allure, since, even in antiquity, many numerous proto-scientific or philosophical attempts were made to explain the machinery of the cosmos. Pythagorean philosophers, inspired by their idea of the Monad, viewed the universe as a unit in which all heavenly bodies move in perfect circles around the Eternal Fire, sometimes identified as the Sun itself [2]. While the Pythagorean model arose from ideas of aesthetics rather than observation, it was an early example of geometry driving the development of models of the universe.\nThe principle that the cosmos could be explained through the lens of geometry was central to the debate between geocentrism and heliocentrism. The geocentric model, originally conceived by Anaximander in the 6th century BC and later advocated by Plato in the 4th century BC, was in no small part influenced by the ever-pervasive belief that humanity has a special place in the universe. However, it had to be \u201cpatched up\u201d multiple times when it was found incompatible with observations, in particular retrograde motion. Secondary trajectories such as deferents and epicycles were suggested by Apollonius and Hipparcus in the 2nd century, but these were still incompatible with the non-uniform retrograde motions of the planets. Inspired further by geometry still, Ptolemy soon finally suggested a point outside of Earth, the equant, around which the motions of the planets were uniform, finally leading to an agreement with observations [3].\nHeliocentrism, as put forward by Aristarchus and Seleucus in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, was considerably more elegant than the Ptolemaic model, but did not gain much traction, since it did not conform to Aristotelian philosophy. The latter postulated that the Earth (made as it is by the heaviest element) should sit at the centre of the cosmos, surrounded by layers of water, air, fire, and finally aether (in the form of other planets) [4]. The Copernican revolution that occurred in the 16th century AD, sparked a wave of renewed interest in heliocentric models, something that came to be heavily frowned upon by the Church. Tycho Brahe attempted to reconcile scripture and the heliocentric model by suggesting that the Earth is orbited by the Mercury, Venus, and the Sun, which is orbited by the rest of the planets [5]. Eventually, thanks to the observations of Kepler and Galileo soon after Copernicus proposed his model, heliocentrism superseded geocentrism as the dominant cosmological model, supported theoretically by Newton\u2019s law of universal attraction.\nAs the study of geometry progressed, it became clear that there was an unspoken assumption that permeated the debate between geocentrism and heliocentrism. This was the idea of an absolute frame of reference, expressed both in geocentrism (implicitly viewing the Earth as the true centre of the Universe) and heliocentrism (Copernicus\u2019 immobile sphere of stars). The existence of an absolute frame of reference is compatible with the notion of absolute motion, as well as the existence of an immobile, permeable medium such as the luminiferous aether. However, even before the \u201caether crisis\u201d kickstarted by the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment [6] and the subsequent development of the theory of relativity, the notion of absolute frames was challenged on theoretical grounds by thinkers such as Leibniz, Berkeley, and Mach. It was not long before special and general relativity made it clear that by geometrizing the force of gravity, there is no way to elevate one frame\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nof reference above all others.\nThe idea that no frame is special is now a core tenet of scientific inquiry. Indeed, this notion can be gleaned by observing that the Tychonic model and the Copernican model are equivalent; no observation can be made to distinguish them [7]. Essentially, they describe the same physical setup in di erent frames. Despite this, a frame problem has persisted in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and Quantum Gravity since the 20th century. A single QFT can be described in multiple, classically equivalent ways, yet there has been considerable debate [8\u201329] as to whether such descriptions maintain their equivalence once the theory gets quantized. As discussions about which the preferred frame should be abound in the literature, we take inspiration from geometry in the same way that lead to the development of Einstein\u2019s General Relativity, and move towards a covariant description of frames in QFT that includes fermions.\nThe structure of these proceedings is as follows: in Section 2 we review the issue of conformal frames in QFT and in particular the dichotomy between the so called Einstein and Jordan frames for scalar-tensor theories of gravity. We show explicitly how to write a frame-invariant metric of spacetime leading to frame invariance of the classical action. Using the frame invariant metric and field-space covariance techniques, we derive an expression for the e ective action that is both frame and reparametrization invariant in Section 3. In Section 4, we review how to include Grassmannian coordinates in a manifold giving rise to a supermanifold. We then examine some basic properties and operations applied to supermanifolds such as supertransposition, supertrace, etc. In Section 5, we present how to employ the language of supermanifolds to define a field-space for theories with fermionic degrees of freedom. We discuss how to define field-space tensors on the supermanifold and highlight what properties should be satisfied by the field-space metric. We then describe how the metric can be obtained and calculate it explicitly for a theory with one scalar field and one Dirac fermion in Appendix A. In Section 6, we apply the covariant methods of the supermanifolds to the Vilkovisky-DeWitt (VDW) e ective action so as to obtain an expression for the e ective action that is fully reparametrization invariant. Our findings are then summarised in Section 7."

            "text": "Covariant methods have been used in QFT [30\u201343] and Quantum Gravity through the works of Vilkovisky and DeWitt [44\u201349]. In particular, the VDW e ective action may solve a number of problems that would require knowledge of the o -shell dynamics of a quantum system, which are highly frame dependent in the configuration space. In particular, problems of great interest and importance are as follows: (i) the gauge-independent definition of e ective charges in non-Abelian gauge theories [50\u201353]; (ii) the gauge-invariant description of unstable particle dynamics within the context of (-matrix theory [54\u201356]; (iii) the proper field-reparameterization invariant definition of electroweak precision observables, including Veltman\u2019s electroweak parameter [57]; (iv) the unique field-reparameterization invariant expansions of e ective field theories such as Standard Model E ective Field Theory (SMEFT) [58, 59]; and (v) a frame covariant description of cosmological inflation in models with multiple scalar fields that may act as inflatons [28, 29, 60\u201364].\nHowever, these methods were limited in their scope in the sense that they did not deal with the cosmological frame issue, and they did not include fermionic fields. Before we present our\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nformalism that incorporates these desirable features, it is important to provide some background information on the topic. A frame in QFT (and classical theory) is simply a specific representation of the action of a theory. The two most prominent frames are the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame. In the Jordan frame, there exists a non-minimal coupling between the field and the scalar curvature, whereas in the Einstein frame, this non-minimal coupling is removed through a judicious reparametrization of the fields, including the metric. We will consider a scalar-tensor theory [65\u201371] (that can later be quantized) with a spin-2 graviton field 6`a and a set of scalar fields i (collectively denoted as >) with an action of the form\n(JF [6`a , >] = \u03c0 3\u21e1G p 6  5 (>)\n2 ' + : \u232b 2 (>)6`am`i mai\u232b + (>) . (1)\nThe above action is in the Jordan frame, whereas the following action is in the Einstein frame:\n(EF [6\u0303`a , >\u0303] = \u03c0 3\u21e1G p 6\u0303 \" \"2% 2 '\u0303 + 1 2 :\u0303 \u232b (>\u0303)6\u0303`am` i\u0303 ma i\u0303\u232b + (>\u0303) # , (2)\nwhere 6 \u2318 det(6`a) and the model functions 5 (>), : \u232b (>),+ (>) are the e ective Planck mass, the scalar field-space metric and the potential respectively. These two actions are linked together by a conformal transformation (field-dependent scaling of the metric) and a field reparametrization (a field-depending rescaling of the fields themselves) [64]. The classical equivalence between di erent frames can be seen from the observation that (JF [6`a , >] = (EF [6\u0303`a , >\u0303], which indicates that the two actions are physically equivalent, in the sense that calculating their observables yields the same results. The frame problem then essentially amounts to the following question: \u201cUpon quantization, do the Jordan- and the Einstein-frame actions yield the same observables?\u201d In order to probe this question at the most fundamental level, it is wise to turn to the e ective action formalism, which can be used to derive an action [6`a , >] that incorporates all quantum corrections to the classical action. Which action we use to determine the e ective action may return di erent results. Indeed, it was found that JF [6`a , >] < EF [6`a , >] except at extremal points. This is not an issue at first glance, since observable quantities are calculated at the extrema of the action. However, both for the sake of having a covariant approach in which a particular frame is not privileged above all others, and in order to ensure that o -shell formulations of QFT do not su er from frame issues, it is certainly desirable to find a formulation which resolves this issue. We turn our attention to the Jordan frame scalar-tensor action (1). This class of actions is described by three model functions: the non-minimal coupling 5 (>), the non-canonical kinetic term : \u232b (>), and the potential + (>). From a physical point of view, we can examine two possible transformations that essentially amount to a relabelling of variables, and should therefore not have any physical e ect on the action itself:\n1. Spacetime di eomorphisms which consist of changing the coordinates on spacetime:\nG` ! G\u0303` = G\u0303` (Ga) , (3)\nwith invariant line elements\n3B2 = 6`a3G`3Ga = e6`a3G\u0303`3G\u0303a . (4)\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\n2. Field reparametrizations like conformal transformations and scalar field reparametrization:\n6`a ! e6`a = e6`a (6^_, >) = \u23262(>)6`a , q ! ei = ei 6`a , > = ei (>). (5)\nThe action is indeed invariant under a field reparametrization if care is taken to appropriately transform all model functions, whose transformation rules are given by [64]:\n5 (>) ! 5\u0303 (>) = \u2326 2 5 (i), + (>) ! e+ (>) = \u2326 4+ (i),\n: \u232b (>) ! :\u0303 e e\u232b (>) = \u21e5 : \u232b 6 5 (ln\u2326), (ln\u2326),\u232b + 3 5, (ln\u2326),\u232b + 3(ln\u2326), 5,\u232b \u21e4 m ie m\u232bie\u232b.\n(6) However, the line element 3B2 is not invariant under a conformal transformation, since it transforms as\n3B2 ! 3B\u03032 = \u232623B2. (7)\nIn a gravitational theory where 6`a is considered a dynamical field rather than the spacetime metric, this violates the invariance of the action. To rectify this, we introduce a new model function \u2713(>) which transforms as [72]\n\u2713\u0303(>) = \u2326 \u2713(>), (8)\nand use it to define a frame-invariant metric through\n6\u0304`a \u2318 6`a/\u27132(>). (9)\nThis metric can be used to calculate a spacetime line element that is both frame- and di eomorphisminvariant:\n3B\u03042 = 6\u0304`a3G`3Ga . (10)\nThe strength of our approach incorporating this new function, compared to similar approaches in the literature [15, 73\u201375], is that when scaling the metric in (9), no particular functional form of \u2713(>) is specified a priori. This implies that there is no \u201cpreferred frame\", which in turn is vital in constructing an e ective action that is unique and reparametrization invariant. In this approach, \u2713 appears in the functional measure of the path integral and thus acquires the physical role of an e ective Planck length, leading to complete frame invariance of the classical action S:\n( h 6\u0303`a , ei; \u2713\u0303(i), 5\u0303 (i), :\u0303 (i), e+ (i)i = ( \u21e56`a , i; \u2713(i), 5 (i), : (i),+ (i)\u21e4 . (11)\nMoreover, at tree level we have\n( = \u03c0 3\u21e1G p 6L = \u03c0 3\u21e1G p 6\u0304 L (12)\nwhich is independent of \u2713(>). In (12) we have defined the rescaled Lagrangian\nL = \u2713\u21e1L, (13)\nwhich is invariant under frame transformations (5) and spacetime di eomorphism (3).\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0"

            "text": "So far, we have focused on the topic of conformal frames in QFT. It is now time to examine more deeply how a QFT that includes gravity as a dynamical field can be geometrised. The Vilkovisky\u2013 DeWitt approach, using the tools of di erential geometry, casts the configuration space of QFT in terms of a manifold equipped with a metric and all that this implies: intrinsic curvature, parallel transport, geodesic deviation, and so on. Unlike General Relativity, this metric is determined by the model parameters of the theory; it is not dynamically determined like the spacetime metric is through Einstein\u2019s equations [1]. We examine the action (1) with the understanding that 6`a is a dynamical field. We therefore define an augmented field-space manifold that incorporates both the scalar fields q and the gravitational tensor field 6`a [23, 76]. General coordinates in this manifold are denoted by\n=\n6`a\nq\n! , (14)\nwhere = {`a, }. Reparametrizations of the fields are then just di eomorphisms\n= e ( ) (15) of what we call the grand field space.\nWe must now define the metric in a unique way using the Lagrangian L:\n\u2327 \u232b \u2318 6`a \u21e1 m2L m\nm`q m maq\u232b , (16) where L must also include the usual gauge-fixing terms. Using (16) on the action (1) in the absence of matter fields along with the gauge-fixing terms yields the following expression for the gravitational field space metric\n\u2327 (`a) (df) = 1 2 6`d6fa + 6`f6da U6`a6df , (17)\nwhere U = U(j`, W) is a constant that depends on the gauge fixing condition j` and the constant W. The notation (`a) implies that no order is specified for the spacetime indices ` and a. To fix the constant U, the chosen gauge fixing condition is\n\u2327 (`a) (df) = 6U`6Va6^d6_f\u2327 (UV) (^_) , (18)\nwhich in turn implies that U = 0, 1 in four dimensions. Choosing U = 1 yields Vilkovisky\u2019s metric for gravity %`adf = \u2327 (`a) (df) {U = 1} [46].\nWe now promote the field space to a configuration space. This takes into account the spacetime dependence of the fields, which means that the general set of coordinates is now given by\n8 \u2318 (G ) = 6`a (G) q (G )\n! , (19)\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nwith 8 = { , G } and G = {G, G }. In what follows we will employ Eistein-DeWitt notation q0 \u2318 q (G ), and where repeated configuration space indices imply summation over discrete field space indices and integration over spacetime.\nThe standard definition of the e ective action [>] can be implicitly written as follows:\nexp \u2713 8\n\\ [>]\n\u25c6 = \u03c0 [D5] exp \u21e2 8\n\\\nh ([5] + X [>]\nXi0 (i0 q0)\ni , (20)\nwhere i0 denotes now the classical field. The impetus for the development of the Vilkovisky\u2013 DeWitt formalism was the observation that this expression for the e ective action does not act as a scalar under field reparametrizations because of the explicit presence of the fields i0, which are not covariant (just like G` is not a covariant quantity in GR). Incorporating our model parameter \u2713(>), we modify the functional derivative such that it takes into account conformal transformations through the definition of the frame-invariant (in addition to di eomorphism-invariant as usual) delta function:\nX\u0304 (\u21e1) (G) \u2318 \u2713\u21e1X (\u21e1) (G). (21)\nThis definition can be used to write down a fully invariant definition of the functional determinant det as well; this is instrumental in ensuring that the functional measure is invariant as well. Using these frame-invariant ingredients, we may define the grand configuration-space metric for the general theory (1) to be\nG8 9 = \u27132\n5 %`adf 34 5,\u232b6`a 34 5, 6df : \u232b\n!

We can also ensure that the path\nintegral volume element + [D ] q det G8 9 is invariant, as desired. To this end, one includes the gauge fixing j` ( ) in a reparametrization invariant manner, as well as the Faddeev-Poppov determinant [77]\n+FP = det \u2713 X\u0304j` (x) X\u0304ba (y) \u25c6 (23)\nin the path integral measure, with b` being the gauge parameters, The di eomorphism and frame invariant e ective action then reads\nexp \u2713 8\n\\ [>]\n\u25c6 = \u03c0 [D ]M[ ] exp \u21e2 8\n\\\n ([ ] + X\u0304 [>]\nX\u0304i8 \u23038 [>, ] , (24)\nwhere > = (6`a , q) and the modified functional derivative has been defined using the frameinvariant delta function (21). The path integral measure is in (24) is given by\nM[ ] = +FP q det G8 9 . (25)\nEquation (24) is the standard VDW expression for the covariant e ective action where now the integral measure and functional derivatives have been written in a frame invariant way using (21) and (23).\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nNote that the configuration space vector \u23030 [>, ] that has replaced the non-covariant term (i0 q0) is related to the geodesic tangent vector f0 [>, ] by [47]\n\u23030 [>, ] = \u21e3 \u21e0 1 [>] \u23180 1 f 1 [>, ] (26)\nwhere the coe cient\u21e001 [>] = hr1f0 [>, ]i\u2303 ensures that tadpoles evaluate to zero. The e ective action defined in this way satisfies the important property [72]\n[>; \u2713(q), 5 (q), : \u232b (q),+ (q)] = \u21e5 i\u0303(i); \u2713\u0303(q), 5\u0303 (q), :\u0303 \u232b (q), +\u0303 (q) \u21e4 , (27)\nwhere the transformations of the field and model functions are given by (6), (8) and (15). Thus, by construction, is manifestly frame invariant. In particular, the functional form of does not change under transformations of the fields and model functions. We can expand the e ective action perturbatively as [>] = \u00d5;=0 \\; (;) [>] and compute it explicitly order by order using the background field method [78, 79]. Expanding the action covariantly as\n( [ + >] = ([>] + \u2019 #=1 1 #!

Note that the expressions for the one- and two-loop e ective action in (30) and (31) are consistent with [80]. This concludes our treatment of bosonic fields. However, defining a field-space for fermions and equipping it with a unique metric has been an outstanding problem. This is going to be the focus of the following sections."

Supermanifolds are the natural extension of a Riemannian manifold when Grassman valued coordinates are included [81\u201386] and their construction follows closely the standard prescription of di erential geometry. While the topic is vast and mathematically intricate [87, 88], in this section we limit ourselves to review only those basic properties that play a direct role in the construction of a fermionic field space.\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nLet us start setting the notation by considering a supermanifold with = commuting coordinates and < anti-commuting coordinates. General coordinates in the supermanifold chart are denoted with the use of Greek letters superscripts as GU, U = (1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , = + <). When performing a di eomorphism in the presence of anti-commuting coordinates\nGU ! G\u0303U = G\u0303U (x), (32)\none needs to distinguish between left and right di erentiation. The two operations are related by\n! m\nmGU G\u0303V = ( 1)U(V+1) G\u0303V\nm\nmGU . (33)\nwhere we have introduced a notation convention that will be employed for the rest of the paper. Each symbol in an exponent of ( 1) is not meant to be taken literally but as a label taking the value of 1 for anticommuting quantities and 0 for commuting quantities. Hence, (33) tells us that right and left derivative di er only when di erentiating a commuting object with respect to a anticommuting coordinate. In line with this new convention, indices can be contracted in a straightforward way only when adjacent and factors of ( 1) have to be introduced otherwise and every time the position of two indices is switched, e.g. GU VG = ( 1)UVVG GU. The expressions in (33) are defined to be the left and right Jacobians:\nU V =\n! m\nmGU G\u0303V \u2318 !Um G\u0303V , V sTU = V G\u0303 m mGU \u2318 V G\u0303 mU.

This operation is defined di erently for each possible index placement:\nU\" V sT = ( 1)U(V+1) V\"U, U\" sTV = ( 1)V (U+1) V\"U,\nU\" sT V = ( 1)U+V+UV V\"U, U\"V sT = ( 1)UV V\"U,\n(36)\nleading to four di erent types of supermatrices. For a supermatrix with both indices in the upper position, U\"V , or with both indices in the lower position, U\"V , we introduce the notion of sypersymmetricity if \"sT = \" and anti-sypersymmetricity if \"sT = \" .\nFor supermatrices with one index in the upper position and one in the lower position, i.e. U\"V or U\"V , we can also introduce the operation of supertrace:\nstr (U\"V) = ( 1)U U\"U = \"U U, str (U\"V) = ( 1)U U\"U = ( 1)U \"U U. (37)\nThe operation of supertrace produces superscalars, i.e. quantities invariant under the transformations listed in (35) and (36). Notice that str (U\"V) = str (U\"V) due to the cyclicity of the supertrace.\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nThe last operation to introduce is that of superdeterminant [82] which is defined for each type of supermatrix in (36). A general supermatrix has the form\nU\"V =\n\u232b \u21e0 \u21e1\u232b \u232b\n! , (38)\nwhere \u232b and \u232b are =\u21e5= and <\u21e5< matrices of commuting numbers, respectively and \u21e0 and \u21e1\u232b are = \u21e5< and < \u21e5 = matrices of anticommuting numbers, respectively.

(39)\nTaking the superdeterminant of a supermatrix allows one to write an integral measure that is invariant under di eomorphisms (32) of the supermanifold [82]:\np |sdet(\") |3=+<G. (40)\nLastly, a supermanifold is Riemannian if endowed with a real rank-2 tensor field U\u2327V known as the metric. The supermanifold metric has to be supersymmetric and non-singular [87]. The inverse metric U\u2327V , defined from the identity U\u2327W \u2327WV = UXV , satisfies\nU\u2327V = \u2327UV = ( 1)UV \u2327VU.

The metric should be determined solely and uniquely from the action;\n2. The metric should be a supersymmetric rank-2 field-space tensor;\n3. The metric should not be singular in order to produce a non-zero line element;\n4. The metric should be ultralocal, i.e. it should not depend on derivatives of the fields;\n5. The metric should have the local form on each point of the field-space supermanifold [87, 89]:\n0 1 \u2318 \u00a9\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260 \u00b4 1# 0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 14 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 14 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0 14 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 14 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ... ... ... ... ... . . . \u2122\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6\u00c6 \u00a8 . (54)\nThe matrix U\u21e41 is non-singular but it is not supersymmetric and therefore cannot be used as the field-space metric. To find a suitable metric for the field-space that satisfies the requirements listed above we will make use of the vielbein formalism [90]. In a local inertial frame we expect the fields to be locally canonical [91] with kinetic terms as in (50) and 0\u21e41 = 0#1. Thus we can write\nU\u21e4V = U40 0#1 14sTV , (55)\nwhere U40 are the vielbeins and 0#1 is as defined in (53). Once the vielbeins are found from (55), the field-space metric U\u2327V can be obtained as [89]\nU\u2327V = U40 0 1 14sTV , (56)\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 8 0\nwhere 0 1 is the local metric defined in (54). Once the metric is determined from (56), one can then define the Christo el symbols as\nUVW = 1 2\nU\u2327 X h X\u2327V mW + ( 1)VW X\u2327W mV ( 1)V ! Xm V\u2327W i , (57)\nand from this covariant derivatives on the field-space\n-U r V = -U mV + UVW-W ,\n-U r V = -U mV -W WUV .\n(58)\nThe field-space Riemann tensor is then defined as\n'UVWX = h UVW mX + ( 1)WX UVX mW + ( 1)W (f+V) UfW fVX ( 1) X (f+V+W) UfX fVW i .\n(59) Promoting the field-space to a configuration-space is now straightforward. Coordinates in configurationspace are denoted by bU \u2318 U (xU) , (60) and the definition of the metric and metric connections are generalised as\nbU\u2327 bV = U\u2327V X (4) xU xV , (61)\nand bU bVbW = U VW X (4) xU xV X (4) xU xW . (62)\nMaking use of the metric (61), the configuration space line element is defined as D\u23032 = 3 bU bU\u2327 bV ( ) 3 bV . (63) Notice that (63) is written in terms of fully contracted configuration space tensors and is therefore a superscalar. Finally, the reparametrization invariant integral measure needed to construct a covariant path integral reads\n[DM] = p | sdet\u2327 | \u21e5 D#+8\" @ \u21e4 , (64)\nwhere now @ denotes collectively the bU coordinates on the configuration-space as defined through (60)."

The inverse bUbV , defined through bUbW bW(bV = bUXbV , is the frame-covariant propagator. It is easy to show that the propagator and its inverse are both supersymmetric. The notation {. . .} denotes the operation of supersymmetrization of the indices enclosed [89]:\n{U1 . . . U2} = 1 =! \u2019 % ( 1)%%[U1 . . . U2], (69)\nwhere % spans over all possible permutations of the = indices and the factor ( 1)% yields 1 for odd number of swaps between fermionic indices and 0 otherwise. Note that both (67) and (68) are superscalars as one would expect. The presence of the pre-factor ( 1) in the second term of (68) does not spoil covariance but is consistent with the convention that only adjacent pairs of indices can be contracted straightforwardly as explained in Section 4. The one- and two-loop e ective action results in (67) and (68) reduce to (30) and (31) in the absence of fermionic variables."

We have constructed the field-space supermanifold for scalar-fermion theories and developed a rigorous algorithm for calculating the field-space metric from the classical action by means of vielbeins. We have extended the VDW formalism on Supermanifolds and obtained an expression for the quantum e ective action for theories with fermions that is both frame- and reparametrization-invariant. Since the VDW formalism has already been successfully applied to scalar theories, gauge theories and gravity, the inclusion of fermions was the last milestone for a complete geometrisation of a broad spectrum of QFTs. The natural next step would be to construct a field-space supermanifold for realistic theories of high energy physics such as the Standard Model. We postpone this task to future work."

The presence of the arbitrary matrix G reflects that the vielbeins are not determined uniquely by the condition (55).

With the metric (73), one can now calculate the metric connection components according to (57). Using these to compute the Riemann tensor according to (59), yields 'UVWX = 0, i.e. the field-space for this theory is everywhere flat.
