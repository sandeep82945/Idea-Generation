This paper studies a set of postulates, appropriate for a priori voting power, concerning blockers (or vetoers) in a binary voting game. We specify and motivate five such postulates, namely, two subadditivity blocker postulates, two minimumpower blocker postulates, each in weak and strong versions, and the added-blocker postulate. We then test whether three measures of voting power, namely the classic Penrose-Banzhaf measure, the classic Shapley-Shubik index, and the newly proposed Recursive Measure, satisfy these postulates. We find that the first measure fails four of the postulates, the second fails two, while the third alone satisfies all five postulates. This work consequently adds to the plausibility of the Recursive Measure as a reasonable measure of voting power.",

Numerous postulates have been defended in the voting-power literature: most are for a priori voting power (i.e., voting power solely in virtue of the formal voting structure itself, constituted by the agenda of potential outcomes, the sets of actors, their action profiles, and the decision function mapping vote configurations onto outcomes), while others are for a posteriori voting power (i.e., voting power also in virtue of the distribution of preferences, and consequent incentives for strategic interaction, within the voting structure) (Felsenthal and Machover 1998; Laruelle and Valenciano 2005a).\nThis paper studies a set of postulates, appropriate for a priori voting power, concerning blockers (or vetoers) in a binary voting game. Our aim is two-fold. First, to specify and motivate five postulates concerning blockers, namely, two subadditivity blocker postulates, two minimum-power blocker postulates, each in weak and strong versions, and the added-blocker postulate. Second, to test whether three measures of voting power, namely the classic Penrose-Banzhaf measure (PB), the\n\u2217Department of Political Science, McGill University: arash.abizadeh@mcgill.ca \u2020Department of Mathematics & Statistics and School of Computer Science, McGill University:\nadrian.vetta@mcgill.ca\nclassic Shapley-Shubik index (SS), and the newly proposed Recursive Measure (RM), satisfy these postulates. We find that PB fails the first four postulates, SS fails the strong subadditivity blocker postulate and the added-blocker postulate, while RM alone satisfies all five postulates. Further, it is already known (Abizadeh and Vetta 2021) that RM satisfies a plethora of other reasonable postulates, including the iso-invariance, dummy, dominance, donation, minimum-power bloc, and quarrel postulates. This work consequently adds to the plausibility of RM as a reasonable measure of voting power."

Denote by [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} a nonempty, finite set of players with z = 2 strategies, voting yes or voting no. Let O={yes, no} be the set of alternative outcomes. A division or complete vote configuration S = (S, S\u0304) of the set [n] is an ordered partition of players where the first element in the ordered pair is the set of yes-voters and the second element is the set of no-voters in S. Thus, for S = (S, S\u0304), the subset S \u2286 [n] comprises the set of yes-voters and the subset S\u0304 = [n] \\ S comprises the set of no-voters. Note the convention of representing a bipartitioned division by its first element in blackboard bold.\nLet D be the set of all logically possible divisions S of [n]. A binary voting game, in which each player has two possible strategies, is a function G(S) mapping the set of all possible divisions D to the two outcomes in O. A monotonic binary voting game is one satisfying the condition:\n(i) Monotonicity. If G(S)=yes and S \u2286 T , then G(T)=yes.\nA SVG is a monotonic binary voting game that also satisfies non-triviality:\n(ii) Non-Triviality. \u2203S | G(S)=yes and \u2203T | G(T)=no.\nMonotonicity and non-triviality jointly ensure that SVGs also have the following property:\n(iii) Unanimity. G((\u2205, [n]))=no and G(([n], \u2205))=yes.\nNote that unanimity itself implies non-triviality. Thus conditions (i) and (iii) also characterize the class of SVGs.\nCall any player whose vote corresponds to the division outcome a successful player. Let W be the collection of all sets of players S such that G(S)=yes (that is, if each member of S were to vote yes, they would be successful yes-voters). We call this the collection of yes-successful subsets of [n], also commonly called winning coalitions. We can now alternatively characterize conditions (i)-(iii) as:\n(i) Monotonicity. If S \u2208 W and S \u2286 T then T \u2208 W. (ii) Non-Triviality. \u2203S| S \u2208 W and \u2203T | T /\u2208 W (iii) Unanimity. [n] \u2208 W and \u2205 /\u2208 W.\nIn the discussion and proofs that follow, as is standard in the voting-power literature, we assume that our voting games are SVGs."

The defining characteristic of a given measure of voting power is therefore its specification of a player\u2019s division efficacy score for each division and each division\u2019s weight. We shall label the a priori voting power of a player according to a measure \u03a8, i.e., in abstraction from any information about the distribution of preferences, using the lower case \u03c8.\nBefore proceeding, we introduce one further set of concepts. Let a player i\u2019s yes-efficacy score \u03b1+i be equal to \u03b1i in divisions in which i votes yes, equal to 0 otherwise; and i\u2019s no-efficacy score \u03b1\u2212i be equal to \u03b1i in divisions in which i votes no, equal to 0 otherwise. We say that a player\u2019s yes-voting power \u03a8+ sums over its weighted yes-efficacy scores, and its no-voting power \u03a8\u2212 sums over its weighted no-efficacy scores. That is, for SVGs,\n\u03a8+i = \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1+i (S) \u00b7 \u03b3(S) \u03a8 \u2212 i =\n\u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1\u2212i (S) \u00b7 \u03b3(S) \u03a8i = \u03a8 + i +\u03a8 \u2212 i\nWe may now present the three aforementioned measures of voting power."

            "text": "The Penrose-Banzhaf (PB) measure bases a voter\u2019s division efficacy score \u03b1i(S) on being decisive, i.e., being in a position in which one could have effected a different outcome by (unilaterally) voting differently than one did in a given division. The concept can be formalized for SVGs as follows: a player i is yes-decisive in division S if and only if i \u2208 S \u2208 W but S \\ {i} /\u2208 W; is no-decisive if and only if i /\u2208 S /\u2208 W but S \u222a {i} \u2208 W; and is decisive if and only if it is either yes-decisive or no-decisive. PB, which was originally conceived as a measure of a priori voting power, then equates a player\u2019s voting power with the proportion of logically possible divisions in which it is decisive.\nThis, in turn, is typically taken to represent the ex ante probability that a player i will be decisive in a voting structure, under the assumptions of voting independence (votes are not correlated) and equiprobable voting (the probability a player votes for one alternative equals the probability it votes for any other), which together imply equiprobable divisions \u2013 which assumptions model the a prioristic abstraction from voter preferences.\nIn particular, PB is defined by specifying a voter\u2019s division efficacy score as\n\u03b1PBi (S) =\n{\n1 if i is decisive in S\n0 otherwise\nA division\u2019s weight \u03b3(S), in turn, is typically interpreted in the Penrose-Banzhaff model as S\u2019s ex ante probability. In the general, a posteriori case, a division\u2019s probability P(S) would be a function of the actual distribution of voter preferences; but a division\u2019s probability p(S) in the a priori case (which we represent again using the lower case) assumes equiprobable divisions. For binary voting games (z = 2), this yields:\n\u03b3PB(S) = p(S) = 1\n|D| =\n1\nzn =\n1\n2n\nNotice that, because PB calculates a voter\u2019s division efficacy score strictly on the basis of whether the voter is decisive in that division, its efficacy scores are what we shall call strategy symmetric, that is, a player\u2019s efficacy score in a given division is equal to its efficacy score in any other division that is identical to it but for the player\u2019s own vote. In the case of SVGs, where z = 2, this is because for every division in which the voter is yes-decisive there is precisely one corresponding division in which the voter is no-decisive (involving the two divisions that are identical except for the vote of the player in question). It follows that in SVGs the number of divisions in which the player plays a given strategy and is decisive equals the number of divisions in which it plays any other strategy and is decisive. Strategy symmetry implies that PB+i = PB \u2212 i .\nIt follows that PB can be calculated via a shortcut PB\u2217, on the basis of solely yes-decisiveness (indeed, PB is typically defined in this way in the literature), setting a player\u2019s division efficacy score as:\n\u03b1PB \u2217 i (S) = \u03b1 +PB i (S) =\n{\n1 if i is yes-decisive in S\n0 otherwise\nand each division\u2019s weight (again, for a priori power) as:\n\u03b3PB \u2217 (S) = 1\n|D|/z =\n1\nzn\u22121 =\n1\n2n\u22121\nPrecisely because PB is strategy symmetric, we could also construct a corresponding shortcut based on no-decisiveness."

A pivotal voter is one who, in an ordered sequence of voters who sequentially vote in favour of an alternative, is the first whose vote secures it regardless of how subsequent voters vote. Subsequent analysis has shown that being pivotal is analytically reducible to the notion of decisiveness (Turnovec et al. 2008), which is why we can define ShapleyShubik (SS) index using our general formula for \u03a8 above. We begin by specifying a player\u2019s division efficacy score, as with PB, as follows:\n\u03b1SSi (S) =\n{\n1 if i is decisive in S\n0 otherwise\nand then set each division\u2019s weight for SVGs, where k equals the number of voters whose vote agrees with i\u2019s vote in division S, as:\n\u03b3SS(S) = (k \u2212 1)! \u00b7 (n\u2212 k)!\n2n!\nBecause SS, like PB, is strategy symmetric, it too can be calculated via a shortcut SS\u2217, on the basis solely of yes-decisiveness; indeed, this is how SS is typically defined in the literature (e.g. Felsenthal and Machover 1998):\n\u03b1SS \u2217 i (S) = \u03b1 +SS i (S) =\n{\n1 if i is yes-decisive in S\n0 otherwise\nand:\n\u03b3SS \u2217 (S) = (|S| \u2212 1)! \u00b7 (n\u2212 |S|)!\nn!\nAs with PB, we could also construct the corresponding shortcut via no-decisiveness."

We can formalize a player\u2019s degree of efficacy via the concept of a division\u2019s loyal children. Call a division S winning if its outcome is yes and losing if its outcome is no. For winning divisions, we say that a division T is a loyal child of S (and S is a loyal parent of T) if and only if S = T \u222a {j}. That is, T is identical to S except that exactly one less player votes yes in T than in S. The nomenclature loyal refers to the fact that S and T have the same outcome. Symmetrically, for losing divisions, we say that T is a loyal child of S (and S is a loyal parent of T) if and only if S = T \\ {j}. That is,\nT is identical to S except that exactly one less player votes no in T than in S.

Note that because RM\u2019s division efficacy score tracks partial efficacy, the measure is not strategy symmetric; hence the familiar shortcut is unavailable, and no-efficacy must be accounted for separately from yes-efficacy."

We can formalize this conventional wisdom via a superadditivity postulate, concerning the lower bounds of a bloc\u2019s voting power, as follows. Let G\u0302 be the voting game derived from G when a subset of players I \u2286 [n] form a voting bloc. We model the formation of a bloc as all members of I fully donating their votes to a single lead member, effectively rendering the donating players dummies who are then deleted from the game. (Recall\n1For a defence of the notion of degrees of efficacy, and hence the conceptual foundations of RM, see Abizadeh (2021).\nFor the motivation for the specific design of RM, see Abizadeh & Vetta (2021).\nthat, by one of the dummy postulates, every player\u2019s a priori voting power remains the same if a dummy is deleted.) Consider the case of I = {i, j}, |I| = 2. The full donation from j to i induces a new (monotonic) game G\u0302 given by:\nS \u222a {i, j} \u2208 W\u0302 \u21d0\u21d2 S \u222a {i, j} \u2208 W\nS \u222a {i} \u2208 W\u0302 \u21d0\u21d2 S \u222a {i, j} \u2208 W\nS \u222a {j} \u2208 W\u0302 \u21d0\u21d2 S \u2208 W\nS \u2208 W\u0302 \u21d0\u21d2 S \u2208 W\nFor the case |I| \u2265 3 we generate G\u0302 simply by iterating this transformation.\nA measure of voting power \u03a8 (where \u03a8\u0302i is i\u2019s voting power in G\u0302) satisfies the superadditivity\nbloc postulate if, for any bloc I \u2286 [n]:\n(spb) \u03c8\u0302I \u2265 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i.\nAs Felsenthal and Machover (1988: 224-231) have argued, however, such a postulate would be poorly motivated for measures of voting power, and its violation not truly paradoxical. (Indeed, all three of our candidate measures would violate such a postulate.) There are two basic reasons for this. The first is that players who form a bloc lose their ability to act as separate individuals, thus foreclosing possible strategies that otherwise might have been available to them. It is therefore unreasonable to expect a bloc\u2019s power always to equal or exceed the sum of its members\u2019 power individually. Call this argument for the unreasonability of a superadditivity postulate the loss-offreedom rationale.\nThe second argument stems from a decreasing-marginal-returns dynamic. Decreasing marginal returns, a discrete analogue of concavity, is a central concept in economics. Individually, it applies when each additional unit of effort yields less incremental benefit than the previous unit. Collectively, it applies when the effort of an additional individual yields less incremental benefit when added to a larger group than a smaller group. For voting games, this effect is widespread. For example, a voter may be decisive in a small bloc but not decisive in a larger bloc. More generally, increasing the number of voters who vote with a voter above the minimum sufficient to ensure success may decrease the efficacy of the voter.\nNeither the loss-of-freedom nor the decreasing-marginal-returns rationale, however, rules out all expectations concerning lower bounds on a bloc\u2019s voting power. For example, it is reasonable to expect a bloc to be just as powerful as any member would have been individually on its own: on the one hand, the bloc as a whole has just as much freedom as any of its individual members would have had on their own; on the other, there is no reason why adding or donating one voter\u2019s power to another would diminish the latter\u2019s individual power (as noted, forming a bloc can be represented as all members transferring their voting power to a lead member). We can formalize this expectation as follows. Again, let G\u0302 be the voting game derived from G by forming a voting bloc I \u2286 [n]. A measure of voting power \u03a8 satisfies the minimum-power bloc postulate if, for any bloc I \u2286 [n]:\n(mpb) \u03c8\u0302I \u2265 maxi\u2208I \u03c8i.\nFelsenthal and Machover (1998: 255-56) have already shown that PB and SS satisfy the postulate,2 while Abizadeh and Vetta (2021) show that RM satisfies it.\nThe superadditivity bloc postulate, which we rejected, and the minimum-power bloc postulate, which we accept, both concern the lower bounds of a bloc\u2019s power. Are there reasonable expectations about upper bounds, motivated by the loss-of-freedom and decreasing-marginal-returns rationales? The most stringent expectation would be that a bloc\u2019s voting power never be greater than the sum of its members\u2019 voting power prior to forming the bloc. A measure of voting power \u03a8 would meet this expectation if it satisfied the subadditivity bloc postulate, i.e., if, for any bloc I \u2286 [n]:\n(sbb) \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i.\nIt is not reasonable, however, to expect measures of voting power to satisfy the subadditivity bloc postulate. The reason is because the loss-of-freedom and decreasing-marginal-returns dynamics may in some circumstances be undercut or neutralized by two corresponding counterveiling dynamics. First, as Felsenthal and Machover (1998: 229) have argued, when a bloc of at least three members is formed, whether the bloc\u2019s voting power is less or greater than the sum of its members\u2019 original, pre-bloc voting power will often depend on whether, in the original voting structure, the divisions in which any given individual would-be bloc member was efficacious tend to be ones in which other would-be bloc members vote against or with each other. From amongst divisions in which would-be bloc members are efficacious, the higher the proportion of divisions in which some members vote against each other, the more we should expect the sum of their individual voting powers to be higher relative to the bloc\u2019s voting power (because, once the bloc is formed, these \u201chigh-efficacy\u201d divisions no longer exist); by contrast, the higher the proportion of divisions, from amongst those in which would-be members are efficacious, in which would-be members vote together, the more we should expect the sum of individual voting powers to be less relative to the bloc\u2019s voting power \u2013 and hence the more we should expect the voting structure to induce a violation of the subadditivity bloc postulate. In essence, this latter, inefficacious-dissension dynamic neutralizes the loss-of-freedom dynamic.\nSecond, decreasing marginal returns may sometimes (for example with small voting blocs) be counterveilled by increasing marginal returns. The latter dynamic may arise because increasing the proportion of divisions in which more voters vote with a given voter often increases (and, for monotonic games, never reduces) the proportion of divisions in which the voter is successful and, hence, potentially efficacious or decisive.\nIndeed, none of our candidate measures satisfies the subadditivity bloc postulate. For example, consider three-voter unanimity rule in which the three voters subsequently form a bloc. This is clearly a case displaying both inefficacious dissension (each voter is decisive in only two divisions, in both of which other would-be bloc members all vote together) and increasing marginal returns (the bloc is successful in all divisions). Prior to forming the bloc, for each voter PBi = 1 4 , such that \u2211\nPBi = 3 4 . But once the bloc is formed, PBI = 1, in violation of subadditivity. For SS and\n2Although they only show this for blocs of two players, the result follows for blocs of any size by applying their\nresult sequentially.\nRM, consider the weighted voting game G = {2; 1, 1, 2, 2, 2} where there are five voters with weights {1, 1, 2, 2, 2} and a quota of 2. The reader may verify that for both SS and RM, \u03c8\u0302{1,2} > \u03c81 + \u03c82. (In particular, S\u0302S{1,2} = 1 4 > SS1 + SS2 = 1 20 + 1 20 = 1 10 ; and \u02c6RM \u2032{1,2} = 19 64 > RM \u2032 1 +RM \u2032 2 =\n41 320 + 41 320 = 41 160 .)\nThus, whilst the loss-of-freedom and decreasing-marginal-returns rationales render unreasonable the expectation that the bloc\u2019s power always be greater than or equal to the sum of its members (the superadditivity bloc postulate), they do not rule out the possibility that, on some occasions, a bloc\u2019s voting power may indeed be greater."

We shall specify two such weaker postulates, concerning a bloc\u2019s upper bounds, when the bloc contains at least one blocker (or vetoer). We say that a player i is a yesblocker if for every S \u2208 W we have i \u2208 S. Consequently, if i votes no then the outcome is no. That is, i can veto a yes-outcome. Similarly, a player j is a no-blocker if for every S /\u2208 W we have j \u2208 S\u0304. That is, if j votes yes then the outcome is yes and j can block or veto a no-outcome.\nLet G\u0302 be the voting game derived from G by forming a voting bloc I \u2286 [n]. Then a measure of\nvoting power \u03a8 satisfies the strong subadditivity blocker postulate if:\n(sbk-1) \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i for any I containing a yes-blocker b.\n(sbk-2) \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i for any I containing a no-blocker b.\nThat is, the a priori voting power of I in G\u0302 is no greater than the sum of the a priori voting power of each of its members separately in G, provided I contains a yes-blocker (or no-blocker).\nWhy would the strong subadditivity blocker postulate be reasonable? On the one hand, the loss-of-freedom dynamic, which favours subadditivity, is still in place: since a bloc member j \u2208 I is forced to coordinate its vote with the bloc, any contributions it could have made in divisions in which members would have voted against each other are excluded; only the player\u2019s contribution when the bloc votes together counts. But the presence of a blocker b also puts into play the counterveilling inefficacious-dissension dynamic: if the blocker is a yes-blocker, for example, other would-be bloc members could not have been efficacious on their own in any division in which the blocker voted no and they voted against it. So the loss-of-freedom dynamic on its own is insufficient to secure the subaddivity blocker postulate. On the other hand, the presence of a blocker b \u2013 let us say a yes-blocker \u2013 strengthens the decreasing-marginal-returns dynamic. When j transfers its voting power to a bloc that contains a yes-blocker, its presence cannot help increase the bloc\u2019s division efficacy score on the no-side any further than the score would have been without j: when the bloc votes no, the outcome is no regardless of whether or not j joins the bloc. That is, for (sbk-1), the presence of player j can help increase the bloc\u2019s voting power only on the basis of divisions in which the bloc votes together and when the yes-blocker b votes yes. Thus j\u2019s marginal contributions will be even less. A symmetric argument motivates (sbk-2).\nWe can further weaken the subadditivity blocker postulate by considering only the case in which every member of the bloc is a blocker. A measure of voting power \u03a8 satisfies the weak subadditivity blocker postulate if:\n(wbk-1) \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i for any I containing only yes-blockers.\n(wbk-2) \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i for any I containing only no-blockers.\nThat is, the a priori voting power of I in G\u0302 is no greater than the sum of the a priori voting power of each of its members separately in G, provided every member of I is a yes-blocker (or every member of I is a no-blocker). Observe that (wbk-1) is indeed weaker than (sbk-1) because it only need hold in the restricted case where the bloc I consists entirely of yes-blockers. For example, the decreasing-marginal-returns rationale may hold only when the added agent j is itself a yes-blocker (as well as the other members of the bloc) and need not hold when j is not a blocker."

In effect, the postulate requires that for any yes-blocker, its share of a priori voting power, out of the sum of all players\u2019 a priori voting power, be no less than 1|S\u2217| . Felsenthal and Machover then prove that PB violates the postulate, i.e., that when PB is normalized such that all players\u2019 scores sum to 1, which yields each player\u2019s relative voting power according to what they call the\nBanzhaf index, a yes-blocker\u2019s relative a priori voting power according to the Banzhaf index may be less than 1|S\u2217| , whereas SS (which is itself already a relative index, since \u2211 i\u2208[n] SSi = 1) satisfies it. It can be shown that RM, like PB, also violates the blocker\u2019s share postulate.\nDoes this speak against PB and RM? It does not: the postulate is unmotivated for voting power. The intuition behind the postulate does not concern voting power as such but, rather, its expected value (as is implicit to Felsenthal and Machover\u2019s justification for the postulate).3 Consider a nonvoter for whom the value of a yes-outcome is equal to f > 0, and who would therefore be willing to spend up to f to buy the votes of a set of voters capable of ensuring a yes-outcome. This set must include any yes-blocker, if there is one. Assume the voting structure has at least one yes-blocker, the non-voter knows the voting structure, but has no information about the distribution of player preferences (modelling the a priori case). Without information about voter inclinations, the most efficient strategy is to bribe the smallest possible set of successful yes-voters S\u2217, to minimize the total bribe necessary to secure the desired outcome. What is the (subjective) expected value, to the non-voter, of the yes-blocker\u2019s vote, i.e., the value of bribing the yes-blocker rather other players to realize the desired yes-outcome? If every member of S\u2217 is a yes-blocker, then the expected value of any yes-blocker\u2019s vote to the non-voter will be equal to that of any other yes-blocker, which implies the non-voter would be willing to offer each yes-blocker a bribe of up to 1|S\u2217| \u00b7f . If, by contrast, not all members of S\u2217 are yes-blockers, then the smallest possible set of successful yes-voters will not be unique, i.e., there will more than one such minimal set of voters. And since only a yes-blocker will be a member of every such minimal set, the expected value of its vote to the non-voter will at least as great as that of any other potential member of these minimal sets. Therefore, 1|S\u2217| \u00b7 f is the minimum value of a yes-blocker\u2019s vote to the non-voter, and 1|S\u2217| its minimum relative value. And this is precisely what the blocker\u2019s share postulate says: that the relative value of a yes-blocker\u2019s a priori voting power should be at least 1|S\u2217| . We therefore conclude that the blocker\u2019s share postulate is appropriate not for measures of a priori voting power, but, rather, for measures of the expected value of a player\u2019s a priori voting power. (The fact that SS satisfies the blocker\u2019s share postulate provides support, in other words, for the view that, considered as an a priori index, it is best interpreted, not as an index of relative a priori voting power, but, rather, as an index of a player\u2019s expected payoff assuming a cooperative game with transferable utility).4\nIt is possible, however, to reformulate the postulate in a way that would be appropriate for measures of voting power, by focussing on a player\u2019s a priori power itself, rather than its share of overall power. The key is to compare its a priori power against the voting power that a measure of voting power would assign to a dictator in a dictator-rule SVG. To formalize this, let S be a yes-successful set in G (S \u2208 W), T\u0304 = [n] \\ T be a no-successful set in G (T /\u2208 W), and \u03c8d be the voting power of player d in G\u2032, where G\u2032 is any dictator-rule SVG and d is the dictator.\nA measure of voting power \u03a8 satisfies the strong minimum-power blocker postulate if:\n(smp-1) If b \u2208 S is a yes-blocker, then \u03c8b \u2265 \u03c8d |S| , for any S \u2208 W.\n3Felsenthal and Machover put it in terms of their distinction between I-power and P-power. 4On SS as a bribe index, see Morriss (2002); on the equivalent expected payoff interpretation, see Felsenthal and\nMachover (1998).\n(smp-2) If b \u2208 T\u0304 is a no-blocker, then \u03c8b \u2265 \u03c8d |T\u0304 | , for any T /\u2208 W.\nA measure of voting power \u03a8 satisfies the weak minimum-power blocker postulate if:\n(wmp-1) If every voter in S is a yes-blocker, then \u03c8b \u2265 \u03c8d |S| , for all b \u2208 S, for any S \u2208 W.\n(wmp-2) If every voter in T\u0304 is a no-blocker, then \u03c8b \u2265 \u03c8d |T\u0304 | , for all b \u2208 T\u0304 , for any T /\u2208 W.\nThe strong minimum-power blocker postulate obviously implies the weak minimum-power blocker\npostulate. We remark that \u03c8d = 1 for a dictator d for each of the three voting measures studied in this paper. In fact, multiplying \u03c8i(S) by a fixed scalar for each voter i and each subset S has no effect on the structure of the voting game nor on the satisfaction of any of the postulates. The fact that \u03c8d = 1 for each of three voting measures essentially means their scaling factors are all identical.\nTo understand the minimum-power blocker postulates, let\u2019s begin with a sanity check. Suppose S = {b} with cardinality 1. If {b} is a yes-successful set and b is a yes-blocker, then a division R = (R, R\u0304) is yes-successful if and only if b \u2208 R. That is, b is a dictator! It follows that \u03c8b = \u03c8d \u2265 \u03c8d 1 and the weak minimum-power blocker postulate (wmp-1) holds for S = {b}. A similar argument applies for (wmp-2).\nSuppose, by contrast, that S is a yes-successful set containing more than one player, but each is a yes-blocker. Then R = (R, R\u0304) is yes-successful if and only if S \u2286 R. Thus, collectively S is a dictatorship. But, in addition, each voter b \u2208 S has the individual power to veto any yes-outcome. Thus the agents in S have the option of choosing to act collectively as dictator, and individually each must be in any yes-successful set. It is thus reasonable to expect the voting power of any member of S does satisfy \u03c8b \u2265 \u03c8d |S| and the weak minimum-power blocker postulate holds.\nA similar argument applies for the strong minimum-power blocker postulate. The agents in S can choose to act collectively as a dictator. But since S may contain non-blockers, this is only because a yes-blocker b has the power to veto any yes-outcome. Thus b should have power at least as large as any other member of S and, specifically, at least as the large as the average, and hence \u03c8b \u2265 \u03c8d |S| ."

            "text": "We conclude with the added-blocker postulate, which concerns changes to other players\u2019 a priori voting power when a blocker is added to a game.\nThe first step is to formulate an added-blocker postulate that is appropriate for a priori voting power in general. Given a game G = ([n],W), let GY = ([n] \u222a {0},WY ) be the game resulting from adding an added yes-blocker, i.e., a new player 0 that is a yes-blocker but who otherwise does not affect the original voting structure. Specifically, WY = {S \u222a {0} : \u2200S \u2208 W}. Similarly, let GN = ([n] \u222a {0},WN ) be the game resulting from adding an added no-blocker 0. Specifically, WN = {S \u222a {0} : \u2200S} \u222a {S : \u2200S \u2208 W}.\nFelsenthal and Machover (1988: 266-275) argue that any reasonable measure of voting power\n\u03a8 must satisfy the following postulate for a priori voting power. For any pair of players i and j,\n(add-0) \u03c8i(G)\u03c8j(G) = \u03c8i(G Y ) \u03c8j(GY )\nThat is, the relative measures of a priori voting power for i and j should be unaffected by an added yes-blocker. They argue \u201cthere is nothing at all to imply that the addition of the new\u201d yes-blocker \u201cis of greater relative advantage to some of the voters\u201d of the original game than to others, because there is \u201cno reasonable mechanism that would create a differential effect\u201d (Felsenthal and Machover 1998: 267). They then show that PB satisfies this postulate, but SS violates it, and, on this basis, conclude that the latter cannot be considered a valid index of a priori voting power.5\nBut there is a problem: their specification is asymmetric between yes-voting and no-voting power.6 Contrary to their assertion, in general we do have good reasons to expect an added yesblocker sometimes to have differential relative impact on players\u2019 a priori voting power as a whole, depending on the relative importance, to each player\u2019s total voting power, of its yes- as opposed to no-voting power. This is because an added yes-blocker may diminish the relative significance or share of yes-voting power within a player\u2019s total voting power.\nWe should expect this potential asymmetry between yes- and no-voting power to be neutralized only for measures of voting power that, like PB and SS, give a positive efficacy score only in cases of (full) decisiveness. Such measures, by ignoring partial efficacy, effectively render a player\u2019s a priori yes- and no-voting power perfectly symmetrical, that is, \u03c8+i = \u03c8 \u2212 i : any player that is yes-decisive in a winning division will also be no-decisive in the corresponding losing division in which the only difference is that player\u2019s vote. By contrast, this symmetry between yes- and no-voting power will not hold for measures that, like RM, take degrees of efficacy into account. A player that is only partially efficacious in a winning division will not be efficacious at all in the corresponding division in which all other players\u2019 votes are held constant, because, not being (fully) decisive, the player\u2019s switch from yes to no will not change the outcome \u2013 which switches the player from successful in one division to unsuccessful in the other. RM is not, in other words, strategy symmetric. The implication is that, if a player\u2019s total voting power relies more heavily on partial efficacy in winning divisions than does that of another player, then an added yes-blocker may have a disproportionately\n5Where voting power is understood as the capacity to influence voting outcomes (Felsenthal and Machover 1998:\n267-275). 6A similar issue arises with the bicameral postulate (Felsenthal et al. 1998).\nnegative impact on the former than on the latter. We therefore have no reason in general to expect an added yes-blocker never to result in some players\u2019 relative advantage.\nBy contrast, we have every reason to expect that an added yes-blocker will be of no relative advantage to players\u2019 a priori yes-voting power and that an added no-blocker will be of no relative advantage to players\u2019 a priori no-voting power in particular. This induces an easy fix to Felsenthal and Machover\u2019s proposal, so as to yield a postulate appropriate for all efficacy measures in general (and not just decisiveness measures). We simply reformulate their postulate to distinguish between yes-voting power and no-voting power. Accordingly, we say that a measure of voting power \u03a8 satisfies the added-blocker postulate if, for any pair of players i and j, the following conditions hold for a priori voting power:\n(add-1) \u03c8+i (G)\n\u03c8+j (G) =\n\u03c8+i (G Y ) \u03c8+j (G Y ) , and\n(add-2) \u03c8\u2212i (G)\n\u03c8\u2212j (G) =\n\u03c8\u2212i (G N ) \u03c8\u2212j (G N )\n(add-1) says that the relative measures of a priori yes-voting power are unaffected by an added yes-blocker. Hence, we call this element of the postulate the added-yes-blocker postulate for any pair of players i and j. (add-2) says the relative measures of a priori no-voting power are unaffected by an added no-blocker. We similarly call this element the added-no-blocker postulate."

            "text": "Proofs for Section 3\nTheorem 3.1. PB fails to satisfy the weak subadditivity blocker postulate (and, thus, fails to satisfy the strong subadditivity blocker postulate).\nProof. Let G be a three-player unanimity-rule voting game, and let G\u0302 be the game derived from G when all three players form a unanimous bloc I. By the unanimity-rule, all three players are yes-blockers in G. Now PB gives a value to each player of 14 and thus \u22113 i=1 PBi = 3 4 . But I is a dictator in G\u0302, so \u02c6PBI = 1 > 3 4 , in violation of each subadditivity blocker postulate.\nTheorem 3.2. SS satisfies the weak subadditivity blocker postulate but does not satisfy the strong subadditivity blocker postulate.\nProof. First we show SS does not satisfy the strong subadditivity blocker postulate via a counterexample. Consider the weighted voting game G={3 : 2, 1, 1}. Observe that voter 1 is a yes-blocker since voters 2 and 3 have voting weight 1 + 1 which is smaller than the quota of 3. Here SS1 = 2 3 and SS2 = SS3 = 1 6 . Now let G\u0302 be the game derived from G in which the first two players form a bloc I = {1, 2}. It follows that I is a dictator in G\u0302, so S\u0302SI = 1 > 2 3 + 1 6 = 5 6 , in violation of the postulate.\nSecond, we prove SS does satisfy the weak subadditivity blocker postulate. It suffices to show (wbk-1) holds. Assume I = {i, j}. Let yes-blocker j donate to yes-blocker i. Then j becomes a dummy. Take an ordering \u03c3 of the agents. We have three cases. (i) Let j be the pivotal voter in the ordering \u03c3 for G. Let S be the set of agents before j in the ordering. Since j is decisive in S \u222a {j} in G but is a dummy in G\u0302, it must be the case that S is a yes-successful set in G\u0302. In particular, i must appear before j in \u03c3 since i is a yes-blocker. Thus i \u2208 S. Since S is yes-successful in G\u0302 there must be some agent in S that is now decisive. This may or may not be agent i. (ii) Let i be the pivotal voter in the ordering \u03c3 for G. Let S be the set of agents before i in the ordering. So S is yes-unsuccessful and S \u222a {i} is yes-successful in G. This must still be the case after the donation from j to i. Thus i remains the pivotal voter in the ordering \u03c3 for G\u0302. (iii) Let \u2113 6= i, j be the pivotal voter in the ordering \u03c3 for G. Let S be the set of agents before \u2113 in the ordering. Since S \u222a {\u2113} is yes-successful in G, it must be the case that i and j are in S since they are both yes-blockers. (Note, this is where the distinction between the weak and strong postulates is important.) But then, by definition, S and S \u222a {\u2113} have the same outcomes in G and G\u0302. Thus \u2113 remains pivotal in the ordering \u03c3 for G\u0302. It immediately follows that \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u03c8i + \u03c8j . Iterating this argument, we have that \u03c8\u0302I \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208I \u03c8i for any I consisting only of three or more blockers.\nTheorem 3.3. RM satisfies the strong subadditivity blocker postulate (and, thus, satisfies the weak subadditivity blocker postulate).\nThe crux to proving Theorem 3.3 is the following lemma.\nLemma 7.1. Let j fully donate to i. If j is a yes-blocker (or a no-blocker), then \u02c6RM \u2032i \u2264 RM \u2032i +RM \u2032 j .\nProof. Observe that\nRM \u2032i = 1\n2n \u00b7\n\u2211\nS\u2208D:i,j /\u2208S\n(\u03b1i(S) + \u03b1i(S \u222a j) + \u03b1i(S \u222a i) + \u03b1i(S \u222a {i, j}))\n= 1\n2n \u00b7\n\u2211\nS\u2208D:i,j /\u2208S\n(\n\u03b1\u2212i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 + i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1 + i (S \u222a {i, j})\n)\nThus to prove \u02c6RM \u2032i \u2264 RM \u2032 i +RM \u2032 j it suffices to show that\n\u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S) + \u03b1\u0302 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1\u0302 + i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1\u0302 + i (S \u222a {i, j})\n\u2264 (\n\u03b1\u2212i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S)\n) + (\n\u03b1\u2212i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 + j (S \u222a j)\n) + (\n\u03b1+i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i)\n) + (\n\u03b1+i (S \u222a {i, j}) + \u03b1 + j (S \u222a {i, j})\n)\nTake any S containing neither i nor j. Since j is a yes-blocker, S and S \u222a i lose in the original game. Furthermore, by monotonicity, in the original game either: (i) S \u222a j and S \u222a {i, j} both win, or (ii) S \u222a j loses and S \u222a {i, j} wins, or (iii) S \u222a j and S \u222a {i, j} both lose. Thus there are three cases. In the modified game these three cases imply: (i) S \u222a i and S \u222a {i, j} both win but S and S \u222a j both lose. (ii) S \u222a i and S \u222a {i, j} both win but S and S \u222a j both lose. (iii) S, S \u222a j, S \u222a i and S \u222a {i, j} all lose. The first two cases are easier to deal with. In Case (i) observe that j is yes-decisive at both S \u222a j and S \u222a {i, j} and no-decisive at both S and S \u222a i. Thus (\n\u03b1\u2212i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S)\n) + (\n\u03b1\u2212i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 + j (S \u222a j)\n) + (\n\u03b1+i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i)\n) + (\n\u03b1+i (S \u222a {i, j}) + \u03b1 + j (S \u222a {i, j})\n)\n\u2265 (0 + 1) + (0 + 1) + (0 + 1) + (0 + 1))\n\u2265 4 \u2265 \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S) + \u03b1\u0302 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1\u0302 + i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1\u0302 + i (S \u222a {i, j})\nSimilarly, in Case (ii) observe that both i and j are yes-decisive at S\u222a{i, j}. Furthermore, i is\nno-decisive at S \u222a j and j is no-decisive at S \u222a i. Thus (\n\u03b1\u2212i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S)\n) + (\n\u03b1\u2212i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 + j (S \u222a j)\n) + (\n\u03b1+i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i)\n) + (\n\u03b1+i (S \u222a {i, j}) + \u03b1 + j (S \u222a {i, j})\n)\n\u2265 (0 + 0) + (1 + 0) + (0 + 1) + (1 + 1))\n\u2265 4 \u2265 \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S) + \u03b1\u0302 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1\u0302 + i (S \u222a i) + \u03b1\u0302 + i (S \u222a {i, j})\nCase (iii) is more complex. Recall that in this case S, S \u222a j, S\u222a i and S\u222a {i, j} all lose in both the original game and the modified game. This implies that the yes-efficacy score of each voter is zero at these divisions. Thus it suffices to prove that\n\u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S) + \u03b1\u0302 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2212 i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i) (1)\nIn fact, we will prove something stronger. The following two inequalities hold.\n\u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2212 i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S) (2)\n\u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S \u222a j) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i) (3)\nTo show this we need the following important fact from Abizadeh and Vetta (2021). A noefficacy score \u03b1\u2212i (S) for RM can be calculated by considering paths in the division lattice from S to [n]. The division lattice contains a node for each division S. There is an arc in the lattice from S to S \u222a j, for each j \u2208 [n] \\ S. Then the no-efficacy score \u03b1\u2212i (S) is the fraction of paths from S to [n] that contains a division at which i is no-decisive.\nUsing this fact we proceed to prove (2).\nClaim 7.1. \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2212 i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S)\nProof. Take any path P from S to [n] that contains a division at which i is no-decisive in the modified game G\u0302. Thus P contributes to \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S). We wish to find a matching contribution to \u03b1\u2212i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S). Again we break the analysis into cases.\n1. i is no-decisive at T on path P in G\u0302\nBy monotonicity, i is no-decisive at the highest no-division on P in G\u0302. Thus, we may assume T\u222ak on path P is a yes-division in G\u0302. But i is a yes-blocker in G\u0302 because j is a yes-blocker in G. Hence, it must be that case that k = i.\nNow T \u222a i is losing in G and j is a yes-blocker in G. But T \u222a i is winning in G\u0302. So, by definition, T \u222a {i, j} is winning in G. This implies j is no-decisive at T \u222a i on path P in G. Consequently, P contributes to \u03b1\u2212j (S).\n2. i is no-decisive at T \u222a j on path P in G\u0302\n(a) T\u222a j is losing in G: note that T\u222a {i, j} is winning in G as it is winning in G\u0302. Therefore,\ni is also no-decisive at T \u222a j on path P in G. Thus P contributes to \u03b1\u2212i (S).\n(b) T\u222a j is winning in G: Now consider the mirror path PM from S to [n] which is identical\nto P except the roles or i and j are switched (that is i and j swap their positions in P ). In particular, PM passes through the division T \u222a i. But as j is a yes-blocker in G it must be the case that T \u222a i is losing in G. As T \u222a {i, j} is winning in both G and G\u0302, it follows that j is no-decisive at T\u222ai on the path PM in G. Consequently, PM contributes to \u03b1\u2212j (S). On the other hand, suppose P M also contributes to \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S). This can only happen if i is no-decisive at R in G\u0302, where R is the division where P and PM diverge. By definition, this implies R \u222a {i, j} is winning in G. In particular, i is no-decisive at R \u222a j on P in G\u0302. So in this case P also contributes to \u03b1\u2212i (S).\nErgo, the combined contribution of P and PM to \u03b1\u2212i (S) is at most their combined contribution to \u03b1\u2212i (S) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S). The claim follows.\nNow we prove (3).\nClaim 7.2. \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S \u222a j) \u2264 \u03b1 \u2212 i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i)\nProof. Take any path P from S \u222a j to [n] that contains a division at which i is no-decisive in the modified game G\u0302. Thus P contributes to \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S \u222a j). We wish to find a matching contribution to \u03b1\u2212i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i). Let i be no-decisive at T \u222a j on path P in G\u0302. We now have two cases.\n1. T \u222a j is losing in G: in this case, i is also no-decisive at T \u222a j on path P in G. Thus P\ncontributes to \u03b1\u2212i (S \u222a j).\n2. T \u222a j is winning in G: Now consider the twin path P T from S \u222a i to [n] which is identical\nto P except the roles or i and j are switched (note that unlike for the mirror path PM the twin path starts at a different division than P ). So P T passes through T\u222a i. But since j is a yes-blocker in G it must be the case that T \u222a i is losing in G. It follows that j is no-decisive at T \u222a i on the path P T in G. Thus PM contributes to \u03b1\u2212j (S\u222a i). Furthermore, observe that since the path P T originates at S \u222a i, the voter i cannot be no-decisive on the path.\nErgo, the combined contribution of P and P T to \u03b1\u0302\u2212i (S \u222a j) is at most their combined contribution to \u03b1\u2212i (S \u222a j) + \u03b1 \u2212 j (S \u222a i). The claim follows.\nTogether Claim 7.1 and Claim 7.2 imply (2). Thus the proof of Lemma 7.1 is complete.\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 3.3.\nProof. (of Theorem 3.3) Lemma 7.1 and the dummy postulate imply that the subadditivity blocker postulate holds for I = {i, j} where j is a yes-blocker. But if j is a yes-blocker in G then I is a yes-blocker in G\u0302. Thus for |I| > 2 the result then follows by iteratively adding the voters of I to the set {i, j}.\nProofs for Section 4\nTheorem 4.1. PB does not satisfy the weak minimum-power blocker postulate (and, thus, does not satisfy the strong minimum-power blocker postulate).\nProof. Take a unanimity game. Then each player b is a yes-blocker and has voting power PBb = \u2211\nS\u2208D \u03b1 PB i (S) \u00b7 \u03b3 PB(S) = 22n = 1 2n\u22121 . Furthermore the smallest possible yes-successful set is S\u2217 = [n], which has cardinality n. A dictator d has voting power PBd = 1. But then, for large n, we have\nPBb = 1\n2n\u22121 \u226a \u03c8d |S\u2217| = 1 n\nErgo, the weak minimum-power blocker postulate does not hold.\nTheorem 4.2. SS satisfies the strong minimum-power blocker postulate (and, thus, satisfies the weak minimum-power blocker postulate).\nProof. Since \u2211\ni\u2208[n] SSi = 1 = SSd, this follows immediately from the fact that SS satisfies the\nblocker\u2019s share postulate (Felsenthal and Machover 1998).\nTheorem 4.3.

Let b be a yes-blocker; it immediately follows that b \u2208 S\u2217. Now any set of players S can be written as S = (S \u2229 S\u2217) \u222a (S \u2229 ([n] \\ S\u2217)). Thus we have\nRM \u2032b = 1 2n \u00b7 \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1b(S) = 1 2n \u00b7 \u2211\nS\u2286[n]\\S\u2217\n\u2211\nT\u2286S\u2217\n\u03b1b(S \u222a T) (4)\nNow |T | \u2264 k for any subset T or S\u2217. Hence\n\u2211\nT\u2286S\u2217\n\u03b1b(S \u222a T) = k \u2211\n\u2113=0\n\u2211\nT\u2286S\u2217:|T |=\u2113\n\u03b1b(S \u222a T) = k \u2211\n\u2113=0\n\u2211\nT\u2286S\u2217:|T |=\u2113\n(\n\u03b1+b (S \u222a T) + \u03b1 \u2212 b (S \u222a T)\n)\n(5)\nNow if S \u222a T is winning then \u03b1+b (S \u222a T) = 1 because b is a yes-blocker and, hence, is yes-decisive in S \u222a T. It follows that to lower bound (5) we may assume that S \u222a T is losing for any T \u2282 S\u2217. Note the strict subset is necessary here since, by monotonicity, S \u222a S\u2217 must be winning. Thus for any l < k we obtain a lower bound of\n\u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113\n\u03b1b(S \u222a T) = \u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113\n\u03b1\u2212b (S \u222a T)\n= \u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113,b\u2208T\n\u03b1\u2212b (S \u222a T) + \u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113,b/\u2208T\n\u03b1\u2212b (S \u222a T)\n= 0 + \u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113,b/\u2208T\n\u03b1\u2212b (S \u222a T)\n= \u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113,b/\u2208T\n\u03b1\u2212b (S \u222a T) (6)\nHere the third equality holds since, by definition, the no-efficacy of b is zero for any division in which b votes yes. Now recall that to calculate \u03b1\u2212b (S\u222aT) we may perform a random walk in the no-poset. We need to find the probability that, starting the walk at the node for division S \u222a T we reach a node where b is no-decisive. In particular, b is no-decisive at the node for S \u222a S\u2217 \\ {b}. Moreover, since b is a yes-blocker, it is no-decisive at the node for S\u222aX\u222aS\u2217 \\{b} for any X \u2286 [n] \\ (S \u222aS\u2217), by monotonicity. This implies that if we randomly add players in order to S \u222a T we will reach a node where b is no-decisive if b appears after every other node of S\u2217. Since |T | = \u2113, this occurs with probability 1k\u2212\u2113 . Thus \u03b1 \u2212 b (S \u222a T) \u2265 1 k\u2212\u2113 . Note this is an inequality not equality. (We have a lower bound on no-efficacy since there may be other losing divisions, reachable from S\u222aT, that do\nnot contain S\u2217 \\ {b} where b is no-decisive.) Simple counting arguments then give\n\u2211\nT\u2282S\u2217:|T |=\u2113,b/\u2208T\n\u03b1\u2212b (S \u222a T) \u2265\n(\nk \u2212 1\n\u2113\n)\n\u00b7 1\nk \u2212 \u2113 =\n(\nk \u2113\n)\n\u00b7 1\nk (7)\nObserve that \u03b1+b (S \u222a S \u2217) = 1.

A symmetrical argument applies to (smp-2) for a no-blocker. Ergo, the strong minimum-power blocker postulate is satisfied.\nWe remark that an alternative proof of Theorem 4.3 is via the fact that RM satisfies the strong subadditivity blocker postulate (Theorem 3.3). In contrast, such an approach cannot be used to prove Theorem 4.2 since SS does not satisfy the strong subadditivity blocker postulate (Theorem 3.2).\nProofs for Section 5\nTheorem 5.1. PB satisfies the added-blocker postulate.\nProof. Recall \u03c8+i = \u03c8 \u2212 i for any decisiveness measure. Thus, a decisiveness measure that satisfies Felsenthal and Machover\u2019s (1998: 266-75) specification of the added-blocker postulate ipso facto satisfies our specification. It follows that PB satisfies our added-blocker postulate, since, as they show, it satisfies theirs.\nTheorem 5.2. SS does not satisfy the added-blocker postulate.\nProof. Consider the weighted voting games G = {3; 2, 1, 1} and GY = {8; 2, 1, 1, 5} (Felsenthal and Machover 1998). Observe that the new player in GY is a yes-blocker. It can be verified that SS+1 (G) = 2 6 and SS + 2 (G) = 1 12 whereas SS + 1 (G Y ) = 524 and SS + 2 (G Y ) = 124 . Thus SS+1 (G)\nSS+2 (G) = 4 <\nSS+1 (G Y ) SS+2 (G Y ) = 5, in violation of (add-1) and hence our postulate.\nTheorem 5.3. PB satisfies the added-blocker postulate.\nTo prove that RM satisfies the added-blocker postulate, we show it satisfies (add-1) and (add-2). We begin with a useful lemma.\nLemma 7.2. For any player i, the efficacy scores \u03b1+RM and \u03b1\u2212RM in G and GY satisfy\n\u03b1+ i,GY (S \u222a {0}) = \u03b1+i,G(S) \u2200S (B1)\n\u03b1+ i,GY ((S, S\u0304 \u222a 0)) = 0 \u2200S (B2)\nProof. Consider the games G and GY . Recall the winning divisions in GY are of the form S \u222a {0} where S \u2208 W in the original voting game. The key facts are then the following. Let S \u2286 [n] contain player i. Then in GY player i is never yes-decisive at (S, S\u0304 \u222a 0) because the division is a losing division (given that S does not contain the blocker 0). Furthermore, player i is yes-decisive at S \u222a {0} in GY if and only if it is originally yes-decisive at S in G.\nNext take S \u2286 [n] where S does not contain player i. Then in GY player i is never no-decisive at (S, S\u0304 \u222a 0) because S \u222a {i} /\u2208 W (given that it does not contain the blocker 0). Furthermore, player i is no-decisive at S \u222a {0} in GY if and only if i is originally no-decisive at S in G.\nThese key facts imply that the yes-outcomes for GY are identical to the yes-outcomes for G, except that for each winning coalition the set of yes-voters now also contains the blocker 0 (equivalently, the set of no-voters in their corresponding divisions are identical). This immediately implies that we recursively calculate the yes-efficacy scores, they are identical for the corresponding winning coalitions in G and GY . That is, \u03b1+ i,GY (S \u222a {0}) = \u03b1+i,G(S) and (B1) holds.\nFurthermore, given that 0 is a yes-blocker, any S \u2286 [n] is a losing division. Thus \u03b1+ i,GY (S, S\u0304 \u222a\n0) = 0 and (B2) holds.\nLemma 7.3. RM satisfies (add-1).\nProof. For any player i in the original game\nRM \u2032+i (G Y ) =\n\u2211\nS\u2208DY\n\u03b1+ i,GY\n(S) \u00b7 1\n2n+1\n= \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1+ i,GY\n((S, S\u0304 \u222a 0)) \u00b7 1 2n+1 + \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1+ i,GY\n(S \u222a {0}) \u00b7 1\n2n+1\n= 0 + \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1+ i,GY\n(S \u222a {0}) \u00b7 1\n2n+1\n= \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1+i,G(S) \u00b7 1\n2n+1\n= 1 2 \u00b7 \u2211\nS\u2208D\n\u03b1+i,G(S) \u00b7 1\n2n\n= 1\n2 \u00b7 RM \u2032+i (G)\nHere the third and fourth equalities hold by (B1) and (B2) of Lemma 7.3, respectively. Similarly, for any player j in the original game, we have RM \u2032+j (G Y ) = 12 \u00b7RM \u2032+ j (G). Consequently,\nRM \u2032+i (G Y ) RM \u2032+j (G Y ) = 1 2 \u00b7 RM \u2032+ i (G) 1 2 \u00b7 RM \u2032+ j (G) = RM \u2032+i (G) RM \u2032+j (G)\nErgo, the added-yes-blocker postulate (add-1) is satisfied.\nLemma 7.4. RM satisfies (add-2).\nProof. Applying a symmetric argument to that used in the proof of Lemma 7.3 we have the following. For any player i in the original game, the efficacy scores \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 in G and GN satisfy\n\u03b1\u2212 i,GN (S \u222a {0}) = 0 \u2200S\n\u03b1\u2212 i,GN ((S, S\u0304 \u222a {0})) = \u03b1\u2212i,G(S) \u2200S\nThen, applying a symmetric argument to that used in the proof of Lemma 7.3 completes the proof.\nIt follows by Lemmas 7.3 and 7.4 that RM satisfies the added-blocker postulate and Theorem 5.3\nholds."
