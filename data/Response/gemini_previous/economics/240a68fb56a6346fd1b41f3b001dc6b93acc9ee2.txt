1. **Investigate the impact of expanding dental coverage under the Spanish NHS on catastrophic out-of-pocket spending for dental care.** This could be done by comparing the incidence and concentration of catastrophic OOP-D before and after the expansion of coverage, using data from the Spanish Family Budget Survey or other relevant sources.


2. **Examine the relationship between catastrophic OOP-D and oral health outcomes.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study that follows a cohort of individuals over time to assess the impact of catastrophic OOP-D on their oral health status.


3. **Explore the role of socioeconomic factors in catastrophic OOP-D for dental care.** This could be done by analyzing data from the Spanish Family Budget Survey or other relevant sources to identify the socioeconomic factors that are associated with catastrophic OOP-D.


4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions to reduce catastrophic OOP-D for dental care.** This could be done by conducting randomized controlled trials or other rigorous study designs to compare the effectiveness of different interventions, such as expanding dental coverage, providing financial assistance to low-income households, or implementing oral health promotion programs.


5. **Develop and validate a tool to measure the financial burden of dental care.** This could be done by conducting a qualitative study to identify the factors that contribute to the financial burden of dental care, and then developing and validating a tool that can be used to measure this burden.
