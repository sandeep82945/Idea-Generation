    "abstractText": "The increasing demand for medical cannabis urges the development of new and effective methods for the extraction of phytocannabinoids. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are an alternative to the use of hazardous organic solvents typically used in the industry. In this study, hydrophilic and hydrophobic DESs were developed based on terpenes, sugars, and natural organic acids as green extraction media for the extraction of cannabis bioactive compounds. The factors influencing the extraction of bioactive components, such as the type of DESs and extraction time, were investigated. Initial screening in hemp showed that the DES composed of Men: Lau (a 2:1-M ratio) had a greater extraction efficiency of cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) (11.07 \u00b1 0.37 mg/g) of all the tested DESs and higher than ethanol. Besides having a higher or equivalent extraction yield as the organic solvents tested, DESs showed to be more selective, extracting fewer impurities, such as chlorophyll and waxes. These results, coupled with the non-toxic, biodegradable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly characteristics of DESs, provide strong evidence that DESs represent a better alternative to organic solvents.",

Duarte1,2*\n1 LAQV/REQUIMTE, Chemistry Department, NOVA School of Science and Technology, Monte de Caparica, Portugal, 2 DES Solutio, Torres Vedras, Portugal, 3 Clever Leaves Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal\nThe increasing demand for medical cannabis urges the development of new and effective methods for the extraction of phytocannabinoids. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are an alternative to the use of hazardous organic solvents typically used in the industry. In this study, hydrophilic and hydrophobic DESs were developed based on terpenes, sugars, and natural organic acids as green extraction media for the extraction of cannabis bioactive compounds. The factors influencing the extraction of bioactive components, such as the type of DESs and extraction time, were investigated. Initial screening in hemp showed that the DES composed of Men: Lau (a 2:1-M ratio) had a greater extraction efficiency of cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) (11.07 \u00b1 0.37 mg/g) of all the tested DESs and higher than ethanol. Besides having a higher or equivalent extraction yield as the organic solvents tested, DESs showed to be more selective, extracting fewer impurities, such as chlorophyll and waxes. These results, coupled with the non-toxic, biodegradable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly characteristics of DESs, provide strong evidence that DESs represent a better alternative to organic solvents.\nKeywords: Cannabis sativa, green extraction, deep eutectic solvents, cannabinoids, plant extracts\nINTRODUCTION\nCannabis is one of the world\u2019s oldest cultivated and widely distributed plants (1). Historically, cannabis plants were cultivated for two main applications: as a medicine in Asia, mainly in India, and for fibers, which were used for the production of textiles, especially in the western world (2\u20134). The numerous years of cultivation and selection lead to the production of a wide range of varieties and hybridizations. Due to that, cannabis taxonomy is still an ongoing debate, and the classification of the different varieties can be based on plant phytochemistry. The chemotaxonomy of the plants is based on the ratio between 19- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the cannabidiol (CBD), since the ratio between these molecules remains constant throughout the plant\u2019s life. Different chemotypes range from plants that contain 19-THC as the predominant cannabinoid to plants that contain CBD as the predominant cannabinoid and to a variety of mixtures of the two (5). Based on\nFrontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 1 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 892314\nthis classification, it is possible to differentiate both, hemp, the fiber-type plants and marijuana or medical cannabis, referring to drug-type plants (6). European industrial hemp has 0.2\u20130.3% THC levels and higher levels of CBD (Type III), while drug-type contains 5\u20130% or more THC (Type I or Type II).\nWith the current changes in cannabis policies and new legislation for its medical use and cultivation, in the last 20 years, cannabis has been witnessing a revival, and, nowadays, domesticated forms of cannabis are spread and cultivated all over the world, exclusively for industrial purposes (5). These political changes led to the opening of a new sector of business due to the industrial and therapeutic potential of cannabis (7, 8).\nCannabis is a psychoactive plant that contains more than 500 different chemical compounds, of which cannabinoids are the main constituents (9, 10). These molecules are produced through the secondary metabolism, and their concentration varies between the different subspecies, age, harvesting time, and growing conditions (9). Cannabinoids, also referred to as phytocannabinoids, are a group of C21, or C22, considering the carboxylated forms, terpenophenolic compounds mainly produced in cannabis (9, 10). They are present in other plant genus, such as Radula and Helichrysum, but the knowledge of these sources is still very limited (1). In cannabis, these compounds are produced and accumulated in the glandular trichomes located in the aerial parts of the plant and are present in higher density on the female flowers (11).\nBiosynthesis of cannabinoids happens along with cannabis secondary metabolism and starts with the bond between geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and olivetolic acid, creating cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). From this precursor, specific enzymes derivate other cannabinoids acids as cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and 19-tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA) that can be converted non-enzymatically into their decarboxylated forms, cannabidiol (CBD), and 19-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), respectively, either by light or heat, while in storage or when combusted (9). The most well-known conversion is from the not-psychoactive 19- THCA to the psychoactive compound 19-THC by smoking, a process that makes cannabis inflorescences a drug-related substance. 19-THC can be then oxidized to form cannabinol (CBN). Because THC and CBD are the major cannabinoids present in cannabis, they are the most studied and interesting compounds of the class (12).\nTraditionally, the extraction of cannabinoids is performed using organic solvents, including hydrocarbons (e.g., hexane) and alcohols (e.g., ethanol, methanol). This method of extraction is cheap, easy to operate, and does not require sophisticated equipment; however, the solvents used are flammable, toxic, and non-biodegradable, risking human health, besides having a huge environmental impact (13). Extraction using these solvents can be efficient but depending on the final product, can impact regulation, and require additional testing. For instance, residual solvent is strictly regulated and must be defined for medicines under good manufacturing practice. These solvents due to their toxicity, environmental risk, and flammability are less desirable for large scale extractions (14).\nOther alternatives based on green chemistry have been pursued. Particularly, due to the drawbacks associated with\nexisting processes, the demand for methods that have high extraction yields, low cost, with potential for scale-up production and environmentally friendly persists.\nDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a new class of green solvents and have received great attention as extraction media. DESs, introduced in the beginning of the 21st century, are prepared by simply mixing at least one hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) with one hydrogen bond donor (HBD) at an appropriate molar ratio to form a eutectic mixture (15). The strong bonding between HBA and HBD is the most important parameter in the formation of these systems (15). This interaction results in a depression of the melting point of the system relative to its initial components. This simple process of manufacture makes industrial scale production possible without the need for complex facilities and specialized handwork; this method does not need solvents and produces no waste or by-products (16). DESs are, hence, attractive candidates for solvents due to their inherent properties, for example, short preparation time, easy storage, low cost, non-flammability, and high capacity of solvation (15, 17). Besides, DESs have other advantages, including high-thermal and electrochemical stabilities (15).\nThe majority of DESs proposed so far are based on renewable resources, such as carboxylic and amino acids, sugars, amines, representing a new generation of green solvents (18, 19). These DESs based on natural compounds are known as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), resulting in low toxicity and biodegradable solutions (19). Depending on the formulation, some NADES can dissolve natural or synthetic chemicals with different polarities. Additionally, because they are composed of natural metabolites, it makes them theoretically fully biocompatible, being a greener alternative candidate for concepts and applications involving some organic solvents and ionic liquids (19).\nTo date, numerous articles detailing the use of these solvents as extraction (phenolic acids, flavonoids, and polyphenols) and separation media (dissolving lignocelluloses, separation of an azeotropic mixture, and solid-liquid extraction) are reported in the literature (20\u201322). The extraction of a solid sample involves the transfer of the analyte to the liquid phase through diffusion or solvation- desorption mechanisms, and the selection of the solvent used depends on the characteristics of the matrix and the analyte. Satisfactory results have been obtained by optimization of the extraction parameters (such as time, sample mass, and extraction solvent volume), in combination with the use of green techniques, such as ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE).\nPublications have already shown the potential of NADES as extraction media to obtain phytocannabinoids (13, 18). However, they do not evaluate the extraction of other bioactive compounds, neither do they evaluate if the solvents affect the bioactivity of the cannabinoids extracted. This work aims to compare the performance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic DES by developing green DESs that allow the effective extraction of cannabinoids and other bioactive agents from Cannabis sativa L. and further promote their bioactivity for potential therapeutic applications.\nFrontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 892314"

            "text": "The determination of the physico-chemical properties of DESs is extremely important since they have a significant influence on the solvent properties, affecting solvents suitability for specific applications. Thus, polarity, water content, density, and viscosity of the prepared systems were determined.\nExperimental data on polarity obtained using Nile red as a probe and the water content measured by the Karl Fischer titrator are shown in Table 2.\nNile red is a molecule whose florescence is influenced by the polarity of where it is dissolved. The polarity evaluation of Men:StA could not be assessed since this measurement is performed at room temperature at which the solvent is in the solid state, making it impossible to read on the spectrophotometer. The higher the ETNR value, the more nonpolar the solvent is. The polarity values in Table 2 allowed us to distinguish the prepared DESs in two groups: hydrophilic (Low ETNR) and hydrophobic (High ETNR). Comparing the results, Lac:Gluc is the most polar solvent, followed by Pro:Lac, Bet:Lac, Men:Lac, Men:Lau, and Men:MyA, the least polar. These values are in consistence with the amount of water present in the solvents. Men:Lac presented the highest water content of all DESs; this is easily explained by the use of Lactic acid (85%) in the composition of the system, which rises the water present in the solvent, decreasing ETNR, making it slightly more polar than the other hydrophobic DESs.\nThe determination of density and viscosity was carried out at atmospheric pressure from 293.15 to 338.15 K. Due to their high viscosity, it has not been possible to determine the viscosity in the whole range of temperatures for all of them.\nTABLE 2 | Experimental water content (%) and polarity (ET NR) of the DESs:Betaine lactic acid Bet:Lac (1:2), lactic acid glucose Lac:Gluc (5:1), proline lactic acid Pro:Lac (1:1), menthol lactic acid Men:Lac (2:1), menthol lauric acid (2:1), menthol myristic acid Men:MyA (4:1), and menthol stearic acid.\nDESs Water Content (%) ETNR(Kcal/mol)\nBet:Lac 6.7 \u00b1 0.8 50.16\nLac:Gluc 9.0 \u00b1 0.6 44.67\nPro:Lac 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 49.58\nMen:Lac 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 51.80\nMen:Lau 0.1 \u00b1 0.01 53.34\nMen:MyA 0.1 \u00b1 0.02 53.34\nMen:StA 0.2 \u00b1 0.02 \u2013\nComposition of DES is expressed in molar ratios.\nFrontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 892314\nResults are shown in Tables 3, 4. The extraction efficiency is substantially influenced by the level of solvent penetration into the biomass structure; the lower the solvent density is, the more effective is its penetration into the raw material\u2019s matrix (28). Experimental density values listed in Table 3 showed that, for all the tested systems, the increase in temperature resulted in the decrease of density. The amino acid-based DESs presented the highest density values, while menthol-based DESs presented the lowest. At 60\u25e6C, temperature at which extraction was performed Lac:Gluc presented the highest density, followed by Pro:Lac, Bet:Lac, Men:Lac, Men:Lau, and Men:StA as the lowest. From the viewpoint of the efficiency of penetration into the biomass, it can be supposed that Lac:Gluc would be the least effective.\nThe high viscosity of DESs can make them difficult to handle in industrial processes during processing and filtration, even though it sharply decreases when temperature increases (28). Experimental viscosity data, reported in Table 4, showed that, with an increase of temperature, a decrease on viscosity was observed. The hydrophilic DESs presented the highest viscosity, being Pro:Lac the more viscous of all systems. At 60\u25e6C, Pro:Lac presented the highest viscosity, followed by Pro:Lac, Bet:Lac, Men:Lac, and Men:Lau, as the lowest. These high values at this\ntemperature could result in a less-effective extraction process due to problems in mass transfer and, therefore, a lower extraction yield."

The symbol * means that there are statistical differences between Men:Lau and EtOH.\nMen:MyA, and Men:StA). In summary, the best result for the hydrophobic DES was obtained for Men:lau (11.07 \u00b1 0.4 mg/g), and, for the hydrophilic ones, Pro:lac (6.1 \u00b1 0.3 mg/g) was the best solvent. These results indicate that the interactions between DESs and target compounds affect the extraction ability of DESs. This effect could be accounted for two reasons: among other characteristics, polarity is one of the most important properties, and it is a key indicator of the DESs dissolving capability (13). Hydrophilic systems are polar solvents, while cannabinoids are non-polar molecules; these differences in polarity result in fewer interactions between the solvent and the target compounds, resulting in a poor extractability and subsequent less-concentrated extracts. In the case of hydrophobic systems, the similar polarities allow a higher affinity with the target compounds, resulting in a greater extraction yield. Another reason is the viscosity of the systems; hydrophilic systems are more viscous than menthol-based hydrophobic systems. The increase of viscosity influence on the effectiveness of the separation process is due to the decrease of the mass transfer (29).\nIn this work, a soxhlet extraction with ethanol was performed both to characterize the plant and compare the extraction efficacy of this solvent with the tested DESs under the same extraction conditions. The extraction efficiency of Men-Lau (11.07 \u00b1 0.4 mg/g) has demonstrated to exceed the performance of ethanol (8.19\u00b1 1.7 mg/g).\nThe statistical analysis of the extraction performance showed statistically significant differences between Men:Lau and ethanol (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Turkeys multiple comparisons analysis did not show significant differences between ethanol and Men:Lac, Men:MyA, and Men:StA, (p > 0.05). These results demonstrate that hydrophobic DESs are equally effective as ethanol. Based on these results, Men:Lau, with the greatest overall extraction efficiency, should be selected for the extraction of CBD and CBDA from hemp.\nV\u00e1gi E. et al. (30) showed the effect of supercritical CO2 on the extraction of cannabinoids from hemp. The extracts obtained\ncontained 1.63\u20137.88 mg/g d.m. of CBD and 1.01\u201316.60 mg/g d.m. of CBDA (30). Our extraction yields using DESs are between these values, proving the efficiency of this extraction method. It is also important to notice that these extractions with DESs were carried out without further optimization."

The kinetic curves allowed to understand the efficacy of the extraction through time and optimize the processing time as the extractions need to be short to decrease costs. The results showed that, for Bet:Lac, Lac:Gluc, and Pro:Lac, the extraction yield increased from 15 to 60 min, and then varied little with time. Similar results were observed by Changyong Cai et al. (13). Therefore, the extraction time should be 60 min. For Men:Lac, Men:Lau, Men:MyA, and Men:StA, the extraction yield varied little after 30 min of extraction. Therefore, the extraction time, in this case, should be 45 min. These systems allow a higher extraction yield in a shorter time frame, being preferable for industrial applications."

The TPC in the hydrophobic DESs was not possible to assess due to the incompatibility of the method with the presence of menthol as the protocol used led to the formation of a precipitate, making it impossible to get an accurate measurement. However, since phenolic compounds are polar molecules, their extraction yield with the menthol-based DESs is expected to be very low. As it can be seen, the solvent used affected the extraction of TPC. Among all the tested DESs, the best performance was observed for Lac:Gluc (7.76 \u00b1 1.1 mg GAE/g). From the results reported, it can be assumed that an increase of the polarity of the solvent has a positive effect on the TPC, as the highest value was obtained for Lac:Gluc, which has the highest polarity and the higher water content. These results are in accordance with the literature. The phenolic compounds possess higher polarity when compared with cannabinoids and terpenes due the higher ratio oxygen/carbon. These differences in polarity make the phenolic fraction less soluble into ethanol, which, instead, is non-polar. As a result, the phenolic compounds are only partially extracted with ethanol (0.26 \u00b1 0.02 mg GAE/g), which is richer in non-polar compounds, such as cannabinoids (31). Lac:Gluc also presented the lowest viscosity of all systems; this factor could also facilitate the mass transfer phenomena and improve the extraction yield.\nThe results also demonstrate that we can have different selectivities for TPC according to the composition of the DESs. Lac:Gluc extraction conditions could also be optimized for a higher extraction yield."

From these results, it can be assumed that an increase of the ETNR polarity of the solvent, on the contrary, of the total phenolics has a negative effect on the TFC as the highest value was obtained for EtOH (32.25 \u00b1 4.1 mg QE/g extract), which is the less polar of the tested solvents.

This technique could not be used for the identification of terpenes in the hydrophobic extracts.

While waxes are useful for plants, they are often an undesirable byproduct of extraction, since they decrease the purity of the extracts and increase the overall cost of extraction with the addition of purification steps (33). In this work, we evaluated the wax extraction capability of all DESs tested and compared with ethanol. The results obtained from the wax quantification (%) are presented in Figure 5. Men:StA extracts could not be used for the waxes quantification, since, at the winterization temperature, the extracts became solid, making it impracticable for waxes to precipitate.\nThe results showed once again a significant difference between hydrophobic and hydrophilic DESs. Hydrophilic DESs extracted more waxes, being the highest value obtained for Pro:Lac (12.46% \u00b1 0.2), while hydrophobic extracted the lowest, being Men:Lac the DES, which extracted the least (1.19% \u00b1 0.05). Ethanol showed a behavior very similar to the hydrophilic DESs, having the second highest extraction value (7.75% \u00b1 2.2). These results can strongly be correlated with the polarity of the solvents, where a higher polarity can lead to a higher interaction of the solvent with the waxes, increasing the solubility and leading to a higher extraction.

Overall, DESs are much more ineffective in chlorophyll extraction when compared to ethanol, showing its selectivity in the extraction process. Menthol-based DESs extracted the highest amount of CHL among all DESs tested. The low polarity of these systems makes them able to extract more fat-soluble molecules, such as CHL.

The results are presented in Table 6.\nAll the hemp extracts before and after winterization showed concentration-dependent increase in radical scavenging capacity. Among all the samples before winterization, the greatest DPPH radical scavenging potency was recorded for Pro:Lac, followed by the systems Lac:Glu and Bet:Lac.

Comparing the extracts with ascorbic acid, which was used as control, the DES Pro:Lac has shown similar IC50 values. The analysis of DPPH scavenging activity results indicated that sugar and amino acid-based DES were the most effective DPPH radical scavengers, explained by the presence of bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, in the extracts, which have a significant antioxidant activity. Even though Pro:Lac did not have the highest TPC and TFC content, they can be richer in other bioactives with antioxidant activity, such as terpenes, which could explain their low IC50; in this work, the quantitative analysis of these compounds was not performed (37). After winterization, the IC50 increased, which could be related to the loss of antioxidant compounds during winterization.\nThe results of radical scavenging activity of the pure DESs showed that DESs have very little effect on the DPPH assay results, providing evidence that the effects are due to the bioactive compounds extracted.\nTABLE 6 | The IC50 values of DPPH scavenging effect of hemp extracts (mg/L).\nIC50 mg/L\nBefore winterization After winterization\nBet:Lac 337.3 \u00b1 37.2 337.3 \u00b1 37.8\nLac:Gluc 226.7 \u00b1 16.4 337 \u00b1 4.5\nPro:Lac 120.2 \u00b1 10.1 112 \u00b1 9.8\nMen:Lac 626.8 \u00b1 19.9 696.7 \u00b1 140.4\nMen:Lau 670.6 \u00b1 37.1 851.1 \u00b1 344\nMen:MyA 773. \u00b1 122.3 792.3 \u00b1 30.1\nMen:StA 1689.6 \u00b1 167.1 \u2013\nAscorbic Acid 104.5 \u00b1 4.9"

            "text": "Poor aqueous solubility of the terpenophenolic compound cannabidiol (CBD) is a major issue in the widespread use of this therapeutic molecule (38). As previously described, cannabinoids are highly lipophilic, resulting in very low solubility in water, which has been described in the literature to range between 2 and 10 \u00b5g/ml (39). Consequently, these compounds are not readily absorbed, and, therefore, a large dosage is required to have medical effect, presenting a major problem for product design and formulation, besides the costs associated. The development of aqueous solubility-enhanced formulations may lead to higher CBD absorption. DESs comprising or acting as solvents of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API-DESs) have been used to design polymeric drug delivery system, overcome polymorphism, enhance a dissolution rate, increase membrane permeability, and improve transdermal delivery (16). In Figure 7, the solubility values of CBD and CBDA in PBS at 37\u25e6C to simulate the physiologic conditions using the tested DESs are represented. Hydrophilic DESs present a higher CBD + CBDA solubility in PBS when compared to cannabis oil and hydrophobic DESs. Lac:Gluc and Pro:Lac presented the highest solubility of all tested DESs. These systems are capable of dissolving in PBS, acting like a carrier for cannabinoids and increasing its solubility. Hydrophobic systems, on the other hand, did not improve the solubilization of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids generally have good solubility in triglyceride lipid bases, allowing for easy solubilization in lipid formulations; since they are more stable in this phase, they do not transfer to PBS.\nThe statistical analysis of the solubility values showed statistically significant differences between the different solvents (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05); Lac:Gluc and Pro:Lac showed to be statistically different from EtOH (Turkey\u2019s multiple comparisons test, p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that these two systems can, in fact, enhance the solubilization of CBD and CBDA in PBS."

            "text": "In this study, seven DESs were developed as greener solution media for the UAE of cannabinoids and other main bioactive\nFrontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 892314\ncompounds from hemp. Moreover, DESs were evaluated not only as solvents but also as agents to improve the bioactivity of the target compounds.\nThe first extraction screening in hemp showed that menthol-based hydrophobic DESs showed to be more efficient in the extraction of cannabinoids. Hydrophilic systems presented low cannabinoid extractability; however, they were able to extract important antioxidant compounds, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and terpenes. Lac:Gluc had the highest TPC values (7.76 \u00b1 1.1 mg/g) and TFC among all DESs. When comparing the extraction results with ethanol, Men:Lau was the one who presented the highest yield of CBD and CBDA (11.07 \u00b1 0.4 mg/g). These systems also proved to be more selective, reducing the extraction of undesirable compounds, such as chlorophyll and waxes.\nBioactivity assays showed that Lac:Gluc and Pro:Lac also improve the solubility of CBD and CBDA in aqueous media. Therefore, the results of this study prove that DESs are selective green solvents, with huge potential for use in industrial applications, involving the extraction of bioactive compounds, and can further enhance the bioavailability of the active components."
