The aim of our study was to investigate whether activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7)-Smad2/3 pathway plays an important role in VSMC apoptosis of diabetic atherosclerosis. It was shown that ALK7 expression was obviously elevated in the aorta of ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of ALK7 expression significantly improved the stability of atherosclerotic plaques and reduced cell apoptosis. Further experiments showed that ALK7 knockdown stabilized atherosclerotic plaques by reducing VSMC apoptosis via activating Smad2/3.

            "text": "Atherosclerosis remains the major pathogenesis of ischemic heart diseases and stroke, which represents a leading cause of death worldwide (Weber and Noels, 2011; Hopkins, 2013; Poznyak et al., 2020). In recent years, the important role of diabetes mellitus as risk factor for atherosclerosis becomes more typical and clear. Coexistence of diabetes sophisticates the incidence, distribution and severity of atherosclerosis, leading to increased vulnerability of plaques and more severe clinical events (Moreno and Fuster, 2004; Yuan et al., 2019; Lien et al., 2021). However, there are no effective therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic atherosclerosis.\nIt is well-accepted that plaque vulnerability is determined by the collagen, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), lipid and macrophages. VSMCs, the major component of fibrillar cap, play quite the opposite role in the development of plaque (Bennett et al., 2016; Miano et al., 2021). During the early stage of plaque, less VSMC apoptosis results in their accumulation in the intima and media, in favor of the remodeling of atherosclerotic arteries (Ahmadi et al., 2019). While in the late stage of plaque, increased VSMC apoptosis can give rise to thinner fibrillar cap, immensely influencing plaque stability and causing increased possibility of its rupture (Leskinen et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2006). Excessive VSMC apoptosis was especially evident in the progression of diabetic atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism underlying VSMC apoptosis remains unclear and needs further exploration.\nActivin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7), firstly isolated from rat brain as an orphan receptor, belongs to the type I TGF receptor superfamily (Ryd\u00e9n et al., 1996; Tsuchida et al., 1996). It is composed of a transmembrane domain, a serine/threonine kinases domain and a glycine-serine-rich (GS) linker between them, and extracellular ligand domain (Tsuchida et al., 2008). ALK7 possesses serine/threonine kinase activity, and is widely expressed in endocrine tissues, such as islet, adipose, which is also detected in brain, liver, heart (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2021). The interaction of ALK7 with its ligands is relatively weak and is mainly recruited to form a complex with activin type II receptor (ActRII) and phosphorylated by ActRII, signaling to a series of downstream substrates, including Smads proteins (Greenwald et al., 2003). ALK7, a major modulator of metabolic homeostasis (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2021), was reported to play an important role in diabetic associated cardiomyopathy, aortic stiffness and retinopathy (Liu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2020).Moreover, ALK7 exerted its proapoptotic role on various cells in diabetic conditions, such as osteoblasts, retinal pigment epithelial cells (Shi et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2021). It was also reported that ALK7 acted as a positive regulator of atherosclerosis via activating macrophage, exacerbating plaque vulnerability (Cheng et al., 2021). Whether ALK7 was involved in VSMC apoptosis caused by diabetic atherosclerosis needs further exploration.\nIn the present study, we fed ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice with high fat diet and inject one low-dose streptozotocin to mimic diabetic\natherosclerosis and determined to explore the role of ALK7regulated VSMC apoptosis on the vulnerability of diabetic atherosclerosis and its underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that ALK7 promoted VSMC apoptosis and exacerbated diabetic atherosclerosis via Smad2/3 signaling pathway, providing a new therapeutic target for stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques in diabetes mellitus."

Results showed that both of the mRNA and protein level of ALK7 were elevated in the aortas with atherosclerotic lesions of diabetic group (Figures 1A\u2013C). Moreover, we found that ALK7 was greatly elevated and extensively distributed in the atherosclerotic plaques of aortic root in the diabetic group (Figures 1D,E). These findings implicated ALK7 acting as a potential regulator in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherosclerosis.\nFIGURE 1 ALK7was increased in the aortas with atherosclerotic lesions of diabetic mice.

As expected, the protein level of ALK7 was obviously reduced when ALK7 was knocked down (Figures 2A,B). En face analysis using Oil Red O staining showed that ALK7 inhibition significantly decreased the number of atherosclerotic plaques along the aortic tree in the diabetic group (Figures 2C,D). Moreover,\nALK7 deficiency obviously reduced the increased size of plaque and I/M ratio in the diabetic group (Figures 2E\u2013G). However, ALK7 knockdown exerted no significant influence on glucose and lipid metabolism of diabetic mice (Supplementary Table S1).\nWe subsequently examined the effect of ALK7 inhibition on the atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. It was shown that there were more \u03b1-SMA-positive cells and collagen, and less MOMA2-positive cells and lipids in the atherosclerotic plaque of aorta in the diabetic group with ALK7-shRNA lentivirus delivery (Figures 3A\u2013E). As a result, ALK7 deficiency dramatically decreased the plaque vulnerability index in the diabetic group (Figure 3F).\nFIGURE 2 Knockdown of ALK7 reduced atherosclerotic plaque burden of diabetic mice.

Besides, cleaved caspase 3 was reduced in the diabetic group with ALK7 knockdown (Figures 4A,B).\nThen we added high glucose and palmitic acid to VSMCs to mimic diabetic atherosclerosis in vivo (Reddy et al., 2016) and found that co-treatment of high glucose and palmitic acid significantly upregulated the expression of ALK7, taking on time-dependent manner and being not influenced by the osmotic pressure (Supplementary Figure S2).

It was shown that phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was induced greatly in the diabetic group, which was reduced by the knockdown of ALK7 (Figures 5A,B). Similarly, high glucose and palmitic acid treatment obviously increased the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in the VSMCs, which was efficiently reversed by ALK7 inhibition (Figures 5C,D). Moreover, application of Smad2/3 inhibitor significantly decreased VSMC apoptosis caused by high glucose and palmitic acid co-treatment (Figures 5E,F; Supplementary Figure S4). However, ALK7 overexpression exerted no significant impact on the inhibition of VSMC apoptosis by Smad2/3 inhibitor (Figures 5C,D)."

            "text": "In this study, we found that ALK7 was elevated in the atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice. Inhibiting ALK7 expression stabilized atherosclerotic plaques and reduced VSMC apoptosis. Furthermore, ALK7 exerted its proapoptotic role via Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Our findings indicated ALK7 might be a potential target for alleviating diabetic atherosclerosis.\nThe coexistence of diabetes aggravates the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in the increased incidence and severity of clinical events, even death (Moreno and Fuster, 2004; Yuan et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). However, there are no effective therapies in this field. ALK7 was initially reported to play a crucial role in fat metabolism and other metabolic disturbance, such as diabetes (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2021). The key role of ALK7 in diabetes and atherosclerosis respectively promoted us to further explore its role in diabetic atherosclerosis (Liu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). As expected, we found elevated ALK7 expression in the atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic mice and made clear that suppression of ALK7 could generate beneficial effects via inhibiting the progress of diabetic atherosclerosis, as indicated by the decreased plaque load and\narea along the aortic tree. Our findings fully testify ALK7 as an important modulator and potential therapeutic target in diabetic atherosclerosis.\nThere are different degrees of abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Gade et al., 2010). In the present study, we found that ALK7 exerted no significant effects on the level of serum lipids and glucose. Histological staining of aortic roots presented decreased index of vulnerable plaques in diabetic group with administration of ALK7-shRNA lentivirus. Therefore, we speculated ALK7 might exert its crucial impacts beyond metabolic regulation. Increased VSMC apoptosis brings about thinner fibrillar cap, destabilizes atherosclerotic plaques and promotes plaque rupture (Silva et al., 1995; Paneni et al., 2013). We innovatively demonstrated the promotion of ALK7 on VSMC apoptosis, suggesting ALK7 acted as a potential regulator of VSMCs. Recently, ALK7 was reported to promote VSMC phenotypic modulation induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB via inhibiting PPAR\u03b3 expression in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia (Gong et al., 2020). Our findings about ALK7 in aggravating VSMC apoptosis of diabetic atherosclerosis expanded action of ALK7 on the biological characteristics of VSMCs.\nThe Smads family is a group of transcription factors that transmit TGF-beta-regulated signals directly from cell surface receptors to the nucleus, controlling a range of biological activities, such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation (Derynck et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1999; Budi et al., 2017). Among them, Smad2/3 are receptor-activated Smad proteins that can be activated by the type I Activin receptors (ALK4/5/7) (Massagu\u00e9, 1998) (Siegel and Massagu\u00e9, 2003). In this study, the elevated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in VSMCs cocultured with high glucose and palmitic acid was significantly inhibited by ALK7 knockdown, indicating Smad2/3 as the downstream of ALK7. Moreover, ALK7 overexpression could not alleviate the anti-apoptotic effect of Smad2/3 inhibitors, further confirming that ALK7 regulated VSMCs apoptosis via Smad2/3 signaling. Our findings were consistent with other studies that ALK7 can regulate cell apoptosis through Smad2/3 (Xu et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013).\nTo sum up, our study demonstrated that interfering ALK7 expression significantly increased the stability of atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, ALK7 was involved in the regulation of VSMC apoptosis via Smad2/3 signaling pathway, indicating ALK7 as a vital target in the treatment of diabetic atherosclerosis."
