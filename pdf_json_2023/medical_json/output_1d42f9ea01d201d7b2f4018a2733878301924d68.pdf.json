    "abstractText": "Background: Long-lasting crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, require proper interim evaluation in order to optimize response. The World Health Organization and the European Center for Disease Control have recently promoted the in(tra)-action review (IAR) method for this purpose. We systematically evaluated the added value of two IARs performed in the Dutch point of entry (PoE) setting. Methods: Two online, 4-hour IAR meetings were organized in March 2021, for ports and airports respectively, to reflect on the ongoing COVID-19 response. Topics discussed were selected through a survey among participants. Participants were mainly self-selected by the (air)port public health service. Evaluation of the IAR method consisted of participant evaluation through a questionnaire, and hot and cold debriefs of the organizing team. Evaluation of the impact of the IAR was done through analysis of the meeting results, and a 3-month follow-up of the actions proposed during the meetings. Results: Thirty-nine professionals joined the IAR meetings. In the participant evaluation (n = 18), 89% agreed or totally agreed the IAR made it possible to identify challenges and problems in the COVID-19 response at PoE. Participants especially appreciated the resulting insight in regional and national partners. Regarding the online setting of the meeting, participants suggested to choose accessible and familiar online tools. After 3 months, all national actions and actions for ports had been executed; some regional actions for airports required further attention. A major result was a new meeting structure for all ports and the participating national authorities in which remaining and newly occurring issues were discussed. Conclusions: Based on the evaluations, we conclude that the IAR method can be of value during long-term crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic response. Although it is challenging to dedicate time and effort to the organization and attendance of IAR meetings during crisis, the IAR method is feasible in an online setting if appropriate organizing and technical capacity is available. A participatory set-up supports the IAR method as a starting point for continuous exchange and learning during ongoing crises.",

However, as stated in the International Health Regulations (IHR), \u201cunnecessary interference with international *Correspondence: doret.de.rooij@rivm.nl\n2 Athena Institute, Free University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\ntravel and trade\u201d should be avoided [1]. This international aim has implications for local operations. Although the interference in international travel and trade depends on decisions made on country level, it should be dealt with locally at points of entry (PoE) \u2013 airports, ports and ground-crossings. It is in these local settings that stakeholders represent different interests, all working towards both healthy, safe and ongoing travel and trade. Therefore, a tailor-made approach is desired in scarce but impactful crises such as pandemics [2], leading to a complex but crucial cooperation among stakeholders at PoE [3\u20136].\nTo support efficient responses at PoE, core capacity requirements for designated PoE are explicitly stated in the IHR. The status of the implementation of these capacities should be reported yearly in the Electronic State Parties Self-Assessment Tool (e-SPAR). Core capacity implementation for PoE has been one of the lowest scored indicators in the e-SPAR [7]. The transport and public health sectors have made extensive preparedness efforts on (inter)national and local level to prepare PoE to deal with outbreaks [8\u201312]. Still, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the response to a pandemic is challenging, can lead to severe interference in international travel and trade [13\u201317], and creates high demands for cross-sectoral collaboration.\nUsually after a crisis, reflection and evaluation programs such as after action reviews (AAR) are performed. Based on AAR results adjustments in the preparedness plans and practice to further improve preparedness and response [18, 19]. However, waiting till after a crisis may be insufficient while dealing with challenges during a crisis, especially if the crisis is long-lasting. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) have lately developed methods for in- or intra-action reviews (IAR) [20, 21]. The IAR aims to perform a quick evaluation and reflection during a crisis on national or subnational levels, bringing forth the lessons, best practices and most important needs to support the response that is ongoing. Serving the crisis situation with limited time and preparation, the IAR should be a fast and hands-on method that can be used for learning and improvement during a crisis.\nThe National Institute of Public Health & the Environment (RIVM), which is also designated as IHR National Focal Point for The Netherlands, conducted two IARs focused on the COVID-19 response; one for stakeholders involved at Dutch seaports and one for Dutch airports. As the IAR is a fairly new methodology, we evaluate the two IARs in the Netherlands, based on the research question: How does the IAR methodology support enhanced, ongoing response to COVID-19 at POE? To answer this question, we first describe the methodology of the IAR\nfor this specific context. Secondly, we evaluate the impact of the IARs on the COVID-19 response through the IAR session results, recommendations and experiences from participants. Thirdly, we report on the follow up of actions in the response among participants after a 12-week period. We end the study with recommendations resulting from our experience on the IAR methodology."

Here discussion topics and participants were identified based on input via a questionnaire (design). Next, two 4-hour online meetings were prepared for partners at ports and airports respectively (prepare). During these meetings, best practices, lessons and needs were exchanged and actions for the near future were formulated (execute). Results were shared among the participants and national and international partners to exchange results and experiences with the IAR method (report). After the IAR the meetings were evaluated among participants, as were the recommended actions after 3 months (evaluate). An overview of these steps can be found in Table\u00a01. In the subsequent section, we present the public health context in which these IARs took place, and elaborate on the methodology for each of the five steps."

In the context of the IHR, the Netherlands has two designated \u2018A-PoE\u2019: Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and the Port of Rotterdam. In addition, four other airports and 15 other sea ports process substantial international travel and therefore have a national status as \u2018B-PoE\u2019 [23]. At both ports and airports, the day-to-day infectious disease control is carried out by the regional Public Health Services (PHS). The legislative tasks of the PHS and PoE authorities are described in the Dutch Public Health Law [24], which incorporates the IHR requirements [1]. The PHS are supported by national guidelines developed by the RIVM. The RIVM also coordinates the public health response during severe communicable disease outbreaks, and can be consulted by the PHS. The PoE authorities and PHS collaborate with the Safety Region, responsible for preparedness and the management of crises, disasters and disruptions of public order [25]. The public health measures on a national level - as for COVID-19 - are imposed by the national government and implemented by the respective ministerial departments.\nThe IARs were conducted on 11 and 18 March 2021, during a period of widespread and increasing community transmission of COVID-19 in the Netherlands; the so-called \u201cthird COVID-19 wave\u201d . Several public health safety measures were in place for the general population and at PoE in particular, such as mandatory self-quarantine and isolation, and mandatory testing before entering the country. Shops, bars, and restaurants were closed and a nightly curfew was in place. A flight ban for travelers coming from South Africa and several Latin American countries was in place, while a flight ban and a mooring ban for travelers coming from the United Kingdom was just lifted on March 9. Travelers coming from \u201chigh risk countries\u201d were obligated to show both a negative PCR and a negative antigen test before entering the country [26]."

These PHS were asked to further recruit participants by inviting key partners in the COVID19 response at their respective PoE through their own channels. This recruitment was facilitated by a standard invitation letter and the link to an online questionnaire (Formdesk [28]). This questionnaire contained an open question who should be present at the IAR meeting. The questionnaire for ports can be found in Additional file\u00a01. Based on the input via the questionnaire, the RIVM suggested further invitations of local partners to the PHS. However, the final decision to invite these additional local partners remained up to the PHS. As the Ministry of Health (MoH) has a pivotal role in the COVID-19 response, the RIVM invited a representative as consultants during the IAR meetings."

This resulted in two major topics to be discussed during the IAR meeting. The two major topics chosen were: A - implementation of various control measures, and B - cooperation: communication, tasks, and roles. For each of these two topics, several sub-topics were listed that could further steer the direction of the discussion during the meeting.\nTable 1 Overview of the organization of the two IARs"

In addition\u00a0 to the existing ECDC and WHO guidelines on IAR methods, we developed an inventorying questionnaire during the design of the IAR. This questionnaire facilitated the input of participants, prior to the actual conduction of the IAR, regarding the most urgent topics from their point of view and suggestions for inclusion of partners in the field. In this way, we could prioritize topics before the meeting and we aimed to create support for the IAR meeting and its follow-up. The IARs identified several good practices and challenges for airport and ports. Among others, the continuity of collaboration among partners involved at PoE showed challenging due to fast growing staff numbers and changing organization structures. Other challenges include the tailor-made and timely implementation of measures amidst a continuously varying pandemic situation. A major result of the IAR for sea ports\nis the new meeting structure for involved partners in the response. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that the two 4-hour IARs with PoE proved feasible and valuable in the Netherlands, despite the extremely busy crisis context. We learned after a three-month follow-up that the exchange of experiences on an inter-regional and national level had continued beyond the IAR setting.\nThe evaluation of the IAR method produced similar results for ports and airports, with high satisfaction among participants and organizers. However, we observed better implemented actions in the port compared to the airport setting after 3 months follow-up. These differences may point out towards contextual factors outside this method that may play a role in the success of an IAR. In our study, the major difference in the results for airports and ports was the implementation of regional actions that followed from the IAR meetings. These actions were more often completed for ports than for airports. The direct consecutive meetings that took place for the ports may have attributed to this fact. During these meetings there was opportunity to further discuss and exchange about emerging situations. Also, the IAR results have been brought to the agenda several times by the RIVM that initiated the IARs and hosted these subsequent meetings. To the contrary, there was no new meeting structure introduced for the airport sector as a similar structure existed already between the MoH and PHS.\nThe discussion topics and recommended actions resulting from the IAR meetings served as the learning agenda for Dutch PoE in March 2021. Although specific needs and lessons may have changed at the moment of writing as the COVID-19 pandemic still continues, the IAR results can be of interest for PoE and national authorities in other countries. The specific challenges that one faces while trying to change practice often point towards more structural hurdles in the response. For example, the difficulty for non-designated PoE to implement measures in a tailor-made way during the COVID-19 pandemic may point out that structural attention is needed for these PoE and their role in this and future crises. Our suggestion to draw broader lessons of these results are supported by a recent study at German ports and airports, where similar important challenges are described. These include the dealing with the speed of new measures with hardly time to implement these in the specific airport\u2019s setting, and the control of compliance with measures [33].\nLiterature on in action learning or the IAR method in particular is very scarce (literature search in May 2021). The WHO and ECDC guidance documents on how to apply this method are leading [20, 21]. The lack of a body of knowledge on this method is understandable as IAR is a rather new method. Also, performing IARs\nand learning in practice rather than describing them in literature might be deemed more important during the ongoing crisis at the moment of writing. We know from WHO communication and informal communications that several European countries have been conducting IARs in the last year. Therefore, we expect and warmly invite an expanding body of knowledge on this new methodology to emerge soon.\nReflections on\u00a0the\u00a0methodology Although we based the methodology of the IARs performed on the guidance documents from ECDC and WHO [20, 21], we state our recommendations and reflect\non our choices in the application of the method in the Dutch PoE setting."

It became clear in the evaluation that meeting others in the network had been a valuable aspect of the IARs. Subsequently, we suggest to focus not only on\u00a0choosing a pillar, but also to search for areas requiring new relations and with new interdependencies among parties\u00a0compared to inter-pandemic times.\nWe integrated input of the IAR participants during the design, execution, evaluation and reporting of these IARs. We considered participatory methods valuable during the organization of these IAR, as we could focus easier during the meetings, and believe that the results mainly matter if they are corresponding to participants experiences. Previous literature shows that participatory studies and projects in general have larger impact if they are organized by people that are the end users of the results [34]. We emphasize that efficient impact is essential when focusing on learning during crisis times.\nFollow\u2011up Participatory methods may also be helpful in the followup. Both ECDC and WHO guidelines name the essence of close monitoring of follow-up dedicated to a specific person or authority. However, there is no practical guidance on how to perform this follow-up. A more step-wise approach may be helpful and should at least include considerations to what extent follow-up on recommended actions should be monitored and by whom. Especially during crisis, burden of follow-up questionnaires or forms should be minimized. Therefore, the authors of this study consider that the better the design of the IAR has been performed in a participatory manner, the better the ownership of the results by the participants will be. This potentially will lead to a better follow up of recommended actions. Creating a network of partners around an IAR can support emergent follow-up and exchange, instead of a top-down monitoring process.\nA thorough follow up after the IAR meeting would also better align with the plan-do-check-act cycle, a seminal theory of ongoing learning first introduced by William Deming. Following this approach, the implementation of recommended actions should be monitored and lead to new rounds of review whenever\nrequired. This is in line with WHO recommendations to organize series of IARs [20]."

            "text": "It was a challenge to combine the organization of the IAR with other professional duties. On average, seven people have spent two full-time working weeks with planning, preparing, performing, evaluating, reporting and follow-up of the two IARs presented in this paper. This team consisted of professionals with relevant experience to set up such a reflecting setting. The amount of time and effort invested by the team were much more substantial than suggested in the WHO guide, where there is a 1 week schedule for preparations before performing the IAR [20]. ECDC suggests brainstorming sessions that are less structured and in this sense may require less preparing time. We conclude that following these existing guidance was very helpful, but requires more preparations than described if a thoroughly prepared meeting is aimed for. It takes time to get familiar with the possibilities and choices and to develop the method in a way suiting the specific setting.\nDespite the significant organizational burden of organizing an IAR, we highly recommend to perform an IAR. First, in our experience, the COVID-19 pandemic with its unprecedented scale and impact has led to new networks of cooperation in the response. For example Never before had Dutch ports and airports been in such a situation. However, the introduction of these networks is one of many challenges that have to be solved. The IAR creates a setting to get to know the other partners, see a face, and hear their story, to develop more sense of about what is happening in other parts of the response. Second, in a long-lasting crisis such as COVID-19, time for reflection must be scheduled as delaying it until after the crisis will downgrade the relevance of current lessons and needs. Both participants and our team confirmed that it was worth the effort despite all challenges. Finally, investments made in organizing an IAR for the first time may pay off in any future IAR. Shared experienced of other IARs may be helpful in providing a wide array of effort and times connected to outcome of this particular method. Sufficient capacity for in-crisis evaluation should be anticipated upon during preparedness planning."

First, the evaluation of the IARs may have suffered from response bias during evaluations in a sense that participants enthusiastic about improving the response provide often better feedback than people that may be less satisfied or indifferent regarding changes in practice. We tried to prevent this bias by performing several evaluations, reminding all participants several times, and actively performing a follow-up evaluation of recommended actions for all participants. However, only half of the participants have responded to the evaluation questionnaire. Second, the success of this IAR may have been supported by the evaluation of the IAR. Evaluating the IAR meeting and stated actions among participants is important to evaluate the method. However, it also brings the IAR and recommended action several times to the attention of participants, potentially stimulating further action. Lastly, we promote the integration of participatory methods, but the organizing team of these IARs has been solely from the RIVM. In this way, we have not entirely practiced as we preached. Especially in the selection of national authorities for the meetings, we have insisted on \u2018our\u2019 perspective of what would result in a fruitful meeting. We considered hierarchical relations, familiarity with suggested partners, group size and topics on the agenda. However, reflecting from our experience and the existing body of literature, it is clear that collaboration among partners in the IAR during the set up and organization leads to shared responsibility, better participation, and relevant impact in practice."

            "text": "This is to our knowledge the first study reporting of a systematical evaluation of the IAR method. We based our method on WHO and ECDC guidelines and applied it in an intersectoral sample of professionals involved in the COVID-19 response at Dutch airports and ports. According to participants\u2019 and organizers\u2019 views and in line with the results in practice we conclude that the IAR method can be of added value during a crisis. We highly recommend other countries to organize IARs during the, at the time of writing, current COVID-19 pandemic or any next long-lasting crisis. Especially the participatory approach and thorough follow-up should be considered as additional steps in this method. We furthermore stress the need to share, when appropriate, specific designs and the results of their design. In this way, we can collaboratively give further shape and substance to this very promising method.\nAbbreviations AAR : After action review; ECDC: European Center for Disease Control; e-SPAR: electronic State Parties Self-Assessment Tool; IAR: In- or intra-action review; IHR: International Health Regulations; MDoH: Maritime Declaration of Health; MoH: Ministry of Health; PHS: Public Health Service; PoE: Point(s) of Entry; RIVM: National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Netherlands; WHO: World Health Organization.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12889- 022- 14706-4.\nAdditional file\u00a01.\nAdditional file\u00a02.\nAdditional file\u00a03.\nAdditional file\u00a04.\nAdditional file\u00a05.\nAdditional file\u00a06.\nAcknowledgements We sincerely thank all IAR participants for their input, collaboration and inspiration during a challenging time.
