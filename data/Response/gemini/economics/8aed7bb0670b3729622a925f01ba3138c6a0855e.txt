1. **Cost-effectiveness of early surfactant administration in low-income countries:** Explore the cost-effectiveness of early surfactant administration in low-income countries, where access to healthcare resources may be limited.

2. **Long-term economic impact of surfactant use:** Investigate the long-term economic impact of surfactant use in infants with RDS, including potential savings in healthcare costs and improved quality of life.

3. **Comparative effectiveness of different surfactant formulations:** Conduct a comparative effectiveness study to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of different surfactant formulations, such as poractant alfa, beractant, and calfactant.

4. **Impact of surfactant administration on healthcare resource utilization:** Quantify the impact of surfactant administration on healthcare resource utilization, such as length of hospital stay, need for mechanical ventilation, and use of antibiotics.

5. **Cost-benefit analysis of surfactant administration in preterm infants:** Perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine the overall economic value of surfactant administration in preterm infants, considering both the costs and benefits of treatment.
