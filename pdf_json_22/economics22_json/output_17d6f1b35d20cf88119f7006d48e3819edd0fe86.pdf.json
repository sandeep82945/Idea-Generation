            "text": "Remote interventions in mental health care, or \u201ctele-mental health\u201d have been\nimplemented for many years and evaluations often include assessment of cost-\neffectiveness. Telemental health care is defined as any interventions or modes of working\nwhere remote technology (e.g. telephone/video call/instant messaging) is used to facilitate\ndirect communication between staff and service users, between service users and peers, or\nbetween mental health professionals in different locations.\nTelemental health has the potential to result in benefits for both service users and clinicians.\nFor example, service users have identified increased flexibility as a key advantage of remote\ncare (1), and a recent rapid realist review (2) found that telemental health care can improve\naccess to mental health support for people who may struggle to travel to face-to-face\nappointments due to disability, anxiety about travel, or caring or work responsibilities.\nReported benefits for staff included an opportunity for more flexible working, less time\nspent travelling, and communicating with other clinicians at different sites (2, 3). However,\nit is important to note that telemental health is not suitable for everyone; not all service\nusers may wish for care to be remote and inequalities and digital exclusion should be taken\ninto consideration during the decision to offer mental health care remotely (1, 2). Clinicians\nhave also reported finding telemental health less suitable than face-to-face care when\ntreating trauma, or for service users in crisis or those with psychotic symptoms or severe\nanxiety (3).\nThe uptake of telemental health care increased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic as\nservices moved from largely face-to-face models of care due to social distancing\nrequirements (4, 5). However, a systematic review conducted during the early stages of the\npandemic identified a lack of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of telemental health\ninterventions (4).\nPre-pandemic evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of telemental health was also\ninconclusive. An umbrella review found that in studies conducted prior to the COVID-19\npandemic, evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of telemental health was mixed (6).\n.

A further systematic review\nby Naslund et al (7) identified 26 economic evaluations of telepsychiatry programmes, also\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic. They found that 60% reported telepsychiatry programmes\nto be less expensive and 32% reported they were more expensive than usual care, again\nprimarily due to costs of technology and equipment. This review was limited to peer-\nreviewed studies that used primary data collection and therefore economic models were\nexcluded.\nThis proposed review therefore aims to build on Naslund et al (7) and bring together further\nevidence on economic evaluations of remote mental healthcare. We originally set out to\nanswer the following secondary review questions: (i) Does cost-effectiveness of remote\nmental health care interventions differ by subgroup? (ii) Does cost-effectiveness of remote\nmental health care interventions differ by model type? (iii) What is the impact of remote\ntechnology for staff communication on costs for the health and social care system? (iv)\nWhat is the impact of remote technology for mental healthcare interventions on costs for\nthe health and social care system? (v) How is the amount of contact time between service\nusers and mental health care professionals affected by remote interventions? However,\ngiven the data reported in the selected studies only research questions ii and iv will be\naddressed in this paper."

Twenty-one studies evaluated some form of internet-based/delivered\ntherapy (usually cognitive behavioural therapy). QALYs were used in 13 of these studies,\nDALYs in two studies, productivity losses in one study, and clinically specific measures in the\nremaining studies. In eight studies the costs for the intervention were lower than the\ncomparator and outcomes were better, indicating a situation of dominance (12-19). In five\nstudies where the intervention had higher costs and produced better outcomes, the ICER\nwas relatively low and indicated cost-effectiveness (20-24).

Four of these did not use an outcome measure in the economic analysis and all\nshowed cost savings (27-30). Two other studies reported similar outcomes and lower costs\n(31, 32). One study, evaluating video coaching for carers of children with behavioural\nproblems, found it to cost saving and outcome improving (27). Another study, found\nvideoconferencing to result in costs per improvement in depression of $222 and per\nimprovement in competence of $437 (33).\nStudies that evaluated other remote working interventions usually demonstrated costs\nsavings, dominance (costs savings and better outcomes), or higher costs and better\noutcomes that justified the extra expense. The study by Pot-Kolder et al (34) found the cost\nper QALY of virtual reality-based CBT for people with psychosis and paranoid symptoms to\nbe nearly \u20ac50,000. However, this was deemed to be cost-effective based on a threshold of\n\u20ac80,000 per QALY for conditions such as this.\nThe number of studies taking a societal perspective was 27 with 22 taking a healthcare\nperspective.

The remaining nine studies failed to address or addressed only partially\nten or more relevant checklist items. The least reported items were study perspective (item\n# 6), currency, price date, and conversion (item # 14), the effects of uncertainty (item # 20),\nand potential conflicts of interest (item # 24).

The detailed performance\nof each included study for the CHEERS checklist (10) is shown in Table S4 of the Supplement.\nThe overall quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE certainty ratings (11). The\nassigned ratings shown in Table 2 were based on the quality of the economic evidence.\nOverall, there was an over reliance on single-study based estimates. The certainty of\nevidence was downgraded due to several factors, including imprecision (effect estimates\ncoming from one study with a small sample), risk of bias (narrow perspective, cost omissions\nrelated to comorbidity, healthcare utilisation and other relevant aspects, losses to follow-\nup, short time horizon and limited sensitivity analysis), indirectness (cost estimates based on\nsecondary sources rather than actual resource use, and high percentage of missing data\nimputed) and potential sponsor bias.

The review by Naslund et al (7) included 26 studies and found\ngood evidence for cost savings associated with telepsychiatry but somewhat limited\nevidence of cost-effectiveness. We included a broader range of studies and again these\nsuggest that remote working can result in reduced costs but we also identified a reasonable\nnumber of full economic evaluations where remote working was either dominant (cost\nsaving and outcome improving) or to result in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that are\nbelow acceptable thresholds. However, as with Naslund et al (7), the studies were markedly\nheterogeneous with very different designs and perspectives.\nThe greatest number of studies evaluated some form of internet-delivered therapy (usually\ncognitive behavioural therapy). These tended to be cost effective as were the various forms\nof videoconferencing (although many of the latter were limited to cost comparisons).\n.

This is\nlikely to reflect both the expected benefits of remote working but also the different ways in\nwhich healthcare decisions are made in each country. While the latter consideration is\nimportant, from an economic point of view we might expect remote working to save patient\ntime and this may include time in work. As such, a societal perspective seems appropriate in\nthis area.\nDecision makers often base recommendations on the relationship between costs and QALYs\nand the studies reviewed here reflect this with 31 using QALYs as the main economic\noutcome measure. This is interesting especially given some concerns over the use of QALYs\nin mental health research (66, 67). Most of these concerns though are with the sue of QALYs\nin studies of interventions for schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. As stated\nabove, internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy was most commonly evaluated, and\nthis usually provided for people with depression or anxiety. QALYs do tend to work\nreasonably well for these conditions."

It is from this review that the amount of cost-effectiveness research has\nincreased substantially, and the evidence base is getting stronger. However, methodological\nissues persist.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has clearly led to remote working being given more prominence.\nWhile services will to some extent revert back to usual ways of working, some aspects of\ncare delivery that have emerged since early 2020 will most likely remain. In the UK, the\ncharity Mind has identified challenges including the extent to which people have good\naccess to engage with digital approaches, the quality of care delivered in this way not always\nbeing of a high standard, and potential breaches of confidentiality (69). As demands on\nhealth services continue to increase, it is likely that innovations such as those reviewed here\nwill be needed more and more and it is thus encouraging that on balance they do appear to\nrepresent reasonable value for money.\n.

            "text": "We based our search terms on those used previously by Naslund et al (7). This was\nappropriate in that we were wanting to update that review but also to include studies from\na broader range of sources. However, the strategy may have been too specific and might\nhave missed economic models published prior to 2018. Some terms were excluded that\ncould have been relevant, particularly those relating to the use of social media and\nplatforms such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams.\nAnother limitation is that some interventions/services only included remote working as a\ncomponent of a wider package of care or support. It was appropriate to include such studies\nin order to obtain a broad overview of remote working but identifying the specific impact of\nremote working is challenging in such studies.\nAs with other reviews of economic evaluations, included studies were very heterogeneous.\nThis meant that we could only provide a narrative review rather than a more formal\nsynthesis of findings."
