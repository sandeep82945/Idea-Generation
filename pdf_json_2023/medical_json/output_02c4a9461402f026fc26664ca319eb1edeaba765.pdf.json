    "abstractText": "The HSV-1 (VC2) live-attenuated vaccine strain was engineered with specific deletions in the amino termini of glycoprotein K (gK) and membrane protein UL20, rendering the virus unable to enter neurons and establish latency. VC2 replicates efficiently in epithelial cell culture but produces lower viral titers and smaller viral plaques than its parental HSV-1 (F) wild-type virus. VC2 is an effective live-attenuated vaccine against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in mice and guinea pigs and an anti-tumor immunotherapeutic and oncolytic virus against melanoma and breast cancer in mouse models. Previously, we reported that the gK/UL20 complex interacts with the UL37 tegument protein, and this interaction is essential for virion intracellular envelopment and egress. To investigate the potential role of the UL37 deamidase functions, the recombinant virus FC819S and VC2C819S were constructed with a C819S substitution to inactivate the UL37 predicted deamidase active site on an HSV-1(F) and HSV-1(VC2) genetic background, respectively. FC819S replicated to similar levels with HSV-1(F) and produced similar size viral plaques. In contrast, VC2C819S replication was enhanced, and viral plaques increased in size, approaching those of the wild-type HSV-1(F) virus. FC819S infection of cell cultures caused enhanced GM-CSF secretion in comparison to HSV-1(F) across several cell lines, including HEp2 cells and cancer cell lines, DU145 (prostate) and Panc 04.03 (pancreas), and primary mouse peritoneal cells. VC2 infection of these cell lines caused GM-CSF secretion at similar levels to FC819S infection. However, the VC2C819S virus did not exhibit any further enhancement of GM-CSF secretion compared to the VC2 virus. These results suggest that the UL37 deamidation functions in conjunction with the gK/UL20 complex to facilitate virus replication and GM-CSF secretion.",

Typical infection begins in the epithelial cells around the lips. The virus travels and spreads through the axonal termini of sensory neurons to the neuronal cell body in the trigeminal ganglia (TG). In the TG, the virus establishes a period of latency. During latency, viral gene transcription is suppressed almost completely [2]. However, the virus reactivates during immune suppression, initiating replication and spreading back to peripheral tissues. The most common disease manifestation is blistering around the lips, called \u201ccold sores.\u201d However, HSV-1 is associated with more severe disease when the virus reacts to ocular surfaces causing herpetic keratitis or when the virus reacts to the central nervous systems (CNS), resulting in encephalitis and meningitis. Moreover, HSV-1 can infect genital tissues, where the virus\nViruses 2023, 15, 367. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15020367 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nViruses 2023, 15, 367 2 of 14\nestablishes latency in the dorsal root ganglia and reactivation results in herpes genitalia. For these reasons, developing an efficacious vaccine is of the utmost importance to ameliorate the disease caused by HSV-1 infection."

            "text": "HSV-1 has a wide range of tissue tropism and can enter cells via fusion of the viral envelope with cellular plasma membranes or endocytosis [3,4]. Fusion of the viral envelope with cellular plasma membranes is exclusively utilized in neuronal axonal entry and results in capsid and tegument proteins deposited directly into the cytoplasm [5,6]. Consequently, the establishment of latency in neurons is dependent on viral fusion. However, HSV-1 can also enter epithelial cells via pH-dependent and -independent clathrin-mediated endocytosis [7,8]. In this case, the virus enters the cell in an early endocytic vesicle. The virus fuses with the endosome to deposit the capsid and tegument proteins into the cytoplasm. These two routes of entry, fusion, and endocytosis, contribute to the extensive tissue tropism of HSV-1 as it can enter a wide range of cell types. The HSV-1(VC2) strain has specific deletions in the amino termini of glycoprotein K (gK) and the membrane protein UL20. These deletions alter gB-mediated fusion resulting in VC2 being unable to enter cells, including neuronal axons, via fusion of the viral envelope with plasma membranes. However, VC2 can enter epithelial and fibroblast cells in cell culture via endocytosis and replicate efficiently [9,10]. Intramuscular immunization of mice and guinea pigs with VC2 generates protective ocular immune responses against the virulent HSV-1(McKrae) human ocular strain in mice [11]. Moreover, VC2 intramuscular immunization of mice and guinea pigs generates protective immune responses against both virulent HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections of genital tissues [11\u201314]. Additionally, VC2 has been utilized as a vector to express malaria and influenza genes to protect against lethal challenges with those pathogens [15,16]. These results suggest that VC2 induces an adjuvant effect."

            "text": "HSV-1 structure includes many viral proteins embedded in the viral envelope, several capsid proteins surrounding the genome, and a layer of tegument proteins between the envelope and capsid. These tegument proteins serve many essential roles in the virus life cycle, such as facilitating virion transport, initiating viral gene transcription, virus assembly, and egress. While many of their essential functions are well described, these proteins often include multiple distinct functional domains with separate roles. The HSV-1 UL37 tegument protein is 1123aa long and is highly conserved among all members of the neurotropic Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. UL37 is a deamidase involved in immunomodulation [17\u201323]. Specifically, the UL37 catalytic site at C819 acts to deamidate multiple cellular pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), cGAS, and RIG-I [21\u201323]. Deamidation of RIG-I and cGAS during wild-type HSV-1 infection blocks their signaling function and reduces the expression of type-I interferons. When the C819 site is interrupted with the C819S amino acid substitution, RIG-I and cGAS function is maintained, and expression of type-I interferons increases [21,23]. The UL37 protein is required for cytoplasmic virion envelopment and can be transported to the cis-phase of the Golgi apparatus as a complex with the UL36 tegument protein in the absence of capsid formation [24]. The UL37 protein physically interacts with the gK/UL20 heterodimer, and this interaction is essential for cytoplasmic virion envelopment, infectious virus production, and cellular egress [25]."

A wide range of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) recognizes HSV-1, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR9, RIG-I, MDA5, and cGAS (reviewed in [26]). Additionally, many viral proteins can suppress PRRs and\nViruses 2023, 15, 367 3 of 14\ntheir downstream adaptors, including US3, UL11, UL37, ICP0, and VP16 (reviewed in [26]). These PRRs cause increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, CXCL10, interferon \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2), and many other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our laboratory has shown that VC2 has exceptional promise as an oncolytic and immunotherapeutic for the treatment of melanoma and other cancers; specifically, we have reported that VC2 is efficacious in the treatment of melanoma in a mouse immunocompetent and syngeneic model system and can generate strong anti-tumor immune responses [27,28]. This strong VC2 adjuvant effect may be due to the upregulation of innate immune responses. Currently, three HSV-1-based oncolytic and immunotherapeutic strains are licensed for human use. Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC; Imlygic\u2122, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) is an HSV-1 strain with deletions of both copies of ICP 34.5 and an insertion of GM-CSF into each location. The GM-CSF insertion improves local and systemic anti-tumor immunity [29]. T-VEC has been licensed for human anti-melanoma use and is currently tested against other cancers. G207 (Treovir, Inc., Bala Cynwyd, PA, USA) is an HSV-1 (F) background with a deletion of both ICP 34.5 genes and an insertion of lacZ to disable UL39, which shows strong efficacy as a therapy for malignant glioma [30,31]. Delytact (G47\u2206; teserpaturev; Daiichi Sankyo, Co, Tokyo, Japan) has been recently conditionally approved in Japan. It is the most recent version of G207, but with an additional deletion of ICP47 [32,33]. These viruses demonstrate the need for more efficacious herpes oncolytic virotherapy options to treat various cancers. One of the major cytokines in the recruitment of antigen-presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells, is granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF expression by Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; Imlygic\u2122, Amgen Inc.) stimulates antitumor immune responses. GM-CSF is 127aa in length with many glycosylation sites and is secreted by many cell types, including lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells [34] (reviewed in [35]). GM-CSF is vital in the proliferation and differentiation of many myeloid and granulocytic cells [36]. Herein, we show that the C819S mutation increases the VC2 virus replication and spread, indicating that the UL37 deamidase function is intimately involved in the role of the gK/UL20 protein complex in virus replication and spread. We show that VC2 infection enhances the secretion of GM-CSF from several cancer cell lines and primary myeloid cells. Inactivation of the UL37 deamidation active specified by the wild-type parental virus HSV-1(F), but not VC2, results in enhanced GM-CSF secretion. These data indicate that this UL37 deamidation-dependent GM-CSF secretion is functionally associated with the UL37/gK/UL20 interactome."

While best characterized for their roles in egress, they function in physical association with the UL37 tegument protein to facilitate cytoplasmic virion envelopment; they are also important modulators of viral entry and fusion through their interactions with the sole fusion glycoprotein gB [10,39]. Deleting the gK and UL20 binding sites with gB modifies viral entry preventing the virus from entering via the fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes, including neuronal axons [10]. This led to the development of VC2 as a vaccine and oncolytic strain [9,11,14,15,40,41]. Herein, we show that inactivation of the UL37 deamidase catalytic site restores the VC2 virus replication and spread defects indicating that this amino acid change alters the ability of the UL37/gK/UL20 complex to function in virus replication and spread. Importantly, we show for the first time that VC2 causes the enhanced secretion of GM-CSF, which may partially explain its efficacy in melanoma cancer treatment in mice [27,28], and this effect is also associated with the UL37/gK/UL20 interactome."

            "text": "We have shown previously that the gK/UL20 heterodimer interacts with the UL37 protein, and both function in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and egress [42]. Specifically, deleting any of these three proteins prevents secondary envelopment [43\u201348]. Recent reports have identified additional UL37 functional domains active at other steps in the viral life cycle [22,49]. Notably, the C819 catalytic site of UL37 deamidates and deactivates two cytosolic PRRs, cGAS, and RIG-I [21]. Based on the known interactions between gK/UL20 and UL37, we investigated whether the deamidation function of UL37 is functionally associated with gK/UL20. The VC2 virus produces a smaller plaque and replicates less efficiently than its parental wild-type HSV-1(F) [9]. The FC819S mutant virus produces similar plaque size and replication kinetics to the HSV-1(F) virus. In contrast, the VC2C819S virus produces viral plaques that are much larger than its parental virus VC2 and similar in size to the HSV-1(F) prototypic virus. In addition, the VC2C819S viral plaques exhibited a weak syncytial phenotype. This result indicates that the gK/UL20 viral phenotype is intimately associated with the UL37 catalytic deamidation function. One potential explanation is that the deamidation site directly interacts with the gK/UL20 heterodimer or functions to deamidate a functional site on gK/UL20 proteins. The known targets of the UL37 C819 deamidase site are cGAS and RIG-I; however, the replication curves in cells with cGAS knocked out and reconstituted are very similar (Figure 3A,B). The VC2 virus exhibited lower replication kinetics in the L929KO compared to the wild-type virus, as well as compared to VC2 replication in the L929R cells. However, the VC2C819S virus exhibited enhanced replication in comparison to VC2, approaching higher titers than HSV-1(F). This suggests that cGAS is intimately associated with VC2 growth kinetics, most likely because it interacts with UL37. Alternatively, cGAS may act through other intracellular cGAS-dependent functions that can modulate the gK/UL20/UL37 complex. Computational modeling of the UL37 protein carrying the C819S mutation reveals that this amino acid change may cause a more open U37 structure that could potentially increase binding to the gK/UL20 heterodimer, thus, enhancing infectious virus production."

For this reason, the oncolytic HSV-1 virus Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; Imlygic\u2122, Amgen Inc.) was engineered to express GM-CSF to enhance anti-tumor immune responses [50]. We have shown that VC2 is efficacious in treating melanomas in a mouse model and could potentially be utilized as a vector expressing cancer neoantigens to produce a personalized cancer vaccine [27,28]. We observed a significant upregulation of GM-CSF secretion in various cells, including tumor-derived cells infected\nViruses 2023, 15, 367 11 of 14\nwith VC2. The pattern of GM-CSF secretion was consistent, suggesting that the induction method is consistent across cell lineages and is likely not specific to transformed cells or epithelial cells but is likely found in most cell types. This enhanced GM-CSF secretion may be partially responsible for the demonstrated efficacy of the VC2 virus for melanoma in mice [27,28], as well as for breast cancer in mice (Nabi and Kousoulas, in preparation). GM-CSF is not highly conserved across species, with humans and mice only sharing 56% homology. This species-specificity necessitates the creation of human or mouse species-specific versions of GM-CSF-inserted viruses. However, because FC819S, VC2, and VC2C819S can stimulate mouse GM-CSF as effectively as human GM-CSF, the viruses can be used across various models without the need for specialized gene tailoring. These qualities lend greater versatility to these models and their broader applications. We have previously predicted the structure of gK and UL20 using domain-specific modeling. In this manuscript, we utilized newer predictive algorithms to derive the predicted structure of the gK and UL20 heterodimer formation. Notably, the prediction of the gK/UL20 heterodimer having the gK and UL20 amino terminal deletions engineered in the VC2 virus in juxtaposition to their association with cellular membranes reveals that the gK/UL20 heterodimer is shifted inwards into the cellular membranes, potentially altering the availability of cytoplasmic domains of gK/UL20 to bind to other viral and cellular proteins. Notably, the horizontal alpha helix of gK that is shifted from the intracellular space into the plasma membrane is the most highly conserved region of gK, suggesting that it forms a critical function [51]. Additionally, gK and UL20 are important modulators of gB, the fusion protein. Entry requires four essential glycoproteins gB, gD, gH, and gL. Alterations in the gK/UL20 conformational changes to gB likely impact that entire complex (Figure 6A). The introduction of the C819S mutation alters the UL37 overall structure revealing a more open conformation. This potential structure change may allow improved binding of UL37 to the gK/UL20 complex, which is retracted inwards into the plasma membrane, thus, restoring VC2 defects in virus replication and spread.\nViruses 2023, 15, 367 11 of 14\nGM-CSF plays a vital role in monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell maturation and is critical for antigen presentation.
