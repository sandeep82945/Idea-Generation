    "abstractText": "By introducing the theory of social co-governance into the field of e-commerce intellectual property protection, this paper builds an evolutionary game model among the government, e-commerce platforms, and rights holders, and studies the conditions under the stakeholders form a stable equilibrium state under different constraints. Combined with numerical simulation, the influence of individual factors and factor combinations on the system stability is analyzed. Results shows that: Strictly controlling the action costs and response costs of all parties can enhance their willingness to actively deal with infringement issues; reasonable adjustment of the reward and punishment measures of government supervisory agencies can produce sufficient reverse shock and positive guidance to platform and operators; penalties should be imposed on government supervisory agencies that are not sufficiently supervised; strengthen the construction of the social environment for intellectual property protection, improve the social benefits of actively responding to infringement issues, and increase the sense of acquisition by the government, platforms and rights holders. And it provides certain positive references and suggestions for the government to formulate relevant policies.",

And it provides certain\npositive references and suggestions for the government to formulate relevant policies.\nKeywords: e-commerce, social co-governance, intellectual property protection, evolutionary game, rights holder\nINTRODUCTION\nIn China, where the economy and social system are constantly evolving and changing, the internet economy, especially e-commerce business activities, has ushered in a new era of development (Kwak et al., 2019). According to relevant statistics, the scale of Chinese internet users has reached 989 million, of which online shopping users account for \u223c80%. According to the China E-Commerce Report 2020 issued by the Department of E-commerce and Information Technology of the Ministry of Commerce of China, China\u2019s national e-commerce transaction volume in 2020 reached 37.21 trillion yuan, of which the national online retail sales reached 11.76 trillion yuan, ranking first in the world for eight consecutive years. This not only reflects the extremely high commercial value and huge social influence of e-commerce but also confirms that e-commerce has ushered in a new era in China (Huang and Li, 2019). In the post-epidemic era, the e-commerce market is ushering in structural reforms while influencing and changing consumers\u2019 consumption habits (Beckers et al., 2021).\nHowever, at the same time, the problems associated with making and selling counterfeit products and infringing upon intellectual property rights in the field of e-commerce have gradually become prominent and caused many disputes (Mudrytska, 2020). Against the background of trade globalization, intellectual property has emerged as the key issue of global innovation policy (Archibugi and Filippetti, 2010). At present, China\u2019s intellectual property protection system is supervised by many parties (Brander et al., 2017), so China should improve the level of intellectual property protection. According to China E-commerce User Experience and Complaint Monitoring Report, thanks to China\u2019s emphasis on intellectual property protection and the continuous promulgation of relevant laws, regulations and policies in recent years, the number of infringement complaints received in China\u2019s e-commerce sector in 2020 was 45.59% lower year-on-year, but the total number of complaints has remained high. The investigation report of the High People\u2019s Court of Zhejiang Province pointed out that from 2014 to 2018, there were more than 3,000 civil cases of first instance involving the intellectual property rights of e-commerce platforms in Zhejiang Province each year. These cases illustrate the rapid increase in the number of annual cases, the range of case types covering multiple intellectual property fields, and the uneven geographical distribution of cases.\nIntellectual property infringements are frequently industryspecific and involve strong professional knowledge. Government supervisory agencies and e-commerce platforms often have incomplete defense of intellectual property rights. In the presence of loopholes in the protection of intellectual property rights in the digital age, we usually apply legal remedies to provide protection and technical protection measures to strengthen the level of protection. However, technological protectionmeasures can be avoided by circumvention techniques or brute force (Lucchi, 2005). Therefore, we need to find innovative ways to protect intellectual property rights to increase the effectiveness of protection in the e-commerce field (Deng et al., 2019; Lazariuc, 2021; Lazariuc and Lozovanu, 2021). The National People\u2019s Congress of China deliberated and passed the E-Commerce Law in 2018 and began to implement it in 2019. It regulates many issues of social concern. However, the inability of the law to keep pace with digital advancements is compounded by outdated rationales and traditional practices (Wu et al., 2021), and new issues keep emerging (Ge and Chen, 2021). In addition, the responsibility for protecting intellectual property rights undertaken by ecommerce platforms is too great, and the participation of other entities is limited, which has also led to inadequate supervision (Damanpour and Damanpour, 2001). Therefore, the Chinese government proposed for the first time in the Report of the Work of the Government in 2014 that the theory of social co-governance should be introduced into China\u2019s social governance work. In 2019, the policy document Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen social supervision and co-governance of intellectual property rights through the establishment and improvement of the social co-governance\nmodel. The introduction of the theory of social co-governance into China\u2019s intellectual property protection field is a creative new measure.\nAs a victim of intellectual property infringement, intellectual property rights holders usually possess certain industry information resources as well as professional capabilities, which can provide effective help for the governance of infringements (Grzegorczyk, 2020). By cooperating with government departments and e-commerce platforms, intellectual property rights holders can assist in the prevention and guide the control of infringements, and they can supervise and restrict infringement control activities. In recent years, an increasing number of rights holders have hoped to take intellectual property rights in their own hands, seek remedies outside the legal system, and exercise intellectual property self-service through a series of related methods (Adler and Fromer, 2019). At present, some platforms in China have begun to try to invite rights holders to participate in the protection of intellectual property rights. For example, Alibaba\u2019s IPP platform has 524 rights holders settled from August 2019 to June 2020, which is nearly double the number in 2018. However, this is just one platform attempt, and there are still many problems that need follow-up research to solve.\nWith reference to the existing literature, there are very few related studies on the construction of e-commerce intellectual property protection systems under the theory of social cogovernance based on evolutionary games. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to build a tripartite evolutionary game model of the government, e-commerce platforms, and rights holders, analyze the relationship between them, reveal the strategy of the evolution mechanism, explore the construction methods of e-commerce intellectual property protection systems, and finally, provide suggestions for the construction of China\u2019s e-commerce intellectual property social co-governance system and strengthen China\u2019s e-commerce intellectual property protection. Based on the research purpose and existing literature, the main problems to be solved in this paper are as follows:\n(1) With the introduction of rights holders in the social cogovernance system, what factors affect the decision-making of stakeholders? (2) How can the strategic stability of each stakeholder be adjusted? (3) How can we guide and build a more stable e-commerce intellectual property social co-governance system?\nIn response to the above problems, this paper adopts the evolutionary game analysis method to construct a tripartite evolutionary game model of the government, e-commerce platform and rights holders and analyses the stability of each party\u2019s strategy and the influence of each element on the tripartite strategy choice.\nAt the same time, this paper discusses the influence of individual factors and factor combinations in the replication dynamic system on the stability of the system through a numerical simulation with MATLAB software\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832743\nand verifies the validity of the model under different initial conditions. Finally, this paper puts forward suggestions for the construction of China\u2019s e-commerce intellectual property social co-governance system.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section Literature Review reviews the literature related to e-commerce intellectual property protection, social co-governance and evolutionary game theory. Section Social Co-governance Evolutionary Game Model establishes a stakeholder model based on model assumptions and defines relevant parameters. Section The Evolutionary Game Model Solution and Analysis evaluates the stability of the model and obtains some analysis results. Section Simulation Analysis describes the results of evolutionary game simulation and verifies the validity of the model. Section Suggestions and Conclusions summarizes and analyses stakeholders and models and gives policy suggestions and conclusions."

            "text": "Property Infringement In recent years, technological progress and rapid development on the internet have increased enthusiasm for economic activities, and its popularity has significantly changed the traditional system of human interaction and communication (Brocke et al., 2018). The openness of the internet has doubled the breadth and depth of information dissemination, and e-commerce activities have also become closely related to our daily lives in this global revolution. The low cost, high flexibility, and global nature of e-commerce activities make the development of e-commerce particularly rapid (Babenko et al., 2019; Rathnayake, 2021; Salehi et al., 2021). However, the inherent information asymmetry characteristics of e-commerce can make it difficult for buyers and sellers to transmit product quality information (Lee et al., 2005; Christozov et al., 2009; Hossain et al., 2021; Lu and Chen, 2021), and the buyer\u2019s quality assessment of the sellers cannot be passed on to subsequent buyers (Pan, 2011; Devos et al., 2012). This will make high-quality sellers unable to obtain sufficient market recognition, resulting in the \u201clemon effect\u201d in the e-commerce market (Hossain et al., 2018, 2021), which is particularly difficult in the context of the continuous change of new information technology and software applications (Babenko et al., 2019). Information asymmetry in the field of e-commerce has become a very serious problem (Gregg and Scott, 2006; Wei and Ho, 2019). Eliminating the asymmetry of information has become the key to reducing the lemon effect in the e-commerce market (Lee et al., 2005; Pavlou, 2005; Pavlou et al., 2007; Bove and Benoit, 2020; Dang et al., 2020).\nThe uncertain and fictitious nature of this kind of information has also led to the frequent occurrence of intellectual property rights infringements on the internet, which has had unprecedented impacts on the protection of rights holders. At present, intellectual property infringement issues of e-commerce platforms mainly target the areas of patents, trademarks and copyrights (Ma, 2020). Among the abovementioned infringements, when dealing with related\nissues, the fixation of evidence, preservation of the most evidence and their assessment are difficult (Hunter et al., 2021).\nIn addition, the basic literacy and moral awareness of internet users regarding intellectual property are uneven, and the awareness of respecting intellectual property rights throughout the whole society is not perfect (Lehman, 2006; Sun et al., 2021). Only by improving relevant systems and strengthening network management can a social environment conducive to good protection of intellectual property rights be formed (Wang, 2020, 2021). Xu and Qi (2017) also pointed out that e-commerce transactions have a certain degree of dependence on internet resources, while the development of the internet in China is not balanced, and the digital divide is obvious, which also leads to the inevitable infringement of e-commerce intellectual property rights."

            "text": "With the continuous changes and developments of the global economic system, the government\u2019s original supervisory capabilities have not been adapted to social development (Offe, 2018), and it is difficult to coordinate these capabilities with the growing management demands of social entities (Wang and Lan, 2017). Therefore, adjusting the social supervision system and coordinating government supervisory agencies and social subjects to jointly manage social issues jointly promoted the development of social co-governance theory (Herod et al., 1998). Social co-governance is a model of social autonomy under government supervision that is different from governance and social autonomy without government supervision (Coglianese and Lazer, 2003; Baur et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years of China\u2019s reform and opening-up, society has undergone revolutionary changes, and economic and industrial structural changes have also brought many problems. The current governance model has been unable to meet China\u2019s needs, and the co-governance of multiple entities has become the only approach for China\u2019s development (Wang and Wang, 2017; Liu, 2018; Song, 2020). At present, the theory of social co-governance is applied mainly in the fields of food safety risk management and environmental protection (Offe, 2018). Kang (2019) discussed the changes and continuation of China\u2019s food safety governance issues. Wu et al. (2018) proposed the connotation and operational logic of food safety co-governance and proposed a prospect for future research on food safety risk co-governance. Yang and Li (2021) put forward policy suggestions for establishing a behavior integral system and information platform for the social co-governance of ecological and environmental protection. The introduction of the concept of social co-governance in the protection of e-commerce intellectual property rights is an innovative approach, and there are very few studies in this field. Kleinw\u00e4chter (2006) pointed out that internet co-governance activities have developed into a system involving multi-stakeholder participation that requires consultation, coordination, and cooperation. Marsden (2008) wrote that internet governance must respect the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832743\nsocial and economic rights and responsibilities of consumers and described the emerging agenda of \u201cmulti-stakeholder governance\u201d. To study a social co-governance system for ecommerce intellectual property rights protection is to build a supervision system involving the government, e-commerce, industry associations, media, and the public to create a \u201cbig protection\u201d pattern of intellectual property rights. Liu et al. (2018) proposed encouraging social organizations such as ecommerce business circles, industry associations, non-profit organizations, third-party evaluation agencies and other social organizations to participate in e-commerce intellectual property protection and social governance. At present, there are few studies on how to coordinate multiple stakeholders and build a complete social governance system for e-commerce intellectual property protection. Therefore, analyzing and discussing the social co-governance model of e-commerce intellectual property protection with the participation of rights holders will provide a useful supplement and reference for existing research and practical work."

            "text": "The evolutionary game reflects the continuous learning and improvement process of the players in the game and can effectively demonstrate the evolution of their learning mechanism and strategy (Weibull, 1997; Xia et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2021). In recent years, scholars in the field of intellectual property protection have gradually conducted more analysis and research using evolutionary game theory. Based on evolutionary game theory, Yang et al. (2018) analyzed government-industryuniversity-research intellectual property cooperation behavior and influencing factors from market and administrative supervision mechanisms. Although there are few studies on the social co-governance of intellectual property based on the evolutionary game method, evolutionary game analysis in the field of food safety social co-governance has mature research for our reference (Shen and Wei, 2020; Song et al., 2020). Scholars have also put forward opinions and suggestions of practical significance for building a food safety social co-governance system. Therefore, it is feasible to use the evolutionary game analysis method to study the intellectual property protection of e-commerce platforms from the perspective of social cogovernance. In addition, many scholars have introduced social co-governance theory in e-commerce-related research. Li et al. (2018) constructed an evolutionary game model of privacy protection between enterprises and consumers based on the personalization of e-commerce and obtained a win-win result. This further affirms the feasibility of evolutionary game theory in the research of e-commerce intellectual property protection."

            "text": "The introduction of social co-governance theory into China\u2019s e-commerce activities is innovative. It is generally believed\nthat in an evolutionary game system, participants are bounded rational. Stakeholders adjust their strategies by observing the decisions of others and comparing their own benefits. Therefore, studying the dynamic evolution process of stakeholders\u2019 strategies in the e-commerce intellectual property protection social co-governance system can better help us build a social co-governance system that suits the actual development of Chinese society. This paper constructs a game model for stakeholders, including the government, e-commerce platforms and rights holders, and studies the problems existing in the construction of the social co-governance system.\nGovernment supervision departments are the main agency responsible for intellectual property protection and infringement handling in China. They are the key departments for policy formulation and administrative law enforcement. The government can effectively regulate the protection of e-commerce intellectual property rights by setting relevant measures in line with reality. However, how to carry out more detailed e-commerce intellectual property protection is a key issue that the Chinese government needs to consider. In China, against the background of increasing social attention to intellectual property rights, more effective protection and supervision actions can guarantee the government\u2019s credibility. That is, once there is an unfavorable problem of intellectual property protection, it is likely to reduce the credibility of relevant institutions.\nE-commerce platforms are online service providers that provide transaction platforms for e-commerce entities. Therefore, they are responsible for guiding and managing the intellectual property activities that occur on the platform. At present, in the intellectual property protection work of China\u2019s e-commerce platforms, there are still problems such as high costs and unclear definition of pre-regulatory responsibilities. The E-Commerce Law and related laws and regulations are not yet complete. This will increase the possibility of platforms choosing to negatively respond to infringement issues to maximize their own interests, which is irresponsible to legal operators, rights holders, and consumers. Therefore, it is worth studying how to improve enthusiasm for intellectual property protection of e-commerce platforms and formulate reasonable guidance and management measures.\nThe holders of intellectual property rights will be directly affected when an infringement event occurs, which may cause them to incur irreparable losses. At present, an increasing number of rights holders are willing to actively participate in intellectual property protection activities. However, problems such as the poor connection between rights holders and government supervision departments or e-commerce platforms and the unapparent benefits of rights protection also affect the willingness of rights holders to take the initiative to protect themselves.\nIn addition, based on China\u2019s gradually improving social environment that respects intellectual property rights, the public\u2019s attention to stakeholders will also affect the social benefits of all parties and thus, the behavior of stakeholders.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832743"

            "text": "In the e-commerce intellectual property social co-governance system with the participation of rights holders, stakeholders will comprehensively consider various benefits and make optimal decisions after repeated gaming, evolution and mutual learning activities. According to the model description and the specific requirements of intellectual property protection, we propose the following hypotheses:\n(1) We assume that the strategies of the government are (strict supervision, loose supervision), that is, the degree of looseness and strictness of the supervision and punishment mechanism. The probability that the government chooses strict supervision is represented as x, and the probability of loose supervision is represented as 1 \u2212 x. Similarly, the strategies of the e-commerce platforms are (active response, passive response), that is, how actively the e-commerce platform deals with intellectual property infringement issues that occur within the platform. y represents the probability of e-commerce platforms actively responding infringement issues. Correspondingly, 1 \u2212 y represents the probability of e-commerce platforms passively responding to infringement issues. In addition, we assume that the strategies of rights holders are (active rights protection, passive rights protection), that is, rights holders act in advance in the face of possible infringement issues, take the initiative to attack in the face of infringement issues that have already occurred, or choose to defend rights due to losses after infringement issues occur. The rights holders will cause different infringement losses and gains due to different strategic choices. The probabilities of the rights holder\u2019s active and passive protection are z and 1\u2212 z, respectively. (2) E-commerce platforms adopting different management attitudes will incur corresponding costs. The cost of ecommerce platforms actively responding to infringement issues on the platform is Cpa, and the social benefits for ecommerce platforms are currently Sp. When an e-commerce platform passively responds to infringement issues, the cost is Cpp, and the social benefits are Lp. According to the actual situation, it is not difficult to obtain Cpa > Cpp and Sp > Lp. (3) Government supervision departments carrying out different intensities of supervisory activities will incur corresponding costs. Under different intensities, government supervision departments can reward and punish platforms according to their different attitudes toward dealing with related issues and can impose fines on platform operators who infringe on intellectual property rights. When government supervision departments choose strict supervision, the supervision cost and social benefits are Cg and Sg , respectively, and the government supervision departments will fine Ps for the infringement of platform operators. At this time, if the ecommerce platform actively responds to infringement issues, the government will reward the platform with Mp, and if the e-commerce platform passively responds to infringement issues, the government will impose a fine Pp on the platform. When the government supervision departments\nchoose loose supervision, it is impossible to obtain the information on the strategy choice of the e-commerce platforms and the platform operators, and the government supervision department does not provide rewards and punishments. At this time, the social benefits obtained by the government supervision departments are Lg , where Lg < Sg ; if the e-commerce platforms passively respond to infringement issues, which leads to the disadvantage of intellectual property protection, the government supervision departments will be held accountable by the superior authority, and the administrative penalty will be Pg . (4) The cost for the rights holders to prevent and take the initiative to protect their legitimate rights and interests in advance is Cha, and the rights holders\u2019 loss is Gha; at this time, the docking costs between the rights holders and the ecommerce platforms that passively respond to infringement issues is Cph (the docking costs can be ignored when the e-commerce platforms actively respond to infringement issues); the government supervision departments that choose strict supervision have response costs of Cgh (no response costs under loose supervision) for the rights holders to actively protect their rights, and the rights holders have corresponding costs savings. The cost of passive rights protection, after the rights holders learn of the infringement, is Chp (Cha > Chp), and the rights holders\u2019 loss is Ghp at this time.\nThe relationship among the government, e-commerce platforms, and rights holders in this paper is shown in Figure 1. The corresponding parameters are described in Table 1."

For ecommerce platforms that actively respond to infringement issues, the government should give rewards that can effectively enhance the enthusiasm of e-commerce platforms to deal with infringement issues. However, the incentives should not cause the government to incur excessive losses, and it is necessary to prevent the government from reducing its willingness to strictly supervise. Regarding the infringements of intellectual property rights caused by ineffective supervision, the government supervisory agencies should be punished to motivate them to provide supervision. (4) We should further strengthen the construction of a social environment that respects intellectual property rights, boost society\u2019s overall awareness of intellectual property rights, promote the public\u2019s supervision of the government and parties involved in e-commerce activities, improve the social benefits of strict government supervision, boost confidence in the intellectual property protection of e-commerce platforms, and enhance the sense of real gains of active rights protection by rights holders."

            "text": "This paper introduces the theory of social co-governance in the protection of e-commerce intellectual property rights and constructs a three-party evolutionary game model among the government, e-commerce platforms and rights holders. It analyses the strategic stability of stakeholders and the influence of individual factors and factor combinations on the stability of the evolutionary system. This paper verifies the validity of the analysis conclusions through simulation analysis and analyses the game model from the perspective of the government, ecommerce platforms, rights holders and interactions of the three stakeholders. Finally, it provides a reference for government policy making.\nThis paper introduces a certain number of reference elements in the process of constructing the social cogovernance model. Among them, it is difficult to quantify the changes in docking costs and social benefits. At the same time, the participation of consumers (Meng et al., 2021), industry associations (Chen and Wu, 2019), government (Lu and Huang, 2021) and other social entities and the influence of the game sequence have not been considered. Therefore, solving the problem of numerical quantification, introducing more social subjects to construct a more diverse social co-governance model, analyzing the construction of a social co-governance model of intellectual property protection in the whole process of e-commerce activities, and putting forward more constructive opinions and suggestions for the construction of the \u201cbig protection\u201d system of ecommerce intellectual property rights will be our next research direction."
