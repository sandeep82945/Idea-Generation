    "abstractText": "Nanotechniques for curcumin (Cur) encapsulation provided a potential capability to avoid limitations and improve biological activities in food and pharmaceutics. Different from multi-step encapsulation systems, in this study, zein\u2013curcumin (Z\u2013Cur) core-shell nanoparticles could be self-assembled within Eudragit S100 (ES100) fibers through one-pot coaxial electrospinning with Cur at an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 96% for ES100\u2013zein\u2013Cur (ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur) and EE of 67% for self-assembled Z\u2013Cur. The resulting structure realized the double protection of Cur by ES100 and zein, which provided both pH responsiveness and sustained release performances. The self-assembled Z\u2013Cur nanoparticles released from fibermats were spherical (diameter 328 nm) and had a relatively uniform distribution (polydispersity index 0.62). The spherical structures of Z\u2013Cur nanoparticles and Z\u2013Cur nanoparticles loaded in ES100 fibermats could be observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) revealed that hydrophobic interactions occurred between the encapsulated Cur and zein, while Cur was amorphous (rather than in crystalline form). Loading in the fibermat could significantly enhance the photothermal stability of Cur. This novel one-pot system much more easily and efficiently combined nanoparticles and fibers together, offering inherent advantages such as step economy, operational simplicity, and synthetic efficiency. These core-shell biopolymer fibermats which incorporate Cur can be applied in pharmaceutical products toward the goals of sustainable and controllable intestine-targeted drug delivery.",

            "text": "Curcumin (Cur) is a natural active substance extracted from the tubers of herbs such as Curcuma longa [1], Rhizoma zedoariae [2] and Radix curcumae [3], and it has broad application prospects in the fields of foods [4,5] and medicines [6,7]. It has a strong coloration ability and various physiological effects including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation [8], anti-tumor [9], bacteriostasis, and promoting wound healing [10]. However, several factors, including the insolubility [11], low stability at light and thermal changes [12], and low in vivo bioavailability [13] of free Cur in water largely affect its application to be even more. The construction of a nanoscale transport system is an effective solution to solve this problem [14,15]. Clinical studies have found that systems with nanocarriers can significantly enhance Cur\u2019s bioavailability and stability and therefore make it more applicable [16].\nFoods 2023, 12, 1623. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12081623 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 1623 2 of 14\nZein is a natural protein macromolecule extracted from corn endosperm. Its two key features are its good biocompatibility and self-assembly characteristics; therefore, zein is an ideal and safe raw material in food production [17,18] and medicines [19,20] and has attracted widespread attention. Nanoparticles (NPs) along with zein are used as carrier materials to enhance the stability and bioavailability of insoluble drugs [21]. However, zein is not an ideal nanocarrier material due to its low stability, burst release, and encapsulation efficiency [22]. Therefore, researchers have studied to identify these inadequacies as well as identify more desirable qualities of this macromolecule (e.g., pH responsiveness) [23]. Eudragit S100 (ES100) is a pH-sensitive synthetic polymer of which the upper limit of the pH threshold is 7. Since 2010, it has had increasingly wide application in drug industries [24,25]. ES100 is promising in delivering drugs because it is not only insoluble in aqueous media but also nontoxic, nonirritant, biocompatible and permeable, which make drug release controllable. Given that ES100 is characterized by gastro resistance, gastrointestinal targeting, and an effective sustained release of drugs, it becomes an ideal option for targeting colorectal diseases [26,27]. In a variety of nanocarriers, the electrospinning nanofiber delivery system has a simple preparation process and low cost; some common drugs and even some protein molecules can be added into the electrospinning solution. Electrospinning has been proposed as a feasible way for drug delivery and bioactive compounds encapsulation [28\u201330]. The release rate and cumulative release amounts of drugs in vivo can be controlled by changing the process parameters of electrospinning and the material composition in the spinning fluid [31]. The drug distribution in the fibers prepared by electrospinning technology is relatively uniform and can, to a large extent, avoid the deactivation of drug components [32]. The studies have examined a range of delivery systems which are used for the encapsulation of Cur, including a biopolymer-based system, lipid-based system, and emulsionbased system [33]. Most of them involve multiple steps for processing such as nanoprecipitation first and then incorporation into hydrogel [34] or a combined nanoemulsion technique with a high-speed homogenizer and ultrasonic probe [35]. Under these circumstances, synthesizing multicomponent copolymers with tailored structures, ensuring quality control, achieving reproducible manufacturing, and obtaining validated characterization all pose challenges for large-scale production. As a result, there remains an unmet demand for developing simple, cost-effective, and robust approaches with excellent scalability and consistency for manufacturing polymeric nanoplatforms that offer versatile functions and a wide range of applications [36]. The hypothesis of this study is that the zein\u2013curcumin (Z\u2013Cur) core-shell NPs could be self-assembled within ES100 fibers through a one-step coaxial electrospinning method without any multi-step process required, and Cur had an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 96%. The resulting structure would afford the double protection of Cur by ES100 and zein which provided both pH responsiveness and sustained release performances. Encapsulated Cur and zein form self-assembled zein\u2013curcumin (Z\u2013Cur) NPs through hydrophobic interactions. Z\u2013Cur NPs were spherical (diameter 328 nm), and narrowly distributed (polydispersity index 0.62). Loading in a fibermat could significantly enhance the photothermal stability of Cur. In addition, Z\u2013Cur NPs which were encapsulated in ES100 fibermat had been proven effective in delaying the speed of releasing Cur in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The aim of this work is that it can provide an idea for the design of vectors; this novel one-pot system much more easily and efficiently combines nanoparticles and fibers together. Access to such a system through a one-pot method offers inherent advantages such as step economy, operational simplicity, and synthetic efficiency [37]. In addition, these core-shell biopolymer fibermats could be incorporating Cur into pharmaceutical products for intestine-targeted sustained and controlled drug delivery.\nFoods 2023, 12, 1623 3 of 14"

SEM and TEM Observation\nA field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE\u2013SEM) (FEI\u2013Versa, Hillsboro) was employed to monitor the morphological evolution of fibermats. For a better SEM monitoring, the samples were covered by a film of palladium and gold through sputter-coating. Before cross-sectioning, the fibermats should be broken in liquid nitrogen [10]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was observed by a JOEL JEM 1400 PLUS (JEOL Ltd., Japan). Briefly, the Z\u2013Cur nanoparticles were dispersed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and then dropped on a copper grid. For the fibermat observation, the copper grid was fixed on the collector and fibermat around 2 s during electrospinning. The copper grids of nanoparticles or fibermats were observed with the accelerated voltage of 80 kV [9].\n2.3.2. Particle Size and Zeta-Potential Measurements\nDrawn on methods outlined in the existing literature [38] yet modified in service to our own research purposes, we used ZS Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instrument Ltd., Malvern, UK) to measure parameters including the z-average particle diameter, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs. The NPs were dispersed in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.2) at a 1:25 (w/v). The polydispersity index (PDI) and z-average particle were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). The level of scattered light was detected at a 90\u25e6 angle. After equilibrating liquid samples for 60 s at 25 \u25e6C, they were processed by dynamic light back scattering [39]. The data were collected based on ten succeeding readings. Finally, the zeta potential for dispersions is measured in a distinct electric field in terms of the velocity and direction of particle movement.\n2.3.3. Encapsulation and Loading Efficiency\nDrawing from methods in an earlier study [40], a UV-vis spectrophotometer was employed to measure the quantity of Cur which had been loaded and encapsulated in ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur fibermats and self-assembled Zein\u2013Cur (Z\u2013Cur) NPs. The standard solutions of Cur had created a calibration curve which indicates good linearity (r2 = 0.9998). The Z\u2013Cur NPs were released from ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur via phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.01 M, pH 7.2) before the stage of centrifugation. Z\u2013Cur, ES100\u2013Cur and ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur fibermats were dissolved by absolute ethanol. We used a UV\u20131800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu\nFoods 2023, 12, 1623 4 of 14\nCorporation, Kyoto, Japan) to measure the specific contents of Cur. Absorbance was determined at a 426 nm wavelength. The loading efficiency (LE) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were calculated by the following equations:\nEE (%) = Encapsulated curcumin/Total curcumin input \u00d7 100\nLE (%) = Encapsulated curcumin)/Weight of fibermats \u00d7 100"

Since the solubility of Cur in water is remarkably low, the water containing 0.05% Tween 80 is a relatively good medium for testing the release profile [44]. More specifically, simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) were mixed with absolute ethanol in equal amounts. Then, a given quantity of sample (30 mg) was kept in the dialysis bag of which the molecular cut-off was set at 3 kDa. The sample was kept in a flask at 37 \u25e6C containing 30 mL of SGF release medium and was shaken gently for two hours. Then, the dialysis bag containing the samples was moved to the flask and kept for three hours under the SIF conditions. The UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the Cur content of the release medium.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs loaded in ES100 fibermats are presented in Figure 2B,C. SEM images show that cylindrical, flat and extremely thin ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur nanofibers were produced (Figure 2B). The SEM cross section and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly showed the core-shell structure of the fiber, and the NPs were distributed in the fiber (Figure 2C,D). The diameter value of these nanofibers was around 600 nm (Figure 2D). The self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs in the ES100 fibermats were released by PBS with pH = 7.2, and these NPs were spherical and had a core-shell structure (Figure 2E,F). The appropriate proportion of Z\u2013Cur NPs that can self-assemble within the ES100 fiber and evaluation of NPs stability were also investigated by size distribution, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential analysis (see supplementary materials Figure S1); with the increase in zein\u2013Cur ratio from 20 mg\u201320 mg (20\u201320) to 40 mg\u201320 mg (40\u201320) in electrospun core solution, the average diameter of self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs changed from 328 to 900 nm (supplementary materials Figure S1A), and the self-assembled 40\u201320 NPs were difficult to encapsulate and only arranged on the surface of the ES100 fiber (supplementary materials Figure S2). Meanwhile, the PDI value of 20\u201320 was 0.62 and gradually increased from 20\u201320 to 40\u201320 (supplementary materials Figure S2B), and the potential zeta stability decreased from 20\u201320 to 40\u201320 (supplementary materials Figure S2C), which means 20\u201320 had a relatively uniform particle size distribution and better stability than 40\u201320. This phenomenon is attributed to the mechanism of zein self-assembly. The enhancement of solvent polarity will lead to the decrease in solubility of zein and the change of its molecular conformation, leading to molecular aggregation. Zein self-assembly is induced by slowly evaporating ethanol in the solvent to form NPs. In this process, the concentration of zein is positively correlated with the particle size [45,46]. Therefore, we only selected the 20\u201320 Z\u2013Cur ratio for the study; the Cur had an EE of 96% in ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur fibermats, EE of 67% in self-assembled Z\u2013Cur, and LE of 1.4% for Cur in ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur fibermats.

The XRD analysis (Figure 4) of pure Cur in our research is consistent with previous studies, which demonstrates a set of unique characteristic peaks at 2\u03b8 of 8.84, 14.42, 17.23, 19.33, 21.05, 23.31, 24.47, 25.53, and 28.96 [42]. These indicators prove their crystalline structures [52]. In addition, zein showed two broad peaks at 2\u03b8 of 9 and 19, which is closely related to the amorphous proteins [41,42]. The XRD pattern of encapsulated Cur in the NPs, however, was distinct from that of pure Cur, and there were no characteristic crystal peaks of Cur. The disappearing characteristic crystal peaks confirm that Cur was in an amorphous form when it was encapsulated in the protein matrix. The combination of Cur and protein not only consequently affects the ability of crystalizing Cur in the nanostructure, it also reduced the ability of crystallization by becoming the amorphous complex. Due to the higher oral bioavailability observed in the amorphous state than that in the crystalline one, the mixture of Cur and protein has the potential for improving the oral administration of Cur within the delivery system [53,54].

In Vitro Controlled Release of Cur in Different Carriers The release properties of Cur are shown in Figure 8. We used free Cur as the control to examine the in vitro sustained release properties of drug-loaded nanocarriers. Only 17% free cur was detected in the digestive fluid during the first 120 min of SGF digestion. After 180 min SIF digestion, a total of 26% of Cur was detected in the digestive solution, indicating that the solubility of pure Cur powder was very low even in an aqueous solution containing Tween 80. The release rate of Cur in self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs was the lowest among Z\u2013Cur, ES100\u2013Cur, ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur after 300 min digestion. This might be explained by the strong hydrophobic interaction between Cur and zein [50]. For self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs, around 46.71% of the Cur was released after SGF digestion and exhibited a burst release in the first 60 min. After 180 min SIF digestion, around 61.48% of the Cur was released. Because of the pH responsiveness of the ES100 polymer, ES100\u2013Cur and ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur, there was almost no release of Cur during the first 120 min of SGF digestion, while Cur was released rapidly when exposed to SIF digestion. After 180 min of SIF digestion, 80.28% and 76.45% of Cur were detected in ES100\u2013Cur and ES100\u2013Z\u2013 Cur, respectively.

The sustained-release characteristics of ES100\u2013Z\u2013Cur nanocarriers can be summarized into the following two reasons: (1) the strong hydrophobic interaction between Cur and protein prevents drug diffusion from the inside of NPs, thus prolongating the time of drug release [56], and (2) the self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs are encapsulated in the ES100 fibermats, forming a second protective layer to further delay the release of Cur [24].\nA B\nFigure 7.

The resulting structure achieved both pH responsiveness and sustained release performances by ES100 and zein. The self-assembled Z\u2013Cur NPs released from fibermats were spherical (diameter 328 nm) and had a relative uniform distribution (polydispersity index 0.62). The spherical structures of Z\u2013Cur NPs and Z\u2013Cur NPs loaded in ES100 fibermats were observed by TEM. The encapsulated Cur was in an amorphous form, which was detected by DSC and XRD diffraction. FTIR spectra revealed that hydrophobic interactions occurred between the encapsulated Cur and zein. The photothermal stability of Cur was significantly improved after being loaded in a fibermat. Furthermore, the release of Cur in simulated gastrointestinal fluids was notably delayed when Z\u2013Cur was encapsulated in the ES100 fibermat. This study can provide an idea for the design of vectors, as this novel one-pot system much more easily and efficiently combined nanoparticles and fibers together, offering inherent advantages such as step economy, operational simplicity, and synthetic efficiency.
