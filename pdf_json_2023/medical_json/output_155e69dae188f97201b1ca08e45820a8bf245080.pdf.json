    "abstractText": "Methods: The likelihood of a specific virtual testing scenario occurring in real life has been derived from accident databases scaled to European level. Based on pre-crash simulations, it is determined how likely it is that scenarios could be avoided by a specific Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system. For the unavoidable cases, probabilities for specific collision scenarios are determined, and the injury risk for these is determined, subsequently, from in-crash simulations with the VIVA+ Human Body Models combined with the created metamodel for an average male and female model. The integrated assessment framework was applied for the holistic assessment of car-related pedestrian protection using a generic car model to assess the safety benefits of a generic AEB system combined with current passive safety structures.",

The developed method enables consideration of both active and passive safety measures and distributions of real-world crash scenario parameters.\nMethods: The likelihood of a specific virtual testing scenario occurring in real life has been derived from accident databases scaled to European level. Based on pre-crash simulations, it is determined how likely it is that scenarios could be avoided by a specific Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system. For the unavoidable cases, probabilities for specific collision scenarios are determined, and the injury risk for these is determined, subsequently, from in-crash simulations with the VIVA+ Human Body Models combined with the created metamodel for an average male and female model. The integrated assessment framework was applied for the holistic assessment of car-related pedestrian protection using a generic car model to assess the safety benefits of a generic AEB system combined with current passive safety structures.\nResults: In total, 61,914 virtual testing scenarios have been derived from the different car-pedestrian cases based on real-world crash scenario parameters. Considering the occurrence probability of the virtual testing scenarios, by implementing an AEB, a total crash risk reduction of 81.70% was achieved based on pre-crash simulations. It was shown that 50 in-crash simulations per load case are sufficient to create a metamodel for injury prediction. For the in-crash simulations with the generic vehicle, it was also shown that the injury risk can be reduced by implementing an AEB, as compared to the baseline scenarios. Moreover, as seen in the unavoidable cases, the injury risk for the average male and female is the same for brain injuries and femoral shaft fractures. The average male has a higher risk of skull fractures and fractures of more than three ribs compared to the average female. The average female has a higher risk of proximal femoral fractures than the average male.\nConclusions: A novel methodology was developed which allows for movement away from the exclusive use of standard-load case assessments, thus helping to bridge the gap between active and passive safety evaluations.\nKEYWORDS\nactive safety, HBM, holistic assessment, overall injury assessment, passive safety, pedestrian, sex-specific differences, VIVA+"

However, the studies also conclude that it will not be\u00a0 possible to avoid all VRU accidents.\nPedestrian AEB Systems are already being assessed in current European New Car Assessment Program assessments (10) and have, therefore, gained increasing importance in the last few years. From 2024 onwards, they will become mandatory (11). Hence, the distribution of crash configurations of VRU accidents is predicted to change in the near future. Consequently, new priorities of crash configurations will have to be\u00a0considered in crash performance testing since simply analyzing contemporary accidents will not be\u00a0sufficient. Hence, it is also necessary to predict how priorities will change due to the continued implementation of crash avoiding safety systems, such as different versions of AEB. In case of unavoidable accidents, the remaining impact configuration will be\u00a0significantly affected, due to active safety systems influencing the relative velocity between VRUs and vehicles (12, 13). Therefore, developing a holistic assessment procedure, considering the ratio of avoided cases as well as the effect on unavoidable cases, is essential.\nRegarding virtual pre-crash simulation, the effectiveness of active safety systems (such as AEB) can be\u00a0assessed on a variety of generic or real-world conflict scenarios (6, 14\u201319). A common approach to determining testing scenarios involves using reconstructed real-world accidents. Each conflict scenario is represented in a detailed, explicit way, comprising trajectories of all accident participants based on evidence collected in case records. The use of reconstructed accident scenarios is a fundamental method for the evaluation of safety systems. However, they also represent the extremes of possible scenarios, which are determined and influenced by many different parameters that may not be\u00a0present in a sampled accident. An attempt to tackle this issue is applying the stochastic determination of conflict situations (20). Such an approach attempts to determine potential conflict scenarios by objectively analyzing the variation of \u201cpossible\u201d influencing factors. However, this leads to a large number of scenarios to be\u00a0considered, where the question remains how to interpret the result in terms of the achieved benefit from the system for non-avoided crashes.\nFor the assessment of the injury risk for VRUs in the remaining cases, different options could be\u00a0applied:\n\u2022 Regression models have been developed to predict the injury severity as a function of collision speed (15, 17, 21\u201324). As also the age and not only the collision speed influences the injury Niebuhr et\u00a0al. (25) and Wisch et\u00a0al. (26) have developed speed-dependent injury risk curves for different age groups. This, however, does not allow for consideration of the specific passive safety measures of a specific car that shall be\u00a0assessed. \u2022 Hardware tests with impactors which are used in current consumer information (27) and regulatory tests (28) have the limitation that only limited injury types (29, 30) can\nbe\u00a0assessed and they have been designed for a limited speed range only (31). Furthermore, legform impactors have only been designed to represent the average male stature. This is a shortcoming, as studies on real-world data have shown significant differences in injury patterns between males and females (32, 33). For example, it was found that the odds of sustaining skeletal injuries to the lower extremities (incl. pelvis) are significantly higher for females (32). Furthermore, hardware tests come along with a limited number of affordable test conditions. Previous studies aiming for a holistic assessment have therefore used regression models (34) to interpolate in between impact speeds with the limitation that the angles and head impact speeds depend highly on the collision scenario and are hard to predict (13). \u2022 Crash test dummies (35\u201337) representing the pedestrian are hardly used in research. In contrast to the impactors, more body regions can be\u00a0assessed and the interaction of the entire body resulting in different impact conditions of the body parts considered. However, the dummies are currently only available in the stature of an average male and have only been so far tested in a specific speed range. \u2022 Human Body Models (HBMs) can be\u00a0 used for the virtual assessment of the injury risk for VRUs in accidents. As HBMs are more biofidelic than traditional crash test dummies, it is possible to gain more in-depth knowledge regarding kinematics and sustained injuries. Moreover, it is possible to develop a specific injury risk curve for different body regions and injury types (38). This helps to evaluate the passive safety of the car in a much more detailed way than just using the methods mentioned above. One of the benefits of using HBMs in a virtual testing environment is that a baseline HBM can easily be\u00a0 morphed into many anthropometries (39, 40). However, previous studies (13) have mainly used the classic anthropometries (5th percentile female, 50th percentile male and 95th percentile male). To overcome this, and to be\u00a0able to evaluate males and females in an equal way by using HBMs, the VIVA+ (41) models can be\u00a0 used. These VIVA+ models are available as average female (50F) and average male (50 M).\nThe aim of this study is to develop and test a holistic assessment method that bridges the gap between active and passive safety assessments considering variability observed in field data and considers females and males equally. We\u00a0 aimed to combine stochastic evaluations of an active safety system with injury risk predictions based on HBMs for the evaluation of the passive system in the remaining crashes. For the sex-specific assessment of the in-crash performance and assessment of passive safety systems, the VIVA+ models (50M and 50F) have been used in this study. Finally, we\u00a0 aimed to investigate the sex-specific differences in protection for an exemplary safety system by applying the developed methods."

Moreover, the data was analyzed according to conflict situations. A conflict situation roughly describes the moving pattern of the participants (e.g., pedestrian is crossing from the left and the vehicle is driving straight). To describe the conflict situations, the proposed method by Lindman et\u00a0 al. (45) was used. All accident parameters were collected according to the different conflict situations. Graphics of all the used conflict situations can be\u00a0 found in the Supplementary Figure S1. Since the base level database CARE was also examined for further analyses, these conflict situations had to be\u00a0clustered, as such a detailed description is not available in these base level databases. This results in the following clustered conflict situations: Car straight on \u2013 Pedestrian crosses, Car turns \u2013 Pedestrian same direction (SD), Car turns \u2013 Pedestrian oncoming, Car and Pedestrian in longitudinal traffic. Which conflict situation belongs to which cluster can be\u00a0 seen in Supplementary Figure S2. Supplementary Table S2 lists the available number of accidents regarding investigations for the different databases, injury severities and conflict situations.\nFor the probability analysis of the motion sequence parameters, and particularly the initial velocities of the vehicle and the VRU, the data of GIDAS, V_PAD and CEDATU have been summarized for each conflict situation. As a next step, after the probability analysis, a Weibull distribution was fitted for each conflict situation and injury severity. To fit the Weibull distributions to the accident data, the software package R (46, 47) was used. An example of the final Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the initial vehicle velocity in pedestrian accidents (resulting in slight injuries) for scenario SCPPL (straight crossing path, pedestrian from left) is shown in Figure\u00a02.\nIt is possible to fit the Weibull distribution to a given data sample by determining the scale and shape factor. As two parameters are required to fit the distribution, only conflict situations are used where more than two data samples (accidents) are available. The defined\nWeibull distributions can then be\u00a0used to determine the likelihood of a certain initial speed per conflict situation. This likelihood is needed to calculate the probability of a specific virtual testing scenario occurring in real life. How this is done is described in Section 2.3."

To weight the probability of the different conflict situations on European level, the base level accident database CARE (48) was included in this study. CARE is a European database that includes all national police reported road statistics for 26 European countries (48). The data from the CARE database was categorized according to the clustered conflict situations. However, as mentioned above for the base level accident databases, no detailed description of the conflict situations is available. In addition, no information regarding the motion sequence parameters (e.g., initial velocities of the vehicle and the VRU) is available; the data can only be\u00a0 collected according to the injury severity of the pedestrian. Therefore, the in-depth databases V_PAD, GIDAS and CEDATU were used to allow for distribution of accidents into a specific conflict situation\u2014a necessity when estimating the probabilities of each conflict situation. V_PAD, GIDAS and CEDATU represent the baseline samples, having assumed that they provide probabilities representing Europe within one cluster and severity. Databases with few observations do not contribute to the result as much as databases with a large sample of incident statistics. GIDAS holds the highest number of reported minor accidents (n = 354), whereas CEDATU holds the highest number of reported fatal accidents (n = 153). For severe accidents, the number of reported cases was similar among the databases. Furthermore, it can be\u00a0generally\nFIGURE\u00a02 Fitted Weibull distribution on the accident data from V_PAD, GIDAS, and CEDATU for initial vehicle speed ending in a slightly injured pedestrian accident for SCPPL.\nFrontiers in Public Health 05 frontiersin.org\nconcluded that there are only a few observable cases of severe and fatal accidents resulting in uncertain estimations and results that are sensitive to the cluster division. The estimated and observed proportion of pedestrian accidents were similar, which indicates that independent of the database, the distribution of accidents is similar for conflict situations within a cluster. To obtain the overall probability of each cluster situation, the probabilities within each cluster are multiplied by the probability of an accident belonging to a specific cluster, based on the division of accidents clusters within CARE. The clusters Unspecified and Others are excluded due to the large number of observations in these categories and their resulting impact on the probabilities. The hypothesis is that accidents categorized as Unspecified should belong to one of the other clusters with the same distribution as the ones already divided into the other clusters, although, it cannot be\u00a0confirmed. Supplementary Table S5 shows the derived probabilities for each injury severity, and Supplementary Table S6 shows the derived probabilities for each type of conflict situation for the different injury severities. The final probabilities are, in most cases, comparable to the databases.\nTo derive the probabilities of injury severity and the probability of a specific conflict situation in each cluster of conflict situations on European level, the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) method is used. For a detailed description of the IPF method, the mathematical procedure and its corresponding properties, see Fienberg (49), Plackett et\u00a0al. (50) and Norman (51). IPF is only useful when the accidents are distributed similarly among the different conflict situations for the included in-depth databases, which is assumed to be\u00a0true when comparing the distribution of conflict situations within a specific cluster. However, since the distribution of accidents between clusters differs for the included databases, the final probabilities are calculated based on the cluster distribution of accidents given by CARE. Only the cluster specific conflict probabilities are calculated with the IPF. Furthermore, the probabilities within each cluster are calculated per injury severity due to the fact that some of the databases include just one category of injury severity. In Figure\u00a03, the\nresult from the CARE based IPF is compared with the in-depth accident data V_PAD, GIDAS and CEDATU for accidents resulting in slight injuries."

On the one hand, this decision was based on the size of the data sample, where a statistically dependent approach would have led to too precise a subdivision, and therefore, too many categories with missing data.

Overall, the derived catalog consists of more than 61,000 baseline scenarios for the pedestrian.\nFor each virtual testing scenario, a baseline simulation (no driver reaction or AEB system intervention) was performed as well as a simulation with a virtual AEB system, described in Schachner et\u00a0al.

RMSE measures the average magnitude of the differences between predicted values and the corresponding actual values. It is defined as shown in Equation 3\nEquation 3 Definition of RMSE\nRMSE y y\nni\nn i i= \u2212\n= \u2211 1\n2( )\n(3)\nIn this equation ( )y yi i \u2212 represents the difference between the predicted and actual values for each data point. Squaring these differences emphasizes larger errors, and taking the mean calculates the average of these squared errors. Finally, taking the square root ensures that RMSE is in the same units as the original data, providing a measure of the average absolute error.\nThe error of the overall injury prediction is defined as the difference between the overall injury prediction observed in a ground truth and the overall injury prediction resulting from the metamodel created with different training and test sets. The ground truth in this study is based on 200 in-crash baseline VIVA+ 50F simulations selected by the DoE. The occurrence probability of the different collision scenarios was used as the weighting factor for calculating the overall injury risk.\nTo check whether 50 simulations are sufficient to create the metamodel the 200 the in-crash baseline VIVA+ 50F simulations have been used for verification purposes. The training set was increased in steps of ten simulations and it was checked how well the metamodel works. The rest of the simulations have been used to test the model (e.g., 10 Simulations for training and 190 simulations for testing) In the area to be\u00a0investigated (50 Simulations), a finer sampling of one simulation was chosen in order to obtain a better overview."

For this reason, it is important to have a more accurate accident classification in the future.\nThe Weibull distributions showed a better fit than Normal distributions for describing the initial velocities of vehicles and pedestrians. For cases involving low sample sizes, some deviations leading to poor p-values were observed in the Weibull distribution. Once the quality of data improves in the future, it would be\u00a0possible to identify an even more appropriate distribution.\nThe classification of accident scenarios is not harmonized between European countries. The data available in CARE was therefore limited by the data sources, as was the assessment of injury severity. The overall probabilities have been calculated using the distribution of accidents to specific clusters for CARE applying the IPF method. The IPF method is useful when estimating probabilities based on databases that have been assumed to hold similar distributions of accidents. Please note that cluster probabilities might sometimes differ in CARE\ndatabase. The CARE database consists of many more observations and might therefore provide more representative estimates of the cluster probabilities on European roads. Furthermore, for severe and fatal injuries in certain clusters, IPF results in uncertain estimates for conflict situations with few observations. Therefore, these values should be\u00a0 considered with caution, as they are associated with a relatively large degree of uncertainty. Exclusion of data belonging to certain clusters might change the results. This is particularly important for the cluster \u201cUnspecified\u201d and \u201cOthers\u201d containing a large number of observations. As the probability of an \u201cunspecified\u201d type of conflict situation is not useful for our purposes (i.e., does not describe the design of the simulations and cannot be\u00a0used for the specification of the virtual testing scenarios), these categories were excluded from the current analysis, although they can significantly affect the resulting probabilities. The plausibility checks with the in-depth databases showed that the derived probabilities are reasonable, at least for the countries where access to in-depth data is available.\nAlthough accident data was not available for all conflict situations, it was possible through the stochastic determination of conflict situations and the IPF method to derive a catalog of virtual testing scenarios. Through this approach, 61,914 virtual testing scenarios have been derived. In contrast to test specifications described in UN Regulation No. 152 (68) and Euro NCAP (10) where only a few testing scenarios are defined this offers an approach to a more holistic view. Furthermore, it is possible to test different sensor settings of the AEB system through virtual testing. An accurate evaluation of the collision parameters (angle, point and velocity) needed for the in-crash simulation is also possible with this method."

A maximum deviation between the ground truth and the overall injury prediction of 7% for right proximal femur fractures and a minimum deviation of 0.1% for brain injuries (AIS1) was observed. The mean deviation between the ground truth and the overall injury prediction for all injury criteria was 2.5% when using 50 Simulations to train the metamodel. Also the mean RMSE has reached a minimum value of 13% (absolute minimum 12%) with 50 simulations. The increase of the RMSE for some injury criteria (e.g., DAMAGE, HIC and fracture risk for 3+ ribs) after it has reached a minimum may be\u00a0 because of outliers (the data used for testing represents edge points as they are added last by the DoE space filling method) or overfitting of the model. These numbers show that it is possible to use 50 Simulations to predict the overall injury risk for the whole population of 3,953 in-crash scenarios.\nFrontiers in Public Health 12 frontiersin.org\nTo see how well the predicted injuries can be\u00a0predicted, they have been compared with different field data. Therefore, the collected GIDAS and V_PED data was analyzed according to the injured body regions. The number of observable AIS2+ injuries in the collected data sample for each body region was analyzed. The data is presented, once unweighted (GIDAS) and once weighted, according to conflict situations probability (GIDAS Scaled) on European level derived from field data. Moreover, data from the Initiative of Global Harmonization of Accident Database (IGLAD) was analyzed and compared to the other data sets (69, 70). Also, data from the literature was used to compare our results with field data, namely data published by Wisch et\u00a0al. (26). The comparison of field data with the overall injury risk for the VIVA+ 50F and 50 M can be\u00a0seen in Figure\u00a07. The different injuries per body region of the simulations have been summarized using the Pjoint method proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (71). It can be\u00a0 seen that the simulations are over predicting the injury risk compared to the data from the databases for most of the body regions and is therefore more on the conservative side. Only the RAIDS database prediction seems to work quite well. Similar trends, as in the databases, can be\u00a0observed. Likewise, for the simulations, the lower extremities are the most frequently injured body region, followed by the head and the thorax when it comes to AIS2+ injuries. This might be\u00a0caused by the design of the simulation matrix, where only one pose of the pedestrian was considered. Studies have shown (72, 73) that the used Euro NCAP (58) pose represents a kind of worst case for pedestrians involved in car collisions. By comparing the field data with the predicted injuries, it was seen that, when comparing the data to in-depth databases which include more serious and fatal injuries [e.g., RAIDS database (74)], the prediction is much more in line with the field data. Additionally, the distribution of injuries for the different body regions on AIS2+ level (lower extremities followed by the head and thorax) is in line with several studies (26, 32, 75, 76), with respect that upper extremity injuries have not been evaluated in this study.\nAnother limitation might be\u00a0the used generic vehicle models, where the average stiffness and geometry does not necessarily lead\nto an average injury risk. A comparison to results where the method was applied with a state of the art (SotA) SUV shows that the overall results are comparable to a full FE vehicle model of a serial car."

In accordance with field data studies (32), a higher proximal femur fracture risk was observed in the simulations with the 50F compared to the 50 M (48% vs. 18% overall risk in the baseline cases). While the femur head of the 50F model hits directly the BLE for an impact at 40 km/h, the femur head of the 50 M hits the bonnet at a later stage and more horizontal angle (Figure\u00a08). The trend of higher risk of thoracic injuries for 50\u00a0M compared to 50F observed in real-world crashes (32) was also confirmed in the baseline simulations.\nMoreover, as seen in the unavoidable cases, the injury risk for the average male and female are similar for brain injuries and femoral shaft fractures.

Safety assessment is performed over a wide range of scenarios while keeping the efforts required for simulations at a feasible level. As all tools used in the developed method are open-source available, it can be\u00a0applied in the future by other researchers to more cars and scenario catalog.\nIn total, 61,914 virtual testing scenarios have been derived from the different car-pedestrian cases based on real-world crash scenario parameters. Considering the occurrence probability of the virtual testing scenarios, by implementing an AEB, a total crash risk reduction of 81.70% was achieved based on pre-crash simulations. It was shown that 50 in-crash simulations per load case are sufficient to create a metamodel for injury prediction, whereby the difference compared to 25 simulations was only max. 8% in terms of overall injury risk for the proximal femur fractures. For the in-crash simulations with the generic vehicle, it was also shown that the injury risk can be\u00a0reduced by implementing an AEB, as compared to the baseline scenarios. The highest reduction can be\u00a0observed for AIS4+ brain injuries where the injury risk was lowered from 39 to 14% for the 50 M and 46 to 15% for the 50F. Besides concussion injuries the 50 M showed the highest reduction in injury risk for femur shaft fractures where the risk was reduced from 26 to 3%. For 50F the injury risk for proximal femur fractures could be\u00a0 lowered remarkably from 48 to 17% by implementing an AEB system beside AIS4+ brain injuries. Current sex-related differences observed in the literature (50F has higher\nrisk for proximal femur fractures and 50 M has higher risk for rib fractures) were also identified in the baseline simulations. This trend is still seen in our simulations after implementing an AEB system. The 50 M has still a higher fracture risk for more than three rips (14% compared to 0.5% of the 50F) and the 50F has still a higher risk for proximal femur fractures (17% compared to 11% of the 50 M).\nWith the developed method, the overall benefit of integrated VRU protection can be\u00a0derived."
