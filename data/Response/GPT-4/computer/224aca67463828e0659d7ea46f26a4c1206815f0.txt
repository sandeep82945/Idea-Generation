Generalization Across Different Environments and Conditions: Although the initial model was trained and tested within the Salt Lake City area, exploring the adaptability and effectiveness of FlexRDZ in various urban, suburban, and rural settings can be a valuable extension. This research could focus on modifying the digital twin and RF model to accurately simulate different geographical features, building densities, and environmental conditions. Additionally, investigating the scalability of FlexRDZ in larger or more complex RDZ environments would be essential.

Enhanced Learning Models for Improved Decision Making: The current implementation of FlexRDZ uses a combination of Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and a neural network-based RF model for planning and decision-making. Future research could explore the integration of more advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or federated learning, to enhance the autonomous decision-making capabilities of FlexRDZ. This could include developing more complex reward functions or incorporating adversarial learning to simulate potential interference scenarios better.

Interference Management in Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) Systems: FlexRDZ's approach to managing RDZ violations could be adapted and extended to DSA systems, which also require sophisticated interference management and dynamic spectrum allocation. Research could focus on developing algorithms that leverage real-time environmental data and user demand to optimize spectrum allocation, minimize interference, and ensure fair access across multiple users and services.

Real-world Deployment and Evaluation: Conducting real-world pilot studies of FlexRDZ in operational RDZs or similar environments would provide valuable insights into its practical effectiveness, challenges in deployment, and user acceptance. This could include assessing the system's performance in real-time interference management, its impact on the quality of service for various wireless applications, and its adaptability to unexpected changes in the environment or user behavior.

Security and Privacy in Autonomous RDZ Management: As RDZs become more autonomous and reliant on AI for decision-making, addressing security and privacy concerns becomes crucial. Research could explore secure communication protocols, data encryption techniques, and privacy-preserving algorithms that protect sensitive information while allowing FlexRDZ to effectively manage the RDZ. Additionally, investigating potential vulnerabilities and developing robust defense mechanisms against cyber-attacks targeting the autonomous RDZ management system would be of high importance.
