1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the abietane diterpenoids:** This could be done by synthesizing and testing a series of analogs with different substituents at the C11 and C12 positions. This information could be used to design more potent and selective antitumor agents.


2. **Study the mechanism of action of the abietane diterpenoids:** This could be done by using a variety of biochemical and cellular assays to determine how the compounds inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell death. This information could be used to identify new targets for cancer therapy.


3. **Evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of the abietane diterpenoids:** This could be done by testing the compounds in animal models of cancer. This information would be important for determining the potential of the compounds for clinical development.


4. **Investigate the potential of the abietane diterpenoids to be used in combination with other cancer therapies:** This could be done by testing the compounds in combination with other drugs that are used to treat cancer. This information could help to improve the efficacy of cancer therapy.


5. **Explore the use of the abietane diterpenoids for the prevention of cancer:** This could be done by studying the effects of the compounds on the development of cancer in animal models. This information could help to identify new strategies for preventing cancer.
