    "abstractText": "Lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a), is an LDL-like particle composed of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) bound covalently to apolipoprotein B100. Plasma concentrations of Lp(a) are highly heritable and vary widely between individuals. Elevated plasma concentration of Lp(a) is considered as an independent, causal risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Targeted mass spectrometry (LC-SRM/MS) combined with stable isotope-labeled recombinant proteins provides robust and precise quantification of proteins in the blood, making LC-SRM/ MS assays appealing for monitoring plasma proteins for clinical implications. This study presents a novel quantitative approach, based on proteotypic peptides, to determine the absolute concentration of apo(a) from two microliters of plasma and qualified according to guideline requirements for targeted proteomics assays. After optimization, assay parameters such as linearity, lower limits of quantification (LLOQ), intra-assay variability (CV: 4.7%) and inter-assay repeatability (CV: 7.8%) were determined and the LC-SRM/MS results were benchmarked against a commercially available immunoassay. In summary, the measurements of an apo(a) single copy specific peptide and a kringle 4 specific peptide allow for the determination of molar concentration and relative size of apo(a) in individuals.",

Apo(a) is a homolog of plasminogen and both genes code sequences for loop structures stabilized by intrachain disulfide bonds, so-called kringle (K) domains. Within the apo(a) gene two different kringle domains are present, namely K4 and K5. The apo(a) gene has ten different types of plasminogen-like K4 domains, referred to as K4 type 1 through 10. All K4 domains except for K4 type 2 (K42) are present as single copies. In contrast, K42 repeats are present as multiple copies that vary from 3 to>40 copies [3\u20137]. Hence, apo(a) is highly polymorphic in size because of the number of K42 repeats, resulting in >40 isoforms with molecular masses ranging between 200 kDa and 900 kDa.\nDue to the extensive LPA allele size variability, plasma Lp(a) in heterozygous individuals\nmost often carry two differently sized apo(a) isoforms [8]. An individual may carry a small and a large isoform, in any combination thereof, and approximately 20% of all subjects express only one isoform of the protein [9]. The circulating levels of Lp(a) are primarily determined by the association between K42 repeats and Lp(a) levels, but a variation in Lp(a) levels has been observed for isoforms of the same size [10\u201314].\nHigh Lp(a) levels is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction\n(MI), stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), and heart failure (HF) [10, 11, 15\u201325]. Mendelian randomization studies have shown that low numbers of K42 repeats and high Lp(a) levels are associated with CVD [10]. These associations have catalyzed research and development efforts to introduce therapies to reduce the plasma levels of Lp(a) [26\u201328].\nThe size heterogeneity of Lp(a) has been the most challenging hurdle to overcome for the development of immunoassays for the accurate measurement of Lp(a) in plasma. Marcovina et al. [29] have reviewed the challenges involved in selecting specific antibodies directed to apo (a) due to the variability in size of apo(a) and to develop an assay calibrator that has structural characteristics that resemble the analyte. Selecting an appropriate calibrator is practically impossible due to the intra- and interindividual high degree of size variation in apo(a). Furthermore, because of this heterogeneity, Marcovina et al. [29] suggested that quantitative Lp(a) levels from assays should be reported in apo(a) particle number as nmol/l and not mg/dl, provided the variability in apo(a) size. Due to the need for precise values represented in standardized and comparable units, several targeted LC-MS/MS approaches have been developed for the quantification of apolipoprotein(a) by targeting selected proteotypic peptides. These have been constructed relying solely on spike-in of peptide standards, which enable the peptide concentration to be determined precisely by isotope dilution. These assays have been rigorously assessed in terms of accuracy and precision and designed to circumvent the issues of the repetitive sequence of apo(a) [30\u201332]. A common obstacle when working with peptide standards is their dependence on proteolysis yields to deliver robust, accurate and precise quantification. This has been highlighted both by Marcovina et al. and Blanchard et al., in the context of accurate quantification. To address these inherent targeted proteomics issues, rigorous evaluation of digestion kinetics or the use of commercial digestion kits have been used, but this puts a new constraint on the assay in terms of confinement to specific digestion protocols [32, 33]. In our previous study [34], a novel type of internal standard called Stable Isotope Standard (SIS) Protein Epitope Signature Tags (SIS PrESTs), which are derived from the Human Protein Atlas project, was described in the context of analysis of clinical samples [35, 36]. These standards are based on recombinant protein fragments that release their labeled peptides upon digestion and can account for very short digestion protocols with preserved quantitative precision [35, 37]. The SIS PrESTs were used to quantify a multiplexed panel of 13 apolipoproteins, including apo(a), in human plasma using Liquid-Chromatography coupled with Selective Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (LC-SRM/MS). There are significant benefits to\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281772 February 15, 2023 2 / 17\nusername: panorama+reviewer42@proteinms.net, password: xWuIHYpN Additionally, all raw files have been uploaded to ProteomeXchange with the data set id PXD026976.\nFunding: The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.\nCompeting interests: The authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: M.U. is a co-founder of Atlas Antibodies AB. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.\nusing targeted mass spectrometry in conjunction with protein-level rather than peptide-level spike-inof standards and SIS PrESTs are an excellent substitute for full-length protein standards in terms of precision and accuracy [34, 38]. However, the SIS PrEST design for apo(a) that was used in our previous study quantified the amount of K4 repeats rather than the apo(a) concentration in human plasma since the target peptide sequence is found in the K42 domain. In this study, we describe the use of a new SIS PrEST apo(a) standard that circumvents this issue by selecting peptides belonging to the non-repeated region of apo(a). The proteotypic peptide is situated in the protease domain of apo(a) and thereby enables measurement of the molar apo(a) levels in plasma. The use of LC-SRM/MS in combination with an internal standard independent of apo(a) isoforms eliminates the dependence on antigen-antibody reactions, calibrators and standards related to immuno-assays for quantification of apo(a). By also quantifying the peptides belonging to the K4 domains, the measurements can be used to obtain the mean number of K4 domains that are present in the apo(a) molecules in the sample and thereby estimate the average size of apo(a) [39].\nLC-SRM/MS assays have emerged as a viable alternative to immunoassays offering high\nspecificity, multiplexity and excellent precision with automated data acquisition [40]. Herein, we describe the development of an LC-SRM/MS method that has been optimized and evaluated with standard procedures for analytical method validations. This includes evaluation of linearity, limit of quantification (LOQ) and repeatability, which is in accordance with a fit-forpurpose approach for targeted mass spectrometry-based assay development [41]. A sample volume of only 2\u02da\u03bcl human plasma was sufficient for accurate and precise quantification of apo(a). The protocol involves tryptic digestion and the generated peptides act as surrogate markers for the protein(s) of interest, which are subsequently analyzed by LC-SRM/MS [42, 43]. The targeted mass spectrometric assay was compared to a commercially available solidphase two-site enzyme immunoassay based on the sandwich technology, in which two monoclonal antibodies, directed against separate antigenic determinants on the apo(a) molecule, were used. In a recent study using a well-characterized healthy sample cohort (The Swedish Science for Life Laboratory SCAPIS Wellness Profiling (S3WP)) of 101 healthy individuals, it was shown that the adult blood levels of many proteins are determined at birth by genetics [44]. Plasma from the S3WP cohort was used to determine the apo(a) levels and how the number of K4 domains influences plasma levels of apo(a)."

The total apo(a) concentration was determined by one standard designed to cover the plasminogen domain (PD, purple), which is unique in the protein sequence. The second standard was directed towards the K4 domain (blue) to determine the total concentration of repeated K4 domains (Fig 1B). The total number of K4 domains in relation to the PD domain was determined by normalizing the concentration values using the SIS standards. The protein concentration determination was performed using the same principle as previously described by Hober et al. [34]. The specific number of repeated K42-domains can be obtained by subtracting the number of peptides mapping to other K4 main types.\nA set of seven theoretical proteotypic peptides from the PD was initially selected for this\nstudy (S5 Table). Two peptides were considered at risk of exhibiting post-translational modifications (according to Uniprot) and were discarded from the analysis, while the remaining five peptides were considered for further evaluation. This standard protein was produced, its peptides were screened, and assay parameters were optimized as previously described. (34, 35). The standards were spiked and serially diluted into pooled human plasma (n = 12) and analyzed by LC-SRM/MS. The peptides were validated over a wide concentration range by reverse standard curves (S1 Data) using the pooled human plasma as background. The results show that apo(a) is detectable across a broad dynamic range (Table 2), down to an estimated concentration of 3.5 nM using the peptide EAQLLVIENEVCNHYK(+3) for quantification (S1 Data). Here, the difference between the reported quantification and the known analyte dilution is known as the prediction error. The linearity of the peptide was thoroughly evaluated and the LOD, LOQ and assay linearity was assessed according to guideline requirements presented by The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) for targeted proteomics assays [41]. Calculations of the characteristics are based on a reverse curve approach [52]. The linear dynamic range for the target protein apo(a) was established by serial dilution of the SIS PrEST standard spiked into the pooled human plasma matrix at different concentrations, ranging from 0.49 nM to 1.0 \u03bcM. The standard curve and linearity measurements resulted in a linear response for apo(a) from 0.5 pmol/\u03bcl to 7.8 fmol/\u03bcl. Reverse standard curves were used to analyze all selected peptides from the SIS PrEST. Because of its sensitivity, determined by the lowest LOQ, the peptide EAQLLVIENEVCNHYK(+3) was chosen for the measurement of the plasminogen domain.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281772 February 15, 2023 7 / 17"

The results in U/L were converted to \u03bcg/ \u03bcl using a specific conversion factor, determined by five different methodologies that are based on external controls (Bio-Rad Liquicheck Immunology Controls). The immunoassay is based on a number of calibrators that have to be selected for each sample cohort individually to quantify apo(a) with high precision and accuracy. One calibrator (no. 4) with a concentration of 0.129 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, was selected as the optimal range based on a pool of ten individuals. The established LC-SRM/MS assay towards apo(a) was used to quantify the calibrator and was determined to be 2.3 nM. This value was used to convert the concentrations obtained by ELISA to molar concentrations. The immunoassay was used to determine the concentration of apo(a) in 10 individuals (Table 3). The same samples were analyzed using the apo(a) LC-SRM/MS assay as described above. The immunoassay and the LC-SRM/MS method correlated with an R2 of 0.92 (Fig 3). The immunoassay\u2019s accuracy was calculated based on the LC-SRM/MS result, and the antibody-based assay showed good accuracy in the concentration range that lies closer to the pooled plasma reference. However, a deviation between the methods was noted for the samples with plasma concentrations below LOQ of the LC-SRM/MS assay (Table 3).\nProfiling a wellness cohort of healthy individuals\nA previously well-profiled cohort [46] of individuals without any known disease had previously been investigated using the SIS PrEST assay measuring the K4 repeats [48]. The same samples were used to quantify total apo(a) molar concentration and number of K4 domains. A subset of plasma samples (90 samples + 6 pools) was de-identified prior to quantification of apo(a). The final apo(a) assay was combined with a previously established assay capable of profiling 13 apolipoproteins in human plasma in multiplex [34], allowing for deeper apolipoprotein profile characterization. The final plate contained six replicates of pooled plasma (3 males, 2 females) used to assess the assay\u2019s technical variation.\nThe overall concentration of apo(a) ranged between 311 nM and 1.9 nM (Fig 4A).

By dividing the molar concentration of GTYSTTVTGR with the molar concentration of EAQLLVIENEVCNHYK, the average number of K4 repeats per apo(a) molecule in a sample was obtained.

            "text": "The described method, using the specificity of targeted proteomics and mass spectrometry, allows the measurement of the molar concentrations of apo(a) as well as the average isoform size of the apo(a) protein in clinical studies. The assay shows a higher degree of repeatability and performance than a corresponding ELISA test that indirectly estimates the molar concentration of apo(a) in blood by using different references. The targeted mass spectrometry assay using spiked SIS PrESTs enables a direct measurement of peptides without any conversion factors and can be applied over large dynamic concentration ranges suitable for multiplex plasma protein quantitation. Additionally, each SIS PrEST standard can be individually quality assured and quantified by mass spectrometry upfront any spike-in experiment thanks to the use of a common tag sequence. This guarantees that their individual quantities are anchored to the same common point [45]. The quantification is anchored to an ultra-purified tag protein that has been subjected to amino acid analysis to determine its concentration on an absolute scale. Moreover, with the proteotypic peptides being released upon digestion, the quantitative bias between different peptides has previously been shown to be reduced [34]. It can also efficiently account for digestion accuracy biases when using different proteases [53]. This also allows for the unbiased evaluation of the peptides present in the PrEST sequence during method development. When working with high multiplexes of SIL peptides, an unbiased evaluation of peptides can be costly, as there is a need to specifically synthesize the peptides to be interrogated. This can lead to the exclusion of well-performing peptides due to their presumed unsuitability as quantitative proteotypic peptides. This can be avoided when generating assays using SIS PrESTs. However, the peptide selection remains limited to the peptides present in the PrEST sequence, shifting the focus from singular peptides to protein regions. The use of spiked standards at the protein level has also been shown to allow for short digestion protocols (\ufffd60 minutes) with equally high precision as for overnight digestions (12 h) [35, 37]. Additionally, the SIS PREST\u2019s ability to deliver robust readouts even after repeated freeze-thaw cycles suggests that this methodology, where samples are spiked with internal standards prior to enzymatic digestion, can help facilitate the introduction of LC-SRM/MS into a clinical setting. It has also been shown that the SIS PrEST can be stored long-term in a vacuum-dried\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281772.g004\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281772 February 15, 2023 12 / 17\nstate for addition-only protocols, which could prove an attractive strategy for clinical applications [37].\nIn this study, the new methodology was used to determine concentrations of apo(a) as well\nas the average number of K42 repeats by quantifying K4-specific peptides in a cohort of 90 individuals without any known disease [46]. In this relatively small cohort with a limited variance in K42 repeats, it was not possible to detect the negative correlation between the average number of K42 repeats and the apo(a) concentrations previously observed [10]. Despite not revealing the absolute isoform size of the various populations of circulating apo(a) molecules in blood, this approach for estimating the average circulating isoform size of apo(a) may yet provide useful insights into VTE risk, as described by other studies [54]. As the strategy allows for multiplex analysis of the average isoform size together with quantitative analysis of other proteins, compared to single plex orthogonal methods for determining the isoform size in absolute numbers, it can therefore be deployed in clinical settings without requiring additional experiments to be performed.\nThe negative correlation could be explained by more efficient hepatic secretion of the\nshorter isoforms of apo(a) since the production rather than catabolism of Lp(a) is the major determinant of the plasma concentrations. In the relatively small study cohort, visual inspection indicates a negative correlation between apo(a) concentrations and the number of K42 repeats among individuals with more than 13\u201314 repeats, while a lower number of repeats does not seem to influence the plasma levels. Larger study cohorts are needed to investigate if there is a threshold for the inverse association between the number of repeats and plasma apo (a) concentrations.\nThe developed assay allows for accurate measurements of molar concentrations of apo(a)\nand size of apo(a) in an assay suitable for clinical studies. Further studies are needed in larger cohorts with genetic determinations of K42 copy numbers to allow comparison of apo(a) levels with average apo(a) isoform size and LPA genetics."
