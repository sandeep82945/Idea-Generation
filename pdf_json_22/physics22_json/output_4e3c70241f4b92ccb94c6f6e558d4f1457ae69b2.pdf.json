The susceptibility is calculated analytically for several pseudospin quintet states in a cubic superconductor within the linear response to a Zeeman field. The susceptibility for A1g symmetry states is isotropic in real space. For Eg and T2g symmetry cases, the results depend sensitively on choices of order parameter. The susceptibility is isotropic for a T2g symmetry state, whereas it becomes anisotropic for an Eg symmetry state. We also find in a T2g state that the susceptibility tensor has off-diagonal elements.",

The susceptibility is calculated analytically for several pseudospin quintet states in a cubic superconductor within the linear response to a Zeeman field. The susceptibility for A1g symmetry states is isotropic in real space. For Eg and T2g symmetry cases, the results depend sensitively on choices of order parameter. The susceptibility is isotropic for a T2g symmetry state, whereas it becomes anisotropic for an Eg symmetry state. We also find in a T2g state that the susceptibility tensor has off-diagonal elements.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSpin-orbit interaction is a source of exotic electronic states realized in topological semimetals [1, 2], topological insulators [3, 4], and topological superconductors [5\u2013 9]. In the presence of strong spin-orbit interactions, spin S = 1/2 and orbital angular momentum L = 1 of an electron are inseparable degrees of freedom. Electronic properties of such materials are characterized by an electron with pseudospin J = L + S = 3/2. Recent studies have suggested a possibility of superconductivity due to Cooper pairing between two electrons with J = 3/2 [10, 11]. The large angular momentum of an electron enriches the symmetry of the order parameter such as pseudospin-quintet even-parity and pseudospinseptet odd-parity [12, 13] in addition to conventional spin-singlet even-parity and spin-triplet odd-parity. Such high angular-momentum pairing states would feature superconducting phenomena of J = 3/2 superconductors [14\u201319]. In particular, a large angular momentum of a Cooper pair would qualitatively change the magnetic response of a superconductor to an external magnetic field.\nThe spin susceptibility reflects well the internal spin structures of a Cooper pair. It is well known in spinsinglet superconductors that the spin susceptibility decreases monotonically with the decrease of temperature below Tc and vanishes at zero temperature [20]. This phenomenon occurs independently of the direction of a Zeeman field H because a Cooper pair has no spin. In spin-triplet superconductors, on the other hand, the susceptibility can be anisotropic depending on the relative alignment between a Zeeman field and a d vector in the order parameter. For d \u22a5 H , the spin susceptibility is constant independent of temperature. Thus, the unchanged Knight shift across Tc in experiments could be a strong evidence of spin-triplet superconductivity. For d \u2016 H , the susceptibility decreases with decreasing temperature below Tc. Such anisotropy is more remarkable when the number of components in a d vector is smaller. For J = 3/2 superconductors, however, our knowledge of the spin susceptibility is very limited to a theoretical paper that reported vanishing the spin susceptibility at\nzero temperature for a singlet-quintet mixed state in a centrosymmetric superconductor [21]. In this paper, we study theoretically the response of pseudospin-quintet even-parity superconductors to an external Zeeman field. The angular momentum of a Cooper pair in such superconductors is J = 2. Since the pairing symmetries of the pseudospin-quintet states are not well understood, we decided to calculate the spin susceptibility for the plausible pair potentials at a cubic superconductor preserving time-reversal symmetry. The spin susceptibility is analytically calculated based on the linear response formula [22]. The pair potential of pseudospinquintet states is described by a five-component vector that couples to five 4 \u00d7 4 matrices in pseudospin space. Such complicated internal structures of the pair potential enrich the magnetic response of J = 3/2 superconductors. When the symmetry of the pair potential is high in pseudospin space (A1g state), the magnetic response is isotropic in real space and the spin susceptibility decreases monotonically with the decrease of temperature. The results are similar to those of 3He B-phase. When the pair potential is independent of wavenumber (T2g and Eg states), the spin susceptibility shows unique features to pseudospin-quintet states. The magnetic response becomes anisotropic in real space in an Eg state and the susceptibility tensor has finite off-diagonal elements in a T2g state. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we described the electronic structure and the pair potential of a J = 3/2 superconductor in terms of five 4\u00d74 matrices. The characteristic behaviors of the spin-susceptibility are discussed in Sec. III. The conclusion is given in Sec.IV. Algebras of 4 \u00d7 4 matrices and a number of mathematical relationships used in the paper are summarized in Appendices. Throughout this paper, we use the system of units ~ = kB = c = 1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and c is the speed of light."

            "text": "We begin our analysis with the normal state Hamiltonian adopted in Ref. 13. The electronic states have\n2 four degrees of freedom consisting of two orbitals of equal parity and spin 1/2. In the presence of strong spin-orbit interactions, the effective Hamiltonian for a J = 3/2 electron is given by [23]\nHN = \u2211\nk\n\u03a8\u2020 k HN(k)\u03a8k, (1)\n\u03a8k = [ ck,3/2, ck,1/2, ck,\u22121/2, ck,\u22123/2 ]T , (2)\nwhere T means the transpose of a matrix and ck,jz is the annihilation operator of an electron at k with the zcomponent of angular momentum being jz . The normal state Hamiltonian is represented by\nHN(k) =\u03b1k 2 + \u03b2 (k \u00b7 J)2 \u2212 \u00b5 = \u03bek 14\u00d74 + ~\u01ebk \u00b7 ~\u03b3 (3)\nwith \u03bek = \u01ebk,0 \u2212 \u00b5 and\n\u01ebk,0 =\n( \u03b1+ 5\n4 \u03b2\n) k 2, \u01ebk,j = \u03b2 k 2 ej cj(k\u0302), (4)\nc1(k\u0302) = \u221a 15 k\u0302x k\u0302y, c2(k\u0302) = \u221a 15 k\u0302y k\u0302z, (5) c3(k\u0302) = \u221a 15 k\u0302z k\u0302x, c4(k\u0302) = \u221a 15\n2 (k\u03022x \u2212 k\u03022y), (6)\nc5(k\u0302) =\n\u221a 5\n2 (2k\u03022z \u2212 k\u03022x \u2212 k\u03022y), (7)\nwhere k\u0302j = kj/|k| for j = x, y and z represents the direction of wavenumber on the Fermi surface. The constants \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 determine the normal state property. The spin-orbit interactions increase with the increase of \u03b2 > 0. The coefficients cj are normalized as\n\u3008ci(k\u0302) cj(k\u0302)\u3009k\u0302 \u2261 \u222b dk\u0302\n4\u03c0 ci(k\u0302)cj(k\u0302) = \u03b4i,j , (8)\nwhere \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 k\u0302 means the integral over the solid angle on the Fermi surface. The normalized five-component vector ~e = (e1, e2, e3, e4, e5)/|~e| determines the dependence of the normal state dispersions on pseudospins. The spinors for the angular momenum of J = 3/2 are described by,\nJx = 1\n2\n  0 \u221a 3 0 0\u221a 3 0 2 0 0 2 0 \u221a 3\n0 0 \u221a 3 0\n  , (9)\nJy = 1\n2\n  0 \u2212i \u221a 3 0 0 i \u221a 3 0 \u22122i 0 0 2i 0 \u2212i \u221a 3\n0 0 i \u221a 3 0\n  , (10)\nJz = 1\n2\n \n3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u22121 0 0 0 0 \u22123\n  . (11)\nThe 4\u00d7 4 matrices in pseudospin space are defined as\n\u03b31 = 1\u221a 3 (JxJy + JyJx), \u03b3 2 = 1\u221a 3 (JyJz + JzJy), (12) \u03b33 = 1\u221a 3 (JzJx + JxJz), \u03b3 4 = 1\u221a 3 (J2x \u2212 J2y ), (13) \u03b35 = 1\n3 (2J2z \u2212 J2x \u2212 J2y ), (14)\nand 14\u00d74 is the identity matrix. They satisfy the following relations\n\u03b3\u03bd \u03b3\u03bb + \u03b3\u03bb \u03b3\u03bd = 2\u00d7 14\u00d74\u03b4\u03bd,\u03bb, (15) \u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b33 \u03b34 \u03b35 = \u221214\u00d74, (16) {\u03b3\u03bd}\u2217 = {\u03b3\u03bd}T = UT \u03b3\u03bd U\u22121T , UT = \u03b31 \u03b32, (17)\nwhere UT is the unitary part of the time-reversal operation T = UT K with K meaning complex conjugation. The superconducting pair potential is represented as\n\u2206(k) = ~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3 UT , (18)\nwhere a five-component vector ~\u03b7k represents an evenparity pseudospin-quintet state. Throughout this paper, we assume that all components of ~\u03b7k are real values. As a result of the Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons, the pair potential is antisymmetric under the permutation of two pseudospins, (i.e., \u2206T(k) = \u2212\u2206(k)). The Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian reads,\nHBdG(k) = [ HN(k) \u2206(k) \u2212\u2206 \u02dc (k) \u2212H \u02dc N (k) ] , (19)\nwhere X \u02dc (k, i\u03c9) \u2261 X\u2217(\u2212k, i\u03c9) represents the particlehole conjugation of X(k, i\u03c9). The interaction with a uniform Zeeman field H is described by [23]\nHZ =\u2212 \u00b5BJ\u0303 \u00b7H , (20) J\u0303j =g1Jj + g3J 3 j , (21)\nfor j = x, y, and z, where \u00b5B is the Bohr\u2019s magneton, and g1 and g3 are the coupling constants. The matrix structures of Jj and J 3 j are displayed in Appendix A. The angular momenta in the Zeeman Hamiltonian are then given by\nJ\u0303x =\u2212 i\n2\n(\u221a 3p1\u03b3 2 \u03b35 + p2\u03b3 1 \u03b33 + p1\u03b3 2 \u03b34 ) , (22)\nJ\u0303y = i\n2\n(\u221a 3p1\u03b3 3 \u03b35 + p2\u03b3 1 \u03b32 \u2212 p1\u03b33 \u03b34 ) , (23)\nJ\u0303z = i\n2\n( p2\u03b3 2 \u03b33 + 2p1\u03b3 1 \u03b34 ) , (24)\np1 =g1 + 7\n4 g3, p2 = g1 +\n13\n4 g3. (25)\nIn the linear response theory, the spin susceptibility is\n3 calculated by using the formula [22]\n\u03c7\u00b5\u03bd =\u03c7N \u03b4\u00b5,\u03bd \u2212 (\u00b5B\n2\n)2 T \u2211\n\u03c9n\n\u222b dk\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u00d7Tr [ G(k, i\u03c9n) J\u0303\u00b5 G(k, i\u03c9n) J\u0303\u03bd\n+ F \u02dc (k, i\u03c9l) J\u0303\u00b5 F (k, i\u03c9n) (J\u0303\u03bd)\n\u2217\n\u2212GN(k, i\u03c9n) J\u0303\u00b5 GN(k, i\u03c9n) J\u0303\u03bd ] . (26)\nThe summation over the Matsubara frequency and that over the wavenumber are regularized by introducing the Green\u2019s functions in the normal state GN and the spin susceptibility \u03c7N in the normal state [24]. The Green\u2019s function for a superconducting state can be obtained by solving the Gor\u2019kov equation\n[ i\u03c9n \u2212HBdG(k) ] [ G(k, i\u03c9n) F (k, i\u03c9n) \u2212F \u02dc (k, i\u03c9n) \u2212G\u02dc (k, i\u03c9n) ] = 18\u00d78. (27)\nThe anomalous Green\u2019s function results in\nF\u22121(k, i\u03c9n) = UT\n~\u03b7k 2\n[ (\u03c92n + \u03bek 2 + ~\u03b7k 2)~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3\n+ i\u03c9n[~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3,~\u01ebk \u00b7 ~\u03b3]\u2212 +2 \u03bek ~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u01ebk + (~\u01ebk \u00b7 ~\u03b3) (~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3) (~\u01ebk \u00b7 ~\u03b3)] . (28)\nGenerally speaking, it is not easy to calculate analytically the inversion of 4\u00d7 4 matrices. To proceed analytic calculation, we consider a cubic symmetric superconductor [14], in which even-parity pair potentials are classified into A1g, Eg, and T2g states according to irreducible representations (irreps) of cubic symmetry. With focusing on pseudospin-quintet Cooper pairs, their pairing states are explicitly represented as\nA1g : ~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3 = \u2206 5\u2211\nj=1\nhj cj(k\u0302) \u03b3 j, (29)\nEg : ~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3 = \u2206(l4\u03b34 + l5\u03b35), (30) T2g : ~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3 = \u2206(l1\u03b31 + l2\u03b32 + l3\u03b33), (31)\nwhere the unit vector ~h determines the pseudospin structure of A1g state and li \u2208 C (i = 1\u22125). A1g states involve momentum-dependent coefficients, which comes from the fact that \u03b34 and \u03b35 (\u03b31, \u03b32, and \u03b33) themselves belong to Eg (T2g) irreps of cubic symmetry. Generally speaking, the coefficients li for i = 1\u2212 5 are determined from the steady states of the free energy [25]. For Eg state, three distinct steady states exist: (l4, l5) =\n(1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, i)/ \u221a 2. The first two states preserve time-reversal symmetry, while the last state breaks time-reversal symmetry. For T2g state, there are four\ndistinct steady states: (l1, l2, l3) = (1, 1, 1)/ \u221a 3, (1, 0, 0),\n(1, ei2\u03c0/3, ei4\u03c0/3)/ \u221a 3, (1, i, 0)/ \u221a 2. The last two states\nbreak time-reversal symmetry. Time-reversal symmetrybreaking superconducting states have a problem specific to them: the formation of Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces [13, 14, 19]. Since the relations between the pseudospin structures of a Cooper pair and the magnetic response of a superconductor is the main issue in this paper, we focus on time-reversal symmetry respecting superconducting states. In addition to the steady states, we also consider another pseudospin states described by (l4, l5) = (1, 1)/ \u221a 2, (l1, l2, l3) = (1, 1, 0)/ \u221a 2, and\n(l1, l2, l3, l4, l5) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)/ \u221a 5. The last one is the admixture of Eg and T2g states. These states complement possible combinations of \u03b3i (i = 1\u2212 5). The comparison between the calculated results for such states and those for the steady states helps us to understand the relations between the pseudospin structures of a Cooper pair and the spin susceptibility. Note that (l1, l2, l3) = (1, 1, 0)/ \u221a 2 represents a possible order parameter in tetragonal symmetric superconductors with the high symmetry axis being the y direction [25]."

            "text": "As shown in the second term in Eq. (28), the anomalous Green\u2019s function contains the pairing correlation belonging to odd-frequency symmetry class. The stable superconducting states can be described by\n[~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3,~\u01ebk \u00b7 ~\u03b3]\u2212 = 0, (32) which means the absence of odd-frequency pairs. Oddfrequency pairs increase the free-energy of a uniform su-\n4 perconducting state [26] because they indicate the paramagnetic response to a magnetic field [27\u201329]. A phenomenological argument on the paramagnetic response of odd-frequency Cooper pairs is given in Appendix A of Ref. [30]. Eq. (32) gives a guide that relates the stable pair potential ~\u03b7 to the electronic structures ~\u01eb. To understand this situation, we briefly summarize the case of spin-triplet superconductors in the presence of a strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction \u03bb \u00b7 \u03c3 with\n\u03bb = \u03bbso(k\u0302yex \u2212 k\u0302xey), (33) where \u03bbso represents the amplitude of spin-orbit interaction, \u03c3j and ej for j = x, y and z are the Pauli matrix and the unit vector in spin space, respectively. The stable order parameter id \u00b7 \u03c3 \u03c3y is determined as\n[d \u00b7 \u03c3,\u03bb \u00b7 \u03c3]\u2212 = 0 or d \u2016 \u03bb, (34) so that odd-frequency pairs are absent and the transition temperature is optimal [26, 31]. Namely, the order parameter of a spin helical state is stable in this case. The pair potentials other than the helical state would be realized when the Rashba spin-orbit interaction is sufficiently weak. The choice in Eq. (34) and that in Eq. (32) are equivalent to each other. We choose the normal state dispersion ~\u01ebk so that Eq. (32) is satisfied for the pair potentials in Eqs. (29)-(31). The Green\u2019s function in the superconducting state can be expressed simply and analytically under Eq. (32). The results of the Green\u2019s function in such a case are shown in Appedix B.

(43) The results in Eq. (37)-(42) describe the characteristic features of the susceptibility of J = 3/2 superconductors.\nA. A1g state\nIn the presence of attractive interactions in an A1g channel, the pair potential is represented by Eqs. (18) and29). We always set ~e = ~h so that Eq. (32) is satisfied. Different from the s-wave spin-singlet pairing that also belongs to the A1g irrep, an A1g state in the pseudo-spin quintet pairing has the pseudospin degrees of freedom, which allows us to choose a variety of pseudospin structures. We first choose a pseudospin structure of a T2g irrep characterized by ~h = ~hT2g = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0)/ \u221a 3. The spin susceptibility is calculated as\n\u03c7\u00b5\u03bd =\u03c7N \u03b4\u00b5,\u03bd\n[ 1\u2212 1\n2\n( 1 +\nP\u2212 3P+\n) Q ] , (44)\nQ(T ) =\u03c0T \u2211\n\u03c9n\n\u22062 \u21263 . (45)\nIn BCS theory, Q represents the fraction of Cooper pairs to quasiparticles on the Fermi surface. Indeed Q is zero at T = Tc, increases monotonically with the decrease of T , and becomes unity at T = 0. The susceptibility tensor is diagonal and isotropic in real space. The susceptibility for a pseudospin structure of an Eg irrep characterized by ~h = ~hEg = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1)/ \u221a 2 results in,\n\u03c7\u00b5\u03bd =\u03c7N \u03b4\u00b5,\u03bd\n[ 1\u2212 1\n2\n( 1 +\np22 P+\n) Q ] . (46)\nThe susceptibility for an admixture of T2g and Eg irreps ( ~hT2g+Eg = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)/ \u221a 5) is also calculated as\n\u03c7\u00b5\u03bd =\u03c7N \u03b4\u00b5,\u03bd\n[ 1\u2212 1\n2\n( 1 + 1\n5\n) Q ] . (47)\nThe off-diagonal elements in the susceptibility tensor are always zero in these cases, (\u03c7\u00b5\u03bd = 0 for \u00b5 6= \u03bd). In Fig. 1(a), we plot the susceptibility at g3 = 0 as a function of temperature. The dependence of the pair potential on temperature is calculated by solving the gap equation in the weak coupling limit. As shown in Appedix C, the gap equation is common for all the superconducting states considered in the present paper and is identical to that in BCS theory. The results show that the susceptibility decreases with the decrease of temperature below Tc. The results are independent of such choices of the pseudospin structures as T2g, Eg, and T2g + Eg at g3 = 0. Although a Cooper pair has the angular momentum of J = 2 in the quintet states, the susceptibility is isotropic for all the pseudospin structures. The characteristic behaviors are independent of the strength of spin-orbit interaction \u03b2/\u03b1. The isotropic feature of the spin susceptibility is considered as a result of high symmetry of the pair potential. The pseudospin structures in the pair potential are characterized by \u03b3j which can be described by the linear combination of J\u00b5J\u03bd as shown in Eqs. (12)-(14). For a T2g irrep, \u03b3\nj for j = 1\u22123 characterize both the normal state dispersion and the pair potential. The pair potential with ~hT2g is symmetric under\nthe cyclic permutation among Jx, Jy and Jz. For an Eg irrep, the pair potential is symmetric under interchanging Jx \u2194 Jy. The structure of ~hEg results in the isotropic susceptibility including the z direction. Thus, the direction of a Zeeman field H in real space does not point a specific direction in pseudospin space. For comparison, we briefly mention the spin susceptibility in superfluid 3He B-phase described by\nd = \u2206(k\u0302xex + k\u0302yey + k\u0302zez). (48)\nThe pair potential is symmetric under the cyclic permutation among x, y and z. As a result, the susceptibility plotted with a broken line in Fig. 1(b) is isotropic in real space. At the end of the subsection, we briefly discuss the effects of J3\u00b5 term on the spin susceptibility by choosing g3 = g1. The results are shown in Fig. 1(c). The isotropic nature of the susceptibility remains unchanged even for g3 = g1. The amplitude of the susceptibility depends on the pseudospin structure of the pair potential; the amplitude for a T2g irrep becomes slightly larger than that for an Eg irrep.\nB. T2g state\nWhen attractive interactions between two electrons work in a T2g or an Eg channel, the order parameters in Eqs. (30) and (31) are isotropic in momentum space. To satisfy Eq. (32), we switch off ~\u01eb = 0 and consider a simple pseudospin quintet superconductor in the following subsections. In other words, the pair potentials independent of momenta are stable when |~\u01eb| is sufficiently smaller than the Fermi energy \u00b5. Even if we choose ~\u01eb = 0, superconductors show the rich magnetic response depending on the pseudospin structures of the pair potential. The\neffects of the pseudospin-dependent dispersions ~\u01eb 6= 0 on the magnetic response will be discussed later. We first discuss a T2g state with (l1, l2, l3) =\n(1, 1, 1)/ \u221a 3. In addition to the diagonal element given by Eq.(44), the susceptibility has the off-diagonal elements as\n\u03c7xy =\u03c7yz = \u03c7zx = \u2212\u03c7N 1\n3 Q. (49)\nThe results for g3 = 0 are displayed in Fig. 2(a). The pair potential includes off-diagonal terms J\u00b5 J\u03bd with \u00b5 6= \u03bd through \u03b3j for j = 1\u2212 3 as shown in Eqs. (12)-(14). The first term of L\u00b5\u03bd(~\u03b7) in Eqs. (40)-(42) is the direct results of such pseudospin structure. Since the pair potential is independent of wavenumber, these off-diagonal terms remain nonzero values even after averaging over directions in momentum space on the Fermi surface. Thus, the appearance of the off-diagonal elements in the susceptibility tensor is a characteristic feature of a T2g state. Secondly, we display the susceptibility for a T2g state\nwith (l1, l2, l3) = (1, 1, 0)/ \u221a 2 in Fig. 2(b), where we delete \u03b33 component from Eq. (31). As a result, Jy is no longer equivalent to Jx and Jz , which explains the anisotropy of the diagonal elements in Fig. 2(b). As shown in Eqs. (40)-(42), the off-diagonal elements are finite only for the multi-component pair potentials. At the present case, only the \u03c7zx element remains finite because of l3 = 0. Finally, we display the susceptibility for a T2g state\nwith (l1, l2, l3) = (1, 0, 0)/ \u221a 2 in Fig. 2(c), which has only \u03b31 component. The diagonal elements are anisotropic as they are in Fig. 2(b). All the off-diagonal elements vanish because the pair potential has only one pseudospin component. Thus, the off-diagonal elements emerge if \u03b3i and \u03b3j (i, j = 1, 2, 3; i 6= j) coexist in the pair potential. In particular, the nonzero off-diagonal ele-\n6 ments are determined from the direction of high symmetry axis in tetragonal symmetric superconductors, e.g., \u03c7xy = \u03c7yz = 0 and \u03c7zx 6= 0 for the pair potential with (l1, l2, l3) = (1, 1, 0)/ \u221a 2 since the high symmetry axis is the y direction."

(53)\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3(a). All the off-diagonal elements vanish as shown in Eqs. (40)-(42). The product of \u03b34 \u03b35 does not include such off-diagonal terms as J\u00b5J\u03bd with \u00b5 6= \u03bd, which explains the absence of the off-diagonal elements in the susceptibility tensor. The diagonal elements of the susceptibility becomes anisotropic due to the last term in Eqs. (37) and (38). The product of \u03b34 \u03b35 includes \u2212J4x + J4y , which breaks symmetry between Jx and Jy. As a result, the last term in Eq. (37) and that in Eq. (38) have the opposite signs to each other. Thus the anisotropy in the susceptibility is a characteristic feature of an Eg state. The degree of the anisotropy in an Eg state is rather weaker than that in a spin-triplet superconductor. For comparison, in Fig. 1(b), we plot the susceptibility of a spin-triplet helical state characterized by d \u2016 \u03bb in Eq. (33) with two solid lines. When a Zeeman field is perpendicular to d, the susceptibility is a constant across Tc. The results for H \u2016 d, on the other hand, the susceptibility decreases down to (1/2)\u03c7N. These behaviors are independent of the amplitudes of \u03bbso > 0. In spin-triplet superconductors, both the dimension in spin space and that in real space are three. Therefore, it is possible to define two different directions relatively to the direction of a Zeeman field: (d \u2016 H and d \u22a5 H). The clear anisotropy of the susceptibility in Fig. 1(b) is a result of the dimensional consistency between in spin space and in real space. In Fig. 3(b) and (c), we display the results for the single component states with (l4, l5) = (1, 0) and (0, 1), respectively. They are possible order parameters of Eg states in the presence of time-reversal symmetry [25]. We find the relation\n\u03c7xx = \u03c7yy 6= \u03c7zz, (54)\nbecause the last term in Eqs.

The spin susceptibility is plotted as a function of temperature for a Eg state in (a).\nthat the anisotropic response like Eq. (54) and the absense of off-diagonal elements are the common feature of the single component order parameter.\nD. Admixture of T2g and Eg states\nThe results for a the admixture of T2g and Eg states,\n(i. e., (l1, l2, l3, l4, l5) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)/ \u221a 5), are calculated as\n\u03c7xx =\u03c7N\n[ 1\u2212 1\n2\n( 1 + P+ \u2212 4 \u221a 3p21\n5P+\n) Q ] , (55)\n\u03c7yy =\u03c7N\n[ 1\u2212 1\n2\n( 1 + P+ + 4 \u221a 3p21\n5P+\n) Q ] , (56)\n\u03c7zz =\u03c7N\n[ 1\u2212 1\n2\n( 1 + 1\n5\n) Q ] . (57)\nThe off-diagonal elements are calculated in the similar way,\n\u03c7xy =\u2212 \u03c7N Q P+ \u2212 2\n\u221a 3 p1 p2\n5P+ , (58)\n\u03c7yz =\u2212 \u03c7NQ P+ +\n\u221a 3 p1 p2(1\u2212 \u221a 3)\n5P+ , (59)\n\u03c7zx =\u2212 \u03c7NQ P+ +\n\u221a 3 p1 p2(1 + \u221a 3)\n5P+ . (60)\nThe calculated results for g3 = 0 are plotted in Fig. 3(d). Not only the diagonal elements but also the off-diagonal elements are anisotropic. All the elements in Eqs. (37)- (42) are finite and different from one another. The degree\n7 of the anisotropy in the diagonal elements are weaker than that in Eg state and stronger than that in T2g state. The characteristic features of the susceptibility displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 retain even if we consider J3\u00b5 term in the Zeeman Hamiltonian. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of the pseudospindependent dispersion ~\u01eb on the characteristic behaviors of the susceptibility. When we switch on ~\u01eb in T2g and Eg states, Eq. (32) is no longer holds. As a result, the additional terms such as\nCf 2\ni\u03c9n [~\u03b7k \u00b7 ~\u03b3,~\u01ebk \u00b7 ~\u03b3]\u2212 = Cf i\u03c9n \u2211\ni6=j\n\u01ebi \u03b7j \u03b3 i \u03b3j , (61)\nappear at the numerator of the anomalous Green\u2019s function in Eq. (B3), where Cf is a constant. Such components represent the admixture of pseudospin-triplet and the pseudospin-septet pairing correlations [19]. Their contribution to the susceptibility tensor is proportional to\nC2f \u03c9 2 nTr\n  \u2211\ni6=j\n\u01ebi \u03b7j\u03b3 i\u03b3j J\u0303\u00b5\n\u2211\nk 6=l\n\u01ebk \u03b7l\u03b3 k\u03b3l J\u0303\u03bd   , (62)\nwhich modify the susceptibility tensor, However, they do not always cancel the off-diagonal elements in Fig. 2(a) in a T2g state. They do not wash out the anisotropy of the diagonal elements in Fig. 3 in Eg states. The results in Figs. 1-3 suggest that the behaviors of the susceptibility depends sensitively on the orbital symmetry and the pseudospin structures of the pair potential. In particular, the appearance of the off-diagonal elements in the susceptibility tensor is a unique feature to J = 3/2 superconductors."

            "text": "We have studied theoretically the spin susceptibility of pseudospin-quintet pairing states in a J = 3/2 superconductor that preserves cubic lattice symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Within the linear response to a Zeeman field, we calculate the spin susceptibility by using the Green\u2019s function that is obtained by solving the Gor\u2019kov equation analytically. The pair potentials are chosen so that a superconducting state is stable under the pseudospin structures in the normal state. The calculated results indicat that the magnetic response of pseudospin-quintet states depends sensitively on the pseudospin structures of the pair potential. The susceptibility tensor in A1g states is isotropic in real space as that in the B-phase of superfluid 3He. For Eg states, the susceptibility tensor becomes anisotropic in real space. We found in a T2g state that the susceptibility tensor has the off-diagonal elements."

Some bosonic excitation usually mediates the attractive interactions. In this Appendix, we assume the attractive interaction phenomenologically and\n10\nderive the gap equation for superconducting states discussed in this paper. The pair potential of the superconducting states is defined by\n\u2206\u03b1,\u03b2(k\u0302) = 1\nVvol\n\u2211\nk\u2032\n\u2211\n\u03bb,\u03c4\nV\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03bb,\u03b3(k \u2212 k\u2032) \u3008ck\u2032,\u03bb c\u2212k\u2032,\u03c4 \u3009 = \u2212 1\nVvol\n\u2211\nk\u2032\nT \u2211\n\u03c9n\n\u2211\n\u03bb,\u03c4\nV\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03bb,\u03c4 (k \u2212 k\u2032)F\u03bb,\u03c4 (k\u2032, \u03c9n), (C1)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb, and \u03c4 are the indices of pseudospin of an electron. The attractive interaction V\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03bb,\u03c4 works on two electrons with \u03bb and \u03c4 and generats the pair potential between two electrons with \u03b1 and \u03b2. The attractive interaction can be decomposed as\nV\u03b1,\u03b2;\u03bb,\u03c4 (k \u2212 k\u2032) = \u2211\n\u03bd=1\u22125\ng\u03bd(k \u2212 k\u2032) (\u03b3\u03bd UT )\u03b1,\u03b2 (\u03b3\u03bd UT )\u2217\u03bb,\u03c4 . (C2)\nFor A1g states in Sec. III A, we choose\ng\u03bd(k \u2212 k\u2032) = { g c\u03bd(k\u0302) c\u03bd(k\u0302 \u2032) \u03bd = 1\u2212 3\n0 \u03bd = 4, 5 T2g irreps (C3)\ng\u03bd(k \u2212 k\u2032) = {\n0 \u03bd = 1\u2212 3 g c\u03bd(k\u0302) c\u03bd(k\u0302 \u2032) \u03bd = 4, 5 Eg irreps (C4)\ng\u03bd(k \u2212 k\u2032) =g c\u03bd(k\u0302) c\u03bd(k\u0302\u2032), \u03bd = 1\u2212 5 T2g + Eg irreps. (C5)\nBy substituting the anomalous Green\u2019s function in Eq. (B3) into Eq. (C1), we obtain the gap equation\n\u2206 = T \u2211\n\u03c9n\ngN0\n\u222b d\u03be Bf \u2206\nZS , (C6)\nwhere we have used Eq. (8). After integrating over \u03be, we obtain\n1 = gN0T \u2211\n\u03c9n\n1\u221a \u03c92n +\u2206 2 . (C7)\nThe results coinsides with the gap equation in BCS theory. For T2g, Eg, and an admixture state of them in Sec. III B and C, we replace c\u03bd(k\u0302) by 1 for all \u03bd in Eqs. (C3)-(C5). The gap equation for such states is identical to Eq. (C7).\n[1] C.
