Based on the provided text, here are the portions that mention future research directions or calls for action:

1. "The current commentary is a plea to social and sustainability scientists, particularly to economists dealing with sustainable agri-food systems, to dig deeper into the notion of narratives to trigger societal dynamics that stir consumers toward more sufficient lifestyles."

2. "Drawing from this argument, we make a plea to social and sustainability scientists to dig deeper into the notion of narratives and their role to trigger environmentally sustainable societal dynamics."

3. "One of the most pressing issues on this topic is identifying visionary narratives able to act as catalyst of sustainable individual behaviors, and even revert overconsumption."

4. "This commentary seeks to contribute to this debate making a plea for the development of narratives evoking human-nature interdependence."

5. "We call for a joint effort in shaping narratives able to stimulate the interpretation of the world in terms of Coupled Human And Natural Systems (CHANS)."

6. "We highlight the need to subject the current influential Circular Economy (CE) narrative to a new scrutiny."

7. "Economist can give crucial contribution to food systems transformation regarding the consumption sphere, with microeconomic analysis shedding light on consumers’ choices under scarcity and individuals’ trade-offs between different objectives."

8. "A legitimate self-reflection for agricultural and food economists could inspire fruitful collaborations with other social sciences and environmental humanities, meant to draw attention to more complex and nuanced understandings of social systems and related food consumption behaviors."

9. "This interdisciplinary collaboration—encompassing different perspectives on human behavior, methodologies, and value considerations—can help to developing narratives that go beyond purely economic efficiency and account for broader societal and environmental values."

These excerpts suggest areas for future research and action, focusing on the development of narratives, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a deeper investigation into the dynamics of sustainable consumption and the circular economy.
