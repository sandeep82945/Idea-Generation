    "abstractText": "The quantitative description of the supramolecular interaction occurring at the adhesion surfaces of different polymers has enabled elaborate dissections of contributions to cohesive and surface energies. An alternative analysis is proposed here based on solubility parameters and binding constants that traditionally describe the weakest and relatively larger association energies in polymer blends. The article emphasizes a feature of supramolecular polymers that has not received adequate consideration: The dynamic bond scrambling that allows a most efficient molecular recognition over significant areas of synthetic and biological surfaces.",

Adhesion, wetting and bond scrambling\nAlberto Ciferri*\nChemistry Department, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States\nThe quantitative description of the supramolecular interaction occurring at the adhesion surfaces of different polymers has enabled elaborate dissections of contributions to cohesive and surface energies. An alternative analysis is proposed here based on solubility parameters and binding constants that traditionally describe the weakest and relatively larger association energies in polymer blends. The article emphasizes a feature of supramolecular polymers that has not received adequate consideration: The dynamic bond scrambling that allows a most efficient molecular recognition over significant areas of synthetic and biological surfaces.\nKEYWORDS\ncohesive energy, surface energy, solubility parameters, binding constants, adhesion, wetting, molecular recognition, bond scrambling\nIntroduction\nAdhesion is the ability of two phases, usually two solid surfaces of similar or dissimilar substances, to bind (cling together) by virtue of supramolecular interaction or mechanical interlocking. Wetting is the term used in the case of a solid-liquid interface Awaja et al., (2009). Typical practical examples involving polymers include coating and painting (Zheng, 2020), wetting as in the printing ink industry (Cern et al., 2021), cases in which adhesion is enhanced by promoters (i.e., chemicals that act at the interface between an organic polymer and an inorganic substrate) (Peter, 2011). Relevant are also cases of selfhealing (when two fractured surfaces of the same polymer will seal again if brought in close contact) (Ciferri, 2013). Among biological materials, the enzyme-substrate complex shows a remarkable association mechanism, extending to the most complex cases of cell adhesion associated with a variety of function (Buckley et al., 1998; Ciferri, 2021).\nThere is not a general molecular theory for chemical adhesion. However, several studies have highlighted the need of dissecting the supramolecular components of cohesive and surface energies that control solubility, surface wettability and the strength of the interfacial association (Hansen, 2007; Abdullah et al., 2015; Nanoscience Instruments; Ciferri, 2021). The present note includes a review of cohesive and surface energies and suggests the application of the classical parameters that control the interactions of supramolecular polymers, emphasizing their bond scrambling features."

            "text": "The cohesive energy (\u03c9coh) of a substance in the bulk phase is defined by the internal energy per mole that results from the balance of all its supramolecular interactions (Flory, 1953; Hildebrand et al., 1970; Burke, 1984). Cohesive energy densities can be rigorously determined using ab initio calculations (Abdullah et al., 2015). For low molecular weight substances, the cohesive energy is the energy required to evaporate the material, assessed from the heat of vaporization in calories per cubic centimeter. For materials that decompose before evaporating, cohesive energies are often evaluated from known group contributions (Marsano et al., 1984).\nCohesive energy is also related to solubility parameters. The Hildebrand solubility parameter (\u03b4) is defined by the square root of the cohesive energy density (Hildebrand et al., 1970):\n\u03b4 \u0394H/V( )1/2 (1)\nwhere \u0394H is the measurable enthalpy of vaporization and V the molar volume. The Hildebrand solubility parameter is related to the Flory-Huggins solubility parameter \u03c7 (Flory, 1953):\n\u03c712 z\u0394\u03c9/kT (2)\nwhere z is the coordination number and \u0394\u03c9 expresses the energy change upon rupture of contacts between each of the two components of a mixture with formation of new contacts between these components (Flory, 1953):\n\u0394\u03c9 \u03c912 \u2212 1/2 \u03c911 + \u03c922( ) (3)\nThe concept of solubility is relevant to the description of cohesive energy since it involves the rupture and the association of two compounds. The relationship between the Hildebrand and the Flory-Huggins solubility parameters is:\n\u03c712 V1/RT \u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42( )2 (4)\nwhere \u03b41 and \u03b42 are the solubility parameters of solvent and polymer, and V1 is the molar volume of the solvent (Hildebrand et al., 1970).\nThe Flory-Huggins free energy of mixing real solutions (Flory, 1953) includes different contributions, in particular one expressing the ideal mixing entropy, another expressing weak interactions through the diluent parameter \u03c7 (Flory, 1953), and another expressing stronger attractive interactions through binding constant kj (Orofino et al., 1967). A relevant expression for the melting temperature depression of a polymer in a binary diluent is (Orofino et al., 1967):\n1/Tm \u2212 1/T0m R/\u0394\u0397( ) v1\u2212 x12 v21( ) + R/\u0394\u0397( ) pln 1 + Kjcj( ) (5)\nOn the right-hand side (RHS), \u03c712 and Kj equal zero for an ideal solution, p is the number of binding sites and cj represents the activity of a binding agent. Different solvents and different binding agents (i.e., water, salts. . ..) can be evaluated with the latter equation. Corresponding Kj could be evaluated from enrichment data (Orofino et al., 1967). We discuss separately the cases of weak and relatively stronger interactions."

They demonstrated that the validity or self-consistency of the above relationships is restricted to systems with low polarity, primarily due to van der Waals interactions.\nThey analyzed different solvents and model substances that included three components, namely dispersive (London) interactions (induced by transient dipoles even in non-polar molecules), polar (Debye) interactions between permanent dipoles, and Keeson interactions between permanent and induced dipoles (Hiemenz and Rajagopalan, 1997). Table 1 reveals that the global van der Waals interactions are the weakest supramolecular interactions, having association strength below 1 kcal/mol and active separation distances smaller than about 0.5 nm. Corresponding \u03c712 values evaluated by Blanks and Prausnitz are in the range \u22120.1 to + 0.516.\nTable 2 evidences a more detailed evaluation of the separate contributions to van der Waals interaction. The results are based on a sophisticated approach, primarily the temperature and enthalpies of evaporation (Hiemenz and Rajagopalan, 1997).\nIncluded are representative data for molecules chosen as to have comparable values of dipolar moment and polarizability (the latter is a measure of the easiness of electrons to move around the molecule in response to an external electric field or a neighboring dipole) (Hiemenz and Rajagopalan, 1997). The data show that dispersive London interactions are generally prevailing. Nevertheless, the dipolar moment and the molecular polarizability also have a role, complicating the assignment of the various contributions. Additional difficulties have been more recently reported, suggesting that solvents may mitigate the intensity of the components evaluated from vaporization enthalpies (Young et al., 2013). In fact, cohesive solvent-solvent interactions (cf., Eq. 3) were found to be the major driving force for apolar association in solution (Young et al., 2013)."

            "text": "Stronger specific interactions occurring between polymeric solutes may be described by a binding constant (Orofino et al., 1967). An example is the electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in another one forming the intermolecular hydrogen bond having dissociation constants in the range 10\u201330 kcal/mol (Steiner, 2002), see Table 1. Other strong interactions include \u03d6-\u03d6 (Ma et al., 2021), hydrophobic and ion binding interactions (see Table 1). Ion binding typical of salting-in ions in the Hofmeister series (i.e., calcium ions) can also induce intra or intermolecular bridges (Ciferri et al., 2012).\nAn approach allowing a quantitative assessment of weak van der Waals and stronger bonding contributions is afforded by the generalized Flory-Huggins Eq. 5. The \u03c712 parameters and equilibrium constants for ionic interactions were evaluated from viscosity analysis and enrichment data for gelatin-water solutions in the presence of salts of the Hofmeister series (Ciferri et al., 2012). The analysis provided definite evidence that the solubility of proteins is controlled by van der Waals interactions in the case of typical salting-out agents (i.e., KCl) and by specific binding in the case of typical salting-in agents (i.e., CaCl2) (Ciferri et al., 2012). No values for Kw relevant to H-bonding were reported.\nAn alternative thermodynamic approach to describe the simultaneous occurrence of weak and specific supramolecular interactions was elaborated by Hanson (Hansen, 2007). He suggested that the global interaction could be dissected into three additive components characterizing, respectively, the dispersive (London), polar (Debye) and hydrogen bonding contributions.\n\u03c3 \u03c3d + \u03c3p + \u03c3h (6)\nVarious analytical approaches were elaborated to dissect the three components from raw solubility data.

The solubility behavior relevant to a variety of technological processes was reasonably well described by the Hansen parameters (Hansen, 2007). These parameters were also used to assess the compatibility between a dispersed and a continuous phase (Bapat et al., 2021).\nSpecific selections of the relevant components of the cohesive energy may be relevant to special formulations for industry (Abdullah et al., 2015; Haixia et al., 2021)."

            "text": "Within a bulk phase, the interaction forces on an atom/ molecule are mutually equilibrated whereas unbalanced interactions prevail at the surface. Such an unbalanced energy is referred to as the surface \u201cenergy\u201d in the case of attractive interactions between two solid substances. Surface \u201ctension\u201d is instead when liquids are involved. The surface energy/tension increases with number of bulk interactions. A high surface energy refers to a strong molecular attraction, whereas a low surface energy refers to a weak molecular attraction or low compatibility (cph Deutschland Chemie GmbH, 2020; Brighton Science, 2021).\nWhereas adhesion is the term preferentially uses for association of two solid surfaces, wetting is used when a liquid spreads over a solid. In contrast to wetting, an incompatible liquid will form a drop characterized by a contact angle. The boundary between solid-solid or solidliquid systems is referred to as the interface (cph Deutschland Chemie GmbH, 2020; Brighton Science, 2021).\nSurface energy is often assessed using contact angle data obtained for solid-liquid systems. The Yung equation allows a quantitative relationship between the surface energies of solid and liquids (\u03c3s and \u03c3l), the interfacial tension between liquid and solid (\u03c3sl ) and the angle (\u03b8) between the liquid on the solid (Data Physics Instruments):\n\u03c3s \u03c3sl + \u03c3l cos\u019f (7)\nSeveral methods for the evaluation of the surface tension of solids and liquids are described in the literature. Contact angles of test liquids may be used (Cheng et al., 1990). In the case of\nincompatible liquids, determination of contact angles with an optical goniometer may be facilitated by drop shape analysis (Bouge et al., 1986).\nThere is some evidence that surface energy is affected by chain conformation (Flory, Statistical, 1969; Chalykh, 2020; Dataphysics, 2021). The bulk conformation of flexible polymers is often described as that prevailing under theta conditions when excluded volume effects are balanced by supramolecular attraction. More rigid polymers are characterized by parallel orientation of the macromolecular chains in the surface layer (Dataphysics, 2021). The latter effect has recently been shown to correspond to an enhancement of surface energy.\nA model for the adhesion mechanism proposed by Data Physics (Dataphysics) is based on only two types of surface energy, one involving transient dipoles (included in dispersive interactions, cf. Table 1) and the other polar (Debye and H-bond) interactions.\n\u03c3 \u03c3d + \u03c3p (8)\nThese interactions were schematized on a simple figure in which the adhesion of two surfaces was promoted by the recognition of the two types of bonds (Figure 1A) (Dataphysics). The model based on our Eq. 5 is also based on just two types of interactions: one based on the \u03c712 parameter (representing all weak interactions of the van der Waals type, the other all strong interactions described by an equilibrium constant K). Thus, we include in Figure 1B a schematization of how two surfaces should bind, consistently with general principles of supramolecular polymers (Ciferri, 2016; Ciferri, 2020)."

            "heading": "Bond scrambling",
            "text": "Bond scrambling is a fundamental motion occurring in processes such as reversible chemical reactions and supramlecular associations, both characterized by small equilibrium constants. In these processes, an active terminal group continues to associate and dissociate various complementary groups. The motion greatly assists the recognition of binding partners even in the absence of mechanical sliding or main chains reorganization. A dynamic equilibrium will be reached when the rates of association and dissociation with adjacent oligomers are equal. Under equilibrium, alteration of the composition of the reactants (i.e., the degree of polymerization, DP) is not allowed and a direct relationship between DP and the binding constant is predicted and experimentally verified (i.e., DP ~ K1/2) (Ciferri, 2016). Nevertheless, bond scrambling motion can affect some labile structurization.\nAs first suggested by J. M. Lehn, bond scrambling allows the elimination of steric constraints in supramolecular\nFIGURE 2 Breaking e chain entanglements relieves steric constraints.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org04\nnetworks (i.e., entanglements, see schematization in Figure 2) (CiferriBond and Network Elasticity, 2009). These networks have indeed been described as dynamic materials having adaptive features (Cordier et al., 2008). Similar features have been documented even for hydrogels (Sinawang et al., 2020). Moreover, scrambling has also been shown to induce the randomization of ordered sequences (Bleiholder et al., 2008). The role of scrambling in promoting a chain size distributions has also been documented (Matula et al., 1964; Moedritzer, 1964).\nParticularly relevant to surface recognition is the self-healing of freshly fractured surfaces of a given polymer (Cordier et al., 2008; CiferriBond and Network Elasticity, 2009). In this case, it could be argued that the detailed location and orientation of proton donors and acceptors of the H-bonds, severed during fracture, might have been only slightly altered, thus aiding the recognition process.\nA more complex mismatch between the position and orientation of the H-bond components is instead expected when two different surfaces of a non-fractured polymer are adhering. Complex rearrangement of the chains connecting the various components has been frequently suggested. However, bond scrambling could enhance the recognition of different surfaces.\nA related feature of surface recognition is exhibited by biological systems. In the case of the enzyme-substrate association, newmaterial is synthesized to fill empty cavities occurring between two adhering surfaces (Figure 3) (Ciferri, 2021)."

The quantitative evaluation of van der Waals supramolecular interactions is particularly complicated by the low values of some of the energies involved.\nVarious authors have therefore avoided direct measurements of the weakest components of the surface energy (cf. Eqs 6, 8). The approach suggested here, based on Eq. 5, likewise avoids a detailed evaluation of the van der Waals energy components, but has the advantage of extending to adhesion process concepts and parameters proper to supramolecular chemistry. Wettability might indeed be regarded as the first step in the dissolution of a solvophilic particle in excess solvent. The uncompensated bonds on the external boundary of the particle are saturated by bond exchange with solvent molecules. Dispersive interactions do not prevent the dissolution of the first polymer layer, and the above binding-dissolution sequence is transferred to successive layers on the particle.\nIt is to be noticed that here is not a clear-cut boundary between the energies represented by \u03c712 and very small binding constants. The identification might be regarded as an operational one, depending upon how small K can be measured.\nThe present emphasis on the scrambling features of supramolecular polymers highlights a new mechanism that amplifies the local recognition process. Intense motions of chain segments connecting supramolecular groups, or mechanical sliding motions of the surfaces need no longer be postulated. Awaja et al., 2009; Data Physics Instruments, 2021."
