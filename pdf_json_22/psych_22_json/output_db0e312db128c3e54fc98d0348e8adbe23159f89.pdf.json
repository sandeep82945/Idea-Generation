    "abstractText": "Background: Having a child with autism spectrum disorder can have significant psychological effects on parents. This systematic review summarizes the current state of literature underscoring the impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on parents in Arab countries Methods: A systematic search of seven databases (PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Scholar, ERIC, Academic Search Complete, and PsycINFO) was performed, which identified 24 studies (20 quantitative studies and four qualitative studies) that included 3,299 parents or caregivers of children with ASD. These studies were conducted in 10 Arab countries (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Emirates, Palestine, Qatar, and Lebanon). Results: The majority of the included studies found that ASD has a significant negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of Arab parents. It was found that parents of children with ASD have a poor quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk of psychological disorders. These findings were in contrast to findings of parents of typically developing children and children with other developmental disorders. Challenges faced by parents of children with ASD were associated with several childand parent-related factors. The most common coping strategy used by parents was religious coping. Conclusion: The impact of ASD on parents has only recently gained traction among researchers in Arab countries. Despite several knowledge gaps, published studies have provided useful information outlining the impact of ASD on parents in some of these countries. Further research comprising larger random samples and using varied research and data-collection methods is required to understand the multifaceted challenges experienced by parents raising children with ASD in Arab countries.",

Hadidi 1 and Wissam Mounzer 2\n1Department of Special Education, The University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, 2Department of Special Education, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden\nBackground: Having a child with autism spectrum disorder can have significant\npsychological effects on parents. This systematic review summarizes the current state\nof literature underscoring the impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on parents in\nArab countries\nMethods: A systematic search of seven databases (PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest,\nGoogle Scholar, ERIC, Academic Search Complete, and PsycINFO) was performed,\nwhich identified 24 studies (20 quantitative studies and four qualitative studies) that\nincluded 3,299 parents or caregivers of children with ASD. These studies were conducted\nin 10 Arab countries (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Emirates,\nPalestine, Qatar, and Lebanon).\nResults: The majority of the included studies found that ASD has a significant negative\nimpact on the mental health and wellbeing of Arab parents. It was found that parents of\nchildren with ASD have a poor quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk of psychological\ndisorders. These findings were in contrast to findings of parents of typically developing\nchildren and children with other developmental disorders. Challenges faced by parents\nof children with ASD were associated with several child- and parent-related factors. The\nmost common coping strategy used by parents was religious coping.\nConclusion: The impact of ASD on parents has only recently gained traction among\nresearchers in Arab countries. Despite several knowledge gaps, published studies have\nprovided useful information outlining the impact of ASD on parents in some of these\ncountries. Further research comprising larger random samples and using varied research\nand data-collection methods is required to understand the multifaceted challenges\nexperienced by parents raising children with ASD in Arab countries.\nKeywords: autism spectrum disorder, Arab countries, parents, caregivers, stress, burden, wellbeing, quality of life"

            "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that intersects racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic boundaries, and is characterized by persistent impairments in social interactions, verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Over the past three decades, there has been a global increase in the prevalence of ASD (Elsabbagh et al., 2012; Blaxill et al., 2022).\nExtensive research indicates that parents of children with ASD often experience elevated levels of parenting stress (Hoffman et al., 2009), increased mental health problems (Cohrs and Leslie, 2017), and reduced physical health (Smith et al., 2012; Eisenhower et al., 2013) in contrast to parents of typically developing children (Ingersoll and Hambrick, 2011; Padden and James, 2017), and parents of children diagnosed with other disabilities (Hayes and Watson, 2013; Barroso et al., 2018). Furthermore, ASD significantly impacts family life as well as the marriage system (Karst and Van Hecke, 2012; Serrata, 2012; Pisula and Porebowicz-D\u00f6rsmann, 2017).\nIncreasing evidence suggests that the impact of ASD on parents may be attributed to the severity of the emotional and behavioral problems exhibited by the child (Leyfer et al., 2006; Baker et al., 2012; Karst and Van Hecke, 2012). Furthermore, this is exacerbated by exhaustive caregiving demands, poor parental coping capabilities, lack of support (Weiss et al., 2014; Papadopoulos, 2021), economic burden (Ou et al., 2015), as well as the perception and understanding of ASD among parents (Ilias et al., 2018).\nThe literature also suggests that cultural background is an\nimportant variable to consider when analyzing the impact of ASD on parents (Ilias et al., 2018; Zakirova-Engstrand et al., 2020). Parents\u2019 awareness and beliefs about the etiology and prognosis of ASD can affect parental responses, coping strategies, as well as treatment decision-making (Hebert and Koulouglioti, 2010; Zuckerman et al., 2016; Brewton et al., 2021).\nThe majority of ASD research has been conducted across the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) (Clark and Adams, 2020; Roche et al., 2021), in contrast to other parts of the world where research on ASD is relatively limited (Samadi\nand McConkey, 2011; Rice et al., 2012). In Arab countries, ASD is a new field of research that has gradually evolved in the past two decades. However, severe information disparities with regards to the different aspects of ASD have been noted, namely, epidemiology, characteristics, burden, as well as support available to children and families.\nTo date, four literature reviews have been published on ASD research in Arab countries (Hussein and Taha, 2013; Salhia et al., 2014; Alnemary et al., 2017; Alallawi et al., 2020). Alallawi et al. (2020) conducted a systematic scoping review of social, educational, and psychological research relevant to persons with ASD and their families in Arab countries. Using eight databases, Alallawi et al. (2020) identified 70 studies published predominantly by researchers from Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Most of the identified studies investigated the prevalence of\nASD; diagnosis issues; the experiences and outcomes of Arab caregivers for individuals with ASD; as well as the social and communication behavior of Arab individuals with ASD. The results of the scoping review revealed significant gaps in research related to ASD interventions and services. Furthermore, upon appraisal of the identified studies, the authors found them to be of low quality.\nAlnemary et al. (2017) reviewed published research on ASD in the Arab world from 1992 to 2014. The authors searched for studies published in English using PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. In total, the authors identified 142 publications that were produced mostly by researchers in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Oman. For the most part, these publications addressed the biology, risk factors, and diagnosis of ASD. However, limited studies investigated intervention, services, infrastructure and surveillance, or life span issues related to ASD.\nHussein and Taha (2013) analyzed published literature on ASD in the Arab world from 1992 to 2012 using the Medline database. In total, 79 articles were identified that focused predominantly on the etiology of ASD as opposed to services and interventions.\nFinally, Salhia et al. (2014) conducted a systemic review of the epidemiology of ASD in Arab Gulf countries, namely, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain. The literature search was conducted using PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. However, limited studies investigating the epidemiology of ASD were identified by the authors. Those studies showed a prevalence rate ranging from 1.4 to 29 per 10,000 persons. Furthermore, no studies explored the burden of ASD on the child, family, or society.\nDue to the limited scientific evidence available on challenges faced by parents raising children with ASD in Arab countries (Alnemary et al., 2017; Al Khateeb et al., 2019; Alallawi et al., 2020), the current systematic literature review was undertaken. This review aimed to address this crucial knowledge gap in ASD research by locating and synthesizing all studies underscoring the impact of ASD on parents in Arab countries."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "This systematic review was conducted to identify studies that addressed the impact of ASD on parents in Arab countries. The included studies were reviewed in terms of participants, general characteristics, methodology used, and the main findings. This review found that the impact of ASD on parents and caregivers has only recently gained traction among researchers in some Arab countries. Approximately 80% of the studies included in this review were conducted in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, and Bahrain. Most of these studies used cross-sectional study designs and included non-random samples. Furthermore,\nthe study participants of the included studies comprised more mothers than fathers. Moreover, most of the included studies did not distinguish between the different subtypes of ASD.\nThe majority of studies found that ASD has a significant negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of Arab parents. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted in several countries, suggesting that parents of children with ASD experience significant levels of stress, depression, and anxiety (Loukisas and Papoudi, 2016; Reddy et al., 2019; Papadopoulos, 2021). Consistent with previous research, this review also showed that parents of children with ASD in Arab countries have poorer QoL (Lee et al., 2008; Vasilopoulou and Nisbet, 2016). Thus, parents of children with ASD face an increased risk of developing psychological disorders in contrast to parents of both typically developing children and children with other developmental disorders (Karst and Van Hecke, 2012; Schnabel et al., 2020; Papadopoulos, 2021). In addition, several studies found that these parents reported a high caregiver burden (e.g., Estes et al., 2013; Picardi et al., 2018).\nStudies exploring the factors associated with stress in parents and caregivers of children with ASD are limited in Arab countries. These factors include the severity of ASD, social support, economic status, maternal education, financial hardship, marital status, parental age, and the gender of the child. Overall, these results are consistent with literature indicating a relationship between the impact of ASD on parents and various characteristics among the child and extended family (Karst and Van Hecke, 2012; Rivard et al., 2014; Iadarola et al., 2019).\nFurthermore, studies addressing the coping strategies used by parents raising children with ASD are even more limited in Arab countries. Although limited, these studies found that the most common coping strategy used by parents was religious coping followed by acceptance, positive reframing, withdrawal from the community, denial of the ASD diagnosis, increasing social interactions, and accessing information. Moreover, two studies found high levels of resilience in parents and caregivers. However, since the studies are limited, these results should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, most of the studies used selfreport questionnaires and lacked a qualitative measurement. As a result, socially desirable responses may have been provided by the parents and caregivers, underscoring the limitations of the data collection methods used.\nThe findings of this systematic review have several important implications for future research in Arab countries. Parents that have a child with ASD are severely impacted (Picardi et al., 2018). Despite the evidence provided by published studies about the impact of ASD on parents in Arab countries, there are still several knowledge gaps. For example, studies identified in this review provided minimal or no information about the impact of ASD on parental self-efficacy, physical health problems, marital relationships, or family socialization.\nFurthermore, further research is required to underscore the difference in the experience of the burden associated with raising a child with ASD between mothers and fathers. While several studies have indicated that mothers of children with ASD suffer from increased levels of mental health challenges and burdens compared to fathers, some studies\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 955442\nTABLE 1 | Overview of the included studies (n = 24).\nAuthor (year), country\nSample Study design Purpose Data collection\nmethod(s)\nKey findings\nAhmad and Dardas (2015), Jordan\n101 fathers of children with ASD\nQuantitative cross-sectional study\nIdentify variables that can potentially predict the psychological health of fathers of children with ASD World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL) \u2022 Fathers of children with ASD reported high levels of stress\n\u2022 Fathers\u2019 personal\ncharacteristics (parent distress and fathers\u2019 level of education) and characteristics of their children (difficult child characteristics and child\u2019s gender) significantly affected fathers\u2019 quality of life (QoL)\nAl Ansari et al.

First, only studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals were included in this review. The researchers excluded literature published in the Arabic language due to the severe lack of Arabic electronic databases. Furthermore, conducting a comprehensive manual search would have been a formidable task (Alkhateeb and Alhadidi, 2019). As a result, the included studies may not be representative of all the evidence (Morrison et al., 2012). Second, narrow search parameters were applied resulting in the exclusion of other potential sources of information such as conference papers and theses or dissertations that could uncover other relevant literature. Third, this review did not include a critical appraisal of the identified studies. Although the review was confined to studies published in peer-reviewed journals (71% of which had an Impact Factor >1.0), this does not necessarily guarantee the methodological quality of reviewed studies.
