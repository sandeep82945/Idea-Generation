    "abstractText": "This paper provides estimates of COVID-19 transmission rates and explains their evolution for selected European countries since the start of the pandemic taking account of changes in voluntary and government mandated social distancing, incentives to comply, vaccination and the emergence of new variants. Evidence based on panel data modeling indicates that the diversity of outcomes that we document may have resulted from the nonlinear interaction of mandated and voluntary social distancing and the economic incentives that governments provided to support isolation. The importance of these factors declined over time, with vaccine uptake driving heterogeneity in country experiences in 2021. Our approach also allows us to identify the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is precisely estimated around 5, which is much larger than the values in the range of 2.4\u20133.9 assumed in the extant literature.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed millions of lives and brought about very costly government interventions to contain it, with unprecedented and widespread economic disruption worldwide. China responded to the outbreak with strict policies, including binding and mandatory social distancing. These policies have initially proved successful in containing the epidemic in China, but later became much harder to sustain. At the other end of the spectrum, for example, Sweden initially attempted to let its epidemic run its course with only minimal interventions from the government. Other countries responded by adopting a mixture of policies, either by deliberate choice or due to popular opposition to the implementation of lock-downs or even milder forms of social distancing. What drives heterogeneity across countries in outcomes? As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved into a an endemic infectious disease in the midst of heated debates on the pros and cons of social distancing, what lessons do we learn for the management of future epidemics?\nIn this paper, we contribute toward answering these questions by providing estimates of COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers and explain their evolution for selected European countries since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, taking account of changes in voluntary and government mandated social distancing, economic support to comply with isolation, vaccination, and the emergence of new mutations.1 Although the European countries we focus on had similar patterns of transmissions at the beginning of the pandemic, they end up with quite different outcomes. We show that familiar factors such as social distancing, incentives to comply, or people\u2019s voluntary responses to the epidemic on their own cannot account for the heterogeneity of outcomes that we document across selected European countries over the period 2020-2021. Vaccine uptake, however, clearly becomes the dominant factor accounting for country differences in outcomes in 2021.\nReproduction numbers are epidemiological metrics to measure the spread of an infectious disease. The basic reproduction number, denoted by R0 , is the number of new infections expected to result from one infected individual at the start of the epidemic, assuming no interventions. Computation of the reproduction number is inherently model specific. Within a classical susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model, the basic reproduction number is given by R0 = 0\u2215 , where 0 is the initial (biological) transmission rate, and is the recovery rate. Since the transmissibility of a disease will vary over time due to changes in immunity, mitigation policies, or voluntary precautionary behavior, the effective reproduction number, which we denote by Ret , measures the R number t periods after the initial outbreak. As we show in the paper, in the classical SIR model, we have Ret = ( 1 \u2212 ct ) t\u2215 , where ct is the per capita number of infected cases at time t. As a result, conditional on this\n1 We only report the results for selected European countries in the paper, but compute rolling estimates of effective reproduction numbers and transmission rates for all jurisdictions for which Johns Hopkins University (JHU) reports case statistics. The estimation results for selected key countries and regions are available in the online supplement. Results for all countries in the JHU dataset and also our codes are available on the authors\u2019 websites (sites.google.com/site/alexanderchudik/, pesaran.com, sites.google. com/site/alessandrorebucciphd/).\nparticular epidemiological model, one can separate changes in Ret due the extent to which the susceptible population is shrinking, 1 \u2212 ct (which we call herding), or due to changes in the transmission rate, t . Social distancing, either voluntary due to precautionary behavior or mandatory due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (which we also call mitigation or containment policies for brevity), compliance with mandated measures, and immunity changes due to virus mutations or vaccination all lead to time-variation in the transmission rate.\nWe obtain estimates of time-varying transmission rates, t , using a moment condition recently derived by Pesaran and Yang (2021), henceforth PY from an agentbased stochastic network model of the epidemic diffusion. We extend the PY model to allow for time variations in underlying drivers of the aggregate transmission rate t , which in this model can approximately be written as tkt\u2215 t , where kt is the mean number of contacts during day t among the population, t is the mean exposure intensity to the virus given contact, and t \u2265 1 captures the mean immunity level in the population.\nOur estimation method only requires data on infected cases, thus complementing estimation methods that make use of death statistics. Both the reported number of infected cases and deaths are subject to important measurement issues, with different countries adopting different concepts and standards. In a number of countries, COVID-19 death statistics have undergone major revisions on several occasions. For example, the UK death toll was revised downward by 5377 on August 12, 2020, after a review concluded that daily death figures should only include deaths which had occurred within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test. We follow the medical evidence in Gibbons et\u00a0 al. (2014), and introduce a multiplication factor (MF) to allow for under-reporting of infected cases, and investigate the robustness of our results to different choices of MF.\nTo understand the potential factors behind the heterogeneous evolution of effective reproduction numbers in Europe, we separate the herding component (given by shrinking share of the susceptible individuals in the population) from the transmission rate, and empirically model the latter conditional on our chosen epidemiological model. In our set up, the transmission rate depends on the average number of contacts, individual-specific susceptibility to becoming infected, and the average exposure intensity given contacts, which in turn depends on wearing of face masks, and other recommended precautions, as well as the average degree of immunity in the population. Accordingly, in our empirical analysis we assume that a country\u2019s time-varying transmission rate potentially depends on five factors: mandatory and voluntary social distancing, economic support to comply with mandatory polices, vaccine uptake and virus mutations.\nConsistent with a simple decision theoretic model of voluntary social distancing presented in the paper and a large body of empirical evidence, we consider both government-mandated social distancing policies and voluntary self-isolation. We also control for government economic support that affects the incentive to comply as reported in survey data (e.g., Papageorge et\u00a0al. 2021; Hamermesh 2020). To proxy mandated-social distancing and incentives to comply with these policies we use the stringency and support indices compiled by Oxford COVID-19 Government\nResponse Tracker project.2 To assess the potential impact of voluntary social distancing, we allow for threshold effects capturing the impact of fear of becoming infected arising from news of rising cases on individual precautionary behavior.3 The importance of these factors in controlling the effective rate of transmission is jointly estimated within the context of the epidemic model. In 2021, virus mutations and vaccine availability and uptake became more prominent. Thus, we add to the baseline model the population share of vaccinated people and the Delta share of the confirmed sequenced cases, and we re-estimate the model through November 2021.\nWe focus on nine European countries with similar starts to the epidemic outbreak in March 2020, but with differing outcomes subsequently. In a pre-vaccine sample, we find that all determinants of the transmission rate considered in the paper are statistically highly significant and have the expected signs, and have been important in bring downing the effective production number, Ret , below unity over sustained periods. However, in the post-vaccine sample ending in November 2021, we find that vaccine uptake is the most important contributor to the decline in the effective transmission rate. In both samples, we estimate model-consistent basic reproduction numbers to lie between 5 and 6 for all the European countries that we consider, somewhat higher than the early estimates of around 3 reported in the literature and documented below.\nIn conclusion, our empirical analysis shows that mandatory and voluntary social distancing and incentives to comply were critical in bringing the reproduction number below one. Similarly, vaccine uptake in 2021 is estimated to be the most important factor contributing to the reduction in effective transmission rates, but the other factors continued to be salient.\nRelated Literature A very large body of research investigates the COVID-19 outbreak and the policies to contain its spread.4 For example, Fang et\u00a0al. (2020) analyze efforts to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China, measuring the effectiveness of the lock-down of Wuhan and showing that these policies also contributed significantly to reducing the total number of infections also outside of Wuhan. Similarly, there is ample reduced form evidence on the impact of mandatory social distancing using state and county level data in the case of the USA and for a few other countries. However, there are not many studies on the relative importance of mandatory and voluntary social distancing, especially comparative across countries.\nCaselli et\u00a0 al. (2020) find that both lock-downs and voluntary social distancing helped contain the first wave of COVID-19, but mandatory interventions have been critical. Jinjarak et\u00a0 al. (2020) find that more stringent policies are associated with lower mortality growth rates in a large cross section of countries but with some heterogeneity depending on demographics, the degree of urbanization and political\n4 See Brodeur et\u00a0al.

In general, however, countries with more stringent policies at the onset of the epidemic realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower duration during the first epidemic wave. We distinguish not only between mandatory and voluntary social distancing, but also consider the incentives to comply and herd immunity in lowering the reproduction number, as well as vaccine uptake and mutations. To our knowledge, no study which considers voluntary or government-mandated social distancing also controls for the possibility of herd immunity and distinguishes its impacts on effective reproduction numbers from the influence of policy and/or behavioral factors.\nA number of studies consider the effects of different intervention strategies\u2014 such as isolating the elderly, closing schools and/or workplaces, and alternating work/school schedules\u2014which should lower the average number of contacts of specific age groups, contact locations, or time windows relative to normal (pre-COVID) patterns using calibrated behavioral SIR or compartmental models.5 We take an empirical/econometrics approach calibrating only the recovery rate, ; a parameter on which we have much more precise clinical information.\nVarious methods are available in the epidemiological literature to estimate the reproduction numbers at the beginning and/or in real time during epidemics. Estimation of reproduction numbers based on different models is reviewed by Chowell and Nishiura (2008), Obadia et\u00a0al. (2012), and Nikbakht et\u00a0al. (2019). More recent contributions, focusing on estimation of reproduction numbers for the COVID-19 pandemic based on death statistics includes Atkeson et\u00a0 al. (2020b), Baqaee et\u00a0 al. (2020), Korolev (2020) and Toda (2020). As we noted earlier both death and case statistics are problematic, and we provide complementary evidence relying only on case statistics correcting for measurement errors and under-reporting. Other closely related papers are Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde and Jones (2020), Atkeson et\u00a0al. (2020a) , and Cakmakli and Simsek (2020).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section\u00a0 2 discusses SIR model with time-varying transmission rates. Section\u00a03 presents the method and estimation results for the transmission rates and reproduction numbers for selected European countries. Section\u00a04 sets up the panel data model to assess the relative importance of the key factors driving the effective transmission rate over time and across countries and reports the estimation results. Section\u00a05 concludes. \u201cAppendix\u201d presents an extension of PY model to allow for time variations in key parameters affecting the transmission of the virus.\n5 See for example Acemoglu et\u00a0 al.

            "text": "There are many approaches to modeling the spread of epidemics. The basic mathematical model widely used by researchers is the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model advanced by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). This model and its various extensions have been the subject of a vast number of studies and have been applied extensively to investigate the spread of COVID-19.6\nThe basic SIR model considers a given population of fixed size n, composed of three distinct groups, those individuals in period t who have not yet contracted the disease and are therefore susceptible, denoted by St ; the \u2018removed\u2019 individuals who can no longer contract the disease, consisting of recovered and deceased, denoted by Rt ; and those who remain infected at time t and denoted by It . Thus,\nAs it stands, this is an accounting identity, and it is therefore sufficient to model two of the three variables ( St , It , and Rt ) to obtain the third as the remainder.\nThe classic SIR model is deterministic. It is cast in the following set of difference equations (for t = 1, 2,\u2026 , T)\nThe parameter is the rate of transmission, while is the recovery rate. The evolution of the epidemic crucially depends on these two key parameters. It is easy to see from Eqs. (2)\u2013(4) that, without any mitigating intervention, the epidemic will spread if \ud835\udefd\u2215\ud835\udefe = R0 > 1 and will stops spreading only once (R0 \u2212 1)\u2215R0 proportion of the population are infected. The parameter R0 is known as the basic reproduction number, defined as \u201cthe average number of secondary cases produced by one infected individual during the infected individual\u2019s entire infectious period assuming a fully susceptible population\u201d (Del Valle et\u00a0al. 2013). The ratio (R0 \u2212 1)\u2215R0 is also known as the herd immunity threshold.\nIn the case of COVID-19, a number of different estimates have been suggested in the literature, initially placing R0 somewhere in the range of 2.4 to 3.9, with even larger numbers for more recent variants of concern such as Delta and Omicorn.7\n(1)n = St + It + Rt.\n(2)St+1 \u2212 St = \u2212 St It,\n(3)It+1 \u2212 It = St It \u2212 It,\n(4)Rt+1 \u2212 Rt = It.\n7 For example, using data from Wuhan, Wang et\u00a0al. (2020) report a pre-intervention reproductive rate of 3.86; Kucharski et\u00a0al. (2020) estimate that, in China, the reproductive rate was 2.35 one week before travel restrictions were imposed on Jan 23, 2020. Ferguson et\u00a0al. (2020) made the baseline assumption of R 0 = 2.4 and also examined values of 2.0 and 2.6 based on fitting the early growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan by Li et\u00a0al. (2020) and Riou and Althaus (2020).\n6 A comprehensive treatment is provided by Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) with further contributions by Metz (1978), Satsuma et\u00a0al. (2004), Harko et\u00a0al. (2014) , Salje et\u00a0al. (2016), among many others.\nSo, the classical SIR model predicts that in the absence of intervention as much as 2/3-3/4 of the population could eventually become infected before herd immunity is reached. Inevitably, the estimation of R0 is model-dependent and different epidemiological models will imply different estimates of R0 . Our panel estimates reported below suggest R0 is in excess of 5 in Europe, requiring as much as 4/5 of the population to achieve immunity before COVID-19 stops from spreading.\nThis well-understood possibility triggered unparalleled mitigation and containment interventions, first by China and South Korea, then Europe, the USA and all other countries around the world. Such interventions, which broadly speaking we refer to as \u201cmandated social distancing\u201d include case isolation, mask mandates, banning of gatherings, closures of schools and universities, and even local and national lock-downs; all aimed at slowing down the transmission rate of the virus. It is clear that these policies, together with voluntary changes in behavior in response to the epidemic, make it harder for the virus to transmit between individuals.\nThe standard SIR model (2)\u2013(4) takes the transmission rate as given. In this paper, to isolate and estimate the effects of different factors on the spread of the virus we treat the transmission rate as time-varying, i.e., t , and relate its evolution to changes in voluntary and mandatory social distancing, the provision of economic incentives to isolate, as well as to vaccination uptake and the emergence of new variants. However, given the clinical evidence discussed below, we assume the recovery rate to be fixed over time. We will refer to t\u2215 as the \u201ceffective transmission rate.\u201d\nSpecifically, we adopt and extend the agent-based stochastic network model proposed by Pesaran and Yang (2021), henceforth PY where infection of individual i from a population of n susceptible individuals is modeled using an unobserved variable x\u2217\ni,t+1 , as I ( x\u2217 i,t+1 > 0 ) , where I(A) is the indicator function that takes the value\nof unity if A holds and zero otherwise. The latent variable, x\u2217 i,t+1 , is modeled as\nwhere the \ufffd\u2211n\nj=1 dij(t)zjt\n\ufffd component captures the contact pattern of individual i with\nactively infected (contagious) individuals, denoted by the 0/1 variable zjt , using the stochastic contact matrix, (t) = ( dij(t) ) and dij(t) = 1 with probability kit\u2215n , and 0, otherwise, and kit is the average number of contacts of individual i in day t. The \ud835\udf0fit > 0 term captures the degree (or intensity) of the exposure of individual i in day t to the virus upon contacts. For example, two individuals with the same contact patterns have different infection probability in day t + 1 , if they follow different types of precautions as to their mask wearing and hygiene habits. Finally, the term \ud835\udf07it\ud835\udf09i,t+1 > 0 represents individual i th immunity to becoming infected, which could depend on whether the individual is vaccinated. Two individuals with the same contact patters and mask wearing habits could have different infection probabilities due to having different levels of immunity, either natural or vaccine induced. Overall, the latent variable x\u2217\ni,t+1 captures the contact pattern of individuals, allows for vary-\ning exposure intensities and allows for individual heterogeneity in natural or vaccine-induced immunity.\n(5)x\u2217i,t+1 = it\n( n\u2211\nj=1\ndij(t)zjt ) \u2212 it i,t+1,\nSocial distancing, be it mandated and/or voluntary, mask wearing, frequent hand washing, and other mitigating policies will decrease the transmission rate by decreasing the mean contacts per day, kt , and/or reducing the mean exposure intensity parameter, t , in (6). Vaccinations, on the other hand, are expected to decrease transmission rate, by increasing individual-specific resistance to the virus, which manifests in an increase in t . Virus mutations can increase the transmission rate by affecting both t and t.\nUsing an aggregated version of the above model, t can be approximated by8\nwhere kt is the average number of contacts during day t, t is the average exposure intensity of the susceptible population to the virus, and t \u2265 1 is the mean immunity level in the population of susceptible individuals. We exploit time series and cross section variations in factors that influence kt , t and t , across countries and over time. We also relate t to the average effective reproduction number, Ret , defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by one infected individual in a population that includes both susceptible and non-susceptible individuals at time t. Ret depends on the effective transmission rate ( t\u2215 ), and the share of susceptible population ( st = St\u2215n = 1 \u2212 ct ), and is given by\nwhere ct = 1 \u2212 st is the fraction of population that has been infected (cumulation of new infected cases) and 1 \u2212 ct is the herd-immunity component of Ret . It is also worth bearing in mind that at the outset of epidemic outbreak, assuming a fully susceptible population, we have s0 = 1 ( c0 = 0),\u00a0 which in turn ensures that Re0 = 0\u2215 = R0.\nIn our empirical analysis, we will first provide country-specific estimates of the effective transmission rate, t\u2215 . We then model their evolution for a selected number of European countries with similar initial epidemic trajectories. By focusing on the t\u2215 component of Ret , we avoid changes in Ret that arise endogenously due to the rising number of total infections, ct."

While some countries might have good death statistics, using COVID-19 death data pose challenges similar to those raised by cases. The use of death data also has the added disadvantage of being a lagging indicator and could differ across countries due to factors such as age composition, obesity, and the quality of care system. 11 See, for example, the medical evidence documented in Ferguson et\u00a0al.

We plot the scaled transmission rate t\u2215 in place of t to make it easily comparable with the R numbers on the same scale. The virus outbreak in continental Europe began with Italy in early 2020, with the recorded number of infections accelerating rapidly from February 21, 2020 onward. Infections start to rise rapidly in Spain, Germany and France one week later.\nThe rolling estimates show that the R number fell below one in mid- to late-April 2020 in all these countries. As lock-downs were eased during the summer of 2020, however, the R numbers started to rise again. Importantly, by the end of the 2020, the R numbers were much more dispersed, with some countries doing better than others. All large European countries show a second wave much larger than the first one. The UK, Spain, Portugal and Netherlands exhibit distinct third waves, with larger case counts compared with their second waves. The distinction between the (scaled) transmission rate and the reproduction numbers in Fig.\u00a03 permits assessing the influence of herding, which become more salient toward the end of the sample period.15\nIn summary, the reported estimates show that European countries display very similar patterns during the first wave, but diverged significantly toward the end of 2020 both in terms of level of effective reproduction numbers, epidemic peaks, and the importance of herd immunity in slowing down the spread of the virus.

We consider five likely drivers. The first three are mandatory and voluntary social distancing and policy support that\nFootnote 14 (continued) ence. In the online Supplement, we show that estimates of R numbers are not sensitive to the choice of MF, but estimates of transmission rate in the later time period of the sample in countries where substantial fraction of population has recovered, is sensitive to the choice of MF. 15 Since ct is very small at the early stages of the epidemic then Ret and ( t\u2215 ) will be very close. The two measures begin to differ at later stages of the epidemic where ct becomes sizeable. Recall that Ret = ( t\u2215 )(1 \u2212 ct).\naffects compliance with mandatory distancing policies. These drivers are likely to be of importance throughout the pandemic. They are also consistent with a simple decision-theoretic model of voluntary social distancing presented in \u201cAppendix\u201d, as well as the large literature on behavioral epidemic modeling. In the latter stage of the pandemic in 2021, two additional factors are important, which we also consider: progress on vaccinations and virus mutations.\nMandatory social distancing directly reduces the number of contacts as well as the exposure intensity, the structural parameters of our SIR model. A strong rationale for imposition of mandated social distancing is the presence of externalities, i.e., the fact that agents do not internalize in their cost\u2013benefit analysis that their individual behavior contributes to the aggregate diffusion of the epidemic.16\nHowever, mandated social distancing imposes economic costs and infringes on individual liberty leading to personal inconveniences (Hamermesh 2020). Economic support to workers, households and small businesses during the pandemic can shape incentives of individuals to comply with mandatory social distancing, as it weakens the economic need to interact in work activities. Consider an individual who has a non-teleworkable job and is fired or furloughed. While this leads to an immediate loss of income, if economic support is adequate, individuals can weather the pandemic without needing to seek paid employment in exposed occupations. Lack of compliance with social distancing has been documented empirically by Wright et\u00a0al. (2020). Based on survey evidence, Papageorge et\u00a0al. (2021) find that higher income\n16 See, for example, Bethune and Korinek (2020), Eichenbaum et\u00a0 al. (2020), and Beck and Wagner (2020) in the international context. Eichenbaum et\u00a0 al. (2020), in particular, propose a behavioral SIRmacro model in which susceptible workers and consumers react to the epidemic risk by reducing their labor supply and consumption. Infected individuals take the aggregate infection process as given. As a result mandatory social distancing is optimal even though it is extremely costly in economic terms.\nis associated with larger changes in self-protective behavior, particularly for individuals who cannot telework. They conclude that, both in the USA and elsewhere, policies that mandate universal compliance with self-protective measures are unlikely to be effective or sustainable.\nIt is also well understood that infection risk induces precautionary behavior. Behavioral models of COVID-19 diffusion show that as the probability of getting infected rises, individuals lower consumption and leisure activities to avoid infection (see Eichenbaum et\u00a0al. 2020; Toxvaerd 2020; Atkeson 2021, and Gupta et\u00a0al. 2020). In particular, Battiston and Gamba (2020) provide cross section evidence that the R number during a COVID-19 outbreak is lower the larger the size of the initial wave.\nTo capture voluntary as well as mandatory social distancing policies empirically, in our statistical analyses we make use of data compiled by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) project, which is a standard source of comparable indices measuring social distancing and other COVID-19-related policies across countries.17 In particular, we use two aggregate indices: the \u2018policy stringency index\u2019 (capturing the containment and lock-down policies) and the \u2018economic support index\u2019 (as a proxy variable for support to comply with the containment policies).\nWe also considered using Google mobility index as an additional regressor but obtained mixed results, largely due to the fact that mobility and lock downs are strongly correlated, but this is not the case for other forms of mitigation measures such as keeping one\u2019s distance, meeting in open spaces, using sanitization, and wearing of face masks. In fact, we find the coefficient of the mobility index is negative once we also allow for other drivers of the transmission rates, suggesting reduced mobility could be associated with a higher rate of transmission! This perverse result is most likely due to the positive relationship that exists with mobility and mitigation measures and vaccination uptakes. It is reasonable to expect that vaccinated individuals and those that are taking precautionary mitigating measures are more likely to increase their mobility without the fear of contracting the virus. For further details, see Section S.7 of the online supplement.\nWe model precautionary behavior leading to voluntary social distancing using a threshold variable that switches on when the number of infected cases start to rise very rapidly. The idea for a threshold effect, defined in terms of the number of new cases, is to capture possible nonlinearity and changes in people\u2019s willingness to isolate consistent with surveys on the role of information diffusion under COVID-19 (Bursztyn et\u00a0al. 2020)."

Alternative specifications for the threshold effects are discussed in Sect.\u00a04.3 below.\nAs a threshold variable, we use the 7-day moving average of the reported number of new cases (per 100,000 people), denoted by fjt , as this is the most commonly watched variable used in the media when reporting on the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.18 In addition to estimating the panel regressions with a common constant term, a , we also allow for country-specific constant terms by replacing a in (14) with aj , for j = 1, 2,\u2026 ,N . The parameters aj are of particular interest as they can be viewed as an estimate of the basic reproduction number, R0 , which relates to the spread of the virus right at the start of the epidemic when j,t\u2212p = 0 , and I(fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0ff ) = 0 . Note at the start of the epidemic ct is very close to zero, and voluntary and mandatory social distancing are not yet in place. Therefore, the constant terms a, or aj can be interpreted as measures of R0 which we expect to be the same across all countries. We acknowledge that R0 is the only structural parameter that we can estimate in (14) and that the remaining parameters in (14) cannot be interpreted as causal without further assumptions regarding the nature of regressors.\nSubstituting (14) in (13), we obtain the following panel data model in the unknown parameters, ai for i = 1, 2, ..,N , and (recall that = 1\u221514)\nwhere the error term uj,t+1 = vjt \u2212 ( ijt )\u22121 et+1 is now composed of the countryspecific errors in specification of jt (namely vjt ) and the approximating error, et+1 , which is common across countries, thus inducing possible error cross-sectional dependence. For estimation, we estimate the panel regressions with common intercepts as well as allowing for fixed effects.\n(13)ln [ (1 \u2212 cj,t+1)\u2215(1 \u2212 cjt) ] = \u2212 jtijt + ej,t+1,\n(14)\ud835\udefdjt\u2215\ud835\udefe = \ud835\udefcj + \ufffd j,t\u2212p + \ud835\udf05I(fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0ff ) + vjt,\n(15)\nyj,t+1 = \u2212 ln [ (1 \u2212 cj,t+1)\u2215(1 \u2212 cjt) ]\n\ud835\udefeijt = aj +\n\ufffd j,t\u2212p + \ud835\udf05I(fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0ff ) + uj,t+1,\n18 It is possible that the threshold effects could depend on other variables, besides the reported number of new cases explored in this paper.\nOur sample contains a small number of countries ( N = 9 ) relative to the much larger time dimension (with the time series dimension varying between T = 321 and 646). An advantage of our small-N and large-T panel is that the specification in Eq. (15) can be estimated by least squares assuming only that the regressors are weakly exogenous.19\nThe parameters of interest are the country-specific intercepts, 1, 2,\u2026 , N , that measure the basic reproduction number, R0 , and the coefficients , and f that measure the relative importance of the five factors considered in the empirical analysis as we discussed above. We estimate the parameters of interest jointly using (15). This is to be contrasted with a two-step procedure whereby jt is first estimated by running country-specific regressions in (13), and the resultant estimates, \ud835\udefdjt,\u00a0are then used in a second stage panel regression where \ud835\udefdjt are regressed on our five drivers of transmission rates. The joint estimation approach is likely to provide more robust inference as compared to a two-step method that does not allow for the estimation uncertainty associated with using \ud835\udefdjt .\nWe report standard errors of the estimated parameters under three scenarios. As a baseline and for comparison, we compute the standard errors assuming that uj,t+1 is cross-sectionally as well as serially uncorrelated. These assumptions are undoubtedly restrictive, and therefore we also consider more robust alternatives. Our second approach to computing the standard errors, labeled as \u201crobust1\u201d in the tables below, allows for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. Our third choice, denoted as \u201crobust2\u201d in the tables below, and allows uj,t+1 to be correlated both over time as well as across countries (i.e., over both the t and j dimensions). Corrections for time series follow the standard Newey and West (1987) formulae, while corrections for cross-country correlations is similar to the standard errors proposed by Driscoll and Kraay (1998). Estimation with the robust standard errors is described in the online supplement.\nAn additional concern with our specification could be omitted variables and the presence of other confounding factors. The proposed specification (15) is parsimonious and encompasses the main factors considered in the literature. As contacts and susceptibility are not separately identified in our (or any other) SIR model, we use policy stringency and economic support indices, and we do not attempt to disentangle the effects of reducing/increasing the number of contacts from other measures that affect the number of infected cases, such as mask wearing, hand washing and individual\u2019s inherent susceptibility to becoming infected. For example, increased mobility and hence contacts on its own does not imply a higher rate of infections if individuals are more diligent in following other mitigating measures.\nWe focus on the nine European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. As we noted already, the reason for focusing on these nine countries is the fact that they experienced a similar\n19 Typically, least squares estimates in panels with weakly exogenous regressors will suffer from O(1/T) bias.

This is in contrast to short panels (T-small and N-large), where strict exogeneity is required for consistency of least squares method.\ntrajectory at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, but had quite differing outcomes subsequently. In this way, we are able to exploit the cross country, as well as time series variations in the number of infected cases to quantify the effects of social distancing, vaccine uptake, and mutations on the effective transmission rates, jt\u2215 . Recall here that jt\u2215 differs from the effective reproduction number, Rj,et , given by Rj,et = (1 \u2212 cjt) ( jt\u2215 ) . As we noted earlier, Rj,et can fall below unity not because of the effectiveness of the mitigating policies or voluntary isolation, but simply because an increasingly larger fraction of the population is getting infected, the socalled herd-immunity effect. To avoid the confounding effect of herding on the outcome variable that we want to explain, we focus on modeling of jt\u2215 and not Rj,et."

We allow for differences in the start dates of the outbreaks across the countries. We initially choose the sample end date of January 31, 2021, prior to the uptake of vaccination programs.20 We consequently refer to this period as the pre-vaccination sample. Table\u00a01 reports panel estimation results for two alternative specifications of multiplication factors used to correct for under-reporting\u2014MF declining linearly from 5 to 2, and from 8 to 2.5\u2014and the lag order p = 10 days.21\nAs we can see from Table\u00a01, both the policy stringency index and the policy support index have the expected negative signs and are both highly statistically significant. This result confirms that both factors help contain the epidemic diffusion. Their estimated coefficients are robust to alternative MF corrections. The threshold effects also are highly statistically significant. Allowing for country-specific intercepts slightly increases the coefficients on the policy stringency and the economic support indices, and slightly lowers the estimates of the threshold effect, which, however, all estimates remain sizeable and highly significant. Allowing for error correlations (over time and across countries) increases the estimated standard errors, as to be expected, but do not alter the overall inference that all variables considered remain statistically significant.\nRegarding the magnitude of the estimated coefficients, it is first useful to note that the intercept is the model-implied estimate of the R0 number, which is the only structural parameter that we can estimate. As discussed before, the definition of the basic reproduction number assumes no changes in behavior in response to the pandemic. The estimated value of the common intercept, , in Table\u00a01, is 5.36, identical\n20 Although vaccines became available in December 2020, only a very small fraction of the population was fully vaccinated by the end January 2021\u2014less than 0.8 percent for all countries in the sample, except Italy, where the share reached 1.07 percent. Vaccine uptake increased considerably by late spring and summer of 2021. 21 To further check the robustness of our results, we also considered a shorter lag of p = 7 days and a longer lag p = 14 days and found similar results. We also tried other values of MF discussed in Footnote\u00a014.\nfor both choices of MF, with a tight robust2 standard error (0.23). The country-specific estimates of R0 are also all in a surprisingly tight range of 5.01 to 5.73.\nThe estimated threshold value is rather small, below 1 daily new confirmed case per 100,000 people, representing about 4-percent quantile of the daily new cases per 100,000 people in the pre-vaccination sample. This result suggests that the threshold effect kicks in very soon after the onset of the pandemic. In other words, people\u2019s behavior changes soon after the onset of the pandemic, which makes the estimation of the R0 number from case numbers without a conditional statistical models difficult (if not impossible). Threshold effects alone significantly reduce the effective reproduction number (by more than 2), but on its own is not enough to bring the effective R number below one. Both economic support and stringency indices further reduce the transmission significantly, with the stringency index being associated with a much larger contribution to the decline in R.\nNext, we extend the sample to November 30, 2021, prior to the arrival of Omicron variant in December of 2021. Throughout 2021, there was a significant progress with vaccine uptake, which is expected to mitigate the virus transmission. We therefore include an additional variable measuring the share of population fully vaccinated. We expect the coefficient on this variable to be negative. Another factor in 2021 is the Delta mutation, which is considered to be more contagious and became dominant in Europe during the summer of 2021. Therefore, we also include a variable measuring the country-specific share of the Delta variant among the sequenced confirmed cases. A positive coefficient is expected on this additional control variable.\nTable\u00a02 presents estimates for the sample ending November 30, 2021. The table shows very similar findings for the estimates of the policy stringency index, the economic support index, the threshold effect, as well as the R0 numbers, as reported in Table\u00a01 for the pre-vaccination sample. The coefficients on the share of population fully vaccinated are all negative (as expected), with magnitude in the range -1.2 to -1.8 and highly statistically significant. Coefficient estimates on the Delta variant share are all positive, in line with our prior, suggesting the basic reproduction number of the Delta variant is about 0.9 to 1.1 larger compared with the earlier strains.\nTable\u00a03 provides summary statistics for all covariates used in the regressions. It reports the sample means and standard deviations (in brackets) for the pre-vaccination sub-sample ending January 31, 2021, and for the remainder of the sample (February 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021).22 Multiplying the average values of the regressors in Table\u00a03 with the estimated coefficients in Table\u00a02 (using the specification with common intercept and MF declining from 5 to 2), we find the threshold effect to be quantitatively important and when it is switched on reduces t\u2215 by about a half.23 The second largest reduction comes from the stringency policy index (with a \u2212 1.2 average contribution to the reduction of t\u2215 ). In contrast, the contribution from the economic support index is smaller, only by \u22120.2 on average.\n22 Table\u00a0S2 in the online supplement reports minimum and maximum ranges. 23 Recall the effective reproduction number is Rj,et = (1 \u2212 cjt) ( jt\u2215 ) , where (1 \u2212 cjt) is the share of susceptible population, and we refer to jt\u2215 as the scaled effective transmission rate, which is in the same \u201cunits\u201d as the reproduction number, since Rj,et \u2248 jt\u2215 when (1 \u2212 cjt) \u2248 0.\nNumber of observations is 2989 with N = 9 countries, T min = 321 and T max = 343 days.

Thus also explaining the different country experiences we documented in the previous section.

            "text": "Given the importance of the threshold variable for the evolution of the transmission rate of the virus, it seemed of interest to consider other forms of the threshold variable to further investigate its effects.24 Accordingly, we here consider one specification with two threshold indicators, and another with smooth threshold parametric specification.\nTable\u00a04 reports estimation results for panel regressions featuring two thresholds indicators. Namely, we replace the single threshold variable in (15) with the linear combination of the two threshold indicators, \ud835\udf051I(fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0f1,f ) + \ud835\udf052I(fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0f2,f ) . To conserve space, we focus on the full sample results only. The findings in Table\u00a04 continue to show strong support for threshold effects. In the baseline specifications, with the MF declining from 5 to 2, one of the two threshold values ( 2,f = 0.2 ) is identical to the single threshold specification, and the other one is even smaller ( 1,f = 0.05 ). Both threshold indicators are statistically significant. When we use the larger values of MF (8 to 2.5), only one of the two threshold variables is statistically significant with the estimated threshold, 0.20, being the same as before.25 Overall, estimated coefficients and estimated R0 numbers are similar to those reported in Table\u00a02. These results suggest that threshold effects are occurring at relatively low levels, but nonlinear effects are possibly more nuanced than a single 0/1 threshold representation.\nFor the smooth threshold specification, we adopt the popular parametric representation from the literature on smooth transition regression models (e.g., Ter\u00e4svirta 1998) and adapt it to our empirical application to ensure zero values when fj,t\u2212p = 0 , regardless of the shape parameters. Specifically, we consider\n(16)h ( fj,t\u2212p, f , f ) =\n[ 1\n1 + e\u2212 f (fj,t\u2212p\u2212 f ) \u2212 h0\n( f , f )] \u2215 [ 1 \u2212 h0h0 ( f , f )] ,\n24 We are grateful to the editor for the suggestion. 25 It took about 30 days, on average, for the sample countries to reach 7-day moving average of 0.2 new confirmed cases per 100k people since the occurrence of the first confirmed COVID-19 case, with the longest time in Germany (42 days) and the shortest time in Netherlands (11 days).\nwhere \ud835\udefff , \ud835\udf0ff > 0 , and\nThis specification replaces the fixed threshold function I ( fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0ff ) in (15) with the more flexible smooth transition function (16). We refer to the parameter f in (16) as the smooth threshold and refer to f as the shape parameter.26 For sufficiently large values of the shape parameter f , h ( fj,t\u2212p, f , f ) resembles I ( fj,t\u2212p > \ud835\udf0ff ) , whereas for small values of f the transition process becomes smoother and more gradual. Table\u00a0 5 summarizes results for the smooth threshold specification. The results complement earlier estimates in Tables\u00a02 and 4 and confirm that threshold effects kick in at very low levels new infections. The estimates of f lie in the range 0.08 to 0.10, and the estimated threshold shape parameter f is quite large, in the range 16 to 20. Smooth threshold functions for these parameter values are plotted in Fig.\u00a04, alongside the fixed threshold function from Table\u00a02. Allowing for a smooth threshold transition function suggests that the threshold effects are slightly more gradual compared with the fixed 0/1 transition, but they start to kick in at even lower values."

            "text": "This paper first estimates effective transmission rates and reproduction numbers for a number of countries based on a moment condition that can be derived from an agent-based stochastic network epidemic model. It then models their evolution for selected European countries with similar experiences at the outset of the pandemic but different outcomes subsequently as a function of social distancing, incentives to comply, the emergence of mutations, and vaccine uptake.\nFrom a methodological perspective, the estimation approach that we propose permits distinguishing, at any jurisdictional level, between changes in the effective reproduction number due to herd immunity and changes due to variations in the average contact or the susceptibility to infection, which are the structural determinants of the epidemic diffusion. At the empirical level, using only daily COVID-19 case statistics, the paper provides estimates of transmission rates, allowing for the under-reporting of infected cases in officially reported COVID case statistics.\nEvidence based on panel data modeling indicates that the diversity of outcomes that we document likely resulted from the nonlinear interaction of mandated and voluntary social distancing and the economic incentives that governments provided to support isolation through the end of 2020. The importance of these factors declined over time, with vaccine uptake driving the observed heterogeneity in country experiences during 2021. Our estimates suggest that no one factor alone was sufficient to bring the effective R number below one and to keep it there without substantial contributions from the other factors. Our panel regressions also allow\nh0 ( f , f ) =\n1\n1 + e f f .\n26 Note that h(x, , ) \u2208 [0, 1] with h(0, , ) = 0 , and h(x, , ) \u2192 1 as x \u2192 \u221e.\nus to identify the basic reproduction number, R0 , providing estimates that are very similar across the nine European countries, and all well in excess of the values of 2.4 to 3.9 assumed in the extant literature.

Some are initially infected while the rest are susceptible to be infected at a later date, indexed by t. An individual i infected at date t = t\u2217\ni is represented by\nThe event of recovery or death of the individual i will be represented by the variable yit , which is equal to zero unless the individual is \u201cremoved,\u201d i.e., recovered or dead. The indicator variable\nthen denotes \u201can active\u201d infection, namely if the individual i is infected and not yet recovered. Specifically, zit takes the value of 1 if individual i is infected and not yet recovered at time t. It takes the value of 0 if individual i has not yet been infected, or has been infected but recovered/died. It follows that xit = zit + yit.\nIndividual i becoming infected is modeled using the following Markov switching process as a function of the latent variable x\u2217\ni,t+1 ,\nwhere I(A) is the indicator function that takes the value of unity if A holds and zero otherwise, and x\u2217\ni,t+1 is given by:\nSince I ( x\u2217 i,t+1 > 0 ) is unaffected by re-scaling of x\u2217 i,t+1 , and by assumption \ud835\udf07it > 0 , then the above expression can also be written equivalently as\nThe component \u2211n\nj=1\n\ufffd dij(t)\nkt\n\ufffd zjt captures the contact pattern of individual i with all\nactively infected individuals, zjt for j \u2260 i .

It is assumed that the elements of the n \u00d7 n network matrix (t) are independent draws with E [ dij(t)\u2215kt ] = pt\u2215kt = 1\u2215n , where kt is the mean daily contact number during day t. The term it is an individual-specific measure of exposure intensity, scaled by it which in turn measures the individual\u2019s immunity, either inherent or induced by vaccination.\nThe i,t+1 term in (A.4) is an unobserved individual-specific strictly positive random variable, which captures the unobservable characteristics that leads to different probabilities of infection, even for individuals with the same contact patterns\n(A.1)xit = 0, for all t < t\u2217i ; and xit = 1, for all t \u2265 t \u2217 i .\n(A.2)zit = ( 1 \u2212 yit ) xit\n(A.3)xi,t+1 = xit + ( 1 \u2212 xit ) I ( x\u2217 i,t+1 > 0 ) ,\nx\u2217 i,t+1 = it\nn\u2211\nj=1\ndij(t)zjt \u2212 it i,t+1.\n(A.4) x\u2217 i,t+1\nit =\n( itkt\nit\n) n\u2211\nj=1\n( dij(t)\nkt\n) zjt \u2212 i,t+1.\nand exposures. Following PY, we assume i,t+1 is exponentially and independently distributed over i and t with the cumulative distribution function given by\nwhere E ( i,t+1 ) = 1.\nSince individual i becomes infected if x\u2217 i,t+1 > 0 , what matters most for the spread of the virus is the ratio kt it\u2215 it in Eq. (A.4) which captures both social distancing (voluntary or mandatory) and vaccination. Note also that, at a theoretical level, it is not possible to distinguish between reducing interactions via kt , or reducing the intensity of these exposures via it , or via vaccination that increases it . So these three factors are not separately identified.\nThe recovery or death from COVID-19\u2014the exit from the infection state that we label removal\u2014depends on the number of days since infection. Specifically, the removal process for individual i is given by\nwhere i,t+1 ( t\u2217 i ) = 1 if individual i recovers at time t + 1 , having been infected exactly at time t\u2217 i and not before, and i,t+1 ( t\u2217 i ) = 0, otherwise. Furthermore, it is assumed that the time to removal, denoted by T\u2217 it = t \u2212 t\u2217 i , follows the geometric distribution (for t \u2212 t\u2217 i = 1, 2,\u2026)\nwhere can be interpreted as the probability of recovering or dying at time t + 1 having remained infected for t \u2212 t\u2217\ni \u2212 1 days. This implies the following removal\nmicro-moment condition\nNoting that a susceptible individual can now be denoted by sit = 1 \u2212 zit \u2212 yit , and using the definitions above we have that the cumulative number of infections is Ct = \u2211n i=1 xit , the total number of removed (recovered or deceased) is Rt = \u2211n i=1 yit ,\nand the total number of active cases is It = \u2211n i=1 zit = Ct \u2212 Rt , while the number of\n\u201csusceptible\u201d individuals is St = \u2211n i=1 sit = n \u2212 It \u2212 Rt.\nAssuming that it = , kt = k and t = are time invariant, PY derive the following approximation for the aggregate moment condition for the population share of the total cumulative confirmed cases, ct = Ct\u2215n (see Eq. (48) of PY)\nwhere\n(A.5)Pr ( \ud835\udf09i,t+1 < a ) = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212a), for a > 0,\n(A.6)yi,t+1 = yit + zit i,t+1 ( t\u2217 i ) ,\n(A.7)Pr [ i,t+1 ( t\u2217 i ) = 1 ] = Pr ( T\u2217 it = t \u2212 t\u2217 i ) = (1 \u2212 )t\u2212t \u2217 i \u22121,\n(A.8)E ( yi,t+1 ||yit, zit ) = yit + zit.\n(A.9)E ( 1 \u2212 ct+1\n1 \u2212 ct |||| it\n) = e\u2212 it + O ( n\u22121 ) ,\n(A.10) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212 )k \u2248 k ,\nand it = It\u2215n is the per capita number of active cases. In our empirical analysis, we allow for time variations in k, and and accordingly obtain the following mean transmission rate\nwhere kt is the average number of contact during day t, t is the average exposure intensity of the susceptible population to the virus, and t \u2265 1 expected to be an increasing function of the proportion of susceptible population vaccinated, thus capturing the effects of vaccination. It is also worth noting that, in the above set up, the basic reproduction number, R0 , is given by\nwith 0 = 1 at the start of the epidemic."

Under self-isolation, an individual that does not telework incurs the loss of wages net of any COVID-19 economic support amounting to (1 \u2212 it)wit , plus the inconvenience cost, ait , of being isolated, where wit is the wage and it is the percentage of income lost which is compensated by the government support. For those individuals who can work from home it is likely to be 1 or very close to it. But for many workers who are furloughed or become unemployed, it is likely to be close to zero, unless they are compensated by transfers from the government.\nOn the other hand, if the individual decides not to self-isolate, then he/she receives the uncertain pay-off of (1 \u2212 xit)wit \u2212 xit it , where xit is an indicator which takes the value of unity if the individual contracts the disease and zero otherwise. The parameter it represents the cost of contracting the disease and is expected to be quite high. We are ruling out the possibility of death as an outcome and also assume that if the individual does not isolate and get sick does not earn the wage.\nIn this setting, the individual decides to self-isolate if the sure loss of self-isolating is less than the expected loss of not self-isolating, namely if\nwhere It\u22121 is the publicly available information that includes ct\u22121, the total number of infections.

Also, an individual is more likely to self-isolate voluntarily if the wage loss, measured by it, is low thus showing that compensating some workers for the loss of their wages encourages a larger fraction of the population to comply with mandatory social distancing. The above formulation could easily accommodate the differential incentive to self-isolate across different age groups and sectors of economic activity. Given that the epidemic affects the young and the old differently, with the old being more at risk as compared to the young, then \ud835\udf19old > \ud835\udf19young , and the old are more likely to self-isolate. Similarly, low-wage earners are more likely to self-isolate as compared to high-wage earners with the same preferences ( it and ait ), and facing the same transfer rates, it . But the reverse outcome could occur if low-wage earner faces a higher rate of transfer as compared to the high-wage earners.\nAccording to this simple model, the fraction of population that are willing to socially isolate voluntarily is given by\nwhere I(A) is an indicator function that takes the value of 1 if A holds and zero otherwise. It is clear that the extent of voluntary social distancing, pn,t , is positively related to the size of the economic support, it , and the perceived net cost of contracting the virus, ( it \u2212 ait ) , which could rise sharply when epidemic surges and/ or if better messaging by health authorities about the true costs of contracting the disease is provided. The inclusion of the economic support variable and the threshold indicator in our empirical analysis are intended to capture such effects, with the indicator taking the value of unity when people become more fearful of catching the virus.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1057/ s41308- 022- 00181-9.\n(2 \u2212 \ud835\udf03it)wit + ait < \ud835\udf0bt\u22121(wit + \ud835\udf19it),\n(A.14) 2 \u2212 \ud835\udf03it +\n( ait\u2215wit )\n1 + ( \ud835\udf19it\u2215wit ) = \ud835\udf06it < \ud835\udf0bt\u22121.\n(A.15)\ud835\udf19it\u2215wit > ait\u2215wit + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf03it).\npn,t = n \u22121\nn\u2211\ni=1\nI [ (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf03it)wit < ( \ud835\udf19it \u2212 ait )] ,"
