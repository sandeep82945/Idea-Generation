1. **Investigating the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins in vivo.** The Bind&Bite method could potentially be used to modify proteins in vivo by fusing the coiled-coil peptides to the protein of interest and then administering the activated peptide-chemical moiety conjugate. This could be a valuable tool for studying protein function and regulation in living systems.
2. **Developing new peptide adapter domains for the Bind&Bite method.** The Bind&Bite method could be made more versatile by developing new peptide adapter domains that recognize different target proteins. This would allow the method to be used to modify a wider range of proteins.
3. **Exploring the use of the Bind&Bite method for the development of new therapeutic agents.** The Bind&Bite method could be used to develop new therapeutic agents by attaching drugs or other therapeutic moieties to proteins. This could improve the efficacy and specificity of drugs by targeting them to specific proteins.
4. **Investigating the use of the Bind&Bite method for the development of new diagnostic tools.** The Bind&Bite method could be used to develop new diagnostic tools by attaching fluorescent or other detectable labels to proteins. This could allow for the detection of proteins in complex samples, such as blood or tissue.
5. **Exploring the use of the Bind&Bite method for the development of new materials.** The Bind&Bite method could be used to create new materials by attaching proteins to other materials, such as polymers or metals. This could lead to the development of new materials with unique properties.
