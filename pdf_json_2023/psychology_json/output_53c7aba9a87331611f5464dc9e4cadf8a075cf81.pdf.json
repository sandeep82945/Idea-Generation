Therefore, ensuring the sensitive detection of sulfamethoxazole is of utmost importance.\nPresently, the detection methods for sulfamethoxazole mainly consist of spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),6,7 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),8 capillary electrophoresis,9,10 and several other techniques. Nevertheless, the application of traditional detection methods in antibiotic detection technology is significantly impeded by the need for costly equipment, intricate sample preparation, and time-intensive detection procedures.11 On the other hand, electrochemical detection techniques have gained significant attention due to their inherent advantages of being fast, straightforward, portable, and cost-effective.12 The careful selection of appropriate electrode modification materials is a critical step in the electrochemical detection process.\nIn the past few years, the field of inorganic nanomaterials has witnessed a remarkable surge in interest, largely attributed to their exceptional physicochemical properties.13 In particular, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) like MoS2, WS2, and VS2 have gained considerable attention ascribed to their distinct morphology and graphene-like properties.14,15 These materials demonstrate excellent chemical, physical, optical, mechanical, magnetic, and electrical characteristics.16 Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals are composed of interconnected layers connected by strong in-plane covalent bonds.17 Meanwhile, the S\u2013M\u2013S interlayer structure, which consists of sulfur molecules (S) and transition metals (M), is held together by comparatively weaker out-of-plane van der Waals forces.18,19 The distinctive structural characteristics of TMD crystals contribute to their extensive range of physicochemical properties, notably a significant specific surface area and impressive conductivity.20 These attributes have facilitated their exceptional performance in various fields, including electrocatalysis, lithium-ion batteries, optoelectronic devices, and energy storage.21 Consequently, TMDs have become a focal point of intense research and development in the past few decades.22 Among different TMDs, vanadium disulfide (VS2) stands out as an exemplary material. Recent advancements in first-principles theoretical calculations and experimental research have demonstrated the remarkable properties of twodimensional layered VS2, which include excellent conductivity, a high aspect ratio, ultrathin edges, and favorable mechanical characteristics.23,24 Consequently, VS2 fulfills the essential criteria for an effective electrochemical sensor. Karthik et al. developed a promising non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor for detecting hydrogen peroxide based on a simple sonochemical synthesis of novel grass-like vanadium disulfide.16 Vilian et al. employed a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize electrodes comprising gold nanoparticles decorating VS2reduced graphene oxide sheets, achieving a calibration dynamic range of 10\u2013340 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.44 nM towards sulfadiazine detection.25 Therefore,\nthe incorporation of two-dimensional VS2 nanocrystals holds great potential in the manufacturing of electrochemical sensors.26 However, to propose a promising VS2-based electrochemical platform, comprehensive studies focusing on the structural regulation and electrochemical optimization of VS2 are still deficient and necessary.\nIn this work, we utilized the PVP-induced shape control of a hydrothermal synthesis method to fabricate layered structured VS2, and employed it for the first time as an electrode modification material to prepare an electrochemical sensor for sensitive SMX detection in natural waters. The features and properties of the synthesized material were studied using various characterization methods. Various electrochemical techniques were further applied for evaluating the detection performance of the electrochemical sensor. In particular, the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis demonstrated that the sensor exhibited high sensitivity and a wide linear range, indicating its substantial potential for environmental water analysis applications."

PVP, as an anionic surfactant, possesses hydroxyl groups at the ends of its molecules and can be adsorbed onto VS2 layers through electrostatic interactions. 21 With the aid of PVP, the stacked layers of VS2 were inclined to be exfoliated through sonication in the dispersion. By increasing the amount of PVP to 3.000 g, stacked VS2 nanosheets were further exfoliated into fewer layers, as shown in Fig. 2d. The purity of the prepared VS2 samples was confirmed by TEM elemental mapping and elemental composition, as presented in Fig. S1 and Table S1.\u2020\nTo determine the optimal structure of VS2 induced by PVP, the DPV curvesof VS2 \u2013 A, VS2 \u2013 B and VS2 \u2013 C electrodes were constructed for 10 \u03bcM SMX, as shown in Fig. 2e. The results demonstrated that the VS2 \u2013 B electrodes exhibited the best electrochemical response toward SMX, which was chosen as the optimized VS2 nanosheet for the following experiments. Compared to the stacked layers of VS2 \u2013 A, the VS2 \u2013 B layers tended to be exfoliated by the induced regulation of PVP. A higher specific surface area of VS2 \u2013 B electrodes enhanced the adsorption capability of SMX, presentinga better electrochemical response.28 When regulated with excess PVP, the VS2 \u2013 C electrodes showed a dispersed structure with fewer layers, decreasing its adsorption capability towards SMX. Thus, VS2 \u2013 B indicates the priority towards SMX detection.\nCharacterization of layer-by-layer stacked VS2 nanosheets\nThe SEM images in Fig. 2f and g depict the morphology of VS2. VS2 was composed of vertically stacked nanosheets, exhibiting a diameter and thickness of up to 500\u20131000 nm and 20\u201330 nm approximately. Elemental analysis using an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) confirmed the presence and uniform distribution of V and S elements, as shown in Fig. 2h and i. TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images revealed the crystal structure of VS2, as presented in Fig. 2j and k. TEM images revealed that the VS2 nanosheets were stacked in the [001] direction, with an interlayer spacing of approximately 5.79 \u00c5.21 This value closely matches the normal interplanar spacing (5.76 \u00c5) of the original VS2 (001) plane.\n29 Electron diffraction was employed to demonstrate the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized sample, as indicated in Fig. 2l.\nFig. 3a presents the crystal structure (the unit cell and molecules) of VS2, referenced from the PDF card number 89-1640. From the observation in Fig. 3a, each layer of vanadium disulfide consists of a vanadium layer sandwiched between two sulfur layers, and the sandwiched structures are connected by van der Waals forces.18\nFrom the XRD patterns (Fig. 3b), all the observed diffraction peaks in the graph can be assigned to VS2 (JCPDS#89-1640), with lattice constants of a = b = 3.22 \u00c5 and c = 5.76 \u00c5. These findings provide further confirmation of the successful formation of VS2 nanosheets with regular interlayer spacing. The chemical structure of the synthesized VS2 was investigated using Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3c. It displayed characteristic vibration bands at nearly 281 and 405 cm\u22121,\ncorresponding to E1g and A1g modes, respectively. 30 These modes represent the in-plane vibration (E1g) and out-of-plane vibration (A1g) of the S\u2013V\u2013S bonds,\n31 as depicted in Fig. 3d. In fact, the Raman signals of VS2 demonstrate an analogy to other transition metal sulfides within the vanadium group.32,33\nIn Fig. 3e, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of V 2p unveiled two prominent peaks centered at approximately 525.0 and 517.5 eV. These peaks are assigned to V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2, respectively, affirming the existence of the V4+ oxidation state.34 Additionally, the XPS spectrum also exhibits two smaller peaks located at approximately 522.2 and 514.2 eV. These minor peaks suggested the presence of a small quantity of V2+ ions, which can be attributed to the reducing properties of organic amines and the strong reducing nature of hydrogen sulfide generated from the decomposition of thioacetamide in the preparation.35 The XPS spectrum of S 2p shown in Fig. 3f showed distinct peaks at around 162.7 and 161.5 eV, corresponding to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 of S2\u2212 species.36 Peaks located at around 163.7 and 164.5 eV are attributed to the S0 species, while the peak at around 169.6 eV can be assigned to the sulfate species.37 These results indicated that slight oxidation and contamination with elemental sulfur and sulfates occurred in the VS2 sample due to its exposure to air.\nAnalyst This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The oxidation peak with potential 0.90 V was designated as the characteristic peak for SMX electrochemical analysis. To assess the interfacial charge transfer ability, EIS was performed on GCE and VS2 electrodes in 10 mM [Fe(CN)6]\n3\u2212/4\u2212 (Fig. 4a). Through the model simulation according to its Nyquist curves, the equivalent circuit model of VS2 electrodes is equivalent to Rs(Qdl(Rct(Qc(Rc\u00b7ZW)))). In particular, Rct denotes the interfacial electron transfer resistance and determines the electron transfer ability on various electrodes.38 The Rct values of VS2 electrodes and GCE were 567.2 and 5079.0 \u03a9, respectively. The Rct value of GCE was higher than that for VS2 electrodes, demonstrating that VS2 enhances the charge transfer ability of electrodes. The fitted values of various parameters in the model are presented in Table S2.\u2020\nTo further enhance the detection performance of VS2 electrodes, analytical parameters such as the modified mass of VS2 on the electrode, scan rates, and electrolyte pH were treated in optimization. To determine the appropriate mass of VS2\nduring electrode preparation, the DPV curves of VS2 electrodes modified with various masses of VS2 as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 \u03bcg were constructed for PBS containing 10 \u03bcM SMX. As shown in Fig. 4b, 8 \u03bcg of VS2 was selected for further experiments. To evaluate the electrochemical behaviors on the VS2 electrode surface, CV responses were obtained in 10 mM [Fe(CN)6] 3\u2212/4\u2212 at scan rates ranging from 20 to 200 m Vs\u22121 (Fig. 4c). The peak current density of Iox and Ire presented a linear increment with the square root of scan rate v1/2 (Fig. 4d), indicating that the redox reaction on VS2 electrodes was diffusion-controlled. 39 The influence of electrolyte pH on the voltammetric response of VS2 electrodes was examined using the DPV curves with the pH ranging from 5 to 9, as shown in Fig. 4e. With an increase in the electrolyte pH, the peak potential shifted negatively, indicating that the redox reaction on the electrode is determined by a proton transfer process.40 The oxidation of the amine group in SMX proceeded via a pH-dependent reaction.41 The maximum peak current was achieved at pH = 6 and was selected as the optimal pH. According to the results presented in Fig. 4f, the linear relationship of potential Epc versus pH was fitted as Epc (V) = 1.108 \u2212 0.032 pH (R2 = 0.990). The obtained slope value is smaller than the Nernstian value (59 mV pH\u22121), demonstrating the same number of protons and electrons involved in the redox reaction.42\nElectrochemical determination of SMX using the VS2 electrode and its sensing mechanism\nThe DPV method was employed for the quantitative electrochemical detection of SMX on the VS2 electrodes, as depicted in Fig. 5a and Fig. S2.\u2020 The peak current values on VS2 electrodes exhibited an upward trend as the SMX concentration increased. A calibration curve for SMX on the VS2 electrodes was acquired within the linear range of 0.06\u201310 \u03bcM, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. The calibration equation is Ipc (\u03bcA cm\u22122) = 1.10c(SMX) (\u03bcM) + 2.850 (R2 = 0.995). Based on the equation, the LOD for SMX on VS2 electrodes is determined to be 0.047 \u03bcM (S/N = 3). DPV tests were performed for the SMX detection on three individual electrodes. Compared to other electrodes used for SMX detection, as presented in Table 1, our SMX electrode achieved a comparatively low LOD for SMX detection and has prospects for application in a wider range for SMX detection.\nThe sensing mechanism model of VS2 electrodes is proposed to better illustrate the reason why VS2 electrodes can be a good candidate for the electrochemical platform towards the sensitive detection of SMX, as presented in Fig. 5c. The voltammetric technique was applied for the determination of SMX on VS2 electrodes in river water samples. During the electrochemical oxidation of SMX on the VS2 electrode interface, two electrons and protons are involved in the reaction process. Herein, on behalf of carbon-based nanomaterials with good electrical conductivity, CNTs and rGO were used to compare their charge transfer ability with VS2. DPV curves of VS2, graphene and CNT electrodes with 10 \u03bcM SMX are presented in Fig. 5d, demonstrating the superior catalytic response of VS2 toward SMX.

These results demonstrated the charge transfer ability of VS2 to be more than those of CNTs and rGO at the electrode interface, validating the prospect of VS2 as a promising base material for modifying electrodes for sensitive SMX detection. The result is also consistent with the results presented in Table 1. Furthermore, CNT or rGO based nanocomposite modified electrodes presented good detection performance towards SMX as presented in Table 1, supporting the great potential of VS2 based nanocomposite modified electrodes for the sensitive detection of SMX in the future.\nRepeatability, anti-interference, and real sample analysis\nTo evaluate the reproducibility of VS2 electrodes for SMX detection (10 \u03bcM), DPV tests were conducted on 10 different electrodes in the potential range of 0.7\u20131.1 V. The DPV curves remained stable at a potential of 0.90 V approximately and maintained good overlapping of the current density, as shown in Fig. 6a. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the peak current was approximately 2.6%, demonstrating the good repeatability of VS2 electrodes. Interference experiments were performed using the DPV curves(Fig. 6b), where 10 \u03bcM of TMP was used as a typical interfering substance within a concentration range of 0.1\u201310 \u03bcM. Notably, to achieve a continuous synergistic effect of antibacterial activity, the combination of TMP and SMX was usually utilized in the clinical treatment.51 The interference of TMP in SMX detection in real samples is necessary.\nThe result demonstrated that TMP did not affect the SMX detection, supporting the potential practical applicability of VS2 electrodes. Besides, the i\u2013t technique was performed on VS2 electrodes in electrolyte containing 10 \u03bcM SMX and other interfering substances such as 50 \u03bcM CPL, 50 \u03bcM FRZ, 50 \u03bcM ERY, 50 \u03bcM Glu, 100 \u03bcM Na\u00b1, 100 \u03bcM K\u00b1, 100 \u03bcM Mg2\u00b1, and 100 \u03bcM Ca2\u00b1, as shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. S3.\u2020 The results revealed the exceptional resistance of VS2 electrodes to interference from other molecules during electrochemical detection.\nTo validate the detection accuracy of VS2 electrodes by the DPV method, HPLC was employed to detect SMX in the same real samples.\nFig. 5 (a) DPV tests of VS2 electrodes with SMX concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 \u03bcM.

Real water samples were prepared by adding a certain mass of SMX to tap water, designated as sample A, B, C, and D. HPLC results were obtained by the computation of the calibration equation, which was determined as Ac = 8.58 \u00d7 10\n3 C \u2212 206 (R2 = 0.999). Herein, C is the concentration of SMX (\u03bcM), and Ac denotes the peak area at a retention time of 11.3 minutes (\u03bcV s), as presented in Fig. 6d. The DPV curves of VS2 electrodes were constructed for the same real samples, as shown in Fig. 6e. Based on the data comparison of the two methods presented in Fig. 6f, the REs for samples A, B, C and D were determined as 2.89%, 3.15%, 3.36%, and 2.62%, respectively, validating the good accuracy of our electrodes. To further demonstrate the practical applicability of VS2 electrodes, the recovery performance in river water samples was determined using the standard addition method.52 As shown in Table S3,\u2020 the prepared SMX sensor exhibited good recovery rates (97.4\u2013106.8%) and low RSD values (1.16\u20131.79%), demonstrating its significant capability for real sample analysis."

Compared to the bare GCE, the VS2 electrode exhibited higher sensitivity towards SMX oxidation, demonstrating excellent SMX detection performance within a detection range of 0.06\u201310 \u03bcM and a LOD as low as 0.047 \u03bcM. The good recovery rates (97.4\u2013106.8%) and practicality of SMX detection in natural waters were validated using the VS2 electrode. Furthermore, the interference resistance of the VS2/GCE electrode was examined by adding other potential interfering substances. In conclusion, this research provides a promising approach for the development of electrochemical sensors based on VS2 composite materials."
