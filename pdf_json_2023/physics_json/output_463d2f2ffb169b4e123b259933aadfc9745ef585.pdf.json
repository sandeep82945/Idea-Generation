    "abstractText": "Chemically modified electrodes (CMEs) based on 2-phenyl-4-((4,6,8-trimethylazulen-1yl)methylene)oxazol-5(4H)-one (M) were obtained by irreversible electrooxidation of M in millimolar solutions in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) in acetonitrile. These CMEs were characterized by a ferrocene redox probe, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The influence of the preparation conditions (charge and potential) was examined. The CMEs were finally used for the analysis of synthetic samples of heavy metal (HM) ions. The paper highlights the importance of potential and electropolymerization charge on the film properties, with accent on recognition of HMs, in order to identify the best conditions for their detection in water. The observed findings are relevant for further design and development of advanced materials based on azulenyl-phenyloxazolone for the analysis of HMs in water.",

Thus, oxazolones are considered important synthons for the synthesis of biologically active or peptidomimetic compounds. They can become the key monomer unit of various polymers and nanomaterials of biomedical uses [1\u20134] or an attractive heterocycle core of complex molecules with numerous biological or pharmaceutical applications involved in several organic transformations [5] (ring-opening reactions, cycloadditions to form new carbon\u2013 carbon and/or carbon\u2013heteroatom bonds and to prepare various selective functionalized molecules, or conjugate additions, alkylation, allylation, arylation, acylation, etc.). For instance, in order to explore new clinical applications, new oxazolone derivatives have been reported as key scaffolds used to enhance the potential effectiveness of sulfonamides by preparing a novel series of 5(4H)-oxazolone-based-sulfonamides with antibacterial, antifungal, or anticancer activities [6]. Some oxazolone derivatives are reported as hypoglycemic agents [7], immunomodulators [8,9], and anti-inflammatory agents [10,11].

Thus, azulene derivatives are used as building blocks for the generation of materials with valuable technical properties [13\u201318]. In particular, several organic compounds containing azulenyl group in their structure have been studied for potential medical applications [19,20]. The good electron-donating capability of azulene [21] motivated the investigation of push-pull compounds containing this moiety linked directly to an electron acceptor (Scheme 1, formula A) or via a conjugated bridge (Scheme 1, formula B) [22\u201325]. Thus, a great number of molecules with varying properties can be synthesized, taking into account the nature of the X=Y bridge and the wide variety of azulene donor groups and electron acceptor groups (Ac). Considering this, our main research focus was directed toward the synthesis and characterization of new molecules belonging to the entire series of compounds of the general formula B with specific properties.

Of great research interest in the electrochemistry application field is the investigation of such organic push-pull systems due to their important technical properties, such as nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, electrochemical behavior, or coloring properties. Several polyazulenes were prepared as potential host molecules [27,28]. They were investigated by different measurements (UV-vis-NIR, EPR, SEM, CV) to find ways to enhance their special properties (conductivity, electronic switching or antioxidant character).

The main characteristics of Fc in CV curves include the potential of Fc/Fc+ anodic (Epa) and cathodic (Epc) peak, the difference between Epa and Epc (\u2206Ep), and the formal potential (Ef) on M-CMEs, which are collected in Table S1. The formation of M films on the GC electrode by CPE was also highlighted by the Fc redox probe. Currents during the film formation were recorded by chronoamperometry. In Figure 7a, several chronoamperograms obtained during CPE preparation at different potentials using the same electrical charge (1 mC) are exemplified.

The resulting CMEs (CME 9, CME 10 and CME 11) were tested by EIS (Table 4). Impedance studies of the modified electrodes were then performed in the same Fc (5 mM) solution in 0.1 M TBAP/CH3CN. The experiments were performed at equilibrium potential (Eeq) and at the imposed potentials (Ei1, Ei2) given in Table 4. Figure 9 shows as an example of EIS curves obtained on CME 10 prepared at the potential of 1 V, and on the GC electrode on which the film was deposited. These curves show two types of variations (one hemispherical and one linear). From their intersection point, the value of the resistance to the charge transfer on the uncovered GC electrode (RGC) and on the film-modified (RMGC) electrodes were estimated (Table 5).\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 540 10 of 21Symmetry 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 23\n(a) (b)\nFigure 8.

The CPE preparation method offers easy and rigorous control of potential and charge during electropolymerization. The anodic stripping method applied to the CMEs obtained by CPE at different potentials led to reproducible CMEs (Figure S11). This feature is very important in all quantitative applications, such as the analysis of HMs, especially for obtaining the calibration curve. Then, each modified electrode (M-CME) was washed with acetonitrile and introduced in 0.1 M acetate aqueous buffer solution (pH = 4.5) where it was equilibrated (15 cycles between\u22120.9 V and 0.6 V) and overoxidized (15 cycles between \u20130.2 V and 1.85 V) using the procedures previously described [38]. They were then introduced into synthetic aqueous solutions containing a mixture of HMs ions at 5\u00b710\u22126 M HM concentrations for each ion and kept under magnetic stirring for 15 min; after that, they were placed in fresh acetate aqueous buffer solution (pH 4.5) and polarized for 3 min at \u20131.0 V (to reduce accumulated cations), and finally subjected to an anodic sweep using the DPV method (as in the examples shown in Figures 10A and 11A). Figure 10A shows the DPV curves obtained on CMEs prepared at different potentials.

            "text": "Evidence for M Films Formation\nIn the electrochemical studies of the M ligand, five oxidation processes (a1\u2013a5) and five reduction processes (c1\u2013c5) were noticed, which intensified with increasing M concentration (Figure 2). The cathodic peak potentials in CV and DPV are properly correlated (the peak potential in DPV is close in value to the half-peak potential in CV). From the detailed analysis of the curves obtained by the three voltammetric methods used, some conclusions can be drawn regarding the processes that appear in the oxidation and reduction scans (Table 1). From the CV, DPV and RDE curves (Figures 2 and 5), the potentials of the processes highlighted by these voltammetric methods were obtained (Table 1). The analysis of these curves also allowed for some particularities of the processes to be highlighted, as listed in Table 1. Thus, the CV and RDE currents in the anodic domain are higher than those in the cathodic domain, while the situation is reversed in the RDE (Figure 5). These features can be explained by the difference in complexity of the processes involved (oxidation, reduction and the formation of films). It is noteworthy that the anodic peak a2 appears in CV for all ligand concentrations but does not appear in DPV (Table 1). This may be due to the formation of films at this potential by anodic oxidation, which were certified and further analyzed in this paper. In addition, the potential of the a5 DPV peak is shifted to more negative values when the M concentration increases. This displacement can be attributed to the value of this potential close to that at which oxidation processes occur in the supporting electrolyte (the formation of oxides, which occurs due to the inherent presence of traces of water in the organic electrolyte). As can be seen from Figure 3a, the currents for the first anodic peak (a1) and the first cathodic peak (c1) increase with the scan rate. For peaks a1 and c1, the correlations are linear with the square root of the scan rate (Figure 3b), showing that these processes are diffusion controlled. From the slopes of these linear dependencies (0.98 \u00d7 10\u22124 and \u22120.97 \u00d7 10\u22124 A\u00b7V\u22121/2\u00b7s1/2, respectively), a 1:1 ratio can be estimated between the numbers of electrons that participate in the first oxidation/reduction process. The anodic peak a1 has a small counter peak in the reverse scan (and was considered quasireversible in Table 1), while a2 has no counterpart in the return scan and represents an irreversible process (Figures 3a and 4). The peak c1 has a corresponding peak (c1\u2032) and was considered quasireversible (the potential difference between peaks c1 and c1\u2032 is 0.127 V, being slightly higher than 0.100 V recorded for the reversible Fc/Fc+ system in the used experimental\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 540 16 of 21\nassembly). This last feature is confirmed by the CVs over different scan domains in Figure 4. From this Figure 4, it can be estimated that the processes c2 and c3 are also quasireversible. All other peaks highlighted at higher potentials (positive or negative) appear as irreversible (Table 1). The comparison of the RDE and DPV methods (as exemplified in Figure 5a, Figure 5b, and Figure 5c, respectively) shows that the currents of the anodic processes are much lower in relation to the cathodic ones. This evident asymmetry is due to film formation occurring more readily at anodic potentials. These films are insulators and block the surface of the electrode, resulting in decreased currents. From the RDE curves in Figure 5b, which were recorded for a concentration of 1 mM, increasing the electrode rotation rate does not greatly influence the oxidation currents, which are small in absolute value. There is a slight increase in the RDE wave from ~0.5 V (which confirms the assignment of quasireversible to correspond, which is likely due to the film formation of a radical-cation from M. This is similar behavior to the previous experiments for benzylidenerhodanine [38] and rhodanine [39]). The formation of cations in azulene is the most likely reaction that can take place at the first oxidation point, because the azulene system is the most easily oxidizable. For potentials more positive than +1.5 V the situation is reversed. An isosbestic point for the current is observed at ~1.5 V. At this potential, there is a change of the electrochemical process to the one started at the potential of the a2 peak. In the cathodic potential range, the RDE currents are higher than the anodic ones and increase when the electrode rotation rate increases from 500 to 1000 rpm, decreasing from 1000 at 1500 rpm. Figure 5c shows an obvious asymmetry of the curves obtained in the anodic and cathodic scans from the RDE. The concentration of M is important especially for cathodic processes, while for anodic ones it is relevant only at potentials more positive than +2 V, in the field of solvent oxidation processes. The curves are consistent with those in Figure 5b (for different rotation rates). The shape of the RDE curves changes in the cathodic range with respect to M concentration from that of a wave (at 0.5 mM and 1 mM) to that of a peak (at 2 mM), as expected, given the role of monomer concentration in a polymerization process. Film formation is favored at a concentration of M equal to 2 mM compared to 1 mM and 0.5 mM. Covering the electrode with film leads to a peak-shaped RDE curve. This is consistent with the formation of insulating films, as the films obtained by electropolymerization of M proved to be and as will be shown below. The latter explanation agrees with the decrease in RDE cathodic currents from 1000 to 1500 rpm, which can be seen in Figure 5b. The RDE study for the cathodic processes showed a significant increase of the currents with the concentration of M. The peak-shaped of the RDE curves at potentials more negative than \u22123 V (Figure 5c) shows that at these potentials a cathodic polymerization process takes place, as also observed on other azulene substrates [37]. Film formation by the electropolymerization of M was evidenced by a ferrocene redox probe. When testing M-CMEs, obtained either by scanning or CPE in ferrocene solution in the supporting electrolyte (0.1 M TBAP/CH3CN), the CV curves obtained on M-CMEs (as those presented on the right side of Figure 6) show much lower currents for Fc compared to those recorded on the bare electrode, but the potential at which ferrocene appears is practically the same (Table S1 and Table 3, respectively), indicating the formation of some isolating thin films. The EIS curves bring valuable information on M-CMEs related to the films\u2019 formation evidence as in the case of other compounds [40]. For instance, the EIS curves for M-CME shown in Figure 9 support the presence of polymer films deposited on the electrode surface at this potential (1 V corresponds to processes occurring mainly in a2 peak). Similar behavior was noticed for films prepared at 0.6 and 1.4 V. The semicircular region of the Nyquist plot at higher frequencies corresponds to a limiting electron transfer process. From its diameter, one can estimate the electron transfer resistance (Rct), which controls the electron transfer kinetics at the electrode interface. From the Nyquist plots for those\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 540 17 of 21\nunmodified (Figure S3) and modified with polymer film (Figure S4), the GC electrodes obtained by CPE at 1.0 V on GCE 2 show that the imaginary part of the impedance (-Z\u201d) is larger for the modified GC electrode, confirming the coating of the electrode with film by electropolymerization. This result agrees with the results obtained by CV (Figure 8). The modified electrodes investigated by EIS were initially analyzed by the redox probe method in ferrocene. Figures S1 and S2 show the CV curves at different scan rates obtained during the characterization in Fc/SE for CME 9, CME 10 and CME 11, all obtained by CPE, but at different potentials (0.6 V, 1.0 V and 1.4 V, respectively). Figure S1 shows the slopes of the linear dependencies of the peak currents on the square root of the scanning rate for each electrode: 6.031 \u00d7 10\u22125 A\u00b7(V/s)\u22121/2 (CME 9); 8.634 \u00d7 10\u22125 A\u00b7(V/s)\u22121/2 (CME 10); 2.988 \u00d7 10\u22125 A\u00b7(V/s)\u22121/2 (CME 11). From these slopes, the active surface area of CMEs (A) was calculated for each film using the Randles\u2013Sevcik Equation (1)\nip = 2.69 \u00b7 105 \u00b7 n3/2 \u00b7 A\u00b7D1/2 \u00b7 C \u00b7 v1/2 (1)\nIn (1), ip is the peak current (A), n is the number of transferred electrons (n = 1), A is the geometric surface area (cm2), D is the diffusion coefficient of the redox probe (2.62\u00b710\u22129 cm2/s [41\u201343]), C is the redox probe concentration (mol/cm3), and v is scan rate of the potential (V/s). The values obtained for A are 0.072 cm2, 0.103 cm2, and 0.036 cm2, respectively, indicating film surfaces for these CMEs of the same order of magnitude as the geometric area of the electrode (S = 0.071 cm2). These values for A depend on the applied electropolymerization potential. During the characterization of the modified electrodes by EIS, the curves obtained on M-CME were compared with those obtained on unmodified GC electrodes (Table 2). From the curves shown in Figure 9, Figures S3 and S4, the resistance to electric charge transfer through the deposited film (RMGC) was evaluated (Table 5). Comparison of EIS curves in the presence and absence of films at different potentials of the EIS study shows that the resistance to electric charge transfer through the film (RMGC) increases compared to that on the bare electrode (RGC), as can be seen from Table 5 where the RMGC values are higher than the corresponding RGC values. The difference between the RMGC and RGC values was assessed as the resistance to charge transfer through the films (\u2206R). From Table 5, it was observed the increase of \u2206R was due to the film formation (\u2206R = RMGC \u2212 RGC > 0). This increase, highlighted on the modified electrodes prepared by CPE, has positive values and depends on the potential applied in the synthesis (0.6 V, 1.0 V, 1.4 V), as well as on the potential applied to the EIS (Table 5). M-CMEs were analyzed by SEM. As in the case of other azulenes [37], the influence of the potential on the morphology of the films prepared at these potentials for different charges of electropolymerization was examined. The films obtained at potentials of 0.6 V, 1 V, and 1.4 V were tested using the same load of 14 mC/cm2 and at 0.6 V at different electropolymerization charges, including 14 mC/cm2, 28 mC/cm2, 56 mC/cm2 and 84 mC/cm2, respectively. The surface morphology of the prepared samples was examined to see the influence of each parameter on the evaluated property. Table 6 shows the deconvolution curves resulting from XPS depending on two variables (electric charge and potential applied during electropolymerization). SEM images for M-CMEs (Figures S5\u2013S10) show a relatively uniform surface arrangement of the polymer matrix. Some clusters are observed on the surface that deviate from the planarity of the sample. Also, the surface shows some mechanical defects (scratches) due to the preliminary cleaning of the electrode before the preparation of the sample. M-CMEs were analyzed by XPS. Variations in surface chemistry are clearly visible in C1s core-level spectra, which were also used to describe the electrode surface after each modification [44]. The C1s core-level spectra allowed a closer examination of the chemical state of element C, as shown in Table 6, and was deconvoluted in three components [45] at around 284 eV, 286 eV and 288 eV. These peaks could be clearly noticed in all samples, except for sample P1. In sample P1, the C 1s peak was deconvoluted into two components, at 284.6 eV (C-C/C=C) and 285.7 eV (C-O). The carbon atoms involved in the C-C/C=C\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 540 18 of 21\nbond and originating from the conjugated honeycomb network of azulene were identified by the strong peak displayed at approximately 284.8 eV and were presented throughout the sample. The C-O and O-C=O bond at 286.2 eV and 288.9 eV originated from a methyl oxazolone film deposited on a carbon electrode. Since the aim of XPS experiments was to see how the variation of the two parameters (potential and electrical charge during electropolymerization) affects the chemistry of the electrode surface, the ratio between C-C/C-O and C-C/O-C=O for samples P2 -P6 has also been calculated for comparison. From Table 7, it can be seen a decrease in the C-C/C-O ratio from 5.68 in the case of the P2 sample to about 2.40 in the case of the P3-P6 samples and an increase in the C-C/O-C=O ratio from 8.45 to about 12 in the case of samples P3-P5. On the basis of these XPS values, it can be said that the variation of the electropolymerization potential from +1 V in P2 to 0.6 V in P3 leads to significant changes in the surface state. In case of samples P3\u2013P5, the variation in the electropolymerization charge does not affect the surface chemistry of the films deposited on the carbon electrodes (the C-C/C-O and C-C/O-C=O ratios have small variations). From the survey curves, the ratio between the percentage of C and O (C/O) was calculated, which indicates the oxidation of the polymer with the increase of the potential applied to the electrodes. Taking into account the AT values, it is observed that the component from 288.9 eV is practically constant for the films of different thicknesses obtained at a potential of 0.6 V at which no overoxidation of the polymer. Polymerization is slower at this potential. However, the images obtained in SEM show that the film was not very homogeneous for the different values of electrical charges, even if the polymerization was done at 0.6 V, which explains these small variations of the SEM signals. Comparing the influence of the potential, it can be seen that the best coverage is obtained at a potential of 1 V, at which the most regular structure appears. At the potential higher than 1.4 V, a polymerization can take place that leads to gaps in the polymer due to the rapid development of the polymer given the favorable potential, or there is an impairment of the signal due to the carbon substrate because the films are thin and non-conductive. The results for the samples obtained at different potentials can be correlated with the electrochemical calculations for the active surface of the polymer, which shows an increase from the potential of 0.6 V to 1 V followed by a decrease towards the value of 1.4 V. The choice of the optimal polymerization potential will depend on the purpose for which these modified electrodes will be used. For HMs ion analysis, M-CMEs were obtained by CPE, a method that provides easy and rigorous control of potential and charge during electropolymerization (Table 2). After preparation, equilibration and superoxidation following anodic stripping procedures highlighted in our laboratory, DPV curves were recorded between \u22121.0 V and 0.6 V. They show stripping peaks for all studied ions. This demonstrates that these ions were complexed into the electrogenerated films. For CMEs obtained at 0.6 V and 1 mC, peaks for Cd, Pb, Cu, and Hg dissolution were observed at potentials of approximately \u22120.80, \u22120.54, \u22120.08, and 0.23 V, respectively, which varies slightly with the concentration of metal ions in the analyzed mixture (Figure 13). However, the most important signal appears for the Pb ion. The influence of the electric potential and charge used in the CPE on the DPV response was examined for each of the HM cations that were analyzed. The influence of the electric potential used in the CPE on the DPV response shows that of the tested potentials the value of 0.6 V of the potential corresponds to the highest response for Pb (II). This potential is located near the a1 peak, reported in the electrochemical study of monomer M, and corresponds to the formation of a more porous film than that prepared at the potentials of the other anodic peaks of M. A potential of 0.6 V was considered for the synthesis of M-CME in the process of optimizing the preparation conditions of these CMEs. Films of different thicknesses were prepared and tested at this potential. Their stripping curves show an optimal response for an electrical charge of 1 mC for Pb and Cu, while the thinner film of 0.5 mC is favorable for Hg ion. For the calibration curves for HMs analysis on M-CMEs, accumulation solutions were used between 5\u00d7 10\u221210 M and 10\u22124 M, which showed better results for Pb among the other\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 540 19 of 21\ninvestigated ions. Linear dependencies for Pb were obtained in the range of concentration between 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 M and 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 M. From the dependences of peak DPV currents for M-CMEs prepared at 0.6 V, 1 mC on metal ion concentrations, the detection limits for each HM ion were estimated, namely: [Cd] = 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 M; [Pb] = 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 M; [Cu] = 10\u22125 M; [Hg] = 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 M."
