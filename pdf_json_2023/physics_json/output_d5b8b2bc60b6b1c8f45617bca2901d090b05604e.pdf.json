In this regard, the present study explored the possibility of using small molecule inhibitors of p38MAPK/MK2 stress signaling pathways as potential agents to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells with abrogated G1 checkpoint to the DNA damaging agent etoposide by specifically targeting the DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle checkpoint. Methods We have applied CCK8 and FACS-based viability assays and cell cycle analysis to investigate the effect of small molecules SB203580 and MK2.III on the sensitivity of small cell lung cancer cells (SCLC) that lack the G1 checkpoint to the DNA damaging agent Etoposide when used in combination. We have also assessed the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy on tumor xenograft suppression with etoposide and MK2.III in immunosuppressed mice. In addition, additional CCK8 cell viability analysis of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, and SW620, and SW480 colorectal cancer cell lines was performed. Results Results suggest that etoposide produces a profound effect on the cell cycle profile of cells in a manner that is consistent with the degree of cell viability that is seen using the viable cell assay. Results of the co-treatment experiments revealed that the p38/MK2 kinase inhibitors SB203580 and MK2.III both enhanced the DNA-damaging effects of etoposide on NCI-H69 cell viability in vitro. Results revealed that in vivo MK2.III was able to act as a chemosensitizer when used in combination with etoposide making NCI-H69 lung cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic drug by 45% compared to single usage of the drug. We also report that MK2.III sensitizes metastatic cell lines SW-620 and MDA-MB-231 to etoposide but does not increase the sensitivity of non-metastasizing SW-480 colorectal cells to DNA damaging agent in vitro. Conclusion Findings reported in this study provide evidence that specific inhibitors of MK2 may indeed improve overall cancer therapy; however, their effectiveness depends on cell types.",

            "text": "A key goal in cancer therapy is to kill cancer cells without also killing the normal cells in the patient\u2014a concept known as the therapeutic window. Although a long-term (and still elusive) \u201cHoly Grail\u201d has been the identification of agents that by themselves selectively kill cancer cells, a more recent and nuanced approach has been to seek secondary agents that selectively sensitize cancer cells to existing treatment regimens (e.g. chemotherapy with DNA damaging agents) when used in combination. This approach seeks to exploit knowledge of the consequences of the genetic lesions that are common in cancer cells that lead to altered cell behavior, changes that might, in turn, be exploited for such a \u2018chemosensitization\u2019 approach.\nOne such approach and the focus of this research centers on the cell cycle progression. Targeting cell-signaling pathways and controlling the cell cycle phases and checkpoints is a comparatively new direction for the treatment of cancer which could provide distinctive opportunities and potential for the improvement of cancer treatment outcomes. Cell cycle progression has five known phases: G0 (gap 0), G1, G2, and M. In the G0 phase cells enter a quiescent, resting state. Upon stimulation by growth factors cells enter the G1 phase when the mRNAs and proteins necessary for DNA replication in the S phase are synthesized. In G2, cells are monitored for the integrity and immutability of DNA replication and prepare to start mitosis. In the M phase, the chromosomes and cytoplasm are divided into two daughter cells. There are two important checkpoints at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries [1], at which times the integrity of cellular components and DNA synthesis are monitored, and cell cycle arrest upon DNA damage is regulated by the p53-p21-dependent G1 checkpoint [2], and the Chk1-Cdc25-dependent G2 checkpoint [3, 4]. In turn, tumor cells are tending towards the accumulation of the mutations leading to deterioration in mechanisms of the cell cycle control that results in an altered capacity to respond to DNA damage, and there are a number of cancer therapy strategies focused on the regulatory proteins controlling cell cycle, such as aurora kinase signaling, BRCA1/2, wingless (WNT) signaling, etc. [5, 6].\nOne of molecules of the great interest is p53. P53 is a cellular tumor antigen that regulates several molecular pathways responsible for cell proliferation and apoptosis [7]. Mutated p53 is typical for many malignant cells, making it an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. As mentioned, cell cycle arrest upon DNA damage in the G1 checkpoint is p53-p21-dependent [2], and many treatment strategies focus on the reactivation of wildtype functions in the mutated p53 protein [8] or the inactivation of mutated p53. Therefore, a combination therapy using two or more chemotherapeutic drugs or\ninhibitors to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic anti-cancer agents could be used to treat p53 mutated cancers, and some animal models have revealed promising outcomes in tumor regression when wild-type p53 was activated in p53 mutated cancers [9]. Yet, such combination chemotherapy is ordinarily focused on p53 mutant cancer cells as p53 impairment causes G1 checkpoint loss [10] therefore leaving cancer cells to rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair and survival. This opens new promises for using inhibitors of G2 checkpoint as chemosensitizers for p53-deficient malignancies [11\u201313], with several checkpoint kinase inhibitors being currently tested in clinical trials [13].\nOne of the promising approaches here is targeting ATR/p38MAPK/MK2 pathway. It has been shown that a chromatin-quality checkpoint in late G2 involves ATR/ p38MAPK/MK2 [14\u201316]. The p38MAPK kinase pathway is one of the stress-activated protein kinases involved in apoptotic cell death that acts as key molecules in the apoptotic onset [17, 18] and is associated with several human pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis [19] and neurodegenerative diseases [20]. The role of p38MAPK kinase in cancer is being widely studied [21] where it was shown to act as an antitumorigenic factor [22] and/ or tumor promotor [21]. Downstream of p38MAPK is the mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2 or MK2), a kinase involved in inflammatory responses, cell division and differentiation, apoptosis, and cell motility [23]. Furthermore, MK2 is activated after DNA damage [14, 24] resulting in cell cycle arrest and ultimately cellular senescence. These characteristics of p38MAPK and MK2 attract much attention as promising targets for cancer therapy taking into consideration that apoptosis and DNA repair are the main mechanisms associated with cell survival during DNA damage [25, 26].\nWork using transgenic mice has recently demonstrated that genetic disruption of the p38MAPK /MK2 pathway specifically sensitizes p53-null mouse cells to DNA-damaging agents [14, 27]. The mechanism of action appears to be that the p53-null cells in the presence of ablation of p38MAPK/MK2 have lost both G1 and G2 DNA damage checkpoint function, and enter mitosis despite the presence of DNA damage, where they die by \"mitotic catastrophe\". In contrast, the p53 wild-type cells can still arrest in response to DNA damage even in the absence of p38MAPK/MK2 pathway function because the p53-dependent G1 checkpoint remains active. These cells halt in G1 and do not enter into mitotic catastrophe. This finding mirrors the data of our collaborators from Cardiff University [unpub obs] where they have shown that small molecule inhibitors of p38MAPK can preferentially sensitize human fibroblasts with abrogated p53 (RNAi\nknock-down) to DNA damaging agents, suggesting a similar mechanism could also be functional in cancer cells. In this regard, the present study explored the possibility of using small molecule inhibitors of p38MAPK/ MK2 stress signaling pathways as potential agents to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells with abrogated G1 checkpoint to the DNA damaging agent etoposide by specifically targeting the DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle checkpoint."

The combination therapy consisted of etoposide and MK2.III and involved two phases: on the preparatory phase, NCIH69 cells were grown in\u00a0vitro until the necessary population of cells (5 \u00d7 106) was achieved for injection in the main phase.\nResults shown in Supplement Fig.\u00a01 demonstrated that overall NCI-H69 cells formed tumors in both mouse lines which grew exponentially with time. Although both mouse lines have shown progressive tumor growth, high concentrations of injected cells (10 \u00d7 106 cells) resulted in accelerated growth 14\u00a0days after injection. The stable and progressive growth seen in the SCID mouse line injected with 5 \u00d7 106 cells compared to BALB/c Nude mouse using the same concentration of injected cells makes the SCID mouse line more suitable for the animal model and further xenograft experiments.\nFinal xenograft experiments using combination chemotherapy in\u00a0immunosuppressed SCID mice The main experiment (injection of the drugs) took place after the tumor growth was established. The tumor growth in mice following the injection of cells was monitored twice a week and upon reaching the volume of ~ 100 mm3, animals were randomized into 5 groups (12 female SCID mice in each group). The drug treatment was performed as follows: the first group was a control and received a placebo in the form of PBS (tumor volume 95 \u00b1 38 mm3); the second group received 12\u00a0 mg/ kg of Etoposide (tumor volume 101 \u00b1 51 mm3); the third group was injected with 4\u00a0mg/kg of MK2.III (tumor volume 105 \u00b1 44 mm3); fourth and fifth groups were injected with 12\u00a0mg/kg of Etoposide and 4\u00a0mg/kg or 2\u00a0mg/kg of MK2.III (tumor volumes 112 \u00b1 57 and 107 \u00b1 49 mm3 respectively). Drugs were injected intraperitoneally daily. Etoposide was injected 3\u00a0 days after the randomization into groups and MK2.III was administered for 28\u00a0 days. Tumor growth/suppression was measured using calipers\nevery 3\u20134\u00a0days for the duration of the 28-day treatment and the tumor volume was calculated as follows:\nAntitumor properties of drugs in the test group were determined based on the slowing of the tumor growth or tumor volume compared with the control group receiving PBS. Animal welfare was monitored throughout the study period to ensure that animals in distress were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. All the animals were also euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation following the completion of the study."

The concentrations used were 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0\u00a0 \u00b5M for SB203580 and MK2.III and 10, 20, 50, 100, 150\u00a0\u00b5M for etoposide. The results are shown in Table\u00a01.\nOur data demonstrated that control NCI-H69 cells (treated only with the carrier molecule DMSO) showed a good cell viability score of 88.5%. Treatment of NCI-H69 cells using etoposide resulted in decreased cell viability with increasing etoposide dose. These decreases in cell viability are moderate to high; however, this should be a suitable range for the assessment of any synergy between etoposide and kinase inhibitors.\nIn the presence of MK2.III we observed a cell viability ranging from 87.4% at the lowest dose to 83.5% at the highest dose of MK2.III, suggesting that MK2.III by itself has little effect on NCI-H69 cell viability compared to DMSO treatment alone, except for a small effect at the highest MK2.III dose. Using increasing doses of SB203580 gave a cell viability score ranging from 89% to 85.1% compared to 88.5% in the DMSO control, showing that SB203580 treatment has little effect on the viability of NCI-H69 cells compared to DMSO. Our preliminary experimental data on drug titrations (not shown) allowed\n(1)V = L x W2/2, where L is length, W is tumor width volume,\nus to use 2.5\u00a0\u00b5M SB203580 and 1.0\u00a0\u00b5M MK2.III in further experiments.\nThus, NCI-H69 cells were treated with etoposide at doses from 0\u00a0\u00b5M to 150\u00a0\u00b5M combined with SB203580 at 2.5\u00a0\u00b5M, or MK2.III at 1.0\u00a0\u00b5M respectively and subjected to FACS analysis for viability. The results are presented in Supplement Figs.\u00a02\u20134 and tabulated in Table\u00a02. Using etoposide alone resulted in cell viability in control samples ranging from 57.3% at the dose of 20\u00a0 \u00b5M to 37.5% at the highest dose Table\u00a02, Supplement Fig.\u00a02). Although the effects of etoposide and p38MAPK/MK2 inhibitors on NCI-H69 cell viability in this set of the experiments are larger than seen in Table\u00a01, they are within the variability seen in repeated experiments (data not shown).\nSB203580 alone at 2.5\u00a0 \u00b5M did not affect NCI-H69 cell viability compared to the DMSO control. However, SB203580 showed a moderate effect on cell viability when used in combination with etoposide (in concentrations ranging from 20 to 150\u00a0\u00b5M) compared to etoposide alone"

In turn, the effect of 1.0\u00a0\u00b5M MK2.III on NCI-H69 cells was moderate, decreasing cell viability from 74.6% to 66.1% (Table\u00a02, Supplement Fig.\u00a0 3). However, the combined effects of MK2.III at 1.0\u00a0\u00b5M and etoposide were large, with the viability decreasing to 22\u201325% even at low etoposide doses (Table\u00a02, Supplement Fig.\u00a04). This suggests a substantial synergy between these agents.\nIn agreement with the FACS-based cell viability assay, CCK8 analysis has revealed similar dynamics demonstrating a significant decrease in the survival rate of NCI-H69 cells treated with etoposide in concentrations ranging from 20 to 150\u00a0 \u03bcM and 1\u00a0 \u03bcM of MK2.III compared to the cells incubated with etoposide alone (Fig.\u00a01). As can be seen from the figure etoposide reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The percentage of surviving cells varies in a range from 72 to 36% in dosages from 20\u00a0\u03bcM to 150\u00a0\u03bcM. Simultaneous treatment of etoposide with MK2.III leads to viability decreasing in all doses when compared to cells treated with Etoposide alone.\nCell cycle profile of\u00a0NCI\u2011H69 cells treated with\u00a0etoposide, MK2.III and\u00a0SB203580 Treatment of NCI-H69 cells with DMSO results in a normal cell cycle DNA profile with a large G1 and small G2 peaks (Fig.\u00a0 2A). Treatment with etoposide (Fig.\u00a0 2A) shows a pronounced reduction in the size of the G1 peak with increasing etoposide dose, indicative of a G2 cell cycle arrest. The G2 peak shifts predominantly to the right with an increasing dose of DNA damaging agent. Treatment of NCI-H69 cells with the MK2.III shows\nlittle effect on the cell cycle profile (Fig.\u00a0 2B, D) showing no obvious G1 or G2 cell arrest. A similar effect on the cell cycle profile was seen in NCI-H69 cells with SB203580 (Fig.\u00a02C, E). At the same time, cell cycle analysis of etoposide-treated cells in combination with either MK2.III (Fig.\u00a03A) or SB203580 (Fig.\u00a03B) show a G1 peak but a very small, if not absent G2 peak, suggestive of a G1 arrest in these cells compared to the single treatment profiles (Fig.\u00a03)."

We have chosen to use MK2.III for the in\u00a0vivo work rather than SB203580 as the former is more effective at reducing cell viability in combination with etoposide based upon the in\u00a0vitro experiments (see Table\u00a02). The cell line NCL-H69 of human small-cell lung carcinoma was chosen for in\u00a0 vivo experiments because it has a mutation in the P53 gene (p.E171*), a moderate sensitivity to etoposide [28], and is widely used for studies of chemoresistance of cancer [29\u201331].\nWe investigated the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of small molecules (MK2.III) with intraperitoneal and intravenous injection before studying its tumor suppressor properties in combination with DNA-damaging agents. The results of the one-time intraperitoneal injection with three doses of the small molecules shown in Table\u00a0 3 revealed that 2\u00a0 mg/kg administration of the drug through intraperitoneal injection showed moderate absorbance of the small molecule in the serum of mice\nwith Tmax of 2\u00a0h and Cmax of 2.15\u00a0ng/ml while higher concentrations of the drug resulted in a higher yield of the drug within 30\u00a0 min after injection showing Cmax around 40\u00a0ng/ml.

            "text": "In the current study, we have investigated the ability of p38MAPK/MK2 inhibitors to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells lacking G1 checkpoint (NCI-H69 lung cancer cells) to DNA-damaging anticancer drug etoposide. Results of the co-treatment experiments have demonstrated that the p38MAPK/MK2 kinase inhibitors SB203580 and MK2.III both enhanced the DNA-damaging effects of etoposide on NCI-H69 cell viability in\u00a0vitro. In\u00a0vivo, results revealed that MK2.III was able to act as a chemosensitizer when used in combination with etoposide making NCI-H69 lung cancer cells more sensitive to the chemotherapeutic drug. We have also analyzed the cell cycle profile of NCI-H69 cells treated with etoposide, MK2.III and SB203580. Our data suggest SCLC cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle compared to the single treatment profiles.\nSome cancer cells have abrogated G1 checkpoints depending on their p53 status, the tumor suppressor molecule involved in the regulation of cellular senescence possibly as a response mechanism to DNA damage [10]. However, those cancer cells still have activated G2 checkpoint, a chromatin-quality checkpoint in late G2 involving ATR/p38MAPK/MK2 [14\u201316, 24]. Genetic disruption of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway can specifically sensitize p53-null mouse cells to DNA-damaging agents [27, 33]. The cancer cells that lack p53 with abrogated p38MAPK/MK2 pathways are unable to go through G1 and G2 DNA damage checkpoints and will enter mitosis with damaged DNA where they undergo apoptosis by \u201cmitotic catastrophe\u201d. Nevertheless, p53 wild-type cells are still able to arrest in response to DNA damage as the p53-dependent G1 checkpoint in those cells remain intact making such cells halt in G1 and avoid mitotic catastrophe. This is a novel approach to therapy in cancer treatment as the inhibitors of p38MAPK and MK2 inhibitors selectively target cells depending on their p53-null status thus leaving healthy cells intact.\nSeveral p38MAPK and MK2 pathway inhibitors have previously shown the ability to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents when used in combination. Some studies have shown that SB203580 inhibited the activity of p38MAPK in gastric cancer cells (BGC823) consequently improving the sensitivity of BGC823\ncells to doxorubicin and induced cell death [34]. Furthermore, co-treatment with SB202190 and irinotecan improved the sensitivity of chemoresistant colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapy [35], and a p38\u03b1MAPKselective inhibitor SCIO-469 reduced tumor growth in multiple myeloma xenograft tumors by enhancing the effect of bortezomib [23]. An inhibitor of p38MAPK BIRB796 inhibited proliferation and invasion in U87 and U251glioblastoma cells in\u00a0 vitro [36] and enhanced the antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic agents in cervical cancer [37] and human oral epidermoid carcinoma cell line [38] both vitro and in\u00a0 vivo. However, several attempts to use the p38MAPK pathway as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment failed due to side effects on the heart, liver, and nervous system associated with p38MAPK inhibitor toxicities [39].\nCompared to p38MAPK the MK2 pathway has been less studied, however, some data suggest that MK2 knockdown reduces in\u00a0vivo growth of multiple myeloma in mouse models with MK2 overexpression leading to bortezomib and doxorubicin chemoresistance by reducing apoptosis [40]. In addition, a combination of MK2 inhibitor IV with bortezomib, doxorubicin, or dexamethasone suppressed the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells and improved survival in mouse models [41]. In 311our study, we have utilized the small molecule MK2 inhibitor III (MK2.III). MK2.III belongs to a relatively novel class of MK2 inhibitors with potent cellular activity based on the pyrrolo-pyrimidone core structure [42, 43]. MK2.III is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of MK2 with a high degree of selectivity [42, 43], however, limited information is available regarding its chemo-sensitizing effects. Besides, the pharmacokinetics of MK2.III has not been previously reported yet. Therefore, we have investigated the combined effects of etoposide and MK2.III on p53 mutated cancer cells in\u00a0 vitro and in\u00a0 vivo as well as pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of MK2.III injected intraperitoneally and intravenously.\nIt has been reported that the effect of MK2.III on the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy depends on the chemotherapy drug. For example, inhibition of MK2 by MK2.III was shown to sensitize p53 mutated pancreatic cancer cells (Panc1 and MIA PaCa-2) and osteosarcoma (U2OS) to cisplatin [44], and, in contrast, protect cancer cells from gemcitabine [44\u201346]. In our study, we utilized the SCLC cell line NCI-H69. According to published data, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most malignant among the various types of lung cancer, characterized by the emergence of drug resistance, which is still a serious clinical problem [29]. Standard first-line therapy for metastatic SCLC involves treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitor II etoposide [47], however, many cases of etoposide-resistant lung cancer have been\nidentified in recent years [28]. We have chosen the NCLH69 cell line of human small-cell lung carcinoma due to its mutated status in the P53 gene (p.E171*) and moderate sensitivity to etoposide [28]. In our study, the combined effects of MK2.III at 1.0\u00a0\u00b5M and etoposide are large compared to SB203580, with the viability decreasing to 22\u201325% even at low etoposide doses.\nWe have also performed additional experiments using colorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620, and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. MDA-MB-231 is a human breast cancer cell line derived from the metastatic breast adenocarcinoma of a 51-year-old Caucasian woman. The cells of this line are p53 mutant, metastatic, and very invasive [48, 49]. SW-480 and SW-620 colorectal cancer cells were isolated from primary colon adenocarcinoma (SW-480) and lymph node metastasis (SW-620) of the same patient [50, 51]. However, despite the similar origin and p53-null status, the cells of these two lines respond distinctly to cellular stress: SW480 line demonstrates a normal DNA repair phenotype [51]. In our experiments, we observed that MK2.III sensitized metastatic cell lines SW-620 and MDA-MB-231 to etoposide, whereas, MK2.III exposure did not increase the sensitivity of non-metastasizing SW-480 colorectal cells to anti-cancer drug.\nIn vivo, combination chemotherapy of etoposide and MK2.III at a dose of 4\u00a0 mg/kg on tumor xenografts in immunosuppressed mice resulted in up to a 45% decrease in tumor growth compared to single usage of the drug after 18\u00a0 days of treatment. Although we have not observed any differences in tumor sizes among treatment groups starting from the 25th day of the experiment, this might be attributed to the limitations of our research design, since only one treatment regimen (3 daily injections of etoposide and 28 daily injections of MK2.III) and only two MK2.III doses were tested. Furthermore, during treatment mice may increase their ability to excrete MK2. III with time. This may indicate that MK2.III is effective at the early stages of treatment once reaches serum, however, naturally gets reduced due to decreased serum levels, and repeated dosing is needed. In fact, MK2.III is an ATP competitive inhibitor and an increased level of intracellular ATP may also reduce its effectiveness [52]. One possible factor contributing to the increased ATP levels could be the rise in extracellular ATP (eATP) concentration triggered by cell death [53]. Consequently, cancer cells have the capability to internalize eATP, leading to a significant increase in intracellular ATP levels, which, in turn, promotes cell proliferation and drug resistance [54]. Therefore, the concentration of MK2.III must be controlled due to non-linear pharmacokinetics and its possible competition with ATP and more studies are needed to address this issue.\nAs mentioned, the pharmacokinetics of MK2.III have not been previously reported and only limited information is available regarding pharmacological profile of MK2.III analogs [43, 55]. As an example, nonlinear pharmacokinetics have been described following oral administration of the pyrrolo-pyrimidones inhibitor MK2 (Compound 1) in rats [55]. In our study, we have found nonlinear PH of MK2.III as well. Besides, we have shown that the pharmacokinetic profile of MK2.III with peritoneal administration was improved compared to oral administration. We suggest that the nonlinearity of the pharmacokinetics of MK2.III is attributed to its physicochemical properties, in particular, the poor solubility of the inhibitor [52]. In addition, one of the reasons for non-linear FC may be the slow penetration of the drug through the serous surfaces with the administration of elevated concentrations of the inhibitor. On the other hand, despite poor solubility and low bioavailability, pyrrolo-pyrimidones inhibitors are weakly bound to blood and culture medium proteins, which in turn can allow high blood (or plasma) concentrations of the free drug to be achieved [43]."

            "text": "In conclusion, our data suggest that inhibiting the activity of MK2 signaling pathways in the G2 phase of the cell cycle using small molecules are attractive targets for further research in chemoresistance. This approach may not be unique to SCLC cells but can also be explored in other cell lines of various cancers. Hence, it may open future perspectives on studying the role of the MK2 pathway and its inhibitors in combination therapy during cancer treatment. This data is undoubtedly a key finding in improving the effectiveness of the chemotherapy, which uses the strategy to lower the doses of the DNA damaging agents with the help of small molecules (inhibitors of the MK2 pathway). Findings reported in this study provide evidence that specific inhibitors of MK2 may indeed improve overall cancer therapy; however, their effectiveness depends on cell types. As cancer treatment moves towards a more personalized medical approach, proper diagnosis paired with targeted and informed approaches to treating specific types of cancer with in-depth knowledge of chemoresistance may prove to be a useful strategy for overcoming drug treatment failures that ultimately lead to recurrence and death.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12885- 023- 11319-x.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Supplement Figure\u00a01.
