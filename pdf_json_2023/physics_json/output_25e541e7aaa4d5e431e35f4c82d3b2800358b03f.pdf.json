            "text": "Electrocatalytic reactions occurring at solid-liquid interfaces enable the reversible conversion of chemical energy and electricity [1,2]. To improve the efficiency of electrocatalysis, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing new catalysts and optimizing their morphologies. Recently, it has been shown that not only electrode materials and solvents, but also cations in electrolyte solutions have profound effects on the activity and selectivity of a large variety of electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction [3], hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) [4], oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [4,5], CO oxidation [6], CO reduction reaction (CORR) [7\u20139] and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [10\u201313]. Consequently, many studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms of the cation effects on electrocatalytic reactions.\nGenerally speaking, cations at electric double layers (EDLs) can influence the strengths of interfacial electric fields, the local environments of active sites, the structures of interface water, local pH values, etc., based on which various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the cation effects on different electrocatalytic reactions [14]. For instance, Markovic and co-workers [4] found that the trend of the cation-dependent activity of ORR, HOR and methanol oxidation on the Pt electrode follows the order Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ >> Li+, which is opposite to the order of the interaction energies between cations and surface-adsorbed OH, suggesting that the cations at interfaces block the active surface sites. Waegele and co-workers [8] reported that, for CORR on the Cu electrode, increasing the size of alkylammonium ions largely decreases the ethylene selectivity in favor of by-product H2, and proposed that the large size of alkylammonium ions decreases the hydrogen bonding between surface CO and water, thus hindering CO dimerization. More recently, Koper and co-workers [10] revealed that CO2RR cannot proceed on Ag, Cu and Au electrodes unless using metal ions as supporting electrolytes, and suggested that the short-range electrostatic interaction with partially desolvated cations is key to the stabilization of the reaction intermediate CO\u22122 . Usually, there are a few possible explanations proposed for the cation effects of electrocatalytic reactions such as CORR [7,8,15] and CO2RR [10\u201312], but the\nC\u00a9TheAuthor(s) 2023.

In order to reveal the molecular origin of cation effects, several fundamental questions need to be addressed; for example, how the cations alter the structures of interface water and potential distribution, and how they interact with reaction intermediates and affect surface reactions.\nComplementary to experimental techniques [5,14,16\u201318], ab initio modeling of EDLs is an effective approach to investigate the cation effects at the molecular level. In particular, ab initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) has been demonstrated in recent years to be a useful tool to explore the microscopic structures of EDLs. For example, it was revealed by AIMD simulations that the orientations of interface water molecules are strongly dependent on the electrode potential [19\u201323]; theOHbonds of water change the direction from the electrode surface to bulk solution when shifting the potential to positive. Moreover, it was shown that the interaction mode between cations and surface adsorbates is also potential dependent [24,25]. Cations, especially with large size, tend to undergo partial desolvation when increasing the strength of the electric field at interfaces, and as a result, the interaction between cations and surface adsorbates changes from the long-range electrostatic attraction to short-range coordination. Recently, Yang and co-workers [26] showed with AIMD that the nature of cations is also important to the interaction with surface adsorbates; cations with lower hydration energies (i.e. Cs+) are easier to desolvate and coordinate with surface adsorbates.\nTo elucidate the cation effects on EDL structures and capacitances, and their importance to electrocatalysis, we employ AIMD to systematically simulate a series of electrified Pt(111)-COad/water interfaces with a variety of alkali metal and alkylammonium ions. The Pt(111)-COad/water interface is chosen as the model system for this study because of the following considerations, although Pt is not a promising catalyst for CORR and CO2RR. First, the double-layer capacitances of Pt-COad/water interfaces with different cations have been measured in a recent experimental work [25], thus enabling direct comparison between experiment and theoretical computation. Second, the coverage and adsorption pattern of CO on the Pt(111) surface have beenwell characterized by electrochemical scanning tunnelingmicroscopy (EC-STM) [27], which helps build realistic interface models.Third, since we consider high coverage of surface CO in this study and the metal surface is not in direct contact with the electrolyte, the Pt-COad surface should not differ much from the Cu-COad surface.\nBased on extensive AIMD simulations, we propose that at the same potential conditions the EDL may be altered in various ways by cations with different sizes and hydration energies, such as varying surface charge densities, hydrogen bonding between surfaceCOand interfacewatermolecules, and coordinationbetween surfaceCOmolecules and cations. We also show that the surface charge densities and coordination with water and cations can have significant impact on CO dimerization, a key step in CORR and CO2RR. What is interesting is that we demonstrate that all these structural factors can be wrapped into the sole descriptor of Helmholtz capacitance for measuring the cation effects on the activity of CO dimerization. We believe that this finding is of great importance for understanding the microscopic mechanisms of cation effects on EDLs, anddeveloping strategies for improving electrocatalysis."

Based on ECSTM measurements [27], the surface coverage of CO in the interface models is set to 3/4 monolayers (MLs), and they are arranged with a (2 \u00d7 2)-3CO pattern. Note that in the interface models, the electronic charges on the Pt(111)-COad surfaces are fully compensated by the counter ions kept in the vicinity of the surfaces, resulting in compact Helmholtz layers. The diffuse layer of the EDL is absent in this setup, and thus our models correspond to high ionic strength conditions when the diffuse layers are suppressed [28,29]. EDLs with alkali metal ions and alkylammonium ions, including Li+, Na+, Rb+, Cs+, Me4N+, Et4N+ and Pr4N+, are modeled at the same surface charge density \u03c3 = \u221214.6\u03bcC/cm2, as shown in Fig. S1 within the online supplementary material. To study the effect of the interfacial ionic concentration on double-layer capacitance, we have also modeled interfaces with extra Cs+-Cl\u2212 ion pairs. All interface models are simulated with AIMD for dozens of picoseconds to sufficiently sample the dynamic structures of the electrified interfaces, and the cation effects on the EDL structures and capacitances are then investigated. It should be mentioned that the surface pattern of the CO adlayer is well kept during the AIMD simulations (see Fig. S6 within the online supplementary material), indicating that the structures of the electrode surfaces are stable and the same for all interface models.

Excess charges on the surface are separated into two sub-layers, on the Pt surface (\u03c3 Pt) and on the oxygen side of the CO adlayer (\u03c3 CO).\nMethods section and Section S1 of the online supplementary material.\nThe electrode potentials of all interface models are calculated using the recently developed computational standard hydrogen electrode (cSHE) method [30\u201333]. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the computed Fermi levels of metal electrodes are referenced to the solvation free energy of a proton (i.e. deprotonation energyof a solvatedhydronium), which can be converted into the SHE scale for direct comparison with experiment. A brief description of the cSHEmethod is summarized in Section S2of the online supplementary material. As listed in Table 1, the computed potential of zero charge (PZC) of the Pt(111)-COad/water interface is 1.08 \u00b1 0.06 V vs SHE, which is almost the same as the experimental data [34,35].The electrode potentials of all the EDL models are also computed. It was reported that the capacitance of the Pt-COad/water interface is independent of the electrode potential [25,35]. Thus, we can estimate the Helmholtz capacitance (CH) of each EDL model by taking CH = \u03c3/ U with PZC as a reference. It is encouraging to find from Table 1 that nearly all computed CH are in quantitative agreement with experiment [25]. This is a strong indication that our calculation is a good representation of electrified Pt-COad/water interfaces. We note that the computed CH of alkali metal ions appear less accurate than that of alkylammonium ions, particularly for those with large sizes, e.g. Rb+ and Cs+. In a very recent work, Waegele and co-workers [36] proposed that cations (e.g. Cs+) with lower hydration energies are more concentrated at the interface than those with higher hydration energies (e.g. Li+). To understand the effect of interface cation concentration, we model an interface with two Cs+ and one Cl\u2212 ions. It is shown in Table 1 that the electrode potential of model Cs+(2) + Cl\u2212(1) is 0.12 V more positive thanmodel Cs+(1), and the computedCH increases from 11.7 to 13.0 \u03bcF/cm2, becoming closer to the experimental value (14.3 \u03bcF/cm2). Thus, our results indeed support the finding reported by Waegele and co-workers [36]. Overall, comparing the tabulated values of CH and ion radii, several key features can be obtained: (i) the EDL capacitances for alkylammonium ions are noticeably smaller than those for alkali metal ions; (ii) for alkylammonium ions, CH decreases with increasing ion size; (iii) the trend for alkali metal ions is somewhat less clear, but the experimental CH shows a slight increasing tendency with increasing ion size. Residence locations and local structures of cations at interfaces It can be seen from Fig. 1(b) that the COmolecules on the Pt(111) surface act as a dielectric layer with a finite dielectric constant. Surface charge is separated into two components, charges on Pt (\u03c3 Pt) and charges on CO (\u03c3CO). Similar results have been reported by Sundararaman and co-workers [39]. As a consequence, in addition to the capacitance from water dielectric screening (Csol), the CH of the Pt(111)-COad/water interface is composed of\nPage 3 of 11\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/9/nw ad105/7134097 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nTable 1.

Here CH is decomposed into two components, the CO-adlayer-induced capacitance (Cad) and water-dielectric-screeninginduced capacitance (Csol), which are connected in series.The rion is determined from crystal radii for alkali metal ions [37] and van derWaal\u2019s volume for alkylammonium ions [38].\nanother component, the CO-adlayer-induced capacitance (Cad). According to the mathematical formulation derived in Section S3 of the online supplementary material, we can show that Cad and Csol are connected in series, and that Cad is only dependent on the partition of surface charge on the Pt(111) surface. Figure 1(b) and Fig. S3(c) within the online supplementary material indicate that the nature of cations does not affect the partition of \u03c3 Pt. This means that Cad is a constant for all our modeled interfaces, 44.5 \u03bcF/cm2, and the corresponding Csol values are then calculated as listed in Table 1. In addition, we find that the surface coverage of CO (\u03b8CO) significantly affects themagnitude of \u03c3 Pt (see Fig. S14 within the online supplementary material), and thus \u03b8CO is also an important property for the CH of thePt(111)-COad/water interface that should not be ignored.\nIt is well established that the solvent capacitance layer resembles a parallel-plate capacitor [23,28,40], and its capacitance can be expressed as Csol = \u03b5sol\u03b50/lsol, where lsol and \u03b5sol represent the width and dielectric constant of the solvent capacitance layer, respectively, and \u03b50 is the dielectric constant of vacuum. SinceCsol is inversely proportional to lsol, the variation in Csol for different cations is often attributed to the difference in thewidths of the solvent capacitance layer [25,40,41]. To verify this hypothesis, we analyze the residence locations (i.e. z coordinate with reference to the Pt(111) surface) of the cations at the electrified Pt(111)-COad/water interfaces. Figure 2(a) plots the z coordinates of cations as a function of their radii (rion). It is interesting to find that, for cations with relatively low hydration energies (below 70 Kcal/mol; see the numbers in parentheses in Fig. 2(a)), such as Rb+ and Me4N+, their z coordinates generally become larger with increasing rion, and shows a good linear correlation.On\nthe other hand, cations with high hydration energies (\u223c100Kcal/mol or above), i.e. Li+ andNa+, are apparently off and above the trend line.\nTo understand the linear correlation between the z coordinate and rion for cations with low hydration energies and the abnormality for alkali metal ions with high hydration energies, we investigate the local structures of these cations at the electrified interfaces. Typical snapshots taken from AIMD trajectories are shown in Fig. 2(c\u2013f). We first note that, for ions like Cs+ and Pr4N+ having low hydration energies, their solvation shells are partially removed, with ions directly in contact with the CO adlayer. It can thus be understood why the z coordinates of these ions increase along with increasing ion size. It should be mentioned that the rion values of alkylammonium ions are estimated from the van der Waal\u2019s volume by assuming that they are spheres [38]. The Pr4N+ ions tend to orient three side chains towards the surface, as seen in Fig. 2(f). This means that the distance of the N atoms of Pr4N+ from the surface will be shorter than the estimated rion, and as a consequence, in Fig. 2(a) the data point of Pr4N+ is slightly below the trend line. In addition, different from the so-called \u2018cation-specific adsorption\u2019 [36], we find that the interaction between these cations and CO is purely electrostatic in nature. No partial charge transfer occurs between cations and the metal surface, which is evidenced by the electron difference plot shown in Fig. 1(b), electronic density of states (DOS) shown inFig. S4within the online supplementarymaterial andMulliken charges of cations listed in Table S1 within the online supplementary material. For cations with higher hydration energies like Na+, our AIMD calculations show that their solvation shells are complete at the electrified interfaces. As shown in Fig. 2(e), those cations do not directly contactwith surfaceCO, and thereby they stay\nPage 4 of 11\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/9/nw ad105/7134097 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nPr4N +\nNa+\nWavenumber (cm\u20131) 1600 1700 1800 1900\nV D\nO S\n(a .u\n.)\nPZC, lCO = 1.175\u00c5 \u20131e0 (uncoordinated), lCO = 1.182\u00c5 \u20131e0 (Cs\n+ coordinated), lCO = 1.191\u00c5 \u20131e0 (Pr4N + coordinated), lCO = 1.185\u00c5\nE\nCl-\nCs+\nCs+\n2.52.01.51.00.5 3.53.0 4.0 rion (\u00c5)\n7.0\n6.5\n6.0\n5.5\n5.0\nz co\nor di\nna te\n(\u00c5 ) Li\n+\n(\u2013124)\nNa+ (\u201398)\nCs+ (\u201363)\nRb+ (\u201370)\n(b)\n(a) (c) (d)\n(e) (f)\nFigure 2.

As shown in Fig. 2(b), the vibrational frequency of the hollow-site CO shows a red shift in the presence of an interfacial electric field due to the well-known Stark effect, and the C\u2212O bond length (lCO) is accordingly increased. Moreover, upon coordination with metal cations such as Cs+, the CO frequency undergoes a further red shift owing to the short-range electrostatic interaction, and similar polarization effects have also been observed in recent work [43,44]. In comparison, the short-range electrostatic interaction with CO of Cs+ is much stronger than that of Pr4N+, and it is because the excess charges on Cs+ are more localized than Pr4N+ (see Fig. S5(h) within the online supplementary material). The ion distributions at the interface in the presence and\nabsence of extra ion pairs are also compared. As shown in Fig. 2(c\u2013d) and Fig. S9 within the online supplementary material, the distributions of Cs+ in two models are almost the same, and due to the electrostatic repulsion, Cl\u2212 stays further away from the surface compared to Cs+. As a consequence, the extra Cs+-Cl\u2212 pair forms a net dipole at the interface, which is expected to increase the electrode potential and CH, in line with AIMD results."

The standard error bars are shown for the z coordinates of cations. The inset shows the distributions of the dipole orientation of interface water molecules (\u03c1H2Ocos\u03d5) along the surface normal. Here \u03d5 is defined as the angle between the bisector of water and the surface normal. (b) The distribution profiles of water density (\u03c1H2O) along the surface normal (z coordinate) at electrified interfaces with different cations. The insets show two typical snapshots of the Pt(111)COad/water interface when the surface is neutral and charged. (c) Count of interface water molecule count (Nw) at electrified interfaces with different ions. (d) Averaged number of hydrogen bonds (NHbond) between surface CO and water.\nbecause this correlation is valid for ions having both full and partial solvation shells. A minor exception is the bulky Pr4N+ ion; considering its large size, one would expect that a significant amount of water may be excluded by the ions at the interface, leading to a different dielectric constant of the interface (see below).\nWe then investigate the cation effects on the structures of interfacewater atPt(111)-COad/water interfaces. It can be seen from Fig. 3(b) (see also Fig. S10 within the online supplementary material for the results of other cations) that the density distributions of water (\u03c1H2O) are rather different with different cations as counter ions at the electrified interfaces. The number of interface water molecules (Nw) is counted and averaged along the AIMD trajectories of the interface models and presented in Fig. 3(c). It is interesting to note that introducing alkali metal ions at the interfaces hardly changes the number of interface water molecules Nw. In contrast, Nw decreases significantly by introducing alkylammonium ions at the interfaces. In particular, for Pr4N+, Nw reduces to less than half of those in\nmodels with alkali metal ions. Fewer interface water molecules implies that the dielectric constant \u03b5sol of the interface for Pr4N+ would be considerably smaller than those with alkali metal ions, consistent with the lowCsol for Pr4N+ measured in experiment [25].\nThe inset of Fig. 3(a) shows the distributions of the dipole orientation of interface water molecules (\u03c1H2Ocos\u03d5) at PZCandnegative potentials with different cations (see Fig. S11 within the online supplementarymaterial for the results of other cations). At negatively charged surfaces, the interface water molecules tend to orient with their O\u2212H bonds pointing towards the surface (\u2018H-down\u2019 water), owing to electrostatic attraction between the partially positively charged H atoms and the surfaces [45]. Similar configurations of the interface water molecules have been observed at other electrified metal interfaces [19,20,23,24]. As shown in the insets of Fig. 3(b), there are alsomore hydrogenbonds formed between interface water and surface CO molecules at negatively charged interfaces compared to the PZC condition. It can be seen from Fig. 1(b)\nPage 6 of 11\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/9/nw ad105/7134097 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nthat most of the negative surface charge is located at the O atoms of the surface CO, strengthening the hydrogen bonding between the surface CO and \u2018Hdown\u2019 water.\nThe averaged number of hydrogen bonds (NHbond) accepted by each CO is illustrated in Fig. 3(d) for different interface models. It is known that the neutral CO is hydrophobic, and thus there are almost no hydrogen bonds formed between CO and water at PZC. After negatively charging the surface, we find that NHbond increases considerably for all the interfaces with different counter ions, indicating that NHbond is dependent of the surface charge density. Figure 3(d) also shows that the cation size has a significant impact on NHbond. In the EDLs with small alkali metal ions like Li+ and Na+, each surface CO can form on average 0.4\u20130.5 hydrogen bonds with water. Also, it can be shown that NHbond decreases when the ion size increases, and in particular for bulky Pr4N+,NHbond reduces to only 0.25. This can be readily understood: the large size of Pr4N+ excludes water from the interface, thus hindering direct contact between surface CO and water."

            "heading": "Significance to electrocatalytic CO dimerization",
            "text": "We now explore how the cation-dependent Helmholtz capacitance and interface structure correlate with the activities of electrocatalytic reactions. The reaction examined here is the CO dimerization process, which is widely accepted as the ratelimiting step for the generation of C2+ products in CO2RR and CORR [7\u20139,26,46,47], and it has been known for several decades [7\u20139,11,15,41] that the nature of cations has prominent influence on the selectivity of C2+ products. It should be noted that Cu, rather than Pt, is a good catalyst for the CO dimerization reaction. However, at the electrochemical conditions that the metal surfaces are adsorbed with saturated CO, the properties of the Cu-COad/water interface would be very similar to the Pt-COad/water interface. Moreover, Fig. S12 within the online supplementary material supports the fact that the excess charge distribution on the Cu-COad surface is almost the same as that on the Pt-COad surface. Therefore, in this work we use the calculated structure and dielectric property of the Pt-COad/water interface to provide a qualitative understanding of the cation effects on the CO dimerization reaction that occurs at the Cu-COad/water interface.\nIn experiment the cation effects on the performance of electrocatalytic reactions are compared under the same electrode potential, while in our cal-\nculation above the cation effects on the structures of Pt(111)-COad/water interfaces are studied at the same surface charge density. Therefore, in order to better connect our calculation with the experimental results, we map our simulation results of the Pt(111)-COad/water interfaces at the same surface charge density (\u03c3 ) to the same electrode potential (U). As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), at the same appliedU (U < PZC), the amount of negative surface charge follows the order ofmagnitude ofHelmholtz capacitance (CH; seeTable 1), i.e.\u03c3Cs+ \u223c \u03c3Rb+ > \u03c3Na+ > \u03c3Li+ and \u03c3Me4N+ > \u03c3Et4N+ > \u03c3Pr4N+ .\nAn important structural consequence is that the negatively charged surface COwill attract hydrogen bonding from interface water, as shown in Fig. 3(d). Figure 4(b) shows that hydrogen bonding with water has significant impact on CO dimerization. In the absence of water hydrogen bonding, the CO dimerization energy on Cu(100) is 1.03 eV in a simplified charged surface model, and in contrast, it is significantly reduced to 0.61 eV with hydrogen bonding. A further increase in the negative surface charge can reduce the CO dimerization energy even more. Similar results were also observed by Norskov and co-workers [47].Thus, we can propose the Helmholtz capacitance as a key descriptor for measuring the cation effects on the selectivity ofC2+ products, following the order Cs+ >Rb+ >Na+ > Li+ in CO2RR and CORR andMe4N+ > Et4N+ > Pr4N+ inCORR,which agrees well with experiment [7,8,11].The argument is as follows.The cationwith a higher Helmholtz capacitance can result in higher negative surface charge density under the same electrode potential, as well as more hydrogen bonding between surface CO and water. Both contribute to the reductionofCOdimerization energy, facilitating the formation of C2+ products.\nFurthermore, we can connect the microscopic structures of cations with their effects on CO dimerization. For alkali metal ions, the Helmholtz capacitance correlates less with the ion size, but strongly with the ion hydration energy, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Cs+ and Rb+ with low hydration energies can partially desolvate and get closer to the surface (see Fig. 4(a)), leading to a higher Helmholtz capacitance and thus easier CO dimerization. Besides, direct coordination of the ion with surface CO has an additional important effect of decreasing the CO dimerization energy (see Fig. 4(b) for Cs+). On the other hand, for the alkylammonium ions having similar solvation structures at the interface, it is expected that the Helmholtz capacitance inversely relates to the ionic radius, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Thus, a smaller alkylammonium ion will have a higher capacitance and is hence more favorable for CO dimerization. For larger alkylammonium ions,\nPage 7 of 11\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/9/nw ad105/7134097 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\n1110 12 13 14 15 Helmholtz capacitance (\u03bcF/cm2)\nRb+\nLi+\nNa+\nCs+\n-150\n-130\n-110\n-90\n-70\n-50\nH yd\nra tio\nn en\ner gy\n(k ca\nl/m ol ) CO dimerization increases\nMe4N +\nEt4N +\nPr4N +\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nr io n (\n\u00c5 )\n4.2\n3.8\n3.4\n3.0\n2.6\nHelmholtz capacitance (\u03bcF/cm2)\nCO dimerization increases\nFS\n0.00IS\nFr ee\ne ne\nrg y\n(e V\n)\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.03\n0.64 0.61 0.56\n\u20133.5 \u03bcC/cm2 (no H bond) \u20133.5 \u03bcC/cm2 (Cs+ coor) \u20133.5 \u03bcC/cm2 (with H bond) \u20137.0 \u03bcC/cm2 (with H bond)\nHelmholtz layer\nU U U U Electrode (applied U < PZC)\nLi+\nCs+ Cs+ Me4N+\nPr4N+\nFS (Cs+ coor)FS (with H bond)\nFS (no H bond)IS (no H bond)\nCs+\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 4.

Our calculation also shows that the surface charge density and coordination with water and cations can have important effects on the CO dimerization energy, which is a key factor determining the selectivity of C2+ products in CORR and CO2RR. Interestingly, we can use Helmholtz capacitance as the main descriptor to account for EDL differences caused by counter cations, and thus measure the activity of CO dimerization. We believe that our finding offers deeper understanding of cation effects on structures and reactivities of electrified interfaces, which is useful for improving the performance of electrocatalysts."

            "text": "The Pt(111) surface was modeled by a p(4 \u00d7 4) periodic slab with four atomic layers. The surface coverage of adsorbed CO on Pt(111) was set to 3/4 ML, with 1/4 MLs on top sites and 1/2 MLs on hollow sites, forming a (2 \u00d7 2)-3CO adlayer. Both of the two Pt(111) surfaces were adsorbed with CO, and thus there is no net dipole. Enough vacuum region was modeled on top of the Pt(111) surface, and the overall size of the surface model was 11.246 \u00d7 11.246 \u00d7 40 A\u030a3. A neutral Pt(111)COad/water interface was modeled by fully filling the vacuum region in the Pt(111)-COad surface model with water. The density of water in the bulk region was controlled to be \u223c1 g/cm3. EDLs were modeled by introducing cations in the vicinity of the Pt(111)-COad surface. Seven kinds of cations (Li+, Na+, Rb+, Cs+, Me4N+, Et4N+ and Pr4N+) were employed for modeling EDLs at the same surface charge density, \u03c3 = \u221214.6 \u03bcC/cm2. Moreover, to study the effect of interfacial ionic concentration on the double-layer capacitance, two extra Cs+-Cl\u2212 ion pairs were added to the interface model Cs+(1). It should be mentioned that the Gouy-Chapman layers were not included in the modeled interfaces, and thus these EDL models correspond to the high concentration limits, where the surface charges are effectively screened within the Helmholtz layers.\nAIMD simulations for Pt(111)-COad/water interfaces were performed by freely available software CP2K. Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials were used. The Gaussian basis set was double-\u03b6 with one set of polarisation functions [48], and the energy cutoff was set to 400 Ry. The Becke-LeeYang-Parr (BLYP) functional was chosen [49] to describe the exchange-correlation effects in this work. The dispersion energy was corrected with\nGrimmer\u2019s D3method.The second generation CarParrinello molecular dynamics [50] method was used to sample the structures of interface models. The correction step was obtained by five iterations of the orbital transformation optimization, and the integration time for each step was 0.5 fs. The target temperature was set to 330 K. The Langevin friction coefficient (\u03b3 L) was set to 0.001 fs\u22121, and the intrinsic friction coefficients (\u03b3 D) were 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 fs\u22121 for H2O, CO and ions. The Pt slab was fixed during all the MD simulations. Because of the large size of the cells, only the point in the reciprocal space was used in AIMD simulations. For each AIMD simulation, at least 5 ps (10 000 steps) of the trajectory was used to equilibrate the system, and then followed by a production period of 10\u201340 ps."
