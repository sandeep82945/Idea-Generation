1. **Investigate the role of TRAF6 in different diseases:** Explore the specific role of TRAF6 in various diseases, including cancer, inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. This could involve studying the expression levels of TRAF6 in diseased tissues, examining the molecular mechanisms by which TRAF6 contributes to disease progression, and evaluating the potential of TRAF6 inhibitors in treating these diseases.


2. **Develop new TRAF6 inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity:** Design and synthesize novel TRAF6 inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity compared to existing compounds. This could involve modifying the structure of SN-1 or exploring different chemical scaffolds that target the N-terminal region of TRAF6.


3. **Study the structural dynamics of TRAF6 and its interactions with inhibitors:** Use techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural dynamics of TRAF6 and its interactions with inhibitors. This could provide insights into the mechanisms of action of TRAF6 inhibitors and help in the design of more effective compounds.


4. **Evaluate the efficacy of TRAF6 inhibitors in animal models of disease:** Test the efficacy of TRAF6 inhibitors in animal models of disease to assess their potential for treating various disorders. This could involve administering TRAF6 inhibitors to animals with cancer, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, or neurodegenerative disorders and evaluating the effects on disease progression and survival.


5. **Conduct clinical trials of TRAF6 inhibitors in humans:** Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TRAF6 inhibitors in humans with various diseases. This would involve administering TRAF6 inhibitors to patients and monitoring their response to treatment, including assessing changes in disease symptoms, biomarkers, and overall survival.
