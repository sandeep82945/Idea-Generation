"Although all formulated emulgels exhibited good stability, the optimized formulation (AEE8), selected based on preliminary evaluation using the quality by design (QbD) approach, is now eligible for screening for its potential as an anticancer agent. This screening process aims to evaluate its efficacy in inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, or affecting cancer-related pathways. The selection of the optimized formulation for screening signifies its promising characteristics and marks an important step towards assessing its potential as a therapeutic option for cancer treatment."
