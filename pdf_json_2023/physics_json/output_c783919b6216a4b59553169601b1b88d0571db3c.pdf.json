    "abstractText": "The Salvia fruticosa (Mill.) is the most medicinal plant used in Lebanon. The aim of this study is to investigate the phytochemical composition and the biological activities (in vitro) of its extracts. The plant was extracted by cold maceration with four solvents presenting an increasing polarity: cyclohexane (CHX), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanol (MeOH). The extracts were screened for their chemical composition by a HPLC-DAD detector for phenolic compounds identification and quantification and by GC-MS for volatile compounds detection. The antioxidant capacity (DPPH inhibition) was tested. Biological activities, mainly anti-Alzheimer activity (acetylcholinesterase inhibition), the antiproliferation of two human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and Caco-2 cells) and antibacterial activity, were evaluated. Ten aromatic compounds were quantified by HPLC-DAD analysis. A total of 123 compounds were detected by GC-MS analysis. The MeOH extract showed a very interesting antioxidant activity with an inhibition percentage (IP) of 76.1% and an IC50 of 19.4 \u03bcg/mL. The EtOAc extract exhibited the strongest inhibition against the acetylcholinesterase activity (IP = 60.6%) at 50 \u03bcg/mL. It also strongly inhibited the proliferation of the HCT-116 cells (IP = 87.5%), whereas the DCM extract gave the best result with the Caco-2 cells (IP = 72.3%). The best antibacterial activity was obtained with the MeOH extract against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 1.2 \u03bcg/mL) and with the EtOAc extract against Escherichia coli (MIC = 2.4 \u03bcg/mL). This study highlights the chemical composition and therapeutic potential of S. fruticosa. It is important to mention that the following chemical compounds were identified for the first time in plant extracts: 2,6,11,15-tetramethyl-hexadeca-2,6,8,10,14-pentaene; 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroxy-1,8,8,9-tetramethyl8,9-dihydrophenaleno [1,2-b]furan-3-one; podocarpa-1,8,11,13-tetraen-3-one,14-isopropyl-1,13dimethoxy; podocarpa-8,11,13-trien-3-one,12-hydroxy-13-isopropyl-,acetate; 3\u2032,8,8\u2032-trimethoxy-3piperidin-1-yl-2,2\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrone; and 2,3-dehydroferruginol, thus underlining the originality of this study.",

            "text": "In recent decades, due to the excessive need for healthy medications devoid of harmful synthetic and chemical products, there was a growing interest in finding new efficient, nontoxic and natural bioactive compounds. Aromatic and medicinal plants, including Salvia species, are known to have a potent role in the treatment of various illnesses, such as aches, epilepsy, colds, bronchitis, tuberculosis, hemorrhage and menstrual disorders [1]. Although\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2429. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062429 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2429 2 of 18\nthere are around 900 species of Salvia, only a few are commercially important [2]. Particularly, the Salvia fruticosa Miller (S. fruticosa Mill.), also named S. libanotica and formerly S. triloba, belonging to the Lamiaceae family, is an endemic species of the Mediterranean Basin generally and Lebanon specifically. It is also known as the East Mediterranean sage or Lebanese sage and represents most of the imported sage in the United States rather than the S. officinalis [3]. It is considered the most widely used medicinal plant in Lebanon since ancient times [4] and grows at an altitude of 200\u2013400 m [5]. In folk medicine, S. fruticosa aerial parts are used by herbalists and pharmacists, either internally as infusions to treat cold symptoms, mouth and throat inflammation, cough [4] and abdominal pain [6] or applied externally. The essential oils of the Salvia fruticosa were widely investigated and more than 100 volatile compounds were identified in several sage species. They mainly belonged to the classes of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and non-isoprenoid compounds, usually with thujone, camphor and 1,8-cineole as the most dominant ones [7]. Regarding non-volatiles, about 160 polyphenolic compounds were identified from sage plants: flavonoids and their glycosides, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids with characteristic caffeic acid derivatives, such as rosmarinic acid, phenolic diterpenes, such as carnosic acid, and other phenolic glycosides [7,8]. The latter play an important role in the prevention against oxidative damages [5\u20139]. It is very important to draw to the attention that, in the case of thujone, notwithstanding many beneficial effects, the tremendously neurotoxic danger of this volatile organic constituent has been checked out [10]. Conforming to the European Medicines Agency EMA/HMPC (2016), the daily exposure of 6.0 mg (for a 2-week duration) is allowed. Thereby, it is extremely important to control the thujone content in sage and sage-based products. Contrariwise, rosmarinic acid is one of the most useful flavonoids resulting in sage and derivative products, due to its value through anticancer and antioxidant treatments [11]. Moreover, several studies revealed that S. fruticosa essential oils exhibited pharmacological properties, for instance, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antiproliferative activities [12]. Salvia is also known for its use as a culinary herb and an ornamental plant that has a sweet nectar and pollen for pollinators. Economically, it is easily accessible and has an affordable price in the market. In the literature, the medicinal properties of S. fruticosa are often related to volatile compounds in essentials oils. However, the non-volatile compounds can also contribute to the importance of this plant. The primary purpose of this study was to carry out comprehensive research and provide data on the phytochemistry and biological activities of S. fruticosa extracts (CHX, DCM, EtOAc and MeOH) grown in Lebanon. The antioxidant and biological activities of the S. fruticosa were identified in vitro through testing the radical scavenging effects on DPPH, then the capacity of each extract to inhibit the AChE enzyme, the proliferation of HCT-116 and Caco-2 cells, and the antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains."

It is worth mentioning that the detected compounds were found for the first time in S. fruticosa extracts. The amount of compound 10 was the highest in the CHX extract and decreased gradually in the DCM and EtOAc extracts underlining its non-polar character. Polydatin (compound 4), which was found in the EtOAc and MeOH extracts, presented the highest amount in the MeOH extract, which underlines its polarity. These results are in agreement with those obtained with the TPC determination. The MeOH extract presented the highest TPC mainly because of the presence of polydatin, which was the most abundant phenolic compound detected by HPLC-DAD.\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n7.00 1 - Salvia-cyclo 20.0 mg/ml UV_VIS_2mAU\n1\nWVL:280 nm\n0.0\n20.0\n40.0\n70.0 2 - Salvia-Dichloro- 20.0 mg/ml UV_VIS_2mAU\n2\nWVL:280 nm\n0\n100\n200\n350 3 - Salvia-Acetate 20 mg/ml UV_VIS_2mAU\n3\nWVL:280 nm\n0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 17.5 20.0 22.5 25.0 27.5 30.0 32.5 35.0 37.5 40.0 42.5 45.0 47.5 50.0 52.5 55.0 57.5 60.0 62.5 65.0 0\n500\n1,000\n1,600 4 - Salvia- Methanol 20.0 mg/ml UV_VIS_2mAU\nmin4\nWVL:280 nm\nCHX\nDCM\nEtOAc\n1 2\n3\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nFigure 3.

This is the first study that analyzes the volatile compounds of the S. fruticosa organic extracts. It is important to mention that this research has allowed us to reveal, for the first time, the presence of the following molecules in plants extracts: 2,6,11,15-tetramethyl-hexadeca-2,6,8,10,14-pentaene (30); 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroxy-1,8,8, 9-tetramethyl-8,9-dihydrophenaleno[1,2-b]furan-3-one (38); podocarpa-1,8,11,13-tetraen3-one, 14-isopropyl-1,13-dimethoxy- (40); podocarpa-8,11,13-trien-3-one, 12-hydroxy-13isopropyl-, acetate (41); 3\u2032,8,8\u2032-trimethoxy-3-piperidin-1-yl-2,2\u2032-binaphthyl-1,1\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrone (45); and 2,3-dehydroferruginol (33\u2032). Some molecules were found for the first time in S. fruticosa and were the following: 4-terpineol (4); humalane-1,6-dien-3-ol (36); (+/\u2212)- demethylsalvicanol (46); 12-O-methylcarnosol (49); \u03b2-eudesmol (5\u2032); cuminyl alcohol (7\u2032); androstenediol (35\u2032); kolavenol (36\u2032); 6,7-dihyroferruginol (38\u2032); 2-palmitoglycerol (40\u2032); 2-monostearin (48\u2032); monoolein (49\u2032); 2-monolinolenin (51\u2032); cytosine (54\u2032); campesterol (55\u2032); germanicol (58); \u03b1-amyrin (59\u2032); and micromeric acid (65\u2032). Some volatile compounds detected in the extracts of this study were previously found in the EO of many Salvia species.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2429 10 of 18\nFor instance, camphor (12), \u03b2-pinene (4) and caryophyllene oxide (25) were detected in the EO of S. lavandulaefolia [16]. Camphene (2), p-cymene (5), \u03b1-thujone (9), \u03b2-thujone (11), endo-borneol (14), terpinen-4-ol (16), \u03b2-caryophyllene (19) and viridiflorol (26) were found in the EO of the African S. officinalis [17]. Some alkanes, such as heptacosane (51) and octacosane (52), were detected in the EO of the Salvia hierosolymitana Boiss growing wild in Lebanon [18]. Furthermore, uvaol (58), betulin (61), oleanolic acid (63\u2032) and ursolic acid (64\u2032) were previously found in the 70% acetone-water extract of the S. officinalis and the rosmarinic acid (60\u2032) was found in the S. officinalis, S. limbata, S. virgata, S. hypoleuca, S. macrosiphon and S. choloroleuca [19]. As shown in Table 2, some compounds existed in two or three extracts, such as the 2-monopalmitin (45) and carnosol (45\u2032). This behavior is attributed to the extraction process intended to soften and break the plant\u2019s cell walls in order to release the soluble phytochemicals. The amount of each compound will then depend on its affinity to each organic solvent, mainly on its polarity and solubility."

            "text": "The antiradical activity of the aerial part of the S. fruticosa organic extracts was assessed and compared with the standard ascorbic acid (IC50 = 4 \u00b5g/mL). The concentration of the extracts was adjusted to 50 \u00b5g/mL. As listed in Table 3, it can be stated that the strongest inhibition of DPPH was obtained with the MeOH extract (76.1%) with an IC50 value of 19.4 \u00b5g/mL. It was followed by the EtOAc extract, which showed an inhibition percentage of 20.9%, then the DCM extract with 6.5% and finally no inhibition was registered with the CHX extract.\nThe strongest DPPH inhibition was obtained with the MeOH extract. Several authors tested the capacity of the MeOH extracts of many Libyan, Turkish and Iranian Salvia species to quench the DPPH free radical and found that the IC50 values were as follows: S. fruticosa, IC50 = 36.37 \u00b5g/mL; S. multicaulis, IC50 = 386.9 \u00b5g/mL, S. viridis, IC50 = 570 \u00b5g/mL [20]; and S. macrosiphon, IC50 = 2743.05 \u00b5g/mL [21]. Interestingly, the concentrations were, respectively, 9, 97, 142 and 686 times higher than those obtained with the MeOH extract of the current study (IC50 = 19.4 \u00b5g/mL). El Boukhary et al. assessed the ability of S. fruticosa MeOH extracts prepared from the roots and the aerial parts to inhibit DPPH. The inhibition percentages obtained were 32.16 and 41.5%, respectively, and were 2.37 and 1.83 times less effective than the MeOH extract of the current study (76.1%) [3]. Moreover, the capacity of the MeOH extract to inhibit the DPPH was 3.3 times less effective than that of the ascorbic acid (19.4 vs. 4.0 \u00b5g/mL). Nevertheless, the antioxidant activity of the methanolic extract was significant and resulted from the presence of several molecules in the extract. The fractioning and separation of these molecules may give more interesting IC50 values than those obtained with the ascorbic acid. The high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.92) between the phenolic content of the extracts and their corresponding antioxidant activity confirmed that the phenolic compounds were the main components responsible for the antioxidant activity of the S. fruticosa extracts. The MeOH extract, which exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, contained, per gram of extract, 0.3 mg of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid;\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2429 11 of 18\n74.3 mg of polydatin; and 0.1 mg of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-phenylcoumarine (Table 1). It also contained salvianolic acid A (22\u2032); 2,3-dehydroferruginol (33\u2032); and rosmarinic acid (60\u2032) (Table 2). These molecules may have worked synergistically in order to give a good inhibition. In the EtOAc extract, the presence of phenol, 2,2\u2032-methylenebis 6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)4-methyl-(43); 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (9\u2032); and 2-palmitoyl glycerol (40\u2032) that have a labile proton may have contributed to the quenching of the DPPH free radical (Table 2). The CHX and DCM extracts showed a poor antioxidant activity. However, some of their chemical compounds may have inhibited the DPPH free radical, such as the \u03b2-sitosterol (IC50 = 140 \u00b5g/mL) [22], caryophillene oxide (IC50 = 84.0 \u00b5g/mL [23]), carnosol (IC50 = 0.59 \u00b5M [24]) and carnosic acid (IC50 = 60 \u00b5M) [24]. The lupeol (56) was previously shown to exhibit a good antioxidant behavior. In fact, it quenched the DPPH free radical by 50.0% at 70 \u00b5g/mL [25]."

The results were compared to that of the standard GaHbr. As shown in Table 3, a similar inhibition percentage was registered for the CHX (59.5%), DCM (60.5%) and EtOAc (60.6%) extracts. Although the MeOH extract presented the lowest inhibition with 52.46%, it was not significantly different from the previous ones (p > 0.05). This behavior against the AChE enzyme could be attributed to many molecules that are present in the samples. Ayaz et al. proved that the \u03b2-sitosterol exhibited a considerable AChE inhibition with an IC50 value of 55 \u00b5g/mL. This compound was present in the non-polar CHX and DCM extracts (55-Table 2) [22]. Savelev et al. isolated the (\u2212)-\u03b2-pinene (4-Table 2), the caryophyllene oxide (26-Table 2) and the (\u2212)-camphor (12-Table 2) from S. lavandulaefolia EO [16]. These compounds were also found in the S. fruticosa CHX and/or DCM extracts. The (\u2212)-\u03b2-pinene inhibited the AChE activity with an IC50 value of 0.2 mg/mL, while the camphor reduced its activity by 39.0% at 0.5 mg/mL. Recently, Karakaya et al. proved that the caryophyllene oxide isolated from Salvia verticillata subsp. Amasiaca EO presented a good anti-AChE potency since it reduced the enzyme activity by 41.4% at 200 \u00b5g/mL. It can be concluded from the previous data that the anti-AChE activity of the extracts resulted from complex interactions, both synergistic and antagonistic, between their terpene constituents [23].\n2.6.2. MTT Assay for the Measurement of the Antiproliferation Activity\nThe antiproliferation activity of the S. fruticosa extracts prepared at 50 \u00b5g/mL was tested on two lines of cancer cells: Caco-2 and HCT-116. The tamoxifen was used as a positive control. The highest growth inhibition of the Caco-2 cells was registered with the DCM extract (72.3%), followed by the EtOAc extract (62.1%), whereas the highest inhibition of the HCT-116 cells was recorded with the EtOAc extract (87.5%), followed by the DCM extract (70.7%) (Table 3). The CHX extract was not active at all, while the MeOH extract only reduced the growth of the HCT-116 cells by 7.2% (p \u2264 0.05). Therefore, the S. fruticosa extracts were more active against the proliferation of the HCT-116 cells than the Caco-2 ones. The American National Cancer Institute (NCI) considered that the extracts with an IC50 < 30 \u00b5g/mL had a promising cytotoxic activity (Suffness, 1990), which is the case of the DCM and EtOAc extracts of the current study (Table 3) [25]. Duletic\u0301-Lau\u0161evic\u0301 et al. tested the antiproliferation activity of the Libyan S. fruticosa- EtOH extract against the HCT-116 cells and found that it was able to reduce their growth with an IC50 of 375.96 \u00b5g/mL [14]. The obtained value was 25.7 times higher than the one recorded with the EtOAc extract (14.6 \u00b5g/mL) of the current study. The latter gave the best antiproliferation activity and showed a promising anticancer application. Polydatin was found to inhibit the growth of Caco-2 cells and gave an IC50 of 74.9 \u00b5g/mL [26]. This compound was present in the EtOAc extract that presented an IC50 of 31.1 \u00b5g/mL when tested against the same cancer cell line. Therefore, polydatin may have contributed to the antiproliferation activity\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2429 12 of 18\nof the EtOAc extract along with other compounds leading to a better result than when tested alone.\n2.6.3. Antimicrobial Activity Assay\nThe four S. fruticosa extracts were tested individually for their capacity to inhibit the growth of seven foodborne pathogenic bacterial strains including four Gram-negative and three Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained are displayed in Table 4.\n\u201c-\u201d: no inhibition. Results are the means (\u00b1SD) of two independent analyses. Different letters mean significant differences between the values obtained with the same extract tested on different bacterial strains according to Tukey\u2019s test (p \u2264 0.05).\nThe DCM extract significantly inhibited the growth of S. Kentucky (MIC = 19.5 \u00b5g/mL) and moderately that of L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (MIC = 78.1 \u00b5g/mL). The MeOH extract showed an important antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 8739 with very low MIC values of 1.2 and 2.4 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the EtOAc extract against E. coli was the same as for the MeOH one (same MIC value of 2.4 \u00b5g/mL). The EtOAc extract also showed a moderate activity against L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (MIC = 39 \u00b5g/mL). Duletic\u0301-Lau\u0161evic\u0301 et al. tested the antimicrobial activity of a Libyan S. fruticosa extract (EtOH and water) against E. coli, S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes and found MIC values of 1500, 1500, 1000 and 1000 \u00b5g/mL, respectively [14]. When comparing these values to the best MIC values obtained in the current study against the same bacterial species, we find that the MIC values of this study were, respectively, 625, 19.21, 833 and 208 times lower than those found in the literature, underlining the important antibacterial activity of our extracts. However, we should take into consideration that the extraction solvents used, the geographical origin and the bacterial strains were not the same. Based on the study conducted by Kosov\u00e1 et al., the EtOAc extract\u2019s behavior could be explained by the presence of the 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (9\u2032-Table 2) considered a preservative [27]. This acid was shown to inhibit the growth of S. aureus and E. coli at 20 mmol/l. The extracts of the current study exhibited a bacteriostatic activity against some of the bacterial strains tested, while some others, mainly Gram + ones, were not affected. This can be explained by the presence of resistance mechanisms in these strains [28]."

The Gram-positive strains were Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 and Listeria monocytogenes isolated from \u201cfish-filet\u201d at the LARI. A bacterial suspension of each bacterial strain was prepared in a Mueller\u2013Hinton Broth (MHB) at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL (0.5 McFarland standard) [30]. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the Salvia fruticosa extracts were determined by serial dilution in a 96-well microplate. Each well first contained 100 \u00b5L of MHB. The dried extracts were dissolved in pure DMSO to a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Then, the extract solutions were half-diluted with MHB to obtain a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Afterwards, 100 \u00b5L of the latter were placed in the first well and a serial dilution was conducted in order to obtain the following concentrations in each row: 1250, 625, 312.5, 156.2, 78.1, 39, 19.5, 9.7, 4.8, 2.4 and 1.2 \u00b5g/mL. Next, 100 \u00b5L of each bacterial strain tested were added to the extract solutions. Therefore, the initial bacterial concentration was adjusted to 108 CFU/mL in each well. The negative control was composed of 100 \u00b5L of DMSO and 100 \u00b5L of the bacterial strain tested while the positive control contained 100 \u00b5L of MHB and 100 \u00b5L of the bacterial strain.
