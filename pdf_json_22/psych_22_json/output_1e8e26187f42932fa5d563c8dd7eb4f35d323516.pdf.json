Urban lives are exposed to a a wide array of 48 environmental factors that may combine and interact to influence mental health. While 49 individual factors of the urban environment have been investigated in isolation, to date 50 no attempt has been made to model how the complex, real life exposure to living in the 51 city relates to brain and mental illness, and how it is moderated by genetic factors. Using 52 data of over 150,000 participants of the UK Biobank, we carried out sparse canonical 53 correlation analyses (sCCA) to investigate the relation of urban living environment with 54 symptoms of mental illness. We found three mental health symptom groups, consisting 55 of affective, anxiety and emotional instability symptoms, respectively. These groups 56 were correlated with distinct profiles of urban environments defined by risk factors 57 related to social deprivation, air pollution and urban density, and protective factors 58 involving green spaces and generous land use. The relations between environment and 59 symptoms of mental illness were mediated by the volume of brain regions involved in 60 reward processing, emotional processing and executive control, and moderated by 61 genes regulating stress response, neurotransmission, neural development and 62 differentiation, as well as epigenetic modifications. Together, these findings indicate 63 distinct biological pathways by which different environmental profiles of urban living 64 may influence mental illness. Our results also provide a quantitative measure of the 65 contribution of each environmental factor to brain volume and symptom group. They 66\nwill aid in targeting and prioritizing important decisions for planning and public health 67 interventions. 68\n69\nIntroduction 70\nMore than 50% of the world population lives in an urban area, and it is estimated 71 that by 2050, two-thirds of the world population will live in cities1. This dramatic 72 increase in urbanization means that living environments are going through drastic 73 transformations: Lives in urban areas are led in increasingly higher density residential 74 and commercial buildings1, concomitant reduced access to green areas2, increased 75 exposures to potentially harmful substances3 and more stressful social conditions4. At 76 the same time urbans residents potentially benefit from better infrastructure and more 77 work opportunities than rural dwellers1. 78\nThe impact of the urban living environment on mental health, is not well 79 understood. Thus far there is evidence of urban-rural differences in the prevalence of 80 psychiatric disorders5, and recent research has confirmed that individuals living in 81 urban environments are at a higher risk of experiencing various mental health issues. 82 The most prevalent of these issues are increased emotional problems, including 83 symptoms of depression and anxiety5-8. In addition to the investigation of a general and 84 complex environmental factor as urbanicity, there have been investigations of isolated 85 environmental factors relevant to urban living, such as greenspaces 9,10, socio-economic 86 status11 and others12. But these isolated factors have not been considered in the wider 87\nenvironmental context that characterises a living environment. In order to develop 88 targeted prevention and intervention programmes ranging from urban planning to 89 individual psychosocial coping programmes, it is neither sufficient to regard urbanicity 90 as one risk factor, nor is it sufficient to focus on single isolated environmental factors 91 alone. The urban environment, as any other living environment, is composed of 92 simultaneous interacting factors, which may form profiles or signatures that together 93 can reduce or increase risk for mental illness13,14. 94\nThe relation of symptoms of mental illness and brain structure with the exposure 95 to environmental profiles of multiple factors composing a living environment are 96 currently unknown, either in urban settings or otherwise. Furthermore, exposure to 97 environmental adversity does not result in a uniform response, but individual 98 differences have been well documented15. Genetic variations are known to be one 99 important source of such individual differences16. In fact, activity of biological 100 pathways, such as the stress response pathway or epigenetic modifications that are 101 known mediators of the effect of stressful environmental stimuli on brain and mental 102 illness have been shown to vary depending on particular genotypes17. 103\nIn this paper, we identify environmental profiles of urban living and relate them 104 to groups of mental illness symptoms. We aim to understand what combinations of 105 environmental profiles are most relevant for these emotional problems, and how within 106 these combinations each single factor contributes to risk or resilience. We also identify 107 regional brain areas that mediate the effect of different environmental profiles on 108\nmental illness symptoms groups. To discover moderators that may underlie individual 109 differences in response to adverse environmental profiles, we investigate genetic 110 variations derived from genome-wide analyses of symptoms of mental illness and test 111 them for moderation of the regional brain volumes correlated to environmental 112 adversity. To this end, we carried out four analysis steps: (1) a two-way sparse 113 canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) to identify environmental profiles and their 114 related symptom groups of mental illness. (2) a genome-wide association study (GWAS) 115 of the symptom groups identified, followed by the computation of gene scores of 116 GWAS-significant genes. (3) a three-way multiple-sparse canonical correlation 117 analysis (msCCA) relating urban living environmental profiles and symptom groups 118 with regional brain volume. (4) a moderated mediation analysis to characterize the 119 mediation of environmental profiles and symptom groups by regional brain volume, 120 and its moderation by gene scores (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). 121\nResults 122\nOverview of analyses 123\nOur analyses were carried out in participants of UK Biobank, a large and 124 predominantly urban population-based cohort. A subset of 156,375 participants that 125 were assessed for both, 21 mental symptoms measures as well as 128 environmental 126 variables linked to their home address. These environmental variables included air and 127 sound pollution, traffic, greenspace and coastal proximity, socioeconomic indices of 128 multiple deprivation (IMD), building class, destination accessibility, land use density, 129\nterrain, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and street network accessibility. 130 The participants from UK Biobank -Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (UK-131 BUMP), with complete urban living environmental data and mental health data 132 (n=156,375) were divided into datasets without neuroimaging data (n= 141,325, UKB-133 nonNI) and with neuroimaging data (n=15,050, UKB-NI). At the time of our analyses, 134 brain neuroimaging was ascertained in 42,796 participants, of which 15,050 had 135 complete neuroimaging, mental health and environmental assessments (Supplementary 136 methods). 137\nWe apply a training and test data split design to investigate the relation of urban 138 living environment with symptoms of mental illness using sparse canonical correlation 139 analysis (sCCA), a multivariate analysis technique to determine multivariate 140 associations between two or more sets of variables. First, we characterise the 141 environmental profiles associated with groups of mental health symptoms using a 142 classical (binary) sCCA. Following a GWAS analysis, we infer a set of genes scores 143 associated with these symptoms groups. Next, using a multi-view sparse CCA 144 (msCCA), we identify the regional brain volumes jointly associated with environment 145 and mental health. We then describe the directionality of this relationship using a 146 moderated mediation analysis. Throughout the analysis we were careful to retain a strict 147 training-test separation to avoid bias. Demographic information on the specific 148 statistical analysis is shown in Table 1. Schematic summaries are shown in Figure 1 149 and Supplementary Figure 1. 150\nand its genetic moderation in 8,726 participants with complete genomic, environment, 167 brain volume and mental health data in UKB-NI. 168\n169\nCorrelation of urban living environment with symptoms of mental illness. 170\nA total of 53 urban living environment catgories including 128 items were 171 included in this study. In the 53 categories, there were 34 categories having one 172 independent item. In the remaining 19 categories, given that some items of each 173 category examined similar aspects of urban environment, ten fold cross-validation 174 confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to collapse the available information 175 into 19 latent urban living environmental categories using the R package lavaan 176 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan)18. Ten-fold cross-validation splits 177 were performed to ensure unbiased estimates of generalizability throughout the analytic 178 pipeline and to optimize the CFA models. To investigate the relation of urban living 179 environment with symptoms of mental illness, we used sCCA regression to link 53 180 independent urban living environment categories and 21 prospective symptoms of 181 mental illness (see Online Methods). To avoid overestimating the variance shared 182 between urban living environment and symptoms of mental illness, we used a split data 183 analysis design, which allows us to estimate effect sizes in an unbiased way. We carried 184 out model selection in a training dataset of 90% of the data (n = 127,134), and model 185 validation in the testing dataset of the remaining 10% (n = 14,132) in the 141,326 186 participants of the UKB-nonNI dataset. To enhance stability, we resampled the data 187\nand retained only variables that contributed to the model in 90% of resamples (Methods 188 and Supplementary Figure 1)19. 189\nUsing msCCA regression, we found a significant relationship between urban 190 living environment profiles and a subset of five symptoms of mental illness in the 191 training dataset (r=0.22, Ppermutation<0.001), explaining 4.84% of the variance. The 192 model was also significant when applied to the test dataset (r = 0.19, Ppermutation<0.001, 193 PFDR<0.001) explaining 3.61% of the variance between environment profiles and 194 symptoms groups of mental illness (Figure 1). These symptoms of mental illness consist 195 of a group of five self-reported symptoms, namely frequency of unenthusiasm, 196 frequency of tiredness, loneliness, frequency of depressed mood and fed-up feelings 197 (Figure 2), which we summarised as the affective symptom group. This symptom group 198 is positively correlated with IMD score, air and noise pollution, measures of street 199 accessibility and neighbourhood walkability (street radial and centrality), traffic and 200 density of urban infrastructures (factories, retails, offices and community services), 201 while being negatively correlated with percentage of domestic garden, natural 202 environment and greenspace, and distance to urban facilities (community services, 203 factories, emergency, education, food stores, community and healthcare) 204 (Supplementary Table 5 and Figure 2). We assessed robustness in two ways, first we 205 used bootstrapping to resample the training data (with replacement) 1000 times, each 206 containing 10% to 150% of the training dataset in 10% increments. Then, we performed 207 a second validation by drawing 1000 resamples of the training dataset, each containing 208 90% of the dataset (Supplementary Table 6 and Figure 2). No specific gender effect 209\nwas detected (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table 7). Our results indicate 210 that the affective symptom group is positively correlated with an environment profile 211 dominated by high degrees of social deprivation and air pollution, and to a lesser extent 212 traffic and short distance to infrastructural facilities. Other properties of urbanicity, in 213 particular various forms of green space and social infrastructure appear to be protective 214 in this model. 215\nAfter determining the significance of the first canonical correlate, we removed the 216 effect of the first set of canonical vectors by projection deflation, as we have done 217 previously19. This approach is more appropriate for regularised CCA than standard 218 deflation methods more commonly used in the field20 because it ensures that the 219 predictions for successive components are orthogonal (i.e. uncorrelated). This is also 220 important to keep in mind in order to correctly interpret our findings (e.g. the GWAS 221 analysis we report below) because the second canonical variables relate to covariance 222 between datasets that is orthogonal to the first set of canonical variables, as is also the 223 case in standard CCA. In other words, the second CCA component explains covariance 224 over and above what is explained by the first component. We then repeated the analysis 225 to investigate the presence of a second canonical correlation between the remaining 226 urban living environment and mental health variables. Here, we identified another 227 mental illness symptoms consisting of six self-report measures, including worrying too 228 long, anxious feelings, nervous feelings, nerves, tense and suffering from nerves 229 (Figure 2), summarised as the anxiety symptom group, which was significantly 230 associated with the environmental profile in the training dataset (r = 0.15, 231\nPpermutation<0.001). The test sample correlation is also significant (r = 0.12, 232 Ppermutation<0.001, PFDR<0.001), explaining 1.44% of the variance between 233 environmental profile and anxiety symptom group. This symptom group was positively 234 correlated with measures of urban morphology, including density of leisure places, 235 street accessibility and neighbourhood walkability (street network detour and shape) 236 (Supplementary methods and Supplementary Table 2-3), mean terrain, Euclidean 237 distance to coast, variation of NDVI and density of mixed urban infrastructure 238 (residential, transport, utility, animal centre, storage land and agriculture, et.ac) while 239 being negatively correlated with mean NDVI, distance to waste and energy as well as 240 percentage of water (Supplementary Table 5 and Figure 2). The second environmental 241 correlate captures a different urban profile, one that is dominated by green spaces and 242 long distances to waste and energy facilities as well as presence of water, all of which 243 are inversely correlated (protective) to symptoms of anxiety. The anxiety symptom 244 group is also positively correlated with signs of denser urban build-up, such as density 245 of streets and leisure places as well as urban regions with mixed residential, commercial 246 and industrial use. 247\nWe removed the effects of the second canonical correlate and investigated the 248 presence of a third canonical correlation between the remaining urban living 249 environment and symptoms of mental illness. Here, the correlation coefficient between 250 two canonical variables was 0.12 in the training dataset (Ppermutation<0.001) and 0.10 in 251 the test dataset (Ppermutation<0.001, PFDR<0.001), explaining variance of 1.44% and 252 1.00%, respectively. The canonical mental health correlate consists of nine symptoms 253\nincluding feeling guilty, frequency of tenseness, miserableness, mood swings, 254 neuroticism score, risk taking, irritability and sensitivity, hurt feelings, illness, injury, 255 bereavement or stress in last 2 years (Figure 2), which we termed the emotional 256 instability symptom group. This symptom group is positively correlated with density 257 of education facilities, variation of terrain, building class (flats in highrisers, terraced 258 houses etc.), measures of street accessibility and neighbourhood walkability (street 259 network link characteristics), density of accommodation, medical and emergency 260 facilities, while being negatively correlated with density of unused land, density of 261 water, open space, amenity, park, allotment and information stations as well as distance 262 to food store. 263\nWe independently replicated these correlations in the UKB-NI dataset (n=15,050) 264 by applying the same sCCA split data (90%/10%) with a resampling threshold of 90%. 265 The replication analysis yielded three statistically significant canonical correlates in the 266 training and test datasets, which were identical to those of the primary analyses. In the 267 first affective symptoms group, the canonical correlation was 0.20 in the training 268 dataset (n=13,545; Ppermutation<0.001) and 0.16 in test dataset (n=1,505; Ppermutation<0.001, 269 PFDR<0.001), in the second anxiety symptoms group, the correlation coefficient was 270 0.10 in the training dataset (Ppermutation<0.001) and 0.08 in the test dataset 271 (Ppermutation<0.001, PFDR<0.001). In the third emotional instability symptoms group the 272 correlation coefficient between two canonical variables was 0.06 in the training dataset 273 (Ppermutation<0.001) and 0.04 in the test dataset (Ppermutation<0.0039, PFDR =0.0273) 274 (Supplementary Table 8). 275\n276\ninstability symptoms group (r=0.12, Ppermutation<0.001). These results were still 284 significant in test datasets of affective (r=0.19, Ppermutation<0.001), anxiety (r=0.12, 285 Ppermutation<0.001) and emotional instability symptoms group (r=0.10, 286 Ppermutation<0.001). c. An example of correlation map between urban environment 287 profile and affective symptoms group in train dataset (r=0.22, Ppermutation<0.001) and 288 test dataset (r=0.19, Ppermutation<0.001). d. In the first (top), second (medium) and third 289 (bottom) correlates, urban living environment profiles contributing to this relationship 290 were shown on the left, symptoms group of mental illness contributing to this 291 relationship were shown on the right.

Left: 293 We used bootstrapping to resample the training data (with replacement) 1000 times, 294 each containing 10% to 150% of the training dataset in 10% increments Stability in 295 correlation coefficient after about 30% of the sample size were observed; Right: To 296 estimate of the stability of the findings across subsamples, we resampled the same 297 proportion 90% of original sample size as train dataset for 1000 times, reran the sCCA 298 algorithm and calculated the correlation between the resulting feature in the remaining 299 10% test dataset.

To reduce 310 dimensionality, we generated scores for each of the genes where significant SNPs were 311 localised (see Supplementary methods). The score of each gene is calculated as the sum 312 of the count of risk alleles multiplied by the corresponding beta value from GWAS 313 across the index SNPs of each clump after adjusting for linkage disequilibrium (see 314 Supplementary methods). These gene scores were then analysed for moderation of the 315 relation of environment, regional brain volume and symptoms group of mental illness 316 (see below). 317\nFor the affective symptom group, we found 2,983 significant associations with 318 SNPs at Bonferroni Pc<0.05 (uncorrected P<0.05/139,187,27/3=1.20 \u00d7 10-9, 319 Supplementary Table 9), located in 43 genes. The lambda genomic control inflation 320 factor was 1.0195 and the intercept value in linkage disequilibrium score regression 321 (LDSC) was 1.011, indicating that population stratification was minimal in this study 322 and did not cause significant inflation to the test statistics. By far the strongest 323 association with the affective symptom group was found in a genomic region of 324\nchromosome 17q21.3 spanning from position 43487217 to 44862162 (hg19), the site 325 of a human supergene candidate that encodes several genes previously implicated in 326 mental illness (Figure 3)22. The lead SNP was rs62062288, located in intron 6 of 327 microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene of chromosome 17 (P=6.09\u00d710-15), a 328 gene that encodes Tau protein in neurons and has been shown to be involved in affective 329 symptoms23, alcohol disorders24 as well as risk taking behaviour25. In the same region 330 of chromosome 17q21.3, we also found strong association of the affective symptom 331 group with Corticotrophin Release Hormone Receptor 1 (CRHR1, a critical regulatory 332 gene for neuroendocrinological and behavioural stress response26 as well as alcohol use 333 disorders27,28). The remaining top associated genes were also encoded in this region. 334 They include ARL17B (ADP ribosylation factor-like GTPase17B, potentially regulating 335 G-protein signalling29), KANSL1 (KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit1, part of a 336 histone acetyltransferase complex, an epigenetic regulator30), and MAPT-AS1 (MAPT 337 antisense RNA 1, involved in progression of tau pathology in neurodegeneration31), as 338 well as a pseudogene RP11-259G18 (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 9). Additional 339 associations were found on genomic region of chromosome 18q21.2, at the DCC gene 340 locus (DCC Netrin 1 Receptor, regulates synaptic plasticity32 and neuronal migration33) 341 and TCF4 gene locus (transcription factor 4, involved in neural differentiation34), 342 chromosome 14q24.1 (DCAF5 and EXD2 gene locus) and chromosome 3q22 (STAG1 343 and a pseudogene RP11-102M11.2). Bioinformatics analyses of the 43 genes using 344 TopGene revealed enrichment of neuronal differentiation, regulation of axogenesis and, 345 importantly, CRH-binding and activity (Supplementary Table 12). We then calculated 346\n43 genes scores. The relationship between urban living environment profile and 347 affective symptom group have shown different vulnerabilies depending on the genetic 348 background. For example, we found that participants with lower CRHR1 gene scores 349 demonstrate smaller correlation of urban environment profile with the affective 350 symptom group compared to those with higher CRHR1 genes scores (Figure 3). 351\nWe found significant associations of the anxiety symptom group with 29 SNPs 352 covering 11 genes at Bonferroni Pc<0.05 (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary 353 Figure 2). The drop in genome-wide significant hits compared to the affective symptom 354 group GWAS is likely caused by the decreased covariance of the second CCA correlate, 355 the anxiety symptom group, following deflation of the correlates of the first CCA 356 correlate, the affective symptom group, as described above. The lead SNP associated 357 with the anxiety symptom group was rs77641763 located in the intron 15 of 358 Exonuclease 3'-5' Domain Containing 3 (EXD3) gene of chromosome 9 (P=4.08\u00d710-359 10). EXD3, involved in nucleic acid binding and widely expressed in the brain, has been 360 associated with a group of anxiety, phobic and dissociative disorders35. The other top 361 significant genes include NOLC1 (Nucleolar And Coiled-Body Phosphoprotein 1), a 362 chaperone for shuttling between the nucleolus and cytoplasm36,37, ELOVL3 (Elongation 363 of very long chain fatty acids protein 3, provides precursors for synthesis of 364 sphingolipids and ceramides38), LBX1-AS1 (Ladybird homeobox 1- antisense RNA 1, 365 involved in neuronal determination processes39), PITX3 (Paired Like Homeodomain 3, 366 regulates differentiation and maintenance of midbrain dopamine neurons during 367 development40), GBF1 (Golgi Brefeldin A Resistant Guanine Nucleotide Exchange 368\nFactor 1, involved in axonal neuropathy41), CNNM2 (Cyclin And CBS Domain 369 Divalent Metal Cation Transport Mediator 2, linked to neurodevelopmental 370 impairments42) and NT5C2 (cytosolic 5\u2032-nucleotidase II, regulating AMPK signalling 371 and protein translation during early neurodevelopment43) (Supplementary Table 10). 372 The 11 genes associated with the anxiety symptom group were enriched for small 373 nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex binding involved in serotonin receptor 374 regulation (Supplementary Table 12). And participants with lower EXD3 gene scores 375 demonstrate smaller correlation of urban environment profile with the anxiety symptom 376 group compared to those with higher EXD3 genes scores (Figure 3). 377\nIn the emotional instability symptom group, there were 6 significant genetic 378 associations at Bonferroni Pc<0.05 (Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary 379 Figure 2). The lead SNP was rs77786116 located in Intraflagellar Transport 74 (IFT74) 380 gene of chromosome 9 (P=4.16\u00d710-10). ITF74 is a critical factor in neuronal migration, 381 a cause for Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Joubert syndrome44,45 and is associated with 382 paranoid schizophrenia46. The other significant genes include TMPO (thymopoietin, 383 involves in neuron proliferation), LDHC (lactate dehydrogenase C, involved in 384 anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis), SLC9A7P1 (solute carrier family 9 member 7 385 pseudogene 1). Together, they are enriched for cerebellar granular layer development 386 process (Supplementary Table 12). 387\nWe independently replicated the SNPs that in the discovery GWAS were 388 significantly associated with symptom groups of mental illness (UKB-nonNI dataset) 389\nin a dataset of 8,726 participants of UKB-NI. The significance threshold was 390 Bonferroni Pc<0.05 (uncorrected P<0.05/3018, the numbers of all significant SNPs 391 from discovery GWAS analysis). Of these 3018 significant SNPs from GWAS analysis 392 of mental illness symptom groups, we replicated in the independent UKB-NI dataset 393 2034 SNPs associated with the affective symptom group, 18 SNPs associated with the 394 anxiety symptom group and 3 SNPs associated with the emotional instability symptom 395 group (Supplementary Table 13-15). We then calculated the corresponding genes 396 scores as before and validated the associations between genes scores and symptoms 397 group of mental illness in the UKB-NI dataset. Of 43 genes scores associated with 398 affective symptom group in the discovery analysis, we replicated 36 genes in the 399 replication analysis, the top ten associated genes including MAPT, CRHR1, DCC, 400 DND1P1, KANSL1, PLEKHM1, RP11-363J20.1:EXD2, STAG1, C5orf17 and DCAF5. 401 Of 11 genes scores in the anxiety symptom group, we replicated 6 genes, including 402 EXD3, LBX1-AS1, NT5C2, GBF1, NOLC1 and CNNM2. Of 6 genes scores associated 403 with emotional instability symptom, we replicated 3 genes including LDHC, IFT74 and 404 TMPO (Supplementary Table 15). 405\nThe lambda genomic control inflation factor of 1.0195 and intercept value in LDSC of 415 1.011, which indicate that population stratification was minimal in this study to cause 416 significant inflation to the test statistics. b.

Gene-set enrichment analysis of affective 432 symptom group-associated 43 genes. Top: Tissue-specific expression analysis showed 433 affective symptom group associated 43 genes were significantly overexpressed in 434 brain and pituitary tissues. Bottom: In the 43 genes associated with the symptom group, 435 we found over-representation in the molecular function of CRH receptor activity (FDR 436\nqc = 4.37 \u00d7 10\u22124) and CRF receptor activity (FDR qc = 4.37 \u00d7 10\u22124); CRH, 437 corticotropin-releasing hormone; CRF, corticotropin-releasing factor; GWAS, 438 genome-wide association analysis; lambda GC, lambda genomic control inflation 439 factor. 440\n441\nBrain volume changes underlying the associations between urban living 442 environment and symptom groups of mental illness 443\nTo further investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the associations 444 of urban living environment with mental symptoms groups, we carried out msCCA on 445 the urban living environment profiles, brain volume measures and symptoms group of 446 mental illness. This analysis was conducted in an independent dataset of 15,050 UKB 447 participants, split in a training dataset (90%) and a test dataset (10%). We found 13 448 regional brain volumes significantly associated with the first urban environmental 449 profile and the affective symptom group (r=0.052, Ppermutaiton=0.01 in training dataset; 450 r=0.046, Ppermutaiton=0.01 in test dataset). These brain volumes include the left amygdala 451 and right ventral striatum, right frontal pole, right occipital fusiform gyrus, as well as 452 bilateral cerebellar lobules VIIIa and VIIb, right posterior cerebellum crus I and II 453 (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 17). The first urban environment profile was 454 negatively correlated with brain volume in these areas and positively correlated with 455 affective symptoms group. We also found 11 regional brain volumes significantly 456 associated with the second urban environmental profile and the anxiety symptom group 457\n(r=0.045, Ppermutation=0.006 in training dataset; r=0.045, Ppermutation=0.007 in test dataset) 458 (Supplementary Table 17). These brain volumes include the inferior frontal regions and 459 the right amygdala, as well as the bilateral cerebellar lobules VIIIa and VIIb, posterior 460 cerebellum crus I, right cerebellar lobule V and left lobule VI (Figure 4 and 461 Supplementary Table 17). Finally, there were 13 regional brain volumes, including 462 bilateral frontal pole, amygdala, precentral gyrus, insular and left lateral occipital cortex, 463 associated with the third urban environment profile and the emotional instability 464 symptom group (r=0.057, Ppermutation<0.001 in the training dataset; r=0.060, 465 Ppermutation<0.001 in test dataset) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 17). 466\n467\nModerated mediation analysis between urban living environment profile, brain 468 volume and mental illness symptoms groups modulated by genomics 469\nTo test whether the relation of urban living environment with symptoms group of 470 mental illness is mediated by brain volume and moderated by genetics, we 471 independently performed moderated mediation analysis in each replicated gene score 472 (moderating variable), three urban living environment profiles (independent variable), 473 three brain volume correlates (mediated variable) and three symptoms groups of mental 474 illness (dependent variable) in 8,726 participants with complete data. Explained 475 mediation effect (EME) were reported for moderated mediation analyses. Thus, a total 476 of 21 moderated mediations analysis were tested (13 gene scores of the affective 477 symptom group, 6 gene scores of the anxiety symptom group and 2 gene scores of the 478\nemotional instability symptom group). Of the 13 replicated gene scores in the affective 479 symptom group, we found that the CRHR1 gene score (EME=5.01%), MAPT gene 480 score (EME=3.62%), TCF4 gene score (EME=1.62%) and DCC gene score 481 (EME=1.96%) moderate the mediation pathway from environment profile to brain 482 correlate to affective symptom group. For example, participants with higher CRHR1 483 genetic risk living in areas of more urban environment exposure had lower brain volume 484 and demonstrated more severe affective symptoms (Figure 4). We found moderation of 485 the mediation pathway of the anxiety symptom group by the EXD3 gene score 486 (EME=3.65%) and of the emotional instability symptom group by the IFT74 gene score 487 (EME=2.86%) (Figure 4). 488\n489\nanalysis of gene scores. a.

Top. A schematic diagram of moderated 497 mediation analysis between genomics, urban living environment profile, brain and 498 mental illness symptom group. Bottom. Columns show an indirect effect in the 499 mediation analysis between environmental profile, brain volume and mental illness 500 symptom groups, which were moderated by each gene score. We found that the CRHR1 501 gene score (EME=5.01%), MAPT gene score (EME=3.62%), TCF4 gene score 502 (EME=1.62%) and DCC gene score (EME=1.96%) moderate the mediation pathway 503 from environmental profile to brain correlate to the affective symptom group. The 504 EXD3 gene moderates the mediation pathway from environmental profile to brain 505 correlate to the anxiety symptom group (EME=3.65%). IFT74 gene score moderates 506 the mediation pathway from environment profile to brain correlate to emotional 507 instability symptom group (EME=2.86%). AM, allotment. EME, explained mediation 508 effect; IMD, Index of Multiple Deprivation; NDVI, normalized difference vegetation 509 index; SN, street network measures; STD, standard deviation. 510\n511\nDiscussion 512\nWe describe how the urban living environment affects brain and mental illness 513 by identifying environmental profiles derived from a comprehensive set of measures of 514 deprivation, pollution, land use, and infrastructure that are correlated with distinct 515 groups of affective, anxiety and emotional instability symptoms, mediated by 516 reductions in regional brain volume and moderated by genes involved in pertinent 517 biological pathways. 518\nOur approach and findings are novel, as they characterise specific multimodal 519 environmental profiles in an integrated way, while enabling a qualitative and 520 quantitative assessment of each factor of the profile. This is an advance beyond the 521 isolated assessment of individual environmental factors, as has previously been the 522 norm9,47. As a consequence, we are able to explain a greater degree of variance of 523 integrated environmental factors (3.61%) than comparable studies measuring 524 individual environmental factors, such as night-time light (2.56%), built-up areas 525 (1.21%) and NDVI (1.00%)8, alone. Furthermore, the integrated approach enables us 526 to assess the role of each individual environmental factor in a context that is relevant 527 for mental illness. In another innovation, we describe how the effect of environmental 528 profiles on symptoms groups of mental illness is mediated by regional brain volume 529 and moderated by genetic factors. 530\nBy providing evidence for the brain-related correlates of environmental 531 adversity and their consequences for mental health, we are broadening the evidence 532 required for responsible urban and development planning. Furthermore, we are 533\nenabling the development of neurobehavioural interventions that may convey adaptive 534 coping skills for environmental adversity by targeting specific brain mechanisms, for 535 example through neurofeedback-guided virtual reality sessions48,49. The identification 536 of genetic moderators points towards biological pathways that might underlie the 537 observed relation between environment, brain and behaviour. It may also enable the 538 selection of individuals that are more sensitive to environmental adversity, and thus 539 might be more likely to benefit from targeted interventions. 540\nSpecifically, our analyses reveal the first environmental profile dominated by 541 high degrees of deprivation and air pollution, and to a lesser extent traffic, short distance 542 to infrastructural facilities and lack of green space. This environmental profile evokes 543 the image of a poor, dense inner city neighbourhood. It is correlated with increased 544 affective symptoms, in particular high levels of unenthusiasm, tiredness, loneliness, as 545 well as depressed mood and feelings of being fed-up. The correlation is mediated by 546 volume reductions in brain regions linked to emotional processing, such as the left 547 amygdala50, regions linked to reward processing and exploration, such as the right 548 ventral striatum51 and the right frontal pole52, as well as other brain areas implicated in 549 affective processing, such as several cerebellar regions53 and the right occipital fusiform 550 gyrus54. While these findings point towards plausible mediators of a stressful 551 environment on affective symptoms, they also suggest the presence of different 552 underlying neurobehavioural mechanisms, a possibility that is supported by the 553 findings of our genetic analysis. Here we identified different moderators that may 554 influence distinct brain mechanisms underlying the affective symptoms identified: First 555\nand foremost, CRHR1, which is also expressed in the amygdala55, is a critical regulator 556 of both the hypothalamic as well as the behavioural extrahypothalamic stress response. 557 In addition, the environmental effect is moderated by genes regulating brain structure, 558 including MAPT, involved in neurodegeneration56, TCF4, inducing neural 559 differentiation57 and DCC, an adhesion molecule that guides axon growth58. Apart from 560 these moderators, we identified several genes that were associated with the affective 561 component and were involved in relevant neural mechanisms, including G-protein 562 signalling (ARL17B)59, epigenetic regulation (KANSL1)60 and others. These moderating 563 genes are located in two genomic loci of chromosome 17q21.3 and 18q21.2. Notably, 564 the chromosome 17q21.3 genomic locus is the site of a human supergene candidate, a 565 cluster of tightly linked functional genetic elements spanning approximately 900 kb 566 that control balanced phenotypes and are inherited as a unit61. Haplotypes of this cluster 567 have been associated with brain morphology and different cognitive and behavioural 568 traits, including depressive behaviour, neuroticism and risk taking behaviour62,63. The 569 18q21.2 region at the transcription factor 4 gene TCF4 and netrin 1 receptor gene DCC 570 featured the most pleiotropic association with eight psychiatric disorders64, and has 571 been previously associated with both depression and neuroticism65,66. The product of 572 DCC plays a critical role in guiding axonal growth during neurodevelopment and serves 573 as a master regulator of midline crossing and white matter projections67. 574\nThe second environmental profile captures a different urban profile, one that is 575 dominated by green spaces and long distances to waste and energy facilities as well as 576 presence of water, all of which are inversely correlated (protective) to symptoms of 577\nanxiety. These symptoms are \u2018worry too long, anxious feelings, nervous feelings, 578 nerves, tense and suffer from nerves\u2019. The anxiety symptoms are also positively 579 correlated with signs of denser urban build-up, such as density of streets and leisure 580 places as well as urban regions with mixed residential, commercial and industrial use. 581 Together, these correlations point to an important role of green spaces and a less dense 582 and more generous land use in protecting against symptoms of anxiety, thus extending 583 previous findings relating urban green spaces to mental health8. The relation between 584 environmental profiles and anxiety symptoms are mediated by volume reductions in the 585 inferior frontal regions, the right amygdala and cerebellar regions. They are moderated 586 by variations in the EXD3 gene, involved in nucleic acid binding and widely expressed 587 in the brain. EXD3 has previously been associated with anxiety, phobic and dissociative 588 disorders35. While EXD3 has a low tissue specificity, its expression in the brain is 589 highest in frontal cortical brain areas. Similar to the second environmental profile, the 590 third environmental profile shows positive correlations of measures of density of land 591 use and urban infrastructure with a group of symptoms best summarised as emotional 592 instability, which include feeling guilty, frequency of tenseness, miserableness, mood 593 swings, neuroticism score, risk taking, irritability and sensitivity, hurt feelings, illness, 594 injury, bereavement or stress in last 2 years. These symptoms were mediated by frontal 595 pole, amygdala, precentral gyrus, insular cortex and cerebellum, and moderated by 596 ITF74, a critical factor in neuronal migration, a cause for Bardet-Biedl syndrome and 597 Joubert syndrome44,45, which has been found associated with paranoid schizophrenia46. 598\nWhile our findings differentiate distinct groups of environmentally-related 599 symptoms of mental illness, the overarching role of social deprivation68 and urban 600 density69 as a risk factor is evident. Conversely, we found green spaces9,10 and generous 601 land use70 to be protective factors against affective and anxiety symptoms. These 602 environmental factors may engage brain mechanisms related to behavioural inhibition 603 (frontal cortex), reward processing (ventral striatum) and emotional processing 604 (amygdala) that may be moderated by biological pathways involved in stress response, 605 neuronal plasticity, epigenetic, transcriptional and neurotransmitter regulation. 606 Interestingly, the posterior cerebellar lobule VIIb and VIIIa, posterior cerebellar crus I 607 are among the brain mediators of environmental effects on symptoms of mental illness, 608 supporting a role for the cerebellum in coordinating and regulating not only voluntary 609 movements, but also cognitive and affective perceptions of the environment8,71. 610\nOur data do not enable the characterisation of individual biological pathways 611 that mediate defined environmental adversity. To carry out such mechanistic 612 investigation and to identify biomarkers for risk and resilience, a more deeply 613 phenotyped dataset with neurobehavioural characterisation is required. Our findings 614 generate hypotheses, that may be tested in well characterised samples of a much smaller 615 size. Another important question raised by this study is the generalizability of its results 616 beyond industrialised high income countries to low and medium income countries, 617 where socioeconomic conditions between rural and urban dwellers may be different 618 compared to Europe. Further studies validating our results in a global mental health 619 context are required. 620\nBy providing first evidence for comprehensive environmental profiles that 621 affect distinct groups of symptoms of mental illness, our results lay the ground work 622 for an exact characterisation of biological mechanisms underlying complex, real-life 623 environmental adversity. The quantification of the relative contribution of each 624 environmental factor to brain and symptoms of mental illness and their interplay in a 625 living environment are novelties of this study that will aid in targeting and prioritizing 626 important decisions for planning and public health interventions. 627\n628\nMaterial and methods 629\nParticipants 630\nUK Biobank Project 631\nUK Biobank (UKBB) is a population-based cohort including 502,616 participants 632 living in United Kingdom, where over 40,000 participants have obtained neuroimaging 633 scans (at the time of our analyses datasets of 42,796 participants were available). 634 Individuals were invited to the study if they were registered with the National Health 635 Service and if they lived within a 35 km radius of one of the 22 assessment centres 636 located across the UK at the time of recruitment, which took place between 2007 and 637 2010. Baseline assessments included genomics, physical and social exposures, 638 sociodemographic, lifestyle, occupational, psychosocial and environmental measures. 639 Informed consent was obtained from all UKBB participants. Ethical procedures are 640 controlled by a dedicated Ethics and Guidance Council 641\n(http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ethics) that has developed with UKBB an Ethics and 642 Governance Framework (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-643 content/uploads/2011/05/EGF20082.pdf), with IRB approval also obtained from the 644 North West Multi-center Research Ethics Committee. The data collected at baseline 645 was used in this study. Demographic information of each statistical analysis was shown 646 in Table 1. 647\n648\nData collection 649\nUrban living environment data 650\nIndices of multiple deprivation (IMD), traffic, residential pollution, greenspace 651 and coastal proximity as well as urban morphometric measures were used to measure 652 the urban living social and physical environment around participants available in the 653 category \u2018local enviroment\u2019 in UK Biobank (data-field 113). A total of 53 categories 654 including 128 urban living environment items were included in the urban living 655 environment data. The detailed items and categories used are shown in Supplementary 656 Table 1 and 2. To exclude items with extremely skewed data distribution, we used the 657 function nearZeroVar from the caret R package72 and no items excluded. In the 128 658 items, we calculated the median absolute deviation (MAD) and removed values larger 659 than 4 MAD in each environment item. For further analyses, we used 216,341 660 participants with complete 128 environmental items. 661\n662\nIndices of Multiple Deprivation 663\nIndices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores were used to classify the relative 664 deprivation (a measure of poverty) in British local councils which published by UK 665 government (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-indices-of-666 deprivation). IMD scores were calculated separately in England (EIMD), Scotland 667 (SIMD) and Wales (WIMD), because multiple different components of deprivation are 668 weighted with different strengths and compiled into a single score of deprivation. The 669 EIMD score is composed of seven domain indices, including income deprivation 670 (Income subdomain, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and Older People 671 Index), employment deprivation, health deprivation and disability, education, skills and 672 training deprivation (children and young people subdomain and adults\u2019 skills 673 subdomain), barriers to housing and services (wider and geographical barriers 674 subdomain), living environment deprivation (indoors and outdoors subdomain) and 675 crime. The SIMD score is composed of seven domain indices, including crime (only 676 from 2006), current income, education, skills and training, employment, geographic 677 access, health and housing. The WIMD score is composed of eight domain indices for 678 income, employment, health, education, access to services, community safety, physical 679 environment and housing. 680\nTraffic 681\nTraffic consists of seven items: (1) Close to major road; (2) Inverse distance to the 682 nearest major road; (3) Inverse distance to the nearest road; (4) Sum of road length of 683\nmajor roads within 100m; (5) Total traffic load on major roads; (6) Traffic intensity on 684 the nearest major road; (7) Traffic intensity on the nearest road. 685\nResidential pollution 686\nResidential air pollution consists of five items: (1) Nitrogen dioxide air pollution 687 from 2005 to 2010; (2) Nitrogen oxides air pollution in 2010; (3) Particulate matter 10 688 um air pollution in 2007 and 2010; (4) Particulate matter 2.5 um air pollution in 2010; 689 (5) Particulate matter 2.5-10um air pollution in 2010. Residential sound pollution 690 consists of five items: (1) Average 16-hour sound level of noise pollution; (2) Average 691 24-hour sound level of noise pollution; (3) Average daytime sound level of noise 692 pollution; (4) Average evening sound level of noise pollution; (5) Average nighttime 693 sound level of noise pollution. 694\nGreenspace and coastal proximity 695\nGreenspace and coastal proximity category contains environmental indicators 696 relating to greenspace exposure and distance to the coast that was attributed to 697 participants based on 300m home location buffers, including five items: (1) Natural 698 environment percentage estimate compared to the 'built environment'; (2) Greenspace 699 percentage estimates; (3) Domestic garden percentage estimates; (4) Domestic water 700 percentage estimates; (5) Distance from home location to coast. 701\nUrban Morphometric Platform measures 702\nUK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (UKBump) was an individual-level 703 built environment database of health-specific urban exposures within residential street 704 catchments of UK Biobank participants\u2019 geocoded home address73. Spatial and network 705 modelling were performed upon multiple UK-wide dataset, including AddressBase 706 Premium data of Ordnance Survey GB, remotely sensing data, digital terrain 707 topographical models and other datasets based on the anonymized UK Biobank 708 participants\u2019 geocoded home address73. 709 A total of six metrics including 104 urban environment measures from UKBump 710 were used. The six metrics used in this study include: (1) Building class (n=3); (2) 711 Destination accessibility (n=33); (3) Greenness (n=2); (4) Land use density (n=46); (5) 712 Street network accessibility based on 400m home location buffers (n=18) 713 (Supplementary Table 3); (6) Terrain (slope) (n=2). 714\n715 Genomics data 716\nWe used the imputed genomic data (Version 3) made available by UK Biobank 717 with 487,411 individuals74, which was imputed from the Haplotype Reference 718 Consortium (HRC) reference panel75 and a merged UK10K and 1000 Genomes phase 719 3 reference panels76. In participants-level quality control, we applied exclusion filters 720 for participants as follows: (1) participants with a mismatch in reported sex and 721 chromosome X imputed sex or with putative sex chromosome aneuploidy; (2) 722 participants with genetic kinship to other participants; (3) excess heterozygosity or 723 missing rates; (4) non-Caucasian participants; (5) without calculated genetic principal 724\ncomponents. In SNPs-level quality control, we applied exclusion filters for SNPs as 725 follows: (1) minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001; (2) imputation info quality score > 726 0.3. A total of 275,988 participants and 139,187,27 SNPs were finally used in the 727 further analysis. 728\n729\nMental health measures 730\nThere are 44 mental health items in the category \u2018Mental health\u2019 in the UK 731 Biobank that cover symptoms of affective and anxiety disorders, as well as personality 732 (category id:100060). These items were obtained from a standardised mental health 733 questionnaire that participants answered at the time of recruitment. Of this 734 questionnaire 21 items were excluded because the missing rate was larger than 50% 735 from 502,616 participants of UK Biobank. To exclude mental health items with 736 extremely skewed data distribution, we used the function nearZeroVar from the caret 737 R package72 and excluded 2 items. Finally, a total of 21 mental health items with 738 complete data in 365,201 participants were included in the further analysis. A full list 739 of the 21 mental health measures is shown in Supplementary Table 4. 740\n741\nNeuroimaging data 742\nIn this study, neuroimaging data were acquired from one 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner 743 from Siemens\u00ae Skyra running VD13A SP4 with a standard 32-channel radiofrequency 744 receive head coil at UK Biobank imaging center in Cheadle Manchester. The standard 745\nparameters of a 3D MPRAGE sequence are shown in 746 https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf. 747\nA total of 154 regional image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) were investigated: 111 748 cortical and subcortical gray matter volume (GMV) segmentations from the FAST 749 segmentations (data-field 1101), 28 cerebellum GMV segmentations from the FAST 750 segmentations (data-field 1101), and 15 subcortical volumes from the FIRST (data-751 field 1102). The detailed information are shown in 752 https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf. A total of 42,796 753 participants\u2019 neuroimaging data were used for the present study. 754\n755\nConfounding variables 756\nAge, gender and assessment centers were adjusted as confounding covariates in 757 the further analysis. The 21 mental health variables were firstly corrected for 758 confounding variables and normalized as well. For neuroimaging-related analyses, total 759 incranial volume (TIV) was additionally corrected. 760\n761\nStatistical analysis 762\nTrain and test sample split design 763\nParticipants from UK Biobank with complete urban living environmental data and 764 mental health data (n=156,375) were divided into datasets without neuroimaging data 765\n(UKB non-NI dataset, n=141,325) and with neuroimaging data (UKB NI dataset, 766 n=15,050). Participants without neuroimaging data (n=141,325) were divided into train 767 and test dataset to ensure validity of the results: 90% of the participants were used as a 768 training dataset (n=127,193) and 10% of the participants (n=14,132) were used as a test 769 dataset for model validation. The dataset with neuroimaging data (n=15,050) was used 770 for independent replication of the relation between urban living environment, genes and 771 mental health, as well as for additional neuroimaging analyses. (Table 1). 772\n773\nUrban living environmental variables construction 779\nIn the CFA models, ten-fold cross-validation was performed to ensure unbiased 780 estimates of generalizability throughout the analytic pipeline and to optimize the CFA 781 models. For each fold, 90% of participants were used to build the CFA model, and the 782\noptimized CFA model was used to calculate latent variables for the remaining 10% of 783 participants in each environment subcategory. We used two criteria to optimize the 784 CFA model by selecting appropriate environment measures. The first criterion was the 785 goodness of fit of the CFA model assessed by Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), Comparative 786 Fit Index (CFI), chi square, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and 787 standard root mean square residual (SRMR). The criteria for excellent model fit were 788 TSI>0.95, CFI>0.95, RMSEA<0.06 and SRMR<0.0857-59. The second criterion was the 789 inclusion of environment measures that best reflect different aspects of urban 790 environment. For example, in residential noise pollution variables, we initially 791 constructed a CFA model by including all five noise pollution measures in the training 792 dataset. Based on factor loadings of the five noise pollution measures, we removed the 793 \u2018Average night-time sound level of noise pollution\u2019 item with the smallest factor 794 loading and repeated the CFA modelling. These steps were iterated until the resulting 795 CFA model satisfied our criteria for excellent model fit in the training dataset. The 796 factor loadings of the optimized CFA model were used to calculate the latent residential 797 noise pollution measure in the test dataset. This process was applied into 10 folds to 798 predict all out-of sample 19 environmental variables. 799\n800\nMultivariate relation of urban living environment with mental health 801\nTo investigate the multivariate relation between urban living environment and 802 mental health, we conducted multivariate analyses using sparse canonical correlation 803\nanalysis (sCCA) implemented in MATLAB (version R2018a) based on our previous 804 work19. In detail, the analysis design was carried out as follows: 805\n(1) The full dataset was randomly split into training and test datasets. The training 806 dataset was made up of 90% of the data whilst the testing set was made up of the 807 remaining 10%. 808\n(2) The training dataset was then randomly split into 100 resamples. Each resample 809 was made up of nt/2 participant scans, where nt is the total number of participants in 810 the training dataset. 811\n(3) The first stage of the msCCA-regression algorithm was then applied to each 812 resample, with a sparsity constraint of 0.5 in each view of the data19. 813\n(4) The resulting weights for each environment and mental health variable were 814 recorded for each resample. The environment and mental health variables with non-815 zero loading above 90% across the resamples were selected and retained as stable 816 variables in subsequent analyses. 817\n(5) We then re-applied the sCCA algorithm to the data, without sparsity constraints, 818 on the stable urban living environment and mental health measures in the training 819 dataset. The canonical correlation value between urban living environment and mental 820 health measures were recorded. 821\n(6) We then permuted the training data, and repeated steps (2)-(5). This was done 822 for 10,000 different permutations of the training data labelling. In each case, we 823\nrecorded the canonical correlation value between urban living environment and mental 824 health measures. In this way, we built up a permutation distribution to assess the 825 significance of the relationship between urban living environment and mental health 826 measures in the experimental labelling, within the training dataset. 827\n(7) We then applied the trained model to the test dataset to produce canonical 828 correlates of urban living environment and mental health measures. We recorded 829 associations for training and testing dataset. 830\n(8) We then randomly permuted the data rows in the test dataset and recalculated 831 correlation values between urban living environment and mental health canonical 832 correlates. We recorded associations between urban living environment and mental 833 health correlates, for each of 10,000 permutations of the experimental labelling. False 834 Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was used to control for multiple testings and a 835 PFDR<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 836\n(9) After determining the significance of the first canonical correlate, we remove 837 the effect of the first set of canonical vectors by projection deflation as we did before19, 838 and repeat the sCCA analysis between the remaining urban living environment and 839 mental health variables. These steps were iterated until the resulting canonical correlate 840 were not significant any more. 841\n(10) To ensure reliability and reproducibility, we undertook further analyses 842 including: a. sample composition using bootstrapping with replacement and random 843 resampling; b. the effect of sex (Supplemental Methods). 844\nFinally, we calculated the canonical correlations coefficient between the urban 845 living environment canonical variables (which we refer to as \u2018urban environmental 846 profile\u2019) and mental health canonical variables (referred to as \u2018mental illness symptom 847 group\u2019), as well as structure coefficient value (rs) of individual variables 848\n849\nGWAS analyses of the mental health symptoms groups that related to urban 850 environment profile 851\nFor the significant mental illness symptom group that correlated with urban living 852 environment profile from sCCA results, we conducted a genome-wide association 853 analysis (GWAS) of the corresponding mental illness symptom group in 85,348 854 participants with complete genomic, urban environment and mental health data (Table 855 1). Using BGENIE v1.2 (https://jmarchini.org/bgenie/), we fit an additive model of 856 association at each variant, using expected genotype count (dosage) from the imputed 857 genetic data. The covariates included age, gender, assessment centre, processing batch 858 and the top 10 ancestry principal components. Bonferroni Pc<0.05 (uncorrected 859 P<0.05/139,187,27\u00d7numbers of significant mental illness symptom group from sCCA 860 results) was considered as a statistically significant threshold. We employed the FUMA 861 online platform (https://fuma.ctglab.nl/) to fine mapping to genes and perform 862 annotation of significant SNPs of each GWAS analysis. All SNPs with genome-wide 863 significance were mapped to genes based on physical distance. Each SNP was mapped 864 to the nearest gene in the human reference assembly (GRCh37/hg19). 865\nGene-set enrichment analysis 866\nTo better understand the biological function of fine-mapping genes associated with 867 mental health components, these genes were functionally annotated using ToppGene 868 portal (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/) to identify significant enrichments for gene 869 ontology (GO). The Benjamini and Hochberg method for false discovery rate (FDR-870 BH correction) (qc < 0.05) was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. The default 871 full reference gene list of each category in ToppGene were used as background gene 872 set. 873\n874\nReplication ananlysis 875\nTo replicate the multivariate relation between urban living environment and 876 mental health, we applied the sCCA analysis in an independent dataset of 15,050 877 participants with complete environmental, mental health and neuroimaging data from 878 UKB-NI dataset. Again, we used a training dataset (n=13,545, 90%) and a test dataset 879 (n=1,505, 10%) , a re-sampling method to ensure variable stability (with a threshold of 880 90% for non-zero weights from re-sampled data to consider as stable variables) and 881 permutation tests to assess the significance of the results (10,000 times) as we used in 882 the discovery sCCA analysis. Next, we independently replicated the significant SNPs 883 associated with symptom groups of mental illness surviving from the discovery GWAS 884 analysis (UKB-nonNI dataset) in an independent 8,726 participants of UKB-NI dataset 885 at Bonferroni Pc<0.05 (uncorrected P<0.05/the numbers of all significant SNPs of 886\nGWAS from discovery analysis). Then we calculated the corresponding genes scores 887 as the same way we did in the discovery analysis. And finally we independently 888 validated the associations between genes scores and symptoms group of mental illness 889 in the UKB-NI dataset. 890\n891\nBrain volume changes underlying the associations between urban living 892 environment and mental health 893\nTo investigate neurobiological mechanisms underlying the associations between 894 urban living environment and mental health, we carried out a multiple sparse canonical 895 correlation analysis (msCCA) between the environmental component, brain volume 896 measures and the mental health component. This analysis was conducted in an 897 independent sample of 15,050 participants with environmental, mental health and 898 neuroimaging data from UK Biobank. Again, we used a training dataset (n=13,545, 899 90%) and a test dataset (n=1,505, 10%), a re-sampling method to ensure variable 900 stability (with a threshold of 85% for non-zero weights from re-sampled data to 901 consider as stable variables) and permutation tests to assess the significance of the 902 results (10,000 times). An in-house Matlab script based on our previous work19 was 903 employed for this analysis. Finally, the brain volume canonical variables (refered to as 904 brain component), the canonical correlations coefficient between environment, brain 905 and mental health canonical variables, structural loadings and weights of corresponding 906 brain volume variables were calculated. 907\nModerated mediation analysis between urban living enviroment, brain volume 908 and mental health correlates modulated by genomics 909\nThe above analysis was carried out separately to identify the associations of mental 910 health symptoms with urban living environment, genetic variation and brain volume, 911 leaving the complex associations of urban living, genomics, brain and mental health 912 unexplored. To formally test whether urban living environment-mental health 913 relationship can be mediated by brain volume and modulated by genetics, we carried 914 out a modulated mediation analysis in 8,726 participants. Moderated mediation analysis 915 is an extension of mediation analysis, which is a valuable technique for assessing 916 whether an indirect effect is conditional on a moderating variable. The basis of 917 moderation and mediation effect were integrated into a combined model of moderated 918 mediation within a linear regression framework. Finally, genomics was defined as 919 modulated variables, the urban living environment correlate was defined as an 920 independent variable, the brain volume correlates a mediator variable and the mental 921 health correlates a dependent variable. 922\nIn moderated mediation analyses, all indirect effects are estimated in one multiple 923 regression analysis with independent variable and all mediators as predictor variables. 924 This means that the indirect effect of one mediator was estimated when the other 925 mediators are taken into account. We used bootstrapping to assess the significance of 926 the mediation effect. After 5,000 bias-corrected bootstrapping, we estimated the 927 distribution of the indirect effect and calculate its 95% confidence intervals (CI). If zero 928\ndoes not fall between the resulting 95% confidence interval of the bootstrapping method, 929 we confirmed the existence of a significant mediation effect (P<0.05). It should be 930 emphasized that in the multiple mediation analysis of this study, mediators and 931 dependent variables were measured contemporaneously, thus not allowing 932 establishment of any causal directionality. Explained mediation effect (EME) and 95% 933 CI were reported for moderated mediation analyses. Confounding factors were 934 controlled in the moderated mediation model. The moderated mediation analysis with 935 a nonparametric bootstrap method was conducted using the mediation R package77. 936\n937\nReferences 938 1. Heilig, G.K.
