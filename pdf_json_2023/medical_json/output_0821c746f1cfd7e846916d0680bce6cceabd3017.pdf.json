    "abstractText": "Mineral and bone disorders (MBD) are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. For several decades, the first-line approach to controlling hyperparathyroidism in CKD was by exogenous calcium loading. Since the turn of the millennium, however, a growing awareness of vascular calcification risk has led to a paradigm shift in management and a move away from calcium-based phosphate binders. As a consequence, contemporary CKD patients may be at risk of a negative calcium balance, which, in turn, may compromise bone health, contributing to renal bone disease and increased fracture risk. A calcium intake below a certain threshold may be as problematic as a high intake, worsening the MBD syndrome of CKD, but is not addressed in current clinical practice guidelines. The CKD-MBD and European Renal Nutrition working groups of the European Renal Association (ERA), together with the CKD-MBD and Dialysis working groups of the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN), developed key evidence points and clinical practice points on calcium management in children and adults with CKD across stages of disease. These were reviewed by a Delphi panel consisting of ERA and ESPN working groups members. The main clinical practice points include a suggested total calcium intake from diet and medications of 800\u20131000 mg/day and not exceeding 1500 mg/day to maintain a neutral calcium balance in adults with CKD. In children with CKD, total calcium intake should be kept within the D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /ndt/advance-arti.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Idian Intitute of Tenology Ptna user on 13 Jauary 2024 Received: June 1, 2023; Editorial decision: July 31, 2023 \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

Its non-structural roles require the trict maintenance of ionized calcium concentration in tissue fluds. In situations of too low exogenous calcium supply, the calcium eservoir in the skeleton can complement the plasma [ 1 ]. Wholeody calcium balance refers to the net of calcium influx into the ody minus all calcium losses from the body during a given time eriod [ 2 ]. In healthy adults over the age of 25\u201330 years, the rate of calcium\nbsorption from the gastrointestinal tract must match the losses rom the body through the gut, kidneys, skin, hair and nails; so hat calcium balance is neutral (Fig. 1 ). Age, sex, bone disease, horonal status and exercise all affect calcium balance. In chronic idney disease (CKD), dysregulated calcium homeostasis renders atients at risk of either a negative or a positive calcium balance. Hypocalcemia drives hyperparathyroidism, which in turn inreases bone turnover, resulting in reduced mineralization and one loss, compromising bone strength. Along with an increased\nall risk and abnormalities in bone quality related to uremia, this equence of events contributes to the increased fracture risk in KD [ 3 ]. Adults with CKD G5 and on dialysis (CKD G5D) exhibit a - to 6-fold higher risk of non-vertebral fractures than age- and ex-matched controls [ 4 , 5 ], and even children with early CKD G2\u20133A) have a 2- to 3-fold higher fracture risk compared with heir healthy peers [ 6 ]. In the 1990s, exogenous calcium loading through a high calium dialysate and concomitant use of calcium-containing phoshate binders and active vitamin D derivatives were the firstine approach to control hyperparathyroidism and hyperphoshatemia in CKD. Around the turn of the millennium, increased wareness of the vascular calcification burden in CKD triggered paradigm shift. Preventing vascular calcification was given pririty over controlling hyperparathyroidism [ 7 , 8 ]. Excessive calium loading was shown to associate with vascular calcification rogression and was assumed to contribute to the increased cariovascular risk in CKD. Against this background, calcium-free hosphate binders rapidly gained popularity, often completely eplacing calcium-based binders. Meanwhile, calcimimetics enered clinical practice and proved very powerful in suppressing\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nparathyroid hormone (PTH) and unlike active vitamin D derivatives, without increasing calcium levels\u2014rather the opposite. Calcimimetics thus increasingly complemented, if not replaced, active vitamin D derivatives for the control of hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD G5D. Calcium was inappropriately labeled a \u201ccardiovascular toxin\u201d [ 9 ], and clinical guidelines and position papers [ 10 ] emphasized the risks of overzealous calcium loading. This \u201cwar on calcium\u201d may have caused collateral damage. An increasing number of patients with CKD may be at risk of overt calcium deficiency, potentially contributing to inadequate control of hyperparathyroidism, worsening of renal bone disease and increased fracture risk. Thus, calcium intake below a lower threshold limit might induce harm, just as exceeding the upper tolerable limit will. An inadequate provision of calcium may go unnoticed for long periods, because commonly available tools for estimating calcium requirements remain crude and unreliable. In current clinical practice, serum calcium levels are our only tool for estimating calcium requirements, but serum calcium accounts for < 0.1% of total body calcium, and due to tight negative feedback control, cannot reflect the total body calcium. Calcium management in CKD remains an area fraught with uncertainties, resulting in wide variations in practice. Notably, the KDIGO guidelines on CKD\u2013mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), published in 2009 [ 7 ] and updated in 2017 [ 11 ], do not include recommendations for calcium intake for patients receiving maintenance dialysis or living with a kidney transplant. Moreover, expertise from dieticians is often lacking even in tertiary nephrology centers.\nAcknowledging the need for a balanced view on calcium management, the European Renal Osteodystrophy (EUROD) initiative, a part of the European Renal Association (ERA) CKD-MBD working group, and the ERA European Renal Nutrition (ERN) working group, together with members of the CKD-MBD and Dialysis working groups of the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN), convened a group of nephrologists and nutritionists (expert panel, ExP) with expertise in CKD-MBD management and renal nutrition. The initiative was endorsed by the ERA. The ExP was tasked with developing a consensus statement on calcium management in CKD, especially on the recommended intake of calcium in children and adults with CKD across stages of dis-\nease. These recommendations are designed to provide information and assist in decision-making to reduce uncertainty and improve patient outcome. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be interpreted as an exclusive course of management. Recommendations for further research are suggested. Following publication of the consensus statement, the ExP has planned a dissemination phase to guide practical day-to-day management of calcium intake.\nMETHODS Developing the PICO questions Clinical practice recommendations are most useful when they provide specific actionable advice on choosing between alternative approaches in particular clinical situations. We developed clinical questions to be addressed and framed them in a searchable format, with specification of the patient group (P) to whom the statement would apply; the intervention (I) being considered; the comparator (C) (which may be \u201cno action\u201d or an alternative intervention); and the outcomes (O) affected by the intervention. Our PICO terms were as follows:\nPopulation: patients (children and adults) with CKD G2\u20135D Intervention: nutritional requirement for calcium at different ages and stages of CKD Comparator: nutritional requirements for calcium in agematched healthy controls Outcomes: bone pain and deformities, fracture risk, calcium balance, bone (de)mineralization (on imaging or bone histology), development of hypo- or hypercalcemia, PTH control, changes in bone turnover markers, development of vascular calcification (on imaging or vessel biopsy), all-cause and cardiovascular mortality\nWe have included children, adolescents and adults in this consensus document as physiological changes in bone development constitute a continuum through the ages, with the skeletal turnover and mineralization in young adults being more similar to the growing bones of children with accrual of calcium rather than the slow demineralization of the skeleton of older adults [ 12 , 13 ]. The Paediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce have recently published clinical practice recommendations on the dietary management of calcium and phosphate in children with CKD G2\u20135D [ 14 ], which will be referred to for specific details on the dietary management of childhood CKD-MBD. No distinction was made between sexes, given the paucity of sex-specific data. Calcium requirements in pregnant and lactating women is beyond the scope of this document.\nLiterature search Given the paucity of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically dealing with the topic of calcium management in CKD, original research manuscripts have mainly been used to provide the evidence base for this consensus. Existing guidelines on nutritional requirements of calcium in healthy individuals of all ages were reviewed. Clinical practice recommendations are based on an in-depth review of the available evidence, but in the absence of applicable studies, guidance is based on the opinion of experienced dietitians and nephrologists from the ExP.\nFraming advice This consensus presents \u201cKey evidence points\u201d providing a concise summary of available evidence, and \u201cClinical practice points\u201d presenting our clinical practice recommendations.

Participants or the Delphi survey were board and ordinary members f the ERA CKD-MBD (including EUROD) and ERN workng groups, and the ESPN CKD-MBD and Dialysis working roups. It was agreed a priori that at least a 70% level of conensus was required for each statement, failing which the ecommendation would be adapted after discussion in the ExP, nd reviewed again.\nUESTION 1: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED NTAKE OF CALCIUM IN HEALTHY NDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT AGES? alcium requirements in healthy individuals ey evidence points \u2022 Adequate calcium intake is defined as the amount that meets\nthe needs of 97.5% of healthy people in the age-related population. \u2022 Calcium requirements are expressed in milligrams of elemental calcium intake per day (mg/day). \u2022 Calcium requirements are described as a range based on evidence from balance studies and clinical trials on fracture risk reduction. \u2022 Calcium requirements vary considerably throughout the lifespan, being highest during periods of rapid growth in infancy and adolescence. \u2022 International recommendations have set a reference intake of 800\u20131000 mg/day for healthy adults over 25 years of age.\nackground and rationale t is important to define calcium requirements in healthy indiiduals before modifications to the calcium intake are considered n patients with CKD. Recommendations for calcium intake for he general population of children and adults have been reported y many countries and international authorities including the Intitute of Medicine (IOM) [ 15 ] in the USA and the European Food afety Authority (EFSA) [ 16 ]. Several different terms have been used in international recomendations to describe nutrient adequacy; these include Popuation Reference Intake, Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), ecommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) and Estimated Average Reuirements. To avoid potentially confusing terminology, we decribe calcium requirements in milligrams of elemental calcium ntake per day, and we suggest avoiding terms such as RDA/RNI, tc. However, to compare different guidelines and benchmark nuritional intake against KDIGO and KDOQI guidelines, it is worth oting that the RDA is used in both. Calcium requirements vary throughout the lifespan, being ighest in infancy and adolescence [ 17 \u201319 ] and lower in older age. dequate dietary calcium intake is essential for normal skeletal rowth and mineralization as the calcium content of the skeleton ncreases from 25 g at birth to > 1000 g in adults. Calcium requireents are highest during periods of rapid growth, including the rst year of life and during puberty [ 20 ]. Approximately 25% of he total skeletal mass is laid down during the 2-year interval of eak height velocity during adolescence [ 21 ], but bone calcium ccrual continues, at a slower pace, until peak height is reached t \u223c30 years of age [ 12 ]. Calcium requirements in healthy chil-\nren of different ages have been described by the Paediatric Renal utrition Taskforce [ 14 ]. The IOM, EFSA and others use a factorial approach to de-\nermine optimal calcium requirements, based on carefully conucted calcium balance studies in healthy individuals and on ata from RCTs on calcium intake and skeletal outcomes. Both he IOM and EFSA have used the pooled analyses of studies pubished by Hunt and Johnson [ 22 ], who determined the dietary calium intake required to maintain neutral calcium balance. Calium balance data [calcium intake\u2014(fecal calcium + urinary calium)] were collected from 155 healthy adults (73 women, mean ge 47 years, and 82 men, mean age 28 years) who participated in 9 rigorously controlled feeding studies. Daily intakes of calcium anged from 415 to 1740 mg. The models predicted a neutral calium balance at 741 mg/day (507\u20131035 mg/day). Assuming that neutral balance is achieved with this average requirement of 41 mg/day, and taking into account the variation in calcium reuirements in the population, both the IOM and EFSA have set a eference intake of 800\u20131000 mg/day (corresponding to the averge requirement + 2 SD) for adults > 25 years of age. However, there re also notable differences between these two international recmmendations:\n- EFSA allows a marginally higher calcium intake of 1150 mg/day in young adults up to 25 years to account for the higher bone calcium accretion until peak bone mass is reached. - The IOM recommends a higher calcium intake (1200 mg/day) in women > 50 years and men > 70 years based on reduced calcium absorption with age.\nhe higher calcium requirement in older age is difficult to recncile with the Hunt and Johnson study. Women were not stratfied for menopausal status, and there were only two men above 0 years, with no evidence of changes in skeletal maintenance ith older age. In addition, due to a lack of calcium balance studes in adults > 70 years, RCT data were used instead. However, hese trials are inconsistent, lack information on dietary calcium ntake and show a poor dose\u2013response relationship between calium intake and skeletal outcomes [ 22 ]. Two meta-analyses explored the association between calcium ntake and fracture risk in otherwise healthy adults. Bolland et al. oncluded that dietary calcium intake is not associated with fracure risk and that there is no evidence that increasing calcium ntake from dietary sources prevents fractures [ 23 ]. In a recent eta-analysis by Zhao et al., which included 33 randomized trials ith > 50 000 participants, there was no significant association beween calcium intake and risk of hip fracture as compared with lacebo or no treatment [ 24 ]. Thus, as there is no clear evidence hat a higher calcium intake leads to either a reduced bone loss r a lower fracture risk, we do not recommend increasing the calium intake in older adults, in line with EFSA recommendations. Of note, in the Bolland meta-analysis, those on calcium suppleents had an average total daily calcium intake of 1780 mg/day range 1230\u20132314 mg/day) [ 23 ], which is considerably higher than he average population intake [ 25 ]. Elderly people in residential are have much lower baseline dietary calcium intakes (mean 13 mg/day) together with low baseline vitamin D concentrations. hen such vulnerable adults were given calcium and vitamin D upplements (1200 mg/day + 800 IU/day), the risk of hip fracures was reduced by 23% and all fractures by 17% over 3-year ollow-up [ 26 ]. Similarly, a cluster RCT showed that when vitain D\u2013replete elderly in care homes were given calcium suppleentation by high calcium, high protein dairy foods, those on a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nhigher calcium intake [1142 ( \u00b1353) mg/day vs 700 ( \u00b1247) mg/day in controls] had a risk reduction of 33% for all fractures, 46% for hip fractures and 11% for falls [ 27 ]. In populations with a naturally lower dietary calcium intake (mean 522 mg/day in men and 507 mg/day in women), there was a 6% reduction in the vertebral fracture risk for every 100 mg increase in dietary calcium intake in women, with no association seen in men [ 28 ]. These data suggest that with an insufficient calcium intake, supplementation with calcium (and/or vitamin D) has positive effects on skeletal health, reducing fracture risk.\nDietary sources of calcium and bioavailability Key evidence points \u2022 The main dietary sources of calcium for children and adults\nare dairy products, cereals if fortified with calcium and beverages, with considerable variation across geographic regions and ethnic groups. \u2022 Statutory or voluntary fortification with calcium can increase the calcium content of other foods. \u2022 Calcium bioavailability in healthy individuals averages 30%.\nBackground and rationale The contribution of different foods to the average daily intake of calcium varies with age, the individual\u2019s food preferences and national guidelines on food fortification. Dairy products are the largest contributor to dietary calcium intake in most children [ 29 ]. The main dietary sources of calcium in healthy adults are dairy products, cereals and beverages (non-alcoholic), although the contribution from dairy varies from 37% to 67% across different countries [ 30 ]. Of note, hard water from taps and some mineral waters can be important sources of calcium, contributing up to 500 mg/L [ 31 ]. The typical calcium content per portion of calcium-rich foods and the bioavailability of calcium [ 32 ] from these sources are shown in Table 1 .\nCalcium is often added to foods by manufacturers, either for fortification or as a food additive (used as food color or preservative) [ 33 ]. Calcium fortification of foods such as bread and wheat flour is mandated in some countries like the UK. Also, calcium is often added to breakfast cereals and drinks, particularly those consumed by children, which contributes variable amounts to the dietary intake. The actual calcium content of processed products vary considerably depending on the production methods and brand, and nutrient composition tables may not provide accurate estimates of the added calcium.\nIn healthy individuals, approximately 30% of dietary calcium is absorbed [ 34 ], but this depends on the food source and subjectrelated factors, ranging from 5% to 82% (Fig. 2 ). Physiological variations in calcium absorption are strongly influenced by age, being highest in infancy and adolescence [ 20 ], virtually doubling during pregnancy [ 35 ], and decreasing after the age of 40 years [ 36 ].\nBalance studies have shown that the fractional calcium absorption is inverse to calcium intake when the intake is very low and reaches a threshold at higher intakes; approximately 45% absorption was seen at low intakes (200 mg) and 15% at intakes over 2000 mg [ 36 ]. Vitamin D status may also influence calcium absorption and is discussed in subsequent sections. Milk, dairy products, some mineral waters and fortified foods have a calcium bioavailability between 30% and 40%, whereas it is < 10% for vegetables and fruit [ 37 , 38 ]. Phytates, oxalates, phosphate and fatty acids bind calcium in the gut to form insoluble calcium salts thereby reducing calcium absorption. Studies investigating whether the fractional calcium absorption is related to gastric acidity show heterogeneous results in healthy controls [ 39 \u201344 ]. Case-mix, vari-\nable test conditions, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and analytical issues likely explain this heterogeneity. Recent data demonstrating low calcium absorption in patients after gastric bypass surgery or sleeve gastrectomy emphasize the role of the stomach in calcium bioavailability [ 45 , 46 ]. Importantly, individuals on a phosphate-restricted diet are likely to have a low dietary calcium intake as most foods that contain phosphate are also natural sources of calcium [ 29 ].\nEstimating an individual\u2019s calcium intake Clinical practice points: \u2022 An estimate of the total calcium intake should consider con-\ntributions from diet and medications (including calcium supplements and calcium-containing phosphate binders). \u2022 A self-administered questionnaire or diet history of a typical 24-h period can be used to rapidly identify the main sources of dietary calcium. \u2022 A 3-day prospective diet diary (food intake record) can be used when detailed information is required. \u2022 The calcium bioavailability from different foods should be considered when estimating net absorption.\nBackground and rationale An individual\u2019s usual calcium intake can be estimated using a variety of tools\u2014these are described in Table 2 together with their relative advantages and disadvantages [ 47 \u201349 ]. For a rapid bedside estimation, self-administered on-line calculators or a retrospective diet history of a typical 24-h period can be useful tools. The International Osteoporosis Foundation ( https://www.osteoporosis. foundation/educational-hub/topic/calcium-calculator) and the Royal Osteoporosis Society ( https://webapps.igc.ed.ac.uk/world/ research/rheumatological/calcium-calculator) provide free online calculators [ 50 , 51 ] that are quick and easy to use. Other national societies provide similar tools that take into account regional food choices and fortification practices.\nFor detailed analyses, a 3-day prospective diet diary/food intake record or a food frequency questionnaire can give a clinically useful estimate of intake [ 47 ], but can be time-consuming to administer and assess. A more detailed account of the consumption of specific dietary sources of calcium (such as milk, fortified cereals and additive-rich foods), together with portion sizes, can be determined by direct questioning, followed by analysis using country specific food composition databases or dietary analysis software. Importantly, the calcium intake from supplements or calcium-containing phosphate binders can contribute significantly to enteral calcium intake and must be considered in the overall calcium intake.\nQUESTION 2: WHAT ARE THE DETERMINANTS OF CALCIUM BALANCE IN CKD? Calcium intake and bioavailability in CKD Key evidence points \u2022 The average dietary calcium intake is 500\u2013900 mg/day in\nadults with CKD G3\u20134 and 400\u2013800 mg/day in CKD G5\u20135D. The average dietary calcium intake in children with CKD varies with age. \u2022 The dietary intake of calcium decreases with the progression of CKD. \u2022 The dietary intake of calcium shows regional variability, with notably lower intake in Asian countries.\nB I o d for.\n\u2022 Calcium salts may account for 60%\u201370% of total calcium intake if calcium-containing phosphate binders are used. \u2022 Calcium bioavailability is impaired in CKD, averaging 15%.\nackground and rationale n patients with CKD G3\u20135, whole-body calcium influx depends n calcium intake and bioavailability. In patients with CKD G5D, ialytic calcium mass transfers must additionally be accounted\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nData from cohort studies in patients with CKD show a daily dietary calcium intake of 400\u2013900 mg/day (Fig. 3 ) [ 52 \u201372 ]. The main dietary sources of calcium are bread (when fortified with calcium) and dairy foods [ 29 , 66 ]. As for most nutrients, dietary calcium intake decreases with the progression of CKD [ 53 , 59 ]. Besides uremic anorexia, dietary restrictions likely account for this decrease, since dietary phosphate restriction limits food items with high calcium content and bioavailability [ 29 , 34 ]. As in the general population [ 73 ], the dietary calcium intake varies across geographic regions and ethnic groups [ 72 ], with notably lower intake in Asian countries [ 59 , 70 ], reflecting the dietary preferences. Calcium-containing phosphate binders are an important source of calcium in patients with CKD G4\u20135D and can constitute up to 70% of the overall calcium intake [ 29 , 53 , 66 , 67 ].\nMany direct and indirect methods may be used to evaluate calcium bioavailability [ 74 ]. They have inherent limitations, and results obtained with different methods are not interchangeable and need to be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, characteristics of the study population (age, sex, habitual dietary calcium intake) [ 36 , 75 ] and of the test meal (composition, calcium content, extrinsically or intrinsically labeled, tracer carrier compound) may cause variability. Single and double stable or radioisotope tracer techniques are most often used in clinical research studies and inform on the apparent fractional absorption; analysis of concomitant stool collections allow for the calculation of net fractional absorption. Acknowledging that results have not been unequivocal, available clinical evidence indicate that calcium bioavailability by gastro-intestinal absorption decreases along the progression of CKD, with the apparent fractional absorption averaging 15% in the CKD population as a whole, i.e. about\nhalf the value obtained in healthy controls [ 76 \u201378 ]. Reasons for this decreased calcium bioavailability in CKD may include altered gut physiology, hypovitaminosis D, vitamin D hyporesponsiveness, hypogonadism or combinations thereof, as detailed below.\nGastric acid secretion may be impaired in CKD, both by idiopathic and iatrogenic mechanisms [ 79 ]. Reduced expression or dysfunction of the calcium-sensing receptor is a common finding in CKD [ 80 ], and based on recent experimental data, associates with impaired H + -ATPase-mediated gastric acid secretion [ 81 ]. In addition, up to 90% of patients with CKD are treated with PPIs [ 82 ], which are potent blockers of the H + -K + -ATPase. Thus, multiple factors leading to gastric acid secretion blockade may account for pronounced hypochlorhydria, if not achlorhydria, in patients with CKD. Given that a low gastric pH is critical for solubilization and ionization of calcium salts present in foods (discussed above), uremic and iatrogenic hypo- and achlorhydria may be an important factor contributing to calcium malabsorption.\nCKD associates with low circulating levels of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, which is known to enhance transepithelial calcium transport. Active vitamin D derivatives increase, but do not normalize, calcium absorption in patients receiving hemodialysis [ 83 ]. Conversely, nutritional vitamin D supplements fail to improve calcium absorption, both in healthy controls [ 84 , 85 ] and in patients with CKD [ 86 ]. These findings challenge the importance of nutritional vitamin D in intestinal calcium absorption. Most likely, nutritional vitamin D supplementation only has a clinically meaningful positive impact on calcium absorption when vitamin D is severely depleted and calcium intake is low [ 10 , 87 ]. Rather than increased gastrointestinal absorption, an increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption and/or skeletal calcium release may be hypothesized to explain the increased calcium levels in individuals treated with active vitamin D derivatives.\nMost of the dietary calcium is absorbed in the small intestine, while the large intestine accounts for only 6%\u201310% of the total calcium absorbed. Carbohydrate fermentation may foster colonic calcium absorption, but may be very low in CKD given a restricted intake of potassium-rich fruit and vegetables, which have a high content of dietary fiber and fermentable carbohydrates.\nCalcium losses in CKD Key evidence point \u2022 Urinary calcium excretion decreases early in the course of\nCKD prior to homeostatic hormonal changes and parallels kidney function decline, to average 40 mg/day at CKD G3. \u2022 Endogenous fecal calcium losses are estimated at 100\u2013200 mg/day.\nBackground and rationale In patients with CKD G2\u20135 not yet on dialysis, whole-body calcium efflux occurs through urinary and fecal losses, with small amounts also lost through the skin, hair and nails (limited to \u223c40\u201360 mg/day, and probably not affected by CKD). The 24-h urinary calcium losses show a stepwise decline across CKD stages, reaching amounts as low as 22 mg/day in patients with CKD G4 [ 53 , 88 , 89 ]. A low degree of calciuria is seen even in CKD G2\u2013 3, before any changes in regulatory calciotrophic hormones are detected. This observation points to a decreased filtered calcium load as a main driver of low calciuria. The fractional urinary excretion of calcium also decreases with CKD severity.

In healthy, middle-aged women, a urinary alcium < 40 mg/day is indicative of either calcium malabsorpion, very low calcium intake, excessive digestive juice secretion r bone hunger (e.g. from osteoblastic metastases) [ 91 ]. Prelimiary data from stable isotope studies indicate that even in chilren and young adults with CKD, bone resorption prevails [ 92 ]. he low urinary calcium in CKD patients could therefore suggest low intestinal calcium absorption, even to such a degree that enogenous losses exceed intestinal absorption, at least in a subset f patients. Fecal calcium losses include malabsorbed calcium and en-\nogenous intestinal losses originating from sloughed epithelial ells and digestive juice secretion. The latter losses are estiated at 100\u2013200 mg/day [ 93 , 94 ]. Determinants remain poorly efined [ 93 ]. It is probable that endogenous fecal calcium loss is largely unregulated drain on the calcium economy [ 91 ]. Data\nd\nn endogenous intestinal calcium losses in CKD are very limited 94 ].\nialytic calcium mass transfer in CKD G5D ey evidence points \u2022 In addition to the calcium load from diet and medications,\ndialytic calcium mass transfer must be considered when assessing calcium balance in maintenance dialysis patients. \u2022 Dialytic calcium mass transfer is determined by plasma-todialysis fluid ionized calcium gradient, dialysis session duration, ultrafiltration rate and skeletal remodeling rate.\nackground and rationale n patients receiving maintenance dialysis therapy, calcium alance is more complex; in addition to calcium contributed rom diet and medications, dialytic calcium mass transfer ust be considered.

It should be acknowledged that the ionized (free) dialysis fluid calcium concentration is only 80%\u201395% of the calcium concentration indicated on the label, and even lower when using citrate as an acid buffer [ 96 \u201398 ]. Compared with acetate-based dialysis fluid, citrate-based dialysis fluids reduce serum calcium [ 99 ], and this effect may be exaggerated in online hemodiafiltration [ 100 ]. Of note, the balance of serum ionized to complexed calcium is affected by pH, which can be modified by the buffer concentration in the dialysis fluid; decreasing the bicarbonate content may decrease calcium mass transfer by reducing the patient plasma-to-dialysis fluid ionized calcium gradient. A dialysis fluid calcium of 1.25 mmol/L (2.5 mEq/L) associates with a neutral [ 101 ], if not negative [ 102 , 103 ], dialytic calcium mass transfer in hemodialysis patients. In peritoneal dialysis patients, dialytic calcium mass transfer is generally neutral with a dialysis fluid calcium of 1.25 mmol/L, depending upon ultrafiltration [ 104 , 105 ], with higher likelihood of a positive mass transfer when the peritoneal dialysis program includes icodextrin exchanges (dialysis fluid calcium 1.75 mmol/L, or 3.5 mEq/L) and when ultrafiltration is low [ 105 ]. Taken together, a dialysis fluid calcium of 1.25\u20131.50 mmol/L (2.5\u20133.0 mEq/L) should achieve a near-neutral calcium transfer during dialysis in most patients.\nIt is unclear whether hemodiafiltration results in a greater calcium efflux through convective clearance and a larger fluid exchange compared with hemodialysis for a given dialysis fluid calcium concentrations. Studies suggest that post-dilution hemodiafiltration shows similar results on calcium balance as hemodialysis [ 96 , 106 ]. However, pre-dilution hemodiafiltration, achieving even larger volumes of fluid exchange and convective clearance, may result in greater shifts in calcium, depending on the calcium and bicarbonate concentrations of the dialysis fluid [ 98 ]. It has been demonstrated that PTH decreases, and ionized calcium increases, when bicarbonate is used as the dialysate buffer, whereas the opposite is seen with acetate [ 99 ]. Patients on long hours of daily or nocturnal hemodialysis are prone to hypocalcaemia and may need a higher dialysis fluid calcium concentration: a randomized study in patients on nocturnal hemodialysis who received either \u201cnormal\u201d (1.3 mmol/L, n = 24) or high (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26) calcium in the dialysis fluid for 1 year showed a significant decrease in serum calcium and increase in PTH in the low calcium group, with no change in the abdominal aortic calcification score in either group [ 107 ].\nQUESTION 3: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED DAILY INTAKE OF CALCIUM IN PATIENTS WITH CKD ACROSS STAGES AND AGE/SEX CATEGORIES? Recommended daily intake of calcium in CKD Key evidence points \u2022 Whole-body calcium balance studies, although difficult to\nperform, are essential to make conclusive recommendations for calcium intake from diet or medications. \u2022 Whole-body calcium balance is unrelated to (soft or bone) tissue calcium balance. Skeletal demineralization may maintain serum calcium levels within a normal range, but this internal shift of calcium would not be reflected in whole-body calcium balance studies.\nClinical practice points \u2022 In children with CKD, we suggest a total elemental calcium\nintake within the age-appropriate normal range. \u2022 In adults with CKD, we suggest a minimum total elemental\ncalcium intake of 800\u20131000 mg/day to maintain a neutral calcium balance. \u2022 In adults with CKD, we suggest not to exceed a total elemental calcium intake of 1500 mg/day to avoid hypercalcemia and risk of vascular calcification. \u2022 In children or adults with CKD, a higher calcium intake may be appropriate in special circumstances such as for patients with re-mineralization of the skeleton (\u201chungry bone syndrome\u201d), those on intensified dialysis regimens or in physiological conditions requiring additional calcium supply (rapid growth in infancy or adolescence and during pregnancy and lactation).\nBackground and rationale A careful medical and nutritional history may provide some insight into the adequacy of calcium intake. However, due to the multifactorial nature of dysregulated calcium homeostasis in CKD, determining the optimal dietary calcium requirement is challenging and depends on the investigation of calcium balance.\nFormal balance studies are the gold standard to evaluate the calcium balance but are complex and difficult to conduct. They require timed collections of urine and feces, often combined with isotope techniques to assess kinetics, and should be performed\nTable 3: An example of the factorial approach to recommended daily calcium intake\u2014a estimation of calcium losses based on available evidence and a calculation of the intake of calcium that would be needed to counteract these losses.\nSkeletal Ca accretion Urinary Ca, mg Endogenous intestinal Ca, mg Dermal Ca, mg Total Ca loss, mg FACa, %\nRecommended daily intake, mg\nAdult, non-CKD 0 \u2013120 \u2013100 \u201350 \u2013270 30% 900 Adult CKD 0 \u201340 \u2013100 \u201350 \u2013190 20% 950 Adult CKD 0 \u201340 \u2013100 \u201350 \u2013190 15% 1250 Adult CKD 0 \u201340 \u2013200 \u201350 \u2013290 20% 1450 Adult CKD 0 0 \u2013200 \u201350 \u2013250 15% 1650\nCa, calcium; FA, fractional absorption.\ni s p C n w t P c c P t t r ( p ( t ( t\nt t r i b v r o n\nt c s H t b t p p\na a m c r a a I\nCalcium fluxes between bone and soft tissues\nDiet\nUrine Feces\nExchangeable Ca pool (blood, soft tissue, extracellular space)\nDialysis\nMedications\nSweat\nExogenous Ca fluxes\nEndogenous Ca fluxes\nCa2+\nFigure 4: Exogenous and endogenous calcium fluxes; calcium loading can occur through diet, medications, mass transfer during dialysis\u2014or as an internal shift from the skeleton due to bone resorption.\nt i m o u a\nt d a r t d t r t p k C t d s l\nc C c a b i i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nn steady state to allow for proper interpretation. Formal balance tudies are thus cumbersome and limited to only two studies in atients with CKD [ 94 , 108 ]. In a crossover study, six patients with KD G3\u20134 consumed controlled high- (2000 mg/day) or low-toormal calcium diets (800 mg/day) for 9 days. Calcium balance as slightly negative to neutral in both patients and healthy conrols on the low-calcium diet ( \u221291 \u00b1 113 vs \u2212144 \u00b1 174 mg/day, > .05) and more positive in patients than in controls on the highalcium diet (759 \u00b1 120 vs 464 \u00b1 225 mg/day, P < .05). Serum calium and phosphate concentrations were unchanged, and intact TH and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels decreased in subjects on he high-calcium diet [ 108 ]. A further study examined eight paients with CKD G3\u20134 in a 3-week crossover trial. Patients were andomly assigned to a controlled calcium intake of 2457 mg/day 1500 mg of elemental calcium from calcium carbonate used as hosphate binder + 957 mg/day of dietary calcium) or placebo 957 mg/day of dietary calcium). Calcium balance was neutral in he placebo group and positive in the calcium carbonate group 61 vs 508 mg/day, P = .002). Serum calcium, phosphate and inact PTH concentrations were unchanged in both groups [ 94 ]. Despite major limitations including small sample size, quesionable steady state conditions and analytical shortcomings, hese balance studies represent the highest level of evidence curently available. In aggregate, they indicate that a dietary calcium ntake of 800\u20131000 mg/day may be adequate to maintain calcium alance in patients with CKD G3\u20134 who are not receiving active itamin D derivatives. These values are identical to the estimated equirement for healthy adults > 25 years of age and to the recmmendation by the 2020 KDOQI clinical practice guidelines on utrition [ 109 ]. At a calcium intake of 1500\u20132000 mg/day, calcium balance urns positive. Given the huge burden of vascular and soft tissue alcification in CKD, it is tempting to speculate that extraosseous ites are the primary repository for excess exogenous calcium. owever, there is no conclusive evidence to support this assumpion, and it should be considered whether (re)-mineralization of one occurs initially, or in parallel. It could be hypothesized that he risk of vascular calcification is highest when the skeletal comartment is \u201csaturated\u201d or unresponsive, fostered by (episodic) hyercalcemia [ 110 ]. While children and young adults require a positive calcium bal-\nnce to mineralize the growing skeleton, a neutral calcium balnce should be aimed for in mature adults after the peak bone ass is achieved in the mid-30s. This implies that the rate of calium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract should match the ate of losses from the body through the bowel, kidneys, skin, hair nd nails. Whole-body calcium balance studies and factorial itertion may help to define the recommended daily calcium intake. n the latter approach, the recommended elemental calcium in-\nake is calculated by imputing estimated average losses modelng different scenarios. Using this approach, an estimated recomended daily intake of elemental calcium would be in the range f 950 to 1650 mg/day in patients with CKD (Table 3 ). These figres should be interpreted cautiously, considering the multiple ssumptions. Importantly, whole-body calcium balance needs to be disinguished from tissue calcium balance (Fig. 4 ). Bone mineral ensity (BMD) is lower in patients with CKD as compared with ge- and sex-matched healthy individuals [ 111 , 112 ]. Along with ecent data from stable isotope studies [ 92 ], this points to a negaive skeletal calcium balance in CKD. Skeletal calcium efflux, meiated by osteoclastic bone resorption, may be crucial to mainain normocalcemia in patients with CKD, as illustrated by the apid drop of serum calcium in a substantial proportion of paients following potent antiresorptive therapy [ 113 ]. Conversely, rogression of vascular calcification paralleling the decline of idney function denotes a positive vascular calcium balance in KD. Of interest, bone demineralization and vascular calcificaion are closely linked and referred to as the calcification paraox of CKD [ 114 , 115 ]. It may be speculated that internal calcium hifts from bone to vasculature, rather than exogenous calcium oading account for the huge vascular calcification burden in CKD. A mere handful of studies have investigated the effect of alcium supplementation against placebo or no treatment in KD, all of them small, of short duration ( < 6 months) and foused on mineral metabolism parameters [ 116 \u2013119 ]. Additionlly, three studies of calcium vs non-calcium based phosphate inders included a placebo or dietary intervention group, allowng for a comparison of calcium vs control [ 120 \u2013122 ]. These studes all show that calcium supplementation ameliorates secondary\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nhyperparathyroidism and decreases the prevalence of hypocalcemia, at the cost of an increased risk of hypercalcemia.\nA number of studies have compared calcium- and noncalcium-containing phosphate binders, most of which focused on safety outcomes, i.e. vascular calcification progression (Table 4 ). No increased risk of vascular calcification progression seems to be present with elemental calcium supplementation < 1000 mg/day [ 120 , 122 \u2013124 ]. At elemental calcium supplementation > 1200 mg/day, that is, on top of dietary calcium intake, 9 out of 10 studies found an increased risk of vascular calcification progression with calcium supplementation, along with an increased risk of hypercalcemia.\nFor hard endpoints, two larger studies failed to demonstrate a survival benefit of non-calcium- vs calcium-containing phosphate binders [ 125 , 126 ]. In the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited (DCOR) trial study, 2103 US patients receiving hemodialysis were randomized to sevelamer vs calcium-containing phosphate binders in the form of calcium acetate (70%; mean elemental calcium 1325 mg/day) or calcium carbonate (30%; mean elemental calcium 1960 mg/day), and 1068 patients completed the study with a median follow-up of 20 months. There were no differences in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in the overall cohort, but patients > 65 years had a lower mortality rate with sevelamer [ 125 ]. In the recently published Outcome Study of Lanthanum Carbonate Compared With Calcium Carbonate in Hemodialysis Patients (LANDMARK) Study, 2374 Japanese patients receiving hemodialysis, with more than one risk factor for cardiovascular disease, were randomized to lanthanum or calcium carbonate (median elemental calcium 600 mg/day), and 1851 patients completed the trial with a median 3.2 years of followup. There was no difference in all-cause mortality, but patients treated with lanthanum carbonate had increased risk of cardiovascular death, i.e. challenging the initial hypothesis [ 126 ]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses differ in their conclusions regarding any survival benefit of non-calcium vs calcium containing phosphate binders (Table 5 ) [ 127 \u2013132 ]. The most consistent finding, in both CKD G3\u20135 and CKD G5D, is a survival benefit with sevelamer use [ 128 , 129 , 131 ].\nLimitations of these studies should be acknowledged. Information on dietary calcium intake is generally not included, preventing an evaluation of total calcium exposure. Furthermore, there is evidence of pleiotropic benefits of sevelamer (lowering lipids, advanced glycation end-products and inflammatory parameters) which could contribute to the survival benefit with this specific binder. Interestingly, in the Calcium Acetate Renagel Evaluation2 (CARE-2) Study, the addition of a statin to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol resulted in no difference in the progression of vascular calcification between patients receiving calcium acetate (1375 mg/day elemental calcium) vs sevelamer [ 133 ].\nOverall, these studies focused on safety outcomes and did not assess skeletal endpoints. Calcium supplementation consistently decreases PTH to a greater degree than non-calcium containing phosphate binders despite similar control of phosphate [ 122 , 125 , 126 , 134 \u2013141 ] and also lowers bone turnover, both as assessed by bone biopsy [ 142 \u2013145 ] and by biomarkers [ 138 , 146 , 147 ]. Although this effect is most consistent in studies with higher doses of supplemented calcium, it is also reported with lower doses and without overt hypercalcemia [ 122 ]. Reduced severity of secondary hyperparathyroidism may explain the increase in BMD seen in some studies [ 117 , 121 ], though this is not a consistent finding [ 124 , 146 , 148 ]. In the LANDMARK trial [ 126 ], supplementation with 600\u2013 1200 mg/day of elemental calcium did not decrease the risk of hip fractures in Japanese patients receiving hemodialysis [ 126 ]; no\nother studies investigating fracture endpoints are currently available.\nIn aggregate, clinical trials indicate excess risk with elemental calcium supplementation > 1200 mg/day added to the dietary calcium intake (which averages 400\u2013900 mg/day), and calcium balance studies demonstrate a positive calcium balance with total elemental calcium intake > 1500 mg/day in patients with CKD. We consider 1500 mg/day to be the safe upper limit of daily calcium intake. Of note, this is lower than the safe upper limit of 2000 mg/day set by the 2003 KDOQI guidelines [ 8 ].\nRecommended daily calcium intake in children and young adults with CKD As with healthy children, children with CKD require adequate calcium for skeletal mineralization, particularly during periods of active growth. Mineralization defects are more commonly seen in children than adults with CKD and strongly correlate with the CKD grade and calcium status: by bone histology studies 90% of children on peritoneal dialysis have deficient bone mineralization [ 149 ], and mineralization defects are noted even in very early CKD G2 before changes in serum calcium, phosphate or PTH are detected [ 150 ]. On imaging studies, a lower tibial cortical BMD was associated with low serum calcium and high PTH level, particularly in growing children [ 151 ] and this correlated with a higher fracture risk. Conversely, vascular calcification, with its associated high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, is also seen in children and young adults, and has been associated with a high calcium intake [ 152 \u2013155 ] as well as CKD grade [ 153 , 154 , 156 ]. In young adults on dialysis, the coronary artery calcification score was shown to double within 20 months [ 157 ], and worsening of the calcification score was associated with a higher serum calcium and prescription of calcium-containing phosphate binders [ 157 , 158 ]. In a recent study including 100 children and young adults with CKD G4\u20135D, vascular calcification was noted even as BMD increased, although a presumed buffering capacity of the growing skeleton may offer some protection against extraosseous calcification [ 13 ].\nThere are no studies to indicate the appropriate amount of calcium for a child with CKD, and calcium requirements need to be individualized depending on the patient\u2019s age, growth and rate of bone turnover. Importantly, extrapolation of data from adult studies is not appropriate, as the growing skeleton of children has significantly higher calcium requirements than a mature, possibly osteoporotic, adult skeleton. In the absence of evidence-based studies, it would be reasonable to provide children with CKD a comparable calcium intake (including calcium from diet, phosphate binders and supplements) to their healthy peers. These concepts have been discussed at length by the Paediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce [ 14 ].\nRecommended dialysis fluid calcium concentrations Clinical practice points \u2022 We suggest using a dialysis fluid calcium concentration of\n1.25\u20131.50 mmol/L (2.5\u20133.0 mEq/L) in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis to maintain a neutral calcium mass transfer during dialysis. \u2022 We suggest that a dialysis fluid calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol/L (3.5 mEq/L) be restricted to situations where a positive calcium balance is intended.\nTa b le\n4:\nR is k as\nso ci at ed\nw it h ca\nlc iu m\nvs\nn on\n-c al ci u m\nco\nn ta in in g p h os\np h at e b in d er s, by\nd os\ne of\nel em\nen ta l ca\nlc iu m\nsu\np p le m en\nte d (d ie ta ry\nca\nlc iu m\nn ot\nin cl u d ed\n).\nS tu\ndy\nPo p u la ti on\nN\nFo ll ow\n-u p\nIn te rv en\nti on\nEl em\nen ta l ca\nlc iu m\nby su\np p le m en\nt H yp\ner ca\nlc em\nia\nV C p ro\ngr es\nsi on\n20 18\nK ov\nes d y [ 1 22\n] C K D 3\u2013\n4 12\n0 12\nm on\nth s\nLa n th\nan u m , C\na,\nco n tr ol\n33 6 m g/ d ay\nN o d if fe re n ce\nN o in cr ea\nse d ri sk\nof V C p ro gr es\nsi on\nw it h C a\n20 18\nFu\nji i [ 12\n3 ]\nC K D 5D\n(H\nD )\n10 5\n18 m on\nth s\nLa n th\nan u m\nvs\nC a\nM ed\nia n 60\n0 m g/ d ay\nC a sl ig h tl y h ig h er\nN o in cr ea\nse d ri sk\nof V C p ro gr es\nsi on\nw it h C a\n20 07\nR u ss o [ 1 20\n] C K D 3\u2013\n5 90\n24\nm on\nth s\nSe ve\nla m er , C\na,\nco n tr ol\n80 0 m g/ d ay\nC a sl ig h tl y h ig h er\nN o in cr ea\nse d ri sk\nw it h C a, b u t\nd ec\nre as\ned ri sk\nw it h se\nve la m er\n20 15\nW ad\na [ 1 24\n] C K D 5D\n(H\nD ) +\nD M 2\n41\n24 m on\nth s\nLa n th\nan u m\nvs\nC a\nM ea\nn 10\n50 m g/ d ay\nN o d if fe re n ce\nN o in cr ea\nse d ri sk\nof V C p ro gr es\nsi on\nw it h C a\n20 02\nC h er to w [ 1 34\n] C K D 5D\n20\n0 12\nm on\nth s\nSe ve\nla m er\nvs\nC a\nM ea\nn 11\n50 m g/ d ay\nor 15\n00 m g/ d ay\nH ig h er\nri sk\n;

Originally, the standard dialysate calcium was designed to match patients\u2019 serum ionized calcium levels, i.e. a dialysate calcium concentration of 1.25 mmol/L (2.5 mEq/L) was preferred. Later, the use of higher dialysate calcium was advocated to control secondary hyperparathyroidism. Following the introduction of calciumcontaining phosphate binders and active vitamin D derivatives, the combined use of these medical therapies and a high dialysate calcium often led to hypercalcemia. The KDOQI guidelines therefore recommended a dialysate calcium of 1.25 mmol/L as the \u201ccurrently most convenient\u201d standard, allowing for simultaneous use of the above-mentioned therapy. The KDOQI guidelines stressed that there were no data to document that any particular calcium dialysate was safer, more effective or associated with fewer complications. Though interventional studies investigating the effect of different dialysate calcium on outcomes existed at this time, it was considered impossible to draw firm conclusions from these data, due to the marked changes in the medical treatment of mineral metabolism that had occurred in this time period [ 7 , 8 , 11 ]. The later KDIGO guidelines also recommended a lower calcium concentration in the dialysate as standard, to avoid calcium loading [ 7 ].\nA dialysis fluid calcium concentration of 1.25\u20131.50 mmol/L (2.5\u2013 3.0 mEq/L) should ensure a near-neutral calcium transfer during dialysis, as detailed in Question 2. A lower dialysis fluid calcium concentration ( < 1.25 mmol/L) may increase skeletal calcium efflux and also the risk of hemodynamic instability [ 159 ]. Two RCTs reported reduced progression of vascular calcification with dialysis fluid calcium 1.25 vs 1.50 mmol/L [ 160 , 161 ], while others reported no difference when comparing these two calcium concentrations [ 162 , 163 ]. No survival benefit was observed when dialysis fluid calcium was lowered from 1.50 to 1.25 mmol/L [ 164 , 165 ]. A retrospective study comparing hemodialysis facilities that switched the standard dialysis fluid calcium concentration from 1.25 mmol/L to < 1.25 mmol/L observed greater rates of intradialytic hypotension and hospitalization for heart failure with the\nlower dialysis fluid calcium [ 166 ]. Levels of PTH and phosphate increased, as did the use of phosphate binders, active vitamin D derivatives, and calcimimetics in centers converting to dialysis fluid calcium < 1.25 mmol/L. There was no difference in all-cause mortality; thus, there seem to be little benefit in reducing dialysis fluid calcium concentrations below 1.25 mmol/L [ 166 ].\nUse of a higher dialysis fluid calcium (1.75 mmol/L; 3.5 mEq/L) has been associated with increased all-cause mortality [ 167 , 168 ] and progression of vascular calcification [ 169 ]. In an RCT by Ok et al., 425 patients with PTH levels < 300 pg/mL were randomized to dialysis fluid calcium 1.25 vs 1.75 mmol/L for 2 years. During this time, coronary artery calcification score by computed tomography increased in both groups, but the rate of progression was greater with use of dialysis fluid calcium of 1.75 mmol/L [ 169 ].\nAltogether, it is reasonable to assume that a dialysis fluid calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol/L will lead to a positive calcium mass transfer during dialysis, which may contribute to progression of vascular calcification. A benefit of reducing calcium concentration in the dialysis fluid from 1.50 to 1.25 mmol/L seems uncertain, and dialysis fluid calcium < 1.25 mmol/L may cause harm due to cardiovascular instability.\nTheoretically, optimal dialysis fluid calcium concentration could contribute to better control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and to maintenance of bone health. Increased levels of PTH are a consistent finding when reducing calcium concentration in the dialysis fluid [ 107 , 163 , 166 ] and may be accompanied by increases in bone turnover markers [ 170 , 171 ]. On the other hand, lowering dialysis fluid calcium decreases the prevalence of low bone turnover on bone biopsies [ 169 ]. Thus, it could be argued that dialysis fluid calcium concentration should be individualized for optimal calcium balance.\nAssessing an individual\u2019s calcium requirements in clinical practice Key evidence points \u2022 A serum calcium level does not reflect calcium balance as it\nis tightly controlled through hormonal regulation.\nBone turnover markers\nDiet\nBone imagingBiomarkers\nCalcium status\nDietary survey/ calculator\nCa-containing phosphate-binders\nor supplements\nAssessment\nIntervention\nCa transfer during dialysis\nCalcium in dialysis fluid\nFigure 5: Assessment of calcium status in patients with CKD.

For patients on kidney replacement therapy, calcium mass transfer during dialysis must be considered. High bone biomarkers and low bone density may indicate calcium efflux from the skeleton, which should be addressed. If a calcium deficit is revealed, dietary intervention is preferred, and any supplementation should be by calcium-containing phosphate binders if phosphorus is high.\nC\nB I i m ( m a\nt m\nb Q t d n c t o p\nm a c e t t d i i h c m [\nc a d t r s i f s\nc t p A\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n\u2022 Serum PTH level is a poor biomarker of bone turnover status and calcium homeostasis as PTH lacks specificity and shows high biological and inter-assay variability. linical practice points \u2022 We recommend that patients with CKD receive individualized dietary counseling, preferably by a qualified dietitian. \u2022 In children with CKD, we suggest that the diet is regularly assessed for total calcium content. The frequency of assessment is based on the child\u2019s age, CKD grade and trends in serum calcium, phosphorus and PTH. \u2022 In adults with CKD, we suggest assessing calcium status routinely at first presentation, every 12 months, and when clinically indicated (unexplained hypo- and hypercalcemia, prior to initiating or adjusting therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism or osteoporosis). \u2022 The following groups of patients are at greater risk of calcium deficiency or reduced calcium absorption and require close monitoring of their calcium intake: children during periods of rapid growth, elderly patients, patients with specific dietary preferences (vegans, vegetarians), patients in CKD G5-5D, patients on phosphate-restricted diets, patients with malabsorption or on PPIs and patients with severe vitamin D deficiency. \u2022 Treatment decisions should be based on trends in serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, alkaline phosphatase and 25 dihydroxy vitamin D, considered together. \u2022 The whole-body calcium status of an individual may be estimated by evaluating the calcium intake (from diet and calcium-containing medications) and calcium mass transfer from dialysis, together with biomarkers of mineral metabolism and bone turnover, and bone imaging.\nackground and rationale n clinical practice, dietary surveys, biochemical parameters and maging techniques, preferentially in concert, may help to estiate the calcium status and balance in the individual patient Fig. 5 ). Given the complex inter-dependency of these CKD-MBD easures, it is important to consider trends in levels rather than single value, as suggested in the KDIGO CKD-MBD recommenda-\nions [ 7 ]. Obviously, one size does not fit all also applies to calcium anagement of patients with CKD across stages of disease. Daily calcium intake, both from diet and supplements can e estimated by means of formal dietary history/recall (see uestion 1, Estimating an individual\u2019s calcium intake) or quesionnaires, including user-friendly online calculators, simple valiated score systems and more extensive food frequency questionaires [ 172 , 173 ]. The estimation of calcium intake should become ommon practice in the work-up of CKD-MBD at first presentaion, and when indicated, e.g. in patients with unexplained hypor hypercalcemia, and prior to initiating or adjusting therapy in atients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteoporosis. Serum calcium levels are strictly maintained through horonal control. They do not reflect overall body calcium balance nd may not be very informative except at extremes. Using serum alcium levels as a proxy of calcium balance may lead to inadquate, and sometimes deleterious, clinical decisions [ 174 ]. Furhermore, only the \u201cfree\u201d or unbound calcium is biologically acive, and so albumin-corrected calcium and total calcium levels o not necessarily reflect the correct serum calcium, particularly n CKD patients with alterations in pH, anion gap and circulatng plasma proteins [ 175 \u2013177 ]. Not surprisingly, true hypo- and ypercalcemia (by ionized calcium levels) are associated with inreased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with apparent norocalcemia based on total or albumin-corrected calcium levels 178 , 179 ]. Exogenous calcium deprivation triggers PTH synthesis and seretion, rendering PTH a candidate biomarker of calcium balnce. Circulating levels of biointact PTH in CKD, however, are etermined by many factors beyond calcium status, most noably phosphate levels [ 180 , 181 ]. Further, there is end-organ hypoesponsiveness to PTH in CKD, leading to a reduced calcemic reponse [ 182 \u2013184 ]. PTH as a biomarker is fraught with limitations, ncluding high biological variability and variable retention of PTH ragments [ 185 ]. PTH, therefore, is a poor biomarker of calcium tatus. Shifts of calcium from the skeletal store can be assessed by onsidering skeletal remodeling rates and bone demineralizaion. Skeletal remodeling can be determined by bone histomorhometry or estimated by circulating bone turnover markers. high bone turnover assists in maintaining calcium levels by\nTable 6: Elemental calcium content and phosphorus binding capacity of commonly used calcium salts.\nDosage Elemental calcium (%)\nPhosphorus binding (mg/g) Calcium absorption (%) Comments\nPhosphate binders\nCalcium carbonate [ 199 \u2013201 ]\nTablets, 500 mg 40 19 39 Dependent on acidity for dissolution.

High levels of bone turnover markers are thus indicative of current skeletal calcium efflux. Low BMD by imaging techniques such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or quantitative computed tomography reflect calcium drain from the skeleton over a longer time period (years). High levels of bone turnover markers associate with increased risk of fractures [ 186 \u2013188 ] and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 188 \u2013190 ] in the shortterm, and low BMD associates with poor overall long-term outcomes in CKD [ 187 , 191 \u2013194 ]. Preferred calcium source and intake conditions Clinical practice points \u2022 In patients with CKD we recommend optimizing calcium intake through the diet, rather than with supplements. \u2022 Advice on dietary calcium intake should consider calcium content and bioavailability, as well as adhering to dietary phosphate restrictions, if required, and ensuring an adequate protein intake. Adapt the dietary intake to respect planetary health whenever possible. \u2022 Calcium supplementation should be individualized, with consideration of calcium content and bioavailability, phosphate binding capacity and personal preferences. \u2022 In individuals who require a phosphate binder, consider using a calcium-based phosphate binder, as opposed to a calcium supplement, if dietary calcium intake is low. \u2022 For efficient phosphate binding, calcium salts (and other phosphate binding medications) must be given with meals. \u2022 Avoid combination of calcium citrate with aluminum containing medications.\nBackground and rationale Dairy may be the preferred source of calcium. In addition to a high calcium content and bioavailability, dairy products are rich in high quality protein. Dairy products, however, are also rich in phosphate. The recommendation to increase the consumption of dairy may thus conflict with the recommendation to restrict dietary phosphate. It should, however, be acknowledged that the latter recommendation is increasingly debated and that recent\nstudies have identified phosphate additives as the main contributor to hyperphosphatemia. Plant-based alternatives to dairy may be considered [ 195 ], not only because of their lower phosphate bioavailability, but also from a global \u201cone health\u201d perspective [ 34 ].\nCalcium supplements, preferably given as a phosphate binder, may be necessary when the dietary phosphate intake exceeds recommended limits so that the dietary intake of calcium cannot be readily increased. Calcium supplements vary in calcium content and bioavailability and in their phosphorus-binding capacity (Table 6 ) [ 196 , 197 ]. All calcium salts should be given with meals, if used as phosphate binders. Calcium carbonate should also preferentially be given with meals if used as a supplement, as dissolution is dependent on acidity [ 36 ], while calcium uptake of other calcium salts may be greater if given in-between meals [ 198 ]. Of the two most commonly used calcium-containing phosphate binders, calcium carbonate is less efficient in binding phosphorus compared with calcium acetate, thus requiring a higher dose and resulting in a greater elemental calcium load to achieve a similar phosphate control [ 199 \u2013201 ].\nQUESTION 4: WHAT IS THE APPROACH TO HYPO- AND HYPERCALCEMIA? Clinical practice points \u2022 We recommend to avoid hypercalcemia in children and adults\nwith CKD. \u2022 In cases of hypercalcemia, investigate and treat iatrogenic\ncauses first, by reducing calcium-containing medications, active vitamin D derivatives and/or dialysis fluid calcium. \u2022 Once iatrogenic causes of hypercalcemia have been addressed, investigate and treat pathological conditions associated with hypercalcemia such as sarcoidosis or malignancy. \u2022 We suggest treating acute, iatrogenic hypocalcemia (as seen after surgical parathyroidectomy, anti-resorptive therapies or calcimimetic use) with calcium supplementation, active vitamin D derivatives and/or temporary increase of dialysate calcium to 1.75 mmol/L, under careful monitoring. \u2022 We suggest pre-treatment with calcium-containing medications and active vitamin D derivatives in situations where\n2004 Block [ 202 ] CKD5D (HD) 40 538 1\u20132 years Alb.corr (Ionized) 8.0; 11.0 [2.00; 2.75] Linear All-cause and CV mortality 2005 Young [ 203 ] CKD5D (HD) 17 236 ?

Epidemiological studes in CKD show survival benefit when calcium is in the noral range [ 202 \u2013216 ]. The evidence is strongest for hypercalcemia, ith the risk curve often reported as linear or J-shaped; though he expected U-shape appears when a wider range of calcium is onsidered (Table 7 ). In addition, case-mix, assays used, variables ccounted for in adjusted analyses and statistical modeling aplied are likely sources of variability. For trends in serum calcium, hanges out of the normal range, in either direction, increase morality risk [ 215 , 217 ]. Hypercalcemia should be considered a pathological condition. ommon causes of hypercalcemia in CKD are iatrogenic (calcium upplements, calcium-containing phosphate binders, active vitain D derivatives, high calcium in the dialysis fluid) and the develpment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism [ 218 ]. Additional causes f hypercalcemia include malignancy, granulomatous disease (e.g. arcoidosis), thyroid disease and immobilization [ 219 ]. In cases f hypercalcemia, the underlying cause should always be invesigated, with iatrogenic causes identified and corrected first. Deelopment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism is suspected if hyperalcemia occurs concurrently with inappropriately elevated PTH evels. Further evaluations should be carried out as necessary to ule out other pathologies, particularly in cases of adequately supressed PTH. Hypocalcemia can be a life-threatening condition. Acute, se-\nere and/or symptomatic hypocalcemia should be promptly corected using calcium-supplementation (often intravenous), active itamin D derivatives and, in patients with CKD G5D receiving ialysis, by temporarily increasing the calcium concentration in he dialysis fluid to 1.75 mmol/L. Common iatrogenic causes if hypocalcemia in CKD are surgial parathyroidectomy, anti-resorptive therapy and calcimimetic\nse. In the \u201chungry bone syndrome\u201d following parathyroidectomy, he sudden reduction in PTH levels leads to unopposed calcium nflux into bone due to widespread bone (re-)mineralization [ 220 ]. his can cause severe and life-threatening hypocalcemia, requirng large amounts of calcium supplementation post-operatively 221 ]. Hungry bone syndrome occurs in approximately 25% of paients with CKD G5D after parathyroidectomy [ 222 , 223 ]. Lower alcium levels, higher PTH levels and higher bone turnover markrs prior to surgery predict the severity and duration of hypocalemia [ 224 ]. As the risk of hungry bone is linked to the severity of yperparathyroid bone disease, optimization of medical therapy eems a logical preventative strategy. Initiation of calcium suppleentation and active vitamin D derivatives pre-operatively [ 225 ] r immediately post-operatively [ 226 ] may limit the risk of severe ypocalcemia. Treatment with the short-acting bisphosphonate amidronate prior to surgery has also been shown to reduce the isk of hypocalcemia and shorten the duration of hospitalization ompared with historical controls [ 227 ]. However, this strategy ay seem counterintuitive as it would block (re-)mineralization of one that is recovering from hyperparathyroid bone disease, and ndeed, BMD increase was less marked in patients treated with amidronate in the abovementioned study [ 227 ]. With potent anti-resorptives such as denosumab, calcium efux from bone is abruptly reduced, due to osteoclast activity beng completely blocked [ 228 ]. This hypocalcemia could be considred an unmasking of an ongoing negative calcium balance\u2014a ependency on calcium efflux from the skeleton to maintain lowormal serum calcium levels. Skeletal calcium influx may also ccur, similar to hungry bone syndrome after parathyroidectomy, xplaining the substantial increases in BMD that can be seen in atients with CKD treated with denosumab. Consistent with this, igh levels of bone turnover markers, indicative of hyperparathyoid bone disease, prior to denosumab treatment predict the risk nd severity of hypocalcemia [ 113 ]. The risk of hypocalcemia after bisphosphonate use is low,\nut still substantially higher in patients with CKD when comared with others with normal kidney function. In a retrospective opulation-based cohort study from Canada, patients with CKD 5\u20135D had a 24% risk of mild (ionized calcium < 1.0 mmol/L) and\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfad185/7269225 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n15% risk of severe (ionized calcium < 0.9 mmol/L) hypocalcemia in the 6 months following initiation of denosumab therapy, compared with < 1% risk of both in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . For bisphosphonates, the risk was 2.4% for mild and 0.1% for severe hypocalcemia in patients with CKD G5\u20135D, compared with < 0.1% for both in those with an eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [ 229 ].\nTreatment with calcimimetics often results in a reduction in serum calcium levels. In the Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial ( N = 3861 patients with CKD G5D receiving hemodialysis), 58% of cinacalcet treated patients experienced hypocalcemia after treatment initiation, compared with 15% in the placebo arm. Severe hypocalcemia ( < 7.5 mg/dL or 1.87 mmol/L) was seen in 18% with cinacalcet treatment vs 4% of controls and associated with higher PTH, higher bone turnover markers and lower calcium levels at baseline, consistent with hypocalcemia resulting from reduced calcium efflux from the skeleton [ 230 ]. In a European hemodialysis cohort ( N = 905), all normocalcemic at baseline, two-thirds developed hypocalcemia during 12 months of cinacalcet therapy\u2014 severe hypocalcemia was seen in 9% [ 231 ]. Of note, neither of these trials found an association between treatment-related hypocalcemia and risk of hard outcomes (cardiovascular events and/or all-cause mortality). In a comparative meta-analysis, hypocalcemia was more common with use of the intravenous etelcalcetide than cinacalcet or evocalcet\u2014most likely due to a greater efficacy in lowering PTH levels [ 232 ]. Hypocalcemia related to the use of calcimimetics is often reported to be transient and self-limiting, and whether calcium supplementation would be indicated in this situation is debated [ 233 ]. In the trials already mentioned, hypocalcemic episodes lead to minimal changes in medical therapy [ 230 , 231 ]. However, hypocalcemia-related symptoms such as muscle cramps and paresthesia are reported to be twice as common with calcimimetics compared with placebo [ 234 ]. One RCT in children with CKD was terminated early due to a fatality linked to severe hypocalcemia in the cinacalcet arm [ 235 ]. Thus, it seems prudent to evaluate calcium status, and consider the need for calcium supplementation, prior to initiating calcimimetics. Children can be more prone to life-threatening seizures or arrhythmias, and a higher threshold of serum calcium levels has been suggested before initiating cinacalcet treatment [ 236 ].\nWith persistent hypocalcemia, an assessment of calcium status should be performed, to address potential deficits, as detailed in Question 2. The total intake of calcium (diet + medications) should be assessed, and for patients on kidney replacement therapy, calcium mass transfer during dialysis also needs to be considered. Although the recommended intake of calcium is not affected by the presence or severity of vascular calcification or osteoporosis, a negative calcium balance will exacerbate secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to bone resorption and demineralization. High levels of bone turnover markers, or decreases in bone mineral density on bone imaging, indicate shifts of calcium from the skeletal store, which may also need to be addressed (Fig. 5 ).\nRESULTS OF THE DELPHI SURVEY Of the 28 clinical practice points, all statements achieved an agreement higher than the pre-defined cut-off of 70% from the respondents, with over 90% agreement for all but one statement. Analyzing the level of agreement for each statement, an overall 83% consensus was achieved with a \u201cstrongly agree or agree\u201d response and a 12% \u201cneutral\u201d response, largely reflecting the wide variations in practice in the absence of robust evidence. The\nhighest \u201cdisagree or strongly disagree\u201d rate (18%) was in response to a statement under Question 3, \u201cPreferred calcium source and intake conditions\u201d on the timing of administration of calcium containing medications with or without food. Given that the absorption of elemental calcium from different calcium salts varies widely, with some requiring an acidic pH for dissolution, and that the binding of calcium to dietary phosphate will reduce its absorption, we modified this statement and added further explanations for the rationale in the text. Based on comments from Delphi respondents, additional clarification to the text was also provided in some sections.\nFUTURE RESEARCH We recommend the following areas of research to provide further evidence for optimal calcium balance in adults and children with CKD G2\u2013G5D:\n(i) Data on habitual calcium intake in children and adults with CKD are sparse and fragmentary. Additional large epidemiological studies are required to define calcium intake across stages of CKD and to identify determinants. (ii) Additional calcium balance studies across CKD G2\u2013G5 should be performed to determine calcium requirements at different ages and stages of CKD. (iii) Future calcium balance studies should include the evaluation of internal shifts in calcium, most notably skeletal calcium balance. (iv) Calcium absorption in children and adults at different CKD grades should be determined, using double-tracer labeled calcium isotope studies. (v) The interaction between common nutritional and pharmacological therapies (dietary fiber supplements, PPIs, etc.) and calcium absorption, and potential effects of such therapies on CKD-MBD-related outcomes, should be investigated. (vi) Whole-body calcium balance studies at different ages and grades of CKD should be performed, including patients treated with dialysis, across modalities. (vii) The effect of different dietary calcium intakes on bone turnover and mineralization should be investigated both in children and in adults, across different grades of CKD. (viii) The evolution of bone demineralization and vascular calcification in CKD patients who are calcium and vitamin D deficient vs those with an adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake should be investigated. (ix) The effect of calcium supplementation on relevant hard outcomes such as fractures, cardiovascular events and allcause mortality, should be investigated by RCTs.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This consensus work was supported by an unrestricted educational grant by Vifor CSL.\nAUTHORS\u2019 CONTRIBUTIONS P.E. and R.S. were responsible for the conception and design of this work.
