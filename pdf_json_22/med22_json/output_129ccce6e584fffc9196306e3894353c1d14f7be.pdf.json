    "abstractText": "Background. F-FDG PET/CT is widely used in the prognosis evaluation of tumor patients. e radiomics features can provide additional information for clinical prognostic assessment. Purpose. Purpose is to explore the prognostic value of radiomics features from dual-time F-FDG PET/CT images for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials and Methods. is retrospective study included 70 LAPC patients who received early and delayed F-FDG PET/CT scans before SBRT treatment. A total of 1188 quantitative imaging features were extracted from dual-time PET/CT images. To avoid over\u0096tting, the univariate analysis and elastic net were used to obtain a sparse set of image features that were applied to develop a radiomics score (Rad-score). en, the Harrell consistency index (C-index) was used to evaluate the prognosis model. Results. e Rad-score from dual-time images contains six features, including intensity histogram, morphological, and texture features. In the validation cohort, the univariate analysis showed that the Rad-score was the independent prognostic factor (p< 0.001, hazard ratio [HR]: 3.2). And in the multivariate analysis, the Rad-score was the only prognostic factor (p< 0.01, HR: 4.1) that was signi\u0096cantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients. In addition, according to cross-validation, the C-index of the prognosis model based on the Rad-score from dual-time images is better than the early and delayed images (0.720 vs. 0.683 vs. 0.583). Conclusion. e Rad-score based on dual-time F-FDG PET/CT images is a promising noninvasive method with better prognostic value.",

Purpose. Purpose is to explore the prognostic value of radiomics features from dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials and Methods. \u00a0is retrospective study included 70 LAPC patients who received early and delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT scans before SBRT treatment. A total of 1188 quantitative imaging features were extracted from dual-time PET/CT images. To avoid over tting, the univariate analysis and elastic net were used to obtain a sparse set of image features that were applied to develop a radiomics score (Rad-score). \u00a0en, the Harrell consistency index (C-index) was used to evaluate the prognosis model. Results. \u00a0e Rad-score from dual-time images contains six features, including intensity histogram, morphological, and texture features. In the validation cohort, the univariate analysis showed that the Rad-score was the independent prognostic factor (p< 0.001, hazard ratio [HR]: 3.2). And in the multivariate analysis, the Rad-score was the only prognostic factor (p< 0.01, HR: 4.1) that was signi cantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients. In addition, according to cross-validation, the C-index of the prognosis model based on the Rad-score from dual-time images is better than the early and delayed images (0.720 vs. 0.683 vs. 0.583). Conclusion. \u00a0e Rad-score based on dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images is a promising noninvasive method with better prognostic value."

            "text": "Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor. Although the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer patients has improved due to early diagnosis and treatment methods, the 1-year and 5-year survival rate of patients is about 15% and 9%, respectively [1, 2]. Surgical resection can e\u00a3ectively prolong the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. However surgical resection can only be performed in about 20% of patients, and most patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) cannot be treated with surgery,\nand their median survival time was only 6\u201314 months [3]. For these LAPC patients who cannot tolerate surgical treatment, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was a commonly used treatment [4, 5]. However, not all patients with LAPC can bene t from SBRT [6], so it is very important to predict the outcome of treatment based on the patient\u2019s information.\nCompared with most normal organs and tissues, the uptake of 18F-FDG in tumor areas increased signi cantly. \u00a0erefore, 18F-FDG PET/CT images have been widely used in tumor imaging [7]. In terms of pancreatic cancer, 18F-\nHindawi Journal of Oncology Volume 2022, Article ID 6528865, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6528865\nFDG-PET-CTscanning plays an important role in diagnosis, staging, and efficacy evaluation [8]. Some quantitative parameters based on PET imaging were shown to have some prognostic value in cancer patients, such as maximum and mean standard intake values (SUVmax and SUVmean). However, for pancreatic cancer [9\u201312], most studies show that the standardized uptake value (SUV) cannot be used as a prognostic indicator of survival. However, for metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total disease glycolysis (TLG), findings demonstrated that they were significantly associated with the OS of patient. It must be emphasized that the importance of MTV and TLG in predicting the prognosis of pancreatic cancer varies in different clinical trials, which may be due to different criteria for tumor zoning. In addition, some researchers use the retention index (RI) from the dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images for prognostic assessment. Gupta et al. [13] found that RI > 18.7% was positively associated with poorer survival in patients with pancreatic lesions. Saga et al. [14] showed that pancreatic cancer patients with a high RI (RI > 10%) had a longer survival time. -e effectiveness of RI needs further experimental verification. -erefore, there was a need for new and robust imaging features to predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.\nTumor heterogeneity is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients after treatment [15]. Radiomics, which involves the extraction of quantitative features from medical images to provide a comprehensive characterization of the entire tumor, reflects the spatial relationship and heterogeneity of voxel intensities within tumors [16\u201318]. Currently, studies have shown that radiomics features can be used for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and preoperative staging [19\u201321]. Some studies have shown that texture features from PET/CT images can be used as predictors for prognosis. For example, Yue et al. [22] studied the relationship between texture features from PETimages before and after chemotherapy and the OS of patients with pancreatic cancer.-e results showed that some texture features were prognostic factors of patients. Cui et al. [23] showed that texture features from early PET images showed better prognostic value than conventional PET features in patients treated with SBRT. And studies have shown that continuously dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CTparameters can be used as predictors of patient survival [13, 24]. However, it was difficult to achieve 60-minute, dynamic 18F-FDGPET/CT scans for patient prognosis. Recently, the dual-time FDGPET/CT (early and delayed images) has been shown to be helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant pancreatic lesions [19, 25]. In general, the uptake of 18F-FDG in malignant tissues continues to increase over time [26, 27]. -erefore, the researchers believe that dual-temporal PET/CT images contain more prognostic information for patients. -ere, we assumed that the radiomics score (Rad-score) from dual-time static 18F-FDG PET/CT images can replace dynamic imaging to a certain extent, and predict the prognosis of patients according to the changes in tumor texture.\nIn this study, we hypothesized that the radiomics score (Rad-score) calculated by a linear combination of the radiomics features from dual-time images could be the reference indicator for the prognosis of LAPC patients. We\nevaluated whether the Rad-score from dual-time imaging had a better prognostic value than the Rad-score from early or delayed images. -e ultimate aim of this retrospective study was to explore the role of the radiomics features from dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images in predicting the prognosis of LAPC patients treated with SBRT."

            "text": "2.1. Patients. -is retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Changhai Hospital, and informed consent was given to all participants. -e criteria for patient inclusion were (a) confirmation of pancreatic cancer on pathological examination of the patient after PET/CT scan; (b) available dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images; and (c) underwent SBRT treatment. -e exclusion criteria were (a) other malignant tumors; (b) death due to diseases other than pancreatic cancer during the follow-up period; and (c) a metal positioning mark implanted in the tumor lesion. Finally, a total of 70 patients who underwent dual-time 18FFDG PET/CTexaminations in our hospital between January 2012 and January 2018 were identified and included in the study.-e survival time of patients was determined from the date of the FDG-PET examination to the last follow-up examination in Changhai Hospital or the patient\u2019s death. Some of the data in this study have been reported [9].\n2.2. PET/CT Imaging Protocols. -e dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images data of the patients were collected on a Biograph tripoint 64-layer 52-ring HD PET/CT scanner (Siemens, Germany). Before the whole-body scan, the patients were required to fast for at least 6 hours. When their blood sugar was lower than 11.1mmol/L, 18F-FDG at the dose of 3.70\u223c5.55MBq/kg was injected, and the early scanning was started 50\u201360 minutes after the injection. -e whole-body PET scan covers 5\u20136 beds, with an acquisition time per bed of about 2.5 minutes, a spatial resolution of 4.07\u00d7 4.07mm2, and a scan thickness of 3mm. -e parameters of the CT scan were a current of 170mA, a voltage of 120 kV, a spatial resolution of 0.98\u00d7 0.98mm2, and a scan thickness of 3mm. -e PET and CT image matrix size were 168\u00d7168 and 512\u00d7 512, respectively. After 120\u2013150 minutes, delayed scanning was started. -e delayed PET/CT images only contain the head to tail of the pancreas. Patients were required to breathe shallowly during PET/CT scans to reduce the impact of breathing exercises.\n2.3. Image Analysis. -e radiomics workflow is shown in Figure 1. For image preprocessing, we used the 3D Slicer (version 4.10.2) to resample the original PET image and coregister it with the corresponding CT images [28, 29]. Under the guidance of the PET images, two radiologists with more than 10 years of clinical experience outlined the tumor contour on the CT images. -en the voxels of the CT were clipped to [\u221210, 100] Hounsfield Units to reduce the interference of fat and other factors on texture features [30, 31]. For the PET images, a classical normalization factor (body weight) was used to convert the voxel values to SUV\nvalues [32], and a square root transformation was used to reduce noise. Finally, the voxel values of PETand CT images were normalized to [0, 255].\n\u00a0e feature extraction algorithm was applied in MATLAB (\u00a0e MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA, USA). Before extracting the three-dimensional radiomics features, rstly, the volumes of interests (VOIs) were obtained by performing the nearest cubic trilinear interpolation on all ROI areas in the Z-axis direction. \u00a0en the spatial resolution of CTand PET images was resampled to 1\u00d7 1\u00d7 1mm3 by cubic trilinear interpolation. Finally, a total of 1188 features were extracted from the early and the delayed PET/CT images, respectively, including three groups: texture features, shape features, and wavelet features (Supplementary Table 1).\n2.4. Feature Selection. Before features analysis, each radiomics feature value was independently normalized by subtracting its mean and then dividing by its standard deviation. To improve the reproducibility and robustness of the optimal features, rst, we used the intra-class correlation coe\u00aacient (ICC) to weed out features with a correlation lower than 0.75. Second, the univariate Cox regression analysis selection was used to select features that were signi cantly associated with patients\u2019 overall survival time (p< 0.05). Finally, we used elastic nets [33] for nal feature screening and repeat this process 100 times, recording the features selected each time. To calculate the Rad-score, we then counted the frequency of the features and included the top six features in the nal feature set. \u00a0en we retrained the multivariate Cox regression model [34] with the nal feature subset in the training cohort and get the corresponding weights. \u00a0e Rad-score is de ned as the sum of the weights of each feature, which will be used in subsequent related experiments. \u00a0e speci c calculation formula is shown as follows:\nRad \u2212 score \u2211 Featuresi \u2217Weightsi, (1)\nwhere Featuresi represent the value of selected features and Weightsi represent the corresponding weight of these features in the Cox regression model.\n2.5. Statistics Analysis. To evaluate the e\u00a3ectiveness of the proposed Rad-score, rst, patients were divided into a highrisk group and a low-risk group using themedian of the Radscore in the training cohort. And the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test was used to analyze signi cant di\u00a3erences in low-risk and high-risk groups. Second, the Rad-score was used to build the prognosis model based on Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. \u00a0e average Cindex for three-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the prognosis model. \u00a0e Wilcoxon ranksum test was used to evaluate whether there are signi cant di\u00a3erences between di\u00a3erent Rad-score. Finally, the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to analyze whether the candidate parameters are independent risk prediction factors in all data. All the above code was implemented in R (version 3.6.3) software."

            "text": "\u00a0e purpose of this study was to explore the predictive value of radiomics features from dual-time images on the prognosis of LAPC patients treated with SBRT. We found that the Rad-score from dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT images can be used to predict the prognosis of LAPC patients, and can achieve the prognostic strati cation with OS of patients.\u00a0is result has clinical signi cance for promoting the precise treatment of LAPC.\n-e radiomics has attracted a lot of attention in its ability to noninvasively analyze tumor heterogeneity; and provides a viable tool for patient prognosis. In this study, we conducted a two-stage experimental setup to explore the best model for a prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer. First, we use 594 radiomics features extracted from early or delayed imaging to develop a single-time prognostic model, and then we combined the radiomics features extracted from dual-time PET/CT images to develop a dual-time prognostic model. In these two stages, the six radiomics features with the highest frequency were used to calculate the Rad-score. Univariate analysis showed that the Rad-score of both early and delayed images was significantly correlated with the OS of LAPC patients (p< 0.01, HR: 3.00 and 2.70). -is result indicated that both early and delayed PET/CT images contain patient prognostic information [13, 23]. -e Radscore from dual-time images is also significantly correlated with the OS of patients (p< 0.01, HR: 2.35). -e C-index of the model based on dual-time images was significantly higher than that of the model based on early and delayed images (p< 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). At the same time, it must be pointed out that there are differences in the division of high-risk and low-risk groups according to the Rad-score of single-time images, while an accurate grouping can be obtained by analyzing the Rad-score of dual-time images. -ese results showed that dual-time PET/CT images can provide more prognostic information and offset the limitations of single-time PET/CT images [13]. -is may be related to the kinetics of tumor uptake. As the uptake time increases, the uptake of 18F-FDG by malignant tumor tissues will increase significantly [26, 27].\nIn this study, the Rad-score from dual-time images includes three types of features such as shape feature, firstorder gray statistics feature, and texture feature. Different types of texture features can reflect the inherent heterogeneity of tumors from different angles [35, 36]. In addition, the optimal features include both original texture features and texture features based on wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients: HHH\ufffd highpass filter + highpass filter+ highpass filter), which reflect the heterogeneity of tumors on different spatial scales. On the one hand, it must be pointed out that when these six radiomics features were used alone, none of the features can predict patient survival better than the Rad-score, indicating the complementarity of information between different features. On the other hand, these characteristics are also significantly related to the OS of patients. -e solidity reflects the complexity of the homogenous region of the tumor. -e smaller the value, the higher the complexity of the tumor and the worse the prognosis of the patients [37]. -e gray level difference statistics (GLDS) calculates the contrast of the image and reflects the roughness of the texture. -e contrast [38] (PET, GLDS, and HHH) shows that the metabolic changes in the lesions in PET images have a strong resolution, the functional metabolic changes in the lesions are larger, and the texture is coarser in patients with poor prognosis. -e Busyness (Neighborhood Gray-Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM) and PET) measures the change from pixel to the adjacent pixel. A high value of business indicates that the\nintensity between a pixel and its neighborhood changes rapidly, indicating that the more complex the tumor is in patients with poor prognosis. -e correlation and the energy from the gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) in CT images quantify the degree of nonuniformity of the gray level in images. -e patients with a better prognosis showed better texture consistency.\n-e clinicopathological parameters, including T-stage, chemotherapy, and dose were found to be strong predictors of prognosis in LAPC patients receiving SBRT in the univariate Cox analysis. However, the above indicators did not show prognostic value for patients in the multivariate Cox analysis study. For the conventional PET features, the TLG from delayed PET/CT images is significantly associated with a poor prognosis. -is reaffirms the fact that the metabolic tumor volume combined with the tumor range is a better predictor of patient survival. However, in this study, the TLG of the early images does not correlate with the OS. One possible reason is that compared with the early images, delayed images may better reflect the uptake of 18F-FDG by malignant tumors. -is result is different from our previous research [9]. One possible reason is that the tumor contour is outlined in different ways, and another possible reason is the difference in the number of patients.\n-ere are some limitations to this study. First, the samples in this study were from a single center, the sample size available for analysis was small, and the potential of selection bias cannot be ruled out, which limits the accuracy and reliability of the results. -erefore, we hope that the results of this study can be repeated using larger datasets and multiple centers in the future. Second, the ROI/VOI was drawn manually, which is very time-consuming and inconvenient, and the predicted performance may be sensitive to the ROI/VOI depicting pancreatic lesions. In future research, automatic segmentation or semi-automatic segmentation could be achieved through the application of deep learning."
