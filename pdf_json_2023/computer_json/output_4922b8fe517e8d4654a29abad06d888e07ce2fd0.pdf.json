    "abstractText": "Multi-band terahertz (THz) absorber based on a non-symmetric double-sided graphene comb resonator array is designed and simulated by the finite element method (FEM) in CST Software. Then, an equivalent circuit model (ECM) based on admittance with a fast MATLAB code is proposed to analyze the absorber in the THz region. The admittance-based ECM approach could be used for any metamaterial absorber containing one layer of resonators sandwiched between two dielectric slabs and backed by a metal layer consisting of a layer of resonators with a thickness much smaller than the minimum wavelength in the considered wavelength range. The proposed absorber is dynamically tunable with a one-layered resonator array. It has strong linear dichroism (LD) response of 98% and the frequency range of 0.7-5 THz with absorption > 96%: two absorption bands for TE mode and three for TM mode. The proposed absorber can be used in polarization-sensitive devices and systems in the THz region. The ECM model of the metastructure was derived to provide an efficient approach to analyzing the performance of the absorber. The FEM simulation results are in good agreement with the ECM ones.

Then, an equivalent circuit model (ECM) based on admittance with a fast MATLAB code is proposed to analyze the absorber in the THz region. The admittance-based ECM approach could be used for any metamaterial absorber containing one layer of resonators sandwiched between two dielectric slabs and backed by a metal layer consisting of a layer of resonators with a thickness much smaller than the minimum wavelength in the considered wavelength range. The proposed absorber is dynamically tunable with a one-layered resonator array. It has strong linear dichroism (LD) response of 98% and the frequency range of 0.7-5 THz with absorption > 96%: two absorption bands for TE mode and three for TM mode. The proposed absorber can be used in polarization-sensitive devices and systems in the THz region. The ECM model of the metastructure was derived to provide an efficient approach to analyzing the performance of the absorber. The FEM simulation results are in good agreement with the ECM ones.\nINDEX TERMS Terahertz metamaterials, graphene devices, electromagnetic absorber, equivalent circuit model.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMetamaterials consisting of single or multi-layer of resonator arrays\nand having non-symmetrical geometries with the possibility to\nsuperimpose on their mirror image by the degrees of rotation have\nattracted broad attention for their features [1-6]. This type of\nmetamaterials has shown a capability to produce chirality responses\nsuch as circular dichroism (CD) [7-10] or linear dichroism (LD)\n[10-12]. Metamaterials with non-symmetrical geometries have\nbeen designed and proposed for different applications such as\nabsorbers [8, 12, 13], biosensors [14, 15], converters [16, 17],\nswitches [18, 19], and mirrors [6, 20] recently showing their\nversatile possibilities in various the fields of science.\nGraphene is an ultra-thin layer of carbon atoms with a thickness of\n0.335 nm [21, 22] and it has been widely used in patterned and non-\npatterned forms in optoelectronic devices [23] as it can dynamically\ncontrol the electromagnetic waves by the alternation of the applied\nexternal bias voltage. This distinguishes 2D materials like graphene\nfrom the other commonly used materials like metals or dielectrics.\nHence it is possible to tune the output spectra of the devices\ncontaining graphene without the need to refabricate the devices\nsaving materials, costs, and time [4, 6, 12, 17, 20-24] making them\nvery interesting, especially for spectroscopic applications.\nOne category of graphene metamaterials is the structures with non-\nsymmetrical geometries including graphene chiral or anisotropic\nmetamaterials containing one or multi-layered graphene resonator\narray(s). They have been designed and investigated, recently\nshowing dynamically tunable high (up to 99%) chirality responses\n[4-6, 12, 17, 20, 25, 26]. Thus, graphene metamaterials with strong\nchirality responses such as LD have recently been in the scope of\ninterest among worldwide researchers because they can greatly\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In addition, dynamically tunable THz region graphene\nabsorbers with non-symmetrical geometries containing one\nresonator in each unit cell with a single layer of resonators (up to\nthree absorption bands) with high absorption have been published\n[12, 33]. However, for having many absorption bands and high\naverage absorption, metamaterials containing multi-layer of\nresonators or super unit cells have been the most promising\ncandidates so far [34-36]. The design of dynamically tunable multi-\nband absorbers with high average absorption containing a single\nresonator layer and one resonator in each unit cell (simple\ngeometries) is in the scope of interest of this study. The reduction\nof structural complexity is expected to save material and cost\nresources and make their fabrication more feasible.\nGraphene-based multi-band THz absorbers are potential enablers\nfor future photonics systems. By tuning the spectral response of the\nmetamaterial absorber, they can be utilized in multi-channel\ncommunication systems [37], highly sensitive and selective sensing\nand imaging, spectroscopy applications [38-43], filtering [40],\nswitching [42], modulating [43], and so on.\nIn this paper, we designed and analyzed a multi-band graphene\nabsorber in the THz region. The absorber consists of a non-\nsymmetric double-sided graphene comb resonator array. An\nadmittance-based equivalent circuit model (ECM) of the\nmetamaterial is implemented. The designed metamaterial is\nanalyzed primarily as an absorber, but it can be used also in\napplications like filtering and sensing in the THz devices and\nsystems."

            "text": "Structural views of the proposed multi-band THz graphene\nabsorber consisting of a non-symmetric double-sided comb\nresonator array are presented in Fig. 1. An ion gel layer is assumed\nto be lossless and dispersionless layer with a refractive index of 1.42\nbeing placed over the metamaterial to bias the graphene resonator\narray layer [12, 44]. The resonator array layer is made of graphene\nwhich enables the device to be dynamically tunable (not possible\nby metals). Basically, this means that there is no need to refabricate\nthe metamaterial for tuning it\u2019s spectral response saving the\nresources of materials, costs, and time [24]. The main loss and\ndispersion for the metamaterial are produced by the graphene\nresonator layer. The substrate is built of Teflon\n(polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE) with a low permittivity of \u025bd = 2.1 and an extremely low loss tangent (tan\u03b4 = 0.0003) which are\nstable over a wide range of frequencies. Teflon has unique electrical\nand mechanical properties. It has very small dielectric loss and it is\ndispersionless in the considered frequency region with high-\nperformance thermoplastic polymer characteristics [12, 45, 46]. A layer of gold with a conductivity of 4.56\u00d7107 S/m [47] is used\nwhich acts as a perfect reflector in the considered frequency\nrange. In addition, it doesn\u2019t produce any loss since it has a\nbig conductivity and energy cannot go through it [48] and it\nis dispersionless. It is placed at the bottom of the metamaterial.\nThe gold reflector with a thickness of 0.5 \u00b5m which is much\nlarger than of the penetration depth (\u2053 5.5 \u00d7 maximum\npenetration depth) of the THz waves is selected to ensure that\nthe incident electromagnetic wave cannot transmit to the\nother side of the absorber [49]. The numerical simulation results\nare obtained by the finite element method (FEM) in the frequency\ndomain of CST Software [12, 20, 33, 50, 51]. The boundary\nconditions and the mesh type are being considered the same as\nreported in [33]. The designed metamaterial works as a\ndynamically tunable multi-band absorber in the THz range. We\nswept and optimized the dimensions of the metamaterial absorber\nin the 0.7-5 THz frequency range in the CST Software to achieve\nthe highest linear dichroism (LD) response, the maximum\nnumber of absorption bands, and the highest average\nabsorption. The optimized dimensional values of the proposed\nmetamaterial are reported in Table I.\nThe dimensional parameters are obtained by use of the\ngenetic algorithm optimization technique in CST. Genetic\nalgorithms (GAs) are heuristic searches and optimization\ntechniques inspired by natural evolution [52, 53].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The substrate is made of Teflon and the structure is backed by a gold layer to avoid the transmission of electromagnetic waves.\nIn the simulated frequency range, the maximum frequency is\nfmax = 5 THz (minimum wavelength is \u03bbmin = 60 \u00b5m) and the unit cell dimensions are Px = Py = 28 \u00b5m along the x and y axes which are smaller than 0.8* \u03bbmin = 48 \u00b5m. So, the higherorder Floquet modes will not be excited and propagated in\nthe device [54, 55].\nThe \u00b5c, graphene chemical potential, is considered as 1 eV in the design. The relative permittivity of graphene is calculated\nby [33]:\n0\n1 j \n  = \u2212 \n(1)\nwhere \u03c3, \u03c9, \u03b50, and \u0394 are the graphene surface conductivity, angular frequency, permittivity of vacuum, and the graphene\nthickness. \u0394 is 0.335 nm.

The transmission\nline model and the input admittance for each section of the\ndesigned graphene absorber are shown in Fig. 2. The\nthickness of the graphene layer is much smaller than the\nsimulated wavelength range, so the graphene resonator layer\nis modeled as a point load [57, 58].\nThe admittances of the different sections of the graphene\nabsorber are calculated by [57]:\n( )\n( )\n/ / /\n1 /\n. tan\n.tan\nTE TM Au d dTE TM TE TM\nd TE TM d Au d\nY jY d Y Y\nY jY d\n\n\n+ =\n+ (5)\nin which /TE TM dY , and d  are respectively the TE/TM admittances\nof the Teflon dielectric spacer, the gold layer admittance, and the\npropagation constant of the TE/TM electromagnetic wave in\nthe dielectric spacer.

Surface current distributions of the graphene absorber of Fig. 1 at 1.52 THz on (a) graphene resonator layer, (b) gold layer, at 1.84 THz on (c) graphene resonator layer, (d) gold layer, at 2.45 THz on (e) graphene resonator layer, (f) gold layer, at 2.7 THz on (g) graphene resonator layer, (h) gold layer, at 4.45 THz on (i) graphene resonator layer, and (j) gold layer.\nThe linear dichroism (LD) vs frequency spectra of the\ndesigned graphene absorber of Fig. 1 for three different\nchemical potentials are calculated by Eq. 32 and the results\nare given in Fig. 8(a). The maximum of LD reaches 98%. By\nincreasing of the graphene chemical potential, the resonance\nfrequencies of the LD spectra increase, showing a blueshift.\nThis is because the real part of the \u03b2 in Eq. 4 decreases as the\nchemical potential increases [59]. So, the resonances\nincrease by the increase of the chemical potential.\nThe linear dichroism (LD) vs frequency spectra of the\ndesigned graphene absorber of Fig. 1 for three different\nangles of the incident launched wave are given in Fig. 8(b).\nAs it is shown, changing the incident wave angle affects the\nresonance frequencies of the LD spectrum and the LD values\nvery slightly. So, the metamaterial is incident angle\nindependent.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The fabrication procedure needs further investigation, but it can be done and followed as: The Teflon dielectric is transferred on gold metal reflector through thermal evaporation. The graphene layer is coated on the Teflon dielectric by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The doublesided graphene comb resonator array is written by electron beam etching. The ion gel dielectric is transferred on graphene resonator array through thermal evaporation [33, 60, 61]. Our designed absorber is compared with some previously\npublished absorbers containing non-symmetrical geometries\nin Table II."

            "text": "In this work, equivalent circuit modeling (ECM) approach based on admittance by using a simple MATLAB code for a terahertz (THz) graphene absorber consisted of a non-symmetric double-sided comb resonator array is designed and presented. The admittancebased ECM could be utilized for any metamaterial absorber containing one layer of resonators sandwiched between two dielectric slabs and backed by a metal layer, consisting of a layer of resonators with a thickness much smaller than the minimum wavelength in the considered wavelength range. The metamaterial is numerically simulated in CST Microwave Studio Software by use of finite element method (FEM). FEM and ECM results are in good agreement. The designed ECM can also be utilized for modeling of other graphene metamaterials containing one layer of resonator array. The designed absorber is dynamically tunable, consisting of one-layer resonator array, one resonator for each unit cell. The metamaterial absorber has a strong linear dichroism (LD) response of 98%. The absorption for all the five resonance bands is\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The metamaterial absorber has two absorption bands for TE mode and three absorption bands for TM mode. Our designed graphene absorber can be used as an element in controllable polarizationsensitive systems for absorbing and sensing applications.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nNone of the authors have a conflict of interest to disclose."
