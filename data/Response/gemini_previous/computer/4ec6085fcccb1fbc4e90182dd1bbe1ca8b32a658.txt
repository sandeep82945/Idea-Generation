1. **Investigate the relationship between musical notes and phonemes:** Explore how the choice of phonemes in lyrics is influenced by the musical notes they are sung to. This could involve analyzing the frequency of certain phonemes in different musical contexts, or examining how the placement of phonemes within a melody affects the overall sound of the song.


2. **Develop a method for incorporating musical information into the evaluation of singable lyric translation:** Create a metric or algorithm that can assess the degree to which translated lyrics match the musical structure of the original song. This could involve analyzing the rhythm, pitch, and harmony of the lyrics, or examining how the lyrics interact with the instrumental accompaniment.


3. **Conduct comparative studies of singable lyric translation across different genres:** Investigate how the evaluation metrics proposed in this paper perform across different genres of music, such as pop, rock, hip-hop, and classical. This could help to identify genre-specific factors that influence the quality of singable lyric translation.


4. **Explore the impact of cultural understandings of poetry on singable lyric translation:** Examine how cultural differences in the understanding of poetry affect the translation of lyrics. This could involve analyzing how translators adapt lyrics to fit the cultural context of the target language, or how they negotiate cultural differences in the interpretation of poetic devices.


5. **Develop a system for automatically generating singable lyric translations:** Create a machine learning model or algorithm that can generate singable lyric translations from a source language to a target language. This could involve training the model on a dataset of singable lyrics, or developing a set of rules or constraints that the model can use to generate translations.
