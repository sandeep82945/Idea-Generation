    "abstractText": "Background. Many patients are clinically consulted in dental clinics, where aerosol-generating procedures are widely used. In our previous study, we evaluated the temperature, humidity and contamination rates on the inner layer of masks according to the mask-wearing time. However, it is important to assess the contamination rates on the outer layer of masks used in dentistry as well. Previously, while examining the contamination rates, we only identified the associated bacteria; no detailed analysis of bacterial species depending on the mask-wearing time was conducted. Furthermore, we did not evaluate factors that could contribute to the contamination of masks.",

The present study was intended to supplement the limitations of\u00a0our previous study.\nMaterial and methods. The used masks were collected. Thereafter, colony forming unit (CFU) quantification and 16S rDNA sequencing were performed to calculate the contamination rates and identify bacterial species. Data on the participants\u2019 medical and dental history was collected. The participants filled out a\u00a0questionnaire and underwent saliva tests.\nResults. On the inner and outer layers of\u00a0the masks, 3.3 \u00d7 108 and 8.5 \u00d7 108 CFUs were found, respectively. The contamination rates of\u00a0 the masks increased with the increasing mask-wearing time. There was no correlation between the contamination rate on the inner layer and other factors, such as the probing depth (PD) \u22654 mm, the bleeding rate, the calculus rate, and saliva characteristics. The inner layer contamination rate increased as the number of\u00a0treated teeth increased, and as the saliva buffering capacity decreased. The outer layer contamination rate increased with the number of\u00a0times the mask was touched.\nConclusions. The contamination rates were higher on the outer layer than on the inner one, and the CFU count increased with the mask-wearing time. The following bacterial species were found on the masks: Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis); Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus); Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis); Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis); and Streptococcus koreensis (S. koreensis). Oral health conditions may have affected the contamination of\u00a0the inner layer. In addition, the number of\u00a0times the mask was touched may have affected the contamination of\u00a0the outer layer.\nKeywords: bacterial contamination, mask contamination, mask contamination factors"

It has become an\u00a0essential safety measure during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.1 Particularly, in dental clinics, clinicians have to consult many patients and aerosol-generating procedures are widely used. Consequently, the mask contamination rates may increase in such settings.2 However, hospital guidelines for infection prevention lack evidence for mask replacement cycles.3 Hence, in our previous study, we evaluated the temperature, humidity and contamination rates on the inner layer of\u00a0masks according to the mask-wearing time.4 Yet, it is important to assess the contamination rates on the outer layer of\u00a0masks used in dentistry as well. No studies have referred to this issue so far. In addition, in our previous study, we only identified the associated bacteria; no detailed analysis of\u00a0 bacterial species depending on the mask-wearing time was conducted. Furthermore, we did not evaluate factors that could contribute to the contamination of\u00a0masks.\nTherefore, the present study was intended to supplement the limitations of\u00a0our previous study."

After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, CFUs were counted.\nIdentification of\u00a0bacteria\nThe colonies on the PCA plates were picked randomly and subcultured 3 times. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was implemented using a\u00a0 paired primer set (forward primer: 27F: AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG; reverse primer: 1492R: GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT TC). The reaction mixtures were subjected to 30 cycles of\u00a0 denaturation and annealing at 50\u00b0C in an\u00a0 automated thermal cycler (SimpliAmp\u2122; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (EtBr). The final PCR pro ducts were purified using a\u00a0DNA purification kit (LaboPass\u2122; Cosmo Genetech Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea). Finally, the PCR products were analyzed with automated sequencing, using a\u00a0 cycle sequencing kit (BigDye\u2122 Terminator, v.\u00a0 3.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific), a\u00a0 sequencing machine (ABI 3730XL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software, v.\u00a0 5.2 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, USA). The newly aligned 16S rDNA sequences were compared with the bacterial genes deposited in the GenBank\u00ae database (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, USA), and the bacterial strains with a\u00a0match of\u00a099% were searched using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for nucleotides (NCBI).5 If\u00a0alignment with the 27F and 1492R primers failed, additional experiments were conducted using an\u00a0 internal primer (800R: TAC CAG GGT ATC TAA TCC; 785F: GGA TTA GAT ACC CTG GTA), and if this alignment failed as well, 5.8S rRNA sequencing (ITS1: TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G; ITS4: TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC) and 25\u201328S rRNA sequencing (NL1: GCA TAT CAA TAA GCG GAG GAA AAG; NL4: GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG G) were performed additionally.\nMedical and dental history taking\nAll participants underwent intraoral examinations, and one investigator collected data on the participants\u2019 medical\nand dental history, medication, and progressive oral diseases, such as dental caries. The investigator also measured attrition and abrasion, the probing depth (PD), the bleeding rate and the calculus rate."

The participants had 27.3 \u00b11.6 teeth on average, and 15.1% of\u00a0 the participants had semi-erupted teeth (1.9\u00a0 \u00b10.8). The participants who had undergone preventive dental treatment, such as coating with a\u00a0dental sealant, constituted 58.5% of\u00a0the total sample. Among them, the average number of\u00a0teeth covered with a\u00a0sealant was 3.9 \u00b12.7. In\u00a0addition, 62.3% of\u00a0 the participants had been provided with preservation\nand/or prosthetic treatment, such as resin fillings or gold crowns (6.6 \u00b13.8 teeth on average). Furthermore, 56.6% of\u00a0the participants had caries. Among them, the average number of\u00a0teeth with dental caries was 3.0 \u00b12.3, and 9.4% and 11.3% of\u00a0 the participants had attritions (1.8 \u00b11.3) and abrasions (8.0\u00a0\u00b16.7), respectively. It was also observed that 11.3% of\u00a0the participants had PD\u00a0> 4\u00a0mm (4.9\u00a0\u00b13.2\u00a0mm; r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.109), 56.6% experienced bleeding (bleeding rate: 3.2\u00a0\u00b13.6%; r\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and 77.4% had calculus (calculus rate: 8.9 \u00b113.3%; r\u00a0 =\u00a0 \u22120.117). Of the total participants, 5.7% were undergoing orthodontic treatment, and 20.8% were equipped with retainers after the completion of\u00a0orthodontic treatment. Table\u00a01 shows the correlations between particular factors and the CFU count, as well as sample percentages, and the average values for teeth or the indices examined.\nSaliva tests were conducted to analyze the correlations between saliva characteristics and mask contamination on the inner layer (Table\u00a02). The unstimulated saliva secretion rate was 0.5 \u00b10.3 mL/min, the initial saliva pH was 6.8 \u00b10.3, the stimulated saliva secretion rate was 1.1 \u00b10.5 mL/min, and the saliva buffering capacity was 9.2 \u00b12.0.\nAll factors were graphically analyzed. The inner layer contamination rate increased (from 3.1 \u00d7 106 to 5.2 \u00d7 108\u00a0CFUs) as the number of\u00a0treated teeth increased, but the differences were not statistically significant (Fig.\u00a0 3A). In\u00a0 addition, as the saliva buffering capacity decreased (from 9.9 to 8.9), the contamination rate on the inner layer of\u00a0 the masks increased. These differences were not statistically significant, either (Fig.\u00a03B).\nFig.\u00a02.

The participants touched the mask approx. 10.7 \u00b19.9 times, and the outer layer contamination rate increased (from 10.5 \u00d7 106 to 11.1 \u00d7 108 CFUs) with the number of\u00a0times the mask was touched. Yet, the differences were not statistically significant (Fig.\u00a04)."

            "text": "The results of\u00a0studies on mask contamination differ. In some articles, contamination was higher on the inner layer of\u00a0masks,6 while in others, contamination was higher on the outer layer.7,8 These varying outcomes are probably due to the environment in which the participants wore masks. The contamination outside the mask is higher in dental clinics, where aerosol-generating procedures occur.7,8 However, under strict control over contamination conditions (e.g., in operating rooms), the contamination rate is higher inside the mask.6 Due to the generation of\u00a0aerosols, air pollution in dental clinics is relatively higher than in other environments. Consequently, in the present study, the contamination rate on the outer layer of\u00a0the masks was higher than on the inner layer in most samples (Fig.\u00a01A).\nWe performed 16S rDNA sequencing to identify bacterial species. The bacteria detected on both layers were classified as the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera, which are Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacteria. They are also part of\u00a0 the normal human flora, typically the skin flora and, less commonly, the mucosal flora. The normal flora may be easily found on the used masks, as wearing a\u00a0 mask involves close contact with the human skin (Fig.\u00a01B).4,9\nSome bacteria belonging to the Staphylococcus, Strepto coccus and Moraxella genera were observed only on the inner layer of\u00a0 the masks. For example, S.\u00a0 salivarius is commonly found in the oral cavity,10 and S.\u00a0 infantis,11 S.\u00a0 rubneri,12 S.\u00a0 australis,13 S.\u00a0 sanguinis,14 and S.\u00a0 parasanguinis15 can be detected in the oral cavity and the throat. In addition, S.\u00a0 lugdunensis is pathogenic and can cause various infections.16 Moraxella osloensis is a\u00a0commensal Gram-negative bacterium that causes invasive infections, mainly in immuno compromised individuals.17 However, if infectious bacteria were found inside the mask, we could not ascertain whether the mask wearer was also infected. It is necessary to conduct a\u00a0future study that would assess the relationship between the bacteria found on the inner layer of\u00a0masks and the participants\u2019 medical history.\nSome bacteria belonging to the Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Psychrobacillus, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus genera were observed only on the outer layer of\u00a0the masks. Streptococcus mitis18 and E. faecium19 are commonly found in the human oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, they can be easily observed on the used masks. Staphylococcus warneri20 and S.\u00a0caprae21 can cause opportunistic infectious diseases in immunocompromised individuals, but they are also found in the normal flora. Interestingly, some bacteria rarely found in humans, such as P.\u00a0 lasiicapitis, B.\u00a0 thioparans and L.\u00a0plantarum, were found on the outer layer of\u00a0the masks. This was probably due to the contamination of\u00a0the mask through an\u00a0unexpected route. Future research on whether these bacteria can be found in humans is needed.\nOn the inner and outer layers of\u00a0the masks, 13.2% of\u00a0bacteria were of\u00a0the same species and strain. Thus, there is a\u00a0possibility that the contamination inside the mask due to human-derived bacteria may spread to the outer layer, or the contamination outside the mask due to external air pollution may spread to the inner layer (Fig.\u00a01C).\nIn our previous study, the CFU count on the inner layer of\u00a0 masks increased with the mask-wearing time.4 Similar to our previous results, the mask contamination rate increased with the increasing mask-wearing time (Fig.\u00a0 2A,C). In the previous study, the mask contamination rate in mask samples was 0.35 \u00d7 108 CFUs and 0.95 \u00d7 108 CFUs after 2 h and 4 h of\u00a0wearing, respectively.4 Similarly, the present study showed that the mask contamination rate on the inner layer after 4 h of\u00a0wearing was 0.7 \u00d7 108 CFUs, which is within the range of\u00a0the previous results.\nBacteria such as S.\u00a0epidermidis and S.\u00a0aureus are commonly found on the skin, and they survive relatively well even in dry environments; hence, they could survive for more than 8 h on the masks (Fig.\u00a02B,D).9\nSome bacteria, including S.\u00a0 capitis, S.\u00a0 oralis and S.\u00a0 koreensis, were only found on both the inner and outer layers of\u00a0 the masks worn for 4\u20138 h (Fig.\u00a0 2B,D). Staphylococcus capitis is part of\u00a0 the normal flora of\u00a0 the human skin20 and can survive well in dry environments; however, it was not detected on the masks worn for more than 8 h. This might be due to the fact that the abi lity to withstand dry environments for a\u00a0 long time varies among bacterial species, even if they belong to the same group of\u00a0the normal human flora. Streptococcus oralis was observed on the masks worn for more than 4\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a02B,D). The bacterium is easily found in the oral cavity.22 The mask is not contaminated with S.\u00a0oralis immediately after it is put on, but through conversation or breathing, as the mask-wearing time increases. Although S.\u00a0koreensis was found on the masks worn for 4\u20138 h, further research is needed for accurate interpretation.\nWe hypothesized that oral health conditions and saliva characteristics could cause the contamination on the inner layer of\u00a0 the masks. Hence, intraoral examinations and saliva tests were performed. However, no correlations were found between those factors and the CFU count (Tables\u00a01,2).\nThe contamination rate on the inner layer of\u00a0 the masks increased as the tooth treatment rate increased. In addition, as the saliva buffering capacity rate decreased, the contamination rate of\u00a0 the inner layer of\u00a0 the masks increased as well. However, these differences were not statistically significant (Fig.\u00a0 3). Reduced saliva buffering capacity and a\u00a0 decreased pH maintenance ability of\u00a0 saliva increase the possibility of\u00a0 oral diseases, such as dental caries.23 It\u00a0 was expected that poor oral health conditions might increase the contamination of\u00a0 the inner layer of\u00a0 the masks; yet, their impact was not pronounced.\nFinally, it was hypothesized that the contamination rate on the outer layer of\u00a0 the masks would increase with the number of\u00a0times the mask was touched. Indeed, the contamination rates increased, but the differences were not statistically significant (Fig.\u00a04), perhaps due to the complex source of\u00a0contamination of\u00a0the outer layer of\u00a0the masks.\nDue to the risk of\u00a0 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, wearing a\u00a0 mask has become more important. Several previous studies revealed that saliva could serve for the detection of\u00a0SARS-CoV-2.24\u201326 Thus, wearing a\u00a0mask is essential for protecting not only mask wearers, but also individuals around them from the risk of\u00a0infection. Patients must take off their masks to receive dental treatment; hence, it is essential for clinicians to wear masks. According to the infection control guidelines, the sterilization of\u00a0equipment is essential. However, the masks worn by clinicians do not undergo a\u00a0separate sterilization process. This suggests that mask contamination through an\u00a0 unexpected route may cause secondary infection. Therefore, it is recommended that masks that have undergone a\u00a0photosterilization process27 with the use of\u00a0ultraviolet (UV) irradiation,28 which is widely used in dentistry and does not cause damage to the mask or filter, be used."
