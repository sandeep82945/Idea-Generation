    "abstractText": "Crotalaria genus is extensively dispersed in tropical and subtropical provinces, and it is found to harbor antioxidant flavonoids. Response surface methodology\u2010based optimization was carried out for the purpose of efficient extraction involving a suitable solvent which can maximize the yield along with higher total phenolic content and total flavonoid content (TFC). Optimization conditions for extraction of C.candicans flavonoids (CCF) based on variables such as solvent, solid\u2010solvent ratio and extraction temperature were evaluated. The optimized conditions were found as Solvent i.e., Aqueous\u2010ethanol (53.42%), Solid\u2010solvent ratio (1:15.83 w/v) and temperature (44.42 \u00b0C) and resulted to obtain the TFC as 176.23 mg QRET/g C. candicans extract with the yield 27.42 mg CCF/g (C. candicans dry weight). LC\u2013MS analysis of CCF, revealed the presence of seven major flavonoids. The antioxidant flavonoids were further used to functionalize the zero\u2010valent silver (ZVAgF) and copper (ZVCuF) nanoparticles. The ZVAgF and ZVCuF were investigated using UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry, FT\u2010IR spectroscopy and X\u2010ray diffractometry to confirm the presence of the zero valent metals and possible functional groups which capped the elemental metal. Further transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering method and zeta\u2010potential studies were done to understand their respective structural and morphological properties. The efficacy of the as\u2010prepared ZVAgF/ZVCuF as antibiofilm agents on Methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with the mechanism studies have been explored. The MRSA\u2010colony count from the infection zebrafish (in vivo) model, portrayed a reduction of > 1.9 fold for ZVCuF and > twofold for ZVAgF, with no alteration in liver morphology when treated with ZVAgF, implying that the nanoparticles were safe and biocompatible.",

            "text": "Crotalaria genus is extensively dispersed in tropical and subtropical provinces, and it is found to harbor antioxidant flavonoids. Response surface methodology\u2011based optimization was carried out for the purpose of efficient extraction involving a suitable solvent which can maximize the yield along with higher total phenolic content and total flavonoid content (TFC). Optimization conditions for extraction of C.candicans flavonoids (CCF) based on variables such as solvent, solid\u2011solvent ratio and extraction temperature were evaluated. The optimized conditions were found as Solvent i.e., Aqueous\u2011ethanol (53.42%), Solid\u2011solvent ratio (1:15.83 w/v) and temperature (44.42 \u00b0C) and resulted to obtain the TFC as 176.23 mg QRET/g C. candicans extract with the yield 27.42 mg CCF/g (C. candicans dry weight). LC\u2013MS analysis of CCF, revealed the presence of seven major flavonoids. The antioxidant flavonoids were further used to functionalize the zero\u2011valent silver (ZVAgF) and copper (ZVCuF) nanoparticles. The ZVAgF and ZVCuF were investigated using UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry, FT\u2011IR spectroscopy and X\u2011ray diffractometry to confirm the presence of the zero valent metals and possible functional groups which capped the elemental metal. Further transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering method and zeta\u2011potential studies were done to understand their respective structural and morphological properties. The efficacy of the as\u2011prepared ZVAgF/ZVCuF as antibiofilm agents on Methicillin\u2011resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with the mechanism studies have been explored.

They are widely regarded for their antimicrobial medications in various indigenous traditional systems in Africa, China, and India2,3. Crotalaria genus are also utilized as a sustainable source in production of biodiesel, biopolymer extraction, feedstock production4,5. Phytoconstituents from these plants have been tested for various therapeutic purposes and are considered a sustainable source for flavonoids and other phytoconstituents6. Staphylococcus aureus is a prevalent foodborne pathogenic microorganism, which invades into the body and causes a wide array of diseases such as skin infections and food poisoning. A more virulent strain of it, Methicillin-resistant\u00a0S. aureus (MRSA) has developed as an extensive root-cause for community- and hospital-acquired infections, worldwide7. Upsurge in antibiotic resistance has been compelling, to say the least, and has now become a serious research problem for prospective therapeutic strategies to thwart drug resistance.

Bioactive secondary metabolites from various plant genera, possessing negligible side effects have been in vogue, in traditional medicine, for treating health ailments8,9. Myriad phyto-constituents have been well documented as antimicrobial agents, including biofilm inhibition10,11. Flavonoids are potent antibacterial agents against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there is an increasing prevalence of untreatable infections, and flavonoids have gained scientific attention as potential substitutes for antibiotics. Flavonoids and polyphenols have gained a lot of interest from widespread scholars owing to its therapeutic potentials, which include antioxidants and antimicrobials11,12.\n\u201cBionanotechnology\u201d has opened new vistas and provides ample research scope in diverse areas, like antimicrobials, anticancer and drug delivery agents13. It has been extensively comprehended that the plant extracts reduce metal salts14 with the secondary metabolites, which have dual role as stabilizing/reducing agents. The propensity for using plant extracts for functionalizing MNPs is well documented and is reported that MNPs capped with plant extracts offer better antimicrobial efficacy15. Silver and copper metals, in zero-valent form are reported to possess, plethora of bioactivity like antimicrobial and anticancer agents, and have encouraged many research groups in bionanotechnology to pursue biogenic synthetic procedures for antimicrobial metallic nanoparticles16,17.\nCrotalaria candicans Wight & Arn, is a native species in Nilgiris, India and is used by the local population as antimicrobials2. The studies on phytochemical and bioactivities of these plants hitherto not much explored. In this regard, we assessed the process for valorization of flavonoids of C. candicans, establish its antioxidant capacity and nano-conjugate the flavonoids on zero-valent silver and copper (ZVAgF/ZVCuF), with an intent to enhance the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against MRSA. The functionalized zero-valent nanoparticles were further mechanistically explored to gain insights on the antibacterial and antibiofilm potential, in an in\u00a0vivo zebrafish infection model."

The quantification of ROS was done with DCHFDA assay and the results revealed that ZVAgF and doxycycline treatment led to increased ROS release when compared to ROS generated by untreated control groups whereas ZVCuF did not trigger ROS production (Fig.\u00a0S6B). As ROS can lead to loss in cell viability and as, a notable proportion of dead cells was not observed with fluorescent staining, ROS contribution to the antibiofilm effects of ZVAgF and ZVCuF is limited. ZVAgF had a 35% decline in Cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), whereas a 50% decline triggered in CSH was found with ZVCuF.

AchE is important for metabolism of acetylcholine and other choline-esters and is a biomarker in neuronal toxicity studies44. Liver carboxylesterase (CEs) plays an important detoxification part in the use of xenobiotics. Elevated carboxylesterase levels, due to xenobiotic stress, trigger the breakdown of carboxylic-esters and are deemed as significant components of liver detoxification system45. The ZVAgF, ZVCuF and the positive control drug effects on liver carboxylesterase and brain acetylcholinesterase profiles were determined.

            "text": "The available reports in the literature suggest that the antimicrobial properties of the Crotalaria genus are majorly due to its flavonoid content47,48. In this regard, we have utilized C. candicans to isolate flavonoids by a RSM optimization. From the preliminary analysis of solvents in extraction efficiency, it was clear that ethanol\u2013water was a suitable greener solvent system for extraction of flavonoids from C.candicans based on the yield analysis, total phenolic\u00a0[TPC] and flavonoids\u00a0[TFC] analysis (Table\u00a01) which is\u00a0in concurrence with other reports49. Using the BBD approach, the yield of the CCF was increased to 27.42\u00a0mg CCF/g DW along with TFC as 176.23\u00a0mg QRTE/g extract, when compared with the preliminary binary solvent extraction\u00a0procedure (142.52\u00a0mg QRTE/g extract). The model was well validated using statistical analysis and testing the optimized conditions of extraction. The presence of seven flavonoids in the valorized mixture was confirmed with LC\u2013MS analysis (Fig.\u00a0S1) and it was observed that the content of flavonoids such\u00a0as\u00a0Quercetin and Morin together constituted nearly 78% (based on peak area) and other flavonoids were less than 10% each (Table\u00a0S1). Antimicrobial potency of secondary metabolites has been proven by various research groups50\u201352 and flavonoids are one among them, possessing interesting chemical structural motifs. These flavonoids are reported to possess various biological functions like anticancer, neuroprotective antidiabetic and majorly as antioxidants53\u201356.\nIn the green synthesis of metal ions to zero valent state using plant extract or extract fractions, it is well reported57 that reducing nature of metal ions is due to redox reactions58. While a plethora of reports are available with plant extract mediated biogenic synthesis of MNPs, still very few reports are available with enriched/ quantified extracts and individual secondary metabolites. The benefit of using quantified plant metabolites like CCF for fabricating nanoparticles [NPs], embraces the ability to predict mechanism of formation of NPs and hypothesize the role of plant metabolite in biological activity. The CCF at 2\u00a0mg/ml, reduced silver and copper to zero valent silver and copper nanoparticles respectively. The antioxidant property of the CCF had a great effect on functionalizing/reducing both the ZVAgF (Ag+) and ZVCuF (Cu2+) from their respective salts. The as-prepared ZVAgF/ZVCuF did not portray appreciable antioxidant activity, which corroborated the fact that the functional groups present in CCF were consumed for capping the metallic nanoparticles. As the ZVCuF/ZVAgF portrayed antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects, further optimization for the synthesis of biogenic metallic nanoparticles was done. Influencing factors like valorized CCF concentration, metal salts and sunlight (photo-mediation, as in case of ZVAgF) and reducing agents (with ZVCuF) were deciphered and with the variation of CCF concentration, it was found that the intensity and sharpness (\u03bbmax) changes was gratifying (Fig.\u00a02). ZVCuF formation was done by varying CCF concentration and with minimal reducing agents (Fig.\u00a02B). UV\u2013Vis spectra absorption\nFigure\u00a07. Infection study on Zebrafish model.

The crystalline nature of ZVAgF/ZVCuF was proved with X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Fig.\u00a03B/4B). The large negative zeta potential magnitude \u2212 22.8\u00a0mV and \u2212 28.8\u00a0mV of ZVAgF (Fig.\u00a03D) and ZVCuF (Fig.\u00a04D) respectively indicates the potential stability of metallic nanoparticles and thus proving that the ZVCuF and ZVAgF are colloids that do not have the tendency to aggregate59,60. The presence of the functional groups of flavonoids like the O\u2013H, C=C and C\u2013O on the surface of biogenic nanoparticles, ZVAgF and ZVCuF was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and were attributed to\u00a0the wavenumbers at 3414, 3194, 1647, 1406, 1039\u00a0 cm\u22121 respectively (Figs.\u00a03E, 4E respectively). The TEM images exhibited the spherical morphology, nature and size of ZVAgF (Fig.\u00a03F\u2013H) and ZVCuF (Fig.\u00a04F\u2013H). We had previously reported that the phytochemical stabilized nanoparticles exerts appreciable antimicrobial and antidiabetic activity12,61. Herein, we synthesized the coinage metal stable nanoparticles which were functionalized with flavonoids (ZVCuF/ZVAgF), and were extensively employed for antibiofilm application. While the valorized CCF did not exhibit notable antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects, the zerovalent metallic nanoparticles (ZVCuF/ZVAgF), functionalized with CCF, were active, as evident from the MIC/MBCs/MBICs data (Table\u00a07). The presence of reducing and capping/stabilizing agents, restrict the MNPs from aggregation, resulting in the production of nanoparticles with smaller hydrodynamic radii. The carboxyl groups and the \u2013OH groups of flavonoids are majorly involved in metal capping and the keto-enol tautomerism of the carboxyl (C=O) group helps in reducing the metal ions to metallic NPs62\u201365. The decrease in \u2013O\u2013H concentration in the\u00a0IR spectrum can be attributed to its reaction with metal salts Ag+/Cu2+ ions and subsequent conversion to the zero-valent silver and copper (Fig.\u00a0S4).\nThe antimicrobial studies of ZVAgF/ZVCuF against MRSA showed that ZVAgF is more effective than ZVCuF in restricting the growth of MRSA with the MIC/MBIC of 6 ug/mL and 8 ug/mL respectively. Time kill curve results (Fig.\u00a0S5A) implied that bactericidal effects of both AgNPs and CuNPs were comparable to doxycycline for 24\u00a0h. The alizarin test confirmed that nano-copper released cations (Cu2+) to the growth medium (Fig.\u00a0S5B) and these Cu2+ ions through electrostatic attraction got bound to the bacterial cell walls; or at times penetration of CuNPs into the bacteria, which results in cell death66,67. CV and fluorescent imaging proved the ability of biogenic ZVAgF/ZVCuF to thwart the biofilm formation by biogenic ZVAgF/ZVCuF at MIC levels (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). The biofilm SEM micrographs (Fig.\u00a05I\u2013P), concluded that the flavonoid capped ZVAgF/ZVCuF retarded the biofilm formation68. Membrane perturbation (Fig.\u00a0S6A) and ROS studies (Fig.\u00a0S6B) proved that the ZVAgF aids in ROS generation at higher concentration (1\u00d7 MIC). Earlier studies have shown that Ag+ ions are released into the media, to generate ROS and thus triggering the cell death and retarding the biofilm\u00a0 formation69. This is in line with other reports that by reducing hydrophobicity, biogenic NPs retards bacterial adhesion thereby curtailing biofilm formation70 as observed in the present study (Fig.\u00a0S6C). The ZVCuF/ZVAgF displayed better in\u00a0vitro biofilm activity.\nThe in\u00a0vitro hemolysis assay and zebrafish model was employed to ascertain the toxicity of biogenic NPs. CCF, ZVAgF and ZVCuF did not display any hemolytic potential at MIC and Sub MIC concentrations (Fig.\u00a0S7). \u03b1 and \u03b2-naphthol and acetylcholinesterase levels were observed with treatment relative to the untreated control, and no significant variations were found, implying that the coinage metallic nanoparticles are non-toxic (Fig.\u00a0S8) which shows similar to other reports71. An interesting observation from histopathology analysis was that infiltration cells in the central vein was higher for ZVCuF, when compared with the other treated groups, and as the NPs did not induce mortality in fish, nanoparticles can be construed to be non-toxic (Fig.\u00a0S9). For the fish infection studies, the ZVCuF/ZVAgF were employed at their MIC, and in\u00a0vivo infection studies revealed that the nanoparticles triggered a substantial reduction in colony count. ZVCuF induced > 1.9 log reduction whereas the ZVAgF caused > 2 log reduction and Doxycycline exhibited > 2.3 log reduction, evidencing that the ZVCuF/ ZVAgF displayed similar ability like doxycycline in restricting bacterial growth (Fig.\u00a07)."
