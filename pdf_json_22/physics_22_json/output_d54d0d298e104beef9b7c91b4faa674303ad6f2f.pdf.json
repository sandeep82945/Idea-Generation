    "abstractText": "We study the behavior of a quantum particle trapped in a confining potential in one dimension under multiple sudden changes of velocity and/or acceleration. We develop the appropriate formalism to deal with such situation and we use it to calculate the probability of transition for simple problems such as the particle in an infinite box and the simple harmonic oscillator. For the infinite box of length L under two and three sudden changes of velocity, where the initial and final velocity vanish, we find that the system undergoes quantum revivals for \u2206t = \u03c40 \u2261 4mL 2 \u03c0~ , regardless of other parameters (\u2206t is the time elapsed between the first and last change of velocity). For the simple harmonic oscillator we find that the states obtained by suddenly changing (one change) the velocity and/or the acceleration of the potential, for a particle initially in an eigenstate of the static potential, are coherent states. For multiple changes of acceleration or velocity we find that the quantum expectation value of the Hamiltonian is remarkably close (possibly identical) to the corresponding classical expectation values. Finally, the probability of transition for a particle in an accelerating harmonic oscillator (no sudden changes) calculated with our formalism agrees with the formula derived long time ago by Ludwig [1] and recently modified by Dodonov [2], but with a different expression for the dimensionless parameter \u03b3. Our probability agrees with the one of ref. [2] for \u03b3 \u226a 1 but is not periodic in time (it decays monotonously), contrary to the result derived in ref. [2].",

            "text": "In this paper we consider the quantum mechanical problem of a non relativistic particle in a potential in one dimension, that can undergo multiple sudden changes of both velocity and acceleration at given times.\nThis problem falls in the larger class of problems where the Hamiltonian of the system displays an explicit dependence on the time. In the most common situation this explicit time dependence is the result of a time\u2013dependent interaction or of a time\u2013independent interaction that acts over a finite interval of time; alternatively, the time-dependence can enter in the problem through time\u2013dependent boundary conditions or through a not stationary potential (for example, if the potential suddenly changes velocity).\nAn important example of problem belonging to the first class is the infinite square well with a moving wall, studied long time ago by Doescher and Rice [3], for which the solution can be calculated exactly (a generalization of this problem for a wall moving with different laws has been obtained in [4]). In the second class of problems we mention the case of a particle in a one dimensional attractive Dirac delta potential, that suddenly starts to move, originally studied by Granot and Marchewka [5]. This problem has been recently revisited in a paper by two of the present authors [6], extending the analysis to different potentials, using an approach based on a direct spectral decomposition. Additionally, a recent paper by Dodonov [2] considers the interesting problem of calculating the transition amplitudes for a quantum harmonic oscillator (in one dimension) moving with an arbitrary law of motion (this paper also offers a rich bibliography on the subject, that could be of interest to the reader).\nIn this paper we consider the more general problem of calculating the probability of transition for a quantum particle in one dimension when the potential is subject to an arbitrary number of sudden changes in the velocity and/or the acceleration. This discussion constitutes a generalization of our previous work [6], which only considered one change in velocity.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we discuss the solution to the nonrelativistic Schro\u0308dinger equation in presence of acceleration; in section 3 we describe the suitable formalism to deal with sudden changes of the velocity and the acceleration (for technical reasons the discussion is done separately); in section 4 we apply our formalism to study a infinite square well under multiple changes of velocity and a simple harmonic oscillator under multiple changes of both velocity and acceleration (in both cases, we compare the quantum results with the analogous classical results). Finally, in section 5 we draw our conclusion and outline the directions of future work."

The wave function in each time interval will be more conveniently described by the basis\nfor the potential moving with appropriate velocity and with the proper initial conditions (X defines the position of the potential at time T ).\nWe will write the wave function as\n\u03a8(x, t) =\n\n  \n \n\u03a8(1)(x, t) , t \u2264 t1 \u03a8(2)(x, t) , t1 \u2264 t \u2264 t2 \u03a8(3)(x, t) , t2 \u2264 t \u2264 t3\n. . .\n,\nand assume that it is known at a given time, for example, at t = t1.

(16)\n\u2022 t1 < t < t2;\nAs we have already observed, a basis for a potential moving with velocity v is fully determined only when the parameters X and T are specified. In the case of a potential moving with velocity v2 for t1 \u2264 t \u2264 t2, there are two natural choices of basis: {\u03c8k(x, t;x1, t1; v2)} and {\u03c8k(x, t;x2, t2; v2)}. In the first case the basis relates to a potential that at time t1 is centered at x1 and moves with velocity v2, whereas in the second case the basis relates to a potential that at time t2 is centered at x2 and moves with velocity v2. What makes these bases special, among the infinite bases available, is the fact that they allow one to enforce the matching conditions at the times t = t1 and t = t2, where the potential undergoes a sudden change of velocity.\nWe can decompose the wave function \u03a8(2)(x, t) in any of the two bases; in the first case we have\n\u03a8(2)(x, t) = \u2211\nl\nc (2) l \u03c8l(x, t;x1, t1, v2) , (17)\nwhile in the second case we have\n\u03a8(2)(x, t) = \u2211\nl\nc\u0304 (2) l \u03c8l(x, t;x2, t2, v2) . (18)\nBy comparing eqs. (17) and (18) we are able to relate the coefficients of the expansion in the two basis:\nc (2) l = c\u0304 (2) l e\n\u2212imv 2 2(t1\u2212t2)\n2~ ei mv2(x1\u2212x2) ~ e\u2212i El(t1\u2212t2) ~ . (19)\nIt is important to remark that, for the case of a sudden change of velocity, the coefficients in the two basis differ only by a phase (we will soon see that this relation is considerably more complicated in presence of a sudden acceleration).\nThe next step is to enforce the matching condition \u03a8(1)(x, t1) = \u03a8 (2)(x, t1) obtaining\nc (2) k =\n\u2211\nl\nQkl(v1, v2; t1)c(1)l , (20)\nwhere\nQkl(v1, v2; t1) \u2261 \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e \u03c8\u22c6k(y)\u03c8l(y) e\n\u2212im(v2\u2212v1)y ~ dy.\nIt is straightforward to check that Q is unitary and therefore eq. (20) complies with the conservation of probability\n\u2211\nk\n|c(2)k |2 = \u2211\nk\n|c(1)k |2 = 1 . (21)\nNow we are in position of expressing the wave function for t1 < t < t2 in terms of the initial wave function as \u03a8(2)(x, t) = \u2211\nk\nc (2) k \u03c8k(x, t;x1, t1, v2)\n= e\u2212 imv22(t\u2212t1) 2~ + imv2(x\u2212x1) ~ \u2211\nl\nc (1) l\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e e\u2212i m(v2\u2212v1)y ~ K(x\u2212 x1 \u2212 v2(t\u2212 t1), t; y, t1)\u03c8l(y)dy ,\n(22)\nwhere K(x\u2212x1\u2212v2(t\u2212t1), t; y, t1) = \u2211\nk\ne \u2212iEk(t\u2212t1)\n~ \u03c8k(x\u2212x1\u2212v2(t\u2212t1)) \u03c8\u22c6k(y) .\nEq. (22) can finally be cast in a more convenient form\n\u03a8(2)(x, t) = e\u2212 imv22(t\u2212t1) 2~ + imv2(x\u2212x1) ~ e\u2212i mv1x1 ~\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e e\u2212i\nmv2y\n~ K(x\u2212 x1 \u2212 v2(t\u2212 t1), t; y, t1)\u03a8(1)(y, t1)dy ,\n(23)\nwhich reduces, once again, to eq. (16) for v1 = v2 = 0.\nFor tj\u22121 < t < tj we can generalize this formula to\n\u03a8(j)(x, t) = e\u2212 imv2j (t\u2212tj\u22121) 2~ + imvj(x\u2212xj\u22121) ~ e\u2212i mvj\u22121xj\u22121 ~\n\u00b7 \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e e\u2212i\nmvjy\n~ K(x\u2212 xj\u22121 \u2212 vj(t\u2212 tj\u22121), t; y, tj\u22121)\u03a8(j\u22121)(y, tj\u22121)dy ."

What is the probability that the particle is still in the ground state of the box?\nWe assume that at time t1 = 0 the box is centered in the origin (x1 = 0); x2 is the location of the center of the box at t = t2; clearly\nx2 = x1 + v(t2 \u2212 t1) = vt2 .

As we prove\n\u03c0~ \u2248 1.2732).\nnext, 1/2 is just the probability of observing the particle with the final velocity equal to the initial for the corresponding classical system.\nLet us now consider the classical system: in this case we have a particle with initial velocity v0 inside a box that is not moving. At time t1 = 0 the box starts moving with velocity v > 0 and at a later time t2 the box stops.\nWe have two possibilities, to start with: v0 < 0 and v0 > 0.\n\u2022 v0 < 0\nIn this case, the particle has a relative velocity with respect to the left wall \u2212v\u2212 |v0| and when it hits the wall, its relative velocity gets reversed to v + |v0|. The observer, that sees the potential moving with velocity v, in this case sees the particle moving with velocity 2v + |v0|. When the particle reaches the right wall, its velocity gets reversed again and the observer will now see the particle moving with velocity \u2212|v0|.

(46)\nWe also define the statistical average of the maximal classical energies E(+)cl :\nE(+)cl = 1\n2\n[\n1 2 m\n(\n2v \u2212 \u03c0~ Lm\n)2\n+ 1\n2 m\n(\n\u03c0~\nLm + 2v\n)2 ]\n. (47)\nIn Figs. 3 we plot expectation value of the energy of the quantum particle (solid line) and the classical counterpart (red dashed line)\nEcl E1 = 1 + 8\u03b42 \u03c02 , (48)\nfor \u03b4 = 5 and \u03b4 = 20, as a function of the time between the two changes of velocity. The green dashed line corresponds to\nE(+)cl E1 = 1 + 16\u03b42 \u03c02 . (49)\nThe quantum expectation value of the energy is seen to oscillate nicely about the statistical average of the classical energy for the two cases in Figs. 3. Additionally, for the case in Fig. 1 with t = \u03c40/4, which corresponds to the case where the classical and quantum expectation values coincide, the quantum probability P1\u21921 \u2248 0.5, which is also the classical probability of observing the particle with the same initial speed.\nConsider now a particle in the ground state of a static infinite square well at t < 0; at time t1 = 0 the potential (initially centered around x1 = 0) starts to move with velocity v > 0, while at time t = t2 (centered around x2 = x1 + v(t2 \u2212 t1)) it suddenly reverses its velocity and finally at t = t3 (now centered at x3 = x2 \u2212 v(t3 \u2212 t2)) it stops.\nTo make things simpler we will assume t3 = 2t2, so that x3 = 0. In this case the amplitude for the transition from the ground state of the box to any other state can be calculated as\nc (4) l = exp\n(\nimtv2\n~\n)\n\u2211\nk1,k2\nQl,k2(\u2212v, 0)Qk2,k1(v,\u2212v)Qk1,1(0, v)e\u2212 i\u03c02t~(k12+k22) 2L2m .\n(50) The same analysis that we have done for the case of two changes of velocities can be carried out also in this case. In particular the previous discussion for the classical system can be extended to the present case. In this case we find that at the end (after a time 2t) an external observer can detect the speeds: v (2) , 2v+ v0 (2), 2v\u2212 v0 (2), 4v\u2212 v0 (1) and 4v + v0(1).

Once again we see that at t = \u03c40 the system undergoes a quantum revival.\nAt t = \u03c40/4 the system is the most classical, as one can see from Fig. 5: this is also appreciated in the first plot of Fig. 4, where for \u03b4 sufficiently large the probability of staying in the ground state tends to 1/4 (horizontal dashed line). Actually, 1/4 is precisely the classical probability of observing the particle with the same speed, if we do not know its original position (a similar situation occurred for two changes of speed, where in that case the probability is 1/2).\nIn the general case of n changes of velocity, we may expect that the classical probability of finding the particle still in the same state to be 1/2n\u22121.\nAs we can see from Fig. 6, the quantum expectation value of the energy oscillates about the classical value Ecl (red dashed line) and its maximum value is very close to E(+)cl (green dashed line)."

Also observe that |Qk,j(v1, v2, a1, a2; t1)|2 is independent of \u03c1 and that Qk,j(v1, v2, a1, a2; t1) = Qj,k(v1, v2, a1, a2; t1).\nThis formula can be used inside eq. (39) to calculate the probability of transition for a quantum particle in an eigenstate of a uniformly accelerating (with acceleration a) SHO between the times t1 and t2 as 5\nPi\u2192f = |Qf,i(0,\u2212a(t2 \u2212 t1), 0, 0)|2 . (57)\nBy using the explicit expression for Q we find\nPi\u2192f = min(i, f)! max(i, f)! \u03b3|f\u2212i|e\u2212\u03b3 [ L |i\u2212f | min(i,f)(\u03b3)\n]2\n, (58)\nwith \u03b3 = ma 2t2\n2~\u03c9 . The equation above formally agrees with eq. (3) of [2], which was originally derived by Ludwig [1], although with a different \u03b3. The general expression for \u03b3 found by Ludwig, given in eq.(4) of [2], has been deemed incorrect by Dodonov, who has proposed an alternative expression (see eq.(12) of [2]): for the special case of a SHO, \u03b3Dodonov = 2ma2 ~\u03c93 sin 2(\u03c9t/2), which reduces to our expression for \u03c9t\u226a 1, but differs otherwise (we do not find periodic excitations due to constant acceleration). Interestingly, Schwinger finds the transition probability for the electromagnetic field perturbed by a time dependent current to be of the form (58) (see eq.(39) of Ref. [7]), independently of Ludwig.\nWe now consider the case of a single change of acceleration or velocity; if the particle is initially in the ground state of the SHO, under a single change of velocity and acceleration the wave function will have coefficients\nc (2) l = 1\u221a l! e\u2212 1 4 (\u03ba\n2\u22122i\u03ba\u03c1+\u03bb2) ( \u03bb\u2212 i\u03ba\u221a 2\n)l\n, (59)\nand the probability of finding an excited state with quantum number l will be\nP0\u2192l = \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 c (2) l \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2 = e\u2212(\u03ba 2+\u03bb2)/2 1\nl!\n(\n\u03ba2 + \u03bb2\n2\n)l\n. (60)\n5Notice that no change of acceleration is involved.\nIt is important to observe that the state with coefficients (59) is a coherent. Indeed, using the coefficients of eq.(59) and the formulas (84), we find that wave packet propagates without spreading\n\u2206x =\n\u221a\n~\n2m\u03c9 , (61)\nand it is peaked around the expectation value\n\u3008x\u3009 = ( x1 + v2(t\u2212 t1) + a2 2 (t\u2212 t21) ) +\n\u221a\n~\nm\u03c9 (\u03bb cos(\u03c9(t\u2212 t1))\u2212 \u03ba sin(\u03c9(t\u2212 t1))) .\n(62)\nThe first term corresponds to the position of the minimum of the moving potential, whereas the second term corresponds to an oscillatory movement induced by the change of velocity and acceleration.\nIt is easy to see that the maximum of |c(2)l |2 occurs at \u221a \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 = \u221a\n2(l \u2212 1), which corresponds to the condition\n1 2 mv2 +\nma2 2\u03c92 = ~\u03c9(l \u2212 1) . (63)\nA similar experiment can be carried out for the case where the particle is initially in the first excited state of the SHO; in this case we find\nc (2) l = 2\u2212 l 2\u2212 12 \u221a l! e \u2212\u03ba2+2i\u03ba\u03c1\u2212\u03bb2 4 (\u03bb\u2212 i\u03ba)l\u22121 ( \u2212\u03ba2 \u2212 \u03bb2 + 2l )\n(64)\nand\nP1\u2192l = e \u2212(\u03ba2+\u03bb2)/2 1\nl!\n(\n\u03ba2 + \u03bb2\n2\n)l\u22121( \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 2 \u2212 l )2 . (65)\nNotice that the value \u03b7 = \u221a 2l corresponds to a zero of the probability, while the probability now displays two peaks. Using the coefficients above we also find in this case that the wave packet propagates without spreading, with a constant width\n\u2206x =\n\u221a\n3~\n2m\u03c9 (66)\nand it is peaked around the expectation value (62). Similarly for the particle initially in the second excited state we have\nc (2) l = \u2212\n2 1 2 (\u2212l\u22123)e 1 4 (\u2212\u03ba 2+2i\u03ba\u03c1\u2212\u03bb2)(\u03bb\u2212 i\u03ba)l ( ( \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 )2 + 4l2 \u2212 4l ( \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 + 1 ) )\n\u221a l!(\u03ba+ i\u03bb)2\n(67)\nand\nP2\u2192l = 2\u2212l\u22123\nl! e\u2212(\u03ba 2+\u03bb2)/2 (\u03ba2 + \u03bb2 )l\u22122 (( \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 )2 + 4l2 \u2212 4l ( \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 + 1 )\n)2\n.\n(68)\nNotice that the probability has now three peaks for l \u2265 2. Also in this case the wave packet doesn\u2019t spread\n\u2206x =\n\u221a\n5~\n2m\u03c9 , (69)\nand it is peaked around the expectation value (62). We now consider the case of a particle in the ground state of the simple harmonic oscillator a t < t1 = 0. The potential is not moving (v1 = 0 and a1 = 0). For t1 \u2264 t \u2264 t2 the potential moves with velocity v2 and acceleration a2 and at t = t2 it suddenly stops (v3 = 0 and a3 = 0).\nAt t > t3 the wave function of the particle will be \u03a8 = \u2211\u221e j=0 c (3) j \u03c8j , where\nc (3) j =\n\u221e \u2211\nk=0\n\u221e \u2211\nl=0\nexp\n(\nia22m\u03c4 3\n6~ \u2212 ia\n2 2m\u03c4\n2\u03c92~ + ia2m\u03c4 2v2 2~ \u2212 i(l + 1/2)\u03c4\u03c9 + im\u03c4v 2 2 2~\n)\n\u00b7 Qjk(v2, 0, a2, 0)Qkl(0,\u2212a2(t2 \u2212 t1), 0, 0)Ql0(0, v2, 0, a2) , (70)\nand \u03c4 \u2261 t2 \u2212 t1. Notice that if the potential does not accelerate (a2 = 0) Qkl(0, 0, 0, 0) = \u03b4kl and the coefficient takes a much simpler form.\nWe will first consider this case, and calculate the expectation value of the energy at times t > t3 as a function of \u03c4 . The expectation value of the energy (divided by E0) is displayed in Fig. 8, for three different values of \u03ba (solid lines); the dotted lines that nicely overlap with this curves represent the classical expectation value of the energy of eq.(91) for these values of \u03ba. Observe that in this case the system undergoes periodic excitations (and actually the classical energy is actually a periodic function).\nThis analysis has also been extended to the case of a SHO which suddenly accelerates between t = 0 and t = \u03c4 , while being at rest otherwise. The left (right) Fig. 9 shows the probability of transition from the ground (first excited) state to any other state of the SHO due to two sudden changes of acceleration (a1 = a3 = 0, a2 = \u03c93/2 \u221a ~\u221a\nm ) as a function of the time \u03c4 between the two changes.\nThe corresponding expectation values of the energy for the two cases are displayed in the left plot of Fig. 10, where the solid lines (blue and green) represent the quantum result and the dashed lines correspond to the classical expression obtain in the Appendix. The quantum result is essentially indistinguishable from the classical result, something that is better appreciated by looking at the right plot of Fig. 10, where we plot (E(t)\u2212E(cl)(t))/E0 for the case of a particle initially in the ground state of a static SHO at t \u2264 0, if the potential suddenly uniformly accelerates for 0 < t < \u03c4 . The different curves correspond to using 30, 40, 50 and 60 states in the sums (in decreasing order of the plotted quantity)."

            "text": "In this paper we have considered the problem of a quantum particle in a potential that can suddenly change velocity and acceleration multiple times. It is remarkable, in our view, that this problem had not been considered earlier, also taking into account its relevance in describing possible experimental situations (for example the translation of a quantum particle trapped in a potential generated by an optical tweezer). The paper by Dodonov, [2], which has a rich and interesting list of references, analyses the related problem of a potential (simple harmonic oscillator) moving under a general law (no sudden changes).\ndue to two sudden changes of acceleration (a1 = a3 = 0, a2 = \u03c93/2 \u221a ~\u221a\nm ) as a\nfunction of the time \u03c4 between the two changes. The horizontal dashed line is the numerical sum of the probabilities up to the 40 state. The left (right) plot corresponds to having initially the particle in the n = 0 (n = 1) eigenstate of the oscillator.\na change in acceleration at t = t1, going from a1 = 0 to a2 = \u03c93/2 \u221a ~\u221a\nm ; at t = t2\nthe acceleration suddenly stops, a3 = 0. The dotted red lines are the classical value obtained from eq. (91); Right plot: (E(t) \u2212 E(cl)(t))/E0 for the first case plotted in Fig. 10, using 30, 40, 50 and 60 (in order of decreasing values).\nOur results for constant acceleration (no change of acceleration) reproduce the functional form for the probability of transition originally derived by Ludwig long time ago [1], although with a different expression for the parameter \u03b3. Interestingly, one of the main results obtained by Dodonov in [2] is to provide a different expression for \u03b3: our expression and Dodonov\u2019s agree for \u03c9t \u226a 1, but lead to different physical predictions otherwise (in our case there is no periodic excitation).\nThe analysis for two or more changes of velocity and acceleration presented in this paper is based on a rigorous use of spectral decomposition in the basis of the moving potential and it can be applied to general potentials in one or more dimensions, including potentials with a mixed spectrum (discrete and continuum). For the simple harmonic oscillator under sudden changes of velocity and acceleration we have found that the expectation value of the energy for the wave packet generated in this process is very close to the classical expectation value (actually identical within numerical error), an outcome that we interpret as a manifestation of the coherence of the wavepacket."

At t > 0+ the particle is subject to a force F = \u2212m\u03c92x\u2212ma and the solution to the equations of motion are\nx2(t) = \u2212 a\n\u03c92 +A2 cos(\u03c9t+ \u03d52)\nv2(t) = \u2212A2\u03c9 sin(\u03c9t+ \u03d52) (85)\nThe amplitude and phase in this solution are obtained by enforcing the initial conditions:\nx2(0 +) = x0 v2(0 +) = \u2212v + v1\n(86)\nAt t = t2 the potential suddenly stops: in this case we can write the solution for t \u2265 t2 as 6:\nx3(t) = vt2 + 1\n2 at22 +A3 cos(\u03c9t+ \u03d53)\nv3(t) = \u2212A3\u03c9 sin(\u03c9t+ \u03d53) (87)\nThe amplitude and phase in this solution are obtained by enforcing the initial conditions:\nx3(t + 2 ) = vt2 +\n1 2 at22 + x2(t2)\nv3(t + 2 ) = v + at2 + v2(t2)\n(88)\nThe final energy is then\nE3 = 1\n2 m\u03c92A23 (89)\nTo facilitate the comparison with the quantum result we parametrize the initial classical energy as E1 = \u01eb ~\u03c9 2 and consider the ratio E3/E1. It is convenient to express the results in dimensionless form using the parameters \u03ba and \u03bb and defining y \u2261 \u221a\nm\u03c9x0/~; we find\nE3 E1 = 1 \u01eb [ \u01eb+ 2 ( \u03ba2 + \u03bb(y + \u03bb) ) + 2\u03ba\u03bb\u03c4 + \u03bb2\u03c42\n\u2212 2 ( \u03ba2 + \u03bb(y + \u03bb) + \u03ba\u03bb\u03c4 ) cos(\u03c4) \u2212 2(y\u03ba+ \u03bb(y + \u03bb)\u03c4) sin(\u03c4)\n\u00b1 2 \u221a \u2212y2 + \u01eb(\u03ba\u2212 (\u03ba+ \u03bb\u03c4) cos(\u03c4) + \u03bb sin(\u03c4)) ]\n(90)\nNotice that there are two possibilities ( due to the sign \u00b1) and that the energy depends on the initial position of the particle at time t1. Therefore we need to average over the initial position\nE3 E1 \u2261 1 2 \u221a \u01eb\n\u222b \u221a \u01eb\n\u2212\u221a\u01eb E3 E1 dy\n= 1\n2\u01eb\n[ 2\u01eb\u00b1 \u03c0 \u221a \u01eb\u03ba+ 4\u03ba2 + 4\u03ba\u03bb\u03c4 + 2\u03bb2 ( 2 + \u03c42 )\n\u2212 ( 4\u03bb2 + ( \u00b1\u03c0 \u221a \u01eb+ 4\u03ba ) (\u03ba+ \u03bb\u03c4) ) cos(\u03c4) + \u03bb ( \u00b1\u03c0 \u221a \u01eb \u2212 4\u03bb\u03c4 ) sin(\u03c4) ]\n(91)\nSince there two different expressions and correspond to equally probable situations, we still need to take the statistical average of the two\nE3 E1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\ns.a.\n\u2261 1 \u01eb [ \u01eb+ 2\u03ba2 + 2\u03ba\u03bb\u03c4 + \u03bb2 ( 2 + \u03c42 ) \u2212 2 ( \u03ba2 + \u03bb2 + \u03ba\u03bb\u03c4 ) cos(\u03c4)\u2212 2\u03bb2\u03c4 sin(\u03c4) ]\n(92)\n6Notice that vt2 + 1\n2 at\n2 2 is the position of the minimum of the potential at t \u2265 t2"
