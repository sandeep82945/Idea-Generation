 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the mechanism of the abrupt decrease in intracellular RSS content in the âˆ†adpA mutant during late cultivation. Identify if other regulators besides AdpA control thioredoxin expression or if other factors besides thioredoxins contribute to RSS removal. 

2. Explore the interplay between AdpA regulation of thioredoxins and SoxR regulation of thioredoxins in response to oxidative stress. Determine if they act synergistically or if one predominates. 

3. Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which RSS induces AdpA expression and activity. Identify specific cysteine residues modified by persulfidation and how this impacts DNA binding and transcription activation.

4. Analyze the effects of overexpressing different combinations of thioredoxins and thioredoxin reductases in S. coelicolor. Determine if certain pairings are more effective at removing excess RSS.

5. Investigate if AdpA regulation of thioredoxins to maintain redox balance is conserved across other Streptomyces species. Compare regulons and oxidative stress responses.
