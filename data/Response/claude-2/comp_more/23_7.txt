 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Expand the training dataset to include more diverse and complex analogies to further test if analogical reasoning can be learned. The current dataset is relatively small.

2. Explore different model architectures and training techniques beyond BERT to see if they can better learn analogical reasoning. For example, trying different pooling methods when creating word embeddings from BERT.

3. Test how well the models can generalize to completely unseen analogy types and relations, not just unseen examples. The current evaluation still contains entities seen during training.

4. Further analyze model performance on subgroups like near vs far analogies to better understand model capabilities and limitations. The trends in the paper don't fully match human performance. 

5. Develop better methods to account for semantic similarity and word frequency biases when evaluating model performance on analogies. The current analysis shows these factors impact accuracy. New evaluation methods could better isolate reasoning abilities.
