    "abstractText": "Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common pathogens associated with infection in wounds. The current standard of care uses a combination of disinfection and drainage followed by conventional antibiotics such as methicillin. Methicillin and vancomycin resistance has rendered these treatments ineffective, often causing the reemergence of infection. This study examines the use of antimicrobial peptoids (sequence-specific poly-N-substituted glycines) designed to mimic naturally occurring cationic, amphipathic host defense peptides, as an alternative to conventional antibiotics. These peptoids also show efficient and fast (,30 min) killing of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at low micromolar concentrations without having apparent cytotoxic side effects in vivo. Additionally, these novel peptoids show excellent efficacy against biofilm formation and detachment for both MSSA and MRSA. In comparison, conventional antibiotics were unable to detach or prevent formation of biofilms. One cationic 12mer, Peptoid 1, shows great promise, as it could prevent formation of and detach biofilms at concentrations as low as 1.6 mM. The use of a bioluminescent S. aureus murine incision wound model demonstrated clearance of infection in peptoid-treated mice within 8 days, conveying another advantage these peptoids have over conventional antibiotics. These results provide clear evidence of the potential for antimicrobial peptoids for the treatment of S. aureus wound infections. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus resistance is a consistent problem with a large impact on the health care system. Infections with resistant S. aureus can cause serious adverse effects and can result in death. These antimicrobial peptoids show efficient killing of bacteria both as a biofilm and as free bacteria, often doing so in less than 30 min. As such, these antimicrobials have the potential to alleviate the burden that Staphylococcus infections have on the health care system and cause better outcomes for infected patients.",

Infections with resistant S. aureus can cause serious adverse effects and can result in death. These antimicrobial peptoids show efficient killing of bacteria both as a biofilm and as free bacteria, often doing so in less than 30 min. As such, these antimicrobials have the potential to alleviate the burden that Staphylococcus infections have on the health care system and cause better outcomes for infected patients.\nKEYWORDS Staphylococcus aureus, antimicrobial peptides, chemical synthesis\nAntimicrobials are one of the most beneficial discoveries in all of medical history forhumans. The use of these molecules has allowed for enhanced longevity of life through means such as livestock welfare and postsurgical infection prevention.

While some drugs such as vancomycin were in use for 30 years before bacteria developed resistance to them (3, 4), it is inevitable that resistance develops over time to typically used classes of antibiotics.\nStaphylococcus aureus is an example of bacteria found in the upper respiratory tract and skin flora for humans that have developed antibiotic resistance (5, 6). S. aureus is Gram-positive and a facultative anaerobe that can form biofilms. Initial treatments of S. aureus infections included penicillin and methicillin, but clinical practice has evolved to utilize other antibiotics such as vancomycin. Resistance in S. aureus has grown at a rapid pace since they were first treated with penicillin and methicillin. Resistance to these two antibiotics was reported at an incidence of around 0.4% of the total infections tested in 1960 (7). A study of resistance between 2009 and 2014 showed nearly all strains are resistant to penicillin G and 20% are resistant to methicillin (8). Additionally, this report showed that cultures display resistance to other antibiotics such as rifampin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. Vancomycin has been considered the go-to drug for those allergic to penicillin and for resistant cases; however, clinical isolates resistant to vancomycin began to appear as early as 1997 (4). As such, it is necessary to develop and pursue other classes of antimicrobials that are effective against all types of bacteria and to which bacteria do not develop resistance.\nNature has given us a variety of antimicrobial molecules that are part of the mammalian immune system and that act by diverse mechanisms. Many of these natural products are produced as a defense mechanism to protect against pathogens at barrier tissues. Some of these antimicrobials are peptides, commonly referred to as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). As a general rule, these peptides tend to be less than 50 amino acids in length, are positively charged (net charge of 12 to 19), amphipathic and have about 50% hydrophobic residues (9, 10). a-helical AMPs have been studied extensively and this important group includes well-known AMPs such as the magainins and cathelicidins (9). These AMPs disrupt and pass through the cell membrane, either by pore formation or changes to lipid packing and dynamics, as seen by some magainins, protegrins and LL-37, which is the only human cathelicidin peptide (11\u201313). LL-37 is involved in numerous cellular functions, including defense against a broad range of microbial infections, and immunomodulation (14). LL-37 has been determined to not only target the membrane of microbes, but also has key intracellular effects, including ribosome flocculation, DNA and RNA binding (15), and a resulting rigidification of the cytoplasm (16). While AMPs have shown relative effectiveness against the development of bacterial resistance, they are easily degradable by proteases. As such, antimicrobial poly-N-substituted glycines (peptoids) present a solution to this problem. Peptoids are resistant to protease degradation due to the positioning of their side chain (R) groups on the nitrogen atom of the polypeptide backbone, rather than the a-carbon (17). In addition, they are easier and less expensive to synthesize than regular a-peptides. Similar to LL-37, Peptoid 1 has been shown to selfassemble in solution forming helical bundles (18). The mechanism of antibacterial and antifungal action for various AMP-mimetic peptoids has been investigated (15, 19, 20), and involves a combination of membrane disruption and profound intracellular effects, including DNA- and RNA-binding and ribosome flocculation, similar to what has been observed for LL-37 (15).\nPeptoid 1 has previously been shown to have potent activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including resistant strains (18, 21\u201324), fungi (18), and viruses (25) while showing minimal cytotoxicity profiles against a number of mammalian cell lines (21, 25), and almost no toxicity to primary human cells grown at the air-liquid interface (25). Interestingly, Peptoid 1 has been shown to be extremely effective in preventing biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to standard antibiotics (23, 24), activity that is particularly relevant because of the tendency for wound infections to involve the growth of a strong biofilm. Peptoids also recently have been demonstrated to reduce bacterial counts in a murine model of an invasive S. aureus infection\nMonth YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/spectrum.00534-22 2\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh ttp\ns: //j\nou rn\nal s.\nas m\n.o rg\n/jo ur\nna l/s\npe ct\nru m\no n\n27 A\npr il\n20 22\nb y\n19 2.\n41 .1\n25 .2\n54 .\n(26, 27). Remarkably, Peptoid 1 and several analogues have been proven to retain their anti-biofilm activity even in the context of polymicrobial infections comprised by clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in host-mimicking conditions in vitro (18). In a murine abscess model, where Peptoid 1 was injected into the abscess, Peptoid 1 reduced both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus abscess size and bacterial load (18).\nIn this study, we investigated whether Peptoid 1 and two variants can be used for the topical treatment of wound infections, and against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. Initially, peptoids were evaluated against planktonic S. aureus, but were subsequently evaluated for their ability to prevent biofilm formation and facilitate biofilm detachment. The peptoids that were tested, especially Peptoid 1, show promise at killing both resistant and nonresistant S. aureus. Additionally, Peptoid 1 was able to prevent biofilm formation and to detach existing biofilms. Topical application of Peptoid 1 or Peptoid 1-C134mer in a PBS solution to a murine wound model showed a statistically significant reduction in bacterial counts compared to a saline-treated control group. These results demonstrate the potential of antimicrobial peptoids in the treatment of S. aureus biofilms and wound infections, as well as the potential for their use against other pathogenic bacteria. Taken together, results indicate that peptoids hold forth promise to be clinically translated as an important new class of broad-spectrum antibiotic drugs."

            "text": "Peptoid design. Prior studies with the 12mer Peptoid 1 have shown great promise\nagainst planktonic S. aureus and biofilm-forming bacteria (18, 21, 23, 24, 27). The design of this peptoid was originally inspired by that of magainin-2, an antimicrobial peptide found in Xenopus laevis, and consists of four lysine-like monomers (NLys) and eight phenylalanine-like monomers (N-1-S-phenylethyl, Nspe) patterned to give the peptoid helical, water-soluble, and amphipathic properties (24). Biophysical mechanism of action studies by TEM and soft X-ray tomography showed that Peptoid 1 is a particularly good mimic of the human cathelicidin AMP LL-37 (17). Since Peptoid 1 has strong activity, two related peptoids, Peptoid 1-11mer and Peptoid 1-C134mer were synthesized as mimics with slightly different properties (Table 1). These also mimic cationic AMPs like magainin-2; however, they have slightly different charges, amphipathicity, and length, allowing for better activity and selectivity against bacteria. Peptoid 1-11mer has one fewer Nspe residue than Peptoid 1 and lower relative cytotoxicity compared to other peptoids (23, 28). Peptoid 1-C134mer is five residues long total, with its amino-terminal peptoid side chain being a 13-carbon-long N-alkyl tail, which has shown good activity against biofilms (23, 24). The long alkyl tail of Peptoid 1-C134mer promotes its self-assembly into ellipsoidal micelles, rather than helical bundles as for Peptoid 1 (18). The chemical structures of the peptoids used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1, with their respective monomer sequences given in Table 1.\nDetermination of peptoid effectiveness against S. aureus infections. MICs for these peptoids were evaluated against strains of S. aureus (Table 1). The TFA salt of Peptoid 1 had an MIC of ,0.78 mM for both MRSA and Xen29, and 12.5 mM for Xen36. Peptoid 1-C134mer had MICs of 12.5 mM for MRSA and Xen29, and 25 mM for Xen36, while Peptoid 1-11mer had MICs of 50 mM for MRSA, and 25 mM for Xen29 and Xen36.\nMonth YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/spectrum.00534-22 3\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh ttp\ns: //j\nou rn\nal s.\nas m\n.o rg\n/jo ur\nna l/s\npe ct\nru m\no n\n27 A\npr il\n20 22\nb y\n19 2.\n41 .1\n25 .2\n54 .\nWhen neutralized into the chloride salt, MICs against MRSA were 3.125 mM for Peptoid 1 and Peptoid 1-C134mer, and 25 mM for Peptoid 1-11mer, while Xen36 had MICs of 1.56 mM, 3.125 mM, and 12.5 mM for Peptoid 1, Peptoid 1-C134mer, and Peptoid 1-11mer, respectively. To compare, antibiotics such as amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin had little effect on MRSA, with an MIC .100 mM (Table 2). Both antibiotics were highly effective against the methicillinsusceptible strain, Xen29, yielding MICs ,0.78 mM. Ciprofloxacin also showed good effectiveness against Xen36 with an MIC of 1.6mM, however, amoxicillin was ineffective with an MIC .100 mM. While these antibiotics are typically used for nonresistant S. aureus, Vancomycin and Daptomycin are often used for drug-resistant strains. Daptomycin was minimally effective, with MICs of 50 mM and 25 mM for MRSA and Xen36, respectively. Vancomycin, the \u201cgold-standard\u201d for drug-resistant S. aureus, had MICs of 0.195 mM for MRSA and 0.39mM for Xen36.\nSince MRSA is a drug-resistant strain, it was necessary to determine the concentration necessary for complete killing for these peptoids. After colonies had been counted, Peptoid 1 provided complete killing at a concentration greater than 1.56 mM and 6.25 mM for Xen36 and MRSA, respectively (Fig. 2a and b). Peptoid 1 was effective against the drug-susceptible, Xen29 strain, showing zero living CFU/mL at Peptoid 1 concentrations higher than 1.56 mM. For Peptoid 1-C134mer, all three strains showed complete killing at a concentration of 6.25 mM and above (Fig. 2).

CFU were calculated for vancomycin and daptomycin since they are utilized against drug-resistant S. aureus. Daptomycin only showed complete killing above 50 mM for Xen36, and 100 mM for MRSA 252 (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast to the poor killing by daptomycin, vancomycin showed complete killing for both strains above a concentration of 0.39 mM (Fig. 2a, b). Interestingly, Xen29 did not show complete killing for either antibiotic up to 50 mM, whereas it showed nearly complete killing for daptomycin at this concentration (Fig. 2c). All treatments showed a statistically significant decrease (P , 0.01) at all concentrations compared to nontreated cells for the Xen29 strain. Statistically, vancomycin showed a significant decrease (P , 0.01) in CFU compared to nontreated cells from 0.39mM and upward for the Xen36 strain and MRSA 252. In comparison, Peptoid 1 showed statistically significant decrease (P, 0.01) in CFU compared to nontreated cells from 0.78mM and higher in MRSA 252 and 1.56mM in Xen36.\nCytotoxicity of peptoids. Cytotoxicity of these peptoids to macrophages by comparison to conventional antibiotics was determined using J774A.1 mouse macrophages and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Incubation with peptoids allowed for the calculation of J774A.1 cells showed a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 12.5 mM for Peptoid 1, while Peptoid 1-11mer had an IC50 of 50 mM (Fig. 3). Peptoid 1-C134mer had the highest IC50, at 100 mM, while both vancomycin and daptomycin had an IC50 greater than the highest concentration tested at 256 mM. The 3T3 cells showed an IC50 for Peptoid 1 of 15 mM, while Peptoid 1-11mer had an IC50 of about 45 mM (Fig. S1).\nFIG 2 Legend (Continued) here, Peptoid 1-11mer didn\u2019t show significance again until 6.25 mM. Similarly, daptomycin showed significance at 0.39 mM but didn\u2019t show significance again until 3.125 mM. Daptomycin remained statistically significant until 6.5 mM, but only regained significance compared to the no treatment control from 25 mM onward. (b) Vancomycin once again showed significance at 0.39 mM compared to the no treatment control, this time for the clinical MRSA 252 strain. Peptoid 1 showed significance starting at 0.78 mM, while Peptoid 1-C134mer showed significance starting at 1.56 mM. Peptoid 1-11mer showed significance 6.25 mM and daptomycin showed significance starting at 12.5 mM. (c) All treatments showed significance starting at 0.39 mM for Xen29.

In general, when AMPs and their mimics are tested against immortalized cell lines such as these mouse macrophages, they show apparently higher toxicities than are seen against primary human cells (29).\nEffect of peptoids on biofilm formation and detachment. Biofilm formation is often a problem for drug effectiveness and ability of a patient to eliminate a pathogen like S. aureus. To test whether these peptoids could prevent biofilm formation, MRSA was cultured with various concentrations of peptoid, antimicrobial peptide, or antibiotic. Results from this assay showed a complete reduction of biofilm formation at 1.6 mM Peptoid 1 and at 12.5 mM for Peptoid 1-C134mer (Fig. 4a).

In comparison, amoxicillin was able to reduce biofilm formation by 97% percent at 50mM and ciprofloxacin only reduced biofilm formation by 49%. The human cathelicidn LL-37 was only able to reduce biofilm formation by 41%. The methicillin-susceptible strain, Xen29, showed complete reduction of biofilm formation by Peptoid 1 at 1.6 mM as well (Fig. S2a); however, Xen36 only showed a 74% reduction (Fig. S2b). Peptoid 1-C134mer showed complete prevention of biofilm formation at 12.5 mM in Xen29 and a reduction of 40% by 50 mM in Xen36. In Xen36, Peptoid 1-11mer reduced biofilm formation by 70% at 50 mM, however, Peptoid 1-11mer did not appear to influence biofilm formation in Xen29. This was interesting, as this pattern appeared to be similar for LL-37. In Xen36, there was a 60% reduction and no apparent reduction in Xen29. Ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation by 0.9 mM in Xen29 and reduced formation of biofilms by 75% above a concentration of 1.5mM in Xen36. Similarly, amoxicillin prevented formation of biofilms in Xen29 by 0.39 mM, however, there was minimal reduction of biofilm by a concentration of 50mM in Xen36.\nWhile prevention of biofilm formation is important at the beginning of infection, it is also necessary to reduce biofilm that has already formed, especially in cases which have been left untreated. As such, a detachment assay was used by measuring biomass of biofilm remaining after treatment with peptoids, AMPs, or antibiotics. Peptoid 1 was able to detach all biofilm by a concentration of 1.6 mM in MRSA (Fig. 4b) and Xen29 (Fig. S3a), however, it was only able to detach up about 75\u201380% of biofilms at 50 mM in Xen36 (Fig. S3b7). Interestingly, complete biofilm detachment in MRSA was seen by Peptoid 1-C134mer at 12.5 mM and Peptoid 1-11mer at 50 mM. In Xen29, on the other hand, detachment reached 35% for Peptoid 1-C134mer and 25% for Peptoid 1-11mer by 50 mM. Xen36 showed more promising results for Peptoid 1-C134mer with reduction of biofilm by 70% at 50 mM; however, Peptoid 1-11mer fared about the same, with a reduction of only 30% at that same concentration. LL-37 detached biofilms poorly, with 35%, 22%, and 20% for MRSA, Xen29, and Xen36, respectively. Amoxicillin eliminated all biofilm by 50 mM in Xen29, however, only resulted in 33% reduction in MRSA and 8% in Xen36 at that same concentration. Detachment of biofilms in ciprofloxacin was poor for MRSA, 6%, and Xen29, 15%; however it was able to reduce about 60% of Xen36 biofilms by 50 mM. These experiments showed the possibility of these peptoids to be useful in vitro, so it was necessary to validate these results in vivo as well. Since Peptoid 1 and Peptoid 1-C134mer appeared to be the most promising candidates based on the data presented here together with previous data showing activity against S. aureus abscesses when injected in a mouse model (18), these were selected to move on to further studies in mice using a topical application.\nEfficacy of peptoids in murine incision wound model. In order to see the effectiveness of these peptoids in vivo, mice were injected with bioluminescent S. aureus Xen36 via a murine incision wound model. Mice were treated with a high dosage of peptoid in PBS due to the inefficiency of drug delivery through the scab of the wound. After 1 day, both control and Peptoid 1-treated mice showed flux of about 106 photons/second (Fig. 5). After day 3, flux in the Peptoid 1 treated mice were lower than the initial injection. By day 8, control mice showed two main areas of flux, while Peptoid 1-treated mice showed minimal flux. Upon further investigation, it became clear that the mice had flux from deeper within the wound (Fig. S4). In addition to the deeper flux seen in these mice, treatment with peptoid when dissolved in water required 8 as much peptoid than when treated with peptoid dissolved in PBS, likely due to reduced peptoid self-assembly and solubility in the absence of salt to screen peptoidpeptoid intermolecular interactions (Fig. S5). When taking this all into account and quantifying, bacteria clearance in Peptoid 1 treated mice reduced flux by 90%, while the PBS control reduced the flux by 15% (Fig. 6). Despite the high concentration of peptoid used, mice did not appear to suffer any adverse side effects from treatment, likely because the peptoids are less cytotoxic to primary murine epithelial cells than they are to immortalized murine macrophages.

Interestingly, both sets of control (untreated) mice using in the studies for Peptoid 1 and Peptoid 1-C134mer showed a secondary site of flux form by day 8.\nTimeframe of activity for peptoids versus traditional antibiotics. Since these peptoids showed promise as potential therapeutics, the time frame necessary to kill S. aureus was tested for these and traditionally used antibiotics (Fig. S7). Bioluminescence was measured for S. aureus incubated with peptoids at concentrations ranging from 0.39\u2013 50 mM for a total of 60 min, taking readings every 5 min for the first 30 min. Interestingly, it appeared that Peptoid 1 was able to kill Xen29 to background levels of luminescence in 30 min at concentrations of 1.5 mM and higher (Fig. 7a). Peptoid 1-C134mer was able to kill Xen29 to background levels at concentrations of 6.25 mM and greater by 30 min, while Peptoid 1-11mer was able to achieve background levels at concentrations higher than 12.5 mM (Fig. 7b and c). LL-37, vancomycin, and daptomycin were unable to kill Xen29 to background levels by 30 min, however, vancomycin and daptomycin showed lower levels\nFIG 6 (a) In vivo bioluminescence imaging flux results versus day for the murine wound model experiment.

As such, all three peptoids took considerably less time than typically used antibiotics with respect to the killing of S. aureus without resistance. To test whether resistant bacteria showed this same effect, Xen36 was subjected to the same conditions as done for Xen29. Interestingly, both Peptoid 1 and Peptoid 1-C134mer were able to kill Xen36 to background levels of luminescence at concentrations of greater than and equal to 1.5 mM and 6.25 mM within 30 min, respectively, similar to their effect in Xen29 (Fig. 8a-b). Peptoid 1-11mer was far less effective in Xen36 and was unable to fully kill Xen36 to background levels by 30 min (Fig. 8c). Both LL-37 and daptomycin were unable to kill Xen36 at any concentrations under 50 mM, despite incubation for 210 min (Fig. 8d, f). Vancomycin was unable to reach background levels of luminescence at all tested concentrations by 30 min, however, all concentrations were able to get close to background levels of luminescence by 210 min (Fig. 8e). CFU data seen in Fig. 2 confirmed that there was complete killing of S. aureus for the tested peptoids and antibiotics."

            "text": "The peptoids described in this study show the potential as novel therapeutic agents. This is exemplified by the low concentrations needed for complete killing of both MSSA and MRSA strains, especially by Peptoid 1 but also by Peptoid 1-C134mer. Interestingly, it appears that the TFA salt form of Peptoid 1 was more effective for MRSA 252 but the chloride salt was better for the bioluminescent Xen36 strain. For both Peptoid 1-C134mer and Peptoid 1-11mer, improvements in MICs were seen for the chloride salt. This difference is likely due to the change of charge of the molecule with respect to each salt; however, further testing is needed to confirm this. TFA ions can also be cytotoxic. Calculation of CFU for both methicillin-resistant strains incubated with peptoid confirmed complete killing at concentrations well below their respective IC50. This suggests that treatment of infections with these peptoids will be safe enough to prevent harmful side effects.\nWhile killing planktonic bacteria is necessary to clear infections in patients, S. aureus is also known to form biofilms, especially in hospital settings (30). As such, we conducted experiments to determine the ability of these peptoids to prevent the formation of biofilms and to accomplish the detachment of biofilms. Interestingly, these peptoids were the only treatment that could completely prevent formation of or detachment of biofilms. Peptoid 1 once again showed the best prevention and detachment, doing so at concentrations around 1.6 mM for MRSA. It is unknown exactly how these peptoids are able to prevent biofilm formation and detach biofilms, however, it is likely related to their ability to kill planktonic S. aureus and possibly to interaction with biofilm matrix elements.\nSince most infections of S. aureus are seen in wounds, we sought out to identify whether topical application of Peptoid 1 and Peptoid 1-C134mer, the most promising candidates, would reduce infection in a murine incision wound model. Even though the peptoids previously have been shown to be active against S. aureus in an in vivo murine abscess the peptoids in this case were administered via injection rather than being applied topically to the wound. Topical administration is preferred for wound infections over subcutaneous injections as it is less invasive, and easier for patient selfadministration. After 8 days postinfection, there was greater than 99% reduction of bioluminescence for Peptoid 1-treated mice, suggesting clearance in these mice. Control mice, on the other hand, still had significant amounts of bacterial bioluminescence present. There was some reduction compared to initial dosage in the control mice, likely due to the innate immune system. Additionally, control mice did not clear the infection in the allotted time frame, suggesting that the innate immune response alone is not enough to eliminate the bacteria. It should be noted that despite the high concentration of peptoid used in these studies, the mice did not show any signs of visible toxicity. This may be due to the inefficiency of the peptoid to penetrate through the wound based on topical application. This does, however, suggest that peptoids\nMonth YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/spectrum.00534-22 11\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh ttp\ns: //j\nou rn\nal s.\nas m\n.o rg\n/jo ur\nna l/s\npe ct\nru m\no n\n27 A\npr il\n20 22\nb y\n19 2.\n41 .1\n25 .2\n54 .\nMonth YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/spectrum.00534-22 12\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh ttp\ns: //j\nou rn\nal s.\nas m\n.o rg\n/jo ur\nna l/s\npe ct\nru m\no n\n27 A\npr il\n20 22\nb y\n19 2.\n41 .1\n25 .2\n54 .\nlikely will have minimal side effects in vivo. This result is consistent with previous studies demonstrating nontoxicity of peptoids in vivo (28). Since these data were all collected using bioluminescent imaging (BLI), it allows for fewer mice to be necessary, as it monitors flux in real-time. This is a distinct advantage over traditionally used methods as it does not require sacrifice of mice until the experiment has concluded. The use of BLI revealed inadequacies of current protocols for wound models. Many wound models suggest putting controls and treatment on the same mouse, however, results from our study show migration of infection within a single mouse. This would suggest that the use of one mouse may not necessarily mimic the bio-physiological characteristics of a health and compromised individual simultaneously. In addition to this, lesion size does not necessarily correlate to resolution of infected wounds, as bacteria often present in the deeper layers of tissue and travel to areas away from the initial infection site. Currently, the endpoints of wound healing are mainly measured by the closure of the wound along with absence of the pathogen from the initial wound site. Since bacteria can penetrate deeper into tissues, it is necessary to monitor infection throughout the body to prevent reemergence of infection. Future studies to determine the length of time needed after traditionally used measurements are needed for full clearance.\nIn this study, we showed the efficacy of antimicrobial peptoids against S. aureus, including resistant strains, both in vitro and in vivo. We were able to show that these peptoids are fast and efficient killers, doing so in very few minutes. Future studies on improving topical treatments may prove even more valuable in decreasing the amount of peptoid needed as a treatment. Furthermore, the effect of peptoid treatment on immunochemical parameters, including inflammation markers should be assessed, in order to better understand in depth, the effect of peptoids on infection control."

            "text": "Peptoid synthesis. Peptoid synthesis was carried out using an ABI 433A (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) peptide synthesizer and a Symphony X (Gyros Protein Technologies, Tucson, AZ) peptide synthesizer located at the Molecular Foundry in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. Peptoids were synthesized on a Rink amide MBHA resin (EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ). All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Synthesis followed the submonomer protocol from Zuckermann, et al. (31). Peptoids were cleaved from the resin by treating with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA):triisopropylsilane:water (95:2.5:2.5 volume ratio) for 10 min. A C18 column in a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) was used for purification with a linear acetonitrile and water gradient with a compound purity greater than 95% as measured by analytical reverse-phased HPLC. Confirmation of the peptoid synthesis was determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.\nIn vitro antimicrobial activity against bioluminescent S. aureus. Bioluminescent Xen 29 and Xen 36 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains (obtained from Xenogen Corp. now part of PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with shaking overnight with 200 mM kanamycin. 2:1 serially diluted concentrations of 50 mL peptoids (200 mM \u2013 1.6 mM) were added to a 96-well plate (black plate with clear bottom). Then, 1 106 CFU in 50 mL of the overnight culture was added into the 96-well plate to create a 100 mL 1:1 peptoid: bacterial solution.\nThe kinetics of the cell killing was monitored by bioluminescent imaging using an IVIS200 (PerkinElmer) and data were analyzed using the Living Image software (PerkinElmer). The luminescence signal was measured every 5 min for 80 min. The MIC was determined after 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data were analyzed in the GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA).\nAntimicrobial activity of compounds against MRSA. The methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain used was MRSA 252, a hospital-acquired strain isolated in the United Kingdom. MRSA252 was grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani broth (LB, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). The MIC of the antimicrobials was determined from a range of 0\u2013100 mM by a serial dilution in polypropylene 96-well microtiter plates (BD Bioscience) in accordance with CLSI M7-A6 protocols. To 50 mL of antimicrobial solution (prepared using 2:1 serial dilutions), 50 mL of bacterial solution (1 106 CFU/mL) prepared in LB was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. MIC was defined as the concentration at which no visible growth was seen when incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h (h). Bacterial count (CFU/mL) of each strain was determined by OD600. Samples were also plated in LB broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in order to determine whether there was complete killing.\nIn vitro biofilm formation assay. In a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask, 400 mL of Staph/MRSA inoculum (1 106 CFU/mL), prepared in LB and allowed to grow at 37\u00b0C, was added to 40 mL of antimicrobial solution (prepared by 2:1 serial dilutions in TSB). After 24 h, cells were stained by addition of 10 mL (mL) of a 0.5% (wt/vol) crystal violet (CV) solution. Following an incubation of 20 min (min) at room temperature, the supernatant (150 mL) was removed, and wells were washed three times with 200 mL double distilled water, followed by three times blotting on the paper towel, to remove planktonic, unattached, and\nMonth YYYY Volume XX Issue XX 10.1128/spectrum.00534-22 13\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh ttp\ns: //j\nou rn\nal s.\nas m\n.o rg\n/jo ur\nna l/s\npe ct\nru m\no n\n27 A\npr il\n20 22\nb y\n19 2.\n41 .1\n25 .2\n54 .\nweakly attached cells. 200 mL of 95% (vol/vol) ethanol was added to dissolve the CV stain. The percentage of biofilm formation was determined by measuring the UV absorbance of CV stain at l = 600 nm using a microtiter plate.\nIn vitro biofilm detachment assay. The detachment assay was performed by pregrowing Staph/ MRSA biofilms in LB without the presence of an antibiotic in 96-well plates at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Planktonic, unattached, and weakly attached cells were removed by washing the biofilms three times with LB. To the test wells, 50 mL of antimicrobial solution (prepared by 2:1 serial dilutions in LB) and 50 mL LB were added. After 24 h at 37\u00b0C, biofilm reduction was determined by following the CV staining process and measuring the UV absorbance of CV stain at l = 600 nm using a plate reader.\nCytotoxicity of peptoids using MTS assay. Peptoid cytotoxicity has been extensively studied by Huang and Czyzeweski (26, 28) and their protocol was followed. J774A.1 macrophages and 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were cultured and then exposed to peptoid for 4 h in an (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay (MTS) to determine cytotoxicity. Briefly, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Media and then added to a 2:1 serially diluted peptoid solution plate in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution. Then 20 mL of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) reagent which contains a tetrazolium compound, [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS(a)], was added to each well and cells were further incubated for 2 h to metabolize. After which, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a plate reader. Experiments were performed in triplicate.\nMurine incision wound model. Female CD1 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and, on day 0, anesthetized using isoflurane, hair on the dorsal side was shaved, and the skin was sterilized with an alcohol swab. A 1 cm long incision was made with scissors on the preshaved dorsal surface of the mice. A subcutaneous pocket was then produced using the end of the scissors and 1 106 CFU of the bioluminescent S. aureus bacteria in 20 mL was injected into the pocket with a pipette. The wound was then sealed with Vetbond veterinary adhesive. The infection was always subcutaneous, and we were careful not to cause any bleeding. Bacterial growth over time was tracked and quantitated by BLI, using Living Image Software (Perkin Elmer) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In order to test the antibacterial activity of the peptoids, after the establishment of the infection at day 1, wounds on half of the mice (n = 4) were treated topically with 60mL of peptoid in water or PBS, while wounds on the remaining mice were treated with 60 mL of the control solution (water or PBS). After treatments, the mice continued to remain anesthetized for up to half hour until the treatment solution dried. From days 1 to 7, the mice were imaged daily for growth of infection before the treatment was applied. Mice were randomly selected and divided into groups based on treatment. Many treatments were tested, including water (control), PBS (control), Peptoid 1 in PBS or water (with concentrations varying from 100\u2013800 mM), and Peptoid 1-C134mer in PBS or water (with concentrations varying from 100\u2013800 mM). The kinetics of the cell killing was monitored by BLI performed using an IVIS 200 (PerkinElmer). The mice were anesthetized by isoflurane and bioluminescence was recorded for 60 s (s) at medium binning, and analyzed using the Living Image Software, with equal region of interest measurements. To determine the pervasiveness of the infection in untreated wounds, after imaging wounds from the control mice treated with PBS, animals were sacrificed and a tissue section that included the wound area was excised. The section was placed in the IVIS and bioluminescence was measured, after which the section was flipped upside down in order to image the luminescence from the underside of the wound. In this manner, it could be determined if the bacteria were residing on the surface or beneath the surface of the wound. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use for Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and used a protocol approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nStatistical analyses and animal numbers. The minimum numbers of animals that would allow statistically significant differences to be observed were used in all experiments. This estimate was based on power analysis using conditions that will allow sensitivity for 2-fold differences at a P value of 0.05 and an estimated standard deviation based on our previous studies with similar experimental strategies and imaging technologies. Unless stated otherwise, comparison of three or more groups were by ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer post hoc pairwise t test. The Student's t test was used for pairwise comparisons. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant."
