            "text": "The increase in environmental protection awareness and the massive consumption of fossil fuels have greatly affected renewable biomass resources, which have attracted great attention of many people as an alternative to fossil fuels. Lignocellulose biomass consisting of cellulose (40\u201350%), hemicellulose (25\u201335%) and lignin (15\u201320%) is the most abundant renewable biomass.1 One of the challenges of lignocellulose biomass conversion is to obtain target oxygencontaining chemicals, which are more useful sources than fossil fuel because they have higher added value and can be converted into compounds with different functional groups in their production.2 Furfural is an important natural precursor to furan-based chemicals, obtained by the catalyzed dehydration of sugars from xylose, extracted from hemicellulose, and has the potential to become a major renewable platform chemical for the production of biochemicals and biofuels.3,4 Furfural, as an oxygen-containing functional group compound, is inappropriate as a transportation fuel. So, the improvement of partial or total elimination of the oxygenated functionalities is requisite. Furfural can be converted, through catalytic hydrogenation, into a variety of products of concern, such as furfuryl alcohol\nducts, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Key ational Engineering Lab. for Biomass on Forest Chemical Engineering, SFA, -mail: liujunli1974@126.com ng and Utilization of Forest Resources, 7, China\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\n(FOL), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFOL), cyclopentanone (CPO)5 or cyclopentanol6 (CPL), which is the main hydrogenated products and widely applied for preparation of fungicides, fragrance chemicals.7\nHowever, selective hydrogenation of furfural is a great challenge because there are many different functionalities such as furan ring and C]O bands, which can participate in the reaction resulting in low yield to the desired product and increase the cost for its purication.8 So appropriate catalysis plays a central role in the reaction. The high selectivity of the catalyst depends on its supportedmetal and its carrier, and the ratio.9 In the past few years, various metals,10 both noble metals (Au, Ir, Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh) and non-noble metals (Ni, Co, Cu, Mo and Fe) have been studied and applied in the hydrogenation reaction of furfural.11\u201313 Though non-noble metals are of lower catalytic activity than noble metals, the research on non-noble catalysts is more valuable and necessary in conversion of FOL. For example, Zhou's group14 designed an efficient 30 wt% nickel-based catalyst with HNO3-pretreated carbon nanotube (x% Ni/CNT, x represents the Ni loading amount). They showed the conversion of furfural was up to 96.5% over 30 wt% Ni/CNT and obtained a yield of 83.6%. However, the experiment needed to be carried out under 5 MPa to achieve the above result. Later the same group designed a bimetallic catalyst to improve the experiment.15 CPL could also be obtained with a conversion of more than 99% and a yield of 96% with Ni1Co1/C under 2.0 MPa H2 pressure. Experiments have proved that under the same conditions, bimetal has higher conversion rate and selectivity than single metal. Another important part of the catalyst is the carrier. The carrier can not only act as a supporter but also\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 11843\u201311852 | 11843\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 1\n9 A\npr il\n20 22\n.

Activated carbon, which is obtained from renewable resources (cellulose, lignin), is a promising material as the catalyst carrier.16\u201318 Activated carbon can provide high specic surface area and wide pore size distribution. Moreover, its inertness, durability and easy recovery of metals are needed for the catalyst. Therefore, some studies on the hydrogenation reaction of furfural are carried out under activated carbon support. In a study by Maryam,19 activated carbon as a support was applied for a selective hydrogenation of furfural. They designed a catalyst from activated carbon, which combined all the advantages of both the activated carbon and a monolithic structure in one piece.\nAlthough a large number of studies20\u201323 have achieved a single specic product in the hydrogenation reaction of furfural on their modied catalyst, there are still a few experiments exploring greener catalysts to obtain more efficient conversion rates and higher yields. Therefore, in this work we designed a series of bimetal nickel (Ni) cobalt (Co) catalysts with lignin-based activated carbon as a carrier for furfural reaction to get a higher yield of the target product, named NixCoy/AC (x,y represent the Ni and Co loading amount). It is worth mentioning that the support in the catalyst comes from the previous work of the research group and is activated from biomass waste lignin. In order to compare the impact of the carrier on the performance of the catalyst, the carrier also used the biomass full-component raw material corncob and fossil resource coal. We explored the performance of single metals Ni, Co and bimetal in the reaction. Ni3Co1/AC catalysts, which exhibited a conversion of nearly 100%, were found to be an optimal catalyst for the aqueous selective hydrogenation of furfural to CPL. More signicantly, the catalyst still retained most of its quality and activity aer ve repeated cycles. At last, all of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, ICP, BET, TEM for theoretical analysis of experimental results."

In addition, the pattern of the catalyst with the increasing of the cobalt loading could be found to move a little to the le, this could be ascribed to the comparable structural features of nickel and cobalt, which had a number of peaks at around 44.22, 51.52 and 75.85 according to JCPDS card no. 15-0806. Through the analysis of XRD, it was proved that the metal nickel and cobalt were successfully supported on the catalyst.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to carry out surface analysis of the catalysts (Ni/ELAC, Ni3Co1/ELAC, Ni2Co1/ ELAC, Ni1Co1/ELAC) and characterize the nickel and cobalt oxidation state. The Ni0 2p spectrum exhibited two contributions, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 (resulting from the spin orbit splitting), located at respectively 870 eV and 852.4 eV (Fig. 2a\u2013d), which could be assigned to the presence of metallic nickel. The presence of the O 1s peak (Fig. 2e) and Ni2+ (Fig. 2e), which was evidenced by a shoulder observed on the main peak at 873.8 eV (Ni2+ 2p1/2) and 852.8 eV (Ni\n2+ 2p3/2), indicated that oxidation of the samples took place aer exposure to the atmosphere. Similarly, the XPS spectrums of Co 2p in catalysts (Fig. 3) exhibited four main peaks with binding energy at 778.45 eV, 782.7 eV, 793.66 eV and 798 eV corresponding to Co0 2p3/2, Co 2+ 2p3/2, Co 0 2p1/2 and Co\n2+ 2p1/2.

When comparing these samples, the shi to higher binding energy from Ni/ELAC to Ni1Co1/ELAC provided evidence of an interaction between the nickel, cobalt and support species.\nThe physicochemical properties of AC supported Ni/Cobased catalysts were listed in Table 1. Firstly, ICP analysis showed though the metal nickel and cobalt content was somewhat lost (theoretical content value 20%), the measured bimetal ratio was very close to the theoretical design value, indicating metal nickel and cobalt could be effectively attached to the surface of activated carbon and the porous material activated carbon was feasible and effective as a metal support. In addition, four different activated carbon supported catalysts (Table 1 row 2\u20135) had different specic surface areas and pore structures, which were determined by the carrier. Bimetallic nickel and cobalt catalyst exhibited better BET surface and pore volume comparing to the single metal nickel catalyst. With the increase of another metal cobalt, the bimetallic catalyst had larger specic surface area and smaller average pore size. Similar studies from Xu's group had also conrmed that the increase in cobalt content would reduce the average pore size.24,25 The results (Table 1 row 2, 6\u20138) proved that the catalyst with the addition of another metal cobalt would lead to the improved dispersibility, which nally caused the increase in specic surface area and decrease in average pore size.\n1/ELAC, (d) Ni1Co1/ELAC catalysts, (e) XPS patterns of Ni/ELAC catalyst.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As could be seen in Table 2, the main products aer reaction over any catalyst were FOL, CPO, CPL and THFOL. Others could be an intermediate and not presented. The experiment (Table 2 entry 1) was carried out without any catalyst and no product was obtained, demonstrating the reaction must be carried out under the action of a catalyst. When the carrier ELAC was added, the experiment (Table 2 entry 2) still hardly reacted, explaining that the carrier doesn't have much catalytic activity without metal addition. When metallic nickel was added to the carrier activated carbon, the hydrogenation reaction over Ni/ELAC catalyst attained an 78.1% conversion and 80.6% selectivity of CPL, which were higher than those (Table 2 entry 7) obtained with Ni/ CNT catalyst14 (68.3% and 42.8%, respectively), demonstrating that activated carbon was suitable as the carrier in the reaction of furfural hydrogenation. In order to study the effect of support on the catalytic reaction of furfural hydrogenation, four activated carbons (ELAC, ALAC, CCAC, XCAC) with different raw materials and same preparation methods were selected. The hydrogenation reaction over Ni/ELAC, Ni/ALAC, Ni/CCAC, Ni/ XCAC catalysts (Table 2 entry 3\u20136) attained conversions of 78.1%, 69.4%, 44.2%, 34.1% and CPL selectivity of 80.6, 74.7, 45.5, 40.1%, respectively. This result may be related to different surface area and pore structure of activated carbon. A larger specic surface area was more benecial to metallic nickel adhesion on the carrier and the progress of the reaction.27,28 It\nTable 2 Hydrogenation of furfural over various catalystsa\nEntry Catalyst FFA con.

By analyzing experimental results (Table 2 entry 3, 8, 10, 12) over Ni/ELAC, Ni3Co1/ELAC, Ni2Co1/ELAC, Ni1Co1/ELAC catalysts, we could nd that bimetal supported catalysts could achieve higher conversion and selectivity, ranking Ni3Co1/ELAC > Ni2Co1/ELAC > Ni1Co1/ELAC > Ni/ELAC. We chose another carrier (ALAC) for experiment (Table 2 entry 4, 9, 11, 13) and got the same conclusion. This might be due to the fact that bimetallic ions could more fully utilize the pore structure of the support for catalytic reactions.26\nBy choosing the catalyst carrier and metal loading ratio optimization, Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst was the most suitable catalyst among all selected catalysts in the furfural hydrogenation reaction for conversion of nearly 100% and CPL selectivity of 94.1%. In summary, Ni3Co1/ELAC was selected for follow-up research.\n3.2.2 Effect of reaction time, H2 pressure and temperature over Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst. In this part, the parameters of furfural hydrogenation in the aqueous over Ni3Co1/ELAC, including the reaction temperature, initial H2 pressure, and the reaction time, were explored and the results were presented in\nFig. 5 Effects of reaction temperature over Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst in furfural hydrogenation (initial H2 pressure: 1 MPa; reaction time: 2 h).\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The conversion of furfural exhibited a similar trend when the temperature increased comparing with the Zhou's studies,31 which is carried out over CuxZny/CNT catalyst. On the other hand, it was surprising to nd that, when product distribution was noticed, at different temperatures, the main products turned out to be CPL (at least 90% yield), showing Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst excellent selectivity in the hydrogenation of furfural. And the temperature increase improved the yield of CPL and decreased the yield of CPO, FOL. Considering the higher conversion and lower reaction temperature, 140 C was regarded as the optimal result.\nAs is known to us, the reaction temperature, the initial H2 pressure and the reaction time are extremely important factors for the hydrogenation of furfural.32,33 Herein, the effect of reaction time over Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst in reaction temperature of 140 C and initial H2 pressure of 1 MPa was also investigated in Fig. 6. We conducted the reaction time of furfural hydrogenation from 0.5 h to 2.5 h, the results turned out to be an upward trend from 43% to 100% in the conversion of furfural. However, when the reaction time was less than 1 h or the reaction time was more than 1.5 h, the furfural conversion increased slowly and the change was not obvious. Larger furfural conversion occurred when the reaction time increased from 1 h to 1.5 h because the conversion of furfural to CPL contained several steps, enough time was necessary to perform this selective reaction furfural to CPL. When the reaction time extended to 2 h, nearly 100% conversion was obtained. So 2 h was the nal optimal reaction time aer the inspection.\nThe inuence of initial H2 pressure was also studied at a range of 0 MPa to 2 MPa over Ni3Co1/ELAC in reaction temperature of 140 C and the reaction time of 2 h, which was obviously lower compared with previous studies.31 It could be clearly observed in Fig. 7 that no reaction occurred while no hydrogen was added in the system. The conversion of furfural\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nand the yield of CPL signicantly increased from 55% to nearly 100% and from 91% to 94%, respectively, with the increase of the initial H2 pressure from 0.5 MPa to 1 MPa, revealing that appropriate hydrogen was benecial to the selective conversion of furfural to CPL in the aqueous. As the initial H2 pressure improved from 1 MPa to 2 MPa, there was almost no change in conversion and the yield of CPL. In compared with previous studies,34\u201336 we also discovered that extra hydrogen might lead to the decrease of main product (CPL) and the increase of derivates (THFOL). Through the consideration and analysis of three important variable factors (reaction temperature, reaction time, initial H2 pressure), we had obtained the optimal conditions (reaction temperature: 140 C, reaction time: 2 h, initial H2 pressure: 1 MPa) in furfural hydrogenation over Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst."

The experiments were carried out at the reaction time of 2 h, the reaction temperature of 140 C and the initial H2 pressure of 1MPa using Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst as optimum catalyst. Compared with furfural, 2-acetylfuran, which was only added a methyl group in the carbonyl carbon position, obtained the product (2-methyl cyclopentanone), also correspondingly a methyl group at the same position as shown in Table 3 entry 2. The difference was that the yield had declined to 92%.

The intermediates were not easy to capture due to the rapid reaction, so we performed an experiment at low rate, which was carried out at 80 C for 30 min.40 In addition to the substances that appeared in the previous reaction with a low conversion, we also detected 2-cyclopentenozane, showing that they are in an unstable state in reaction. Based on previous reports and some detected intermediates, the proposed mechanism of the hydrogenation of furfural over Ni3Co1/ELAC was presented in Scheme 2. FOL might be the rst to be formed by the reaction as hydrogen atoms attacked the carbonyl group on the surface of furfural, which happened quickly and continued to happened other different reactions, resulting in the little yield of FOL. This step was affected by many factors such as temperature, H2 pressure, time, and catalysts by Fig. 6\u20138. THFOL could be generated by all the double bonds on the FOL ring with hydrogen11 (Scheme 2 blue arrow). However, another reaction path (Scheme 2 red arrow), water molecules participated in, would eventually generate CPL by the rearrangement of the ring. FOL removed hydroxide ions under the action of Lewis acid, and molecular rearrangement reaction occurred under the attack of water molecules to form 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone. Then CPL was generated under the action of hydrogen.

In order to verify this conclusion, we tried to choose different solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, water) for the reaction. During the data collection (Table 4), when methanol, ethanol, isopropanol acted as a solvent in the reaction, almost no CPL was obtained and the dominate product was THFOL. The results proved that the production of CPL required the rearrangement reaction and the participation of water molecules.\nFrom the perspective of economy and environmental protection, it was necessary to test the cycle activity of the Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst in the furfural hydrogenation. Aer each reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, followed by washing with ethanol for several times and drying for the next reaction. The results were shown in Fig. 8. In the rst three cycles of the reaction, the conversion rate of furfural and the selectivity of CPL remained almost the same as the previous two reactions. Aer recycling ve times, the conversion rate of furfural and the selectivity of CPL decreased by 11% (from 100% to 89%) and 5.8% (from 94.1% to 88.3%), respectively. The Ni3Co1/ELAC catalyst in this paper showed good stability during the reactions, which was likely attributable to strong interactions between the support activated carbon and the metal composition nickel and cobalt."

So, activated carbon with suitable pore size for the loading of Ni\u2013Co catalyst was prepared by use of enzymatic lignin as raw material and phosphoric acid activation. Bimetal ratio and reaction conditions (reaction temperature, reaction time, initial H2 pressure) are important factors that affect experimental results in the furfural hydrogenation.
