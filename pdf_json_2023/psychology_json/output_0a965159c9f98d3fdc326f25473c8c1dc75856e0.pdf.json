Diatoms, a key phytoplankton functional group that account for 40% of the biological pump of CO2,8,9 are susceptible to climate change: as climate change causes more nutrient-depleted conditions in the surface ocean, small phytoplankton are predicted to become favoured at the expense of the larger diatoms.10 Emiliania huxleyi (E. huxleyi) is a coccolithophorid and is considered the most important calcifying species in terms of biomass and carbon sequestration. But increasing atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidication is reported to have adversely affected calcifying species including E. huxleyi.11\nAs phytoplankton variability is a key driver of biogeochemical variability, oceanographers have urged that improving understanding of the variability of phytoplankton is important to forecast the extent of global climate change.12\nMonitoring plankton to count, identify and classify them throughout the ocean both at depth and in different locations present an as yet unmet challenge of major urgency. Satellite imaging and imaging ow cytometry are two common methods to monitor phytoplankton with different levels of granularity. While satellite imaging covers at the global scale at high frequencies (daily), it can be obstructed by cloud and ice covers, and in any case, it cannot capture the abundance and diversity of sub-surface of phytoplankton populations.13 Selecting proper\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The proof-ofconcept study by some of the present authors have successfully classied 6 phytoplankton species based on their susceptibility level.16 More importantly, it has been reported that although different life-stages coexisted within the population of a species of marine green algae, Chlamydomonas concordia, the size-\nFig. 1 Schematic illustration of the workflow of fluoro-electrochemical fluorescence transients captured and analysed by a neural network (c) to of test sample.

The scheme of this method is shown in Fig. 1. To show the superiority of this method, it was benchmarked with the more intuitive method of neural network classication with their images.20,21 Additional benchmarking based on the size and half-life using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) method was also performed. Because it was not practical to collect data to train a neural network with every existing species, the neural network tested against unseen species. Thus, it was trained to identify E. huxleyi from other species and tested with unseen E. huxleyi strains and species unseen during training to evidence the neural network's generalization, rather than memorization, of the transients.

As mentioned in the introduction, the species (including E. huxleyi) and groups (including diatoms) are of great interests to oceanographers and full details of the dataset were tabulated in the ESI.\u2020 The images were recorded in grey scale, cropped to locate the phytoplankton and then resized to 80 pixels with equal width and height.

Since the transients were recorded every 0.1 seconds, each transients had 190 datapoints. Fig. 2 and 3 illustrates images and transients of the 29 strains randomly drawn from the dataset. As shown in Fig. 2, even a very experienced oceanographer may nd it challenging to classify them based on their shape and morphology. While it may be possible to manually classify phytoplankton using the transients when the number of species is small, such task will become increasingly unpractical with increasing numbers of species under consideration. Thus, we propose classifying phytoplankton using articial intelligence.\nDeep learning with phytoplankton images\nTo classify phytoplankton images (Fig. 2) without use of the uorescence data, we employed transfer learning by ne-tuning the pre-trained ResNet50V2 network to ensure a fair comparison with other methods,22 as transfer learning was considered state-of-the-art by very recent literature for plankton classication because of its signicantly higher accuracy than traditional methods.23 ResNet50V2 was trained for 10 epochs for the new output layer followed by ne tuning (learning rate= 10\u22125) for 50 epochs for the whole model. The model was then evaluated by classifying phytoplankton images to their taxonomic orders on the testing dataset, achieving an accuracy of 86.5%. The confusion matrix of the testing dataset is shown in Fig. 5a. The high but far from perfect accuracy using transfer learning method showed that deep learning with phytoplankton images might only capture their visual differences but failed to understand the underlying physiochemical properties to differentiate between species very similar in appearance. The training history shown in ESI\u2020 showed that ResNet50V2 achieved a training accuracy >99% aer 30 epochs of ne tuning, but the validation accuracy always stumbled around 84%, suggesting that\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\na complex neural networks like ResNet50V2, were prone to risks of overtting.\nKNN classication with phytoplankton half-lives and sizes\nA second method for classication used K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) using merely two data points: uorescence half-life (t1/2) data along with the plankton radii (r), where t1/2 was the time point when uorescence intensity of phytoplankton dropped to 50% of its initial value before applying any oxidizing potential.24 Fig. 5b plots 500 phytoplankton data randomly drawn from the dataset and grouped by their taxonomic orders illustrated by scatter colours. The scatter plot clearly showed some degree of clustering by these two parameters, hinted that an unknown phytoplankton can be classied by the taxonomies of its closest neighbours in the two-dimensional t1/2 and r domains, which was the principle behind KNN classications. In KNN classication, the number of neighbours to consider was a hyperparameter and determined to be 7 using a grid search and vefold cross validation (GridSearchCV) method described in ESI.\u2020\nUsing the best hyperparameters provided by GridSearchCV, a KNN classier, trained with the training dataset, achieved a training accuracy of 89.0%. The accuracy of testing dataset using KNN classier was 87.5% and the confusion matrix was shown in Fig. 5c. Using a relatively simple algorithm with only two features, the KNN classier achieved higher accuracy than transfer learning with a very complex pretrained neural network. The small triumph of the KNN classier relative to ResNet50V2 was not the triumph of the algorithm, but likely the triumph from the half-life data providing physiochemical insights. For example, phytoplankton with silica or calcite shells were possibly more resilient in an oxidizing environment, and so exhibited a longer half-life. In other words, uoroelectrochemical microscopy provided critical physiochemical\nChem.

The radii of phytoplankton were an auxiliary input to allow fair comparison with other models. To adapt the one-dimensional uorescence time-series and the size data, we designed a simple neural network called \u201c1D Inception\u201d with two Inception blocks25 followed by three fully connected layers.

The network was trained with the uorescence transients such as those shown in Fig. 3 and the radii were added to the new network at a later stage of forward propagation. Aer 300 epochs of training, the network using uorescence transients achieved an accuracy of 95.4%, a signicant improvement from \u223c85% than just using images or features extracted from the transients. More importantly, 1D Inception is signicantly more accurate at classifying isochrysidales and naviculales as evidenced by the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 5d. Outperformance of the 1D Inception model was partly due to its efficient design (\u223c15 million trainable parameters compared with \u223c25 million trainable parameters in ResNet50V2), but more importantly due to the extra physiochemical information provided by the uoroelectrochemical microscopy. Using 1D Inception, the characterization power of the microscopy could be fully unleashed, transforming the proof-of-concept microscopy reported before16 to a highly accurate tool for oceanographers and allowing scientists independent phytoplankton classication into taxonomic orders.\nIdentifying E. huxleyi in the presence of potential interference from previously unseen species\nThe abundance of ecological diversity of phytoplankton precludes the possibility of building a comprehensive database containing every species of identied phytoplankton. Thus, the\nAI facilitated phytoplankton classication must be robust when interfered by unseen species and which have not been used for training. To evaluate the applicability of AI facilitated uoroelectrochemical microscopy, we designed two testing scenarios as described next: both involved identifying unseen E. huxleyi strain from two sets of unseen potentially interfering species. Recalling the importance of E. huxleyi for carbon sequestration,8,9 these scenarios emulated in situ investigations of E. huxleyi abundance in real oceanographical environmental measurements. The unseen interference species names, ecological groups and ID numbers for references in Fig. 2 for the rst scenarios were Phaeodactylum tricornutum (diatom, ID = 1), Minidiscus variabilis (diatom, ID = 25) and Scripsiella trochoidea (dinoagellates, ID = 27). The second scenario was more challenging: the unseen interference species was Gephyrocapsa oceanica (ID = 18), a species very similar to E. huxleyi as they were both calcifying isochrysidales. The unseen E. huxleyi strain withheld for both scenarios was the 8th strain shown in Fig. 2. The rest of the 29 strains were reserved for training the 1D Inception for binary classication of E. huxleyi. Aer 20 epochs of training, the 1D Inception network was ready to classify unseen strains. The accuracy and F1 score were 97.3% and 96.7% for scenario 1 and 94.1% and 95.3% for scenario 2 and the confusion matrices are shown in Fig. 6. These two scenarios proved the applicability of AI facilitated E. huxleyi quantication in oceanic environment by testing it with\nand their corresponding dataset.

Table 1 summarizes the machine learning model and dataset used, and from which, a 1D Inception neural network classication of uoro-electrochemical transients achieved the highest accuracy with a reasonable training time and the discriminating power may be further enhanced considering additional features including the circularity or otherwise phytoplankton cells. In addition, this method mostly correctly identied unseen E. huxleyi strains from unseen interference species, which proved that the neural network generalized the transients instead of memorizing them. The synergy of 1D Inception neural network with uoroelectrochemical microscopy enabled systematic interpretation of experimental results and highly granular classication of phytoplankton. We expect this method to revolutionize the eld of phytoplankton classication in the natural environment to enhance understanding of phytoplankton distribution and growth under future climate change and may enhance the possibility of the early prediction of algal bloom."
