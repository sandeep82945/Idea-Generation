Locally (i.e. z \u223c 0), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as obtained large statistical samples of pre-coalescence galaxy airs with projected separations of 30 \u221280 kpc and radial velocity ifferences of 200 \u2212500 km s \u22121 (Ellison et al. 2008 ; Patton et al. 2011 , 013 ; Scudder et al. 2012 , 2015 ). Compared to isolated galaxies at xed stellar mass, these systems are identified as having gas-phase etallicity depressed by \u223c0.02 \u22120.05 dex and star formation rate SFR) enhanced by \u223c 60 per cent out to 30 kpc separation (Scudder\n4406 J.

Merging systems at z > 1 are identified through a variety f methods including photometric pairs (e.g. Williams, Quadri & ranx 2011 ; Man et al. 2012 ; Man, Zirm & Toft 2016 ; Mantha et al. 018 ), spectroscopic features (e.g. Tasca et al. 2014 ; Ventou et al. 017 ; Dai et al. 2021 ), and visible morphological features such as idal tails and double nuclei (e.g. Lofthouse et al. 2017 ; Kartaltepe t al. 2015 ).\nRest-optical spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of key galaxy roperties such as SFR and metallicity, which register the effects f merging interactions. In the last decade, the commissioning of ultiobject near-IR spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes as enabled us to obtain large samples of high S/N rest-optical mission-line spectra for galaxies at z \u223c 1.5 \u22123.5. Utilizing the ultiObject Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE; cLean et al. 2012 ) instrument on the 10 m Keck I telescope, the OSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) surv e y (Kriek et al. 015 ) has observed \u223c1500 galaxies at 1.4 \u2264 z \u2264 3.8 (roughly alf of which are at z \u223c 2). Previous MOSDEF studies have dentified high-redshift mergers using multiple methods. Horstman t al. ( 2021 ) identified 55 mergers at z \u223c 2 using the Cosmic ssembly Near-infrared Dark Energy Le gac y Surv e y (CANDELS) orphology catalogue (Kartaltepe et al. 2015 ), and Wilson et al. 2019 ) spectroscopically identified 30 galaxy pairs at 1.5 z 3.5. In this study, we present a merger at z = 1.89 between the alaxies GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683, where galaxy IDs re drawn from the 3D- HST survey catalogues of Skelton et al. 2014 ). GOODS-S 43114 was targeted by the MOSDEF team, nd high-quality J -, H -, and K s -band Keck/MOSFIRE spectra were btained. GOODS-S 43683 was not an MOSDEF target; ho we ver, t was serendipitously captured in the MOSFIRE slit given the mask osition angle. This merger pair has been previously identified by van okkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) and is in the CANDELS morphology atalogue (Kartaltepe et al. 2015 ), though it has not been highlighted n previous MOSDEF merger analyses (e.g. Wilson et al. 2019 ; orstman et al. 2021 ). van Dokkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) analyse the ST images and low-resolution WFC3 grism spectra of the merger air, and, in addition, report that both galaxies contain an active alactic nucleus (AGN) based on X-ray luminosity data from Luo t al. ( 2008 ).\nThe goal of this study is to build on the earlier work of van okkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) by analysing the spectroscopic and hostalaxy properties of both galaxies using Keck/MOSFIRE spectra nd emission-line corrected SED fitting and comparing with statef-the-art galaxy merger simulations. Specifically, we aim to better nderstand the galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) and stellar opulation properties and the evolutionary stage of the merger, by tting the H \u03b4 absorption feature following the methodology from ick et al. ( 2018 ) and using it to estimate the second velocity oment and dynamical mass of the system. Our analysis is enhanced elative to previous work on this merger pair based on both the nclusion of higher resolution rest-optical spectroscopy enabling a ynamical analysis of GOODS-S 43114, and also more systematic ED modelling of both members of the galaxy pair that folds in an-chromatic observations extending through the mid- and far-IR. ection 2 provides an overview of the MOSDEF surv e y and presents he observations, the SED fitting methodology, and derived galaxy roperties. Section 3 presents the results, while Section 4 provides discussion of the key results in the context of current work with alaxy merger simulations. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the key esults from this study.\nAll emission-line wavelengths are given in the vacuum frame. hroughout this paper, we adopt a -CDM cosmology with H 0\nNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\n70 km s \u22121 Mpc \u22121 , m = 0.3, and = 0.7. Also, we assume he solar abundance pattern from Asplund et al.

MOSDEF galaxies ere selected from five well-studied CANDELS and 3D- HST le gac y elds (Grogin et al. 2011 ; Koekemoer et al. 2011 ; Momche v a et al. 016 ) \u2212 AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and UDS \u2212 and ere targeted in three distinct redshift ranges: 1.37 \u2264 z \u2264 1.70, 2.09 z \u2264 2.61, and 2.95 \u2264 z \u2264 3.80. These redshift bins were selected o optimise the detection of strong rest-optical emission-lines (e.g. O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3727,3730, H \u03b2, [O III ] \u03bb\u03bb4960,5008, H \u03b1, [N II ] \u03bb6585, and S II ] \u03bb\u03bb6718,6733) within windows of atmospheric transmission.\noderate spectral resolution ( R = 3000\u20133650) was obtained, and he surv e y is H -band (rest-optical) magnitude-limited ( H AB = 24.0, 4.5, and 25.0, respectively, in the low-, middle-, and high-redshift ins of the MOSDEF sample). We use an ABA \u2018B\u2019 ( + 1.5, 1.2, 1.2, \u221215 arcsec) dither pattern to account for detector defects, sky ariations, and increase the S/N of the final spectra (Kriek et al. 008 ). For additional MOSDEF observing details, see Kriek et al. 2015 ).\n.2 GOODS-S 43114 AND GOODS-S 43683 obser v ations\nOODS-S 43114 was targeted for MOSDEF spectroscopic observaions based on a catalogued spectrosopic redshift of z = 2.6087 from alestra et al. ( 2010 ). In fact, this catalogued spectroscopic redshift s inconsistent with both the photometric redshift of z = 1.9135 isted in the 3D- HST catalogue (see also Schawinski et al. 2011 ), nd the grism spectroscopic redshift presented in van Dokkum & rammer ( 2010 ), the latter of which we were unaware of at the ime of observation. The 3D- HST photometric redshift in fact places OODS-S 43114 outside all of the nominal MOSDEF target ranges. o we ver, within the MOSDEF targeting process, existing spectrocopic redshifts were given priority in the event that a discrepancy rose between spectroscopic and photometric redshift. Using the rroneous spectroscopic redshift for GOODS-S 43114 led to the ortuitous observation of the unique spectra described here.\nGOODS-S 43114 was observed across two nights: 2016 January and 2. The integration time was 2 h in each of the J , H , and s bands with seeing of 0.67, 0.86, and 0.65 arcsec, respectively. he spectroscopic redshift derived from our MOSFIRE observations\ns z = 1.8869, which is consistent with the photometric redshift n the 3D- HST catalogue (1.9135 \u00b1 0.0395), and slightly lower han the redshift presented in van Dokkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) 1.902 \u00b1 0.002). At this redshift, nebular emission lines such as O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3727,3730, H \u03b2, [O III ] \u03bb\u03bb4960,5008, H \u03b1, [N II ] \u03bb6585, and S II ] \u03bb\u03bb6718,6733 fall outside of the J , H , and K s bands. Ho we ver, e did observe the H \u03b3 and H \u03b4 Balmer absorption lines in the band, from which we derived a spectroscopic redshift for GOODS43114. The J -band MOSFIRE spectrum of GOODS-S 43114 is hown in Fig. 1 . No discernible emission- or absorption-line features ere captured in the H or K s -bands. For the observation of this erger pair, the MOSFIRE slit width was 0.7 arcsec (5.89 kpc at = 1.89) and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the rofile used for optimal extraction was 1.1 arcsec (9.26 kpc at = 1.89).\nz = 1.89 merger 4407\nFigure 2.

We measure that the centroids of the two galaxies re 2.135 arcsec (18 kpc) apart, which agrees with van Dokkum & rammer ( 2010 ). As previously stated, GOODS-S 43683 was not pecifically targeted as part of the MOSDEF surv e y; ho we ver, as ig. 2 shows, it was captured serendipitously in the MOSDEF slit ith GOODS-S 43114 given the slit position angle of \u221240 deg E f N. Unfortunately, due to the adopted ABA\u2019B\u2019 dither pattern and ur method of using dithered exposures for sky subtraction (Kriek t al. 2015 ), we cannot detect the spectrum of GOODS-S 43683. pecifically, at a separation of 2.135 arcsec, the positive continuum of\nOODS-S 43683 o v erlaps with the ne gativ e sk y-subtraction residual f GOODS-S 43114 offset towards the top of the slit. GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 have been identified as a erger pair in van Dokkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) and the CANDELS orphology catalogue (Kartaltepe et al. 2015 ). The latter classifies ergers and other galaxy features based on the visual inspection. or GOODS-S 43114 (GOODS-S 43683), 100 per cent (66 per cent) f people classified it as having \u2018any interaction\u2019 while 66 per cent 100 per cent) claimed that tidal arms exist. GOODS-S 43114 is a lass 4 merger, while GOODS-S 43683 is a class 3 merger, both of hich are high confidence merger classifications. van Dokkum & rammer ( 2010 ) also report this galaxy pair as having merger eatures such as diffuse, tidally-induced spiral arms and tails. .3 SED fitting and deri v ed properties e use the SED-fitting code FAST 1 (Kriek et al. 2009 ) to obtain besttting SEDs and estimates of key galaxy properties for GOODS43114 and GOODS-S 43683. With FAST , we adopt the Flexible tellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) library from (Conroy & Gunn 010 ) and assume a Chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar initial mass function IMF), a Calzetti et al. ( 2000 ) dust attenuation curve, and delayed- \u03c4 FHs where SFR(SED) \u221d t \u00d7 e \u2212t/\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the characteristic star ormation time-scale and t is the time since the onset of star formation. e allow t , \u03c4 , the amount of interstellar extinction ( A V ), and stellar ass of the galaxy ( M \u2217) to vary within the models, while fixing the etallicity to 0.019 (defined to be solar metallicity in the Conroy & unn 2010 library). For the SED fitting, we fix GOODS-S 43114 nd GOODS-S 43683 redshifts to the MOSFIRE spectroscopic edshift obtained for GOODS-S 43114. Given that these galaxies re in a merger with the centroids being only \u223c18 kpc apart, this edshift assumption for GOODS-S 43683 seems reasonable. van okkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) validate our assumption, reporting z = .898 \u00b1 0.003 for GOODS-S 43683 (they report z = 1.902 \u00b1 0.002 or GOODS-S 43114). In addition, fitting the photometry with he code EAZY 2 (Brammer, van Dokkum & Coppi 2008 ) yields a\nMNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\n4408 J. N. Runco et al.\nM\nFigure 3.

Along with the best-fitting SED and n estimate of M \u2217, SFR(SED), A V , and t / \u03c4 , we estimate sSFR(SED) rom SFR(SED) and M \u2217. UVJ colours are measured from the besttting SED using the IRAF (Tody 1986 , 1993 ) routine sbands . We use broad-band photometry drawn from the 3D- HST v4.1 atalogues (Skelton et al. 2014 ) for both GOODS-S 43114 and OODS-S 43683. A full description of the method used for muliwavelength photometric measurements is provided in Skelton et al. 2014 ). For GOODS-S 43114, we fit a combination of the broadband hotometry and the J -band MOSFIRE spectra. Here, the MOSFIRE pectra are normalized to match the flux density corresponding to he photometric points in each band. Additionally, for the fitting, e ensure that the R = 3300 MOSFIRE J -band spectrum and FAST odels (with a native resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 in the rest frame, Johnson t al. 2021a ) are matched in spectral resolution. For GOODS-S 3 683, we only use the photometry in the fitting process because his target was not spectroscopically detected in the MOSFIRE bservations. The best-fitting SEDs and photometry are shown in Fig. 3 . or GOODS-S 43683, there is an offset between the photometry specifically IRAC channels 3 and 4) and best-fitting SED due to the ontribution of the AGN. As a sanity check, we refit the photometry ith FAST without IRAC channels 2, 3, and 4, and find no significant ifference in the estimated galaxy properties. Therefore, the presence f the AGN does not bias the SED fit. The portion of the best-fitting EDs that o v erlaps with the MOSDEF J -band spectrum is shown in ig. 1 . We estimate the 4000 \u00c5 break ( D n 4000) and the H \u03b4 absorptionine feature (H \u03b4A ), using the wavelength ranges from, respectively, orthey & Ottaviani ( 1997 ) and Balogh et al. ( 1999 ). D n 4000 traces he opacity of stellar atmospheres and increases with metallicity and ge. H \u03b4A peaks when A-type stars dominate the spectrum, which ccurs when a short burst of star formation is followed by rapid uenching. Therefore, the combination of these features can reveal nformation about the star formation time-scale and evolutionary hase of a galaxy, as H \u03b4A is sensitive to recently quenched star ormation while D n 4000 is sensitive to age. We utilize the best-fitting\nNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\nAST models to measure both quantities for both GOODS-S 43114 nd GOODS-S 43683. For GOODS-S 43114, it is also possible to stimate H \u03b4A from the spectra; ho we ver, part of the D n 4000 feature s bluewards of the J -band spectrum, so we do not use the spectrum o estimate that quantity. The measurement of H \u03b4A from the model i.e. 7.81 \u00c5) is consistent at the 1 \u2212 2 \u03c3 level with that estimated rom direct integration of the J -band spectrum itself (H \u03b4A, spectrum 8.42 0 . 56 0 . 56 \u00c5). We adopt morphological properties and uncertainties from the 160W catalogue of van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ), in particular the alf-light radius ( R e ), the S \u0301ersic index ( n ), the axial ratio ( q ), and he luminosity estimated from the S \u0301ersic fit ( L Ser ). van der Wel t al. ( 2014 ) used a single-component S \u0301ersic profile fit to the twoimensional light distribution of the F160W band to estimate these roperties. The associated methodology for estimating the associated ncertainties on morphological properties is described in detail in van er Wel et al. ( 2012 ).\nWe used the Penalized Pixel-Fitting routine ( PPXF 3 ; Cappellari & msellem 2004 ; Cappellari 2017 ) to estimate the second moment of\nhe line-of-sight velocity distribution within the half-light radius ( \u03c3 e ) or GOODS-S 43114. We fit the MOSFIRE J -band spectrum using he Vazdekis et al. ( 2010 ) stellar population library . Specifically , e used a subset of 150 single stellar population template spectra ith 25 stellar population ages logarithmically spaced between 0.063 nd 15.8 Gyr and six metallicities, [M/H] = ( \u22121.71, \u22121.31, \u22120.71, 0.40, 0.00, and 0.22). In the fit, we used additive polynomials of egree four. Since the MOSFIRE spectrum is higher resolution than he stellar templates, we corrected the fitted second velocity moment pwards by the quadratic differences of the two resolutions using the ollowing equation:\n2 e = \u03c3 2 obs + \u03c3 2 instr temp \u2212 \u03c3 2 instr gal , (1) here \u03c3 2 instr temp and \u03c3 2 instr gal are the instrumental dispersions of the\nemplates and MOSFIRE spectrum, respectively, \u03c3 2 obs is the observed econd moment, and \u03c3 2 e is the second velocity moment corrected for he difference in template and spectrum resolutions. Note that both he H \u03b3 and H \u03b4 lines are included in the fit. Tanaka et al. ( 2019 ) how that the choice of stellar population library and whether or ot to mask the Balmer absorption lines does not bias the estimated econd velocity moment. We computed bootstrap uncertainties on 2 e by perturbing the MOSFIRE J -band spectrum within its error pectrum and randomly changing the polynomial degree for the fit etween 1 and 5.\nThe second velocity moment, \u03c3 2 e , is used to estimate the dynamical ass ( M dyn ) using the following methodology. First, we estimated\nhe virial M / L ratio using the following equation:\nM/L ) vir = \u03b2( n ) \u00d7 R e \u00d7 \u03c3 2 e\nL Ser \u00d7 G , (2)\nhere G is the gravitational constant and, as described abo v e, the emaining variables and uncertainties are adopted from the van er Wel et al. ( 2014 ) catalogue (i.e. R e , n , and L Ser ). We adopted quation (20) from Cappellari et al. ( 2006 ) to estimate the virial oefficient ( \u03b2( n )) using the S \u0301ersic index. We used this M / L vir ratio to stimate M dyn according to the following equation:\ndyn = ( M/L ) vir \u00d7 L FAST , (3) here L FAST is the F160W luminosity from the best-fitting FAST\nz = 1.89 merger 4409 2\nI S a 2 m c h m o 3\n3\n3\nT T M p M 5 o D fi ( d\n\u03c3 s u o d a a\np g a f u f g t v t K u v\na H 4 a ( S m t\n4\n\u2018 b H g s m\na p d t 4 S a\ni l ( g i d U Y ( w t i T l E\ng b ( w 4 i b s c ( \u00c5\nv Z U t t l a I S\nw d i t t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/3/4405/6754327 by Technical Inform ation C enter D enm ark - D TU user on 06 D ecem ber 2022\n.4 SDSS comparison sample\nn Section 3 , we compare the D n 4000 and H \u03b4A values of GOODS43114 and GOODS-S 43683 with those of local galaxies using rchi v al data from SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7; Abazajian et al. 009 ), specifically from the MPA-JHU DR7 release of spectrum easurements. 4 We use the H \u03b4A and D n 4000 values from the atalogue where the measured continuum indices in the spectra ave been corrected for sky-line contamination using the best-fitting odel spectrum. We restrict the SDSS sample to a redshift range f 0.04 \u2264 z \u2264 0.10. These criteria give us a final local sample of 05 005 galaxies.\nRESULTS\n.1 Galaxy stellar populations\nhe galaxy properties discussed in Section 2.3 are shown in Table 1 . he reported 1 \u03c3 uncertainties for best-fitting galaxy properties [i.e. \u2217, SFR(SED), sSFR(SED), \u03c4 , t / \u03c4 , and A V ] are estimated from erturbing the photometry and each wavelength element of the OSFIRE J -band spectrum within their uncertainties and refitting 00 times. The same procedure was adopted to estimate uncertainties n properties obtained from the best-fitting SED (i.e. UVJ colours, n 4000, and H \u03b4A ). Specifically, for each random iteration, the besttting SEDs from the perturbed data are re-fit, and 1 \u03c3 uncertainties 16th and 84th percentiles) for the parameters are estimated from the istributions of the fitted, perturbed quantities. As discussed in Section 2.3 , we obtain bootstrap uncertainties on e by perturbing the MOSFIRE J -band spectrum within its error pectrum and randomly changing the polynomial degree of fit. The ncertainty on M dyn was estimated by propagating the uncertainties n \u03c3 e , R e , n , and L Ser through equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ). Finally, the eri v ation of the uncertainties for the morphological properties dopted from the van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) catalogue (i.e. R e , n , nd q ) is described in van der Wel et al. ( 2012 ).\nNote that many of the reported uncertainties are very small for roperties estimated from the SED fitting, which results from both alaxies having both a very high number (39) of photometry points nd small photometric error bars. In cases where we formally ound zero uncertainty, we report upper limit in the magnitude of ncertainties based on either the smallest detected finite uncertainty or GOODS-S 43683 (e.g. U \u2212 V and V \u2212 J ) or the parameter rid spacing (e.g. A V and \u03c4 ). Ho we ver, it is essential to note that he quoted errors do not reflect systematic uncertainties due to arious assumptions inherent to SED fitting models (e.g. stellar IMF, reatment of late stages of stellar evolution, dust attenuation curve; riek et al. 2016 ). Muzzin et al. ( 2009 ) report that these systematic ncertainties are typically a few tenths of a dex, but the exact estimate aries for each measured property (e.g. M \u2217, t , etc.).\nGOODS-S 43114 is found to be more massive and less dusty with slightly older stellar population, lower SFR(SED), sSFR(SED), \u03b4A , larger D n 4000, and bluer UVJ colours compared to GOODS-S 3683. Note that the observed difference in sSFR(SED) can be mostly ttributed to the difference in M \u2217. According to standard classification e.g. Cox et al. 2008 ), the close stellar mass ratio between GOODS43114 and GOODS-S 43683 implies that this system is a \u2018major erger.\u2019 We note that van Dokkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) described he merger between GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 as a\nhttps:// wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/ DR7/\nt\n5\nminor merger,\u2019 based on an approximate comparison of H -band rightnesses. Ho we ver, based on both our updated comparison of -band brightnesses and stellar masses from actual SED fits to both alaxies (indeed, van Dokkum & Brammer 2010 only modelled the tellar population of GOODS-S 43114), we find a significantly closer ass ratio between the two galaxies. Recall from Section 2.3 that we fit a combination of the photometry nd MOSFIRE spectra of GOODS-S 43114, while we only fit the hotometry of GOODS-S 43683. The values presented in Table 1 o not change significantly if we fit GOODS-S 43114 using only he photometry, applying the same methodology as for GOODS-S 3683. In addition, the conclusions we derive from these results (see ection 4 ) are not dependent on whether we fit both the photometry nd MOSFIRE spectra of GOODS-S 43114, or the photometry alone.\nBased on rest-frame UVJ colours, Zick et al. ( 2018 ) group galaxies nto five bins: quiescent (i), post-starburst (ii), dusty galaxies with ower sSFRs (iii), dusty star forming (iv), and non-dusty star forming v). These bins were created based on known correlations between alaxy properties and UVJ colours. For star-forming galaxies, A V ncreases linearly with increasing U \u2212 V and V \u2212 J . sSFR(SED) ecreases along a direction perpendicular to this A V sequence [i.e. \u2212 V increases and V \u2212 J decreases as sSFR(SED) decreases; e.g. ano et al. 2016 ]. These relationships moti v ate the creation of bins iii), (iv), and (v). Once a galaxy has stopped forming stars its colours ill e volve to wards the quiescent box. As galaxies age away from heir star-forming epochs, they move along the quiescent sequence n the UVJ diagram (i.e. increasing in U \u2212 V and V \u2212 J colour). herefore, bins (i) and (ii) comprise an age gradient for galaxies no onger forming stars (e.g. Whitaker et al. 2012 ; Belli, Newman & llis 2019 ). The left-hand panel of Fig. 4 gives the UVJ diagram with these alaxy bins from Zick et al. ( 2018 ) identified. The region occupied y quiescent galaxies following the definition from Williams et al. 2009 ) is also included. It can be seen that GOODS-S 43114 falls ell within the post-starburst bin (i.e. bin (ii)), while GOODS-S 3683 falls at the intersection of bins (i), (ii), and (iii) \u2013 reflecting ts redder V \u2212 J colour. The SFR(SED) and sSFR(SED) values in oth galaxies indicate that these systems are not currently forming tars at a rapid rate relative to their past averages. In addition, the haracteristic shapes of the SEDs in the right-hand panel of Fig. 1 specifically, the steep decline in flux density bluewards of \u223c4000 ) suggests that both galaxies are in a post-starburst phase. Fig. 4 shows GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 on the H \u03b4A ersus D n 4000 diagram. Also included are the five data points from ick et al. ( 2018 ) representing stacks of galaxies in each of the five VJ bins, and tracks of SFH with \u03c4 = 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0 Gyr. To create hese tracks, we use the code PYTHON-FSPS 5 (Johnson et al. 2021a ) hat generates spectra for synthetic stellar populations using the FSPS ibrary (Conroy & Gunn 2010 ). For these models, we make similar ssumptions to those in our SED fitting (i.e. a Chabrier 2003 stellar MF, a Calzetti et al. 2000 dust attenuation curve, and delayed- \u03c4 FHs). We find that both GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 fall\nithin the uncertainties of bin (ii) on the H \u03b4A versus D n 4000 iagram. Based on the ele v ated H \u03b4A v alue found for both galaxies, it s likely that the spectra are dominated by A-type stars, which implies hat star formation shut down in a time frame where the O- and Bype stars no longer exist but the A-type stars still remain. In addition, he fact that the D n 4000 feature and t / \u03c4 ratio are very similar for both\nMNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\nht tps://dfm.io/pyt hon-fsps/current /\n4410 J. N.

( 2000 ) ust attenuation curve, and fix the metallicity to solar (0.019). We plit the non-parametric SFH into eight time bins, assume constant tar formation in each bin, and adopt a built-in continuity prior that eights against sharp variations in SFR between adjacent time bins see Tacchella et al. 2022 for discussion on how non-parametric odels are influenced by the choice in priors used). The first two ge bins are fixed at 0\u201330 Myr and 30\u2013100 Myr, with the remaining ins spaced logarithmically from 100 Myr to the age of the universe t z = 1.89. We include an additional prior placing an upper limit f 10 M yr \u22121 on the SFR in the earliest time bins ( z > 4) and also he time bin closest to the epoch of observation, for consistency with he strong Balmer absorption observed in the J -band spectrum of OODS-S 43114. While there are differences between the inferred SFHs using FAST nd PROSPECTOR in detail, in terms of the precise SFH shape and ookback time of peak star formation, we emphasize the qualitative imilarities here. Both the FAST delayed- \u03c4 and PROSPECTOR nonarametric SFHs suggest that the onsets and peaks of the most recent ursts of star formation in these two galaxies are synchronized to ithin a few hundred Myrs of each other. There is uncertainty etween the models on the exact timing of the onset and peak of he burst, as well as peak level of SFR; ho we ver, it is clear that the tar-forming events in these two galaxies are linked. We note that an Dokkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) model the multiwavelength SED nd rest-optical spectrum of GOODS-S 43114 using simple top-hat FHs, also finding that star formation recently ceased and must have een significantly higher in the past.

The dynamical mass estimate is approximately a factor of lower than the M \u2217 measurement, which raises concerns about the alidity the method used to derive the dynamical mass. We discuss he discrepancy between the mass estimates in Section 4.2 . Since e do not have MOSFIRE spectra of GOODS-S 43683, we cannot stimate \u03c3 e and subsequently M dyn for this galaxy.\nDI SCUSSI ON\n.1 State of the merger\nomparing observations to galaxy simulations is important for onnecting isolated snapshots of galaxies with the larger evolutionary icture. Numerical simulations help impro v e our understanding of he both the merger process and the significance of mergers to alaxy formation (e.g. Barnes & Hernquist 1991 , 1996 ; Di Matteo t al. 2007 ; Cox et al. 2008 ; Di Matteo et al. 2008 ; Moreno et al. 015 ; Blumenthal & Barnes 2018 ). State-of-the-art galaxy formation imulations have the resolution to capture feedback-regulated star ormation and multiphase structures within the interstellar medium ISM; e.g. FIRE -1 and FIRE -2; Hopkins, Quataert & Murray 2011 ; opkins et al. 2014 , 2018 ), and, therefore, how these galaxy proesses and components will respond to a merger ev ent. F or e xample, ecent merger modelling with FIRE -2 (Moreno et al. 2019 ) probes nhanced star formation and ISM gas content during the merger rocess. In this work, three key stages in a merger are identified: he first pericentric passage, the second pericentric passage, and oalescence. The time between the first and second pericentric assage is \u223c2\u20132.5 Gyr while the time between the second pericentric assage and coalescence is 0.5 Gyr. In addition, Moreno et al. 2019 ) suggest that SFR spikes at each of these three events with significant decrease in SFR during the large time gap between he pericentric passages. The SFR stays ele v ated in the short time etween second pericentric passage and coalescence.\nOne important caveat to note is that Moreno et al. ( 2019 ) simulated ergers for local galaxies.

( 2019 ) fiducial model are an order of magnitude ower than those of the galaxy pair in this study. Such differences (in ddition to the detailed orbital configurations of the simulated and bserved mergers) will likely result in different absolute timescales or the merger and the corresponding rise and fall in the SFRs f the merging galaxies. While the precise timescales between ericentric passages and the magnitude of the SFR spikes resulting rom these events may be different for the high-mass z \u223c 2 galaxy pair nvestigated in this study, we assume that the basic pattern of galaxies aving an ele v ation in SFR at each pericentric passage with a decrease n-between still applies (see also e.g. Cox et al. 2008 ; Hopkins et al. 008 ). Therefore, we only make a qualitative comparison with the oreno et al. ( 2019 ) fiducial model, focusing generally on the phase f the merging process in which GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 3683 are observed based on their galaxy properties and recent SFHs t the epoch of observation.\nFor the merger analysed here, the low SFR(SED) and sSFR(SED) alues of GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 compared to their ast averages indicate that these galaxies are not observed during ne of the merger phases corresponding to ele v ated star formation. dditionally, Fig. 5 indicates that both galaxies had much higher FRs in the past. The tidal tail features exhibited by both galaxies uggest that this system has undergone at least one pericentric assage. Due to the depressed SFR at the date of observation, it s likely that the merger is observed between the first and second ericentric passages. Furthermore, the SFHs shown in Fig. 5 show hat the recent burst of star formation began \u223c0.5\u20131 Gyr (depending n the model) before the data of observation, suggesting that the first ericentric passage occurred around that time. The ele v ated H \u03b4A v alues and SFHs sho wn in Fig. 5 for GOODS-S 3114 and GOODS-S 43683 suggest that both galaxies have recently hut off their star formation. The main sequence lifespan of O-, B-, nd A-type stars are \u223c0.01, \u223c0.1, and \u223c1 Gyr, respectively. A-type tars will dominate the stellar spectrum during their main sequence ifetime after the main sequence lifetimes of O- and B-type stars av e passed. F or both the FAST and PROSPECTOR models, the time ince peak star formation is longer than the O- and B-star lifetime, orresponding to a phase when the light from A stars will contribute ignificantly to the rest-frame optical spectrum.\nCombining all of the information gained from the SED fitting with nferences from the models indicates that these galaxies recently nderwent their first pericentric passage and are mo ving a way from ach other. Detailed velocity mapping would be needed to confirm his theory, and such data currently do not exist for this merger.\nAs discussed earlier in this section, it is difficult to make direct omparisons with simulated mergers as a variety of parameters can lter the timescales and ele v ation/depression of star formation. Aside rom galaxy mass and redshift, additional caveats are differences in ther merger parameters relative to the Moreno et al. ( 2019 ) fiducial odel. F or e xample, dif ferent orientations and le vels of gas content n the galaxies can affect the time between pericentric passages and he ele v ation in SFR. Fensch et al. ( 2017 ) show that mergers with 0 per cent gas fractions characteristic of z \u223c 0 galaxies undergo larger increase in SFR compared to mergers of more gas-rich 60 per cent gas fraction) systems characteristic of z \u223c 2 galaxies. long the same lines, Scudder et al. ( 2015 ) find an anticorrelation etween SFR enhancement during the merger and the initial gas raction. This dependence of SFR enhancement during the merger n gas content can be attributed to a correlation between ISM urbulence and central gas inflow during the merger. In the Fensch t al. ( 2017 ) models, both the local-analogue gas-poor mergers and z\n2-analogue gas-rich mergers display similar peak gas inflow rates\nNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\nhat fuel star formation. The difference in SFR enhancement between he two scenarios is therefore due to the fact that the z \u223c 2-analogue as-rich g alaxies begin the merging process with much higher gas eservoirs.\n.2 Implications of the apparent mass discrepancy\nhe large discrepancy between M \u2217 and M dyn for GOODS-S 43114, n particular with M dyn < M \u2217, raises concerns about the accuracy f these measurements. As stated in Section 2.3 , our methodology or estimating M \u2217 is robust. In Table 1 , we list the M \u2217 estimated rom the delayed- \u03c4 model. Note that we experimented with other arametric SFHs (constant, exponentially rising, and exponentially alling), as well as a PROSPECTOR non-parametric model, and find imilar M \u2217 to that inferred from the delayed- \u03c4 model (i.e. the choice f a different SFH does not resolve the tension between the inferred tellar and dynamical masses. The SED is fit assuming a realistic elayed- \u03c4 SFH and we use 39 photometry points to constrain the hape of the SED. Additionally, we not only find consistent results sing non-parametric modelling with the PROSPECTOR code, but also ur estimate of M \u2217 agrees within uncertainties with past studies (van okkum & Brammer 2010 ). Therefore, it is likely that the M dyn measurement is significantly nderestimated. There is a straightforward explanation for how such n underestimate can arise. The axial ratio of the galaxy obtained rom the best-fitting S \u0301ersic model is 0.865 \u00b1 0.004. In one plausible cenario, this large axial ratio would result if GOODS-S 43114 is roughly face-on disc. In such a geometry, the estimate of the econd velocity moment (and subsequent M dyn estimate) is biased o w relati ve to the true v alue.\nFor a more in-depth estimate of M dyn , we compute the dynamical ass of the galaxy by constructing a cylindrically aligned Jeans nisotropic Model (JAM cyl ; Cappellari 2008 ) of its S \u0301ersic approxmation. The advantage of this approach with respect to using a  \u0301ersic-dependent virial equation is that JAM allows one to explore he effect of inclination as well as modelling the effect of the PSF and he kinematics extraction aperture. We first approximated a S \u0301ersic rofile with the index n = 5.26 given by van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) ith 30 Gaussians using the Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) arametrization and the mge fit 1d procedure 7 of Cappellari ( 2002 ). hen we used the fitted MGE to compute the velocity second moment sing the jam axi proj procedure in the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling JAM) software package 8 of Cappellari ( 2008 ). We also included central black hole with a mass of 0.2 per cent of the total mass f the S \u0301ersic model. This value is half of the expected value in the ocal Universe (Kormendy & Ho 2013 ) and has minimal effect on he result. We adopted a unitary mass for the S \u0301ersic model, and ssumed both that mass follows light and a typical anisotropy \u03b2 = .2 (fig. 9 of Cappellari 2016 ) to compute the PSF-convolved JAM odel predictions for the line-of-sight velocity second moments 2 los , j on a dense grid of values co v ering the observed rectangular perture o v er which the MOSFIRE spectrum was e xtracted. The odel is placed at the angular-size distance ( D A ) for the adopted tandard cosmology. We then co-added these luminosity-weighted alues inside the aperture as v 2 los = j I j v 2 los , j / j I j , where I j is the SF-convolved galaxy surface brightness at the j th grid location.\nz = 1.89 merger 4413\np d t s l o r t i b\nM\nI b t\nw fl l o W t p a p u t a o t l d\nm g m m s M E m c\ne \u223c s 2 w t r\nG i p G A c o\n4\nU b f d P t a S a R S A 2 f f m s d F c s c f\nd o a S t t c o W a d u I ( S f 4 a a e c ( t D e p\nm m a L d ( 1 fi o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/3/4405/6754327 by Technical Inform ation C enter D enm ark - D TU user on 06 D ecem ber 2022\nGiven the adopted unitary mass of the JAM model and the roportionality between masses and squared velocities, the galaxy ynamical mass can be computed as M JAM = V 2 rms /v 2 los , where V rms is he observ ed v elocity dispersion fitted by PPXF from the MOSFIRE pectrum, which approximates the luminosity-weighted second veocity moments inside the aperture (see discussion after equation 29 f Cappellari et al. 2013 ). The fitted dynamical mass physically epresents the stellar mass of the galaxy, under the assumption that he stellar mass follows the light and the M / L has the same value as ts average ( M / L )( r < R ap ) inside the re gion R ap 1.35 R e co v ered y the MOSFIRE kinematics:\nJAM \u2248 L Ser \u00d7 ( M/L )( r < R ap ) .

As a final test, we disregard the observed xial ratio and assume as the most extreme case that the galaxy is erfectly face-on, still with q intr = 0.2 and anisotropy \u03b2 = 0.2. This nrealistic scenario results in log 10 ( M JAM /M ) = 11.44, still less than he measured M \u2217 from FAST . Therefore, the discrepancy between M \u2217 nd M dyn cannot be resolved by simply taking into consideration the bserved geometry of the galaxy. Further investigation into solving his mass inconsistency is outside the scope of this paper, but will ikely need to incorporate the effect of the merger on the internal ynamics of GOODS-S 43114. Better consistency between dynamical and stellar mass measureents has been found in other studies of high-redshift quiescent alaxies. F or e xample, van de Sande et al. ( 2013 ) find dynamical asses \u223c15 per cent larger than stellar masses for a sample of 5 assive (log 10 ( M \u2217/M ) > 11) quiescent z \u223c 2 galaxies. Additional tudies of high-redshift, massive, quiescent galaxies find that M \u2217 and dyn are roughly consistent with each other (e.g. Belli, Newman & llis 2017 ; Tanaka et al. 2019 ; Esdaile et al. 2021 ). Ho we ver, the ajority of galaxies in these earlier works have structural properties onsistent with a spheroidal geometry. GOODS-S 43114 is not unique for appearing disc-like at z \u223c 2. For xample, Newman et al. ( 2018a , b ) identify four fast-rotating ( v/ \u03c3 2), disc-dominated quiescent galaxies at z \u223c 2 with comparable tellar masses to those presented here (see also Toft et al. 2012 , 017 ). Newman et al. and Toft et al. ar gue that mer ger interactions ill cause these massive galaxies evolve into the slow rotator ETGs hat dominate abo v e M \u2217 2 \u00d7 10 11 M in the nearby Universe (see e vie w by Cappellari 2016 ), given their already-extreme masses.\nGOODS-S 43114 is undergoing a major merger interaction with OODS-S 43683, which will likely have a significant impact on ts structural properties. Its subsequent star-formation history to the resent day will depend on the details of the merger interaction with OODS-S 43683 as well as the cool gas content in both galaxies. ccordingly, both GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 comprise ompelling targets for observations of molecular gas (e.g. CO), in rder to understand the fuel available for subsequent star formation.\n.3 Constraints from far-IR and radio obser v ations\np until this point, the longest wavelength data analysed here has een the IRAC Channel 4 band at 8 \u03bcm ( \u223c2.75 \u03bcm in the rest rame). In this section, we fold longer wavelength data into the iscussion, specifically the 24 \u03bcm band from the Multiband Imaging hotometer for Spitzer (MIPS; Rieke et al. 2004 ) instrument on he Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004 ); the 70, 100, nd 160 \u03bcm bands from the Photodetector Array Camera and pectrometer (PACS; Poglitsch et al. 2010 ) and the 250, 350, nd 500 \u03bcm bands from the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Ecei ver (SPIRE; Grif fin et al. 2010 ) instruments on the Herschel pace Observatory ; and the 1.4 GHz band from the Very Large rray (VLA; Perley et al. 2011 ; Miller et al. 2013 ; Biggs et al. 011 ; Smail et al. pri v ate communication). We obtained MIPS data rom Giavalisco et al. ( 2004 ), and PACS and SPIRE observations rom Elbaz et al. ( 2011 ). These longer wavelength data points ore directly trace the dust content of galaxies and can reveal tar formation and AGN activity that is severely obscured by ust at rest-frame UV through rest-frame near -IR wa velengths. or e xample, Smail et al. ( 1999 ) show in a sample of z = 0.4 luster galaxies that some galaxies previously classified as posttarbursts from rest-frame optical data alone contain radio-bright omponents revealing previously unaccounted-for, obscured star ormation.\nLong wavelength observations of the merger system in fact reveal etections at mid- and f ar-IR w avelengths, indicating the presence f dust emission. Ho we ver, the angular resolution of MIPS, PACS, nd SPIRE is not sufficient to secure spatially-distinct of GOODS43114 and GOODS-S 43683 (i.e. the two galaxies are blended ogether). Therefore, in this analysis, we attempt to constrain the otal dust-obscured SFR and AGN contribution associated with the ombined 43114 + 43683 system (as opposed to estimating the dustbscured SFR and AGN contribution in each galaxy individually). e can use this combined SFR estimate to test if both galaxies re found in a post-starburst phase, even when long-wavelength ata is taken into account. The methodology adopted here a v oids ncertain assumptions about the distribution of mid-IR and farR flux between the two galaxies. We use the code STARDUST Kokorev et al. 2021 ) to model the observed mid- and far-IR ED of the 43114 + 43683 pair. The STARDUST code is ideal or this analysis, given the known AGN detections of GOODS-S 3114 and GOODS-S 43683, because STARDUST simultaneously ccounts for the multiwavelength contributions from stars, AGN, nd infrared dust emission. Furthermore, STARDUST does not require nergy balance, thus allowing for additional star formation that is ompletely obscured at rest-frame UV through near -IR wa velengths Kokorev et al. 2021 ). Note that we use the Mullaney et al. ( 2011 ) emplates to fit the AGN component, the Draine & Li ( 2007 ), raine et al. ( 2014 ) templates to fit the IR dust, and utilize Jin t al. ( 2018 ) for the deblending technique in the extraction of far-IR hotometry. Fig. 7 shows the mid- and far-IR SED for the 43114 + 43683 erger system, along with the best-fit multi-component STARDUST odel. The blue-shaded region identifies the portion of the SED ttributed to light from the AGN ( L IR, AGN = (1.14 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10 12 ), while the red shaded region identifies the portion attributed to ust emission that has been heated by the stellar population ( L IR, SF = 3.1 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 11 L , with an associated M dust = (2.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 0 9 M ). The black curve represents the total AGN + dust SED. We nd that the resultant SFR associated with the non-AGN portion f the IR SED is 31 \u00b1 6 M yr \u22121 , which is not significantly\nMNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\n4414 J. N.

The galaxy pair is unresolved at these wavelengths, so the MIPS, PACS, and SPIRE measurements represent the summed contributions from both galaxies. The SED-fitting code, STARDUST , is used to constrain the longer wavelength portion of the SED for the galaxy pair and estimate the AGN (blue) and dust (red) components of the total flux (black).

We ote that the inferred 1.4 GHz flux density of 30 \u00b1 7 \u03bcJy (while ot included in the STARDUST fitting) is entirely consistent with the est-fitting AGN + dust model fit to the combined mid- and farR SED following the L IR to radio correlation from Delhaize et al. 2017 ). The SFR estimate inferred from the fit to the long-wavelength ata, while larger than that inferred from the SED at Spitzer /IRAC nd shorter wavelengths, is also significantly lower than the peak FRs inferred several hundred Myr in the past from both FAST and ROSPECTOR (see Fig. 5 ). Additionally, the higher SFR value from TARDUST could be due to a time lag, as the SFR estimated from ong wavelengths is less responsive to recent changes in the SFR ompared to the rest-optical regime. If the SFR of the system is ctively decreasing, which is expected between the first and second ericentric passages (see Moreno et al. 2019 ), the SFR estimated rom dust could easily be larger than the SFR inferred from the restptical regime. Therefore, we conclude that the inclusion of the midnd far-IR data does not change the principal conclusions of this ork: both galaxies still appear to be in a post-starburst phase, which s consistent with multiple pieces of evidence (i.e. strong Balmer bsorption lines and SFHs fit to rest-frame UV through rest-frame ear-IR SEDs) presented in this study. As we look ahead, JWST and/or ALMA will be needed to obtain istinct observations of GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 (i.e. ot blended together) at long wavelengths. Such data will enable ore robust constraints on the dust content, AGN activity, and\nbscured star formation, individually, in each galaxy. We also note hat van Dokkum & Brammer ( 2010 ) find evidence for faint spiral rms in the residuals of the F160W image of GOODS-S 43114, once he dominant compact core is subtracted off. The spatially resolved ST /WFC3 grism spectrum of GOODS-S 43114 may suggest a faint evel of residual star formation associated with these spiral arms.\nNRAS 517, 4405\u20134416 (2022)\nSUMMARY\nn this study, we analyse high-quality Keck/MOSFIRE spectra and ultiwavelength photometry of a merger at z = 1.89 between two alaxies that host AGN: GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683. tellar Balmer absorption lines (H \u03b3 and H \u03b4) are detected in he MOSFIRE J band of GOODS-S 43114. Combining the high /N spectra and broad-band SED-fitting with insights from realistic alaxy merger simulations enables us to obtain and study the physical roperties and SFHs of both galaxies in the merger pair as well as he current phase of the merger process.\nThe main results are as follows:\n(i) Both merging galaxies have a close M \u2217 ratio, indicating that this s a major merger. In addition, both galaxies have recently shut off heir star formation as shown by their SFR(SED) and strong Balmer bsorption lines.\n(ii) The depressed SFRs combined with the visible tidal tails mply that the galaxies have undergone their first pericentric passage.\nodelling the SFHs suggests that the pericentric passage most likely appened \u223c0.5\u20131 Gyr ago (approximately around the time of peak tar formation of the system).\n(iii) GOODS-S 43114 has a low inclination indicating that it is oughly a face-on disc based on its morphology and smaller than xpected second v elocity moment estimate. More robust modelling hat takes into account the inclination and geometry of a facen disc does not resolve the discrepancy between the dynamical nd stellar masses. More work is needed to address this mass nconsistency. Galaxies that are massive (log 10 ( M \u2217/M ) > 11), dischaped, rotating, and quiescent at z \u223c 2 are likely the progenitors f the most massive, spheroidal and slow-rotating elliptical galaxies resent in the local uni verse. Ho we ver, they must undergo significant tructural evolution o v er the intervening \u223c10 Gyr.\n(iv) Fitting the spatially unresolved mid- and far-IR SED of the ombined GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 system yields onsistent conclusions to those obtained by fitting the rest-frame UV hrough near-IR data of the individual merging galaxies. Specifically, e still find that the GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS-S 43683 system s in a post-starburst phase with ongoing AGN activity, and signifcantly lower star formation at the epoch of observation compared o the past peak. One limitation of the longer wavelength data is hat the 2 arcsec separation between GOODS-S 43114 and GOODS43683 is smaller than the angular resolution of Spitzer /MIPS, nd Herschel /PACS and SPIRE. JWST and/or ALMA observations re needed to study these galaxies in this long-wavelength regime ndividually.\nUnderstanding the rapid onset and shut-down of star formation uring mergers, especially at z \u223c 2 (i.e. the peak epoch of star ormation), is important for furthering our knowledge of how mergers ffect the galactic baryon c ycle. Comprehensiv e studies of individual ergers like the GOODS-S 43114/GOODS-S 43683 system can elp further constrain simulations leading to a more accurate galaxy volution models. For the merger pair analyzed in this work, spaceased observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will enable s to observe the full range of rest-optical emission-lines (e.g. H \u03b1, \u03b2, [O III ] \u03bb\u03bb4960,5008, and [O II ] \u03bb\u03bb3727,3730) that are currently idden outside the windows of atmospheric transmission. Measureent of these emission-lines will greatly increase our knowledge of he merger, as they contain a wealth of information on AGN activity nd gas outflows, as well as the physical properties of the ionized SM.\nz = 1.89 merger 4415 A\nT w I A b W 1 A N k P W w H w A t p s w o A t s\nD\nT t\n( G 2 V 2 E 2 M e\nR\nA A A A B B\nB B B B B B B C\n9\nC C C C C C C C C C C\nD D D D\nD D D E E\nE F G G G H H H H H\nH H H J J J K K K K K K\nK K L\nL\nL M\nM M M\nM M M M\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/3/4405/6754327 by Technical Inform ation C enter D enm ark - D TU user on 06 D ecem ber 2022\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhis study is based on data obtained at the W.M.
