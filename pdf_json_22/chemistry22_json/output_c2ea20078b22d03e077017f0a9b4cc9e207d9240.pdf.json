It strongly binds to the corresponding antigens \u2013 usually biomacromolecules foreign to the organism \u2013 with high specificity, playing a key role in the immune system of mammals.1 For this reason, IgG is extremely relevant not only in diagnostics,2,3 therapeutics4,5 and theragnostics6 but also in applications where very high selectivity towards a target molecule is mandatory, as (bio)sensoristics7,8 and affinity chromatography.9,10 IgG can be conveniently isolated from plasma by the classical Cohn\u2019s method based on the fractional precipitation of serum proteins by ethanol.11 Unfortunately, this method does not assure the complete separation of IgG from other serum proteins, and more efficient downstream purification strategies must be used to obtain pure IgG fractions. Several methods based on affinity ligands of natural or artificial origin have been proposed but, at present, affinity chromatography based on Protein A, a 42 kDa protein with high affinity at the Fc region of IgG, is the preferred method for preparative and industrial purposes.12\u201314 However, this method suffers from high costs and limited stability of Protein A, and harsh elution conditions which can sometimes lead to irreversible damage of IgG. Thus, man-made IgG-binding materials based on the molecular imprinting technology which could overcome these drawbacks are of significant interest. In the last 10 years, several papers describing different approaches to IgG imprinting have been published: cryogels,15,16 films,17,18 hydrogels,19 interpenetrating polymers,20 magnetic particles,21,22 membranes,23,24\nmicrobeads25,26 and molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) prepared by solid phase synthesis (SPS).27\nThis latter approach has proved particularly useful for obtaining high affinity protein-imprinted nanopolymers, characterized by high selectivity for the template and complete\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Torino, Via Giuria 7, 10125 - Torino, Italy.

It is nevertheless possible to consider using other cross-linkers, of which, however, the effect on the binding properties of nanoMIPs has never been reported in the literature to date, with the remarkable exception of the use of N,N0-ethylene dimethacrylamide for the solid phase synthesis of adenosine monophosphate-binding nanoMIPs.38\nIn this work, in order to investigate the effect of different cross-linkers in rabbit IgG-imprinted nanoMIPs prepared by SPS, alongside BIS, we have considered some other similar cross-linkers whose structural formulae are shown in Chart 1: N,N0-ethylene dimethacrylamide (EDAM), N,O-bis-methacryloylethanolamine (NOBE), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) and glycerol dimethacrylate (GDMA), replacing them for the BIS in prepolymerization mixtures without changing the molar proportions with functional monomers. The binding properties of the nanoMIPs have been measured via equilibrium partition experiments\nwith the template, rabbit IgG (RIgG), and the selectivity has been evaluated with respect to three other proteins of interest: bovine IgG (BIgG), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and hen egg lysozyme (LZM)."

The composition of nanoparticles can be influenced by the different reactivities of the monomers, as well as the effective degree of crosslinking, but, because of the limited quantity of nanoparticles obtained, no attempts were made to establish the effective degree of crosslinking.

This is confirmed by z potential measurements, reported in Table 1, where, at pH 7, all the nanoMIPs show a net negative potential, with z values between 7.4 mV (GDMA) and 23.9 mV (BIS), while, at pH 3, under more acidic conditions, where carboxyls are fully protonated, z turns positive, with values between +1.0 mV (EDMA) and +15.1 (NOBE).\nThe hydrodynamic diameter, dp, measured by laser nanoparticle tracking at pH 7 shows nanoparticles with average diameters just over a hundred nm, ranging from 129 nm (BIS) to 169 nm (EDAM), and with a polydispersity index between 0.24 (NOBE) and 0.30 (GDMA), corresponding to moderately polydispersed nanoparticles. In a more acidic environment, at pH 3, the formation of aggregates larger than 1 mm (the instrumental limit of the particle tracker set-up), was indirectly observed, because the nanoparticle count fell by two orders of magnitude from 105 to 103. The fraction of nanoparticles remained in solution; the polydispersity index remains essentially constant, but diameters increase markedly,\nranging from 147 nm (GDMA) to 189 nm (EDAM). These results show that in the solid phase synthesis the cross-linker structure marginally affects the dimensions of the resulting nanoparticles, which are probably mainly controlled by the formation of dangling long chains of monomers, some or most not crosslinked. Regardless, the cross-linker in some manner is yet capable of influencing the flexibility of nanoMIPs. In fact, while nanoparticles containing BIS or NOBE are able to double their volume from pH 7 to pH 3, nanoparticles containing EBIS, EDMA or GDMA swell significantly less. It must be noted that the swelling ability of the nanoparticles does not seem to be related to binding properties (vide infra, Section 3.3 for experimental results), as BIS- and GDMA-based nanopolymers show comparable binding constants but very different swelling abilities from pH 7 to pH 3. It is also noteworthy that the absolute difference in the z values measured between pH 7 and pH 3 is proportional to the swelling ability of the nanoparticles. This is not unexpected because as the volume changes, the surface charge density changes proportionally (whatever its sign), equally affecting the resulting z potential."

            "text": "In the traditional molecular imprinting techniques (bulk, suspension/emulsion, etc.) BIS is used very little and the cross-linker constitutes up to 80% molar of the polymerization mixture, thus exerting a deep effect not only on the morphology of the polymer and its bulk properties, but also on the binding properties.44\u201346 In contrast, in the SPS technique, BIS is the preferred cross-linker, and in the pre-polymerization mixture it\nis added in a much more limited amount, practically never more than 3% by moles. Consequently, it is to be expected that the effect on molecular recognition properties by the crosslinker is limited, and that the presence of structurally different cross-linkers is not able to affect these properties.\nSurprisingly, the determination of the equilibrium binding constant, Keq, by equilibrium partition experiments shows a distinctly different situation. In fact, as reported in Table 2, all the cross-linkers used for the imprinting of RIgG give nanoMIPs with a Keq value of around 10\n7 mol 1 L, with the remarkable exception of EDMA, which gives a significantly lower value of 3.4 106 mol 1 L. In comparison, the corresponding nanoNIPs, prepared by SPS with diclofenac as the template, show Keq with values significantly lower than the values for the corresponding nanoMIPs and indistinguishable from each other (t-test: a = 0.05, n = 10, t o 2.101).\nThe differing values of Keq obtained for each nanoMIP have an obvious influence on the imprinting factor, IF, that is an estimate of how much the binding affinity increases for an imprinted polymer with respect to a non-imprinted polymer of identical compositions. In Fig. 4, all the five nanoMIPs show IF values higher than unity, confirming the success of the SPS\nFig. 1 AFM image of a glass slide covalently grafted at low ionic strength with nanoMIPs prepared with GDMA as the cross-linker.

However, while nanoMIPs containing BIS and GDMA show IF values higher than 10 (BIS: 12.3 3.0, GDMA 11.6 3.5), corresponding to a very strong imprinting effect, others show markedly lower IF values (EDAM: 5.5 1.6, NOBE: 7.2 2.0), demonstrating that the choice of the right cross-linker is important to achieve an efficient SPS process, regardless of whether the cross-linker itself is present in the pre-polymerization mixture in very limited quantities compared to the other monomers. It should be noted that the GDMA-based nanoMIPs are to be considered structurally more complex than the other nanoMIPs, as they are composed of an almost equimolar mixture of two different cross-linkers, respectively, glycerol 1,2- and 1,3-dimethacrylate. However, the resulting nanoMIP does not appear to behave significantly differently from other nanoMIPs, except of course for those based on EDMA. It is also noteworthy that the polymer with the lowest IF value (2.8 1.1) contains EDMA, which represents the predominant cross-linker used to prepare imprinted polymers with the traditional approaches. This fact is strong evidence of how the SPS technique differs from the other molecular imprinting approaches, and how it is necessary to pay attention to transfer pre-polymerization mixture formulations from one approach to another without a careful preliminary evaluation.\nIn addition to the magnitude of the binding constant and imprinting factor, a third essential parameter for evaluating the molecular recognition properties of nanoMIPs is the binding selectivity, a. In this work, we evaluated the selectivity of RIgGimprinted nanoMIPs towards a structurally very similar protein such as bovine IgG (BIgG), a protein structurally different but of similar isoelectric point, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and a protein of different structures and isoelectric points such as the hen egg lysozyme (LZM).\nThe a values in Fig. 5 show that all the nanopolymers characterized by high affinity (Keq B 10\n7 mol 1 L) are selective towards the template RIgG, with a limited but substantial recognition (0.2 r a r 0.4) towards BIgG, confirming the results reported in the literature for human IgG-imprinted\nnanoMIPs.27 This limited recognition can be explained on the basis of the shared presence in the IgG structure of the Fc fragment, which differs little between the proteins of different species.1 As a template RIgG is randomly grafted on the surface of the glass beads, nanoMIPs produced by SPS will have molecular recognition properties towards different parts of the template structure. Some will have binding sites recognizing the Fc fragment, common to IgG from different species, while others will recognize other portions of the protein, which are typical for IgG of a particular species. Therefore, during the rebinding of BIgG, some nanoMIPs will preferentially bind the Fc fragment, regardless of its origin (rabbit or bovine), while others, more selective, will not be able to bind the BIgG. Thus, the resulting binding will be an average between the full (Fc-binding nanoMIPs) and the weak (non-Fc-binding nanoMIPs) recognition of BIgG.\nIn contrast, because of the low affinity resulting in a limited imprinting factor, with EDMA-based nanoMIPs, RIgG and BIgG are recognized almost in the same way, confirming the substantial absence of selectivity. It must be noted that the low values of Keq measured for EDMA-based nanoMIPs (2.4 0.4 106 mol 1 L) and nanoNIPs (1.6 0.4 106 mol 1 L) are statistically indistinguishable from each other (t-test: a = 0.05, n = 10, t = 1.414). Therefore, in this case, the binding to BIgG cannot be attributed for certain to the presence of imprinted binding sites.\nConcerning BSA and LZM, as these proteins are very different from IgG, for all the nanopolymers, the molecular recognition results are very limited, lower than that observed for BIgG. However, it should be noted that the binding behaviour presents significant differences, since for BIS-, EDMA- and GDMA-based nanopolymers the recognition follows the order of similarity, i.e. BIgG 4 BSA 4 LZM, while in the case for EDAM- and NOBEbased nanopolymers it is different, as the first recognizes the three proteins in the same way, while, for the second, BSA and LZM show almost no recognition, confirming that small changes in the nature of the cross-linker \u2013 i.e. the replacement of an amide group with an ester group (NOBE vs. EDAM) \u2013 exert a significant effect on the binding properties of the nanoMIPs.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

            "text": "The results reported in this work confirm the relevance of the cross-linker structure in the SPS technique. Although present in minimal quantities compared to the other monomers in the pre-polymerization mixture, they are able to influence the binding affinity and selectivity of protein-imprinted nanopolymers through subtle differences in their structure, i.e. the replacement of an amide group with an ester group (NOBE vs. EDAM), the presence of a hydroxyl group (GDMA vs. EDMA) or the number of atoms in the molecular bridge (BIS vs. EDAM). The experimental results currently available are not sufficient to advance quantitative hypotheses on the relationship between the binding properties of nanoMIPs and structural properties of cross-linkers, but it is plausible that a further expansion of the number of cross-linkers tested could provide robust indications on the type of molecular structure optimal for obtaining nanoMIPs with high affinity and selectivity for the target molecule.\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization: C.
