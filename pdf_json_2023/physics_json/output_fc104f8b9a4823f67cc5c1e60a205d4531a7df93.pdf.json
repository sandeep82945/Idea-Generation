Introduction Rates of chemical reactions and their equilibrium positions, as well as the position and intensity of absorption bands in UV/Vis/near-IR, IR, ESR, and NMR spectroscopy, are solvent-dependent1\u20134. The chemical physics of solvation in solvent mixtures is of current interest5\u20137. Experimental evidence suggests that the solute may change the solvent composition in the solvation sphere compared to that in bulk8,9. This phenomenon is termed \u2018preferential solvation\u2019 and originates due to a difference in solventsolvent and solute-solvent interaction. Apart from preferential solvation, there is always some probability that both the constituent solvents can solvate the molecules together by mutual interaction and give rise to a completely different environment. Such a phenomenon is observed for some speci c solvent pairs and is termed \u2018Synergism\u2019. Synergism has been studied for binary solvent mixtures experimentally7, 10\u201313, and theoretically14\u201317 regarding solvent-solvent and solute-solvent interactions. Electronic spectroscopy provides a suitable method for studying solvation. It has been observed that the maximum energy (ET) of electronic transition involving intramolecular charge transfer in various solutes depends signi cantly on the local environment around the solute1,10. At the microscopic level, information about solvent-solvent and solute-solvent interactions consists of nonspeci c and speci c solvation modes. Usually, three parameters, solvent polarity-polarizability, H-bond acceptance ability or solvent basicity, and H-bond donation ability or solvent acidity, have been characterized to represent the various modes of solvation1,4,8. Mancini et al.18 proposed that the combination of bipolarity and hydrogen bond donating and accepting capacity of solvents leads synergistic effect in binary solvent mixtures, which is re ected through ET (30) empirical solvent polarity parameter.\nCharacterization of solvation behavior has been done by employing various methods. The different modes of solvation of solvatochromic molecules have been widely investigated by various ultrafast techniques such as picosecond or femtosecond time-resolved uorescence spectroscopy19\u201325, twodimensional IR spectroscopy26, femtosecond pump \u2212 probe spectroscopy26\u201329, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy19. Bhattacharyya et al.30 measured the thermal-lens signals as a function of the relative\nPage 3/21\nproportion of binary solvent mixtures. Additionally, much work has also been carried out using molecular dynamics simulations20,26, vibrational spectroscopy31, UV-Vis spectroscopy7,11, NMR chemical shifts32,33, solvation dynamics21, etc. Refractive index measurements of binary solvent mixtures have also been used to determine the quantitative information about the solvent-solvent interactions34,35. Other related kinds of solvatochromic species have been used as probes of their environment in micelles36\u201338, polymers39,40, surfaces 39,41, zeolites42, and inorganic glasses43,44, etc. They may be used in this way either by their response to the electric eld experienced in a particular environment or because of speci c interactions between the probe and the environment, e.g., hydrogen bonding between solvent-solvent and solute-solvent. Solvatochromism is also a valuable predictor of nonlinear optical behavior since the properties that give rise to high solvatochromism are the same for signi cant second-order nonlinear optical coe cients (\u03b2)40,45.\nDespite a large number of studies, the experimental determination of the nature of the solvation cage in the binary solvent mixture has not yet been well established. In the present contribution, we throw light on the origin of synergism in the binary solvent mixture of MeOH and DMF in RhB and Rh101 using electronic spectroscopy, uorescence spectroscopy, and Two-Photon-Induced Fluorescence (TPIF)39.\nIn the two-photon absorption process, a molecule or uorophore absorbs two photons simultaneously, and no change occurs in the angular momentum of the material. The two-photon absorption process is a third-order nonlinear process46. The two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) was rst carried out by Denk et al.47 at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, which has led to an increasing interest in the eld of microscopy. TPLSM has shown vast applications in the eld of medicinal and biological research. Kaiser and Garret, in 1961, rstly demonstrated the two-photon induced uorescence in the CaF2:Eu2+ crystal48. Two photon-induced uorescence (TPIF), an indirect and accurate method for calculating the two-photon absorption cross-section provided quantum e ciency of the uorophore, is already known to all. One of the advantages of using the TPIF method is that we can avoid the in uences of other optical nonlinear processes in determining the two-photon absorption cross-section (TPACS) of materials so that obtained values will be very close to the accurate ones. Wide applications of materials with high TPACS have been reported through investigation, such as three-dimensional micro- and nanofabrication49,50 three-dimensional uorescence microscopy51, optical limiting52,53, and optical data storage54. However, the surrounding environment of solvent molecules can in uence this two-photon process in a uorophore.\nThe TPIF process is mainly due to the polarity of the medium, which signi cantly modulates the TPACS values55,56. Many articles have been published supporting the effects of the surroundings of single solvent molecules on TPACS values. Our research group has already published the effects on the values of two-photon absorption and two-photon uorescence using single solvent molecules of several Xanthenes dyes57. A recent study has noted that the eld of binary solvents for understanding intermolecular interactions has gained interest from many researchers. The importance of binary solvent mixtures in chemical, physical, and biochemical processes has been extensively discussed in previous\nPage 4/21\nliterature 2,26,57. Thus, keeping the recent approaches in mind, our research group had already published an article on the effect of different sets of Binary Solvents of Rhodamine-6G Dye on Two-Photon-Induced Fluorescence 58. We tried to compare the effects of intermolecular interactions on the TPIF of commonly used uorescent dyes RhB, which is often used as a tracer dye within water to determine the rate and direction of ow and transport, and Rh101, which is a highly stable uorophore in the Rhodamine family. A microheterogeneous environment can be created for dye molecules by mixing two miscible solvents. Research in binary solvents draws considerable interest because of its widespread applications in areas such as low-temperature glasses59, cryo-protecting agents60, and observing the antagonistic effect on a protein structure59. We have used different sets of binary mixtures in various fractions of Methanol as a standard component with each of the solvents, water, DMF, and chloroform to compare the information about the effects of intermolecular interactions on the TPIF of RhB and Rh101.\n2. Experimental Sections\n2.1. Material We used Fluorescence grade Rhodamine 6G dye (dye content: 99%) (used as the sample reference), Rhodamine B dye (dye content:99%), and Rhodamine 101 dye (Dye content:99%) that were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further puri cation. HPLC-grade Methanol (MeOH) was purchased from Thomas Baker (Mumbai, India HPLC UV-grade N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from SRL (Mumbai, India). All care was taken to avoid moisture contamination during the experiments. All the experiments were performed at room temperature. 2.2. Steady-state absorption and Fluorescence Measurements All the one-photon UV-VIS absorption spectra of RhB and Rh101 in the binary solvents as well as in the individual pure solvents in 10\u2212 4 M concentration are measured in 1mm long quartz cuvette through the Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer (a double-beam, double monochromator ratio recording system with pre-aligned tungsten-halogen and deuterium lamps as sources). Single-photon uorescence spectra were recorded using Perkin Elmer LS55 Fluorescence Spectrometer. Quartz Fluorescence cuvettes (10\u00d710 mm) were used with a white PTFE stopper to prevent solvent evaporation. Emission spectra were background corrected using a solvent blank to correct any emission arising from the solvent. 2.3. Two-Photon Induced Fluorescence (TPIF) In this experiment, we used the Mode-locked ampli ed Femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser (Astrella, Coherent Inc. USA) to study two-photon induced uorescence (TPIF). Figure\u00a01 illustrates a representative schematic of the TPIF setup. We measured the pulse width of the laser beam using the eld autocorrelation technique to be 49 fs. We used a 1kHz repetition rate pulsed laser beam for the excitation of the sample at 802nm. This laser beam was focused into Quartz Fluorescence cuvettes (10 x 10 mm) using a 20 cm\nPage 5/21\nfocusing lens. The sample cuvette was placed perpendicularly to the propagation direction of the laser beam so that the maximum TPIF was collected through a collecting objective (10 \u00d7 0.25 NA, Newport). The TPIF thus collected was focused onto an optical ber connected to the HR2000 spectrometer. The HR2000, in turn, is connected to the computer through the GPIB interface. Data was collected using the standard LabVIEW program with 1000 ms of integration time of the HR2000 spectrometer. We carried out the power-dependent TPIF experiments to verify the two-photon absorption process. For such powerdependent studies, we used the combination of a polarizer and half-wave plate for the smooth variation of intensity of laser where the change of the laser beam intensity was controlled by the half wave plate while keeping the polarizer undisturbed.\n3. Results And Discussion 3.1. Single Photon Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra of RhB and Rh101 dyes in the binary solvent mixtures of MeOH and DMF\nRhB([9-(2-carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)xanthen-3-ylidene]-diethylazanium chloride) is a cationic and Rh101(2-(3-oxa-23-aza-9-azoniaheptacyclo [17.7.1.15,9.02,17.04,15.023,27.013, 28]octacosa1(27),2(17),4,9(28),13,15,18-heptaen-16-yl)benzoate) is inner salt dyes, whose chemical structure are shown in Fig. 2(a)-(b).\nIt has a large number of conjugated double bonds that enhance its two-photon absorption process. Absorption study of RhB and Rh101 dye in binary mixture solvents and pure individual component solvents exhibit a doublet band with one absorption maxima and a shoulder in the main peak. Positions of these doublet bands are directly in uenced by the nature of the surrounding solvent molecules. The occurrence of the shoulder in the main absorption peak is directly related to the formation of aggregates of dye molecules we can see in, Fig. 3(a)-(b), which in turn, is directly related to the nature of the solvents viz. polar or nonpolar. We took the absorption spectra for RhB and Rh101 in binary mixtures of MeOH and DMF (MeOH + DMF) by varying volume fractions. We can see from Fig. 3(a) and (b) that the shoulder in the main peak of RhB in MeOH + DMF decreases as the mole fraction of MeOH increases, whereas in the case of Rh101 dye, the main peak of Rh101 in MeOH + DMF increases with the increasing mole fraction of MeOH.\nThe alteration of the absorption maximum and emission max of either dye (RhB or Rh101) in the MeOH + DMF binary set of solvent as a function of XMeOH is presented in Fig. 4(a) & (b), respectively. To represent the stabilization of the dye in the corresponding binary mixture concept of molar electronic transition energy (ET) has been introduced, whose relationship to the absorption maximum (\u03bbmax, nm) is given by1,32, 60\u201368\n1\nET = 28591\n\u03bbmax\nPage 6/21\nFor an ideal mixture, one expects that any equilibrium property in a binary liquid (e.g., solvation energy, composition) will be a weighted average of the values in the two solvents. Thus, in an ideal case, where all solvent \u2212 solvent interactions are assumed to be the same, the dye is characterized by a maximum value of the molar electronic transition energy given by6,21,23\n2\nwhere, and represent mole fractions of solvents 1 and 2, respectively and and are the values of the dye or indicator of solute in pure solvents 1 and 2, respectively. This equation corresponds to the ideal behavior of a binary solvent mixture, and the variation of as a function of the mole fraction of either component should always be linear. However, in practice, the variation is barely linear, suggesting speci c and selective interactions between the dye molecule and one of the components of the solvent mixture; this is termed \u2018preferential solvation\u2019. In addition, deviations from the ideal behavior might also appear from the interaction of the combined solvent counterparts in the binary solvent mixture, exhibiting a synergistic effect. A direct measure of stabilization energy is given in terms of molar transition energy , and the variation is expressed as a function of XMeOH in the binary mixture. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that RhB in MeOH + DMF shows a regular pattern of variation in absorption maximum and shows a blueshift. In contrast, the absorption maximum of Rh101 in MeOH + DMF binary solvents shows redshift and then blueshift after XMeOH = 0.6.\nThus, it is clear from Fig. 4 that the emission maximum of dyes in a different set of solvents strongly depends on the composition of the solvent mixture. Emission maxima of each dye, RhB and Rh101, show systematic opposite solvation behavior with consistent emission maxima pattern shifts observed in MeOH + DMF, i.e., from 585 nm to 580 nm for RhB, and from 592 nm to 599.5 nm in the case of Rh101.\n3.2. Two-Photon-Induced Fluorescence of RhB & Rh101 dyes in different sets of binary solvents mixture We carried out two-photon induced uorescence of RhB and Rh101 in MeOH + DMF binary solvents at varying volume fractions of Methanol (XMeOH). Also, we compared it with respective single-photon uorescence spectra. Figure 5 (a)-(b) shows the two photon-induced uorescence spectra for the RhB and Rh101 in the pure Methanol at various excitation laser powers at 802 nm. Figure 5(c)-(d) shows the loglog plot of the TPIF intensity versus excitation laser powers, which veri es that the uorescence emission originates from the two-photon absorption process related to the linear absorption spectra.\nThe interactions between the molecules of the dye and solvent directly affect the energy levels between the ground and excited states. Fluorescence emission always occurs from the rst excited singlet state, leading to the spectral shift in the spectra towards longer wavelengths, i.e., redshift. Generally, the LippertMataga equation is used to describe the solvent dependent spectral-shift, as given below69\nET (ideal) = XS1ETS1 + XS2ETS2\nXS1 XS2 , ETS1 ETS2 ET\nET\nET\nPage 7/21\n3\nWhere \u03bdA and \u03bdF are the absorption and emission maximum in wave-number units h = Planck\u2019s constant, c = velocity of light, and a = radius of the cavity in which the sample uorophore is kept. \u03b5 and n are the solvent\u2019s dielectric constant and refractive index, respectively. As can be seen from the two-photon induced uorescence (TPIF) spectra, peak wavelengths are shifted from their corresponding linear absorption spectra in pure solvents and MeOH-DMF binary solutions.\nFrom the two-photon induced uorescence signal, we can determine the two-photon excitation action cross-section, \u03c3*, which is directly proportional to the two-photon absorption cross-section, \u03c32, according to the following equation\n4\nwhere is the uorescence quantum yield. Two-photon excitation action cross-section (TPEACS, \u03c3*) values were estimated using the following relation70.\n5\nwhere \u201cref\u201d stands for the reference (here, R6G in water was used as the reference) and \u201cs\u201d stands for the sample. Ci is the concentration in moles/liter, ni is the refractive index, and Fi is the two photon-induced uorescence (TPIF) integral intensity of the solution when excited at 802 nm. We have used the reported \u03c3* value of R6G in water (\u03c3R6G ~ 10.3 GM) as the \u03c3ref38. All the analyses were performed using Mathematica 9. Fluorescence quantum yield was calculated by using the following relation71:\n6\nwhere Ai is the absorbance, and Di is the integrated area under the corrected (baseline subtracted) emission spectrum. We have used the reported uorescence quantum yield of R6G ( ~ 0.95) in water as the standard reference72,73.\nWe used the Lorentz-Lorenz Eq. 30,74 to calculate the refractive indices of binary solvents.\nvA \u2212 vF = (\u03bce \u2212 \u03bcg) 2 ( \u2212 ) 2\nhca3\n\u03f5 \u2212 1\n2\u03f5 + 1\nn2 \u2212 1\n2n2 + 1\n\u03c3\u2217 = \u03c32\u2205\n\u2205\n\u03c3\u2217 = \u03c3ref \u2205ref\n\u2205s\nCref\nCs\nnref\nns Fs Fref\n\u2205\n\u2205s = \u2205ref Ds\nDref\nAref\nAs\nn2s\nn2ref\n\u2205Rh6G\nPage 8/21\n7\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of pure components, n is the refractive index of the binary solvents, and x1, x2, and \u03c11, \u03c12 are mole fractions and densities of components 1 and 2, respectively. After rearranging and applying some manipulation to the above equation, the refractive index of the binary solvents can be determined by the following equation:\n8\nwhere L is given by:\n9\nAlso, the density of binary solvent can be given by:\n10\nwhere, represents the volume fraction of the solute in the binary solvent mixture.\nAll the solutions of RhB and Rh101 were prepared at 10\u2212 4 M concentration in MeOH + DMF binary solvents as well as in the corresponding individual component solvents. As we see from Fig. 6(a), in MeOH + DMF mixtures, with increasing mole fraction of MeOH (XMeOH), RhB shows a red shift XMeOH = 0.00 to 0.1 (TPIF \u03bbmax increases from 569.91 nm to 596.81 nm). After that, there is a consistent blue shift (TPIF \u03bbmax decrease from 596.81 nm to 589.65 nm), i.e., there is a formation of non- uorescent aggregation (dimmers, trimmers, etc.), which reaches a maximum at XMeOH = 0.1. In the case of Rh101, the initial red-shift is seen at mole-fraction XMeOH = 0.00 to 0.4 (TPIF \u03bbmax increases from 575.75 nm to 612.02 nm). Thereafter there is a blue shift XMeOH = 0.40 to 1.00 (TPIF \u03bbmax decreases from 612.02 nm to 607.10 nm), i.e., the formation of non- uorescent aggregation maximum for Rh101 occurs at XMeOH = 0.30\u20130.40. Reduction in aggregation formation in RhB and Rh101 dyes directly in uences the TPIF intensity and results in higher TPEACS values Fig. 7 towards higher volume fractions of Methanol.\n( ) = ( ) + ( ) n2 \u2212 1\nn2 + 2\n1\n\u03c1\nn21 \u2212 1 n21 + 2\nX1 \u03c11\nn22 \u2212 1 n22 + 2\nX2 \u03c12\nn = ( ) 2L + 1\n1 \u2212 L\n1 2\nL = [( ) + ( ) ] \u03c1 n21 \u2212 1\nn21 + 2\nX1\n\u03c11\nn22 \u2212 1 n22 + 2\nX2\n\u03c12\n\u03c1 = \u03c11 + (\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c11) VX2\nVX2\nPage 9/21\nFurther, as we can see from the Fig. 7, at binary mixtures, in MeOH + DMF, RhB is showing the highest TPEACS value at XMeOH = 0.80 (24.16 GM) and lowest at XMeOH = 0.40 (5.71 GM) whereas Rh101 is showing the highest TPEACS value at XMeOH = 0.60 (21.73 GM) and lowest at XMeOH = 0 (1.74 GM). The reason for showing this enhancement in TPEACS value in the MeOH + DMF binary mixture may be correlated with the non-selective solvation in MeOH + DMF called synergism18. This behavior occurs because of networking between weak H-bond and H-bond-donator MeOH and H-bond acceptor DMF, which gives rise to different solvent responses. An earlier study of the MeOH + DMF binary mixture reported75 that at the 1:1 ratio of the components, there is the formation of a stable \u201ccomplex\u201d (sub-unit) of the type MeOH + DMF. The complex structure formation might be the reason for showing lesser TPEACS. Based on the above observations and arguments, we can propose that weaker intermolecular interactions between components of the binary solvent mixtures are giving rise to higher two-photon processes and, consequently, higher TPEACS values of the binary mixture solvents. Thus, Rh101 explores the synergism in the MeOH + DMF binary mixtures while RhB does not and instead shows preference towards solvation.\n4. Conclusions Steady-state absorption, emission, and two photon-induced Fluorescence Spectra of RhB and Rh101 dyes in MeOH + DMF binary solvents mixture explore the structure and solvation behavior of binary solvent mixtures. Strong synergistic solvation was observed for the combinations of hydrogen bond donating (e.g., MeOH) and accepting solvent (e.g., DMF) pairs, which causes solvatochromic probe molecules to sense increased polarity compared to the bulk counterparts. The origin of the strong synergism was explained in terms of solvent-solvent interactions as evidenced by probe dependence single photon absorption, emission, and two-photon induced Fluorescence measurements. The solvation behavior of the MeOH + DMF binary mixture shows strong probe dependence with no synergism observed when RhB was taken as the solvatochromic probe, ascribed to the higher ground state dipole moment of RhB (17.3642 D) relative to Rh101 (7.0186 D) as provided in Table\u00a01 of Supporting Information. Such strongly perturbed systems (due to high dipole moment) do not allow persistence of hydrogen bonding network, resulting in preferential solvation instead of synergism.\nDeclarations Supporting Information.\u00a0\nThe plot of absorption spectra of RhB and Rh101 in MeOH+DMF with different mole fractions of MeOH, the plot of the combined variation of absorption peak (from: Absorbance = extinction coe cient (e) \u00d7 Sample Length (L) \u00d7 concentration (C), where C = 10-4\u00a0M and L = 0.1 cm) of Rh and Rh101 in MeOH+DMF with the volume fractions of MeOH, combined variation of Absorption maxima of RhB and Rh101 in MeOH+DMF with the volume fractions of MeOH; Variation of Absorption molar electronic energy ET of RhB and Rh101 in MeOH+DMF binary solvent mixture with a fraction of Methanol, Normalized emission\nPage 10/21\nspectra of RhB and Rh101 in MeOH+DMF binary solvent with different mole fractions of MeOH, Variation of Integrated Area of emission normalized by Absorption(D) with the volume fractions of Methanol in MeOH+DMF binary solvent mixture and Table.1.
