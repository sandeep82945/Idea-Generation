    "abstractText": "The diversity of secondary metabolites of individual plants results from multiple enzymatic processes in planta and various environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture, and soil conditions. Chemical composition analysis of plants can lead to a new method to understand relationship among comparable plants along with biological classification such as genetic and anatomical method. In this study, the chemical diversity of nine different Lauraceae species was investigated, and the plant samples were chemically analyzed and classified. Multivariate analysis methods, such as PLS-DA, were used to select important metabolites distinguishing the nine Lauraceae species. The selected metabolites were identified through preparative LC-MS or MS/MS fragment pattern analysis. In addition, the chemical dendrogram for the nine Lauraceae species was interpreted through molecular network analysis and compared with the genetic dendrogram. This approach enabled us to compare the complete chemical compositions of multiple plant samples to identify relationships among plants.",

The chemical diversity of plant metabolites has been reported to be one of the phenotypic results of evolution [2]. We can gain insights into the evolution and taxonomy of different plant species from the distribution of specialized metabolites [3]. Although phytochemical studies are recognized for being able to deepen the understanding of relationships among targeted plants, comparative chemical analyses among Lauraceae have not been performed [4, 5]. Many taxonomic analyses for Lauraceae species have been conducted on using morphological [6, 7], anatomical [8\u201311], and genetic [12\u201314] differences to distinguish species.\nThe Lauraceae family is composed of approximately 55 genera totalling over 3000 species\ndistributed throughout Southeast Asia and tropical America [15].

This family contains valuable secondary metabolites and is therefore has economically important the food, pharmaceutical, and perfumery industries [16, 17]. For example, Cinnamomum burmannii, Litsea pungens, and Laurus nobilis are used in cooking as spices, and the fruits of Persea americana Mill. are used as a food ingredient [5, 15]. The essential oil, a representative component of the Lauraceae family, is both used as a perfume ingredient and has a wide range of biological activities, such as cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities [18\u2013 22].\nMetabolomics is a useful tool for comparing complete metabolites and differentiating geno-\ntypes of individual plants in a rapid and unbiased way [23]. The scope of metabolomics has been considerably expanded as an important method of fingerprinting and profiling for primary and secondary metabolites, as well as for the selection and identification of targeted metabolites [24]. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a widely used technique in plant metabolomics. A high sensitivity and strong compatibility with biomolecules make LC-MS suitable for profiling chemical composition from a large quantity of data [25, 26]. Metabolomics with multivariate analysis techniques is useful for nontargeted metabolic profiling [27]. For large-scale datasets, multivariate analyses, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), can be used to simplify complex data by transforming high-dimensional raw mass data to a lower number of variables as points in maps [28]. This statistical method enables the chemical compositions of plant metabolites to be conveniently discriminated. Specifically, the VIP score of PLS-DA can be determined by measuring the importance of individual metabolites in samples to improve the classification accuracy of samples [29].\nFourteen species in seven genera of the Lauraceae family are found in Korea that are also\nnative to Japan and Taiwan. In this study, nine Korean endemic Lauraceae species were compared and classified by their metabolite composition. The LC-MS spectral data of the nine samples were applied to multivariate analyses. Then, the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores determined using PLS-DA were used to select specific metabolites that are key factors for discriminating samples. The selected discriminatory metabolites were identified by using NMR or comparison with MS/MS fragment patterns obtained from spectral databases, such as GNPS (Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking). The complete chemical composition of the samples was visualized in a molecular networking system and compared with a chemical dendrogram. We used this approach to classify nine Lauraceae species based on their chemical composition, and the chemical dendrogram was compared with phylogenomic results obtained from a plastid genome sequence analysis."

Data processing was carried out by the MestReNova ver.12.0.1 program.\nCompounds 1, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were putatively annotated by comparison with masses,\nchemical formulas, and MS/MS fragment spectra from chemical databases (Table 2). The exact mass and molecular formulas were calculated by MassHunter qualitative analysis software B.06.00 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) with a mass accuracy below 7.5 ppm. The accurate mass and chemical formulas were used to search the compounds in each sample in the Scifinder1 chemical database (http://www.scifinder.org) (Compounds 1, 8, and 12 were identified in the L. erythrocarpa Makino database, 3 was identified in the L. japonica (Thunb.) Jussieu database, and 7 and 11 were identified in the N. sericea (Blume) database). Finally, our MS/MS fragment data for the target compounds were compared to the GNPS spectral database or other literature."

A total of 447 mass features were uploaded to a MetaboAnalyst server to perform multivariate statistical analyses on the chemical differences among the tested Lauraceae species. Score plots generated from both the PCA and PLS-DA models simply visualized information-rich spectral data by reducing the dimensions. PLS-DA is a supervised method that is an alternative to the unsupervised PCA method and interprets data with intergroup variability to better represent group structures [27]. The nine Lauraceae species were clustered more clearly in the PLS-DA (Fig 1B) than in the PCA (Fig 1A). The cross-validated coefficients of the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616 September 9, 2022 5 / 16\nPLS-DA model were Q2 = 0.985 and R2 = 0.99593, indicating good model quality (S2 Fig in S1 File). The compounds showing a significant difference among the nine Lauraceae samples were selected using the PLS-DA model (VIP score > 2.5), and a PLS-DA loading plot was generated to obtain the distribution of the selected compounds for all the compounds in the samples. The loading scatter plot of the PLS-DA model indicates the relationship between a characteristic variable and a categorical variable, which reflects the contribution of a considered variable on the score plot. The fourteen selected metabolites (Fig 2A) (representative chemical structures of the selected metabolites are shown in Fig 3) are displayed on the loading plot (Fig 2B), indicating that chemical compounds, such as cinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids, and isoquinoline alkaloids, were the major features distinguishing the nine Lauraceae species. Isoquinoline alkaloids, such as coclaurine (7) and roemerine (11), were selected as marker metabolites to separate Neolitsea sericea (Blume) Koidz (NS) from the other species on the PLS-DA score plot because of the relatively high concentrations of 7 and 11 in NS. The bar plot data presented in Fig 4 show that 7 was also found in small quantities in LJ, whereas 11 was only detected in NS and could therefore be a more definitive marker than 7. Flavonoids, such as catechin (4), dihydrokaempferol (8), and epicatechin (9), can similarly be used as differential markers to distinguish Litsea coreana H. Le\u0301v. (LC). Lindera erythrocarpa Makino (LDE) contained an abundance of neochlorogenic acid (1), phenylalanine (12), and quercitrin (13) and Machilus japonica Siebold & Zucc. (MJ) contained an abundance of chlorogenic acid (6). The fourteen metabolites are ranked by their VIP scores in Table 2, and the relative peak height of the metabolites are represented by using box and whisker plots in Fig 4.\nHierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was performed to investigate the grouping patterns\nof nine Lauraceae species according to the corresponding phytochemicals (Fig 5). The distinction between samples was confirmed by unsupervised HCA of the mass feature matrix. The dendrogram consisted of one separated branch (NS) and two clusters, of which one comprised CC and MJ and the other comprised NA, LC, MT, LDE, LJ, and CY. Although CC was clustered with MJ in the same cluster at a short phytochemical distance, CC and CY showed relatively weak correlations despite belonging to the same genus. Similarly, NA was more closely\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616 September 9, 2022 6 / 16\nrelated to different genera, such as LC, MT, LDE, LJ, and CY, than to the same genera, such as NS. In the PCA score plots, NS was strongly separated from the other samples along the PC1 axis (28.2%), and CC and MJ were also separated along the PC2 axis (12.6%), corresponding with the HCA result (Fig 1A). Considering these results together with the HCA results indicates that the close chemical compositions of the nine Lauraceae species were not identical with their genomic closeness. He et al. (2014) [32] similarly observed inconsistencies between the chemical taxonomy and molecular phylogeny of four Coptis species. Wen et al. (2020) [33] also found that the chemical classification of Nardostachys jatamansi collected from different habitats was inconsistent with molecular phylogenetic analysis results. Environmental factors and developmental conditions can affect phytochemical synthesis in planta and the accumulation of metabolic constituents [34]. In nature, plant secondary metabolism pathways elicit an array of plant defensive compounds called secondary metabolites. A secondary metabolite is synthesized in organs or tissues in response to various environmental stimuli, such as light, temperature, soil conditions, and microbiota [35]. Accordingly, the corresponding genes to each plant secondary metabolite are regulated at the transcriptional level by multiple transcription factors and not only by the genetic structure [36]. Therefore, the difference between our chemical and gene taxonomic results can be explained by environmental factors affecting the biosynthesis of metabolic compounds in plants.\nA molecular network was constructed to investigate the complete chemical composition of\nthe nine Lauraceae species. A molecular network is a spectral analysis tool for grouping various compounds by their fragmentation patterns. In GNPS, each MS/MS spectrum is aligned in a dataset, and structurally related molecules are clustered by using the MS-Cluster algorithm [37]. A molecular network of nine Lauraceae species was generated using GNPS and visualized through Cytoscape 3.8.0, an open-source software for visualizing complex networks (Fig 6). A total of 1414 nodes and 73 clusters from the nine samples were detected by the GNPS analysis\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616 September 9, 2022 7 / 16\n(Fig 6): four isoquinoline alkaloid clusters (91 nodes in total), six flavonoid clusters (61 nodes in total), and two lignan clusters (15 nodes in total). The annotated isoquinoline alkaloid and flavonoid clusters (shown as blue and red squares in Fig 6) were composed of the nodes from eight (LJ, NS, MT, CC, CY, NA, MJ, and LC) and nine (LDE, LJ, NS, MT, CC, CY, NA, MJ, and LC) samples, respectively. However, the nodes in the lignan clusters were only detected from MJ, MT, and CC. For the detected isoquinoline alkaloid clusters, the node composition ratio was the highest in NS (32.4%), followed by CC (23.9%) and NA (13.3%), whereas MJ accounted for the lowest ratio at 0.5%. Under our analysis conditions, no isoquinoline alkaloid nodes were detected in the LDE sample (Fig 7A and 7B). Flavonoid nodes were detected for all nine Lauraceae species. MT had the highest ratio of flavonoid nodes at 19.3%, followed by LC (16.4%) and LJ (13.5%). CY accounted for the lowest ratio at 2.9% (Fig 7A and 7B). According to the molecular network results, NS, which was the only sample separated from the others in the chemical dendrogram (Fig 5), has the highest isoquinoline alkaloid contents among the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616 September 9, 2022 8 / 16\nsamples (Fig 6). In addition, CC and MJ, which were grouped into one cluster in the chemical dendrogram (Fig 5), contained most of the lignan compounds detected in the network analysis (Fig 6)."

Prep LC-MS is an effective and highly efficient approach to purify small molecules [38]. Unlike UV-based separation with HPLC, this technique enables selective isolation of specific compounds with exact masses, thereby eliminating the need for additional purification analysis to determine the mass of the isolated compounds [39]. The purified compounds were compared with reported 1H\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616.g004\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616 September 9, 2022 9 / 16\nand 13C NMR and MS data and identified as afzelin (2) [40], catechin (4) [41], chlorogenic acid (6) [42], epicatechin (9) [41], and quercitrin (13) [42] (the NMR data are shown in S3\u2013 S12 Figs in S1 File).\nCompounds 1, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were putatively identified as neochlorogenic acid (1), laur-\nolitsine (3), coclaurine (7), dihydrokaempferol (8), roemerine (11), and phenylalanine (12), respectively, based on a literature search and comparison of MS/MS patterns [43\u201346]. The exact mass, chemical formula, retention time, and MS/MS fragment information of the compounds were obtained from the UPLC-QTOF-MS data using MassHunter software. Neochlorogenic acid (1) was expected to be structurally similar to chlorogenic acid (6) because the mass and MS/MS spectrum were the same as those of 6, except for the retention time (Table 2). According to the data from Kurita et al. (2016) [47], the retention times of neochlorogenic acid (8.11 min) and chlorogenic acid (16.67 min) were clearly different under the respective HPLC analysis conditions, despite having the same mass and chemical formula. According to our analysis, the two compounds were detected at different retention times: Compound 1 (3.42 min) was detected earlier than Compound 6 (5.40 min) (S13 Fig in S1 File). Considering the results together, Compound 1 was putatively identified as neochlorogenic acid (1).\nCompounds 5, 10, and 14 were purified by using prep LC-MS at the beginning; however,\ntheir yields were too low to obtain NMR data. In addition, MS/MS pattern comparison was not possible because the MS/MS fragment information of the compounds could not be obtained through QTOF-LC-MS analysis and there was no match in a chemical database with 5, 10, and 14.\nDNA barcoding and genetic relationship of Lauraceae\nGenomic information of each species was obtained from two universal barcoding regions in the plastid genome, trnH-GUG and rbcL.

Intraspecific diversity due to habitat isolation could have affected the escape of our CY sequence from the CY and CC groups because the published CY sequence was collected in southern China and our CY sequence was collected in Korea. The genetic phylogenetic relationship showed a different topology from that of the chemical-based phylogenetic relationship. A phylogenetic tree based on plastid genome information is widely used for constructing evolutionary relationships\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616.g006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273616 September 9, 2022 11 / 16\nbetween species [48, 49] because of the good converseness of this genetic material across the plant lineage and a high resolution for interspecific diversity. However, secondary metabolites in plants are produced from complex biological pathways that involve multiple genes and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. For example, at least twelve catalyzing steps are needed for the biosynthesis of the ginsenoside backbone, and more enzymes (mainly UDP glycosyltransferase) are required in the branching step to produce approximately 20 kinds of different ginsenosides [50, 51]. Moreover, these genes are usually involved in multiple steps and controlled under precise and systematic regulation [52]. Therefore, metabolite-based relationships can differ even in genetically close species because plant metabolites are not made simply by the translation of genetic information but through communication with the environment via complex and diverse processes."

Multivariate analyses were performed on LC-MS spectral data of the samples to generate PCA and PLS-DA score plots, between which the nine samples were clustered more clearly on the PLS-DA plot. Fourteen important metabolites were selected based on the VIP scores of the PLS-DA model (VIP score> 2.5). The fourteen selected metabolites were also scattered on the PLS-DA loading plot, indicating that these metabolites contributed to discriminating the nine Lauraceae samples. Eleven of the fourteen metabolites were annotated as cinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids, and isoquinoline alkaloids by using prep-MS or MS/MS fragment pattern analysis. In addition, the chemical diversity of the nine samples was analyzed through molecular network analysis, whereby isoquinoline alkaloids, flavonoids, and lignan clusters were assigned as major clusters. Molecular network analysis facilitated interpretation of the grouping patterns in chemical dendrograms, indicating that the chemical differences between NS and the other samples derive from a high isoquinoline alkaloid content, whereas those between the CC and MJ groups derive from a high lignan content.
