    "abstractText": "Direct spread spectrum technology is traditionally used in radio communication systems with multiple access, for example, in CDMA standards, in global satellite navigation systems, in Wi-Fi network wireless protocols, etc. It ensures high security and reliability of information transfer. In addition, spread spectrum technology provides the transmitted signals with a noise-like appearance, thus hiding the semantic content of the messages. We researched this technology for other implementations. The purpose of our study was to investigate new technologies for hiding data in multimedia files. In particular, we investigated the direct spread spectrum in the context of the development of methods for hiding data in audio containers. We considered various spreading sequences (chip codes) and also explored their use for hiding information in audio files. We conducted experimental studies and estimated the bit error rate (BER) in the recovered data. The article also evaluates the distortion of an audio container by the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The results of our research enable us to find out which method of forming chip codes gives a lower BER with equal PSNR. We provide recommendations on the formation of spreading sequences to reliably and safely hide informational messages in audio files.",

            "text": "Various techniques are used to conceal information [1\u20133]. The most common of them are cryptography techniques [4\u20136]. In this case, meaningful messages are converted into meaningless, noise-like forms, i.e., this becomes useless data for an unauthorized user (who does not know the secret cryptographic key). Thus, cryptography hides the semantic content of the transmitted data, whereas the very existence of messages is not hidden [3,7]. Another approach is to use steganographic techniques [3,8]. In this case, informational messages are hidden inside other data (also called containers, covers, carriers, etc.). Carriers can be presented, for example, in the form of various multimedia files (images, video, audio, texts, etc.) [9]. A range of applications exist with multimedia data, so the transfer of video or audio files on the internet does not cause any suspicion. At the same time, only the one who has the secret steganographic key knows that an informational message is hidden in these covers. It is similar to a suitcase with a double bottom; the second bottom is reliably disguised, and it is difficult to detect a hidden message without a secret key. Thus, steganography hides the fact that messages exist [2,8].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093115 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 2 of 23\nThe present paper discusses steganographic information hiding techniques in which audio files act as multimedia containers. Hiding data in audio has great prospects. Firstly, such data are significantly popular on the internet. For example, we can use audio messages in messengers and social networks as covers. At the same time, the amount of hidden data can be quite large. In addition, there is a problem with copyright protection of audio content on the internet. Hiding digital watermarks (with a copyright label) in audio containers can be an effective solution. Thus, hiding data in audio is really very relevant and may have a commercial implementation. In our experiments, we used the simplest audio signals recorded in the digital WAV format [10,11]. However, all our results and suggestions can be interpreted for a more general case with other audio container formats. In order to conceal information, this work employs a special technology traditionally used in radio communication systems [12\u201315]. This is a direct spreading of the spectrum [16], which implements wideband modulation with pseudo-random sequences (chip codes) [17]. The correlation properties of chip codes guarantee the absence of mutual interference in the communication channel [18]. As a result, the radio communication system acquires numerous useful properties: noise immunity, high bandwidth and subscriber capacity, absence of mutual interference, environmental friendliness of communication, and many others [19]. Direct spread spectrum technology is implemented in many industry standards and applications, for example:\n\u2022 Code division multiple access communication systems (IS-95, CDMA2000, WCDMA, DS-CDMA, TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, etc.); \u2022 Global satellite navigation systems (American GPS, European Galileo, and Russian GLONASS); \u2022 Family of wireless network protocols Wi-Fi (family of standards IEEE 802.11), and much more.\nDirect spread spectrum technology can also be used in steganography [20\u201322]. In particular, in one of the first works [21] in this area, it was proposed to interpret the carrier as noise in the communication channel. In this case, the task of hiding information in multimedia files is equivalent to transmitting useful signals over communication channels with natural additive noise. Currently, a large number of studies on steganography and the direct spreading of the spectrum have already been conducted. Various researchers studied this issue in relation to various computer applications. It turns out that the main characteristics of reliability and safety depend on the properties of the spreading sequences. In particular, in [23,24], we investigated various ways of generating chip codes in relation to cover images. In this paper, we continue these studies in relation to another type of multimedia data\u2014audio carriers. We studied the basic characteristics of an audio stegosystem for various spreading sequences. In our experiments, we estimate the bit error rate (BER) of hidden information data. This is the most important indicator of the quality of recovered messages. In addition, we evaluated the distortions of the audio container, which characterize the quality of multimedia data after hiding information messages in them. Therefore, we used the mean squared error (MSE) and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In this article, we demonstrated that the variety of ways of generating chip codes have different results for BER, MSE, and PSNR. It becomes an area for possible optimization, as the choice of the method of forming the spreading sequences is very important for various computer applications. Thus, the main goal of our work is to find the best chip codes that would minimize the BER for comparable PSNR."

            "text": "Hiding data in audio was investigated in many related papers, e.g., in papers [25\u201329], the simplest LSB techniques were studied, which, nevertheless, have some advantages. By encoding the LSB of the container, you can hide a very large amount of data. However, LSB\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 3 of 23\ntechniques are also easily detected, and this is their main drawback. Various authors tried to improve LSB. In [26], the authors used augmentation operations to increase resistance to attacks. In [25], the LSB method was applied to the coefficients of the discrete wavelet transform. In [27], an LSB was proposed with an adaptive number of hiding bits for each audio sample (depending on the size of the hidden data, the size of the covering carrier, and the signal-to-noise ratio). In [28], binary data values were hidden in different places to increase security. In [29], the LSB technique was supplemented with data encryption. There are many other works in this area; however, each improvement of the LSB method leads, as a rule, to a decrease in the volume of hidden data [30,31]. Other approaches to hiding data in audio use various techniques: in [32], Cochlear Delay Characteristics were used to hide data; in [33], authors investigated bit reduction techniques; in [34\u201336], echo signals were used; in [37\u201339], data were hidden in the phases of audio signals. All these techniques have their advantages and disadvantages [31]. In particular, the amount of hidden data is significantly less than in LSB methods. However, the security of the hidden data is higher. One of the prospective methods is steganography with direct spectrum expansion. These techniques combine high throughput and data security. The first works [20,21,40] were devoted to the substantiation of the general concepts and structure of the steganosystem using a direct spread spectrum. Images were used to hide the messages. Already in those articles, the authors noted several conflicting requirements [41]. In particular, increasing the size of messages leads to increasing the corruption of containers; small BER values can be achieved only with a large \u201cenergy\u201d of the embedded message, which significantly distorts the container. In order to eliminate some of these contradictions, the authors suggested using special filtering and correcting codes [41]. These and other ideas were developed in subsequent works. For example, in [42], correction codes were investigated; in [43,44], a discrete cosine transform (DCT) was implemented together with the direct spreading of the spectrum, etc. Papers [45,46] are devoted to the study of chaos. In works [47,48], hiding information in video data was studied, and in [42,49], audio signals were used for hiding information. Indeed, hiding messages in audio signals is a promising direction [50]; these methods can be used, for example, to protect the property rights of digital audio signals [51]. Note that in these numerous works, the properties of spreading sequences (chip codes) were almost not explored. The exceptions are our two recent works [23,24], in which we analyzed various methods of forming spreading sequences, as well as their influence on the characteristics of Spread Spectrum Image Steganography. In this work, we continued our research and expanded their field to audio files. First, we looked at different ways to form spreading sequences and explored BER, MSE, and PSNR. Then, we explored possible compromises, such as how to minimize carrier distortion with low bit error rates. It turned out that the Walsh\u2013Hadamard expansion sequences were best suited for this, and our experiments clearly demonstrated this."

From Equation (1), we see that at low SNRs, the throughput can be increased only by expanding the frequency band, and direct spread spectrum technology is well suited for this. Indeed, using very long spreading sequences, even at a very low SNR value, high-speed information transmission can be realized. This circumstance can also be used, e.g., to build environmentally friendliness of communication systems, i.e., when PS \u2248 PN . Then, using spreading sequences with a bit length 108 or more, it is possible to realize information transfer at rates of tens and hundreds of Mb/s. Let us explain the technology of spreading the spectrum with a direct sequence in the following simple way.\nConsider a set s = (s1, s2, . . . , sk) of pseudo-random bit sequences (vectors):\ns1 = (s1,0, s1,1, . . . , s1,n\u22121), s2 = (s2,0, s2,1, . . . , s2,n\u22121), . . . , sk = (sk,0, sk,1, . . . , sk,n\u22121),\nrepresented, for example, in polar form, i.e.,\n\u2200i, j : si,j = {\n1, \u22121.\nVectors are designed to spread the spectrum of the original message, so they are called chip codes or chipping codes. Each value si,j is called a chip or sequence element.\nThe vectors s1, s2, . . . , sk \u2208 s are formed so that their cross-correlation is negligible, i.e.,\n\u2200i 6= j : \u03c1(si, sj) = n\u22121 \u2211 v=0 si,vsj,v \u2248 0 (2)\nFor example, if the vectors s1, s2, . . . , sk are taken equal to the rows (or columns) of the Hadamard matrix, we obtain orthogonal chip codes, i.e.,\n\u2200i 6= j : \u03c1(si, sj) = 0\nThere are other ways to generate chip codes, for example, when the elements si,j take a random value over an interval [\u22121, 1]. However, condition (2) for the generation of spreading sequences is decisive. Suppose the message is made up of k bits, i.e., m1, m2, . . . , mk, e.g., let us write the information bits mi, i = 1, 2, . . . , k also in polar form, i.e.,\n\u2200i : mi = {\n1, \u22121.\nModulation of the information bits mi, i = 1, 2, . . . , k can be achieved in different ways, e.g., with polar notation according to the expression:\n\u2200i : Mi = misi = (misi,0, misi,1, . . . , misi,n\u22121) (3)\nIn this way, instead of one binary element, mi a vector (sequence) Mi of binary elements n, is transmitted.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 5 of 23\nLet us assume that the durations of an element mi and its extended chip version Mi are the same. Suppose, for example, that they are equal to T seconds. Then the duration of one chip si,j will be n times less: Tchip = Tn . Therefore, the chips are transmitted at a frequency\nFchip = 1\nTchip = n T Hertz.\nThis frequency is n times greater than the frequency of information bits F = 1T . Thus, we obtained the spread of the frequency of the original message by n times. The multiplying of the signal duration by its frequency is called the base B. If B > 1, then the signals are called complex.\nFor our case, we have B = TchipFchip = n > 1\nand direct spreading signals are complex signals. Several information bits can be simultaneously transmitted to the communication channel, i.e., the receiver obtains an additive mixture:\nMix = N + k\n\u2211 j=1 Mj (4)\nwhere the symbol N denotes the sequence of random elements caused by noise (for example, additive white Gaussian noise). The receiver has synchronized copies of the chip codes s1, s2, . . . , sk \u2208 s. In order to restore the information bits, it is necessary to calculate the correlation between the received signal and the corresponding chip codes. For example, to restore the value mi in (3), the receiver computes \u03c1(si, Mix).

Direct Spread Spectrum in Steganography Direct spread spectrum technology has long been used in steganography. In the first works [20,21,40], a general scheme of a steganosystem with the direct spreading of the spectrum was proposed. The authors used cover images, but all their reasoning can be extended to other multimedia data.\nThe general idea of such a stegosystem is as follows (Figure 1).\nIn order to hide the data, the following steps are performed:\nStep 1 The information message is presented in polar form mi; Step 2 mi multiplied bit by bit by the spreading sequence as in (3); Step 3 Multimedia data (images, audio, video, etc.) are interpreted as noise in the communication channel. Using our notation, this is N in (4). Step 4 Further, these data are hidden in the cover data according to rule (4). However, we\ncurrently denote:\n1. N\u2014multimedia data (container, cover), inside which the message is hidden; 2. Mix\u2014modified multimedia data (filled container) after hiding messages in them.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 7 of 23\nIn order to restore the data, the following steps are performed:\nStep 1 Correlation is calculated.\n- The product is calculated si Mix; - The sum is calculated \u03c1(si, Mix) = n\u22121 \u2211\nv=0 si,v Mixv;\nStep 2 If Equations (6) and (7) are true, then the value of the recovered bit is calculated by the Equation (8). Step 3 The recovered message is presented in a custom view.\nIt should be noted that even in the first works, the authors encountered significant difficulties. For example, in [53] was shown that the error rate in the extracted messages is very high (see, for example, Table 2 on page 12 of [53]). BER can be reduced in different ways, for example, by using filtering, correction codes, etc. The simplest is to increase the power of chip codes. For this, Equation (4) can be rewritten as\nMix = N + P k\n\u2211 j=1\nMj = N + k\n\u2211 j=1 mj(Psj) (9)\nwhere the value P specifies the power amplification factor of the chip codes sj = (sj,0, sj,1, . . . , sj,n\u22121). By increasing the power, P, it is actually possible to achieve a decrease in BER. However, this inevitably leads to distortion of the container N. For example, for k = 10 and P = 10, each value of the cover file N may be skewed by \u00b1kP = 100. This may present a real problem because BER is still high. For example, in [53], it is shown that even with P = 100 an error rate is more than 10% (see Table 2 from [53]). We carried out detailed studies of this problem in [23,24]. In particular, we repeated the experiments with images from [21,40,53,54]. We studied the effect of different ways of forming spreading sequences on the BER value. The general conclusions about the high BER were confirmed, and the explanation for this phenomenon is, in our opinion, the following. The first term in (4) presents a certain implementation of random additive white noise N. This is indeed the case for spread spectrum communications systems. Those assumption (6) is fulfilled, which gives an almost error-free recovery of the message according to rule (8). However, in the stagnosystem, in (4), multimedia data are meant. This is usually highly redundant, highly correlated data. This is not a random realization of Gaussian noise, and assumption (6) is often not met. Obviously, this leads to errors in the recovered bits according to rule (8). In works [55,56], an effective way to combat this phenomenon was proposed. We proposed to form chip sequences in a special, adaptive way. Indeed, if we take into account the statistical properties of multimedia data (in [55,56], we used cover images), then it is possible to form chip codes s1, s2, . . . , sk, in such a way that condition (6) is guaranteed to be satisfied. In this case, it is possible to ensure an almost error-free extraction of information messages according to rule (8). In this article, we continued our experiments. We used audio covers and experimented with different ways to generate chip codes. We showed that the variety of ways of generating spreading sequences produces different BER values. This is an area for possible optimization of the stegosystem, and we showed which chip codes are really best used to hide information messages in audio containers."

            "text": "In this article, various methods for generating chip codes were considered, and their influence on the characteristics of a steganosystem was studied. Specifically, we explored five different ways to generate spreading sequences.\n1. Spread sequences from [21,40]\nIn the basic works [21,40] on Spread Spectrum Steganography, a nonlinear rule for the formation of chip codes s = (s1, s2, . . . , sk) was used. In particular, each chip si,j was formed as a realization of a random variable distributed according to the standard normal law.\nFor this, the rule was proposed:\nsi,j = { \u03a6\u22121(ui,j), mi = \u22121; \u03a6\u22121(u\u2032i,j), mi = 1,\n(10)\nwhere\nu\u2032i,j = {\nui,j + 0.5, ui < 0.5; ui,j \u2212 0.5, ui \u2265 0.5,\n\u2022 ui,j\u2014implementation of a random variable uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 1]; \u2022 \u03a6\u22121\u2014inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard Gaussian random variable.\nIn our experiments, we used chip codes of length n = 1024 generated according to rule (10). Spreading sequences with a Gaussian chip distribution (10) were also studied by us earlier in relation to cover images in [23,24]. We are expanding our research to the case of audio containers now.\n2. Chip codes from random numbers uniformly distributed over the interval [\u22121, 1] We also implemented the formation of spreading sequences of length n = 1024 from random numbers uniformly distributed over the interval [\u22121, 1]. Each chip si,j is formed randomly with equal probability and independently of other values.\n3. Chip codes from normally distributed random numbers\nThis method of forming spreading sequences of length n = 1024 consists in generating normally distributed random numbers. In fact, the second and third methods are very similar. Each chip si,j is randomly formed. The second method uses a uniform distribution on the interval [\u22121, 1], and the third one uses a standard normal distribution. The third method is also similar to the first, but the rule for generating chip codes is somewhat different.\n4. Binary chip codes generated by a pseudo-random bit generator\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 9 of 23\nThe simplest, in our opinion, is the formation of individual chips using a pseudorandom bit generator. We converted the generated bits to polar form and formed spreading sequences of length n = 1024.\n5. Walsh\u2013Hadamard spreading sequences\nThese are discrete sequences of length n = 2w, w = 1, 2, . . ., which can be formed as rows (or columns) of the Hadamard matrix Hn of order n = 2w:\nH2w = [\nH2w\u22121 H2w\u22121 H2w\u22121 \u2212H2w\u22121\n] , H1 = [1]. (11)\nFor example, for n = 4, we have four chip codes:\ns1 = (1, 1, 1, 1), s2 = (1,\u22121, 1,\u22121), s3 = (1, 1,\u22121,\u22121), s4 = (1,\u22121,\u22121, 1).\nIn our experiments, we used spreading sequences with a length of n = 210 = 1024. Therefore, we recursively generated H1024 according to rule (11) and formed s = (s1, s2, . . . , sk=1024) as a set of strings H1024.\nThe Walsh\u2013Hadamard sequences form an orthogonal system, i.e.,\n\u2200i 6= j : \u03c1(si, sj) = 0\nwhich is in good agreement with (2). Nevertheless, the main disadvantage of such chip codes should be pointed out. The number of different orthogonal sequences of length n cannot exceed n. Therefore, to hide a large number of bits in the same container, this generation method may not be sufficient."

Therefore, we experimentally estimated the bit error rate (BER) in recovered messages. We also estimated audio cover distortions by mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR). We did not use other indicators of distortion of the audio cover (for example, percentage residual deviation, autocorrelation analysis of stegodata with original data, etc.), as this can be obtained after processing our results.\nThese are the most common metrics used in many related works.\n1. Bit Error Rate, BER\nThe bit error rate is calculated using the equation:\nBER = kerror\nk (12)\nwhere kerror is the number of erroneously recovered bits, k is the total number of bits in the information message.\n2. Mean squared error, MSE\nIn order to estimate the container distortion, the root mean square error (MSE) is used, i.e., the averaged square of the difference between the original multimedia data and the cover data obtained after the message was hidden. For an audio signal represented by a set of n discrete samples, MSE is calculated by the equation:\nMSE = 1 n n\u22121 \u2211 i=0 [Mixi \u2212 Ni]2 (13)\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 10 of 23\n3. Peak signal-to-noise ratio, PSNR\nA more visual characteristic of cover distortion is the ratio of the maximum possible signal power to the power of the distorting noise. Usually, this characteristic is expressed on a logarithmic scale and calculated by the equation:\nPSNR = 10 \u00b7 log10 ( N2max MSE ) = 20 \u00b7 log10 ( Nmax\u221a\nMSE\n) =\n= 20 \u00b7 log10(Nmax)\u2212 10 \u00b7 log10(MSE), (14)\nwhere Nmax is the maximum possible value of the signal N. In our case, by N we mean multimedia data, i.e., an audio signal represented by a set of discrete samples. If each discrete sample is coded in B bits, then (in linear pulse code modulation, PCM) the maximum possible value of Nmax = 2B \u2212 1. In our experiments, we used the simplest audio signals with B = 8, i.e., Nmax = 255. Equation (14) for this value takes the form:\nPSNR = 20 \u00b7 log10(255)\u2212 10 \u00b7 log10(MSE)."

Discussion The analysis of the data shown in Figures 2\u201317 results enables us to draw the following conclusions. First, it is difficult to implement information hiding without significant container distortion. The above dependences of ( )BER PSNR clearly demonstrate this. By increasing the volume of the hidden message k and/or the power amplification factor P , we certainly distort the container, i.e., decrease PSNR. For example, chip codes \u21161 and \u21162 allow hiding only 1\u20132 bits of the message when 30 dBPSNR > and 10%BER< . Spreading sequences \u21163 and \u21164 are somewhat better; they make it possible to hide 1\u20132 message bits when 35 dBPSNR > and 10%BER< . However, this is still not enough. Finally, the Walsh\u2013Hadamard signals perform well. If they are used, it is possible to hide 16 or more message bits and provide 30 dBPSNR > and 1%BER< . This confirms the earlier conclusion about the preference of such chip codes for hiding information. This is also consistent with our findings from Spread Spectrum Image Steganography [23,24]. The second conclusion is a possible trade-off between the amount of hidden data and the introduced distortion of the audio container. For example, as follows from Figure 17, halving the k value leads to an increase in PSNR by about 5 dB. This can be used to configure the desired stegosystem parameters in a specific practical application. The third and probably the most important conclusion is that it is almost impossible to achieve high volumes of hidden information with the known techniques. For example, even for the best case shown in Figure 17, with 35 dBPSNR = and 1%BER< , only\n16k \u2264 bits of information can be hidden. It is possible to improve these values by traditional techniques only by increasing the length of the chip codes, which inevitably leads to an increase in the computational complexity of the transformations. This could, however, become a problem. Indeed, to restore each closed beta according to rule (8), it is\nFigure 17.

            "text": "The analysis of the data shown in Figures 2\u201317 results enables us to draw the following conclusions. First, it is difficult to implement information hiding without significant container distortion. The above dependences of BER(PSNR) clearly demonstrate this. By increasing the volume of the hidden message k and/or the power amplification factor P, we certainly distort the container, i.e., decrease PSNR. For example, chip codes \u21161 and \u21162 allow hiding only 1\u20132 bits of the message when PSNR > 30 dB and BER < 10%. Spreading sequences \u21163 and \u21164 are somewhat better; they make it possible to hide 1\u20132 message bits when PSNR > 35 dB and BER < 10%. However, this is still not enough. Finally, the Walsh\u2013 Hadamard signals perform well. If they are used, it is possible to hide 16 or more message bits and provide PSNR > 30 dB and BER < 1%.

It is possible to improve these values by traditional techniques only by increasing the length of the chip codes, which inevitably leads to an increase in the computational complexity of the transformations. This could, however, become a problem. Indeed, to restore each closed beta according to rule (8), it is necessary to calculate the correlation according to Equation (5). Therefore, you need to perform n additions and n multiplications, where n is the length of the chip codes. Our experiments correspond to the case of n = 1024, and we had a performance comparable to other modern data hiding techniques. However, as n increases, performance decreases, which can significantly complicate practical implementation. Another way is the implementation of adaptive techniques, for example, as in [55,56], or the use of new, advanced methods of hiding information, for example, based on addressing chip codes [58]. These and other methods are a promising direction for our further research."

            "text": "In the present paper, we explored techniques for hiding information in audio containers using a direct spread spectrum. We considered various spreading sequences (chip codes) and studied their influence on the error rate in recovered messages. We also investigated the distortion of the audio container in terms of MSE and PSNR. The results clearly demonstrate the promising characteristics of this direction. Precisely, in each segment of the container, we managed to hide a part of the information message reliably. At the same time, the BER, MSE, and PSNR values are within an acceptable range. The best characteristics were shown by Walsh\u2013Hadamard chip codes, which showed the lowest error rate (with comparable container distortions). At the same time, it should be noted that there exist objectively conflicting factors that negatively affect one another. For example, by increasing the volume of hidden messages, we inevitably increase the BER and distort the container. By increasing the power of the chip codes, it is possible to reduce the BER. However, this distorts the container even more. This is consistent with known results in steganography based on direct spectrum expansion. For example, in [41,53], it is shown that by increasing the power of chip codes, it is really possible to reduce BER, but the distortion of the covers becomes very significant. We managed to present the availability of compromise solutions. This is especially true for Walsh\u2013Hadamard chip codes, for which the range of possible solutions is much wider than\nSensors 2022, 22, 3115 21 of 23\nfor other spreading sequences. Nevertheless, it should be noted that when using traditional data hiding techniques, the volume of hidden messages cannot be large. The search for new ways of hiding information is promising, e.g., based on the adaptive formation of spreading sequences [56], advanced techniques for addressing chip codes [58], etc.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and methodology, A.K.; software and validation, A.O. and T.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, O.P. and R.Z.; visualization, K.W.
