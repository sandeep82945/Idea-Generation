    "abstractText": "We construct meronic black holes and solitons in the Einstein SU(N)-Yang-Mills theory in D = 4 and D = 5 dimensions. These analytical solutions are found by combining the generalized hedgehog ansatz with the Euler parameterization of the SU(N) group from which the Yang-Mills equations are automatically satisfied for all values of N while the Einstein equations can be solved analytically. We explicitly show the role that the color number N plays in the black hole thermodynamics as well as in the gravitational spin from isospin effect. Two remarkable results of our analysis are that, first, meronic black holes can be distinguished by colored black holes by looking at the spin from isospin effect (which is absent in the latter but present in the former). Second, using the theory of non-embedded ansatz for SU(N) together with the spin from isospin effect, one can build fields of arbitrary high spin out of scalar fields charged under the gauge group. Hence, one can analyze interacting higher spin fields in asymptotically flat space-times without \u201cintroducing by hand\u201d higher spin fields. Our analysis also discloses an interesting difference between the spin from isospin effect in D = 4 and in D = 5.",

            "text": "Yang-Mills (YM) theory is one of the main ingredients of the standard model which up to now has been phenomenologically extremely successful. Since the main open problems in high energy physics such as color confinement are non-perturbative in nature, it is of great interest to analyze topologically non-trivial configurations of the YM theory which are believed to play a fundamental role in the non-perturbative phase of the theory (see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and references therein). A very interesting class of configurations that play an important role in the non-perturbative phase of the YM theory are the so-called merons1 introduced in [15]. One of the characteristics of merons is that they can always be brought in the form A = \u03bbA\u0303, where A\u0303 is a pure gauge field. Since such an ansatz would be trivial in Abelian gauge theories, merons are genuine nonAbelian configurations. It is known that merons connect different topological sectors of the theory and these are related to instantons [16, 17, 18, 19]. Also, lattice studies show that, as far as confinement is concerned, merons play a very important role, as can be seen in [16, 17, 18]. The existence of merons can be traced back to the appearance of Gribov copies [20] as merons can be interpreted as tunneling events between different Gribov vacua [21].\n1Although the name \u201cmeron\u201d is generally used to describe Euclidean solutions, in this work we will call merons\nto configurations with \u03bb = 1/2 in Lorentzian space-time, which we will show in the following sections.\nHowever, most of the studies of merons up to now (with the exception of [22]) have been devoted to the SU(2) symmetry group case. In the present case we will focus on the SU(N)-YM theory (for arbitrary values of N) minimally coupled to general relativity (GR). We will be interested in genuine SU(N) configurations: namely, configurations that are not trivial embedding of SU(2) into SU(N). This technical detail will be especially relevant in the analysis of the physical effects of non-embedded gravitating merons.2 The great importance to carefully analyze the coupling of GR with YM theory arises (at the very least) from two considerations. First of all, there are situations of high physical interest (such as close to black holes and neutron stars or in cosmology) in which the coupling of YM theory with GR cannot be neglected. Moreover, the coupling of topologically non-trivial configurations in YM theory with GR can be even useful to regularize them. For instance, merons, which on flat space-times are singular, when coupled to GR can become regular (see, for instance, [25, 26, 27, 28] and references therein). Many of the results in Einstein-YM are numerical [29, 30, 31, 32, 33], and these solutions have been derived in the case of the SU(2) gauge group. In the Einstein SU(2)-YM system rigorous results are also known [34] (in-depth analysis of the SU(N) case can be found in Refs. [35, 36, 37]). In the present paper we will construct explicit analytic examples of non-embedded gravitating merons in the Einstein SU(N)-YM theory for arbitrary values of N . However, the main result of the paper is not the construction of the analytic solutions in itself3 but rather the non-trivial physical effects which can be made manifest only with a careful group-theoretical analysis. The solutions that we will construct below disclose peculiar characteristics of the SU(N) gauge group [which are absent in the SU(2) case] as well as the quite non-trivial differences between the cases in D = 4 and D = 5 dimensions. One of the interesting features will arise from the analysis of the spin-from-isospin effect [38, 39, 40], comparing the new configurations with N > 2 with the usual N = 2 case. A similar question about \u201cgenuine SU(N) configurations with N \u2265 3\u201d in the low energy limit of QCD (which is described by the Skyrme model [41]) was answered in the seminal works [23, 24], and recently in [42, 43, 44]. In Refs. [23, 24], the first numerical example of a non-embedded solution representing a dibaryon (a bound state of two baryons) was constructed in the SU(3)Skyrme model [this numerical construction of non-embedded configurations was extended to the SU(N)-Skyrme model in [45]]. Time after, in [43], combining the Balachandran ansatz and the generalized hedgehog ansatz with some known results on the Euler angles for SU(3) [46, 47, 48], the first analytical solutions with high topological charge that describe gravitating dibaryons as well as dibaryons in flat space-time at finite density were constructed in the Einstein SU(3)Skyrme model [43]. These dibaryons are genuine SU(3) features in the sense that they are not\n2Here it is worth to emphasize that the term \u201cnon-embedded\u201d, which will be adopted here, is very common in the literature on the Skyrme model after the pioneering papers [23, 24], where the authors constructed the first numerical examples of genuine SU(3) configurations in the Skyrme model [which are not trivial embeddings of SU(2) solutions into SU(3)]. 3Although in a different form and with different ansatz, spherical black holes in Einstein SU(N)-YM theory have been already discussed in the literature (see [37] and references therein).\ntrivial embeddings of SU(2) in SU(3). Finally, very recently, the generalized hedgehog ansatz has been combined with the Euler parameterization of the SU(N) group describing the so-called nuclear pasta phases at finite density in the SU(N)-Skyrme model [42, 44]. These solutions are genuine SU(N), due to the image of SU(2) through the Euler ansatz construction is just a submanifold but not a subgroup of SU(N), as we will show below. In this sense the map is not an embedding of SU(2) into SU(N) but just of S3 into SU(N) [49]. In the present paper, the ansatz proposed in [42] for the SU(N)-Skyrme model will be adapted to the Einstein SU(N)-YM case in order to construct analytical solutions describing non-embedded meronic black holes (BHs). It is important to highlight that, recently, this ansatz [considering \u03bb = \u03bb(r)] has allowed the construction of analytical solutions describing inhomogeneous condensates in the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in (2 + 1) dimensions [50] as well as in (3 + 1) dimensions [51]. The present analysis has three quite non-trivial outcomes. First, one can tell apart merons BHs from colored BHs using the spin from isospin effect: while an asymptotically flat meron BH changes the spin of a scalar test field, a colored black hole does not. This is a very intriguing way to distinguish a colored BH from a meron BH. Second, using the technology of non-embedded ansatz in SU(N), one can generate test fields with arbitrary high spin. This is a really powerful result since it allows us to study the dynamics of higher spin fields without introducing any explicit higher spin field but, actually, just analyzing the dynamics of a self-interacting scalar field (charged under the gauge group) living in asymptotically flat SU(N) non-embedded meron BHs (with large enough N). It is worthwhile to remind the reader here of the severe technical problems which are encountered when analyzing the interactions of higher spin fields related to the Coleman-Mandula theorem and its generalizations (see [52, 53, 54, 55, 56]) \u201cpreventing\u201d a non-trivial interacting S-matrix in a flat space for particles with high enough spins.4. In this respect, it is worth to note that there is a class of Higher Spins (HS henceforth) theories in flat space called Chiral HS which has been constructed in [57]. The advantage of Chiral HS theories is that, at least at one-loop, they avoid the no-go theorems mentioned above (see [58] [59]). This approach is based on [60] [61]. The present approach provides with a valid and sound alternative to the analysis of higher spin interactions in (asymptotically) flat space-times: one can just consider a four-dimensional renormalizable scalar field theory for a Higgs field (which, consequently, has quartic vertices) charged under the SU(N) gauge group and living in the background of a non-embedded SU(N) (gravitating) meron. In the asymptotic region, due to the presence of the non-embedded meron BH, the scalar field becomes a higher spin field. Hence, the present construction allows us to study interacting higher spin fields in asymptotically flat space-times. A further byproduct of our framework is that the structure of the spin from isospin effect in D = 4 is slightly different from the one in D = 5 dimensions. The reasons behind this difference will also be discussed. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we give a brief review of the Einstein SU(N)-YM theory and we present the ansatz that allows us to construct analytical solutions. In Sec. III we construct BH solutions in D = 4, and we study the spin from isospin effect and how higher\n4We will mention the relations of the present approach with recent developments in higher spin field theory in\nthe next sections.\nspin fields can be generated. In Sec. IV we construct BH solutions in D = 5 and we compare its characteristics with those of the D = 4 case. In Sec. V, using a similar ansatz, we found an analytic gravitating soliton solution. Sec. VI is devoted to the conclusions and perspectives.\n2 The Einstein SU(N)-Yang-Mills theory\nIn this section we make a brief review of the Einstein SU(N)-Yang-Mills theory and also we introduce the general ansatz that allows us to construct analytical solutions."

It is well known that there are many ways of embedding SU(2) into SU(N).

We choose what is sometimes called the \u201cmaximal\u201d embedding, which is the only one which gives rise to a irreducible representation of SU(2) of spin j = (N \u2212 1)/2 (in agreement with the nomenclature in the Skyrme literature,\nwe will call these configurations \u201cnon-embedded\u201d).

(2.11)\nIt is worthwhile to emphasize that the above generators are an irreducible representation of SU(2), which is not true for all embbedings [46, 47, 48]. In the case of SU(3), for instance, one may take one half of the first three Gell-Mann matrices as generators of SU(2), which form a spin 1/2 representation of SU(2). However, it is not irreducible, because its three 3\u00d73 matrices have zeros everywhere except for their 2\u00d7 2 first blocks, where the spin matrices are embedded. The above Ta matrices, on the contrary, form the spin-j irreducible representation of SU(2), with j = (N \u2212 1)/2. This may be seen directly from the diagonal element (2.9), or by noting that\n(\u2212\u2192 T )2 = 3\u2211\na=1\nTaTa = \u03c3 (N)1 , (2.12)\n\u03c3 (N) = (N2 \u2212 1)\n4 = j(j + 1) . (2.13)\nPicking the irreducible representation of SU(2) for all values of N implies that for every N we are using a representation with different spin. This means that (\u2212\u2192 T )2 (which will play an\nimportant role to define the \u201csquare of the total angular momentum operator\u201d) depends on N . One can see that \u03c3(N) grows with N2 so that, for the irreducible embedding ansatz presented here, the total angular momentum will also grow with N (as it will be discussed in the next sections)."

Therefore the existence of merons is an intrinsically non-Abelian feature. The first example on flat space-time was constructed by de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan in Ref. [15], and it has \u03bb = 1/2. Although, in principle, \u03bb could take any value different from zero and one, here we will show that even in the case of the SU(N) gravitating meron \u03bb = 1/2 is indeed a special value.

In particular, it has been shown that the asymptotically flat case is a very interesting arena to implement the usual spin from isospin effect without worrying about the singularities associated to the meron (which are hidden behind the BH horizon). In the present paper, we will ask the following questions:\n1. Is the Einstein SU(N)-YM case physically different from the already known SU(2) case?\n2. Are there genuine SU(N) configurations which are absent in the SU(M) case withM < N?\n3. Which are the physical effects associated to these genuine SU(N) configurations?\nThe above interesting questions can be answered in a very elegant way combining the group theoretical tools developed in Refs.

(3.1)\n5It is interesting to note that in [63] the authors constructed the first example of a SU(2) meron black hole. However, the concept of meron was invented after such black hole was constructed. That is why the authors of [63] do not mention the connection with merons. 6Using a strategy developed originally to analyze the Skyrme model (see [44, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]).\nThe meron in Eq. (2.5) that satisfies identically the complete set of YM equations in Eq. (2.2) is given by\nF1(x \u00b5) = \u2212\u03c6 , F2(x\u00b5) = 2\u03b8 , F3(x\u00b5) = \u03c6 , (3.2)\ntogether with the particular value of \u03bb mentioned above,\n\u03bb = 1\n2 . (3.3)\nFrom the Einstein equations in Eq. (2.3), we obtain for the metric function f(r) the following expression\nf(r) = 1\u2212 2m r \u2212 \u039b 3 r2 + 8\u03bb2(\u03bb\u2212 1)2\u03ba e2r2 (N \u2212 1)N(N + 1) 6\n(3.4)\n= 1\u2212 2m r \u2212 \u039b 3 r2 + \u03ba 2e2r2 TN ,\nwith TN = (N\u22121)N(N+1)\n6 as the Tetrahedral numbers for N = 2, 3, ...\nIt turns out that the meron in this case is just the Wu-Yang monopole, whose singularity is dressed under the BH horizon. In fact,\nAi = \u2212 1 r2 \u01ebijaxjTa , (3.5)\nwhere, (x1, x2, x3) = r(sin \u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos \u03b8). The above solution has exactly the same form as the one in Minkowski space-time, but be aware that the xi are only asymptotically the Cartesian coordinates of flat space. It is a straightforward computation to check that twice the Wu-Yang monopole field in Eq. (3.5) gives vanishing field strenght, that is, as pure gauge as expected for a meron with \u03bb = 1/2. Now, if one performs a gauge transformation using a group element of the form (2.6), with\nF1(x \u00b5) = \u2212\u03c6 , F2(x\u00b5) = \u2212\u03b8 , F3(x\u00b5) = \u03c6 , (3.6)\nthen the YM potential transforms to the \u201cDirac gauge\u201d\nA = (1\u2212 cos \u03b8)d\u03c6T3 . (3.7)\nThis potential has a Dirac string singularity at \u03b8 = 0, and the field strength is given by\nF\u00b5\u03bd = f\u00b5\u03bdT3 ,\nwhere f\u00b5\u03bd is the field of the Dirac monopole, with f\u03b8\u03c6 = sin \u03b8, the only non-vanishing component. The field is effectively Abelian, and its contribution to the action in Eq. (2.1) is\n1\n2e2\n\u222b d4x \u221a\u2212gf\u00b5\u03bdf\u00b5\u03bdTr[T 23 ] = N(N2 \u2212 1)\n24e2\n\u222b d4x \u221a\u2212gf\u00b5\u03bdf\u00b5\u03bd ,\nwhere we have used Eq. (2.11). This means that, in fact, the effective coupling constant Q is given by\nQ2 = 12e2\nN(N2 \u2212 1) . (3.8)\nThe resulting metric is precisely the Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m metric in (anti-)de Sitter space-time with unitary magnetic charge,\ng = 1\nQ = N(N2 \u2212 1) 12e2 . (3.9)\nNote that the monopole in the Dirac gauge is not of the form (2.14). Its double is not pure gauge. Actually, it may be multiplied by any constant to get a monopole solution with any magnetic charge. However, if the magnetic charge is not unitary, then we will not be able to perform a gauge transformation that takes it to the Wu-Yang form, that is, it will not be a meron anymore. Indeed, the gauge transformation from the meronic configuration to the Abelian Dirac monopole is singular at the origin (see the discussion on pages 13 and 14 of [83]). Since two gauge potentials are gauge equivalent if and only if there is a proper gauge transformation (namely, a smooth gauge transformation which is also well behaved at infinity7) from one configuration to the other, one can conclude that the present meronic configuration and the Dirac monopole are not gauge equivalent. Note also that if one would not define gauge equivalence using proper gauge transformations one would arrive at absurd conclusions such as that the (anti-)de Sitter space-time in (2 + 1) dimensions is the same as the Ban\u0303ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole (as these two configurations are connected by an improper gauge transformation). Even though the above solution is well known, there is an interesting feature arising from the dependence of the effective charge g with N as seen in Eq. (3.9). If the cosmological constant \u039b is positive, then for a horizon to exist the magnetic (or electric) charge must satisfy g2 < (4\u039b)\u22121. Therefore, these merons cease to exist for big enough N . There are also bound for the mass. If the cosmological constant vanishes, for instance, then for a horizon to dress the singularity the mass must be such that M2 > g2. Therefore, as N grows, the mass of the merons are forced to grow as well. Obviously, spherically symmetric BHs in the Einstein SU(N)-YM theory have been already discussed in depth in the literature (see, for instance, [35, 36, 37, 85, 86, 87] and references therein). In fact, the idea of the present construction (using an explicit \u201cnon-embedded\u201d ansatz for the meronic field) is that it discloses in a very neat way the fact that the spin from isospin effect depends actually on \u201cthe N\u201d of the gauge group SU(N), so that the interactions of test scalar fields [charged under SU(N)] with the gravitating merons discussed here can generate fields of arbitrary high spin (if N is large enough). This fact has not been noticed before (to the best of our knowledge) and is a novel outcome of our technique."

Here we only want to mention that the key difference between meron BHs and colored BHs appears in the Klein-Gordon equation\n( \u2212m2)\u03a6 = 0 , = D\u00b5D\u00b5 , (3.13)\nfor a scalar field \u03a6 charged under the gauge group. In the asymptotically flat case, the terms that should give rise to the spin from isospin effect [which are g\u00b5\u03bdA\u00b5A\u03bd\u03a6 and g \u00b5\u03bd (A\u00b5)\u2207\u03bd\u03a6] decay faster than in the case of the meron BH, so that, in the asymptotic region of the colored BHs, such terms are unable to form the contribution \u201c (\u2212\u2192 J )2 /r2\u201d (which will be discussed in\nthe next section) needed to transform Bosons into Fermions (and vice versa).\n3.3 Gravitational spin from isospin effect in SU(N)\nIn general, the presence of a background field breaks the natural symmetries of a theory. For instance, the SU(N) Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations, in which the Yang-Mills field is explicitly given, will break rotational invariance (unless the given field is spherically symmetric). However, there are situations in which the field is indeed symmetric, but the corresponding gauge potential, which appears in the equations, is not. In that case, the orbital angular momentum \u2212\u2192 l will not be a symmetry generator. However, it is possible to compensate the lack of invariance of the potential under spatial rotations with an appropriate gauge rotation. For example, the potential in Eq. (3.5) is not invariant under rotations. However, if one performs the same SU(2) gauge rotation to both space-time indices and internal indices, then the symmetry is recovered. The operator that generates such a transformation is \u2212\u2192 J = \u2212\u2192 l + \u2212\u2192 T , (3.14) where the vector \u2212\u2192 T is formed by the generators of the non-embedded subgroup of SU(N) defined in Eqs. (2.7)\u2013(2.10), while \u2212\u2192 l is the usual orbital angular momentum operator. Hence, \u2212\u2192 J should be considered as the total angular momentum of the system. It is precisely this spherical symmetric up to an internal rotation which gives rise to the JackiwRebbi-Hasenfratz-\u2019t Hooft mechanism, or \u201cspin form isospin\u201d effect [38, 39], according to which the excitations of a Bosonic field charged under SU(2) around a background gauge field with the above characteristics behave as Fermions.8 We are interested here in the case of SU(N), in which the meron solution discussed in the previous section will do the same trick. A quick way to derive the spin from isospin phenomena is to analyze the Klein-Gordon equation in Eq. (3.13) for a scalar field \u03a6 (which will be assumed to belong to the fundamental representation) charged under SU(N), being in this case \u2207\u00b5 the Levi-Civita covariant derivative corresponding to the metric in Eqs. (3.1) and (3.4), and A\u00b5 is the SU(N) meron gauge potential in Eqs. (2.5), (2.6) and (3.2). For the present purpose, it is enough to restrict us to the static case, set \u039b = 0 and to explore the asymptotic region, where the metric is Minkowski. We also set m = 0, so that Eq. (3.13) becomes\n(\u2207i + iAi)(\u2207i + iAi)\u03a6 = ( \u22072 + 2iAi\u2207i + i(\u2207iAi)\u2212AiAi ) \u03a6 . (3.15)\nThe first term in Eq. (3.15) is the Laplacian,\n\u22072\u03a6 = 1 r2\n[ \u2202r(r 2\u2202r\u03a6)\u2212 ~L2\u03a6 ] ,\n8An effect which is very similar to the Jackiw-Rebbi-Hasenfratz-\u2019t Hooft mechanism occurrs for Skyrmions [41] (for a detailed review, see [3]). Indeed, the excitations around the Skyrme soliton with winding number equal to one can behave as Fermions.\nwhere ~L = \u2212i~r \u00d7 ~\u2207 ,\nis the orbital angular momentum operator. Using Eq. (3.5), the second term in Eq. (3.15) is\n2iAi\u2207i = 2i\nr2 Ta\u01eb\najixj\u2207i = \u22122TaLa .\nThe third term vanishes because \u2207iAi = 0, as one may verify directly. Finally, for the last term,\n\u2212AiAi = \u2212 1\nr4 (r2\u03b4ab \u2212 xaxb)TaTb = \u2212\n1\nr2 [~T 2 \u2212 (r\u0302 \u00b7 ~T )2] ,\nwhere r\u0302 \u00b7 ~T = xaTa/r is the projection of \u2212\u2192 T along the direction of ~r. Putting all together, Eq. (3.15) turns out to be\n0 = 1\nr2 \u2202r(r\n2\u2202r\u03a6) + 1\nr2\n( \u2212 ~L2 \u2212 2TaLa \u2212 ~T 2 + (r\u0302 \u00b7 ~T )2 ) \u03a6 (3.16)\n= 1\nr2 \u2202r(r\n2\u2202r\u03a6)\u2212 1\nr2\n( ~J2 \u2212 (r\u0302 \u00b7 ~T )2 ) \u03a6 .\nHere \u2212\u2192 J is the total angular momentum in Eq. (3.14). We see that it forms in the Klein-Gordon equation, supplementing the orbital part as it should. Therefore, one can generate higher spin fields in asymptotically flat space-times using test scalar fields (charged under the gauge group) living in the SU(N) meron BHs constructed in the previous subsections."

            "heading": "3.4 Higher spin fields from non-embedded ansatz in D = 4",
            "text": "The classic results in [52, 53, 54, 55, 56], showed that, under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances, in flat space-times one cannot formulate a consistent quantum field theory with massless particles with spins greater than two. The same approach also suggests similar negative results in asymptotically flat space-times. Soon after these original references, some positive partial results on how to define consistent (cubic) interactions between higher spins fields were obtained in [60, 95, 96]. However, the problem to define consistent renormalizable interactions between higher spin fields on (asymptotically) flat space-times remained. A situation with negative cosmological constants (due to its role as an effective infrared cutoff) was disclosed in [97, 98] (an in-depth analysis of the current situation can be found in [99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105] and references therein). It is worth mentioning that there are also no-go theorems also in AdS (see for instance [106] [107] [108]): the present proposal, to be described here below, can be very useful also in order to avoid these AdS no-go theorems. To the best of authors\u2019 knowledge, the only well-established case (so far) in which it is possible to define a consistent interaction in four-dimensional (asymptotically) flat space-times is the cubic vertex (see, for a modern perspective, [61, 109, 110] and references therein). In particular, in those references, a complete classification of the possible cubic vertices has been performed. It is worth to emphasize that, within their approach, the spectrum is reducible and consist of propagating massless particles with spin s, s\u22122, s\u22124, ... and so on. Consequently, this modern\nformulation is different from [95], in which case the field equations describe a single massless degree of freedom of a particile with spin s. In this sense, the spin from isospin effect corresponding to the non-embedded gravitating merons constructed in the previous sections is more similar to [95] rather than to the modern references mentioned above. The reason is that with the choice of the generators in Eqs. (2.7), (2.9) and (2.10) one gets an irreducible representation of SO(3) of spin j = (N \u2212 1)/2. Hence, due to the conversion of isospin into spin (see [111, 112]) a scalar field charged under the gauge group SU(N) becomes a field of spin j = (N \u2212 1)/2. One way to see this (which has been already discussed in the previous sections) is that the ansatz for the gauge field in Eqs. (2.5), (2.6), (2.7), (2.9) and (2.10) is not spherically symmetric, but the lack of spherical symmetry can be compensated by an internal rotation of spin j = (N\u22121)/2 so that the \u201ctrue\u201d angular momentum operator acting on such a scalar field corresponds to a spin-j field. Now, if one wants to consider interactions one can analyze the well-known (renormalizable in D = 4) scalar field Lagrangian for the Higgs field charge under the SU(N) gauge group with a quartic Higgs potential whose field equations and Lagrangian read, respectively,\ng\u00b5\u03bd (\u2207\u00b5 + iA\u00b5) (\u2207\u03bd + iA\u03bd)\u03a6 = \u2212\u03b3 ( v2 \u2212 |\u03a6|2 ) \u03a6 , (3.17)\nI [\u03a6] = 1\n4\n\u222b d4x \u221a\u2212g ( Tr[D\u00b5\u03a6D \u00b5\u03a6]\u2212 \u03b3 ( v2 \u2212 |\u03a6|2 )2 ) , (3.18)\n\u03a62 = \u22121 2 Tr[\u03a6\u03a6] .\nThe above theory is renormalizable inD = 4 and the corresponding Feynman rules in coordinates space can be defined in the usual way (taking care of the non-trivial background). In order to display the interplay between the vertices and the spin of \u03a6, one can expand explicitly in terms of eigenfunctions \u03a6 of \u2212\u2192 J 2 and r\u0302 \u00b7 ~T . Clearly, being the original theory I [\u03a6] well defined in D = 4, the interaction vertices will be well defined as well, and, since the field \u03a6 acquires a spin j = (N\u22121)/2 due to the background, one can interpret the usual Feynman rules as Feynman rules for spin (N \u2212 1)/2 fields. The original no-go theorems [52, 53, 54, 55, 56], are avoided since the presence of the gravitating meron breaks the symmetry of the vacuum and changes the topology of space-time. Thus, as long as the backreaction of \u03a6 on the background can be neglected, in principle this construction works. Of course, there are severe technical complications to implement this program in practice due to the fact that the non-trivial background prevents one from finding easily the propagators in Fourier space. We hope to return to this interesting issue in a future work."

The Einstein equations may be explicitly solved:\nf(r)2 = 1\u2212 2m r2 \u2212 \u039b 6 r2 \u2212 2 3 \u00d7 24(\u03bb\u2212 1)2\u03bb2\u03ba log(r) e2r2 (N \u2212 1)N(N + 1) 6\n= 1\u2212 2m r2 \u2212 \u039b 6 r2 \u2212 \u03ba log(r) e2r2 TN . (4.4)\nHere TN = (N\u22121)N(N+1)\n6 are the tetrahedral numbers. The constant \u03bb has been left arbitrary so\none can see that when the YM field is pure gauge, \u03bb = 1, the metric reduces to Schwarzschild(anti-) de Sitter in D = 5.\n4.2 Gravitational spin from isospin effect in SU(N)transo\nAs in the previous section, in order to study the spin from isospin effect, we will analyze the Klein-Gordon equation in Eq. (3.13) in D = 5 for a scalar field \u03a6 charged under SU(N), with \u2207\u00b5 the Levi-Civita covariant derivative corresponding this time to the metric in Eqs. (4.1) and (4.4). Here A\u00b5 is the SU(N) meron gauge potential in Eqs. (2.5), (2.6) and (4.2). In D = 5 the orbital angular momentum is given, in Cartesian coordinates, by\nLAB = \u2212i(xA\u2202B \u2212 xB\u2202A) ,\nwhere xA, A = 1, . . . , 4 are the spatial indices. They satisfy the SO(4) algebra. Because SO(4) = SO(3)\u00d7SO(3), the above generators may be divided into two sets, each satisfying the SO(3) algebra. Explicitly,\nL\u00b1a = \u01eba bcLbc \u00b1 L4a , [L\u00b1a , L\u00b1b ] = i\u01ebcabL\u00b1c , [L+a , L\u2212b ] = 0 , (4.5)\nwhere a, b = 1, 2, 3. We call L+a , L \u2212 b the right and left angular momentum, respectively. It is useful to write these generators in the spherical coordinates of the 3-sphere defined in the metric (4.1). For example, the right angular momentum is given by\nL+1 =i ( cos \u03b3 cot \u03b8\u2202\u03b3 + sin \u03b3\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b3\nsin \u03b8 \u2202\u03c6\n) , (4.6)\nL+2 =i ( sin \u03b3 cot \u03b8\u2202\u03b3 \u2212 cos \u03b3\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b3\nsin \u03b8 \u2202\u03c6\n) , (4.7)\nL+3 =\u2212 i\u2202\u03b3 . (4.8)\nIn this form, the generators are well defined not only in Minkowski space but also in the BH geometry in Eq. (4.1). In terms of these, the D\u2019Alambert operator is\n= \u2212 1 f2 \u22022t + 1 r3 \u2202r(r 3f2\u2202r)\u2212 1 r2 1 2 LABLAB = \u2212 1 f2 \u22022t + 1 r3 \u2202r(r 3f2\u2202r)\u2212 2 r2 [ (~L+)2 + (~L\u2212)2 ] .\nAs in the D = 4 case, we now consider the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field \u03a6 in the background of the right-handed meron,\n( + i\u2207\u00b5A\u00b5 + 2iA\u00b5\u2207\u00b5 \u2212A\u00b5A\u00b5 \u2212m2)\u03a6 = 0 . (4.9)\nSubstituting the explicit expressions for A\u00b5 and g\u00b5\u03bd given by Eqs. (2.5), (2.6), (4.1)\u2013(4.4), Eq. (4.9) takes the form\n( \u2212 1 f2 \u22022t + 1 r3 \u2202r(r 3f2\u2202r)\u2212 1 r2 ( 2( ~J+)2 + 2( ~J\u2212)2 \u2212 \u03c3(N)1 ) \u2212m2 ) \u03a6 = 0 , (4.10)\nwhere 1 is the N \u00d7N identity matrix, \u03c3(N) is given in Eq. (2.13) and\nJ+a = L + a + Ta , J \u2212 a = L \u2212 a .\nFrom this equation we see that the angular momentum is given by the pair J+a , J \u2212 a which, besides the orbital part L+a , L \u2212 a , has a contribution from the generators of SU(N). In this case, only the right angular momentum J+a gets shifted. Of course, there is nothing special about the right angular momentum. A second solution of the Yang-Mills-Einstein system exists which shifts the left angular momentum J\u2212a instead. It is obtained by replacing the group element U of the above solution by by U\u22121. The metric (3.4) and the meron form (2.5) of the gauge field are the same. Note also that, in addition to the angular momentum, the expression multiplying r\u22122 in Eq. (4.10) contains a term proportional to the identity. This is much simpler than the D = 4 case, where the extra term is (r\u0302 \u00b7 ~T )2, as seen in Eq. (3.16). The reason behind this reduction (similar to what happens for the BH in [25]), lies in the term A\u00b5A \u00b5 in Eq. (4.9), which in the D = 5 case, turns out to be proportional to ( \u2212\u2192 T )2. Then, the spin of the particles becomes exactly \u03c3N according to Eq. (2.12). There is another important difference between the black hole solutions in D = 4 and D = 5 presented above, namely, the first has vanishing topological charge while the latter has a finite one. In fact, consider the following standard definition of the topological charge,\nB = 1\n24\u03c02\n\u222b\n\u03a3 \u03c1B , \u03c1B = \u01eb\nijkTr[LiLjLk] ,\nwhere \u03a3 is any three-dimensional spatial surface defined by t = const and r = const while\nL\u00b5 = U\u22121\u2202\u00b5U = \u2126a\u00b5Ta , (4.11)\nare the Maurer-Cartan form components, \u2126a\u00b5 are the left-invariant 1-forms components of an element U(x) \u2208 SU(N) parameterized as in Eq. (2.6). Note that a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for having a non-zero topological charge is that the functions Fi in Eq. (2.6) must be independent. This effectively occurs in the case of the BH in D = 5 considered above, where each function depends linearly on a different coordinate of the 3-sphere [see Eq. (4.2)], and it is possible to verify that B 6= 0 on \u03a3 by integrating into the ranges of the coordinates in Eq. (4.1). On the other hand, in the case of the meron BH in D = 4, the functions Fi are not independent [see Eq. (3.2)], and it is direct to check that \u03c1B = 0 identically."

Although this configuration has compact spatial sections (and, consequently, no spin from isospin effect) it possesses interesting features which are worth mentioning.9 We consider a static space-time metric that is a product of R\u00d7 S3 with a constant scale factor \u03c10, namely\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + \u03c1 2 0\n4\n( (d\u03b3 + cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) , (5.1)\ntogether with the following ansatz for the gauge field\nF1(x \u00b5) = \u03b3 , F2(x \u00b5) = \u03b8 , F3(x \u00b5) = \u03c6 , (5.2)\nand\n\u03bb = 1\n2 . (5.3)\nWith the above ansatz the SU(N)-YM equations are identically satisfied, while the Einstein equations provide the following constraints between the coupling constants\n\u03c120 = \u03baTN e2 , \u039b = 3 2\ne2\n\u03baTN . (5.4)\nThe energy density of the soliton is then\nT00 = 3\n2 TN e2\u03c140 = \u039b \u03ba = 3 2\ne2\n\u03ba2TN . (5.5)\nOne can see that, if one requires having a static gravitating configuration, then the cosmological constant must scale as 1/N , so that it must be small and positive when N is large. One can also consider a time-dependent scale factor, \u03c1 = \u03c1(t), in which case the field equations read\n\u03c1\u0308\u2212 1 3 \u039b\u03c1+ \u03baTN 2e2\u03c13 = 0 , (5.6)\n\u03c1\u03072 \u2212 1 3 \u039b\u03c12 + 1\u2212 \u03baTN 2e2\u03c12 = 0 . (5.7)\n9See [113] for the construction of gravitating merons in D-dimensional massive Yang-Mills theory and the\nSkyrme model.\nThe above equations system represents a cosmological space-time whose source is the energymomentum tensor of a non-embedded SU(N) meron, because still in this dynamical case the YM equations are identically satisfied for \u03bb = 1/2. We hope to come back on the analysis of these cosmological space-time in a future publication."

            "text": "In this paper we have constructed meron BHs and self-gravitating soliton solutions in the Einstein SU(N)-YM theory in D = 4 and D = 5 dimensions for all values of N . These analytic configurations have been found by combining the generalized hedgehog ansatz with the Euler parameterization of the SU(N) group from which the YM equations are automatically satisfied for all values of N , while the Einstein equations can be solved analytically. One of the main results of this work is that we explicitly show the role that the color number N plays in the gravitational spin from isospin effect. In fact, meron BHs can be distinguished by colored BHs by looking at the spin from isospin effect, because this effect is present only in the meron BHs constructed here. In order to compute the spin generated from the isospin we have considered a Bosonic field charged under SU(N) around the background gauge field of the BH solutions, showing that this mechanism works differently for the BHs in D = 4 and D = 5. This difference lies in the presence of a non-zero topological charge for the ansatz of the D = 5 case. Also, using the theory of non-embedded ansatz for SU(N) together with the spin from isospin effect, one can build fields of arbitrary high spin out of scalar fields charged under the gauge group. Hence, one can analyze interacting higher spin fields in asymptotically flat space-times without introducing by hand higher spin fields."
