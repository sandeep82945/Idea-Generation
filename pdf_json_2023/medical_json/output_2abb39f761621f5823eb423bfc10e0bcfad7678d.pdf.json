We aimed to determine the risk and prognostic factors for BM in patients with newly diagnosed EC and to conduct two nomograms to predict the probability of BM and overall survival after BM. Methods: Data from patients with EC from 2010 to 2015 were reviewed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We divided participants into training and validation cohorts using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and Cox regression models to explore the risk and prognostic factors of BM, respectively. Moreover, two nomograms were developed for predicting the risk and prognosis of BM in patients with EC. Then we used receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analysis, and calibration curves to evaluate the nomogram models. The overall survival of patients with EC and BM was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: A total of 10,730 patients with EC were involved, 735 of whom had BM at the time of diagnosis. Histologic type, sex, age, N stage, primary site, liver, lung, and brain metastases, and tumor differentiation grade were identified as independent BM risk factors. Histological type, chemotherapy, brain, liver, and lung metastases were identified as prognostic risk factors for patients with EC and BM. We developed diagnostic and prognostic nomograms according to the results. Receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration, and Kaplan-Meier curves, and decision curve analysis all indicated that both nomograms had great clinical predictive ability and good clinical application potential. Conclusions: Two novel nomograms were constructed to predict the risk and prognosis of BM in patients with EC. These prediction models can effectively assist clinicians in clinical decision-making based on their good accuracy and reliability.\nKEYWORDS\nbone metastasis, esophageal cancer, nomogram, overall survival, prognosis\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Esophageal cancer (EC) ranks ninth among the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for 3.2% of 35 major cancers and approximately 5.3% of all cancer-related mortality (1). Globally, 316,000 new cases of EC are diagnosed each year with 286,000 deaths, while 13,000 new diagnoses and 12,600 deaths occur in the United States alone (2). The prognosis is poor, especially with metastatic disease (3\u20135). Patients with metastatic EC have a median survival time of only 6 months, and the 2-year survival rate is about 11.8% (6).\nBone is one of the most common metastatic sites of malignant tumors and the third most common metastatic organ in patients with EC (7\u20139), following the liver and lung (10, 11). Several studies have reported a rate of 5.2%\u20137.7% of bone metastasis (BM) in patients with EC, with BM accounting for 15.3%\u201323.6% of metastatic EC (3, 12, 13). Sex, tumor location, tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stages, and liver, lung, and brain metastases have been correlated with occurrence of BM (14, 15). In addition to the above factors, age, pathological tumor type, blood tumor markers, and marital status are correlated with the prognosis of patients with EC and BM (3, 14).\nOnce BM occurs, there are few treatment options available that can effectively improve the survival of patients with EC (16, 17). Patients may present with a range of skeletal-related symptoms, including pathological fractures, hypercalcemia, pain, and nerve compression syndromes (18). For those patients with EC and BM, overall survival (OS) is poorer than that for patients with EC and other metastatic sites (4). Despite the importance of accurate prognosis prediction, the classic TNM staging system depends solely on three pathological indicators, including tumor invasion, lymph node infiltration, and distant metastasis, while ignoring other prognostic factors, leading to reduced prognostic prediction accuracy for patients with EC (19, 20). Consequently, it is essential to establish a tool that can integrate clinicopathological and other prognosis-related factors to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with EC.\nNomograms are tools that integrate multiple clinical, pathological, demographic, and oncological factors to predict the occurrence of medical events and have a great application potential for prognostic prediction of patients with cancer (21). In addition, nomograms have an advantage in accuracy over the traditional TNM staging system in intuitively estimating the survival rates of patients with cancer (22). By analyzing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we aimed to develop two novel nomograms to separately and quantitatively predict the risk of BM and OS of patients with EC and BM to assist clinical decision-making.\nFrontiers in Surgery 02"

We then established a nomogram and calculated individual risk scores to determine the probability of BM. The scale at the top illustrates the points of each predictor, ranging from 0 to 100. By drawing a vertical line, each predictor can be determined with the corresponding value on the scale. The sum of the values for each predictor is displayed as the total points, which corresponds to the probability of BM shown at the bottom of the chart. To show the prediction efficiency of the nomogram, we created a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the area under the curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis (DCA) was also performed and calibration curves were plotted. DCA is a common method to assess the clinical application value of a novel diagnostic tool by calculating the corresponding net benefit at each threshold probability (25, 26). The farther the curve is from the two intersecting lines, the greater the clinical application value. Calibration curves were used to evaluate differences between the actual and predicted data to determine the accuracy of the nomogram. To further assess the performance of this nomogram, ROC curves along with the corresponding AUC value, DCA, and calibration curves were also performed for the validation cohort.\nSurvival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors for patients with EC and BM. At a ratio of 3:7, participants with BM were randomly assigned to the validation and training groups. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was preliminarily performed to investigate the OS-related factors. Then, multivariate Cox regression analyses were used on factors with P values less than 0.05 to identify the independent prognostic risk factors for patients with EC and BM. Subsequently, based on the results above, a nomogram was developed for predicting the OS of patients with EC and BM. The survival probabilities of patients at 3, 6, and 12 months were obtained by calculating the points in each dimension. Additionally, time-dependent ROC curves at 3, 6, and 12 months, along with the corresponding time-dependent AUC values, were plotted to demonstrate the prediction efficiency of the prognostic nomogram. Moreover, calibration and DCA curves were established. In order to compare with the training group, the validation group was also conducted with the same operation and plotted the corresponding time-dependent ROC, calibration, and DCA curves. Moreover, patients with EC and BM were classified into high- and low-risk groups according to the prognostic scores calculated by the nomogram. KaplanMeier (K-M) survival curves were plotted to present the survival differences between the two groups.\nFrontiers in Surgery 04"

No significant statistical differences were found in predictors between the two groups. The predictors were preliminarily analyzed by univariate logistic regression analyses in the training group. Statistical results displayed that the Pvalues for histologic type, primary site, age, race, sex, grade, N stage, and liver, lung, and brain metastases were less than 0.05, which were further identified through multivariate logistic regression analyses (Table 3). Histologic type, primary site, age, sex, tumor differentiation grade, N stage, and liver, lung, and brain metastases were identified as independent risk factors for BM in patients with EC.

            "text": "BM is one of the most common metastatic pathways in advanced EC, and usually predicts poorer prognosis and shorter survival expectancy (15). The incidence of BM in patients with EC was 6.8% in our study, which was consistent with the range of 5.2%\u20137.7% reported in previous studies (3, 12). However, the incidence of BM is often underestimated because imaging methods to detect BM, including bone scintigraphy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography, are relatively expensive and not routinely performed (15). Moreover, the symptoms of BM are not significant in the early stage and are easily masked by other symptoms, which also leads to underestimation (14). Therefore, the predictive nomogram used in this study is conducive for predicting the probability of BM and timely intervention in high-risk patients according to the probability of metastasis to prevent disease progression. Traditional TNM staging can only roughly predict prognosis, whereas the survival time of patients can be quantitatively predicted using the prognostic nomogram. Therefore, the nomogram has high clinical decision-making value for patients with both\nFrontiers in Surgery 14\nsuspected and confirmed BM, and the treatment strategy can be adjusted through survival prediction, thereby improving prognosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a model that can quantitatively predict the risk or prognosis of BM for EC has been established.\nIn this study, histologic type, primary site, age, sex, tumor differentiation grade, N stage, and lung, liver, and brain metastases were found to be independent risk factors for BM in patients with EC. Unexpectedly, older patients with EC tended to have a lower probability of BM in this cohort. This conclusion is in accordance with the finding by Qin et al. which determined that patients aged 51 to 60 years had a higher risk of BM compared with patients aged 71 to 80 years (15). This phenomenon also occurs in liver metastasis of EC (10), and capillary sclerosis may be an important factor in reducing distant organ metastasis in older adults (7). In addition, we found men were more likely to develop BM from EC than women. This phenomenon may be related to higher rates of smoking and drinking among men, which are the risk factors for BM (27, 28). Among all primary sites of EC, middle esophageal carcinoma had the highest rate of BM. This finding may be because the middle esophagus is\nfrontiersin.org\nFIGURE 10 Kaplan\u2013meier curves of high- and low-risk patients in the training group (A) and validation group (B). Patients in the low-risk group had a higher survival probability than those in the high-risk group (P < 0.0001) in both cohorts.\nanatomically closest to spine and shares the most blood supply with the spine (8, 29, 30). Because the blood flow of the spinal vein runs slowly and is interconnected, once the pressure of the\nFrontiers in Surgery 15\nthoracic or abdominal cavity increases, the tumor embolus can directly enter the vertebral vein system and cause metastasis (29). Among all the risk factors, brain metastasis had the\nfrontiersin.org\nmost significant impact on BM development, followed by liver and lung metastases. The study by Zhang et al. had the same results (14), probably owing to the fact that cancer has already widely spread through the blood and caused damage when these metastases occur (31, 32). Moreover, AC contributed more to the development of BM than SCC. Another study including 9,934 stage I\u2013IV patients with EC suggested that the AC subtype was more likely to cause BM than SCC tumors (7). The exact mechanism for this metastasis remains unclear, several researchers have pointed out that high expression of sorting nexin 3, sphingosine-1phosphate receptor 2, and toll-like receptor 9 may explain the high invasiveness of AC in patients with EC (33\u201335).\nWe established a predictive nomogram to evaluate the probability of BM in patients with EC. AUC values of this model in the training and validation groups were 0.765 and 0.752, respectively, indicating that the nomogram had good prediction ability. Notably, the predictive model possessed great clinical application potential according to the calibration and DCA curves in either the training or validation groups.\nIn the prognostic prediction nomogram, histological type, chemotherapy, and brain, lung, and liver metastases were found to be independent prognostic risk factors for patients with BM. Compared with surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy plays a more important role in prognosis. Qiu et al. found that older patients who underwent chemotherapy had better survival than those who did not, regardless of whether the patient received surgery or radiation (11). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with metastaticEC, with targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy as a second-line treatment option (36). In addition, it has been shown that zoledronate decreases the incidence of skeletal-related events in patients with BMs, and thus may be associated with improved survival (37). However, due to the limitations of the SEER database, we were unable to validate the effectiveness of these therapeutic measures in patients with EC and BM.\nRegarding histological type, we found that patients with EC and SCC tend to have worse OS than patients with AC. Zhang et al. also found that patients with esophageal AC had a higher risk of BM, whereas patients with esophageal SCC had a worse prognosis after BM (14). To date, the mechanisms related to the prognosis of SCC remain unknown; however, at the molecular level, abnormal expression of FAM3C, AKAP8L, and E2F5 may be associated with poor prognosis (38\u201340).\nPatients with EC and BM had poor prognosis and relatively short median OS of only 5 months. Therefore, we established a prognostic nomogram to quantitatively predict the survival at 3, 6, and 12 months in patients with EC and BM. The AUC values and calibration curves indicated that the prognostic model had\nFrontiers in Surgery 16\ngood predictive ability in patients with EC and BM. A similar situation can be seen in the DCA curve, where the model had a high net benefit for patients with BM. Furthermore, the high-risk patients screened by the prognostic nomogram had dramatically worse survival rates in the K-M curves, reflecting the good discriminatory ability of the model.\nThis study had a few limitations. First, since the information was extracted from the SEER database, the predictors were limited to the demographic and disease indicators recorded in the database, which may make it difficult to improve the accuracy of the prediction models. Moreover, as patients with EC and BM had a median OS of only 5 months in this study, few patients survived for more than a full year, so the predictive ability for the long-term survival of this model is relatively limited. Finally, internal validation was performed in this study and showed good predictive power of the nomograms, however, given the ethnic differences and the high incidence of EC in East Asia, we will collect information from a large number of patients with EC in China to perform external validation to better validate and explain the findings of this study in the future. Despite these limitations, this study has developed models that can quantitatively and individually predict the risk and prognosis of BM in patients with EC, which can greatly improve disease surveillance and clinical decision making."
