    "abstractText": "6 Autobiographical memories are thought to be retrieved using two possible ways: a generative 7 one, which is effortful and follows a general-to-specific pathway, and a direct one, which is 8 automatic and relatively effortless. These two retrieve processes are known to differ on the 9 quantitative side (especially considering retrieval times), from a qualitative point of view, 10 however, evidence is missing. Here, we aimed to disentangle this question by taking advantage 11 of a dual-task paradigm in which the different tasks tax different executive functions. 12 Participants were asked to perform an autobiographical memory task under three different 13 conditions: no cognitive load, non-visual cognitive load and visual cognitive load. On the 14 quantitative side, results replicated previous findings with generative processes being slower 15 compared with direct ones. Conversely, on the qualitative side, results indicated that the 16 retrieval times of both direct and generative retrieval processes varied similarly according to 17 the dual-task condition, thus supporting the idea that the same memory process could underlie 18 both retrievals. 19",

            "text": "Autobiographical memories are thought to be retrieved using two possible ways: a generative 7 one, which is effortful and follows a general-to-specific pathway, and a direct one, which is 8 automatic and relatively effortless. These two retrieve processes are known to differ on the 9 quantitative side (especially considering retrieval times), from a qualitative point of view, 10 however, evidence is missing. Here, we aimed to disentangle this question by taking advantage 11 of a dual-task paradigm in which the different tasks tax different executive functions. 12 Participants were asked to perform an autobiographical memory task under three different 13 conditions: no cognitive load, non-visual cognitive load and visual cognitive load. On the 14 quantitative side, results replicated previous findings with generative processes being slower 15 compared with direct ones. Conversely, on the qualitative side, results indicated that the 16 retrieval times of both direct and generative retrieval processes varied similarly according to 17 the dual-task condition, thus supporting the idea that the same memory process could underlie 18 both retrievals. 19\n20\n21\nKeywords: direct retrieval; generative retrieval; autobiographical memory; divided attention; 22 visual search task. 23\n24\nThis version of the article has been accepted for publication, after peer review (when applicable) 25 and is subject to Springer Nature\u2019s AM terms of use, but is not the Version of Record and does 26 not reflect post-acceptance improvements, or any corrections. The Version of Record is available 27 online at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10339-022-01095-0 28 29\n30\n31\nIntroduction 32\nHow do we remember specific episodes from our own lives? According to a major model in 33 autobiographical memory research (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), episodes can be 34 retrieved directly or generatively, with the former process being a minor part of humans\u2019 35 mnestic life, as compared with the latter. Indeed, direct retrieval is relatively effortless when 36 specific cues automatically trigger a specific autobiographic memory, while generative retrieval 37 is effortful, and reconstructive. Additionally, it should be noted that the process itself (i.e., direct 38 vs. generative) is generally independent from the intentionality of the memory (voluntary vs. 39 involuntary) as it is for example possible to observe involuntary generative memories as well 40 as voluntary direct memories (Barzykowski & Staugaard, 2015, 2018; Barzykowski et al., 41 2019; 2021). 42\nSpecifically, the generative retrieval of autobiographical memories follows a general-to-43 specific pathway (Haque & Conway, 2001), starting from general life themes (e.g., when I was 44 in high school) moving down to general events within those life themes (e.g., a vacation when 45 I was in high school), and then to specific episodes (e.g., that dinner at that restaurant when on 46 vacation when I was in high school). Several approaches claimed that retrieval from 47 autobiographical memory is primarily a reconstructive process requiring cognitive resources, 48 as additional cues need to be created in response to the cue word provided (Haque & Conway, 49 2001; Harris et al., 2015). This is in line with the idea that generative retrieval relies more than 50 direct retrieval on executive control, memory search, memory elaboration, and retrieval of 51 semantic information (Addis et al., 2012). 52\nDirect retrieval is considered as an alternative retrieval route, albeit a rather rare one, in the 53 Conway and Pledell-Pearce (2000) model as retrieval occurring when specific memories are 54 accessed directly in response to a cue. In this case, the generative process is bypassed, and the 55 specific memory is accessed directly within a few seconds, and presumably without effort. 56 Direct retrieval is assumed also to be responsible for involuntary memories in healthy, non-57 traumatized, individuals. Involuntary memories are rather common mental events (Berntsen, 58 1996; Rasmussen & Berntsen, 2011; Vannucci et al., 2014), which seemingly pop into one\u2019s 59 mind without effort or conscious retrieval attempts (Schlagman & Kvavilashvili, 2008) and are 60 attributed to the close match between cues and memory representations (Berntsen & Rubin, 61 2012). 62\nFrom a quantitative point of view, direct and generative retrieval differ in terms of the cognitive 63 effort required to process the memory (i.e., a slowing down of response time for generative 64 processes was observed using dual-task paradigms; e.g., Anderson, Dewhurst & Dean, 2012; 65 Eade et al., 2006). For example, Anderson and colleagues (2012) measured the retrieval time 66 of the first episodic memory in single task and dual task conditions, using a verbal random 67 number generation task as concomitant task. Results showed that the retrieval times did not 68 differ between the single and dual-task conditions when memories were cued by high 69 imageability words (e.g., cat, house; which are thought to prompt direct retrieval; Williams et 70 al., 1999; Anderson et al., 2012, but cf. also: Uzer et al., 2012). Conversely, retrieval was slower 71 in the dual-task condition when cues were low imageability words (e.g., moral, wisdom; which 72 are thought to prompt generative retrieval; Williams et al., 1999; Anderson et al., 2012, but cf. 73 also: Uzer et al., 2012). 74\nFrom a qualitative point of view \u2013 i.e., whether direct and generative retrieval could be based 75 on different memory processes, rather than being a short and a long version of the same process 76 \u2013, some recent papers have provided important information (e.g., Barzykowski & Staugaard, 77 2015, 2018; Barzykowski et al., 2019; 2021). This study aims at providing additional data, using 78 a different methodology, in establishing if direct and generative retrieval are two different 79 processes or the same process. Regarding possible differences/commonalities, seminal 80 perspectives proposed that directive retrieval processes bypass reconstructive components, 81 while generative retrieval processes should be top-down and reconstructive (Haque & Conway, 82 2001), while other researchers proposed that these could differ in the time needed to complete 83 the retrieval (Uzer et al., 2012) or in the subjective effort required (Harris & Berntsen, 2019, 84 see also e.g., Barzykowski et al., 2019; 2021). In the present study we thus aimed to disentangle 85 this question by taking advantage of a dual-task paradigm in which the different tasks tax 86 different executive functions. Participants were asked to perform an autobiographical memory 87 task under three different conditions: no cognitive load, non-visual cognitive load and visual 88 cognitive load. The two cognitive load tasks consisted of (i) a non-visual, verbal random 89 number generation (RNG) task (Miyake et al., 2000; similar to those previously used: Anderson 90 et al., 2012; Eade et al., 2006), and (ii) a visual search task (Woodman et al., 2001). Verbal 91 random number generation relies on executive functions and should thus use cognitive 92 resources, while the visual dual task not only taxes cognitive resources, but it also takes up, and 93 thus divides, visual processes (Woodman et al., 2001). We decided to include both visual and 94 non-visual tasks since visual processes represent an important component of autobiographical 95\nmemory retrieval (Holland et al., 2011; Rubin & Greenberg, 1998). It has also been proposed 96 that visual processes contribute more to the retrieval of specific episodic memories than to the 97 retrieval of general-level memories (Addis et al., 2004). We believe that by comparing the effect 98 on retrieval times by the two concomitant task conditions it is possible to obtain some 99 qualitative indications of the retrieval processes involved. Specifically, for example, in case of 100 selective visual (or verbal) involvement in one of the two memory processes, the concomitant 101 task tapping on that relevant function would interfere with the ongoing retrieval and 102 reconstruction of the memory. That is, in case of more pronounced visual or verbal involvement 103 in one of the two memory processes, we should observe a selective slowing down in one of (or 104 both) the two dual-task conditions in one of the two retrieval types, thus indicating different 105 characteristics of the memory processes involved. Conversely, comparable effects of the dual-106 tasks conditions across the two retrieval types would indicate that direct and generative retrieval 107 could be two flips of the same coin, thus differing only in terms of the time required to retrieve 108 the memory. 109\n110\nMethod 111\nParticipants 112\nThirty-six participants (3 males, 33 females; mean age = 24.4, SD = 3.7) from the Universities 113 of Hull in the UK (6 participants) and the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary (30 114 participants) were tested individually. They participated in return for 8\u00a3 payment. All 115 participants were informed that their responses were anonymous, and that they should not report 116 anything that was uncomfortable for them to disclose. Prior to the experiment they signed an 117 informed consent form. The study was approved by the ethics committees of the Department 118 of Psychology of Hull University and Eotvos Lorand University. 119\n120\nMaterials and apparatus 121\nSixty-six cue words were used to elicit memories. They were selected from words that had been 122 used successfully in prior autobiographical memory studies (e.g., Conway & Bekerian, 1987; 123 Haque & Conway, 2001), which in turn had been selected from Hampton and Gardiner (1983). 124 In addition, prototypical exemplars were selected from the categories clothing, fruits, 125 vegetables, furniture, sports, and vehicles (Hampton & Gardiner, 1983). The cue words were 126\ndivided into six lists of 11 words each (1 practice cue word and 10 experimental cue words, see 127 Appendix A; for Hungarian participants the words were translated). Three lists were used for 128 each participant, counterbalanced across conditions and participants. The practice words were 129 always presented first and the cue words in each list were randomized across participants. 130\n131\nProcedure 132\nThree within-subjects conditions: (i) autobiographical memory task without concomitant task 133 (from now on called no-task condition), (ii) autobiographical memory task with concomitant 134 visual search task (from now on called visual-task condition), and (iii) autobiographical 135 memory task with concomitant random number generation task (from now on called RNG-task 136 condition), were presented in blocks, and counterbalanced across participants. In each condition 137 10 different cue words were presented. The complete session took about 40 minutes to 138 complete. 139\n140\nAutobiographical memory task 141\nDirectly prior to the experiment participants were given the following instructions verbally, 142 which stressed the specific nature of the memories to be retrieved: 143\n\u201cEach new trial will begin with a new word presented on the screen for 1 second. Your task is 144 to remember a specific event that is related to that word. As soon as the specific event comes 145 to mind press the space bar; you have up to 60 seconds to remember an event. Importantly, the 146 remembered event should: (i) have taken place at a specific time and location, (ii) not have 147 lasted for more than 1 day, (iii) be a singular, non-repetitive, activity (e.g., going to volleyball 148 practice every week is not good), (iv) should be from your own life. For example, if you think 149 back and remember your math teacher, this is not good, because these are several memories 150 connected to one person. It is also not good if you have a longer period in mind, for example 151 going on vacation to France. It is an event that was longer than one day. In that case you should 152 try to find a specific memory from that event. For example, you can think about drinking coffee 153 next to the Eiffel Tower, this is a specific event. It can also happen that you have something in 154 mind that kept happening to you. For example, attending dance classes. That is also not good, 155 because it is a memory of a whole period. But if you can remember specific examples from 156 these events, that is good. For example, you can remember the class when you first danced with 157 John. The memories do not have to be strictly about the cue word. Anything that the cue word 158\nreminds you of is fine. They neither have to be important, funny or interesting. Anything that 159 comes to mind and fits this type of memory is good. Please press the spacebar as soon as you 160 have a specific memory in mind.\u201d In the practice trial participants were required to give an 161 example of a memory cued by the word \u201cA-level\u201d to check if they understood the instructions 162 correctly. 163\nEach trial started with a fixation cross, presented in the middle of the computer screen for 500 164 ms. This was followed by the cue word presented at the same location, which remained on the 165 screen for 1000 ms. The reaction times (RTs) timer started at the onset of the cue word. 166 Participants pressed the spacebar as soon as they had retrieved a memory, which stopped the 167 RTs timer. After the participant reported the memory verbally, a report was written down by 168 the experimenter. In order to classify the memory as either direct or generative, participants 169 were asked a question about retrieval mode, which has been used in prior studies of 170 autobiographical memory retrieval (Uzer et al., 2012): \u201cWas it only the cue word that triggered 171 the memory or did you use any additional information from your life to find the memory\u201d. 172\n173\nConcomitant tasks 174\nIn the two dual-task conditions, each trial started with the concomitant task. After 10 seconds 175 of solely the concomitant task, the autobiographical memory task started. The concomitant task 176 continued until the spacebar was pressed to indicate that a memory was found. Please, note that 177 the concomitant task was present with the same procedure for each cue word presented in the 178 conditions with a concomitant task. The decision to interrupt the concomitant task as soon as 179 the participant indicated to have found a memory was driven by the fact that our dependent 180 variable of interest was participants\u2019 response time, which then was already collected. 181\n182\nConcomitant task 1: Visual search. The task was to search for the letter T among many letters 183 L (18-22) randomly placed on the screen in a static display. The task was adapted from Duncan 184 and Humphreys (1989). Participants had to press the T key on the keyboard as soon as they 185 spotted the T, or the L key in case they decided there was no letter T in the display. In 20% of 186 the trials there was no T. After three runs of the visual search task (which took about 10s) the 187 cue word appeared for 1 second, immediately followed by a continuation of the visual search 188 task. When the cue word was on the screen no visual search letters were shown simultaneously. 189 The participants had to complete the visual search task while retrieving a memory triggered by 190\nthe cue word. As soon as the memory was retrieved they said \u2018now\u2019, and pressed the spacebar, 191 which immediately cleared the screen and the participant reported the memory verbally (written 192 down by the experimenter). 193\n194\nConcomitant task 2: Random number generation. In the verbal random number generation 195 (RNG) task (Towse & Neil, 1998) participants were instructed to say randomly the numbers 1 196 to 9 out loud, one number per second. A metronome-like ticking noise helped participants to 197 keep pace. During presentation of the cue word on the screen (1s) the participants did not 198 generate numbers. The RNG task was continued immediately after the word had disappeared 199 while retrieving a memory triggered by the cue word. When a memory was retrieved, 200 participants had to press the space bar. The RNG task stopped as soon as they pressed the 201 spacebar to indicate they retrieved a memory. 202\n203\nData analysis and results 204\nMean participants\u2019 RTs of each condition were our dependent variable. In a few cases reported 205 memories were deemed inadequate as they did not match the instruction criteria and were 206 removed from the analysis: no-task condition, 6.8% of the trials; visual-task condition, 6.1%; 207 RGN-task condition, 6.5%. In case of missing direct or generative memories, the missing RTs 208 values were imputed through deterministic regression imputation method (Van Buuren, 2018) 209 using the mice R package (Van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011; 14% of the data were 210 imputed). In the no-dual task condition, generative memories were the 78%, while the 18% 211 were classified as direct (no memories were reported in the 2.8% of the cases); in the visual 212 task the percentages were respectively the 82% and the 14% (no memories were reported in the 213 3% of the cases); while in the RNG task they were respectively the 80% and the 18% (no 214 memories were reported in the 1.7% of the cases). Conversely, regarding RTs, generative 215 retrievals required more time to be completed across no-dual task (M = 7.09 s, SD = 3.45 s), 216 visual task (M = 9.21 s, SD = 4.84 s) and RNG task (M = 7.89 s, SD = 4.12 s) compared with 217 direct retrievals (respectively: M = 2.88 s, SD = .97 s; M = 4.43 s, SD = 1.58 s; and M = 3.23 s, 218 SD = 1.32 s). 219\nIn order to assess whether the dual-tasks condition modulated participants RTs across the two 220 retrieval processes we performed a frequentist 3x2 ANOVA having type of task (no dual-task 221 vs. visual vs. RNG) and retrieval process (direct vs. generative) and their interaction as within-222\nparticipants factors. The frequentist ANOVA showed that participants\u2019 RTs were modulated by 223 the type of task, F(2,70) = 11.05, p < .001, \u03b72p = .24, and by the retrieval process, F(1,35) = 224 68.70, p < .001, \u03b72p = .66; the interaction type of task by retrieval process was not significant, 225 F(2,70) = .33, p = .71, \u03b72p = .01. Post-hoc t-tests showed that participants\u2019 RTs were slower 226 when they were performing the autobiographical memory task paired with the visual task 227 compared with both no dual-task, t(35) = 4.60, p < .001, and RNG conditions, t(35) = 3.16, p = 228 .004; no differences were found between no dual-task and RNG conditions, t(35) = 1.44, p = 229 .30 (p-values are Bonferroni corrected). In addition, post-hoc t-tests showed that participants\u2019 230 RTs were faster when they reported a memory as direct compared with generative ones, t(35) 231 = 8.29, p < .0011,2. 232\nThen, since we were interested in estimating the relative evidence supporting the model 233 including the interaction type of task by retrieval process versus the model including additively 234 the two main factors (i.e., alternative hypothesis vs. null hypothesis; Dienes, 2014), we also 235 performed two Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVAs using JASP in its default settings for the 236 a priori distribution of the parameters (r scale fixed effects = .5, r scale random effects = 1; for 237 more information regarding priors see: Rouder et al., 2012; van den Bergh et al., 2020; JASP 238 Team, 2018; Wagenmakers et al., 2018). Since Bayes Factor (BF) computation is a ratio 239 between the probabilities of two different hypotheses, in the present analysis BFs above 1 240 indicate evidence for the null hypothesis and BF below 1 indicate evidence for the alternative. 241 We considered BFs above 3 as indicative of moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis 242 and 0.33 as indicative of moderate evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (Dienes, 243 2014). The BF was 10.51, indicating that the best model explaining the data was the one without 244 the interaction type of task by retrieval process (i.e., the null hypothesis). 245\n246\nDiscussion 247\nIn the present study, we explored whether direct and generative retrieval processes could be 248 based on different memory processes, rather than being a short and a long version of the same 249 memory process. We aimed to disentangle this question by taking advantage of a dual-task 250\n1 Comparable results were obtained also when including only Hungarian participants (N = 30), as well as when including the group (English participants vs. Hungarian participants) as between participant factor, with this factor being not significant, F(1,34) = .70, p = .40, \u03b72p = .02, nor interacting with the other factors (all ps > .17, all \u03b72ps < .05). Comparable results were obtained also when excluding the imputed observations, with significant main effects of retrieval process, p < .001, and of type of task, p = .003, and non-significant interaction, p = .80. 2 The sensitivity analysis performed showed that we were able to observe a Cohen\u2019s d > .48.\napproach: participants were asked to perform an autobiographical task and a concomitant task. 251 Two different concomitant tasks were employed, each one tapping different executive 252 functions. As already mentioned in previous recent studies (e.g., Barzykoski et al., 2019), both 253 direct and generative retrieval are voluntary in nature. However, differently from generative 254 retrieval (Conway, 2005, Conway & Loveday, 2010, Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), direct 255 retrieval has the phenomenological characteristic of being perceived as effortless and almost 256 automatic, even if intentional (Uzer et al., 2012, Uzer & Brown, 2017). As shown in previous 257 studies (e.g., Barzykoski & Staugaard, 2016; Barzykowski et al., 2019) processes involved in 258 autobiographical retrieval reflect a) intentionality vs. lack of intentionality; b) monitoring, and 259 c) effort. Direct retrieval is similar to generative retrieval because they both require initial 260 intention to retrieve and monitoring, but differs from it because in the former cognitive effort 261 is apparently absent. This is, however, just a phenomenological perception on the part of the 262 retriever. The aim of this study was to assess whether effort is indeed the discriminating variable 263 between direct and generative retrieval. If effort is absent, a dual-task that taxes cognitive 264 resources should not affect direct retrieval, but influence negatively generative retrieval. In 265 other words, we should have observed increased retrieval times for generative memories in one 266 of the concomitant tasks as compared with the no-dual task condition. Besides replicating 267 previous findings on the quantitative side (i.e., generative processes were slower compared with 268 direct ones), results indicated that the effects of the various conditions (i.e., no dual-task vs. 269 visual vs. non-visual) were comparable across the two retrieval processes, with participants 270 being slower in the visual condition regardless of the retrieval process. Specifically, this 271 conclusion was supported by the inclusion of Bayesian analyses, which allowed to estimate the 272 relative evidence supporting the null model vs. the alternative one. 273\nSeminal theories proposed that generative retrieval processes are essentially top-down and 274 reconstructive, while directive retrieval processes bypass such reconstructive components 275 (Haque & Conway, 2001). Alternatively, other perspectives proposed that both generative and 276 direct retrieval processes access pre-stored event representations, thus differing only in the time 277 needed to complete the retrieval, which is cue dependent (Uzer et al., 2012). Finally, more 278 recent perspectives proposed that both generative and directive retrieval processes are 279 constructive, but that they differ in the degree of subjective effort required (Harris & Berntsen, 280 2019). This subjective effort, which is thought to be reduced in direct retrieval processes, can 281 be defined across multiple cognitive levels, including: cue elaboration, semantic association, 282 memory construction, control processes, and inhibition of irrelevant information. The latter 283\nperspective predicts that tasks tapping on different executive functions should modulate the 284 retrieval time needed to fully recall the memory. Specifically, we should have observed 285 increased reaction times in the generative retrieve processes during the visual or the non-visual 286 condition. Conversely, our findings indicate that the speed of both generative and direct 287 retrieval processes varied similarly according to the dual-task condition, thus supporting the 288 cue-dependent perspective (Uzer et al., 2012). However, the present findings do not fully 289 corroborate the latter perspective, since the concomitant tasks employed here did not involve 290 all the possible sources of subjective effort listed by Harris and Berntsen (2019). 291\nRegarding the specific effects of the concomitant tasks employed here, the non-visual task 292 (random number generation; Towse & Neil, 1998) had no effect on both generative and direct 293 retrieval processes. This result is rather unexpected and, specifically, questions at some level 294 the effortful nature of generative retrieval. There is strong evidence in the literature that random 295 number generation tasks recruit executive functions, as they involve, for example, suppression 296 of habitual counting (e.g., Jahanshahi, Dirnberger, Fuller & Frith, 2000), interfere with 297 concomitant immediate serial recall and likely with task switching (e.g. Baddeley, 1998). 298 Overall retrieval time in generative processes might be longer as a function of the higher number 299 of steps involved in reaching specific memories. Thus, while automatic spreading of activation 300 is usually mentioned in the context of involuntary memories (Berntsen, 2009; Mace, 2007), it 301 could also play a role in voluntary memory retrieval as it can reach every level of the 302 autobiographical knowledge base (Mace, Clevinger, & Bernas, 2012). 303\nConversely, the visual concomitant task did significantly slow down both direct and generative 304 episodic retrieval by approximately 2s. When considering the negative effect of the visual task 305 on generative retrieval together with the ineffective random number generation task, at least 306 two possible explanations can be proposed. First, the visual task might demand more cognitive 307 resources than the random number generation task. However, we believe that the present 308 findings are driven by a specific visual interference, in which the visual modality of the task 309 interferes with the visual processes involved in retrieval from autobiographical memory. Visual 310 processes are strongly involved in autobiographical memory retrieval (e.g., Rubin, 2007), and 311 personal memories are typically very rich in visual details (Mazzoni, et al., 2014). Consistent 312 with this, several neuroimaging studies also reported greater activation in visual areas as 313 markers of autobiographical retrieval (e.g., left precuneus, left superior parietal lobule, and right 314 cuneus; Addis et al. 2004; Cabeza et al., 2004; Gardini et al., 2006; Greenberg & Rubin, 2003). 315\nIn addition, the slowing down of the RTs for direct retrieval due to a concomitant visual task 316 may be surprising given the assumed automatic and effortless nature of direct retrieval (Uzer et 317 al., 2012; Addis et al., 2012; Uzer, 2016). We need to point out that in previous work it was 318 suggested that direct retrieval may be largely based on visual processes, possibly even to a 319 greater extent than generative retrieval (Addis et al., 2012; Anderson et al., 2012). Therefore, 320 the current results of the visual concomitant task confirm the importance of visual processes in 321 direct retrieval. 322\nFinally, a few limitations need to be acknowledged. Firstly, although the sample size is 323 comparable with recent studies on the same topic (Mace et al., 2021) it could be considered not 324 sufficient to detect qualitative differences between generative and direct retrieval processes. 325 Secondly, and related to this, possible differences related to participants\u2019 nationality could not 326 be fully accounted for in the present study due to the low numerosity and the higher need for 327 statistical power. Additionally, in order to test the (possible) difference in subjective effort 328 required in directive vs. generative retrieval processes, future studies might employ other 329 concomitant tasks, such as priming tasks or go/no-go tasks. Another relevant future direction 330 could be related to the analysis of the semantic content of the words employed as cue, possibly 331 through the application of distributional semantic models (Gatti, Rinaldi, Marelli, Mazzoni, & 332 Vecchi, 2021; G\u00fcnther, Rinaldi, & Marelli, 2019). Thirdly, the overall amount of directly 333 retrieved memories is lower as compared with previous studies (e.g., Uzer et al., 2012), which 334 reported higher levels of directly retrieved memories. However, it should be noted that the 335 proportions found in our study fully corroborate the seminal Conway and Pledell-Pearce (2000) 336 model proposing that direct retrieval is an alternative retrieval route, but a rather rare one. 337 Finally, the requirements were to consider only specific memories as. Such requirement could 338 have influenced participants\u2019 performance as previous studies on involuntary memories have 339 shown that providing participants the need to select which memories to report could influence 340 their reports (e.g., Barzykowski et al., 2021; Vannucci et al., 2014). In our study, however, we 341 examined voluntary, not involuntary memories, and the decision to include such restrictive 342 requirement was driven by the need of homogeneity of the memories, which had to be specific 343 and not repeated to be eligible for this study. Future studies are required to replicate the present 344 findings possibly testing participants\u2019 memory using less restrictive requirements for the 345 retrieval reports. 346\nIn conclusion, in the present study, using a dual-task paradigm, we investigated quantitative 347 and qualitative differences between direct and generative retrieval processes. Results indicated 348\nthat the retrieval times of both direct and generative retrieval processes varied similarly 349 according to the dual-task condition, with the direct processes being faster compared with the 350 generative ones, thus supporting the idea that they differ only on the quantitative side. 351\n352\n353\nReferences 354\nAddis, D.
