    "abstractText": "In current clinical practice, a thorough understanding of vitamin D metabolism is in high demand both for patients with various diseases and for healthy individuals. Analytical techniques that provide simultaneous measurement of multiple metabolites are preferred. Herein, the development of an HPLC-DMS-MS/MS method for the quantitation of vitamin D compounds (25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and D3) in serum is described. The selected sample preparation procedure based on the combination of liquid\u2013liquid and solid-phase extraction, which excluded a lengthy derivatization step, was compared with other common approaches. Sensitivity was increased through the implementation of differential ion mobility separation. The proposed assay allowed us to determine the low abundant 1,25(OH)2D3 with the detection limit of 10 pg/mL. The validation study showed good linearity (r2 > 0.99), a wide analytical range (2.5\u201375 ng/mL for 25(OH)D3), and acceptable precision (<7%) for all metabolites. The recovery ranged from 71% to 93% and the matrix effect from 0.80 to 0.95 depending on the metabolite; accuracy determination was performed using DEQAS controls.",

            "text": "Growing clinical interest in the determination of vitamin D status is associated with its role not only in the regulation of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, but also in the proper functioning of other systems, such as immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive [1]. Despite the fact that these non-classical benefits to human health are still under discussion in the medical community [2], the need for accurate measurements of vitamin D forms is undeniable [3]. Either derived from the diet or synthesized in the skin, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is converted to 25(OH)D3 in the liver. Then, it is metabolized to the active form, 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), mostly in the kidneys. At the same time, 24-hydroxylated metabolites and epimers are formed [4]. In clinical practice, the main marker of vitamin D status is the major circulating form 25(OH)D3; however, for some disorders, all major metabolites should be quantified in order to provide proper diagnosis and therapy [5]. To assess vitamin D metabolism in patients, the most reliable technique to date is liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Other methods, mainly automated immunoassays, suffer inefficient vitamin D release, insufficient selectivity, and susceptibility to matrix interferences [6]. LC-MS/MS is not without drawbacks, but nonetheless, this method is considered a universal gold-standard assay for the measurement of vitamin D metabolites [7]. The determination of picogram quantities of calcitriol presents an analytical challenge that can be overcome if all stages of analysis (extraction from the biological matrix, separation from other metabolites and non-specific material, quantitation) are carefully designed. Since all metabolites in the serum are bound to the vitamin D\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8111. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098111 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8111 2 of 15\nbinding protein and albumin [8], they need to be released, typically by protein precipitation (PP) via the addition of organic solvents. Subsequently, an extraction step is carried out next for further purification, generally liquid\u2013liquid (LLE), solid-phase (SPE), or less frequently supported liquid (SLE) and salting-out-assisted liquid\u2013liquid extraction (SALLE) [9]. Some metabolites have the same m/z transitions; therefore, complete chromatographic separation of the analytes of interest needs to be achieved [10]. Proper resolution can be attained through the implementation of reversed-phase C-18, chiral, pentafluorophenyl (PFP), and CN columns in combination with aqueous\u2013organic mobile phases, normally water with formic acid, methanol, and acetonitrile [11]. As for detection, the most common ionization techniques are electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in the positive ion mode. A common solution to improving sensitivity is the addition of a derivatization step with Cookson-type reagents [12,13] during sample preparation (SP). However, the reagents are inactive and unstable in aqueous solutions, requiring a multi-step procedure, which increases the analysis time and makes automation impossible; moreover, during the Diels\u2013Alder reaction, two isomers are generated, so in most cases, two chromatographically resolved peaks are observed. Quite importantly, the use of derivatization reagents has detrimental effects on mass spectrometry equipment. It is recommended to perform quantitation using stable isotope internal standards (IS). Labeled analogs of each targeted metabolite help to correct for matrix effects and for possible procedural imprecisions and losses during sample extraction and purification [7]. The last essential aspect is the standardization of vitamin D measurement aimed at reducing inter-laboratory discrepancies. The Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS) and certified standard reference materials are available on the market to validate designed methods. Hence, this study aims (i) to propose a non-derivatized sample preparation optimized for 1,25(OH)2D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, and D3, and (ii) to demonstrate the advantages of using the SelexION differential mobility separation device installed between the ionization source and the vacuum interface of the mass spectrometer. We also present the analytical characteristics of the developed isotope dilution HPLCDMS-MS/MS method, and its validation using the DEQAS (25 hydroxyvitamin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D assays) controls."

            "text": "Extraction of vitamin D metabolites can be achieved using different variations of the common methods, namely protein precipitation (PP) and extractions LLE, SPE, and SLE [4,7], or combinations of these techniques. However, there is practically no comprehensive information on SP optimization for the main metabolites, including D3 itself, which do not rely on sample derivatization [14\u201317]. In this work, we used an approach that helps evaluate both the matrix effects and the extraction efficiency simultaneously in order to draw conclusions quickly and clearly. In the final step, serum samples that were spiked with the analytes and processed were reconstituted in the solution of internal standards in a methanol/water mixture consistent with the mobile phase initial gradient. Therefore, quantification of the analytes of interest allows us to determine the degree of extraction, and the examination of the internal standards helps draw a conclusion on the matrix effect. For example, consider three different SP techniques, namely protein precipitation with the help of methanol/mixture of methanol and an aqueous solution of ZnSO4 in combination with SPE [18], simple EtOAc LLE, and direct SPE (Agilent Bond Elut C18).\nInt.

As a possible solution, we suggest the addition of an LLE step to the SP procedure.

Looking at the data (Figure 2b), one can conclude that the most promising SP techniques are PP with ACN and ZnSO4 in combination with LLE (PP3_LLE) and EtOAc LLE followed by SPE.

Nevertheless, under the selected conditions, SALLE was characterized by the same selectivity as the PP with ACN and ZnSO4 in combination with LLE (limit of detection for 1,25(OH)2D3 was 25 pg/mL). The optimized sample preparation conditions included EtOAc LLE serum extraction, followed by organic layer drying and reconstitution in a methanol/water mixture, with the resulting solution being loaded onto an SPE (C18) cartridge, washed and eluted with methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in a methanol/water mixture and injected. Even though the procedure has been thoroughly studied, it was associated with the use of very large (450 \u00b5L) serum volumes for modern methods. We tried to overcome this problem (Procedure 2, Figure S2) and concluded that the 10 pg/mL limit of detection for 1,25(OH)2D3 was achievable by using a reduced sample volume (300 \u00b5L, Procedure 2)."

            "text": "2.3.1. The Fragmentation Patterns\nOne of the major technical details of the present work is the use of the differential mobility separation device. Previously, this technology was successfully applied for the determination of serum estrone, estradiol, and estriol [21]. The introduction of differential ion mobility has no effect on ion fragmentation since the SelexION separation device is installed between the ionization source and the vacuum interface of the mass spectrometer, thereby affecting only the transmission of precursor ion [22,23]. Therefore, the fragmentation patterns of vitamin D and its metabolites under ion mobility ESI experimental conditions are typical for soft ionization techniques (Figure 3). Let us emphasize the limited structural information that is given by collision-induced (CID) fragmentation of the vitamin D compounds. Not without restrictions, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry has proven to be more effective for interpreting fragmentation patterns [24]; however, for detailed chemical structure elucidation, LC-MS should be used to complement gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Classic hard electron ionization used in GC-MS methods [11,25] provides additional fragment ions required for structural characterization. Undoubtedly, LC-MS is a more convenient method for the quantitative determination of non-volatile and thermolabile vitamin D compounds. LC-MS mainly provides molecular ion information. During ESI, a slight fragmentation of the precursor ion is observed. APCI [26] and atmospheric pressure photoionization [4] may lead to more significant fragmentation of protonated molecules by the loss of neutral water molecules, thereby reducing the signal intensity and consequently the sensitivity of the method. It should be mentioned that some vitamin D metabolites have the same precursor ions or MRM transitions that make compounds such as 25(OH)D3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 indistinguishable by mass spectrometry (Figure 3). They should be completely separated chromatographically. Differential ion mobility spectrometry is unable to separate such ions completely, but it is efficient in the separation with isobaric interfering impurities, especially in cases where chromatographic separation is ineffective.\nInt.

The SelexION Advantage The final chromatogram, combining all main vitamin D metabolites, is presented in Figure 4a. 24,25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 are separated, as well as the epimers, which became possible thanks to the addition of acetonitrile (Table 2). This is the mandatory option in routine clinical methods for the quantification of vitamin D metabolites in human serum. Meanwhile, the proposed method is actively used for these purposes [27]. The following section aims to demonstrate how this approach was developed and why it can safely be called robust. Without the SelexION system, the quantitative determination of metabolites is possible with the exception of the low-concentrated 1,25(OH)2D3. The limit of detection for spiked randomized charcoal-purified serum was in this case only 25 pg/mL; in fact, this is the lowest value of the reference range according to literature data [5]. On top of that, in the real samples, such concentrations were not detectable without SelexION (Figure 4b); even the sample which was additionally spiked to the total content of 1,25(OH)2D3 of 270 pg/mL was not characterized by a significant peak when SelexION was not used.

            "text": "It is important to understand that although numerous studies have been devoted to the LC-MS/MS determination of vitamin D metabolites in serum and plasma, the ideal assay (universal, lab-to-lab accurate and reproducible, simple and rapid), still does not exist [7]. Sample preparation, chromatography, ionization, and fragmentation vary greatly among proposed approaches [2,7,9,29] (this list is not an exhaustive one, only representative review articles are cited), and method standardization has not yet been fully established. This sophisticated task requires that all sources of error are considered and mitigated in order to obtain reliable results. This report presents a novel HPLC-DMS-MS/MS approach for simultaneous quantitative analysis of six vitamin D compounds that combines two new strategies: the combination of LLE and SPE extractions of analytes from serum and the improvement in sensitivity by using differential ion mobility spectrometry. This paper describes the SelexION implementation for the determination of multiple vitamin D metabolites in biological fluids. SelexION technology aims to improve the characterization and limits of quantitation for challenging samples requiring advanced analytical selectivity for the separation from isobaric species and co-eluting contaminants. From the viewpoint of automatization, which is always an issue for high-throughput tasks, the proposed sample preparation is not the best decision. As a possible solution for making a fast, cost-effective procedure with minimum sample handling, online sample clean-up using a trap column may be evaluated in the future. The necessity for differentiating between vitamin D metabolites which are indistinguishable in the MS imposes certain requirements for chromatographic resolution. Along with isobaric analytes, some co-eluting isobaric matrix components create difficulties in the determination of dihydroxylated products at picogram levels. The widely used derivatization stage introduces additional steps to the sample preparation and might lead to spectrometer contamination. In the established non-derivatization techniques [14,15], either some MS-unfriendly reagents were utilized or an inappropriate dynamic range was proposed. Sensitive procedures based on protein precipitation and SPE-online [16], from our point of view, may be susceptible to frequent replacement of the trap column and possible carryover. Such an outcome is less likely because the proposed chromatographic program is well-built with enough washing time with organic solvents, which in turn increases the total run time up to 35 min. Moreover, not all chromatographic systems are well equipped to use the full loop mode with a big overfill factor. Therefore, we suggested using the common LLE with ethyl acetate followed by ordinary C18 SPE. The main objective of this study was to show that the not-so-widespread\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8111 9 of 15\ndifferential mobility separation device deserves the attention of scientific groups that work with low-concentrated analytes for which the effect of mass spectral interferences, both in terms of chromatographic overlap and impact on analyte response, is very high. The achieved analytical characteristics, such as good linearity (r2 > 0.99), acceptable precision (<7%), sufficient recovery (71\u201393%), and a low matrix effect (0.80\u20130.95) were within the current requirements of standard chemometrics for all the analytes [28]. The used linear ranges were 10\u2013300 pg/mL for 1,25(OH)2D3 and 0.32\u20139.6, 0.48\u201314.4, 0.75\u201322.5, 2.5\u201375, and 12.5\u2013375 ng/mL for 24,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D2, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D3, and D3, respectively, which were found to be in accordance with the latest approaches [30] and clinical reference ranges [27]. Trends similar to the DEQAS measurements indicated that the suggested assay can be applied to real serum samples. The method has already been successfully used for a comprehensive study of vitamin D metabolism in patients with hypoparathyroidism [27]. What is important to discuss here is that an advanced understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease is being developed mainly thanks to the improvement of LC-MS/MS methods. However, they are still the minority in routine clinical analysis, probably due to the fact that the accurate assessment of the vitamin D spectrum has more significant implications for research than for clinical practice. At the same time, steps toward the increased demand for serum vitamin D measurements in clinical pathology laboratories are taken."

Solutions of the external and internal standards were prepared by dissolving an exact mass of individual components in ethanol or methanol in glass vials at the concentration of 1 mg/mL. Then, the working methanol solutions of the internal standards with the concentrations of 15, 200, 200, 380, and 5000 ng/mL for 1,25(OH)2D3-d6, 24,25(OH)2D3-d6, 3-epi-25(OH)D3-d3, 25(OH)D3-d6, and D3-d7, respectively, were prepared. The individual solutions of the external standards were diluted in methanol to prepare a series of mixtures for calibration and quality control (QC) samples, which were added in the amount of 10 \u00b5L to 990 \u00b5L to randomized charcoal-purified serum in accordance with the previously described procedure [31] with the adjustment of the purification being performed with heating at 57 \u25e6C and in 3\u20134 cycles. The purity criterion of the obtained serum was the noise level of the signal at the expected retention times for each analyte. Eight points were used for calibration at the serum concentrations of 10\u2013300 pg/mL for 1,25(OH)2D3 and 0.32\u20139.6, 0.48\u201314.4, 0.75\u201322.5, 2.5\u201375, and 12.5\u2013375 ng/mL for 24,25(OH)2D3, 25(OH)D2, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D3, and D3, respectively. QC samples were prepared at three concentration levels: high QC level (HQC, 225 pg/mL for 1,25(OH)2D3), medium QC level (MQC, 150 pg/mL), low QC level (LQC, 30 pg/mL). All methanol solutions as well as spiked samples were stored at \u221280 \u25e6C and permitted to thaw for 15 min at room temperature immediately before use. Procedure 2. Serum extraction. A 50 \u00b5L aliquot of the deuterated internal standard mixture (25(OH)D3-d6, 1,25(OH)2D3-d6, 3-epi-25(OH)D3-d3, 24,25(OH)2D3-d6, and D3-d7) was added to 300 \u00b5L of serum, vortexed, and equilibrated for 5 min. Then, 900 \u00b5L of EtOAc was added, followed by extraction (15 min) and centrifugation (14,800 rpm, 6 min, 25 \u25e6C); next, the organic layer was isolated and dried using a vacuum centrifuge (40 \u25e6C, 1350 rpm, 5 mbar vacuum).

The cartridge was then washed with water followed by a 3:7 methanol/water mixture (1 mL of each), and analytes were eluted with 2 \u00d7 600 \u00b5L of methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness. A total of 115 \u00b5L of 1:1 methanol/water mixture was added to the residues; after 10 min of stirring in a shaker, samples were centrifuged (14,800 rpm, 10 min, 5 \u25e6C) and transferred to a 96-well plate. Salting-out assisted liquid\u2013liquid extraction approach. A 50 \u00b5L aliquot of the deuterated internal standard mixture was added to 300 \u00b5L of serum, vortexed, and equilibrated for 5 min. Then, 550 \u00b5L of ACN was added, and the sample was vortex mixed for 1 min and centrifuged (14,800 rpm, 1 min, 5 \u25e6C).

Sci. 2023, 24, 8111 12 of 15\naliquot of 0.05 M ZnSO4 (PP2_SPE procedure) or H2O (PP1_SPE procedure) and 550 \u00b5L of MeOH were added to 300 \u00b5L of serum, followed by 15 min of vortexing and centrifugation. Then, the supernatant was loaded onto an Agilent Bond Elut C18 cartridge preconditioned with 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of water. The cartridge was subsequently washed with water, followed by a 3:7 methanol/water mixture (1 mL of each), and the sample was eluted with 2 \u00d7 300 \u00b5L of methanol.

Procedure 4. All stages of protein precipitation followed by the SPE procedure (D3 issue). The individual solutions of external standards were diluted in methanol to prepare a mixture (10 ng/mL 1,25(OH)2D3, 10 mcg/mL D3) which was added in the amount of 10 \u00b5L to 990 \u00b5L of randomized charcoal-purified serum to obtain a spiked serum. Then, 150 \u00b5L of 0.1 M ZnSO4 and 700 \u00b5L of MeOH were added to 450 \u00b5L of the spiked serum, followed by 15 min of vortexing and centrifugation (the precipitate was preserved). Then, the supernatant was loaded (loading fraction was collected) onto an Agilent Bond Elut C18 cartridge preconditioned with 1 mL methanol and 1 mL water. The cartridge was subsequently washed with 1 mL of water followed by a 1 mL 3:7 methanol/water mixture (wash solution was collected), and samples were eluted with 2 \u00d7 300 \u00b5L or with 2 \u00d7 650 \u00b5L of methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge. To make the precipitate extract, 500 \u00b5L of water and 500 \u00b5L of EtOAc were added, followed by 30 min of vortexing and centrifugation, and then the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. To make the loading fraction extract, the solution collected during loading was first evaporated for 45 min to remove methanol, then 500 \u00b5L of EtOAc was added, followed by 15 min of vortexing and centrifugation, and then the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. To make the washing fraction extract, the solution collected during cartridge washing with 3:7 methanol/water was first evaporated for 30 min to remove methanol, then 500 \u00b5L of EtOAc was added, followed by 15 min of vortexing and centrifugation, and then the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. Methanol removal before cartridge loading: 150 \u00b5L of 0.1 M ZnSO4 and 700 \u00b5L of MeOH were added to 450 \u00b5L of the spiked serum, followed by 15 min of vortexing and centrifugation. Next, the supernatant was evaporated for 30 or 60 min and then loaded onto an Agilent Bond Elut C18 cartridge preconditioned with 1 mL methanol and 1 mL water. The cartridge was subsequently washed with 1 mL of water followed by a 1 mL 3:7 methanol/water mixture, and the sample was eluted with 2 \u00d7 650 \u00b5L of methanol. All residues were reconstituted in 110 \u00b5L of D3-d7 (9 ng/mL) in 1:1 methanol/water; the samples were centrifuged (14,800 rpm, 10 min, 5 \u25e6C) and transferred to a 96-well plate. Procedure 5. Protein precipitation followed by SPE vs. protein precipitation followed by LLE and LLE followed by SPE. Spiked serum and the sample for protein precipitation followed by SPE (PP2_SPE) were prepared as described in the previous procedure. Protein precipitation followed by LLE approaches: (1) 150 \u00b5L of 0.1 M ZnSO4 and 700 \u00b5L of MeOH (PP2_LLE procedure) were added to 450 \u00b5L of the spiked serum, followed by 15 min of vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was first evaporated for 60 min using a vacuum centrifuge (40 \u25e6C, 1350 rpm, 5 mbar vacuum) for methanol removal, and then 900 \u00b5L of EtOAc was added for a 15 min extraction followed by centrifugation; next, the organic layer was isolated and dried. (2) The PP3_LLE procedure was the same as the previous one, with the exception of 700 \u00b5L of ACN being used instead of MeOH during\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8111 13 of 15\nPP. (3) In the PP4_LLE procedure, only zinc sulfate was included\u201415 \u00b5L of 1.25 M ZnSO4 was added to 450 \u00b5L of the spiked serum, and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged. Then, 900 \u00b5L of EtOAc was added to the supernatant for a 15 min extraction followed by centrifugation; next, the organic layer was separated and dried. LLE followed by SPE (LLE_SPE procedure): 900 \u00b5L of EtOAc was added to 450 \u00b5L of the spiked serum for a 15 min extraction followed by centrifugation; next, the organic layer was isolated and dried. The residues were reconstituted in a 4:6 methanol/water mixture (1 mL), centrifuged, and the resulting liquid was loaded onto an Agilent Bond Elut C18 (50 mg, 1 mL) cartridge preconditioned with 0.5 mL methanol and 1 mL water. The cartridge was then washed with water followed by a 3:7 methanol/water mixture (1 mL of each), and the analytes were eluted with 2 \u00d7 650 \u00b5L of methanol. The eluate was evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge. All residues were reconstituted in 110 \u00b5L of D3-d7 (9 ng/mL) in 1:1 methanol/water, and the samples were centrifuged (14,800 rpm, 10 min, 5 \u25e6C) and transferred to a 96-well plate. Procedure 6. Partial validation. Method validation was carried out following the ICH guideline [28]. The accuracy (assessed by comparing the QC concentrations to the nominal value) and precision (characterized by RSD%) of the method were evaluated with 5 replicates at two concentration ranges (LQC and HQC), intra-day and inter-day (on three consecutive days), according to Procedure 2. To measure the matrix effect, a blank serum was processed (6 replicates) and spiked during the final reconstitution step with the IS and analyte mixtures at the required concentration level; standard solutions at the same concentration were also prepared in water and methanol. To assess the recovery, the analyte response in QC samples (6 replicates) at two concentrations (spiked with the analyte and processed) was compared with the response in a blank randomized charcoal-purified serum (processed and then spiked with the IS and analyte mixtures during reconstitution)."
