1. **Investigate the effect of different types of fly ash on CO2 adsorption capacity.** The current study only used one type of fly ash, but there are many different types of fly ash available, each with its own unique composition and properties. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels is affected by the type of fly ash used.


2. **Explore the use of different amine solutions for CO2 capture.** The current study used monoethanolamine (MEA) as the amine solution, but there are many other amine solutions that could be used. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels is affected by the type of amine solution used.


3. **Study the effect of different operating conditions on CO2 adsorption capacity.** The current study only investigated the effect of temperature on CO2 adsorption capacity. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels is affected by other operating conditions, such as pressure, flow rate, and humidity.


4. **Develop a mathematical model to describe the CO2 adsorption process.** The current study did not develop a mathematical model to describe the CO2 adsorption process. It would be interesting to develop a mathematical model that could be used to predict the CO2 adsorption capacity of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels under different operating conditions.


5. **Investigate the potential of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels for CO2 capture in real-world applications.** The current study only investigated the CO2 adsorption capacity of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels in a laboratory setting. It would be interesting to investigate the potential of FA-AAc/AAm hydrogels for CO2 capture in real-world applications, such as power plants and industrial facilities.
