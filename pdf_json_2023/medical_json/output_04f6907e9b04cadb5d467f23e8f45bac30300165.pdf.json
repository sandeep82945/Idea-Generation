    "abstractText": "Electron transport layer (ETL) plays an undeniable role in improving the performance of n-i-p planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is known as a promising ETL material for perovskite solar cell. In this work, the effect of annealing temperature on optical, electrical, and surface morphology of the electron-beam (EB)-evaporated TiO2 ETL, and consequently on the performance of perovskite solar cell, was investigated. It was found that annealing treatment at an optimized temperature of 480 \u25e6C considerably improved the surface smoothness, density of grain boundaries, and carrier mobility of TiO2 film, which resulted in nearly 10-fold improvement in power conversion efficiency (11.16%) in comparison with the unannealed device (1.08%). The improvement in performance of the optimized PSC is attributed to the acceleration of charge carrier extraction, as well as suppression of the recombination at the ETL/Perovskite interface.",

            "text": "Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as one of the emerging research trends for both the academic and industrial sectors in the past decade. PSCs offer intriguing optoelectronics properties such as long carrier life time, high absorption coefficient, intrinsic low trap density, and ambipolar transport properties [1\u20136]. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) chart, PSCs have demonstrated rapid progress in the performance enhancement from 3.8% [7] to a certified 25.7% [8]. Among the different components of PSC, the electron transport layer (ETL) plays a critical role in extracting and transporting photogenerated electron carriers and suppressing charge recombination in photovoltaic devices [9]. Therefore, interface engineering is now regarded as an efficient strategy to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cell devices by preventing the undesired degradation pathways [10]. This is mainly due to the fact that the photoinduced carriers not only have to transport across the interfaces in the cell but also charge extraction generally occurs at the interfaces, thereby leading to undesirable charge losses due to any possible interfacial defects and the associated specific charge distributions [10,11]. Recently, intensive efforts have been devoted to improving the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite layer, perovskite layer/hole transport layer, and the front and back contact interfaces [12\u201314]. Concurrently, various functional materials have been investigated to overcome the interfacial losses in PSC for performance enhancement. One\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1095. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14061095 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1095 2 of 13\nof the most attractive target materials is titanium dioxide (TiO2) due to its appealing advantages, such as high transparency, favorable bandgap edge positions in relation to perovskites, environmental stability, etc. For instance, Li et al. successfully grew an array of anatase-phase TiO2 nanorods on FTO conductive glass using a hydrothermal method, enabling a 15.3% efficiency for PSC [15]. Tian et al. fabricated a composite TiO2 ETL using a mixed spray pyrolysis method, demonstrating that TiO2 nanoparticles can promote the charge extraction process at the TiO2/perovskite interfaces and improve the recombination process in perovskite layers [16]. Very recently, magnetron sputtering technology on FTO glass was also used to fabricate different thicknesses and shapes of TiO2 ETL for PSC [17,18]. Electron beam (EB) evaporation of TiO2 has emerged as a promising and cost-effective approach for large-scale production of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) [19]. The annealing process for TiO2 probably plays a key role in the crystalline perovskite phase and subsequently the charge extraction process. However, previous studies have primarily focused on PSCs utilizing indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates and organic\u2013inorganic perovskite layers [20]. Considering the scarcity of indium, it is of greater practical significance to explore PSCs based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. Moreover, inorganic perovskite materials theoretically exhibit superior stability compared to their organic counterparts. Consequently, investigating the impact of annealing on the characteristics of perovskite solar cells prepared via EB evaporation of TiO2 on FTO substrates holds substantial importance. In this context, we have investigated the effect of annealing temperature on the optical, electrical, and morphological properties of EB-evaporated TiO2 films to be used in PSC devices. Upon varying the annealing temperature, we demonstrated the temperaturedependent morphology and opto-electronic properties of TiO2 as a ETL for PSC. The 480 \u25e6C-heat-treated TiO2 film led to the formation of a uniform and dense surface of TiO2 film with minimum defects and high carrier mobility. Notably, the PSC with TiO2 films annealed at 480 \u25e6C showed a significant increase in the fill factor (73%), which is 3.5 times higher than that of an unannealed device (16%). For the power conversion efficiency, an approximately 10-fold improvement (11.16%) for 480 \u25e6C annealed PSC was obtained as compared to the reference device (1.08%). To unveil the internal conversion mechanism, a detailed analysis of electrical properties and charge transfer at the TiO2/perovskite interface was also performed."

Before deposition, the chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 Pa and the substrate was heated to 350 \u25e6C. TiO2 particles were used as the source for evaporation, the deposition rate and film thickness were set at 0.5 \u00c5\u00b7s\u22121 and 75 nm, respectively, and oxygen was introduced during the deposition process while the pressure was kept at 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 Pa. Annealing of the TiO2 thin film was carried out in oxygen at 200 \u25e6C, 300 \u25e6C, 400 \u25e6C, 450 \u25e6C, 480 \u25e6C, and 500 \u25e6C for 2 h using a tube furnace, as shown in step 2 of Figure 1. A mixture of 380.4 mg HPbI3, 187.08 mg CsI, and 73.4 mg PbBr2 was dissolved in DMF and DMSO and filtered with a 0.2 \u00b5m syringe filter to form clear CsPbI3-xBrx solution.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by using an Edinburgh, FLS 980 fluorescence spectrometer under excitation at 375 nm.\n3. Results 3.1. Morphology Properties of TiO2 Films\nIn order to evaluate the surface morphology of TiO2 film, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (SPI3800N/SPA400, NSK, Tokyo, Japan), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) analyses were carried out on unannealed and annealed samples with different annealing temperatures ranging from 200 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C. As shown in Figure 2(A1\u2013A7), the surface roughness of the unannealed TiO2 film was 33.91 nm. As the TiO2 film underwent annealing treatment, the roughness decreased from 32.10 nm to 26.17 nm with an increase in annealing temperature from 200 \u00b0C to 480 \u00b0C, respectively. Surprisingly, as the annealing temperature rose from 480 \u00b0C to 500 \u00b0C, the roughness remained constant and is expected to increase further for higher temperatures. Figure 2(B1\u2013 B7) represents the top-view SEM characterization of unannealed and annealed TiO2 films. It was observed that the surface of TiO2 contained a combination of large (0.325\u20130.75 \u00b5m) and small grains (0.025\u20130.3 \u00b5m), along with some pinholes and voids in the range of 0.025 \u00b5m to 0.1 \u00b5m.\nFigure 1.

Therefore, it is assumed that 480 \u25e6C is an optimized annealing temperature resulting in the formation of TiO2 with a smooth surface with a minimum number of voids. This high-quality film is favorable for the development of crystals with regular shapes [21]. Figure 3 provides a schematic illustration of the reason behind the aforementioned phenomena. It is observed that prior to annealing treatment, the evaporated TiO2 film consists of tiny grains and a large number of surface defects comprising pinholes and small voids. Table 1 displays a proportion between voids and grain sizes as a function of annealing temperature. In the low-temperature mode, ranging from 200 \u25e6C to 400 \u25e6C, with increasing the annealing temperature, the number of small-sized grains outnumbered largesized grains. At the same time, the number of voids steady declined, which is assumed to be due to the gradually growing grains. Therefore, at 400 \u25e6C, the highest proportion of small-sized grains (88.00%) to large-sized grains (10.02%) was formed. In contrast, as the annealing temperature exceeded 400 \u25e6C, enough energy was provided for large grains to absorb nearby small-sized grains and become thermodynamically stable through lowering the surface free energy [22]. Therefore, in the second temperature mode, above 450 \u25e6C, the proportion of large-sized grains to small-sized grains was reversed, and at 500 \u25e6C, the highest number of large-size grains (21.8%) to small-sized grains (76.0%) was formed [22,23]. Moreover, the number of voids experienced a decreasing trend from 200 \u25e6C (4%) to 480 \u25e6C (0.7%) and rose again as annealing temperature exceeded 480 \u25e6C. The reason behind this phenomenon is associated with the difference between the surface tensions and thermal expansion coefficients of the various grains in the film [24]. Therefore, the grains started to break up and more voids occurred as the annealing temperature rose to 500 \u25e6C.\nTable 1.

To explore the causes behind the performance improvement of PSCs possessing TiO2 film with different annealing temperatures, the resistivity of unannealed and annealed TiO2 at various temperature ranging from 200 \u25e6C to 500 \u25e6C was measured as represented in Figure 4b. As is shown, the resistivity of unannealed TiO2 film was 1.34 \u2126\u00b7m, and as the annealing temperature raised from 200 \u25e6C to 480 \u25e6C, the resistivity of TiO2 film dropped from 1.30 \u2126\u00b7m to 0.10 \u2126\u00b7m, respectively, and then increased to 0.24 \u2126\u00b7m as the annealing temperature approached 500 \u25e6C. The series resistance of PSC is affected by several factors, including the resistivity of charge transport layers.

(b) EDS pattern of TiO2 thin film.\nElemental composition analysis of the TiO2 film was performed using Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) (S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Figure 5b shows the EDS spectra of the surface of TiO2 film annealed at 480 \u00b0C (for more details, please see Figure A1 in Appendix A). It is revealed that the surface of TiO2 film annealed at 480 \u00b0C contains less imperfections with the minimum ratio of titanium to oxygen 1:2. This minimum amount of imperfections provides less interfacial obstacles in the way of electron transition in crystal structure of the ETL TiO2 film [30]. The statistical analysis of the photovoltaic device involved the use of 20 devices. Among the different annealing temperatures, the TiO2 ETLs film annealed at 480 \u00b0C exhibited favorable characteristics, such as good surface coverage and smooth surface without gaps. These attributes contributed to the reduction in defect state density and the accumulation of interface charges, resulting in a decreased hysteresis effect (for more details, please see Table A1 and Figure A2 in Appendix A). To evaluate the long-term stability of the devices, they were stored and tested in ambient air humidity conditions at room temperature within the range of (20 \u00b1 5) \u00b0C and RH = 20 \u00b1 5%, without encapsulation. The findings reveal that the PSCs fabricated with TiO2 ETLs annealed at 480 \u00b0C exhibited notable advantages in terms of reliability, reproducibility, and overall performance (for more details, please see Figure A3 in Appendix A).\n3.3. Opto-Physical Properties Optical transparency of ETL is a critical factor determining the performance of n-i-pstructured PSC since it allows the incoming photons to pass though it and reach to the perovskite layer. Figure 6a shows the transmission spectra of TiO2 film with different annealing temperature in the wavelength range of 380 nm to 780 nm. Results show that all annealed samples exhibited an excellent optical transmittance with an average transmittance of above 85% in visible range of wavelength. The small change in optical transparency of TiO2 samples with constant thickness (75 nm) is assumed to be due to the difference in refractive index of samples, which is mostly associated with the grain size of TiO2 films [31]. We determined the optical band gap (Eg) of TiO2 films through the first derivative of transmissivity (T) in relation to energy (E) [32]. Figure 6b shows the effect of annealing temperature on the optical bandgap energy of the TiO2 film. It is evident that there is a slight difference in the optical bandgap of TiO2 film as a function of different annealing conditions. This result demonstrates that there is a negligible effect of annealing temperature on the optical characteristic of TiO2 film. Different annealing conditions easily cause changes in the structure and composition of TiO2 films, which in turn can affect their electronic structure and the energy required to excite an electron. For example, annealing at\nFigure 5. (a) Schematic diagra of the internal grain boundaries of TiO2.

Different annealing conditions easily cause changes in the structure and composition of TiO2 films, which in turn can affect their electronic structure and the energy required to excite an electron. For example, annealing at high temperatures can induce crystallization and grain growth, leading to changes in the crystal structure and defects within the film. Consequently, the annealing-treated TiO2 films result in a shift in the optical bandgap towards higher or lower energies. In general, the bandgap of a material decreases as the grain size increases, which are attributed to, the presence of grain boundaries in a polycrystalline material induce the defect states in the bandgap, which can act as trapping sites for electrons and holes. These defect states can then lead to a broadening of the bandgap, resulting in a decrease in the optical bandgap of the material. The decrease in bandgap with increasing grain size can be described by the quantum confinement effect, where the electronic states in the material are confined by the grain boundaries, leading to a change in the electronic band structure. The degree of quantum confinement is related to the grain size, with smaller grains resulting in a greater degree of confinement and a larger increase in bandgap. However, it is important to note that the relationship between grain size and bandgap can also be influenced by other factors, such as strain and doping. In some cases, an increase in grain size can lead to a decrease in strain, which can in turn lead to a decrease in the bandgap. Additionally, doping can introduce new electronic states into the bandgap, which can affect the bandgap energy and modify the relationship between grain size and bandgap.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13\nhigh temperatures can induce crystallization and grain growth, leading to changes in the crystal structure and defects within the film.

Figure 7 shows the steady-state PL spectra of CsPbI3-xBrx perovskite film coated with TiO2 with different annealing temperatures. As is observed, the PL luminescence intensity is maximized for TiO2 film without annealing treatment; however, as the annealing temperature is enhanced, the intensity of the PL peak is quenched and reaches its minimum value at 480 \u00b0C, indicating more effective electron extraction. The PL intensity is raised again when the annealing temperature reaches 500 \u00b0C. As is known, defects such as voids, grain boundaries, and vacancies that form at the interface between the TiO2 ETL and perovskite film can contribute to recombination loss [33]. Thus, TiO2 film annealed at 480 \u00b0C significantly minimizes the number of these trap states and consequently enhances the acceleration of the carrier\u2019s extraction from the perovskite layer. As the annealing temperature approaches 500 \u00b0C, this tendency is broken and the PL intensity is raised again due to an increase in the number of recombination sites, such as defects and voids, as shown in Table 1.\ni 6.

This analysis offers an additional perspective that aids in understanding the observed trend in the open-circuit voltage (Voc). SCLC is a useful technique for investigating carrier mobility and recombination properties in materials. In SCLC, when trap centers capture photogenerated free carriers, the density of free carriers decreases, resulting in a small current with a shallow slope at low bias voltage. However, as the voltage increases, all traps become filled. Beyond the inflection point, the current increases rapidly with a steeper slope, and this inflection point is known as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). The value of VTFL can be estimated by calculating the intersection point of the two slopes. Additionally, VTFL can be determined by the trap state density (Nt). The values of Nt for the TiO2 films before and after annealing at 200 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C, 450 \u00b0C, 480 \u00b0C, and 500 \u00b0C were calculated using the formula \ud835\udc49 = , resulting in 8.86 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, 7.67 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, 6.38 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, 6.27 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, 4.10 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, 3.13 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, and 4.10 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123, respectively.

Moreover, the decrease in defect state density suggests that the TiO2 film annealed at 480 \u00b0C exhibits better surface quality, with fewer ETL/perovskite interface recombination sites and defect centers, thereby minimizing the probability of interface recombination.\nFigure 8.

            "text": "In summary, we systematically investigated the effect of annealing temperature on electrical and morphological characteristics of EB-evaporated TiO2 thin film as ETL to improve the performance of n-i-p planar PSC. It was found that as the annealing temperature increased from 200 \u25e6C to 480 \u25e6C, the electrical and morphological properties of TiO2 film were improved, which resulted in higher performance of PSC. However, above 480 \u25e6C, the quality of TiO2 film was deteriorated, which led to lower performance of PSC. It was revealed that the TiO2 film annealed at 480 \u25e6C contained the lowest amount of surface defects and trap states, which resulted in minimum recombination loss of photogenerated carries. Transmission tests showed an average optical transmittance of above 85% in the visible range of wavelength for the TiO2 film annealed at 480 \u25e6C, and it was determined that the annealing temperature did not have any influence on the band gap of the TiO2 film. It was concluded that annealing treatment at 480 \u25e6C remarkably improved the quality of TiO2 ETL, resulting in a 3.5-fold improvement in FF and 10-fold increase in device PCE compared to an unannealed device. Our findings provide a straightforward method for improving the FF of perovskite solar cells at a low cost and on a large scale, establishing the groundwork for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.X. and D.C.; methodology, T.X.; validation, D.C. and T.L.; formal analysis, T.X. and F.Z.; investigation, T.X. and D.C.; data curation, D.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.X. and D.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, T.X., X.C., X.W., Z.T., F.Z., J.H., K.G. and A.V.T.

It was found that as the annealing temperature increased fro 200 \u00b0C to 480 \u00b0C, the electrical and orphological properties of TiO2 fil\nere i proved, hich resulted in higher perfor ance of PSC. o ever, above 480 \u00b0C, the quality of Ti 2 fil as deteriorated, hich led to lo er perfor ance of PSC. It as revealed that the Ti 2 fil annealed at 480 \u00b0 contained the lo est a ount of surface\nefects a tra states, ic res lte i i i rec i ati l ss f t e erate c rri s. r s issi t sts s r tic l tr s itt ce f i t\ni i l f l t f t i 2 l l t \u00b0 , it t i li t i i i 2 t ealing treatment at 480 \u00b0C remarkably improved the quality of TiO2 ETL, resulti g in a 3.5-fold improvement in FF and 10-fold increase in device PCE compared to an unanneal d d vice.
