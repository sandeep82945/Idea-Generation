            "text": "Intracellular bacteria are able to multiplicate inside host cells and manipulate their biology, 10 resulting in a number of globally serious infections including tuberculosis, endocarditis, 11 osteomyelitis, necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis.[1] Treatment often requires long-term and 12 intensive antibiotics administration; however, treatment failure and relapse are unfortunately 13 common.[2] As we currently understand it, the major reasons for the failure of clinical therapy 14 to eradicate intracellular bacteria include: (i) poor cellular membrane penetration, suboptimal 15 intracellular accumulation and short retention of antibiotics;[3] (ii) diminished antibacterial 16 activity of antibiotics because of the harsh acidic and hydrolytic environment within 17 phagolysosomes;[4] (iii) intracellular bacteria being in a dormant state and tolerance of 18 otherwise lethal concentration of antibiotics;[5] (iv) bacteria escape from phagolysosomes and 19 hide in privileged intracellular compartments that evade the bactericidal actions of antibiotics.[6] 20 At later timepoints, potentially after cessation of therapy, the bacteria may then proliferate 21 resulting in the apoptosis and autophagy of the cells. The evasive bacteria re-enter the 22 circulation or re-infect local tissues.[7] As such, the infected cells have been likened to \u201cTrojan 23 horses\u201d that protect bacteria with later dissemination of the infection into deeper tissues.[8] 24 Drug delivery systems (DDSs) have shown increasing potential for the treatment of intracellular 25 bacterial infection.[9] The most common approach is increasing specificity of the DDS to 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n3\nfacilitate cellular antibiotics accumulation.[10] They are functionalized by cellular targeted 1 ligands, such as mannose and galactose, for the effective intracellular delivery of antibiotics.[9c, 2 11] In order to improve the stability of the antibiotics within the cells, the controlled release of3 antibiotics in responding to natural stimuli (e.g. pH, enzyme, redox) has been described.[12] 4 However, these approaches may not work when the intracellular bacteria are in a dormant state 5 or hiding in the vacuole, in which the intracellular bacteria are able to withstand high-dose 6 antibiotics.[13] To fight against these stubborn bacteria, delivering antibiotics to the bacterial 7 residing locations is considered to be a more feasible approach. To date, the study of on-site 8 antibiotic delivery via intracellular bacteria targeting is still in its infancy.[14] Thus, such an 9 approach, targeting both the host cells and intracellular bacteria in a cascade, could offer 10 optimal efficacy against intracellular bacterial infection.[15] 11 Recently, we synthesized a series of poly(N-acryloyl amino acid)s using a robust photo-induced 12 RAFT polymerization technique.[16] The poly(N-acryloyl amino acid)s are considered 13 promising DDSs because of their excellent biocompatibility and tunable morphologies and 14 functionalities.[17] Moreover, the poly(N-acryloyl amino acid)s display an appealing drug 15 loading efficiency as their abundant non-covalent interactions with drugs.[17a] With this 16 inspiration, here we proposed a new protocol to cascade-target intracellular methicillin-resistant 17 Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and on-site deliver antibiotics based on poly(N-acryloyl amino 18 acid) (Scheme 1). Different from previous studies, \u03b2-N-acryloyl-D-aminoalanine was firstly 19 used as the key monomer to synthesize poly(\u03b1-N-acryloyl-phenylalanine)-block-poly(\u03b2-N-20 acryloyl-D-aminoalanine) (denoted as FA), which was in favor of introducing high-density D-21 aminoalanine pendants. Subsequently, mannose was conjugated with \u03b1-amino of the D-22 aminoalanine pendants via Schiff base to prepare mannose-decorated poly(\u03b1-N-acryloyl-23 phenylalanine)-block-poly(\u03b2-N-acryloyl-D-aminoalanine) (denoted as FAM). Rifampicin (Rif), 24 a hydrophobic antibiotic, was then loaded into assembled FAM nanoparticles (NPs) and 25 fabricated a novel cascade-targeting DDS (namely Rif@FAM NPs). The Rif@FAM NPs 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\npreferentially entered macrophages by a mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis process, 1 increasing intracellular accumulation of Rif. The subsequent pH-triggered detachment of the 2 mannose in the acidic phagolysosomes led to the formation of Rif@FA NPs. Sequentially, the 3 exposed D-aminoalanine moieties then enabled the resulting Rif@FA NPs to escape into the 4 cytoplasm and anchor the MRSA by peptidoglycan-specific binding. On-site Rif@FA NPs 5 released the Rif precisely regardless of the states and locations of the intracellular MRSA, 6 overcoming antibiotics tolerance. Furthermore, Rif@FAM NPs modulated the innate immune 7 responses of macrophages by up-regulating the M1/M2 polarization to reinforce the 8 antibacterial effect. Therefore, this cascade-targeting DDS, enabling on-site antibiotic delivery 9 and precise antibacterial treatment, could greatly improve the therapeutic efficiency of stubborn 10 intracellular bacterial infections. 11\n12 13 14 15\nScheme 1.

Poly(\u03b2-N-acryloyl-D-aminoalanine acid) (PA) as the bacteria targeting ligand. 3. Mannose as the macrophage targeting ligand.

The exposed D-2 aminoalanine moieties steer the resulting Rif@FA NPs to escape into the cytoplasm. iii) 3 Rif@FA NPs anchor the intracellular bacteria by peptidoglycan-specific binding. iv) Rif@FA 4 NPs release the Rif to kill intracellular bacteria. v) Up-regulation of M1/M2 polarization. 5 6 2. Results and Discussion7 2.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Polymers and DDS 8 The synthesis and assembly of the cascade-targeting DDS were shown in Figure 1A. The 9 amphiphilic FAM copolymer was synthesized by two-step reactions. First, poly(N-acryloyl 10 amino acid), i.e. poly(\u03b1-N-acryloyl-phenylalanine)-block-poly(\u03b2-N-acryloyl-\u03b1-Boc-D-11 aminoalanine) (denoted as FABoc), was synthesized using photoinduced electron/energy 12 transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization 13 technique (Scheme. S1).[17a] \u03b1-N-acryloyl-phenylalanine and \u03b2-N-acryloyl-\u03b1-Boc-D-14 aminoalanine were used as the monomers and synthesized in an amidation reaction, confirming 15 by 1H/13C NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectra (Figure S1). Poly(\u03b1-N-acryloyl-16 phenylalanine) (denoted as PF) was synthesized by PET-RAFT polymerization using 2-17 (dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid (DDMAT) as RAFT agent, tris[2-18 phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) as photo-initiator and \u03b1-N-acryloyl-19 phenylalanine as monomers. Subsequently, the obtained PF was applied as the micro-RAFT 20 agent to the synthesis of FABoc copolymer. According to the 1H NMR and GPC, the molecular 21\nweights of PF and FABoc were calculated to be ~7100 g mol \u20131 (Mw/Mn = 1.3) and ~11000 g mol \u201322 1 (Mw/Mn = 1.4, Figure S2 and S3, Table S1), respectively; For FABoc, the ratio of 23 polymerization degree between PF and poly(\u03b2-N-acryloyl-\u03b1-Boc-D-aminoalanine) segments 24 was 28:14 (Figure S2). During the second step, the protection group Boc was removed to 25 release free \u03b1-amino groups in FA, which was further functionalized by ring-opened mannose 26 via Schiff base. 1H NMR analysis confirmed there were 8 mannose molecules binding with FA, 27 namely FAM (Figure S2). FTIR and XPS spectra further verified the successful grafting of 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\nmannose (Figure S4). Meanwhile, the single-targeting control polymers for either 1 macrophages-targeted purpose (i.e., poly(\u03b1-N-acryloyl-phenylalanine)-block-poly(2-(\u03b1-D-2 mannosyloxy) ethyl acrylate), denoted as FM) or bacteria-targeted purpose (FA) were 3 synthesized and characterized using the similar method (Figure S2 and S5). 4 Rif@FAM NPs were prepared via self-assembly of FAM in a solvent system of DMSO/water 5 (1/9, v/v) containing Rif (Figure 1A). Blank FAM NPs were prepared as control and exhibited 6 uniform spherical morphology (Figure 1B) with an average diameter of 250 nm as revealed by 7 DLS (Figure 1C). After loading Rif, the obtained Rif@FAM NPs maintained their spherical 8 morphology (Figure 1B) with a slightly increased diameter of 280 nm (Figure 1C). Their zeta 9 potentials varied from \u201329.4 to \u201330.6 mV after loading Rif (Figure 1D). Meanwhile, the 10 corresponding FA and FM NPs were prepared and characterized according to the same methods 11 and exhibited similar characteristics (Figure S6). The results of the stability test showed that 12 there was no significant change in both the size and the polymer dispersity index (PDI) of 13 Rif@FAM NPs over 30 days (Figure 1E and S7), suggesting good stability of the DDS. The 14 drug loading content of Rif@FAM NPs reached up to ~18.9 wt% (Table. S2). Drug release 15 profiles of Rif@FAM NPs were further investigated (Figure 1F). Solvents with different pHs 16 were selected to mimic the phagolysosomes environment.[18] It revealed that the Rif was 17 continuously released from Rif@FAM NPs for more than 1 month with the pH between 5.0 18 and 7.4. Compared with Rif@FAM NPs, free Rif exhibited a rapid drug release property. 19 Approximately 87.7% of Rif was released from free Rif group in 12 h (Figure S8). This implied 20 21 22 23 24 25 that Rif@FAM NPs would be in favor of eliminating intracellular bacteria by longterm continuous antibiotics release. Besides, release efficiency increased in a lower pH environment, attributed to the detachment of mannose from FAM through Schiff base dissociation.[19] In order to confirm this hypothesis, 1H NMR was used to investigate the chemical structure of the FAM before and after the treatment of acidic solution at pH 5.0. The\nresults showed that the peaks of the mannose group sharply decreased, demonstrating the stimuli-responsive characteristic of\n26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\n7\nFAM (Figure 1G). Additionally, Rif@FAM NPs exhibited decreased sizes and increased zeta 1 potentials at pH 6.4 and 5.0 compared with pH 7.4, also confirming the detachment of mannose 2 (Figure 1H and S9). Nevertheless, Rif@FAM NPs could maintain a stable size distribution 3 after the detachment of the mannose groups in the harsh acidic environment. One interesting 4 phenomenon was that a dramatic decline of the drug release rate was exhibited at pH 4.2 5 (Figure 1F), most likely attributed to the aggregation of FAM NPs.[20] Turbidity study further 6 revealed that FAM NPs were soluble under neutral conditions as well as in highly acidic 7 conditions (pH < 2.2); but at pH 2.2-4.5, they were insoluble (Figure S10). This was consistent 8 with the result of the increased size of Rif@FAM NPs at pH 4.2 (Figure S11). 9\n10\nFigure 1. Characterization of copolymers and DDS.

Mannose-Mediated Endocytosis In vitro 1 First, the cytotoxicity of Rif@FAM NPs towards Tohoku Hospital Pediatrics-1 (THP-1) 2 macrophages and human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293) cells was tested. Rif@FAM 3 NPs showed low cytotoxicity at wide-range Rif dosages \u2264 40 \u03bcg mL\u20131 (Figure S12), indicating 4 their cytocompatibility. Subsequently, Nile Red (NR), as a model dye, was encapsulated into 5 the NPs (i.e. NR@FAM and NR@FA NPs) to monitor the time-dependent cellular uptake by 6 confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). THP-1 macrophages were labeled by NR@FAM 7 NPs after 0.5 h incubation and prolonged incubation to 2 h led to a significant increase of the 8 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI, Figure 2A and 2B), which was ~2.3 times higher than that 9\nof the control group, NR@FA NPs (without mannose modification, ****, p = 0.000003, Figure 10 2B). Further extending incubation time (4, 8, 12 h), the cellular uptake of NR@FAM NPs 11 showed a time-dependent enhancement, while that of NR@FA NPs reached saturation at 8 h 12 (Figure 2C and S13), suggesting the specific internalization of NR@FAM NPs. To validate 13 the mannose-mediated endocytosis pathway of NR@FAM NPs in macrophages, a competitive 14 inhibition experiment was conducted.[21] Free mannose was used as an endocytosis inhibitor 15 and co-incubated with THP-1 for 1 h before treatment with NR@FAM NPs. Free mannose 16 significantly inhibited the cellular uptake of NR@FAM NPs, showing a dose-dependent 17 inhibitory effect (Figure 2D and S14), whereas it had no effect on the internalization of 18 NR@FA NPs (Figure S14). These results demonstrated that the mannose inhibitor 19 competitively prevented the entry of NR@FAM NPs by occupying mannose receptors on the 20 surfaces of THP-1 macrophages. 21 To examine the selective targeting ability of NR@FAM NPs towards macrophages,[22] we 22 further investigated their cellular uptake in THP-1 and HEK293 cells co-culture system. THP-23 1 macrophages were stained with green fluorescence by calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein 24 AM) prior to co-culture with HEK293 cells. The NR@FAM NPs were then added to the THP-25 1 and HEK293 co-culture plate. After 0.5 h incubation, the red signals of NR@FAM NPs 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n9\ncoexisted with the calcein AM green positive THP-1 macrophages, whilst only weak red 1 fluorescence signals were observed in HEK293 cells (Figure 2E). After 1 h incubation, most 2 of the NR@FAM NPs were found in the THP-1 macrophages, showing strong fluorescence 3 intensity, while extremely low fluorescence intensity was detected in HEK293 cells (white 4 arrows in Figure 2E). Fluorescence co-localization between NR@FAM NPs and THP-1 5 macrophages was analyzed by software image J. The red signals of NR@FAM NPs overlayed 6 well with the green signals of the THP-1 macrophages. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC) 7 and overlap coefficient value (OCV) were higher than ~60%, and reached up to ~80% at 1 h 8 co-incubation (Figure 2F-G). These results strongly suggested that the proposed FAM DDS 9\nhas excellent macrophage-targeting activity. 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n10\n1\nFigure 2.

Bacterial Targeting and Extracellular Antibacterial Activity 4 D-alanine is the basic unit of bacterial peptidoglycan. D-alanine and its analogs (e.g. D-5 aminioalanine) are well-established peptidoglycan-targeting molecules for antibacterial 6 chemotherapy.[23] Thus, bacterial targeting of the designed NPs with the presence of D-7 aminoalanine moieties was investigated. In terms of this, FA NPs were selected to perform this 8 investigation since they were formed through the detachment of the mannose after the cellular 9 uptake (Figure 3). It was observed by the SEM images that many more FA NPs anchored on 10 the surface of MRSA after co-incubation when compared to the control group without FA NPs 11 treatment (Figure 3A). It was also demonstrated by the TEM images, showing a rough 12 membrane edge of the MRSA with FA NPs treatment (Figure 3B). Subsequently, co-13 localization of FA NPs and MRSA was analyzed by CLSM to further validate bacterial 14 targeting.[24] The NR@FA NPs exhibited red fluorescence signals (Figure 3C), and overlapped 15 well with MRSA in green fluorescence signals stained by FITC (Figure 3D and S15), 16 suggesting a good targeting effect of FA NPs contrast to FM NPs (Figure S16). Previous studies 17 have revealed that macromolecules or peptides containing D-alanine terminal can insert into 18 the bacterial cell wall and interface the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan of bacteria.[25] To 19 demonstrate the effect of bacterial dormant states on the targeting property of FA NPs, a 20 temperature-regulated phagocytosis experiment was carried out (Figure 3E and S17). FITC 21 dye loaded FA NPs (denoted as FITC@FA NPs) were co-incubated with MRSA at 37oC. The 22 fluorescence intensity of MRSA significantly enhanced with the increase of co-incubation time. 23 But, as the incubation temperature decreased to 4oC, the fluorescence intensity was significantly 24 decreased (*, p = 0.04 at 0.5 h and *, p = 0.02 at 3 h). This was mainly due to the growth arrest 25 of MRSA at low temperature; whereby the metabolism of peptidoglycan and the phagocytosis 26 of the FITC@FA NPs would be slowed down.[26] Nevertheless, the interaction between 27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n12\nFITC@FA NPs and bacteria could be continuously enhanced regardless of the bacterial growth 1 period. Furthermore, FA NPs would competitively inhibit the growth of MRSA. In the presence 2 of FA NPs, the bacterial proliferation was suppressed in the logarithmic growth phase. Growth 3 inhibition increased with increasing concentration of FA NPs (Figure 3F), suggesting that FA 4 NPs could competitively inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis by blocking the receptor of 5 D-alanine. 6\n7\nFigure 3.

The results indicated that the MIC values of Rif@FA, Rif@FAM NPs, 7 and the free Rif were 7 ng mL\u20131 (Figure S18), but the CFUs treated by Rif@FA NPs were 8 significantly lower than that of free Rif under 2 \u00d7 MIC and 5 \u00d7 MIC (**, p = 0.004 for 2 \u00d7 MIC 9 and ****, p = 0.00006 for 5 \u00d7 MIC, Figure 3G and 3H), implicating the good killing effect of 10 Rif@FA NPs against MRSA. Rif@FAM NPs showed similar antibacterial performance with 11 Rif@FA NPs (ns, p = 0.62 and 0.05 for 2 \u00d7 and 5 \u00d7 MIC, respectively) because of mannose 12 detachment from FAM NPs under the bacterial acidic microenvironment.[27] SEM analysis 13 (Figure S19) further confirmed that Rif@FA and Rif@FAM NPs could anchor the cell wall of 14 MRSA and exhibited antibacterial effect by disrupting or deforming the membranes of MRSA. 15"

            "text": "Intracellular MRSA targeting of FAM NPs was characterized using in-situ/ex-situ co-17 localization assays. First, the NR@NPs were incubated for 24 h with THP-1 macrophages pre-18 infected with FITC-labeled MRSA, and the nuclei of the THP-1 cells were stained with blue 19 fluorescence by DAPI after co-incubation. As shown in Figure 4A, MRSA successfully 20 infected THP-1 cells and dispersed in the cytoplasm. The distributions of NR@FAM NPs 21 depended on the locations of MRSA. The red fluorescence signals of NR@FAM NPs matched 22 well with the green fluorescent of MRSA, exhibiting a bright yellow fluorescence when merged. 23 Three-dimensional CLSM showed that NR@FAM NPs bound with MRSA in stereo space 24 vision (Figure 4B), further confirming intracellular MRSA targeting of NR@FAM NPs.[28] In 25 contrast, NR@FM NPs evenly distributed around the nuclei of THP-1 cells, regardless of the 26 locations of intracellular MRSA. Three-dimensional renderings clearly showed that the 27 fluorescence signals between NR@FM NPs and MRSA did not overlap (Figure 4B). NR@FM 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n14\nNPs could target THP-1 macrophages by mannose-receptor, but they could not specifically 1 track the invading MRSA because there was no specific binding effect with the absence of D-2 aminoalanine moieties. Subsequently, MRSA-infected THP-1 macrophages were lysed by 3 0.1% Triton X-100, and the intracellular MRSA were extracted and detected by CLSM (Figure 4 4C). Interestingly, CLSM images showed a perfect fluorescence overlap between NR@FAM 5 NPs and the MRSA despite the intensive processes of lysis and extraction. This implied that 6 high-density D-aminioalanine enhanced the binding ability between NR@FAM NPs and 7 MRSA, excluding the possibility of off-targeting effects. Conversely, NR@FM NPs were in 8 separate compartments with the MRSA, and MRSA-FM co-localization was rarely observed 9 (Figure 4C). Quantitative analysis by flow cytometry assay revealed that the MFI of the 10 intracellular MRSA in the group of NR@FAM NPs was ~3 times higher than that of NR@FM 11 NPs (Figure 4D). Corresponding TEM images further confirmed that plenty of NR@FAM NPs 12 bound to the surface of the intracellular MRSA, suggesting specific intracellular-bacteria 13 targeting of NR@FAM NPs (Figure 4E). In situ TEM imaging for the MRSA-infected THP-1 14 macrophages showed that MRSA in phagolysosomes of macrophages maintained a complete 15 and clean cell wall (Figure 4F). After FAM NPs treatment, they were observed to bind on the 16 surface of the invading MRSA (blue arrows in Figure 4G). But for FM NPs treatment, no NPs 17 could be found around the intracellular MRSA (Figure 4H). To further determine drug delivery 18 capacity of FAM NPs, MRSA-infected THP-1 macrophage treated with Rif@FAM NPs was 19 observed by in situ TEM (Figure S20). After Rif@FAM NPs treatment, the infected 20 macrophage exhibited a complete cellular morphology with abundant bacterial fragments in its 21 phagolysosomes. Differently, the infected macrophage treated with Rif@FM NPs was in a 22 collapse state accompanied by survival MRSA. Such in-situ/ex-situ co-localization 23 characteristics further confirmed the effective binding property of FAM DDS, demonstrating 24 the FAM DDS possessed an intriguing feature of on-site antibiotic delivery. 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n15\n1\nFigure 4.

MRSA (yellow arrows); cell wall (green arrows); FAM NPs (blue arrows). 8 9\nBecause of the ability of FAM NPs to efficiently target intracellular MRSA, we investigated 10 their intracellular locations by monitoring the endocytic process of FTIC loaded FAM NPs 11 (denoted as FITC@FAM NPs, Figure 5A). Their intracellular locations were confirmed by co-12 localization with lysosomes, which were marked in red fluorescence by Lyso-Tracker Red dye. 13 By fluorescence imaging, we found that the FITC@FAM NPs mainly accumulated in the 14 cytoplasm in the first 0.5 and 1 h (Figure 5A). Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signals 15 revealed the overlap between FITC@FAM NPs and lysosomes was ~40% (Figure 5B). With a 16 longer incubation time, an increasing amount of FITC@FAM NPs was accumulated in 17 lysosomes. Their co-localization reached up to ~60% after 6 h incubation, suggesting that 18\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n16\nlysosomes were the main intracellular locations of FITC@FAM NPs. Extending the incubation 1 time to 24 h, the amount of FITC@FAM NPs in lysosomes reduced to ~38%, while more 2 FITC@FAM NPs were found in the cytoplasm (Figure 5A), implying that FITC@FAM NPs 3 could be further transported into the cytoplasm of macrophages.[29] This result was most likely 4 attributed to the detachment of mannose from FAM NPs in the acidic environment of lysosomes. 5 The exposed amino groups in the resulting FA NPs boosted zeta potential (Figure S9) and 6 facilitated the transportation of the NPs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm,[30] which was crucial 7 to exert cascade-targeting properties against intracellular infection. 8 Based on the results of the cellular internalization and extracellular antibacterial assays, we 9\nexamined whether the novel cascade-targeting properties of Rif@FAM NPs are effective for 10 killing intracellular bacteria (Figure 5C and 5D). THP-1 macrophages infected with MRSA 11 were treated with Rif@FAM NPs and then analyzed by colony counting. Macrophage-targeted 12 Rif@FM NPs, bacteria-targeted Rif@FA NPs, free Rif, and PBS were used as control groups. 13 The concentration of Rif was set at 14 ng mL\u20131 (2 \u00d7 MIC). Intracellular MRSA were suppressed 14 in the presence of Rif at 12 h when compared with that in PBS group (##, p < 0.01, Figure 5D). 15 Additionally, the groups of Rif@FAM and Rif@FM NPs showed higher inhibition ability than 16 the free Rif at 24 h incubation, most likely due to their specific targeting of macrophages. 17 Interestingly, Rif@FA exhibited higher intracellular MRSA elimination performance than 18 Rif@FM. This implied that penetrating across the cell membrane is critical, but routing 19 antibiotics to the bacterial compartments may be more important for killing intracellular 20 bacteria. Increasing the co-incubation time to 48 h, free Rif lost control of bacterial proliferation 21 owing to its limited dosages and instability in the cells. In comparison, Rif@FAM NPs 22 exhibited the highest intracellular bacterial inhibition efficacy (Figure 5D, ***, p = 0.0006 and 23 **, p = 0.007 corresponded to the groups of Rif@FM and Rif@FA NPs, respectively). This 24 attributed that Rif@FAM NPs went through a novel cascade-targeting process and eliminated 25 intracellular MRSA effectively via on-site Rif delivery. 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n17\nIntracellular bacteria could resist the innate immune elimination by preventing pro-1 inflammatory macrophages polarization (M1, related to high antibacterial activity) and 2 accelerating anti-inflammatory macrophages polarization (M2, produced inhibitory 3 cytokines).[31] To determine whether the promising DDS modulates the polarization status of 4 the infected macrophages, THP-1 macrophages were infected with MRSA and further treated 5 with Rif@FAM NPs, Rif and PBS. Flow cytometry assay revealed that Rif@FAM NPs slightly 6 up-regulated CD80 (an M1 marker) expression; whereas significantly down-regulated CD206 7 (an M2 marker, #, p = 0.025) expression in MRSA-infected THP-1 macrophages (Figure 5E 8 and S21). The up-regulated M1/M2 polarization reinforced the bacterial elimination ability of 9 the infected macrophages. Additionally, the expression of representative immune cytokines 10 TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 produced by M1 and M2 macrophages were further investigated. Appropriate 11 but not overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 is in favor of the production of antibacterial molecules;[32] 12 while high expression of IL-10 drives bacterial replication.[33] Rif@FAM NPs slightly increased 13 TNF-\u03b1 production and showed a notable decrease in IL-10 production compared with the PBS 14 (##, p = 0.007) and free Rif group (****, p = 0.0000002, Figure 5F). Based on these results, we 15 proposed that Rif@FAM NPs exhibited superior efficacy for eliminating intracellular bacteria 16 via a synergistic effect, including cascade-targeting drug delivery and up-regulated M1/M2 17 polarization of macrophages. 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n18\n1\nFigure 5.

In vivo Real-Time Tracking and Antibacterial Efficacy 11 The toxicity of FAM and Rif@FAM NPs in vivo was then evaluated. Female Balb/c mice (6-7 12 weeks) were treated with intravenous (i.v.) injection of the therapeutic dose (10 mg kg\u20131) once 13 every 2 days for 2 weeks. There was no death or loss of weight in all treatment groups (Figure 14 S22). After 2 weeks, the blood biochemistries of all the tested mice were analyzed. All 15 indicators, including aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, 16\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n19\ngamma-glutamyl transferase, and blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, total protein, creatinine, 1 and total bilirubin, were similar to the control group, and showed no significant difference 2 (Figure S22). Besides, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the major organs (heart, liver, 3 spleen, lung, kidneys) exhibited normal histomorphology and no significant pathological 4 abnormality (Figure S23), suggesting that FAM and Rif@FAM NPs possessed good 5 biocompatibility. Additionally, in vivo distribution of FAM NPs was assessed. Mice were i.v. 6 injected with Cy7.5-loaded FAM NPs (denoted as Cy7.5@FAM NPs), and monitored with an 7 in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Cy7.5 signals were observed in the liver and spleen in 1 h and 8 enhanced after 6 h treatment, whereas very weak signals were observed in other organs (Figure 9\nS24). 10 To evaluate the in vivo targeting property of FAM NPs, a muscle infection model was used to 11 determine the in vivo real-time distribution of FAM NPs.[34] As shown in Figure 6A, PBS (100 12 \u03bcL) and MRSA (5\u00d7107 CFU/mouse, 100 \u03bcL) were injected intramuscularly into the left thigh 13 and right thigh (namely uninfected and infected site), respectively. After 24 h treatment, 14 Cy7.5@FAM NPs were administrated via i.v. injection and imaged by IVIS. Evident 15 fluorescence signals were observed mainly distributing around the liver and the infected site at 16 1 h post-injection due to the EPR effect and cascade-targeting properties of FAM NPs (Figure 17 6B). Compared to the uninfected site, the fluorescence signal of the infected site showed a 18 gradual increase along with increasing time and finally reached the strongest at 24 h (Figure 19 6C). The major organs and tissues were collected for imaging after 24 h treatment. The ex vivo 20 biodistribution data indicated that Cy7.5@FAM NPs were mainly distributed in the liver, 21 kidney, lung and the infected site (Figure 6D and 6E). The MFI of the infected site was over 22 10-fold more than that of the uninfected site (*, p = 0.03), suggesting FAM NPs could retain at23 the MRSA infected site by the specific targeting properties. All these results demonstrated that 24 FAM-based DDS achieved on-site drug delivery in vivo. 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n20\nThe in vivo antibacterial efficacy of the DDS was evaluated in MRSA-induced peritonitis 1 (Figure 6F); one of the representative intracellular infection models that is regarded as \u201cserious 2 threats\u201d by the U.S. CDC.[35] Different treatments were administered by peritoneal injection. 3 After 24 h of the infection, total, extra-, and intracellular MRSA CFUs in the peritoneal fluid 4 were determined (Figure 6G). For extracellular MRSA, Rif@FAM and Rif@FA NPs showed 5 comparable elimination efficiency, and were better than free Rif and Rif@FM NPs due to their 6 specific bacterial targeting property. Free Rif exhibited an appreciable extracellular bactericidal 7 performance, but failed in suppressing intracellular MRSA owing to its limited intracellular 8 concentration. Conversely, Rif@FAM NPs effectively killed the intracellular MRSA and 9 showed the best therapeutic efficacy. The CFUs of surviving intracellular MRSA (Figure 6H) 10 of Rif@FAM NPs (1.36 log10CFU) were significantly lower than those of Rif@FA NPs (2.18 11 log10CFU; **, p = 0.004) and Rif@FM NPs (3.24 log10CFU; ***, p = 0.0004). Additionally, 12 H&E analysis (Figure S25) revealed that the lung and liver of the mouse in the PBS treated 13 group displayed tissue injuries, such as the obvious heterogeneous widening of alveolar ducts 14 in the lung, and the sinusoidal dilatation in the liver. In contrast, Rif@FAM NPs treatment 15 visibly alleviated and even eliminated these tissue injuries, and there were no marked 16 differences in the histological analysis results compared with the healthy group. Quantitative 17 analysis of serum proinflammatory markers further confirmed that Rif@FAM NPs significantly 18 attenuated tissue injury and inflammation (Figure S26). This demonstrated that the cascade-19 targeting properties of Rif@FAM NPs had an excellent effect on the treatment of intracellular 20 infection in vivo, which was consistent with the extracellular antibacterial assay results. 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n21\n1\nFigure 6.

            "text": "In this contribution, we developed a novel DDS based on amphiphilic poly(N-acryloyl amino 6 acid), FAM. This DDS possessed a specific cascade-targeting feature that targeted macrophages 7 and intracellular MRSA in a sequential manner. Intracellular MRSA targeting and on-site Rif 8 delivery endowed Rif@FAM NPs with appealing in vitro and in vivo performances of 9 intracellular MRSA elimination, which distinctly outperformed the control groups of free Rif, 10 Rif@FA and Rif@FM NPs. The FAM-based DDS has superior advantages; (i) high 11 intracellular accumulation and long retention of antibiotics; (ii) long term antibacterial activity 12 because of the structural stability of the DDS against the harsh acidic environment; (iii) precise 13 on-site release of the antibiotics for eliminating intracellular bacteria regardless of their latent 14 or dormant states; (iv) re-molding immune response of the infected-macrophages by the DDS 15 reinforced antibacterial efficiency. Overall, this study offers proof-of-concept for efficiently 16 eliminating intracellular bacteria via on-site antibiotic delivery using cascade-targeting DDSs. 17 18 Supporting Information 19 Supporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author. 20 Acknowledgements 21 This work thanks the National Natural Science Foundation (21574008, 22005020), the National 22 Mega-project for Innovative Drugs (2019ZX09721001-007-002), Key Program of Beijing 23 Natural Science Foundation (Z200025) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central 24 Universities (BHYC1705B) of China for the financial support.
