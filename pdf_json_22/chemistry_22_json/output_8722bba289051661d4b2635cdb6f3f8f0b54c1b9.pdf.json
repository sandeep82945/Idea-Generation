    "abstractText": "The assembly of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) into toxic oligomers and fibrils is associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. Therefore, disrupting amyloid assembly by direct targeting of the A\u03b2 monomeric form with small molecules or antibodies is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, given the dynamic nature of A\u03b2, standard computational tools cannot be easily applied for high-throughput structure-based virtual screening in drug discovery projects. In the current study, we propose a computational pipeline\u2014in the framework of the ensemble docking strategy\u2014to identify catechins\u2019 binding sites in monomeric A\u03b242. It is shown that both hydrophobic aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonding are crucial for the binding of catechins to A\u03b242. Additionally, it has been found that all the studied ligands, especially EGCG, can act as potent inhibitors against amyloid aggregation by blocking the central hydrophobic region of A\u03b2. Our findings are evaluated and confirmed with multi-microsecond MD simulations. Finally, it is suggested that our proposed pipeline, with low computational cost in comparison with MD simulations, is a suitable approach for the virtual screening of ligand libraries against A\u03b2.",

            "text": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are very flexible biomolecules without a welldefined folded structure and typically have important roles in biological processes, in particular in cellular signaling and gene regulation [1\u20134]. Under certain conditions, some IDPs may aggregate into highly toxic oligomers. These oligomers are associated with a wide range of serious human diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes [4\u20139]. Thus, preventing or reducing aggregation of the IDPs involved in such diseases is as an effective therapeutic strategy. In recent years, there have been efforts to design and synthesize small molecules and short peptides to block IDP aggregation at different stages along the aggregation pathway, in particular nucleation and oligomer formation [4,10\u201317]. Several studies have revealed that a large number of natural compounds derived from plants, animals and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8161. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098161 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8161 2 of 20\nmicroorganisms have the potential to inhibit oligomerization [11,12,18\u201320]. For example, several computational and experimental observations have shown that polyphenolic plant compounds which occur naturally in fruit, vegetables, chocolate, and tea are capable of inhibiting IDP aggregation [12,13,20\u201338]. Finding aggregation inhibitors and direct targeting of monomeric IDPs via small molecules is a very active area of research and a wide variety of computational techniques have been applied, yet there are many inherent difficulties [12\u201314,27,39\u201346]. For example, most docking algorithms employ the flexible ligand and rigid receptor paradigm [47\u201349]. However, IDPs display high conformational heterogeneity, and ligand binding causes large structural changes in the IDP conformations. To circumvent this problem, heterogeneous conformational ensembles of IDPs have been used for docking studies [27,38,42,50,51]. Nevertheless, challenges associated with generating and choosing a set of suitable conformations for docking still remain. It will also be interesting to see how and if Alphafold [52] will change the situation as it has already been applied to non-IDP-related binding problems [53], but IDPs appear to be a challenge even for Alphafold [54]. Several methods have been proposed for efficient sampling of IDP\u2019s conformational space and constructing a representative conformational ensemble. Examples include replica-exchange- [55\u201358] and metadynamics-based methods [59\u201361], diffusion map approaches [62,63] and Markov state modeling [64\u201367]. For comparisons between the methods, see for example [43,68\u201370]. One alternative for effective exploration of the conformational space is the use of multiple conventional MD trajectories (replicas) with different initial conditions (different velocities or/and different starting configurations). The strategy of choosing the initial conditions controls the effectiveness of this approach and its ability to enhance conformational sampling performance [71\u201376]. We have recently proposed a new efficient algorithm for comprehensive exploring of the conformational space of IDPs, called Blockwise Excursion Sampling (BES) [75,76]. It uses simulated annealing (SA) to find different low-energy states of various regions of conformational space as optimal starting configurations for short conventional MD simulations. In BES, conformational sampling is based on many uncorrelated short MD simulations starting from different points of the accessible phase space. It has been shown that the protocol is successful in generating a diverse conformational library for IDP conformations in agreement with experimental data [75,76]. In this work, a computational pipeline in the framework of the ensemble docking strategy has been proposed to identify catechins\u2019 binding sites on the full-length human amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242) monomer which is involved in Alzheimer\u2019s disease [2,5,11,12,27,39,41,43]. Catechins (or flavan-3-ols) are dietary polyphenolic compounds commonly found in green tea and their inhibitory effects on A\u03b2 aggregation have been the subject of numerous experimental and computational investigations [21,28,36,77\u201394]. There is experimental evidence indicating that the catechins are able to disturb A\u03b2 aggregation and change the aggregation process toward the formation of non-toxic oligomers [28,37,77,78,80,81,85,86]. Several computational studies have proposed that green tea catechin EGCG interacts with A\u03b242 through both multiple hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding [28,79,84,85]. Those studies have suggested that \u03c0-stacking interactions with aromatic amino acids of the aromatic hydrophobic core region of A\u03b242 (from Tyr10 to Phe20) affect A\u03b242 aggregation and can, consequently, disrupt interchain interactions in A\u03b242 protofibril structure and lead to the distortion of the protofibril structure [28,83\u201385,87,93]. Here, we applied the BES protocol to generate a reliable structural library for A\u03b242 monomer. Through the ensemble docking approach, a catechin library was docked onto the surfaces of a library of A\u03b242 monomers to identify the binding \u201chot spots\u201d on the A\u03b242 peptide. In order to further evaluate the docking results and the stability of complexes, the obtained structures with the largest binding energies for each A\u03b242\u2013catechin complex were used as the starting structures for long multi-microsecond MD simulations (total of 15 \u00b5s).\nInt.

            "text": "Structural Analysis and Identifying Ligand Binding Site Determination of the important residues that are in close contact with the ligand is very\nimportant for the identification of potential inhibitors of A\u03b242 aggregation. The distances between the heavy atoms of the ligand and the residues of A\u03b242 were used to define the binding sites of A\u03b242. Based on this assumption, a list of binding residues for each selected complex was generated for which at least one heavy atom of the residues falls within the distance cutoff of any ligand heavy atom. To assess the effect of the distance cutoff, five distances were evaluated: 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 \u00c5; the distances cutoff from 3.0 to 5.0 \u00c5 are commonly used to study ligand\u2013protein binding interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, and aromatic interactions [22,95\u2013100]. The number of contacts between each ligand and A\u03b242 residues for the set-1 (as defined in Section 3.2) was counted for five different distance cutoffs and tabulated in Tables S1\u2013S5. Here, we only show the results related to the distance cutoff of 5.0 \u00c5 in Table 1. It is very important to emphasize that in our structural analysis, none of the conformers selected from molecular docking alone were used to draw qualitative conclusions about the binding site. All the structural analyses in this study are based on the results given in Table 1, which were obtained from the statistical study of all the selected complexes based on \u2206\u2206Gbinding, which is illustrated in more detail in Section 3.2. The first observation from the tables is that all the ligands have the most contacts with residues Tyr10, Phe19, and Phe20. Moreover, based on the ranked lists (Tables 1 and S1\u2013S5), other aromatic residues (His13, His14, His6, and Phe4) show a relatively high number of contacts and thus, they contribute to stabilizing the interactions with catechins. Therefore, it seems that these polyphenolic compounds tend to interact with the aromatic residues through stacking and/or T-shaped interactions, as shown in the snapshots of Figures 1\u20135. Another important observation is that the tendency of ligands to interact with Tyr10 correlates with the number of hydroxyl groups on the ligands. This is seen in the data in the tables: EGCG possesses the largest number of hydroxyl groups (8 OH\u2019s) and has a greater tendency to interact with Tyr10 than with Phe19 or Phe20, i.e., the number of contacts between EGCG and Tyr10 is larger than those between EGCG and Phe19 or Phe20. Thus, the data appear to imply that, hydrophobic aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonding are both crucial for the binding process. Finally, a comparative look at the tabulated values immediately shows that all ligands have a tendency to associate with the hydrophobic region of A\u03b242 spanning residues from Tyr10 to Phe20. This region contains most of the aromatic residues found in full-length A\u03b2. This region also encompasses the central hydrophobic region (16KLVFF20) that, based on many experimental and computational studies, is involved in the initiation of amyloid aggregation [11\u201313,22,40,101\u2013106]. Therefore, our docking results show that all studied ligands, especially EGCG, can act as potent inhibitors against amyloid aggregation through blocking the central hydrophobic region. These findings are in agreement with experimental studies [28,37,78\u201380,83].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8161 4 of 20\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8161 5 of 20\nInt. J. Mol.

A comparison among the five A\u03b242\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ligand systems reveals that there are a few residues in the A\u03b242 sequence that frequently form hydrogen bonds with the five different catechins (e.g., Glu22, Asp23, and Ala42). These intransient hydrogen bonds alternate between the ligand and the residues, which may suggest that hydrogen bonds have a less important role in the binding of the ligands to A\u03b242 compared to stacking interactions. The average number of hydrogen bonds between all the amino acids of the peptide and ligands are depicted in Figure S15. Similar conclusion has been previously made for A\u03b242 protofibrils and EGCG, where EGCG was shown to bind to A\u03b242 monomer through hydrophobic, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, and hydrogen bonds [79,83\u201385,87,107]. Moreover, same study identifies Asp1, Glu22, and Ala42 residues to form the most hydrogen bonds with EGCG, which except for Asp1, agrees with our observation (Figure S14). It should be noted, however, that while we have examined disordered structures in this study, Li et al. [107] considered fibrils and 25 EGCG molecules. Finally, the secondary structure of A\u03b242 in the presence of catechins was also evaluated and plotted using the VMD visualization software (Figure 6). As is evident from the figure, turn\u2019 and coil\u2019 are the main observed secondary structures, followed by the helices and \u03b2-strands. In some instances, relatively short-lived fast-alternating helices (\u03b1-helix and 310 helix) as well as \u03b2-strands are formed.

The docking search space for exploring ligand binding conformations around each representative A\u03b242 structure was defined using a rectangular box centered at the center of mass of A\u03b242 with a minimal distance of 12 \u00c5 from A\u03b242 to the edges of the box. Therefore, depending on the size and shape of A\u03b242 configuration, an optimized docking box was determined individually for each A\u03b242. Each docking run generates nine optimal A\u03b242-ligand bound conformations and overall, a total of 90,000 (10,000 \u00d7 9) poses were generated for each catechin compound. The different poses in each run are rank-ordered by the Vina score, a quantity that correlates with the binding free energy. The top-scoring pose in each run achieves the lowest free energy of binding in the complex.\nVery recently, it has been shown that the correct pose (the pose with the lowest RMSD from the corresponding experimental pose) is usually predicted by Vina but sometimes, does not get the top score in the Vina ranking [112,113]. To avoid the problem and to capture the correct poses, it is recommended that except for the top-ranked pose, some important lower-ranked poses for each docking run should be identified and selected for post-docking analysis. For more discussions about ranking, see also [114\u2013117]. For this purpose, the differences in the binding free energies between the top-ranked pose and lower-ranked poses were calculated for selected high-ranked modelled complexes for each docking run, \u0394\u0394Gbinding (= \u0394Gtop pose \u2013 \u0394Glower-ranked pose). Different cutoff values for the \u0394\u0394Gbinding threshold (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 kcal.mol\u22121) were used for selecting docking complexes, since the optimal selection of complexes is not known. For larger \u0394\u0394Gbinding cutoff values, more complexes were selected. For example, with the cutoff value of 0.1 kcal.mol\u22121, 17,431 (10,000 \u00d7 1 (top-ranked poses from each run) + 7431 (lower-ranked poses near top poses with the cutoff)) complexes were selected for docking of EGCG, while 29,923 and 42,833 complexes were selected with the cutoff values of 0.2 and 0.3 kcal.mol\u22121, respectively.

Flowchart of steps taken in this study.\nFor this study, we selected five main catechins found in green tea: (1) (+)-catechin (C), (2) (-)-epicatechin (EC), (3) (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (4) (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and (5) (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 8 and their initial structures were taken from the ZINC database [108]. This was followed by optimization of the molecular geometries for all of them using the B3LYP exchange and correlation functional [109] and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. The GAMESS package [110] was used for geometry optimization."

The docking search space for exploring ligand binding conformations around each representative A\u03b242 structure was defined using a rectangular box centered at the center of mass of A\u03b242 with a minimal distance of 12 \u00c5 from A\u03b242 to the edges of the box. Therefore, depending on the size and shape of A\u03b242 configuration, an optimized docking box was determined individually for ach A\u03b242. Each docking un generates nine optimal A\u03b242- igand bound conformations and overall, a total of 90,000 (10,000 \u00d7 9) poses were generated for each catechin compound. The different poses in each run are rank-ordered by the Vina score, a quantity that correlates with the binding free energy. The top-scoring pose in each run achieves the lowest free energy of binding in the complex. Very recently, it has been shown that the correct pose (the pose with the lowest RMSD from the corresponding experimental pose) is usually predicted by Vina but sometimes, d es not get th top score in the Vina ranking [112,113]. To avoid e problem an to capture the correct poses, it is recommended that except for the top-ranked pose, some important lower-ranked poses for each docking run should be identified and selected for post-docking analysis. For more discussions about ranking, see also [114\u2013117]. For this purpose, the differences in the binding free energies between the top-ranked pose and\nInt. J. Mol.

Different cutoff values for the \u2206\u2206Gbinding threshold (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 kcal.mol\u22121) were used for selecting docking complexes, since the optimal selection of complexes is not known. For larger \u2206\u2206Gbinding cutoff values, more complexes were selected. For example, with the cutoff value of 0.1 kcal.mol\u22121, 17,431 (10,000 \u00d7 1 (top-ranked poses from each run) + 7431 (lower-ranked poses near top poses with the cutoff)) complexes were selected for docking of EGCG, while 29,923 and 42,833 complexes were selected with the cutoff values of 0.2 and 0.3 kcal.mol\u22121, respectively.

Since the results for different sets are very similar, we only present the results of set-1 (with the cutoff value of 0.1) and the results for the other two sets can be found in the Supporting Information.

            "text": "All-atom MD simulations were performed on the peptide with five different ligands. The force field parameters for each ligand were created using the Antechamber program in the Ambertools19 package [118] and described by the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [119] using AM1-BCC charges [120]. The Amberff99SB*-ILDNP force field [121] and the TIP3P water model [122] were adopted for the protein and water, respectively. Each protein was placed in a dodecahedral box such that the distance from the edges of the box to every atom in the protein was at least 1 nm and 150 mM of KCl was added to reproduce physiological conditions. Overall charge neutrality was preserved by adding 3 K+ counterions. The GROMACS 2016.3 [123]. package was used for all simulations. Each system was energy minimized using the method of steepest descents. This was followed by a pre-equilibration in the canonical ensemble, i.e., at constant particle number, volume, and temperature, for 100 ps. The Lennard\u2013Jones potential was truncated using a shift function between 1.0 and 1.2 nm. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald method (PME) [124,125] with a real space cutoff of 1.2 nm. The temperature was set to 310 K with the V-rescale algorithm [126] and pressure was kept at 1 atm using the Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat [127]. Bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the linear constraint solver (P-LINCS) algorithm [128]. Pre-equilibration was followed by a production run of 3 \u00b5s with a time step of 2 fs for each of the five peptide-ligand systems."

            "text": "In this work, binding of various well-known catechins present in green tea to the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) has been predicted and analyzed. For this purpose, a computational pipeline in the framework of the ensemble docking strategy has been proposed in which a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations of A\u03b242 is used. The ensemble is generated by the Blockwise Excursion Sampling (BES) protocol [75,76] in which the conformational sampling is performed on the basis of many uncorrelated short-time MD simulations starting from different reasonable points of the accessible phase space. It was observed that all green tea catechins compounds tended to interact with the aromatic residues through stacking and/or T-shaped interactions and, because of this, all compounds show a high tendency to interact with the hydrophobic region of A\u03b242 spanning residues from Tyr10 to Phe20, the region with the highest number of the aromatic residues in full-length A\u03b242. This region also encompasses the central hydrophobic core (CHC, residues 16\u201320) that, based on many experimental and computational studies, plays a key role in the aggregation process of A\u03b242. Therefore, the docking results indicate that all studied ligands, especially EGCG, can act as potent inhibitors against amyloid aggregation by blocking the central hydrophobic core. Additionally, it has been suggested that both hydrophobic aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonding are crucial for the binding of catechins to A\u03b242. To evaluate the obtained findings in binding of catechin compounds to A\u03b242, long multi-microsecond MD simulations were performed. It was shown that the present docking protocol is highly successful in identifying catechins\u2019 binding sites in monomeric A\u03b242, in agreement with previous MD simulations and some recent experimental observations for similar A\u03b242\u2013catechin complexes [28,77\u201379,83\u201385,87,93]. Finally, we suggested that our proposed pipeline with low computational cost in comparison with MD simulations is a suitable approach for high-throughput structure-based virtual screening of ligand\nInt.
