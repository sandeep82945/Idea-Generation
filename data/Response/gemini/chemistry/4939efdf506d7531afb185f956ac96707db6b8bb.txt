1. **Investigate the effect of protein flexibility on adsorption behavior.** The current study assumes that proteins are rigid bodies, but in reality, they are flexible molecules that can undergo conformational changes. This flexibility could affect the protein's ability to adsorb to the polymer surface, as well as the strength of the adsorption bond.


2. **Study the role of protein-protein interactions in adsorption.** The current study does not take into account the interactions between proteins, which could play a significant role in adsorption behavior. For example, proteins could compete with each other for adsorption sites, or they could form aggregates that are more difficult to adsorb.


3. **Explore the effect of different polymer surface chemistries on adsorption.** The current study uses a simple polymer surface chemistry, but in reality, there are many different types of polymer surfaces with different chemical properties. These different chemistries could affect the protein's ability to adsorb to the surface, as well as the strength of the adsorption bond.


4. **Investigate the effect of solution conditions on adsorption.** The current study is conducted in a pure water environment, but in reality, proteins are often adsorbed from complex solutions that contain other molecules, such as salts, detergents, and other proteins. These molecules could affect the protein's ability to adsorb to the polymer surface, as well as the strength of the adsorption bond.


5. **Develop a theoretical model to predict protein adsorption behavior.** The current study is based on molecular simulations, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming. A theoretical model could provide a more efficient way to predict protein adsorption behavior, which could be used to design new materials and processes for protein separation and purification.
