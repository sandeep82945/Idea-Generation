            "text": "General Relativity (GR) is a well established theory for describing numerous observations in the solar system1 and in cosmology, it is one of the best tested theories.\nNevertheless, it is not decided if GR is complete to describe phenomena in very strong gravitational fields, as in the vicinity of a black hole. For example, quantization effects are expected to play a role. There are further problems, as the loss of information and the appearance of an event horizon which disconnects an outer observer to the interior of a black hole (though, many do not think that this is a problem).\n1\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n03 50\n9v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n7 A\npr 2\n02 2\nTherefore, in very strong gravitational fields one can speculate on how possibly to extend GR. Einstein himself intended to modify his theory such that it contains Electrodynamics.2,3 In order to do so, he introduced a complex metric. Another approach was followed by M. Born,4,5 who complained about the dominant role of coordinates in GR, contrary to Quantum Mechanics where the momentum is treated on an equal footing. M. Born tried to solve the problem by introducing the concept of complementarity, modifying the length element such that it is defined in the coordinate-momentum space.\nLater, Caianiello and his coworkers retook the ideas of M. Born and wrote a series of papers about a theory called Quantum Geometry6\u201312 (for the formulation in differential geometry see13). In14 a pseudo-complex extension of GR (pcGR) was proposed, with many applications,15 and in16 the most recent review is given including several predictions. M. Born\u2019s theory corresponds to a particular limit in pcGR.16 It was shown that deviations to GR, for macroscopic black holes, only appear near the event horizon (not having yet being resolved due to resolution problems). In all applications of pcGR the minimal length was neglected, because its effects where considered to be negligible.\nIn earlier contributions17 (and references therein) the effects of a minimal length on the structure near the event horizon were investigated within GR. The questions, we would like to answer, are: What happens when GR is extended algebraically to pcGR, which includes the effects of a dark energy in the vicinity of a black hole? In what range of the black hole mass the effects of a minimal length are noticeable? In17 the effects of the maximal acceleration, as a parameter, were studied and not the role of a minimal length and its relation to the mass of the black hole (though, they are related). As we will see the minimal length affects small mass black holes, which may have been created during the Big Bang.\nThe inclusion of a minimal length in the extended theory is quite involved and we have to recur to approximations, as restricting to the Schwarzschild solution only.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 the theory proposed by E. R. Caianiello is resumed. In Section 3 the effects of the minimal length in pcGR in the Schwarzschild case is discussed and finally in Section 4 the results are interpreted and conclusions are drawn."

            "text": "This model6\u201312,17 interprets the quantization via a curvature of the relativistic eight-dimensional space-time tangent bundle TM = M4 + TM4, with M4 as the usual flat space-time manifold with the metric \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd (see also 13). This description satisfies the Born reciprocity principle4,5 and it incorporates the notion that the proper accelerations of massive particles along their worldliness with upper limit Am, referred to as maximal acceleration (MA). Indeed the usual Minkowski line element d2s = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx \u00b5dx\u03bd is replaced by the line element in the eight-dimensional\nspace-time tangent bundle TM, with \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd substituted by g\u00b5\u03bd ,\nd2w = gABdX AdXB , A,B = 0, ....7, (1)\nwhere\ngAB = g\u00b5\u03bd \u2297 g\u00b5\u03bd ,\nXA = ( x\u00b5, c2\nAm\ndx\u00b5\nds\n) , \u00b5 = 0, ..3 , (2)\nx\u00b5 = (ct,\u2212\u2192x ) is the usual space-time four-vector and \u00b7x \u00b5 = u\u00b5 = dx\u00b5\nds the four-\nvelocity, c is the speed of light in the vacuum. The velocity components are strictly speaking only valid in flat space16 and it is a consequence of the dispersion relation. As noted above, E.R. Caianiello substituted the \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd by a general metric g\u00b5\u03bd , where the relation is approximate.\nThe line element in the ordinary four-dimensional space-time M4, in which a particles moves when the constraints of a maximal acceleration is present, is rewritten such that the length element has the usual form augmented by a conformal factor. In fact, we can calculate the effective four dimensional metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd on the hypersurface locally embedded in TM4. In this case, the line element becomes\nd2w = (1 + g\u00b5\u03bda\n\u00b5a\u03bd\nA2m )d2s (3)\nd2w = g\u0303\u00b5\u03bddx \u00b5dx\u03bd (4)\nwith d2s = g\u00b5\u03bddx \u00b5dx\u03bd and g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = (1 +\ng\u00b5\u03bda \u00b5a\u03bd\nA2m )g\u00b5\u03bd = \u03c3\n2(r)g\u00b5\u03bd , (5)\nwith the four-acceleration \u00b7\u00b7 x \u00b5 = a\u00b5 = c2 d 2x\u00b5\nd2s (ds = cd\u03c4 , with \u03c4 as the eigentime).\nIt is quite involved to obtain the exact form for the conformal factor \u03c32(r) and one recurs to an iterative procedure: In the first step, the equations of motion with \u03c32(r) = 1 are deduced in the usual manner, solving the geodesic equations. These give the components of the 4-acceleration a\u00b5(0). Substituting these components into \u03c32(r) results in\n\u03c32(1)(r) = 1 + g\u00b5\u03bda\n\u00b5 (0)a \u03bd (0)\nA2m (6)\nThe index (i) denotes the order of the iteration. We can iterate this procedure by resolving the equations of motion with the \u03c32(1), obtaining the next iteration a\u00b5(1) for the 4-acceleration. As a result we obtain the next iterative expression for \u03c32 = \u03c32(2), namely\n\u03c32(2)(r) = 1 + g\u00b5\u03bda\n\u00b5 (1)a \u03bd (1)\nA2m . (7)\nThis iteration procedure can be continued, however, in general it is stop after the second iteration and study the effects on the solutions, the form of the effective potential, etc.\nAfter a second iteration, the modified length element acquires the form\nd2w = ( 1 + g\u00b5\u03bda \u00b5 (1)a \u03bd (1)\nA2m\n) d2s (8)\ng\u0303\u00b5\u03bd =\n( 1 + g\u00b5\u03bda \u00b5 (1)a \u03bd (1)\nA2m\n) g\u00b5\u03bd (9)\nLimiting values for the accelerations were also derived by several authors on different grounds and applied to many branches of physics such as string theory, cosmology, quantum field theory, black hole physics etc.13,18\u201329 In17 this maximal acceleration is obtained as Am = 2mc3\n~ , where the causal limit was taken\ninto account. Another group starts from an eight dimensional space by introducing pseudo-complex variables and projecting this space to a four dimensional physical space.30\u201333\nUp to here, the notion of a maximal acceleration is restricted to GR, formulated with the coordinates x\u00b5. The central question of our contribution is: What happens when not only a maximal acceleration is introduced, but also the coordinates are algebraically extended34 to pseudo-complex coordinates\nX\u00b5 = x\u00b5 + Iy\u00b5 , (10)\nwith I2 = 1.34\nIn14 just such an extension of the general relativity was proposed, called the pseudo-complex General Relativity (pcGR), with the most recent review given in.16 The pseudo-complex extension is proven to be the only consistent algebraic extension of GR,34 not having neither ghost nor tachyon solutions. In pseudo-complex General Relativity the space-time coordinates are of the form X\u00b5 = x\u00b5 + I l cu\u00b5, with its pseudo-real part x\u00b5 and its pseudo-imaginary component, chosen to have the form y\u00b5 = lcu\u00b5 in analogy to. 18 The component lcu\u00b5 is an approximation, strictly speaking valid only in flat space, and can be associated to the components of the tangent vector (four velocity vector) at a given space-time point. The factor l has the unit of a length, which is introduced due to dimensional reasons. The consequence of that is the appearance of a minimal length scale l within the theory which implies a maximal acceleration. As mentioned above. we assume that the minimal\nlength scale is of order of the Planck length (lP = \u221a ~k c3 =1.616199 \u00d7 10 \u221235m, k is the gravitational constant and ~ is the reduced Planck constant).\nThe line element in pcGR is given by\nd2w = g\u00b5\u03bd(X,P )DX \u00b5DX\u03bd , (11)\nwhere X\u00b5 and P\u03bd are pseudo-complex.\nFurther assumptions to the metric are applied, namely that g\u00b5\u03bd(X) = g\u00b5\u03bd(x), i.e. that it does not depend on the four-velocity, and with the constraint that the length element itself is pseudo-real, which is the case when the dispersion relation is satisfied.16 With this, the length element in pcGR acquires the form\nd2w = g\u00b5\u03bd(x) [ dx\u00b5dx\u03bd + ( l\nc\n)2 du\u00b5du\u03bd ] (12)\nIn this extension the geometry is understood as a consequence of curvature in eight-dimensional phase space, in which the coordinates of the velocity-space manifold are the components of the four-velocity with a dimensional factor l of the order of the Planck length lP . In (12) the length element ds 2 = g\u00b5\u03bddx \u00b5dx\u03bd is extracted and we use ds = cd\u03c4 , with d\u03c4 as the eigentime. We obtain\nd2w = d2s ( 1\u2212 ( l2\nc4\n) |g\u00b5\u03bda\u00b5a\u03bd | ) (13)\nd2w = g\u0303\u00b5\u03bddx \u00b5dx\u03bd\ng\u0303\u00b5\u03bd =\n( 1\u2212 ( l2\nc4\n) |g\u00b5\u03bda\u00b5a\u03bd | ) g\u00b5\u03bd , (14)\nwith g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd representing the modified metric and a \u00b5 the acceleration component du\n\u00b5\nd\u03c4 ,\nwith \u03c4 as the eigentime.\nTherefore, one can rewrite the length element as\nd2w = \u03c32(r)d2s\nwith\n\u03c32(r) = ( 1\u2212 ( l2\nc4\n) |g\u00b5\u03bda\u00b5a\u03bd | ) . (15)\nIt is clear that the maximal acceleration is included automatically in pseudo-\ncomplex general relativity (Am = c2\nl ). The new metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd depends on the coordi-\nnates x\u00b5 and on the acceleration field a\u00b5. In this case, the generalized proper-time interval (13) becomes\nd2w = ( 1\u2212 l 2 c4 |a|2 ) d2s , (16)\nwhich restricts the acceleration, as before, to a finite interval with a maximal acceleration c 2\nl = 2mc3 ~ . 6\u201312,17 In35 it was applied to a pc-field theory with the important\nfeature that it is by construction regularized, due to the appearance of a minimal length scale l. Due to the fact that this minimal length scale is a parameter, it is not affected by a Lorentz transformation and, thus, all symmetries are preserved, which is a huge simplification compared to theories which require a violation of the Lorentz symmetry. In16,36 this fact was used in the hope that it prevents the formation of a black hole. Indeed the formation of a black hole is avoided in this theory, but not due to the minimal length scale but due to the appearance of dark energy which appears naturally within this theory. The same effects appear when it was applied to the Robertson-Walker universe.15,36 In all cases, the variational principle introduced contributions, which can be interpreted as dark energy, acting repulsively such that the formation of an event horizon and a singularity at the center is avoided. This is a most important result, as any proper theory should not contain singularities.\nFinally, one has to note that the second term in the conformal factor \u03c32 is only a covariant quantity in flat space, where the dispersion relation \u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx \u00b5dy\u00b5 = 0,\nwith y\u00b5 = ( l c ) u\u00b5 (u\u00b5 is the 4-velocity) is valid.17 In a curved space, one has to solve a complicated equation, which is the result of the constraint that the pseudocomplex length element is real, i.e., the pseudo-imaginary term has to vanish. For more details and first attempts to solve it, please consult.16 This is a price to pay when the iteration procedure is used."

            "text": "In pcGR it is assumed that a central mass generates, due to quantum effects, a distribution of dark energy in its vicinity, which is based on theoretical grounds using semi-classical Quantum Mechanics.37 The distribution is parametrized as Bn/r n, with two phenomenological parameters, Bn and n. The Bn = bm n describes the coupling of the central mass to the dark energy and n its fall-off as a function of the radial distance. This is the simplest ansatz and one easily can add further complicated dependencies in r. In14 n was set to 2, which results in a metric already excluded by solar system experiments.1 In14,38,39 the n was equal to 3 and several observable predictions were made. Using the first observation of gravitational waves,40 in41,42 it is shown that n = 3 is also excluded, thus n = 4 is assumed now. In this case the pseudo-complex Schwarzschild solution is\nd2s = ( 1\u2212 2m\nr +\n\u2126\n2r\n) d2t\u2212 d\n2r( 1\u2212 2mr + \u2126 2r ) \u2212 r2(d2\u03b8 + sin2 \u03b8d2\u03c6) (17) \u2126(r) =\nB4 3 r\u22123 (18)\nThe results for n = 3 are quite similar, changing only details.\nIn43 the B4 parameter was varied within the pc-Kerr solution from zero (GR) to a maximal value, from which on no event horizon exists anymore. The transition\nfrom the existence of an event horizon to its disappearance could be related to a phase transition. However, again the effects of a minimal length were neglected. Here, we also will consider the whole range of B4, i.e, investigating the transition from GR to pcGR, but now with the inclusion of a minimal length.\nWith the approximation applied, the line element with a minimal length l is\ngiven by the relation (16), which is similar in form as given by E. R. Caianiello.\nIn the following sub-section the factor \u03c32(l) will be investigated further.\n3.1. The factor \u03c32(r)\nIn order to calculate the corrections to the pc-Schwarzschild metric, experienced by a particle and its motion along a geodesic, one must determine the factor \u03c32(r) of the order of l2. Before that, we will impose some conditions on the factor \u03c32(r). By using the embedding procedure mentioned above of the order l2, the line element acquires the form (16), which has to be positive definite, i.e.,\nd2w > 0\u21d0\u21d2 \u2223\u2223a2\u2223\u2223 < c4\nl2 , (19)\nThis implies that the acceleration is limited from above by Am = c 2/l, called the maximal acceleration. With this condition, the factor \u03c32(r) is limited by 0 from below, when the acceleration is maximal, and by 1 from above, when the acceleration is zero:\n0 \u2264 \u03c32(r) \u2264 1 (20)\nAs a consequence, the pcGR implies a maximal acceleration, as in GR.6\u201312\nIn order to deduce the explicit expression of \u03c32(r) we recur again to an iteration procedure (restricting now to the first iteration), 5which provides an approximate solution for this factor: In the first iteration, to which we will restrict, the metric with \u03c32 = 1 is taken and the corresponding geodesic equations are derived and solved. To obtain these geodesic equations, we start from the variational integral principle\n\u03b4 \u222b [( 1\u2212 2m\nr + B4 6r4\n)(\u00b7 t0 )2 \u2212 1(\n1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4 ) ( \u00b7r)2 \u2212 r2(( \u00b7\u03b8)2 + sin2 \u03b8( \u00b7\u03c6)2)] ds2 = 0 , (21)\nwhere the dot refers to the derivative with respect to the variable s. The variation leads to equations of motion\nd ds (r2 \u00b7 \u03b8 2 ) = r2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 \u00b7 \u03c6 2\n(22)\nd\nds (r2 sin2 \u03b8\n\u00b7 \u03c6) = 0 (23)\nd\nds\n[( 1\u2212 2m\nr + B4 6r4\n) \u00b7 t ] = 0 , (24)\nfrom where the accelerations a\u00b5(0) in this first iteration are obtained.\nIn this completely relativistic metric of the pc-Schwarzschild, all orbits will be\nstill in the orbital plane defined by\n\u03b8 = \u03c0 2 ; \u00b7 \u03b8 = 0 . (25)\nWith this, the equations of motion for the energy and the angular momentum,\nrespectively, are\n( 1\u2212 2m\nr + B4 6r4\n) \u00b7 t = E (26)\nr2 \u00b7 \u03c6 = L . (27)\nIn addition, we can use ds 2\nds2 = 1, which leads to a third equation, namely\n1 = ( 1\u2212 2m\nr + B4 6r4\n) c2 \u00b7 t 2\n\u2212 1( 1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4 ) \u00b7r2 \u2212 r2 \u00b7\u03c62 . (28) Substituting Eqs. (26) and (27) into (28), we obtain\n\u00b7 r 2 = E2 \u2212 ( 1\u2212 2m\nr + B4 6r4\n)( L2\nr2 + 1\n) . (29)\nSubstituting the last results into \u03c32 = ( 1\u2212 l 2\nc4 \u2223\u2223a2\u2223\u2223) leads to \u03c32(1) in terms of l, \u00b7\u00b7 t, \u00b7\u00b7 r, and \u00b7\u00b7 \u03c6\n\u03c32(1)(r) =\n{ 1\u2212 l 2\nc4 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212c2 ( 1\u2212 2m r + B4 6r4 ) \u00b7\u00b7 t 2 + 1(\n1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4\n) \u00b7\u00b7r2 + r2 \u00b7\u00b7\u03c62\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 } (30)\nwith\n\u00b7\u00b7 t = \u2212E c2 ( 1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4\n)2 (2mr2 \u2212 2B43r5 ) \u00b7 r\n\u00b7\u00b7 r = ( \u2212m r2 + L2 r3 \u2212 3mL 2 r4 + B4 3r5 + 2B4L 2 3r7 ) \u00b7\u00b7 \u03c6 = \u22122L\nr3 \u00b7 r\n\u00b7 r 2 =\n[ E2 c2 \u2212 ( 1\u2212 2m r + B4 6r4 )( L2 r2 + 1 )] (31)\nThe m is the mass of the source in units of length, L the angular momentum and E the energy, with E and L being constant of motions, in units of the particle mass M . In what follows, we will present some plots of the factor \u03c32(r), in order to show how \u03c32 varies as a function of the a-dimensional variables\n\u03c1 = r\nm , \u03bb =\nL m , = l m , \u03b1 = B m4 . (32)\nThe dependence of \u03c32 on different parameter values (l) and B (\u03b1) is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. As can be seen, there are two effects: i) The deviations to \u03c32 = 1 become noticeable the more \u03b1 approaches from above 818 , where still an event horizon exists, for larger \u03b1 the deviations are smoothed out. When \u03b1 is smaller than 818 the deviations increase. In all cases, \u03c3 2 is strongly lowered below rm = 2. For large rm the \u03c3 2 approaches 1. Note, that = lm = 0.001 implies a small mass only thousand time larger than the minimal length. For a large mass, for example of the size of a regular star, only small or no effects are seen.\nTo resume, \u03c32(\u03c1 = rm ) \u2212\u2192 1 as \u03c1 = r m = \u2212\u2192 \u221e, as it should be because at large r the result of standard GR has to be reproduced and \u03c32 has to acquire the value 1. Taking \u03b1 = (81/8) and \u03b1 = 8, the factor \u03c32(\u03c1) shows a divergence near \u03c1 = 3/2 and near \u03c1+ = (1+ \u221a 5) 2 , \u03c1\u2212 = 1 respectively (see Fig. 1 and 2). In Fig. 1 two lines (dashed and solid) are depicted. The values \u03bb, \u03b1 and E are kept constant, while the dashed line is for = 0.1 (black hole mass ten times l) and the solid line for = 0.001 (a thousand times l). For \u03c32 the behavior is regular and finite for \u03b1 = 12, above the critical value, even when the mass is only ten times l, indicating the (see Fig 2) vanishing of event horizons.\nA vanishing d2w also indicates that the effective distance at this point is zero.\n3.2. Event Horizons\nIn order to give an interpretation for the divergences of the factor \u03c32(r), where it passes zero and tending to \u2212\u221e (note, that a negative value of \u03c32 is not allowed, i.e., it corresponds to a non-physical region), it is useful to determine the position of the event horizon(s) (there may be several) for different values of B4 = \u03b1m 4. For example, in the GR-Schwarzschild solution, the surface r = 2m is an event horizon. It is also a surface of infinite red-shift. As will be see below, these surfaces are different in the pc-Schwarzschild solution.43 We begin by investigating the possible positions of the event horizons more explicitly.\nA null surface satisfies the equation\nf(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0 , (33)\nwith x0 = ct, x1 = r, x2 = \u03b8 and x3 = \u03c6.\nIn the case of the Schwarzschild solution in GR the function f for the event\nhorizon is given by\nf = r \u2212 2m = x1 \u2212 2m\nLet us turn to pc-Schwarzschild solution, for which g\u00b5\u03bd is given by\ng\u00b5\u03bd =  ( 1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4 ) 0 0 0 0 \u2212 1 (1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4 ) 0 0\n0 0 \u2212r2 0 0 0 0 \u2212r2 sin2 \u03b8  (34) The B4 can, in principle, acquires any value and we will consider the whole range, from 0 to above 818 m 4.\nAccording to the possible values of B4 = \u03b1m 4, we can distinguished three cases:\n\u2022 1. When 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 818 , there are two event horizons at r\u00b1,, for example for \u03b1 = 8 we get r+ = 1.75211m and r\u2212 = 1.17221m, which agrees with. 43 \u2022 2. For \u03b1 = 818 the two event horizons r+ and r\u2212 merge into a single surface at re = 3m 2 as in. 43 This case is mainly taken for the applications of pcGR.16 \u2022 3. For \u03b1 > 818 there are no event horizons.\nFor all cases, we investigate the effects within the pc-Schwarzschild geometry. The null hypersurface is determined by ( 1\u2212 2mr + B4 6r4 ) = 0. It is clear that, the factor \u03c32(r) diverges at certain points for \u03b1 \u2264 818 on the two existing event horizons. For example \u03b1 = 8, the factor \u03c32(r) has two divergences at r+ = 1.75211m and r\u2212 = 1.17221m, respectively (see Fig. 2, dashed line). Below and above each sigunlarity, the \u03c32(r) function has to go through zero. According to the position of the divergences r\u00b1 we call these positions, where \u03c3 2(r) has a zero, r\u00b11 and r\u00b12, respectively.\nIn fact, in the case B4 < 81 8 m 4 (more specifically, the example \u03b1 = 8 is shown) the factor \u03c32(r) = 0 has five possible values for r (as explained above), one is near center (r = 0) r0, two r\u22121, r\u22122 are below and above the r\u2212, thus r\u22121 < r\u2212 < r\u22122 and two r+1, r+2 are below and above the r+, i.e. r+1 < r+ < r+2. For B4 = 81 8 m 4 (\u03b1 = 818 ) there are three solutions r where \u03c3 2(r) = 0. One is always near the center r = 0 and two re1 re2 are near re, where the index e refers to the event horizon. For B4 > 81 8 m 4 (more specific \u03b1 = 12), there is one value of r near the center in which \u03c32(r) = 0. Therefore, the factor \u03c32(r) is always negative between (0, r0), (r\u22121, r\u22122) and (r+1, r+2). As is known, the factor \u03c3 2(r) = 0 represents a particle with a maximal acceleration c 2\nl , thus, the zeros of the \u03c3 2(r) reveals these positionsof\nmaximal acceleration.\n3.3. The effective Potential\nIn order to make a direct comparison with the motion in the pc-Schwarzschild geometry possible, we adopt the same procedure as before. The new action is given\nby\nS = \u222b \u03c32(r) {( 1\u2212 2m\nr +\nB\n6r4\n) \u00b7 t 2\n\u2212 1( 1\u2212 2mr + B 6r4 ) \u00b7r2 \u2212 r2( \u00b7\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 \u00b7\u03c62)} dw (35)\nThe equation of motions become (\u03b8 = \u03c02 )\n\u03c32(r) ( 1\u2212 2m\nr +\nB\n6r4\n) \u00b7 t = E (36)\n\u03c32(r)r2 \u00b7 \u03c6 = L (37)\nIn addition we use dw 2\ndw2 = 1, i.e.,\n1 = \u03c32(r) {( 1\u2212 2m\nr +\nB\n6r4\n)( dt\ndw\n)2 \u2212 1(\n1\u2212 2mr + B 6r4\n) ( dr dw )2 \u2212 r2 ( d\u03c6 dw )2} (38)\nSubstituting the equations (29) and (30) into equation (31), we get\n1( 1\u2212 2mr + B 6r4 ) ( dr dw )2 =\nE2 \u03c34(r) ( 1\u2212 2mr + B 6r4 ) \u2212 L2 \u03c34(r)r2 \u2212 1 \u03c32(r) . (39)\nSolving for ( dr dw )2 , we obtain\n( dr\ndw\n)2 = ( 1\u2212 2m\nr +\nB\n6r4\n)[ E2\n\u03c34(r) ( 1\u2212 2mr + B 6r4 ) \u2212 L2 \u03c34(r)r2 \u2212 1 \u03c32(r) ] = E2 \u2212 V 2eff (r) . (40)\nComparing both sides we obtain for the effective potential\nV 2eff (r) = E 2 \u2212 E\n2\n\u03c34(r) +\n( 1\u2212 2m\nr +\nB\n6r4\n)( L2\n\u03c34(r)r2 +\n1\n\u03c32(r)\n) . (41)\nIn a more traditional approach, one writes\n1\n2\n( dr\ndw\n)2 + Peff (r) = \u03c9 , (42)\nwhere\nPeff (r) = 1\n2 (V 2eff (r)\u2212 1) and \u03c9 =\n1 2 (E2 \u2212 1) (43)\nIn order to plot the effective potential, it is preferable to use the a-dimensional variables (32) and the effective potential becomes, with \u03c1 = rm ,\nV 2eff (r) = E 2 \u2212 E\n2\n\u03c34(\u03c1) +\n( 1\u2212 2\n\u03c1 +\n\u03b1\n6\u03c14\n)( \u03bb2\n\u03c34(l, \u03c1)\u03c12 +\n1\n\u03c32(\u03c1)\n) (44)\nInspecting (44), one notes that the potential exhibits singularities as soon as \u03c32(r) approaches zero. On the other hand, when \u03c32(r)\u2192 \u2212\u221e the two last term tends to zero and the effective potential approaches E2.\nFor a selected set of parameter values, the effective potential is plotted in the Figs. 3 to 11. In all examples one notes the important feature that for all \u03b1 and small\n(large masses) the effective potential behaves smoothly, showing a repulsive behavior toward small distances. It shows a minimum between 1 and 1.5 which finally increases toward larger r, i.e., it has the typical form of an attractive \u201dmolecular\u201d potential.\nThe following discussion is easier to understand, noting that the effective potential in (44) has two important terms: the term \u2212E2/\u03c34 becomes dominant when the \u03c32 tends to zero. In this case, the potential goes to \u2212\u221e. When \u03c32(r) tends to \u2212\u221e, the only term which survives is the first one, namely E2, which the effective potential finally acquires.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 we studied the effect of changing \u03b1 from 8, below the critical limit, to \u03b1 = 818 , the critical limit, and \u03b1 = 12, above the critical limit. In these figures the solid line represents a macroscopic black hole and it shows a typical\nbehavior of an attractive, molecular type of potential. In reference to it, in Fig. 3 for \u03b1 we used the value of 8, in Fig. 4 the value 818 and in Fig. 5 the \u03b1 is above the critical value. We see that contrary to17 several potential barriers appear. This is due to the behavior of the \u03c32(r)-function which exhibits several zeros and also the potential exhibits various zeros where \u03c32(r) tends to \u2212\u221e. We also see that when the \u03b1 changes, also the number of singularities change.\nInteresting is how the height of the barrier changes with increasing energy E of the particle, see Fig. 6. As in17 the height of the barrier increases with E, indicating that the particle is always inhibited to enter the area below the first position of the barrier. Note, that near the singularity of \u03c32(r) the effective potential barrier approaches E2 (see the discussion above), thus, the barrier increases with E2.\nIn Fig. 7 we studied the effect of lowering (increasing the mass of the black hole), from = 0.1 on, which is ten times the minimal value possible. We see, that with increasing mass (smaller ) the barrier structure with its singularities vanish. the effective potential for large black hole masses is plotted in the vicinity of \u03c1 = 32 , where the event horizon still exists. We note a sharp barrier, which is the result of introducing a minimal length. Thus, no particle can pass this point, while without the minimal length a particle can fall in. Here we see an important effect in taking into account the presence of a minimal length.\nIn Fig. 8 a zoom to near rm = 1.5 of the effective potential is depicted, for the\ncritical \u03b1 value of 818 . Without a minimal length, the event horizon is at r m = 3 2 , where according to our calculations still a repulsive barrier is noted up to at least\n= 10\u221218 (1018 times the Planck length), which is already of macroscopic size, compared to the scale of an elementary particle! This barrier is not seen anymore for = 10\u221220. That the effective potential approaches zero at r = 32m for \u03b1 = 81 8 and has there a minimum. For \u03b1 = 8, at the position of the event horizons r+ = 1.75211m and r\u2212 = 1.17221m, the potential is zero but does not acquire a minimum there. These observations can be understood from the expression of the\neffective potential in Eq. 41: The factor ( 1\u2212 2mr + B 6r4 ) is zero at the r positions mentioned and the effective potential reduces to E2\u2212 E 2\n\u03c32 . The \u03c3 2(r) acquires there\nthe value of 1, thus, the two terms cancel and the effective potential is zero. This is a unique behavior at the values of \u03b1 mentioned, which disappears when the \u03b1-value is larger than its limiting value, because then the factor in from of the last term in (41) is not zero anymore.\nIn Fig. 9 the angular momentum is now different from zero. Increasing the Energy of the particle, with \u03b1 = 12, the main effect is an increase of the barrier, i.e., similar as discussed before. Also, introducing a large angular momentum smooths out the singular structure of the potential.\nFinally, in Figs. 10 and 11 nearly macroscopic black holes (very small ) are studied, with a large angular momentum. Increasing \u03b1, only lifts the potential to higher values, which is due to the dark energy alone, no l-dependence is observed. According to (44) the effective potential always tends to E2 at r = 0. This is because\nthe \u03c32(r)-function goes to \u2212\u221e, which eliminates the last terms in (44). Approaching r = 0, the potential comes from very large values, which can be seen as a nearly vertical line in the figures.\n3.4. Minimal mass of an accelerating object Am = c 2/l\nIn44 its is argued that there exists a value for the minimal mass of a black hole, equal to the Plank mass. The main argument is that causality has to be maintained and that for smaller mass quantum effects set in, thus the classical theory is not valid any more.13,17 In this sub-section we show that due to the minimal length the limit of a minimal black hole mass increases.\nThe new mass scale is obtained when m is equal to the minimal length, which\nwe will put here as the Planck length (m = l), or m = l = 10\u221235meter.\nThe Planck mass is determined as\nMP = \u221a ~c k = ( 0.105457\u00d7 10\u221233 \u00d7 3\u00d7 108 6.67384\u00d7 10\u221211 ) 1 2\n= 0.217726\u00d7 10\u22127 kg\nSetting m = l implies = 1, which in turn leads to (using m = kMobject\nc2 , where\nMobject is the mass in kg)\n= l\nm =\nlc2\nkMobject (45)\nSetting now the limit = 1 and solving for Mobject, we obtain for the mass\nMobject = lc2\nk =\n9\u00d7 1016 \u00d7 6.62606\u00d7 10\u221234\n6.67384\u00d7 10\u221211 = 8.93557\u00d7 10\u22127 kg . (46)\n5\nThe ratio of Mobject to MP is\nMobject MP = 41 . (47)\nAs a consequence, the minimal mass of an object, corresponding to the minimal length scale, is 41 times larger than the Planck mass, a more stringent limit than the one proposed by S.

            "text": "In this contribution we investigated on the effects of a minimal length scale parameter in an extended version of General Relativity, called pseudo-complex General Relativity, which is equivalent to introducing a r-dependent mass.45 Thus, the pcGR can be seen as a representative other models which try to extend General\nRelativity. In past applications of pcGR the minimal length was ignored, but here we showed that it generates important differences for small black holes, which we will resume in what follows. It is important to stress that the minimal length is treated as a parameter and as a consequence the Lorentz symmetry is maintained. This represents a great advantage to theories treating the minimal length as a physical length, violating the Lorentz symmetry resulting in laborious, involved theories. One may ask if the use of a minimal length as a parameter is physical or not. In spite of this question, even when the theory presented is thought as an effective theory with a minimal length, the consequences discussed in this manuscript can serve as an orientation for more general theories, thus, be very useful.\nA minimal length is related to a maximal acceleration. Its effect is cast into a conformal factor \u03c32(r) of the metric. When the acceleration of a particle\u2019s tends to its maximal value, then the metric correction factor \u03c32(r) \u2212\u2192 0. At large distances the classical potential of GR is recovered, i.e., V 2eff (r) \u2212\u2192 1 as r \u2212\u2192\u221e.\nAs one main result, we showed that the effects of the minimal length can mainly be noted when the mass is of the order of the Planck mass and a few orders larger than it. For macroscopic black holes also some effect can be seen when \u03b1 = 818 , up to = 10\u221218, corresponding to a length of 10\u221215fm, which is of the order of the size of a hadron.\nBut there is also an effect in pcGR due to the coupling of the central mass to the size of the dark energy in the vicinity of a black hole. Depending on the value of B4 = bm 4, we can distinguish three cases, given by particular ranges of the parameter B4, where we only resume the results mainly for zero angular momentum (\u03bb = 0), though, also some remarks on \u03bb > 0 are included:\n\u2022 case a: B4 < 81m4/8 The range of = (l/m) is divided into two regions, the first is 0 \u2264 \u2264 1, where 0 marks the value above which no singularity in \u03c3 2 appears. In the\nsecond case ( < 0) the conformal factor \u03c3 2 s-hows singularities, as can be appreciated in Fig. 1 and 2, where the factor shows three and five points where \u03c32 passes to zero to infinite negative values. The region where \u03c32 is negative is unphysical and has to be excluded. The number and position of these singularities vary with . The exact value of 0 cannot be given but only estimated. We have two cases to consider. For the first one 0 \u2264 \u2264 1, the effective potential tends to E2 near r\u00b1 and the center r = 0. Moreover, the effective potential diverges when \u03c32(\u03c1) = 0 in the range r0 < r\u22121 < r\u22122 < r+1 < r+2. (The rm values refer to the position where \u03c3 2(r) passes through zero, see the main text.) The divergences appear as a potential barrier near r\u00b1 and at the center (r = 0). The potential barrier also increases with larger values of E and, as a consequence, the incoming massive particle of energy E would never falls into the black hole, i.e., the accretion of mass to the mini-black hole is stopped. Fig. 3 and subsequent figures show that the\neffective potentials can not be distinguished from each other at infinity. For \u03bb 6= 0, the effective potential still has the value of E2 near the center r = 0 and to the horizons r+ and r\u2212. There is a critical values of E, which determines the sign of effective potential; it becomes positive when E2 < \u03bb 2\n\u03c12c (1\u2212 2\u03c1c + \u03b1 6\u03c14c ) where \u03c1c is the value of \u03c1 when coming from \u03c1 = 0 the\neffective potential becomes negative (see Figs. 9-11). At a higher value of the critical energy, there are two singularities in which the factor \u03c32(r) = 0. The second case is for 1, which corresponds to the classical limit, i.e., the mass, in length units, of the black hole is much bigger than the minimal length. This means that \u03c32(r) \u2212\u2192 1. As consequence, the potential barrier in this case disappears. Due to this, the effects of the minimal length can be neglected. \u2022 case b: B4 = 81m4/8 In this case, according the value of = (l/m), we can also distinguish\ntwo ranges: In the first one, we have 0 \u2264 \u2264 1 (here 0 represents the value of for which it makes the transition from the first to the second range). The effective potential has three singularities, one near zero and two degeneraste ones at \u03c1e = re m = 3 2 (the index e refers to the event horizon) but the effective potential has the maximum value E2 for re = 3m 2 and near the center r = 0. These singularities act as a potential barrier (see, for example, Fig. 3). When \u03b1 = 818 the effective potential for a large mass black hole still shows a repulsive barrier at \u03c1 = 32 , which inhibits the falling in of particles, contrary to the case when no minimal length is taken into account, where the particle can pass the horizon. It is noticeable that at the position of the event horizon (\u03c1e = 3 2 ) there is still a very large barrier for relative large black hole masses, at least up to 1018l and the penetration of a particle is suppressed. For much larger black hole of = 10\u221220 masses this barrier seems to disappear. An = 10\u221218 corresponds to a length of 10\u221215cm, which implies the possibility that effects of the minimal length could be seen there, if \u03b1 = 818 and these small effect can be measured. For the second range, we consider 0 > , here = (l/m) is very small (i.e., the black hole is of macroscopic size), this means \u03c32(r) \u2212\u2192 1, in this case the effective potential has no singularities. This implies that there is also no potential barrier. It is clear that the effect of a minimal length is large when l \u2248 m, i.e., for microscopic black holes. Fig. 1 shows that \u03c32(r) diverges for the same values of \u03c1e. The \u03c3 2(\u03c1) always appears in the denominator of the effective potential (6) which thus equals E2. This means that the velocity of any incoming particle becomes zero (see equation (5)). The same behavior is seen in Fig. 3. For the radial motion, there are always divergencies (i.e., singularities) produced by the zero of the factor \u03c32(\u03c1). \u2022 case c: B4 > 81m4/8 For this case, in the range 0 \u2264 \u2264 1, the effective potential has also\na barrier in the potential, see Fig. 3 for \u03bb = 0. In addition, for \u03b1 = 12 (B > 81m4/8) the effective potential has always a maximum at E2 near r = 3m/2 and near r = 0. In addition, for \u03bb 6= 0 the effective potential has a critical value for the energy, in which the factor \u03c32(r) = 0, for which we can determined the sign of the effective potential: It is positive for E2 < \u03bb 2\n\u03c12c (1 \u2212 2\u03c1c + \u03b1 6\u03c14c ).\nFor 0 > , (\u03c1c = rc m is the critical value of \u03c1 where the effective potential becomes negative, when \u03c1c is approached from below) the effective potential is regular and finite, which means that the potential barrier disappears in this case, but the event horizon, which appears there, is not the effect of minimal length l.\nIn conclusion, in all cases the effect of minimal length l, or maximal acceleration, are noticeable only for small black hole masses, as a potential barrier at the horizons 0 < r0 < r\u2212 < r+ in which the effective potential diverges or has singularities. A \u201dsmall\u201d black hole can still be relatively large, as m = 1018l corresponds to a black hole mass of about 108kg. The height of the barriers increase with the particle energy. As a consequence , the formation of a larger black hole is stopped. Also the positions of maximal accelerations r\u00b11 and r\u00b12 were revealed. At these points, the effective potential has a barrier and a particle is prevented to pass this barrier."
