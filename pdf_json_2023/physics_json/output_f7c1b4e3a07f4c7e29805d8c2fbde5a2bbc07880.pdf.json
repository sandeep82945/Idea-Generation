    "abstractText": "Continual evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus has allowed for its gradual evasion of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) produced in response to natural infection or vaccination. The rapid nature of these changes has incited a need for the development of superior broad nAbs (bnAbs) and/or the rational design of an antibody cocktail that can protect against the mutated virus strain. Here, we report two angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 competing nAbs\u20148H12 and 3E2\u2014with synergistic neutralization but evaded by some Omicron subvariants. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the two nAbs synergistic neutralizing virus through a rigorous pairing permitted by rearrangement of the 472\u2013489 loop in the receptor-binding domain to avoid steric clashing. Bispecific antibodies based on these two nAbs tremendously extend the neutralizing breadth and restore neutralization against recent variants including currently dominant XBB.1.5. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the potential strategies for the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants toward the design of broad-acting antibody therapeutics and vaccines.",

The rapid nature of these changes has incited a need for the development of superior broad nAbs (bnAbs) and/or the rational design of an antibody cocktail that can protect against the mutated virus strain. Here, we report two angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 competing nAbs\u20148H12 and 3E2\u2014with synergistic neutralization but evaded by some Omicron subvariants. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the two nAbs synergistic neutralizing virus through a rigorous pairing permitted by rearrangement of the 472\u2013489 loop in the receptor-binding domain to avoid steric clashing. Bispecific antibodies based on these two nAbs tremendously extend the neutralizing breadth and restore neutralization against recent variants including currently dominant XBB.1.5. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the potential strategies for the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants toward the design of broad-acting antibody therapeutics and vaccines.\nKeywords SARS-CoV-2, broad neutralizing antibody, rearrangement, synergistic neutralization"

            "text": "With over 760 million confirmed cases and 6.9 million deaths globally (WHO., 2023), the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic\nand resultant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to threaten global public health and economic recovery. Rapid viral mutagenesis has resulted in the appearance of many variants of concern (VOCs) such as\nad040/7226747 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nPr ot\nei n\n& C\nel l\nBeta, Delta, Omicron, and various Omicron sublineages (Cocherie et al. 2022, Desingu and Nagarajan 2022, Qu et al., 2023b , Tegally et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2022), which currently dominated by Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 (Qu et al, 2023a, Uraki et al. 2023, Yue et al. 2023, Zhu et al. 2023). The substantial and rapid development of mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein has resulted in the diminished efficacy of currently available vaccines and immune therapies, as most were developed against the wild-type (WT) or early emergent variants (Cao et al. 2022a, b, Cele et al. 2022, Iketani et al. 2022, Tuekprakhon et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2022b). The further evolution of the virus and the resultant unpredictability of this pandemic require the continued design and development of next generation, superior, and cross-protective therapeutics and vaccines.\nNeutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are effective countermeasures against the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus: not only for antibody-based immunotherapy but also for understanding and defining the conservation of epitopes that may be used in the development of vaccines less likely to be hampered by frequent spike protein mutations (Crowe 2022). Yet, most previously approved antibody therapeutics, such as REGEN-COV2 (Regeneron), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (Lilly), and Bebtelovimab (LY-CoV1404, Lilly), have abolished efficacies against current variants without exception (Cao et al. 2022b, Cavazzoni 2022, Iketani et al. 2022, Miller et al. 2023, Planas et al. 2023). Although with diminished neutralization against newly emerging variants for most available nAbs, the combination of those nAbs by way of bispecific construction, has been demonstrated to extend the neutralizing breadth to some extent (Ku et al. 2022, Li et al. 2022, Miersch et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2022c). This information together indicates that the rational design of antibodies and/or their cocktails toward broad neutralization is still desired.\nIn this study, we generated two SARS-CoV-2 nAbs with potent and synergetic binding and neutralization efficiencies against various SARS-CoV-2 variants including early Omicron sublineages. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the mono- and double-antibody-bound immune complexes reveal an antibody-binding-induced rearrangement of the RBD. Such rearrangement of RBD is further demonstrated a common phenomenon, which inspire us to construct the bispecific antibodies based on the two nAbs. The resultant bispecific nAbs tremendously extend the neutralizing breadth and restore neutralization against XBB variants. These results expand our understanding of the dynamics of spike protein and the broad neutralization of nAbs, which will guide the rational design of antibody therapeutics and vaccines for combating the continually evolving virus."

            "text": "Synergetic neutralization of two angiotensinconverting enzyme 2-competing antibodies The two SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 8H12 and 3E2, were generated from mice immunized with recombinant spike proteins (S2P) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV sequentially. The neutralizing activities of two mAbs were evaluated using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based prototype SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and lentivirus (LV)-based prototype SARS-CoV-2 (LV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV (LV-SARSCoV) pseudoviruses, as well as the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 1A). Both mAbs exhibited potent neutralization efficacies against the prototyped SARS-CoV-2 with median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 34\u2013160 ng/mL, with 3E2 further conferring cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV (IC50: 49 ng/mL) (Fig. 1A).\nWe next assessed the neutralizing breadths of nAbs against LV-based pseudoviruses of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including previous VOCs/VOIs and the current circulating Omicron subvariants. 8H12 and 3E2 showed diverse neutralizing breadths against the variants. 8H12 could neutralize all variants that emerged before BA.4/5, whereas 3E2 was evaded by Omicron subvariants BA.2, BA2.12.1, BA.2.75, and BA.4/5 (Fig. 1B and Table S1). Despite some decreased or abolished neutralization activities, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) validated the high binding affinity of 8H12 against all tested spike proteins of the Omicron subvariants, except for the BA.4/5 spike (Figs. 1C and S1). Of note, although showed abolished neutralization against BA.4/5, 8H12 remain showed decreased but not eliminated affinity to BA.4/5 (Figs. 1C and S1). In contrast, 3E2 showed excellent binding affinities only to variants before BA.2 (Figs. 1C and S1). Binding assays further confirmed the diverse binding efficacies of two nAbs to the different spike proteins. (Figs. 1C and S2).\nWe noted in the SPR analysis that the combinations of two nAbs could simultaneously bind to the spike protein (Fig. 1D and 1E), which suggested that the two nAbs recognized diverse epitopes through noncompetitive binding to the RBD. Additionally, 8H12 and 3E2 each could completely block the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to the RBD (Fig. 1F). It is an established fact that the combination of two or more antibodies targeting distinct epitopes can enhance therapeutic efficacy and resist viral escape (Copin et al. 2021, Wang et al. 2022d, Xiong et al. 2022, Zhang et al. 2021). Thus, we next sought to evaluate the synergetic neutralization of two nAbs by the LV-based pseudoviruses. The double-antibody cocktail indeed displayed a significant synergistic effect against D614G strain with IC50 of 9 ng/ mL, an improvement of ~4- to 18-fold as\u00a0compared with that of the single antibody (Fig. 1G). The double-antibody cocktail also showed similar synergistic neutralizing efficacies to the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /proteincell/advance-article/doi/10.1093/procel/pw ad040/7226747 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nad040/7226747 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nPr ot\nei n\n& C\nel l\noriginal Omicron variants, but not to the BA.4/5 variant, probably due to the diminished neutralization activity of nAbs 8H12 and 3E2 to this variant (Table S1). These data demonstrated the synergetic neutralization potential of double-antibody cocktails against SARS-CoV-2 and most of its variants.\nCryo-EM structures of immune complexes To investigate the molecular basis for the synergetic neutralization of these two nAbs, we first determined the mono-antibody-bound WT spike (WT-S) immune complexes. Two medium-resolution cryo-EM structures revealed distinct binding modes of each nAbs, with\nstructural superimposition indicating potential steric hindrance between nAbs 8H12 and 3E2 (Figs. 2A\u2013C, S3 and Table S2); albeit the SPR results showed no such competition of binding (Fig. 1D and 1E). Thus, we next validated the simultaneous binding of double-antibody combination by cryo-EM analysis, with structure of WT-S:8H12:3E2 obtained at resolutions of 3.58 \u00c5 (Figs. 2D and S4). In order to elucidate the potent conformational changes induced by the simultaneous binding of 8H12 and 3E2, we next sought to improve the reconstruction resolution of WT-S:8H12 and WT-S:3E2. To this end, a third antibody 1C4 was included to cryo-EM reconstruction of 8H12- and 3E2-based double-antibody immune\nA WT-S:8H12 WT-S:3E2\n8H12\nRBD\nB\n3E2\nC\n8H12\nSteric clash\n3E2\n8H12D\n3E2\nWT-S:8H12:3E2\n8H12-VH\n8H12-VL\nWT RBD 3E2-VL\n3E2-VL\n8H12\n8H12-VH\n8H12-VL\nG\n3E2\nRBD\nWT-S:3E2:1C4 3E2\n3E2-VL\n3E2-VH\n1C4-VH\nF\n1C4 8H12-VH\n8H12-VL\n1C4-VH\n8H12 WT-S:8H12:1C4E\nH N487 F486\nV483 G485 E484\nF489\nF456\nQ493\nS477\nG476 A475\nY473\nL455\nK417\n8H12VH T103\nR52\nR92\nR30\n8H12-VL\nS52\nY49\nH91\nS477\nN487\nG476 Y490 Q493 K417"

Localized refinement of the RBD and variable domains of the fragment of antigen bindings (Fabs) were also performed to improve local resolutions and obtained at a resolutions of 3.59, 3.77, and 3.92 \u00c5, respectively (Figs. 2D\u2013F, S4 and Table S2). These structures indeed revealed the simultaneous binding potential of 8H12 and 3E2 (Fig. 2D), which cause the changing of binding orientation of 8H12 to avoid potent steric clashes between two antibodies (Fig. 2G). We further validated this phenomenon in the structures of immune complexes of BA.1-S:8H12:3E2 and BA.2-S:8H12:3E2, respectively (Figs. S5 and S6).\nGenerally, RBD-specific nAbs can be categorized into five classes (I\u2013V) according to their binding modes and receptor-blocking capacity (Barnes et al. 2020). Accordingly, 8H12 and 3E2 belong to Class I and Class IV, respectively (Fig. S7). The binding mode of 8H12 resembles previously reported nAbs S2E12 (Tortorici et al. 2020), AZD-8895 (Dong et al. 2021), 58G6 (Li et al. 2021a), XMA01 (Wang et al. 2022d), and WRAIR-2125 (Dussupt et al. 2021). This type of nAb binds to the left shoulder of the RBD (Fig. S7B). The epitope of 8H12 is composed of 14 RBD residues (K417, L455, F456, Y473, A475, G476, S477, V483, E484, G485, F486, N487, F489, and Q493) mainly focused on the 472\u2013489 loop (Fig. 2H), forming a network of eight hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2I).\nAs for 3E2, it mainly binds to an epitope on the opposite side of the 1C4 epitope; a similar binding mode is shown for nAbs S2X35 (Starr et al. 2021), S2X259 (Tortorici et al. 2021), VacW-209 (Ju et al. 2022), COVA1-16 (Liu et al. 2020), and CR3022 (Wu et al. 2020). The binding epitope comprises a total of 13 residues (A372, S375, G404, D405, R408, N437, Q498, T500, N501, G502, V503, G504, Y505, and Y508), of which D405, R408, Y505, and Y508 form seven hydrogen bonds mainly with the light chain of 3E2 (Fig. 2J and 2K). Superimposition of two nAbs with the ACE2 receptor shows that both 8H12 and 3E2 could sterically hinder the binding of ACE2 (Fig. S8), consistent with the result confirmed by SPR assay (Fig. 2G).\nPairing-binding induces conformational change at one loop in the RBD We next sought to investigate the structural basis for the simultaneous binding of the two theoretically colliding nAbs, 8H12 and 3E2. In the WT-S:8H12:1C4 and WT-S:3E2:1C4 structures, the binding of the two nAbs induced no any conformational changes to the bound RBD. However, structural alignment indicated significant steric hindrance between 8H12-VL and 3E2-VL, with a calculated clash volume of ~407 \u00c53 (the variable domain of one Fab: ~4,300 \u00c53) (Fig. 3A). Yet, superimposition of WT-S:8H12:3E2 (Fig. 3B) onto the former two structures revealed obvious conformational changes to\nboth 8H12 and its binding epitope (Fig. 3A), suggestive of 8H12/3E2 combinational binding-induced rearrangement of the bound RBD. Indeed, the structural comparison suggests that the RBD would undergo dramatic local rearrangement mainly in the aa. 472\u2013489 loop, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 3.13 \u00c5, and that this change would be accompanied by an outward extension of ~18\u00b0 compared with the apo-RBD (Fig. 3C). Additionally, whereas the 3E2 binding orientation remained unchanged (Fig. S9), we noted a clockwise rotation in 8H12 that helped to accommodate the simultaneous binding of two Fabs (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we noted a slight difference in the 8H12 binding epitopes between the two states of the 8H12-bound RBD (Fig. 3D and 3E): the 8H12 footprint on the rearranged RBD consisted of fewer (9) epitope residues, and accounted for a reduced interface area in the rearranged RBD (850.9 \u00c52 for apoRBD vs. 670.5 \u00c52 for rearranged RBD). Remarkably, K417 and Q493 in the rearranged RBD had moved away from the contact interface of 8H12 but this did not affect its activity. In both cases, the bulk side chain of F486 participates in critical interactions with 8H12 via inserting itself into a hydrophobic pocket formed on the surface of 8H12 (Fig. S10), which mimics ACE2\u2013RBD interactions among Class I/II nAbs (Barnes et al. 2020, Du et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2022d); this may explain the evasion of 8H12 to BA.4/5, as this antibody harbors an F486V mutation on the RBD.\nConsidering that both the nAbs 8H12 (Class I) and 3E2 (Class IV) are ACE2 blockers and showed high efficacy in blocking viral infection, we wondered whether a common phenomenon exists for such double-antibody-binding-induced RBD rearrangement. 8H12-like nAbs S2E12 (Tortorici et al. 2020), XMA01 (Wang et al. 2022d), and 3E2-like nAbs S2X35 (Starr et al. 2021), VacW-209 (Ju et al. 2022) were selected for further cryo-EM analysis (Fig. 3F\u2013I). The combinations of 3E2/S2E12, S2X35/8H12, 3E2/ XMA01, and VacW-209/8H12 showed increased calculated clash volumes ranging from 45 to 853 \u00c53, implying widespread theoretical collision between those Class I and Class IV nAbs (Fig. 3F\u2013H). Yet, similar to our experience, all of these antibody combinations showed simultaneous binding activity to the spike trimer through SPR analysis (Fig. S11). Cryo-EM reconstructions of the WT-S in complex with different double-antibody combinations revealed that the combinations of 3E2/S2E12, S2X35/8H12, and 3E2/XMA01 can bind the RBD (Figs. 3F\u2013H and S12). In contrast, the 3E2-like VacW-209 and 8H12 cannot bind to the same RBD simultaneously (Fig. 3I), probably due to their excessively large clash volume (853 \u00c53). Nonetheless, 8H12 and VacW-209 were able to simultaneously bind to a trimer by targeting different RBDs (Fig. S13).

It seems that the larger the theoretical clash volume of the two antibodies, the more serious the structural variation, indicating the allosteric loop as being a critical region in the coordination of simultaneous binding. This structural information not only provides evidence for the existence of multiple potential cooperative mechanisms for synergetic neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 but also demonstrates the rational design of antibody cocktails using Class I and Class IV nAb combinations.\nBispecific antibodies recovery neutralization against recent variants including XBB.1.5 Given that the conformational changes of the RBD could be induced by the pairing binding of 8H12 and 3E2, we sought to construct the bispecific antibodies containing both 8H12 and 3E2 to enhance their efficacy as well as neutralizing breadth. Structurally, 8H12 and 3E2 are close to each other when simultaneously bind to the RBD, with a distance of ~33.4 \u00c5 between C-terminal of 3E2 VL and N-terminal of 8H12 VH (Fig. 4A), which grants the appropriate relative positions to construct a tandem scFvs format bispecific antibody that fused into human IgG1-Fc (named Bis-83-1) (Fig. 4B). Another tetravalent format bispecific antibody using the heavy chain of IgG biterminal linked with double scFvs (named Bis-83-2) was also constructed (Fig. 4B). The human IgG1-Fc chimeric formats of two mouse origin nAbs were also constructed as control and name as C8H12 and C3E2, respectively (Fig. 4B). SDS-PAGE and HPLC results confirmed the correct construction of two chimeric and two bispecific antibodies, and revealed the expected molecular weights (Figs. 4C and S14).\nTo test the binding properties of two bispecific antibodies, we analyzed the binding affinities of Bis-83-1 and Bis-83-2 against the WT-S protein by SPR. Compared with the parental mAbs, both Bis-83-1 and Bis-83-2 bound to WT-S protein with more than 100-fold increased binding potencies and reach picomolar level affinities (0.002 nmol/L) (Figs. 4D and S15), indicating the simultaneous binding of multiple scFvs in one antibody to the spike protein. As the fact that the BQ.1.1 and XBB RBDs showed drastically decreased or abolished binding ability to the parental C8H12 and C3E2 (Figs. 4D and S15), we next evaluated whether the binding potency of Bis-83-1 and Bis-83-2 to the RBDs of BQ.1.1 and XBB were increased. As expected, both Bis-83-1 and Bis-83-2 showed dramatically increased binding affinities against both the RBDs of BQ.1.1 and XBB (11.40\u201322.40 nmol/L) (Figs. 4D and S15).\nWe next verified whether two formats of bispecific antibodies could extend their neutralizing breadth. The pseudotyped WT SARS-CoV-2 as well as recent Omicron sublineages BA.4/5, BF.7, BQ.1.1, XBB, XBB.1, and XBB.1.5 were included in the neutralizing evaluation. Both Bis83-1 and Bis-83-2 neutralized WT SARS-CoV-2 effectively with IC50 values of 0.009 and 0.005 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Fig. 4E). Similar to BA.4/5, the BF.7, BQ.1.1 and XBBs sublineages harbor F486V/S/P mutation (Fig. S14), which devastatingly disrupt the interaction between the RBD and those Class I nAbs including 8H12 (Cao et al. 2022b, 2023, Wang et al. 2023). Additionally, D405N and R408S that emerged in BA.2 and thereafter variants resulted in abolishing the activity of 3E2 (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the two parental chimeric mAbs lost their neutralizing efficacies against all tested Omicron subvariants as expected (Fig. 4D). However, of note, the two bispecific antibodies exhibited broad neutralizing activities against all these tested Omicron subvariants including BA.4/5, BF.7, BQ.1.1, XBB, XBB.1, and XBB.1.5, with IC50 values ranging from 0.360 to 5.590 \u00b5g/mL (Fig. 4D), in accord with the increased binding affinities of bispecific antibodies to those variants (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data suggested that 8H12/3E2-based bispecific antibodies with enhanced binding affinities could recover the neutralization against recent variants and extend their neutralizing breadth to achieve broad-spectrum neutralization."

            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The Omicron VOCs are subvariants BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5, which have demonstrated strong evasion from antibody therapeutics and vaccines (Cao et al. 2022a, b, Cele et al. 2022, Gruell et al. 2022, Iketani et al. 2022, Sheward et al. 2022, Tuekprakhon et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2022a). Furthermore, Omicron is continuously evolving and this has led to the emergence of various new subvariants including BA.2.75 and BA.4.6, as well as BJ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, and BA.2.10 (XBB) reported more recently (WHO 2022). The accumulated mutations on the RBD allow the virus to escape nAb neutralization, including by even the most potent bnAbs. For example, the currently approved antibody therapeutic, LY-CoV1404, which potently neutralizes all currently known VOCs, has recently been reported to be evaded by BJ.1, BR.1, and BQ.1.1, presumably due to mutations on R346 and/or N444 (Cao et al., 2023, Westendorf et al. 2022). This highlights a continuous need to identify broader nAbs that are effective against emerging variants.\nWT-S in complex with 3E2-like VacW-209 and 8H12.

Many antibody screening and selection strategies have been raised for the generation of more potent or broader nAbs. One strategy is to develop a pan-sarbecovirus broad nAb. There are several nAbs with cross-neutralization against SARSCoV-2 and other sarbecoviruses, such as S309 (Pinto et al. 2020), S2X259 (Tortorici et al. 2021), 7D6 (Li et al. 2021b), S2H97 (Starr et al. 2021), ADG-2 (Rappazzo et\nal. 2021), DH1047 (Martinez et al. 2022), as well as 3E2 in this study. However, most of these nAbs are evaded by Omicron and its subvariants. Indeed, our results showed that the SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV cross-neutralizing nAb 3E2 was unable to neutralize the Omicron BA.2 and thereafter variants, and therefore demonstrated a narrower breadth of efficacy than 8H12, although the latter is SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb.

In other words, the conserved epitopes of pan-sarbecovirus bnAbs (e.g., 3E2\u2019s) do not exhibit equivalent potency in action to those SARS-CoV-2-specific bnAbs (e.g., 8H12). Therefore, a better selection strategy for broad nAb candidates is still urgently needed.\nOne approach to limit the risk of antibody resistance and provide broad synergetic neutralizing capability is to use antibody combinations to target different viral conserved epitopes (Crowe 2022, Zost and Vogt 2022). Typically, antibody cocktail rational design tends to select non-competing nAbs (Crowe 2022, Carter and Rajpal 2022). However, our recent work on coxsackievirus described the benefit of a counterintuitive antibody cocktail containing three competing nAbs that target the vulnerable receptor-binding determinant (Zheng et al. 2022). We observed synergy among the competing nAbs through a cooperative mechanism in which the binding of one nAb added or potentiated the binding of another nAb with an overlapping epitope, and these multi-antibody functions cooperatively disrupted the coxsackievirus virions (Zheng et al. 2022). SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktails that are approved or in development always are selected based on non-overlapping antibody designs. However, here again, we show that, despite with theoretical collision, Class I and Class IV nAbs could simultaneously bind to the RBD and confer not only synergetic neutralization but also rearrangement of the bound RBD.\nIt\u2019s a fact that the high binding affinity of cell receptor ACE2 largely influence the antibody evasion by variants. In this study, we indeed demonstrated that 8H12 showed reduced but not diminished binding potencies to variants that have emerged since BA.2. However, the neutralization of 8H12 against relative variants is completely abolished, indicating that the influence of neutralizing efficacy is more sensitive than binding efficacy. Indeed, it seems that there is no any available nAb would maintain its broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against the evolving virus. Increasing the binding affinities of currently by antibody engineering, e.g., bispecific construction to increase binding avidity, would be an alternative way to achieve broad neutralization. In this study, we proved the try to broaden the neutralizing breadth of currently available nAbs by different bispecific constructions. Two formats of bispecific antibodies were demonstrated with dramatically increased binding affinity and restored neutralization against those escaped variants. Similar studies of bispecific antibodies with increased affinities and broadened neutralizing breadth were also reported by multiple groups (Ku et al. 2022, Li et al., 2022, Miersch et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2022c), indicating a realistic way for antibody engineering to broaden the neutralizing breadth. Taken together, these findings shed light on the rational design of antibody therapeutics against the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 viruses."
