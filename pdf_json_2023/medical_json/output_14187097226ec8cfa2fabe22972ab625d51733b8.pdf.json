    "abstractText": "CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14) is an important chemokine involved in infection and immunity and plays an important role in a variety of immune-related diseases. The 446 bp cDNA sequence of the CXCL14 gene in yaks was obtained. Additionally, the prokaryotic expression vector of the CXCL14 protein with a molecular weight of 27 kDa was successfully constructed and expressed. The proliferation activities and migration abilities of spleen macrophages were significantly inhibited after treatment with the CXCL14 protein at different concentrations (1, 10 and 20 \u03bcg/mL) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8) and interferon-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the expression of anti-inflammatory factor interleukin 10 (IL10) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The contents of inflammatory factors in the supernatant of cells were detected using ELISA, and it was also found that the contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL6 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2) were significantly increased under different CXCL14 protein concentrations (p < 0.05). Finally, the exogenous addition of CXCL14 inhibited the activity, clonal formation and migration of hepatoma cells (HepG2). Additionally, after HepG2 cells were treated with 20 \u03bcg/mL CXCL14 protein for 12 h, 24 h and 36 h, the expression levels of BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) and the BCL2-associated X apoptosis regulator (BAX) were increased to varying degrees, while the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A), the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) genes decreased compared to the control group. In conclusion, the CXCL14 protein can inhibit the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells by inducing the expression of macrophage pro-inflammatory factors and activating apoptosisrelated genes to exert innate immunity. These results are helpful to further study the function of the CXCL14 protein and provide research data for the innate immune mechanism of yaks under harsh plateau environments.",

            "text": "Macrophages, as remarkable plastic immune cells, play an important role in innate and cellular immunity in mammals. Macrophage polarization is a process that exhibits a specific phenotype and responds functionally to the microenvironmental stimuli and signals encountered in each specific tissue. For example, M1 macrophages have strong anti-microbial and anti-tumor activities, while M2 macrophages can inhibit chronic inflammatory reactions through anti-inflammatory effects [1]. CXCL14 is a highly conserved and bioactive cytokine, which is responsible for activating the infiltration and cell mobilization of immune cells, thus participating in immune responses and playing an important role in a variety of immune-related diseases [2,3]. It is not only expressed in many normal cells but has also been reported to be closely related to the occurrence of cancer-related diseases [4]. In addition, it has been reported that CXCL14 in some mammals not only has certain bactericidal activity but can also directly enhance the antibacterial function of macrophages to prevent infection caused by a variety of microorganisms [5,6]. The reason for the above function could be related to the striking common structural characteristics of a large number of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as defensins and cathelicidins, including large plaques with positive charges in their molecular surfaces, three antiparallel \u03b2 chains shown in \u03b2-defensins, and the typical C-terminal \u03b1 helix of cathelicidin LL-37 [5\u20137]. Further, studies have found that CXCL14-deficient mice, when exposed to the cold, showed a decreased recruitment of macrophages and the impaired activity of brown adipose tissue, thus affecting their ability to resist cold environments [8]. Yaks (Bos grunniens), as one of the endemic species of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau (QTP) at a high altitude, have strong adaptability and immunity due to the harsh plateau environment such as low temperatures, low oxygen and high ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, yaks have been a representative model animal in the study of altitude adaptation and have long been the best research object to explore the mechanism of animal adaptation to the harsh environment of low temperature and hypoxia [9]. However, there are few reports on how CXCL14 plays the related functions of innate immunity in yaks. In this study, the CXCL14 protein of the Maiwa yak was analyzed, characterized and overexpressed in vitro, and immune-related factors of the obtained protein were studied in spleen macrophages of yak. These results provide certain reference materials for the anti-inflammatory mechanism of yaks."

Macrophage activity was increased under the treatment of 1 \u00b5g/mL, 10 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL of the CXCL14 protein, and cell activity under the treatment of 1 \u00b5g/mL and 10 \u00b5g/mL CXCL14 protein was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05) (Figure 3B).

The above results were also verified by the detection of inflammatory factors in cell supernatant using ELISA.

However, there was no correlation between the increase in inflammatory factors and the concentration of protein treatment. The contents of TNF-\u03b1 and COX2 were the highest under the treatment of 20 \u00b5g/mL of the CXCL14 protein, while the content of IL-6 was the highest under the treatment of 10 \u00b5g/mL of the CXCL14 protein (Figure 3D).

First, different concentrations of the exogenous CXCL14 protein were added to yak macrophages, and it was found that different concentrations of the CXCL14 protein had no significant effect on cell morphology (Figure 3A). Macrophage activity was increased under the treatment of 1 \u00b5g/mL, 10 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL of the CXCL14 protein, and cell activity under the treatment of 1 \u00b5g/mL and 10 \u00b5g/mL CXCL14 protein was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05) (Figure 3B). In addition, RT-qPCR showed that the expressions of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in yak macrophages increased with the increase in the CXCL14 protein\u2019s concentration and were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of IL10 was inhibited under different CXCL14 protein concentrations, and the expression of IL10 (1 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL) was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05) (Figure 3C). The above results were also verified by the detection of inflammatory factors in cell supernatant using ELISA. The results showed that the contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and COX2 in the cell supernatant treated with the CXCL14 protein (1 \u00b5g/mL, 10 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL) were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between the increase in inflammatory factors and the concentration of protein treatment. The contents of TNF-\u03b1 and COX2 were the highest under the treatment of 20 \u00b5g/mL of the CXCL14 protein, while the content of IL-6 was the highest under the treatment of 10 \u00b5g/mL of the CXCL14 protein (Figure 3D). These results suggest that the CXCL14 protein might be an important regulator of the M1 polarization of macrophages, and the overexpression of CXCL14 could play a natural immune role by inducing macrophages to M1 polarization.

Discussion As the largest lymphoid organ in mammals, the spleen not only distributes highly ordered T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes but also contains more macrophages, making it an important organ for the immune response against bacteria and fungi [2]. Early studies have reported that CXCL14 has been found to be expressed in a variety of immune cells or non-immune cells under different stimuli; therefore, it can play a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory role in the body [4,5]. At present, CXCL14 has been widely studied in humans and mice but has rarely been reported in yak. Yaks show low sensitivity to the harsh plateau environment and have enhanced viability in harsh environments, which could be related to their unique morphological, physiological and adaptive characteristics. In a previous study, the temporal differential expression analysis of the CXCL14 gene in the spleen of yaks showed that the CXCL14 gene increased gradually with age, and its expression reached the highest level in adulthood, indicating that the CXCL14 gene plays an important role in the development and functional improvement of spleen tissue, which could be related to the chemokines necessary for the development of macrophages [12]. Moreover, with the rapid development of bioinformatics tools, it is very easy and fast to predict the function of proteins. This study predicts that the yak CXCL14 protein has a stable low-complexity domain, which could be the key to its function. At the same time, the CXCL14 protein was also found to have the potential characteristics of antimicrobial peptides (such as an overall positive charge, containing \u03b1 helix, etc.). The Escherichia coli BL21 virulence test also proved that the CXCL14 protein induced by prokaryotic expression in vitro had obvious inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli, indicating that the yak CXCL14 protein showed strong antibacterial activity.

CXCL14 is not only involved in the inflammatory response of the body but also in the regulation of ma y biological processes [5]. However, there are few studies on the mechanism of inflammatory response in yak macrophages. In primary yak sple n macrophages, it was found that the CXCL14 protein could stimulate the pro-inflammatory response of cells\nAnimals 2023, 13, 3036 10 of 12\nat a certain concentration and promote the expression of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL6, IL8 and TNF-\u03b1 to significantly increase, while the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL10 decreased significantly. In general, macrophages can often switch between these two states of classically activated macrophages, which secrete pro-inflammatory factors such as IL6, IL8 and TNF-\u03b1, and those of vicarious activated macrophages, which produce anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 [13]. Therefore, it is speculated that the CXCL14 protein may induce the polarization of macrophage M1 to participate in the innate immune response to prevent the invasion of pathogens and ensure that the body is not damaged; further tests are needed to determine its related mechanism. The phenotypic states of macrophages are closely associated with a variety of diseases, especially cancer. Tumor-associated macrophages are the main immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, and M1 macrophages have strong anti-tumor activity. Increasing the proportion of M1-type macrophages is an important indicator of good prognosis in cancer [14,15]. Although CXCL14 is a relatively novel gene in the chemokine family, it has long been reported that CXCL14 is closely related to the occurrence of breast cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and other cancers [16\u201322]. It has been found that CXCL14 is significantly downregulated in HPV-positive head/neck cancer and cervical tissue specimens, and restoring the expression of CXCL14 in oropharyngeal cancer cells could clear tumors in mice [23]. In addition, some studies also found that CXCL14 was significantly down-regulated in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma tissues [24]. This study also found that the CXCL14 protein inhibited the growth activity and migration ability of liver cancer cells to a certain extent, which is similar to that reported by others in liver cancer [19]. In addition, the human CXCL14 protein also had similar effects in other cancer cells, such as cervical cancer, esophageal cancer and prostate cancer [25\u201328]. Moreover, the apoptotic genes of BAK and BAX were significantly increased, and proliferation-related genes such as HIF1A, mTOR and CDK1 were also inhibited at certain treatment times. This further indicates that the yak CXCL14 protein has a certain promotion effect on the apoptosis of HepG2. However, the pathway of cancer cell apoptosis, when induced by CXCL14, could be related to nuclear apoptosis and mitochondrial apoptosis [29\u201331]. As an exogenous substance, the specific anti-cancer mechanism of the yak CXCL14 protein remains to be further studied. However, this study reveals the potential function of CXCL14 in yak spleen tissue and determines the pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects of the yak CXCL14 protein, which could provide some basic data for exploring the immune mechanism of plateau animals and screening anti-cancer drugs derived from animal protein sources in the future."
