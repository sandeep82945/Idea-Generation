    "abstractText": "Enforcing balanced electron\u2013hole injection into the emitter layer of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) remains key to maximizing the quantum efficiency over a wide current density range. This was previously thought not possible for quantum dot (QD) emitters because of their very deep energy bands. Here, we show using Mesolight blue-emitting CdZnSeS/ZnS QDs as a model that its valence levels are in fact considerably shallower than the corresponding band maximum of the bulk semiconductor, which makes the ideal double-type-I injection/confinement heterostructure accessible using a variety of polymer organic semiconductors as transport and injection layers. We demonstrate flat external quantum efficiency characteristics that indicate near perfect recombination within the QD layer over several decades of current density from the onset of device turn-on of about 10 lA cm , for both normal and inverted QLED architectures. We also demonstrate that these organic semiconductors do not chemically degrade the QDs, unlike the usual ZnMgO nanoparticles. However, these more efficient injection heterostructures expose a new vulnerability of the QDs to in device electrochemical degradation. The work here opens a clear path towards next-generation ultra-high-performance, all-solution-processed QLEDs.",

Nevertheless, the device structures are still sub-optimal from the device physics point-of-view.\nThe prevailing QLED charge injection heterostructures are of type-II, with energy offsets at both valence and conduction levels in the same direction, whereas the ideal heterostructure should be type-I, with offsets in the opposite direction. In the ideal double-type-I injection heterostructure (Fig. 1a), holes are injected by a doped hole injection layer (HIL) with the Fermi level aligned close to the valence band (VB) edge of the hole transport layer (HTL), which is further aligned to, or marginally deeper than, the valence level of the QD core in the emitter layer (EML). Correspondingly, electrons are injected by a doped electron injection layer (EIL) with the Fermi level aligned close to the conduction band (CB) edge of the electron transport layer (ETL), which is aligned to, or marginally shallower than, the a Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, Lower Kent Ridge Road, S117550, Singapore.

Although there are recent reports of very high performance, that performance is strongly peaked over a narrow current density and luminance range, due to the inability of the diode structure to confine electrons and holes over a wide range of operating conditions. Our manuscript reveals the way to fix this, clarifying the general requirement for the double type-I injection heterostructure that has been neglected in the science and technology of QLEDs for the last 30 years. We report here a new approach to device architecture using organic semiconductor layers to implement this double type-I charge-confinement heterostructure through a novel filmtransfer method. We discover unity internal quantum efficiency with flat external quantum efficiency characteristics for blue QLEDs, limited only by the radiative efficiency of the emitter. This sets a new benchmark for performance. The approach is also applicable to other novel semiconductors, including perovskites.\nMaterials Horizons\nCOMMUNICATION\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This arrangement minimizes energy losses in the carriers before they recombine. Within the EML, carrier tunneling across the QD shell should relieve the need for transport edges of the HTL and ETL to match those of the shell. The ideal injection heterostructure should also present a large unfavorable energy offset to block the exit and thus confine the opposite carriers. The device type-I heterostructure discussed here is different from the internal type-I heterostructure of the core/shell employed to confine the electron and hole wavefunctions to the QD core for efficient radiative recombination.4\nDue to the deep energy levels of the QD semiconductor and limited availability of charge transport materials, however, the actual devices are usually of the double-type-II heterostructure, especially for blue-emitting QLEDs (Fig. 1b). These devices present considerable thermodynamic barriers to the injection of both carriers into the EML, which causes the diode built-in potential (Vbi) to fall below the emission bandgap. Furthermore, as a consequence of the inevitable asymmetry, electron and hole currents are highly imbalanced at device turn-on. Although the low carrier mobilities within the EML cause carrier density pileup that advantageously improves the current balance, and hence recombination efficiency, the external QE\u2013current density (Z\u2013J) characteristic still tend to exhibit peaking over a relatively narrow current density and luminance range.5,6\nThis roll-off of QE at high current densities, often called \u2018\u2018droop\u2019\u2019, has a number of fundamental contributing factors, including electric field quenching,7 Auger recombination,8,9 and Joule heating.10 But an overarching one would be imperfect recombination at both the high and particularly at the low current density range, due to imbalanced injection and/or carrier leakage from the EML. Similar efficiency roll-off also plagues LEDs based on other colloidal nanocrystals, such as perovskites.11,12\nWhether type-I injection heterostructures can be fabricated depends on the energy levels of the QD core. The semiconductors making up the core of practical QDs, whether Cd-based II\u2013VI, In-based III\u2013V or (Cu,Zn)(In,Ga)S I\u2013III\u2013VI, generally have very deep VB maximum. For example, CdSe(11%10) has an ionization energy (IE) of 6.6 eV. 13 Curvature, composition grading and, particularly,\nsurface termination effects in their QDs may upshift the energy levels. But the extent of this effect is not fully understood. As a model of high-performance blue-emitting QDs (\u2018blue-QD\u2019), we choose Mesolights CdZnSeS/ZnS core/shell QDs. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy suggests that these are gradient-alloyed QDs14 that comprise a small CdZnSeS core and a thick shell of ZnSeS terminating in an outer ZnS layer coated with oleic acid (for XPS, see Fig. S1, ESI\u2020).\nUltraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) shows that the VB density-of-states extends well above the 7.5 eV onset expected of bulk ZnS to ca. 6.2 eV (Fig. 2). The emission intensifies with vacuum UV exposure, which evidences its VB origin, since the shell is increasingly exposed by VUV-induced dehydrogenation of the unsaturated organic acid coating.15 The inelastic mean free path of photoelectrons in this energy range for these materials is about 3 \u00c5; therefore, only the shell can be observed. Taking the onset as IE of the QD ZnS shell, we estimate from a rigid shift that the effective valence and conduction levels of the core are 5.7 and 2.9 eV, respectively.16,17 These values are considerably shallower than often assumed for blue-emitting CdSe-based cores, but are in good agreement with systematics of diode behaviour (vide infra). They open the possibility to find polymer organic semiconductors with matching transport levels. For example, poly (9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-1,4-phenylene-N-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)imino-1,4-phenylene) (mTFF), with an effective VB edge at 5.8 eV, could offer a suitable HTL,18 while the usual poly (9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-1,4-phenylene-N-(p-sec-butylphenyl) imino-1,4-phenylene) (TFB), at 5.5 eV, is too shallow. Poly(9,9bis(4-octylphenyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFOP) and poly(9,9dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-benzo[2,1,3]-thiadiazole-4,7-diyl) (F8BT), with estimated CB edges at 2.4 and 2.9 eV, respectively, could provide suitable ETLs. The chemical structures of these and other relevant materials are shown in Fig. 3a. The resultant energy-level diagrams, compared to the conventional \u2018standard\u2019 one, are shown in Fig. 3b.

To circumvent this challenge in a proofof-concept, we employed a float-off and pick-up method to lay down the upper transport film (Fig. 3c). This method is based on the release-layer method.31,32 The desired polymer semiconductor is first spin-cast over a poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC) film on a clean glass substrate and Millipores water is then admitted via a syringe pump to dissolve away the PDDAC underlayer to float off the polymer overlayer. The destination device stack with its QD film uppermost is then inverted over this layer to pick it up from the water surface by van der Waals contact. This method is highly repeatable yet gentle. It does not disrupt the QD film nor damage the transferred film, as evidenced by identical JV characteristics of the transferred film to a spin-cast film of the same thickness (Fig. 3d).

            "text": "We show here from time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements that the polymer transport films do not degrade the PL lifetime (t) nor quantum yield (Zpl) of the Mesolight\ns blueQDs, unlike a typical ZnMgO nanoparticle film. The QDs in octane give bi-exponential decay with t of 9.0 ns (67%) and 4.5 ns (33%) (Table 1). Assuming the QDs exhibit a single radiative lifetime with no non-emissive sub-population in solution, the quantum yield is related to the lifetimes by: Zpl \u00bc P\ni Aiti tr , where Ai is the\nsub-population fraction, ti is the excited state lifetime and tr is the radiative lifetime. For a Zpl of 70%, specified by the manufacturer, tr is 10.7 ns. In contrast, a 20 nm-thick QD film spin-cast on fused\nsilica gives Zpl of 42% in an integrating sphere and monoexponential PL decay with t of 4.3 ns (Fig. 4a; Table 1, S/N 2). When the QD is spin-cast over an underlying polymer transport film, whether TFB, mTFF or PFOP, its lifetime is unchanged (Fig. 4b and c; Table 1, S/N 4, 6, 14). When a ZnMgO (Zn0.9Mg0.1O) layer is deposited over these, however, the QD film becomes less emissive, as evidenced by shortening of t1 and drastic decrease of A1 (S/N 5 cf. 4; 12 cf. 6). The quenching of QD luminescence by ZnMgO has previously been noted.33\u201336 In contrast, when a polymer transport layer is overlaid, the t of the QDs remains unchanged at 4.3 ns (S/N 10 cf. 6; 18 cf. 14). Thus, the polymer transport layers do not degrade the luminescent properties of the QD film, unlike ZnMgO. Possible contact with water during pickup also does not harm the QD film (S/N 8 cf. 6; 16 cf. 14). Nevertheless, the QD film itself slowly loses some Zpl over time, whether on fused silica (S/N 3 cf. 2), a polymer layer (S/N 7 cf. 6; 15 cf. 14), or sandwiched between polymer layers (S/N 11 cf. 10; 19 cf. 18). This loss is about 25% relative, even in a glovebox.\nNext, we elucidate from the systematic behavior of QLEDs with ZnMgO as the EIL but different HIL/HTL stacks that neither ZnMgO nor PEDT/TFB are good respective charge injection layers for the blue-QDs.\n\u2018Standard\u2019 PEDT/TFB/QD/ZnMgO/Al QLEDs\nThis is the design widely used in current research. Their JVL and Z\u2013J characteristics are shown in Fig. 5a, a few hours and about 10 days after fabrication. The characteristics show little current leakage below 2 V, less than 0.1 mA cm 2, indicating that the ZnMgO layer here is \u2018optimal\u2019, with similar behavior as aged films.37,38 The full-cycle sweep shows that electron injection improves in the returning half-cycle. This hysteresis is characteristic of the ZnMgO contact but often neglected in the literature.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Both JV and Z\u2013J degrade with storage over days, but the decline in JV can be partly recovered by pre-biasing the QLED. Thus, electron injection by ZnMgO is unstable, and appears to be dependent on polarization. Related ageing characteristics have been discussed in the literature.35,36,39,40 The key feature here is that Z\u2013J also declines monotonically with time in storage. This points to a fundamental chemical incompatibility between ZnMgO and the blue-QDs.\nTo interpret the JV characteristics, we computed the ideal characteristics with only the drift current contribution in the Mott\u2013Gurney approximation (see Methods).41 The model assumes Ohmic injection throughout the QLED with perfect recombination within the EML, incorporating carrier-densitydependent mobility (Fig. S2, ESI\u2020).42,43 It has no free input parameters. The apparent built-in voltage V* is taken to be the true built-in potential Vbi given by 1/e (feff,1 feff,2), where feff,i is the effective work function of each of the two contacts (1 = hole, 2 = electron).29 This approach enables simple comparison between the experimental results and spacecharge-limited-conduction JV to determine whether at least one of the contacts is limiting, which is sufficient for our purpose, without detailed knowledge of all the contacts.\nFor this standard QLED, Vbi is expected to be 2.0 V, where feff,1 for PEDT:PSSH is 5.2 eV, and feff,2 for Zn0.9Mg0.1O is assumed to be 3.2 eV. While bulk ZnO(11%20) has an electron affinity (EA) of 4.4 eV, ZnO nanoparticles can exhibit a work function as shallow as 3.5 eV, due to surface hydration,13,44 which may decrease to 3.2 eV at 10 mol% Mg doping through a CB shift.22,45 The computed ideal JV is approached by the experimental JV only at high voltages and in the reverse half-cycle. Since the PEDT/TFB contact is Ohmic,46 and so is ZnMgO/Al, this indicates an injection resistance into the QD EML. Experimentally, Z\u2013J falls to zero for J t 1 mA cm 2 (V t 3.2 V), suggesting that the current is highly imbalanced there.\nModified hole injection stacks\nQLEDs with PEDT/mTFF or pTFF/mTFF as the hole injection stack give significantly improved results. Substituting TFB with mTFF produces a limiting contact at the PEDT/mTFF interface due to the injection barrier from PEDT to mTFF that frustrates buildup of a d-doped interface there, particularly at low\nFig. 4 Time-resolved photoluminescence decay.

Yet Z\u2013J shows a higher Z (6\u20137%) that peaks at a lower J (10 mA cm 2) at its exponentially rising portion, where the hole current is curtailed. The better resultant electron\u2013hole recombination efficiency then indicates that electron injection by ZnMgO is previously limiting. The standard QLED suffers strong hole leakage at low V.\nA second substitution of PEDT with the ultrahighworkfunction pTFF then turns the hole-injection stack Ohmic.18 Vbi increases to 2.5 V, because feff,1 increases to 5.7 eV, pinned just outside the VB edge of mTFF.18 The experimental JV matches the ideal one more closely and with less hysteresis than before. Z\u2013J broadens to give a quasi-plateau at ca. 7%, with a 90%-width spanning 10 to 100 mA cm 2. Clearly, the electron\u2013hole recombination efficiency has improved considerably and over a wider current density range. Both JV and Z\u2013J at high V exceed those of the standard QLED. Thus, pTFF/mTFF clearly provides a better hole injection stack than PEDT/TFB, consistent with its energylevel diagram, where the VB edge of mTFF is better matched to the valence level of the QD. Then, through a feedback mechanism, this improves electron injection from the opposite contact. However, there is significant hole leakage through the ZnMgO layer at low V, and the standard QLED is hole-rich throughout operation.\nNevertheless, the JV of the improved QLED still decays to one-tenth of its initial value over 10 days, similar to the standard QLED, although its Z\u2013J decays less, to just one-quarter instead of one-tenth. In all cases, this Z loss is irreversible, pointing to an underlying degradation of the QD layer. In general, QLED characteristics with ZnMgO contacts are highly variable, but the above trends are reproducible. See Fig. S3 (ESI\u2020) for another set of devices fabricated months apart. Thus, it is clear that the ZnMgO/QD contact does not provide efficient electron injection into the blue-QD, especially at low voltages. Insertion of an ultrathin polymer dielectric layer could improve charge balance,33,47 but at the expense of increased tunnel resistance which may be mitigated using molecularly graded junctions demonstrated some time ago for polymer OLEDs.48,49\nDouble injection heterostructures: normal QLEDs\nWe next substitute the ZnMgO layer with N3/PFOP as the electron injection stack to give ITO/pTFF/mTFF/QD/PFOP/N3/ Al QLEDs. The N3 layer is the EIL known to be capable of Ohmic electron injection into PFOP.30 The JVL and Z\u2013J characteristics of this QLED are shown in Fig. 6a. Despite having polymer transport layers sandwiching the QD film, electron\u2013 hole recombination occurs exclusively in the QD, as evidenced by pure QD electroluminescence (EL; Fig. 2e). Emission from the adjacent mTFF and PFOP layers (0 - 0 at 430 nm) has not been observed. This confirms the successful fabrication of a double type-I injection heterostructure.\nWith a Vbi of 3.15 V, from feff,1 = 5.7 eV and feff,2 = 2.55 eV, the ideal JV matches the experimental one fairly well. This confirms that introduction of PFOP ETL increases the electrical resistance as expected. However, Z\u2013J now exhibits a broad plateau with the 90%-width spanning four decades of current\ndensity from the diode turn-on of 10 mA cm 2, at 2% initially, improving to 6.5% over a few days. The initial Z depression is not fully understood, but reproducible and appears related to an initial electron damage of the QDs, followed by subsequent healing (vide infra).\nThe successful flattening of Z\u2013J at the maximum Z from the onset of diode turn-on confirms that balanced electron\u2013hole injection can be enforced using the double-type-I device heterostructure. At the same time, the polymer transport layers \u2018protect\u2019 the QD sufficiently to improve the rest stability of the QLEDs. Z\u2013J does not decay with storage time, unlike for standard QLEDs. These results are reproducible. In another set of devices fabricated months later, the same Z\u2013J plateau is observed, stabilizing at 7.5\u20138% (Fig. S4a, ESI\u2020). Furthermore, the strong electron injection stack, through the feedback effect, provides some latitude to employ a weaker hole injection stack, and conversely. This is illustrated by ITO/PEDT/TFB/QD/PFOP/ N3/Al QLEDs, where the Al/N3/PFOP stack is able to coerce similar JV and Z\u2013J characteristics from PEDT/TFB as the pTFF/ mTFF hole injection stack, though with the expected Vbi loss and the attendant low-V leakage (Fig. S4b, ESI\u2020).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

This indicates that hole leakage into PFOP is still possible, consistent with the energy-level diagram that the hole transport level of PFOP is rather close to the valence level of the blue-QDs, about 0.1 eV. If the offset can be increased to 0.3 eV, complete blocking can be achieved.\nDouble injection heterostructures: inverted QLEDs\nWe also demonstrate inverted QLEDs where electrons are injected from a bottom ITO cathode, and holes from a top metal anode. A N5(Ox) layer was spin-cast on ITO\u2013glass, followed by PFOP and blue-QD layers. An mTFF film was then picked up from water, a hole-doped pTFF-C2F5SIS layer was spin-cast, and Pd and Ag layers then evaporated sequentially. N5 has the same polyfluorene semiconductor core and work function as N3, but a higher ion density for improved adhesion to ITO.24,50 The JVL and Z\u2013J characteristics are shown in Fig. 6c. The JV in the return half-cycle is close to the ideal curve, indicating the absence of electron and hole barriers. However, the positive hysteresis indicates that electron injection at ITO/ N5 may still be limiting in the forward half-cycle. This may not be surprising because of the large mismatch in work functions between ITO (4.5 eV) and N5 (2.55 eV), which would result in a large Schottky barrier that may be suppressed with further increase in doping. Nevertheless, the successful demonstration of inverted QLEDs points to the utility of the double-type-I heterostructure to coax carrier injection, even from nontraditional electrodes."

A 10 nm-thick film of F8BT is used as the ETL by float-off and pick-up. F8BT has a VB edge at 5.9 eV, and CB edge estimated at 2.9 eV, with a transport gap similar or wider than that of the QD, but an emission gap much narrower due to excimer relaxation (lpeak, 540 nm; 2.3 eV). 49 Hence, F8BT would not be able to inject electrons into the QD were its conduction level much higher than 2.9 eV. Then EL would only occur from F8BT since energy back transfer to the wider gap QD is not possible. Experimentally, EL occurs from both QD and F8BT layers, producing a \u2018white\u2019 spectrum. This confirms that the conduction level of the QD core is in the neighborhood of 2.9 eV. However, hole confinement is less effective here due to inefficient electron injection by ZnMgO into F8BT. Altogether, the device results support the energylevel diagram, and that elimination of ZnMgO is key to good storage stability."

            "text": "In order to make an assessment of whether the best Z reached here is consistent with perfect electron\u2013hole recombination, we need to evaluate the effect of the photonic structure of the QLED on its emission rate and distribution. This is a well\nknown topic in organic light-emitting diodes, where the emission rate and its distribution into air, trapped substrate and waveguide modes are governed by wave interference of the emitting dipole together with surface plasmon-polariton quenching by the metal electrode and other conductive layers.51,52 Thus, we employed the same theoretical framework based on the emitting-dipole formalism of Chance, Prock and Silbey to estimate radiative rates from the EML in the QLEDs.53\nThere are two key parameters in this model, kr,o and knr,i, which are the hypothetical radiative decay rate under vacuum, and the intrinsic non-radiative decay rate in the film, respectively. These were evaluated and fixed by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements (see Methods). The photonic structure relevant to the double-type-I QLED is given in Fig. 7a; the optical properties of the layers are given in ESI,\u2020 Table S1. Then we computed kr and knr under the influence of the electrodes and other layers. These are given in Table 2 for the three key QLED structures\u2014double-type-I normal QLED (A-1), double-type-I inverted QLED (B-1), and standard QLED (C-1).

As a result, the radiative efficiency is marginally higher (8% relative) for the QD monolayer that is nearer to the metal electrode (Fig. 7d). These plots illustrate the sensitivity of Z to the structure of the QLED and the location of the recombination zone.\nThe results indicate for the blue-QDs used, the internal and external QEs are limited to 30% and 10%, respectively, for both A-1 and C-1 structures, but 30% and 13%, respectively, for the B-1 structure, provided that non-emissive states are absent. The photon outcoupling factor turns out to vary narrowly over 35\u201340%. However, since a dark state is known to occur with ageing of the QD film which reduces Zpl by about 20\u201325%, the theoretical maximum Z is reduced correspondingly to 7.5\u20138%. Consequently, the experimental yield of 7\u20138% indicates that those QLEDs indeed exhibit near perfect electron\u2013hole recombination efficiency. If these dark states can be completely eliminated, however, and knr,i reduced to 0.008 ns\n1, the maximum attainable Z would be 18%."

            "text": "Numerous challenges have to be addressed in QLEDs. The application of the double-type-I heterostructure resolves the problem of balancing electron\u2013hole injection and enforcing perfect recombination inside the QD EML. The use of polymer organic semiconductor transport layers resolves the problem of chemical incompatibility with ZnMgO. But several other issues still remain. Despite improved electron\u2013hole balance, the operational lifetimes of these QLEDs in fact decrease. Here, we briefly outline some issues clarified or exposed by the new injection heterostructures.\nFirst, we show by luminescence spectroscopies that the ZnMgO layer chemically degrades both the QD and HTL over time, which can be avoided by polymer transport layers. PL quenching can already be observed in t and Zpl measurements\nafter film deposition, as noted earlier. With further stress bias or ageing, the standard QLEDs, but not the double-type-I QLEDs with polymer transport layers, exhibit a red-shift and broadening of their EL spectrum (Fig. 8a). The EL spectra of the latter remain pure with electrical driving in both normal and inverted architectures. Moreover, the standard QLEDs show that their PL spectra are strongly degraded beyond recognition after a few months, regardless of the polymer HTL (Fig. 8b). The HTL emission is completely changed, while the QD emission is greatly attenuated. In contrast, the double-type-I QLEDs show unchanged PL spectra. Regardless of whether the diode is fresh, aged (for five months), or driven to half-initialluminance by constant current drive, the PL emission from the transport layers in: pTFF/mTFF/QD/PFOP/N3/Al, PEDT/TFB/ QD/PFOP/N3/Al, and pTFF/mTFF/QD/PFOP/LiF/Ca/Al devices remains practically unchanged, although that from the QD layer does decrease significantly (Fig. 8c). Thus, ZnMgO is not chemically compatible with the QDs nor the polymer HTL, and the QDs show greater vulnerability than the transport polymers to electrical injection.\nNext, we show by in situ Raman spectroscopy that this vulnerability is associated with chemical changes in the QD layer. Recent work has already indicated that CdZnSeS/ZnS core/shell QDs are damaged by electron injection.3 After driving to half-initial-luminance, the pTFF/mTFF/QD/PFOP/N3/Al QLED exhibits subtle changes in the 200\u2013500 cm 1 region that indicate structural changes and formation of new inorganic chemical species (Fig. 8d). These sensitive measurements were made by comparing a driven diode with an adjacent undriven one. The following tentative assignments may be made: loss at 278 and 345cm 1, loss of ZnS; gain at 216 and 460 cm 1, formation of sulfur clusters;54 gain at 263 cm 1, selenium clusters.55 The gain at 356, 395 and 428 cm 1 may be attributed to ZnO clusters on account of its rich spectrum of modes.56 These molecular changes imply that under electron-rich conditions, the QD layer may undergo electrochemical reduction at its shell to release Zn, which then oxidizes to ZnO by scavenging\nTable 2 Theoretical radiative quantum efficiencies in the QD emitter layer in various QLED structures\nSN Device structurea\nRadiative and non-radiative decay ratesb Random dipolesc Random degenerate dipolesd\nkr1,x (ns 1) kr2,x (ns 1) knr,x (ns 1) kr1,z (ns 1) kr2,z (ns 1) knr,z (ns 1) EQEe IQE f EQEe IQE f"

This is also consistent with the initially observed depression of Z. The mechanism is reminiscent of the in device electrochemistry that occurs in doped conducting polymers under strong injection.57\u201359 Thus, future work would be required to attain better stabilization or passivation of the QDs to take full advantage of the new injection heterostructures.\nFinally, we show that the polymer transport layers themselves also show a slow relaxation. To extract the layer contribution to ageing manifested by the slow decline in JV, we examined the variation of the QLED resistance with mTFF and PFOP layer thicknesses (dmTFF and dPFOP). The resistance initially varies little with dPFOP but more with dmTFF (Fig. 8e). After 50 days, the resistance increases considerably, and varies strongly with both dPFOP and dmTFF (Fig. 8f). This suggests that the space-charge voltage through both transport layers eventually becomes significant, pointing to a possible relaxation in the layers."

Further optimization of energy levels and thicknesses should make it possible to\nfurther shift the JVL characteristic down-voltage by another few tenths of a volt. This overcomes a longstanding challenge, and at the same time, eliminates the destructive ZnMgO layer. As a consequence, we found that the QDs ironically become more unstable during operation, which appears to be a consequence of operando electrochemistry at the QD in the QLEDs. This work suggests the design of new polymer semiconductors as transport layers with more optimal energy levels and requisite processability from orthogonal solvents would be productive. This would enable simpler manufacturing by sequential film deposition. Suitable target solvents include those in the intermediate to strong polarity range, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-1-pentanol, tetrahydrofuran, diglyme and dimethyl carbonate (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020). The QD films do not dissolve in these solvents, nor is their photoluminescence efficiency degraded. In the course of our work, we have also investigated small molecule organic semiconductors as ETLs, such as TSPO1 (Fig. S7, ESI\u2020).

Alternatively, PFOP films were deposited by the float-off and pick-up method in the ambient, as described above, then N3(Ox,AcO) films were spin-cast (1.8 mg mL 1 in a mixed solvent of 3 : 1 v/v 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE):2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5octafluoro-1-pentanol (OFP)) in the glovebox. For inverted QLEDs: N5(TfO) films were spin-cast (2 mg mL 1 in the mixed solvent 3 : 1 v/v TFE : OFP) onto an oxygen-plasma-cleaned ITO\u2013 glass substrate, and then ion-exchanged with oxalate by contacting with a sodium oxalate solution (80 mM in 4 : 1 v/v H2O : methanol) in the ambient for 30 s before spin-off (6000 revolutions per minute (rpm)) and spin-rinse (H2O for 30 s, then spin-off 6,000 rpm) to give N5(Ox) as the precursor EIL. PFOP films were then spin-cast (7 mg mL 1 in toluene) in the glovebox, and annealed at 110 1C for 5 min. Blue-QD films were then deposited as before. mTFF films were then deposited by the float-off and pick-up method in the ambient, as described above, and annealed at 100 1C for 1 min in a glovebox. Self-compensated hole-doped pTFF-C2F5SISNa films were then spin-cast (6 mM in ACN). All films were annealed at 100 1C on the digital hotplate in the glovebox for 1 min before metal deposition. Metal films (Al, Pd or Ag as appropriate) were deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask at a base pressure of 10 6 Torr to give eight 4.3 mm2 pixels on each device substrate."

Timeresolved photoluminescence decay curves were collected using a spectrofluorometer (Horiba Fluorolog-3) at an excitation wavelength of 374 nm with a pulse width of 240 ps (LED), and emission wavelength of 465 nm. Raman spectra were collected using a Raman microscope (Renishaw) through a 20 objective at 514 nm excitation with 1 mW at focus using a stepper motor to collect data averaged over an array of image points."

            "text": "De-excitation rates were computed in the Chance, Prock and Silbey emitting-dipole formalism.53 First, kr,o was evaluated to reproduce the experimental tr of the blue-QD in octane (10.7 ns). Then knr,i was evaluated to reproduce both t1 and Zpl of the 20 nm-thick blue-QD film on the fused silica substrate (4.3 ns and 42%, respectively). Results are given in footnote b of Table 2. Self-consistency was achieved. This validated the essential assumptions of the model that the radiative lifetime in the film is modified from that in solution through the photonic structure effect, while the excess PL quenching in the film can be treated as an additional competing decay channel. Then we computed the effects of the electrodes and other layers on kr and knr self-consistently, and the distribution of kr into its various propagating photon modes. The results are given in Table 2 separately for in-plane and out-of-plane emitting dipoles, and broken down into air modes and substrate modes. We performed the computations for the two cases of randomly oriented emitting dipoles: non-degenerate and doubly-degenerate. The emitting dipoles of ideal CdSe QDs are doubly degenerate, but the results here show that this does not really matter\u2014the photonic structure effects are practically identical."
