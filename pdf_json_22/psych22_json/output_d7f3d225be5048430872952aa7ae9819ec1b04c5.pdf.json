Humans and animals rely on the stress system in the brain to react and adapt to various stressful events and make responses. Appropriate responses to stress are essential for survival when facing life-threatening conditions (Godoy et al., 2018). However, if particular stress causes an overwhelming burden that a subject could bear, it results in maladaptive changes to the stress system in the brain, which then leads to or triggers the occurrence of many psychiatric disorders, such as depression, also known as major depressive disorder (de Kloet et al., 2005; Wohleb et al., 2016; Godoy et al., 2018). According to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), about 6.7% of the adults in the United States age 18 and older suffer from depression. Despite the high prevalence, the treatment for depression remains limited.\nThe treatment strategy for depression includes pharmacological intervention, psychotherapy, and a combination of these two. Pharmacological intervention, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is usually required for patients with moderate and severe symptoms (Davidson, 2010). Generally, pharmacological intervention is more acceptable and widely used, especially in countries and regions where psychotherapy is unavailable. However, current antidepressants have many limitations. Most currently available antidepressants require weeks of treatment before providing clinical benefits (Insel and Wang, 2009). Furthermore, depressive symptoms usually\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 907767\nlast for a long-term, even life-long for many patients, for whom daily treatment is generally required. In the past decades, emerging studies have investigated new systems and molecular targets that do not belong to the traditionally focused monoamine systems, such as serotoninergic and norepinephrinergic systems, in the hope of developing novel antidepressants (Lener et al., 2017; Shinohara et al., 2021). Recent evidence shows that PKM\u03b6, an atypical PKC isoform that plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of LTP, may participate in the development of depression and might be one of the critical targets that mediate actions of antidepressants, suggesting that PKM\u03b6 might be a potential target for the treatment of depression. Here, I review the advance on the role of PKM\u03b6 in regulating brain function and its involvement in the pathology of depression."

            "text": "PKM\u03b6 is an isoform of the protein kinase C (PKC), which is an enzyme that has the ability to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues (Osten et al., 1996). There are various isoforms of PKC, including conventional isoforms (\u03b1, \u03b2I, \u03b2II, and \u03b3), novel isoforms (\u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b7, and \u03b8), and atypical isoforms (\u03b6 and \u03b9). PKM\u03b6 is the constitutively activated form of PKC\u03b6, which only has the \u03b6 catalytic domain but not a regulatory domain (Hernandez et al., 2003). PKM\u03b6 was widely expressed in many brain regions, including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), thalamus, striatum, and so forth (Naik et al., 2000). A pioneering study by Sacktor et al. (1993) found that PKM\u03b6 was increased in the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP), which first linked PKM\u03b6 to the LTP. It was further shown that protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and cycloheximide reversed the maintenance of hippocampal LTP and prevented the increase in PKM\u03b6 (Osten et al., 1996), which suggested that PKM\u03b6 could be newly synthesized during LTP (Figure 1). The following study indicated that the de novo synthesis of PKM\u03b6 during LTP required many protein kinases, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase A (PKA), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and preexisting PKM\u03b6 (Kelly et al., 2007). To determine the causal role of PKM\u03b6 in the maintenance of LTP, the Sacktor group synthesized the selective \u03b6-pseudosubstrate inhibitory peptide (ZIP) and showed that ZIP selectively prevented the maintenance of LTP without affecting baseline EPSP in vitro (Ling et al., 2002; Serrano et al., 2005). Thus, these data strongly suggest that PKM\u03b6 is essential for the maintenance of LTP.\nSince the publication of the landmark report on hippocampal LTP by Bliss and Lomo in 1973, extensive studies have investigated this particular form of synaptic plasticity (Bliss and Lomo, 1973; Nicoll, 2017). Although many molecules had been reported to participate in LTP induction, such as CaMKII and PKA, as mentioned above, little was known about the mechanism underlying the maintenance of LTP (Lisman et al., 2012; Herring and Nicoll, 2016). Thus, when the selective involvement of\nFIGURE 1 | PKM\u03b6 maintains long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation (LTP), once triggered, could last for hours or even weeks. Many protein kinases such as CaMKII, mTOR, PKA, MAPK, and preexisting PKM\u03b6 are required for the early LTP. Reactivation of these protein kinases then induced translation of PKM\u03b6 from the mRNA. The newly synthesized PKM\u03b6 then maintains the membrane expression of GluR2, which is essential for the maintenance of LTP.

In the last two decades, a large number of studies have reported the critical role of PKM\u03b6 in the storage of memory. For example, it was shown that the PKM\u03b6 inhibitor ZIP disrupted the maintenance of hippocampal LTP in vivo as well as abolished long-term memory in an active place avoidance task in rats (Pastalkova et al., 2006). Following studies indicated that the disruptive effects of ZIP on memory seem to be consistent across many memory tasks, including spatial memory, recognition memory, aversive and appetitive memories, which suggested that PKM\u03b6 could be a common mechanism underlying the storage of long-term memories (Pastalkova et al., 2006; Serrano et al., 2008; Migues et al., 2010).\nNotably, PKM\u03b6 was demonstrated to maintain stress-related memory. This is primarily supported by numerous studies shown that PKM\u03b6 is essential for the maintenance of fear memory induced by footshock stress (Serrano et al., 2008; Kwapis et al., 2009, 2012; Migues et al., 2010; Parsons and Davis, 2011; Xue et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2016; Schuette et al., 2016; Marcondes et al., 2021). It was shown that microinjection of the PKM\u03b6 inhibitory peptide ZIP into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) reduced the retention of cued fear memory (Serrano et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2019), indicating that PKM\u03b6 in the BLA was a key molecule for maintaining fear memory. Consistent with this, intra-BLA injection of ZIP also disrupted the footshock-derived inhibitory avoidance memory (Serrano et al., 2008). Another study showed that the virus-mediated expression of PKM\u03b6 in the prelimbic cortex of PFC enhanced fear memory, suggesting that PKM\u03b6 in the PFC is also involved in fear memory (Xue et al., 2015). Furthermore, not only a newly formed memory but PKM\u03b6 has also been demonstrated to regulate remote fear memory (Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010). Since fear memory has\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 907767\nbeen widely taken as an animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Bienvenu et al., 2021), approaches that affect the expression of PKM\u03b6 might be promising strategies to treat traumatic stress-related diseases. Nevertheless, the role of PKM\u03b6 in maintaining memory has been critically questioned in the last decade. In 2012, two independent groups reported no memory loss or LTP disruption in PKM\u03b6 knockout animals, which provided direct evidence that PKM\u03b6 might not be essential for memory or LTP (Lee et al., 2013; Volk et al., 2013). In addition, some studies showed that ZIP, which was widely used as the selective PKM\u03b6 inhibitory peptide, was not specific at all (see discussion below). Up to this point, the role of PKM\u03b6 in stress-related memory remains in debate, which needs further investigation to be fully understood."

Stress could cause impairment or enhancement of LTP, which depends on various paradigms of the experienced stress, including controllability, severity, and duration (Kim et al., 2006; Abush and Akirav, 2013; Peters et al., 2018). Generally, long-lasting and uncontrollable stress is thought to impair LTP (Kim et al., 2006). Given the importance of PKM\u03b6 in LTP maintenance, it could be inferred that PKM\u03b6 might be involved in stress response. Consistently, several studies have shown that stress could affect PKM\u03b6 expression in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), two critical brain areas that mediates stress response and depression, and PKM\u03b6 in these brain regions might meditate stress-related behaviors in some conditions. However, the related reports are controversial, and the particular role of PKM\u03b6 in mediating stress response and related disorders remain in debate."

            "text": "The findings on the effects of stress on PKM\u03b6 expression in the hippocampus are mixed through the literature. One study found that in the isolated rat embryonic hippocampal neural stem cells, dexamethasone, a pharmacological treatment mimicking stressinduced glucocorticoid secretion, decreased the expression of PKM\u03b6 mRNA, and protein. This regulation was specific since dexamethasone did not affect the expression of PKC\u03b9, the other atypical PKC isoform expressed in isolated hippocampal neural stem cells (Wang et al., 2014). A recent study showed that nonhuman primates who experienced stress in early life showed a lifelong reduction of PKM\u03b6 in the ventral hippocampus (Fulton et al., 2021). In contrast, chronic stress enhanced the cytosolic but not synaptic expression of PKM\u03b6 in the hippocampus (Zanca et al., 2015). Consistent with these, our recent study showed that CUS caused a reduction of PKM\u03b6 in the hippocampus (Yan et al., 2018). However, the inhibitory effect of stress on PKM\u03b6\nexpression was inconsistent in the literature. For example, it was shown that acute stress increased the synaptic but not cytosolic expression of PKM\u03b6 in the hippocampus (Zanca et al., 2015). Single-prolonged stress (SPS), a behavioral paradigm mimicking the development of PTSD, also increased PKM\u03b6 expression in the hippocampus of rats 7 and 14 days after experiencing the stress treatment (Ji et al., 2014). Ji et al. (2014) further showed that intra-hippocampus microinjection of ZIP reduced SPSinduced depressive-like behavior in the forced swimming task and anxiety-like behavior in the open field tests and elevated plus-maze. In contrast, another study showed that the synaptic PKM\u03b6 level in the hippocampus was not altered in rats after social defeat stress, a behavioral model of depression based on social motivation (Iniguez et al., 2016). Since different types of stress were used in these studies, the discrepancy among these studies might suggest that stress type could be an essential factor determine the effects of stress on hippocampal PKM\u03b6 expression. Furthermore, it should be noted that some studies examined the cytosolic expression of PKM\u03b6, whereas others examined the synaptic PKM\u03b6, which might be another factor that caused the discrepancy (Iniguez et al., 2016). Therefore, these studies suggest that stress could affect hippocampal PKM\u03b6 expression, however, the effects could be influenced by many factors, such as stress paradigm and subcellular expression (cytosolic vs. synaptic)."

            "text": "So far, there is only one study investigated the role of PKM\u03b6 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mediating depressive-like behaviors (Yan et al., 2018). The study showed that PKM\u03b6 in the mPFC was decreased in two behavioral models of depression, i.e., chronic mild unpredictable stress (CUS) and learned helplessness (Figure 2; Yan et al., 2018). CUS did not change PKM\u03b6 expression in the orbitofrontal cortex, an adjacent brain region to the PFC, indicating that the PFC was the particular brain site where CUS affected PKM\u03b6 expression. Notably, SUS did not alter the expression of other PKC isoforms, including PKC\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b8, or \u03bb in the PFC, suggesting that PKM\u03b6 is a unique PKC isoform influenced by CUS (Yan et al., 2018).\nThe causal role of PKM\u03b6 in the mPFC in depression has been implicated by studies using selective PKM\u03b6 inhibitory peptide ZIP and viruses that overexpress PKM\u03b6 or express dominant-negative mutant PKM\u03b6 (Yan et al., 2018). Intra-mPFC microinjection of ZIP enhanced stress-induced depressive-like behavior in both chronic stress and learned helplessness models (Yan et al., 2018). Because of the non-specific inhibition of ZIP on PKM\u03b6 (see details discussed below), it is hard to conclude whether PKM\u03b6 in the mPFC regulated depressivelike behaviors only based on the effects of ZIP. To confirm the role of PKM\u03b6, Yan et al. (2018) further showed that virusmediated expression of PKM\u03b6 in the mPFC reversed CUS- and learned helplessness-induced depressive-like behaviors as well as CUS-induced reduction in spine density and mEPCS frequency.

            "text": "Some evidence has shown the involvement of PKM\u03b6 in the actions of antidepressants. The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine could increase PKM\u03b6 expression and prevent dexamethasone-induced downregulation of PKM\u03b6 in isolated hippocampal neural stem cells (Wang et al., 2014). Importantly, PKM\u03b6 mediated fluoxetine-induced neurogenesis and signaling activation (Wang et al., 2014). These in vitro findings are consistent with our recent in vivo study, in which we showed that both fluoxetine and desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, reversed CUS-induced reduction in PKM\u03b6 expression in the mPFC. As mentioned before, antidepressants, including fluoxetine and desipramine, require several weeks of treatment to exert their antidepressant actions. Recent studies have indicated that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown to exert fast-acting and long-lasting antidepressant action. It has been demonstrated that ketamine could rescue chronic stress-induced molecular changes, morphological alterations of neurons, and microcircuit dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Li et al., 2010, 2011; Moda-Sava et al., 2019). Intriguingly, ketamine could prevent the CUS-induced downregulation of PKM\u03b6 in the PFC; PKM\u03b6 was necessary for the antidepressant\naction of ketamine in the learned helplessness model. These findings insofar demonstrated that PKM\u03b6 is a critical and common target that mediates the actions of slow-acting and fast-acting antidepressants."

            "text": "Generally, anxiety is characterized by a persistent feeling of apprehension or dread, a specific reaction to stress. A great variety of behavioral models has been developed to mimic anxiety disorders (Kumar et al., 2013). It is not uncommon that patients with depression may also suffer from anxiety disorders (Kaiser et al., 2021). Besides fear conditioning as described above, PKM\u03b6 is also involved in other anxiety-like behaviors. Microinjection of ZIP into the hippocampus alleviated the anxiety-like behavior in rats after single prolonged stress (SPS), a paradigm used to trigger PTSD-like symptoms in animals (Ji et al., 2014). In another animal model of PSTD, it was shown that PKM\u03b6 in different brain regions exerts a time-dependent role in storing traumatic memory and mediating anxiety-like behaviors in rats exposed to predator scent stress. The study showed that injection of ZIP into the dorsal hippocampus 1 h after predator scent stress exposure disrupted anxiety-like behavior and trauma cue response 8 days later, whereas intra-insular cortex injection of ZIP 10 days after predator scent exposure showed a similar effect (Cohen et al., 2010). This suggested that PKM\u03b6 in dorsal hippocampus and insular cortex might regulate different stages of anxiety disorders. In a valproic acid model of autism, mice with valproic acid injection showed a higher level of PKM\u03b6 in the BLA. Injection of ZIP into the BLA decreased anxiety-like behavior in the VPA-injected mice (Gao et al., 2019). In another study, microinjection of ZIP into the anterior cingulate cortex reversed pain-induced anxiety-like behavior (Du et al., 2017). These studies suggested that PKM\u03b6 in many brain regions could be a common molecule that maintains different traumatic memories and mediates anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, the anxiolytic effects of ZIP are not dependent on the types of stress used to trigger anxiety-like behavior.\nConsistent with the role of PKM\u03b6 in mediating stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors, PKM\u03b6 has been demonstrated to regulate the basal level of anxiety. Genetically modified mice that lack both PKC\u03b6 and PKM\u03b6 showed reduced anxiety behavior (Lee et al., 2013). In contrast, virus-mediated overexpression of PKM\u03b6 in the BLA of wild-type mice increased anxiety-like behavior (Gao et al., 2019). However, although virus-mediated overexpression of PKM\u03b6 in the prelimbic cortex enhanced fear memory, this intervention showed no effect on basal anxiety-like behavior evaluated by open field test and elevated plus-maze task (Xue et al., 2015). These studies might suggest that BLA but not the prelimbic cortex might be crucial for basal anxiety behavior."

In hippocampal\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 907767\nslices, perfusion of PKM\u03b6 resulted in a robust potentiation of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), which could be blocked by non-NMDA glutamate receptors antagonist CNQX (Ling et al., 2002), suggesting that PKM\u03b6 was sufficient for AMPAR but not NMDAR currents. Further studies have proposed particular processes of LTP initiation and maintenance (Sacktor, 2011): (1) in the initiation of LTP, NMDA receptors are activated, which then result in the reactivation of multiple protein kinases that are essential for the removal of the translational block of PKM\u03b6 synthesis; (2) the de novo synthesized PKM\u03b6 is then converted into a conformation with constitutive activity after phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1); (3) the constitutively activated PKM\u03b6 increases N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)/the glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2)-dependent trafficking of AMPAR and maintains the AMPAR expression at postsynaptic sites to potentiate synaptic transmission.\nPKM\u03b6 was shown to be able to phosphorylate and inhibit PIN1 (protein interacting with NIMA1), a prolyl isomerase, which has the capacity for suppressing the translation of PKM\u03b6 from mRNA (Westmark et al., 2010). This self-perpetuating mechanism of PKM\u03b6 translation in synapses thus explained the maintained high levels of PKM\u03b6 and its activity, which is required for maintaining synaptic plasticity. As a critical subunit of AMPARs, GluR2 is crucial for AMPAR assembly and trafficking and determines the property of Ca2+ permeability and function of AMPAR (Isaac et al., 2007). It is of interest that the Ca2+ permeable AMPAR, which has been revealed to play an important role in short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, contains unedited GluR2 or lacks GluR2 (Isaac et al., 2007). As described above, PKM\u03b6 regulates synaptic plasticity and LTP via maintaining the membrane GluR2 expression, presumably increasing the membrane expression of GluR2-containing AMPAR (Sacktor, 2011). A hypothesis could be that the GluR2 subunit composition of AMPAR switches between the initiation and maintenance of the LTP, and PKM\u03b6 might be essential for this switching (Liu and Cull-Candy, 2000); however, this requires further investigation to be determined.\nRegulation of GluR2 trafficking through the interaction between PKM\u03b6 and NSF/GluR2 might also be the mechanism underlying the role of PKM\u03b6 in the PFC in depression. (Yan et al. (2018) showed that CUS and learned helplessness stress reduced PKM\u03b6 level and synaptic expression of GluR2 in the mPFC, which could be reversed by the virus-mediated expression of PKM\u03b6. Inconsistent, virus-mediated expression of the dominant-negative PKM\u03b6 facilitated a subthreshold chronic stress-induced decrease in GluR2 in the mPFC (Ling et al., 2002). These studies may suggest that, even though different stress affects the expression of PKM\u03b6 differently in distinct brain regions, PKM\u03b6 and GluR2 levels were parallel after particular stress in a certain brain region. However, the causal role of GluR2 in mediating the function of PKM\u03b6 in stress conditions remains unclear. Elucidation of this issue may uncover the mechanism of PKM\u03b6 in response to stress and stress-related disorders."

            "text": "As described above, most work that supports the fundamental role of PKM\u03b6 in maintaining LTP and related behaviors used ZIP as a selective inhibitor of PKM\u03b6. However, other studies have suggested that ZIP might not be an appropriate inhibitor of PKM\u03b6.\nSome evidence shows that ZIP may not be able to inhibit PKM\u03b6. In cultured 293T cells expressing PKM\u03b6, ZIP could not reverse PKM\u03b6 overexpression-induced increase in the phosphorylation of multiple PKC substrates. In COS-7 cells co-transfected with CKAR and PKM-RFP, ZIP did not affect the baseline normalized FRET ratio. Furthermore, ZIP did not affect MAPK2 activity in brain slices transfected with PKM\u03b6. The authors then concluded that ZIP could not inhibit PKM\u03b6 (Wu-Zhang et al., 2012). However, the protocol used in the study could lead to a 30-fold increase in PKM\u03b6 expression, which was beyond the inhibitory ability of ZIP. Yao et al. (2013) demonstrated that ZIP was a competitive inhibitor of PKM\u03b6 and could be ineffective in inhibiting an excessively high level of PKM\u03b6. In addition, ZIP inhibited PKM\u03b6-induced enhancement of AMPAR potentiation but not baseline AMPAR-mediated EPSC mediated by other cellular molecules, suggesting that ZIP could selectively suppress the function of PKM\u03b6 (Yao et al., 2013).\nOther studies suggested that ZIP was not selective on PKM\u03b6. ZIP at a concentration (10 \u00b5M) could inhibit the activity of both PKCa and PKM\u03b6 (Bogard and Tavalin, 2015). ZIP also disrupted the ability of PKC to bind to AKAP79. Since AKAP79 interacts with PKCa via a pseudosubstrate-like mechanism, suggesting ZIP might exert its effects through the displacement of PKCa from targeted sites (Bogard and Tavalin, 2015). In a recent study, both ZIP and its control peptide scr-ZIP caused GluR1 redistribution in HEK293 cells expressing GluR1 (Bingor et al., 2020). It is of interest that HEK293 cells did not express PKM\u03b6. The same study further showed that the effects of ZIP on AMPAR function were mediated by NOS signaling, which suggested that NOS signaling rather than PKM\u03b6 was the key target of ZIP (Bingor et al., 2020). In a physiological situation, ZIP and scr-ZIP could decrease AMPAR EPSCs in the NAc brain slices. Consistent with this, both ZIP and scr-ZIP disrupted cocaine-induced CPP, a reward memory task that requires the function of the NAc (Bingor et al., 2020).\nEvidence also suggested that the effects of ZIP could be attributed to ZIP-induced cellular toxicity. One study showed that both ZIP and scr-ZIP dose-dependently caused rapid cell death of cultured hippocampal neurons (Sadeh et al., 2015). These effects might be due to ZIP and scr-ZIP-induced spontaneous activity and sustained increase in Ca2+ activity after application of ZIP and scr-ZIP in cultured hippocampal cells (Sadeh et al., 2015). The fact that ZIP could lead to detrimental hyperactivity in cultured hippocampal neurons suggested that ZIP was excitotoxic to neurons (Sadeh et al., 2015). In contrast, one study indicated that ZIP could lead to neural silence in\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 907767\nthe hippocampus in vivo (LeBlancq et al., 2016). LeBlancq et al. (2016) recorded local field potential from the CA1 subarea of the hippocampus with the infusion of ZIP directly into the recording area. Astonishingly, they found that ZIP caused a profound inhibition of LFP comparable to the magnitude of that induced by lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker. The duration of LFP inhibition maintained by ZIP was even longer than lidocaine. Although these two studies reported contradictory findings that ZIP excited or inhibited neural activity, it is possible that ZIP-induced inhibition of LFP might be a consequence of ZIP-induced excitotoxicity (Patel and Zamani, 2021).\nGiven these critical concerns on ZIP, i.e., the ineffectiveness in some conditions, non-specificity, and neurotoxicity, it should be cautious when interpreting the results used ZIP. In particular, ZIP should not be taken as a specific inhibitor of PKM\u03b6. Other approaches rather than ZIP should be employed to determine the causal role of PKM\u03b6 in regulating brain functions and related behaviors. These approaches may include virus-mediated downregulation or expression of PKM\u03b6 in particular brain regions or subtype of cells. For example, previous studies have used viruses to overexpress PKM\u03b6 or the negative-dominant mutant PKM\u03b6 that could competitively inhibit PKM\u03b6 activity in particular brain regions could modulate animal behaviors (Shema et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018)."

            "text": "Depression is a brain disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood and loss of interest. Patients usually need to take antidepressants to benefit from the treatment continually. Furthermore, some patients may stop benefiting from particular antidepressants after long-term treatment (Anderson, 2013). At least to some extent, these phenomena suggest that currently available antidepressants only transiently suppress the symptoms of depression but do not directly affect the maintenance of depression. Theoretically, a medicine that directly influences the maintenance of depression may permanently reverse the related maladaptive changes and cure depression. Since PKM\u03b6 has been implicated in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and memory (Sacktor, 2011), it is presumed that stress-induced reduction in PKM\u03b6 in the PFC may result in a persistent dysfunction of this brain region. This could be a mechanism underlying the persistence of depressive-like symptoms. However, several questions should be addressed before concluding the role of PKM\u03b6 in the persistence of depressive-like behaviors. For example, it remains unknown how long the stress-induced reduction in PKM\u03b6 could last. Another interesting question would be whether PKM\u03b6 is a molecule that mediates the sustained effects of antidepressants.\nSince PKM\u03b6 has been long taken as a memory molecule, it is of great curiosity to examine whether PKM\u03b6 could be a link between depression and memory problems. Patients with depression usually suffer short-term memory loss and are at risk of long-term memory loss (Dillon and Pizzagalli, 2018). As PKM\u03b6 in the mPFC is crucial for depressive-like behavior and memory\nmaintenance. It could be presumed that depressive-like behaviorassociated reduction in PKM\u03b6 expression in the PFC might underlie the memory problems found in patients with depression. Addressing this issue may shed light on the understanding of the relationship between stress-induced cognition dysfunction and the development of depression.\nFurthermore, depression is a complicated disease that involves many brain regions (Nestler, 2015; Hare and Duman, 2020). As mentioned above, stress increased PKM\u03b6 expression in the hippocampus but decreased it in the mPFC, indicating that PKM\u03b6 in the hippocampus and mPFC may be involved in stress response and depression distinctively. Future studies are needed to address the role of PKM\u03b6 in different brain regions in regulating depression and the actions of antidepressants."

Yan et al. (2018) showed that even though antidepressants prevented CUS- or learned helplessness-induced reduction in PKM\u03b6 expression in the PFC, they did not influence PKM\u03b6 expression in non-stressed animals. Virus-mediated expression of dominant-negative mutant PKM\u03b6 in the PFC did not induce depressive-like behaviors. These results may suggest that basal PKM\u03b6 activity in the PFC could not be critical for depressive-like behaviors. However, it would be interesting to examine whether the virus-medicated expression of PKM\u03b6 or its dominantnegative mutant would influence the resilience or susceptibility in responding to stress."
