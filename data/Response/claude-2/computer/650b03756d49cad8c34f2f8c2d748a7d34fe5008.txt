 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on using deep learning and hyperspectral imaging to detect apple scab disease:

1. Train deep learning models directly on raw hyperspectral data instead of creating false color images. This avoids any loss of information and may allow the model to learn more discriminative spectral features.

2. Use unsupervised learning techniques like autoencoders to learn a lower dimensional representation of the hyperspectral data before classification. This could help the model learn the most useful spectral features.

3. Explore different deep learning architectures like 3D CNNs that can process hyperspectral data in its full dimensionality. The added depth may allow learning spectral-spatial features.

4. Collect a larger and more diverse hyperspectral dataset to train the models. This could improve generalizability and robustness.

5. Test different methods to balance the visible and infrared channels when collecting data outdoors. This could help obtain higher quality training data.
