    "abstractText": "Blade tip-timing (BTT) signals are always seriously sub-sampled, so reconstruction is much necessary for vibration analysis. Blade vibration responses are sparse in order domain and classical compressed sensing (CS) algorithms are difficult to reconstruct vibration orders due to lack of prior sparse information under variable speeds. In order to deal with this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep compressed sensing (DCS) method. Firstly, a Multi-coset BTT measurement model is built under variable speeds and the DCS model is derived in order domain, where a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed. Next, a Simulink model is built to generate training and testing samples. The simulation results show that the convolution layer with the ReLU layer placed after the BN layer can improve the reconstruction performance and the proposed method has better reconstruction accuracy and speed than classical CS algorithms. In the end, experiments are done and the results demonstrate that blade vibration orders can be recovered accurately by the proposed method, which will provide a novel way of BTT signal analysis.

INTRODUCTION High-speed rotating blades are widely used in modern industry, such as compressor blades, turbine blades, fan blades, and so on. In practice, different faults or damages of rotating blades are prone to happen due to severe operation conditions including strong vibrations, large centrifugal forces and thermal stresses. It has been reported that more than 70% of blade faults are induced by vibrations [1, 2]. Thus on-line blade vibration monitoring is very significant for safety, reliability, and availability. Traditionally, contact methods were widely studied to monitor blade vibrations. Krause and Ostermann [3] proposed a damage detection algorithm for wind turbine blades based on airborne sounds. Abouhnik and Albarbar [4] proposed a novel health index called empirically decomposed feature intensity level for blade condition assessment. Spitas et al. [5] studied a threepoint electrical potential difference method for in-situ\nmonitoring of crack propagating. In addition, strain gauges were also used to measure blade vibrations [6, 7]. However, contact methods have disadvantages of contaminated signals, unexpected intrusion and high cost. As an advanced non-contact method, nowadays blade tip-timing (BTT) has been investigated widely [8], whose advantages include allblade measurement, no intrusion and long-term service ability. Chen et al.[9] gave a comprehensive review on BTT-based health monitoring. However, the intrinsic defect of the BTT method is that vibration signals are seriously sub-sampled [9]. In this case, it is very necessary to reconstruct blade vibrations.\nCurrent challenges of BTT vibration reconstruction can be summarized as three aspects. The first one is from variable operation conditions due to different mission profiles, which can complicate BTT vibration measurement. The second one is from multi-band vibrations due to system\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Accurate multi-band vibration reconstruction is still a difficult task. The third one is lack of prior information of multi-band vibrations. In early studies, blade vibration response is assumed to be a band-pass signal. Under this assumption, Salhi et al.[10] first proposed a method to reconstruct a continuous BTT signal. Chen et al.[11,12] proposed to reconstruct sub-sampled blade vibrations by using the Shannon sampling theorem and wavelet packet transform. Later, Chen et al. further presented two reconstruction methods under speed fluctuations [13] and variable speeds [14], respectively. Lin et al.[15] presented a novel reconstruction method for non-uniformly subsampled BTT data based on the periodically non-uniform sampling theorem. But the assumption of band-pass signals is impractical. Therefore, new reconstruction methods are desirable to overcome the above three challenges.\nBlade vibration responses tend to be multi-band [16], which are generally sparse in frequency or order domain. The sparsity opens up new directions of signal reconstruction. Compressed sensing (CS) was first proposed by Donoho et al.[17], which took fully advantages of signal sparsity to recover certain features from sub-sampled signals. Therefore, it is very promising to introduce the CS theorem to reconstruct BTT signals. Chen et al.[18,19] first built a CS model of BTT measurements. Pan et al.[20] proposed a dictionary learning method for representing BTT signals and then reconstructed blade vibrations by using the basis pursuit algorithm. Spada et al.[21] evaluated several conditions of CS for BTT signals. For the CS model, several classical algorithms have been studied to obtain its unique and stable sparse solution, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Modified Focal Underdetermined System Solver (MFOCUSS) and Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPDN). Chen et al.[19] compared the performances of the above four reconstruction algorithms in BTT vibration reconstruction. However, most of these algorithms still depend on prior sparse information of original signals [22]. To sum up, unknown multi-band vibration reconstruction is still an obstacle of BTT-based vibration monitoring.\nIn recent years, deep learning (DL) has achieved great success in many fields due to excellent learning ability, such as image processing [23], speech recognition [24], and so on. Its most advantage is to learn the structure of a signal and obtain effective inherent information, instead of using prior knowledge. In recent years, DL has being combined with CS for image reconstruction. Zisselman et al.[25] presented a mathematical framework of compressed learning and then introduced a deep neural network (DNN) for image classification. Ye and Han [26] proposed a general deep learning framework called deep convolutional framelets for image reconstruction. Inspired by these studies, this paper will introduce DL into BTT vibration reconstruction and propose an end-to-end deep compressed\nsensing (DCS) method. To the best knowledge, it is the first to introduce the DL method for multi-band blade vibration reconstruction using sub-sampled BTT signals. The remainder of this paper is summarized as follows: In Section 2, basic principles of BTT measurement is introduced briefly and then the character of under-sampling is emphasized. In Section 3, the CS model of BTT measurements is built in angular domain. Then the DCSbased BTT vibration reconstruction algorithm is described in Section 4. Numerical simulations and experiments are done to validate the proposed method in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. In the end, some conclusions are marked in Section 7. II. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nBasic principle of BTT method can be schematically shown in Figure 1. A blisk is composed of K blades and I BTT probes are mounted in a stationary case around the blisk. A once-per-revolution (OPR) sensor are placed close to the rotating shaft on which one speed mark is made, so timing reference signals can be generated. It is assumed that the OPR sensor is on the same radius as the first BTT probe and the OPR marker is on the same radius as the first blade. Then the angular positions of the (1 ) thi i I BTT\nprobe and the (1 ) thk k K blade relative to the OPR mark\nare denoted asi and k , respectively.\nThe basis of BTT method is to measure times of arrival (TOAs) when each blade passes each BTT probe [9]. When there are vibrations, the blades will pass BTT probes earlier or later than theoretical TOAs. Therefore, actual TOAs will deviate from theoretical ones, which will lead to time differences. Furthermore, these time differences are strongly related to vibration frequency and amplitude of the blade, so that they can be used to calculate vibration displacements. TOAs of each blade can be collected during rotation, so the BTT method can measure all-blade vibrations simultaneously. For the sake of easy understanding, let the blisk rotate clockwise at a constant rotating frequency ( rf ). When no vibrations, theoretical TOAs of the kth blade passing the ith BTT probe can be calculated as,\n   , , 2 1 2 2 2 , i k r k ithe i k n\ni k r k i\nn f t\nn f\n     \n                \uff0c \u2264 (1)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The actual TOAs are denoted as , , act i k nt and then vibration displacement of the kth blade measured by the ith BTT probe can be calculated as,\n, , , , ,[ ] 2 ( - ) act the i k r i k n i k nd n f R t t (2) where R is the rotating radius of the blade tip.\nMain concern in Equations (1) and (2) is about the rotating speed. Under variable rotating speeds, theoretical TOAs are difficult to be calculated accurately. In addition, the sampling time interval is not a constant even though BTT probes are mounted uniformly. It is coincident that BTT probes are mounted circumferentially, so that BTT sampling is a natural angular-domain sampling process. As we all know that angular-domain sampling has always been applied to deal with variable speeds [27]. Thus this paper will perform BTT measurements in angular domain.\nIn angular domain, theoretical angles of arrival (AOAs) of the kth blade passing the ith BTT probe under no vibrations can be represented as,\n   , , 2 1 - , ( 1,2, ), 2 1 2 - , ( 1, 2, ), i k k ithe i k n\ni k k i\nn n\nn n\n     \n                 \u2264 (3)\nIn order to illustrate the principle clearly, the rotating speed during each revolution is assumed to be constant. Then actual AOAs of the kth blade passing the ith BTT probe can be calculated as,\n \n \n1\n, 1\n, , ,2 1 2\n= 2 1\nn act i k n p\np\nact i k n n\nik n n\ntn f\nn t\nT  \n \n\n\n  \n      \n  \n (4)\nwhere ,p nT f are the period of the pth revolution and the frequency of the nth revolution, respectively, 2n nf  and iknt is the measured passing time of the kth blade passing the ith BTT probe in the nth revolution.\nCombining Equation (3) with Equation (4), angulardomain sampled vibration displacements of the kth blade measured by the ith BTT probe can be calculated as,\n   , ,, , ,act thei k n i k ni ky n R  (5) Based on Equations (3)~(5), one can see that angulardomain vibration displacements are strongly related to the rotating angular speed in the nth revolution. In engineering applications, n in Equation (4) is often defined as  1= 2n n nt t   in order to reduce the angular bias. Here 1,n nt t  are the ending times of the nth and (n-1)th revolutions, respectively. However, n cannot be looked as a constant if the rotating angular speed changes rapidly. In this case, calibration methods need to be explored, which are out of the scope of this paper. In particular, Equations (3)~(5) still hold under constant rotating speeds.\nAs stated in previous works [14,15], BTT signals are seriously sub-sampled and it is difficult to directly obtain 'true' blade vibration characteristics due to alias. Thus how to\nreconstruct BTT vibrations under variable rotating speeds is an urgent problem to be solved. III. COMPRESSED SENSING MODEL OF BTT VIBRATIONS IN ANGULAR DOMAIN\nTrue vibration displacement of the kth blade in angular domain is assumed to be ( )y  . According to Figure 1, ( )y  is sampled for I times during each revolution. Furthermore, such a sampling scheme can be equivalent to a multi-coset angular sampling (MCAS) process [19]. According to its principle, the multi-coset sampling is a selection of certain samples from the uniform sampling at the Nyquist rate. Here the multi-coset period is denoted as L and L virtual BTT probes are uniformly mounted. The number of each probe is denoted from 1 to L clockwise. Then practical BTT probes are considered to be selected from these L virtual BTT probes, which can be uniformly or non-uniformly mounted. Here L satisfies max2 oL E due to the Nyquist sampling rate, where maxoE is the maximum vibration Engine Order (EO) of the blade.\nThe Nyquist-sampled vibration signals can be represented as,\n   y n y n   , =2 L  (6) Then I actual BTT probes are chosen from the above\nL virtual BTT probes and a MCAS pattern of ( , , )L I C is\nformed. Here { :1 }  iC c i I and ic is the number of the ith probe ( 1 20 -1Ic c c L \uff1c \uff1c ). By this way, sampled vibrations of the ith BTT probe can be represented as,    , 1, ,i iy n y nL c i I    (7) where the sampling interval is denoted as =I L   .\nIn practice, I is always much less than L due to the limitations of space and cost, so that  iy n is always subsampled. It should be pointed out that  y n can be used to perfectly recover true EOs of the blade. Thus the remaining problem is how to correctly reconstruct  y n based on  iy n . For multi-band blade vibrations, they are also sparse in order domain. Thus it is probable to reconstruct  y n from sub-sampled signals (  iy n ) by using the CS theorem. Firstly, the relation between  y n and  iy n in order domain can be built as follows [15].\n  2 +12 2\n1\n+1\n2\ni i Lj Oc L j k c L\ni k\ne L Y O e Y O k\nL\n      \n            (8)\nwhere O denotes the order ( [ 1 2,1 2]O  )\nand    ,iY O Y O are the discrete Fourier transforms of    ,iy n y n , respectively.\nFurthermore, physical meaning of Equation (8) can be described based on Figure 2, where the entire order band ( ( )Y O ) is equally divided into L sub-bands and the lth subband is represented as follows.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 9\nAccording to Equations (8) and (9),  iY O can be looked as the weighed sum of sub-bands of  Y O . In this case, for I BTT probes, Equation (8) can be expressed as the following matrix form.\n( ) ( )O OY \u03a6Y (10)\nwhere,    1 1( ) [ ( )exp 2 , ( )exp 2 ]TI IO Y O j Oc Y O j Oc   Y  , 1( ) [ ( ), ( )] T LO Y O Y OY  ,\n           \n           \n           \n1 1 1exp 2 1- +1 2 / exp 2 - +1 2 / exp 2 - +1 2 /\n1 exp 2 1- +1 2 / exp 2 - +1 2 / exp 2 - +1 2 /\nexp 2 1- +1 2 / exp 2 - +1 2 / exp 2 - +1 2 /\ni i i\nI I I\nj c L L j c l L L j c L L L\nj c L L j c l L L j c L L L L\nj c L L j c l L L j c L L L\n  \n  \n  \n                         \u03a6               \nIn Equation (10), ( ) I nfftO Y  is the measurement matrix which can be calculated by I actual BTT signals. I L\u03a6  is the sensing matrix. ( ) L nfftO Y  is the sub-band matrix which\nis formed based on ( )Y O . Here nfft denotes the point number\nof Fourier transform of  iy n . Based on Figure 2, ( )OY only has few non-zero rows, so it is sparse in order domain. Moreover, I L . Thus Equation (10) can be looked as a CS model of unknown ( )Y O . Furthermore, the sparsity basis is the Fourier basis function.\nNext, the reconstruction task is transformed to find the unknown ( )OY based on the known ( )OY and \u03a6 . According the CS theorem, the solution of Equation (10) can be represented as the following P0 problem.\n:P0 0 min || ( ) ||\n. .

In order to overcome this limitation, an end-to-end DCS framework is\nproposed in Figure 3, which is composed of five parts: measurement of TOAs, calculation of AOAs, multi-coset measurement model, CS model and DNN. Furthermore, there are four key operations: angular sampling, multi-coset sampling, compressed sensing and learning sensing. Key advantages of this framework include: i) Variable conditions can be handled by transferring time domain to angular domain. ii) CS of unknown multi-band vibrations can be obtained by introducing multi-coset sampling. iii) Highfidelity and fast reconstruction can be achieved by using DL algorithms.\nNext, the flowchart of DNN-based reconstruction is shown in Figure 4.

            "text": "Model architecture: The key of Figure 4 is how to design a proper DNN model. As we all know that CNN has many advantages such as simple structure, less training parameters and adaptability. But by now, there have been no standard rules of selecting the CNN architecture. In this paper, a CNN with 4 convolutional layers is selected by hand. Next this paper proposes to design a specific CNN model as shown in Figure 5, which is composed of one input layer, four convolution layers, one pooling layer, two fully connected layers and one output layer.\nFIGURE 5. Basic architecture of the specific CNN model\nFor the above CNN model, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and the Max pooling are used. Traditionally, a Batch Normalization (BN) layer is always placed before the activation function to reduce internal covariate shift and accelerate training [29]. Recently, some studies shown that the BN layer could be placed before the ReLU layer to update the weights in a suboptimal way [30]. In addition, Hinton et al.[31] first proposed to use \u2018Dropout\u2019 to reduce overfitting on a small training set. Later, Park and Kwak[32] analyzed the effect of Dropout in convolution layers. In this case, both a BN layer and a Dropout layer are also introduced to build the convolution layer. Differently, the BN and Dropout layers are combined together and then placed after the ReLU layer. A small dropout probability is applied for the Dropout layer.\nModel parameters: There has been no theoretical heuristics of determining optimal hyperparameters of a DNN. Here, the hyperparameters of the above CNN model are obtained by many trials. In order to evaluate the reconstruction performance of a CNN model, a metric of reconstruction accuracy is defined as follows.\nnumber of correct reconstructions =\nnumber of test samplesa R (17)\nFurthermore, if the reconstructed vector ( S\u0302 ) of a testing sample is the same as the label vector, it is called as \u2018a correct reconstruction\u2019. Based on Equation (17), some architecture parameters of the extended CNN model are obtained and listed in Table 1, including the filter size and the filter number of each layer. The input layer is a 2I L  matrix corresponding to ( )con OY . The kernel sizes of the four convolution layers are 1\u00d7150, 1\u00d750, 1\u00d720 and 1\u00d710, which is denoted as {150-50-20-10}. The kernel size of the Max pooling layer is 2\u00d72. The neuron numbers of the first and second fully connected layers are 1024 and 128, respectively. The output is a 1L vector corresponding to the vector ( S\u0302 ) of band occupancy status. These parameters can be iteratively updated during training. After being trained, the CNN model is used to infer the band occupancy status of unknown multi-band BTT vibration signals. Once S\u0302 is obtained,  Y O can be reconstructed based on Equation (16).\nTABLE 1.

As for variable conditions, it is easy to realize linearly\nvariable speeds, so the rotating frequency ( ( )rf t ) is assumed to increase linearly in this paper. That is to say,  0 0( )=r e sf t f f f t T  (19) where 0 , ef f are the rotating frequencies at the starting time and the ending time, respectively. sT is the total simulation time. Furthermore, three synchronous excitations are chosen to simulate multi-band blade vibrations. That is to say, the vibration excitation can be written as,\n     3 1 ( )= sin 2i i r i i F t A EO f t t t    (20)\nwhere  1, ,3iEO i   denoted the ith EO and  ,i iA t are the corresponding amplitudes and phases.\nNext the BTT sampling process in angular domain is simulated in Matlab/Simulink environment [34] and the whole model is shown in Figure 6(a), which is composed of the system model and angular-domain sampling process. Firstly, the SDOF model in Equation (18) is built as Figure 6(b). Then the angular-domain sampling process of thirteen BTT probes is built by using the \u2018Hit Crossing\u2019 Block and the \u2018Switch\u2019 Block. The details of the \u2018Sensor set 1\u2019 is shown in Figure 6(c), which is the same as those of \u2018Sensor set 2\u2019 and \u2018Sensor set 3\u2019. The key is to determine angular-sampling times. For each rotating blade, its angular position is calculated as    0 2 rt f t t    . When the blade tip passes the ith BTT probe, the angular sampling time in the nth revolution should satisfy the following condition,\n  02 = - 2r if t t n    (21)\n(a) The whole simulation model\nAccording to the BTT principle, each angular-sampling time can be calculated by     0sin 2 =sin -r if t t   , where the left part is carried out by using the \u2018Chirp Signal\u2019 Block and the right part is set as the threshold of the \u2018Hit Crossing\u2019 Block.\nParameter values in the Simulink model are selected artificially and listed in Table 2. Then angularly-sampled blade vibration displacements by each BTT probe can be obtained. Firstly, angular-domain vibration signal sampled by the thirteen BTT probes is shown in Figure 7(a) and its order power spectrum is plotted in Figure 7(b).

Here =13, =4L I and C is generated randomly for each sample. For each MCAS pattern of ( , , )L I C , angular-domain samples (   1[ ], , Iy n y ny  ) are obtained by adding stochastic Gaussian noises with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the corresponding band occupancy status vector ( S\u0302 ) is labeled. Then each pair of  \u02c6,y S constitutes a sample and 14000 simulated samples are generated by this way. One half is used for training and the other half is used for testing (e.g. both equal to 7000). After many trials, the Adam algorithm is used as the optimizer and the learning rate is equal to 0.001.\nB. EFFECTS OF THE SPECIFIC CNN ARCHITECTURE\nThe effects of the CNN architecture on the reconstruction accuracy need to be investigated. Firstly, Four CNNs with different kernel sizes (i.e. {10-5-5-5}, {50-25-25-25}, {100- 50-20-10} and {150-50-20-10}) are studied under different SNRs, and the corresponding reconstruction accuracies are compared in Figure 8(a). It can seen that: i) The reconstruction accuracy increases with the SNR, ii) Filters with a larger width perform better than those with a smaller width, iii) Among the four kernel sizes, {100-50-20-10} leads to the best reconstruction accuracy.\nNext, two kinds of convolutional layers (i.e. the ReLU layer placed before and after the BN layer) are compared in Figure 8(b). One can see that the former has better reconstruction performance. In addition, other architecture parameters may also affect the reconstruction accuracy, which belongs to another and open research scheme. Thus it will not be discussed in this paper.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Here the proposed method will be compared with both these four CS algorithms and the SPGL1 algorithm[36]. The simulation results are shown in Figure 9. One can see that the reconstruction accuracy of the proposed method is much larger than those of the five algorithms under different SNRs. Also the reconstruction accuracy can be further improved if more training samples are used. The SPGL1 algorithm performs more accurately than the four CS algorithms. In addition, the calculation time of the DCS model on the entire testing set is only about 50 seconds and the corresponding time of standard CS algorithms is about 215 seconds. Thus the proposed method also has the fastest reconstruction speed.\nFIGURE 9. Comparison of the proposed method with classical CS algorithms"

            "text": "To further validate the proposed DCS method, an experimental set-up of BTT-based vibration measurement of rotating blades is built as Figure 10. The whole experimental system is composed of a supporting base, an electrical motor, a testing bladed disk, a magnetic exciter, four BTT probes, a once-per-revolution reference sensor, a protection cover, a data acquisition device and vibration analysis software. The electrical motor was mounted under the supporting base. BTT probes were fixed around the bladed disk through the holes in the protection cover and the angle between two adjacent BTT probes is equal to 6\u00b0. The OPR sensor is mounted near the center of the bladed disk. Finally, key experimental parameters are listed in Table 3.\nAt the beginning of the experiment, the rotating speed increases to 5000rpm. Then the range of variable rotating speed is set as 5000rpm~11400rpm and the total acceleration time is equal to 200 seconds. Thus the rotating speed is close\nto increase linearly. During the whole acceleration process, OPR signals and TOAs are collected, which are used to calculate angular-domain vibration displacements. The four BTT probes are numbered 1#, 2#, 3# and 4#. The first blade passing the 1# BTT probe is numbered \u2018Blade 1\u2019and then other blades are numbered from \u2018Blade 2\u2019 to \u2018Blade 32\u2019 along the direction of rotation. According to installation angles of the four BTT probe, the MCAS pattern is represented as   60 4 0 1 2 3\uff0c\uff0c \uff0c\uff0c\uff0c . Here Blade 4 is randomly selected as the target blade.\nBTT vibration displacements of Blade 4 measured by 1# , 2#, 3# and 4# probe are shown in Figure 11, where all peaks mean that some synchronous resonances happen at those times. For example, there is a peak during 8000~9000 revolutions and the corresponding speed range is equal to 8000~8500rpm. Furthermore, vibration EO during 8000~ 8500rpm is equal to 15 according to the Campbell diagram of\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Next measured vibration signal during 8000~9000 revolutions is used to generate training and testing samples, which is shown in Figure 12. The sampled data is divided into a block with size of 4\u00d71000 and the block number is equal to 7000. Then 7000 data blocks are used as the training samples and 3500 data blocks selected randomly are used as the testing samples. It must be pointed out that the reconstructed order band is equal to [-30, 30]. In this case, although there seems only to be an EO (e.g. 15), the sparsity in order domain is equal to 2 (-15 and 15). Therefore, experimental datasets are made from double-band vibration signals.\nB. VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED DCS METHOD\nFirstly, ( )OY is calculated based on measured vibration signals of four actual BTT probes and \u03a6 is obtained based on\nthe arrangement of four BTT probes, as defined in Equation(10). Then the preprocessing process including Equations (12)~(14) is carried out to obtain the input of the specific CNN model. According to the MCAS scheme, the whole order band (e.g. [-30, 30]) of blade vibration is equally divided into 60 sub-bands and the dimension of the band occupancy status vector ( S\u0302 ) is equal to 60. Based on them, training and testing datasets can be constructed. Then training samples are used to train the specific CNN model and the number of iterations is equal to 5. Here model architecture parameters listed in Table 1 are utilized according to aforementioned simulation results. Finally, testing samples are used to calculate the reconstruction accuracy aR .\nThe relation between the reconstruction accuracy ( aR ) and the learning rate ( ) is shown in Figure 13. It can be seen that aR will reach the maximum value when 0.005  . Then the trained DCS model with =0.005 is used to recover the order spectra of Blade 4 in testing samples and typical reconstruction result is shown in Figure 14. It should be emphasized that the reconstruction process does not use any prior information of order bands.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Meanwhile, there are small biases which may be caused by manufacturing and measurement errors. In addition, the pre-trained network by simulation signals is used to run inference on experimental data and the results show that the reconstruction accuracy is less than 50%. It means that the generalization ability of the proposed method is not good, which can be explained by the fact that the generalization ability of CNN models is poor."

            "text": "In order to accurately and fast reconstruct BTT vibrations under variable rotating speeds, this paper proposes an end-toend DCS method. The main novelties of the paper include the following three aspects:\n(1) An end-to-end DCS-based framework of BTT vibration reconstruction under variable speeds is proposed, including angular sampling, multi-coset sampling, compressed sensing and learning sensing.\n(2) A DCS model of BTT measurements under variable speeds is derived in angular domain, where a CNN model is built by using specific convolution layers with the ReLU layer placed after the BN layer.\n(3) A DL-driven CS-recovery procedure is introduced to the field of BTT vibration analysis. The proposed DCS method is better than classical reconstruction algorithms from the perspective of reconstruction accuracy and speed.\nIn addition, there is still a challenge due to multimode shapes of the bladed disk, which causes tip-timing signal derivations and reduces the reconstruction performance. It is desirable to build a multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical model and study how to reduce the effects of other mode shapes. Also, the generalization ability of the proposed method is poor. In future, transfer learning should be a promising direction of overcoming this issue [22, 38].\nAPPENDIX Nomenclature\nAOAs Angles of arrival BN Batch Normalization BPDN Basis pursuit denoising BTT Blade tip-timing CNN Convolutional neural network CS Compressed sensing\nDCS Deep compressed sensing DL Deep learning DNN Deep neural network EO Engine Order\nMCAS Multi-coset angular sampling MFOCUSS Modified Focal Underdetermined System Solver\nMUSIC Multiple signal classification OMP Orthogonal matching pursuit OPR Once-per-revolution ReLU Rectified linear unit\nRIP Restricted Isometry Property SDOF Single-degree-of-freedom SNRs Signal-to-noise ratios TOAs Times of arrival"
