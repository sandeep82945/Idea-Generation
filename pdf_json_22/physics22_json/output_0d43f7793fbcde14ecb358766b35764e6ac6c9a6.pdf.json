In this paper, we study the performance frontiers of the enumerative (factorial) encoding of hexapod gaits for fast recovery to conditions of leg failures. Our computational studies using five nature-inspired gradient-free optimization heuristics have shown that it is possible to render feasible recovery gait strategies that achieve minimal deviation to desired locomotion directives with a few evaluations (trials). For instance, it is possible to generate viable recovery gait strategies reaching 2.5 cm. (10 cm.) deviation on average with respect to a commanded direction with 40 60 (20) evaluations/trials. Our results are the potential to enable efficient adaptation to new conditions and to explore further the canonical representations for adaptation in robotic locomotion problems.",

INTRODUCTION\nContemporary multilegged robotic systems are expected to adapt to failing actuators on the field to continuously perform navigation, exploration, and user-defined tasks when repair is difficult[1], [2]. In particular, robots operating in humanunfriendly environments, such as a disaster area, acquire motion by using crawling gaits or linear/rotating actuators. For instance, Quince robot uses crawling[3] while Spirit uses rotating wheels. Crawling and legged mechanisms are considered more beneficial than rotating actuators because wheels are difficult to control on noisy, uneven, and steep surfaces and because crawling is more robust to failures of actuation mechanisms. Thus, crawling mechanisms are preferred in such circumstances in difficult environments.\nAmong the existing locomotion mechanisms, the multilegged locomotion systems have attracted the community\u2019s attention, especially quadrupeds and hexapod systems. Although the number of legs increases the complexity and weight of the overall design, the higher number of legs accomplish better crawling efficiency and better motion reliability due to redundancy of the end locomotion means. Therefore, robots with multiple leg mechanisms are the most suitable and preferable to study to be helpful in hazardous and scaffolding locations.\nThe community has focused efforts on studying Central Pattern Generators (CPG), Neural Networks (NN), and Hidden\nMarkov Models[2] to render crawling mechanisms. CPG is inspired by natural spiking neurons to generate a walking rhythm and has been widely used to perform multilegged gaits in robots[4]. NN is a graphical/mathematical model inspired by the multiperceptron and has been widely used to generate walking gaits in legged systems[5], [6] as well. However, the conventional control mechanisms for legged systems suffer from adaptability issues, especially when actuators become malfunction, rendering the overall system unstable[7]. Generally speaking, multilegged systems should adapt to malfunction quickly to enable the smooth conduction of tasks.\nFurthermore, a multilegged mechanism usually responds to malfunction by selecting embedded recovery strategies or learning new recovery plans depending on its current state. Although both schemes have been studied widely during the last decade, researchers have often preferred using sample-based learning algorithms such as the ones based on gradients[8], evolutionary computing[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [16], Bayesian optimization[14] and reinforcement learning[15].\nThe studies mentioned above rendered new learning-based adaptation strategies to respond to malfunction. For instance, recent studies have used vector-based representations of gait\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n00 48\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\nS ep\n2 02\ncontrollers[14], [16], enabling us to understand the search and constraint space of gait adaptation mechanisms when actuators in multilegged systems become malfunction. This paper explores the benefits of using an enumerative encoding strategy to render new gait adaptation strategies when legs in hexapods malfunction. The enumerative encoding mechanism uses the factorial numbering system and uses the bijective property to the integer number system. As such, it is possible to enumerate all possible recovery gaits when legs are subject to failure. In particular, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 The performance and trajectory characterization of all feasible gait strategies under a tailored duty cycle when hexapods\u2019 legs are prone to failure. \u2022 The study of well-known nature-inspired gradient-free optimization heuristics in tackling the gait recovery problem, showing that the gradient-free optimization heuristics are able to find recovery gaits with the small number of function evaluations.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes preliminaries in our study, section 3 describes the computational experiments, and section 4 concludes the paper."

            "text": "Let a hexapod system have legs numbered with integer numbers as shown by Fig. 2. In order to realize locomotion in the desired direction, as shown by the red line of Fig. 2, it is essential to move the legs to maintain the desired locomotion strategy. Let the position of the i-th leg be represented by the vector pi, with i \u2208 [1, 6]. It is possible to render gait strategies by computing offsets di that modify the position of each leg with respect to their initial position poi , and let the inverse kinematics and the control strategy to attain such offsets[19]. Thus, the position of each leg can be represented as follows:\npi = p o i + di, (1)\ndi = (mi(u) cos(\u03b8),mi(u) sin(\u03b8), hi(u)), (2)\nwhere mi is the magnitude of the offset of the i-th leg in the plane as a function of the normalized time u \u2208 [0, 1), hi is the height offset, and \u03b8 is the desired hexapod locomotion orientation in the plane. Naturally, \u03b8 \u2208 [0\u25e6, 360\u25e6]. Fig. 2 shows the direction of the desired locomotion, and considering the orientations of the x-y axis, \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 in Fig. 2. The value of mi and hi can be computed from the normalized time u, as follows:\nmi(u) =  3uA 2 u \u2208 [0, 1 3 ), A 2 \u2212 3A(u\u2212 1 3 ) u \u2208 [ 1 3 , 1 2 ), \u22123A(u\u2212 12 ) u \u2208 [ 1 2 , 2 3 ), \u2212A2 ( 1\u2212 3(u\u2212 23 ) ) u \u2208 [ 23 , 1),\n(3)\nhi(u) =  0 u \u2208 [0, 13 ), 6H(u\u2212 13 ) u \u2208 [ 1 3 , 1 2 ), H ( 1\u2212 6(u\u2212 12 ) ) u \u2208 [ 12 , 2 3 ),\n0 u \u2208 [ 23 , 1),\n(4)\nIn the above-mentioned formulations, the constant A refers to the step amplitude, and H refers to the step height, both of which can be set according to the size of the hexapod or structure of the legs. Also, the normalized time u is a function of the duty cycle of the i-th leg, i.e., it is dependent on the actual or simulation time and the order in which each leg is used. Then, for each leg i \u2208 [1, 6]:\nu = mod ( t+\ngi \u2212 1 6\n, 1 ) , (5)\nwhere t is the actual or simulation time and gi \u2208 [1, 6] is the index of the i-th leg used for movement. The division by six is due to the six legs of the hexapod system, and the modulus operator is to ensure that u \u2208 [0, 1) is suitably normalized. As such, the configuration of gi is basically the permutation of legs that enable the above-mentioned gait strategy and can be encoded by the factorial numbering system:\ng = (g1, g2, ..., g6), (6)\nwhere gi is the index of the leg used for locomotion in the i-th order. For instance, g = (5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 6) represents a gait strategy in which leg 5, leg 1, leg 2, leg 4, leg 3 and leg 6 are used in such order to compute the offsets for legs 1...6. Naturally, the above representation is a subset of all possible hexapod gait encodings, and since the factorial number system is used, it is possible to render all possible gaits from the 1-1 bijection to the integer set {1, ..., n!}.\nNow, when a leg in a hexapod system malfunctions, it is expected that the remaining five legs will render a limited set of gait strategies (5! = 120), for which it is possible to study gait adaptations for particular friction parameters in the actuators and the floor.\nCompared to conventional vector-based encodings[16], the factorial representation brings the potential of introducing\ncanonicity and diversity concepts into the gradient-free optimization algorithms.\n\u2022 Canonicity implies that every solution in the search space can be rendered from a unique and single encoding, without repetitions, and while avoiding potential repair operators. Although this notion was introduced in the context of Genetic Programming[18], the idea of allowing unique representations enables to construct a search space that is convex, in principle. \u2022 Since each representation in the factorial search space is unique, it becomes potential to sample previously unsampled solutions since the distance metrics can be computed from the difference between two numbers. In the context of a hexapod system, since the factorial number system has a 1-1 bijection to integer numbers, it is possible to search in the space of numbers to explore qualitatively different hexapod gaits as two different integer numbers will represent behaviourally different locomotion strategies. \u2022 Also, since gait strategies can be encoded by integer numbers, then it is possible to use parallel computing schemes to explore the performance of behaviourally distinct gait strategies in tandem."

Realizing the locomotion strategies in different orientations is straightforward. Studying the trajectory tracking for non-linear paths is out of the scope of this paper. Also, we let the step amplitude A = 0.11E, and the step height H = 0.02E be fractions of the overall size factor E or the hexapod[19].\nFurthermore, our computing environment consisted of an Intel i9-9900K, 3.6GHz, and our gradient-free optimization heuristics were implemented in Matlab 2021b.

We investigated the trajectories when the hexapod is requested to navigate according to the user-defined orientation \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 in the plane and when each particular legs malfunction. Here,\n1) When a leg becomes malfunctioning, five legs remain functioning, and we generated all 5! = 120 gait recoveries. 2) Given a gait strategy, we let the hexapod navigate towards the user-defined orientation \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 during 30 s. 3) We logged the trajectory for each case of combining a malfunctioning leg and a gait recovery strategy.\nAlthough it is possible to skip and lock the malfunctioning leg to avoid contact with the floor, as the related works[16], we rather let the malfunctioning legs contact the floor to simulate the challenging conditions of navigating under friction and varying overall system dynamics.\nTo show the performance of the overall system, Fig. 3 shows the trajectories of the hexapod when particular legs malfunction, and Fig. 4 shows examples of the trajectory followed by the hexapod using an arbitrary gait strategy when leg 2 and leg 6 became malfunctioning. By observing the trajectories from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we can note the following facts:\n\u2022 Each sub-figure of Fig. 3 shows all the origin (start) of the location of the hexapod system and the followed trajectories when the hexapod used all computable gait strategies from the enumerative (factorial) encoding system under each scenario of leg failure. \u2022 For instance, Fig. 3 shows that when leg 2 and leg 3 malfunction, the hexapod tends to move towards the leftside in counterclockwise fashion. \u2022 On the other hand, when leg 5 and leg 6 become malfunction, the hexapod tends to move towards the right side in a clock-wise fashion. This phenomenon is due to leg 2/leg 3 (leg 5/leg 6) being located on the left (right) side of the plane that divides the hexapod\u2019s x-axis, as shown in Fig. 2; thus, the weight and friction with the floor make the system relatively unstable. \u2022 Furthermore, when leg 1 and leg 4 become malfunction, the hexapod either follows a relatively straight trajectory or tends to turn left or right, depending on the kind of gait strategy used.\nThe results mentioned in this section pinpoint the feasibility of computing gait recovery strategies under the enumerative (factorial) encoding scheme. By exploring the performance of trajectories with respect to deviation to a line, Fig. 3 can be used to consider the alternative gait recovery plans that best meet the desired movement direction and goal."

            "text": "The previous section has shown the performance of the overall hexapod system in situations of leg failures. In changing conditions of floor dynamics and online performance considerations, it would be desirable to render recovery strategies\nunder a small number of function evaluations to meet the locomotion in the desired direction.\nSince the gait strategies can be mapped into the integer system, it becomes possible to search in the space of numbers with a lower bound set as one and the upper bound set as 5! = 120 (assuming one leg is subject to failure). Naturally, it will be necessary to use a gradient-based optimization algorithm to assess the integer-based search space. Here,\n1) For each scenario of leg failure and each algorithm, the objective function F is set as the deviation in the commanded direction. 2) As such, the goal of the optimization heuristic will be to compute a gait recovery plan that allows the hexapod to navigate along the line of the x-axis (i.e., the orientation \u03b8 = 0\u25e6) during 30 s.\nAlso, before locomotion, we allow the robot to rotate in its own axis to self-adjust the balance of the overall robot system and to meet the desired locomotion in the user-defined orientation \u03b8 = 0\u25e6. This strategy allows the system to solve the stability problem first when the leg touches the floor and to avoid sudden turns to the right or the left side, as shown in Fig. 3, due to the unstable distribution of weight. In principle, by rotating on its own axis, the hexapod aims at finding the balanced distribution of the remaining legs contacting the floor. One wishes that the Centre of Gravity (COG) be within the convex hull of the projection of the legs at the floor, as shown\nby Fig. 5. Then, the role of the optimization heuristic is to find the suitable gait strategy to achieve minimal deviation to the desired orientation in locomotion. The reader may note that by tackling this goal, we also implicitly tackle the dynamic balancing of the system.\nThis subsection studies the performance of well-known nature-inspired optimization heuristics to attain effective gait recoveries. As such, we studies the performance of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)[20], Particle Swarm Optimization with Speciation (PSOSP)[21], Differential Particle Scheme (DPS)[22], Differential Evolution with BEST/1/BIN mutation (DEBEST)[23], Differential Evolution with RAND/1/BIN mutation (DERAND)[23]. Parameters for algorithms based on Particle Swarms involve \u03c9 = 0.5, weight on pbest c1 = 0.5, weight on gnest c2 = 2, population size was set as 10. Other parameters implement the default configurations stated in the references. As for Differential Evolution algorithms, the\ncrossover rate was CR = 0.5, the scaling factor F = 0.7. The fine tuning of the above-mentioned parameters is out of the scope of this paper.\nFor evaluations, we used 30 independent runs with 120 function evaluations at the maximum (since 5! = 120 corresponds to the maximum number of gait strategies when a leg is subject to failure), enabling the comparison of various modes of exploration/exploitation under tight computational budgets.\nIn order to show the nature of the search space under the above-mentioned considerations, Fig. 6 shows the trajectories of the hexapod system for different scenarios of leg failure. By observing the results in Fig. 6, we note the following facts:\n\u2022 Each sub-figure shows the origin (start) and the followed trajectories for each condition of leg failure and each gait rendered from the enumerative (factorial) encoding scheme.\n\u2022 Each sub-figure of Fig. 6 shows the effect of self-rotation in the own axis is able to solve the balancing of the overall system and to avoid motions towards undesirable directions (i.e., towards the left or right side as shown by Fig. 6). \u2022 Although each sub-figure shows that certain gait strategies make the hexapod turn towards the left or right side, Fig. 6) also shows that there exists a number of gait strategies that achieve small deviation with respect to the x-axis (i.e., the desired orientation of the locomotion).\nIn order to show the behavior of the convergence algorithm across the 30 independent runs, Fig. 7 shows the number of function evaluations on the x-axis, and the mean convergence of the function F , in the y-axis (units in m). By observing Fig. 7, we can note the following facts:\n\u2022 The fitness values converge to values around 2.5 cm in\nmost of the cases for each situation of leg failure. These results imply that the optimization heuristics were able to generate hexapod gaits that achieved minimal deviation. \u2022 The fastest convergence occurs in the period of less than 0-20 function evaluations, whereas the convergence becomes relatively flat over the region 20-120. This observation implies that it becomes relatively simple and tractable to generate gait recoveries that aim to achieve locomotion in a desired direction. \u2022 The convergence to minimal values occurs in about 40-60 evaluations. Also, it is possible to converge to a deviation of about 10 cm in less than 20 function evaluations. This observation shows that it is possible to obtain feasible and effective recovery gaits with a small number of function evaluations, implying that a large number of simulations and real-world trials may not be necessary as suggested by the related works[14], [16]. \u2022 All studied algorithms were able to attain competitive performance under a small number of evaluations, implying that the search space is amenable to the characteristics of the studied heuristics. Studying the performance of different and tailored search heuristics is out of the scope of this paper and left for future work.\nTo portray the types of gait recovery plans that our approach was able to generate, Fig. 8 shows the trajectories of the hexapod of all algorithms when particular legs become malfunctioning. Basically, Fig. 8 shows the trajectories of all gait recoveries obtained from all algorithms\u2019 overall independent runs. Also, Fig. 9 shows samples of trajectories when the hexapod has leg 2 and leg 6 under failure conditions. By observing Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can observe the following:\n\u2022 The hexapod was able to navigate while meeting the desired orientation \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 reasonably well for each situation of leg failure.\n\u2022 All optimization heuristics rendered reasonably good gait strategies that meet the navigation requirements. \u2022 Compared to Fig. 4, the trajectories shown in Fig. 9 show that it is possible to overcome the undesirable pattern to have the system moving to the left and right sides.\nThe above-mentioned observations pinpoint the potential of using optimization heuristics to generate gait recoveries that attain minimal deviation to locomotion directives. In future works, we plan to explore the role of synchrony and parallelism in rendering feasible gaits[24], as well study the role of combinatorial and graph structures to consider the motion of multiple legs at the time[25]. Also, we plan to study whether a tailored class of optimization heuristics would solve the gait recovery under the enumerative encoding scheme."

We also have evaluated the extent and degree of preserving the locomotion directives while exploring all possible gait strategies. Furthermore, we have evaluated the performance of five nature-inspired gradientfree optimization heuristics to render effective gait recovery strategies. Our computational studies have shown that it is possible to render feasible recovery gait strategies that achieve minimal deviation to desired locomotion directives in a few evaluations (trials). In particular, we found that it is possible to render gait strategies achieving 2.5 cm (10 cm ) error in average with respect to a commanded direction with 40- 60 (20) evaluations/trials. In future work, we plan to study the performance of parallelism, combinations, and tailored heuristics for gait adaptation. We argue that using canonical encoding mechanisms[18] is beneficial to allowing efficient fault-tolerant and adaptive locomotion systems."
