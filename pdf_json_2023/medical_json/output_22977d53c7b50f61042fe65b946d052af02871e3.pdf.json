    "abstractText": "Micro/nanorobots can propel and navigate in many hardto-reach biological environments, and thus may bring revolutionary changes to biomedical research and applications. However, current MNRs lack the capability to collectively perceive and report physicochemical changes in unknown microenvironments. Here we propose to develop swarming responsive photonic nanorobots that can map local physicochemical conditions on the fly and further guide localized photothermal treatment. The RPNRs consist of a photonic nanochain of periodically-assembled magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated in a responsive hydrogel shell, and show multiple integrated functions, including energetic magnetically-driven swarming motions, bright stimuli-responsive structural colors, and photothermal conversion. Thus, they can actively navigate in complex environments utilizing their controllable swarming motions, then visualize unknown targets (e.g., tumor lesion) by collectively mapping out local abnormal physicochemical conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, or glucose concentration) via their responsive structural colors, and further guide external light irradiation to initiate localized photothermal treatment. This work facilitates the development of intelligent motile nanosensors and versatile multifunctional nanotheranostics for cancer and inflam-",

            "text": "Physicochemical conditions of the local microenvironment, such as local viscosity, temperature, redox potential, and pH, determine the mass diffusion, energy transfer, reaction rate, and intermolecular interactions in cells, tissues, and so on [1\u20133]. For instance, due to abnormal metabolism in tumor cells, tumor microenvironments have been characterized by numerous physical and (bio)chemical differences relative to normal tissues, which further lead to the accelerated proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells and the reduced function of immune cells [4\u20136]. Therefore, detecting and mapping local physicochemical conditions in biological microenvironments are of great significance for understanding various physiological processes, studying pathogenesis, and developing drugs. Up to now, various nanosensors have been developed using optical, magnetic, and electrochemical signal transduction methods [7\u201312]. Among them, optical nanosensors based on responsive photonic crystals, which refer to the periodic nanostructures with adjustable photonic bandgaps in response to external stimuli, have gained considerable attention recently due to their rapid visual readout, high stability, and robust reversibility [13\u201323]. However, traditional nanosensors generally involve no motility and can not actively explore unknown microenvironments to report local physicochemical changes.\nMotile micro/nanorobots (MNRs) are capable of propelling and navigating in various liquid media by harvesting energy from surrounding chemicals or external fields [24\u201333]. Due to their small sizes, they hold great promise to operate in hard-to-reach cavities of the human body that are impossible by conventional techniques, and thus may bring revolutionary changes to future theranostics [27, 34, 35]. Especially, when incorporated with signal transducers, they may act as swimming micro/nanosensors to perform sensing in a motile-targeting manner, and provide new opportunities for analytical and diagnostic technologies. For example, by boosting mass/energy exchanges with surrounding environments on the fly, the MNRs have been demonstrated to efficiently detect nucleic acid, proteins, bacteria, heavy metal ions, and pH, utilizing transduction mechanisms of motion speed, fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and current [36\u201343]. However, current\nsensing MNRs are single MNRs relying strongly on random propulsions, and are inadequate to perform complex rapid, wide-range, and robust sensing tasks due to their low targetability, limited area coverage, and poor reproducibility (individual differences). On the other hand, purely through local diffusiophoretic, electrostatic, magnetic, and hydrodynamic interactions, MNRs can further self-organize into large swarms and show intriguing collective behaviors that single individuals do not have, such as enhanced driving forces, strong robustness, adaptive reconfigurations, rapid large-area coverage, and high imaging contrast [44\u201351]. Thus, the swarming MNRs can operate reliably in complex environments with excellent trackability, and are also able to cooperatively transport heavy cargoes or deliver a large dose of drugs in a short period of time [52\u201354]. Nonetheless, the so-far developed swarming MNR systems are composed of rigid individuals or building blocks with poor intelligence (e.g., Fe3O4 and TiO2 particles) [55], and usually can not perceive and report local physicochemical changes in surrounding microenvironments.\nHere we propose to develop swarming responsive photonic nanorobots (RPNRs) capable of translating microenvironmental physicochemical conditions into visual colormapping signals on the fly and further guiding localized photothermal treatment. The RPNRs consist of a nanochain of periodically-arranged Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in a responsive hydrogel shell, and exhibit multiple integrated functions, including magnetic propulsion under alternating magnetic fields due to their magnetic response, stimuli-responsive structural colors from their periodic nanostructures and responsive hydrogel shell [18], and photothermal effect from light absorption and conversion of the Fe3O4 components [56]. With these integrated functions, the RPNRs can actively navigate in complex microenvironments utilizing their controllable collective motions, then visualize the unknown target (e.g., tumor lesion) by mapping out local abnormal physicochemical changes (e.g., pH, temperature, or glucose concentration changes) via their responsive structural colors, and further guide external near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to initiate their photothermal conversion to achieve localized photothermal treatment. This work facilitates the development of intelligent motile photonic nanosensors for targeted microenvironmental mapping, and\n1 3\nthe integrated functions of the developed swarming RPNRs may enable them to act as smart nanotheranostics for cancer\u00a0and\u00a0inflammatory diseases."

The designed RPNR comprises a photonic nanochain of periodically-arranged magnetic Fe3O4 NPs and a responsive hydrogel shell (inset i in Fig.\u00a01). Under a rotating magnetic field Hr(t), the RPNRs can perform directional motions in a rolling mode due to their magnetic response (inset ii in Fig.\u00a01), and further selforganize into microswarms utilizing local hydrodynamic\ninteractions [47]. In addition, due to the photonic bandgap resulting from the periodic organization of the encapsulated Fe3O4 NPs and responsive swelling or deswelling of the hydrogel shell [18], the RPNRs would display bright structural colors in response to local physicochemical conditions (e.g., low pH, high temperature and low glucose concentration near tumor lesion [2]) (inset iii in Fig.\u00a01). Utilizing their swarming motions and responsive structural colors, they can actively navigate in complex microenvironments, and visualize unknown tumor targets by mapping local abnormal physicochemical conditions in real-time and with high robustness. Further, by employing the mapping result for guidance in nanorobot-user interaction, they, due to the photothermal conversion of the Fe3O4 components under NIR light [56], can be then triggered to perform the localized photothermal treatment to induce tumor-cell apoptosis. In contrast to the reported swarming magnetic MNRs, which are mainly comprised of magnetic particles with poor intelligence and simple functions [24, 46], the designed swarming RPNRs can perceive and respond to surrounding physicochemical signals, and show multiple integrated functions of magnetically-driven collective motions, responsive structural colors, and photothermal conversion. These features bestow the swarming RPNRs with great potential in motile-targeting disease diagnosis and imaging-guided treatment. Given the considerable challenges associated with localizing and navigating nanorobots within the bloodstream, the swarming RPNRs are primarily designed for potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of superficial tumors, such as superficial oral, esophageal, lung, gastric, and bladder carcinomas [58\u201360].\nTo implement the concept, the pH-RPNRs were fabricated at first using an in-situ magnetic assembly-polymerization method (see details in Experimental Procedure and Fig. S1a) [18]. The fabricated pH-RPNR has a nanochain-like structure with a length of ~ 10\u00a0\u03bcm and a diameter of 200\u00a0nm (Fig. S1b-d). The detailed structure of the nanorobot was confirmed by TEM observation and FT-IR analysis, suggesting that it comprises a poly(acrylic acidco-2-Hydroxyethyl acrylate) (poly(AA-co-HEA)) hydrogel shell (8\u00a0nm) enveloping an inner one-dimensional nanochain of periodically-arranged Fe3O4 NPs (150\u00a0nm) (Fig. S1e, f). The hysteresis loop of pH-RPNRs reveals that they are superparamagnetic and have a high saturated mass magnetization of 27.4 emu g\u22121 at room temperature\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01095-5\u00a9 The authors\n(Fig. S1g), facilitating their magnetically-driven propelling and swarming."

            "text": "Under a rotating magnetic field (Hr(t), Eq.\u00a01) [61], a magnetic torque is exerted on the magnetic pH-RPNR and forces it to rotate around its short axis with an angular velocity \u03c9r.\nHere, H0 and f are the strength and frequency of the rotating Hr(t), nx , ny , nz are the unit vectors in the x-, y-, and z-axis directions, respectively. When rotating near a substrate (the hydrodynamic no-slip boundary), the top and bottom of the rotating pH-RPNR experience different viscous fluidic drag forces (FD1 and FD2, FD1 < FD2, Fig.\u00a02a). As a result, the hydrodynamic symmetry of the rotating pH-RPNR is broken, and they can thus perform a \u201crolling\u201d translational motion due to the coupling of the rotational motion around the bottom and the translational motion of the bottom. The detailed mechanism of the nanorobots is shown in Fig.\u00a02a, and it depicts that a pH-RPNR rotating about the y-axis with\n(1) r(t) = ( H0 sin 2 ft x, 0,H0 cos 2 ft z )\nthe rotating Hr(t) would move in the x-direction near the substrate.\nThe translational motion of a typical chain-like pHRPNR is shown in Fig.\u00a02b and Video S1. It can be seen that the pH-RPNR moves in a nearly straight-line trajectory with a v of 2.8\u00a0\u03bcm s\u22121 under a rotating Hr(t) with an H0 of 25 mT and an f of 3\u00a0Hz (0\u20138.1\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a02b). By simply changing the direction (or rotating axis) of the rotating Hr(t), the motion direction of the pH-RPNRs can be adjusted, and it can move along a predesigned trajectory, as verified by the red zigzag trajectory with two sharp turns (8.1\u201332.6\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a02b). Besides the controllable directions and trajectories, the velocity (v) of the pH-RPNRs can also be controlled by adjusting H0 and f of the applied Hr(t). When the H0 was increased from 5 to 15 mT while keeping f at 5\u00a0Hz, the v of the pH-RPNRs increased gradually (Fig.\u00a02c). This is because, at a low H0, the applied Hr(t) cannot provide a strong enough magnetic torque for the pH-RPNR to resist the fluid viscous drag force, making it often rotate with a lower f than that of Hr(t) (\u03c9r < \u03a9r). With the increasing H0, the magnetic torque exerted on the pH-RPNR is enhanced for it to resist the viscous drag, and the v of the pH-RPNR increases accordingly. When H0 was\n1 3\nover a critical value (Hc, Hc = 15 mT here), the pH-RPNR rotated synchronously with the applied Hr(t) and moved in a stable v with the increasing H0. On the other hand, if the f was increased from 1 to 20\u00a0Hz but kept the H0 at 25 mT, the v of the pH-RPNR increased at first and then decreased with the increasing f, as shown in Fig.\u00a02d. The maximum v was found to be 5.4\u00a0\u03bcm s\u22121 at the step-out frequency ( fc ) of 8\u00a0Hz, after which the rotation of the pH-RPNR became unstable and asynchronous with the applied Hr(t), and thus the v gradually decreased with the increasing f [54].\nWhen a precessing magnetic field (Hw(t)) [24] was applied, the pH-RPNR can move in a \u201cwalking\u201d mode, in which two ends of the pH-RPNR rotating around the precession axis can act as its \u201cfeet\u201d to alternatively touch the substrate, making the pH-RPNR \u201cwalk\u201d smoothly on\nthe substrate (Fig. S2a and Video S1). Similar to the \u201crolling\u201d pH-RPNR (Fig.\u00a02a-d), the \u201cwalking\u201d pH-RPNR also employs the non-slip boundary-induced symmetry-breaking mechanism in their translational motions (Fig. S2a) and shows controllable directions and velocity depending on the precessing direction, H0 and f of the Hw(t), respectively (Fig. S2b-d). The notable difference was found to be that the \u201cwalking\u201d pH-RPNR showed a lower Hc (10 mT) and a higher fc (16\u00a0Hz) than the \u201crolling\u201d pHRPNR (Hc = 15 mT, fc = 8\u00a0Hz), and thus it had a higher maximum v (16.7\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121) than the \u201crolling\u201d pH-RPNR (v = 5.4\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121). This difference can be attributed to the less moment of inertia in the \u201cwalking\u201d mode (Fig. S2a), leading to the less energy required for the \u201cwalking\u201d pHRPNR to rotate and move in the liquid medium.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01095-5\u00a9 The authors\nThe pH-RPNRs have a periodic organization in structures, and thus they have a photonic bandgap and show visual structural colors (Fig.\u00a02e). In addition, due to rich carboxyl groups in the hydrogel shell, their structural colors are highly sensitive to local pH changes (Fig.\u00a02e). When local pH increases, carboxyl groups in the poly(AA-co-HEA) hydrogel shell of the pH-RPNR deprotonate into carboxylates, resulting in the swelling of the hydrogel shell due to the higher solubility of the latter [18]. This, in turn, makes the interparticle distance d, namely, the lattice spacing of the encapsulated photonic nanochain, become larger, leading to a red shift of the diffracted color of pH-RPNRs according to Bragg\u2019s law [62, 63]:\nwhere is the diffraction wavelength, n is the relative refractive index, and is the angle between the incident light and the short axis of the pH-RPNR. In contrast, carboxylates in the poly(AA-co-HEA) hydrogel scaffold protonate into carboxyl groups when the surrounding pH decreases, resulting in the shrinkage of the hydrogel scaffold and the blue shift of the diffracted color of the pH-RPNR. To test the pH responses of the pH-RPNR, we first observed the length variation of a typical pH-RPNR at different pH (Fig.\u00a02f). When a pH 7.4 buffer solution was added, the length of a horizontally-aligned pH-RPNR in a pH 4.4 buffer solution increased from 9.1 to 11.7\u00a0\u03bcm, reflecting its high deformation capability (elongation rate, 28.6%) in response to pH changes. With the elongation of the pH-RPNR, its structural color would change because of the increased d according to Bragg\u2019s law (Eq.\u00a02). To verify this, a drop of the pH 7.4 buffer solution was added at the right side (~ 4\u00a0mm away) of a vertically-reoriented pH-RPNR in pH 4.4 buffer solution (blue spot in Fig.\u00a02g). With the diffusion of the pH 7.4 buffer solution, the pH-RPNR gradually changes its structural color from blue to green, yellow and red within 4.7\u00a0s (Fig.\u00a02g). It is noted that the pH-RPNR had a high resolution of ~ 200\u00a0nm in pH sensing, which may pave the way for it to perform targeted on-the-fly pH detection in many hard-to-reach narrow spaces when combined with its magnetic propulsion."

            "text": "Except for the high-resolution sensing at the single-sensor level, rapid area-covering mapping of environmental physicochemical conditions by a group of nanorobots is also highly desired. Fortunately, similar to swarming organisms in\n(2) = 2nd sin\nnature, the pH-RPNRs can self-organize into microswarms under magnetic actuation when their local number density is increased. As shown in Fig.\u00a03a and Video S2, when a rotating Hr(t) with an H0 of 25 mT and an f of 3\u00a0Hz is applied, a stripe-like cluster of the gathered pH-RPNRs starts to propagate rightward, and as the frontline becomes unstable, it gradually transforms into a mushroom-cloud-like swarm. This phenomenon bears a resemblance to the formation of the mushroom-cloud-like flow pattern under Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability when a fluid jet intrudes into another fluid with similar density [64]. The swarming mechanism can be attributed to the hydrodynamic coupling between neighboring rolling pH-RPNRs [47]. Specifically, when a rotating Hr(t) is applied, the magnetic pH-RPNR behaves as a roller that produces a small local vortex with a flow velocity decaying as r\u22122, where r is the distance to its rotation axis. In this way, neighboring rollers are attracted and advected by one another via hydrodynamic coupling and further gather into large compact rolling swarms rotating around their center of mass and translating along the substrate [47]. Due to the swarming behaviors, the pH-RPNRs show a striking collective effect, with which they move at a high collective velocity (U) of 86.5\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121, about 50 times higher than single pH-RPNRs (1.8\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121) at the same condition (Fig.\u00a03b and Video S3). Moreover, the swarm is stable, as evidenced by the negligible changes in group structure when repeatedly activated and stopped or during prolonged movement (Fig. S3 and Video S4).\nBy adjusting the concentration of the pH-RPNRs in the aqueous medium, they, under an Hr(t), can form into microswarms of tens of times different in size. Fig. S4 shows four typical microswarms with different areas (S) from 0.1 to 1.2 mm2. Further, we found that the U of the microswarms depends strongly on their S. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c, under the fixed magnetic field parameters (H0 = 25 mT, f = 2\u00a0Hz), the U of the microswarm rises from 15.6 to 82.9\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121 when its S increases from 0.1 to 2.8 mm2. The increasing U with S can be explained by the enhanced hydrodynamic coupling among neighboring rolling pHRPNRs as the S increases. The collective velocity U of the swarming pH-RPNRs shows a positive linear correlation with S following U = \u03b1Sv, where \u03b1 was determined to be 24.9 in our experiments. In addition, the test of f-dependent velocity revealed that the microswarm (S = ~ 2 mm2)\n1 3\nshared a similar step-out frequency (fc = 7\u00a0Hz) to single pH-RPNRs (fc = 8\u00a0Hz) (Fig.\u00a03d). When the rotating Hr(t) was substituted with a precessing Hw(t), the pH-RPNRs\ncould also form into swarms while collectively moving in a \"walking\" mode. However, the formed swarms were relatively small in size (S = ~ 0.28 mm2) due to the weaker\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01095-5\u00a9 The authors\nproduced flow field, as compared to those formed under the Hr(t) with other conditions unchanged (S = ~ 0.78 mm2), as shown in Fig. S5 and Video S5.\nThe pH-RPNRs can also swarm in a confined microchannel (Fig.\u00a03e). When an Hr(t) (H0 = 25 mT and f = 2\u00a0Hz) was applied, the pH-RPNRs in the left pool were activated and moved forward to the inlet of a narrow canal. In this process, the pH-RPNRs near the pool wall would move along it and then funnel into the open end of the narrow canal. As a result, they were condensed into a ribbon-like microswarm to fit through the narrow canal, revealing their exceptional environmental adaptability. Interestingly, the ribbon-like microswarm can traverse a 5\u00a0mm-long canal within 39.1\u00a0s, suggesting that it has a U of 127.9\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121, which is much higher than the maximum U of those in open spaces with any S (82.9\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121 at f = 2\u00a0Hz) (0\u201339.1\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a03f and Video S6). This phenomenon can be rationalized by the fact that the microswarm can be regarded as a liquid stream, and its U fulfills the equation evaluating the flow velocity (u, corresponding to U) at the channel\u2019s entry and exit when the volumetric flow rates are assumed identical [65], u = Q\u2215A , where Q is the volumetric flow rate in the channel, and A is the cross-sectional area of the channel. Therefore, the decrease in A will result in an increase in u, corresponding to the increased U when the liquid-like microswarm flows from a large open pool into the narrow canal. Additionally, after fleeing through the narrow exit, the microswarm immediately expands to cover the other open pool on the right in a brief amount of time (39.1\u201355.1\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a03f and Video S6). This quick covering behavior may facilitate rapid deployment of the pH-RPNRs over a sizable area to acquire pH information there.\nSimilar to the single pH-RPNRs, swarming pH-RPNRs also show different structural colors in response to pH changes. Because of the increased concentration, we are able to directly measure the reflection spectra of swarming pH-RPNRs with a high wavelength resolution. When the pH of the aqueous medium with suspended pH-RPNRs increases from 4.0 to 7.4, the diffraction peak ( max) of the pH-RPNRs changes from 476 to 627\u00a0nm, corresponding to a diffraction-peak shift of up to 151\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a03g). This large shift in diffraction peaks indicates that the pH-RPNRs can change their structural colors over a wide range. As shown in Fig.\u00a03h, their structural color can vary from dark blue to bright red with the pH changes, almost covering the whole visible spectrum. More than that, each bright dot in Fig.\u00a03h\nrepresents a pH-RPNR reorientated perpendicular to the imaging planes, and different pH-RPNRs respond to local pH independently, which means that swarming pH-RPNRs can be used to perform microenvironmental pH-mapping tasks in high spatial resolution (~ 200\u00a0nm).\nBy adjusting the crosslinking degree of the pH-RPNRs, the color-change range and max-shifting range ( \u0394 max ) can be modulated. When the crosslinking degree of the pHRPNRs increases from 3 to 6%, the \u0394 max decreases from 122 to 30\u00a0nm in a pH range from 3.6 to 6.0, respectively (Fig. S6). This is because an increase in crosslinking degree makes the pH-RPNR stiffer and less sensitive to pH changes. Although pH-RPNRs require a static magnetic field to regulate the orientation for diffracting bright structural colors, the strength of the magnetic field showed no influence on their structural color (Fig. S7). These results indicate that the pH-RPNRs have a reliable and high-resolution pH-sensing capability."

            "text": "Benefitting from their collective motions and pH-responsive structural colors, swarming pH-RPNRs are envisioned to be navigated to perform targeted on-the-fly pH sensing and mapping toward a specific target. The targeted on-the-fly pH mapping was investigated in a microfluidic chip with two open pools connected by a narrow canal, in which a piece of low-pH agar gel was placed in the right pool as the target (Fig.\u00a04a). When actuated by the Hr(t) (H0 = 25 mT and f = 2\u00a0Hz), swarming pH-RPNRs in the left pool passed through the narrow canal and moved toward the target (pH 4.4 agar gel) (Fig.\u00a04b and Video S7). Before reaching the right pool, the swarming pH-RPNRs exhibited a bright red structural color, reflecting the pH of the aqueous medium (pH 7.4 buffer) (0\u201357.2\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04b). Once reaching the right pool, the pH-RPNRs at the front of the microswarms changed their structural color from red to green when they were about 750\u00a0\u03bcm away from the targeted agar gel (66.1\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04b). This is because of the continuous diffusion of H+ out of the agar gel. When the swarming pH-RPNRs finally reached the targeted agar gel and covered the space around it, a clear pH map is immediately depicted (93.7\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04b), in which the region near the targeted agar has a pH of 4.5 (in green color) and that away from it is 7.4 (in red color), and a pH gradient between these two regions is\n1 3\nclearly observed in the color-transition band (the inset in Fig.\u00a04b at 93.7\u00a0s). This pH map agrees well with the simulated result based on H+ diffusion (Fig.\u00a04c). It is important to note that the pH-RPNR microswarm is analogous to a fluid jet that can push the diffused H+ backward, thereby reversing the diffusion of H+ (Fig.\u00a04c). This anti-diffusion effect can be verified by the fact that the pH-RPNRs at a fixed position (white circles in Fig.\u00a04b at 66.1 and 93.7\u00a0s) in the right pool experience color changes from green to red (i.e., pH increase) as the pH-RPNRs continuously flow rightward, and also that the green-color front of the swarming pH-RPNRs rapidly propagates leftward (corresponding to the diffusion direction of H+) when they were stopped\n(Fig. S8 and Video S7). This result suggests that swarming pH-RPNRs may act as a self-reporting micropump.\nFurthermore, more challenging testing conditions were established to assess the robustness of the targeted on-thefly pH mapping capability. The experiment was conducted by placing two agar gels with significant pH differences in the right pool (Fig.\u00a04d) but keeping other conditions the same as those shown in Fig.\u00a04b. At first, similar collective motions toward the targets and structural color-based pH mapping behaviors near the pH 4.4 agar were observed for the swarming pH-RPNRs (0\u2013199.8\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04e). Astonishingly, two agar targets with different pH of 4.4 and 7.4 were perfectly distinguished by the respective distinct green and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01095-5\u00a9 The authors\nred structural colors of the pH-RPNRs around each target. The pH gradient in the space between the two agars was visualized by a red-yellow-green color-transition band (262.0\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04e and Video S8), agreeing well with the simulated pH map (Fig.\u00a04f). These results further verify the robust targeted on-the-fly pH mapping capability of the swarming pH-RPNRs.\nDue to the magnetic field-navigated collective motions and bright pH-responsive structural colors, the pH-RPNRs can swarm at the macroscopic level along a tortuous route and realize targeted on-the-fly pH mapping, even detectable by the naked eye (Fig.\u00a04g and Video S9). When navigated by an Hr(t), the swarming pH-RPNRs can travel in a tortuous canal with multiple turns, and successfully arrive at the right pool with a target of a pH 4.4 agar gel (Fig.\u00a04g). Once approaching the target, they detected the pH changes there and changed their structural color from light red to light green in response, with which the pH near the target can be directly read out by the naked eye (315\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04g). Although their structural color is not as bright as that under the dark-field macroscopic condition due to the reduced contrast as a result of the diffuse reflection of ambient light, it still has a distinct pH-dependent appearance and exhibits a similar experimental outcome as depicted in Fig.\u00a04b. This suggests that the swarming pH-RPNRs developed here may largely alleviate instrumental requirements in sensing compared to the developed single sensing MNRs.\nThe microscopic and macroscopic sensing performance indicates that the swarming pH-RPNRs can actively patrol in complex environments utilizing their navigatable collective motions and then identify unknown targets by mapping local abnormal pH conditions via responsive structural colors. In contrast, the immotile nanosensors (e.g., passive fluorescent nanoprobes) cannot achieve motile-targeting sensing. On the other hand, the previously reported motile micro/nanosensors are mainly based on chemically-propelled MNRs with random motions and additional (toxic) fuels, and can only generate analytical signals (e.g., speed and fluorescence changes) after irreversibly binding with analytes. Thus, they show low targetability, poor biocompatibility, chemical-fuel interference, and poor reversibility (one-time use only) [38, 39]. More importantly, they have no swarming navigation control and can only perform sensing at a single-robot level, suffering from limited area-covering mapping capability, indirect readout (sophisticated analytical instruments), and poor reproducibility (individual differences)."

For example, when the monomers of AA and HEA were substituted with NIPAM and NHMA, temperature-responsive photonic nanorobots (T-RPNRs) composed of Fe3O4 NPs and poly(NIPAM-co-NHMA) hydrogel can be obtained. Similar to the pH-RPNRs (Fig. S1e), the T-RPNRs also have a core\u2013shell nanochain structure but with a much thinner hydrogel shell (~3\u00a0nm, Figs.\u00a05a and S9a, b). With the increasing temperature from 38 to 45\u00a0\u00b0C, the diffraction peak max of the T-RPNRs changes from 627 to 553\u00a0nm (Fig. S9c), corresponding to the structural color change from red to green (Fig. S9d). When actuated by an Hr(t), the T-RPNRs could collectively move toward a heat source (i.e., a heating rod) and detect the temperature there (Fig.\u00a05b).

As a response, the red T-RPNRs near the heating source changed their structural color to green due to the shrinkage of the hydrogel shell with its phase transition at a high temperature [19, 66, 67], visualizing the local temperature change and distribution (Fig.\u00a05c and Video S10).\nSimilarly, when the monomers of AAPBA and HEAA were used in the preparation, the glucose-responsive photonic nanorobots (G-RPNRs) consisting of a Fe3O4 nanochain enveloped in a poly(AAPBA-co-HEAA) hydrogel shell are generated (Figs.\u00a05d and S10a, b). When the glucose concentration CGlu increases from 0 to 50\u00a0mM, the diffraction peak max of the G-RPNRs changes from 494 to 608\u00a0nm (Fig. S10c), and their structural color changes from green to red (Fig. S10d). When actuated by an Hr(t), they can perform targeted on-the-fly mapping toward a local glucose source in a microfluidic channel (Fig.\u00a05e). As shown in Fig.\u00a05f and Video S11, the swarming G-RPNRs leave from one end of the channel and reach the target area (a piece of agar gel loaded with 50\u00a0mM glucose) within 90\u00a0s. When perceiving glucose molecules by forming a charged complex with AAPBA in the hydrogel shell [20], the G-RPNRs, as the hydrogel shell expands, gradually shift their structural color from green to orange, mapping the local distribution of glucose. These results indicate the versatility of the swarming\n1 3\nRPNRs to detect and map different physicochemical conditions in microenvironments, such as pH, temperature, and glucose concentration."

            "text": "Photothermal treatment (PTT), which employs photosensitizers to induce local hyperthermia by converting light energy into heat, has been considered as a promising treatment for many diseases due to its unique advantages, such as excellent selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and limited side effects [68]. To investigate the potential of swarming RPNRs in PTT, the pH-RPNRs were selected as an example, and their photothermal effect was tested at first. Owing to the photothermal conversion of the Fe3O4 component [56], when exposed to a NIR laser with a power density (I) of 2.0\nW cm\u22122, the aqueous suspension of the pH-RPNRs (concentration Cn, 5\u00a0mg\u00a0 mL\u22121) could be quickly heated up to ~ 60\u00a0\u00b0C within 300\u00a0s, as verified by the time-lapse thermal images shown in Fig.\u00a06a. This temperature is 35 and 15\u00a0\u00b0C higher than the room temperature and the temperature required for PTT (42\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C) [69], respectively. The photothermal heating curves of the aqueous medium with the pH-RPNRs (Cn = 5.00\u00a0mg\u00a0 mL\u22121) at a different I are shown in Fig.\u00a06b. It can be seen that the temperature of the aqueous medium increases with the irradiation time at any I, and becomes stable after around 250\u00a0s. The maximum temperature (Tm) was found to be decreasing from 57.1, 50.3, 40.3 to 33.3\u00a0\u00b0C with the decreasing I from 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 to 0.5 W cm\u22122, respectively. Similarly, the aqueous medium with different Cn also reaches a Tm after 250\u00a0s NIR irradiation (I = 2.0 W cm\u22122), and the Tm is 57.1, 43.7, and 39.8\u00a0\u00b0C when Cn decreased\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01095-5\u00a9 The authors\nfrom 5.00, 2.50 to 1.25\u00a0mg\u00a0 mL\u22121, respectively, as demonstrated in Fig.\u00a06c. The optimal conditions for the pH-RPNRs to perform PTT are found to be at a Cn of 2.50\u00a0mg\u00a0 mL\u22121 and an I of 2.0 W cm\u22122 as their Tm (43.7\u00a0\u00b0C) is in the PTT temperature range (42\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C) [69].\nIn addition to investigating the photothermal effect, the biocompatibility of pH-RPNRs has also been studied. A dose-dependent cytotoxicity test showed that MCF-7 cells had a high survival rate of close to 100% after incubation with pH-RPNRs of different Cn (0\u20132\u00a0mg\u00a0 mL\u22121) for 24\u00a0h,\nindicating their non-cytotoxicity (Fig. S11). Furthermore, when pH-RPNRs were suspended in a PBS buffer containing 10% FBS for 24 and 48\u00a0h, no agglomerations, morphology changes, or significant zeta potential variations were observed, suggesting their high stability in the biological medium (Fig. S12a-c). Additionally, hemolysis evaluation showed that pH-RPNRs exhibited a low hemolysis rate of 1.0% and 2.9% at Cn of 2.5 and 5\u00a0mg mL\u22121, respectively, suggesting that they have a negligible influence on the damage of red blood cells (Fig. S12d). The high biocompatibility\n1 3\nof pH-RPNRs may be attributed to their low chemical toxicity, soft hydrogel surface, and strong electrostatic repulsion to cells [70\u201372].\nConsidering the low pH of tumor microenvironment (5.8\u20137.2) [6], as well as multiple integrated functions of biocompatible swarming pH-RPNRs including magnetic propulsion, visual pH mapping, and photothermal conversion, they are envisioned to realize motile-targeting mapping-guided photothermal treatment. Specifically, they may rapidly move toward and cover a target area under magnetic propulsion, then label a low-pH tumor lesion via visual mapping, and further guide the external NIR irradiation to achieve localized photothermal treatment on demand. To verify this prediction, we used MCF-7 cells grown on a glass slide with a pH of 6.5 as the simulated tumor lesion, and the MCF-7 cells were put in the right pool of a microfluidic channel to serve as an unknown target (Fig.\u00a06d). As shown in Fig.\u00a06e and Video S12, the swarming pH-RPNRs in the left pool can move toward and cover the target area (right pool) after passing through a narrow canal under the Hr(t) (0\u201362\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a06e). After covering the target area, the structural color of pH-RPNRs shifted from red to orange due to the low pH there. Even though no tumor cells could be directly observed under dark-field microscopy, the simulated tumor site was recognized based on the translation of the local pH condition to visual optical signals (119\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a06e). When receiving this visual orange signal, a beam of NIR light was locally applied to activate the photothermal conversion of the swarming pH-RPNRs to kill the tumor cells (MCF-7 cells) (157\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a06e).\nAfter the PTT treatment for 5\u00a0min, all MCF-7 cells were dead (cell death rate, ~ 100%), as confirmed by the fluorescent microscopic images of dead (red) and alive (green) MCF-7 cells (Fig.\u00a06f). In contrast, no cell death was observed in the control group (without pH-RPNRs and NIR irradiation) and the pH-RPNRs-only group, and the cell death rate in the NIR-only group is low as 14.6%, indicating that NIR irradiation alone has a minimal capacity to cause tumor-cell apoptosis. These results indicate that the tumor-cell apoptosis is mainly induced by the photothermal heating of the pH-RPNRs. Besides the low-pH condition, temperature and glucose levels around tumor sites are also different from those of normal tissues, and can also be exploited as physiological indicators of the tumor microenvironment [2]. Thus, the swarming RPNRs with temperature or glucose responsiveness (Fig.\u00a05) also have great potential in motile-targeting\nmapping-guided photothermal tumor treatment because of their integrated functions of the targeted on-the-fly temperature/glucose mapping and photothermal conversion.\nCompared to the reported magnetic MNRs [24, 46], the swarming RPNRs have a periodic arrangement in structures and show intelligent responses to surrounding physicochemical changes, thereby enabling emerging applications in (bio) sensing and disease treatment. In (bio)sensing, the swarming RPNRs provide a robust active motile-targeting strategy for microenvironmental mapping because they can actively navigate in complex environments and collectively map out local abnormal physicochemical conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, or glucose concentration) on the fly via their bright responsive structural colors. Through swarming behaviors, the RPNRs have built linkages between nano-, micro-, and macro-sensing, with which they have a high spatial resolution at the individual level, and show high fault tolerance, rapid large-area mapping, and even naked-eye detectable structural colors at the swarm level. The visual mapping signals (structural colors) of the RPNRs are in the visiblelight range. Thus, they can be directly used in in-vitro microfluidic analytical devices and in-vivo transparent or endoscopically accessible organs (e.g., eyeball, lung, esophagus, gastrointestinal tract, and bladder) [73, 74]. In addition, their responsive deformations and adjustable interparticle distances may also alter the signal from deep-penetration imaging technologies, such as ultrasound imaging (USI), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, they may also generate responsive USI, CT, and MRI signals when perceiving abnormal physicochemical conditions, realizing motile-targeting microenvironmental mapping in deep tissues [75, 76].\nIn the photothermal treatment, different from traditional immotile photothermal nanoagents [68], the developed swarming RPNRs can actively find and visualize an unknown tumor lesion via motile-targeting mapping to guide the external NIR light to initiate localized photothermal treatment. As the visual color-mapping signals of the swarming RPNRs can be captured and tracked by the external imaging apparatus, an automatic theranostic nanorobot system is expected to be realized in the future by developing computer programs to coordinate imaging apparatus, artificial intelligence navigation planners, magnetic-field generators, and external NIR source in the future [77]. On the other hand, due to the drug loading capacity of the hydrogel shell via different interactions (e.g., electrostatic, hydrophobic,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01095-5\u00a9 The authors\nand hydrogen-bond interactions), as well as their responsive drug release in response to local pH, temperature, or glucose concentration [4], the additional function of stimulus-triggered drug delivery may also be integrated to the RPNRs, enabling them to act as an intelligent multifunctional motile theranostic platform. For future in-vivo applications, the swarming RPNRs could be administered via various routes, such as topical, oral, intralesional, inhalation, or instillation administration. After administration, the nanorobots can be collected near the targeted area using a permanent magnet and then actuated to patrol that area under alternating magnetic fields. In case a superficial tumor site is detected via the microenvironmental mapping, the swarming RPNRs can be activated to penetrate the tumor tissue through narrow interstitial spaces for subsequent photothermal treatment. Alternatively, if no tumor is detected, they can be navigated to patrol other regions of interest."

            "text": "In summary, we have demonstrated that swarming RPNRs consisting of a nanochain of periodically arranged Fe3O4 NPs encapsulated in a responsive hydrogel shell can actively navigate in complex environments, visualize unknown targets on the fly, and guide localized photothermal treatment. The experimental results show that the swarming RPNRs show energetic collective motions with a maximum collective velocity of 127.9\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0 s\u22121 when navigated by a rotating Hr(t), have a wide structural colorshift range of about ~ 150\u00a0nm (from dark blue to bright red), and can reach the PPT temperature (~ 45\u00a0\u00b0C) within 300\u00a0s under NIR irradiation. They have been confirmed to actively pass through a narrow microchannel to rapidly cover a targeted microenvironment, then visualize unknown targets (e.g., tumor lesion) by mapping the abnormal condition (e.g., pH, temperature, or glucose concentration) there via their responsive structural colors, and finally induce tumor cell apoptosis on demand via mapping-guided localized photothermal treatment.
