    "abstractText": "In order to optimize elevated kidney retention of previously reported minigastrin derivatives, we substituted (R)-DOTAGA by DOTA in (R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-16/-18. CCK-2R-mediated internalization and affinity of the new compounds were determined using AR42J cells. Biodistribution and \u03bcSPECT/CT imaging studies at 1 and 24 h p.i. were carried out in AR42J tumor-bearing CB17-SCID mice. Both DOTA-containing minigastrin analogs exhibited 3to 5-fold better IC50 values than their (R)-DOTAGA-counterparts. natLu-labeled peptides revealed higher CCK-2R affinity than their natGa-labeled analogs. In vivo, tumor uptake at 24 h p.i. of the most affine compound, [19F]F[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18, was 1.5and 13-fold higher compared to its (R)-DOTAGA derivative and the reference compound, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N, respectively. However, activity levels in the kidneys were elevated as well. At 1 h p.i., tumor and kidney accumulation of [19F]F-[177Lu]Lu-DOTArhCCK-18 and [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 was high. We could demonstrate that the choice of chelators and radiometals has a significant impact on CCK-2R affinity and thus tumor uptake of minigastrin analogs. While elevated kidney retention of [19F]F-[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 has to be further addressed with regard to radioligand therapy, its radiohybrid analog, [18F]F-[natLu]LuDOTA-rhCCK-18, might be ideal for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging due to its high tumor accumulation at 1 h p.i. and the attractive physical properties of fluorine-18.",

            "text": "In 2022, an estimated number of 43,800 new thyroid cancer cases will occur in the United States [1]. Out of these, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) comprises only 2\u20133% and thus rarely occurs. However, due to comparably late tumor detection in advanced stages and limited treatment options of this disease, the 5- and 10-year survival of MTC (65\u201389% and 71\u201387%, respectively) is lower compared to that of the more common types of differentiated thyroid cancer [2,3]. The 10-year survival rate for patients developing metastatic MTC is only 10%, which underlines the importance of an early diagnosis as well as novel therapeutic options [4]. In contrast to conventional diagnostic methodologies, nuclear medicine provides an opportunity to exhibit biochemical information through non-invasive molecular imaging applications. Amongst other uses, this allows for the localization of tumor lesions and metastases because most malignant cells overexpress certain target structures that can be addressed by radiopharmaceutical drugs. In the case of MTC, over 90% of tumors overexpress the cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK-2R) in high density [5]. In spite of this characteristic, the gold standard for MTC imaging is 18F-based positron emission tomography (PET) using\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 826. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030826 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 826 2 of 14\n[18F]F-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine) instead of a CCK-2R-targeted compound [6]. This can be attributed to the lack of an efficient 18F-labeled CCK-2R-targeted compound, which could combine the favorable properties of fluorine-18 and PET alongside targeting the CCK-2R, as well as the fact that [18F]F-DOPA is already clinically established for neuroimaging [7\u20139]. Because [18F]F-DOPA is trapped in neuroendocrine tumor cells such as MTC due to the availability of an excess of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in these cells [7,10,11], a sensitivity of 86% was observed for primary MTC [12]. However, only moderate sensitivity was determined for [18F]F-DOPA-PET in both lymph node metastases and distant metastases [10,13]. In 2021, Khan et al. reported the first attempts to introduce scaffolds into the peptide structure of the CCK-2R-targeting minigastrin analog MG11 (glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-MetAsp-Phe-NH2) that enables direct radiofluorination via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of a nitro group by [18F]fluoride (K2CO3, kryptofix 2.2.2, azeotropic drying). However, rapid de-fluorination due to the poor chemical stability of these compounds was observed, which illustrates the need for optimized alternatives [14]. In addition, the earlier studies of Good et al. demonstrated a poor metabolic stability for MG11 in vivo [15,16], aggravating the use of this basic structure as a scaffold for radiopharmaceuticals, which is why alternative strategies are desired. In a previous study, we addressed this topic by introducing a silicon-based fluoride acceptor (SiFA) moiety into the peptide structure of DOTA-PP-F11N, a minigastrin analog that is currently in clinical trials. However, one of the biggest limitations of [177Lu]LuDOTA-PP-F11N represents its high hydrophilicity and thus fast clearance kinetics [17]. In contrast, the introduction of the SiFA building block enables facile 18F-labeling via an isotopic exchange reaction, which is chemically stable [18]. Conversly, the highly lipophilic SiFA moiety compensates for the high hydrophilic character of the peptide. The presence of a SiFA and a chelator moiety within the same molecule allows for either 18F- or 177Lu-labeling generating chemically identical agents, which are called radiohybrids (rh). Previous rhCCK derivatives, [19F]F-[177Lu-]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-9 and -16, revealed 3- to 8-fold increased activity levels in the tumor compared to [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N at 24 h p.i., respectively, despite a noticeably lower CCK-2R affinity. Nevertheless, activity uptake and retention in the kidneys was substantially elevated, which was likely due to the numerous negative charges in proximity to the SiFA moiety [19]. Hence, in this study, we wanted to maintain high activity levels in the tumor while reducing elevated kidney retention. Because we aimed to retain the peptide structure (H-(\u03b3-glu)6\u20138-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2), we only substituted (R)-DOTAGA (2- (4,7,10-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1-6yl)pentanedioic acid) by the DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10- tetraacetic acid) chelator to reduce the negative charge distribution in the direct neighborhood to the SiFA moiety. The resulting analogs (Figure 1) were evaluated by state-of-the-art experiments (IC50, logD7.4, receptormediated internalization, biodistribution and imaging studies).\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 826 3 of 14Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\n2.

In rec nt studies, we thus introduced a silicon-based fluoride acceptor (SiFA) moiety into the D-glutamate chain of DOTA-PP-F11N. The r sulting radiohybr d (rh)-based comounds enable labeling with both fluorine-18 and radiometals such as lutetium-177 due to the presence of a ch lator and a SiFA moiety. We could show that these rhCCK ligands, for example [nat/177Lu]Lu-(R)-DOTAG -rhCCK-16, revealed up to 8-f ld increased activity levels i the tumor but also approximately 30-fold higher levels in the kidney when compared\n[nat/177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N, despite its distinctly ower CCK-2R affinity [19]. While we assume th t the elevated tumor uptake and retention is due to a decelerated clearance of the compo nd, the charge distribution within the link r s ction and thus in proximity to the SiFA moiety likely causes the increased kidney values. Hence, the aim of this study was to retain favorable tumor values while reducing the activity levels in the kidneys. Therefore, (R)-DOTAGA was substituted by a DOTA chelator in two rhCCK derivatives to reduce the negative charges within the linker section and maintain the peptide sequence to retain high CCK-2R affinity.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 826 9 of 14\nInterestingly, substitution of (R)-DOTAGA by DOTA in the most affine rhCCK derivatives from previous studies, [natLu]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-16 and -18, resulted in 3- to 4-fold lower IC50 values for the DOTA-comprising analogs, surpassing even the highly affine reference compound, [natLu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N (Figure 2). It is thus anticipated that the additional free carboxylic group of the (R)-DOTAGA chelator at the respective site has a negative impact on the overall CCK-2R affinity. Similar observations were made for the natGa-labeled rhCCK ligands because the additional free carboxylic group at the Ga-(R)-DOTAGA chelate compared to the respective Ga-DOTA chelate as well as the additional free carboxylic group of the Ga-DOTA compared to the respective Lu-DOTA chelate [25\u201327] led to a decreased overall CCK-2R affinity (Figure 2). Stability studies in human serum did not reveal a lower stability for the [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-rhCCK-16 or -18 as compared to their 177Lu-labeled analogs, which can be thus excluded as a potential reason for the decreased CCK-2R affinity of the natGa-labeled compounds. Interestingly, the stability studies in human serum showed the formation of a slightly more hydrophilic analog (\u2206tR ~ 2 min) for all four compounds tested (Figure S18). This was attributed to their corresponding SiOH-containing derivatives, and we suggest that the SiFA building block is hydrolyzed over time under these conditions. In order to confirm this assumption, we performed RP-HPLC analysis of the natGa/natLu-labeled SiOH-containing analogs, which were generated by treatment with sodium hydroxide. All four SiOH-containing analogs (peptide identity confirmed by ESI-MS) revealed the same retention time as their respective 67Ga/177Lu-labeled derivative, which was observed after incubation in human serum. Because the SiFA- and their respective SiOH-containing ligands only differ by the atom/group bound to the silicon atom, but the remaining compound is identical, we do not consider this a metabolite but rather an intact compound. Further studies have to be conducted to elucidate whether the SiFA moiety is also hydrolyzed in vivo. In addition to a lower CCK-2R affinity, all 177Lu-labeled (R)-DOTAGA-comprising compounds showed higher logD7.4 values than their DOTA-containing analogs (Table 1). Because it was assumed that the negatively charged 177Lu-(R)-DOTAGA chelates should be more hydrophilic than the neutral 177Lu-DOTA chelates, further investigations are necessary to understand this dedicated structure\u2013activity relationship. Furthermore, the increased CCK-2R affinity was paralleled by an improved receptor-mediated internalization because both [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-16 and -18 exhibited the highest internalization values at all time points. While the slope of the internalization curves of most compounds decreases after the first hours (Figure 3a), the curve of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 seems to rise with an almost unaffected slope up to the end of the experiment at 6 h. Thus, although this compound initially shows a decelerated internalization rate, its continuous cellular uptake might result in a noticeably higher overall uptake at later time points when compared with the other ligands of this series. Worth mentioning, both [177Lu]Lu-(R)DOTAGA-rhCCK-16 and -18 showed significantly higher internalization values at all time points than [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N despite their significantly lower CCK-2R affinity, which points to a beneficial impact of the SiFA moiety on internalization kinetics. In vivo, [nat/177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 revealed a 1.5 and 13-fold increased activity uptake in the tumor (25.4 \u00b1 4.7 %ID/g, Figure 4) at 24 h p.i., as compared to the previously published compound, [177Lu]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-16 (15.7 \u00b1 3.3 %ID/g), and the parent peptide, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N (1.9 \u00b1 0.8 %ID/g), respectively, which can be attributed to its significantly higher CCK-2R affinity and internalization [19]. Consequently, tumor-to-background ratios were higher for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 compared to the previously published compounds (Table S5). Tumor specificity was demonstrated by competition studies using excess of the CCK-2R-specific compound, [natLu]Lu-DOTAMGS5 [28], which led to tumor and stomach values <2 %ID/g. Moreover, the high tumor values obtained for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 demonstrated that the low tumor values for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N were not caused by an excessive amount of substance (100 pmol per animal) for such a high-affinity ligand.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 826 10 of 14\nSimilar to previously published rhCCK derivatives [19], tumor and kidney uptake for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 was high at 1 h p.i. and remained high at 24 h p.i. Elevated tumor and stomach retention can be attributed to the decelerated clearance kinetics (higher logD7.4 and albumin binding) of the rhCCK ligands and their prolonged bioavailability, the increased kidney retention is likely caused by a synergistic effect of the negatively charged side chains in proximity of the SiFA building block. This assumption is supported by the fact that [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N contains a similar number of negative charges but no SiFA moiety and does not show an enhanced kidney retention. Recent reports demonstrated that SiFA-comprising PSMA inhibitors show a higher albumin binding and thus decelerated clearance kinetics, which results in increased tumor uptake, but also increased kidney retention [21,29], which correlated well with our observations because [177Lu]LuDOTA-rhCCK-18 also exhibited an elevated albumin binding in vitro. Furthermore, it was shown that negative charges in the direct neighborhood to the SiFA moiety cause a higher albumin binding and stronger kidney retention, which could explain our results because the rhCCK derivatives contain several negative charges in proximity to the SiFA group. As the substitution of a (R)-DOTAGA by a DOTA moiety did not result in lower kidney retention, it is assumed that most of the negatively charged \u03b3-D-glutamic acid moieties have to be removed in future studies to prevent an elevated kidney uptake and retention. In addition, it will be interesting to see whether the impact of these negative charges of radiohybrid and other CCK-2R ligands on the kidney retention will be confirmed by the first comparative studies in humans. Nevertheless, even in the case that such behavior would be confirmed in human studies, unfavorable kidney uptake of [19F]F-[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 does not necessarily prevent its use for PET imaging with the corresponding 18F-radiohybrid. When 18F-labeled, and taking into account the short half-life of fluorine-18, an elevated kidney accumulation will not result in an unacceptable dosimetry. Similar kidney uptake is, for example, also observed for commonly applied PSMA inhibitors [30\u201333]. Despite this minor disadvantage, [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 seems to have great potential for the detection of even small and distant metastases in MTC patients due to the unique properties of 18F-PET and the high overexpression of the CCK-2R on these cancer cells. In order to confirm the expected favorable pharmacokinetics of the chemically identical [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18, we carried out a \u00b5PET/CT image (n = 1, Figure 5), which revealed similarly high activity levels in the tumor and kidneys compared to [19F]F[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18. Moreover, bone uptake was observed to be low (1.69 %ID/g) for [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18, underlining the high metabolic stability of the Si-18F bond. Therefore, the formation of the SiOH-containing analog observed in stability studies in human serum does not seem to occur in vivo, at least not within the first hours after injection, and should therefore not be of concern for PET imaging using this compound. However, stability of this compound (particularly of the Si-F bond) in men must be investigated to confirm this assumption. Due to these results, particularly its high tumor accumulation at 1 h p.i., [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 could surpass the detection rate of currently applied CCK-2R-targeted compounds such as [111In]In-CP04 or [68Ga]GaDOTA-MGS5 [9,28,34,35] and might even compete with the current gold standard for MTC imaging, [18F]F-DOPA, i.e., for the detection of distant metastases. 18F-labeling was carried out via an isotopic exchange reaction by a novel labeling strategy, which led to molar activities of ~85 GBq/\u00b5mol in a total synthesis time of ~30 min. Unlike the Munich Method [36], this strategy includes the use of ammonium formiate (in anhydrous DMSO) instead of [K+\u22822.2.2]OH\u2212 (in anhydrous MeCN) for the elution of dry [18F]fluoride from a SEP-Pak\u00ae Light (46 mg) Accell Plus QMA cartridge (Waters GmbH, Eschborn, Germany), which enables a less time-consuming preparation and more cost efficient 18F-fluorination method. In comparison to conventional radiofluorination techniques [37], no azeotropic drying steps must be conducted. Furthermore, anhydrous DMSO is used as the reaction solvent, which is beneficial for the 18F-labeling of CCK-2Rtargeting peptides.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 826 11 of 14\nIn summary, we could demonstrate a significantly higher CCK-2R affinity and thus enhanced tumor accumulation by exchanging the chelator moiety in previously published rhCCK derivatives from (R)-DOTAGA to DOTA. Nevertheless, elevated kidney retention of rhCCK derivatives could not be reduced in this study, which must be addressed in future studies by extinguishing most of the negatively charged residues within the SiFA-containing linker section. Despite increased kidney uptake, [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 holds great promise as an imaging agent and is expected to be highly competitive to currently applied radiotracers for PET imaging of medullary thyroid carcinoma."

Nevertheless, due to its very high tumor accumulation at already 1 h p.i., the chemically identical [18F]F-[natLu]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 might compete with or even surpass the detection rate of currently applied imaging agents for MTC such as 68Ga- or 111Inlabeled CCK-2R or SSTR2-targeted compounds and [18F]F-DOPA, which is why a clinical translation of this compound for MTC imaging is recommended.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030826/s1, general information and characterization of all CCK2R-targeted compounds, detailed description of cell-based experiments.
