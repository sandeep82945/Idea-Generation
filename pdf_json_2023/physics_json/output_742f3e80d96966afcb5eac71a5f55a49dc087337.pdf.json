            "text": "During oogenesis and early embryogenesis, maternally deposited mRNAs and proteins determine the developmental program in many animals. Over this period of time, the genome is transcriptionally silent, and the expression of genes is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the modulation of mRNA translation, localization, and stability (Lasko, 2011; Lazzaretti & Bono, 2017; Schoenberg & Maquat, 2012). Regulated mRNAs often carry specific cis-elements which are recognized by transacting RNA-binding proteins or microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate a transcript\u2019s fate (Fabian & Sonenberg, 2012; Lee et al, 2020).\nDrosophila Smaug and its metazoan orthologs comprise a family of mRNA\nrepressor proteins that contain a characteristic sterile-a motif (SAM) domain, two\n'Smaug similarity regions' SSR1 and SSR2 within their N-terminal segment, and a pseudo-HEAT-repeat analogous topology (PHAT) domain C-terminally to the SAM domain (Figure 1A). The SAM domain is one of the most abundant protein-protein interaction domains (Thanos et al, 1999; Schultz et al, 1997; Qiao & Bowie, 2005). In Smaug orthologs, however, it serves as RNA binding domain and recognizes mRNA targets through binding to defined stem-loop structures, designated 'Smaug recognition elements' (SREs). (Amadei et al, 2015; Aviv et al, 2003; Baez & Boccaccio, 2005; Green et al, 2003; Niu et al, 2017; Johnson & Donaldson, 2006; Aviv et al, 2006; Oberstrass et al, 2006). The SSR2 appears limited to metazoan Smaug orthologs, while the SSR1 is present also in various other proteins, including F-box proteins, and was shown to form homodimers (Tang et al, 2007). The functions of the SSR2 and the PHAT domain remained unclear.\nIn animals, members of the Smaug protein family exhibit various functions\nduring development. Mammals express two Smaug-related paralogs named SAM-\ndomain-containing protein 4A (SAMD4A, a.k.a. Smaug1) and SAMD4B (a.k.a. Smaug2). A SAMD4A mis-sense mutation in mice causes a lean phenotype and these animals develop kyphosis associated with myopathy and adipocyte defects, and show delayed bone development and decreased osteogenesis (Chen et al, 2014b; Niu et al, 2017). Mouse SAMD4B, but not SAMD4A, is present in neuronal precursors of mouse embryos and inhibits neurogenesis in the embryonic cortex (Amadei et al, 2015).\nDrosophila Smaug mediates translation inhibition and degradation of bulk\nnanos mRNA in the early Drosophila embryo, a critical step during embryonic patterning (Dahanukar & Wharton, 1996; Dahanukar et al, 1999; Smibert et al, 1996). Smaug mediates its effects by recruiting the eIF4E-binding translation inhibitor Cup and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex (G\u00f6tze et al, 2017; Jeske et al, 2011; Nelson et al, 2004; Semotok et al, 2005; Zaessinger et al, 2006; Pekovic et al, 2022). Several other RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in Smaug-mediated repression of nanos mRNA, including Argonaute 1 (Ago1), Trailer Hitch (Tral), and the DEAD-box RNA helicases 'Maternal expression at 31B' (Me31B; ortholog of human DDX6) and Belle (ortholog of human DDX3X/DDX3Y) (G\u00f6tze et al, 2017; Pinder & Smibert, 2013).\nAt the posterior pole of the Drosophila embryo, a small fraction of localized\nnanos mRNA escapes Smaug-mediated repression through the activity of Oskar protein (Dahanukar & Wharton, 1996; Dahanukar et al, 1999; Jeske et al, 2011; Zaessinger et al, 2006). Restriction of Nanos synthesis to the posterior pole gives rise to a Nanos protein gradient that determines the position of abdominal structures in the early embryo (Wang & Lehmann, 1991; Wang et al, 1994; Gavis & Lehmann, 1992, 1994). Genetic data revealed that Smaug overexpression antagonizes the Oskardependent activation of nanos mRNA in embryos (Dahanukar et al, 1999). Translation\nderepression of nanos mRNA can be recapitulated in vitro by addition of recombinant Oskar protein to a cell-free system that is active in both the translation repression and deadenylation of a nanos 3' UTR-containing reporter mRNA (Jeske et al, 2011). Furthermore, pull-down experiments using lysates prepared from early Drosophila embryos demonstrated that in the presence of Oskar, Smaug is unable to bind to nanos mRNA (Jeske et al, 2011; Zaessinger et al, 2006). Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the Oskar-dependent derepression of nanos mRNA at the posterior pole of the embryo remain unclear.\nIn addition to nanos mRNA, Smaug acts on many other target transcripts during\nearly embryogenesis and plays a key role in the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of gene expression, syncytial cell cycle control, blastoderm cellularization, and gastrulation (Benoit et al, 2009; Chen et al, 2014a; Siddiqui et al, 2012; Tadros et al, 2007). Smaug protein is highly abundant during the first three hours of embryogenesis (Cao et al, 2020; Dahanukar et al, 1999; Smibert et al, 1999). Later in embryogenesis, with the onset of zygotic transcription, Smaug protein is targeted by a Skp/Cullin/F-boxcontaining (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and is subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process required for an orderly MZT (Cao et al, 2022, 2020).\nThrough studies in cultured Drosophila CI8 cells, in Drosophila wing imaginal\ndiscs, and in Drosophila wings, Smaug has been linked to the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway (Bruzzone et al, 2020). It was shown that Smaug binds to Smoothened, a protein that is structurally similar to Frizzled-type G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and essential for the transduction of the HH signal (Ingham & McMahon, 2001). The recruitment of Smaug to Smoothened was proposed to result in phosphorylation of Smaug by the protein kinase Fused (Bruzzone et al, 2020).\nWhether the Smaug - Smoothened interaction and the phosphorylation of Smaug play a role during early embryonic development has not been addressed.\nHere, we performed a protein-protein interaction screen and confirmed that\nOskar and Smoothened directly bind Smaug. Both proteins associated with the previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain (NTD) of Smaug comprising both SSR1 and SSR2. We have solved the crystal structures of the NTD of the human Smaug ortholog SAMD4A alone and of the NTD of Drosophila Smaug in complex with a Smoothened peptide. The crystal structures revealed that the NTD is composed of a dimerization (D) subdomain and a PHAT subdomain, which interact and jointly form a groove that is bound by the Smoothened peptide. Furthermore, we identified a\npredicted a-helix within the disordered region of Oskar that binds to the NTD of Smaug,\nand structural modeling supported by experimental data suggested that the complex is structurally similar to the Smaug-Smoothened complex. Together, our data uncover the structural basis for the complex formation between an RNA-binding protein and a signaling protein, and suggest a conserved function of the NTD of Smaug proteins as peptide-binding domain."

            "text": "Smaug directly binds to Smoothened To analyze protein interactions between proteins, we have recently developed ReLo, a cell culture-based protein-protein interaction assay that is based on a subcellular translocation readout (Salgania et al, 2022). Our previous analyses strongly suggested that interactions identified with the ReLo assay are direct (Salgania et al, 2022). Furthermore, we have shown that the ReLo assay is particularly suitable for the identification and characterization of direct interactions to proteins that are large and\npoorly accessible for biochemical and biophysical studies, such as Smaug. In the ReLo assay, the two proteins to be tested for an interaction are fused to red (mCherry) or green (EGFP) fluorescent proteins, coexpressed in Drosophila Schneider 2R+ (S2R+) cells and their subcellular localization is analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Importantly, the bait protein carries a membrane anchoring domain, and its interaction with a prey protein is visualized by the subcellular relocalization of the prey protein towards the membrane to which the bait protein is anchored.\nTo assess protein interactions with Smaug we used an EGFP-Smaug construct\nthat carried an N-terminal fusion to a PH domain (Salgania et al, 2022), which directed the localization of Smaug to the plasma membrane. With the ReLo assay, we have previously evaluated the interaction between Smaug and the six core subunits of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which is responsible for the deadenylation of nanos mRNA, and have identified the NOT3 subunit as Smaug-binding protein (Pekovic et al, 2022). Here, we tested interactions between Smaug and additional proteins involved in nanos mRNA repression, including Ago1 and Ago2 (Pinder and Smibert, 2013), Aubergine and Ago3 (Barckmann et al, 2015; Rouget et al, 2010), Cup (Nelson et al, 2004) as well as Me31B, Tral, and Belle (G\u00f6tze et al, 2017; Jeske et al, 2011). However, we did not observe an interaction between Smaug and any of these factors (Supplemental Figure 1A). In addition to the pairwise testing, the Smaug-Cup interaction was also tested in the presence of eIF4E and/or the translation control element (TCE) of nanos mRNA, which contains the Smaug recognition elements (SRE). Again, no interaction between Smaug and Cup was observed (Supplemental Figure 1B).\nRecent findings indicated a direct interaction between Smaug and Smoothened\n(Bruzzone et al, 2020). Smoothened is a membrane protein that localizes to distinct\ncytoplasmic vesicles and as such we were able to confirm the Smoothened-Smaug interaction in the ReLo assay by asking if Smoothened localizes Smaug to these vesicles (Figures 1A and 1B). We next set out to map the regions of Smaug and Smoothened that are involved in the interaction. Smoothened consists of an N-terminal extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD; aa 51-246), a central seven-transmembrane domain (7-TM; aa 247-555), and a C-terminal 'cytotail' (aa 556-1036), which is a long cytoplasmic and predominantly disordered region (Figure 1A). As the cytotail has been previously reported to bind Smaug (Bruzzone et al., 2020), this fragment of Smoothened was tested in combination with the N-terminal part of Smaug (NTD; aa 1- 281), the disordered region (DR1, aa 282-595), the SAM-PHAT domain combination (aa 596-765), or the C-terminal disordered region (DR2, aa 766-999). The results revealed that the Smoothened cytotail bound to the NTD of Smaug (Figure 1C), which is consistent with previous data (Bruzzone et al, 2020). Using ReLo, we further confirmed previous data that Smaug bound to a small region within the cytotail of Smoothened spanning amino acid residues 958-1003 (Bruzzone et al, 2020), and\nrefined the mapping to a predicted a-helix covering residues 970-1003 of Smoothened\n(Figure 1D). By isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the KD of the complex formed by Smaug 70-281 and a synthetic Smo 970-1003 peptide was determined as 0.8 \u00b5M, and the complex was found to have a 1:1 stoichiometry (Figure 1E). In following experiments, we refer to Smoothened 970-1003 as the Smaug binding region (SBR).\nCrystal structure of the D-PHAT domain of human SAMD4A We sought to determine the three-dimensional structure of the Smoothened-binding NTD of Drosophila Smaug by X-ray crystallography. Unfortunately, none of the soluble\nSmaug-NTD variants tested containing or lacking N-terminal truncations (D1-36, D1-\n69) or regions predicted to be disordered (D156-196, D175-184, D159-184)\ncrystallized. As an alternative, we purified and crystallized the NTD (aa 2-156) of the human Smaug ortholog SAMD4A (Figure 2A) as a hexahistidine (His)-tag fusion. The crystals obtained diffracted to 1.62 \u00c5 resolution, and additional diffraction experiments using selenomethionine-derivative crystals allowed us to solve the structure by native phasing methods (Supplemental Table 1).\nThe crystal structure revealed that the SAMD4A-NTD forms a homodimer, and\neach monomer is composed of two subdomains (Figure 2B). The N-terminal\nsubdomain is composed of three a-helices that exhibit a zig-zag arrangement and has\npreviously been predicted to form a dimerization domain similar to the D-domain of the\nb-Transducin repeat-containing protein 1 (b-TrCP1) (Tang et al, 2007). In fact, a\nsearch with the protein structure comparison server DALI (Holm & Rosenstr\u00f6m, 2010) revealed that the D-subdomain of SAMD4A is structurally most similar to the D-domain\nof b-TrCP1. Both D-domain dimers align with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.928 \u00c5 over 328 aligned atoms (Figure 2C, left panel). Within the dimer, the two Dsubdomains are parallelly oriented and extensively interlaced to establish a superhelical tertiary structure. The hydrophobic dimer interface is highly conserved and buries a surface area of 2645 \u00c52 as determined using the PISA server (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007) (Figure 2D and Supplemental Figure 2). Attempts to interfere with dimerization through point mutagenesis led to insoluble protein in recombinant expression experiments (data not shown).\nThe C-terminal subdomain of the SAMD4A-NTD is composed of a bundle of five\na-helices (a5-9), which is connected with the D-subdomain through a linker a-helix\n(a4) (Figure 2B). DALI search revealed that the five-helical bundle of SAMD4A is\nstructurally most similar to the previously described PHAT domain in the middle part\nof Drosophila Smaug (Green et al, 2003) (Figure 2A). Thus, the crystal structure of the SAMD4-NTD led to discovery that both Smaug and SAMD4A contain not one but two PHAT domains: PHAT1 is connected to a D-subdomain and located in the NTD, whereas PHAT2 is connected to an RNA-binding SAM domain and located in the middle part of the protein. Sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction analysis revealed that, depending on the protein, PHAT domains are either compact or carry unstructured insertions: The PHAT1 domain of SAMD4A is compact, while the PHAT 1 domain of Smaug contains two unstructured insertions; in contrast, the PHAT2 domain of Smaug is compact, while the PHAT2 domain of SAMD4A carries an unstructured insertion (Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B). The crystal structures of SAMD4A PHAT1 and Smaug PHAT2 aligned with an RMSD of 2.87 \u00c5 over 88 residues (Figure 2C). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog Vts1 lacks both PHAT domains (Supplemental Figure 3C).\nIn the SAMD4A-NTD structure, the PHAT1-domain contacts both monomers of\nthe D-subdomain dimer - the one in the same polypeptide chain and its dimerizing partner molecule (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the residues of interface between the D and PHAT1 subdomains are highly conserved (Supplemental Figure 2). This suggested that the PHAT1 subdomain folds back to the D-subdomain only after the dimer has been established. A rigid arrangement has also been discussed previously for the relative position of the PHAT2 domain to the SAM domain of Smaug (Green et al, 2003) (Figure 2F).\nA point mutation in mouse SAMD4A causes a supermodel (spmd) phenotype\nwith mice being resistant to obesity induced by a high fat diet, and displaying leanness and myopathy (Chen et al, 2014b). The spmd mutation (H86P) maps to the NTD of SAMD4A, and we analyzed the mutation using our structure of the human SAMD4A-\nNTD. With the exception of two residues, the sequences of the NTDs (aa 1-155) of human and mouse SAMD4A are identical (Supplemental Figure 2A). Our structure\nrevealed that H86 resides within the a6-helix of the PHAT1 domain and is engaged in\na hydrogen bond with E61 residing in the linker a4-helix (Figure 2G). Mutating H86 to\nproline caused complete insolubility of both human and mouse SAMD4A-NTD upon expression in E. coli, which is in stark contrast to the corresponding highly soluble wildtype constructs (Supplemental Figure 4). This indicates that the H86P mutation prevents proper folding of the domains. Proline residues can undergo a cis-transisomerization reaction and are well known for their impact on protein (mis)folding, for\nexample by partial mis-isomerization or by their ability to induce kinks in a-helices\n(Englander & Mayne, 2014). Therefore, we assume that the spmd mutation causes folding problems of the SAMD4A-NTD in vivo, which probably leads to misfunctioning of the protein in mice.\nStructure of the NTD of Smaug in complex with the SBR of Smoothened Next, we aimed to obtain structural information on the Smaug-Smoothened complex. The cytotail of Smoothened is conserved in Drosophilids but not across animals (Supplemental Figure 5A) and we have not detected any binding of human or Drosophila Smoothened to human SAMD4A (Supplemental Figures 5B, 5C, 5D), which suggests that the Smoothened-Smaug interaction is specific to Drosophila. To crystallize the Drosophila Smaug-NTD in complex with the Smoothened SBR peptide, we designed a Smaug-NTD construct based on the SAMD4A-NTD structure, in which\ntwo regions of predicted disorder (D1-72 and D156-196) were deleted. The Drosophila\nSmaug-NTD harboring these two deletions was still able to bind to Smoothened (and Oskar, see below) (Supplemental Figure 6). Two strategies were pursued for\ncrystallization: one, in which Smaug 73-281D156-196 was mixed with a Smo 970-1003\npeptide and a second, in which the Smo 970-1003 sequence was fused to the N-\nterminus of Smaug 73-278D156-196 using a (GGS)4 linker. With both strategies, crystals of similar shape were obtained. Of these, the crystals of the single-chain construct diffracted best and to 2.0 \u00c5 resolution (Supplemental Table 1). The structure of the Smaug-Smoothened complex was solved by molecular replacement using the human SAMD4A-NTD structure as a search model. The resolved structure\nwas composed of two molecules each of Smaug 73-274D156-196 and Smo 976-989;\nno electron density was observed for the (GGS)4 linker (Figures 3A and 3B).\nThe Smoothened peptide forms an a-helix, which is bound to a groove created\nby the D-subdomain dimer and the PHAT subdomain. The interface area of the Smaug-Smoothened complex measures 1522 \u00c52 (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007) (Figure\n3C). The Smoothened a-helix that binds to Smaug is highly conserved across\nDrosophilids but not in higher animals (Figure 3D, Supplemental Figure 5A). The Smaug-Smoothened interface was validated by mutational analyses: The triple point mutation L978E/L984E/L985E in Smoothened interfered with Smaug binding in ReLo and GST pull-down assays (Figures 3E and 3F). Likewise, the S250E/L253E mutation in Smaug prevented the interaction with Smoothened in ReLo and GST pull-down assays (Figures 3F and 3G). Thus, our mutational analysis confirms the interface of the Smaug - Smoothened complex observed in the crystal structure.\nOskar directly binds to Smaug Using ReLo, we also retested the previously described interaction between Smaug and Oskar (Dahanukar et al, 1999; Jeske et al, 2011; Zaessinger et al, 2006) (Figure 4A). Translation of oskar mRNA from two alternative start codons results in two protein\nisoforms, of which Short Oskar is essential for germ cell formation and posterior patterning (Markussen et al, 1995). We tested Smaug interaction to the two Oskar isoforms. Long Oskar is a membrane protein (Vanzo et al, 2007) and localized as speckles in S2R+ cells (Figure 4B). Thus, we did not use an additional membrane anchor to test the Smaug - Long Oskar interaction in the ReLo assay. When Long Oskar and Smaug were coexpressed, we did not observe a relocalization of Smaug (Figure 4B). Short Oskar localizes to the nucleus in S2R+ cells and a fusion to the PH domain does not efficiently redirect/anchor Short Oskar to the plasma membrane (Salgania et al, 2022). Therefore, to assess protein interactions to Short Oskar, it carried an N-terminal fusion to OST4, a small membrane protein that directed Short Oskar localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using OST4-anchored Short Oskar, we have previously confirmed the known direct interaction with the DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa (Supplemental Figure 7A) (Salgania et al, 2022; Jeske et al, 2017, 2015). Here, we show that OST4-Short Oskar interacted also with Smaug (Figure 4B), which is consistent with earlier observations (Dahanukar et al, 1999; Jeske et al, 2011; Zaessinger et al, 2006). We used additional ReLo assays to test other previously suggested binding partners of Short Oskar, including the WD40 protein Valois (a.k.a. MEP50) (Anne, 2010), the elF4E-binding protein Cup (Ottone et al, 2012), the actin-binding protein Lasp (Suyama et al, 2009), and the dsRNA-binding protein Staufen (Breitwieser et al, 1996). However, none of these proteins relocalized with Short Oskar (Supplemental Figure 7B).\nThe interaction between Smaug and Short Oskar was also visible in split-\nubiquitin yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) assays (Figure 4C, upper panel), which we then used to map the respective protein regions that mediate the interaction. Interestingly, among the four Smaug fragments tested, it was the NTD that bound to Short Oskar\n(Figure 4A and lower panel of Figure 4C), which is the same Smaug domain that also bound to Smoothened. Next, we examined which part of Short Oskar binds to Smaug. Short Oskar carries an extended LOTUS (eLOTUS) domain (aa 139-240) at the N-terminus, followed by a predominantly disordered region (DR, aa 241-400), and a C-terminal OSK domain (aa 401-606) (Figure 4A). Both the eLOTUS and the OSK domain bind to RNA in vitro (Ding et al, 2020; Jeske et al, 2015; Yang et al, 2015). In addition, the eLOTUS domain serves as a regulatory domain for the Vasa ATPase activity (Jeske et al, 2017). In Y2H experiments, Smaug bound to the DR fragment of Oskar (Figure 4D). Short Oskar that carried a deletion of the DR was not able to interact with the NTD of Smaug (Figure 4E). The DR of Oskar carries several regions with high sequence conservation across Drosophilids (Supplemental Figure 7C). Of these, Oskar 292-352 was the Smaug-binging region (SBR), as it was necessary and sufficient for Smaug interaction in Y2H assays (Figures 4E). Moreover, a shorter version of the Oskar SBR (aa 292-325), which showed highest conservation (Supplemental Figure 7C), fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) was able to copurify the NTD of Smaug (aa 37-281) in an MBP pull-down assay (Figure 4F). Like Smoothened, Oskar bound to the NTD of Smaug, but not to the NTD of SAMD4A (Supplemental Figure 7D).\nPredicted structure of the SBR of Oskar bound to the NTD of Smaug Surface residues of the Smoothened-binding groove of the NTD of Smaug are relatively conserved across animals (Supplemental Figure 2), and we asked if the SBR of Short Oskar might bind to this groove too. We ran an AlphaFold2-multimer structural prediction (Evans et al, 2021; Jumper et al, 2021; Mirdita et al, 2022) using two copies each of the Smaug 70-280 (NTD) and the Oskar aa 295-300 as input\nsequences. We obtained a model of a heterotetramer, in which two a-helices covering\npart of the SBR of Oskar (aa 292-309) were placed into the Smoothened-binding groove of each D-PHAT domain of Smaug (Figures 5A and 5B). This shorter part of the SBR contains several conserved and highly conserved residues that contact the NTD of Smaug (Figure 5C). Importantly, using ReLo and Y2H assays, we found that the interaction between Short Oskar and Smaug is prevented when Oskar lacked the longer or shorter version of the SBR or when Smaug carried the point mutations in the NTD that also disrupted its interaction with Smoothened (Figures 5D, 5E, and 5F). Together, these data suggested that Smaug binds to Smoothened or Short Oskar in a similar fashion, and revealed the NTD of Smaug as peptide-binding domain."

            "text": "Here, we present the crystal structures of the previously uncharacterized NTDs of human SAMD4A and Drosophila Smaug, which are composed of a D- and a PHATsubdomain. These structural data revealed that Smaug and its animal orthologs contain not one but two PHAT domains, one connected to the dimerizing D-domain and one connected to the RNA-binding SAM domain. The D-domain has been predicted previously for Smaug and Vts1, and dimerization of the Vts1 D-domain was demonstrated (Tang et al, 2007). Furthermore, our structural analysis of the SmaugSmoothened complex revealed that the D-domain not only functions as dimerization domain, but also forms a peptide binding groove together with the PHAT-subdomain.\nOur data also demonstrated an interaction between the NTD of Smaug and a\nshort part of the predominantly disordered region of Oskar. Structural modelling revealed a binding mode for the Oskar-Smaug interaction that is similar to the Smoothened-Smaug complex. The formation of such a protein binding groove is\nprobably specific to the animal members of the Smaug protein family, as yeast Vts1 contains the D and the SAM domains, but lacks PHAT domains. The high conservation of the protein-binding groove of the NTD of metazoan Smaug/SAMD4 proteins suggests that SAMD4A, which does not bind to Oskar or Smoothened, may bind to a yet unknown partner in a similar fashion (Figure 5G).\nPreviously, a direct Oskar-Smaug interaction has been suggested and mapped\nto the SAM-PHAT2 domain of Smaug using classical Y2H assays (Dahanukar et al, 1999). The data from this interaction mapping raised the idea that Oskar might antagonize the Smaug repressive function by competing with the nanos SREs for binding to the RNA-binding SAM domain of Smaug (Dahanukar et al, 1999). However, the same lab also created transgenic flies to test mutations in Smaug that might interfere with Oskar interaction, without affecting RNA-binding, and reported that these substitutions had no effect on embryonic patterning (Dean et al, 2002). Using the splitubiquitin-based Y2H, we did not observe a specific interaction between the SAMPHAT2 region of Smaug and Short Oskar: we observed a similar degree of cell grow when the SAM-PHAT construct was coexpressed with the control plasmid as compared to its coexpression with Short Oskar. Instead, we found that Oskar bound to the NTD of Smaug. Dahanukar et al. did not test a Smaug fragment comprising the full NTD, but only a truncated fragment (1-242) lacking a large part of the PHAT1 subdomain. This truncated Smaug construct did not show an Oskar interaction (Dahanukar et al, 1999). Our Y2H data, structural modeling and mutagenesis all lead to the conclusion that Oskar binds to the NTD of Smaug, but it remains unclear if the interaction contributes to a block of Smaug binding to nanos mRNA and if so, how. As Oskar did not bind to the RNA-binding SAM domain of Smaug, and the NTD of Smaug did not bind to RNA in in vitro binding experiments (data not shown), Oskar seems\nnot to actively interfere with binding of Smaug to nanos mRNA. UV crosslink experiments indicate that Short Oskar binds to nanos mRNA in vivo (Jeske et al, 2015). However, from this experiment it is unclear whether Oskar is capable of recognizing nanos mRNA directly or whether the RNA-binding specificity is mediated by another RNA-binding protein in vivo, such as Smaug. The eLOTUS domain of Short Oskar binds to the DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa and stimulates its ATPase activity (Jeske et al, 2017), suggesting a contributing function of Vasa in nanos mRNA control. Whether indeed Oskar works together with Vasa to prevent the Smaug-mediated repression of nanos mRNA at the posterior pole remains to be investigated.\nOur biochemical and structural data demonstrate a direct interaction between\nSmoothened and Smaug, yet the function of this interaction is unclear. In cell culture assays, Smaug is phosphorylated upon HH signaling and this phosphorylation depends on Smoothened (Bruzzone et al, 2020). Further studies in cell culture, in wing imaginal discs, and fly wings suggested that Smaug phosphorylation leads to a reduced mRNA repressive activity (Bruzzone et al, 2020). Smaug has an established function as repressor of maternal mRNAs during early Drosophila embryogenesis. Consistent with this function, Smaug protein expression is highest between 0 and 3 hours of embryonic development (Dahanukar et al, 1999; Gramates et al, 2022; CasasVila et al, 2017) (Supplemental Figure 8A). In contrast, Smaug. protein levels are at the detection limit in all developmental stages beyond the larvae stage L3 (Casas-Vila et al, 2017) (Supplemental Figure 8A), and Smaug defects were reported earlier to not cause any phenotype in the adult fly (Dahanukar et al, 1999).\nKeeping these earlier observations in mind, we asked if there might be a\nfunction for the Smaug - Smoothened interaction in the early embryo. During early embryogenesis, the protein expression pattern of Smoothened is reciprocal to the one\nof Smaug: Smoothened protein levels are low in early embryos, and strongly enhanced after 3 h of development (Heuvel & Ingham, 1996; Casas-Vila et al, 2017) (Supplemental Figure 8A). This reciprocal expression pattern might indicate that one protein regulates the level of the other protein. Smaug protein is actively cleared during the MZT (after ca. 3 h), and its degradation is initiated by SCF-mediated ubiquitination (Cao et al, 2022, 2020). Furthermore, it was suggested that Smaug is recognized by\nthe F-box proteins Slmb (the Drosophila b-TrCP ortholog) and Bard, with Bard\nexhibiting a predominant and a timing role in Smaug degradation (Cao et al, 2022, 2020). In our ReLo assays, we did not observe the Smaug - Slmb interaction, but detected the Smaug - Bard interaction (Supplemental Figure 8B). Often the recognition of target proteins by F-box proteins, such as Slmb, depends on prior phosphorylation of the target (Morais-de-S\u00e1 et al, 2013; Mason & Laman, 2020; Frescas & Pagano, 2008; Jia et al, 2005). Mouse and human SAMD4A/Smaug1 were reported to interact with 14-3-3 proteins (Chen et al, 2014b; Fehilly et al, 2023), a protein family known to recognize phosphorylated sequences within their protein partners (Obsilova & Obsil, 2022). We detected the Drosophila Smaug interaction to\n14-3-3z and 14-3-3e in our ReLo assays (Supplemental Figure 8C), suggesting that\nSmaug is phosphorylated in these cells. Furthermore, Smaug phosphorylation has been described in the embryo and in Drosophila Cl8 cell culture (Bruzzone et al, 2020; Zhai et al, 2008). In Cl8 cells, Smaug phosphorylation was dependent on both Smoothened expression and HH signaling. Additional data suggested that upon HH signaling, Smoothened binds simultaneously to Smaug and the serin/threonine kinase Fused, and thereby mediates the phosphorylation of Smaug by Fused (Bruzzone et al, 2020). Using our ReLo assays, we confirmed a direct interaction between Smoothened and Fused and, consistent with previous Y2H data (Malpel et al, 2007), we mapped\nSmoothened binding to the C-terminal regulatory domain of Fused (Supplemental\nFigure 8D). Considering this chain of interactions and activities, we are wondering whether a Smaug phosphorylation event mediated by Smoothened might be relevant for the SCF-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Smaug in the early embryo. In this manner, Smoothened might contribute to the timing of the MZT in the early embryo, an exciting hypothesis that needs to be tested in the future."
