    "abstractText": "Review Editor: Jeanine Amacher Abstract UHRF1 is an essential chromatin protein required for DNA methylation maintenance, mammalian development, and gene regulation. We investigated the Tandem-Tudor domain (TTD) of human UHRF1 that is known to bind H3K9me2/3 histones and is a major driver of UHRF1 localization in cells. We verified binding to H3K9me2/3 but unexpectedly discovered stronger binding to H3 peptides and mononucleosomes containing K9me2/3 with additional K4me1. We investigated the combined binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 versus H3K9me2/3 alone, engineered mutants with specific and differential changes of binding, and discovered a novel read-out mechanism for H3K4me1 in an H3K9me2/3 context that is based on the interaction of R207 with the H3K4me1 methyl group and on counting the H-bond capacity of H3K4. Individual TTD mutants showed up to a 10,000-fold preference for the double-modified peptides, suggesting that after a conformational change, WT TTD could exhibit similar effects. The frequent appearance of H3K4me1-K9me2 regions in human chromatin demonstrated in our TTD chromatin pull-down and ChIP-western blot data suggests that it has specific biological roles. Chromatin pull-down of TTD from HepG2 cells and full-length murine UHRF1 ChIP-seq data correlate with H3K4me1 profiles indicating that the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 interaction of TTD influences chromatin binding of full-length UHRF1. We demonstrate the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 specific binding of UHRF1-TTD to enhancers and promoters of cell-type-specific genes at the flanks of cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites, and provided evidence supporting an H3K4me1-K9me2/3 dependent and TTD mediated downregulation of these genes by UHRF1. All these findings illustrate the important physiological function of UHRF1-TTD binding to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double marks in a cellular context.",

            "text": "Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are a crucial part of chromatin signaling (Allis & Jenuwein, 2016) with important roles in diseases like cancer (Zhao et al., 2021). Among them, histone H3 PTMs have a prominent role with a high number of modifications, some of which are particularly abundant (Huang et al., 2015). Over the years, single histone PTMs were found to demarcate various distinct chromatin regions (Allis & Jenuwein, 2016; Zhang et al., 2015), for example, H3K4me1 marks enhancers (Calo & Wysocka, 2013), and H3K4me3 is found on promoters of actively transcribed genes (Bernstein et al., 2005). In contrast, H3K9me3 is enriched on constitutive heterochromatin (Zhang et al., 2015) and H3K9me2 occurs in very broad, megabase-long blocks that contribute to inactive chromatin compartment formation (Fukuda et al., 2021). With a relative abundance exceeding 60%, H3K9me2 is the most common H3 PTM in HeLa cells, according to quantitative mass-spectrometry (Janssen et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021). In contrast, H3K4 is usually unmodified, and H3K4me1 is the most prevalent modification of this residue with reported abundances of 30% (Janssen et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021). At the next level of complexity, modifications on different residues of H3 were found to co-occur, and 600 double marks were documented recently (Lu et al., 2021). Synergistic or antagonistic combinations of histone PTMs modulate their biological effects; for example, enhancers of highly expressed genes harbor H3K4me1 and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac; Calo & Wysocka, 2013), while promoters bearing H3K4me3 together with H3K27me3 are silent but poised for activation (Bernstein et al., 2006). In general, double marks can act through two distinct mechanisms, either by combining the effects of the individual marks, or by signaling new biological outcomes. The latter process depends on \u201creader\u201d protein domains that are multivalent and bind in a defined manner to multiple marks (Ruthenburg et al., 2007; Taverna et al., 2007).\nUHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like with PHD And Ring Finger Domains 1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with five domains, a Ubiquitin-Like domain (UBL), Tandem-Tudor domain (TTD), Plant Homeodomain (PHD), SET- and RINGassociated (SRA) domain, and Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain (Figure 1a). The TTD was found to bind to H3K9me2/3 (Nady et al., 2011; Rothbart et al., 2012) and microscopy studies showed that TTD is the principal driver of UHRF1 subnuclear localization on heterochromatic H3K9me2/3 foci (Nady et al., 2011). Structural studies showed that the two Tudor domains of TTD form a groove between them, wherein H3 (residues\n1\u201311) peptides containing H3K9me3 bind and place the K9me3 in a classical aromatic cage formed by the TTD residues F152, Y188, and Y191 (Nady et al., 2011; Rothbart et al., 2012). H3K4me2/3 was found to reduce binding in the H3K9me3 context (Nady et al., 2011), while H3S10ph did not (Rothbart et al., 2012). Further investigations of peptide binding by TTD have revealed many, complex interactions both within the protein and with other partners, for example, two autoinhibitory peptides from other parts of the protein can either occupy the H3 binding groove or be allosterically displaced (Cheng et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018; Kori et al., 2019). Moreover, stronger binding of TTD to LIG1-K126me2/3 than to H3K9me2/3 was discovered (Ferry et al., 2017; Kori et al., 2019). Additional studies showed that PHD can recognize the unmodified H3R2, and the linked TTD-PHD domains were observed to engage a multivalent H3\u2013tail interaction binding H3R2me0-K9me2/3 (Arita et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013; Rothbart et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2012) connecting UHRF1 to euchromatin (Rajakumara et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2016). However, the biological relevance of many of these in vitro observations is still unclear (Vaughan et al., 2020).\nUHRF1 functions as an epigenetic hub, coordinating and recruiting different chromatin-interacting proteins (Bronner et al., 2019; Mancini et al., 2021). In 2007, landmark studies revealed the necessity of UHRF1 for DNA replication and maintenance of DNA methylation (Bostick et al., 2007; Sharif et al., 2007). Knockout of UHRF1 in mice is embryonically lethal and UHRF1 KO ES cells show massive DNA hypomethylation, particularly in heterochromatic regions and retrotransposon elements (Muto et al., 2002; Sharif et al., 2007). Later studies showed that this effect is mediated by UHRF1-catalyzed ubiquitination of H3 that contributes to DNMT1 recruitment (Nishiyama et al., 2013) and by direct interaction of UHRF1 and DNMT1 (Bashtrykov et al., 2014; Berkyurek et al., 2014). The subnuclear localization of UHRF1 with H3K9me2/3 dependent enrichment in pericentric heterochromatin of interphase nuclei was also found to direct maintenance DNA methylation to these regions (Rothbart et al., 2012). In recent years, many more processes directly involving UHRF1 have been uncovered, including DNA damage repair, regulation of differentiation and gene regulation (Mancini et al., 2021). In cancer cells, UHRF1 is often upregulated, and it can bind gene promoters to mediate silencing of the associated genes (Mancini et al., 2021). Generally, UHRF1 disruption results in strong DNA hypomethylation and reduced celltype-specific gene expression, pointing towards its important role as a regulator of cell lineage specification during differentiation (Kim et al., 2018; Obata et al., 2014;\nRamesh et al., 2016; Sakai et al., 2022; Yamashita et al., 2018).\nIn this study, we investigated the human UHRF1-Tandem Tudor domain that binds H3K9me2/3 histones and is one of the major drivers of UHRF1 localization in cells. We discovered preferential binding of TTD to H3 peptides and mononucleosomes containing K9me2/3 together with K4me1. We describe a novel readout mechanism for H3K4me1 in an H3K9me2/3 context which is based on the interaction of R207 with the H3K4me1 methyl group and on counting the H-bond capacity of H3K4. Interestingly, TTD mutants showed up\nto 10,000-fold specificity for the double-modified peptides, suggesting that specific conformations of TTD exist, which mediate strong H3K4me1-K9me2/3 readout. We demonstrate that TTD specifically binds enhancers and promoters of cell-type-specific genes at the flanks of celltype-specific transcription factor binding sites. The physiological relevance of our findings is demonstrated by showing that published full-length murine UHRF1 ChIPseq data strongly correlate with H3K4me1 profiles in regions containing H3K9me2/3, indicating that the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 readout by TTD is of key relevance for chromatin binding of UHRF1 in cells. Moreover, by\nreanalysis of published data, we demonstrate H3K4me1-K9me2/3 dependent downregulation of these genes by UHRF1 that is mediated by the TTD chromatin interaction."

            "text": "We purified the hUHRF1-TTD (residues 126\u2013280; Rothbart et al., 2012) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST; Figure 1a). To screen for combined binding of TTD to H3 peptides with multiple modifications, we used CelluSpots\u2122 peptide arrays (Bock et al., 2011), which contain 275 different H3 histone tail peptides with up to four modifications (Figure 1b). Analysis of the results generated a binding specificity profile of TTD to modified H3 peptides shown in Figure 1c. As previously reported (Nady et al., 2011; Rothbart et al., 2012), TTD bound H3K9 methylated peptides, but with a clear preference for H3K9me2 on the CelluSpots\u2122 arrays. Unexpectedly, the strongest binding was detected with peptides containing the H3K4me1-K9me2 double modification, while peptides carrying each of the single modifications separately showed no (H3K4me1) or weaker (H3K9me2) binding signals. This indicated a stimulation of binding, resulting from the presence of both modifications on the same peptide. This observation was reproduced in two independent replicates of the experiment (Figure 1c, Figure S1a). As the second-best double modification, H3K4me2-K9me2 modified peptides were identified, but not further analyzed. On the CelluSpots arrays, we also observed R-methylation on the preferentially bound H3 peptides (Figure 1c), but unfortunately, the commercial array is lacking H3 peptides only methylated on K4 and K9 without R-methylation. However, two different H3Rmethylation sites (R2 and R8) and structural isomers (R2me2a and R2me2s) were observed, indicating the absence of a position and modification-specific stimulatory effect, and a stimulatory role of R-methylation on TTD binding was ruled out by additional experiments (Figure S2).\nPreviously, the TTD was shown to bind to various methylated and unmethylated peptides, with structural evidence of changes in binding modes and conformational rearrangements (Jeltsch, 2019). In the solution structure of TTD with a bound H3K9me3 peptide, the peptide had an extended conformation lying inside the binding groove between the two Tudor domains with H3K4 placed in an acidic pocket (D142 and E153) and\nH3K9me3 in the aromatic cage formed by F152, Y188, and Y191 (Figure 1d, PDB: 2L3R; Nady et al., 2011). The LIG1-K126me3 peptide bound to the same groove in a similar conformation, but the acidic pocket was occupied by LIG1-R121, and the aromatic cage bound LIG1-K126me3 (Figure 1e, PDB: 5YY9; Kori et al., 2019). Strikingly, binding to the LIG1 peptide was more than 100-fold stronger compared to H3K9me3 (9 nM vs. 1600 nM). This effect was due to the binding of LIG1-R121 into the acidic pocket, as seen by the strongly elevated binding strength of a K4R-K9me3 H3 mutant peptide (22 nM; Kori et al., 2019), and it could be attributed to the better geometry of the bidentate H-bonds between UHRF1-D142 and LIG1-R121. Another characteristic of the different binding modes was the lack of interaction of LIG1-R121 with UHRF1-E153 in the H3K4 binding pocket (Figure S1b,c). These data suggest that the acidic binding pocket is not ideally occupied with an unmodified lysine residue, which is relevant in the context of the current study, as the preferred binding of the H3K4me1-K9me2 peptide is also expected to be caused by differences in the H3K4me0 versus H3K4me1 interaction in this pocket."

            "text": "H3K9me2/3\nTo validate our peptide array binding results, we conducted equilibrium peptide binding experiments using fluorescently labeled H3 peptides with the single K9me2/3 or double K4me1-K9me2/3 modifications (Table S2). In fluorescence anisotropy (FA) titrations with GST-fused TTD, we determined the TTD dissociation constant (KD) of H3K9me3 to be 680 \u00b1 18 nM but 240 \u00b1 51 nM for H3K4me1-K9me3 (Figure 2a). This corresponds to an approximately threefold stimulation of binding by H3K4me1 being present together with H3K9me3 on the same peptide (Table 1). Studies with the H3K9me2 and H3K4me1-K9me2 peptides showed a similar trend, with a >2-fold preference for the double-modified peptide (Figure S3a). The measured KD values for single-modified H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 binding agree with the literature (Cheng et al., 2013; Rothbart et al., 2012, 2013). Control experiments with H3 peptides without modification or carrying only K4me1 confirmed the necessity of K9me2/3 for strong interaction (Figure S3a,b). Thus, we validated and quantified the preferential binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 peptides compared to H3K9me2/3. To our knowledge, the only previously reported binding titrations with a peptide containing H3K4 and K9 methylation were with\nH3K4me3-K9me3, showing a weakened interaction with TTD (Nady et al., 2011).\nNext, we were curious to understand the mechanism of the stimulation of peptide binding by H3K4me1 in the context of H3K9me3. Taking a closer look into the H3K4 binding pocket of TTD, D142, and E153 were observed to form H-bonds to K4 (Figure 2b). E153 also interacts with R207 creating a system comprising two interacting acidic and two basic residues. We mutated residues that might interact with the H3K4me1 methyl group to eliminate or\nweaken the difference between the KD values of H3K9me3 peptides with and without H3K4me1. H3K9me3 peptides were used in these experiments, to allow direct comparison with available TTD-peptide structures. Considering aromatic-hydrophobic and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, we first selected the UHRF1-TTD mutants F278A, M224A, and A208G for analysis (Table 1, Figure S3c). In each case, very modest preference changes toward the double-modified substrate were observed suggesting these residues were not\ninvolved in the H3K4me1 readout. Next, we mutated D142 to A and E, and both showed similar preference ratios, but D142A showed a strongly reduced binding of both peptides (Figure S3d,e). However, with the D142N mutation, the preference for binding the double-modified peptide was strongly elevated, indicating that the two peptides interacted differently with this mutant (Table 1). Next, the role of E153 was investigated. E153D bound the H3K9me3 peptide similarly as WT (Figure 2c), but with H3K4me1-K9me3, we observed a gain in binding. E153A/Q led to a near-complete loss of the H3K9me3 interaction (Table 1). Unexpectedly, the H3K4me1-K9me3 peptide was bound with similar to WT or even elevated binding affinity indicating that E153A showed a drastic increase in the preference for binding H3K4me1-K9me3, similar to D142N. This result demonstrates that both peptides are bound by TTD in distinct conformations and mutations in TTD can trigger its change into a more selective conformation. To investigate if any other residue contributes to the positive binding effect of H3K4me1, we compared the structures of the H3 and LIG1 peptides bound to TTD and observed that R207 had different orientations (Figure S1c). Moreover, given the distance of the N\u03b5 of H3K4 to the C\u03b2 and C\u03b3 of R207 (6.0 and 4.8 \u00c5, respectively), the H3K4me1 methyl group\nwould be in van der Waals (vdW) contact distances with these methylene groups, potentially explaining the stimulatory effect of H3K4me1 on peptide binding to TTD. We investigated peptide binding of several R207 mutants and observed that R207E lost the preference for binding to H3K4me1-K9me3 (Figure 2d), suggesting that the charge inversion mutation induced a conformational change that disrupted the vdW contact.\nThe mutant binding data can be compiled leading to a new Kme1 binding mechanism for H3K4me1-K9me3. H3K4me0 has a higher H-bonding potential than H3K4me1 and, therefore, it can interact with both D142 and E153. Consequently, the reduction of the H-bonding potential of these residues by D142N, E153A, or E153Q mutations affects binding of K4me0 more than K4me1 leading to an increased preference for H3K4me1-K9me3. The low binding of H3K4me0-K9me3 and H3K4me1-K9me3 peptides by D142A shows that at least one H-bond from D142 is needed for binding of any of the peptides. The reduced binding of the H3K4me0-K9me3 peptide by D142N and E153A suggests that WT TTD K4me0 forms a bidentate H-bond with D142 and an additional H-bond with E153 (Figure 2b). In contrast, K4me1 can form only two H-bonds, one with D142 and one with an additional H-bond acceptor (either\nthe second oxygen atom of D142 or in its absence E153). In addition, the methyl group of K4me1 makes a vdW contact with R207. This Kme1 interaction mode is distinct from previous models for binding of Kme1/2 which were based on incomplete aromatic cages combined with H-bonds to the amino group (Li et al., 2007; Liu & Huang, 2018). The important role of H-bonds to the K4 side chain for the TTD interaction can explain the reduced binding of H3K4me3-K9me3 peptides, in which the H-bonding capacity of K4 is fully blocked (Nady et al., 2011). One of the most striking and unexpected results of the mutant analyses was the identification of the E153A TTD mutant showing a 10,000-fold preference for binding to H3K4me1-K9me3 double modified peptides which was due to a strong increase of the binding to double modified peptide and reduced interaction with H3K9me3. This observation suggests that a conformational change of the TTD that moves E153 away from the K4 binding pocket could lead to a similar enhancement of dual mark binding specificity in WT TTD. This hypothesis is in agreement with well-documented conformational changes of UHRF1 that demonstrably have important biological outcomes (Fang et al., 2016; Gelato et al., 2014; Kori et al., 2019; Vaughan et al., 2019)."

            "text": "H3K9me2/3\nWe considered the occurrence of the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double mark in human cells very likely, given the high abundance of the individual PTMs observed in mass spectrometric analyses (Janssen et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021). To validate this presumption, H3K4me1 ChIP experiments combined with H3K9me2 western blot detection were carried out. We first validated the specificity of binding for an \u03b1-K4me1 ChIP grade antibody under stringent IP conditions and an \u03b1-K9me2 antibody was validated under western blot conditions (Figure S4a, Table S3). Then, using the tested conditions (Table S4), we performed H3K4me1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using mononucleosomes isolated from HepG2 cells followed by H3K9me2 detection using western blot. From the H3 precipitated using the \u03b1-K4me1 antibody, the \u03b1-K9me2 antibody detected robust signals in multiple biological replicates (Figure S5a). Relative to input, the \u03b1-K4me1 ChIP signals correspond to 9% of the global H3K9me2 (Figure S5b). IgG serves as control for unspecific interactions. These data demonstrate the abundant coexistence of H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 on nucleosomes using antibody-based enrichment and detection.\nHaving validated the preferential binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 modified peptides, we wanted to examine if the preferential interaction can also be seen with native nucleosomes. To this end, we applied CIDOP (chromatin interacting domain precipitation; Kungulovski et al., 2014), an assay similar to ChIP but using the GST-tagged TTD domain to capture native mononucleosomes isolated from HepG2 cells (Figure 3a), followed by western blot analysis for specific H3 PTMs with ChIP-grade antibodies (Table S3), that were validated before use (Figure S4b). After optimizing the washing conditions to reduce unspecific and weak interactions, the pull-down of native mononucleosomes with TTD demonstrated enrichment in both H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 (Figure 3b, Figure S5c,d). Depletion of H3K4me3 validated the specificity of the assay. To test for unspecific interactions, the same mononucleosome preparation was assayed by CIDOP with the D142A mutant. As positive controls, MPP8-CD (Chromo Domain of M-Phase Phosphoprotein 8), a known reader of H3K9me2/3 (Bock et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011), and TAF3-PHD (Plant Homeodomain of TATA-box binding protein Associated Factor 3), an H3K4me3 reader (Kungulovski et al., 2016), were used. The assays were conducted under stringent conditions (Table S4) and repeated for a minimum of three independent biological replicates showing enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 with TTD, but not its D142A mutant, together with enrichment of H3K9me2 with MPP8 and H3K4me3 with TAF3 (Figure 3b, Figure S5c,d). As an alternative readout, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was applied to detect the enrichment of H3K9me2 and depletion of H3K4me3 reporter regions in two biological replicates of the TTD CIDOP (Figure S6a\u2013c). Control experiments with the binding deficient TTD D142A mutant and IgG demonstrated the specificity of the enrichment, and control ChIP-qPCR/CIDOP-qPCR experiments with \u03b1-H3K9me2, MPP8-CD and TAF3-PHD verified the assayed amplicons. In agreement with the western blot results, the qPCR assays revealed enrichment of H3K9me2 and depletion of H3K4me3 with TTD and loss of the H3K9me2 enrichment for the D142A mutant.\nTo look more deeply into the specific genome-wide binding pattern of TTD, we generated paired-end highthroughput sequencing data from the two biological replicates of the CIDOP reaction with TTD and the H3K9me2 ChIP. The high-quality reads were mapped to hg38, quantified excluding blacklisted regions (Amemiya et al., 2019), and pooled (Figure S7). The genome-wide Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the pooled data from UHRF1-TTD CIDOP and each of the replicates was 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. The H3K9me2 ChIP was pooled with r 0.93 and 0.86. For comparison, public\nChIP-seq data for H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 in HepG2 cells were retrieved (Arrigoni et al., 2018). The genomewide r values of the pairwise correlation of TTD data with H3K4me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 were 0.58, 0.53, and 0.12, respectively, indicating that TTD does not show a strong correlation with any of the isolated marks, but moderate similarity exists between the TTD, H3K4me1, and H3K9me2 tracks. It should be noted that the colocalization of UHRF1-TTD and H3K9me2/3 at heterochromatic sites (Karagianni et al., 2008; Nady et al., 2011) was not reflected in this analysis, due to the low coverage of heterochromatic fragments in the ChIP-seq data. For further analysis, we visualized the TTD data alongside H3K4me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3, seeing a very\nstrong correlation of TTD binding with H3K4me1 profiles in areas with broad H3K9me2/3 signal (Figure 3c). This unexpected observation strongly supports our previous biochemical data revealing a preferred binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double marks. Regions rich in H3K4me1, but with little H3K9me2/3, showed negligible TTD signals (Figure 3d). At the same time, regions with H3K9me2/3 alone showed low TTD signal (Figure 3e), indicating a conditional contribution of the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double mark for robust TTD binding. The colocalization of TTD, H3K4me1, and H3K9me2 and the resemblance of peak motifs were seen repeatedly at different genomic regions (Figure S8). These findings indicate that H3K4me1 and H3K9me2/3 are the principal\nmarks behind the TTD signal in non-repetitive genomic regions. Additionally, we verified the broad megabasewide distributions of H3K9me2 lacking defined peaks (Fukuda et al., 2021; Figure S9). Jointly, the genome-wide analysis by western blot and NGS confirmed the specific enrichment of UHRF1-TTD pull-down in nucleosomes carrying H3K9me2 as well as H3K4me1."

            "text": "Bringing together our in vitro, western blot, and NGS data so far, we hypothesized that TTD binding occurs in regions with broad distribution of H3K9me2, in which H3K4me1 peaks resulted in stronger TTD interaction.\nFIGURE 4 Legend on next page.\nBased on this, we expected stronger TTD signal in regions enriched in H3K9me2, where strong TTD signals should correlate with strong H3K4me1. To test for this, we divided the entire genome into 1 kb bins, arranged them by decreasing the mean H3K9me2 signal in 10 equal deciles, as done by Ming et al. (2020). For each, we plotted the mean signals of TTD (Figure 4a), H3K4me1, and H3K9me2 and observed that TTD signals followed the decreasing trend of H3K9me2 across deciles, unlike H3K4me1 (Figure S10a). Looking within decile 1, the gradients of H3K9me2 and TTD are similar (Figure 4b). Furthermore, in H3K9me2-rich deciles, the TTD signal showed a high correlation with H3K4me1 (r 0.8) that declined in deciles with lower H3K9me2 signal (Figure 4c). This demonstrated that a strong TTD signal is observed at regions with a robust, broad H3K9me2 signal, and within these region H3K4me1 modulates TTD intensity. As an additional control, we plotted a heatmap of TTD, H3K4me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 centered on H3K4me1 peaks (Figure 4d), addressing the abundance of the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double mark and showing that about two thirds of the H3K4me1 peaks also contain H3K9me2. This finding indicates that the H3K4me1-K9me2 double mark frequently occurs in the non-repetitive part of the genome. As there is little information about H3K4me1 in heterochromatin, no statements about the co-occurrence of H3K4me1-K9me2/3 in this part of the genome can be made. As expected from the previous analyses, the intensity of the TTD signal was better correlated to H3K9me2 than to H3K4me1 (r 0.76 vs. 0.25), because not all H3K4me1 peaks carry H3K9me2 and the similarity in patterning between TTD and H3K4me1 was only evident in regions with robust H3K9me2.\nTo further validate our finding of the combined readout of H3K4me1 and H3K9me2/3 by TTD, we also performed broad peak calling on TTD. Due to its very broad distribution, peak calling was not possible on H3K9me2, but broad peaks could be identified on H3K9me3. Using the broad peaks of the TTD enrichment, we prepared a heatmap of TTD, H3K4me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 signals centered on these regions. The data clearly showed that TTD peaks have a strong enrichment and positive correlation with H3K4me1 (Figure 4e), and two thirds of the TTD peaks overlap with H3K4me1 peaks (Figure S10b). At the same time, TTD peaks also correlated with a gradient of H3K9me2, with little detectable contribution from H3K9me3, finally revealing a clear similarity of patterning for TTD, H3K4me1, and H3K9me2. This validated that the strong UHRF1-TTD pull-down signal originated from a colocalization of H3K9me2 and H3K4me1, with a conditional contribution from each mark, suggestive of combined TTD binding. To further validate the preferential binding of UHRF1-TTD to mononucleosomes with double H3K4me1-K9me2/3 marks, the broad TTD peaks were split into 622k mononucleosome sized 150 bp fragments which were then used in k-means clustering, resulting in three clusters that were arranged by decreasing TTD signal (Figure 4f). This analysis confirmed that, within the broad UHRF1-TTD CIDOP peaks, the strongest TTD signal came from fragments bearing H3K4me1-K9me2 (cluster 1), followed by regions rich in H3K9me2 some of which showed strong TTD signals (cluster 2), while the weakest signal was found in regions with H3K4me1 but with low amounts of H3K9me2 (cluster 3). As these signals are based on the enrichment of 150 bp DNA fragments, they clearly indicate the presence\nof both marks on one mononucleosome. Addition of H3K9me3 data to this analysis revealed that TTD and H3K9me3 signals were correlated in cluster 3 (Figure S10c), indicating that in this cluster combined readout of H3K4me1-K9me3 occurred.\nTo better address TTD binding to H3K4me1-K9me3 without K9me2, we clustered the H3K9me3 peaks and arranged the clusters by increasing H3K9me2 signal (Figure S11a). In one cluster of this analysis (#2), we clearly observed TTD binding to H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 in the absence of H3K9me2. To validate this finding in reverse, H3K9me3 peaks were found on 12% of H3K4me1 peaks (Figure S11b). A heatmap of H3K4me1 peaks overlapping to \u226550% H3K9me3 peaks and clustering again revealed one cluster (#2), where TTD binds to H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 in the absence of H3K9me2 (Figure S11c). Hence, while the biologically more abundant double-modified substrate in the non-repetitive loci of HepG2 cells is H3K4me1-K9me2, our in vitro and NGS data both document the preferential binding of TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2 and H3K4me1-K9me3.\nFor an independent validation of H3K4me1 as the second part of the double mark read by TTD, we used the TTD peaks and conducted peak overlap analysis with various public ChIP-seq data deposited in the ChIP-Atlas database (chip-atlas.org; Zou et al., 2022). The results were restricted to ChIP-seq experiments in HepG2 wild-type (WT) cells analyzing abundant PTMs and arranged by decreasing TTD peak overlap. The first 10 ChIP-seq data sets with the highest overlap in TTD were plotted and analyzed for fold enrichment of ChIPseq peaks in TTD peaks over randomized controls (Figure 4g and Supplemental File 1). Strikingly, two H3K4me1 tracks from independent laboratories had the highest overall overlap with TTD peaks (73% and 63%, respectively) and more than eightfold enrichment. H3K4me2 tracks completed the top five but showed a smaller overlap of 44% or less, and less significant enrichment. This clearly demonstrates that among all the publicly available data sets for histone ChIP-Seq in HepG2 cells, H3K4me1 peaks have the best correlation to TTD peaks. Unfortunately, no public H3K9me2 ChIP-seq data were found for HepG2 that could be used as independent validation of our own data.\nIn summary, our data demonstrate that binding of GST-tagged UHRF1-TTD to native HepG2 chromatin required H3K9me2/3, with higher affinity for mononucleosomes with double H3K4me1-K9me2/3 modifications, supporting our hypothesis of combined binding of both marks and complementing our peptide-binding data. Moreover, we document the wide occurrence of the H3K4me1-K9me2 double mark in TTD CIDOP and ChIP-western blot experiments."

            "text": "Having established the preferential enrichment of TTD CIDOP in H3K4me1-K9me2 regions from HepG2 chromatin, we wondered which functional role could be attributed to TTD binding of the H3K4me1-K9me2 double mark. It is well known that H3K4me1 marks enhancers, and H3K9me2 has a high abundance and broad distribution (Figure S9b). Using the HepG2-specific 18-state ChromHMM reference data (egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap; Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015), we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of TTD peaks in the different chromatin regions and compared it to randomized controls of equal number and length of peaks (Figure 5a). The enrichment of TTD peaks was high in \u201cEnhancers\u201d (lowest in bivalent enhancers), as well as the regions \u201cFlanking TSS\u201d (upstream or downstream), which include gene promoters. This complements our finding that TTD peaks show significant overlap with H3K4me1 again indicating that K4 methylation has a marked influence on chromatin binding of TTD. Due to the enrichment of TTD peaks in transcriptional start site (TSS) flanking regions, we looked at all the TSSs from the human TSS reference set (refTSS; Abugessaisa et al., 2019) and since UHRF1 participates in DNA methylation, we also included wholegenome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). Using k-means clustering, we identified four clusters that were arranged by decreasing TTD signal (Figure 5b). This heatmap shows all human TSSs with their promoter regions, and in clusters 1 and 2, strong or moderate TTD density was observed, respectively. As expected for promoter regions, WGBS DNA methylation levels were relatively low. Interestingly, in clusters 1 and 2, TTD enrichment corresponds to the WGBS signal, both signals showing minima in the center of the regions (at the position of the TSS) and increase towards the flanks. Conversely, in cluster 3, both TTD and WGBS signals are lower. Clusters 3 and 4 function as control regions, the former containing the unmethylated TSSs and promoters of HepG2 cells, while the latter has most of the TSSs with the highest DNA methylation. The patterns observed in clusters 1 and 2 suggest that TTD binding to the regions flanking TSSs can increase DNA methylation at these sites, in agreement with the welldocumented role of UHRF1 in the deposition of DNA methylation (Bostick et al., 2007; Sharif et al., 2007).\nUsing the ChIP-Enrich webserver (chip-enrich.med. umich.edu), a gene ontology biological process (GO:BP) analysis of the genes from cluster 1 of the TTD promoter binding analysis (Figure 5b) was conducted and revealed\na strong connection to various metabolic processes, as well as response to xenobiotics (Figure 5c; Supplemental File 2), both typical cell-type-specific processes for\nhepatic cells (Arzumanian et al., 2021). Then, we compared gene expression data from HepG2 and primary liver cells and identified genes with \u22652-fold change in\n50% of the ARID5B peaks (clusters 3 and 4). Both show binding sites of DNA-binding cell-type-specific TFs FOXA1 aka HNF3\u03b1 (Gertz et al., 2013), HNF4A (Gertz et al., 2013), and ARID5B (Partridge et al., 2020) and are flanked by H3K4me1-K9me2 and UHRF1-TTD. The center is nucleosome-free as seen by the DNase-seq signal (The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). See also Figure S12e.\nexpression and high expression levels in at least one of the two cell types (Supplemental File 3). We plotted the corresponding TSSs (refTSS) with their flanks, arranged by decreasing TTD signal, and noticed that TSSs with TTD-rich flanks corresponded more frequently to genes downregulated in HepG2 (Figure 5d). Also, we arranged these TSSs according to change of expression, placed them in five bins of equal size and plotted the mean signal of TTD (Figure 5e), revealing that the TTD signal was stronger around TSSs of genes that are most downregulated in HepG2 compared to liver tissue cells, and weaker around TSSs of genes that are upregulated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using Enrichr (maayanlab. cloud/Enrichr; Xie et al., 2021) revealed that the genes robustly downregulated between HepG2 and liver tissue are HepG2 and liver-specific (Figure S12a). These results show a correlation between UHRF1-TTD CIDOP signals on promoter flanks and reduced expression of a set of cell-type-specific genes in HepG2 cells suggesting that these liver-specific genes were downregulated by UHRF1 in the HepG2 cancer cells."

To examine the segmentation results closer, we merged the 189k \u201cEnhancers\u201d of HepG2 cells and plotted a heatmap centered on these, with the marks relevant to our study (Figure 6a). As expected, all regions harbored a strong H3K4me1 signal, and a significant part of them also contained H3K9me2, showing a good correlation with the TTD signal (r 0.76). Direct comparison revealed that the majority of the TTD peaks (82%) are found on 30% of these HepG2-specific enhancers harboring H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 (Figure 6b). We also analyzed the TTD peaks on the ChIP-Enrich webserver (Figure S12b) and determined that 65% of them are located on distal enhancers (10 to >100 kb to TSS) and 29% on upstream enhancers (1\u201310 kb to TSS), in agreement with our segmentation results. While the WGBS signal lacked characteristic TTD-related pattern (Figure S12c), a GO:BP analysis of the enhancer-associated genes showed strong enrichment for processes related to metabolism and regulation of lipids followed by tissue/liver development (Figure 6c, Supplemental File 4). Among the enriched genes, we recognized liver-specific markers (e.g., ALB, ALDOB, and FGA; Arzumanian et al., 2021), as well as transcription factors (TFs) that define liver cell identity\n(e.g., FOXA1 and HNF4A; Horisawa et al., 2020; Supplemental File 4).

Analysis of peak overlap between TTD and TF ChIP-seq data from the ChIP-Atlas database for HepG2 cells (Zou et al., 2022), revealed a strong correlation of TTD to binding sites of cell-type-specific TFs (Figure 6d, Supplemental File 5). Grouping of the most enriched TFs based on their known interaction (thebiogrid.org; Oughtred et al., 2021; Supplemental File 5) revealed the groups of ARID5B, FOXA1/2, MLL3/4, and HNF4A as most relevant TTD targets. Focusing on ARID5B, FOXA1 (aka HNF3\u03b1), and HNF4A, we verified that hUHRF1-TTD binds next to binding sites of celltype-specific TFs in browser views (Figure S12e) and heatmaps (Figure 6e). The ChIP-seq data reveal the DNA-binding TFs are in the center of the TTD-enriched regions, where nucleosomes are evicted, flanked by histone marks and TTD (e.g., cluster 4 of Figure 6e). The colocalization and interactions between these three TFs had been documented previously (Horisawa et al., 2020; Okuno et al., 2013; Partridge et al., 2020). Here, we document the presence of H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 at the flanks of these TF target regions, supporting the notion of a physiological role for this previously undescribed double mark and substantiating TTD binding to it. Moreover, the known interaction of FOXA1/2 with the MLL3/4 complex, that deposits H3K4me1, and HNF4A with G9a, that deposits H3K9me2, as well as with the MLL3/4 complex (Goos et al., 2022; Jozwik et al., 2016) potentially leads to a double mark enhancement and may suggest a read/write mechanism of the H3K4me1-K9me2 double mark, since TF binding to regions containing H3K4me1-K9me2 can recruit writers of H3K4me1 and H3K9me2. In the cellular context, we expect that TTDbased targeting of UHRF1 to enhancers and promoters is subject to additional regulation, given the highly complex regulation of the interacting TFs. Taken together, our data clearly support a role for UHRF1 in differentiation and regulation of cell-type-specific processes, mediated by TTD targeting. Our finding that H3K4me1-K9me2 and\nUHRF1-TTD flank the targets of cell-type-specific TFs in HepG2 cells provides physiological context for this histone double mark, and a potential read/write mechanism via TFs and TTD, while providing an explanation for the previously reported role of UHRF1 in cellular differentiation (Kim et al., 2018; Obata et al., 2014; Ramesh et al., 2016; Sakai et al., 2022; Yamashita et al., 2018)."

The only available full-length UHRF1 ChIP-seq data are from mouse embryonic stem\ncells (mESC). This data set was published in a study that reported a genome-wide correlation of mUHRF1 with H3K4me3, as well as H3K9 methylation, and characterized mUHRF1 as a regulator of cell lineage specification during differentiation (Kim et al., 2018). After reanalysis of public E14 mESC tracks for H3K4me1 (Wu et al., 2016), H3K4me3 (Kim et al., 2018), and these mUHRF1 ChIP-seq data (Kim et al. 2018), we concluded that the distribution of murine UHRF1 was much more similar to H3K4me1 than to H3K4me3 in browser views (Figure 7a). In agreement with these observations, the genome-wide correlation of UHRF1 signal was better for H3K4me1 than for H3K4me3 (r 0.6 vs. 0.4; Figure 7b, Figure S13a). Closer inspection of these data revealed that the log2 plot of the H3K4me3 versus mUHRF1 signal has a bimodal distribution (Figure S13a), indicating that mainly the weaker peaks of H3K4me3 (which are expected to contain H3K4me1 as well) correlate with the UHRF1 signal in mESC, but strong H3K4me3 peaks had no correlation with UHRF1.\nAs the direct interaction of UHRF1-TTD with the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double mark discovered here provides the only known connection of UHRF1 to H3K4me1, we conclude that the correlation of the fulllength murine UHRF1 ChIP-seq data with H3K4me1 strongly suggests that our observations with TTD are highly relevant for the chromatin interaction of fulllength UHRF1 in cellular contexts. Although one specific splicing isoform of murine UHRF1 differs in chromatin binding from the human form (Tauber et al., 2020), the observation of H3K4me1 dependent chromatin interaction for the murine UHRF1 and the human TTD documents that murine and human UHRF1 both bind to H3K4me1-K9me2/3."

Previous work has shown the TTD-dependent gene silencing by UHRF1 (Nady et al., 2011). To assess whether our finding of improved TTD binding to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 has implications for gene regulation, we turned to data published by Kong et al. (2019). Facing the problem of toxicity of UHRF1 KO or KD, the authors generated HCT116 cells stably repressing endogenous UHRF1 with shRNA, which were simultaneously rescued with WT UHRF1 (WT) or a UHRF1-TTD mutant (TTD*) containing a Y188A mutation in the H3K9me2/3 binding pocket that disrupts H3-tail binding (Nady et al., 2011). As internal controls for their microarray gene expression\nanalysis, mock-treated cells transduced with scrambled shRNA and empty vector were used (Figure 7c). Given the narrow dynamic range of the data, we used a modest threshold (jFold Change over Mockj \u2265 1.5) to call differentially regulated genes (DRGs). The rescue with the TTD* mutant UHRF1 affected gene expression, as the WT UHRF1 rescued cells returned fewer DRGs than the TTD* UHRF1 rescued ones (Figure S13b), but the difference was small. To retain a robust gene-set, we first selected the 20,911 genes that did not show an expression change after rescue with WT (when compared to mocktreated cells; Figure S13b). This filters for genes where UHRF1 has no influence on expression or the UHRF1 rescue was fully functional. Among them, 115 were upregulated after TTD* UHRF1 rescue (when compared to mock-treated cells), indicating that the TTD domain is required for their silencing.\nTo investigate a potential connection between DRGs and H3K4me1 levels, we used the gene-specific enhancers from FANTOM5 (Andersson et al., 2014), H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 data from HCT116 cells (Cohen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019), and plotted the mean signal in these regions. The 115 genes upregulated after reconstitution with TTD* UHRF1 were connected to enhancers that carry significantly more H3K4me1 (Figure 7d) and slightly less H3K9me2 than the nonresponsive genes (Figure S13c). The upregulation of these genes after reconstitution with TTD* UHRF1 indicates that they were originally repressed by UHRF1 in a TTDdependent manner (Figure 7e). The better correlation between the H3K4me1-K9me2 double mark and TTDdependent gene silencing than with H3K9me2 alone agrees with all our previous data. Looking at the enhancers of all genes (not just the non-responders after reconstitution with WT UHRF1), we again found a higher H3K4me1 signal and marginal difference in H3K9me2 for the upregulated DRGs (Figure S13d). We conclude that genes with enhancers carrying H3K4me1-K9me2 can be und by UHRF1 via TTD and downregulated (Figure 7e). UHRF1-knock down and rescue with the H3-binding deficient mutant (TTD* UHRF1) de-repressed these genes demonstrating the TTDdependent silencing of H3K4me1-K9me2 containing enhancers by UHRF1. This H3K4me1-dependent effect of human UHRF1 on gene regulation via TTD can only be explained in the context of the H3K4me1-K9me2/3 binding of TTD discovered in our work. It directly demonstrates that H3K4me1-K9me2/3 binding of TTD plays an important role in the cellular activities of full-length UHRF1.\nTaken together, our findings indicate that the interaction of TTD with H3K4me1-K9me2 on enhancers is a driver for the UHRF1-mediated downregulation of the\ncorresponding genes. This directly associates the double mark H3K4me1-K9me2 and its interaction with TTD to a known physiological function of the full-length UHRF1. Our observation that DNA methylation is not detectably different in enhancer regions of HepG2 cells provides evidence that UHRF1 has a direct gene silencing role that is independent of its role in DNA methylation. This agrees with the findings of Kong et al. (2019), that Y188A has minimal effects on DNA methylation."

            "text": "Dissecting the roles and functions of the multidomain UHRF1 protein has not been an easy task in the two decades since its discovery (Fujimori et al., 1998; Hopfner et al., 2000). UHRF1 is an essential chromatin factor needed for global maintenance of DNA methylation (Bostick et al., 2007; Bronner et al., 2019; Mancini et al., 2021; Sharif et al., 2007). It comprises different reading domains interacting with modified histone tails (TTD and PHD) and hemimethylated DNA (SRA), and has catalytic activity as ubiquitin ligase with its RING domain. Exploiting these activities, UHRF1 mediates several connections within the epigenome network and functions as a hub for recruitment of epigenetic effectors with a wide range of cellular functions (Bronner et al., 2019; Mancini et al., 2021). However, even the individual building blocks of this essential master-regulator protein are insufficiently characterized so far. In this study, we discovered the combined H3K4me1-K9me2/3 readout of the UHRF1-TTD reading domain with both synthetic peptides and native nucleosomes. This is an interesting finding underscoring the results of previous reports that UHRF1 can interact with chromatin in different domain arrangements (Jeltsch, 2019; Nady et al., 2011), because in structures of the UHRF1 PHDTTD fragment bound to H3K9me3 peptides, TTD binds H3K9me3 and PHD binds H3R2 while the linker peptide between both domains was observed to block the H3K4me1 binding pocket of TTD identified here (Arita et al., 2012; Rothbart et al., 2013). Indeed, changes in the domain arrangement of full-length UHRF1 upon binding to the LIG1 peptide have been directly observed in SAXS experiments (Kori et al., 2019), and phosphorylation of a linker residue was implicated in altered domain arrangements of UHRF1 as well (Arita et al., 2012). Moreover, the H3K4me1 binding pocket on TTD has been shown to mediate the preferable interaction of full-length UHRF1 with R121 in LIG1 (Ferry et al., 2017; Kori et al., 2019), which has well-documented physiological roles in cells, indicating that this binding site is available in full-length UHRF1 in cells. In vitro data strongly support this, as the\nTTD cleft occupancy by the linker was reported to be approximately 50% (Houliston et al., 2017) indicating that the blocking of the binding cleft by the linker peptide is incomplete.\nUsing TTD mutants, we demonstrated that TTD binding to the H3K4me1-K9me3 peptide makes use of a novel K4me1 recognition process that has two contributing principles. First, it is based on the reduced H-bonding potential of Kme1 when compared to Kme0, and second, on the vdW interactions of the Kme1 methyl group with the methylene groups of an arginine residue in TTD. Strikingly, the E153A TTD mutant showed a 10,000-fold preference for the double-modified peptides, suggesting that conformational changes of TTD that move E153 out of the peptide binding cleft could lead to similar preferences of WT TTD, which could explain the strong H3K4me1-K9me2/3 preferences of TTD observed in our chromatin binding experiments and in literature UHRF1 ChIP-seq data. This finding suggests that conformational changes of UHRF1 mediated by PTMs or binding of other proteins could regulate its binding to double H3K4me1-K9me2/3 versus isolated H3K9m2/3, an interesting model that needs to be further investigated.\nHaving shown preferential TTD binding to HepG2 native nucleosomes carrying H3K4me1-K9me2/3 double modifications, we also show the correlation of available full-length mUHRF1 ChIP-seq profiles to H3K4me1, indicating that our observations are relevant for fulllength UHRF1 chromatin binding in its biological context. On the genome-wide scale, we demonstrate that the H3K4me1-K9me2 double mark is a frequent modification suggesting that it has a specific role. UHRF1-TTD binds to the flanks of gene promoters for cell-type-specific processes and is enriched on the flanks of genes with downregulated expression suggesting an H3K4me1-K9me2/3 dependent repressive role of UHRF1. This agrees with a previous report that UHRF1 binds gene promoters and mediates silencing of the associated genes in cancer cells (Mancini et al., 2021). Moreover, we observed that UHRF1-TTD is enriched in enhancers with a strong connection to genes of cell-type-specific processes and celltype-specific TFs in hepatic cells, in line with reports of UHRF1 involvement in cell-type-specific gene regulation during lineage specification (Kim et al., 2018; Obata et al., 2014; Ramesh et al., 2016; Sakai et al., 2022; Yamashita et al., 2018). Conversely, the enhancers of genes downregulated by full-length hUHRF1 in a TTDdependent manner in HCT116 cells demonstrate an enrichment in H3K4me1-K9me2, indicating that UHRF1 contributes to silencing of genes with H3K4me1-K9me2 marked enhancers. These data again demonstrate the direct relevance of H3K4me1-K9me2 binding by UHRF1-TTD and its physiological function in a cellular\ncontext. However, future studies need to further address the role of H3K4me1 binding by UHRF1 in vivo, for instance, in the UHRF1-mediated repression of tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4A (Boukhari et al., 2015; Thurman et al., 2012).\nOur novel finding of the preferential binding of UHRF1-TTD to H3K4me1-K9me2/3 can also directly explain previous observations of Skvortsova et al. (2019) that the presence of H3K4me1 at CpG island borders predisposes these regions for gain in DNA methylation (Skvortsova et al., 2019). In light of our findings, these data could be explained by an increased recruitment of UHRF1 due to the presence of H3K4me1-K9me2/3 which then triggers acquisition of DNA methylation. Our new data will assist future studies on the functions and effects of UHRF1 to comprehensively describe the multifaceted biological functions of this important chromatin factor, which represents an important node in the epigenome network (Ashraf et al., 2017; Bronner et al., 2019; Mancini et al., 2021) and a known oncogene in liver and other carcinomas (Ashraf et al., 2017; Mudbhary et al., 2014)."

In brief, the pre-processed Lowess normalized log2(Fold Change) ratio matched the corresponding gene name and the median was calculated from the \u22651 probes within each gene. To retain an adequate number of genes, we used a moderate cutoff to call DRGs (median jFCj \u2265 1.5) compared to mock cells."

H3K4me1 and H3K9me2 ChIP-seq data from HCT116 cells (Cohen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019) were retrieved from SRA and processed as described in Section 3.5. For the box plots, the average H3K4me1 signal within each enhancer region was computed using multibigwigSummary, and plotted. For all box plots, the central line is median, box borders are 25th to 75th percentile, and whiskers are 5th to 95th percentile."

For equality of variances on two experimental conditions, we used F test and for p value calculation, we used the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test (H0: difference of means = 0, \u03b1 = 0.05) with or without assumption of equal variances, as appropriate. Significance levels were assigned as follows: n.s. p > 0.05, *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01. For multiple comparisons, p values were calculated using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Michel Choudalakis and Albert Jeltsch devised the study.
