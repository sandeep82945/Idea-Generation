"In conclusion, lutein and its mono-cis isomers were found to be the main carotenoids in the studied flowers. The (9Z)-, (9′Z)- and (13Z)-, (13′Z) isomers of lutein accumulated in approximately equal proportions in all but two of the examined flowers. The Anthemis tinctoria and Helichrysum italicum contained ca. 30% of (9′Z)-lutein, which was probably produced enzymatically. With the exception of the above two flowers and the Rorippa austriaca, the proportion of (9Z)-lutein was higher compared to (9′Z)-lutein. In four of the examined flowers, we could not detect zeaxanthin; thus, these plants could be sources of zeaxanthin-free lutein. It was also established that flowers belonging to different families may have similar carotenoid composition, and probably, that members of the same family can have different carotenoid composition."
