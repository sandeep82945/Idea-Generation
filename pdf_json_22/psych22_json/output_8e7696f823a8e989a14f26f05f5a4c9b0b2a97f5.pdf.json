Recently, Koenig et al. (Applied Psychological Measurement, 44, 311\u2013326, 2020) illustrated in an optimized hierarchical Bayesian two-parameter logistic model (OH2PL) how to avoid bias due to unintended shrinkage or degeneracies of the posterior, and how to benefit from this approach in small samples. The generalizability of their findings, however, is limited because they investigated only a single specification of the hyperprior structure. Consequently, in a comprehensive simulation study, we investigated the robustness of the performance of the novel OH2PL in several specifications of their hyperpriors under a broad range of data conditions. We show that the novel OH2PL in the half-Cauchy or Exponential configuration yields unbiased (in terms of bias) model parameter estimates in small samples of N = 50. Moreover, it outperforms (especially in terms of the RMSE of the item discrimination parameters) marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation and its nonhierarchical counterpart. This further corroborates the possibility that hierarchical Bayesian IRT models behave differently than general hierarchical Bayesian models. We discuss these results regarding the applicability of complex IRT models in small-scale situations typical in psychological research, and illustrate the extended applicability of the 2PL IRT model with an empirical example.",

This hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach is, in theory, beneficial when complex models with many parameters of the same type are to be estimated with sparse data (Betancourt & Girolami, 2015). It makes it possible to use information from all parameters of the same kind to estimate individual parameters, thus maximizing the information contained in a given data set. Therefore, precision in individual parameter estimates is increased, which is typically reflected by narrower 95% highest density intervals (HDIs) compared to parameter estimates obtained\nwith nonhierarchical approaches. The narrower HDIs are the result of a partial pooling process inherent to the hierarchical structure of the prior distributions. As the variance in the individual parameters decreases, their estimates are drawn towards their grand mean, that is, to the mean of their hyperprior distribution (Jackman, 2009).\nThis is also referred to as shrinkage. Because the variance of the model parameter estimates is seldom zero and is inferred from empirical data (Fox, 2010), individual parameter estimates in hierarchical Bayesian models exhibit a certain amount of bias compared to estimates obtained in nonhierarchical approaches. Since the partial pooling process adapts the amount of shrinkage to the variance present in the data, the bias in the model parameters should be negligible as long as the variance components of the parameters are estimated accurately. If the variance components either are under- or overestimated, the amount of shrinkage will be incorrect and lead to biased model parameters (especially in case of underestimated variance components). Thus, the hyperprior distributions for the parameter variances play * Christoph K\u00f6nig koenig@psych.uni-frankfurt.de 1 Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt\u00a0am\u00a0Main, Germany 2 University of\u00a0Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Emden,\nGermany\n1 3\na pivotal role in the performance of hierarchical Bayesian models. Another potential source of bias in hierarchical Bayesian models is caused by the dependencies of the individual parameters with their grand means. These dependencies cause funnel degeneracies, where high-density/lowvolume regions are below low-density/high-volume regions (Betancourt & Girolami, 2015). These regions exhibit considerable changes in the curvature of the posterior distribution. This makes it difficult for the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, which is used to estimate the model parameters, to explore the posterior distribution efficiently (Betancourt, 2017).\nThus, in order to benefit from the hierarchical Bayesian approach, the hyperprior distributions for the parameter variances must be considered carefully. Although in the methodological literature researchers are frequently discouraged from using the inverse Gamma and inverse Wishart distributions (Alvarez et\u00a0al., 2016; Gelman, 2006; Polson & Scott, 2012; Simpson et\u00a0al., 2014), those two distributions are still widely used in Bayesian hierarchical models (e.g., Lu et\u00a0al., 2020; Tijmstra et\u00a0al., 2018). The alternative half-Cauchy and Exponential distributions as priors for variance components have been investigated only recently (Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020; Liu & Yang, 2018; Sheng, 2017). Another aspect that requires careful consideration is the parameterization and complexity of the model at hand. This also applies to item response theory (IRT) models, which are mostly nonlinear and feature many parameters of the same kind, making them ideal candidates for hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Due to their complexity, however, they require rather large sample sizes to obtain accurate person and item parameter estimates, especially when no prior information is available: The two-parameter logistic (2PL) model, for instance, has a recommended sample size of N \u2265 500 (De Ayala, 2009; smaller sample sizes are possible when prior information is available). Hence, the applicability of this frequently used class of models to small-scale situations, as they often occur in psychological research, is limited.\nTo extend the applicability of the 2PL model to small-scale situations, Koenig et\u00a0al. (2020) illustrated a novel, optimized hierarchical two-parameter logistic (OH2PL) IRT model. More recently, Gilholm et\u00a0al. (2021) successfully applied the OH2PL to a six-dimensional case with\u00a0N = 115 students. In the OH2PL, Koenig et\u00a0al. (2020) combined several adjustments with the aim of eliminating bias caused by the choice of the hyperprior distributions and of avoiding the degeneracies of the standard hierarchical 2PL. They showed that it is applicable to situations with 100 respondents. Moreover, the OH2PL outperformed its nonhierarchical counterpart in terms of bias of the item parameter estimates, especially regarding the item discrimination parameters. This is a remarkable finding because it contradicts the theoretical behavior of hierarchical Bayesian models in general. Both results, however, were found only for a single weakly informative specification of the\nvariance-related hyperprior distributions under a small number of carefully selected simulation conditions.\nWhether the findings by Koenig et\u00a0al. (2020) can be generalized to a broader range of data conditions, and beyond a single weakly informative specification of the variance-related hyperprior distributions, is still unclear. The specific focus on the variance-related hyperprior distributions arises from the theoretical proposition that, for complex nonlinear hierarchical models such as IRT models, variance components play a crucial role in the accuracy of item parameter estimates: given partial pooling, the bias in the estimates of variance components relates directly to the bias in the associated item parameter estimates. Moreover, it remains unclear how the non-centered parameterization of the OH2PL responds to different specifications of its variance-related hyperprior distributions.\nConsequently, the primary purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of the OH2PL in terms of parameter estimation accuracy in calibration sample sizes below 500 respondents across different specifications of the hyperprior structure of the OH2PL and a broader range of data conditions. More specifically, we aim to answer the following research question: How sensitive is the bias in the parameter estimates of the OH2PL against different specifications of the half-Cauchy, Exponential, and inverse Gamma hyperprior distributions in different sample sizes and test lengths, as well as different variances and correlations of the item parameters? We consider the performance of the OH2PL to be robust if (a) the model parameter estimates are unbiased and (b) if the conditional bias and RMSE do not distinctively differ across the specifications of the respective hyperprior distribution. Lastly, we illustrate the advantage of the OH2PL with regard to an increased applicability of the 2PL IRT model to suboptimal testing conditions with an empirical example.\nThe answer to this research question adds to the literature in three ways. First, it provides guidance on how to specify the half-Cauchy, Exponential, and inverse Gamma distribution properly as weakly informative hyperpriors for variance components in hierarchical Bayesian IRT models. Second, it provides insights into the relationship between the accuracy of the estimated variance components and the respective item parameter estimates in hierarchical Bayesian IRT models. Third, it provides further evidence for the applicability of the OH2PL in very small calibration sample sizes and for the utility of the hierarchical Bayesian approach to IRT modeling in general.\nThe optimized hierarchical two\u2011parameter logistic IRT model\nLet yij \u2208 {0, 1}\u00a0be the response of person j to item i, and \u03b8j the ability of person j (the person parameter), which is typically assumed to follow a standard normal prior distribution.\n1 3\nMoreover, \u03b1i is the discrimination of item i, and \u03b2i is its difficulty. Let the logit of a function x be defined by\nthen the OH2PL is specified by\nThe novel OH2PL integrates three different adjustments to the common hierarchical specification of the 2PL model. First, it uses a separation strategy regarding the hyperprior distributions for the correlation between the item parameters and their variance components (Barnard et\u00a0al., 2000; Ulitzsch et\u00a0al., 2020). It is based on the Cholesky factor of the correlation matrix of the item parameters\u00a0\u03bei = {log \u03b1i, \u03b2i},\u00a0i = 1, \u2026, I items, and their variance components \u03c4\u03b1 and\u00a0\u03c4\u03b2. This strategy introduces more flexibility for the specification of these hyperprior distributions. Moreover, it eliminates the a priori dependencies between the variance components and the covariances commonly associated with the inverse Wishart specification as the standard distribution for the covariance matrix of the item parameters\u00a0\u03a3\u03be (e.g., Alvarez et\u00a0al., 2016).\nSecond, the OH2PL uses either the half-Cauchy or the Exponential as the hyperprior distribution for the variance components \u03c4\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03b2 of the item parameters, instead of the more commonly applied inverse Gamma distribution. The inverse Gamma distribution has a low mass near zero. It is therefore quite informative even when specified as noninformative and it behaves erratically when the true variance is close to zero (Gelman, 2006). Using either the half-Cauchy or the Exponential distribution eliminates the bias resulting from this erratic behavior (Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020; Polson & Scott, 2012). Thus, using these distributions as hyperprior distributions yields more accurate variance estimates; their accuracy in turn plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the item parameter estimates in hierarchical models.\n(1)logit = exp(x)\n1 + exp(x) ,\n(2)Pr ( yij = 1|\u03b8j, \u03b1i, \u03b2i ) = Bernoulli ( logit [ \u03b1i ( \u03b8j \u2212 \u03b2i )])\n(3)\u03b8j \u223c N(0, 1)\n(4) \u223c\ni \u223c N(0, 1)\n(5)\u03bc\u03b1 \u223c N(0, 1)\n(6)\u03bc\u03b2 \u223c N(0, 2)\n(7)L \u223c LKJ(2)\n(8)\u03c4\u03b1unif ,\u03b2unif \u223c U(0, \u03c0\u22152).\nThird, due to its specific parameterization, the OH2PL does not suffer from two problematic dependencies that are common for hierarchical models, especially for smallsample situations (Betancourt & Girolami, 2015): The cross-level dependency of the item parameters\u00a0\u03bei and their grand means\u00a0 \u03bc\u03be = {\u03bc\u03b1, \u03bc\u03b2}, as well as the correlation between the item parameters. Following Koenig et\u00a0 al. (2020), for each item\u00a0 i,a vector of uncorrelated z-scores\u00a0\u0303\ni =\n(\n\u03031,\u2026 , \u0303I\n)\nis drawn from a standard normal\ndistribution. Each individual vector is then multiplied by the diagonal matrix of the variance components \u039b and the Cholesky factor of the item correlation matrix\u00a0L\u03a9 to obtain the item parameters\u00a0\u03bei, that is,\u00a0\ni =\n(\nL \u0303i\n)T . Two addi-\ntional transformations, \u03b1i = exp(\u03bc\u03b1 + \u03be\u03b1i) and\u00a0\u03b2i = \u03bc\u03b2 + \u03be\u03b2i, leave only the uncorrelated person parameters\u00a0\u03b8j and a vector of uncorrelated z-scores\u00a0 \u223c\ni as actively sampled substantial parameters, yielding a joint posterior that is much easier to explore and that results in a more efficient sampling process (Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020). In the current version of the OH2PL, we introduce an additional optimization related to the hyperpriors for the variance components \u03c4\u03b1 and\u00a0\u03c4\u03b2. With respect to sampling efficiency, the Cauchy distribution may be problematic due to its heavy tails. Thus, instead of sampling the variance components directly, we introduce auxiliary parameters \u03c4\u03b1unif and\u00a0\u03c4\u03b2unif with lower and upper bounds of zero and\u00a0\u03c0/2, respectively. We sample these auxiliary parameters from a uniform distribution\u00a0U(0, \u03c0/2), and transform them to the actual variance components by\u00a0\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 = 2.5 ( tan ( \u03c4\u03b1unif , \u03c4\u03b2unif ))\n, where tan is the tangent\u00a0 (see also Stan Development Team, 2022). The transformation in this example implies a half \u2212 Cauchy(0,2.5) hyperprior on the variance components. A similar transformation is available if we want to use the Exponential distribution. In this case, the aforementioned auxiliary parameters are sampled from a U(0, 1) distribution and transformed into the actual variance components by \u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 = 2.5 ( \u2212 log ( \u03c4\u03b1unif , \u03c4\u03b2unif ))\n, implying an Exponential(2.5) hyperprior.\nLastly, L\u03a9 is given a\u00a0\u00a0LKJ \ufffd L \ufffd\u03b7 \ufffd = \u220fK k=2 L K\u2212k+2\u03b7\u22122 kk prior distribution with shape parameter\u00a0\u03b7 > 0, where k is the number of dimensions of the K \u00d7 K lower triangular Cholesky factor (Lewandowski et\u00a0al., 2009). As\u00a0\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, extreme correlations become less likely. The parameter \u03b7 provides direct control over how closely the sampled matrix resembles the identity matrix (Stan Development Team, 2020). Setting \u03b7 = 2 results in a weakly informative prior distribution that slightly favors smaller correlations. The prior specifications in (5) and (6) represent specifications for item discrimination and difficulty parameters commonly found in the literature on hierarchical Bayesian IRT models (e.g., Levy & Mislevy, 2016)."

We chose sample sizes and test lengths that mimic testing conditions where accurate item parameter estimates would generally be difficult to obtain (Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020; Sheng, 2017).\nWe manipulated the variance components and the correlations to examine the performance of the OH2PL in typical and atypical data conditions. We selected the variance components to reflect small (\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 = {0.10, 0.40}), typical (\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 = {0.25, 0.90}), and extreme (\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 = {0.75, 1.50}) variances in the item parameters. The rationale for choosing these variance levels, and considering them as small, typical, and extreme, is as follows. In operational applications of IRT models for dichotomously scored items, item discrimination and difficulty parameters typically fall in a relatively narrow range. For instance, item discriminations typically fall in the interval\u00a0[0.5, 3.0], while item difficulties are typically found\nto be in the interval [\u22124, 4] (e.g., OECD, 2021). Parameter values outside of these intervals are seldom observed for latent traits with typical variance. This also restricts the variance of the item parameters: for instance, the variance components of the item discrimination and difficulty parameters of the 2018 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) \u2013 a worldwide study to evaluate educational systems and relying on IRT \u2013 were mostly smaller than 0.4 and 1.0, respectively (cf. OECD, 2021). Thus, the levels of the variance components connect to item characteristics of operational IRT applications. The selected correlations reflect independent and correlated item parameters. Regarding the hyperprior distributions for the variance components, we focused on weakly informative and noninformative specifications, relative to the generating values for\u00a0\u03c4\u03b1\u00a0and\u00a0\u03c4\u03b2 (see Table\u00a01).\nThe rationale for selecting weakly and non-informative prior distribution follows Gelman (2009) who argues that regularization of parameters is necessary when working with complex hierarchical models in small sample situations. Weakly informative prior distributions strike a balance between unwarranted influences on the posterior distribution, while at the same time avoiding unrealistic parameter values that may have detrimental effects on the sampling behavior and unwanted effects on the posterior (which may be the case for non-informative prior distributions).\nThe different specifications of the prior distributions under investigation differ in their range of uncertainty around the plausible values of the variance components (Gelman & Hill, 2007); this range of uncertainty increases when moving from the weakly to the non-informative specifications considered in this simulation. We aimed at including a relatively broad range of possible specifications. The choice of their specific hyperparameters is based on previous comparisons, recommendations and use-cases\n1 3\nfound in the methodological literature (e.g., B\u00fcrkner, 2021; Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020; Luo & Jiao, 2018; Natesan et\u00a0al., 2016; R\u00f6ver et\u00a0al., 2021; Sheng, 2017), with a focus on the comparability of the resulting densities. Please note that due to its low mass near zero, it is inherently difficult to specify inverse Gamma distributions that are fully comparable to the half-Cauchy and Exponential distributions. We included, however, specifications that are approximately comparable and that are used in methodological and empirical studies (e.g., Depaoli et\u00a0al., 2021; Gardini et\u00a0al., 2021; Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020; Matzke et\u00a0al., 2018; Sheng, 2017; Smid & Rosseel, 2020; Smid & Winter, 2020). Lastly, we did not focus exclusively on the commonly used highly noninformative specifications of the inverse Gamma distribution, because they are already known to be problematic (Gelman, 2006; R\u00f6ver et\u00a0al., 2021). Illustrations of the different densities are included in\u00a0the electronic supplementary material in\u00a0the OSF respository (Supplement 1).\nIn total, 864 conditions were examined across the five simulation factors. To provide a complete picture of the robustness of the OH2PL, we compared its performance with its nonhierarchical counterpart, its more common inverse Wishart specification (e.g., Levy & Mislevy, 2016), and with MML estimation, which is implemented in most modern non-Bayesian IRT modeling software packages."

            "text": "The generation of data aimed to yield parameter values typically found in operational tests based on the unidimensional 2PL model and to avoid unrealistic item discriminations and item difficulties. We used the following procedure to achieve this.\nFirst, for each item\u00a0i, a parameter vector \u03bei was drawn from a truncated bivariate normal distribution with grand mean vector\u00a0\u03bc\u03be = {1, 0}, lower limits LL = {0.65, \u22124.5} and upper limits\u00a0UL = {4.0,4.5}, and diagonal matrix\u00a0\u03c4, resulting in the auxiliary matrix\u00a0Z. Second, the parameter matrix \u039e with the desired variances and correlations was obtained by\u00a0 = S L\u22121\nS L , where S is the covari-\nance matrix of Z, L\u22121 S is the inverse of the Cholesky factor of S, and L\u03a3 is the Cholesky factor of the population covariance matrix\u00a0\u03a3 = \u03c4\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0\u03c4T, with \u03c4 being a diagonal matrix of the variance components and \u03a9 being the population correlation matrix. Lastly, the generating item parameters were obtained by mean centering each column of\u00a0\u039e and adding the true (marginal) means of the truncated bivariate normal distribution, which ensured that the grand means of the item parameters\u00a0\u03bc\u03be were correct. This procedure generated item parameters in the ranges of 0.5 < \u03b1i < 3.5 and \u22124 < \u03b2i < 4 with the desired grand means, variances, and correlations. Person\nparameters were drawn from a standard normal distribution\u00a0\u03b8j~N(0, 1), yielding a 99% CI\u00a0[\u22123.11, 3.11]. For each of the 864 simulation conditions, 100 data sets were generated. Different sets of item and person parameters were drawn for each data set.\nThe standard inverse Wishart H2PL was specified with \u03b8 j~N(0, 1), \u03bei~MVN(\u03bc\u03be, \u03a3), \u03bc\u03b1~N(0, 1), \u03bc\u03b2~N(0, 2), and\u00a0\u03a3~IW(3, I), where I is the identity matrix. The nonhierarchical 2PL was specified with\u00a0\u03b8j~N(0, 1),\u00a0\u03b1i~logN(0, 1), and\u00a0\u03b2i~N(0, 2). These prior configurations are widely used in Bayesian IRT modeling, and represent common ways to specify the 2PL hierarchically and nonhierarchically (e.g., Fox, 2010; Levy & Mislevy, 2016).\nTo estimate the Bayesian models, Stan (Carpenter et\u00a0al., 2017) and its R interface RStan were used (see Jiang & Carter, 2019, for benefits of Stan other than flexibility in prior specification). Three chains, each 4000 iterations long, with 1000 burn-in cycles were set up. Different random starting values were supplied to each chain. Convergence was assessed using the Gelman\u2013Rubin R-statistic (Gelman & Rubin, 1992), where R < 1.05 indicated convergence. There was no systematic clustering of non-convergent solutions (non-convergence rate smaller than ten percent) except for the second non-informative specification of the half-Cauchy distribution (NI2, cf. Table\u00a01). Here, the non-convergence rate ranged between 18% and 36% across all design factors (sample size, test length, correlation, and variance components). This illustrates the theoretically expected problem of the half-Cauchy distribution: in non-informative specifications, it allows for very large values; thus, it is more likely for the sampler to be stuck in regions with low probability mass. This leads to sampling inefficiencies and convergence issues. In contrast, both the Exponential and the inverse Gamma distribution yield estimates that are more conservative. The higher convergence rate of these distributions, even in non-informative specifications, reflects this behavior. For the MML estimation of the model, the R package mirt was used (Chalmers, 2012). To compare the resulting item parameter estimates, they were transformed from slope/intercept to classical IRT parameterization. Here, inadmissible solutions systematically clustered in the extreme variance conditions. Here, the rate ranged between 10% and 99%; the proportion of inadmissible solutions was highest in case of a sample size of N = 50 for both test lengths (range between 75% and 89%). Additionally, MML estimation produced a number of solutions that apparently converged but produced negative item discriminations. These solutions clustered in conditions with small sample sizes (N < 100); their proportion ranged between 11% and 25%). Non-convergent (in case of the Bayesian models) and inadmissible (in case of MML estimation) were discarded and not used for the calculation of the results.\n1 3"

It made no difference whether weakly informative or non-informative specifications were used. In contrast, in case of the inverse Gamma distribution, the average bias in the item discriminations was highly dependent of the specification of the prior.

The average bias depended on the specification for all three hyperprior distributions, and the variance\n1 3\ncomponent was overestimated, especially in sample sizes smaller than\u00a0N < 100.

Moreover, the superior performance was independent of the specification of the half-Cauchy or Exponential distribution.

It has to be noted, however, that the performance of the inverse Gamma distribution in case of the item discriminations, especially when the true variance is small, was relatively sensitive to its specification. Neither test length nor correlation had a distinct impact on the RMSE of the estimated item parameters. Lastly, as can be seen by the inflated standard errors of the RMSE estimates, the MML estimation had severe convergence issues in smaller sample sizes and when the true variance components of the item parameters were extreme.\nLastly, as shown in Fig.\u00a07, there were only marginal differences between MML estimation and the OH2PL regarding the average RMSE of the person parameters\u00a0\u03b8 when \u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b2 were either small or typical.

These simulations focused on two specific aspects. First, we wanted to investigate the performance of the OH2PL relative to the other model specifications when the average item difficulties did not match the average person ability. This is a common situation in psychological research and may have an impact on model performance. Overall, the results of the first supplementary simulation showed that shifts in the difficulty distribution against the ability distribution had no impact on the performance of the different configurations of the OH2PL. Second, we aimed at providing further insights by investigating the performance of the OH2PL relative to the other model specifications when following a fixed item parameter approach, with a special focus on the item discrimination parameter. Overall, the results of the second supplementary simulation showed that the OH2PL provided item discrimination estimates that were largely unbiased across the whole range of possible discrimination values when the sample size was at least\u00a0N = 100.

This exam tested in how far the students have acquired skills and knowledge covered by a lecture on the fundamentals of empirical research methods in psychology within the\n1 3\npsychology bachelor\u2019s program at a German university. The exam consisted of I = 27 items administered to N = 80 students in the summer term 2021.\nThus, the number of students was well below the sample size recommended for estimating the 2PL IRT model. Moreover, in fact, the exam data had been calibrated using\n1 3\nthe Rasch model so far, even though this meant limiting the amount of information compared to IRT models with discrimination parameters. The average difficulty of the items was \u03b2 = \u22122.13 , and three items had a probability of a correct response higher than 90% (there was one item\nthat every student answered correctly). In sum, it was a relatively easy exam, but from an estimation point of view, it nicely represented suboptimal testing conditions and therefore was a very good situation to exemplify the potential of the OH2PL.\n1 3\nWe compared the item parameters obtained from the OH2PL in its second weakly informative Exponential configuration (\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b2\u00a0~\u00a0Exp(0.4)) to the item parameters obtained from the inverse Wishart specification, its Bayesian nonhierarchical counterpart, and obtained from MML estimation. Neither the hierarchical nor the non-hierarchical estimates showed any convergence issues: the Gelman-Rubin R-statistics of all parameters were close to one, and their effective sample sizes were well over 400 (Zitzmann & Hecht, 2019). There were serious convergence issues with MML estimation, however. We had to change the optimizer and to introduce additional information via a lognormal prior for the discrimination parameter of the first item to avoid a negative discrimination and to achieve convergence.\nTable\u00a02 illustrates the item parameters obtained with the three approaches. It is obvious that, although it converged, the MML solution was not admissible mostly because of the response patterns at the boundary (the number of near perfect response patterns was too large). The average discrimination of the OH2PL was\u00a0\u03b1 = 1.29 (SD = 0.77), of the inverse Wishart specification \u03b1 = 1.27 (SD = 0.71), and of the non-hierarchical 2PL \u03b1 = 1.52 (SD = 1.24). The average difficulty of the OH2PL was\u00a0\u03b2 = \u22122.13 (SD = 0.45), of the inverse Wishart specification \u03b2 = \u22122.12 (SD = 0.45), and of the non-hierarchical 2PL \u03b2 = \u22121.95 (SD = 0.78). Especially the pattern regarding the discrimination was quite similar to the results of our simulation for the extreme variance component. Thus, it was possible that the average item discrimination of the non-hierarchical 2PL was inflated due to the items with extreme response patterns; the OH2PL (and the inverse Wishart specification) were able to avoid this inflation due to shrinkage. Also, note that the average item difficulty of the OH2PL model matched the average difficulty of the Rasch-calibrated items. In sum, this empirical example illustrated how the OH2PL extended the applicability of the 2PL IRT model to suboptimal testing conditions: together with the inverse Wishart specification, it was better able to handle extreme response patterns, which are more likely in smaller samples, by shrinking extreme parameter estimates towards their grand means, thus avoiding inflated estimates. Hence, test administrators can keep certain items in an item bank after initial calibration and may recalibrate them as new response data becomes available."

This supports and complements Gelman (2006), Polson and Scott (2012), and more recently Sheng (2017), who all recommended distributions from the half-t family as reasonable hyperprior distributions for variance components in hierarchical Bayesian (IRT) models. Using these distributions resolves the restrictive nature of the inverse Gamma distribution near zero by allowing either small or large variance components. The smaller advantage of the half-Cauchy or Exponential configuration of the OH2PL in the case of extreme variance components (and \u03c4\u03b2 in general) can be explained by the larger variances of the item discrimination and difficulty parameters in these conditions. Because the inverse Gamma distribution is problematic especially in cases when the variance is near zero (Gelman, 2006), the larger variances allow this distribution to perform better. The similar or better performance of the inverse Gamma distribution observed for extreme variances, and \u03c4\u03b2 in general, is expected; when the variance component increases and moves away from zero, it moves into the highest density regions of the inverse Gamma distribution, and away from regions with very low probability mass. Therefore, the bias due to the true value lying outside the highest density region of the inverse Gamma distribution should be smaller. This essentially implies that if the typical value of a variance component is known to be sufficiently large, there is nothing against using the inverse Gamma distribution as hyperprior for the variance components, potentially helping in case of convergence problems with the Cauchy/Exponential distributions. Nevertheless, it remains sensitive to its specification, albeit to a lesser extent than in case of small or typical variances.\nMoreover, our results show that when the variance components of the item parameters are large (more specifically, extreme in case of the item discriminations and typical/extreme in case of the item difficulties), the inverse Wishart distribution performs similar and even better than the alternative distributions and model specifications, both in terms of bias and RMSE. This indicates that the inverse Wishart distribution may be a viable alternative under these conditions, and contradicts the frequent\n1 3\ndiscouragement about its use in the literature (e.g., Gelman, 2006). The criticism is because in case of the inverse Wishart distribution, there are a-priori dependencies between the entries of the covariance matrix, i.e., between the variance components, and the variance components and correlations (Alvarez et\u00a0al., 2016; Liu et\u00a0al., 2016). Thus, the inverse Wishart distribution is likely to be highly informative in its standard diffuse specification and may lead to biased parameter estimates in case of large correlations and small variance components, and small correlations in connection with large variance components (Liu et\u00a0al., 2016). Moreover, as the marginal distribution for the variance components is inverse Gamma, the inverse Wishart performs worse when the true variance component is near zero (Alvarez et\u00a0al., 2016). Both characteristics make it likely to introduce unintended information into the analysis, which may lead to biased model parameters\n(Liu et\u00a0al., 2016; Tokuda et\u00a0al., 2012). Even though the typical/extreme variance components and correlations considered in this study do not point directly to such problems, the OH2PL provides increased control of the actual amount of information that is introduced into the analysis, and therefore should be preferred.\nIn sum, based on our results, we recommend using either the half-Cauchy or the Exponential distribution as hyperprior for the variance components, although the inverse Gamma distribution remains a viable prior choice if we know that the true variance component is sufficiently large. Their robust performance across specifications further allows for an increased flexibility and control when specifying prior distributions for variance components in hierarchical models. Since the differences in performance criteria are largely negligible, researchers will be able to focus on other criteria for choosing a specification.

We could show that there is nothing against using a more weakly informative specification of the half-Cauchy or Exponential distribution that aids convergence and sampling efficiency.\nThis is corroborated by the performance of the OH2PL regarding the bias in the estimated item and person parameters. Estimates of the item discrimination and the item difficulty estimates remained relatively unbiased across all simulation conditions, with clear advantages compared to the nonhierarchical 2PL and MML estimation in terms of RMSE. Although there was a slight increase in bias in the case of extreme variances, the average bias remained relatively small. This increase may be due to the underestimation of the respective variance components, as shrinkage towards the item parameter grand means should increase only when the variance in the individual parameters either decrease or is underestimated. This results in bias, because the true variance is actually larger, and the individual parameter estimates should not shrink towards their grand mean. It seems, however, that the underestimation of the variance components was small enough to cause no distinct bias in the individual parameter estimates. Thus, this suggests some flexibility with respect to the required accuracy of the elements of the variance-covariance matrix to obtain unbiased item parameters, and sheds new light on the theoretical relation between the variance components and the item parameter estimates in Bayesian hierarchical models.\nThe fact that the OH2PL outperformed its nonhierarchical counterpart provides a further indication that hierarchical Bayesian IRT models behave differently than hierarchical Bayesian models in general (cf. Koenig et\u00a0al., 2020). From a theoretical point of view, bias in individual parameter estimates should always be slightly larger in the hierarchical model, due to the variance-dependent shrinkage effect. In the OH2PL, this was not the case. Another aspect that suggests the possibility of different behavior is the fact that the average bias in the item parameter estimates did not increase with an increasing variance component (at least for small and typical variances, and for the bias in the item difficulty estimates). Thus, the assumption of the different behavior of hierarchical Bayesian IRT models warrants further investigation.\nWe have to consider three limitations of the current study that open up pathways for further research on this topic. First, the half-Cauchy distributions exhibits convergence issues especially in its non-informative specification. It is possible, however, to apply a transformation based on the hyperbolic tangent function where the variance component is sampled from a uniform distribution bounded by zero and\u00a0\u03c0/2\u00a0(as illustrated\u00a0in the Introduction; Stan Development Team, 2022). As we did not implement this transformation in our design, it might be\nuseful to investigate whether and how this transformation affects the convergence rate of the half-Cauchy distribution. Second, our results imply that both the inverse Gamma and inverse Wishart distributions may still be viable choices for hyperpriors in case (1) the variance components in question are sufficiently large and (2) the correlation falls into a certain range. Our simulation design, however, does not allow determining the critical values of the variance components and correlation. Here, we would need a more fine-grained resolution of the design, especially with respect to the true values of the variance components of the item discrimination parameters and the correlation between the item parameters. We will address this question in a future study. Third, in a similar vein, the current simulation design does not allow answering the question of the differential behavior of Bayesian hierarchical IRT models conclusively. This requires an extended and more fine-grained resolution of the design. We will address this question in a future study as well.\nSummarizing, we showed that the performance of the OH2PL in its half-Cauchy or Exponential configuration is largely independent of the specification of the hyperprior distributions. This further strengthens the claim that the hierarchical Bayesian approach renders the 2PL IRT model applicable to small-sample situations that are typical in psychological research. In conditions with relatively few items and fewer than 100 respondents, where the estimation of item parameter variance is typically problematic because of sparse data, the OH2PL yields unbiased item and person parameter estimates. Moreover, as described in the Data Generation and Analysis section and further illustrated in our empirical example, the OH2PL shows fewer issues with convergence and inadmissible solutions compared to MML estimation. It does not need adjustments in the case of perfect response patterns. This shows that we can apply this state-of-the-art technique confidently across a broad range of empirical studies in which tests are used and that it presents resource-efficient possibilities for accurate item calibration under suboptimal assessment conditions.\nCode availability The code generated and used for the current study are available in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository, https:// doi. org/ 10. 17605/ osf. io/ m3zaq.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.
