    "abstractText": "In this work, seven Citrus aurantium essential oils (EOs) derived from flavedo of cultivars \u2018Canaliculata\u2019, \u2018Consolei\u2019, \u2018Crispifolia\u2019, \u2018Fasciata\u2019, \u2018Foetifera\u2019, \u2018Listata\u2019, and \u2018Bizzaria\u2019 were investigated. EOs were also combined in 1:1 (v/v) ratio to identify possible synergism or antagonism of actions. GC-MS analysis was done to investigate Eos\u2019 phytochemical profiles. The antioxidant activity was studied by using a multi-target approach based on FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, and \u03b2-carotene bleaching tests. A great difference was observed in EOs\u2019 phytochemical profiles. D-limonene (33.35\u201389.17%) was the main monoterpene hydrocarbon, and \u03b1-Pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, and \u03b2-linalool were identified in almost all samples. Among EOs, only C3 showed high quantitative and qualitative variability in its chemical composition. The chemical diversity of EOs was also demonstrated by PCA and HCA statistical analysis. Samples C2, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were statistically similar to each other, while C1 and C3 were characterized as having a different amount of other compounds and oxygenated monoterpenes, respectively, with respect to the other EOs mentioned. The global antioxidant score (GAS) revealed that among the tested EOs, C. aurantium \u2018Fasciata\u2019 EO had the highest antioxidant potential, with a GAS value of \u22120.47, whereas among combinations, the EO obtained by mixing \u2018Canaliculata\u2019 + \u2018Bizzaria\u2019 was the most active. Comparison by theoretical and real data on inhibitory concentration (IC50) and FRAP values did not reveal any significant effect of synergism or antagonism of actions to be valid in all biological applied tests. These findings, considered together, represent an important starting point to understand which compounds are responsible for the activities and their future possible industrial application.",

            "text": "Citrus aurantium L., known as bitter or sour orange, belongs to the Rutaceae family (order Sapindales), and its genus is native to a wide area covering Asia (from India to northern China) and Oceania (Queensland, Australia) [1]. Its origin can probably be placed between southern China, northern Burma, and north-east India [2]. It is marketed and planted in tropical and temperate areas such as France, Spain, Italy, and North Africa [3]. C. aurantium originates as a natural hybrid between a pure male mandarin (C. reticulata\nMolecules 2022, 27, 1580. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27051580 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nBlanco) and pummelo (C. maxima Burm. F.) Merr. [1,4]. Italy and Spain are responsible for 80% of European Citrus production [5]. In Sicily, an average of 34% of Citrus fruits, predominantly orange, are processed into juices, providing about half of its weight as waste, which reaches 24.3 million tons per year [6\u20138]. The wastes deriving from Citrus processing (peels and seeds in primis) are an important part, and various papers have shown that by recycling and using these parts, bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, limonoids, terpenoids, and minerals can be obtained [9\u201311]. The flavedo of Citrus fruits is largely used to produce essential oils (EOs), which are exploited in both the food and cosmetic fields. Overall, the chemical composition and concentration of constituents of these hydro-distillates is varied and is influenced by climate, irrigation, maturation, and soil composition [12\u201317]. The predominant compound is almost always D-limonene, followed by other monoterpenes such as linalool, \u03b2-myrcene, and \u03b1-terpineol. In fact, a study carried out on the peel essential oil of a Croatian accession of C. aurantium, obtained by hydro-distillation and cold press method, identified twenty-two components, with limonene as a dominant compound in both hydro-distillated and cold press essential oil [18]. On the other hand, essential oil obtained from the flowers of C. aurantium was characterized by a minor amount of limonene and by moderate presence of E-nerolidol, \u03b1-terpineol, and \u03b1-terpinyl acetate [19], whereas the essential oils from the leaves were shown to be particularly rich in linalool, linalyl acetate, and \u03b1-terpineol [20]. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have investigated the C. aurantium fruits, seeds, leaves, flowers, and essential oils\u2019 biological properties including antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anxiolytic, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammatory activities [8,18\u201322]. Due to the abundance of health-giving secondary metabolites, C. aurantium is used for the treatment of several ailments, such as anxiety, cancers, gastrointestinal disorders, and obesity [23\u201326]. Moreover, Citrus EOs, due their antioxidant potential, are also used to protect foods from rancidity and/or deterioration of the nutritional quality, loss of color and flavor, alteration of texture, and auto-oxidation process. It is estimated that half of the world\u2019s fruit and vegetable crops are lost due to post-harvest oxidative deteriorative reactions [27]. In this context, the chemical composition of EOs from different Sicilian cultivars, including C. aurantium \u2018Canaliculata\u2019 (C1), \u2018Consolei\u2019 (C2), \u2018Crispifolia\u2019 Risso & Poit. (C3), \u2018Fasciata\u2019 Risso & Poit. (C4), \u2018Foetifera\u2019 (C5), \u2018Listata\u2019 (C6), and \u2018Bizzaria\u2019 (C7) (Figure 1), and their combinations (1:1 v/v) were investigated by GC-MS analysis. The phytochemical diversity of the cultivars was demonstrated by HCA and PCA statistical analysis. Moreover, EOs and their combinations have been assessed for their potential antioxidant activities using different in vitro assays (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, and \u03b2-carotene bleaching test).

            "text": "Hydro-distillation of flavedo gave yellow-orange oils. Overall, twenty compounds were identified and listed in Table 1 according to their retention indices on a DB-5MS non-polar column and classified into five classes: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, and other compounds. Analyzing results, a possible division of the cultivars into two classes emerged: a cluster consisting of C. aurantium C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, and C7 samples, and a separate cultivar C3. The macro-group are essentially characterized by monoterpene hydrocarbons, with the majority compound D-limonene present in a variable percentage between 76.00 and 89.17%. Among the other monoterpenes belonging to this class, and present in all the cultivars, \u03b1-pinene (1.49\u20133.01%) and \u03b2-myrcene (1.00\u20137.52%) were found. On the other hand, \u03b2linalool (1.03\u20132.67%) is the only oxygenated monoterpene present unanimously in all these cultivars, and furthermore, these samples are characterized by the absence of sesquiterpenes, both hydrocarbon and oxygenated. Finally, only the C1 and C4 samples showed detectable quantities of the two aldehydes n-octanal (1.35\u20133.77%) and n-decanal (2.07%). The C3 sample differs enormously from the remaining samples analyzed. In the latter sample, D-limonene was present in high quantities, but much lower when compared with all the other EOs. The majority class is that of oxygenated monoterpenes (44.79%), enriched by the presence of \u03b2-linalool (7.69%), \u03b1-terpineol (7.06%), bergamol (6.77%), and geranyl acetate (10.12%). It is the only oil that showed the presence of hydrocarbon and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, while the alcohol n-octanol (1.59%) and the ester n-decyl acetate (1.44%) emerged in the class of other compounds. Analyzing data reported in the literature [18,22,23,28], D-limonene remains in all cases the major compound (87.00\u201395.57%) extractable by hydro-distillation from the flavedo of C. aurantium. Furthermore, all EOs are characterized by a good quantity of \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, and \u03b2-linalool. EOs investigated by Farahmandfar et al. [29] were among the few EOs showing the presence of sesquiterpenes such as caryophyllene, germacrene D, and trans-nerolidol, as well as alcohol and aldehydes such as n-octanol, n-octanal, and n-decanal, respectively. In this case as well, however, the majority compound was the monoterpene D-limonene. Most likely, an incomplete maturation in our specimen of C. aurantium C3 caused this clear quantitative difference of limonene compared to all the other cultivars studied. Previously, Tundis et al. [30] reported the phytochemical profile of C. aurantium EO from Calabria and found a similar pattern as that found in our samples. In fact, flavedo oil contained limonene, although to a lesser extent (65.8%), followed by \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b1-pinene, linalool, and linalyl acetate. On the contrary, Abderrezak et al. [31] identified 32 compounds representing 96% of total oil content in C. aurantium flavedo EO from Algeria. This oil is dominated by linalool (12.0%), trans-carveol (11.9%), cis-linalool oxide (8.1%), and carvone (5.8%). These qualitative and quantitative differences in oil compositions depended on various factors such as genotype, season, maturational stage, and pedoclimatic factors that occur in the location of the plant\u2019s origins [28]. Table S1 shows the composition of the combinations obtained by mixing equivolumetric quantities of the seven C. aurantium cultivars EOs. The different samples, from C1C2 to C6C7, were obtained by mixing two oils in equal parts; only the sample \u2018mix\u2019 (C1 + C2+ C3 + C4 + C5 + C6 + C7) was obtained for equal miscibility of the EOs extracted from the seven cultivars. The GC-MS analysis confirmed for almost all the samples, except for C1C3, C2C3, C3C4, C3C5, C3C6, and C3C7, the massive presence of compounds belonging to the class of monoterpene hydrocarbons, with a high percentage of D-limonene. Sesquiterpenes, both oxygenated and hydrocarbon, were not detected.\nAll these combinations were also characterized by varying amounts of oxygenated monoterpenes, a group that was exceeded by \u03b2-linalool first and by \u03b1-terpineol afterwards. Only the samples C2C5, C2C6, C2C7, C5C6, C5C7, and C6C7 were devoid of organic compounds belonging to the O class. All the other samples, influenced by the presence of EO coming from C. aurantium \u2018Crispifolia\u2019 (C3), showed a lower quantity of monoterpene hydrocarbons and an enrichment of oxygenated monoterpenes, including volatile compounds such as \u03b2-linalool, \u03b1-terpineol, bergamol, and geranyl acetate. Furthermore, the peculiarity of these mixtures lies in the presence of sesquiterpenes, both oxygenated and hydrocarbon structures, with a percentage varying between 2.13 and 2.33%."

A definite macro-group \u2018B\u2019, containing the samples C2, C4, C5, C6, C7, C2C4, C2C5, C2C6, C2C7, C4C5, C4C6, C4C7, C5C6, C5C7, and C6C7, was characterized by single EO and some mixes with a large percentage of monoterpene hydrocarbons (84.36\u201397.41%), by the absence of both oxygenated and hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes, and by the minimal (maximum 1.35% only for C4 EO) presence and/or absence of compounds belonging to the O class. Finally, the C2C3, C3C4, C3C5, C3C6, and C3C7 samples can be grouped in cluster \u2018C\u2019, due to the influence of the C3 EO. This cluster was characterized by a good quantity of MH (59.91\u201367.95%), but, compared to the other two groups \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, it had a moderate amount of OM (22.42\u201327.13%), and a small presence of SH and OS (2.13\u20132.33% and 2.25\u20132.33%, respectively). Sample C1C3 cannot be included in this \u2018C\u2019 cluster due to the content\u2014not excessive, but significant\u2014of other compounds (O) (4.64%, compared to the range 1.53\u20132.36% in the other samples). Furthermore, the choice of a cut-off of 1.8 would have significantly decreased the similarity between the samples analyzed, leading to an incorrect grouping.

Finally, the C2C3, C3C4, C3C5, C3C6, and C3C7 samples can be grouped in cluster \u2018C\u2019, due to the influence of the C3 EO. This cluster was characterized by a good quantity of MH (59.91\u201367.95%), but, compared to the other two groups \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, it had a moderate amount of OM (22.42\u201327.13%), and a small presence of SH and OS (2.13\u20132.33% and 2.25\u20132.33%, respectively). Sample C1C3 cannot be included in this \u2018C\u2019 cluster due to the content\u2014not excessive, but significant\u2014of other compounds (O) (4.64%, compared to the range 1.53\u20132.36% in the other samples). Furthermore, the choice of a cut-off of 1.8 would have significantly decreased the similarity between the samples analyzed, leading to an incorrect grouping. The others two samples, C1 and C3\u2014which were first for the significant quantity of other compounds (5.84%), and second for the greatest presence of OM (44.79%) and MH (36.21%), respectively\u2014were considered as two separate classes, without any similarity with the other clusters. On the other hand, the mix C1C2C3C4C5C6C7, can be considered as an intermediate sample between clusters \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, but with small characteristics (the content of SH, OS, and OM) referred to cluster \u2018C\u2019.\n2.3. Antioxidant Activity The antioxidant activity of seven C. aurantium flavedo EOs and their mixes were\ninvestigated using different tests.

A promising ABTS radical scavenging potential was observed also w th EO C6 and C4 (IC50 values of 27.38 and 27.45 \u00b5g/mL, respectively) (Table 2). The same samples are also the most active in protection from lipid peroxidation, with IC50 values of 15.46 and 18.56 \u00b5g/mL for C4 and C6, respectively. EOs obtained from \u2018Fasciata\u2019 and \u2018Listata\u2019 cultivar have FRAP values comparable to the positive control BHT (55.92 and 50.23 \u00b5M Fe2+/g for C3 and C5, respectively, vs 63.27 \u00b5M Fe2+/g).\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The following positive controls were used: ascorbic acid in 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (IC50 value of 5.03 \u00b1 0.79 \u00b5g/mL) and 2,2\u2032-Azino-Bis-3Ethylbenzothiazoline-6-Sulfonic acid (ABTS) (IC50 value of 1.72 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5g/mL) test; propyl gallate in \u03b2-carotene bleaching test (IC50 value of 0.09 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b5g/mL); butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) (FRAP value 63.27 \u00b1 4.48 \u00b5M Fe(II)/g). Sign: significance at ** p < 0.05. Results followed by different letters in the same line are significantly different according to Tukey\u2019s multiple range test.\nAs for the oil combinations obtained by mixing the EOs in the ratio 1:1 (v/v), the C1C6 sample showed the highest potential to inactivate the DPPH radical, with IC50 value of 31.05 \u00b5g/mL, followed by the C1C7 sample (IC50 value of 31.44 \u00b5g/mL). A similar DPPH radical scavenging activity was observed also with C1C4 and C3C6. Combination of EO from C. aurantium cultivars \u2018Foetifera\u2019+\u2018Bizzaria\u2019 (C5C7) and from \u2018Crispifolia\u2019 + \u2018Bizzaria\u2019 (C3C7) exhibited a promising ABTS radical scavenging potential, with IC50 values of 31.12 and 31.40 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. In the \u03b2-carotene bleaching test, combination C1C7 was the most active, with an IC50 value of 13.42 \u00b5g/mL, followed by C2C6 and C4C7. Moreover, we have no evidence of significant differences between EOs tested alone and their combinations in the reduction of iron, with values ranging from 19.98 to 38.06 \u00b5M Fe2+/g for C1C2 and C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + C6 + C7, respectively. Several studies have demonstrated that Citrus flavedo is a promising source of antioxidant compounds. This means that, even if present in low concentration, EO constituents are characterized by a certain antioxidant activity. Moreover, the different activity of the\noil should be explained not only by the different geographical origin but also from the extraction procedure applied to obtain the oil; both factors, in fact, affect the composition of the oils. Sarrou et al. [15] investigated the different DPPH radical scavenging potentials of C. aurantium flavedo, flowers, and young and old leaf EO from samples growing in Greece and found that flavedo oil is characterized by the lowest activity, with a percentage of inhibition of 19.29%. Previously, our research group investigated the antioxidant activity of C. aurantifolia, C. aurantium, and C. bergamia flavedo EOs from plant collected in Calabria (South of Italy) [30]. In this case, C. aurantium sample showed a lower DPPH radical scavenging potential (IC50 value of 188.9 \u00b5g/mL), whereas the protection from lipid peroxidation is quite similar (IC50 value of 55.7 \u00b5g/mL). The effect of the extraction procedure on the antioxidant activity was studied by Lu et al. [32], who tested the DPPH radical scavenging activity of Citrus flavedo oils extracted by cold pressing and hydro-distillation. EOs obtained by hydro-distillation process are characterized by a greater activity, with EC50 values of 41.68 and 51.44 \u00b5L/mL vs. 133.57 and 77.22 \u00b5L/mL for C. sinensis Valencia and C. reticulata Blanco, respectively. A lower DPPH radicals scavenging potential was observed by Kamal et al. [33] with C. paradisi, C. sinensis, and C. reticulata flavedo EOs, with percentage of inhibition ranging from 14.05 to 24.08% when tested at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL. The same oils are able to inhibit the oxidation of linoleic acid, with percentage of inhibition ranging from 54.98 to 67.80% for C. reticulata and C. sinensis, respectively. D-limonene was the main abundant compound in all investigated EOs. Previously, Shah and Mehta [34] demonstrated that D-limonene exerted an appreciable radical scavenging activity in both ABTS and DPPH tests, with IC50 values of 603.23 and 384.73 \u00b5M, respectively. A comparable Trolox-reducing ferric ability was also observed. The global antioxidant score (GAS) allows one to discriminate the matrix with the best antioxidant power by combining the differentiated results of a large antioxidant battery (Figure S1). Based on the data, C. aurantium \u2018Fasciata\u2019 EO (C4) exhibited the highest antioxidant potential. Among combinations of EOs samples, C1C7 and C5C7 were the most active."

Evaluation of Radical Scavenging Activity by ABTS and DPPH Assay\nCitrus aurantium EOs and their mixes were screened for their radical scavenging activity by using 2,2\u2032-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) and 1,1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) tests [42]. Briefly, a solution of ABTS radical was obtained by mixing 7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM K2S2O8. After one night, the solution was diluted with EtOH until an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm using a UV-Vis Jenway 6003 spectrophotometer (Jenway, Mortdale, Australia) was read. Dilutions of samples were added to diluted ABTS radical solution to test concentrations from 400 to 1 \u00b5g/mL. After 6 min of incubation, the absorbance was read at 734 nm. In DPPH radical scavenging assay, a mixture of 0.25 mM DPPH radical (DPPH\u00b7) in ethanol and EOs were prepared to test concentrations ranging from 1000 to 1 \u00b5g/mL. The mixture constituted by EO/mix and DPPH radical solution was vigorously shaken and left to react at 25 \u25e6C for 30 min. The discoloration of the DPPH was determined at 517 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control in both tests.\n3.4.2. Ferric Reducing Ability Power (FRAP Assay)\nFRAP test is based on the reaction that involves 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine-Fe3+ complex (TPTZ/Fe3+). Briefly, a mixture namely FRAP reagent, consisting of 40 mM HCl, 20 mM FeCl3, and 0.3 M acetate buffer at pH 3.6, was prepared [42]. EO at concentration of 2.5 mg/mL in MeOH (100 \u00b5L) was mixed with FRAP reagent and water. To monitor the\nreduction of TPTZ/Fe3+ to TPTZ/Fe2+, the absorption was measured at 595 nm after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. A calibration curve was obtained by using ethanol solutions of known Fe2+ concentration, in the range of 50\u2013500 \u00b5M. The FRAP value was expressed as \u00b5M Fe2+/g. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control.\n3.4.3. Carotene Bleaching Test\nThe capacity of the EOs and their combinations to inhibit lipid peroxidation in both initiation and propagation phase was studied by using the \u03b2-carotene bleaching test [42]. In this assay, a mixture of \u03b2-carotene, linoleic acid, and Tween 20 was prepared. After solvent evaporation and dilution with water, the emulsion was added to a 96-well microplate containing EOs (12 \u00b5L) at final concentrations ranging from 100 to 2.5 \u00b5g/mL. The microplate was shaken and left to incubate at 45 \u25e6C for 60 min. After that, the absorbance was read at 470 nm. Propyl gallate was used as a positive control."

Tukey\u2019s test was applied to determine any significant difference in chemical parameters among investigated samples (** p < 0.05). To get a ranking of EOs and their mixes\u2019 antioxidant capacity, global antioxidant score (GAS) was calculated. This statistical application was generated by integrating the antioxidant capacity values generated from different in vitro methods. The mean of 3 T-scores was taken for the value of GAS, ranging from 0 to 3. T-score is calculated by the following equation:\nT-s c or e = (X \u2212min)/(max \u2212min)\nwhere min and max, respectively, represent the smallest and largest values of variable X among the antioxidant values of the same EO [43]. Principal component analysis was performed according to the procedure reported by Bancheva et al. [44]. The different chemical classes used to describe the composition of individual essential oils and their mixes were considered as original variables and subjected, after normalization, to cluster analysis (CA) and to principal component analysis (PCA). The statistical analyses were performed using PRIMER 6 (Massey University Eastbourne, Albany, New Zealand) with two principal components (PC) variables, and the number of clusters was determined by using the rescaled distances in the dendrogram, using a cut-off point (Euclidean distance = 0.9) that allows the attainment of consistent clusters. The principal components analysis (PCA) and the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to comprehend the similarities among the essential oils in relation to the contents of their chemical constituents. We tested two different cut-off similarity levels (cut-off level 0.9 and cut-off level 1.8), chosen based on the mean distance between clusters and based on the similarities\u2013differences between the samples belonging to the same cluster. Since the HCA analysis is a function of variables and observations, the highest correspondence between PCA and HCA resulted when we applied a cut-off of 0.9. The statistical analysis of the absence/presence was carried out using the cluster method of the PRIMER 6 software (Massey University Eastbourne, Albany, New Zealand) [45]."

Herein, EOs obtained by hydrodistillation of the flavedo of C. aurantium cultivars \u2018Canaliculata\u2019, \u2018Consolei\u2019, \u2018Crispifolia\u2019, \u2018Fasciata\u2019, \u2018Foetifera\u2019, \u2018Listata\u2019, and \u2018Bizzaria\u2019 collected in Sicily were investigated alone and as combinations. D-limonene was the main abundant monoterpene hydrocarbon. Chemical and statistical analyses (PCA and HCA) can provide chemodiver-\nsity information on the investigated samples. A division of the cultivars into two classes emerged: the first one, composed of C. aurantium C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, and C7 samples, was characterized by a high amount of D-limonene, and a separate cultivar, C3, contained a lesser quantity of D-limonene but higher percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes. On the other hand, more detailed PCA and HCA analyses showed the clustering of EOs into three groups: group \u2018A\u2019, with a high monoterpene hydrocarbons content and a good quantity of (O); a definite group \u2018B\u2019, characterized by a large percentage of MH, by the absence of SH and OS, and by the minimal presence of O class; and finally, cluster \u2019C\u2019, showing a moderate amount of OM and a small presence of SH and OS. All EOs are able to exert antioxidant activity via different mechanisms of action, as revealed by different applied tests. Among them, the C. aurantium \u2018Fasciata\u2019 EO showed the highest antioxidant potential, whereas among combinations, a promising antioxidant activity was observed with the sample obtained by mixing, in equal volumes, cultivar \u2018Canaliculata\u2019 + \u2018Bizzaria\u2019. According to Ambrosio et al. [46], the founded bioactivity is not linked to the main abundant compound D-limonene. Therefore, our results support the importance of the involvement of minor compounds in the antioxidant activity of the samples. Moreover, the comparison between EOs combinations\u2019 inhibitory concentration (IC50) and FRAP values\u2019 theoretical calculation (data not shown) and real data did not clearly highlight phenomena of synergism or antagonism of action valid in all biological tests.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded.
