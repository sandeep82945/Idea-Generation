    "abstractText": "This paper introduces a high-order accurate surface integral equation method for solving 3D electromagnetic scattering for dielectric objects with uniaxially anisotropic permittivity tensors. The N-M\u00fcller formulation is leveraged resulting in a second-kind integral formulation, and a finite-difference-based approach is used to deal with the strongly singular terms resulting from the dyadic Green\u2019s functions for uniaxially anisotropic media while maintaining the high-order accuracy of the discretization strategy. The integral operators are discretized via a Nystr\u00f6m-collocation approach, which represents the unknown surface densities in terms of Chebyshev polynomials on curvilinear quadrilateral surface patches. The convergence is investigated for various geometries, including a sphere, cube, a complicated NURBS geometry imported from a 3D CAD modeler software, and a nanophotonic silicon waveguide, and results are compared against a commercial finite element solver. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of high-order accuracy for objects with uniaxially anisotropic materials using surface integral equations.",

INTRODUCTION\nBoundary Integral Equations (BIE) are a powerful approach for numerically solving Maxwell\u2019s equations and have been applied to solve a plethora of scattering problems, including antennas [1], radar scattering [2], and most recently nanophotonics [3]\u2013[5]. Traditionally known as open boundary problems due to satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition by design, BIE\u2019s have also recently been successfully applied for solving dielectric waveguiding problems, which require simulating waveguides extending to and from infinity, in both two [3], [6] and three [5] dimensions. Unlike other volumetric computational approaches, such as Finite Difference (FD) and Finite Element (FE) methods, which require generating complicated volume meshes, BIE methods only mesh the surfaces between material regions. Since BIE methods solve for unknowns over surface rather than volume meshes, they may also result in significantly smaller problems compared to using volumetric approaches in scenarios with high volume to surface area ratios. BIE\u2019s have predominantly been used for solving problems with homogeneous, isotropic dielectrics due to the availability of closed-form Dyadic Green\u2019s functions, which can be readily discretized using suitable numerical quadrature and singularity treatment approaches. For example, our recent work in [7] demonstrates high-order convergence discretizing the Magnetic Field Integral Equation (MFIE) and\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-20-1-0087) and the National Science Foundation (CCF-1849965, CCF-2047433).\nJ.

On the other hand, many anisotropic materials are commonly used in engineering applications, such as anisotropic dielectric substrates for antennas [8], [9] and liquid crystal claddings for designing reconfigurable nanophotonic devices [10]. However, despite the fact that closed-form Green\u2019s functions have been derived for uniaxially anisotropic media, there is a dearth of work available using BIE methods to solve problems with these materials. In fact, the only discretization approach in the literature is [11], which presents compelling results comparing against volumetric methods but does not report on error or convergence properties.\nIndeed, although closed form expressions for the dyadic Green\u2019s functions for materials with uniaxially anisotropic permittivity and permeability do exist [12], they are significantly more complex and challenging to discretize than the corresponding expressions for the isotropic material case (e.g., see eq. 24). The PMCHWT [13] formulation is used in [11] and discretized using the Method-of-Moments (MoM) and RWG basis functions [14], [15]. The strongly singular part of the Gee operator (known as the T operator in the literature for the isotropic case) is dealt with in the usual manner by using integration by parts to decrease the kernel singularity by moving a derivative to the testing function. However, the Gem \u221d ( \u2207\u00d7Gee ) operator (known as the K operator in the literature for the isotropic case) also contains a strong singularity which cannot be easily reduced. [11] approximates integrals with Gem by shifting the target point r slightly off the surface. Unfortunately, this approach is expected to result in poor accuracy since the operator is evaluated on a different target point than the original intended one on the surface, and furthermore because the kernel remains nearly singular and is therefore very challenging to numerically integrate even with the target point being shifted off the surface.\nIn this work, we present an new discretization strategy, which when combined with the singular integration approach using Chebhyshev polynomials to represent the unknown densities introduced in [7] achieves high-order accuracy for scattering from objects composed of uniaxially anisotropic materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first demonstration of a boundary integral solver for anisotropic media which achieves high-order accuracy. Note that in all of our examples we assume that only the permittivity tensor is anisotropic and that \u00b5r = 1; however, the approach presented can readily be extended to support materials with both permittivity and permeability tensors having anisotropy. The paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly introduces the surface integral formulation under consideration for dielectric scatterers.

Finally, Section VI demonstrates error convergence and both near and far-field numerical results for four different example cases."

Note that for the subsequent derivations we assume V1 is free-space without loss of generality; however, it can also be any arbitrary isotropic homogeneous background medium. The object is illuminated by an incident field excitation ( Einc,Hinc ) that will lead to both scattered fields (Escat,Hscat) outside the object and transmitted fields (Et,Ht) inside the object.\nTo obtain an equivalent problem for the exterior region based on surface equivalence principle, the interior fields can be nulled, and the total fields in the exterior region (E1,H1) are a superposition of incident and scattered fields, which can be represented as:\nE1 = E inc + \u222b S G 1 em \u00b7M1d\u03c3(r\u2032) + \u222b S G 1 ee \u00b7 J1d\u03c3(r\u2032) (1)\nH1 = H inc + \u222b S G 1 mm \u00b7M1d\u03c3(r\u2032) + \u222b S G 1 me \u00b7 J1d\u03c3(r\u2032) (2) J1 = n\u0302 \u00d7H1 and M1 = E1 \u00d7 n\u0302 are the equivalent surface electric and magnetic current densities for the exterior region.

G 1 me and G 1\nmm) are the dyadic Green\u2019s functions of the exterior region, corresponding to the electric fields (resp. magnetic fields) produced by delta electric and magnetic current sources respectively in V1. By letting the target point r approach the surface S from the exterior V1 and taking the cross products of eqs. (1) and (2) with the unit normal vector to the surface n\u0302, the first set of equations is obtained as\n1 2 M1 +K1emM1 +K1eeJ1 = \u2212n\u0302\u00d7Einc (3)\n1 2 J1 \u2212K1mmM1 \u2212K1meJ1 = n\u0302\u00d7Hinc (4)\nwith K1\u03b1\u03b2 [a](r) = n\u0302(r)\u00d7 \u222b S G 1 \u03b1\u03b2(r, r \u2032) \u00b7 a(r\u2032)d\u03c3(r\u2032) r \u2208 S (5)\nwhere the subscripts \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be either e or m. Similarly, the equivalent problem for the interior region can be formulated by setting the exterior field to zero, allowing the total fields inside the anisotropic uniaxial region (E2,H2), which are the same as the transmitted fields, to be represented as:\nE2 = \u222b S G 2 em \u00b7M2d\u03c3(r\u2032) + \u222b S G 2 ee \u00b7 J2d\u03c3(r\u2032) (6)\nH2 = \u222b S G 2 mm \u00b7M2d\u03c3(r\u2032) + \u222b S G 2 me \u00b7 J2d\u03c3(r\u2032) (7)\nFig. 1.

By letting the target point r approach the surface S from the interior V2 and taking the cross products of eqs. (6) and (7) with the surface normal vector n\u0302, the second set of equations is obtained:\n1 2 M2 \u2212K2emM2 \u2212K2eeJ2 = 0 (8)\n1 2 J2 +K2mmM2 +K2meJ2 = 0 (9)\nwith the integral operator K2\u03b1\u03b2(\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 {e,m}) defined the same way as in (5), except the superscript \u201c2\u201d now indicates the uniaxially anisotropic interior region V2.\nNote that due to the tangential continuity conditions of the fields across the boundary, we must have that\nJ = J1 = \u2212J2, M = M1 = \u2212M2, (10)\nwhich leaves two remaining unknowns J and M and four equations. As is commonly done, the four equations can be reduced to two via linear combination:\n\u03b11(3) + \u03b12(8) \u03b21(4) + \u03b22(9)\n(11)\nwhich is the system of integral equations that is used in our formulation. After the equivalent surface densities J and M have been solved, the total fields outside and inside the uniaxial object can be determined anywhere by evaluating the representation formulas (1), (2) and (6), (7) respectively. The specific choice of coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2, and the explicit form of each dyadic Green\u2019s function will be explained in the next section.\n3"

It can be seen that the kernel inside the integral (D(r, r\u2032)) is now weakly singular since the curl operation has been factored out of the integral.

Note that we focus on the operators acting on J since the same procedure can be used to discretize the K2mm and K 2 em operators which act on M.\nA. Evaluation of \u03c6(r) and A(r)\nIn order to compute \u03c6(r) and A(r), the whole surface S is split into M non-overlapping curvilinear quadrilateral patches Sp, p = 1, 2, ...,M . A parametric mapping is defined from the unit square [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] in UV space to each surface Sp in Cartesian coordinates. Specifically, we introduce parameterization r = rp(u, v) = (xp(u, v), yp(u, v), zp(u, v))\n5 for patch Sp. The tangential covariant basis vectors and normal vectors on Sp can then be defined as\napu = \u2202rp(u, v)\n\u2202u , apv =\n\u2202rp(u, v)\n\u2202v , n\u0302p = apu \u00d7 apv ||apu \u00d7 apv|| . (27)\nThe tangential electric current density vector J on the surface Sp can be expanded in terms of the local tangential coordinate basis as\nJp(u, v) = Jp,u(u, v)apu(u, v) + J p,v(u, v)apv(u, v) (28)\nwhere Jp(u, v) \u2261 J(rp(u, v)), Jp,u and Jp,v are the contravariant components of the surface current density J. For sufficiently smooth surface geometries, Jp,u and Jp,v are smooth functions of u and v and can be approximated with spectral convergence by using Chebyshev polynomials as\nJp,a = Npv\u22121\u2211 m=0 Npu\u22121\u2211 n=0 \u03b3p,an,mTn(u)Tm(v), for a = u, v (29)\nwhere the Chebyshev coefficients \u03b3p,an,m can be computed from the values of Jp,a on Sp at the Chebyshev nodes, which is where the discretized set of unknowns are located, by using the discrete orthogonality property of Chebyshev polynomials:\n\u03b3p,an,m = \u03b1n\u03b1m NpuN p v Npv\u22121\u2211 k=0 Npu\u22121\u2211 l=0 Jp,a(ul, vk)Tn(ul)Tm(vk), (30)\nAfter the Chebyshev coefficients are obtained from the density values on Chebyshev nodes, we are able to compute the density values Jp,a(u, v) for arbitrary (u, v) by interpolating via (29), and the Cartesian components Jpi (u, v) can be computed by taking dot product of Cartesian basis vectors ei(i = x, y, z) and Jp(u, v). Thus, \u03c6(r) and the i-th Cartesian component of the integral A(r) can be represented as\n\u03c6(r) = M\u2211 p=1 \u222b Sp eik\u22a5Re Re \u2207\u2032s \u00b7 J(r\u2032)d\u03c3(r\u2032)\n= M\u2211 p=1 \u222b 1 \u22121 \u222b 1 \u22121 eik\u22a5Re Re ( \u2202( \u221a |Gp|Jp,u) \u2202u\n+ \u2202( \u221a |Gp|Jp,v) \u2202v ) dudv\n(31)\nAi(r) = M\u2211 p=1 \u222b Sp ei \u00b7D(r, r\u2032) \u00b7 J(r\u2032)d\u03c3(r\u2032)\n= M\u2211 p=1 \u222b 1 \u22121 \u222b 1 \u22121 (DixJ p x +DiyJ p y +DizJ p z ) \u221a |Gp|dudv\n(32) where Dij = Dij(r, rp(u, v))(i, j = x, y, z) is the Cartesian component of the dyadic D(r, r\u2032), Jpj = J p j (u, v) is the\nCartesian component of current density J and \u221a |Gp| =\u221a\n|Gp(u, v)| is the surface element Jacobian on the source patch Sp. If the target point r is far away from Sp, the kernels Dij and eik\u22a5Re/Re are smooth and Fejer\u2019s first quadrature rule can be used directly on the discrete densities at the Chebyshev nodes to evaluate the integrals numerically with high-order accuracy. When the target point r is on the source\npatch Sp itself or nearby, the integrals become singular or nearly singular and require special treatment. Since the density on each patch can be expanded in terms of a Chebyshev polynomial basis via (29), the action of these integrals on the density J can be computed by first precomputing their action on each Chebyshev basis polynomial, followed by multiplying the resulting values against the expanded Chebyshev coefficients of the density and accumulating over all n and m indices. Since all of the kernels involved have been manipulated to be weakly singular, we adopt the change of variables proposed in [7], [17] [18, Sec. 3.5] to regularize the integrals by annihilating the singularity with the surface Jacobian, allowing the precomputations to be computed with very high accuracy using a standard Fejer quadrature rule. The Chebyshev discretization and singular integration approaches for the Nystro\u0308m method are described in depth in [7]."

Note that the weakly singular integrals Ai(r), Ai(r \u2212 \u03b4n\u0302p) and Ai(r\u22122\u03b4n\u0302p) in the numerator can be evaluated with high accuracy using the rectangular-singular integration method discussed in section V-A.\nAfter the two weakly singular integrals \u03c6(r) and A(r) and their gradient and curl have been evaluated respectively, K2eeJ and K2meJ can be obtained by substituting into (23) and (25). The same approach can be used to compute the actions of the other integral operators required since the kernels of K2mmM, K1eeJ and K1mmM are similar to that of K2eeJ and the kernels of K2emM, K1meJ and K1emM are similar to that of K2meJ\nas discussed in section IV. Therefore, the LHS of the whole system (22) can be evaluated for an arbitrary target point r \u2208 S. As is done in a typical Nystro\u0308m method, the operators are evaluated at the same targets points as the unknowns; i.e., at the Chebyshev nodes on each patch, and each equation is tested with the two tangential contravariant basis vectors. This results in a full-rank linear system with the same number of equations as unknowns, which can readily be solved using a suitable linear solver of choice. In this work, we use GMRES to solve the discretized systems iteratively."

A maximum deviation less than 0.3dB between our result and the FEM solver result is observed, which further validates the correctness and effectiveness of our solver for scatters with sharp edges.

This is a simplified\n9 design inspired by [10] and consists of two parallel rectangular silicon waveguides embedded within a uniaxially anisotropic liquid crystal cladding. The orientation of the distinguished axis c\u0302 of the liquid crystal media can be electrically controlled by an external voltage. By altering the amplitude of this voltage, the distinguished axis is rotated, causing the permittivity experienced by the dominant field component to change and leading to a different corresponding propagation constant. This changes the phase-shift experienced by light propagating in the fundamental mode of the waveguide over a certain distance as discussed in [10].\nIn our example, the width and the height of the rectangular cross sections of both waveguides are 0.24\u00b5m and 0.22\u00b5m respectively, and the spacing between the two silicon rods is 0.12\u00b5m. The anisotropic permittivity of the liquid crystal cladding is set to be \u22a5 = 2.3409, \u2016 = 2.9241, the distinguished axis c\u0302 is set to either x\u0302 or z\u0302, and the silicon waveguide has permittivity Si = 12.11. We use an electric dipole polarized along (1, 0, 0) direction with unit amplitude and 1.55\u00b5m free space wavelength placed at (0, 0,\u22121) as the source excitation. The Windowed Green Function (WGF) method is used to simulate the waveguides extending into infinity from both directions [3], [5], [6].\nFig. 6(a) shows the phase variation of the dominant field component Ex along the propagation direction for both c\u0302 = x\u0302\nand c\u0302 = z\u0302 obtained by using our solver as well as a commercial FDTD solver. The results of the two solvers match very closely with each other. As expected, due to the difference in the propagation constants of the propagating modes caused by rotating the distinguished axis of the liquid crystal cladding from c\u0302 = x\u0302 to c\u0302 = z\u0302, the slopes of the phase versus position for the two scenarios are different.

            "text": "We introduced a high-order accurate approach to solve the 3D Maxwell surface integral equation formulation for scattering from uniaxially anisotropic objects and media. Specifically, we utilized vector identities to represent the integral operators in terms of weakly singular integrals and their gradients and curls. A Chebyshev polynomial expansion based approach similar to the one used in our previous work for isotropic dielectric and metallic objects [7] is applied for discretizing and evaluating these operators numerically. The high accuracy of the method is verified by comparing the convergence of the solution for scattering from a uniaxial anisotropic dielectric sphere to an analytical solution. Other examples were also presented, including scattering from a uniaxially anisotropic cube, a 3D NURBS model generated by a commercial CAD software, and a silicon photonic phase-shifter embedded in a liquid crystal background medium, which demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the solver for handling many different scenarios. Future work includes using the solver to inverse design high-performance radio-frequency and nanophotonic devices using uniaxially anisotropic materials, such as liquid crystals, which can be dynamically reconfigured by switching their polarization states."
