1. **Investigate the use of machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of glycan identification.** Machine learning algorithms could be trained on a large dataset of glycan MS/MS spectra to learn the patterns that are associated with different glycan structures. This knowledge could then be used to develop a more accurate and efficient glycan identification algorithm.


2. **Develop a software tool that can automatically generate glycan structures from MS/MS spectra.** This tool would be a valuable resource for researchers who are studying the structure of glycans. It could also be used to help identify glycans that are associated with different diseases.


3. **Explore the use of glycan analysis to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for diseases.** Glycans are involved in a wide variety of biological processes, and changes in glycan structure can be associated with different diseases. By studying glycans, researchers may be able to develop new ways to diagnose and treat diseases.


4. **Investigate the role of glycans in the development and progression of cancer.** Glycans are known to play a role in cell growth and differentiation, and changes in glycan structure have been associated with cancer. By studying glycans, researchers may be able to gain a better understanding of how cancer develops and progresses.


5. **Develop new methods for the synthesis of glycans.** Glycans are complex molecules that are difficult to synthesize. By developing new methods for the synthesis of glycans, researchers could make these molecules more accessible for use in research and development.
