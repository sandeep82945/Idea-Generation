Recent years have witnessed increasing evidence of the need to personalize and adapt persuasive interventions to various users and contextual factors because a persuasive strategy that works for one individual may rather demotivate others. As a result, several research studies have been conducted to investigate how to e ectively personalize persuasive technologies. As research in this direction is gaining increasing attention, it becomes essential to conduct a systematic review to provide an overview of the current trends, challenges, approaches used for developing personalized persuasive technologies, and opportunities for future research in the area. To fill this need, we investigate approaches to personalize persuasive interventions by understanding user-related factors considered when personalizing persuasive technologies. Particularly, we conducted a systematic review of 72 research published in the last ten years in personalized and adaptive persuasive systems. The reviewed papers were evaluated based on di erent aspects, including metadata (e.g., year of publication and venue), technology, personalization dimension, personalization approaches, target outcome, individual di erences, theories and scales, and evaluation approaches. Our results show (1) increased attention toward personalizing persuasive interventions, (2) personality trait is the most popular dimension of individual di erences considered by existing research when tailoring their persuasive and behavior change systems, (3) students are among the most commonly targeted audience, and (4) education, health, and physical activity are the most considered domains in the surveyed papers. Based on our results, the paper provides insights and prospective future research directions.\nKEYWORDS\npersonalization, persuasive technology, adaptation, user modeling, individual di erences\n1. Introduction\nPersuasive Technologies (PTs) are interactive systems designed to motivate behavior change (Fogg, 2003). PT has been used in many different application domains. For example, managing online gambling habits (Arden-Close et al., 2022), motivating people to make stronger passwords in the domains of computer security (Forget et al., 2008), promoting healthy behavior (Aldenaini et al., 2020), and increasing users\u2019 engagement with eCommerce applications (Alslaity and Tran, 2021). Since the emergence of PT in the early 2020s (Fogg, 2002), most existing PT have adopted a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach (Busch et al., 2015).\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 01 frontiersin.org\nHowever, there has become a consensus in the literature that the one-size-fits-all design of PT is inadequate to promote the desired outcome and could reduce the effectiveness of the intervention (Adnan et al., 2012; Alslaity and Tran, 2021). This consensus has led to a growing interest in finding ways to personalize and tailor PTs and considerable research has investigated how to better design PT to increase motivation and the probability of success (Andrew et al., 2007; Fogg, 2009; Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2012; Weiser et al., 2015; Jalowski et al., 2019; Aldenaini et al., 2020).\nThe realization of the importance of personalizing PTs has led to an increasing number of studies investigating various ways that PTs can be personalized and relevant personalization dimensions. These studies considered different personalization approaches and adopted various adaptation techniques with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of their PTs to motivate behavior change. For example, in the context of motivating healthy eating behaviors, Orji et al. (2014) investigated the effects of personalizing persuasive games interventions on different gamer types. The researchers found that Competition and Comparison are perceived as persuasive and receptive for five gamer types (Conquerors, Masterminds, Seekers, Socializers, and Survivors), but negatively perceived by Daredevils. The researchers also found that Praise is appealing for Seekers but was perceived negatively by Socializers. In the domain of health and physical activity, Schoeppe et al. (2017) recommend that future design and development of apps that promote health behavior change should be personalized and tailored to the target audience and informed by evidence-based health behavior guidelines and theories.\nFurther work in the education domain (Orji et al., 2019a) demonstrates that using a single strategy is more effective in motivating students and keeping them engaged than incorporating multiple random strategies if the single strategy is tailored to a particular user group. Other research in the eCommerce and recommender systems domain found that personalizing persuasive cues to users\u2019 personality traits would enhance users\u2019 engagement and acceptance of recommendations (Alslaity and Tran, 2021). In a recent review, Anagnostopoulou et al. (2018) examined existing literature on persuasive system implementations in the context of sustainable mobility and found that personalization is an important attribute to improve the impact of the systems and increase the acceptability for real-life usage (e.g., route suggestions based on energy consumption).\nAlthough the research in personalizing persuasive technologies is gaining increasing attention, there is a lack of reviews that summarize the trends and latest technologies in the domain. Therefore, it becomes essential to conduct a review to synthesize available literature. To fill this need, we conducted a systematic literature review to provide an overview of the current trends, challenges, and techniques for developing personalized persuasive technologies. Particularly, we systematically analyzed 72 papers published in the last ten (10) years. The reviewed papers were retrieved from ACM, IEEE, Scopus, and PubMed digital libraries; then, they were evaluated against various themes: metadata, technology, target outcome, individual differences, theories and scales, and evaluation approaches.\nPersonalization is a broad topic adapted to different domains, including recommender systems, health interventions, and persuasive technologies. Moreover, personalization can be achieved based on various factors, including user-related factors (user characteristics), system-related factors, and contextual factors. This multidimensionality of personalization approaches and the wide spread of personalization over several domains makes it hard to cover the whole topic in a single research paper; therefore, this systematic review focuses on personalization in persuasive technology, and it only considers personalization of persuasive technology based on users-related factors, while excluding personalization based on other factors (e.g., system logs and contextual factors). User-related factors are characteristics that are specific to individuals. These factors can vary from person to person and can include demographics, stages of change (Mulchandani et al., 2022), personality traits (Alslaity and Tran, 2020a; Ghorbani and Semiyari, 2022), cognitive ability, gamer types (Tondello et al., 2016), and culture. It is worth mentioning that culture is a broad concept that includes an individual\u2019s behaviors, ethics, beliefs, norms, and habits., etc. That is, part of the culture is related to an individual\u2019s characteristics. Also, some researchers use the word \u201cculture\u201d to indicate countries, which is part of individual\u2019s demographics. So, we considered it as part of the user-related characteristics.\nThis review aims to (1) provide a broad overview of the personalization factors considered in persuasive interventions, (2) highlight the emerging trends and popular domains concerning technological interventions, personalization, and individual differences, and (3) summarize the limitations of existing personalized persuasive technology interventions. Our results show that (1) within the past 10 years, there has been increased attention toward personalizing persuasive interventions, (2) personality traits are the most popular dimensions to investigate individual differences, (3) students are among the most commonly targeted audience, and (4) education, health, and physical activity are the most heavily researched and considered domains in the surveyed papers. Based on our results, the paper provides insights and prospective future research directions.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background and related work. Section 3 presents the methodology, followed by the results in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the findings and provides future research directions, while Section 6 concludes the paper."

It is inherent in human nature, and it involves\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 02 frontiersin.org\nthe subject (or Persuader) and object (or Persuadee). The advent of modern interactive devices, such as handheld devices, mobile devices, and sensing and tracking devices, opened the doors for a techno-dependent form of persuasion called Persuasive Technology. In comparison, Persuasive Technology (PT) can be defined as the use of technology to influence the behavior and the attitude of users (Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa, 2008). PT aims to bring desirable changes in attitudes and behaviors without using deception, coercion, or inducements. PT has been shown to be effective at motivating behavior change in many different domains including health and wellness (Orji and Moffatt, 2018), education (Orji et al., 2019b), fitness and physical activity (Matthews et al., 2016; Oyebode et al., 2021a), sustainability (Knowles et al., 2014), and eCommerce (Adaji, 2017). These technologies have been shown to be effective at promoting several desired behavior change goals including motivating behavior change, attitude change, motivation and engagement, compliance, and increasing awareness.\nThe design of persuasive interfaces involves using persuasive strategies designed as techniques used to motivate behavior change and achieve desired goals, such as increasing engagement, adoption, continued use, and increase awareness. Over the years, researchers have proposed various persuasive strategies over the years to achieve various behavior objectives. Among the most common persuasive strategies are Fogg\u2019s seven persuasive technology tools (Fogg and Fogg, 2003), Cialdini\u2019s six weapons of influence (Cialdini, 2001), and the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) Model (Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa, 2009), which proposes 28 persuasive strategies.\nSince the introduction of persuasive technologies in the early 2020s (Fogg, 2002), the majority of persuasive technologies have typically treated all users in a similar manner without taking into account users\u2019 differences (Alslaity and Tran, 2020b, 2021; Mulchandani et al., 2022). However, some research indicates that the effectiveness of PTs can vary among different users. This is because individuals are unique and have different characteristics such as demographics and personality traits, can impact their behavior. As a result, it is widely recognized in the literature that the one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate in achieving the desired outcomes and may hinder the effectiveness of PTs (Moher et al., 2009; Gamberini et al., 2012). Consequently, there is a growing interest in customizing and personalizing persuasive interventions and adapt based on user characteristics and preferences to enhance their effectiveness (Drozd et al., 2012). The next section discusses the personalization concept and how PTs can be personalized."

            "text": "Personalization is a method where systems tailor their contents to individual preferences (Forget et al., 2008). Fan and Poole (2006) discuss the personalization techniques in the domain of information systems and find that personalization can be classified based on multiple aspects. One aspect relates to what can be personalized, such as the information itself (content), how the information is presented (user interface), and what users do with the system (functionality). Another aspect is the target\nof personalization\u2014whether the personalization is for a specific individual or a group of individuals. A third aspect is the idea of system-driven vs. user-driven personalization (Orji et al., 2017b). System-driven (or implicit) personalization is when the personalization is driven by the system. In contrast, user-driven (or explicit) personalization is initiated by the user, where they make choices or provide information to guide the system on how to adapt.\nAs mentioned previously, most existing PT adopt a \u201cone-sizefits-all\u201d approach (Busch et al., 2015) in their design and evaluation, reducing their effectiveness at motivating desired behavior change. However, there is a consensus in the literature that personalization is paramount for designing persuasive systems because it has been shown to be more effective at motivating behavior change than the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach (Fogg, 2002; G\u00f6bel et al., 2010; Orji, 2016; Ouzzani et al., 2016). As a result, there is growing interest in finding ways to personalize and tailor PT to increase its effectiveness. Recent research has been focusing on how personalization can be effective. For example, OinasKukkonen et al. (2022) argue that because a user\u2019s behavior can change over time, the grounds for personalization may change without the system detecting the change, which results in an \u201coutdated\u201d view of the user. Therefore, the more personalized the intervention, the more users relate to it and find it helpful, which will, in turn, increase the likelihood of adoption of the intervention.\nPersuasive interventions have been personalized mainly based on user characteristics such as personality (Jankovic\u030c et al., 2022), gamer type (Orji et al., 2018a), cultural orientation (Orji, 2016), individual attitudes (Teeny et al., 2021), and users\u2019 demographics. For example, research shows that individuals who score high in extraversion prefer socially competitive activities such as points, levels, and leaderboards (Jia et al., 2016), while another study shows that personalizing features and adapting the gameplay to a player\u2019s stress levels, duration and intensity can enhance a player\u2019s motivation toward gameplay (G\u00f6bel et al., 2010). Furthermore, personalizing persuasive exercise training systems based on the player\u2019s competitiveness and cooperativeness can create a highly enjoyable experience motivating the player to continue the activity (Shaw et al., 2016).\nPersonalization techniques can be divided into three categories: static, dynamic, and hybrid. Static personalization approaches involve the use of fixed rules to personalize the system. In these approaches, a correlation is established between user models (information gathered about the target users) and one or more personalization rules, creating a mapping between users or user groups and the rules during the design phase. Each mapping signifies that the system should apply a specific rule to personalize the intervention when a user\u2019s current state aligns with the criteria defined in the mapping. The main advantage of static approaches is their simplicity. They are easy to be implemented. However, static approaches fail to obtain the ever-changing users\u2019 profiles and preferences.\nOn the other hand, in dynamic personalization, the user model undergoes continuous updates as the user interacts with the intervention. Consequently, the intervention actively monitors changes in the user model and adjusts the system accordingly.\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 03 frontiersin.org\nFor instance, a persuasive intervention for promoting physical activity might use the reminder strategy with the user who is in the early stages of doing exercise. Concurrently, the intervention keeps track of the user\u2019s progress, such as step count and exercise duration. Once the user surpasses a predefined threshold, the user profile is updated, indicating an increased level of physical activity. As a result, the system adapts by employing a more appropriate persuasive strategy, such as competition, that aligns with the user\u2019s current stage. To achieve dynamism, designers can identify a range of interaction styles or scenarios for different user models. This identified information is then mapped to relevant adaptation rules, enabling the system to adapt dynamically based on user characteristics and contextual factors. A more robust approach to dynamic adaptation is to machine learning (ML) techniques are used to model user knowledge, characteristics, preferences, and goals, as well as interactions between the user and the system. In this approach, an ML model is initially trained on both user data and interaction (contextual or behavioral) data; hence able to infer individual users\u2019 current situations and interaction patterns and predict a user\u2019s next action or behavior.\nAlthough dynamic personalization approaches overcome the drawbacks of static approaches, they are not the ideal solution for all cases. For example, new users\u2019 profiles may lack a sufficient amount of data (known as the cold-start problem), making it hard to use these profiles with ML models. This calls for a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic approaches. In such cases, static personalization is used whenever dynamic personalization is not applicable (e.g., the cold-start case)."

            "heading": "2.3. Persuasive technology, gamification, and games",
            "text": "This section discusses the relationship between persuasive technologies, gamification, and games. Broadly, \u201cgamification\u201d refers to the application of game principles in non-game contexts (Deterding, 2012). The term gamification has also been defined as \u201cactive ingredients\u201d to make games addictive, and to apply gamification well, developers first need a list of game design elements followed by integrating these elements into their intervention. Gamified systems become persuasive when they employ specific behavior change ingredients encouraging people to shift their beliefs, attitudes and actions (Cugelman, 2013).\nPersuasive technologies and gamification are interrelated domains. Stemming from Fogg\u2019s formulation of PT (Fogg, 2003), PT is applied to the function and design of gamification systems to describe the tool (an interactive product designed to motivate behavior change) (Llagostera, 2012). In return, gamification can be embedded into the design of persuasive systems to increase the effectiveness of the intervention. Several interventions have been proposed, where researchers have proposed interventions that combine gamification and PTs. For example, Barratt (2017) explored the impact of incorporating persuasive strategies and gamification elements on cycling practice. The study found that gamification helps cyclists to establish new patterns and regimes of cycling to motivate themselves to maintain and improve their health and fitness goals. Martin and Kwaku (2019) investigated\nthe relationship between user types [using the HEXAD model (Tondello et al., 2016)] and persuasive principles in the context of energy saving gamified system (Barratt, 2017). Altmeyer et al. (2018) examined a gamified approach for designing mobile fitness applications. The researchers found that a gamified system that combines integrates gamification elements and persuasive strategies, such as journaling and social comparison, motivated users to walk more.\nGames, on the other hand, are systems designed for entertainment. However, games can also be used for purposes other than entertainment (e.g., behavior change, education, and health). Games that are designed for purposes other than entertainment are commonly known as serious games (Altmeyer et al., 2021). Various studies argue that there is a growing interest in games promoting positive behavior change and that persuasive games (games that deploy persuasive technologies) have been exploited to tremendous effect with applications in various domains (Ghorbani and Semiyari, 2022; Mulchandani et al., 2022). As such, persuasive technologies have become an essential component of the modern game designer\u2019s toolkit when designing solutions to motivate behavior change. Several researchers have explored the feasibility of using games for promoting behavior change. For example, Mulchandani et al. (2022) explored the idea of using personalized persuasive games for increasing disease awareness. In a different study, Orji et al. (2017a) conducted a large-scale study of 660 participants to investigate the benefit and applicability of persuasive games in the health domain, and how these games can be personalized based on personality traits. The researchers found that conscientious individuals tend to be motivated by persuasive strategies such as goal setting, simulation, self-monitoring and feedback; whereas individuals who score high on openness to experience are more likely to be demotivated by rewards, competition, comparison, and cooperation.\nTo summarize, gamification and PTs can be used for behavior change and motivation (Martin and Kwaku, 2019). That is, gamified systems can be persuasive, and behavior change systems. For example, gamification elements can be incorporated as features in a learning management system to motivate students to keep up their good work. Also, games can be used to motivate behavior change. For instance, researchers have examined the use of games to motivate various behaviors, such as physical activity (Yim and Nicholas Graham, 2007; Mazeas et al., 2022), or to increase awareness toward particular risks (Mulchandani et al., 2022). To enhance the effectiveness of these serious games, they are incorporated with persuasive techniques. Accordingly, we can say that gamification and games can be used hand-in-hand with persuasive technologies. Persuasive technologies can be integrated with gamification techniques or in games design to enhance their effectiveness in promoting the desired goal."

These patterns are known as relatively consistent, and they do not change significantly during individuals\u2019 life (Sullivan, 2014). Thus, it is considered as one of the most efficient dimensions to model users and provide personalized interventions. Therefore, personality traits can be considered as a good option to build users\u2019 models and provide personalized persuasive interventions.\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 12 frontiersin.org\n\u2022 Individual differences can be captured using different\nways relying mainly on theories and scales. The results presented in Section 4.4 identified various models and theories for individual differences. We noticed that the same personalization aspect can be captured using different scales. For example, the most common aspect, personality traits, can be captured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) (Tupes and Christal, 1992), and the International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg et al., 2006). Although these scales have been adopted in the PT domain, there is no clear guidelines on which scale to use under which conditions. Therefore, selecting the most appropriate scale and theory for a particular intervention is not a straightforward task, and designers should take this into consideration.\nRQ4: What are the most common theories and practices that have\nbeen used for developing and evaluating personalized PT?\n\u2022 Our results shows that researchers rely on several\ntheories to capture the differences between users. The majority of these theories are adopted from the social sciences. The results (Figure 7) show that the most commonly adopted theories are Big five Personalities, the BrainHex Gamer Type, the Transtheoritical Model of Change, the Social Cognitive Theory, the Self-Determination theory, Fogg\u2019s Behavioral Models, the Health Belief Model, and the ARCS Model of Motivation. \u2022 Regarding evaluating personalized persuasive\ntechnologies, our results show that qualitative methods are used in a total of 27 papers, out of which only four papers used the qualitative method alone, while 24 papers used a mixed-methods approach. This indicates that most of the studies in this area use quantitative methods. This can be due to the simplicity of conducting quantitative studies compared to qualitative studies, as qualitative research (e.g., interviews) can be rather time-consuming.\nRQ5: What are the most common challenges and Limitations facing\nthe domain of personalized and adaptive systems?\n\u2022 Our results show discrepancies in reporting various\naspects of the conducted studies. For example, out of 72 studies, 38 papers did not mention the duration of the study. Also, several studies did not mention the age or gender details. For example, some studies only mentioned the average age of the participants. \u2022 Another important point related to the studies and\nevaluation is that many papers reported results based on a short-term study, <3 weeks (as mentioned in Section 4.7.3). This issue limited the generalizability of the results. \u2022 Also, we noticed that most of the studies use either a\nprototype or an app developed for evaluation purposes only. That is, there is a lack of studies that evaluate the personalization approaches in-the-wild.\n\u2022 Related to the previous point, we also found that most\nof the papers consider fixed personalization rather than automatically adaptive personalization.\nRQ6: What are the most common goals of personalized\npersuasive interventions?\n\u2022 Our study results (Section 4.6) revealed personalized\nPTs target various goals. The four major categories of these goals are Behavior Change, Increase Motivation, Enhance Engagement, and Increase Awareness, and behavior change is identified as the most common goal. Most of the considered papers target one goal, such as O\u2019Keefe (2015), Adaji (2017), and Orji and Moffatt (2018). However, some papers target several goals, such as increasing motivation and enhancing engagement (Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa, 2008). Our study also identified other goals which are less common, including managing a disease (e.g., diabetes) (Gardner et al., 2012), supporting calm breathing (Oyebode et al., 2021a), changing attitude (Barratt, 2017), and increasing the learner\u2019s intended effort (Cugelman, 2013).\nThe next section answers the last research question (RQ7: What are the limitations and future research directions in the domain of personalized persuasive interventions?)."

            "text": "This section discusses our recommendations, which are based on the study results and can be summarized by the following points:\n\u2022 The popularity of the theories and scales (Figure 7) does not\nmean they are the dominant theories for all personalized persuasive interventions; The selection of these theories depends on different factors, including the domain area, intervention requirements, target users, and more. For example, if we aim to design a personalized persuasive health system that provides interventions based on user\u2019s\u2019 awareness of a health issue, then the Health Belief model would be a suitable theory to capture users\u2019 differences (Alslaity and Tran, 2021). Besides, users\u2019 differences can be captured based on multiple factors and theories. Intuitively, using more theories and collecting more information about users would enhance personalization and provide a more accurate personalization mechanism. However, collecting more information complicates the personalization process, requires more effort, and may cause users\u2019 resistance due to time, effort, and privacy concerns. Therefore, selecting the personalization aspect and corresponding theories is an essential task that needs to be considered carefully when designing a persuasive intervention. \u2022 In general, it is much easier to recruit participants for\nquantitative studies. Nonetheless, research has shown that it is beneficial to use qualitative data to support quantitative\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 13 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 10 Target outcome.\nFIGURE 11 Evaluation method.\nFIGURE 12 Distribution of papers by the audience.\nresults (Guetterman et al., 2015). Qualitative results provide more fine-grained thoughts and opinions that can be a good compliment to further support or elaborate on the quantitative results (Sandelowski, 2000). Therefore, our suggestion is to\nemploy mixed methods to get a more insightful and fine-grained evaluation of personalized PT. \u2022 Not presenting sufficient details about studies has a negative\nimpact on the replicability and repeatability of studies, which,\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 14 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 13 Distribution of papers based on study duration.\nin turn, degrades the progress in the research and development of personalized persuasive interventions. Thus, we suggest that when reporting empirical research, include the duration of the intervention, as well as age and gender information so that other researchers can build on existing work. \u2022 Persuasive technologies are used widely for behavior change\n(as shown in Section 4.6). It is known that behavior change and habit formation require a long-time process [e.g., in the health domain, research suggests that it takes at least 10 weeks (2\u20133 months) for habit formation (Gardner et al., 2012)] that cannot be assessed in a very short term. Likewise, Anagnostopoulou et al. (2018) also identified a lack of largescale and longitudinal evaluations in the field. Accordingly, we recommend conducting longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term impact of the interventions. \u2022 We urge the use of in-the-wild and long-time studies as\nthey would help establish the long-term influence of PT in promoting desirable changes. It would also help to continue following the users as when the system detects that an intervention is ineffective or plateaus, the system can offer motivation that is personalized to help the user continue working on changing or improving their behaviors. \u2022 Oinas-Kukkonen et al. (2022) argue that because a\nuser\u2019s behavior can change over time, the grounds for personalization may change without the system detecting the change, which results in an \u201coutdated\u201d view of the user. The more personalized the intervention, the more users relate to it and find it useful. This, in turn, will increase the likelihood of adoption of the intervention. However, recent research shows that real-time physical activity coaching systems employ rather simple forms of personalization, such as Feedback, Goals Setting and User Targeting, while very few systems include adaptation, context awareness, or self-learning techniques (Monteiro-Guerra et al., 2020). Thus, we suggest that it is important to design interventions that continuously monitor the user so that the system is kept up-to-date about the user\u2019s habits and motivation. This way, the system can adapt to the user and increase the likelihood that the user will be successful at achieving the target behavior. Based on previous studies showing that personalized recommendation using a combination of gamification and continuous player modeling\nwould increase users engagement and motivation (Zhao et al., 2020), we also recommend integrating a combination of personalization techniques into the design of PT to increase its effectiveness for motivating behavior change."

            "text": "Many questions remain unanswered in the field on how we can further explore and better personalize PT to motivate behavior change. Below are some potential research questions provoked by the recommendations above as researchers continue to investigate different strategies, theories, individual differences, personalization techniques, and methods to motivate behavior change. We offer the following three general areas for further investigation: (1) improve the experience of educational games and general health solutions, (2) compare the effectiveness of various models, and (3) the pervasiveness of mobile applications and solutions.\nFirstly, we observed that one of the most popular domains studied is the domain of education and general health. This suggests that these domains are capturing much research attention, and it is perhaps traditionally these are domains that examine human motivation\u2014motivate learning and motivate the adoption of a healthier lifestyle. In particular, edutainment in the classroom uses games and videos (which are forms of technology) to motivate learning, and thus, it is expected that it will continue to be a popular topic of study as teachers are constantly finding new ways to motivate student learning. Below are some potential research questions:\n\u2022 What gamification elements can be combined to increase the\neffectiveness of personalization?\n\u2022 What design improvements can be made to adjust the\npersonalization of the student\u2019s learning to increase the effectiveness of the intervention? \u2022 Can gamification elements be adjusted or removed as the\nbehavior gradually forms into a habit?\nSecondly, we observed that although there were some studies that utilized multiple models/theories, many studies only employed a single behavioral model. Combining and comparing the\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 15 frontiersin.org\neffectiveness of related theories/models (e.g., player type models such as the BrainHex and Hexad) can give insight into refining the models and gain a more complete understanding of how to tailor the persuasive system to user\u2019s preferences. It is expected that this will also be on the research agenda for many researchers as novel systems (e.g., games and mHealth apps) are being designed and tested to personalize the user experience and motivate behavior change. Below are some potential research questions:\n\u2022 What models/theories can be combined to provide\na better picture of how to tailor the design of persuasive/gamified systems? \u2022 What other models/theories can be used to inform the design\nand enhance the adoption of personalized persuasive systems? \u2022 How can theories/models be improved to better understand\nwhat motivates behavior change and increase the effectiveness of personalizing persuasive systems? \u2022 Are some models/theories more useful for understanding\npersonalization, user motivations, and behaviors compared to others?\nThirdly, one more area we identified that is likely to continue growing and will be heavily researched is mobile solutions due to their ubiquitous nature. Many conference and journal venues that were part of this review consisted of a mobile component (e.g., novel applications for mobile and ubiquitous gaming, entertainment, networking, and advertising, as well as social implications of mobile and ubiquitous multimedia systems) as a core topic of interest. Thus, it is likely to be a topic of interest for many as researchers continue to investigate how to design and personalize persuasive systems that can fit into a mobile context. Below are some potential research questions:\n\u2022 What other application domains can take advantage of mobile\ntechnologies and make persuasive systems more effective?\n\u2022 Can mobile technologies offer a more integrated experience\nby collecting user data such as habits and preferences and generate more personalized recommendations?\nAlso, there is a need for domain-specific studies that focusses on the most suitable settings for each domain, considering the relationship between application domain and other factors, such as target outcome, personalization aspect, theories and models, technology and platforms, etc., such studies serve as references for developing personalized persuasive interventions that are adapted to different domains."

            "text": "In closing, research on personalizing persuasive technology is growing. This is to address the limitations of the \u201cone-size-fitsall\u201d approach. In addition to personalization, many researchers are investigating the effectiveness of combining related concepts such as gamification and player/user modeling, along with various forms of technologies ranging from mobile to AR/VR.\nIn this review, our aim was to examine the existing literature concerning personalization and individual differences in persuasive and behavior change intentions. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of literature that has been published within the past 10 years. Based on our results, we found that persuasive technologies are used widely for behavior change, and personality is the most popular characteristic that has been researched and applied. We also found that there is a lack of longitudinal studies as most papers reported results based on a short-term evaluation (<3 weeks) and that most studies employed a quantitative approach.\nAs persuasive techniques and strategies continue to be applied to developing interventions that motivate behavior change, there will be a variety of ways to personalize the system design. This creates many opportunities for technology to make itself into people\u2019s everyday life and influence their choices and behaviors. Thus, it is important to understand how to better design these systems, making them effective, motivational, and personal to increase the likelihood of adoption.\nAuthor contributions\nAA: conceived and designed the research, analyzed the data, prepared figures and/or tables, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.
