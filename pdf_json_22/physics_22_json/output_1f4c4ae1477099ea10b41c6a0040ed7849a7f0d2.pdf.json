Approach: The proposed spectral and the standard photopeak reconstruction methods are used to reconstruct images from simulated sources emitting simultaneously photons of 140, 245, 364 and 511 keV. Data are simulated with perfect and realistic energy resolutions and including Doppler broadening. We compare photopeak and spectral reconstructed images both qualitatively and quantitatively by means of activity recovery coefficient and spatial resolution. Main results: The presented method allows improving the images of polychromatic sources with respect to standard reconstruction methods. The main reasons for this improvement are the increase of available statistics and the reduction of contamination from higher initial photon energies. The reconstructed images present lower noise, higher activity recovery coefficient and better spatial resolution. The improvements become more sensible as the energy resolution of the detectors decreases. Significance: Compton cameras have been studied for their capability of imaging polychromatic sources, thus allowing simultaneous imaging of multiple radiotracers. In such scenarios, Compton images are conventionally reconstructed for each emission energy independently, selecting only those measured events depositing a total energy within a fixed window around the known emission lines. We propose to employ a spectral image reconstruction method for polychromatic sources, which allows increasing the available statistics by using the information from events with partial energy deposition. The detector energy resolution influences the energy window used to select photopeak events and therefore the level of contamination by higher energies. The spectral method is expected to have a more important impact as the detector resolution worsens. In this paper we focus on energy ranges from nuclear medical imaging and we consider realistic energy resolutions.",

            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "In nuclear medicine, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a well established technique for diagnostics imaging. This technique is commonly performed by means of collimated cameras, which detect \u03b3-rays issued from a radiotracer previously injected in the patient\u2019s body and distributed in the organs or regions of interest. Each measurement position with a collimated camera allows the acquisition of a planar projection of the tracer distribution, so that acquisitions at different angles can be combined to reconstruct the full three-dimensional image. As an alternative to collimated cameras, Compton cameras have been proposed for this purpose. The main benefit of Compton cameras with respect to collimated cameras is the potential increase in detection efficiency derived from the absence of a physical collimator, which has been shown to be of at least one order of magnitude in the energy range of \u03b3-rays emitted by the most commonly used radiotracers (Han et al. 2008, Fontana et al. 2017). Compton cameras can also be applied in a wider energy range, and are better suited for imaging of higher energy photons up to a few MeV, which present higher collimator transparency and would thus require a thicker septa.\nThe operation principle of Compton cameras is based on the detection in\ntime coincidence of an initial Compton interaction and the subsequent photoelectric absorption of the scattered photon. In such events, the origin of the incident \u03b3-ray is constricted to a conical surface with an aperture angle given by the Compton scattering formula\ncos \u03b2 = 1\u2212 mec 2E\u03031\nE0 ( E0 \u2212 E\u03031 ) , (1) where \u03b2 is the scattering angle, mec 2 = 511 keV, E\u03031 is the energy transferred in the Compton interaction and E0 is the incident \u03b3-ray energy.\nRecent studies have investigated the suitability of Compton cameras for\npolychromatic imaging, thereby allowing simultaneous imaging of more than one radiotracer (Kishimoto et al. 2017, Sakai et al. 2018, Nakano et al. 2020, Uenomachi et al. 2021). In such scenario, \u03b3-rays of different energies are emitted from the different tracer distributions, and images for each of them must be reconstructed independently. For this purpose, energy cuts are set in the measured spectra in order to select only those events whose total deposited energy corresponds to the known emission energies of the employed tracers. However, this approach implies that only events with full energy absorption in the second interaction can be properly reconstructed. This means that (a) events with partial energy deposition placed outside the chosen bounds in the spectra will not be used, thus diminishing the available statistics, and that (b) contamination events generated by a higher energy photon, with a measured energy falling within the bounds of a lower energy peak, will be reconstructed with a wrong initial energy, hence a wrong scattering angle, and will add noise to the image.\nTo overcome these two problems, we propose to use a spectral image reconstruction\nmethod for polychromatic imaging of different radiotracers. The most important feature\n3 of the spectral method is that it does not assume that the second interaction of the measured event is a photoelectric absorption; instead, it calculates the probability for a photon of all the known emission energies to produce the measured outcome, and computes a possible cone of origin for all energies with non-zero probability. For each event, a row of the system matrix is constructed using four-dimensional (three spatial and one spectral) voxels, so that the reconstruction algorithm is able to find both the spatial distribution and the energy of emission of the measured sources. Spectral image reconstruction methods for Compton imaging devices have been previously developed as a means of reconstructing sources with an unknown emission spectrum or a continuous one (Xu & He 2007, Gillam et al. 2011, Mun\u0303oz et al. 2020). The model employed in this work follows the one presented in (Mun\u0303oz et al. 2020), with several modifications. In the first place, here we focus on the energy range of nuclear medical imaging. At these lower energies, Doppler broadening has a significant impact on the reconstructed images, so it was specifically included in the reconstruction process. In addition to Doppler broadening, realistic energy resolutions were simulated to model the performance of different detector materials. Another significant change is the reconstruction of only a few emission energies in the measured spectrum, as opposed to the reconstruction in a continuous energy range that was performed previously. This allows saving computing resources and speeding up computation time, and can be done in the context of multiple tracer imaging because the possible initial photon energies correspond to those emitted by the tracers, which are previously known. Finally, this work reports for the first time a direct comparison between images reconstructed with the spectral method and those obtained using a standard reconstruction method, selecting only fully absorbed events. Images are compared in terms of the activity recovery coefficient and spatial resolution using the Fourier ring correlation method.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes in detail the proposed spectral\nreconstruction method, as well as the simulations performed to carry out the study and the figures of merit used to quantify the improvement of the proposed method. Section 3 presents the results obtained with the proposed method compared to those obtained with standard reconstruction, including reconstructed images with different emission energies and varying statistics. Section 4 is dedicated to the discussion of the previously presented results, and section 5 is left for the conclusions and final remarks."

            "text": "All simulations have been performed using the Compton camera module CCMod (Etxebeste et al. 2020) in GATE (Sarrut et al. 2021) version 9.0, employing the standard electromagnetic physics list. The simulated Compton camera corresponds to the geometry designed within the CLaRyS collaboration (Fontana et al. 2017). It consists of seven silicon scatterer layers with an area of 9.0\u00d79.0 cm2 and thickness of 0.2 cm\n4 and a 3 cm thick scintillator absorber with a surface of 28\u00d721 cm2. There is a 1 cm gap between scatterer planes and the absorber is placed at 15 cm center-to-center from the last scatterer. In the original design, BGO was considered as the material for the scintillator absorber, although it could also be replaced by CeBr3 to achieve a better energy resolution. In this work, both absorber materials have been considered.\nThe simulated source distribution is formed by six cylinders with a constant\nthickness of 4 mm and diameters of 10, 13, 17, 22, 28 and 37 mm, placed at a distance of 100 mm from the first scatterer (see Figure 1(b)). All cylinders emit \u03b3-rays at four energies with the same probability and a constant activity density of 20.5 kBq/mL for each energy. The four simulated \u03b3-ray energies chosen were 140, 245, 364 and 511 keV, which correspond respectively to photon energies emitted by 99mTc, 111In and 131I and to annihilation photons found in the spectra of all \u03b2+ emitters. No source material was included in the simulations, so the emitted photons cannot suffer from scatter or attenuation outside the detectors. In order to test the reconstruction method in the presence of background activity, an additional imaging test was performed including to the previous sources an homogeneous cylinder emitting at the same 4 energies and with an activity density of 25% of the sources. A final test in three-dimensional space was also carried out, for which the six cylindrical sources were replaced by spheres of the same radius. In this case, each sphere emitted in only one of the four energies, with lowest energies being emitted from the biggest spheres: 140 keV from the 37 mm sphere, 245 keV from the 28 mm one, 364 keV from those with 22 and 17 mm and 511 keV from the two smallest spheres. The activity densities and positions on the plane perpendicular to the detectors were the same as the initial cylinders.\nThe set of events selected for image reconstruction is formed only by those events\nwith a forward Compton scatter in one of the scatterers and a subsequent interaction in the absorber. Events in which the photon is backscattered in the first interaction or those produced by the coincident detection of two different primary photons were not included. Due to the very asymmetric efficiencies of the simulated scatterer and absorber, the backscattered fraction of events is quite smaller than that of cameras using similar detectors as scatterer and absorber. The data were simulated with ideal energy resolution, including only Doppler broadening. In order to apply an energy resolution to the simulated data, the deposited energy values were convolved with a Gaussian distribution. The applied blurring corresponds to an energy resolution of 1.1 % full width half maximum (FWHM) at 1 MeV for the scatterers. For the absorber, two different resolution values were used: 7 % FWHM at 511 keV and 20 % FWHM at 662 keV. These resolution values correspond to the ones estimated for silicon double strip scatterers and an absorber of CeBr3 (Livingstone et al. 2021) and BGO (Fontana et al. 2019) scintillator crystals. A minimum energy threshold of 10 keV was set for each detector plane. In all cases, the energy resolution was inversely proportional to the square root of the deposited energy. The spatial resolution of the detectors was not modeled in the simulations, and the interaction position of the measured events corresponds to that of the primary impact. Events employed for standard reconstruction\n5 were selected around the known photopeaks with an energy window of \u00b15 keV for the case of perfect resolution and \u00b1\u03c3 of the modelled energy resolution, calculated for each emission energy in the total deposited energy spectrum, whereas all events without any energy restrictions were kept for the spectral method.\nOne of the advantages of the spectral reconstruction method is that events with\npartial energy depositions can be used, thus increasing the available statistics and allowing for shorter measurement times. The performance of the two reconstruction methods with different measurement times has been studied by reconstructing images with different number of emitted primaries, which is equivalent to having different measurement times with a constant activity. In this study, images were reconstructed with a number of total emitted primary photons between 0.5 and 8\u00d7107, evenly distributed amongst all four emission energies. This is equivalent to measurement times between 6.25 and 100 s with the simulated activity, which produced between 6.8\u00d7103 and 1.1\u00d7105 coincidences in the simulated system. Twenty independent realizations were reconstructed for each case."

The calculation of this probability takes into account the physical interactions involved in the measurement process. The two compared reconstruction methods differ in the energy modelling of the photon causing the measurement, so their respective system matrices are computed differently. For the standard method, based on the reconstruction of events with full energy deposition, we use the model presented in equation (15) in (Maxim et al. 2016):\ntij \u221d | cos(\u03b8\u2212\u2212\u2192r1rj)| ||\u2212\u2212\u2192r1rj||22 K(\u03b2\u0303|E0)p\u03b2|\u03b2\u0303(\u03b2|\u03b2\u0303, E0) , (3)\nwhere rj is the central position of voxel j, r1 is the Compton interaction position, \u03b8\u2212\u2212\u2192r1rj is the angle formed by the vector \u2212\u2212\u2192r1rj with the normal to the detector surface, K(\u03b2\u0303|E0) is the Compton differential cross section from the Klein-Nishina equation and the factor p\u03b2|\u03b2\u0303(\u03b2|\u03b2\u0303, E0) models the uncertainty of the aperture angle of the cone of response, being \u03b2 the geometrical angle between voxel and cone axis at its apex and \u03b2\u0303 the angle calculated using the measured energy and Compton scattering formula. This uncertainty is modelled as the linear combination of two Gaussian distributions, adjusted for each initial energy from simulated data to account for Doppler broadening (Feng et al. 2021). The linear combination of Gaussians was also investigated in (Ida et al. 2018), as reflecting influences from scatter on electrons from the different orbits of the detectors atoms. Fitting functions as Lorentzian, Voigt or general parametric function (Kim et al. 2013) could also be used.\nFor the spectral reconstruction method, all measured events are reconstructed\nsimultaneously with all the considered initial energies, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The expression in equation (3) is modified to include the factors relating the deposited energies with the different possible incident photon energies. After inclusion of these factors, as deduced in (Mun\u0303oz et al. 2020), the calculation of the system matrix elements is given by the expression:\ntij,\u03b5 \u221d | cos(\u03b8\u2212\u2212\u2192r1rj)| ||\u2212\u2212\u2192r1rj||22 e\u2212\u00b50\u03bb0 K(\u03b2\u0303|E\u03b5) (E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031)2\n\u00d7 e\u2212\u00b51\u03bb1\u03c3E\u03032(E\u03032|E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031)p\u03b2|\u03b2\u0303(\u03b2|\u03b2\u0303, E\u03b5) , (4)\nwhere the index \u03b5 runs over all considered initial energies E\u03b5, E\u0303k is the energy deposited in interaction k and \u00b5k and \u03bbk are the linear attenuation coefficient and distance inside the detectors traversed by the incident(0) and scattered(1) photons. It is assumed that E\u0303k equals the energy transferred in the photon interaction, i.e., that there are no losses due to escaping electrons. The exponential factors account for the attenuation and must be included now because the \u00b5 depend on the photon energy. \u03c3E\u03032(E\u03032|E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031) is the cross section of the interaction in the absorber, which has two possible values, according to the possible physical interactions in the absorber:\n7 \u2022 Photoelectric: if |E\u03b5 \u2212 (E\u03031 + E\u03032)| < \u2206E/2\n\u03c3E\u03032(E\u03032|E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031) = \u03c3Ph(E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031) , (5)\nwhere \u03c3Ph(E) is the photoelectric cross section of the absorber material at energy E and \u2206E is the width of the energy window around the emission energy for which an interaction in the absorber is treated as a photoelectric absorption.\n\u2022 Compton: otherwise\n\u03c3E\u03032(E\u03032|E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031) = K(\u03b2\u03032|E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031)2\u03c0mec2\n(E\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03031 \u2212 E\u03032)2 \u2206E , (6)\nwhere \u03b2\u03032 is the scattering angle of a Compton interaction depositing E\u03032 and with initial energy E0 \u2212 E\u03031. In all cases, the sensitivity matrix employed is calculated as described in (Mun\u0303oz et al. 2018), including all the energy dependent terms and adapted to the simulated system geometry.

Since the system consists of seven scatterer planes, the process is repeated for each of them and the final sensitivity matrix is computed as the sum of the seven sensitivity images. Images have been reconstructed on a field of view (FoV) of 200\u00d7200\u00d74 mm3, divided in 50\u00d750\u00d71 voxels. In the spectral method, the FoV contains 50\u00d750\u00d71\u00d74 voxels, as it is extended with an additional dimension representing the possible emission energies. In all cases, images shown in this work correspond to the 20th iteration of the MLEM algorithm. This number was empirically set after visual inspection of the results and ensures a good compromise between resolution and noise in all configurations."

Recall is defined as the number of good events selected in a photopeak set over the total number of events triggered by photons of that energy, i.e. the fraction of good events produced by that energy that are actually contained in the selected set around the photopeak.

The plotted values correspond to the mean ARC computed over 20 reconstructed images.

The ratios obtained with highest statistics are listed in Table 2. This is the case that favors normal photopeak reconstruction the most, so that it can be interpreted as the expected minimum enhancement by the spectral method.

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "The proposed spectral reconstruction method aims at improving the performance of simultaneous Compton imaging of polychromatic sources by dealing with two sources of image degradation. The first of them is contamination in the photopeak from higher energy photons that are not completely absorbed. By generating a cone for each possible\n17\nemission energy, the cone constructed with the true initial photon energy intersects its true emission position and the otherwise noisy event is correctly reconstructed with the spectral method. As seen from the precision values in Table 1, the ratio of such contamination events accepted in the standard reconstruction set depends on the overall system energy resolution, which dictates the width of the energy window of\n18\naccepted events around the measured peaks. Consequently, the benefits of employing the spectral reconstruction method become more important when real resolution values are taken into account. This can also be appreciated from the obtained images, those reconstructed with the spectral method presenting in general a lower noise component. The second feature that is improved by the spectral method is the available statistics for image reconstruction, since events with partial energy deposition are reconstructed. This is not important for low energy photons, which have a high probability of being completely absorbed in the detector. However, as the photon energy increases, the probability of being fully absorbed is reduced, resulting in a severe loss of statistics, as observed in the recall values in Table 1. In a potential clinical application, the increase of the available statistics could result in lower doses administered to the patient or reduced acquisition times.\nReconstructed images were quantified in terms of ARC and FRC. Regarding the\nARC, higher values were obtained when the spectral method was employed. While this was true in all cases, the increase was more significant for worse detector energy resolutions and lower statistics. This can be seen in the ratio of ARC calculated for all cases tested, plotted in Figure 8. The ratio was consistently above one, which indicates a gain in ARC with the spectral method. Considering the results obtained with the FRC (Figure 9), it can be observed that the 2\u03c3 curve crosses the FRC at higher spatial frequencies when the spectral method is used, which indicates a higher correlation to the ground truth image. As expected, this intersection is also displaced to higher spatial frequencies as the number of primaries is increased and for detector models with better energy resolution, for which reconstructed images become more similar to the ground truth. In all cases, the spatial resolution computed from the FRC was better when the spectral method was employed. Figure 10 suggests that the spectral method could allow significant reduction of the radioactive dose to the patient, since roughly the same resolution can be obtained with the spectral method and half the dose required by the traditional method.\nNoise in smooth regions can be easily reduced by low-frequency filtering or by\nregularization. Homogeneity in the constant regions can be improved and variance reduced by low-frequency filtering or by regularization. In the experiments shown here total variation regularization could be used in this sense as in (Feng et al. 2021). However, these methods would have little impact on activity recovery and contrast and should not change qualitatively the obtained results. Resolution can be improved by deconvolving for the point spread function. Resolution enhancement aims to reinforce high frequencies in the image. They are easier to recover when the point spread function gets sharper, that is when the initial resolution of the images improves. The threedimensional point spread function, that can be roughly assimilated to the reconstructed image of the smaller source in Figure 12, seems sharper for the spectral method. Noise has a deleterious effect on deconvolution as it is mainly represented in high frequencies and tends to be reinforced. From Figure 11, it can be seen that the noise component in the zero-activity background is stronger for the photopeak reconstruction, especially\n19\nwhen realistic energy resolutions are considered. We deduce that the spectral method provides initial estimates that could benefit more from advanced image processing.\nThe obtained results demonstrate the potential of the spectral method to ameliorate\nCompton imaging of polychromatic sources. However, there are still some limitations of the method that should be considered for its experimental application. There are known effects that degrade the image and were not taken into account in the present work. One of them is the spatial resolution of the detectors, which is usually modeled using Gaussian probabilities around the measured position (Xu & He 2007, Mun\u0303oz et al. 2018) and can lead to additional blurring if it is not corrected. Backscattered events also represent an important fraction of the measured data, especially for low energy photons. Another source of signal degradation in Compton cameras is the fraction of backscattered events. In the simulated configuration, the ratio of backscattered events was between 0.42% and 0.72% for the four tested emission energies. Possible strategies to deal with these events include using event selection techniques to discard suspected backscattered events or to model all compatible events with an additional cone of response containing the backscatter trajectory. In the field of medical imaging, additional considerations arise, such as the need for three-dimensional imaging and photon attenuation and scatter in the body of patients. As shown in Figure 12, threedimensional Compton images reconstructed with a single camera present elongation artifacts in the direction of the camera due to data truncation, which can be solved by using several cameras simultaneously or by performing measurements in different angles (Kishimoto et al. 2017). In clinical practice, a substantial component of the measured signal can be due to scattering inside the body, especially for low energy photons. Unlike events with partial energy deposition in the detectors, the scatteredphoton noise cannot be recovered by the spectral method as presented in this work. In the context of high scattering noise, it might be more adequate to set energy cuts to remove events with energy depositions outside the known emission peaks (Sakai et al. 2020). In that approach, the spectral method would still be useful to recover unscattered events from higher energies with energy depositions falling in the limits of a lower peak. While all these effects are present in Compton imaging regardless of the employed reconstruction method, their impact on the proposed method should be evaluated in future works.\nIn this work only relatively low emission energies were simulated to study the\nproposed method with currently used radiotracers in SPECT and PET imaging. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest in hybrid imaging systems combining Compton reconstruction with other imaging modalities. These modalities aim at imaging sources emitting \u03b3-rays of at least two different energies of interest, so the proposed method could also be advantageous. In addition, new radiotracers with higher energy photons are proposed in Compton-PET imaging; for instance, in (Tashima et al. 2020) , 909 keV photons issued from 89Zr are imaged. In such cases, the spectral method is expected to produce a more substantial enhancement due to an effective use of events with partial energy deposition, which would highly benefit more compact systems.\n20"

The main reasons for this improvement are the increase of available statistics and reduction of noise from incorrectly assigned initial photon energies by modelling the probability of events with partial energy depositions from all known incident energies in the system matrix. As a result, the reconstructed images present lower noise, higher activity recovery coefficient and better spatial resolution. The improvements become more sensible as the energy resolution of the detectors decreases and when the dose is reduced."
