    "abstractText": "We present new low-frequency (\u03bd = 88\u2013216 MHz) observations of the complex merging galaxy cluster Abell 3266. These new observations are taken with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in its Phase II \u2018extended\u2019, long-baseline configuration, offering the highest-resolution low-frequency view of the cluster to date. We report on the detection of four steep spectrum (\u03b1 . \u22121 for S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd) extended radio sources within the cluster. We confirm the detection of a \u223c 570 kpc radio relic to the south of the cluster, and a possible bridge of emission connecting the relic to the cluster core. We also detect two new ultrasteep\u2013spectrum (\u03b1 . \u22121.7) fossil plasma sources to the north and west of the cluster centre without associated compact radio emission. A previously detected radio galaxy in the cluster is also found to have a spectrally steepening tail with steep-spectrum components highlighted by the MWA. We do not detect a giant radio halo in the cluster. After simulating a range of radio haloes at 216 MHz we place upper limits on the radio luminosity corresponding to \u223c 7.2 \u00d7 1024 WHz\u22121 at 150 MHz assuming the expected 500 kpc radius, up to a factor 5 lower than expected from scaling relations. Why a giant radio halo is undetected in Abell 3266 is unclear \u2013 the timeline of the merger and overall mass of the system as determined by optical and X-ray studies suggest the foundation for a hosting system.",

            "text": "The observation of steep-spectrum (\ud835\udefc . \u22121 1), diffuse synchtrotron radio emission in galaxy clusters provides a glimpse into the microGauss\u2013level magnetic fields (e.g. Govoni & Feretti 2004) and particles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). These radio sources are thought to relate to the physical processes that shape the largest scale structures of the Universe, generated through shocks and turbulence in the ICM (for a review of diffuse radio sources in clusters, see Brunetti & Jones 2014; van Weeren et al. 2019). The radio sources can be broken down into a handful of distinct, but observationally similar classes. These sources include megaparsec-scale, peripherally located, shock-driven radio relics (or \u2018radio shocks\u2019, e.g. Johnston-Hollitt 2003; Bagchi et al. 2006; van Weeren et al. 2016; Duchesne et al. 2021a), centrally located cluster merger and turbulence-driven giant, megaparsec-scale radio haloes (e.g. Feretti et al. 2001; Wilber et al. 2020; van Weeren et al. 2021; Duchesne et al. 2021c),mini-haloes (e.g.Gitti et al. 2002;Giacintucci et al. 2014; Duchesne et al. 2021d), and a variety of other, generally smaller-scale re-accelerated/-energised radio plasmas (e.g. Slee et al. 2001; van Weeren et al. 2017; Mandal et al. 2020; Hodgson et al.\n\u2605 E-mail: stefan.duchesne.astro@gmail.com 1 We use the convention \ud835\udc46\ud835\udf08 \u221d \ud835\udf08\ud835\udefc for the radio spectral index, \ud835\udefc.\n2021b; Duchesne et al. 2021d). Additionally, other aged \u2013 \u2018fossil\u2019 \u2013 radio plasmas including remnant radio galaxies (e.g. Murgia et al. 2011; Duchesne et al. 2020; Quici et al. 2021) are observed in clusters. The link between these sources is not certain, and there is some suggestion of connection between the underlying particle populations and physical mechanisms as well as connections to active radio galaxies (e.g. Bonafede et al. 2014; van Weeren et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2021; Duchesne et al. 2021d). While diffuse cluster sources share similar observational properties, these sources differ fundamentally in the physical mechanisms that drive the acceleration of particles in the ICM magnetic fields even if their underlying particle populations originate from the same place. Complex merging cluster systems have been observed to host a combination of these diffuse radio sources (e.g. Pearce et al. 2017; Botteon et al. 2021; Knowles et al. 2022), with a complex variety of merger dynamics and active radio galaxies within such systems (e.g. Breuer et al. 2020)."

            "text": "Abell 3266 (Abell et al. 1989) is a massive, merging galaxy cluster system located in the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster (HRS) (Fleenor et al. 2005), that contains several prominent radio-emitting objects. Over the past three decades Abell 3266 has been the subject of numerous studies particularly in the optical andX-ray regimes (e.g.\n\u00a9 2021 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n09 62\n9v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n2 4\nJa n\nRobertson &Roach 1990; Quintana et al. 1996; Cypriano et al. 2001; Finoguenov et al. 2006). However, only minimal explorations have occurred at radio frequencies (Murphy 1999; Miller 2012; Dehghan 2014; Bernardi et al. 2016; Riseley 2016, and more recently by Rudnick et al. 2021), and these have been confined to frequencies above 800 MHz leaving the cluster largely unexplored at low radio frequencies (. 400MHz). Finoguenov et al. (2006) noted that the cluster exhibits a low entropy region at its centre, but also that the entropy profile is significantly asymmetrical about the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). While the low entropy region extends \u223c 8 arcmin to the north-east, in the south-west the X-ray data show a sharp increase in entropy and temperature, bounded by a shock front (we refer the reader to fig. 1\u20133 in that paper). It was concluded that this was the result of a sub-cluster group in-falling from the foreground, and in the plane of the sky. However, the X-ray images alone were insufficient to prove the existence of this sub-cluster companion. Dehghan et al. (2017) then explored the optical substructure of the system, finding five individual sub-clusters beyond the main cluster core at various stages of merging and dynamic activity. They report that themerging system is likely to have completed core passage of the main core components, and that a merger is well underway. Recently, Sanders et al. (2021) present eROSITA 2 X-ray observations of the system, further confirming the complexmerger state and highlighting the numerous in-falling sub-clusters surrounding the central system. Murphy (1999) reported re-processed observations of diffuse sources in the cluster at 843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), taken as part of the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS; Bock et al. 1999). These 843-MHz observations were also compared to higher frequency 1.4- and 2.4- GHz Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) data. In particular, Murphy (1999) noted the presence of a barely detectable (2.5\ud835\udf0e) diffuse radio source to the south-east of the cluster in the 843-MHz data and not present in the higher frequency images. Given the low significance of this detection, the source was thought unlikely to be real. Miller (2012) and Dehghan (2014) considered 56 hours of available 1.4-GHz ATCA data of the cluster, but did not cover the region associated with the diffuse source reported by Murphy (1999), instead focusing on other compact sources in the region. Bernardi et al. (2016) and Riseley (2016) observed the cluster with the KAT-7 3 at 1.86 GHz and at 1.83 and 1.32 GHz, respectively. Bernardi et al. (2016) conclude the central emission in the cluster is composed of discrete radio sources and find no evidence of peripheral or other steep-spectrum emission that was not already revealed in the SUMSS image. Riseley (2016), however, notes there may be a hint of excess central diffuse emission after subtraction of contaminating discrete sources. The low resolution of the KAT-7 observations (& 3.5 arcmin) limited the interpretation of this excess central emission. Abell 3266 was observed as part of the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS; Knowles et al. 2022), where the candidate diffuse emission reported Murphy (1999) was confirmed to be a peripheral relic. In addition to this, Rudnick et al. (2021) explored the smaller-scale structure of one of the cluster radio galaxies, highlighting its complex morphology with filamentary features and evidence of episodic activity. In this work, we present new radio images of the Abell 3266 system from the MurchisonWidefield Array (MWA; Tingay et al. 2013)\n2 The extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (Predehl et al. 2021). 3 Karoo Array Telescope.\nin its Phase II \u2018extended\u2019 configuration (Wayth et al. 2018, hereafter, MWA-2), providing the deepest, highest-resolution low-frequency view of this cluster to date.

Due to the large field-of-view (FoV) of the MWA, snapshot observations within \u223c 5 degrees are included for imaging in this work. At the lowest frequencies, more snapshots could be included due to the increase in FoV. However, at the lower frequencies we become more limited by confusion rather than sensitivity within and near the cluster. The MWA-2 fields \u20187\u2019 and \u201810\u2019 presented in Duchesne et al. (2021d) along with supplementary data from miscellaneous projects in the region are processed and co-added. Data processing follows the procedure outlined by Duchesne et al. (2020, 2021c,d) using the MWA calibration and imaging pipeline, piip 5, and associated software. Namely, individual 2-min snapshots are calibrated and imaged independently prior to linear co-addition/mosaicking. Calibration takes place in-field with a local sky model generated from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey (Wayth et al. 2015; Hurley-Walker et al. 2017) and SUMSS (see Duchesne et al. 2020, for details) and multiscale, multi-frequency deconvolution is performed using wsclean (Offringa et al. 2014; Offringa & Smirnov 2017) with the wgridder algorithm (Arras et al. 2021; Ye et al. 2021). General astrometry and brightness scaling prior to co-addition is also as detailed in Duchesne et al. (2020) and makes use of the aforementioned local sky model. This results in an overall flux scale uncertainty of \u223c 10 per cent, predominantly inherited from the catalogues that comprise the sky model. At 216 MHz, with the smallest FoV the contribution from the more distant field \u20187\u2019 observations is minimal, however, the cluster has been observed more extensively at 216 MHz with a total integration time over all snapshots of 222 min. The low elevation of most of the individual snapshots, particularly at 216 MHz, results in lessened sensitivity across the main lobe of the primary beam.\n4 Through the strength of the Sunyaev\u2013Zeldovich (SZ) effect, though note a number of masses have been estimated for the cluster: \ud835\udc40500 = (4.11 \u00b1 0.96) \u00d7 1014 M (Reichardt et al. 2013), \ud835\udc40X,500 \u223c 4.6\u00d7 1014 M (Piffaretti et al. 2011), \ud835\udc40500 = (8.80 \u00b1 0.57) \u00d7 1014 M (Ettori et al. 2019), through SZ, X-ray, and optical methods, respectively. 5 https://gitlab.com/Sunmish/piip\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2021)\nSurface brightness / mJy beam\u22121\nThis limits the sensitivity in the final images, though we still obtain a root-mean-square (rms) noise in the stacked 216-MHz image of \u223c 1.3 mJy beam\u22121 near the cluster. All imaging details are shown in Table 1.\nWe also make use of the 200-MHz wideband image from the GLEAM survey to complement the MWA-2 observations. Other GLEAM bands are generally less sensitive or are too confused for useful analysis in this case."

Relevant discrete sources detected in the RACS image are subtracted by extrapolating their 887-MHz flux density to other frequencies assuming a power law model with spectral index \ud835\udefc = \u22120.7. Additionally, \ud835\udf0ediscrete in Equation 1 incorporates both the measurement uncertainty of the discrete sources and the uncertainty in this assumed \ud835\udefc by adding in quadrature the difference between the extrapolated flux densities when using a range of \ud835\udefc (between \u22120.5 and \u22121.0; for further detail refer to Section 2.4 of Duchesne et al. 2021d). We use the robust +2.0 MWA-2 images for measuring the flux densities of all sources except the western fossil, which becomes too blended with the nearby wide-angle tail (WAT) source, PKS 0429\u221261. For the western fossil, we instead use the robust +0.5 MWA-2 images, convolving all maps to a common resolution (that of the 118-MHz robust +0.5 map) to ensure any additional blending with the WAT is consistent across the band. We note that the higher background signal in the GLEAM 200- MHz image results in a large measurement uncertainty. Individual flux density measurements, along with subtracted discrete source contributions, are reported in Table 2. All four sources are fit with normal power law models, and the measured spectra and best-fitting models are shown on Figure 3.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2021)"

            "text": "To the north of the cluster centre, an elongated, 630 kpc radio galaxy is observed, detected completely across the MWA data as well as in SUMSS and the RACS image. This source is also detected in the ATCA data presented byMurphy (1999), who note a possible optical host at the south-west \u2018head\u2019 and a spectral steepening along the \u2018tail\u2019. As seen in Figure 1, the RG is almost completely detected in the RACS image, except for the steepest-spectrum component at the \u2018tail\u2019 end to the NE. Observationally, the source is similar to the large headtail radio galaxy in Abell 1132 (Wilber et al. 2018). The integrated spectral index of \ud835\udefc = \u22121.26\u00b1 0.22 across the MWA band highlights the contribution from the steep-spectrum components along the \u2018tail\u2019 of the source. Rudnick et al. (2021) present higher-resolution MeerKAT data at 1.285 GHz for this source, showing a complex filamentary morphology with \u2018ribs\u2019 and \u2018tethers\u2019, not discernible in the lower-resolution data presented here except as some clumping along the emission. The extent of the reported emission is similar to that seen in the RACS data. They report a faint core towards the south-west (i.e. the \u2018head\u2019 of the emission), associated with a spectroscopically-confirmed cluster member. Rudnick et al. (2021) show a resolved spectral index map for the source across the 900\u20131670 MHz MeerKAT data, highlighting this steepening from \ud835\udefc \u2248 \u22120.6 at the south-west \u2018head\u2019 of the radio emission to \ud835\udefc . \u22123 approaching the base of the north-east \u2018tail\u2019. In the 216-MHzMWA-2 data shown in Figure 1, the additional component at the end of the north-east \u2018tail\u2019 is not detected in the high-resolution MeerKAT image. This additional component of the tail is not measured separately in this work due to significant confusion, and a resolved spectral index map is not possible with the present MWA data. Based on the integrated spectral index we report here (\ud835\udefc = \u22121.26 \u00b1 0.22) across the entire structure, observation of such steep-spectrum components undetected in the MeerKAT image implies some curvature beyond \u223c 216MHz."

The (deconvolved) largest angular size is \u223c 8.3 arcmin in the 216-MHz image, corresponding to \u223c 570 kpc, smaller than the size reported by Knowles et al. (2022) 10.

The relic is also partially detected in the RACS image, though the emission is patchy and we note that the RACS observations have low sensitivity to angular scale approaching 10 arcmin (McConnell et al. 2020; Duchesne et al. 2021d).

We find \ud835\udefc = \u22121.70 \u00b1 0.14 across the available MWA data, and consider this another example of cluster-based fossil plasma from a long-dead active galactic nucleus (AGN). Alternatively, the sourcemay represent a radio phoenix or other reaccelerated fossil plasma source. The cluster is sufficiently dynamic that weak shocks will be present throughout the volume and indeed Sanders et al. (2021) report two candidate shocks, though not at this location. While not reported by Knowles et al. (2022), the source is also detected in the publicly available images from the MGCLS. The MGCLS data as well as deeper ASKAP observations will provide high frequency data points to constrain the spectrum and investigate relevant synchrotron ageingmodels to determine the age of the source (e.g., Riseley et al., in prep.)."

This source is smaller than other diffuse sources in the cluster at \u223c 2.4 arcmin (\u223c 170 kpc). It may represent a past episode from theWAT, however, it appears to be a distinct component, where the blending between the WAT and fossil is a function of image resolution rather than physical proximity. As with the northern fossil source this may also instead represent a re-accelerated plasma, though with the present data it is not possible to distinguish between a remnant or re-accelerated radio plasma. Such ultra-steep\u2013spectrum emission has been steadily uncovered in MWA data (Hodgson et al. 2021b; Duchesne et al. 2021d,b) and highlights a niche discovery space for the MWA and other lowfrequency inteferometers. However, with the low resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in these detections, uncertainties remain in the integrated spectra for these faint ultra-steep\u2013spectrum radio sources detected by the MWA, and indeed it will not be until SKALow begins operations that we will be able to explore them in much more detail at these low frequencies."

(2016). The MGCLS image reveal some diffuse emission connected to a central tailed galaxy (considered a \u2018confused tail\u2019 byKnowles et al. 2022), though the emission is largely enclosed within the 3\ud835\udf0erms contour of the MWA-2 216-MHz image (e.g. Figure 1) around the radio sources near the cluster centre. This emission will be explored further by Riseley et al. (in prep.) but we do not consider this to be a giant radio halo. We note the GLEAM 200-MHz image shows a high background signal around the cluster (see the bottom right panel of Figure 2), however, this is largely from residual sidelobes from the snapshot imaging process and is a feature of bright, extended sources throughout the GLEAM survey. This is particularly noticeable in the 200- MHz wideband images. Significant source confusion occurs in the lower two MWA-2 bands near the cluster centre. It is not clear from the images at 88- and 118-MHz that there is any excess diffuse emission beyond contributions from (1) discrete sources, (2) the previously noted diffuse emission, and (3) the additional ionospheric blurring that more heavily affects the 88- and 118-MHz data. The less confused, higher-sensitivity 216-MHz images do not reveal excess emission throughout the cluster that would hint towards a giant radio halo. Based on the non-detection in the deep 216-MHz data, we investigate two possibilities: (1) a halo exists at the expected brightness based on established power\u2013mass scaling relations (e.g. Basu 2012; Cassano et al. 2013) and is undetected in the 216-MHz 11 MWA-2 data due to limited sensitivity to large angular scales, or (2) a halo, if present, is under-luminous with respect to the scaling relation. Such under-luminous haloes are being uncovered in high-sensitivity observations both in high- and low-resolution imaging. An example is the radio halo in Abell 3667: first detected in single-dish imaging from by the Parkes radio telescope (Carretti et al. 2013), followed up in low-resolution MWA-1 data (Hindson et al. 2014) and KAT-7 imaging (Riseley et al. 2015), and finally confirmed by recent MGCLS observations (de Gasperin et al. 2021) to be a giant, under-luminous radio halo 12."

            "text": "To simulate the giant radio halo, we estimate the expected halo brightness based on the scaling relation derived by Duchesne et al. (2021c), between cluster mass within \ud835\udc5f500 13 (\ud835\udc40500) and radio luminosity at 150 MHz (\ud835\udc43150 MHz) including the full literature sample of radio haloes. We note van Weeren et al. (2021) originally derived the 150-MHz scaling relation from a sample of radio haloes detected at frequencies close to 150 MHz. This may bias the sample towards a larger fraction of ultra-steep\u2013spectrum radio haloes (with \ud835\udefc . \u22121.5, hereinafter USSRH; Brunetti et al. 2008) which are found to be under-luminous with respect to scaling relations derived at 1.4 GHz (Cassano et al. 2013). For consistency with scaling relations derived by Duchesne et al. (2021c), we use the PSZ2 mass of \u223c 6.64 \u00d7 1014 M . The expected power at 150 MHz is \u223c 3.5 \u00d7 1025 WHz\u22121, corresponding to a flux\n11 We choose the 216-MHz data due to the much longer integration time compared to the other bands combined with the highest nominal resolution resulting in less confusion. 12 Note a hint of emission had been reported by Johnston-Hollitt (2003), though it was unclear at the time if the emission was made up of artefacts from the nearby bright source. 13 The radius within which the mean density of the cluster is 500 times the critical density of the Universe.\ndensity of \u223c 4.2 Jy, or \u223c 2.5 Jy at 216 MHz, assuming a spectral index of \u22121.4 14 (as in Duchesne et al. 2021c). The radial size of radio haloes has been found to somewhat correlate to their luminosity and host cluster properties (Feretti 2000; Cassano et al. 2007) and following the relation obtained by Cassano et al. (2007) we would expect an average radio halo radius of \u223c 450 kpc. The correlation has recently been updated byHodgson et al. (2021a) with radio halo sizes compiled by Shakouri et al. (2016, and references therein), though they note the correlation is poor we obtain a radius of\u223c 500 kpc. As a point of comparison, we also consider a larger halo at \ud835\udc45H = 1000 kpc which serves to both ensure a suitable limit is estimated if the radius is large but also accounts for a generally smoother brightness profile. We consider a limiting case where patchy, extended emission is seen in the final image which would indicate a detection, noting that \ud835\udf0erms ' 1.5 mJy beam\u22121 ' 0.19 \u00b5Jy arcsec\u22122 for the 216-MHz robust +2.0 imaging. Assuming \ud835\udefc = \u22121.4, frequency-dependent model radio haloes are simulated in each 216-MHz snapshot independently following the standard circular exponential profile (e.g. Orr\u00fa et al. 2007; Murgia et al. 2009; Bonafede et al. 2009; Boxelaar et al. 2021),\n\ud835\udc3c (\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc3c0 exp (\u2212\ud835\udc5f/\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52) [Jy arcsec\u22122] , (2)\nwith the peak surface brightness \ud835\udc3c0, and the \ud835\udc52-folding radius \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 which is typically found to be \u223c \ud835\udc45H/2.6 (Bonafede et al. 2017) for a radio halo of radius \ud835\udc45H. We simulated haloes in two separate locations: at the cluster centre as defined by the coordinates from the MetaCatalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC; Piffaretti et al. 2011), and in a relatively empty patch of sky near the cluster. Each location is tested independently. To avoid the somewhat uncertain primary beam attenuation 15 the model haloes are Fourier transformed into the datasets and imaged separately down to the same CLEAN threshold and with identical \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 sampling and image and visibility weighting as the normal data. These snapshot-dependent model-only images are then linearly added to the normal snapshot images, allowing us to avoid the complex primary beam attenuation. The combined model and data snapshots are then mosaicked in the usual way, though we forgo further brightness scaling and astrometry corrections. The ionospheric blurring is minimal at 216MHz and the flux scale deviation between snapshots is small 16 and less important here as only the SNR matters for a detection. The total flux density is obtained from the input model rather than measured in the image. The \ud835\udc45H = 1000 kpc = 14.4 arcmin case illustrates the limitation of the MWA-2 at 216 MHz where it is clear the recovery of the simulated halo in the stacked image is incomplete by up to a factor of \u223c 5 due to the low SNR at this large angular scale. The resultant models and their detection in the stacked 216-MHz images are shown in Figure 4,with the expected flux densitymodelled (2.5 Jy) along with what we find to be upper limits for the quiet sky case (0.8 Jy and 0.3 Jy at 216 MHz for radii of \ud835\udc45H = 1000 kpc and \ud835\udc45H = 500 kpc, respectively) and the cluster centrecase (1.3 Jy and 0.5 Jy). A slightly higher limit is obtained for the cluster centredue to the residual negative sidelobes around some of the central sources which is a result of the limited deconvolution in individual snapshots.\n14 For \ud835\udefc > \u22121.4, the brightness increases at 216 MHz and the halo will become more easily detectable. 15 Particularly the difference in linear instrumental polarizations, XX and YY, which can vary significantly for off-zenith observations and differ from the tile-average model beam (Chokshi et al. 2021). 16 The snapshots are on average \u223c 15 per cent brighter than expected, which is corrected during normal imaging as discussed in Section 2.1.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2021)\nCorresponding luminosities at 150 MHz, 216 MHz, and 1.4 GHz along with derived flux densities are reported in Table 3.\n3.2.2 Why do we not detect a giant radio halo?\nThe derived limits place the expected \ud835\udc45H = 500 kpc radio halo to be \u223c 5 times below the 150-MHz scaling relations reported by Duchesne et al. (2021c), though only \u223c 2.5 times below the scaling relations reported by van Weeren et al. (2021). If the halo were to be offset slightly from the cluster X-ray center, the limit decreases to approach the quiet sky limit, up to \u223c 8 times below the scaling relations. Conversely, increasing the halo size to \ud835\udc45H = 1000 kpc provides a limit approximately in line with the van Weeren et al. (2021) results and up \u223c 2 times below the Duchesne et al. (2021c) relations. Historically, such large haloes are rarely observed (see e.g. halo radii compiled by Cassano et al. 2007; Shakouri et al. 2016; Hodgson et al. 2021a) so this scenario is less likely. Mergers are expected to trigger radio haloes in massive clusters (e.g Cassano et al. 2013), however, a number of merging cluster systems are absent of radio haloes and upper limits below the established scaling relations have been placed (e.g. Cassano et al. 2016; Bonafede et al. 2017). Additionally, some giant radio haloes have be observed to be under-luminouswith respect to the 1.4GHz scaling relations (e.g. by a factor of \u223c 5; Cuciti et al. 2018). Such discrepancies are usually USSRH (e.g. Brunetti et al. 2008; Cassano et al. 2013; van Weeren et al. 2021) or arise due to systematic measurementrelated problems. Incomplete \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63 sampling results in a loss of flux on large angular scales (e.g. Cuciti et al. 2018). Measurements with a low SNR can also under-estimate integrated flux densities which can be mitigated somewhat by fitting a model to the surface brightness profile (e.g. Bonafede et al. 2017; Boxelaar et al. 2021). In this work the flux density limits are obtained from the input model rather than measured in the resultant image avoiding this issue, and limits are derived from the 150-MHz scaling relations where USSRH are not under-luminous (e.g. Duchesne et al. 2021c). We have assumed \ud835\udefc = \u22121.4 for our simulated radio haloes, however, if we consider \ud835\udefc = \u22121 the expected halo brightness at 216 MHz increases. Conversely, \ud835\udefc < \u22124 is required to push a \ud835\udc46150 MHz = 4.2 Jy radio halo beyond detection in the 216-MHz image, hence, we do not consider that an ultra-steep\u2013spectrum is responsible for the non-detection. We instead consider the physical picture of the Abell 3266 system that may limit generation and/or observation of a giant radio halo. The observable lifetimes of haloes may be shorter than the merger processes (e.g. Donnert et al. 2013; Cassano et al. 2016) and cluster systems in a pre-merging state or at a late stage in their merger may\nnot be observed with radio haloes as there may not be sufficient turbulence within the cluster volume to generate the radio emission (Bonafede et al. 2017). These pre-merging or late-merger systems may also be expected to host ultra-steep spectrum radio haloes (\ud835\udefc . \u22121.5; Brunetti et al. 2008), though no reasonable spectral indexwould shift the expected brightness at 216 MHz beyond detectability in this particular case. Some pre-merging systems have been found to host radio haloes (e.g. Ogrean et al. 2015; Duchesne et al. 2021c), and a halo is sometimes found in individual sub-clusters (Murgia et al. 2010; Botteon et al. 2018) 17.\n\u2018Pre-merging\u2019, a late merger, or a weak merger? Dehghan (2014) investigated the evolution of the merger for the cluster using a Newtonian \ud835\udc41-body simulation between the main two optical substructure components of the core region. The result suggested the distribution of galaxies observed represents the system \u223c 0.2\u20130.3 Gyr after corepassage, predominantly involving two sub-clusters with a mass ratio of 1:2 (furthermore see Dehghan et al. 2017). Dehghan (2014) notes this is consistent with both a low-entropy tail reported by Finoguenov et al. (2006) as well as the complex radio structure in the brightWAT. Such a scenario suggests the system is not in a pre-merging state. Furthermore, the eROSITA entropy map presented by Sanders et al. (2021) support the passage of the north-east sub-cluster through the core region which has also been suggested by Sauvageot et al. (2005), after core passage \u223c 0.2 Gyr ago.The system is therefore unlikely to be in a pre-merging state. Weak mergers may produce fainter, perhaps undetectable haloes in part due to steeper spectra (e.g. Brunetti et al. 2008; Cassano et al. 2010). A less likely scenario proposed by Sauvageot et al. (2005) suggests the the merger state is \u223c 0.8 Gyr after core passage, however, a major merger timescale is expected to be\u223c 1\u20133Gyr from simulations (e.g. Cassano et al. 2016). The optical substructure analysis presented by Dehghan et al. (2017) highlights the highly-energetic, complex, multi-component merger depositing large amounts of energy into the ICM with a mass ratio of 1:2 for the dominant central components. Such major mergers are likely a requirement for the formation of giant radio haloes (e.g. Cassano et al. 2016). Candidate shocks reported by Sanders et al. (2021) and the detection of a radio relic may further support this major merger scenario, though Sanders et al. (2021) note it is not yet clear if these are merger shocks. We therefore consider a weak merger scenario unlikely. Based on the available information on the dynamics of the cluster we cannot form a strong conclusion on the nature of this non-detection. Abell 3266 therefore joins a small collection of radio relic-hosting merging clusters without giant radio haloes."

These limits are up to \u223c 2\u20135 times lower than expected from giant radio halo scaling relations at 150 MHz. Why a giant radio halo is undetected in Abell 3266 is unclear, as the cluster system appears in the exact dynamical state that would allow the formation of a giant radio halo. If a heretofore undetected radio halo is significantly under-luminous with respect to the \ud835\udc43150 MHz\u2013\ud835\udc40 scaling relations, further deep observations with MeerKAT \u2013 or in the future with the upgraded MWA Phase III or SKA-Low \u2013 may uncover it."
