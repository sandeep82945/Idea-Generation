    "abstractText": "Background and objective: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a life-threatening adverse drug reaction in which statins are the one commonly related to RM. The study aimed to explore the association between statin used and RM or other muscular related adverse events. In addition, drug interaction with statins were also assessed. Methods: All extracted prescriptions were grouped as lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. RM outcome was identified by electronically screening and later ascertaining by chart review. The study proposed 4 models, i.e., logistic regression (LR), Bayesian network (BN), random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Features were selected using multiple processes, i.e., bootstrapping, expert opinions, and univariate analysis. Results: A total of 939 patients who used statins were identified consisting 15, 9, and 19 per 10,000 persons for overall outcome prevalence, using statin alone, and co-administrations, respectively. Common statins were simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin. The proposed models had high sensitivity, i.e., 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 0.95 for LR, BN, RF, and XGBoost, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic was significantly higher in LR than BN, i.e., 0.80 (0.79, 0.81) and 0.73 (0.72, 0.74), but a little lower than the RF [0.817 (95% CI 0.811, 0.824)] and XGBoost [0.819 (95% CI 0.812, 0.825)]. The LR model indicated that a combination of high-dose lipophilic statin, clarithromycin, and antifungals was 16.22 (1.78, 148.23) times higher odds of RM than taking high-dose lipophilic statin alone. Conclusions: The study suggested that statin uses may have drug interactions with others including clarithromycin and antifungal drugs in inducing RM. A prospective evaluation of the model should be further assessed with well planned data monitoring. Applying LR in hospital system might be useful in warning drug interaction during prescribing.",

RM outcome was identified by electronically screening and later ascertaining by chart review. The study proposed 4 models, i.e., logistic regression (LR), Bayesian network (BN), random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Features were selected using multiple processes, i.e., bootstrapping, expert opinions, and univariate analysis.\nResults: A total of 939 patients who used statins were identified consisting 15, 9, and 19 per 10,000 persons for overall outcome prevalence, using statin alone, and co-administrations, respectively. Common statins were simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin. The proposed models had high sensitivity, i.e., 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 0.95 for LR, BN, RF, and XGBoost, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic was significantly higher in LR than BN, i.e., 0.80 (0.79, 0.81) and 0.73 (0.72, 0.74), but a little lower than the RF [0.817 (95% CI 0.811, 0.824)] and XGBoost [0.819 (95% CI 0.812, 0.825)]. The LR model indicated that a combination of high-dose lipophilic statin, clarithromycin, and antifungals was 16.22 (1.78, 148.23) times higher odds of RM than taking high-dose lipophilic statin alone.\nConclusions: The study suggested that statin uses may have drug interactions with others including clarithromycin and antifungal drugs in inducing RM. A prospective evaluation of the model should be further assessed with well planned data monitoring. Applying LR in hospital system might be useful in warning drug interaction during prescribing.\nKeywords: Statin, Rhabdomyolysis, Drug interaction, Data mining, Bayesian network, Random forests, Extreme gradient boosting\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a life-threatening adverse drug reaction (ADR) which commonly presents with myopathy, myalgia, and dark urine, together with or without the rising of creatine kinase (CK) [1\u20133]. The most severe complication, acute kidney injury (AKI), was found in about 10\u201355% of RM patients, which resulted in multiple organs failure and deaths about 7.1\u201313.0%\n*Correspondence: oraluck.pat@mahidol.edu; charungthai.dej@mahidol.ac.th\n1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Rd, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand 2 Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, 270 Rama VI Rd, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand\nper year [3, 4]. Treatment of RM is a supportive care with intravenous fluid therapy [1]. The estimated cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) to treat RM was 69,742.5 USD per year [5], and the treatment cost even raised to 11,000 USD per episode of AKI [6].\nMedication use was reported as one of the major causes of RM. The most common drugs are antihyperlipidemic agents such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin, regardless of co-administration with other drugs with the rate of RM ranged from 0.5 to 3.7, and as high as 18.6 to 22.5 per 10,000 person-years for combined therapy [7, 8]. Lipophilicity (e.g., atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin) have higher risk for induction of RM compared to hydrophilic (e.g., pravastatin and rosuvastatin) group [9]. In addition, statin also interacts with other drugs including gemfibrozil, amiodarone, digoxin, cyclosporine, colchicine, diltiazem, and verapamil. Nonetheless, the early detection of ADRs could reduce the treatment costs around 1,400 USD per patient [10].\nData mining techniques (e.g., disproportional analysis (DPA) and machine learning-based model (ML)) have been applied to early detect ADRs. The DPA is a fast and inexpensive method, which is widely used for signal detection in spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) [11\u201315], but it is not appropriate for data with high correlation among predictors, or a large dimensional data in electronic health records (EHRs). Data mining from SRS plus EHR could improve the accuracy of signal detection compared to using the information of SRS alone [16]. The ML algorithms have been proposed to solve those limitations of SRSs [17, 18]. Nowadays, there is no consensus on which method is the most appropriate to assess the drug-ADR associations [11, 19].\nA previous study [18] proposed a text mining algorithm for detection of statins induced myopathy or RM from EHRs of a hospital in Singapore. The algorithm had high precision and recall, but the algorithm required discharge summaries in English. Hence, it could not apply to hospitals in Thailand, in which discharge summaries were handwritten with various abbreviations and mixed languages. In addition, their black box algorithms could not explain which drugs increased the risk of RM. Therefore, the study had two research questions as follows: First, did statin alone associate with RM or muscular related ADR occurrence? Second, was statin effect on RM or muscular related ADR modified by other drugs? The study was conducted which aimed to explore the association between use of statin alone or in combination with other drugs and RM or muscular related ADR using the EHRs of Ramathibodi Hospital."

The feature of interest was statin use considered as statin only or combined with other lipid lowering drugs, type of statin (i.e., lipophilic and hydrophilic coded as 1 and 0, respectively), and high or low/standard dose of each statin. In addition, 77 medications that could increase statin levels were also considered. Furthermore, 26 medications known in the literatures as inducing RM occurrence were also considered. Finally, other confounding features were also considered including 2 demographic data, 8 laboratory tests, 5 underlying diseases, and any of 16 comorbidities. These binary features were coded as 1 for presence and 0 otherwise. Age was categorised according to a median of 65\u00a0years. Statin dose was calculated based on a number of doses taken per day, then compared to the number of defined daily doses (DDD) recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) [20]. The average number of DDD during a period of the event was classified into high dose if DDD was higher than 1, otherwise as low (standard) dose. Other drugs were assumed to be taken as 1 DDD, and periods of treatment were calculated. If a period for taking a drug was overlapped with the period of event occurrence, it was identified as co-administration with code of 1, and 0 otherwise.\nLaboratory values measured at/close to statin prescriptions were used for analysis. Those laboratory features were classified into binary features coded as 0 and 1 for normal abnormal based on the normal reference ranges [21, 22]. The level of eGFR was classified as declining kidney function if eGFR < 60\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0 m2 (code 1), otherwise it was normal (code 0). For tests of lipid profile, only TG and LDL were included because doctors considered to prescribe any regimen of statins based on these laboratory results.\nEight lab data were missing, which ranged from 0.004 to 0.08%. Those data were imputed using multiple imputations by chained equations (MICE) of linear regression with 10 imputations [23], see Additional file\u00a01: Table A.8, as follows: First, Scr, the smallest missing value,\nwas initially imputed based on 114 features. Then, the imputed Scr plus other 114 features were used to predict the next second least missing AST. Next, the Na was predicted based on imputed Scr and imputed AST plus 114 completed features. The process was repeated until the last feature, i.e., TG. The whole process was repeated 10 times to get 10 imputed data.

Third, a 1000-replication bootstrapping with multiple logistic regression was applied by simultaneously fitting all features whose p-value was < 0.1 in the univariate analysis, and non-significant features by expert opinions, which were age and common drugs that may have drug interaction with statin [9, 10] including amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, diltiazem, ezetimibe, and gemfibrozil which were reconsidered to include in the model. Lastly, multicollinearity was verified by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) score. [9, 10]."

Therefore, a parent divorcing and Noisy-OR would be applied if more than 20 features were eventually chosen in accordance with literatures [25, 26]. Secondly, model parameters were learnt on the train dataset, and the conditional and the marginal probability of child and parent nodes were calculated and directly emerged on themselves. Values of information of features were also diagnosed and ranked. The highest diagnostic value meant the most relevant features that were used to predict the outcome regardless of parent or child nodes of the outcome.

Additionally, other medications were considered and found that taking antifungals, clarithromycin, ticagrelor, cyclosporine, carvedilol, and colchicine seemed to increase odds of having outcome more than not taking those medications, but only clarithromycin was significant with the OR (95% CI) of 2.777 (1.112, 6.934). Drug interactions between those drugs and highdose lipophilic statin were further explored indicating the odds of having outcome were significantly increased in taking high-dose lipophilic statin with clarithromycin and clarithromycin plus antifungals with the ORs (95% CI) of 5.662 (1.035, 30.962) and 16.219 (1.775, 148.226), respectively.\nThe odds of outcome were also significantly increased for rising AST, poor renal function (reduction of eGFR), and having hypertension with the ORs (95% CI) of 35.294 (11.104, 112.181), 2.360 (1.413, 3.940), and 1.774 (1.017, 3.095), respectively.\nBN findings Eighteen features were considered in the BN graphical model, in which eGFR was assigned as a child node, whereas the remaining played as parent nodes of the outcome, see Fig.\u00a0 2. Clarithromycin and antifungals were directly associated with the RM outcome and also could be directly associated through statin users. All nodes were configured as ranked chance-general node with different diagnostic types, i.e., \u2018fault\u2019 for outcome and \u2018observation\u2019 for features. It can be distinguished that eGFR had the highest discriminatory value used to predict the outcome, whereas AST level had the least diagnostic value. The conditional probability of outcome given features (all parent nodes) was approximately 3%, whereas the conditional probabilities of the outcome given individual features were estimated, see Additional file\u00a0 1: Table A.11. Taking low to high dose hydrophilic statins raised the probability of outcome from 6 to 8%, whereas low to high-dose lipophilic statins increased the probability of outcome only from 2.35 to 3.36%. Taking statins with other drugs also increased the probability of outcome, especially antifungals, ticagrelor, cyclosporine, digoxin, and clarithromycin, as shown in Table\u00a0 2. For instance, occurrence of outcome increased from 6.35 to 38.30%, 40.33%, 37.89%, and 40.03% if taking low-dose hydrophilic statin with antifungals, cyclosporine, digoxin, and ticagrelor, respectively. Probability of outcome occurrence was even increased in these corresponding drug interactions with high-dose hydrophilic statin with probabilities of 41.49%, 45.05%, 41.31%, and 41.81%, respectively. Poor renal function also increased the probability\nof outcome occurrence of 5.64%, whereas other co-variables had only slightly changed the probability.\nThe conditional probability of outcome occurrence with different drug combinations were estimated, see Additional file\u00a01: Table A.12\u201315. According to the analysis of all possible interactions, a patient aged less than 65 who had hypertension, poor renal function, elevated AST, and concurrent use of low-dose lipophilic statins, colchicine, cyclosporine, diltiazem, and ezetimibe, had the highest chance of outcome occurrence (80%), see Additional file\u00a01: Table A.16. Moreover, the model could predict the probability of outcome even though there was an unknown feature of individual case.\nRF findings As result in Fig.\u00a03, a beeswarm plotted the SHAP value on x-axis and features which were ranked by SHAP values on the y-axis. A feature with the highest mean SHAP value was located on top of the chart shaded with red colour whereas the least SHAP value was located on the bottom with blue colour. We found that the top 5 features with high impacts on RM prediction were AST, eGFR, LDL, high-dose lipophilic statin and low-dose lipophilic statin. The chart demonstrated that patients with abnormal AST (> 30 U/L) lead to higher chance of RM occurrence, whereas patients with normal AST (\u2264 30 U/L) contributed to lower RM risk. Patients with eGFR less than 60\u00a0 mL/min/1.73\u00a0 m2 were also higher risk of RM, which were similar to a patients who took high-dose lipophilic statin. Conversely, patients with abnormal LDL (> 125\u00a0 mg/dL) and patients who took low-dose lipophilic statin were lower RM risks.\nA waterfall plot demonstrated a combination of bar chart and line chart. The bar chart indicated feature relative importance whereas the line chart showed the cumulative ratio of SHAP values ranged from 0 to 100 percent. As suggested by the beeswarm plot, AST was the most important feature followed by eGFR, LDL, high-dose lipophilic statin, and low-dose lipophilic statin with cumulative contributions of about 93%."

            "text": "All performances of LR, BN, RF, and XGBoost were shown in Fig.\u00a04. Sensitivity or recall was the most important metric for this study because the model should correctly detect the occurrence of outcome compared with the actual positive outcome. In addition, the model would be designed as a clinical decision support system which helped to screen the patient. The high number of false negative predictions will affect on loss and delay of effective treatments to patients. As the results, all models had high level of sensitivity (LR: 0.850 (95% CI 0.694, 1.00), BN: 0.900 (95% CI 0.769, 1.000), RF:0.950 (95% CI 0.854, 1.00), XGBoost: 0.950 (95% CI 0.854, 1.00)), but\nall of them were not significantly different. However, the LR had significantly higher specificity when compared to other models (LR: 0.754 (95% CI 0.747, 0.762), BN: 0.562 (95% CI 0.554, 0.571), RF: 0.684 (95% CI 0.677, 0.692), XGBoost: 0.689 (95% CI 0.680, 0.695)). The area under the ROC was significantly higher in LR [0.802 (95% CI 0.796, 0.809)] than BN [0.731 (95% CI 0.724, 0.738)], but it was significantly slightly lower than the RF [0.817 (95% CI 0.811, 0.824)] and XGBoost [0.819 (95% CI 0.812, 0.825)]. Nonetheless, the precision and F1 score of all models were quite low due to the low prevalence of RM outcome.\nFinally, the NRIs (95% CI) comparing BN, RF, and XGBoost with the LR models were \u2212\u00a0 0.212 (\u2212\u00a0 0.311, \u2212\u00a0 0.114), \u2212\u00a0 0.496 (\u2212\u00a0 0.594, \u2212\u00a0 0.397), and \u2212\u00a0 0.496 (\u2212\u00a00.594, \u2212\u00a00.396), respectively, which were significantly lower than 0 for all NRIs. From that could be interpreted that those three models were significantly inferior in classification than the LR model."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "We conducted the study to assess associations of statin use and statin-other drugs interactions with RM and related muscular adverse effects by linkage of electronic databases. The LR model suggested that high-dose lipophilic statin tended to approximate 22.7% higher risk of RM than low-dose hydrophilic statin, but this was not\nsignificant. In addition, the high-dose lipophilic statin had interaction effects with clarithromycin about 5.6- folds, and antifungal drugs about 5.8-folds on developing RM, but only clarithromycin was significant. Comparing between explainable-models, the LR was the best relative to BN model, but it was slightly inferior in discriminative performance than the RF and XGBoost with the area under ROCs of 0.802, 0.731, 0.817, and 0.819, respectively. However, the LR model yielded highest F1 score, followed by the XGBoost, RF, and BN, but those were not significantly different. Furthermore, the NRIs indicated that the BN, RF, and XGboost models were significantly inferior in model classifications than the LR model.\nThe estimated RM prevalence was as high as about 2 per 1000 patients, which was higher than those reported by previous studies [7, 8]. That indicated that data linkages among clinical diagnosis, laboratory findings, and the SRS databases could improve identifying and reporting RM. The process of outcome verification was performed by research teams by reviewing electronic health databases, in order to reduce ascertainment bias of RM outcome [31\u201333]. All 122 features were listed based on clinical knowledge and review of literatures [3, 34], especially with medications. For developing models, the study had chosen features having high information using several processes of features selection. The bootstrapping technique which was initially applied for screening the\nrelevant features from the high dimensional variables and the collinearity test corresponded to literature [35\u2013 37]. Then some drugs were regrouped as new features based on clinical therapeutic uses, i.e., statin groups, antifungals, and NOAC, in order to avoid the problem of zero positive events for each feature. The regrouping decreased granularity of data resulting in in a limitation of drilling down on the details of each drug that belonged to antifungals and NOAC. Finally, both statistical method (univariate analysis) and expert\u2019s judgment were used to consider which features should be included for model development. The proposed models including LR, BN, RF and XGBoost suggested the association between drugs and\nthe RM with acceptable to high performance levels. Although the sensitivity of the LR model was about 5% and 10% lower than BN and RF/XGBoost models, those were not statistically different. The LR model yielded highest specificity of 0.754 whereas the BN had lowest followed by RF and XGBoost, which were about 19.2%,\n7.0%, and 6.6% lower than the LR, respectively. Likewise, the F1 score was highest in the LR model, followed by XGBoost, RF, and BN. However, the area under the ROC of the LR was significantly higher than the BN models [0.805 (0.796, 0.809) vs. 0.731(0.724, 0.738)], respectively, but it was significantly lower than the two other unexplainable models of RF and XGBoost [0.817 (0.811, 0.824) and 0.819 (0.812, 0.825)], respectively. The LR and BN models were known as the white-box models, which could estimate the effect size of features on RM directly. Although the RF and XGBoost were known as the blackbox models (i.e., unable to estimate effect sizes), feature importance and contribution on RM outcome could be explained by the SHAP values. However, the NRIs indicated that BN, RF, and XGBoost were lower performance in misclassifying non-RM than the LR model. In addition, interpretation and explainability of the model played an important role in healthcare domain, because the impact of features on RM should be relevant and correspond to biological/clinical mechanism and knowledge leading awareness in drug prescription. Therefore, the LR should be more suitable to the aims of this study and also be useful in clinical interpretation and more applicable than the BN, RF and XGBoost.\nFor the results of LR, a higher odds of outcome with taking a high-dose lipophilic statin corresponded to the characteristics of statins [9, 38, 39]. In accordance with the higher odds of outcome with concurrent use of highdose lipophilic statin and another drug were related to the metabolic and elimination pathway of statins. Both substrates (ticagrelor and colchicine) and inhibitors (antifungals, clarithromycin, and cyclosporine) of CYP3A4 were competitors in the metabolic pathway of simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin. Carvedilol is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, a cellular transport pathway of all statins. Moreover, concurrent use of those drugs (e.g., cyclosporin, digoxin, ticagrelor, and antifungal) with hydrophilic statin also remarkably increased the conditional probabilities of the outcome in accordance with results of BN. Therefore, these medications induced statin retention leading to higher odds of the outcome corresponding to previous studies [31\u201333, 40\u201343]. In addition, a patient who had been concurrently taking high-dose lipophilic statins, clarithromycin, and antifungals should be closely monitored about the outcome due to the high odds of outcome. Additionally, patients who had hypertension, elevated AST level, or decreased eGFR level were higher risk of RM which corresponded to literature [3].\nFor clinical implementation, the proposed LR model should be applied for confirmation of the outcome occurrence, because it had a higher performance as well as easy for use and explanation with an explicit coefficient of an\nindividual feature. Nevertheless, LR was not suitable to use as a clinical decision supporting system due to several limitations of multiple logit regression models [44]. First, the logit model requires all known variables for prediction. Unfortunately, missing data always happens in real clinical practice, and the laboratory features are also usually reported after the outcome has occurred. Also, interaction effects analysis is done by manually fitting the interaction terms into the model, so the LR model is inconveniently used for the analysis of interaction effects that contain more than 2 variables. On the contrary, the BN model could be applied for screening the outcome before happening because it could solve those limitations for several reasons. First, the model predicts the outcome based on prior knowledge learned from the train dataset and the given evidence, so the model can handle missing data. Second, the interaction effects analysis could be done by feeding the conditions as a new dataset or directly inputting evidence into the interactive model. Hence, the model could predict all input interaction terms at once resulting in less time consumption and more comfort compared to the logit model. As a result, the BN could find the worst scenario of patients who would have the highest probability of an outcome after analysing all possible interaction effects. Moreover, the BN model allows immediate prediction of the conditional probability of the outcome for individual patients.\nNonetheless, there were several limitations of the study as follows: First, the data was retrieved from one hospital in Thailand resulting in a low prevalence of the outcome that could affect on the reliability and accuracy of the model. To avoid the problem of zero events, the study had regrouped some drug features, which led to another limitation of data granularity. For example, the model could not drill down on the details of whether the active ingredient, i.e., simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin can actually cause the outcome. Second, there was an incomplete diagnosis recorded in the clinical databases resulting in the problems of outcome identification. Some events were missing because the ICD10-TM code for rhabdomyolysis has only emerged since 2016. Manual chart reviews were executed to solve this gap. However, if there is a higher rate of completeness and correctness of recording ICD-10-TM in the future, then manual chart reviews might be unnecessary. Third, the process of data preparation was complex and complicated due to silos of data. All data obtained from each electronic database had to be merged together for preparing the longitudinal data of individual patients. The study included almost 140,000 statin users with more than 1.5 million prescriptions of statins. Merging all data, building individual patient\u2019s timeline, and\nmapping features to the timelines were time-consuming and high computation was needed. Also, the BN model should update the prior knowledge regularly to accordingly accommodate changes in clinical practice. Therefore, a technique of stored procedure should be used for more practical data preparation. The stored procedure is a prepared query coding that is created for automatic data preparation and saved in the databases without increasing the size of data. Fourth, although we had attempted to identify interaction of statin-other drugs, and also interaction among other drugs themselves, only few significant interactions of statin-other drugs could be identified, whereas the rest of statinother drugs interactions (i.e., ticagrelor, cyclyosporine, carvedilol, and colchicine) only showed trend of associations due to small numbers of RM outcomes. Our study also considered other drug-drug interactions, but this caused overfitting of the model, so they were omitted. Neither pharmacokinetic nor genetic feature was routinely assessed, thus they were not considered. As a result, this study could only repeat previous knowledge without adding new knowledge from the literature."

Use of electronic data linkages should be helpful in identify RM cases from statins and those medications. A prospective evaluation of the model should be further assessed with well planned data monitoring for drug prescriptions and relevant laboratory tests particularly for CK level leading to validating the LR model. Application of the LR model should then be developed later to plug them into a routine drug prescription system.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12911- 022- 01978-4.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
