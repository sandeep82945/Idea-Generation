    "abstractText": "The distributed source coding problem is extended by positing that noisy measurements of a remote source are the correlated random variables that should be reconstructed at another terminal. We consider a secure and private distributed lossy source coding problem with two encoders and one decoder such that (i) all terminals noncausally observe a noisy measurement of the remote source; (ii) a private key is available to each legitimate encoder and all private keys are available to the decoder; (iii) rate-limited noiseless communication links are available between each encoder and the decoder; (iv) the amount of information leakage to an eavesdropper about the correlated random variables is defined as secrecy leakage, and privacy leakage is measured with respect to the remote source; and (v) two passive attack scenarios are considered, where a strong eavesdropper can access both communication links and a weak eavesdropper can choose only one of the links to access. Inner and outer bounds on the rate regions defined under secrecy, privacy, communication, and distortion constraints are derived for both passive attack scenarios. When one or both sources should be reconstructed reliably, the rate region bounds are simplified.",

INTRODUCTION\nA fundamental problem with numerous recent applications is the compression of correlated random sequences observed by multiple terminals such that another terminal, called a decoder, can reconstruct these sequences by using the compressed messages, i.e., the distributed source coding problem [1]. Smart grids with sensors that measure correlated sequences, such as voltage levels, that should be transmitted to a distant node is an example application of this problem. Similarly, function computation problems, where a fusion center observes compressed messages to compute a function of the correlated sequences, are closely related to distributed source coding problems [2], [3], and security constraints are generally imposed on both problems since the communication links can be public [4]. If all transmitted messages are available to an eavesdropper in the same network, then it is necessary to provide the decoder an advantage over the eavesdropper to enable secure source coding or function computation. Decoder side information that is correlated with the random sequences to be reconstructed provides such an advantage [5]\u2013[7]. Limiting the access of the eavesdropper to a strict subset of all transmitted messages also enables secure distributed source coding, considered in [8]\u2013[11]. Similarly, a private key shared only by the legitimate terminals also helps to hide the source sequences [12], [13].\nThe posit that a ground truth is the reason for correlations between the random sequences used in a distributed source coding problem makes the models used more realistic. For secure function computation [14], [15] and secret-key agreement [16], [17] problems, which can be considered as instances of the source coding with side information problem [18, Section IV- B], the correlations are posited in [3], [19] to stem from a remote source such that its noisy versions are these dependent sequences. We similarly assume that there is a remote source whose noisy measurements are used in the source coding problems discussed below, which is similar to the models in [20, Fig. 9] and [21, pp. 78]. Furthermore, in the chief executive officer (CEO) problem [22] the aim is to reconstruct a remote (or hidden) source at a decoder by using the messages transmitted by multiple encoders that observe noisy measurements of the same remote source. Our problem is different from the CEO problem, because in our model the decoder aims to recover encoder observations rather than the remote source. Therefore, we define the amount of information leakage to an eavesdropper about the encoder observations as the secrecy leakage, whereas the leakage about the remote\nsource is the privacy leakage since the remote source is common for all encoder observations [23]\u2013[25]. We consider two encoders, which requires different analysis from [26] with a single encoder, that observe different noisy measurements of the same remote source, and we impose joint secrecy and joint privacy constraints on the distributed source coding problems considered; see [27]\u2013[30] for such joint constraints imposed for secret key agreement problems."

            "text": "We consider a distributed source coding problem with two encoders, one decoder, and one eavesdropper, in which private keys are available to the legitimate terminals and all terminals observe a noisy measurement of a remote source. Furthermore, between each encoder and the decoder, there is a public rate-limited communication link. For this problem, we analyze two passive attack scenarios. In the first scenario, the eavesdropper can observe both public communication links and in the second scenario, only one link can be observed by the eavesdropper.\nAs a motivation for these models, consider two satellites that are far apart from each other and that independently capture noisy images of a sensitive object. The satellites aim to help a third terminal on Earth, which has its own noisy image of the same object, in creating a stereographic image of the sensitive object; see [31] for such a distributed source coding example. Furthermore, consider an eavesdropper with access to another noisy image of the object. Suppose all four noisy images can be modeled as measurements of previous images of the same object that were captured during past activities, so previous images represent the remote source and all four images are correlated. Thus, the eavesdropper is interested in reconstructing all three images available to the legitimate parties, as well as the previous images.\nSince the satellites are far from each other and have limited power, they locally compress their images and transmit the output to the third terminal on Earth. Using error correcting codes, such as concatenated codes used in satellite communication standards [32], one can achieve negligible error probabilities at coding rates below the channel capacity, so we model the public communication links as noiseless and rate-limited. Moreover, if we assume that each satellite is equipped with physical unclonable functions (PUFs), which are digital circuit outputs that are unclonable and unique to the device that embodies them, then PUF outputs can be used as the source of local randomness to extract secret keys [33], [34]. Using public key cryptography methods, the satellites can securely send their corresponding secret key to the third terminal on Earth before image compression and transmission. Alternatively, before launching the satellites, secret keys can be embedded into non-volatile memories available in the satellites, which might make the satellites susceptible to side-channel attacks unlike PUFs. Moreover, a strong eavesdropper is assumed to be able to overhear both public communication links. There might be cases that make overhearing both links difficult. For instance, both satellites might transmit at approximately the same time from different positions that are far apart, which\nforces a weak eavesdropper with a single receiver to choose which link to overhear and the eavesdropper\u2019s choice might not be known by the terminal on Earth.\nWe study sources that are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to a probability distribution with a discrete alphabet to gain insights into the ultimate limits and optimal constructions. Source outputs in practical systems are generally not i.i.d., but it is possible to obtain almost i.i.d. outputs if, e.g., transform-coding algorithms are applied; see [35], [36] for transform-coding methods applied to biometric secrecy systems and PUFs for this purpose. Furthermore, due to the distributed nature of the problem, a distributed transform-coding method should be applied. This is possible by leveraging the distributed Karhunen-Loe\u0300ve transform (KLT) coding methods given in [37]. Moreover, our asymptotic results can be extended to finite-length results by applying similar steps as those applied in [38, Theorem 3] to the wiretap channel [39]. Direct extensions of our results to continuousalphabet random variables are also possible, because our outer bounds apply to arbitrary memoryless channels and there is a discretization procedure to extend our achievability proofs to well-behaved continuous-alphabet random variables such as Gaussian random variables [40, Remark 3.8], which might not necessarily be easy or possible for all such random variables."

A summary of our main contributions is as follows.\n\u2022 We derive inner and outer bounds on the rate region for the secure and private distributed lossy source coding problem with two encoders and private keys, in which an eavesdropper can access all messages transmitted by encoders. Note that our proofs do not directly follow from the proofs for the models without private keys. The bounds differ only in the Markov chain conditions imposed on the auxiliary random variables. The measurement channel model we consider corresponds to a physically degraded broadcast channel (BC), which is an extension of previous source models that include the classic model with noiseless encoder measurements, i.e., a semi-deterministic BC. The terms in the rate region bounds are shown to be different for low, middle, and high private key-rate regimes. Furthermore, we show that a time-sharing random variable enlarges the rate regions for the low private key-rate regime.\n\u2022 We next consider that the eavesdropper is weak and can choose only one of the communication links to access the transmitted message, which changes the analyses and bounds for the joint secrecy- and joint privacy-leakage rates at low and middle private key-rate regimes.\n\u2022 All inner and outer bounds for the distributed lossy source coding problems are shown to be straightforwardly extended to the corresponding lossless settings. Similarly,\nour bounds recover previous secure (distributed) source coding results in the literature, such as in [5], [7], including the secure and private source coding results with a single encoder [26].\n\u2022 We consider a binary remote source and its measurements through symmetric and more-capable channels to evaluate an achievable rate region for secure and private distributed lossless source coding against a strong eavesdropper."

Encoder outputs are two indices W1 and W2 that are sent over separate links with communication-rate constraints. The decoder Dec(\u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7) observes both indices, as well as the private keys K = (K1,K2) and another noisy measurement Y n of the same remote source Xn through a memoryless channel PY Z|X in order to reconstruct X\u0303n1 and X\u0303 n 2 .

The main differences between the inner and outer bounds on RD,strong and RD,weak are the lower bounds on the secrecy- and privacy-leakage rates, i.e., (15)-(18) vs. (26)-(29), that result in different rate regions. This follows since the distortion constraints in (4) determine the lower bounds on the achievable storage rates, which are the same for both regions when the same code constructions are used.\nOne can show that if (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) should be reconstructed losslessly, i.e., replace the constraints in (4) with\nPr [{\u0302\u0303 Xn1 \u0338= X\u0303n1 }\u22c3{\u0302\u0303 Xn2 \u0338= X\u0303n2 }]\n\u2264 \u03b4, to consider secure and private distributed lossless source coding, then the bounds given in Lemmas 1-4 can be simplified by assigning\nUj = X\u0303j for j = 1, 2 such that \u0302\u0303 Xj(X\u03031, X\u03032, Y ) = X\u0303j and we achieve Dj = 0, which satisfies the reliability constraint since d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a distortion metric. Simplified inner and outer bounds for the lossless settings do not match in general due to different Markov chain conditions imposed, which is similar to Lemmas 1-4. Note that computation of partially-invertible and invertible functions [43] is entirely similar to lossless source reconstruction and similar simplification steps can be applied to function computation rate region bounds for such functions. In [41], the auxiliary random variables V1 and V2 are chosen to be constant for such special function computation settings, which results in achievable regions that are not necessarily optimal when a secrecy or privacy constraint is imposed. Furthermore, since there are two auxiliary random variables to be optimized for each encoder in Lemmas 1- 4, evaluating the rate region bounds for secure and private distributed source coding problems with two encoders is significantly more involved than evaluating the rate regions for such problems with a single encoder; see [26] for a Gaussian example for the latter. We remark that it is in general not necessarily easy to evaluate rate regions with auxiliary random variables that have large cardinalities due to the necessity to optimize over joint probability distributions.\nWe next evaluate the projection of an achievable rate region onto the (Rs, R\u2113)-plane for secure and private distributed lossless source coding against a strong eavesdropper."

            "text": "In this paper, the classic secure distributed source coding problems were extended by considering a remote source, where two noisy measurements of the remote source output are reconstructed at a decoder that observes (1) private keys shared with legitimate terminals; (2) correlated side information that is also a noisy measurement of the remote source output; and (3) public indices sent by the legitimate terminals through rate-limited public communication links. We considered two passive attack scenarios, in which either a weak eavesdropper can choose which communication link to access or a strong eavesdropper can access both links. We derived inner and outer bounds for these problems when the eavesdropper observes also another noisy measurement of the remote source output, i.e., the eavesdropper has correlated side information. The private-key rate was shown to affect the secrecy- and privacyleakage rate terms significantly, which are different for low, middle, and high key-rate regimes. Furthermore, we showed that even if a weak eavesdropper can access only a single communication link, the secrecy- and privacy-leakage rate terms depend on the joint probability distribution for the low private-key rate regime."

The code construction below proposed for low privatekey rates, i.e., R0 < \u010eR0, is similar to the construction in [41, Section 5.1], but we apply additional binning steps to leverage the private keys to reduce secrecy- and privacy-leakage rates. For middle and high private-key rates, we change the code construction to further reduce the secrecy- and privacy-leakage rates.\nLet (V n1 , V n 2 , U n 1 , U n 2 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 , X n, Y n, Zn) be i.i.d. according to PV1V2U1U2X\u03031X\u03032XY Z that can be obtained by fixing probabilities PV1|U1 , PU1|X\u03031 , PV2|U2 , and PU2|X\u03032 in (11) such\nthat E[d(X\u0303j , \u0302\u0303 Xj)] \u2264 (Dj + \u03f5) for j = 1, 2 and any \u03f5 > 0. To each vn1 assign two random bin indices Fv1 \u2208 [1 : 2nR\u0303v1 ] and Wv1 \u2208 [1 : 2nRv1 ]. To each un1 assign three random bin indices Fu1 \u2208 [1 : 2nR\u0303u1 ], Wu1 \u2208 [1 : 2nRu1 ], and Ku1 \u2208 [1 : 2nR0 ], where R0 is the private-key rate defined in Section II. Similarly, random indices (Fv2 ,Wv2) and (Fu2 ,Wu2 ,Ku2) are assigned to each v n 2 and u n 2 , respectively, where Fv2 \u2208 [1 : 2nR\u0303v2 ], Wv2 \u2208 [1 : 2nRv2 ], Fu2 \u2208 [1 : 2nR\u0303u2 ], Wu2 \u2208 [1 : 2nRu2 ], and Ku2 \u2208 [1 : 2nR0 ].\nThe public indices F1 = (Fv1 , Fu1) and F2 = (Fv2 , Fu2) represent the choice of the source encoders and the source decoder. Furthermore, we impose that the messages sent by the source encoders Enc1(\u00b7, \u00b7) and Enc2(\u00b7, \u00b7) to the source decoder Dec(\u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7) are\nW1 = (Wv1 ,Wu1 ,K1 +Ku1) (34) W2 = (Wv2 ,Wu2 ,K2 +Ku2) (35)\nwhere the summations with the private keys are in modulo2nR0 , i.e., one-time padding.\nWe impose the following decoding order 1) using (Y n, Fv1 ,Wv1), the decoder estimates V n 1 as V\u0302 n 1 ;\n2) using (Y n, V\u0302 n1 , Fv2 ,Wv2), the decoder estimates V n 2 as\nV\u0302 n2 ; 3) using (Y n,K1, V\u0302 n1 , V\u0302 n 2 , Fu1 ,Wu1 ,K1+Ku1), the decoder\nestimates Un1 as U\u0302 n 1 ;\n4) using (Y n,K2, V\u0302 n1 , V\u0302 n 2 , U\u0302 n 1 , Fu2 ,Wu2 ,K2+Ku2), the de-\ncoder estimates Un2 as U\u0302 n 2 .\nSwapping the indices 1 and 2 above, one can achieve another corner point in the achievable rate region. Due to symmetry, the analysis for the swapped decoding order is entirely similar to the analysis for the decoding order given above, so we consider only the latter. We remark that the imposed decoding order corresponds to a layered decoding of the random sequences.\nThe public index Fv1 is almost independent of (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 , X n, Y n, Zn) if we have [46, Theorem 1]\nR\u0303v1 < H(V1|X\u03031, X\u03032, X, Y, Z) (a) = H(V1|X\u03031) (36)\nwhere (a) follows since (X\u03032, X, Y, Z) \u2212 X\u03031 \u2212 V1 form a Markov chain. The constraint in (36) suggests that the expected value, which is taken over the random bin assignments, of the variational distance between the joint probability distributions Unif[1 : 2nR\u0303v1 ] \u00b7 PX\u0303n1 and PFv1 X\u0303n1 vanishes when n \u2192 \u221e.

Similarly, Step 2 estimation, given above as the second step in the imposed decoding order, is reliable if we have\nR\u0303v2 +Rv2 > H(V2|V1, Y ).

Similarly, (49) and (51) result in a communication rate of\nRw2 = R0 +Rv2 +Ru2 (a) = I(V2; X\u03032|V1, Y ) +H(U2|U1, V2, Y )\n\u2212H(U2|V2, X\u03032) + 4\u03f5 (b) = I(V2; X\u03032|V1, Y ) + I(U2; X\u03032|U1, V2, Y ) + 4\u03f5 (53)\nwhere (a) follows since V2 \u2212 X\u03032 \u2212 (V1, Y ) form a Markov chain and (b) follows from the Markov chain condition U2 \u2212 (V2, X\u03032) \u2212 (U1, Y ). By swapping the indices 1 and 2 in the decoding order given above, one can achieve the other corner point with\nR\u2032w1 = I(V1; X\u03031|V2, Y ) + I(U1; X\u03031|U2, V1, Y ) + 4\u03f5 (54) R\u2032w2 = I(V2; X\u03032|Y ) + I(U2; X\u03032|V1, V2, Y ) + 4\u03f5. (55)\nPrivacy Leakage: Since 1) the private keys K = (K1,K2) are independent of the source and channel random variables; 2) random encoders given above are constructed independently; 3) K is uniformly distributed; and 4) all random bin indices can be shown to be mutually independent for any \u03f5 > 0 such that \u03f5 \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e, we can consider the following virtual scenario to calculate the leakage. Suppose first that there is no private key such that the encoder outputs for the virtual scenario are\n\u010eW1 = (Wv1 ,Wu1 ,Ku1) (56) \u010eW2 = (Wv2 ,Wu2 ,Ku2). (57)\nWe first calculate the leakage for the virtual scenario. Then, given the mentioned four properties and due to the one-time padding steps in (34) and (35), we can subtract H(K) = 2nR0 from the leakage calculated for the virtual scenario to obtain the leakage for the original problem. Thus, we have the privacy leakage\nI(Xn;W1,W2, F1, F2|Zn) = I(Xn; \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\u2212 2nR0 (a) = H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\u2212H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Xn)\u22122nR0 (b) = H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\n\u2212H(Un1 , Un2 , V n1 , V n2 |Xn) +H(V n1 |\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, Xn) +H(V n2 |V n1 , \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, Xn) +H(Un1 |V n1 , V n2 , \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, Xn) +H(Un2 |Un1 , V n1 , V n2 , \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, Xn)\u2212 2nR0\n(c) \u2264 H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn) \u2212H(Un1 , Un2 , V n1 , V n2 |Xn) + 4n\u03f5\u2032n \u2212 2nR0\n(d) = H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\n\u2212 nH(U1, U2, V1, V2|X) + 4n\u03f5\u2032n \u2212 2nR0 (58)\nwhere (a) follows because (\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2) \u2212 Xn \u2212 Zn form a Markov chain; (b) follows since (Un1 , U n 2 , V n 1 , V n 2 ) determine (Fu1 ,Wu1 ,Ku1 , Fv1 ,Wv1 , Fu2 ,Wu2 ,Ku2 , Fv2 ,Wv2); (c) follows for some \u03f5\u2032n > 0 such that \u03f5 \u2032 n \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e since (Fv1 ,Wv1 , X n) can reliably recover V n1 by (40) and, similarly, (Fv2 ,Wv2 , V n 1 , X\nn) can reliably recover V n2 by (41) both due to the Markov chain condition\n(V n1 , V n 2 )\u2212 (Un1 , Un2 )\u2212 (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 )\u2212Xn \u2212 Y n. (59)\nMoreover, because of the Markov chain condition in (59) (Fu1 ,Wu1 ,Ku1 , V n 1 , V n 2 , X\nn) can reliably recover Un1 by (42) and, similarly, (Fu2 ,Wu2 ,Ku2 , U n 1 , V n 1 , V n 2 , X\nn) can reliably recover Un2 by (43), which follows from H(U2|U1, V1, V2, Y ) \u2265 H(U2|U1, V1, V2, X) that can be obtained as\nH(U2|U1, V1, V2, Y )\u2212H(U2|U1, V1, V2, X) = I(U2;U1, V1, V2, X)\u2212 I(U2;U1, V1, V2, Y ) \u2265I(U2;U1, V1, V2, X)\u2212I(U2;U1, V1, V2, X, Y ) = 0 (60)\nwhere the last equality follows from the Markov chain condition (U1, U2, V1, V2)\u2212X \u2212 Y ; (d) follows since (Un1 , U n 2 , V n 1 , V n 2 , X\nn) are i.i.d. Next, we consider the term H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn) in (58) and provide single letter bounds on it, which requires to analyze numerous decoding cases. In [3, Section V-A], six different decodability cases are analyzed for two decoding steps. We can leverage these results by combining the decoding order Steps 1 and 2 to treat (V n1 , V n 2 ) jointly, as well as combining Steps 3 and 4 to treat (Un1 , U n 2 ) jointly; see also [41, Section 5.1]. Thus, by replacing V n with (V n1 , V n 2 )\nand Un with (Un1 , U n 2 ) in [3, Section V-A], respectively, we can apply the results of the six decodability analyses to (58). Furthermore, the subtracted term in [3, Eq. (54)] can be mapped to the second term in (58) by applying the same replacements. Thus, combining the replaced decodability analyses with (58), we obtain\nI(Xn;W1,W2, F1, F2|Zn) \u2264 n ( [I(U1, U2;Z|V1, V2)\u2212 I(U1, U2;Y |V1, V2) + \u03f5]\u2212\n+ I(U1, U2;X|Z)\u2212 2R0 + 5\u03f5\u2032n ) . (61)\nWe remark that (47) and (51) implicitly assume that R0 < (min{I(U1; X\u03031|V1, V2, Y ), I(U2; X\u03032|V2, U1, Y )}+2\u03f5), since the private keys K1 and K2 are used to apply onetime padding to one bin of Un1 and U n 2 , respectively. The communication rate results are not affected by this assumption since both X\u03031 and X\u03032 should be reconstructed by the decoder. However, the leakage analysis changes if R0 \u2265 (max{I(U1; X\u03031|V1, V2, Y ), I(U2; X\u03032|V2, U1, Y )} + 2\u03f5), because then the private keys can be used to apply one-time padding to the single bins of Un1 and U n 2 with encoder outputs\n\u010eW1 = (Wv1 ,Wu1 +K1) (62) \u010eW2 = (Wv2 ,Wu2 +K2) (63)\nwhere the bins with indices Ku1 and Ku2 are removed from the code construction. We then have the privacy leakage\nI(Xn; \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\n= H(Xn|Zn)\u2212H(Xn|Zn, \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2) (a) = H(Xn|Zn)\u2212H(Xn|Zn,Wv1 ,Wv2 , F1, F2) (b) \u2264 H(Xn|Zn)\u2212H(Xn|Zn, V n1 , V n2 ) + 2\u03f5\u2032n (c) = nH(X|Z)\u2212 nH(X|Z, V1, V2) + 2\u03f5\u2032n = nI(V1, V2;X|Z) + 2\u03f5\u2032n (64)\nwhere (a) follows since (Wu1 + K1) is independent of (Un1 , U n 2 , V n 1 , V n 2 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 , X\nn, Y n, Zn) due to the onetime padding with a uniform and independent private key and, similarly, (Wu2 + K2) is also independent of (Un1 , U n 2 , V n 1 , V n 2 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 , X\nn, Y n, Zn), (b) follows since (V n1 , V n 2 ) determine (Wv1 ,Wv2 , Fv1 , Fv2) and for some \u03f5 \u2032 n > 0 such that \u03f5\u2032n \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e because by (37) Fu1 is almost independent of (V n 1 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 , X\nn, Zn) and by (39) Fu2 is almost independent of (V n 2 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 , X\nn, Zn), respectively, and (c) follows because (V n1 , V n 2 , X\nn, Zn) are i.i.d.\nConsider next that R0 is greater than or equal to the maximum of (I(V1; X\u03031|Y ) + I(U1; X\u03031|V1, V2, Y ) + 4\u03f5) and (I(V2; X\u03032|V1, Y ) + I(U2; X\u03032|U1, V2, Y ) + 4\u03f5), given in (52) and (53), respectively. Then, j-th encoder can apply one-time padding to both Wvj and Wuj for j = 1, 2, so no information\nis leaked to the eavesdropper about (Wv1 ,Wu1 ,Wv2 ,Wu2). Therefore, we obtain the privacy leakage of\nI(Xn;F1, F2|Zn) (a)\n\u2264 I(Xn;F1|Zn) + I(Xn;F2|Zn) + 2\u03f5\u2032n = I(Xn;Fv1 |Zn) + I(Xn;Fu1 |Zn, Fv1)\n+ I(Xn;Fv2 |Zn) + I(Xn;Fu2 |Zn, Fv2) + 2\u03f5\u2032n (b) \u2264 6\u03f5\u2032n (65)\nwhere (a) follows by (38) and (39) since F2 is almost independent of (F1, Xn, Zn) due to the Markov chain condition F1 \u2212 (X\u0303n1 , Xn, Zn) \u2212 F2 and (b) follows similarly from the corresponding almost independence results by applying (36)- (39).\nSecrecy Leakage: Similar to the privacy-leakage analysis above, suppose first the virtual scenario with encoder outputs given in (56) and (57), and then calculate the leakage for the original problem by subtracting H(K) = 2nR0 from the leakage calculated for the virtual scenario. Thus, we obtain\nI(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;W1,W2, F1, F2|Zn)\n= I(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ; \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\u2212 2nR0 (a) = H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\n\u2212H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 )\u2212 2nR0 (b) = H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\u2212H(Un1 , Un2 , V n1 , V n2 |X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 )\n+H(V n1 |\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 ) +H(V n2 |V n1 , \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 ) +H(Un1 |V n1 , V n2 , \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 ) +H(Un2 |Un1 , V n1 , V n2 , \u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2, X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 )\u22122nR0\n(c) \u2264 H(\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2|Zn)\u2212 nH(U1, U2, V1, V2|X\u03031, X\u03032) + 4n\u03f5\u2032n \u2212 2nR0 (66)\nwhere (a) follows because (\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2)\u2212(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 )\u2212Zn form a Markov chain, (b) follows since (Un1 , U n 2 , V n 1 , V n 2 ) determine (\u010eW1, \u010eW2, F1, F2), and (c) follows since (V n1 , V n 2 , U n 1 , U n 2 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) are i.i.d. and because (Fv1 ,Wv1 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) can reliably recover V n 1 by (40) and, similarly, (Fv2 ,Wv2 , V n 1 , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) can reliably recover V n2 by (41) both due to the Markov chain condition (V n1 , V n 2 ) \u2212 (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 ) \u2212 Y n. Recoverability of (Un1 , Un2 ) follows similarly by (42) and (43). The terms in (66) can be obtained from the terms in (58) by replacing X with (X\u03031, X\u03032). Thus, we apply the results of the decodability analyses from [3, Section V-A], applied to (58) above, also to (66) such that by replacing X with (X\u03031, X\u03032) in (61), we have\nI(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;W1,W2, F1, F2|Zn) \u2264 n ( [I(U1, U2;Z|V1, V2)\u2212 I(U1, U2;Y |V1, V2) + \u03f5]\u2212\n+ I(U1, U2; X\u03031, X\u03032|Z)\u2212 2R0 + 5\u03f5\u2032n ) . (67)\nFurthermore, if we have\nR0 \u2265 max{I(U1; X\u03031|V1, V2, Y ), I(U2; X\u03032|V2, U1, Y )}+ 2\u03f5\nthen by applying entirely similar steps as in (64) after replacing Xn with (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ), we obtain the secrecy leakage\nI(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;W1,W2, F1, F2|Zn)\n\u2264 nI(V1, V2; X\u03031, X\u03032|Z). (68)\nSimilarly, after replacing Xn with (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) in (65), one can upper bound the secrecy leakage for the high private key-rate case, i.e., R0 is greater than or equal to the maximum of (I(V1; X\u03031|Y ) + I(U1; X\u03031|V1, V2, Y ) + 4\u03f5) and (I(V2; X\u03032|V1, Y )+I(U2; X\u03032|U1, V2, Y )+4\u03f5), by 6\u03f5\u2032n for some \u03f5\u2032n > 0 such that \u03f5 \u2032 n \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e.\nSuppose public indices (F1, F2) are generated uniformly at random and encoders generate (V n1 , V n 2 , U n 1 , U n 2 ) according to PV n1 V n2 Un1 Un2 |X\u0303n1 F1X\u0303n2 F2 that can be obtained from the binning scheme applied above. Such a procedure effectuates a joint probability distribution that is almost equal to PV1V2U1U2X\u03031X\u03032XY Z one can obtain from the fixed distribution given in (11) [47, Section 1.6]. Since both leakage metrics are expectations over all possible realizations (F1 = f1, F2 = f2), using the selection lemma [48, Lemma 2.2] we prove Lemma 1 by choosing an \u03f5 > 0 such that \u03f5 \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e. The time-sharing random variable Q, for which we impose PQV1V2 = PQPV1|QPV2|Q, enlarges the rate region via convexification."

The proof of the outer bound follows by letting \u03b4n \u2192 0 and using the support lemma [49, Lemma 15.4] for the cardinality bounds.\nAPPENDIX II PROOFS OF LEMMAS 3 AND 4\nProof: The proof of the inner bound for the weak eavesdropper setting follows by using the same random binning steps used in the proof of Lemma 1, so the same communication rates are achieved.\nUsing the definitions given in (56) and (57), and applying similar steps to (58) we have the secrecy leakage\nI(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;Wj , Fj , Fj\u2032 |Zn)\n= I(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ; \u010eWj , Fj |Zn) + I(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;Fj\u2032 |\u010eWj , Fj , Zn)\u2212 nR0\n(a) \u2264 H(\u010eWj , Fj |Zn)\u2212H(\u010eWj , Fj |X\u0303nj ) + \u03f5\u2032n \u2212 nR0 (b) = H(\u010eWj , Fj |Zn)\u2212H(Unj , V nj |X\u0303nj ) +H(V nj |\u010eWj , Fj , X\u0303nj ) +H(Unj |\u010eWj , Fj , X\u0303nj , V nj ) + \u03f5\u2032n \u2212 nR0 (c) \u2264 H(\u010eWj , Fj |Zn)\u2212nH(Uj , Vj |X\u0303j)+2n\u03f5\u2032n+\u03f5\u2032n\u2212nR0 (93)\nwhere (a) follows for some \u03f5\u2032n > 0 such that \u03f5 \u2032 n \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e since Fj\u2032 is almost independent of (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 , Zn) by (36)-(39) and because\nFj\u2032 \u2212 (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 , Zn)\u2212 (Fj , \u010eWj) (94) (\u010eWj , Fj)\u2212 X\u0303nj \u2212 (Zn, X\u0303nj\u2032) (95)\nform Markov chains, (b) follows since (Unj , V n j ) determine (\u010eWj , Fj), and (c) follows because (\u010eWj , Fj , X\u0303nj ) can recover V nj by (40)-(41) and (V n j , \u010eWj , Fj , X\u0303 n j ) can recover U n j by (42)-(43), respectively, which follow since we have\nH(Vj |X\u0303j) (c.1) = H(Vj |X\u0303j , Vj\u2032 , Y )\n\u2264 H(Vj |Vj\u2032 , Y ) \u2264 H(Vj |Y ) (96)\nand\nH(Uj |Vj , X\u0303j) (c.2) = H(Uj |Vj , X\u0303j , Vj\u2032 , Uj\u2032 , Y )\n\u2264 H(Uj |Uj\u2032 , Vj , Vj\u2032 , Y ) \u2264 H(Uj |Vj , Vj\u2032 , Y ) (97)\nwhere (c.1) follows from the Markov chain condition Vj \u2212 X\u0303j \u2212 (Vj\u2032 , Y ) and (c.2) follows from the Markov chain condition Vj \u2212 Uj \u2212 X\u0303j \u2212 (Vj\u2032 , Uj\u2032 , Y ).\nNext, we provide a single letter upper bound on the term H(\u010eWj , Fj |Zn) in (93) by applying the results in [3, Section V - A] that consider six different decodability cases, which are applied also to (66). However, for the weak eavesdropper setting, the conditional entropy term measures only the jth encoder\u2019s leakage, unlike in (66) where the leakage is with respect to both encoders. Therefore, we have to adapt our analysis to the decoding order imposed. If j = 1, we should then consider a decoder that observes not only Y n but (Y n, V n2 ) to measure the leakage about (U n 1 , V n 1 ). Furthermore, if j = 2, we should then consider a decoder that observes (Y n, V n1 , U n 1 ) to measure the leakage about (Un2 , V n 2 ). Since the information leakage cannot decrease when the decoder obtains less information, we can apply the results in [3, Section V-A], as being applied in [26, Eq. (69)] to the secure and private source coding model with one encoder, by replacing Y with (Y, Vj\u2032), so by (93) we obtain\nI(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;Wj , Fj , Fj\u2032 |Zn) \u2264 n ( [I(Uj ;Z|Vj)\u2212 I(Uj ;Y, Vj\u2032 |Vj) + \u03f5]\u2212\n+ I(Uj ; X\u0303j |Z)\u2212R0 + 3\u03f5\u2032n ) + \u03f5\u2032n. (98)\nBy replacing (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) with X n and applying entirely similar steps, one can show that we have the privacy leakage\nI(Xn;Wj , Fj , Fj\u2032 |Zn) \u2264 n ( [I(Uj ;Z|Vj)\u2212 I(Uj ;Y, Vj\u2032 |Vj) + \u03f5]\u2212\n+ I(Uj ;X|Z)\u2212R0 + 3\u03f5\u2032n ) + \u03f5\u2032n. (99)\nIf the private-key rate is such that R0 \u2265 (max{I(U1; X\u03031|V1, V2, Y ), I(U2; X\u03032|V2, U1, Y )} + 2\u03f5), by using the definitions in (62) and (63) we then have the secrecy leakage\nI(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ;Wj , Fj , Fj\u2032 |Zn)\n= I(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ; \u010eWj , Fj |Zn)+I(X\u0303n1 , X\u0303n2 ;Fj\u2032 |\u010eWj , Fj , Zn) (a) \u2264 I(X\u0303nj ; \u010eWj , Fj |Zn) + \u03f5\u2032n (b) \u2264 nH(X\u0303j |Z)\u2212H(X\u0303nj |Zn, V nj ,Wvj , Fj) + \u03f5\u2032n (c) \u2264 nI(Vj ; X\u0303j |Z) + 2\u03f5\u2032n (100)\nwhere (a) follows because Fj\u2032 is almost independent of (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 , Z\nn) by (36)-(39) and since (94) and (95) form Markov chains after replacing \u010eWj with \u010eWj , (b) follows because (Wuj + Kj) is independent of (V n j , X\u0303 n 1 , X\u0303 n 2 , Z\nn) due to the one-time padding with a uniform and independent private key, and (c) follows because V nj determines (Wvj , Fvj ) and because by (37) and (39) Fuj is almost independent of (V nj , X n, Zn). Similarly, by replacing (X\u0303n1 , X\u0303 n 2 ) with X\nn, one can show that we then have the privacy leakage\nI(Xn;Wj , Fj , Fj\u2032 |Zn) \u2264 nI(Vj ;X|Z) + 2\u03f5\u2032n. (101)\nFurthermore, for the high private key-rate regime, we can apply entirely similar steps as in (65) to show that negligible privacy and secrecy leakages are achieved.\nThe proof of the outer bound for the communication rates and distortion follows from the proof of Lemma 2. Furthermore, for the secrecy- and privacy-leakage outer bound terms, one can lower bound the term \u2212I(Uj,i;Yi|Vj,i) in [26, Eqs. (76)(h) and (81)(i)] by the term \u2212I(Uj,i;Yi, Vj\u2032,i|Vj,i), so we omit the proof.\nOnur Gu\u0308nlu\u0308 (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree (Highest Distinction) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey in 2011; M.Sc.
