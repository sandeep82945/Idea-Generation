    "abstractText": "Acriflavine is a multipurpose drug that shows antibacterial, antiviral, antimalarial, and antifungal activities. The remarkable native fluorescence of acriflavine is exploited in analytical chemistry field as an efficient probe for analysis of pharmaceutical and biological compounds. The fluorescent probe action of acriflavine is based on the remarkable fluorescence turning\u2010off via formation of ion\u2010pair complexes with acidic drugs at a specific pH. Herein, the acidic drug aceclofenac is analysed for the first time using acriflavine as a fluorescent probe. Aceclofenac can form an ion\u2010pair complex with acriflavine at pH 8.5, and hence it partially turns off the fluorescence intensity of acriflavine over a con\u2010 centration range of 1\u201320 \u03bcg/mL. The fluorescence quenching was monitored at 502 nm following an excitation at 265 or 451 nm. The reaction stoichiometry between acriflavine and aceclofenac was found to be 1:1 using limit\u2010 ing logarithmic method. The type of quenching was confirmed to be static using Stern\u2013Volmer plot. The method showed low values of quantitation limit (0.89 \u03bcg/mL) and detection limit (0.29 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, the method was linear (r = 0.9999), accurate, precise (RSD < 1.7%), robust, and specific. The proposed method was successfully employed to analyse aceclofenac in its dosage forms with high %recovery (98\u2013101%). Additionally, GAPI and AGREE approaches were used to guarantee the suggested techniques\u2019 greenness, and the findings showed an excellent level of greenness.",

            "text": "Acriflavine (ACF) (Fig.\u00a0 1) is a multipurpose drug that was used as an antibacterial drug before the discovery of penicillin [1, 2]. Besides its antibacterial activity, ACF is reported to have antiviral (against HIV), antimalarial, and anticancer activities [3\u20135]. Recently, it was proved that ACF has a powerful inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 and hence it can be used for treatment of COVID-19 infection [1, 6]. Besides its biological and medicinal functions, it can be used as a selective fluorescent probe for analysis of acidic compounds such as ascorbic acid [7], sulfasalazine [8], and cefipime [9]. Its analytical applications are mainly based on its native fluorescence properties that could be exploited to be used as a fluorescent probe for analysis of various compounds. As a fluorescent probe, it can be quenched via the interaction of its basic function groups with acidic compounds (carboxylate or sulfonates), forming ion-pair complexes with lower fluorescent properties [7, 9, 10]. Therefore, its application could be extended to numerous acidic pharmaceutical compounds. In *Correspondence: Amal A. El\u2011Masry dr.amal90@mans.edu.eg Abdallah M.

It is widely used to relieve the painful inflammations associated with low back pain, ankylosing spondylitis, extraarticular rheumatism, scapulohumeral periarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis [11, 12].\nNumerous methods were reported for the analysis of aceclofenac in pharmaceutical formulations and/or biological fluids. The reported methods include spectrophotometric [13\u201316], spectrofluorometric [15], liquid chromatographic [17\u201320], capillary electrophoretic [21], and electrochemical [22, 23] methods. The spectrofluorimetric method [15] relied on monitoring the native fluorescence of aceclofenac in a phosphate buffer medium (pH 8) at 355\u00a0 nm after excitation at 250\u00a0 nm. The reported method had a narrow linear range of 2\u20138\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL. Therefore, we aimed to develop a more sensitive method with a wider linear range for analysis of aceclofenac.\nHerein, ACF fluorescent probe was used for the first time to analyse aceclofenac with a wider linear range (1\u201320\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and a low detection limit (0.29\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). The merits of the proposed method involved simplicity, specificity, high accuracy, adequate sensitivity, and rapidity. In addition, the evolved method was employed to analyse aceclofenac in its pharmaceutical dosage form with low RSD (< 1.5%) and high recovery values (98\u2013101%). The greenness of the developed method was estimated using Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and Analytical\nGREEnness (AGREE) approaches, which confirmed the excellent greenness of the fluorescent probe."

The cause of quenching may rely on the following possible interactions: collisional quenching, excited-state interreactions, molecular rearrangement, and ground-state complex formations. It is an important issue to assess the quenching type in our study to inspire the mechanism of quenching. Stern\u2013Volmer curves are built up using the equation:\nwhere [C] is the drug\u2019s molar concentration, F and Fo are ACF\u2019s relative fluorescent intensities when the drug is present and absent, respectively. KSV stands as the Stern\u2013 Volmer constant. All results of the proposed method were conducted after adjusting excitation wavelength at 451\u00a0nm.\nBy graphing Fo/F against [C], the Stern\u2013Volmer plots were created, and the linearity of the plots (r = 0.993, 0.992, and 0.99) predicts whether dynamic or static quenching will occur. Also, by creating Stern\u2013Volmer graphs at three different temperatures, the temperature dependency was examined (Fig.\u00a07).\nThe KSV in Table\u00a0 1 decreases as temperature rises, which is a sign of static quenching. We ultimately decided that ACF and aceclofenac create a non-fluorescent complex, and its stability is decreased upon increasing temperatures.

The method was rectilinear over the range of 1.0\u201320\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for aceclofenac as demonstrated in Table\u00a02.\nBoth detection and quantitation limits were calculated according to the ICH Q2 (R1) recommendations [26] using the following equations, LOD = 3.3 Sa/b and\nLOQ = 10 Sa/b, in which LOD refers to the limit of detection, LOQ refers to the limit of quantitation, \"Sa\" denotes standard deviation of the intercept, and \"b\" denotes the slope of the calibration curve.\nThe results in Table\u00a0 2 indicates low values of LOD (0.29\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and LOQ (0.89\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), which are suitable to assay aceclofenac in its pharmaceutical dosage form.\nTo assess the accuracy of the developed method, a comparison spectrophotometric method [16] was performed to compare the results with those obtained from our proposed method.

In accordance with the degree of environmental effect on various parameters, five pentagrams were drawn and colored (each pictogram is divided into 3 or 4 sections) using the GAPI approach, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 10. A high environmental impact is\nguaranteed by the color red, a medium environmental effect is conveyed by yellow, and a low environmental impact is indicated by green [28]. The method became more environmentally friendly and sustainable as the number of green-shaded areas increased. Seven green sections were displayed in Fig.\u00a0 10. This manifestation affirmed the sustainability of the suggested method and supported its suitability for utilization in routine pharmaceutical analysis.\nAGREE is an innovative way to assess how environmentally friendly the suggested technique is. The evaluation of AGREE was conducted using the 12 Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) principles. Twelve portions, each representing one of different GAC principles, make up the perimeter of the clock-like-AGREE graph. The pictogram\u2019s unique color (ranging from dark green (1.0) to red (0.0)) represents each parameter\u2019s score [29].

First, the sensitivity factor was investigated; the executed approach was found to be 2\u2013103 times more sensitive than some published methods [13\u201316, 21, 23]. Despite the fact that other reported methods [17\u201320, 22] were more sensitive than the evolved method, the ecological part that employed green chemistry in the evolved method gave it a competitive advantage. In contrast to previously published methods, all solvents and reagents utilised in the suggested approach were safe and eco-friendly, causing no negative impacts on the environment. Hazardous, toxic, explosive solvents and reagents were employed in significant quantities in previously published methods [13\u201320, 22, 23]. Furthermore, time is a crucial consideration when developing a new quantitative method. ACF probe is characterized by its ultra-fast determination, in contrast to these\nmethods [17\u201320] which are time consuming and need lengthy conditioning, washing, and analysis. Only one spectrofluorometric approach [15] for quantification of aceclofenac was described, but it was less sensitive and had a limited linear range when compared to the evolved method. Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2 summaries the comparison between the proposed technique and the other published ones. The findings confirmed the superiority of the proposed method over the previously published methods."
