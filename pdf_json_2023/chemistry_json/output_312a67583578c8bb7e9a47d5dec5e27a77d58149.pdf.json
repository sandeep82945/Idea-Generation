    "abstractText": "In a \u201csmart\u201d corrosion-protective coating system, both the active anti-corrosion and the early corrosion detection of underlying metals are highly required. It is practical significant to develop materials that possess self-detecting of the early local corrosion and self-healing of coating defects simultaneously. The organic compound 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) is an effective inhibitor and a fluorescent sensor probe for corrosion of aluminum alloy. Therefore, a layer double hydroxide (LDH) nanocontainer film loaded with the 8HQ was developed for the active corrosion protection purpose of aluminum alloy AA2024. In corrosive environments, the 8HQ are released from LDH film to inhibit the corrosion process, leading to the loss of the complexation with Al3+ ions in LDH laminates, thus turning off fluorescence. Results show that the LDH film loaded with 8HQ composites can improve the anti-corrosion performance of the film by releasing corrosion inhibitors on demand. Simultaneously, due to the complexation of 8HQ and Al3+ ions, the LDH film is fluorescent at the initial stage under ultraviolet light, and then becomes non-fluorescent at the corrosion sites, indicating the corrosion evolution process of the coating. The 8HQ-loaded LDH film with self-healing and self-detecting dual functions provides promising opportunities for the effective corrosion protection of aluminum alloy due to its \u201csmart\u201d and multifunctional properties.",

            "text": "Aluminum alloy AA2024 is widely used in the aviation industry due to its good mechanical properties [1]. Nevertheless, AA2024 often appears pitting corrosion or intergranular corrosion by the existence of intermetallic compounds, which affects the service process [2]. For a long time, the protection of aluminum alloy depended on the traditional chromate conversion coating [3]. However, on account of the serious harm of chromate toxicity to the human body and the environment, chromate conversion technology has been gradually banned [4]. Therefore, the development of a chromium-free treatment has become a hotspot in the research of aluminum alloy corrosion protection [5]. Layered double hydroxide (LDH), as a new surface treatment technique of aluminum alloy, has the potential to replace chromate conversion coating [6]. The chemical formula of the LDH can be expressed as [M2+1\u2212xM3+x(OH)2]x+An\u2212x/n\u00b7mH2O. M2+ and M3+ are divalent and trivalent metal cations, respectively, which occupy octahedral pores of the brucite-like hydroxides and form a metal hydroxides layer. An\u2212 is an anion which occupies the inter-layer of the metal hydroxides layer [7]. LDH has the unique advantage of anion exchange and can be replaced by other anions in the preparation process, making it an effective nano-storage for corrosion inhibitors [8]. In the process of corrosion prevention, the corrosion inhibitor anions loaded in the LDH inter-layer are stimulated and released by the external corrosion media, and the corrosive anions can be captured at the same time [9] to enhance the corrosion resistance [10,11] and self-healing performance [12,13] of the substrate.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16093483 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 2 of 17\nHowever, the self-healing ability of the LDH film can diminish over time due to the erosion caused by harsh conditions. This can significantly weaken the protective ability of the coatings, ultimately leading to the corrosion of the metal substrates [14]. Generally, the initial stage of corrosion is invisible to the naked eye. Visibility to the naked eye means that corrosion has already developed and expanded [15]. Therefore, before obvious corrosion occurs, autonomous warning by early corrosion detection is of great significance for extending the life-time of coatings and metal substrates. Common sensing species in selfdetecting coatings include color indicators (1,10-phenanthroline [16], phenolphthalein [17]) and fluorescent indicators (8-hydroxyquinoline [18], coumarin [19]). The coloration signal may be negatively influenced by either the color of the coating or the corrosion products [20]. The occurrence of localized corrosion of metals is accompanied by the production of metal ions and the acidification of the immediate environment [21]. Theoretically, the detection of local corrosion can be achieved through changes in fluorescence behavior resulting from the influence of metal ions and hydrogen ions [22]. The ideal fluorescent indicator should also respond to local pH or metal ions changes associated with corrosion resulting in \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescence or \u201cturn-off\u201d fluorescence. The organic compound 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) is a class of common photosensitive compound, which has a good affinity for aluminum. It can be combined with Al3+ to form 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (AlQ3), which can emit a fluorescence of a certain wavelength and intensity under ultraviolet irradiation [23]. Therefore, 8HQ and its derivatives have been used as fluorescent corrosion indicators. An investigation was conducted on a coating containing a complex (AlQ3) of Al3+ ions with 8HQ, to develop a fluorescent technology for predicting corrosion in aluminum alloy [23]. Fluorescent spots were clearly visible under UV light after conducting salt spray tests, namely corrosion pitting under an optical microscope, whereas there was no clear change under visible light. The corrosion process of aluminum alloy AA6061 can be well monitored by using 8HQ as photosensitive compound and corrosion weightlessness method [24]. Meanwhile, it was reported that 8HQ were dispersed into the inter-layer region of hydrotalcite-like compound using anion exchange method, in which Al3+ coordinated with 8HQ. This hydrotalcite-like compound has the potential to serve as a novel luminescent functional material [25]. In addition, 8HQ is famous for its excellent bonding and chelating behaviors. The strong coordination of 8HQ and its derivatives with metal surfaces results in the formation of various coordination complexes, which in turn enhances their inhibition behaviors. At present, 8HQ and its derivatives are applied to effective and green corrosion inhibitors for steel, copper, aluminum, and magnesium alloys [26]. In 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution, 8HQ inhibitor molecules were adsorbed on a 7075 aluminum alloy surface, resulting in an increase in inhibition efficiency up to 96%. It was confirmed that 8HQ could be used as an effective corrosion inhibitor for aluminum alloy in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution [27]. As a type of mixed inhibitor, 8HQ reduces the rate of both anodic and cathodic reactions by creating an insoluble chelate Al(HQ)3 on AA2024-T3 surface to hinder the adsorption of chloride ions [28]. The intercalation of 8HQ anions has no obvious effect on the microstructure of MgAl hydrotalcite coating on aluminum substrate, but confers the coating long-term corrosion resistance [29]. A successful fabrication of 8HQ intercalated Mg-Al base LDH coating on AZ31 was achieved. Due to the ability of anion exchange and chelation to form Mg(HQ)2 redeposition, magnesium alloy exhibits good long-term corrosion protection and self-healing properties [30]. Similar conclusions have been strongly confirmed by many other studies [31\u201333]. This study demonstrates a novel approach to achieving simultaneous corrosion sensing and protection by developing a composite film that is loaded with 8HQ (corrosion inhibitor and fluorescent indicator) and synthesized using a two-step process (the hydrothermal process and the anion exchange process). The intercalation of 8HQ into LDH enables fluorescence emission when complexing with Al3+ in the laminates. Furthermore, the release of 8HQ from the LDH film by anion exchange with Cl\u2212 results in fluorescence quenching when there is no interaction with Al3+. This process enables the early detection\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 3 of 17\nof corrosion and marks a significant advancement in the field of corrosion sensing. Additionally, the use of 8HQ as an organic corrosion inhibitor for aluminum alloy highlights the potential for this material to provide both sensing and protection functions. Overall, the development of this composite film represents an innovative and promising approach to addressing the challenges associated with corrosion detection and prevention."

The LDH-NO3 film in Figure 1a is composed of typical vertically-grown nanosheets [34], and the cross-linked hexagonal nanosheets almost cover the whole substrate surface, which is in accordance with our previous studies [11,35,36]. Figure 1b\u2013e show the LDH-8HQ films with different anion exchange reaction times. No obvious changes in morphology and structure can be observed as compared to that without an anion exchange reaction [31]. It can be seen that after the intercalation with 8HQ, the color of the modified film seems to evenly change from white to yellow [29], as shown in the insets in Figure 1a,e. With the loading time of 8HQ, the nanosheets are thicker and the surface is more uniform and dense, indicating that the growth of the LDH film loaded with 8HQ for 6 h is better, which may further enhance the corrosion resistance of the LDH film.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 4 of 18\nThe tests were conducted in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution at room temperature, after stabilizing the open circuit potential (OCP) of the working electrode in the electrolyte.

The Tafel dynamic potential polarization test was conducted with a scanning speed of 1 mV\u00b7s\u22121, and the scanning range was from \u22120.25 V to + 0.5 V relative to the OCP.\n2.5. Fluorescence Performance Test The fluorescence performance test was studied using XS-600M3G fluorescence microscope to monitor the change of fluorescence intensity of the LDH films. The fluorescence intensity of the sa ples after immersion in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution for different days was analyzed, and then the fluorescence self-detecting mechanism was revealed.\n3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Effect of Anion Exchange Reaction Time on the Morphology and Structure of the LDH Films\nThe optical photographs and SEM surface micrographs of the LDH films are presented in Figure 1. The LDH-NO3 film in Figure 1a is c mposed of typical vertically-grown nanosheets [34], and the cross-linked hexagonal nanosheets almost cover the whole substrate surface, w ich is in accorda ce with our previ us studies [11,35,36]. Figures 1b\u2013e show the LDH-8HQ films with different anion exchange reacti n times. No o vious changes in morphology and structure can be observed as compared to that without an anion exchange reaction [31]. It can be seen that after the intercalation with 8HQ, the color of the modified film seems to evenly change from white to yellow [29], as shown in the insets in Figures 1a,e. With the loading time of 8HQ, the nanosheets are thicker and the surface is more uniform and dense, indicating that the growth of the LDH film loaded with 8HQ for 6 h is better, which may further enhance the corrosion resistance of the LDH film.\nFigure 1. Surface SEM images of (a) the LDH-NO3 film and the LDH-8HQ films with different anion exchange reaction times: (b) 5 min, (c) 30 min, (d) 1 h, (e) 6 h.\nIn order to further study the elemental composition and distribution of the LDH films, Figure 2 shows the cross-section morphologies and corresponding EDS mapping results of the LDH films before and after loading the 8HQ corrosion inhibitor. The samples were encapsulated and fixed with epoxy resin to facilitate SEM observation [37]. A large number of Al, Zn, N, and O elements are distributed in the LDH-NO3 film in Figure 2a,\nFigure 1.

T e samples were encapsulated and fixed with epoxy resin to facilitate SEM observation [37]. A large number of Al, Zn, N, and O elements are distributed in the LDH-NO3 film in Figure 2a, among which the Al element comes from the AA2024 matrix, and the Zn, N, and O elements mainly come from the LDH-NO3 film, suggesting that the LDH-NO3 film is densely grown and tightly bonded on the surface of the matrix [38]. In addition, the thickness and structure of the LDH films can be qualitatively analyzed through the cross-section morphologies and corresponding EDS mapping results [39\u201341]. The thickness of the LDH-NO3 film is roughly 2 \u00b5m, and after anion exchange reaction loading 8HQ for 6 h, the thickness changes\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 5 of 17\nsignificantly to about 6 \u00b5m. It is worth noting that the C element primarily from 8HQ is concentrated on the LDH-8HQ film in Figure 2b, which signifies the existence of 8HQ in the LDH film through anion exchange process. The LDH-8HQ film grows uniformly and vertically from the bottom layer and has strong adhesion with the substrate. The thickness of the LDH film loaded with NO3\u2212 to 8HQ anions is gradually increased, which is more conducive to blocking the penetration of aggressive ions into aluminum alloy.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 5 of 18\namong which the Al element comes from the AA2024 matrix, and the Zn, N, and O elements mainly come from the LDH-NO3 film, suggesting that the LDH-NO3 film is densely grown and tightly bonded on the surface of the matrix [38].

Two major characteristic diffraction peaks of the LDH-NO3 film show that the reflection intensity of (006) and (003) decrease. It is speculated that a certain angle of reflection is required for the XRD detection of the LDH film, which indicates that the LDH film is grown perpendicular to the metal substrate and has the definite orientation [42\u201344]. On the other hand, the observed low (003) reflection intensity may be due to the high atomic scattering factor of M-Al-hydroxide (the \u201chost\u201d layer) [45,46], which may be caused by the loss of crystallinity [44,47].

From the partial enlargement in Figure 3, with the progress of anion exchange reaction, the diffraction reflection (003) moves to lower angles, which confirms that 8HQ inhibitor anions are successfully intercalated into the LDH galleries [30,31,34]. The characteristic peaks of the LDH-8HQ film are more evident after loading 8HQ for 6 h. Based on the analysis of surface and cross-section SEM, it is confirmed that the LDH-8HQ film grown for 6 h has a dense morphology and good crystal structure.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 6 of 17\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 6 of 18\nenlargement in Figure 3, with the progress of anion exchange reaction, the diffraction reflection (003) moves to lower angles, which confirms that 8HQ inhibitor anions are successfully intercalated into the LDH galleries [30,31,34].

Based on the analysis of surface and cross-section SEM, it is confirmed that the LDH-8HQ film grown for 6 h has a dense morphology and good crystal structure.\nThe FTIR spectra of the LDH films before and after modification with 8HQ are recorded in Figure 4 for more insights into the chemical bonding. In addition, the FTIR spectra of the 8HQ powder are studied for reference. The spectra of all the films exhibit characteristic absorption peaks that are commonly associated with LDH. A prominent and broad absorption band located at approximately 3500 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the hydroxyl stretching vibration m (OHstr), which arises from hydroxyl groups in the hydrotalcite-like layer as well as water molecules in the inter-layer [10,35,36]. Furthermore, another absorption band observed at around 1630 cm\u22121 results from the hydroxyl bending vibration \u03b4 (H2O) of water molecules [25,35]. The absorption band recorded at 1384 cm\u22121 corresponds to the stretching vibration of inter-layer NO3\u2212 [39,48]. Compared with the LDH-NO3 film, the NO3\u2212 characteristic absorption band weakens after intercalation with 8HQ, which is likely due to the occurrence of anion exchange reaction [8]. At low wavenumber range (400\u2013700 cm\u22121), the bands are primarily related to M-O, M-O-M, and O-MO bond vibrations [30,43,49]. The obtained results provide strong evidence for the successful preparation of the LDH-NO3 film.\ni 3.

At low wavenumber range (400\u2013700 cm\u22121), th bands are primarily related to M-O, M-O-M, and O-M-O bond vibrations [30,43,49]. The obtained results provide strong evidence for the successful preparation of the LDH-NO3 film. The spectra of the LDH-8HQ films loaded with 8HQ for different times are roughly similar to those of the 8HQ powder. The vibration peaks at 1577 cm\u22121 and 1376 cm\u22121 in the spectra are ascribed to the C-C stretching [30,43], while the peak at 1500 cm\u22121 is attributed to the CC-CN stretching vibration within the quinoline ring [49,50]. The peaks observed at 1473 cm\u22121 and 3045 cm\u22121 are respectively derived from the C-H bending and stretching vibrations of the 8HQ ring system [43]. Additionally, the absorption peak at 1284 cm\u22121 is associated with the C-N stretching vibration within the quinoline ring [49]. It is noteworthy that the C-O stretching vibration peak of the 8HQ shifts from 1093 cm\u22121 to 1110 cm\u22121 (the LDH-8HQ films), which suggests the formation of C-O-M coordination bonds between some of the C-O bonds in the 8HQ and the Al3+ ions present in the LDH laminates [25,49,50]. The SEM, XRD, and FTIR analysis collectively demonstrate the successful intercalation of 8HQ, resulting in the formation of LDH coating on AA2024 substrate.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 7 of 17 Materials 2023, 16, 3483 7 of 18\nFigure 4.

Effect of Anion Exchange Reaction Time on the Corrosion Resistance of the LDH Films To assess the corrosion resistance of the obtained LDH films, the potentiodynamic polarization measurement was conducted in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The resulting potentiodynamic polarization curves are exhibited in Figure 5. The electrochemical parameters are determined using the Tafel linear extrapolation method [51]. These parameters include corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current density (Icorr), anodic slope (ba), cathodic slope (bc), and polarization resistance (Rp), which are illustrated in Table 1. A lower value of Icorr indicates the higher corrosion resistance [52,53].

The polarization curves of 8HQ-loaded LDH films prepared with different anion exchange reaction times for 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 6 h are observed in Figure 5.

After being loade with 8HQ for 6 h, the LDH\u20138HQ film demonstrates a significant improvement of 93.9% inhibition efficiency compared to the blank sample.

These findings are consistent with the SEM observation, which indicates that the LDH film structure is well-formed after 6 h of loading 8HQ and can serve as an effective barrier against the penetration of aggressive electrolytes. As a nondestructive technique, the EIS measurement was performed to estimate the corrosion resistance of the samples in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution [56]. The EIS curves, both the Nyquist and the Bode impedance plots, can effectively reflect the LDH films corrosion performance in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The anti-corrosion performance of the LDH films can be characterized by the capacitive circuit radius in the Nyquist plot in Figure 6a [57]. The charge transfer process manifests the characteristics of the double electric layer at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode, and the charge transfer resistance causes the capacitive circuit [54,58]. The capacitive circuit radius of the LDH-8HQ film loaded for 6 h is the largest, followed by other loading times. This evidence indicates that the LDH film loaded with 8HQ for 6 h has the best protective performance, which reveals the permeability of the corrosion electrolyte into the substrate is lower than that of other films, thus reducing the corrosion rate of the substrate. The observed results are consistent with the polarization curves in Figure 5. In general, the overall anti-corrosion performance of the LDH films can be revealed by the low frequency impedance modulus (|Z| at 0.01 Hz) in the Bode plots of the impedance modulus in Figure 6b [11,56,57]. The 6 h of 8HQ-loaded LDH film displays the highest |Z| value compared with that of the other films, which further demonstrates that it has a superior protection for AA2024. Two time constants can be found in the Bode plots of the phase angle in Figure 6b, which occur in the medium and low frequency regions. The time constant is corresponding to the presence of thin oxide film between the AA2024 substrate and the LDH layer. Moreover, another time constant is in regard to the LDH film response at the interface of corrosive solution [11,59]. With the time of loading the 8HQ inhibitor, the second time constant related to the Bode phase angle plot is extended over a wide frequency range (10\u22121\u2013103 Hz). The frequency expansion of the phase angle is the largest for 6 h of the 8HQ-loaded LDH film compared with other times [58].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 9 of 17\nMaterials 2023, 16, 3483 9 of 18 and the electrode, and the charge transfer resistance causes the capacitive circuit [54,58].

Therefore, the existence of dense film effectively impedes the corrosion reactions, which is in good agreement with the previous analysis (Figures 1 and 2).

The corresponding electrochemical parameters are presented in Table 3. There is a significant reduction in Icorr and an obvious shift of Ecorr towards more noble values after immersion for 3 d of the LDH-NO3 film. Then, the Icorr further reduces to 1.008 \u00d7 10\u22124 A\u00b7 cm\u22122 after 7 d. The intercalated NO3\u2212 anions in LDH layer entrap chloride anions by anion exchange process with immersion time, which enhances the corrosion resistance of AA2024 [57,62]. For the LDH\u20138HQ film, the Ecorr shifts positively from \u22121.095 to \u22121.076 V, while the Icorr reduces from 1.511 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1.179 \u00d7 10\u22124 A\u00b7cm\u22122 after immersion for 3 d. Excitingly, the lowest Icorr (5.586 \u00d7 10\u22125 A\u00b7cm\u22122) is achieved after further immersion to 7 d. The Icorr of the LDH\u20138HQ film is approximately one order of magnitude lower than those of the LDH\u2013NO3 film, indicating that it has a superior self-healing ability in the corrosion evolution process. The significant improvement in corrosion inhibition is demonstrated by the remarkable decrease in Icorr and the obvious positive shift in Ecorr after the LDH loading with 8HQ. Through the anion exchange between 8HQ and chloride anions, chloride anions are entrapped into the LDH galleries [8,63]. The ba values move to higher values and the bc values move to lower values in the presence of 8HQ [27]. Both anodic and cathodic reactions are suppressed during the inhibitor intercalation, which suggests that the 8HQ reduces anodic dissolution and also retards the oxygen reduction reaction [64,65].

Meanwhile, the phase angle of the LDH\u20138HQ film in high frequency is larger than that of other films, which proves that it has protective film on aluminum alloy after 7 d [69,70]. The impedance modulus at low frequency (|Z| at 0.01 Hz) of the LDH films before and after loading 8HQ were collected at different immersion times (x = 0, 3, and 7 d), as shown in Figure 8c. The |Z| values for the LDH\u2013NO3 film continually increase with the immersion time. This phenomenon benefits from the special structure and anion exchange property of the LDH. The LDH\u2013NO3 film improves the corrosion resistance of aluminum alloy by capturing corrosive chloride anions and releasing nitrate ions existing between the inter-layer [71]. The LDH\u20138HQ film keeps the maximum |Z| value after 7 d of immersion, showing the positive impact for the existence of 8HQ on the corrosion inhibition process. Furthermore, the self-healing effect of the film enhances its ability to protect against corrosion [72,73]. The same EIS behaviors are observed for the samples after longterm immersion. The electrochemical parameters are obtained by fitting the EIS data with the described equivalent electric circuit and the findings are summarized in Table 4. The rise in Rct values, as reported in previous studies [27,74,75], is ascribed to the augmentation in resistance and the adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the surface of aluminum alloy. This suggests that the film has the ability to self-heal any defects that may occur during the corrosion process [43,52].\nFigure 8.

            "text": "In conclusion, the LDH film loaded with 8HQ has been proved to be used for the corrosion self-healing and self-detecting of aluminum alloy. The LDH\u2013NO3 film was in-situ grown on aluminum alloy surface, and the LDH film loaded with 8HQ anions for 6 h was prepared by anion exchange property. The macroscopic morphologies show that the color changed from white to yellow evenly. The micromorphologies have no obvious change, and the LDH nanosheets are uniformly and densely covered on AA2024 surface. The LDH-8HQ film thickness is increased to about 6 \u00b5m, and tightly combined with the substrate. The results of potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicate that the LDH film loaded with 8HQ for 6 h improves the corrosion resistance of the matrix. The long-term corrosion resistance test manifests that the adsorption of 8HQ can significantly inhibit the anodic and cathodic reactions and can be used as an efficient corrosion inhibitor for aluminum alloy in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The photosensitive compound 8HQ can interact with Al3+, showing obvious fluorescence enhancement or weakening behaviors. It has a self-detecting ability to convey film damage or performance degradation in the form of fluorescent signal (color change). During immersion for 21 d in corrosive solution, the LDH\u20138HQ film changes from fluorescence enhancement to fluorescence quenching. The 8HQ-loaded LDH film has proven to be the successful strategy of corrosion sensor and inhibitor for aluminum alloy. The quick release of 8HQ from the LDH film triggers \u201cturn-off\u201d fluorescence and inhibits corrosion to restore the film protection. The \u201csmart\u201d LDH films with sensor and protection dual functions provide promising opportunities to meet the autonomous life-cycle control of materials and to reduce the risk of accidents.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.Z.; methodology, Y.Z., X.Z., and Y.W.; validation, X.Z., Y.Y. and Y.W.; formal analysis, X.Z.; investigation, X.Z., Y.Y., and Y.W.; resources, Y.Z.; data curation, Y.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, X.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, X.Z., Y.Y., Z.Z., and Y.Z.; supervision, Y.Z.; funding acquisition, Y.Z.
