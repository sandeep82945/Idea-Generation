    "abstractText": "Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that results from widespread immune complex deposition and secondary tissue injury. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used clinically to treat SLE, while its exact mechanism has still remained elusive. Some studies have shown that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a vital role in the regulation of SLE. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of HCQ on the apoptosis of MDSCs in lupus mice and its possible molecular regulatory mechanism. Methods: We constructed the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced lupus model in mice. The proportion and apoptosis of MDSCs were measured by flow cytometry. CD81-overexpressed adeno-associated virus was intraperitoneally injected into the lupus mice. We also transfected the CD81 siRNA into bone marrow-derived MDSCs, and employed qRT-PCR and Western blotting to quantify the level of CD81. Results: The results showed that HCQ ameliorated IMQ-induced lupus symptoms, and simultaneously inhibited the expansion of MDSCs. In particular, HCQ induced the apoptosis of MDSCs, and also up-regulated the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs, which might indicate the relationship between the expression level of CD81 and the apoptosis of MDSCs. CD81 was further confirmed to participate in the apoptosis of MDSCs and lupus disease progression by overexpressing CD81 in vivo. Molecular docking experiment further proved the targeting effect of HCQ on CD81. And then we interfered CD81 in bone marrow derived MDSCs in vitro, and it was revealed that HCQ rescued the decreased expression level of CD81 and relieved the immune imbalance of Th17/Treg cells. Conclusion: In summary, HCQ promoted the apoptosis of MDSCs by up-regulating the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs, and ultimately alleviated lupus symptoms. Our results may assist scholars to develop further effective thera-",

CD81-overexpressed adeno-associated virus was intraperitoneally injected into the lupus mice. We also transfected the CD81 siRNA into bone marrow-derived MDSCs, and employed qRT-PCR and Western blotting to quantify the level of CD81.\nResults: The results showed that HCQ ameliorated IMQ-induced lupus symptoms, and simultaneously inhibited the expansion of MDSCs. In particular, HCQ induced the apoptosis of MDSCs, and also up-regulated the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs, which might indicate the relationship between the expression level of CD81 and the apoptosis of MDSCs. CD81 was further confirmed to participate in the apoptosis of MDSCs and lupus disease progression by overexpressing CD81 in vivo. Molecular docking experiment further proved the targeting effect of HCQ on CD81. And then we interfered CD81 in bone marrow derived MDSCs in vitro, and it was revealed that HCQ rescued the decreased expression level of CD81 and relieved the immune imbalance of Th17/Treg cells.\nConclusion: In summary, HCQ promoted the apoptosis of MDSCs by up-regulating the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs, and ultimately alleviated lupus symptoms. Our results may assist scholars to develop further effective therapies for SLE.\nKeywords: Hydroxychloroquine, SLE, IMQ-induced lupus, MDSCs, Apoptosis, CD81\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Some studies have shown that HCQ mainly accumulates in acidic vesicular lysosomes, affects the functions of proteasomes by increasing intracellular vacuolar pH, and also inhibits the functions of endolysosomes regulating autophagy, calcium signaling, and toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune responses (Wu et\u00a0 al. 2017; Wallace et\u00a0 al. 2012; Nirk et\u00a0 al. 2020). However, the mechanism of HCQ in treating SLE has not been fully clarified, and the possible therapeutic target remains unclear.\nMyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells originated from myeloid progenitor cells, and can be classified into two subsets, granulocyte-like MDSCs (G-MDSCs) and monocyte-like MDCSs (M-MDSCs) (Lees et\u00a0 al. 2011). Compared to other myeloid cells, MDSCs exhibited an immunosuppressive capacity to inhibit proliferation of T cells and alter regulatory T cell (Treg) by generating effector molecules, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) (Gabrilovich et\u00a0 al. 2017; Vlachou et\u00a0 al. 2016). Expansion of MDSCs is generally associated with inflammatory processes that emerge in response to stable immunological stress, altering both magnitude and quality of the myelopoietic output (Veglia et\u00a0 al. 2018; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj 2009). The significant accumulation of MDSCs has been found to be positively correlated to disease activity in SLE patients. Our laboratory and other researchers reported the same symptom in various mouse models of lupus (Dong et\u00a0al. 2015; Wu et\u00a0al. 2016; Li et\u00a0al. 2019a, b; Ji et\u00a0al. 2016; Li et\u00a0al. 2019a, b). In previous studies, the of MDSCs in male (NZB \u00d7 NZW) F1 mice constitutively increased compared with that in female mice and that was regulated by testosterone (Trigunaite et\u00a0al. 2013). Various effects of MDSCs on target cells have proven to be a critical pathogenic factor in SLE, including dysregulation of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and differentiation of Treg (Ji et\u00a0 al. 2016). MDSCs can also induce podocyte injury by increasing the levels of ROS in lupus nephritis (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2018a, b). In conclusion, investigating the regulation of MDSCs may provide new insights into the therapy of SLE.\nCD81 is a member of the tetraspanin family, known as a receptor of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can mediate HCV envelope protein 2 (E2) to bind to Raji cells (Str\u00f6h et\u00a0al. 2018; Chen et\u00a0al. 2011). Transfection of CD81 into\nmelanoma cells lacking endogenous CD81 expression could significantly enhance the migrating, invasion, and metastatic abilities of melanoma cells (Hong et\u00a0al. 2014; Bari et\u00a0 al. 2011). CD81 in trophoblasts can induce the imbalance between Th17/Treg cells by promoting the expression of IL-6 in preeclampsia and aggravating the disease progression (Ding et\u00a0 al. 2019). And restoration of CD81 expression induced a G1 cycle arrest and apoptosis in gastric tumor (Yoo et\u00a0 al. 2013). Furthermore, the expression of CD81 in B cells from SLE patients was down-regulated, and that could be correlated with abnormal activation of B cells (especially antibody secreting cells) and disease activity (especially at the active stage) (Henriques et\u00a0al. 2016; Abu-Zahab et\u00a0al. 2017; Dang et\u00a0al. 2022). It suggested that CD81 could be a potential indicator for the diagnosis of SLE.\nOur study aimed to assess the effect of HCQ on MDSCs during the treatment of SLE. HCQ inhibited the expansion of MDSCs, accompanied with the induced apoptosis and altered immunosuppressive function of MDSCs in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced lupus mice. Further research revealed that the role of CD81 participate in the apoptosis of MDSCs increased by HCQ. SLE-like symptoms were attenuated by up-regulating the expression level of CD81, and CD81 also increased the apoptosis of MDSCs directly. Hence, these findings demonstrated that HCQ could ameliorate lupus by inducing the apoptosis of MDSCs through upregulating the expression level of CD81, which further indicate the significance of MDSCs in lupus."

HE and PAS staining displayed that glomerular proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration and interstitial inflammation were relieved in the HCQ-treated lupus group (Fig.\u00a01A). Splenomegaly was severe in IMQinduced lupus mice and HCQ significantly relieved it (P < 0.05) (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1A). As a prominent characteristic of lupus, the albumin level decreased with HCQ treatment (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1B). In addition, high serum levels of antibodies have been reported\nFig. 1 Amelioration of HCQ on IMQ-induced lupus inhibits MDSCs expansion.

B The frequency of MDSCs in blood and spleen and the statistical results of the frequency of MDSCs from control groups, IMQ groups, HCQ groups and IMQ + HCQ groups (n = 6 mice/ group). C The purity of MDSCs isolated from spleen was assessed by a MDSC Isolation Kit. D Cells from spleen of normal C57BL/6J female mice were co-cultured with or without MDSCs from mice of different groups in different ratios (MDSCs: Splenocytes) at 1:2 and 1:4, respectively for 3 days. CFSE was distributed equally in proliferative CD4+ T cells. E The mRNA expression levels of MDSCs function-related genes in MDSCs isolated from spleen was measured by qRT-PCR (n = 4 mice/group). Data represent the mean scores \u00b1 SEM. *P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01, ***P \u2264 0.001\nto contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE. Notably, lupus mice treated with HCQ showed lower serum levels of IgG, IgM and anti-dsDNA (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1C). Our previous studies have shown that the number of MDSCs was elevated in SLE patients, MRL/lpr mice, IMQ-induced and pristane-induced lupus mice (Li et\u00a0al. 2019a, b; Ji et\u00a0al. 2016; Li et\u00a0al. 2019a, b). Then, the effects of HCQ on MDSCs were investigated by flow cytometry. The proportions of MDSCs in blood (P < 0.01) and spleen (P < 0.01) significantly decreased in the HCQ-treated lupus group (Fig.\u00a01B).\nTo explore the effects of HCQ on the functions of MDSCs, we purified MDSCs from spleen in four groups of mice by using the MDSC Isolation Kit, and the sorting purity was nearly 94% (Fig.\u00a01C). The proliferation of CD4+ T cells was inhibited by MDSCs in MRL/lpr mice (Iwata et\u00a0 al. 2010). MDSCs suppression assay showed that the proliferation capacity of CD4+ T cells was inhibited when splenic cells were co-cultured with sorted cells. It demonstrated the immunosuppressive function of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells (Fig.\u00a0 1D). In addition to the inhibition of T cell proliferation, some gene were also involved in the regulation of MDSCs functions. The binding of cytosolic calcium-binding protein S100A8/S100A9 and gp91phox, p47phox led to the suppressive effects of MDSCs (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2022). The subunits of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) potentiates the activation of NADPH oxidase, which induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by MDSCs (Xue et\u00a0al. 2019). The activation of T cells was also inhibited by the synthesis of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Raber et\u00a0al. 2014). IL-10 produced by MDSCs has been shown to be involved in the development of Tregs and impair CD8+T cell function (Park et\u00a0 al. 2018). So, we detected these genes by qRT-PCR to trace the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs. HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of S100A8, Arg-1, iNOS, etc., and the inhibitory effects of HCQ on MDSCs function were evident (Fig.\u00a01E). We also measured ROS levels of MDSCs in the blood and spleen, and HCQ-treated lupus group had the lower ROS levels of MDSCs (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S2A). Na\u00efve CD4+ T cells are activated to differentiate into Th17 cells, which cause autoimmunity and inflammation, and Treg cells, which inhibit autoimmune response and maintain immune homeostasis (Lee 2018). Given the basis of our research, MDSCs could promote polarization of Th17 cells by secreting IL-1\u03b2, and induce production of ROS to inhibit differentiation of Treg cells (Ji et\u00a0al. 2016). We further assessed the effects of HCQ on differentiation of Th17/Treg cells in lupus mice, and the immune imbalance of Th17/Treg cells in SLE was alleviated by HCQ treatment, which decreased the proportion of Th17 cells and increased the proportion of Treg cells\n(Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S2B, C). These findings suggested that the ameliorative effects of HCQ on IMQ-induced lupus might be related to the suppression of MDSCs accumulation and function.\nHCQ induces apoptosis of\u00a0MDSCs and\u00a0increases the\u00a0level of\u00a0CD81 in\u00a0MDSCs Apoptosis regulates the persistence of MDSCs during inflammation, which is related to viability and proportion of MDSCs (Li et\u00a0al. 2018; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2018a, b; Yang et\u00a0al. 2019). To investigate the mechanism of HCQ affecting MDSCs, we found that apoptosis of MDSCs increased by HCQ adequately. First, immunofluorescence assay was used to label Gr-1-positive cells in the cryopreserved spleen tissues. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated-TUNEL dye indicated the apoptotic Gr-1-positive cells. The results confirmed that mice in the HCQ-treated lupus group were predisposed with the induction of apoptosis in Gr-1-positive cells compared with that in the IMQ-only group (Fig.\u00a0 2A). We next detected the proportion of Annexin V+ MDSCs in the blood and spleen of mice. As the results shown, the proportion of Annexin V+ MDSCs decreased in lupus mice compared with that in healthy control (P < 0.05), whereas HCQ treatment rescued the downside apoptosis (P < 0.01) (Fig.\u00a02B). MDSCs were further isolated from spleen (Fig.\u00a01C). We also examined the expression levels of apoptosis-related markers in purified MDSCs by Western blotting, including caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (BclXL) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). The expression level of caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 in MDSCs increased in HCQ-treated mice (P < 0.05). Bcl-XL, one of the members of anti-apoptotic family, was elevated in MDSCs of lupus mice and decreased after HCQ treatment. The expression level of Bax was higher in the HCQ-treated lupus group (P < 0.05) (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S3A). All features indicated that HCQ could increase the apoptosis of MDSCs in mice with lupus.\nTo identify the target regulating the apoptosis of MDSCs, we detected the expression level of apoptosisrelated genes in MDSCs. The results showed that the expression level of CD81 was significantly reduced in lupus mice, which suggested that CD81 might play a crucial role in the apoptosis of MDSC (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S3B). In our research, we observed that HCQ treatment significantly increased the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs, no matter in blood or in spleen (Fig.\u00a0 2C). Besides, the expression level of CD81 in purified MDSCs from murine spleens was also up-regulated in the HCQtreated lupus group, compared with that in lupus group (P < 0.05) (Fig.\u00a02D).\nFurthermore, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 3A, BM cells were acquired from normal mice and cultured with GM-CSF\nFig. 2 HCQ induces apoptosis of MDSCs and increases the level of CD81 in MDSCs. A Immunofluorescence detection of the apoptotic effects of HCQ on Gr-1+ cells in spleen. Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm (n = 3 mice/group). B The percentage of Annexin V+ in MDSCs in blood and spleen was determined by FACS (n = 6 mice/group). C The percentages of CD81+ in MDSCs were determined by FACS in blood and spleen (n = 6 mice/group). D Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of CD81 in purified MDSCs isolated from spleen (n = 4 mice/group).

B, C. The proportions (B) and apoptotic rate (C) of bone marrow-derived CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs were determined by FACS (n = 4). D The percentages of CD81+ in MDSCs were determined by FACS in BM-derived MDSCs (C) (n = 4). E Western blot was used to detect the expression of CD81 protein in BM-derived MDSCs (n = 4). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). *P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01, ***P \u2264 0.001\nand IL-6 to induce MDSCs, namely BM-derived MDSCs (BM-MDSCs), in\u00a0 vitro. To generate lupus environment, BM-MDSCs were stimulated with treated with a TLR7 agonist R848 (100\u00a0ng/mL), accompanied by different concentrations of HCQ (2, 6, and 20\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL). The number of MDSCs was decreases by HCQ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a0 3B). As expected, HCQ showed an obvious promoting effect on the percentage of Annexin V+ BM-MDSCs, and the most significant effect appeared at the concentration of 20\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (P < 0.001) (Fig.\u00a03C). The expression levels of apoptosis-related markers in BMMDSCs were determined as well. The expression level of Bcl-XL in BM-MDSCs was highly inhibited by HCQ, whereas the expression levels of Bax, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly induced by HCQ treatment (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S4). We examined genes associated with apoptosis and also found significant differential expression of CD81 after R848 administration (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S3C). The percentage of CD81+ MDSCs was increased by HCQ under R848 treatment, detected by flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a0 3D). What\u2019s more, a dose-dependent promotion on CD81 protein was found under various concentrations of HCQ treatment by western blot (Fig.\u00a0 3E). These findings were consistent with those achieved in\u00a0 vivo, and further demonstrated that HCQ could promote the apoptosis of MDSCs in SLE. Taken together, we supposed that the promotion of HCQ on the apoptosis of MDSCs might be related to CD81.\nCD81 plays a\u00a0crucial role in\u00a0HCQ treatment by\u00a0increasing the\u00a0apoptosis of\u00a0MDSCs We then investigated the concentrate role of CD81 in MDSCs in\u00a0 vivo. CD81-overexpressed adeno-associated virus was intraperitoneally injected at the beginning of establishing the IMQ-induce lupus model. In the IMQ + AAV-CD81 group, the proportion of CD81+ in MDSCs was highly elevated compared with that in the IMQ + Vector group in both blood and spleen (Fig.\u00a04A), and we found the similar trend in MDSCs isolated from spleen (Fig.\u00a04B). These results confirmed that the mouse model of CD81 overexpression was successfully constructed. To explore the effects of CD81 on MDSCs, we first assessed its suppressive effects on accumulation of MDSCs. The total number of CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs increased in the IMQ + Vector group, while overexpression of CD81 significantly decreased the number of MDSCs in blood and spleen (Fig.\u00a04C).\nFurthermore, as data displayed in Fig.\u00a0 4D, CD81 overexpression remarkably increased the percentage of Annexin V+ in MDSCs in blood and spleen, compared with that in the IMQ + Vector group. The expression levels of apoptosis-related markers also changed as expected. When CD81 was overexpressed, the expression\nlevel of Bcl-xl in isolated MDSCs was decreased, whereas the expression levels of Bax, Caspase3 and Cleaved caspase3 were significantly induced (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S4A).\nLupus\u2011like syndrome is\u00a0attenuated by\u00a0overexpression of\u00a0CD81 in\u00a0mics with\u00a0lupus We surprisingly found that overexpression of CD81 ameliorated the lupus-like syndrome directly. As results shown, CD81 improved splenomegaly (Fig.\u00a05A). HE and PAS staining of kidney sections also showed that CD81 mitigated the glomerulonephritis, mesangial matrix diffuse expansion and infiltration of lymphocytes (Fig.\u00a05B). The serum levels of IgG, IgM, anti-dsDNA and urine protein were lower in the IMQ + AAV-CD81 group, compared with those in the IMQ + Vector group (Fig.\u00a0 5C, D). In addition, we observed the effects of CD81 on Th17 and Treg cells, which CD81 overexpression recovered the increased proportion of Th17 cells and decreased proportion of Treg cells in blood and spleen of mice with lupus (Fig.\u00a05E, F). In summary, CD81 could relieve the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells in IMQ-induced lupus mice, which might contribute to the regulation of the functions of MDSCs.\nHCQ rescues the\u00a0expression level of\u00a0CD81 to\u00a0increase MDSC apoptosis To further verify the relationship between HCQ and CD81 in the apoptosis of MDSCs, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down the expression level of CD81 in BM-MDSCs and evaluated the effects of HCQ on the expression level of CD81. We chose one of the three siRNAs according to the silencing efficiency. After simultaneous treatment, the results showed that HCQ concentration was directly proportional to the increased expression level of CD81 in MDSCs (Fig.\u00a0 6A). CD81 protein was inhibited by CD81 siRNA and HCQ could strongly reverse it (Fig.\u00a0 6B). These findings suggested that the induction in the apoptosis of MDSCs might be achieved by promoting the expression level of CD81 in HCQ-treated group.\nSince HCQ could up-regulate the expression level of CD81, we further investigated the effects of HCQ on the apoptosis of MDSCs and immune balance of Th17/Treg cells when CD81 was interfered. The massive accumulation of BM-MDSCs was caused by CD81 siRNA, and reduced by HCQ treatment (Fig.\u00a0 6C). As expected, HCQ treatment could significantly increase the percentages of Annexin V in BMMDSCs when transfecting BM-MDSCs with CD81 siRNA (Fig.\u00a0 6D) and altered the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in BM-MDSCs (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S4B). Subsequently, we co-cultured\nnormal mouse splenocytes with BM-MDSCs treated for 72\u00a0h. The results revealed that CD81-interfered BMMDSCs impaired balance of Treg/Th17 cells, while the imbalance was reversed in HCQ-treated BM-MDSCs compared with that in CD81-interfered BM-MDSCs group. HCQ increased the proportion of Treg cells and\ndecreased the differentiation of Th17 cells (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S5A, B). These findings supported that HCQ induced the apoptosis of MDSCs and relieved immune imbalance of Th17/Treg cells through up-regulating the expression level of CD81."

MOE\u2019s Site Finder falls into the category of geometric methods as no energy models were used. Alternatively, the relative positions and accessibility of the receptor atoms were considered along with a rough\nclassification of chemical type. The Site Finder methodology was based on Alpha Shapes which were a generalization of convex hulls developed by Edelsbrunner in 1995.\nIn total, 4 possible sites were found by MOE. The detailed data of the sites were depicted in Fig.\u00a07B. Rank sites according to their Propensity for Ligand Binding (PLB) score. The size and shape of the 2nd site were close to ligand HCQ (Fig.\u00a0 7C). Thus, this binding site was selected for the following docking experiment.\nTo investigate the binding mode of HCQ with CD81, docking experiments were carried out. The docking score of HCQ was \u2212 70.01\u00a0 kcal/mol for CD81. This computational result indicated that HCQ could well interact with CD81.

The curve of atomic potential energy (Fig.\u00a0 7F) indicated that the results of docking experiments were relatively steady. Such molecular docking results confirmed that HCQ well interacted with CD81 and the combinatory effect was relatively steady."

            "text": "Recent studies have described the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic properties, clinical efficacy and safety of HCQ in the treatment of SLE (Carter et\u00a0al. 2016; Olsen et\u00a0al. 2013; Fanouriakis et\u00a0 al. 2019). The underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate the effect of HCQ on SLE have been poorly understood. In the pathological process of SLE, our sight is focused on MDSCs, which accumulated in SLE patients and lupus mice (Li et\u00a0al. 2019a, b; Ji et\u00a0al. 2016; Li et\u00a0al. 2019a, b). MDSCs are perceived as a myeloid-derived heterogeneous cell population composed of immature macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells. Immune suppression is the major function of MDSCs in the pathogenesis of cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders, including inhibiting the proliferation of T cells, accompanied with the upregulation of arginase, NO, ROS and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Groth et\u00a0al. 2019). It\u2019s clearly that accumulation of MDSCs inhibit tumor immune responses in antigen-specific and non-specific manners, and induce tumor angiogenesis capability, which promote tumor progression (Umansky et\u00a0al. 2016). Unlike the deleterious role of MDSCs in tumor, it would be an enormous challenge to confirm a unifying hypothesis showing the functions of MDSCs in various autoimmune diseases. MDSCs were involved in the disease course of SLE, also accompanied with the arguable function (Wang et\u00a0al. 2021; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2014). Iwata et\u00a0al. have identified the accumulation of MDSCs in the MRL-Fas lpr mice for the first time (Iwata et\u00a0 al. 2010). Some studies indicated that MDSCs induced expansion of regulatory B cells via iNOS, and inhibited the cytokine-mediated differentiation of na\u00efve B cells into plasma cells, to relieved the injuries in lupus mice (Trigunaite et\u00a0 al. 2013). What\u2019s more, infusion of MDSCs derived from C57BL/6 mice reduced the levels of anti-dsDNA antibody in serum and proteinuria in roquinsan/san lupus mice (Park et\u00a0 al. 2016). While other studies pointed out the opposite function of MDSCs in lupus. Wu et\u00a0al. have reported that the increased MDSCs in peripheral blood of SLE patients were positively correlated with the severity of lupus (Wu et\u00a0 al. 2016). We have also found that MDSCs promoted Th17 polarization and inhibited Treg differentiation by IL-1\u03b2 secretion to\nFig. 6 HCQ rescues the expression levels of CD81, leading to increase the apoptosis of MDSCs. A, B qRT-PCR (A) and Western blotting (B) was used to detect the expression level of CD81 in BM-derived MDSCs (n = 4). C The number of BM-derived MDSCs was determined by FACS (n = 4). D The effects of HCQ on the apoptosis of BM-MDSCs after interfering CD81 were measured by FACS (n = 4). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). *P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01, ***P \u2264 0.001\naggravate disease in MRL/lpr lupus mice (Ji et\u00a0al. 2016). Overall, the role of MDSCs in the disease mechanism of SLE remains controversial and intangible.\nIn our study, we found that HCQ inhibited the expansion of MDSCs in IMQ-induced lupus mice. The same results were obtained in\u00a0 vitro, which stimulated BMMDSCs with R848 to generate lupus environment. R848 could increase the number of MDSCs, and different concentrations of HCQ decreased it without a dose-dependent effect. These phenomena hint the crucial function of MDSCs involved in the course of SLE. To figure out the reason for the changes in the number of MDSCs, we detected relevant signaling molecules of MDSCs, and found that the apoptosis of MDSCs was significantly influenced after HCQ treatment. Combined with the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes, HCQ was found to have a facilitation effect on the apoptosis of MDSCs in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. The results were consistent with the decreased number of MDSCs after HCQ treatment. Furthermore, we found that CD81 plays an important role in the regulation of MDSC apoptosis. Some studies demonstrated that lack of CD81 expression was related to SLE disease activity, and it might be a potential marker for the diagnosis of SLE patients (Abu-Zahab et\u00a0al. 2017). HCQ recovered the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs of mice with lupus. CD81 overexpression increased the apoptosis of MDSCs, and interfering the expression level of CD81 in MDSCs showed opposite results. Besides, CD81 overexpression alleviated the disease activity of lupus mice directly, as illustrated by improved indexes of pathology. All outcomes verified the key role of CD81 in the apoptosis of MDSCs. It is noteworthy that HCQ could rescue the low-level of the expression level of CD81 induced by CD81 siRNA in MDSCs. Taken together, the increase of apoptosis of MDSCs is directly correlated to CD81 signaling pathway in the treatment of lupus with HCQ. What\u2019s more, in terms of molecular structure, we found that the direct binding mode and affinity between HCQ and CD81, which confirmed that HCQ could target CD81 and interact well\nwith CD81, which indicated that HCQ might induced the expression of CD81 in two ways\u2014a direct bonding manner and an indirect manner through signaling pathways.\nIn our study, HCQ not only affected the apoptosis of MDSCs, but also influenced their immunosuppressive functions in mice with lupus. HCQ weakened the production of ROS, and affected the proliferation rate of CD4+ T cells. The capacity of MDSCs to regulate the balance of Th17/Treg cells might be a critical pathogenic factor in SLE, thus, we counted the number of Th17 and Treg cells in lupus mice, and confirmed that HCQ could improve the immune imbalance of Th17/Treg cells through increasing the proportion of Treg cells and decreasing the differentiation of Th17 cells. A previous study also confirmed that HCQ inhibit differentiation of Th17 cell and production of IL-17 (Yang et\u00a0al. 2018). Meanwhile, when CD81 was over-expressed in lupus mice, the number of Th17 cells was reduced, and Treg cells expanded. The alteration in immune balance corresponded to relief of SLE symptoms. In general, HCQ relieved immune imbalance of Th17/ Treg cells by up-regulating the expression level of CD81. These findings indicated that various functions of MDSCs are involved in the course of SLE. MDSCs proved to be extremely important in autoimmune disease.\nTaking all these factors into consideration, MDSCs serve as captivating targets for immunotherapy by suppressing T cell activation and function, which play two opposite effects in the regulation of immune balance. We have demonstrated that HCQ mitigated SLE by target a series of anti-inflammatory pathways involving MDSC and its immunosuppressive function. Our research confirmed the crucial participation of MDSCs in SLE, which provided novel therapeutic modality to treat SLE and other autoimmune diseases."
