    "abstractText": "Background Ritlecitinib is an oral Janus kinase 3/tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma family inhibitor undergoing parallel clinical development for alopecia areata, vitiligo, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Objective As studies read out simultaneously, strategic planning of population pharmacokinetic model development and evaluation is required to ensure timely decisions. Methods Data from healthy participants and patients from 12 clinical trials between December 2014 and July 2021 were included: seven phase I studies in healthy participants and organ impairment, five phase II/III studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. Population pharmacokinetic models consisted of stepwise procedures to accommodate data availability and the model\u2019s application to answering clinical development questions. At each iteration of the model update, parameters of the next model were re-estimated by leveraging previous information and new data. Results Three model development lifecycle iterations of the ritlecitinib population pharmacokinetic model were conducted to support alopecia areata, vitiligo, and ulcerative colitis study readouts. Initial structural modeling based on healthy participant data (and some rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata data) in iteration 1 provided a platform for comprehensive covariate testing during iteration 2, and model evaluation and implementation of the frequentist prior approach in iteration 3. The final model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and direct-response non-stationary clearance and bioavailability driven by concentrations in the peripheral compartment. Conclusions The present approach demonstrated the evolution of three population pharmacokinetic models with accumulating data, addressed clinical drug development questions related to systemic exposures of ritlecitinib, and informed the approved product label.

            "text": "Model development occurs through a series of iterative cycles. At each node of the model development lifecycle, new information is incorporated and, after assessment, the model becomes available for application in clinical drug development. As the drug moves from phase I through to phase III, the accruing data are used to evolve the population pharmacokinetic (PK) model in iterations to help with decisions needed for progressing the drug through each development phase. Availability of population PK models is important to address questions, inform dose selection and study designs, provide dose recommendations for specific\nsubpopulations, and to provide individual-level exposure estimates for exposure-response models of efficacy and safety endpoints. However, at later stages of the clinical development cycle, sparse data predominate and the utility of methods that leverage prior information (either data or a prior model) to assist in the rapid analysis and evaluation of the newly available data becomes increasingly valuable. These strategies were implemented during consecutive updates of the population PK model for ritlecitinib.\nRitlecitinib (PF-06651600) is an oral Janus kinase 3/ tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma family inhibitor [1, 2] that has completed clinical trials in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The plasma pharmacokinetics of ritlecitinib is approximately dose proportional with a rapid absorption of \u2248\u00a089%\u00a0(fa), an absolute oral\nbioavailability (F) of \u2248\u00a064%, and an elimination half-life of \u2248\u00a02\u00a0h. Ritlecitinib is metabolized by glutathione\u00a0(GSH) conjugation and cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidation with no single enzyme contributing >\u00a025%. Ritlecitinib has demonstrated efficacy in alopecia areata (AA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), vitiligo, and ulcerative colitis (UC) [3\u20137]. Patients with AA who received ritlecitinib had significant hair regrowth by week 24 compared with placebo [8]. Patients with non-segmental vitiligo who received ritlecitinib had a significantly greater change from baseline in the centrally read Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at week 24 than those receiving placebo [3]. Ritlecitinib also has demonstrated a rapid onset of action, with a significant improvement in the partial Mayo Score for patients with UC after 2 weeks and in RA disease scores by 8\u00a0weeks [5, 7].\nThe development of population PK models for ritlecitinib consisted of stepwise procedures to accommodate data availability and the model\u2019s application to timely answering clinical drug development questions (including confirming that expected ritlecitinib exposures were achieved in patient populations, generating individual PK parameters for exposure-response modeling of key efficacy and safety endpoints at the time of study completion, conducting simulations to assess formulation changes or pediatric extrapolation). There were three iterations in the model development lifecycle as described in Fig.\u00a01. The objective of the base model was to define the structure for ritlecitinib pharmacokinetics using intense sampling from healthy participants (HP) and sparsely sampled data from patients with RA or\nAA. The objective of the updated model was to assess if the structure of the base model was adequate at describing ritlecitinib pharmacokinetics for data available from new HP, participants with moderate hepatic impairment, and patient (UC and vitiligo) populations (in addition to all base model data available) and perform stepwise covariate modeling. The objectives of the final model were to externally evaluate the final model\u2019s ability to continue to describe newly available data intensively sampled from HP and participants with severe renal impairment (n = 17) and sparsely sampled from patients with AA (n = 584), to update structural parameters and estimate additional covariate effects using a frequentist prior approach."

The PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM\u00ae applies a frequentist\nprior approach to inform population parameter estimates as opposed to fixing them. Here, a penalty is placed on the maximum likelihood (i.e., the objective function value), which accounts for the deviation of current model parameters from their prior estimate. This approach aims to reduce bias in parameter estimates where the reference population may be slightly different from the previous population used to develop the prior model [15].\nThe evaluation dataset for the final model predominantly consisted of sparse data from the phase II/III study in patients with AA (Table\u00a0S1 of the ESM), such that it was anticipated that informative priors for all structural parameters adopted from the updated model were required to ensure adequate estimation of final model parameters. The final parameter estimates of the updated model were used as the prior during development of the final model and estimating parameters based on the evaluation dataset. The prior distributions of fixed-effect and random-effect (i.e., IIV) parameters from the updated model were assumed to be normally and normal-inverse Wishart distributed, respectively. Initially, the weight of priors on original model parameters were highly informative with low uncertainty (i.e., 10% relative standard error for the prior). Scenarios where fixed-effect parameters were uninformative (variance of parameter estimates set to 10,000) or highly informative (derived from the updated model\u2019s variance-covariance matrix for parameter estimates) were examined. Scenarios where the prior variance of random-effect parameters for IIV were uninformative (dimensions of the variance-covariance matrix for IIV plus 1) or highly informative (dependent on the number of individuals used to build the prior model) were also examined [15]. Parameters quantifying the standard deviation of RUV and new covariates for assessment (such as age, severe renal impairment, and alopecia disease severity) did not include any prior information. The decision to proceed with a set of prior model parameters was based on model convergence (including successful minimization status), interpretation of final parameter estimates (i.e., consistent with expectations of the pharmacokinetics of ritlecitinib), and standard goodness-of-fit diagnostics."

            "text": "The iterative approach was efficient at assessing emerging concentration data throughout the clinical drug development of ritlecitinib. Population PK models are evolving platforms describing the concentration\u2013time relationship for a drug. However, updating model parameter estimates with all available data or every time new information becomes available is time and resource consuming under accelerated drug development paradigms. Ritlecitinib is undergoing parallel clinical development in multiple indications (AA, vitiligo, UC, CD, and RA), such that developing a full population PK model in preparation of phase III completion would have neglected support of concurrent phase II study completions in other indications (i.e., supporting end-of-phase II regulatory interactions, phase III dose selection and rationale, pediatric extrapolation, providing exposure metrics for subsequent efficacy and safety models) [3\u20137].\nThe three ritlecitinib population PK models presented were all available to timely address clinical development questions, and EBEs for individual patients were used in subsequent exposure-response modeling analyses for safety and efficacy endpoints. The structural elements of the population PK model (particularly fixed allometric scaling\nexponents and parameterization of non-stationary CL) were retained in each iteration and parameter estimates were comparable between each model (Table\u00a02). The use of concentrations in the peripheral compartment to drive non-stationary characteristics hypothesizes that ritlecitinib distributing out of the systemic circulation, such as to the site of metabolism, is either inhibiting metabolism or non-productively binding to metabolizing enzymes to reduce overall CL (systemic and first-pass effect). With increasing doses, there were greater than proportional increases in exposure. However, doses greater than 100\u00a0mg approach maximum inhibition on CL/F and F is achieved and there are no apparent changes in CL/F and F with further dose increases as depicted in the PK summary metrics of clinical relevance such as AUC \u03c4 and Cmax (Fig.\u00a05). A similar structural model has been previously applied to clarithromycin, which experiences CYP3A4 autoinhibition [17]. External evaluation and a frequentist prior approach to updating the model upon completion of the phase III AA study was performed owing to a previous iteration of the model being available based on phase II AA concentration data.\nThe structural model was not re-developed with each iteration and was considered to appropriately capture ritlecitinib pharmacokinetics based on HP data from phase I studies and known routes of metabolism and elimination. Rather, prior to each iteration, the structural model was evaluated based on goodness-of-fit diagnostics, VPCs, and changes in estimates for key structural parameters. Covariate modeling proceeded if the previous structural model was considered adequate. Sparse sampling obtained from phase II/III studies offered challenges in evaluating the model\u2019s ability to describe PK data from patients with inflammatory disease owing to the high proportion of trough concentrations that were BLQ, and that terminal concentrations are the most informative at determining differences in CL. Pharmacokinetic sampling from patients was limited to pre-dose and no longer than 4\u00a0h after the dose to reduce the duration of clinic visits for patients. Considering the structural model adequately described the proportion BLQ for the phase I populations, censoring approaches for handling data BLQ were not implemented. It is not likely that ignoring BLQ observations contributed to misspecification of the structural model (i.e., one- vs two- vs three-compartment models) as informed by densely sampled, phase I data and demonstrated adequate representation of the proportion BLQ for these studies. The high proportion of BLQ observations were attributed to the short half-life of ritlecitinib and QD dosing, on average, ritlecitinib is expected to be 97% eliminated after five half-lives (10\u00a0h) [2].\nCovariate analyses identified several predictors of differences in ritlecitinib exposure. Patients with inflammatory disease (i.e., RA, AA, UC, and vitiligo) have lower baseline\nCL/F compared with HP. With respect to steady-state AUC \u03c4, patients with RA, AA, UC, and vitiligo experienced 2.19-, 1.56-, 1.92-, and 1.31-fold increases, respectively, in exposure relative to HP administered the same dose and of\nthe same weight. It has been suggested that infectious and inflammatory disease states alter the activities and expression of drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP [9, 11, 13, 18].

Ritlecitinib is metabolized by glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of GSH with ritlecitinib. Glutathione in its reduced form possesses antioxidant effects by acting as an electron donor to protect cells from reactive oxygen species. Inflammatory or immunological diseases and redox balance are closely related, and the pathogenesis of these diseases has been suspected of being associated with increased reactive oxygen species formation and reduced GSH levels [19]. Therefore, GSH depletion may potentially contribute to the decreased CL observed in patient populations with inflammation or immunological disease. In the absence of individual-level GSH information, only patient population effects can be tested on PK parameters. As ritlecitinib is also metabolized by multiple CYP enzymes, down-regulation of these pathways in the setting of inflammation could also attribute to the lower apparent CL observed in patient populations [20].\nScaling parameters were also used to quantify the magnitude of unexplained variability in the pharmacokinetics between HP and patient populations. It was anticipated that phase II studies would demonstrate greater RUV and IIV owing to heterogeneity in dose administration conditions and the sample collection of which there is less regulation than procedures in phase I studies. However, to evaluate the model structure\u2019s ability to describe apparent non-stationary pharmacokinetics, parameters scaling the degree of variability in the patient population compared to HP were implemented. Variability in disease activity between subjects or patient types, and therefore availability of GSH for conjugation, could potentially explain the higher variability in pharmacokinetics observed patients relative to HP.\nPatients with moderate-to-severe UC demonstrated a 22.4% reduced F relative to other patient populations and HP. Despite the largest decreases in CL/F relative to other populations, overall exposure as summarized by AUC \u03c4 did not exceed that of patients with RA.\nModerate hepatic impairment significantly increases Cmax and AUC \u03c4 by 1.28-fold and 1.32-fold, respectively. The effect on F suggests that first-pass metabolism in these patients is impaired, resulting in more ritlecitinib available to the systemic circulation and decreasing apparent CL. A phase I ritlecitinib study (NCT04016077) observed AUC \u03c4 ratios of 1.18 for moderate hepatically impaired subjects, and no change in Cmax [21]. The final model provides a comprehensive evaluation of the magnitude of hepatic impairment on ritlecitinib exposures in the context of the entire analysis population.\nSevere renal impairment participants demonstrated higher F relative to HP resulting in an average 47% increase in AUC \u03c4 and 41% increase in Cmax at steady state. These results are consistent with a phase I study in severe renal impairment participants (NCT04037865) that demonstrated 55% and 44% increases in steady-state AUC \u03c4 and Cmax, respectively, relative to a shared cohort from another ritlecitinib phase I study (NCT04016077) of an age- and weight-matched normal renal function population [21].\nChronic kidney disease can impact the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are not predominantly renally excreted, such as ritlecitinib. Physiological processes involved in absorption and hepatic metabolism, such as CYP3A4 metabolism, can be affected by chronic kidney disease resulting in reduced first-pass metabolism and increased F [22\u201324]. As ritlecitinib is approximately 60% bioavailable with >\u00a080% fraction absorbed, the ceiling for increases in F due to severe renal impairment is low.\nIntrinsic patient factors that did not demonstrate a statistically or a clinically significant impact on ritlecitinib pharmacokinetics include age, sex, and race, suggesting that inclusion of body weight via allometric scaling adequately accounted for differences between categories within these covariates. The pilot capsule formulation (phase I ritlecitinib study [NCT04004663]) demonstrated a 14% lower Cmax relative to the reference tablet formulation and approximately no difference in AUC \u03c4. These model estimates of the impact of the capsule formulation on ritlecitinib pharmacokinetics are consistent with the results of the phase I study (NCT04004663) and were considered preliminary prior to the results of the pivotal bioequivalence study (NCT04390776) with the to-be-marketed capsule formulation.\nThe updated and final population PK models were used to underwrite the final approved product label for Litfulo\u00ae (ritlecitinib) 50 mg QD for the treatment of severe AA in both adults and adolescents aged 12\u00a0years and older [25]. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contributed to 0.5-fold to two-fold changes from the mean in ritlecitinib exposure (Cmax and/or AUC) were considered clinically relevant[21]. Incorporation of body weight via allometric scaling principles accounted for differences in exposure, and the effect was not considered to achieve a magnitude of clinical relevance to warrant weight-based dose adjustment for the adolescent population (Fig.\u00a04). Population PK modeling approaches confirmed the expectations of the impact of moderate hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment on ritlecitinib exposure, and co-administration with a high-fat meal, such that dose adjustments were also not necessary for these populations (Fig.\u00a04) [21]. No other significant intrinsic covariates within the AA population were identified (such as age and alopecia\ndisease severity), which justified recommendations of no dose adjustments based on ritlecitinib exposure for these groups.\nIn summary, three ritlecitinib population PK models were developed iteratively to evaluate newly available data and highlighted the application of a frequentist prior approach to update model parameter estimates in the context of sparsely sampled data from a phase II/III population. Presentation of the three iterations demonstrated how the understanding of ritlecitinib pharmacokinetics evolved throughout clinical drug development from quantitatively describing the differences in RA, UC, AA, and vitiligo patient populations on CL/F relative to each other and HP, to generating hypotheses related to ritlecitinib accumulation following repeated dosing based on structural model identification and confirmation.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s40262- 023- 01318-3.\nAcknowledgements Writing and scientific support was funded by Pfizer LLC.
