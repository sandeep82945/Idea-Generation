Here, by the first-principles calculations, we propose a two-dimensional ferromagnetic material with high Curie temperature, manganese tetranitride MnN4 monolayer, which is a square-planar lattice made up of only one layer of atoms. The structure is demonstrated to be stable by the phonon spectra and the molecular dynamic simulations, and the stability is ascribed to the \u03c0-d conjugation between \u03c0 orbital of N=N bond and Mn d orbital. More interestingly, the MnN4 monolayer displays robust 2D ferromagnetism, which originates from the strong exchange couplings between Mn atoms due to the \u03c0-d conjugation. The high critical temperature of 247 K is determined by solving the Heisenberg model with the Monte Carlo method.\nBecause of the great application prospect in the fields of electronics, information, energy, and chemical industry, two-dimensional materials have attracted extensive research interest. The quantum confinement effect due to the reduced dimension endows them exotic physical properties in comparison with their bulk counterparts. After graphene was discovered, a variety of 2D materials have been reported in the theoretical and experimental studies1, including boron nitride2, silicene3, transition metal dichalcogenides4, MXenes5, etc. Among them, only a small fraction are magnetic compounds. The Mermin-Wagner theorem states that long-range magnetic ordering is absent in an isotropic 2D Heisenberg system. Based on the belief, such studies on magnetic 2D materials have been ignored or shunned, which limits the development of the magnetic 2D material field. Until 2017, the intrinsic 2D ferromagnetism was found for the first time in CrI3 6 and Cr2Ge2Te6 7 atomic layers, in which the single-site magnetic anisotropy on Cr atoms breaks the isotropy due to the spin-orbital coupling. Since then, the issues concerning 2D magnetism are getting more and more attention.\nIn terms of the thickness of 2D materials, they can be classified into two categories, one contains only one layer of atoms and another is composed of a few layers of atoms, for the examples of graphene and MoS2, respectively. We call the first category single-atom-thick 2D materials, which is related to the thickness limit of film materials and all the atoms are confined in a plane. The typical materials are the graphene, borophene, boron nitride, and g-C3N4\n2,3,8,9 while the common structural pattern is the honeycomb hexagonal lattice. The combination of delocalized \u03c0 bond and sp2 orbital hybridization is the main mechanism to stabilize the planar and hexagonal geometry. And more importantly, there is the real 2D crystal field around each atom in the single-atom-thick 2D materials. It is not only distinct to the crystal field in bulk compound, but also different from that in other slab 2D materials consisting of a few layers of atoms.\nManganese is a special magnetic element because of the half-filled d shell in its electronic configuration of 3d54s2, which is one of the main magnetic ingredients for the ferromagnetic compounds, especially for the ferromagnetic 2D materials. For instance, MnO2, MnS2, and MnSe2 monolayers are intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors with the Tcs of 140 K, 225 K and 250 K, respectively\n10,11. Mn3C12S12 monolayer\n12 and Mn-phthalocyanine (MnPc) sheet13 are ferromagnetic with Tcs of 212 K and 150 K. Recently, hexagonal MnN and pentagonal MnN2 monolayers are also be predicted to be ferromagnetic with Tcs of 368 K and 913 K14,15. We note that these Tcs are computed according to the Ising model, and the values are usually overestimated compared to the Heisenberg model. Inspired by the reported manganese compounds, our question is whether there are some other 2D ferromagnetic manganese nitrides with high Curie temperature?\nIn this work, on the basis of the first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the single-atom-thick MnN4 monolayer with a square lattice is a high-temperature ferromagneton with Tc of 247 K. The \u03c0-conjugation effect play an important role both in the formation of planar geometry and in the ferromagnetic exchange coupling between two Mn atoms.\nThe structural and electronic properties are computed with the plane wave pseudopotential method enclosed in the VASP package, and the projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotential with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional16\u201319 are used. The convergence criteria for total energy and forces are set to be 10\u22125 eV and 10\u22123 eV/A\u030a, respectively. Plane waves with a kinetic energy cutoff of 600 eV are used to expand the valence electron wave functions. Considering the strong correlation of Mn d electrons, the GGA + U method with Ueff = 6.3 eV is applied to compute the electronic and magnetic properties20. The interlayer distance was 16 A\u030a and a k-point mesh was 24\u00d7 24\u00d7 1 for the Brillouin zone integration. To examine the stability,\n2\nthe density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and the supercell method in the PHONOPY program were used to calculate the phonon spectra21. In the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 supercells were employed and the temperature was kept at 1000 K for 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs in the canonical ensemble (NVT)22. The top view and side view of MnN4 structure is displayed in Fig.1(a). The structure has a square lattice with the symmetry of plane group P4m . The lattice parameters are a = b = 4.83 A\u030a . The lengths of Mn-N bond and N=N bond are 1.83 A\u030a and 1.16 A\u030a, shown in Fig.1(b). Its unit cell consists of only one MnN4 moiety, as marked by a dashed line square. These moieties are connected together by the N=N bonds to make up of a planar MnN4 layer, which is a porous monolayer with large square pores. The Mn atom is located at the center of the square of four N atoms. To ascertain the structural stability of the MnN4 monolayer, we first compute the formation energy, and the metal manganese and N2 gas are taken as the reference. The formation energy is defined below\nEform = Etot \u2212 EMn \u2212 2EN2\nn , (1)\nin which Etot, EMn, and EN2 are the total energy, bulk manganese energy per atom, and nitrogen molecule energy, respectively. For comparison, we also compute the formation energies of a few single-layer nitrides including hexagonal MnN, pentagonal MnN2, g-C3N4, and BeN4 monolayers, which have already been synthesized experimentally or investigated theoretically. The formation energy of MnN4 monolayer is 0.09 eV/atom, lower than the ones of other nitrides in Tab. I, which indicates that the MnN4 structure is energetically stable. To examine the dynamic stability of MnN4 monolayer, we perform the phonon calculations. The phonon bands\nTABLE I. The formation energies of five 2D nitride monolayers. The unit is eV/atom.\nhex-MnN pen-MnN2 g-C3N4 BeN4 MnN4 0.28 0.21 0.35 0.12 0.09\nFIG. 2. (a) Phonon energy bands of MnN4 monolayer. (b) Evolution of MnN4 total energy with time at 1000 K.\nare shown in Fig. 2(a), and there is no imaginary frequency for their phonon modes, indicating that MnN4 monolayer is dynamically stable. Then, we perform the first-principles molecular dynamic simulations to examine the thermal stability. The variation of total potential with respect to time is presented in Fig. 2(b), where the energy only fluctuates slightly around a constant and no distinct drop of energy emerges. The insets are the top and side views of the final structure of MnN4 monolayer after 10 ps simulation at the temperature of 1000 K. It can maintain the framework and no breaking of the bonds is found, which confirm the good thermal stability of MnN4 monolayer.\n\u03c0 conjugation is the overlap of one p orbital with another p orbital (or d orbital of transition metals) across an adjacent \u03c3 bond. We first look at the Mn-N=N-Mn chain in the MnN4 monolayer. The bonding distance of the nitrogen dimer is 1.16 A\u030a and it is close to the N=N bond length of 1.2 \u223c 1.3 A\u030a, indicating that there is a N = N double bond between two N atoms. The sketches of N 2p orbitals in a Mn-N=N-Mn chain along x axis are exhibited in Fig. 3, where two py orbitials are aligned side by side to form a \u03c0 bond and two pz orbitials form another \u03c0 bond. Along the Mn-N=N-Mn chain, the two px orbital form a \u03c3 bond between two N atoms. Therefore, there exists strong \u03c0 conjugation originating from two py orbitials and two pz orbitials because of the uncommon geometry of Mn-N=N-Mn chain.\nIn Fig. 3, the DOS of N 2s and 2px states are distributed in the same energy scope and there is no energetic separation between the 2s and 2px orbitals, which is related to the occurrence of very strong orbital hybridization, quite similar to the typical sp2 hybridization of C atoms in graphene. N 2s and 2px orbitals (along Mn-N-N-Mn chain) are mixed to form two hybridized orbitals, one extends to adjacent N atom to form the \u03c3 bond and another extends to Mn atom to form the Mn-N\n3 coordination bond. N element has five valence electrons, the three electrons occupy the py, pz, and one spx hybridized orbital, and the remaining two electrons (lone electron pair) fill the other spx hybridized orbital. For the Mn atom coordinated by four N atoms, the 4s, 4px, 4py, and 3dx2\u2212y2 orbitals is coupled each other to give rise to four dsp2 hybridized orbitals. All the four orbitals lie in the xy plane. It is just the four dsp2 orbital that are coupled to the spx hybridized orbitals from the coordinated N atoms to form the coordination bonds. This is a common situation in phthalocyanine compounds and some 2D metal-organic frameworks23,24. Apart from the \u03c0 bond of N-N dimer and dsp2 hybridization of Mn atom, the \u03c0 bond from two pz orbitals is further mixed to the dxz orbital of Mn atom (see Fig. 3), resulting in the first \u03c0-d conjugation. On the other hand, there is a considerable overlap between the \u03c0 bond from two py orbitals and the dxy orbital of Mn atom in the xy plane, which leads to the second \u03c0-\nd conjugation. It is the special configuration of linear Mn-N=N-Mn chain that causes the occurrence of double \u03c0-d conjugation, which do not happen in the hexagonal and pentagonal networks of MnN and MnN2 monolayers mentioned above. The double \u03c0-d conjugations further elevates the strength of Mn-N bond and lowers the total energy, greatly enhances the robustness of the MnN4 planar structure. Consequently, strong \u03c0-d conjugations is not only the most distinctive feather of MnN4 monolayer but also the main mechanism for the structural stability of this square-planar lattice. Because the MnN4 monolayer contains the d electronic states, we utilize the GGA + U method to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties. The Hubbard U is determined to be 6.3 eV through self-consistent calculations with linear response method20. Fig. 4 shows the partial DOS of Mn five 3d orbitals. The 3d electronic states of Mn atom have a complete spin splitting, and there is almost no overlap between the energy regions of spin-up and spin-down states. Furthermore, the spin-up states are almost entirely occupied and spin-down states are completely empty, which results in the large moment of 4.4 \u00b5B. We build a 2 \u00d7 2 supercell to study the magnetism of the CoN4 monolayer in the ground state. Three magnetic orders, including ferromagetic order (FM) and two antiferromagnetic orders (AFM-I and AFM-II), are displayed in Fig. 5. The energies for AFM-I and AFM-II orders are all higher than that of FM order, revealing that the ferromagnetic order is the magnetic ground state. According to the energies, the neighboring exchange couplings can be figured out from the following expressions,\nJ1 = 1\n4 (EFM \u2212 EAFM\u2212II),\nJ2 = 1\n8 (EFM + EAFM\u2212II \u2212 2EAFM\u2212I)\n(2)\nand the nearest and next-nearest neighboring coupling J1\nFIG. 3. Density of states projected on 2s and 2p orbitals of N atom. The Fermi energy is marked by the vertical dashed line.\nFIG. 4. Density of states projected on 3d partial orbitals of Mn atom. The Fermi energy is set to zero.\nand J2 are -24.0 meV/S 2 and -5.6 meV/S2. In addition, the magnetic anisotropy energy, the energy difference of Mn moment pointing to z and x (or y) axis, is computed to be 0.024 meV.\nWhat is the mechanism of ferromagnetic exchange interaction between two Mn atoms? Along the Mn-N=NMn chain, the dxz , pz, pz, and dxz orbitals are mixed together to form the large \u03c0 orbitals. At first, the two dxz are half-filled, and to make sure the electron can freely move from one dxz orbital to another without spin flipping, the electrons in two dxz orbitals must keep the same spin state. Then, because the d electron number of Mn atom is less than five, the spins are aligned in parallel\n4\naccording the Hund\u2019s rule. Therefore, the Mn moments in the Mn-N=N-Mn chain are parallel, and the ferromagnetic coupling stems from the delocalized electrons associated with the \u03c0-d conjugation effect. Ising model and Heisenberg model are usually used to describe the magnetic interactions of 2D magnetic materials. Ising model is the limit of Heisenberg model with magnetic anisotropy going to infinity. Because of the small magnetic anisotropy in real 2D ferromagnetic materials, Curie temperature is overestimated by Ising model. So, the Heisenberg model is more precise, which has been successfully applied in CrI3 and other synthesized ferromagnetic 2D materials25\u201327. We adopt the Heisenberg model to evaluate the Curie temperature of MnN4 monolayer. The Hamiltonian is defined as\nH = J1 \u2211\n<ij>\n~Si \u00b7 ~Sj + J2 \u2211\n\u226aij\u2032\u226b\n~Si \u00b7 ~Sj\u2032 +A \u2211\ni\n(Siz) 2, (3)\nin which the symbol j and j\u2032 represent the neighboring sites of i site in the square lattice, and A is the singlesite magnetic anisotropic energy. To solve the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the Monte Carlo method with a 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 lattice is used. The magnetization (M) and susceptibility (\u03c7 = < ~M2>\u2212< ~M>2\nkBT ) with respect to temperature\nare presented in Fig. 6. Both of them show a clear ferromagnetic phase transition at 247 K. So, the Curie temperatures (Tc) of MnN4 monolayer is 247 K, which is a relatively high Curie temperature compared to the reported 2D ferromagnetic materials27.\nIn summary, based on the first-principles calculations, we design a single-atom-thick manganese nitride MnN4 with a porous square-planar network. Along Mn-N=NMn chain in the MnN4 monolayer, the dxz, pz, pz , and dxz orbitals are hybridized together to form the large \u03c0 orbitals. The \u03c0-d conjugation is the remarkable feature of the predicted MnN4 monolayer, which is the origins of both structural stability and ferromagnetic couplings\nbetween two Mn atoms. The robust ferromagnetism with the Curie temperature of 247 K is demonstrated by solving the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the Monte Carlo method. Therefore, our results not only predict a new high-temperature ferromagnetic 2D material but also propose a new mechanism of ferromagnetic exchange coupling.\nThis work was supported by the National R&D Program of China (Grants No. 2016YFA0300503 and 2017YFA0302900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 12274458, 11774420, 11974194), and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (Grant No. 20XNLG19)\n\u2217 Corresponding author: qingtaoxie@ruc.edu.cn \u2020 Corresponding author: gaomiao@nbu.edu.cn 1 M.
