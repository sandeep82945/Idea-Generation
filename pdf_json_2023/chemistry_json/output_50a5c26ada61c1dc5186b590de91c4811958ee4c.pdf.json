            "text": "METTL3, a primary methyltransferase catalyzing RNA m6A modification, has been 19 identified as an oncogene in several cancer types and thus nominated as a potentially 20 effective target for therapeutic inhibition, although current options using this strategy are 21 limited. In this study, we targeted protein-protein interactions at the METTL3-METTL14 22 binding interface to inhibit complex formation and subsequent catalysis of RNA m6A 23 modification. Among candidate peptides, RM3 exhibited the highest anti-cancer potency, 24 inhibiting METTL3 activity while also facilitating its proteasomal degradation. We then 25 designed a stapled peptide inhibitor (RSM3) with enhanced peptide stability and formation 26 of the -helical secondary structure required for METTL3 interaction. Functional and 27 transcriptomic analysis in vivo indicated that RSM3 induced upregulation of programmed 28 cell death-related genes while inhibiting cancer-promoting signals. Furthermore, tumor 29 growth was significantly suppressed while apoptosis was enhanced upon RSM3 treatment, 30 accompanied by increased METTL3 degradation and reduced global RNA methylation 31 levels in two in vivo tumor models. This peptide inhibitor thus exploits a mechanism distinct 32 from other competitive-binding small molecules to inhibit oncogenic METTL3 activity. Our 33 findings collectively highlight the potential of targeting METTL3 in cancer therapies through 34 peptide-based inhibition of complex formation and proteolytic degradation. 35 36\n\u00b7\nIntroduction 37\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent RNA modification that plays essential 38 regulatory roles to coordinate a wide range of biological processes, including RNA splicing, 39 stability, and translation1, 2. Dysregulation of m6A modification has been firmly linked to the 40 development and progression of various diseases (e.g., cancers)3. Installation of m6A 41 modifications requires the methyltransferase activity catalyzed by the METTL3-METTL14 42 complex, the former protein serving as the catalytic subunit, while the latter performs RNA-43 binding function; by contrast, m6A removal is mediated by m6A demethylases, such as 44 FTO and ALKBH54. Complex formation is essential for m6A methyltransferase function, 45 and m6A modification is largely lost in the absence of METTL3-METTL14 46 heterodimerization5, 6. Numerous studies have shown that METTL3 is expressed at 47 aberrantly high levels in several cancer types, suggesting a prominent role in cancer 48 progression7, 8, and has been shown to positively regulate cancer development by 49 promoting metastasis and tumor growth in malignancies such as acute leukemia9, liver 50 cancer10, stomach cancer11, lung cancer12, colorectal cancer13, and prostate cancer14. 51 Conversely, other studies have shown that cancer cell growth is dramatically inhibited upon 52 METTL3 knockdown, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating various 53 cancers 15, 16, 17. 54 Although the crystal structure of the METTL3-METTL14 complex has been solved 55 since 201618, progress in developing METTL3 inhibitors has been limited, with the METTL3 56 substrate co-factor, S-Adenyl-methionine (SAM), which is required for methyl group 57 transfer, serving as the most common target for inhibitor design. For example, Kouzarides 58 and co-workers identified the small molecule METTL3 inhibitor, STM2457, which displayed 59 high potency against acute myeloid leukemia in high-throughput screens, but still lacks 60 experimental validation of its efficacy against solid tumors 19. Although other competitive 61 and non-competitive inhibitors that are structurally similar to SAM, such as Sinefungin20, 62 UZH221, and Eltrombopag22, have been shown to exhibit substantial suppression of cancer 63 cell growth, the in vivo efficacy of these small molecules requires further investigation. Thus, 64 METTL3 is well-established as a viable potential target for cancer therapies, but the lack 65 of available options in clinic suggests an urgent need for further development of effective 66 METTL3-targeting treatment strategies 23. 67 As an alternative to small molecules, peptides offer a versatile and potentially powerful 68 approach for targeted inhibition of proteins, especially through competitive disruption of 69 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by mimicking peptide binding epitopes24, 25, 26, 27. Peptide 70 drugs have been extensively developed for several diseases such as diabetes, and show 71 high potential for clinical application28, 29. Here, in this work, we developed a series of 72 peptide-based inhibitors targeting METTL3 through a rational design strategy with 73 subsequent modification to enhance specific properties. Among the candidates, one 74 peptide targeting a binding site on METTL3 required for complex assembly with METTL14 75 showed the highest potency against a panel of cancer cells, leading to our subsequent 76 engineering of its affinity and stability, especially through Bis(bromomethyl)biphenyl (bph)-77 based stapling. This final peptide inhibitor, RMS3, exhibited high efficacy in inhibiting the 78 growth of multiple cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer (e.g. PC3 and DU145), 79\n\u00b7\nleukemia (e.g. CEM), and lung cancer (e.g. A549). Furthermore, RMS3 could both disrupt 80 METTL3-METTL14 complex formation as well as induce its subsequent proteasomal 81 degradation, globally inhibiting m6A modification in cancer cells. As the first-in-class 82 peptide inhibitor targeting METTL3, RMS3 utilizes a markedly distinct mechanism of action 83 from that of small molecule inhibitors, supported by in vitro and in vivo validation of its 84 cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effects in multiple cancer cell lines and xenograft tumor models. 85 Our study thus provides a promising therapeutic approach to treat a variety of tumor types, 86 particularly prostate cancer, as well as a design strategy for developing new peptide-based 87 drugs for other METTL3-dependent diseases or other therapeutic targets. 88\n97"

            "text": "Peptide inhibitor design and validation 99\nUsing previously reported crystal structure of the METTL3-METTL14 complex18, we 100 identified three distinct domains potentially essential for protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 101 required for complex formation, suggesting their strong potential as targets for peptide-102 based inhibition of METTL3 activity. Following this rationale, the RM1, RM2, and RM3 103 candidate peptides were respectively designed to target the M1 (RNA-binding groove), M2 104 (catalytic core), and M3 (METTL3/14 interface) regions of the complex, and fused each 105\n\u00b7\npeptide to the classic cell-penetrating peptide, R9 (RRRRRRRRR), to enhance cellular 106 penetration (Fig. 1 & Fig.S1) 30, 31. Among the functional regions targeted for interference, 107 RM1 was designed to interact with the methylase catalytic core which binds to the SAM 108 catalytic substrate; RM2 is predicted to disrupt interactions between METTL3-METTLE14 109 and mRNA, incorporating sequence from the RNA-binding grooves; and RM3 was derived 110 from an -helix located at the METTL3-METTL14 interface and intended to destabilize 111 complex formation and block protein function. The detailed molecular mechanism(s) and 112 regulatory network (METTL3/m6A/RRBP1) of METTL3 in promoting cancer progress in 113 prostate cancer is described in a parallel study [FYQ-paper]. Considering that METTL3 is 114 highly upregulated in PCa cells and plays a significant role in cancer development, we 115 assessed the potency of peptide inhibitors using MTT assays with PC3 and DU145 cell 116 lines. As shown in Fig. 2a and 2b, RM1 and RM2 exhibited relatively modest cytotoxicity, 117 while RM3 displayed substantially greater anticancer effects, with IC50 values of 35.4 \u03bcM 118 and 55.3 \u03bcM against PC3 and DU145 cells, respectively. Further evaluation through long-119 term clonogenic assays (Fig. 2c and 2d) confirmed that RM3 exerted stronger inhibitory 120 effects than either RM1 or RM2. These findings supported the further exploration of RM3 121 as a promising candidate anticancer drug warranting further optimization. 122\n129\nPhysicochemical properties and activity of M3 derivatives in vitro 130\nTo enhance the effects of the M3 peptide, we employed peptide stapling, a well-established 131 technique for increasing peptide stability and activity by covalently linking two specific 132 amino acids (e.g. Cysteine)32. In this work, we utilized this strategy to generate the SM3 133\n\u00b7\nand RSM3 stapled peptides from M3 and RM3, respectively (See synthetic routes in Fig 134 S2.). The binding affinity of stapled peptides was evaluated through microscale 135 thermophoresis (MST) assays, which measure interaction strength between peptides and 136 their target protein. Notably, SM3 exhibited high affinity binding to the METTL3-METTL14 137 complex, with a Kd value of 4.25 \u03bcM. In comparison, the non-stapled peptide, M3, displayed 138 markedly lower affinity (Kd = 90.1 \u03bcM). This significant improvement in binding affinity was 139 likely due to the higher stability secondary structure of the stapled peptide (Fig. 3a). 140 Circular dichroism (CD) measurements further verified that SM3 could adopt an -helix 141 conformation in solution, whereas the non-stapled M3 peptide fragment was mainly found 142 in a random coil conformation (Fig. 3b). 143 144 Functional assays demonstrated that SM3 could effectively inhibit METTL3-METTL14 145 complex transferase activity. More specifically, METTL3 methyltransferase activity was 146 decreased by 63% in the presence of SM3, but decreased by 52% upon exposure to M3, 147 further indicating the higher potency of the stapled peptide (Fig. 3c). Stability assays 148 indicated that RSM3 exhibited substantially higher biostability when treated with a 15% 149 fetal bovine serum (FBS) solution, retaining ~41.8% of its initial concentration after 360 min 150 of incubation, while the RM3 linear peptide was completely degraded within 180 min (Fig. 151 3d). This stability could be attributed to the structural integrity conferred by the stapling 152 strategy. In addition, we evaluated possible hemolytic activity by the peptide to assess its 153 potential cytotoxicity towards human blood cells. In primary human blood cells, the peptide 154 inhibitor showed no obvious toxicity at concentrations up to 200 \u03bcM after 24 h of incubation 155 (Fig. 3e). Collectively, these findings highlight the improved binding affinity, biostability, and 156 activity that are inherently linked to a highly stable -helical conformation resulting from 157 peptide stapling. We therefore further explored the development of RSM3 as a promising 158 anti-cancer drug candidate. 159\n\u00b7\nstability of RSM3 and RM3 over time in the presence of 15% FBS. (E) Hemolysis assays with primary 165 human blood cells evaluating the hemolytic potential of R9, RM3 and RSM3. For a,c-e mean and error 166 (\u00b1s.d.) were obtained from at least three replicates. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s 167\ntest correction was used in statistical analysis test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, and not significant 168 by P > 0.05. 169\n170 Evaluation of RSM3 anti-cancer effects 171\nTo evaluate the therapeutic or anti-cancer effects of the RSM3 stapled peptide, its general 172 cytotoxicity was assessed in a panel of ten cancer cell lines. The results showed that both 173 RSM3 and RM3 exhibited broad toxicity towards various cancer cells including PC3, 174 DU145, HeLa, HepG2, HCT116, A549, K562, MDS-L, CCRF-CEM (Fig. S3). It is 175 noteworthy that the IC50 of RSM3 towards the leukemia cell line, CCRF-CEM, was 176 approximately 4.6  1.03 \u03bcM. Following our initial experiments, further investigation of 177 RSM3 activity focused on the prostate cancer models. As expected, the RSM3 stapled 178 peptide displayed higher toxicity, with lower IC50 values, than the non-stapled RM3 peptide 179 (25.8  1.9 \u03bcM vs 55.3  2.4 \u03bcM, RSM3 vs RM3) in the DU145 cell line (Fig.4a). Cell 180 migration (Trans-well) and colony formation assays showed the potent inhibitory effects of 181 RSM3 and RM3 on cancer cell aggressiveness compared to the control peptide R9. 182 Treatment with either RSM3 or RM3 resulted in approximately 2~3 fold less cell migration 183 and a ~20-fold reduction in PC3 or DU145 colony formation (Fig. 4b&c). 184 185 We next investigated the cytotoxic effect of peptide inhibitors. To better understand the 186 impacts on cell proliferation, we employed EdU labeling with confocal laser scanning 187 microscopy (CLSM) to assess the proportion of cancer cells that entered the S phase of 188 the cell cycle. Image analysis indicated that PCa cells in the RSM3 and RM3 treatment 189 groups exhibited significantly weaker EdU signal, ~35.0% and ~47.0% that of the PBS 190 control group (Figure 4d&e), indicating that cell proliferation was markedly reduced in the 191 presence of these peptides. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis revealed that ~29.2% of 192 PC3 cells and 16.9% of DU145 treated with RSM3 were arrested in the sub-G1 phase, 193 compared to ~8.5% and ~3.6% for PC3 and DU145 cells, respectively, in the PBS group 194 (Fig. S4). These findings suggested that RSM3 could effectively induce cell cycle arrest. 195 Subsequently, Annexin V-FITC and TUNEL staining was performed to evaluate apoptosis 196 levels associated with RSM3 or RM3 treatment. TUNEL assays clearly showed that RSM3 197 could induce higher levels of apoptosis than RM3, although apoptosis levels in the RM3 198 treatment group were also significantly higher than in controls (Fig. 4f). Quantification by 199 flow cytometry indicated that 60% of PC3 cells and ~30% of DU145 entered apoptosis in 200 the RSM3 group, compared to 4% and ~5% of PBS-treated PC3 and DU145 cells, 201 respectively (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, a larger proportion of apoptotic cells were in the late 202 stage, accounting for ~90% of the total apoptotic PC3 cells. The proportion of cells with 203 apoptosis induced by RSM3 was approximately 2-fold higher than that of RM3, further 204 supporting the higher toxicity of the stapled peptide towards cancer cells. Western blot 205 assays confirmed that cleaved caspase-3 accumulated in peptide-treated cells (Fig. S5), 206 further validating the apoptotic effect. Collectively, these results illustrated the anticancer 207 activity of METTL3 peptide inhibitor by inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. 208\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nRSM3 interaction with METTL3-METTL14 decrease complex stability and function 218\nTo explore the interactions between the peptide inhibitor and METTL3, we used a FITC-219 labeled fluorescent RM3 to track its intracellular localization (Fig. 5a). CLSM image 220 analysis illustrated the obvious and rapid cellular uptake of RM3, in contrast with the 221 minimal cellular entry observed with the M3 control peptide lacking R9 (Fig. S6). This result 222 could at least partially explain the markedly lower inhibitory effects of M3 and SM3 towards 223 cancer cells compared to that of M3 or even SM3 in combination with the R9 cell 224 penetration peptide. Immunostaining for METTL3 confirmed that fluorescent signal from 225 RSM3 co-localized with that of METTL3 (Fig. 5b), while co-staining for METTL3 and 226 METTL14 revealed that both proteins were obviously localized to the perinuclear region at 227 6 h of RSM3 treatment (Fig. 5c)33. Furthermore, METTL3 and METTL14 signal intensity 228 were both decreased, suggesting that treatment with RSM3 could potentially result in 229 altered function and possible degradation of the METTL3-METTL14 complex. Western blot 230 analysis further confirmed that METTL3 and METTL14 levels were reduced in PC3 cells 231 at 12 h of RSM3 treatment (Fig. 5d), supporting that RSM3 could both inhibit catalytic 232 activity and also trigger degradation of the METTL3-METTL14 complex. 233 Subsequent RNA blot assays with m6A ELISA demonstrated that m6A modifications were 234 significantly reduced in PC3 or DU145 cells treated with RSM3 or RM3, reaching levels 235 approximately ~20% that detected in the R9 and PBS treatment groups (Fig. 5e&f). These 236 results highlighted the potent effects of inhibiting METTL3 methyltransferase activity with 237 stapled M3 peptides. We next investigated the impact of peptide inhibitors on METTL3 238 half-life by pre-treating PC3 cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein synthesis prior 239 to RSM3 or RM3 administration. Western blots showed that RSM3 or RM3 treatment 240 resulted in dramatically reduced half-life for METTL3 (Fig. 5g). Subsequent examination 241 of the RSM3-associated degradation pathway through treatment with autophagy inhibitor 242 (chloroquine, CQ) or proteasome inhibitor (MG132) revealed that exposure to MG132, but 243 not CQ, could reverse the depletion of METTL3 in the RSM3-treated cells. By contrast, 244 treatment with the METTL3 inhibitor, STM2457, had no influence on METTL3 levels in WB 245 analysis. These results indicated that RSM3 treatment could activate METTL3 degradation 246 through the proteasome pathway, different from the inhibitory activity of STM2457 on 247 METTL3 methyltransferase activity. Taken together, these results indicated that 248 interference in METTL3-METTL14 interaction by RSM3 or RM3 could block m6A 249 modification while also inducing the proteasomal clearance of METTL3 in prostate cancer 250 cells, and further suggested that the stapled RSM3 peptide might be an effective candidate 251 drug for cancer therapy. 252\n\u00b7\nf,g mean and error (\u00b1s.d.) were obtained from at least three replicates. One-way analysis of variance 264 (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s test correction was used in statistical analysis test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, 265 ***P < 0.005, and not significant by P > 0.05. Scale bar 10 \u03bcm 266 267\nTranscriptomic response to peptide treatment in prostate cancer cells 268 To further uncover the molecular basis underpinning the effects of RSM3 on cancer cell 269 viability, we next performed bulk RNA-seq in PC3 cells treated with vehicle or 25 \u03bcM RSM3 270 for 12 h (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, we identified only 89 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 271 |FC\u22652| and FDR = 0.05) in the RSM3 vs. control group comparison, indicating a highly 272 specific transcriptomic response to m6A pathway disruption. At a less stringent threshold 273 of FC\u22651.5, 302 DEGs were detected, including 202 upregulated and 100 downregulated 274 (Fig. 6a), which could be reasonably interpreted as a result of blocking m6A function in 275 promoting mRNA decay 34. GO analysis of these 302 DEGs by Metascape implied that the 276 upregulated genes were enriched in pathways involved in programmed cell death, p53 277 tumor suppressor signaling, differentiation, and immunity (Fig. 6b), whereas down-278 regulated genes were mainly enriched in pathways involved in promoting cancer 279 aggressiveness, stemness, and proliferation (Fig. 6c). These findings were generally 280 consistent with our recent study that oncogenic function of the m6A pathway in prostate 281 cancer was associated with features of tumor immune microenvironment (e.g. cytokine 282 signaling)35. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further confirmed the GO results, 283 showing that expression of apoptosis, inflammatory response, and p53 signaling signature 284 genes was enriched in RSM3-treated cancer cells (Fig. 6d). In addition, the androgen 285 receptor (AR) pathway was significantly enriched in AR- PC3 cells after RSM3 treatment 286 (Fig. 6e), indicating that METTL3 inhibition by RSM3 might be accompanied by restoration 287 of aggressive AR- cells to a more indolent AR+ cell state. Real-time qPCR analysis was 288 used to validate the results of RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 6f), which showed upregulation of 289 NF-\u03baB responsive genes related to inflammation and apoptosis and downregulation of 290 genes related to cell cycle and proliferation. In particular, the expression of luminal 291 differentiation genes (i.e., AR, PSA, NKX3.1, CK18) was increased while expression of 292 stemness genes decreased, further supporting the molecular differentiation phenotype 293 associated with RSM3 treatment (Fig. 6f). To verify that the effects of RSM3 treatment 294 were due to inhibition of m6A signaling, we checked for overlap between DEGs detected 295 by this RNA-seq analysis and either human m6A-targeted genes recorded in the 296 M6A2Target database 36 (Fig. 6g) or METTL3-bound proteins (Fig. 6h) identified by RIP-297 seq in our parallel study (FYQ-paper). This analysis showed that DEGs detected in RSM3-298 treated PCa cells were indeed significantly enriched with genes subject to m6A modulation, 299 thus illustrating the on-target effects of METTL3 inhibition by RSM3. Furthermore, we also 300 noted that MAPK signal cascade genes were dramatically overrepresented among the 301 upregulated GO terms in RSM3-treated cells (Fig. 6b), implying that RSM3 may deactivate 302 MAPK activity. Western blot analysis further showed lower phosphorylation levels of 303 p42/44 in the RSM3 group (Fig. 6i), indicating that RSM3 treatment resulted in decreased 304 activity of ERK/MAPK. Collectively, our data supported that METTL3 inhibition by RSM3 305 could retard cancer cell growth and evoked apoptosis via inhibition of MAPK mitotic 306 pathway, together with induction of differentiation, in an m6A-dependent manner. 307\n\u00b7\n324 RSM3 safety and anti-tumor efficacy in vivo 325\nTo assess safety, we examined its acute toxicity in vivo through a single intraperitoneal 326 injection of RSM3 (50 mg/kg) into C57/BL mice. After 24 h, routine blood analysis showed 327 no significant differences in WBC, PLT, or RBC levels between mice injected with RSM3 328\n\u00b7\nand those injected with RM3, R9, or PBS. Although HGB levels were significantly lower in 329 the RSM3 group compared to the PBS control group, HGB values remained within 330 acceptable limits (Fig. 7a). Histopathological examination of major organs, including the 331 heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, from mice treated with the peptide inhibitors, showed 332 no significant abnormalities or lesions in any treatment groups (Fig. S7). These results 333 strongly suggested that the peptide inhibitors conferred no obvious toxicity to mice. 334 We then evaluated the anti-cancer activity of RSM3 in PC3 xenograft tumor model. 335 Tumor-bearing mice were given a single peri-tumoral injection of 100 \u03bcL RM3, RSM3 (20 336 mg/kg), or the R9 or PBS control components, every two days for two weeks. 337 Measurements of tumor size and mouse body weight throughout the 2-week experimental 338 period indicated that RSM3 or RM3 treatment resulted in significant suppression of tumor 339 growth compared to the R9 or PBS control groups (Fig. 7b). More specifically, tumor 340 volumes were 2~3 fold smaller in the RSM3 group compared to controls, with the stapled 341 RSM3 peptide exhibiting higher efficacy than the non-stapled RM3 peptide, suggesting that 342 increased stability through stapling could enhance the peptide inhibitory activity in vivo. 343 Throughout the therapeutic course, the body weights were unaffected in all groups, and 344 histopathological examination of organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) found no 345 significant abnormalities or lesions, indicating that none of the compounds had noticeable 346 toxicity in the tumor-bearing mice (Fig. S8). 347 Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor samples showed that treatment with either 348 RM3 or RSM3 resulted in a ~50% reduction in METTL3 expression and m6A levels 349 compared to the R9 and PBS groups. Additionally, caspase-3 expression increased by 350 ~1.8-fold, while Ki67 decreased by ~65%, indicating that tumor growth was likely 351 suppressed in the RSM3 or RM3 groups via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of 352 proliferation (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, using the ASPC-1 cell line and ASPC-1 xenograft 353 tumor model of pancreatic cancer to evaluate generalizability of peptide inhibitors, we 354 found that RSM3 also exhibited substantial anti-tumor activity towards ASPC-1 cells (Fig. 355 S9, IC50 = 33.8  7.0 \u03bcM) and ASPC-1 xenograft tumors (Fig. S10), with significantly lower 356 tumor volumes, and ~50% lighter tumor weights in the RSM3-treated group compared to 357 the PBS- and R9-treated control groups. We speculated that these observations might be 358 due to a common role of METTL3 in promoting pancreatic cancer development and 359 metastases37. 360 Based on our above findings, we next sought to compare the anti-tumor effects of RSM3 361 with that of the previously reported small molecule inhibitor of METTL3, STM2457 19. Both 362 STM2457 and RSM3 exhibited potent toxicity towards PC3 and DU145 cells (Fig S11), 363 and RSM3 displayed higher toxicity, with lower IC50 values, than the STM2457 in PC3 (26.5 364  1.2 vs 95.5  3.6, RSM3 vs STM2457) and DU145 (33.6  1.5 vs 149.3  10.1, RSM3 vs 365 STM2457) cells. Subsequent RNA blot assays revealed a significant reduction in m6A 366 levels in PC3 cells treated with either RSM3 or STM2457. Notably, RSM3 exhibited a 367 marginally superior m6A inhibition effect compared to STM2457 (Fig. S12). To this end, 368 STM2457 or RSM3 were administered to PC3 xenograft model mice at the same dosage 369 (20 mg/kg), which demonstrated that both STM2457 and RSM3 could effectively suppress 370 tumor growth in PCa tumors in vivo (Fig. S13). However, tumor mass was significantly 371 lower in the RSM3 group compared to STM2457-treated tumors (Fig. S12c), that is, 372\n\u00b7\naverage tumor mass in the RSM3 group was ~37% that in the PBS group, while average 373 tumor mass in the STM2457 group was 70% that of controls. These results demonstrated 374 that peptide inhibitors of METTL3 can effectively suppress prostate and pancreatic tumor 375 development in vivo. Moreover, these findings in xenograft tumor model supporting the 376 potent disruption of METTL3 activity and stability by RSM3 suggest that these peptide 377 inhibitors function through a different and potentially more reliable pathway than small 378 molecule METTL3 inhibitors. 379\n\u00b7\n***P < 0.005, and not significant by P > 0.05. 390\n391 Conclusion 392 Our current study focused on the development of a bhp-linked stapled peptide inhibitor 393 targeting the m6A methyltransferase, METTL3, in cancer cells. Comprehensive 394 physicochemical and functional characterization in multiple cancer cell lines in vitro 395 demonstrated that the RSM3 stapled peptide displayed relatively high affinity towards the 396 METTL3 binding site for complex formation with METTL14, reasonably high stability in 397 denaturing conditions compared to other candidates, and significant cytotoxicity and anti-398 tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Notably, RSM3 binding with METTL3 not only disrupted 399 its activity, but also activated its proteasomal degradation, resulting in substantially reduced 400 mRNA m6A global methylation levels, in vitro and in vivo. In treatments of two different 401 prostate cancer cell lines, RSM3 exhibited potent inhibition of cell proliferation and 402 migration, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent. Transcriptomic analysis indicated 403 that RSM3 could trigger inflammatory response pathways, activating p53 signaling, 404 ultimately inducing cell cycle arrest and ultimately programmed cell death via apoptosis. 405 We also validated that RSM3 deactivates MAPK signaling. In PC3 Xenograft Model mice, 406 treatment with RSM3 twice a day of 20mg/kg could reduce METTL3 expression and 407 promote apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment in vivo, thus providing compelling 408 evidence if its efficacy. Furthermore, RSM3 could provide significantly higher cytotoxicity 409 and anti-tumor activity towards prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro compared to the small 410 molecule METTL3 inhibitor, STM2457, potentially due to differences in the mechanism of 411 action. The combined properties of high METTL3 inactivation and prolonged stability in the 412 tumor cells collectively support the potential for broad application and generalizability of 413 RSM3 in treating a range of METTL3-dependent cancers 15. In addition, the innovative 414 design strategy for RSM3 provides a theoretical framework for developing future research 415 tools and targeted therapies, including other diseases linked to dysregulation of m6A 416 methylation, with broader implications for targeting other complexes with oncogenic 417 function in future therapeutic development. 418 419 Funding Sources 420 This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21975068 421 to J.S. and 81972418 to D.Z.), the National Youth Talent Support Program (202309460011), 422 Natural Science Foundation of Hunan (2020RC3017 and 2022JJ10008 to J.S., 423 2021JJ10028 to D.Z.), Shenzhen Science and Technology Program 424 (JCYJ20210324122403010 to J.S., JCYJ20220530160410024 to D.Z.). 425 426 Data Availability 427 The RNA-seq data have been deposited in GEO database under accession code 428 GSE241315 and GSE240668. 429 430 Notes 431 J.S, D.Z, Y.F, M.W, and H.H are inventors on pending patent applications (No. 432 202211104956.7, and 202211105358.1), the authors declare no other competing financial 433\n\u00b7\ninterest. 434 435 ACKNOWLEDGMENT 436 We would like to thank the Analytical Instrumentation Center of Hunan University for 437 Assistance in Confocal Microscopy. 438 439 REFERENCES 440 1.

Following treatment with the 15 \u03bcM peptide or inhibitor for the appropriate duration,\nthe treated cells were lysed using 1x passive buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors\nsuch as PMSF and a phosphatase cocktail. The concentration of total protein in the lysates\nwas determined using Quick Start Bradford 1x Dye Reagent, and the protein concentration\nwas calculated accordingly. Subsequently, the protein samples were denatured by heating\nthem at 95-100\u00b0C for 5 minutes and subjected to the Western blotting assay."
