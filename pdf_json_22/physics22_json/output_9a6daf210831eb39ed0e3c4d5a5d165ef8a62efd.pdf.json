    "abstractText": "Nanostructures, such a quantum dots or nanoparticles, made of three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTIs) have been recently attracting increasing interest, especially for their optical properties. In this paper we calculate the energy spectrum, the surface states and the dipole matrix elements for optical transitions with in-plane polarization of 3DTI nanocylinders of finite height L and radius R. We first derive an effective 2D Hamiltonian by exploiting the cylindrical symmetry of the problem. We develop two approaches: the first one is an exact numerical tight-binding model obtained by discretising the Hamiltonian. The second one, which allows us to obtain analytical results, is an approximated model based on a large-R expansion and on an effective boundary condition to account for the finite height of the nanocylinder. We find that the agreement between the two models, as far as eigenenergies and eigenfunctions are concerned, is excellent for the lowest absolute value of the longitudinal component of the angular momentum. Finally, we derive analytical expressions for the dipole matrix elements by first considering the lateral surface alone and the bases alone, and then for the whole nanocylinder. In particular, we focus on the two limiting cases of tall and squat nanocylinders. The latter case is compared with the numerical results finding a good agreement.",

            "text": "Nanostructures, such a quantum dots or nanoparticles, made of three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTIs) have been recently attracting increasing interest, especially for their optical properties. In this paper we calculate the energy spectrum, the surface states and the dipole matrix elements for optical transitions with in-plane polarization of 3DTI nanocylinders of finite height L and radius R. We first derive an effective 2D Hamiltonian by exploiting the cylindrical symmetry of the problem. We develop two approaches: the first one is an exact numerical tight-binding model obtained by discretising the Hamiltonian. The second one, which allows us to obtain analytical results, is an approximated model based on a large-R expansion and on an effective boundary condition to account for the finite height of the nanocylinder. We find that the agreement between the two models, as far as eigenenergies and eigenfunctions are concerned, is excellent for the lowest absolute value of the longitudinal component of the angular momentum. Finally, we derive analytical expressions for the dipole matrix elements by first considering the lateral surface alone and the bases alone, and then for the whole nanocylinder. In particular, we focus on the two limiting cases of tall and squat nanocylinders. The latter case is compared with the numerical results finding a good agreement.\nCopyright M. Governale and F.

            "text": "Over the last years the interest in topological order in condensed matter systems has exploded: many different classes of topological materials have been discovered and many possible experimental implementations have been proposed. Relevant examples are three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTIs) [1] which are materials having an insulating bulk, while exhibiting electronic conducting surface states that are protected against perturbations that do not break time-reversal symmetry (see reviews in Refs. [2\u20135]). Low-energy excitations, within the bulk band gap, consists of two-dimensional Dirac fermions.\nIn the form of nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs), 3DTIs have been recently predicted to exhibit interesting optical properties [6\u201311], especially in the THz range. Possible applications include optoelectronic devices to produce THz radiation in the so-called THz gap [12,13], and optically controlled quantum elements for quantum computing [14]. An interesting optical effect, based on an electron-mediated phonon-light coupling in the THz range, has been recently measured in Bi2Se3 in Ref. [15].\nThe topological properties of nanoparticles, in particular related to quantum confinement, were theoretically investigated for various shapes [16\u201318] including disks [19] and nanospheres [7]. The fabrication, the electrical and optical measurements of such 3DTI nanoparticles or QDs have been reported by several groups over the last decade [20\u201332]. Interestingly, Bi2Se3 3DTI nanoparticles also find applications in the bio-medical field, for example for the protection they provide against ionizing radiation based on their superior antioxidant activities and electrocatalytic properties [33], or for cancer therapy techniques (see Ref. [34] for a review).\nNanowires too have attracted considerable attention both theoretically and experimentally [35\u201354], also for the interesting quantum-confinement effects due to a finite cross section [55\u2013 58]. In particular, in Refs. [55, 56] the properties of a finite-radius 3DTI infinite cylinder were theoretically explored. In Ref. [55], an approximate analytic model supplemented by a numerical scheme was introduced to study the quantum interference effects on the low-energy spectrum of Bi2Se3 nanowires. In Ref. [56], the envelope-function description of the TI bulk band structure developed in Refs. [59,60] was used to determine the dependence of its energy spectrum and eigenfuctions on the radius R. An approximate expression for the eigenenergies was obtained in the limit of large radii, up to second order in 1/R. The analytical functional\nform of the eigenfunctions, which is valid irrespective of the radius of the wire, was used to calculate the dipole matrix elements for optical transitions. The case of a nanocylinder with a finite height was considered in Ref. [61] aiming at studying the spin and parity structure of the eigenstates. In particular, an approximate surface Dirac-fermion approach was used to determine analytically the energy spectrum.\nIn this paper we investigate finite-height 3DTI nanocylinders with the aim to single out the effects related to the finiteness of the height L on the electronic energy spectrum, the wavefunctions of surface state and the optical absorption properties. Regarding the latter, in particular, two important mechanisms affecting the optical absorption of a finite cylinder are neglected in the infinite-height limit. First, the finite height changes the energies of the surface states and therefore the frequencies of the absorption lines. Second, the wavefunction on the sides of the cylinder is affected by the finite height and moreover contributions from the bases also need to be accounted for. The fact that the wavefunction is different in the case of finiteheight cylinders implies that the dipole matrix elements, which determine the strength of the absorption, are different than the one computed in the infinite-height limit. We are further motivated by experiments which are currently under progress [62], where the absorption of THz radiation is measured in cylindrical QDs of various sizes.\nFrom a more general point of view, a very interesting issue related to the finiteness of the height L is the theoretical problem of finding the correct quantisation condition for the longitudinal momentum entering the wavefunction of the lateral side surface of the cylinder. Indeed, the side surface state of the cylinder, when it approaches the top/bottom bases, bends and merges with the surface states on the bases and hard-wall boundary conditions cannot be imposed.\nDepending on the values of L and R, we consider nanocylinders whose geometry ranges from the one of a squat QD (when L \u226a R) to the one of a tall nanorod (when L \u226b R). We will make use of two models. Both of them are based on an effective two-dimensional (2D) Hamiltonian obtained leveraging the cylindrical symmetry of the problem. More precisely, a set of independent 2D problems are obtained for each value of the quantum number j, which is the eigenvalue of the projection along the longitudinal direction z of the electronic total angular momentum. The first model exactly describes a finite-height cylinder: it is a numerical tightbinding model where the lattice spacings for the two spatial coordinates are allowed to take different values. The second is an approximated analytical model that describes the surface states of the lateral side of the nanocylinder (in the large radius limit) by accounting for the presence of the two bases through an effective boundary condition. The latter provides the quantization rule for the momentum along z through which we get approximated expressions for the eigenenergies of a nanocylinder and for the wavefunction of its lateral surface. We stress that the quantization condition we obtain differs from the one derived in Ref. [61], where a Dirac-fermion (surface) theory was employed, instead of the full (bulk) Hamiltonian of the lateral side of the cylinder we use here.\nTo check the quality of such approximated model we have compared its results with the ones obtained with the exact numerical model. As far as eigenenergies are concerned, the agreement is excellent for j = \u00b11/2 and in general yields the correct dependence on the radius R of the cylinder. The wavefunction of the lateral surface is also well reproduced by the analytical model at least not too close to the top and bottom bases. In particular, we have calculated numerically the probability density for the four different components of the spinor wavefunction, emphasizing peculiar behaviours such as the fact that the probability density on the two bases is small in the region around their centres.\nFinally, the approximated model has been used to derive analytical expressions for the dipole matrix elements for optical transitions with in-plane polarization. We calculate the contribution from the lateral side alone and from the bases alone, which allows us to derive\nthe matrix elements in the limits of a tall rod and of a squat QD, respectively. In the latter case, we have checked the validity of the analytical expression using the numerical exact model, finding a good agreement at least for the transitions at the lowest energy.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we specify the low-energy Hamiltonian of a class of 3DTI materials taking into account the cylindrical symmetry, and derive the effective 2D problem. In section 3 we show the derivation of the two models for a nanocylinder: the analytical model for the side of the cylinder, its bases and the effective boundary condition in the first three sub-sections, while the numerical approach is detailed in the forth sub-section. The results for the two models (eigenenergies, wavefunctions and optical transitions) are shown and discussed in section 4."

The label P1(2)z indicates that they are relative to the atomic pz orbitals of the two different atoms in the material, the superscript \u00b1 refers to their parity, while \u2191 (\u2193) is the spin. The mass coefficients m0, m1 and m2, as well as the coefficients A and B of the linear-momentum terms depend on the material. For example, for Bi2Se3 we have m0 = \u22120.169 eV, m1 = 3.353 eV\u00c52, m2 = 29.375 eV\u00c52, A = 2.513 eV\u00c5, and B = 1.836 eV\u00c5 [63].

The effective 2D problem corresponds to confinement in a two-dimensional box.\nAs discussed in Sec. 3.4, for each value of j, the full surface state for arbitrary values of R and L can be numerically calculated by discretising the Hamiltonian (7) on a finite grid thus obtaining a 2D-tight binding model. Analytically, however, the full surface state can be obtained through an approximate method, based on a multiple-scattering argument, that matches the surface states on the side of the cylinder with those on the two bases (see Sec. 3.3). To do so, we first we need to find the surface states for the side and the bases.\n3.1 Side: Large-R expansion\nWe start with the side of the cylinder and we perform a large-R expansion following a different approach with respect to the one of Ref. [56, 64]. We consider the effective 2D Hamiltonian (7) and write it as\nHeff, j = H0 +H1, j , (10)\nwhere H0 describes in-plane (transverse section) motion in leading order in 1/R\nH0 =\n\n  \nm0 \u2212m2\u2202 2r 0 0 \u2212iA\u2202r 0 \u2212\nm0 \u2212m2\u2202 2r \u2212iA\u2202r 0 0 \u2212iA\u2202r m0 \u2212m2\u2202 2r 0\n\u2212iA\u2202r\u2212 0 0 \u2212 m0 \u2212m2\u2202 2r\n\n   , (11)\nand H1, j contains corrections due to finite-R and pz\nH1, j =\n\n  \n\u2212m1\u2202 2z + Vc,\u2212 \u2212iB\u2202z 0 \u2212iA j r\n\u2212iB\u2202z m1\u2202 2z \u2212 Vc,\u2212 \u2212iA j r 0\n0 iA jr \u2212m1\u2202 2 z + Vc,+ iB\u2202z\niA jr 0 iB\u2202z m1\u2202 2 z \u2212 Vc,+\n\n   . (12)\nWe start by calculating the eigenfunctions of H0 that correspond to the surface states. We assume that the radial dependence of the wave function of the effective 2D model is of the form e\u03bb(r\u2212R), since we expect the surface states to be exponentially localised at the surface r = R. The corresponding eigenenergy is E = 0. As detailed in App. A, we find that the eigenfunctions of (11) which fulfil the boundary conditions at r = R are\n\u03a61,kz , j(r, z) = 1 p\n2\n\n  1 0 0 i\n\n  eikzz p\nL \u03c1(r) , (13)\n\u03a62,kz , j(r, z) = 1 p\n2\n\n  0 1 \u2212i 0\n\n  eikzz p\nL \u03c1(r) , (14)\nwhere the radial part of the wavefunction is defined as\n\u03c1(r) = 1\nNsur\ne\u03bb+(r\u2212R) \u2212 e\u03bb\u2212(r\u2212R) , (15)\nwith Nsur being a normalisation factor and\n\u03bb\u00b1 = A\u00b1 p A2 + 4m0m2 2m2 . (16)\nThe perturbation Hamiltonian H1, j in the space spanned by |\u03a61,kz , j\u232a and |\u03a62,kz , j\u232a can be written as\nH1, j . =\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n(Bkz)2 + j2 A2\nR2 1\u2212 1 2 A m0R\n2\ncos(\u03b8 ) sin (\u03b8 ) sin(\u03b8 ) \u2212 cos(\u03b8 ) , (17)\nwith\ncos(\u03b8 ) =\nA R \u2212 A2 2m0 1 R2\nj \u00c8\n(Bkz)2 + j2 A2 R2 1\u2212 12 A m0R\n2 , (18)\nand\nsin(\u03b8 ) = Bkz\n\u00c8\n(Bkz)2 + j2 A2 R2 1\u2212 12 A m0R\n2 . (19)\nNote that matrix elements between different values of j are zero, because of the cylindrical symmetry of the problem. Similarly kz is also a good quantum number due to translational symmetry along z. More details of this calculation are provided in App. B.\nThe eigenergies are given by\nE\u00b1,kz , j = \u00b1\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n(Bkz)2 + j2 A2\nR2 1\u2212 1 2 A m0R\n2\n. (20)\nWe emphasise that for kz = 0, Eq. (20) reproduces the result, obtained by a completely different route, of Eq. (18) in Ref. [56]. The eigenkets corresponding to the eigenenergies E\u00b1,kz , j are\n|\u03a6+,kz , j\u232a= cos(\u03b8/2)|\u03a61,kz , j\u232a+ sin(\u03b8/2)|\u03a62,kz , j\u232a , (21a) |\u03a6\u2212,kz , j\u232a= \u2212 sin(\u03b8/2)|\u03a61,kz , j\u232a+ cos(\u03b8/2)|\u03a62,kz , j\u232a . (21b)\nIn order to be consistent with the phase of the states, we take \u03b8 \u2208 [0,2\u03c0]. Finally, we note that the eigenfunctions (3) for the surface states of the original 3D problem, Eq.

            "text": "In this section we present our approximated method to obtain the eigenergies of the nanocylinders and an approximation for the wavefunction on the side surface of the cylinder. The energy for the surface state of the side of the cylinder is given by\nE\u00b1,kz , j = \u00b1\n\u221a \u221a\n(Bkz)2 + j2 A2\nR2 , (26)\nwhere here we neglect higher order 1/R corrections [see Eq. (20)]. Now, the issue with this expression is that it is not clear how to quantise the longitudinal wavevector kz . An obvious choice is to use periodic boundary conditions, which would yield kz = n2\u03c0/L. This type of boundary conditions corresponds to the cylinder being closed in a doughnut (torus) which is clearly a very different geometry than the nanocylinder. Another possibility would be to try to impose hard-wall boundary conditions at z = 0 and z = L. This turns out to be impossible as a consequence of the fact that the surface state extends over the entire surface of the nanocylinder. This means that the side state of the cylinder when it approaches the top/bottom bases bends and merges with the surface states on the bases. The solution to this problem that we pursue here is to take into account of the bases as an effective boundary condition for the surface states on the cylinder. For energies E > 0, we assume that the state |\u03a8+,kz , j\u232a, in Eq. (22), gets scattered into the state |\u03a8+,\u2212kz , j\u232a when it reaches the top surface, and picks up a phase exp(ik\u22252R) from the propagation across the top surface and an additional negative sign for j < 0, due to the angular momentum. Similarly, the state |\u03a8+,\u2212kz , j\u232a gets reflected at the bottom surface into |\u03a8+,kz , j\u232a with the same scattering phase exp(ik\u22252R)sign( j). While so far we have considered the case E > 0, the very same argument can be carried out for E < 0 by changing all the state kets into |\u03a8\u2212,\u00b1kz , j\u232a. We now require that the state remains the same after a full orbit (two scattering events one at the top surface and one at the bottom one) and this yields the quantisation condition:\n2Lkz + 4Rk\u2225 = n\u03032\u03c0 , (27)\nwhere n\u0303 is an integer and kz > 0. As we will see below, this latter condition yields the smaller integer value, n\u0303min, j , that n\u0303 can take for a given value of j. The energy dispersions for the top and bottom surfaces are E\u00b1 = \u00b1Ak\u2225, while for the side surface are given in Eq. (26). Since both the side state and the bases state correspond to the same energy we have\nk\u2225 =\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\nB A kz\n2\n+ j R\n2\n. (28)\nFinally the quantisation condition for kz reads\nkz + \u03b3\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\nk2z + 2 j \u03b3L\n2\n= n\u0303 \u03c0\nL , (29)\nwhere we have defined the parameter \u03b3 = 2BRAL which is proportional to the aspect ratio 2R/L and the asymmetry B/A of the coupling constants.\nSolving the equation above for kz and taking the positive solution yields\nkz(n\u0303, j) = \u2212n\u0303\u03c0L + \u00c8 \u03b32 n\u0303\u03c0L 2 \u2212 2 j L 2 (\u03b32 \u2212 1)\n\u03b32 \u2212 1 , (30)\nwhere\nn\u0303\u2265 Ceiling[2| j|/\u03c0]\u2261 n\u0303min, j , (31)\nand we have explicitly indicated that kz depends on n\u0303 and j. We now define the quantum number n such that n\u0303= n+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1. After this substitution the smallest positive value of kz is obtained for n= 1. The quantised values for kz read\nkz(n, j) = \u2212(n+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1)\n\u03c0 L + \u00c8 \u03b32 (n+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1) \u03c0 L 2 \u2212 2 j L 2 (\u03b32 \u2212 1)\n\u03b32 \u2212 1 , (32)\nwith n = 1,2, . . . This is one of the central results of this paper and a few comments are in order. First we note that the quantised values of kz depend on the angular-momentum quantum number j. Second, if we consider tall cylinders, that is \u03b3\u2192 0, we get\nkz(n, j)\u2248 (n+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1) \u03c0 L \u2212 2 | j| L ,\nwhich shows a linear dependence on the angular-momentum quantum number j. Thirdly, if n\u226b | j|, we obtain for the quantised wavevectors kz \u2248 (n+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1) \u03c0 (1+\u03b3)L , which resembles the results for a particle in a box. We are now in a position to write the quantised energies for the surface state of the entire nanocylinder simply by plugging in the quantised values for kz in Eq. (26). We also change notation and we label the negative energies with negative values of n. In the new notation, the eigenenergies are\nEn, j = sign(n) B L\n\u221a \u221a\nkz(|n|, j)2 L2 + 1 \u03b32 (2 j)2 , (33)\nwhere kz(|n|, j) is given by Eq. (32). This is another key result of this paper and it is worth examining some limiting cases. In the tall-cylinder case, \u03b3\u226a 1, the eigenenergies read\nEn, j = sign(n) A| j| R 1+ \u03b32 2 (|n|+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1)\u03c0 2| j| \u2212 1 2 . (34)\nIn the limit of large-quantum number |n|, that is |n| \u226b | j|, we get\nEn, j \u2248 sign(n)B (|n|+ n\u0303min, j \u2212 1)\u03c0\n(\u03b3+ 1)L , (35)\nwhich shows a linear dispersion in the quantised kz as expected for gapless Dirac\u2019s cone excitations. The eigenenergies determine the position of the absorption lines when we consider absorption of electro-magnetic radiation by the nanocylinders. In the next section we will benchmark the quality of the result in Eq. (33) against the full numerics.\nFinally, we approximate the states on the side-surface of the nanocylinder as\n\u03a8n, j(r,\u03c6, z)\u2248 e\u2212ikz L p\n2 \u03a8\u00b1,kz , j(r,\u03c6, z) + sign( j)e\nik\u22252R e ikz L\np 2 \u03a8\u00b1,\u2212kz , j(r,\u03c6, z) , (36)\nwhere the upper(lower) sign is for n> 0(n< 0), k\u2225 = k\u2225(|n|, j) = E|n|, j\nA and kz = kz(|n|, j). The knowledge of the states allows for the calculation of expectation values of observables.\nWe conclude by noting that the quantisation condition (32) differs from the standard quantisation condition kz = n\u03c0 L ."

The indices p and q run as follows: p = 1, ..., Nr and q = 1, ..., Nz , with Nr (Nz) being the number of sites in the r (z) direction.

            "text": "In Fig. 1, we show the quantised energy levels (with n = 1, 2,3) of the full surface states as functions of the radius R, for fixed L = 10R0, and for different values of j in the different panels [ j = 1/2 in panel (a), j = 3/2 in panel (b), j = 5/2 in panel (c), and j = 7/2 in panel (d)]. The results of the exact numerical approach are represented by filled circles, while the\nresults of the approximated analytical model are represented by solid lines. We notice that the analytical model agrees exceptionally well with the numerical calculation for the lowest value of j, panel (a). For j = 3/2 and 5/2, panels (b) and (c), the approximated model still captures the overall behaviour of the energy spectrum, but its accuracy degrades. Interestingly, the accuracy of the model improves again for j = 7/2. Moreover, as expected, the analytical model performs better for larger values of R as it is based on a large-R approximation.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the dependence on the height L of the eigenenergies of the full surface states, in analogy to what was done in Fig. 1. We notice that the dependence on L is much weaker than the dependence on the radius R. Also in Fig. 2, the analytical calculation is particularly accurate for j = 1/2 (apart from the case L = 2.5R0, which however corresponds to a very squat cylindrical QD), with the accuracy becoming worst for j = 3/2. It is noteworthy that such a simple model does so well in describing the topological states of a finite-size cylinder of TI.\nLet us now consider the eigenfunctions \u03a6n, j(r, z), introduced in sec. 3.4, and define the probability density as \u03c1n, j(r, z) = \u03a6 \u2020 n, j(r, z)\u03a6n, j(r, z). In Fig. 3 we plot \u03c1n, j(r, z), scaled so that its maximum value is 1, with n = 1 and j = 1/2 (this corresponds to the state having the lowest positive value of the energy) for a nanocylinder with radius R = 30R0 and height L = 10R0. As expected, the surface state extends over the entire surface of the nanocylinder. The density vanishes for r = R, for z = 0 and for z = L, as required by the hard-wall boundary condition. Interestingly, the density on the two bases appears to be small in the region around\ntheir centres (r = 0). In Fig. 4 we plot the cuts along the dashed lines indicated in the density plot in Fig. 3, emphasising the contribution of each component of the eigenfunction (see Sec. 2.1). More precisely, we use the notation \u03c1(i)n, j(r, z), with i = 1, ..., 4, to denote the four different components of the overall probability density. Panel (a) shows the probability density as a function of r along the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 3, which corresponds to a value of z close to the peak near the top surface, whose expression is z = zu = L\u2212R0/4. Notice that the components 1 and 2 are nearly equal and are non-zero everywhere on the top base, while decreasing to zero approaching its centre (r = 0). The components 3 and 4 are also nearly equal, but are negligibly small over a large portion of the top base around its centre, roughly up to r = R/2. The overall probability density increases steadily with the radial coordinate from zero at r = 0 and then drops back to zero at r = R. Panel (b) shows the probability density as a function of z at r = r\u0304 = R \u2212 R0 1 2 + m2 A2 |m0|\n, which corresponds to the vertical dashed line in Fig. 3 that is located approximatively at the position of the density peak on the side of the cylinder (away from the bases). Here, components 1 and 4, as well as components 2 and 3, are nearly equal apart from the boundary regions. Interestingly, \u03c1(2)n, j and \u03c1 (3) n, j are vanishing over almost the whole height of the cylinder. The total probability density exhibits two peaks very close to z = 0 and z = L and it is constant in between.\nWe conclude the section by showing the quality of the predictions provided by the analytical model by comparing the wavefunctions obtained with it to the ones calculated by means of the tight-binding model. We consider a 3DTI nanocylinder with R = 30R0 and L = 10R0 and we choose the quantum numbers n = 1 and j = 1/2. The numerical results are obtained by means of the numerical tight-binding model with discretisation constants ar = 0.25R0 and az = 0.05R0. In Fig. 5 the real (black) and imaginary (blue) parts of the wavefunctions ui (with i = 1, ..., 4), defined in Eq. (3), are plotted as functions of z. We have fixed r = r\u0304, i.e. z is running along the vertical dashed line in Fig. 3. The four panels are relative to the four different components of the wavefunction. Solid lines are obtained with the analytical model, while filled circles are calculated with the numerical model. On the one hand, the imaginary parts in (a) and (c), and the real parts in (b) and (d), show an excellent agreement away from the bases located at z = 0 and z = L, i.e., when z is far from the bases by a few units of R0. In fact, very close to such points the numerical exact results present peaks which are not captured by the analytical model. This is due to the fact that the approximated analytical model takes\ninto account the top and bottom bases only by means of an effective boundary condition for the side-surface states and not by actually matching wavefunctions. On the other hand, in panels (a) and (c) the real part is zero, while in panels (b) and (d) is the imaginary part which vanishes: the two models agree on that, i.e. on the relative phases between the different components of the wavefunction. In conclusion, the wavefunctions obtained analytically are a very good approximation of the exact wavefunctions as long as we are a few units of R0 away from the bases."

            "heading": "4.2 Dipole matrix elements",
            "text": "Optical spectroscopy provides a useful tool to study the electronic structure in semiconducting low-dimensional systems. Optical transitions are mediated by the matrix elements of the electric-dipole operator d which determine the amplitudes of absorption. In the case of transitions between surface states of topological-insulator cylinders of realistic radii the frequencies of the absorption lines are in the THz range. We refer to Ref. [56] for the derivation of the operator d. Here we use the wavefunctions calculated in the previous sections to evaluate the dipole matrix elements for optical transitions with in-plane polarisation of 3DTI nanocylinders. As a starting point we derive the analytical expressions of the matrix elements accounting for the side surface only, and for the bases only. Using the approximated model we then obtain the analytical expression for the matrix elements of a finite-size nanocylinder. From these results we can address the limiting cases of a tall nanorod (\u03b3 \u226a 1) and of a squat cylindrical QD (\u03b3\u226b 1). We can do that by using the quantisation rule for kz , Eq. (32), obtained by imposing\nthe boundary condition in Sec. 3.3. The numerical model is finally used for calculating the matrix elements of a squat cylindrical QD, finding a good agreement with the analytical result at least for the lowest transition energies.\nWe start considering the lateral side surface states alone of a nanocylinder of height L. The dipole matrix elements, which determine the radiation absorption amplitude, for circular polarisation between the states given in Eqs. (22) can be calculated easily and are given by\n\u2329\u03a8+,k\u2032z , j\u2032 |dx \u00b1 idy |\u03a8\u2212,kz , j\u232a\neR0 = \u03b4 j\u2032, j\u00b11 Fk\u2032z ,kz (L) sin \u03b8 j\u00b11,k\u2032z \u2212 \u03b8 j,kz 2\nR R0 + s\u2212 m2 AR0 , (37)\nwhere s = sign(A/m0) = \u22121 in the topological state and Fk\u2032z ,kz (L) = 1 L \u222b L 0 dz exp[i(kz \u2212 k \u2032 z)z]. The mixing angles \u03b8 j,kz are given by Eqs. (18) and (19). For a very large value of L this expression approximates the matrix elements for the case of an infinite 3DTI nanowire. As an example, we look at the transition |\u03a8\u2212,kz ,\u22121/2\u232a \u2192 |\u03a8+,kz ,1/2\u232a. For the smallest value allowed for kz , this transition happens at the lowest frequency for which we have absorption. It is also the one with the largest probability. The matrix element for this transition reads\n\u2329\u03a8+,kz , 12 |dx + idy |\u03a8\u2212,kz ,\u2212 12 \u232a\neR0 = \u2212sign(kz) A 2R 1 E+,1/2,kz R R0 \u2212 1\u2212 m2 AR0 , (38)\nwhere we have taken s = \u22121 and we have taken the mixing angles without the 1/R2 corrections.\nWe now look at the dipole matrix elements between the surface states of the top/bottom bases given by Eqs. (24). In the calculation of the matrix elements we integrate over the area of a disk of radius R. In particular we compute the matrix element for dx \u00b1 idy between the states with j = \u00b11/2 and opposite energies and we find\n\u2329\u03a8Top,+,k\u2225,\u00b11/2|dx \u00b1 idy |\u03a8Top,\u2212,k\u2225,\u22131/2\u232a\neR0 =\nR/R0\nk\u2225R J0(k\u2225R)\nJ1(k\u2225R)\n2 + k\u2225R\u2212 J0(k\u2225R) J1(k\u2225R)\n. (39)\nLet us now consider a 3DTI nanocylinder with radius R and height L. Using the approximate analytical state of Eq. (36) we can calculate (see App. D) the dipole matrix element only\nin the limit where the contribution of the bases are negligible, that is for the case of a tall nanorod \u03b3\u226a 1. In this limit and in zeroth order in \u03b3, we consider the absorption matrix element for dx + idy for circular polarisation for the transition |\u03a8\u2212n,\u22121/2\u232a \u2192 |\u03a8n,1/2\u232a. For kz > 0, we find the following expression\n\u2329\u03a8n,1/2|dx + idy |\u03a8\u2212n,\u22121/2\u232a eR0 = \u2212 R R0 \u2212 1\u2212 m2 AR0\n1+ sin(1) |n|\u03c0\u2212 1 ,\nwhere n> 0. On the other hand, the matrix elements for the case of a squat nanocylinder is given by Eq. (39), which only accounts for the wavefunctions of the bases, and taking for k\u2225 the value resulting from the boundary condition (27). We test this result by comparing it with the outcome obtained from the exact numerical model. In Fig. 6, we plot the absolute value of the matrix element of dx + idy , calculated using both models, as a function of the radius R for L = 5R0. The data are relative to the transitions between the states |\u03a8\u2212n,\u22121/2\u232a and |\u03a8n,1/2\u232a for three values of n. Filled circles refer to the numerical model and solid lines to the analytical one. The comparison shows an excellent agreement for n = 1, which corresponds to the lowest energy transitions, for all values of R. This means that the contribution of the side surface states are unimportant. For the case n = 2 (n = 3), however, the analytical model overestimates (underestimates) the actual result, although the predicted slope is correct. The\nnumerical curves show that the magnitude of the matrix elements are monotonically increasing with R, for all values of n considered, and decreases as n increases.\nFor the case of a tall nanorod we could not calculate numerically the matrix elements because for large values of L the tight-binding method becomes impractical in terms of both required computational time and memory.\nFinally, we show an example of absorption spectrum that can be obtained straightforwardly from the dipole matrix elements. We consider the case of circularly polarised light and we employ the tight-binding model for the nanocylinder to evaluate the matrix elements of dx + idy . We assume the low-temperature limit and the Fermi energy to be in the middle of the gap so that all the levels with energy less than zero (n< 0) are occupied and those with energy larger than zero (n> 0) are empty. In Fig. 7 we show the spectrum for a nanocylinder of radius 20R0 and L = 10R0. The different transitions have been modelled by Gaussian curves with standard deviation 10\u22123|m0|. The broadening can be due to the fact that often measurements are performed on an array of nanocylinders with slightly different radii. The energy scale |m0| for Bi2Se3 corresponds to a frequency of \u2248 40.9 THz and R0 \u2248 1.49 nm. The dominant peak is associated to the transition (n = \u22121, j = \u22121/2) \u2192 (n = 1, j = 1/2). As expected, this peak shifts to lower frequencies for wires of larger radii."

            "text": "We follow Ref. [65] in order to obtain the surface states of the top and bottom bases of the nanocylinder, but using polar coordinates to emphasize that the states are eigenstates of Jz due to the cylindrical symmetry. We assume that L is large enough so that the effect of the hybridisation between the states localised at the top base and the bottom base is negligible. Therefore, we consider the two bases as independent. In the following, we will focus on the states localised around the top base, at z = L. We work with the original 3D Hamiltonian (1) and we choose for the eigenstate of the top base the following Ansatz in polar coordinates\n\u03a8Top(r,\u03c6, z) = e \u0393 (z\u2212L) e\ni j\u03c6\np 2\u03c0\n\n    \nc1J j\u2212 12 (k\u2225r)e \u2212i \u03c62 c2J j\u2212 12 (k\u2225r)e \u2212i \u03c62\nc3J j+ 12 (k\u2225r)e i \u03c62 c4J j+ 12 (k\u2225r)e i \u03c62\n\n     , (50)\nwhere Jn(z) is a Bessel function of the first kind and k\u2225, \u0393 and c1, c2, c3, c4 are numerical coefficients to be determined. Notice that we cannot make a large-r expansion as the wave function is finite on the entire top surface of the cylinder and therefore also for small values of the radial coordinate.\nSubstituting the Ansatz in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the Hamiltonian (1) we obtain the following relation between \u0393 , k\u2225 and the energy\nk2\u2225 \u2212 m1 m2 \u0393 2 + m0 m2\n2 + A2\nm22 k2\u2225 \u2212\nB2 m22 \u0393 2 \u2212 E2 m22 = 0 . (51)\nSolving for \u0393 yields the two solutions with positive real part:\n\u0393\u00b1(E) =\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a B2\n2m21 + m0 m1 + m2 m1 k2\u2225 \u00b1\n\u221a \u221a \u221a B4\n4m41 + B2 m0 m31 + E2 m21 + m2B2 m31 \u2212 A2 m21 k2\u2225 . (52)\nThere are four solutions for (c1, c2, c3, c4), two for each \u0393 = \u0393\u00b1:\ni Ak\u2225 B\u0393\u00b1\n, 0,\u2212i, m0 +m2k2\u2225 \u2212m1\u0393 2 \u00b1 \u2212 E\nB\u0393\u00b1\nT\n, (53)\ni, m0 +m2k2\u2225 \u2212m1\u0393 2 \u00b1 \u2212 E\nB\u0393\u00b1 ,\u2212i Ak\u2225 B\u0393\u00b1 , 0\nT\n. (54)\nThe general solution for the wavefunction is a linear combination of the four independent solutions above. By imposing to that general solution the boundary condition \u03a8Top(r,\u03c6, L) = 0 we find the eigenenergies\nE\u00b1 = \u00b1Ak\u2225 , (55)\nwith k\u2225 \u2265 0. The eigenfunctions corresponding to the energies E\u00b1 = \u00b1Ak\u2225 are\n\u03a8Top,+(r,\u03c6, z) = ei j\u03c6 p\n2\u03c0\n\n    \n\u2212iJ j\u2212 12 (k\u2225r)e \u2212i \u03c62\nJ j\u2212 12 (k\u2225r)e \u2212i \u03c62 iJ j+ 12 (k\u2225r)e i \u03c62\nJ j+ 12 (k\u2225r)e i \u03c62\n\n     1 Nbase, j e\u03b3+(z\u2212L) \u2212 e\u03b3\u2212(z\u2212L) , (56a)\n\u03a8Top,\u2212(r,\u03c6, z) = ei j\u03c6 p\n2\u03c0\n\n    \niJ j\u2212 12 (k\u2225r)e \u2212i \u03c62\n\u2212J j\u2212 12 (k\u2225r)e \u2212i \u03c62\niJ j+ 12 (k\u2225r)e i \u03c62 J j+ 12 (k\u2225r)e i \u03c62\n\n     1 Nbase, j e\u03b3+(z\u2212L) \u2212 e\u03b3\u2212(z\u2212L) , (56b)\nwhere Nbase, j is a normalisation constant which depends on j and k\u2225, but not on the sign of the energy in Eq. (55), and \u03b3\u00b1 = \u0393\u00b1(E = Ak\u2225). Finally, we note the states of the top surface, Eqs. (56), can be also written in Cartesian coordinates as [65]\n\u03a8Top,+,k\u2225(r\u2225, z) = 1 2\n\n  \nie\u2212i \u03b1 2\n\u2212e\u2212i \u03b1 2\n\u2212ei \u03b1 2\niei \u03b1 2\n\n  \neik\u2225\u00b7r\u2225 p\n2\u03c0\n1 N e\u03b3+(z\u2212L) \u2212 e\u03b3\u2212(z\u2212L) , (57a)\n\u03a8Top,\u2212,k\u2225(r\u2225, z) = 1 2\n\n  \n\u2212ie\u2212i \u03b1 2\ne\u2212i \u03b1 2 \u2212ei \u03b1 2\niei \u03b1 2\n\n  \neik\u2225\u00b7r\u2225 p\n2\u03c0\n1 N e\u03b3+(z\u2212L) \u2212 e\u03b3\u2212(z\u2212L) , (57b)\nwhere N is a normalisation constant, k\u2225 = k\u2225(cos(\u03b1), sin(\u03b1)) and r\u2225 = (x , y). The states in Eqs. (57) agree with Ref. [65]."
