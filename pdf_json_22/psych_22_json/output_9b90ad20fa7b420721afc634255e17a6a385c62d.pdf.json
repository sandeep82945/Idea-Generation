In the current study, we asked 175 participants (49.5% women; Mage = 36.32, SD = 12.22) to imagine receiving either a negative or positive message from 22 senders (e.g., friend; bank manager) and to indicate, for each case, how much would they like to receive an emoji and how useful and appropriate they considered the use of emoji. These ratings were combined into a single index of emoji use adequacy. Based on factor analysis, the 22 scenarios were aggregated in distant and close scenarios. Overall, results showed that participants considered emoji use more inadequate in distant (vs. close) scenarios and negative (vs. positive) messages. These findings suggest that the perceived benefits of emoji use for text-based communication may not be generalized to all text-based communication contexts, such that relationship proximity and message valence should not be overlooked. Implications for the fields of consumer psychology and communication are discussed.",

In the latter case, communication lacks non-verbal cues (e.g., tone of voice) that are critical to message interpretation. Including emoji can help express emotion and reinforce or clarify the meaning of a message. However, the benefits of using emoji are likely to depend on the context (e.g., the relationship between interlocutors) and the messages\u2019 features (e.g., the valence of the message). To date, studies have not systematically and empirically examined how the use of emoji is perceived across different communication scenarios. In the current study, we asked 175 participants (49.5% women; Mage = 36.32, SD = 12.22) to imagine receiving either a negative or positive message from 22 senders (e.g., friend; bank manager) and to indicate, for each case, how much would they like to receive an emoji and how useful and appropriate they considered the use of emoji. These ratings were combined into a single index of emoji use adequacy. Based on factor analysis, the 22 scenarios were aggregated in distant and close scenarios. Overall, results showed that participants considered emoji use more inadequate in distant (vs. close) scenarios and negative (vs. positive) messages. These findings suggest that the perceived benefits of emoji use for text-based communication may not be generalized to all text-based communication contexts, such that relationship proximity and message valence should not be overlooked. Implications for the fields of consumer psychology and communication are discussed.\nKeywords: computer-mediated communication, emoji, user perception, context, textbased communication, digital communication.\nIntroduction\nComputer-Mediated Communication (CMC) allows asynchronous and fast\ncommunication, being a valuable tool to contact family, friends, work colleagues, but also service providers and brands1. Users often include emoji in CMC2. Emoji include pictorial representations of different categories, including facial expressions3, and may help in adding an emotional tone to text-based communication, soften the seriousness of messages, decrease their negativity, reduce discourse ambiguity, and strengthen senders\u2019 intent2,4,5. For example, research has shown that users include emoji to convey sarcasm, humor, and flirt with partners6.\nEmoji use may not always be perceived as appropriate for all communicative\nsituations (e.g., sending a \u201ckissing-face\u201d emoji in a message to a co-worker7). Valence, particularly, has been suggested as a potential moderator of emoji effects8,9. For example, participants reading a positive review of a hotel with (vs. without) emoji reported more positive attitudes towards the hotel, whereas the reverse was observed for a negative review10.\nMoreover, the same emoji can positively impact messages addressing moderate\nconflicts while producing adverse effects for more severe conflicts9. These differences arguably occur because emoji are perceived as fun and less serious11, and therefore inadequate to be used in more serious contexts. Indeed, people tend to use positive emoji more frequently12, especially when communicating positive information13. Previous research also suggests that emoji are more frequently used with friends and romantic partners6, which may mimic societal norms of emotional expression14. However, emoji can be used beyond close social circles.\nFor instance, researchers15,16 have argued that the communication between\nhealthcare professionals and patients can be facilitated by using emoji. Research in\neducational settings showed that students evaluate an instructor as more caring but less competent when the instructor uses emoji17. Likewise, research18 found that using emoji in work-related emails was seen as inappropriate, and senders were perceived as less competent. This goes in line with research suggesting that emoji use may be inappropriate in professional communication5,7 and perceived as unprofessional19. Brands also often rely on informal language (e.g., emoji) when communicating with consumers20 to foster customer loyalty21. Previous research22 showed that emoji use can positively affect consumers' perceptions of the brand, increase buying intention, and promote the experience of positive affect in consumers. Notably, other studies23 also show that emoji use by brands may be inappropriate in some communication contexts.\nIn summary, the research presents mixed findings regarding emoji use across\ndifferent communication contexts. To our knowledge, researchers have overlooked how varying contextual cues (e.g., the relationship between interlocutors) and messages\u2019 features (e.g., valence) impact the perceived adequacy of using emoji. An exception is a work by V\u00f6lkel et al. 24, who tested emoji use in different scenarios (varying in valence, situation, and interlocutor). However, this study focused on the senders\u2019 perspective and not on how a receiver perceives emoji as adequate or not in a given scenario.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to systematically examine the\nperceived adequacy of emoji use across a comprehensive set of communication scenarios. These scenarios vary according to sender (e.g., receiving emoji from friends to share news) and valence (e.g., receiving emoji from friends sharing [good vs. bad] news). Because emoji are typically perceived as fun and informal11, their use may be deemed more adequate with close interlocutors. Lastly, previous studies have shown relevant individual differences in emoji use (e.g., women and younger people use emoji\nmore often11,25), shaping how people perceive and react to emoji. Hence, we will control for these variables in our analyses.\nMethod"

Participants were then randomly assigned to one of the valence conditions (positive vs. negative messages) and presented with the 22 scenarios in random order. Specifically, each participant was presented with either negative (e.g., a health professional [e.g., a doctor] communicating an unfavorable diagnosis) or positive messages (e.g., a health professional [e.g., a doctor] communicating a favorable diagnosis). After each scenario, participants were asked to indicate how much they would like to receive an emoji in that scenario (1 = Dislike to 7 = Like), how appropriate was the use of emoji in that scenario (1 = Not appropriate at all to 7 = Very appropriate), and how useful was the inclusion of an emoji in that scenario (1 = Useless to 7 = Useful). These variables were averaged into a single score of emoji use adequacy (\u03b1 = .92), with higher scores indicating perceptions of greater adequacy of emoji use.\nAfter evaluating the 22 scenarios, participants were asked to indicate how\nfrequently they use emoji in their daily text-based interactions (1 = Rarely to 7 = Frequently).

            "text": "Discussion\nThis experimental study tested the effect of the type of scenario (distant or close)\nand the valence of the messages (negative vs. positive) on the perceived adequacy of emoji use. Results showed that emoji use was considered more adequate when communicating positive information and/or with closer interlocutors (e.g., friends vs. work supervisor). Noteworthy, participants rated emoji use in all distant scenarios as inadequate. Our findings align with past research showing that using emoji may be seen as more adequate in some situations than others (e.g., close interpersonal vs. professional settings5,7,18). This may be one of the reasons why people use emoji more frequently with their close ones (e.g., friends6). Moreover, similarly to other studies8,9, we found that the valence of a message determines how people evaluate the adequacy of emoji use. For example, Rodrigues et al.9, also found that emoji use was perceived less favorably for communication outcomes in negative (vs. positive) messages, particularly when addressing more (vs. less) severe conflicts. Our study did not account for within-\nvalence differences (e.g., messages about \u201ccanceling a vacation\u201d may not be as negative as messages sharing the news about a \u201cdivorce.\u201d), and future studies should seek to assess whether the intensity of different positive and negative scenarios modulates emoji use evaluations.\nThe scenarios used in our study included two relevant cues: valence and sender.\nStill, overall, the situation description was quite abstract (e.g., \u201csharing good/bad news\u201d), and messages did not include actual emoji. Therefore, we did not control for the way participants construed each specific situation (e.g., expectations of emoji use according to sender8) nor the emoji they envisioned, which raises concerns for the generalizability of our findings. For example, identifying a specific emoji may be important as they vary in several characteristics, namely valence, familiarity, and even attributed meaning3. Even controlling for this, emoji may interact with other contextual cues. For instance, the \u201csmiling face\u201d and \u201cred heart\u201d emoji are both highly positive and familiar but using the latter in communication with co-workers may be perceived as inappropriate7. Future experimental studies could use more ecological scenarios (e.g., simulated text messages9) to extend our current findings and further explore whether participants would include emoji in their CMC with different interlocutors24. Besides closeness, patterns in CMC may depend on other features of the relationship between interlocutors (e.g., communicating with a professor/supervisor may be more frequent than communicating with other distant interlocutors such as a bank account manager). Therefore, future studies should also assess the frequency or likelihood of contact with each sender. Moreover, in line with previous studies11, women and younger participants reported using emoji more often. However, frequency of using emoji, age, and gender did not moderate the evaluation of emoji use in the set of scenarios presented,\nsuggesting these individual differences may be secondary when contextual cues are available.\nThis study is one of the first to systematically evaluate how emoji use is\nperceived across communication scenarios. Our main contribution is the demonstration that contextual cues related to the valence of the message and the relationship between interlocutors influence how individuals perceive the adequacy of emoji use. Moreover, by providing a scenario-level analysis, we also contribute to the field, allowing researchers to select specific scenarios in which emoji use is deemed more/less adequate. Our findings can also have practical implications by helping professionals in different fields (e.g., marketing, health communication, education) to efficiently integrate emoji in their communication strategies26. For example, receivers may be more open to emoji use whenever the content of the message is positive. However, in negative messages, we recommend restricting emoji use to communication between closer interlocutors (e.g., a professor could only include an emoji in an email sharing low grades after building rapport with students)."
