    "abstractText": "The rare decay process of the Higgs boson into a pair of J=\u03a8 and \u03a5 particles is studied within the perturbative Standard Model and the relativistic quark model. The relativistic corrections connected with the relative motion of quarks are calculated in the production amplitude and the wave functions of the bound states. Numerical values of the decay widths of the Higgs boson are obtained, which can be used for comparison with experimental data.",

INTRODUCTION\nSince the discovery of the Higgs boson [1,2], a period of detailed study of the various processes connected with this particle has begun. We can say that the study of the Higgs sector has become one of the most important areas in particle physics [3]. The discovery of the Higgs boson confirmed the electroweak mechanism of symmetry breaking, but the nature of this particle remains to be explored. To do this, it is necessary to create particle colliders, on which Higgs bosons could be produced in significant quantities, which would make it possible to proceed to a precise study of the parameters of the Higgs sector. It is possible that interaction processes involving the Higgs boson can provide a transition to a new physics that lies beyond the Standard Model. Among the parameters of the Higgs sector, the coupling constants of the Higgs boson with various bosons [g\u00f0HZZ\u00de, g\u00f0HWW\u00de], leptons [g\u00f0H\u03c4\u03c4\u00de, g\u00f0H\u03bc\u03bc\u00de], and quarks [g\u00f0Hcc\u00de, g\u00f0Hbb\u00de], stand out. They determine the decay processes of the Higgs boson into various particles [4]. Due to the Higgs boson large mass and the presence of coupling constants with different particles, the Higgs boson has numerous decay channels. The decay channel of the Higgs boson into a pair of heavy quarks is interesting because it creates the possibility of the production of bound states of heavy quarks. Thus, rare exclusive decay processes of the Higgs boson into a pair of charmonium or bottomonium are of obvious interest both for studying the decay mechanisms and for studying the properties of bound\nstates of quarks. Here it is useful to recall that the study of charmonium pair production in electron-positron annihilation played an important role in its time in explaining the mechanism of such a reaction, as well as in understanding the role of various effects in calculating the observed paired production cross sections [5,6]. The CMS Collaboration began the search for rare Higgs decays into a pair of heavy vector quarkonia in 2019 [7]. The results of new upper limits on the branching fractions were obtained in [8],\nB\u00f0H \u2192 J=\u03a8; J=\u03a8\u00de < 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22124; \u00f01\u00de\nB\u00f0H \u2192 \u03d2\u00f01S\u00de;\u03d2\u00f01S\u00de\u00de < 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123: \u00f02\u00de\nTheoretical studies of the production of a pair of heavy quarkonia in the decays of the Higgs boson began about 40 years ago in [9,10]. In these papers, theoretical formulas were obtained for estimating the decay widths in the nonrelativistic approximation for some decay mechanisms; more recent theoretical studies of these processes were carried out in [11\u201314]. In this work we continue the study of relativistic effects in the exclusive paired charmonium and bottomonium production in the Higgs boson decay which began in [12,13] for Bc mesons. Our calculation of the decay widths is performed on the basis of relativistic-quark model used previously for the investigation of relativistic corrections in different reactions in [15\u201317], including pair production of mesons and baryons in electron-positron annihilation and proton-proton interaction. Despite the rare nature of the Higgs boson decays being studied, one can hope that such processes can be investigated at the new Higgs boson factories. The purpose of this paper is to perform a new analysis of the vector quarkonium pair production processes in Higgs boson decays in the Standard Model and to Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In comparison with previous works [11,14] we have performed a more detailed consideration of various mechanisms (quark-gluon, quark-photon, photon-photon and Z-bosonic mechanisms) of charmonium and bottonium pair production. Additionally, in our calculation, we take into account the relativistic corrections connected with the relative motion of heavy quarks, both in the quark-antiquark production amplitude itself and in the wave functions of bound states. As a result, new numerical estimations for the Higgs boson decay rates are obtained. An experimental study of these rare exclusive decays of the Higgs boson at future high-luminosity colliders could be useful in testing the Standard Model with higher accuracy."

            "text": "From the very beginning, it should be emphasized that there are several groups of amplitudes for the decay of the Higgs boson with the formation of a pair of charmoniums J=\u03a8 (bottomonium \u03d2), which contribute the same order of magnitude to the decay width. We study the amplitudes which are shown in Figs. 1\u20135. They represent different decay mechanisms with pair vector meson production; quark-gluon, quark-photon, quark-loop, W-boson loop, and Z-boson. The first group includes quark-gluon amplitudes shown in Fig. 1 (quark-gluon mechanism). The factor determining the order of contributions can be represented as \u03b1s=M4H, whereMH is the mass of the Higgs boson. Such a factor can be distinguished from the very beginning due to the structure of the interaction vertices and the denominators of the particle propagators. The second group is formed by quark-photon amplitudes shown in Fig. 2 (quark-photon mechanism). The order of contribution is determined here by the factor \u03b1=M2HM 2 QQ\u0304. The third group is formed by the amplitudes in Figs. 3 and 4 which contain the quark or W-boson loop with two photons that create a pair of J=\u03a8 (or \u03d2) mesons (quark-loop and W-boson loop mechanisms). The primary common factor in this case\ntakes the form \u03b12=M4QQ\u0304. Finally, the last group of amplitudes in Fig. 5 is determined by the interaction of the Higgs boson with a pair of Z-bosons (Z-boson mechanism). To achieve good calculation accuracy, it is necessary to take into account the contribution of all amplitudes from these groups. Let us consider firstly the Higgs boson decay amplitudes shown in Figs. 1 and 2. For pair production of quarkonia in the leading order of perturbation theory, it is necessary to obtain two free quarks and two free antiquarks at the first stage. Then they can form bound states with some probability at the next stage. In the quasipotential approach the decay amplitude can be presented as a convolution of a perturbative production amplitude of two c-quark and c\u0304-antiquark pairs and the quasipotential wave functions of the final mesons [12,13],\nM\u00f0P;Q\u00de \u00bc \u2212i\u00f0 ffiffiffi 2 p GF\u00de12 2\u03c0\n3 MQQ\u0304\nZ dp \u00f02\u03c0\u00de3 Z dq \u00f02\u03c0\u00de3\n\u00d7 Trf\u03a8V\u00f0p; P\u00de\u0393\u03bd1\u00f0p; q; P;Q\u00de\u03a8V\u00f0q;Q\u00de\u03b3\u03bd \u00fe\u03a8V\u00f0q;Q\u00de\u0393\u03bd2\u00f0p; q; P;Q\u00de\u03a8V\u00f0p;P\u00de\u03b3\u03bdg; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere MQQ\u0304 is the mass of quarkonium.

Expressions (5) and (6) represent complicated functions depending on relative momenta p, q including the bound state wave function in the rest frame \u03a80\u00f0p\u00de. The color part of the meson wave function in the amplitudes (5)\u2013(6) is taken as \u03b4ij= ffiffiffi 3 p (color indexes i, j, k \u00bc 1, 2, 3).\nThe general structure of expressions (5)\u2013(6) allows us to say that they are the product of the wave functions of mesons in the rest frame and special projection operators\nresulting from the transformation from the moving reference frame to the reference frame in which the meson is at rest. Expressions (5)\u2013(6) make it possible to correctly take into account the relativistic corrections connected with the relative momenta of quarks in the final states. It is useful to note that the expression for the projection operators was obtained in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics in [18] in a slightly different form for the case when the quark momenta lie on the mass shell. The transformation law of the bound state wave functions of quarks, which is used in the derivation of equations (5)\u2013(6), was obtained in the Bethe-Salpeter approach in [19] and in quasipotential method in [20]. As follows from (5)\u2013(6), when constructing the decay amplitudes of the Higgs boson, projection operators are introduced for quark-antiquark pairs onto the spin states with total spin S \u00bc 1 of the following form:\n\u03a0\u0302V \u00bc \u00bdv2\u00f00\u00deu\u03041\u00f00\u00de S\u00bc1 \u00bc \u03b5\u0302 1\u00fe \u03b30 2 ffiffiffi 2 p : \u00f07\u00de\nTotal amplitude of the Higgs boson decay to paired vector quarkonium in the case of quark-gluon mechanism in the leading order in strong coupling constant \u03b1s can be presented in the form,\nM \u00bc 4\u03c0 3 MQQ\u0304\u03b1s\u0393Q\nZ dp \u00f02\u03c0\u00de3 Z dq \u00f02\u03c0\u00de3 TrfT 12 \u00fe T 34g;\n\u00f08\u00de\nT 12 \u00bc \u03a8V\u00f0p; P\u00de p\u03021 \u2212 r\u0302\u00fem \u00f0r \u2212 p1\u00de2 \u2212m2 \u03b3\u03bc \u00fe \u03b3\u03bc r\u0302 \u2212 q\u03021 \u00fem \u00f0r \u2212 q1\u00de2 \u2212m2\n\u00d7D\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0k2\u00de\u03a8V\u00f0q;Q\u00de\u03b3\u03bd; \u00f09\u00de\nT 34 \u00bc \u03a8V\u00f0q;Q\u00de p\u03022 \u2212 r\u0302\u00fem \u00f0r \u2212 p2\u00de2 \u2212m2 \u03b3\u03bc \u00fe \u03b3\u03bc r\u0302 \u2212 q\u03022 \u00fem \u00f0r \u2212 q2\u00de2 \u2212m2\n\u00d7D\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0k1\u00de\u03a8V\u00f0p; P\u00de\u03b3\u03bd; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere \u03b1s \u00bc \u03b1s\u00f0M 2 H 4\u039b2\u00de, \u0393Q \u00bc m\u00f0 ffiffiffi 2 p GF\u00de12.\n056002-4\nThe four-momentum of the Higgs boson squared is r2 \u00bc M2H \u00bc \u00f0P\u00feQ\u00de2 \u00bc 2M2QQ\u0304 \u00fe 2PQ.

At the same time, we keep in the amplitudes (9) and (10) the second-order correction for small ratios jpj=m, jqj=m relative to the leading-order result. Calculating the trace in obtained expression in the package FORM [21], we find relativistic amplitudes of the paired meson production in the form:\nMVV \u00f01\u00de \u00bc 256\u03c0\n3M4H \u00f0\nffiffiffi 2 p GF\u00de12mMQQ\u0304\u03b1s\u03b5\u03bb1\u03b5\u03c32F\u03bb\u03c31;VV j\u03a8\u0303V\u00f00\u00dej2;\n\u00f013\u00de\nwhere \u03b5\u03bb1, \u03b5 \u03c3 2 are the polarization vectors of spin-1 mesons. The superscript in amplitude designation and subscript in tensor function F\u03bb\u03c31;VV designation denotes the contribution of the quark-gluon mechanism in Fig. 1. An explicit expression for the function F\u03bb\u03c31;VV is presented in Eq. (19). The contribution of the amplitudes in Fig. 2MVV \u00f02\u00de to the total decay amplitude must also be taken into account, because these amplitudes have the same order as the previous ones, despite the replacement \u03b1s \u2192 \u03b1. This is due to the presence in the denominator of the mass of the meson instead of the mass of the Higgs boson [22]. The expression for the production amplitudes of the pair J=\u03a8 (\u03d2) has a similar structure with slight changes in the common factors,\nMVV \u00f02\u00de \u00bc 288\u03c0\nM2HMQQ\u0304 \u00f0\nffiffiffi 2 p GF\u00de12me2Q\u03b1\u03b5\u03bb1\u03b5\u03c32F\u03bb\u03c32;VV j\u03a8\u0303V\u00f00\u00dej2;\n\u00f014\u00de\nwhere the function F\u03bb\u03c32;VV has the same general form as the function F\u03bb\u03c31;VV [see (19)].

The structure functionsAQ;W\u00f0t\u00de,BQ;W\u00f0t\u00de can be obtained using an explicit expression for a loop integrals (see Appendixes A and B). The amplitudes in Figs. 3\u20135 with quark,W-boson loops, and ZZ in an intermediate state contain the contributions of direct (left) and crossed (right) diagrams. The direct diagrams, in which virtual photons or Z-bosons give vector quarkonia in the final state, are dominant in terms of the mass factor. However, the structure of the numerators of the direct and cross amplitudes is different, which can eventually lead to numerically close contributions.

            "text": "General expression for the decay rate (25) contains numerous parameters. One part of the parameters, such as quarkmasses or themasses of mesons, are determined within the framework of quark models as a result of calculating the\nobserved quantities. The parameters of quark models are found from the condition of the best agreement with experimental data [4]. Another part of the relativistic parameters\u03c9n can also be found in the quarkmodel as a result of calculating integrals with wave functions of quark bound states in the momentum representation. Thus, we can say that the approach to calculation based on the relativistic quark model is closed, because it allows to calculate all the necessary parameters without resorting to additional hypotheses. To calculate \u03c9n, we assume that the dynamics of quarkantiquark pairs is determined by the QCD generalization of the standard Breit-Hamiltonian in the center-of-mass reference frame [23\u201329],\n056002-6\nH \u00bc H0 \u00fe \u0394U1 \u00fe \u0394U2; H0 \u00bc 2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi p2 \u00fem2 q \u2212 2m \u2212\nCF\u03b1\u0303s r \u00fe Ar\u00fe B; \u00f027\u00de\n\u0394U1\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc \u2212 CF\u03b12s 4\u03c0r \u00bd2\u03b20 ln\u00f0\u03bcr\u00de \u00fe a1 \u00fe 2\u03b3E\u03b20 ; a1 \u00bc 31 3 \u2212 10 9 nf; \u03b20 \u00bc 11 \u2212 2 3 nf; \u00f028\u00de\n\u0394U2\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc \u2212 CF\u03b1s 2m2r p2 \u00fe r\u00f0rp\u00dep r2 \u00fe \u03c0CF\u03b1s m2 \u03b4\u00f0r\u00de \u00fe 3CF\u03b1s 2m2r3 \u00f0SL\u00de\n\u2212 CF\u03b1s 2m2 S2 r3 \u2212 3 \u00f0Sr\u00de2 r5 \u2212 4\u03c0 3 \u00f02S2 \u2212 3\u00de\u03b4\u00f0r\u00de \u2212 CACF\u03b12s 2mr2 ; \u00f029\u00de\nwhereL \u00bc \u00bdr \u00d7 p , S \u00bc S1 \u00fe S2, nf is the number of flavors, CA \u00bc 3 and CF \u00bc 4=3 are the color factors of the SU(3) color group, \u03b3E \u2248 0.577216 is the Euler constant. To describe the hyperfine structure of the energy spectrum, the following confinement potential is usually added to (27) [30\u201332]:\n\u0394Vhfsconf\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc fV A 2m2r 1\u00fe 8 3 S1S2 \u00fe 3A 2m2r LS\u00fe A 3m2r 3 r2 \u00f0S1r\u00de\u00f0S2r\u00de \u2212 S1S2\n\u2212 \u00f01 \u2212 fV\u00de A 2m2r LS; \u00f030\u00de\nwhere we take the parameter fV \u00bc 0.7 for optimal agreement with the experiment. For the dependence of the QCD coupling constant \u03b1\u0303s\u00f0\u03bc2\u00de on the renormalization point \u03bc2 we use the three-loop result [33]. The typical momentum transfer scale in a quarkonium is of the order of the quark mass, so we set the renormalization scale \u03bc \u00bc m and \u039b \u00bc 0.168 GeV. The parameters of the linear confinement potential A \u00bc 0.18 GeV2 and B \u00bc \u22120.16 GeV have the usual values of quark models. Using this Hamiltonian, we construct an effective model of the interaction of quarks in a bound state of the Schr\u00f6dinger type [23,24,34\u201336]. The numerical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, taking into account various corrections in the potential, makes it possible to find the wave function of the bound state, with the help of which the relativistic parameters themselves are then calculated.\nThe amplitudes of the pair production of vector charmonium and bottomonium in the decay of the Higgs boson are expressed in terms of function FVV , that is presented in the form of an expansion in jpj=m, jqj=m up to terms of the second order. As a result of algebraic transformations, it turns out to be convenient to express relativistic corrections in terms of relativistic factors Cn \u00bc \u00f0\u03b5\u00f0p\u00de \u2212m\u00den=\u00f0\u03b5\u00f0p\u00de \u00fem\u00den. As a result of integrating these relativistic factors with the obtained wave functions, we find the values of the relativistic parameters \u03c9n themselves.

It allows one to take relativistic effects into account when calculating the wave functions of pseudoscalar and vector mesons (S-states) [25,27,29,32,34,37,38]. The exact form of the bound state wave functions \u03a80\u00f0q\u00de is important to obtain more reliable predictions for the decay widths. In the nonrelativistic approximation the Higgs boson decay width with a production of a pair of quarkonium contains the fourth power of the nonrelativistic wave function at the origin for S-states. The value of the decay width is very sensitive to small changes of R\u0303\u00f00\u00de. In the nonrelativistic QCD there exists the corresponding problem of determining the magnitude of the color-singlet matrix elements [39]. As a result of the performed transformations, the relativistic parameters are determined by convergent momentum integrals. Their calculation was performed many times for different bound states of quarks in our works [13,15,16]. The numerical values of the parameters \u03c91, \u03c92 are presented in the Table I. The parameter \u03c92 is not included in the decay width, because corrections of the\norder O\u00f0q4\u00de, O\u00f0p4\u00de connected with it, are omitted. Using our approach, it is possible to calculate relativistic corrections not only of the second, but also of a higher order. The results of numerical calculations of the decay widths and parameters AQ, AW , BQ, and BW are presented in Tables II\u2013IV. Comparing the contributions of different meson pair production mechanisms, it is important to emphasize that their relative magnitude in the total result is determined by such important parameters as \u03b1 and \u03b1s and the particle mass ratio. So, for example, in the case of the production of a pair of vector mesons, the decay amplitude has two contributions from the quark-gluon (Fig. 1) and quark-photon (Fig. 2) diagrams. On the one hand, the contribution of photon amplitudes is proportional to \u03b1, which leads to its decrease in comparison with the contribution from quark-gluon amplitudes. But on the other hand, the quark-photon contribution contains an additional factor e2Qr 2 1, which leads to an increase in the decay widths."

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "The study of rare exclusive decay processes of the Higgs boson is an important task, which makes it possible to refine the values of the interaction parameters of particles in the Higgs sector. In this paper, we have attempted to present a complete study of decay processes H \u2192 J=\u03a8J=\u03a8, H \u2192 \u03d2\u03d2 in the Standard Model by considering the various decay mechanisms shown in Figs. 1\u20135. To improve the\ncalculation accuracy, we take into account relativistic corrections, which were not previously considered in [11,14]. The numerical contribution of different decay mechanisms is analyzed and it is shown that in the case of double production of charmonium, the main decay mechanism is the quark-photon one in Fig. 2, ZZ-mechanism in Fig. 5. However, it is also necessary to take into account other mechanisms to achieve high calculation accuracy (see also [22]). For bottomonium pair production all mechanisms give close contributions to the width, but the ZZmechanism is dominant. Their sum ultimately determines the full numerical result. The parameters AW , AQ, BW , and BQ, which determine the numerical values of the contributions of theW-boson loop mechanism and the quark loop mechanism, are obtained in analytical and numerical form. They are presented separately in Table III. In our approach, we distinguish two types of relativistic corrections. The corrections of the first type are determined by the relative momenta p and q in the production amplitude of two quarks and two antiquarks. The corrections of the second type are determined by the transformation law of the meson wave functions, which results in expressions (5)\u2013(6). The \u03a80\u00f0p\u00de wave functions entering into (5)\u2013(6) in the rest frame of the bound state are found from the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a potential that includes relativistic corrections. Having an exact expression for the decay amplitude (see the example in Appendix C), we carry out a series of transformations with it, extracting second-order corrections in p and q. The model used is described in more detail in [13]. In our approach, all arising relativistic parameters\u03c91, \u03c92, R\u0303\u00f00\u00de are determined within the framework of the relativistic quark model (see Table I). Accounting for relativistic corrections in this work shows that such contributions lead to a significant change in nonrelativistic results. Here it must be emphasized that we call nonrelativistic results such results that are obtained at p \u00bc 0, q \u00bc 0 and neglecting relativistic corrections in the quark interaction potential. The main parameter that greatly reduces the nonrelativistic results is R\u0303\u00f00\u00de, which enters in the decay width to the fourth power. Therefore, the difference between the relativistic and nonrelativistic results in Table II turns out to be more significant in the case of pair production of charmonium. The paper considers various mechanisms for the production of a pair of vector mesons in the decay of the Higgs boson, which are presented in Figs. 1\u20135. The decay branchings are equal: Br\u00f0H \u2192 J=\u03a8J=\u03a8\u00de \u00bc 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210, Br\u00f0H \u2192 \u03d2\u03d2\u00de \u00bc 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221210. There are other amplitudes for the production of a pair of J=\u03a8, \u03d2 mesons, which are calculated but not included in detail in the work. So, for example, there is a pair production mechanism (HH mechanism), when the original Higgs boson turns into a HH pair, which then gives a pair of vector mesons in the final state. In a sense, it is similar to the ZZ mechanism, but\nthe amplitude structure is different, which results to a contribution to the decay width that is several orders of magnitude smaller than those given in Table I. Despite the obvious difference in the amplitudes in Figs. 1 and 2 in terms of the mass factorM2=M2h, we include the amplitudes of Fig. 1 in the consideration, in contrast to work [14]. We do not consider amplitudes like those shown in Fig. 3, but with two gluons. In this case, the direct amplitude [Fig. 3 (left)] vanishes due to the color factor, and the cross amplitude [Fig. 3 (right)] is suppressed by the mass factor M2=M2h. A distinctive feature of our calculations is that when studying the contributions of the amplitudes in Figs. 3\u20134, we take into account two structure functions Ai and Bi (i \u00bc W, Q) (15) in the tensor function of the triangular loop. They are calculated analytically and numerically, and the corresponding results are presented in Table IV and Appendixes A and B. Although the function Bi initially contains higher powers of the factor r4 (see Appendixes A and B), which should lead to a decrease in the numerical values for r4 \u226a 1, nevertheless, the structure of the coefficient functions in (25) is such that the function Bi cannot be neglected. In Table IV, we present separately the numerical values of the contributions from different decay mechanisms with an accuracy of two significant figures after the decimal point. First of all, the problem was to obtain the main contribution to the decay width. This was the contribution from the quark-photon mechanism in Fig. 2 and the ZZ mechanism in Fig. 5, which are one order of magnitude greater than the other contributions in the case of charmonium production. Its value is due to the structure of the decay amplitudes, in which small denominators 1=M2 appear from the photon propagators in contrast to other amplitudes in which there is a factor 1=M2H. In addition, the numerator in these amplitudes contains amplifying factors in powers of a large parameter r1. In each considered decay mechanism, there are radiative corrections O\u00f0\u03b1s\u00de that were not taken into account. They represent a major source of theoretical uncertainty, which we estimate to be about 30% in \u03b1s. Other available errors connected with the parameters of the Standard Model and higher-order relativistic corrections do not exceed 10%. On the whole, our complete numerical estimates of the decay widths agree in order of magnitude with the results [14]. The obtained values for the decay width of the Higgs boson into a pair of charmoniums or bottomonions allow us to give a numerical estimate of the possible number of such events in future Higgs boson factories. The parameters of future colliders (ILC, FFC, etc.) are still under discussion [40,41]. In the case of pp-colliders at high luminosities, the production of 4 \u00d7 1010 Higgs bosons per year is possible. Then, taking into account the value of the total Higgs boson decay width, we can expect about 10 Higgs boson decays into charmonium pair per year.\n056002-9"

But there is a unitary gauge convenient for calculation, in which there is only the contribution of the diagrams presented in Fig. 4. The tensor corresponding to triangle loop can be written as follows:\nT\u03bc\u03bd1;W \u00bc 8\u03c0\u03b1MZMW\u00f0 ffiffiffi 2 p GF\u00de1=2 cos \u03b8W Z d4k \u00f02\u03c0\u00de4 V\u03bc\u03c3\u03c1\u00f0r \u2212 k; P;Q \u2212 k\u00deV\u03bd\u03c9\u03bb\u00f0Q \u2212 k;Q;\u2212k\u00de \u00f0k2 \u2212M2W\u00de\u00f0\u00f0r \u2212 k\u00de2 \u2212M2W\u00de\u00f0\u00f0Q \u2212 k\u00de2 \u2212M2W\u00de\n\u00d7 g\u03c1\u03c9 \u2212 \u00f0Q \u2212 k\u00de\u03c1\u00f0Q \u2212 k\u00de\u03c9 M2W g\u03bb\u03b1 \u2212 \u00f0r \u2212 k\u00de\u03bb\u00f0r \u2212 k\u00de\u03b1 M2W g\u03c3\u03b1 \u2212 k\u03c3k\u03b1 M2W \u00fe \u00f0\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd; P \u2194 Q\u00de: \u00f0A1\u00de\nThe tensor T\u03bc\u03bd2;W of second Feynman amplitude in Fig. 4 has the similar form. Next, we consider the sum of these two amplitudes. To calculate the tensor T\u03bc\u03bdW of bosonic loop, we use the dispersion method, keeping in mind that the tensor that defines this loop has the general structure (15). Then the structure functions AW\u00f0t\u00de, BW\u00f0t\u00de can be obtained by performing the following convolutions over the Lorentz indices:\nAW\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc T\u03bc\u03bd 1\n2\ng\u03bc\u03bd\nv1v2 \u2212\nv\u03bd1v \u03bc 2\n\u00f0v1v2\u00de2 \u2212 1 ; BW\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc T\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n2\n3v\u03bd1v \u03bc 2\n\u00f0\u00f0v1v2\u00de2 \u2212 1\u00de2 \u2212\ng\u03bc\u03bd\nv1v2\u00f0\u00f0v1v2\u00de2 \u2212 1\u00de : \u00f0A2\u00de\nFor two structure functions AW\u00f0t\u00de, BW\u00f0t\u00de we use the dispersion relation with one subtraction,\nAW\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc AW\u00f00\u00de \u00fe t \u03c0\nZ \u221e\n1\nImA\u00f0t0\u00dedt0 t0\u00f0t0 \u2212 t\u00fe i0\u00de ; BW\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc BW\u00f00\u00de \u00fe t \u03c0\nZ \u221e\n1\nImB\u00f0t0\u00dedt0 t0\u00f0t0 \u2212 t\u00fe i0\u00de : \u00f0A3\u00de\nImaginary parts ImA\u00f0t\u00de, ImB\u00f0t\u00de can be calculated using the Mandelstam-Cutkosky rule [53,54].
