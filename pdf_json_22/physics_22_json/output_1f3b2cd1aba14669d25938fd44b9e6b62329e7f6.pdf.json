    "abstractText": "The heat transport characteristics, flow features, and entropy\u2010production of bi\u2010convection buoyancy induced, radiation\u2010assisted hydro\u2010magnetic hybrid nanofluid flow with thermal sink/source effects are inspected in this study. The physical characteristics of hybrid nanofluids (water\u2010hosted) are inherited from the base liquid (water) and none has considered the physical characteristics of base liquid (water) in the study of temperature\u2010sensorial hybrid nanofluid investigations, though the water physical characteristics are not constants in temperature variations. So, the temperature\u2010sensorial attributes of base liquid (water) are taken into account for this hybrid nanofluid ( Cu + Al2O3 +water ) flow analysis. The mathematical forms of the flow configuration (i.e., the set of coupled, nonlinear PDE form of governing equations) are solved by utilizing the subsequent tasks: (i) congenial transformation; (ii) quasilinearization; (iii) methods of finite differences to form block matrix system, and (iv) Varga\u2019s iterative algorithm. The preciseness of the whole numerical procedure is ensured by restricting the computation to follow strict convergence conditions. Finally, the numerically extracted results representing the impacts of various salient parameters on different profiles ( F,G,H ), gradients, and entropy production are exhibited in physical figures for better perception. A few noticeable results are highlighted as: velocity graph shows contrast behaviour under assisting and opposing buoyancy; temperature ( G(\u03be , \u03b7) ) is dropping for heightening heat source ( Q ) surface friction remarkably declines with the outlying magnetic field ( St ); thermal transport confronts drastic abatement under radiation ( R1 ), and St ; the characteristics Reynolds and Brinkman numbers promote entropy. Furthermore, the bounding surface acts as a strong source of S G \u2010production. Summarizations are listed at the end to quantify percentage variations.",

The physical characteristics of hybrid nanofluids (water\u2011hosted) are inherited from the base liquid (water) and none has considered the physical characteristics of base liquid (water) in the study of temperature\u2011sensorial hybrid nanofluid investigations, though the water physical characteristics are not constants in temperature variations. So, the temperature\u2011sensorial attributes of base liquid (water) are taken into account for this hybrid nanofluid ( Cu + Al2O3 +water ) flow analysis. The mathematical forms of the flow configuration (i.e., the set of coupled, nonlinear PDE form of governing equations) are solved by utilizing the subsequent tasks: (i) congenial transformation; (ii) quasilinearization; (iii) methods of finite differences to form block matrix system, and (iv) Varga\u2019s iterative algorithm. The preciseness of the whole numerical procedure is ensured by restricting the computation to follow strict convergence conditions. Finally, the numerically extracted results representing the impacts of various salient parameters on different profiles ( F,G,H ), gradients, and entropy production are exhibited in physical figures for better perception. A few noticeable results are highlighted as: velocity graph shows contrast behaviour under assisting and opposing buoyancy; temperature ( G(\u03be , \u03b7) ) is dropping for heightening heat source ( Q ) surface friction remarkably declines with the outlying magnetic field ( St ); thermal transport confronts drastic abatement under radiation ( R1 ), and St ; the characteristics Reynolds and Brinkman numbers promote entropy. Furthermore, the bounding surface acts as a strong source of S\nG \u2011production. Summarizations are listed at the end to\nquantify percentage variations."

In early studies, pioneer researchers1\u20133 studied this geometry with different aspects of non-constant wall temperature, different inclination angle, different Prandtl numbers, etc. An experimental study of naturally convective flow for an inclined plate is presented by Al-Arabi and others4. Lewandowski5 studied naturally convective flow along an inclined plate with a new approach. Jayaraj6 inspected the thermophoretic effects on the flow for inclined plates. Later, a naturally convective flow was investigated for particulate suspension for inclined (isothermal) and vertical permeable plates by Ramadan and Chamkha7,8. A study of radiative MHD flow with variable porosity along an inclined plate was carried out by Chamkha and others9. Alam et\u00a0al.10 reported the MHD effect in combination with variable suction, radiation effect on a permeable flow over inclined plate (semi-infinite). The study of boundary layer (BL) flow for vertical and inclined surfaces is further continued by several researchers11\u201316 considering different fluids (nanofluids, micro-polar fluids, etc.), and salient influencing factors like radiation, thermal injection/suction, outlying magnetic field, etc. An outlying magnetic field situating near an electrically conducting BL flow has numerous industrial engineering applications17\u201322. For example, in material processing, MHD effect may be used to get desired material structure23. Furthermore, the above-mentioned impactful factors in hybrid nanofluid flow encountered numerous applications in solar power technology, industrial areas, nuclear engineering, etc.,24,25. Recent studies26,27 showed that hybrid nanofluid is the most sensitive one in thermal transport means than ordinary fluid and nanofluids. Many studies on radiation, thermal source/sink, and MHD effects on hybrid nanofluid flow are available in current literature and a few of them are referred in the following texts28\u201333. Moreover, in any thermo-dynamical system, the engineering efficiency of the system degrades due to irreversible heat loss. The enumeration of irreversibility i.e., entropy generation (EG) of a system may help to minimize the irreversible heat loss. The application and importance of the EG-study of radiative MHD hybrid nanofluid flow affected by thermal sink/sources from biomedical point of view is explored by P.B.A. Reddy34. Researchers35 have found significant contributions of EG analysis in the studies of brain dynamics. Few more remarkable studies on this context are added as references36\u201340.\nIt is a common practice to use water as a base liquid but water and water-hosted nanofluids are temperaturesensitive. Besides the thermos physical nanofluid characteristics are inherited from the hosted liquid, those properties are enhanced, advanced and empowered by the properties (thermos-physical) of emerging nanoparticles. But in recent studies, it is observed that base fluid properties have been ignored in temperature-sensitive nanofluid flow investigations. So, authors have investigated the temperature-sensorial characteristics (thermosphysical) of hybrid nanofluids in the light of temperature-sensorial water characteristics. That is, this study is taking account the temperature-sensorial properties of water into the model41 for thermal relations utilizing empirical data42 and used them to analyze the hybrid nano-liquid flow. Furthermore, the equations presenting the physical meaning of the considered physical system in mathematical form are solved using the following complicated numerical tasks43,44: (i) congenial transformation; (ii) quasilinearization; (iii) methods of finitedifferences to form block matrix system, and (iv) Varga\u2019s iterative algorithm. The preciseness of the numerical approach is preserved by employing a strict convergence criterion."

The convective variation in temperature from the wall to the ambient fluid is deemed moderate ( < 40 \u00b0C) and an outer magnetic field normal to x-axis is applied under thermal sink/source and radiation effects.

            "text": "The investigation of bi-convective MHD flow in light of temperature-sensorial water properties with radiation, thermal suction/injection effects is accomplished in this manuscript considering Cu+ Al2O3/water hybrid nanofluid as working fluid. The acquired outcomes are featured out graphically to analyse the flow features, transport characteristics and energy distribution in comprehensive approach.\nVelocity. Figure\u00a02 is plotted to display the variable behaviour of the flow intensity ( F(\u03be , \u03b7) ) against the buoyancy force . It may be noted that F(\u03be , \u03b7) increases with , sometimes overshoot occurs. In the physical aspect, assisting buoyancy force always surpluses pressure gradient in flow and enhances flow intensity. As numerical supporting evidence, it is seen for = 1 and = 2 at \u03be = 0.5, \u03b7 = 1.40 that the velocity overshoots are 15% and 33% , respectively. In contrast, F(\u03be , \u03b7) decreases for < 0 , and in this case, for = \u22121.0 backflow is recorded within the region 0.0 < \u03b7 \u2264 0.85, \u03be = 0.5.\nTemperature. The changes in temperature-profile (G(\u03be , \u03b7)) against the variations of thermal sink/source (Q) is elaborated graphically in Fig.\u00a03. Since the heat source ( Q > 0 ) is kept in the BL to enhance heat energy, G(\u03be , \u03b7)-enhancement concerning Q > 0 is unambiguous. Specifically, at \u03be = 0.45, \u03b7 = 0.5 , varying Q from 0.0 to 0.3 and 0.0 to \u22120.3, G(\u03be , \u03b7)-profile increases and decreases, respectively, by 8% and 39%.\nGradients. Skin friction. The variation characteristics of friction coefficient ( \u221a ReCfx ) against different\nmagnitudes of St and \u03c6 are demonstrated in Fig.\u00a04, which reflects that \u221a ReCfx is a decreasing function of St but an increasing function of \u03c6 . The Lorentz\u2019s force associated with St is active to detract the BL region\u2019s flow intensity, and thus friction gets dissipated. On the other hand, enhancement of tiny nanoparticles in the fluid causes richer mass density and thus increases hybrid nanofluid\u2019s friction forces and finally, \u221a ReCfx increases. At\nthe instant \u03be = 0.5 with \u03c6 = 0.025 enhancing St of strengths 0.3 and 0.6 from 0 , \u221a ReCfx reduces by 48% and 87% , respectively.\nJn = {Bn \u2212 AnEn\u22121}\u22121{Dn \u2212 AnJn\u22121}; 2 \u2264 n \u2264 N ,\nE1 = EN+1 = [ 0 0 0 0 ] , J1 = [ 1\u2212 \u01eb 1 ] , JN+1 = [ \u01eb 0 ] .\n( Max {\u2223 \u2223\n\u2223\n( F\u03b7 )k+1 w \u2212 ( F\u03b7 )k w\n\u2223\n\u2223 \u2223 , \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 ( G\u03b7 )k+1 w \u2212 ( G\u03b7 )k w \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 } < 10\u22124 ) ,\nPr 2 5 7 10 100\nSoundalgekar and Murty54 0.6831 \u2013 \u2013 1.6808 \u2013\nChen55 0.68324 \u2013 1.38619 1.68008 5.54450\nSingh et\u00a0al.56 0.6830 1.151 1.386 1.6801 5.5450\nPresent results 0.6831 1.1512 1.3861 1.6801 5.5448\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:11831 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16059-9\nNusselt number. The corresponding impact of St on thermal transport performance ( Nux\u221a Re ) in combination with nanoparticles\u2019 shape effects are portrayed in Fig.\u00a05. The results indicate that the outlying force field ( St ) has a destructive impact on Nux\u221a\nRe , and among all the considered shapes, spherical-shaped nanoparticles affect most. In\nparticular at \u03be = 0.5, the decrement in sphericity (i.e., increment in sf = 3 ) from 1.0 to 0.36 enhances Nux\u221a Re almost by 7%.\nFigure\u00a06 depicts the effects of thermal radiation ( R1 ) on local thermal transport coefficient ( Nux\u221aRe ) and it is clearly visible in the graph that Nux\u221a\nRe is a decreasing function of R1 . Basically, the increasing magnitude of R1\ndirectly enhances systems\u2019 temperature, and the fluid in BL tries to become thermally equipoise. Hence temperature gradient gets reduced, which results in less thermal transport. At the instant \u03be = 1.0 , reduction in Nux\u221a\nRe is\n35% for imposing R1 of strength 1.0.\nFigure\u00a02. effect on F.\nFigure\u00a03.

Figures\u00a07, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 illuminate the contributions of different salient parameters on the productions of irreversible heats (entropy production SG ) and their respective shares on gross entropy. Figure\u00a07 indicates that the rate of SG-production increases with Re , but Re \u2019s contribution on SG is immensely high at the surface proximity. Physically, augmentation of Re increases the entropy generation SG due to fluid friction and heat transport (via inertia). For higher Re , fluid inertia augments thermal transport, i.e., HTI takes over the other irreversibility sources. In contrast for lower Re , as viscous force is high, FFI dominates the total SG close to the wall. Thus, the friction force gets mitigated within the boundary layer and HTI takes over the dominant place. Hence, Bejan lines for lower Re intersect the lines for higher Re within the boundary layer.\nMoreover, all the Bejan lines converge to zero at the boundary layer edge since HTI gradually reduces to zero at the edge of the boundary layer. It is also noticed that the surface plays a high intense SG-production source and is evidenced by the following specific calculation: at \u03b7 = 0.0 , SG elevates by 46% for varying Re in 10\u2212 12.5 while the change is only 20% at \u03b7 = 1.5 for the same variation of Re.\nFigure\u00a04.

As exhibited in Fig.\u00a012, higher Br boosts SG at the wall\u2019s proximity but discloses an opposite trend away from the surface. Lifting up the Br value causes added viscous force to the fluid and enhances frictional heating. This frictional heating turns up excessive SG-production. This fact is also evidenced in Fig.\u00a010, which shows lifted down Bejan lines for higher Br , which physically represents that most SG-productions are due to frictional heating (FFI), the associated entropy produced in other modes (i.e., HTI and DI) are comparatively less. Analysing the result data, 32% enhancement in SG is noticed for changing Br from 0.01 to 0.2 at \u03b7 = 0.5.\nFigures\u00a011 and 12 demonstrate how SG and Be get affected under the forces of buoyancy ( ). As one can point out from Fig.\u00a011 that SG shows a growing trend for the increase of . The earlier discussions proclaimed that larger pushes the fluids to move faster generates excessive friction at the wall and hence the irreversibility enhances (via FFI, as shown in Fig.\u00a012). Since the buoyancy effect is induced by the thermal imbalance between the wall and neighbouring fluids, the effect of is predominantly noticeable at the wall proximity. Hence, the irreversibilities due to variation vanish at the boundary layer edge and all SG-lines converge at the edge of the boundary layer.\nFigure\u00a06.

The bearings of flow features, thermal transport characteristics, and EG of magnetized bi-convective hybrid nano-liquid flow with nanoparticles\u2019 sphericity, radiation and thermal source/sink effects are studied in this investigation. The immensely nonlinear PDEs are changed into suitable form and then into linear form utilizing compatible transformation and quasilinearization techniques, respectively.
