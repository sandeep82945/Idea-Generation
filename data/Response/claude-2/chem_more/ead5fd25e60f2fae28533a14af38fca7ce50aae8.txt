 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effects of different membrane materials, pore sizes, and operating conditions on the retention of bioactive compounds during the integrated membrane process. This could help optimize the process for maximum retention.

2. Study the shelf life and stability of the concentrated juice over time. How do the bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities hold up during storage?

3. Evaluate the sensory characteristics of the final concentrated juice through descriptive analysis with trained panelists. How does it compare to fresh juice and thermally concentrated juice?

4. Formulate the concentrated juice into functional food and beverage products. Assess consumer acceptance and potential health benefits of fortified foods/drinks. 

5. Isolate, identify, and quantify the specific phenolic compounds and anthocyanins responsible for the observed bioactivities. Study their individual enzyme inhibition and antioxidant effects.
