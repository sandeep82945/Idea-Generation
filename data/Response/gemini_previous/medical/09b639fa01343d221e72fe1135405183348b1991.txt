1. **Investigate the long-term effects of digital mandala art therapy on mental health.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study that follows participants who have used the Digital Mandala app over time to see how their mental health changes. This would help to determine whether the app is effective in providing long-term relief from depression and anxiety.


2. **Explore the use of digital mandala art therapy in different populations.** The Digital Mandala app is currently only available to young people in South Korea. However, it could be adapted for use in other populations, such as older adults, children, or people with different mental health conditions. Research could be conducted to explore the effectiveness of the app in these different populations.


3. **Develop new digital art therapy interventions based on the Digital Mandala app.** The Digital Mandala app is just one example of a digital art therapy intervention. Other interventions could be developed that use different art forms, such as painting, drawing, or sculpture. Research could be conducted to compare the effectiveness of different digital art therapy interventions.


4. **Investigate the use of digital art therapy in combination with other mental health treatments.** Digital art therapy could be used in combination with other mental health treatments, such as medication or psychotherapy. Research could be conducted to explore the effectiveness of combining digital art therapy with other treatments.


5. **Develop guidelines for the use of digital art therapy in mental health care.** As digital art therapy becomes more popular, it is important to develop guidelines for its use in mental health care. These guidelines could help clinicians to determine when and how to use digital art therapy with their patients.
