ABSTRACT Introduction Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is described as pain that persists for longer than 3 months. At present, no research is available that understands why CMP develops and continues from the perspective of the individual. Research is needed to establish if there are any consistent biopsychosocial factors perceived as contributing to CMP and what informs such beliefs. Understanding individual beliefs will inform more effective communication between clinicians and patients about their CMP, as well as informing future research into the epidemiology of CMP. Interpretative phenomenological analysis will be used as a methodological framework as it explores how individuals make sense of their world through personal experiences and perceptions while preserving individual nuance. The aim of this study is to understand individuals\u2019 beliefs and perceptions about the biological, psychological and social factors, which contribute to the development and maintenance of their CMP. Methods and analysis A qualitative study informed by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research using interpretative phenomenological analysis and semistructured interviews. A maximum variation purposive sample of 6\u201312 adults with CMP will be recruited from the general public in the UK. One semistructured interview will be conducted with each participant via an online video platform with interviews transcribed verbatim. The interview schedule (codesigned with expert patients and informed by existing evidence) identifies three domains of important questions; (1) patient beliefs on why they developed and continue to experience CMP; (2) the relationship between their biopsychosocial experiences and CMP; and (3) the origin of their beliefs. Strategies such as \u2018member checking\u2019 will be employed to ensure trustworthiness. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted by the Research Ethics Office at the University of Birmingham (reference ERN_210813). Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study findings will be submitted for publication in a peerreviewed journal and for presentation at conferences.",

Despite this, most recent evidence identifies a 43% current prevalence of CMP across adults in the UK,3 which is steadily rising,4 and that 79%\u201392% of those with CMP continue to experience pain up to 12 years later.5\u20137 This suggests that further research into CMP is required.\nPain is experienced due to a complex interaction between the biological and psychological systems of the body which are influenced by social factors.8\u201310 This interaction can lead to a continued or repeated experience of musculoskeletal pain\u2014CMP\u2014despite no evidence of actual or potential damage to\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 The methods employed for this qualitative study are rigorous, designed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. \u21d2 The inclusion of people with all types of chronic musculoskeletal conditions will establish findings pertinent to a great number of stakeholders. \u21d2 The flexibility of semistructured interviews will ensure topics important to both the researcher and the participant are discussed while interpretative phenomenological analysis will enable the development of rich data entrenched in the lived experiences of the individual. \u21d2 The use of virtual interviews for research is relatively new and unexplored, and therefore, it is unclear if this is equally as effective as in- person interviews; it is possible that issues such as internet access and technology literacy may negatively impact the virtual interview process. \u21d2 Although in line with interpretative phenomenological analysis methods, the small sample size may limit the applicability of the study findings.\nP atna).

This in turn may reduce the likelihood of successful biopsychosocial management if individuals subsequently do not hold these same beliefs for psychosocial factors. However, this is not currently well understood. Furthering comprehension of individuals\u2019 beliefs on the causes of CMP and where these beliefs originate will provide the opportunity to address unhelpful beliefs and ensure that management approaches are well aligned, thus improving the likelihood of successful management. This will benefit patients, clinicians and researchers.\nFurthermore, early risk stratification for disease and proactive management is a strategy that works well for management of other chronic diseases such as heart disease24 and diabetes,25 and therefore, may be a useful strategy for improving management of CMP. However, awareness and understanding of the epidemiology of the disease is required for this to be effective. Many biopsychosocial risk factors for development of CMP are identified in existing research with many epidemiological cohort studies synthesised through several systematic reviews26\u201328 and an in- progress umbrella review.29 Qualitative research exploring patient beliefs around why they develop and continue to experience CMP may identify risk factors for its development, which are not amenable to detection through quantitative methods.30 31 Earlier identification of individuals at risk of CMP will provide the opportunity for proactive management as practised for other chronic diseases.\nTo better manage CMP, a thorough understanding of the biopsychosocial factors that may contribute to its development and prolonged presence is needed. Existing research has explored this through both quantitative26\u201328 and qualitative methods.32\u201334 However, this research tends to be specific to a particular musculoskeletal condition such as lower back pain. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there is no qualitative research that includes participants with all forms of CMP investigating why they believe they developed and continue to experience CMP. Those with lower back pain may demonstrate beliefs such as damage to and poor healing of the spine34 and\nthese beliefs may contribute to development of chronic lower back pain.26 Similar beliefs may exist in those with any form of CMP and therefore qualitative research is required to explore this further.\nThese are complex factors which are influenced by a variety of individual aspects such as race, ethnicity and culture,35 and therefore, this needs to be explored from individual perspectives. Qualitative methods are useful in healthcare research, particularly in the discovery of emerging themes or phenomena which are not amenable to quantitative methods,36 and therefore, are well placed to investigate this further. Interpretative phenomenological analysis methods may be particularly useful as this will observe in detail how participants make sense of their world by exploring personal experiences and perceptions, thus enabling the preservation of individual nuance and meaning inherent to the participants experience of CMP37 which is often lost in larger data sets.38"

The objectives are: 1. To explore individuals\u2019 beliefs on the factors that con-\ntributed to development and maintenance of their CMP. 2. To explore the biological, psychological and social experiences of individuals and whether they believe there to be any contributory relationship to the development and continued experience of their CMP. 3. To explore where individuals\u2019 beliefs originate.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS Design and theoretical framework This qualitative study has been designed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research.39 Research methods are underpinned by interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) and data will be collected using semistructured interviews.\nIPA is situated as a minimal hermeneutic realist, where there is a belief that an external reality exists but is presented by an individual\u2019s view of it.40 Furthermore, it is considered an ideographic approach that can illustrate how individuals make sense of a specific situation and presented in a way that provides details of this. Research that uses IPA seeks to present the uniqueness of the individuals view of the world but at the same time present further understanding through the researchers\u2019 own interpretation. This is referred to as the double hermeneutic.41"

An interview schedule has been developed in order to direct and maintain consistency and structure across interviews (online supplemental file C). The interview schedule has been informed by the biopsychosocial model of health, an extensive umbrella review of the factors associated with development of CMP (in preparation for publication), the expertise of the authors (MD, ABR, AS and NRH) and input from patients and public through a meeting with a PPI group with CMP. Details of PPI input have been outlined in accordance with the Guidance for reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP) 2 checklist,45 which is presented in table 1. The interview schedule will be piloted to determine effectiveness of language and comprehension as well as timing, and amended as necessary prior to data collection. The semistructured nature allows for the emergence of new themes to develop which are important to the participant and facilitates the maintenance of flowing conversation.43 An iterative approach to the interviews will be taken with questions within the interview schedule being adapted or refined based on preceding interviews.\nAll interviews are voluntary with participants free to pause the interview at any stage or cease the interview altogether should they choose. Should a participant become distressed at any point during an interview, in accordance with our risk assessment for the study (online supplemental file D), participants will be offered the opportunity to stop and will be signposted to any appropriate services as necessary by the lead researcher.

            "text": "The present evidence base looking at factors associated with CMP is largely composed of quantitative research. While useful, qualitative research will provide greater depth and insights into personal experiences, thus providing richer data which may identify additional emerging causative factors for CMP as well as bolstering existing findings.36 48 Methods triangulation in this manner is a widely employed approach in epidemiology research whereby \u2018if results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens the confidence of the finding\u2019.49 IPA is particularly useful in this regard because of the double hermeneutic which will capture the unique view of the individual on why they have CMP but will also elicit further understanding of this through the researchers\u2019 own interpretations.41 This enables influence of interpretation based on the existing\nevidence base as well as the professional experiences of the researchers as musculoskeletal physiotherapists (MD, NRH and ABR).\nTo this end, the planned study may inform future research into risk stratification for CMP and proactive management as practised for other long- term conditions. Epidemiological research has led to risk stratification for long- term conditions with proactive management to prevent its development, which has shown to be effective.24 25 50 Findings from a recent systematic review suggest that this may also be a promising line of research in the management of CMP.51 However, further research is required due to limited applicability of these findings due to most existing research being specific to low back pain only and poor to moderate quality of studies.51 The proposed study may inform future research with qualitative evidence of factors which may contribute to CMP. Additionally, unhelpful beliefs may be identified which may hinder proactive management such as education and behavioural advice.\nPast studies have shown that beliefs shape attitudes and adherence towards healthcare management in individuals with CMP.52 53 Furthermore, beliefs may affect communication with healthcare professionals54 and effectiveness of intervention.18\u201322 It is therefore important to understand if unhelpful beliefs exist and the nature of such beliefs in people with CMP. Clinicians may play a vital role in this with research showing that clinicians\u2019 attitudes and beliefs inform that of their patients.55 56 Further to this, when clinicians\u2019 beliefs are biomedical in nature, this is associated with increased time off work, reduced physical activity and poorer adherence to treatment guidelines for their patients.55 While this highlights the critical role of clinicians in shaping beliefs, a recent Cochrane review echoed the findings that patient beliefs about their musculoskeletal disorders shape their attitudes and behaviours on how to manage it.17 The planned study will provide valuable insights into what individuals with CMP believe about their conditions and where this originates.\nThe planned study will use a small sample and will, therefore, provide the foundations to inform further investigation. This is in line with Medical Research Council and National Institute for Healthcare Research guidance for developing complex interventions to improve healthcare.57 Particularly, this embodies the \u2018Undertake primary data collection\u2019 action which encourages use of qualitative research to understand the context within which interventions will operate. This will, therefore, provide foundation research, which will provide clinicians and researchers an opportunity to address unhelpful beliefs and design personalised management approaches.\nTwitter Michael Dunn @MikeDunnPhysio, Alison B Rushton @abrushton, Andrew Soundy @Andy_Soundy and Nicola R Heneghan @HeneghanNicola\nAcknowledgements With thanks to the Centre for Precision Rehabilitation of Spinal Pain PPI group for their advice and feedback which contributed to the inception and design of this study.\nP atna).
