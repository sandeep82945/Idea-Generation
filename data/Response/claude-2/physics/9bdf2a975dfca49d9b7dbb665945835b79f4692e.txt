 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the mechanism by which Arabidopsis ERV1 can directly oxidize COX19 in the presence of glutathione. Does a glutathionylated ERV1 intermediate form? What is the electron transfer pathway?

2. Explore whether Arabidopsis ERV1 can directly oxidize other MIA40 substrates besides COX19 when glutathione is present. This could reveal the generality of the glutathione-dependent ERV1 oxidase activity. 

3. Determine if small amounts of glutaredoxins are present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space in plants and characterize their potential role in assisting oxidative protein folding.

4. Measure the in vivo redox potential of the MIA40 catalytic disulfide in plant mitochondria and compare it to the glutathione redox potential to see if MIA40 is largely oxidized.

5. Investigate why the Arabidopsis MIA40-ERV1 couple cannot efficiently oxidize CCMH. Identify any differences in substrate binding or electron transfer properties compared to the yeast couple.
