    "abstractText": "Background: Entrepreneurship education has gained significant attention in engineering. This has led to the widespread development of engineering entrepreneurship programs (EEPs) that instill entrepreneurial skills and mindsets in engineering graduates. While research has documented the benefits of EEPs, there is a paucity of research examining differences among men and women on factors informing their participation in EEPs. The purpose of the study is to examine differences across men and women regarding the factors that influence their decision to participate in EEPs. Methodology: This study uses an interpretative, qualitative approach using 20 student interviews as the data source. The interview transcripts are analyzed to identify key emergent themes pertinent to the differences among men and women. Findings: The findings identify five themes that unpack the differences between men and women in regard with factors informing their participation in EEPs: entrepreneurial selfefficacy, entrepreneurial intent, venture and nonventure creation goals, subjective influence of peers, and instructional preferences. Conclusion: Factors informing participation in EEPs are nuanced in meanings across men and women. Administrators and practitioners may use the differing factors and their nuances to better design curricular, pedagogical, advising, and outreach aspects of EEPs to create equitable and inclusive environments for women.",

This has led to the widespread development of engineering entrepreneurship programs (EEPs) that instill entrepreneurial skills and mindsets in engineering graduates. While research has documented the benefits of EEPs, there is a paucity of research examining differences among men and women on factors informing their participation in EEPs. The purpose of the study is to examine differences across men and women regarding the factors that influence their decision to participate in EEPs.\nMethodology: This study uses an interpretative, qualitative approach using 20 student interviews as the data source. The interview transcripts are analyzed to identify key emergent themes pertinent to the differences among men and women.\nFindings: The findings identify five themes that unpack the differences between men and women in regard with factors informing their participation in EEPs: entrepreneurial selfefficacy, entrepreneurial intent, venture and nonventure creation goals, subjective influence of peers, and instructional preferences.\nConclusion: Factors informing participation in EEPs are nuanced in meanings across men and women. Administrators and practitioners may use the differing factors and their nuances to better design curricular, pedagogical, advising, and outreach aspects of EEPs to create equitable and inclusive environments for women.\nIndex Terms\u2014Engineering education, entrepreneurship, qualitative, recruitment."

As a result, expectations for engineers in the global economy has expanded from solely engaging in technical problem solving in their designated roles, to being an active participant in the entrepreneurial problem-identification process by leveraging ongoing technological advancements in the field [2]. Fueled by this need to develop entrepreneurially minded engineers,\nManuscript received 10 October 2021; revised 30 March 2022 and 14 June 2022; accepted 1 August 2022.

This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant 1531533.\nThis work involved human subjects or animals in its research. Approval of all ethical and experimental procedures and protocols was granted by the University of Michigan\u2019s IRB.\nThe author is with the School of Applied Engineering and Technology, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ 07102 USA (e-mail: pshekhar@njit.edu).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109/TE.2022.3208524\nseveral engineering entrepreneurship programs (EEPs) have been initiated across U.S. universities at the undergraduate level [3], [4]. Offered in a wide array of formats, these programs expose students to entrepreneurial content and training in research-based experiential learning environments through formal curricular and informal cocurricular programming [5], [6], [7]. For the purpose of this study, entrepreneurial skills are described as one\u2019s ability to successfully perform different tasks associated with the entrepreneurial process, such as searching for opportunities, transforming the identified idea into a business plan, and gathering resources to launch a venture [8].\nOngoing research on the impact of EEPs continues to document its effectiveness and reiterate its importance in engineering education. This body of literature includes studies on assessment of student learning and entrepreneurial mindset [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], impact of EEPs on engineering students\u2019 academic performance and retention [11], and students\u2019 entrepreneurial intent and career choices [15]. For example, Ohland et al. [14] assessed EEP which engaged undergraduate students at NC State University. The researchers used a longitudinal assessment approach and reported that students who participated in the program had higher rates of persistence in engineering (70% versus 51%) and higher cumulative grade point averages (3.08 versus 2.83) when compared to a matched sample of students who did not participate in the program [14]. The researchers also reported a positive impact of participation on students\u2019 self-reported teamwork and leadership skills, and preparedness for work. In another example, results from a multi-institutional study show that students\u2019 confidence in their ability to perform different tasks associated with entrepreneurship was significantly higher among students who participated in entrepreneurship courses versus nonparticipant students [5].\nWhile these studies provide valuable insights on different aspects of entrepreneurship programming, there is a paucity of precursory research examining factors that promote/diminish engineering students\u2019 participation in EEPs; specifically, in regard with investigating differences across men and women. Considering the underrepresentation of women in STEM entrepreneurship [16], literature notes the importance of EEPs in building entrepreneurial skills and enhancing entrepreneurial career aspirations among women in STEM fields [17]. Furthermore, a systematic review of academic entrepreneurship literature notes that almost negligible research\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

As a result, researchers have called for a gendered examination of entrepreneurial ecosystems, particularly in engineering technology fields [19]. It is noted that gender is a nonbinary construct [20]. However, this article scope focusses on men and women by examining the research question: what are the differences across men and women regarding the factors that influence their decision to participate in EEPs? As the growth in EEPs continues in undergraduate engineering education [21], it is argued that it is critical to develop EEPs that are inclusive and equitable to women. Entrepreneurship has traditionally been a male-majority field, and often the programmatic structure and practices, are rooted in masculine norms, and cultures. Examining differences across men and women allows for understanding minoritized populations\u2019 perspectives (women in our case), and how they may or may not conform with the prevalent perspectives captured from men\u2019s responses. Research-based understanding of factors informing student participation for men and women will assist in the thoughtful development and implementation of inclusive and equitable EEPs, by taking minoritized populations\u2019 perspectives into account. Furthermore, the findings also provide important theoretical and research implications for the nascent but growing subfield of engineering entrepreneurship education [4]."

            "text": "The study followed a qualitative, interpretive approach using interviews as our data source. Interviews allow researchers to capture unobservable participant data and are useful when the intent of the study is to examine participants\u2019 perspectives [22]. In this study, 20 interviews were conducted to examine engineering students\u2019 perspectives in regard with their participation in EEPs. The interviews were primarily conducted by researcher 1 who is formally trained in engineering at undergraduate and master\u2019s level, and engineering education research at the doctoral level. Researcher 1 does not have prior background or formal education in entrepreneurship. However, to better understand the entrepreneurial ecosystem, two steps were taken. First, researcher 1 interacted with administrators and faculty engaged in EEPs. Second, researcher 2 attended initial interviews which were led by researcher 1 but researcher 2 asked probing questions when needed. Researcher 2 is a faculty member involved in engineering entrepreneurship education and holds a doctoral degree in engineering, and master\u2019s degree in business administration. Cumulatively, these two steps assisted in gathering contextualized student responses during the interview without biasing the interview process. For example, to initiate the interview, the students were asked about EEPs that they have engaged in. The knowledge of different EEP offerings gained through interactions with EEP faculty and administrators; and the presence of the second researcher allowed the first researcher to ask to follow up with probing questions.\nThe interviews were approximately an hour in length. A semi-structured format was followed in which preplanned questions were asked in addition to cross-questioning to further probe participants\u2019 responses [23]. The interview\nprotocol was informed by key constructs noted in the widely used theory in the entrepreneurship education literature (e.g., theory of planned behavior [24], social cognitive career theory [25], and Shapero\u2019s entrepreneurial event theory [26]), and adult learning [27]. The systematic review conducted to identify the key theories and synthesize pertinent constructs is presented elsewhere [27]. Example constructs noted in these theories, and their descriptions are summarized in Table I.\nInterview questions gathered insights about the constructs. For example, for entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE), the participants were asked, what skills do you think you need to perform well in EEPs, and how did your confidence in these skills inform your decision to enroll or not enroll? Similarly, why did you enroll in EEPs, focused on entrepreneurial intent. The interview protocol also included generic questions that were not directly tied to the constructs, as presented in the following.\n1) How and when did you learn about EEPs? 2) What were your prior experiences that motivated your\ninterest in EEPs? 3) What was the most challenging part of EEPs? 4) What types of teaching styles were you exposed to in\nEEPs? What did you like or dislike about them? The 20 study participants were undergraduate engineering students at a research-intensive university located in the United States. The university\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem can be described as a \u201chub\u201d wherein the institution is strongly committed to furthering its mission in the area of engineering entrepreneurship education and offers a wide array of curricular and co-curricular programmatic offerings [28]. These EEP offerings collectively aim to train students to successfully translate their knowledge into real-world applications, and act on opportunities in their entrepreneurial endeavors. The EEPs focus on engineering-specific aspects, such as leveraging technology and experimentation, and aspects associated with the entrepreneurial process, such as opportunity recognition, risk management, relationship building, and perseverance. To achieve this purpose, the university offers a wide array of curricular EEPs (e.g., standalone courses and a minor in entrepreneurship) as well as co-curricular EEPs (e.g., workshops, trips to startups, pitch competitions, incubators, and accelerators).\nThe participant sample included an equal number of self-identified men and women. In regard to race/ethnicity, there were three Asian/Asian\u2013American, one Latinx/Hispanic, five White/Caucasian, and two mixed-ethnicity participants.\nNine participants declined to report their race/ethnicity. To account for maximum variation sampling [29], the sample included students from different majors (3\u2014computer science, 5\u2014undeclared major, 2\u2014computer, 4\u2014mechanical, 3\u2014industrial and operations, 1\u2014biomedical, and 1\u2014nuclear engineering); and undergraduate standing (6\u2014first year, 4\u2014sophomore, 4\u2014junior, and 6\u2014senior). Furthermore, the participant sample included students that have varied EEP experiences, such as standalone courses, minor in entrepreneurship, co-curricular entrepreneurship programming, and no experience with EEPs."

            "text": "The data analysis approach followed a three-step process: 1) first cycle coding; 2) second cycle coding; and 3) identification of key themes [30]. The first cycle coding involved developing an inventory based on codes emergent in the transcripts. Two researchers were engaged in the initial coding process. To establish interrater reliability, two researchers first independently coded one interview transcript which was followed by a detailed discussion to develop an initial coding inventory. It is to note that theoretical constructs were not used during the first cycle to mitigate theoretical bias in the initial coding process. An external researcher not involved in the project also independently coded the transcript to check for potential biases. Next, the two researchers coded two additional transcripts which was followed by another round of discussion to refine the coding inventory, and resolution of any discrepancies. The coding inventory produced after this\nstage was used by the two researchers to analyze four additional transcripts. The initial agreement represented by an intraclass correlation of 0.88 between the two raters determined the interrater reliability. Remaining discrepancies were resolved through further discussion to reach a full agreement. The second cycle coding involved analytical categorization of the codes that emerged from the first cycle coding process. Pertinent theoretical constructs were used in the second cycle as applicable in the emergent data. For example, the construct of ESE, which is widely noted construct in the literature, was used to categorize first cycle codes that captured confidence in one\u2019s ability to successfully perform different tasks. Two researchers jointly performed the categorization of the codes operationalized in the first cycle with feedback from another researcher serving as an external check to the categorization process. Finally, key themes recurring in the data were synthesized after multiple iterations to bring meaning to the findings in regard with the research questions [30], [31]. This process specifically focused on identifying key themes that differed across men and women participants\u2019 responses."

            "heading": "III. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The analysis of the qualitative interviews identified the differences between men and women in regard with their participation in EEPs. This section presents the key emergent differing themes between men and women\u2019s responses: ESE, entrepreneurial intent, venture and nonventure creation goals, subjective influence of peers, and instructional preferences. In addition, this section provides a discussion on the practical and theoretical implications of the emergent findings by leveraging pertinent empirical and theoretical literature.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy: ESE can be described as one\u2019s perceived confidence in performing different entrepreneurship-related tasks in a successful manner [31], [32], [33]. The concept of ESE is rooted in the self-efficacy theory [34] and social cognitive career theory [35] which posit that self-efficacy shapes students\u2019 academic interests and the types of activities they choose to engage in. Consistent with this literature, in the study findings, both men and women underscored the importance of ESE in one\u2019s decision to enroll in the EEPs. However, differences were found between men and women students in their selfefficacy toward successfully performing entrepreneurial tasks involving communication and public speaking. The findings noted that overall men were confident in engaging in public speaking while engaging in various entrepreneurship-related activities, such as pitching and presenting ideas. Responding to the question about how confidence in skills needed to perform well in EEPs informed students\u2019 decision to enroll in EEPs, one student expressed, \u201cI think it depends on how much you believe in yourself as a public speaker but I think that would be fun to do that. Yeah, I think I would be good at it.\u201d Specifically, reflecting on what makes the student enroll in the EEPs, a student who enrolled in EEPs said:\nUsually, I can speak what I want to say, to whatever I want to say, and I just have a general, I would say I have a general inclination to just put stuff out there because better said than just walking around and not doing much. I think it would definitely make me more up to the decision. So, if I were presented with, oh this is a good course, do you have hesitation in enrolling in it? I\u2019d probably say no, because I\u2019m pretty confident in my ability to well in such a course.\nIn contrast, while some women were confident, majority of the responses noted low ESE in regard with presenting and pitching ideas in public in spite of their participation in EEPs. For instance, commenting on the task of selling ideas or products to people, a student expressed, \u201cScience and math I\u2019m confident, but I\u2019m not good at, I feel like I\u2019m not good at selling things, which is something I see in my brother . . . I feel like I wouldn\u2019t want to be the front, like, the face of whatever project, I would rather be doing something behind the scenes.\u201d Another student expressed her low confidence and reported that she is getting better at it through engagement in the EEPs, she said \u201cDecently confident. Getting more so. That\u2019s actually a goal of mine. They\u2019re starting to transition me into being able\nto do these big design reviews and presentations and pitches. Working on it.\u201d\nIn addition, men and women differed in ESE pertaining to the notion of \u201cbeing an entrepreneur.\u201d Women found working in an open-ended environment which involves putting your ideas others to judge as \u201cscary.\u201d This can be partly attributed to the platforms by which ideas are judged in EEPs such as pitch competitions, which are explicated and discussed in the instructional preferences section of this article. It is note that these responses were experienced primarily by women who participated in EEPs, and they reported it as one of the reasons why women may choose to not engage in EEPs. Overall, women found entrepreneurship as intimidating and noted it as a major deterrent for student participation, as expressed in this comment,\nBefore coming into any entrepreneurship thing, I was just like \u201coh, I\u2019m not an entrepreneur. I don\u2019t have a really great, innovative idea that\u2019s going to change everything. I didn\u2019t think of this by myself.\u201d It\u2019s intimidating, I think; the entrepreneurship idea. I think that\u2019s maybe another reason that people don\u2019t go for it, because it\u2019s intimidating.\nIn case of men, although some responses acknowledged that entrepreneurship can be intimidating, majority expressed high ESE in regard with aspects associated with an entrepreneur such as starting a company and working in an open-ended environment. For example, reflecting on why one would engage in EEPs, a student expressed, \u201cIt\u2019s confidence that starting a company at least isn\u2019t ruled out in your future plans. Maybe you won\u2019t do it, maybe you will, but you haven\u2019t ruled it out, and so you\u2019re confident that you at least want to try, and then that\u2019s why you enroll in the course.\u201d In another example, when asked about influencers that informs one\u2019s decision to engage in EEPs, a student reported confidence as the last factor, demonstrating that he held high ESE toward working in an open-ended environment, he said \u201cThen last is the confidence, just because the confidence I feel like would have been the last, just because it was such an open environment that I wasn\u2019t worried if I was confident or not. I wasn\u2019t worried that I needed to develop confidence in it.\u201d\nThese findings emphasize that administrators and practitioners should be cognizant of students\u2019 ESE when designing and developing EEPs. Since individuals are likely to avoid tasks with low self-efficacy [36], women with low ESE might get intimidated by EEPs which will negatively impact their participation [37]. ESE has been widely studied in the entrepreneurship literature. Specifically, researchers have noted ESE as a precursor for entrepreneurial intent [32], [38] and also identified factors that may impact one\u2019s ESE, such as past entrepreneurship-related experiences [33], [38], personality [39], [40], and experience with entrepreneurship programming [41]. In view of these studies, the presented findings implicate that administrators should be cautious in advertising that prior business experiences and/or skills are a prerequisite for succeeding in the EEPs. Rather, explicit emphasis that EEPs will assist in building these skills might serve as an effective recruitment and retention strategy for\nwomen. Furthermore, administrators may choose to leverage noncurricular programs such as design teams to help students with low ESE get acclimatized to entrepreneurship in a lowstakes setting. Student-led extracurricular design experiences are noted to enhance students\u2019 self-efficacy in innovation-related tasks [42]. Such participation experiences may also positively shape women\u2019s confidence in succeeding, and encourage them to further participate in more formal curricular offerings.\nEntrepreneurial Intent: Entrepreneurial Intent or the intention to engage in entrepreneurial activities is a widely noted as a key driver of actual entrepreneurial engagement in theoretical [24] and empirical studies [43], [44]. In regard with entrepreneurial intent, two reasons were prominently noted in the responses explaining why students engage in EEPs. First, responses noted that students participated in EEPs because they intended to start a company or venture. Second, the other commonly noted reason was that students wanted to develop solutions to solve problems. While these two reasons were noted in both men and women\u2019s responses, nuances were noted between men and women in regard with the second reason\u2014why students wanted to solve problems.\nIn case of men, EEPs provided an opportunity to work on open-ended problems which allowed them to learn different ways of problem solving and apply the learning in their future pursuits. Students reported that they perceived EEPs as a means for \u201cinnovating and problem solving, which can be applicable [in] any career\u201d and beneficial in gaining a mindset to \u201cattack problems in different ways.\u201d In contrast, while women also perceived EEPs as a means to engage in developing innovative solutions to solve problems, the rationale behind the engagement were driven by their intention to bring positive changes in the world around them. For example, reflecting on her future career goals, a student expressed, \u201cI don\u2019t really have my future career prospects laid out super well right now, but I can definitely see using what I\u2019ve learned in [EEPs] and, you know, my passion for trying to create global change.\u201d Another echoed, \u201cI see so many problems in the world. The reason I\u2019m interested in entrepreneurship is to solve problems and to actually make this world a better place, or make it an easier place.\u201d\nDue to its origin in business fields, entrepreneurial intent is typically conceptualized and measured in regard with starting a company [45], [46]. Often studies use entrepreneurial intent as an outcome of program interventions and as metric to examine differences across men and women. Sole reliance on \u201cventure-focused\u201d entrepreneurial intent as an outcome or explanatory measure does not sufficiently capture \u201cwhy\u201d one intends to start a company. In the context of presented findings, this shows that typical entrepreneurial intent measures may place the aspects of \u201cproblem solving\u201d on a secondary level\u2014a trait characteristic of engineering profession [47]. Furthermore, this approach limits researchers from examining the underlying reasons behind problem solving or starting a company.\nThe presented findings note that women perceived EEPs as a platform to have a positive impact on the world. Thus, it is plausible that without explicit emphasis, women may perceive entrepreneurial intent to be only associated with starting a \u201cprofit-centric\u201d venture, which may hinder their participation in EEPs. In an excellent critique, Downey (2005) highlights\nthe importance of engineers becoming \u201cproblem definers\u201d in addition to only being \u201cproblem solvers\u201d [48]. While problem solving involves developing engineering solutions, the aspect of problem defining also involves the rationale and motivation behind the problem-solving process. In the study presented here, it was found that while men talked about attacking a problem, women offered their motivations behind engaging in the problem-solving process. Thus, entrepreneurship programming for engineers may place equal emphasis on problem solving and more importantly be inclusive of a diverse set of motivations in the \u201cproblem-defining\u201d process. While men\u2019s career decisions are driven by monetary or status gain, women tend to select based on the perceived social good of the career choice [49], [50]. Also, from a professional formation perspective, Downey (2005) recommends that integration of problem definition into engineering education will legitimize the \u201chuman dimensions of engineering work alongside technical problem solving\u201d [48, p. 594]. Thus, providing opportunities for students to define problems that they solve in the entrepreneurial process, and ensuring that the pedagogical and curricular environments are structured to be inclusive to broader human dimensions and motivations may better serve women in academic entrepreneurship spaces. Furthermore, incorporating these changes in new or revising existing EEPs will provide women with avenues to engage in the entrepreneurial process that resonates with the feminist ethic of caring, and provide pathways to entrepreneurially solve societal issues rather than solely engaging in entrepreneurship from a stringent profit-centric worldview [51], [52], [53]. Finally, from a theoretical standpoint, intent holds a central position in theories frequently used in the entrepreneurship education literature [27], particularly when examining differences between men and women. However, if the construct and pertinent measurement instruments are defined from a \u201cdominant\u201d perspective, then such studies may yield biased results. Thus, future work may focus on theorizing constructs that are include minoritized students\u2019 perspectives.\nGoals (Venture Creation or Nonventure Creation): The goal to pursue nonventure creation career paths emerged as a notable differing factor for participating in EEPs for women. While majority of men expressed that they engaged in EEPs to meet their goals of starting a company, women found EEPs as a medium for getting entrepreneurial training beneficial in meeting different career goals rather than only serving as a platform for students who are interesting in venture creation. Overall, women indicated that they engaged in EEPs because they wanted to go to industry or work in startups and felt that EEPs provided preprofessional preparation, exposure to business plan development, product branding and understand how the industry functions. For example, one student reported how that she wanted to work in a startup rather than start her own venture, she said, \u201cI even think, thinking about it now, I don\u2019t ever see myself as the starter, or the founder of a business. I see myself working for a startup.\u201d Another expressed,\nBut I think females take them more because they\u2019ve got a little bit of an interest, and then usually that grows. And then the males have usually have done their research, and have maybe. . . Actually, already\nhave an idea and want to use the classes as a platform to grow that, is what I\u2019ve seen a lot of, actually. A lot of the men come in with their own ideas of what they want to do and start a business. And the females are there more to just get the education behind it and then maybe develop ideas later on.\nWith the broader aim of engineering and other STEMfocused EEPs is to develop entrepreneurially minded graduates, it is important to encourage participation from a wider student population. It is highly likely that the number of students seeking to start their own company during their undergraduate education and immediately upon graduation will be significantly less than students interested in developing the skillsets. To cater to students who do not intend to create a venture in the short term, EEPs may place greater emphasis on experiences and skills that are also valuable in nonventure creation careers. More importantly, this should be accompanied with outreach efforts that advertise and disseminate this broader applicability of EEPs. In light of the study findings and recent engineering education literature [54], such efforts may assist in encouraging participation from a diverse group of students, women in particular.\nSubjective Influence of Peers: Subjective influence of peers was also a found as a key influencer informing students\u2019 decision to engage or not engage in EEPs. In men\u2019s responses, we found that gaining information and feedback about EEP offerings from peers informed students\u2019 decision to participate. For instance, reflecting on how he learned about the EEP, one student expressed, \u201cI only found out because one of my friends looked and said, \u201cOh dude, look they\u2019re doing this right now and this looks like a really cool class.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, cool. Let\u2019s do it together.\u201d And a couple of my friends went, we made a group, and built an app in that class.\u201d Similarly, another student commented on how talking to peers provided him with information about a particular entrepreneurship course\u2014\u201cThat one just stuck out to me the more I spoke to one of my friends who had also done both the classes and I was like talking to them. Based off my workload that semester and what the class was like, and how much work I\u2019d have to do outside of class, that\u2019s what I used to make my decision basically.\u201d\nIn case of women, in addition to gaining information, the subjective approval provided by peers played a more \u201cinspirational role\u201d in informing their decision to engage in EEPs. Several students expressed that interacting with someone who has experienced the program served as role models, made them feel empowered and motivated, and reaffirmed that EEPs were the \u201cright thing\u201d for them. For example, commenting on the influence of peers on EEP participation, one student said, \u201cPeers are better for people who are like, \u2018Oh, that could be me, because, you know, you\u2019re a student just like me. You\u2019re an ME [Mechanical Engineering] student just like me.\u201d\u2019\nEntrepreneurship literature extensively notes the importance and impact of role models among individuals. Specifically, role models can have positive impact on women\u2019s entrepreneurial intent [55], entrepreneurial self-efficacy [38], and providing access to mentoring and resources by exposing individuals\nto entrepreneurial networks [56]. Furthermore, in line with other research, the presented findings illustrate that role models can play a motivational role [57], [58] in individuals entrepreneurial pursuits as well as guide them in navigating entrepreneurial challenges [25]. In addition, recent renditions of expectancy value theory underscores that student\u2019s intent and consequent engagement is often \u201csituated\u201d and influenced by socializers [59]. Thus, in regard with subjective influence of peers on women\u2019s participation, administrators may pursue targeted outreach efforts (e.g., student organizations which engage women such as Society of Women Engineers) rather than generic approaches. In addition, within the existing programs, administrators may also choose to establish a peer/alumni network in which women who have undertaken EEPs engage with prospective students and share their experiences. This will facilitate opportunities for finding peer role-models, mentors, and community building among women. Furthermore, this may also assist in strengthening women\u2019s ESE, an influencing factor noted previously in the findings.\nInstructional Preferences: Although there was overall positive feedback on student-centered instruction implemented in EEPs, several women expressed their discomfort with pitch competitions and noted it as a deterrent toward participation in EEPs. For example, a student noted that \u201ca lot of people have a general phobia of public speaking and a fear of people criticizing their ideas once they\u2019ve put them out there.\u201d Another student said that she \u201cfelt threatened\u201d by pitch competitions, while other and reported a lack of confidence in participating in pitch competitions: \u201cI guess for me it was more like I would like to learn to be better at pitches and everything. I definitely envy girls that can stand up in front of a class full of boys and give a pitch or give a presentation confidently, which I guess might be something that deters girls from it too.\u201d Finally, women students recalled their past negative experiences with in pitch competitions, as detailed in this student remark.\nYeah, that course was really, especially just the how blunt and rash Professor [X] was in any feedback that we did get, which was pretty limited, about our presentation. Like I said, I thought that I was very good at presentation communication skills and intergroup communication skills, as well. He had very strong things to say about our team and our presentation and things like that. That was very disheartening at times because I haven\u2019t had instructors... I\u2019ve never felt like an instructor wanted me to fail, before. I know looking back he didn\u2019t want us to fail. He was trying to do that to force us to realize that we\u2019re. . . Things that we could address. He never thought that we were a complete failure. He just wanted us to realize that there were holes that we could fix and to show them, but that was very discouraging for a while.\nBased on these findings, one recommendation is for practitioners and administrators to be cautious of the impact of their instructional choices. There should be thoughtful appraisal of which instructional approaches to pursue rather than embed\nvaried activities associated with entrepreneurial practice which may act as a barrier to equitable participation. Instruction in EEPs is often designed to imitate the experiences of practicing entrepreneurs. As a result, EEPs extensively use several evidence-based instructional practices, such as project-based learning, experiential learning, and collaborative learning. In the presented study, although students held a positive outlook toward most of these instructional practices, several women reported that pitch competitions may discourage them from participating. Pitch competitions are a common part of entrepreneurial practice and are often embedded in EEPs. While pitch competitions might be intimidating for all students, it is important to point out that the atmosphere of pitch competitions in typical scenarios is male dominated as they are structured to value stereotypical traits which are societally devalued in women. In particular, operating within the masculine norms of entrepreneurship, \u201cpitching\u201d involves demonstrating aggressive and confrontational behaviors [60]. This may risk women to attribute their nonconformity with aggressiveness when pitching their ideas as a lack of selfefficacy to succeed in pitch competitions, particularly in scenarios where the ideas are pitched to mostly men. In fact, researchers have examined the effect of entrepreneur\u2019s sex on pitch success and have found that investors preferred pitches from men over women despite the content of the pitch being same [61]. This calls for further examination of EEP pedagogy from a critical feminist lens [15] and the inherent biases associated with entrepreneurial practice.\nDriven by national calls [62], engineering education research has identified several effective evidence-based student-centered instructional practices and continues to increase their adoption in the classroom [63], [64], [65], [66]. While these efforts are important, researchers have noted the importance of consciously accounting for \u201cpower considerations\u201d when using student-centered practices [67]. In the context of presented findings, pitch competitions provide an example of how despite being student centered, it may not be the most conducive pedagogical approach for recruiting and engaging women in entrepreneurship programming. Thus, when selecting pedagogical and assessment approaches to entrepreneurship programming, EEP administrators and faculty must be cognizant of the power differential that may be inherently embedded in different entrepreneurial practices that they are adopting from when creating experiential learning environments."

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "While research focused on entrepreneurship education in engineering fields is beginning to emerge, the majority of these studies have focused on assessing learning outcomes. Instead of examining the impact of EEPs, the presented study looks backwards into the antecedents for creating inclusive EEPs. Engineering education studies strongly suggest that entrepreneurship education positively impacts students\u2019 learning and outcomes. These results and national calls for more entrepreneurial graduates reiterate that more students should be encouraged to participate in EEPs. The study findings contribute to building a better understanding of differences\nbetween men and women in regard with factors informing their participation in noncompulsory EEPs. It is noted that the study was conducted at a large, research university which offered a wide range of curricular and co-curricular entrepreneurship programming. Thus, the direct transferability of the findings to other institutional contexts should be applied with caution, particularly at relatively smaller institutions and/or those with limited EEP offerings. Nonetheless, the study findings provide timely implications informing the development of new or revisiting existing EEPs that may foster greater participation from women. With the continued growth of EEPs in engineering education, the study findings provide grounding for researchers to examine student participation in EEPs in other institutional contexts, and develop evidence-based implications that are transferable to wider institutional contexts and academic entrepreneurial ecosystems. Overall, the emergent findings reiterate that more theoretical and research attention should be devoted toward examining curricular, pedagogical, advising, and outreach aspects of entrepreneurship programming for engineering students."

            "heading": "V. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK",
            "text": "While the choice of qualitative methods in this exploratory work provides in-depth insights, the limitations of the presented study provides several avenues for future research and investigation. First, the study presented here was limited to 20 students at a large, research-focused institution, restricting the transferability of the findings to other institutional contexts. Future research can be conducted at different institutional and differing university entrepreneurial ecosystems. In addition, since the presented work was focused on only differences across men and women, future work can expand empirical knowledge to examine the unique perspectives of individuals who do not self-identify as men and women. Future research may examine differences in the factors across other demographics, such as race, nonbinary gender identities, socioeconomic status, and engineering major. Although it is obvious that students from different backgrounds will differ in their reasons for participation in EEPs, engineering education studies focused on such examinations are scarce. Research in this area will provide empirical suggestions for designing entrepreneurship programs inclusive and equitable to diverse student populations. Second, from a theoretical standpoint, the findings identify one key area for further examination\u2014 the conceptualization and operationalization of entrepreneurial intent for EEPs. Particularly, future work can examine venture creation and nonventure creation aspects of entrepreneurial intent among engineering students. Finally, the findings underscore the necessity for future research examining the instructional and pedagogical aspects of EEPs. Possible directions include examining students\u2019 cognitive, affective and behavioral response to common EEP pedagogical practices (e.g., student incubators and pitch competitions) with particular emphasis on identifying differences and similarities across diverse student groups. In this research, contextual perspectives have the potential to reveal deeper insights as opposed to opposed to sole emphasis on individual differences [68]."
