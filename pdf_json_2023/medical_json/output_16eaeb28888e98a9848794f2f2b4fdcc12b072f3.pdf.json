    "abstractText": "In this study, an antibacterial and shape-memory chitosan cryogel with high blood absorption and fast recovery from non-compressible wounds was prepared using a one-step method. Herein, we prepared a shape-memory-reduced graphene/chitosan (rGO-CTS) cryogel using a onestep method with a frozen mixing solution of chitosan, citric acid, dopamine, and graphene oxide, before treating it with alkaline solutions. The alkaline solution not only promoted the double crosslinking of chitosan but also induced dopamine to form polydopamine-reducing graphene oxide. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed that the rGO-CTS cryogel possessed a uniform porous network structure, attributing excellent water-induced shape-memory properties. Moreover, the rGO-CTS cryogel exhibited good mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, and biocompatibility. In mouse liver trauma models, the rGO-CTS cryogel showed good blood clotting and hemostatic capabilities. Therefore, this composite cryogel has great potential as a new hemostatic material for application to non-compressible wounds.",

            "text": "Severe bleeding and infected wounds are key global issues that need to be addressed [1,2]. Uncontrolled hemorrhage caused by severe trauma is the main cause of shock and death. Meanwhile, the healing of infected bleeding wounds should not be underestimated as it may lead to serious problems, such as prolonged wound healing time, implant failure, and even death [3]. An ideal hemostatic agent must rapidly control massive hemorrhage, have antibacterial properties, and be biocompatible, lightweight, stable, easy-to-use, and inexpensive [4,5]. Current hemostatic agents, including cyanoacrylates, fibrin-based bandages, gelatin-based hemostatic agents, and zeolite-based QuickClot, have good hemostatic effects on superficial wounds but have limited effects on controlling deep incompressible bleeding. These hemostatic agents have drawbacks, such as poor adhesion to the wound surface, poor biocompatibility, and lack of effective antibacterial and healing effects [3,4]. To solve these issues, shape-memory materials have been developed that can rapidly stop bleeding and expand to fill and apply pressure to deep and non-compressible wounds. XStat TM, composed of miniature sponges, can fill and apply pressure to deep and noncompressible wounds. However, owing to its low biocompatibility and non-degradable feature, it requires significant time to remove sponges from the wound. Subsequently, shapememory cryogels with interconnected microporous structures have received extensive attention in biomedical applications. The special porous structure allows water to flow freely into or out of the cryogels. Thus, the cryogel shape can be controlled through compression to expel free water and change the cryogel shape and through absorbing water to restore its original shape. Hydrogels or cryogels usually show weak mechanical strength, which is due to their natural elements and microporous structure formed by a freeze-drying method used to remove ice crystals. To enhance their mechanical properties, Zhao et al. [4]\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1389. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021389 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1389 2 of 12\nintroduced carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into quaternized chitosan (QCS) and fabricated nanocomposite cryogels for wound dressing. The cryogels can take seconds to recover their shape and have good mechanical and hemostatic properties. However, CNTs are potentially cytotoxic. To further improve the performance of porous cryogels, Guo\u2019s group introduced polydopamine (PDA) into the QCS reaction system, where a multifunctional cryogel with tissue adhesion properties was prepared for rapid non-compressed wound hemostasis and healing [6]. Similarly, Cao and co-workers recently reported that a shape-memory cryogel based on QCS and bioactive glass could be used for rapid hemostasis and wound healing [7]. Therefore, the construction of biocompatible, high-strength, and easy-to-use shape-memory cryogel hemostatic agents has promising prospects for clinical application. Graphene oxide (GO), one of the important derivatives of graphene, has attracted much attention in recent years. It has been regarded as an effective reinforcement for chitosan films [8]. Furthermore, PDA-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was chosen to strengthen chitosan hydrogel with a fast self-healing ability, and attributed to good adhesiveness and enhanced biodegradability [9]. We previously reported the preparation of improved strength chitosan (CTS) hydrogels using the green natural crosslinking agent citric acid [10]. Therefore, the CTS cryogel formed by the crosslinking of citric acid and PDA rGO will have excellent biomechanical and biochemical functions. In this work, shape-memory-reduced graphene/chitosan (rGO-CTS) cryogels based on frozen-alkali treatment were prepared using a one-step method. In the one-step method, chitosan, citric acid, dopamine, and GO were evenly mixed, frozen, and soaked in an alkaline solution, where the alkaline solution induced sodium citrate to cross-link CTS and dopamine to form PDA-reducing GO. The obtained shape-memory cryogel exhibited excellent mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, and biocompatibility. In mouse liver trauma models, it also showed good blood-clotting ability and higher blood cell adhesion. These results indicate that these cryogels have great potential as non-compressible hemorrhage hemostasis dressings and wound healing materials (Figure 1).\nInt. J. Mol.

Preparation and Characteristics of the rGO-CTS Cryogel\nThe surface morphologies of the CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogels were investigated using SEM. These cryogels had a porous network texture structure, and the rGO-\nCTS cryogel showed a flabbier structure with a three-dimensional network (Figure 2A).

The liquid state can be characterized by both viscosity and elasticity in rheology [11].

The liquid state can be characterized by both viscosity and elasticity in rheology [11]. As shown in Figure 2D, G\u201d was always higher than G\u2032, indicating that the viscosity of the solution was higher than the elasticity. There was no breakpoint in the entire process; therefore, the solution was uniform and stable. The water uptake behavior of the cryogels is shown in Figure 2C. All cryogels contained a remarkable amount of water because of the hydrophilic nature of the main polymers. The swelling ratio of the CTS cryogel was 2012.51%, which was the highest among all cryogels and could be attributed to it having the highest pore area. The swelling ratios of GO-CTS and rGO-CTS were 1721.05% and 1554.56%, respectively (Figure 2E). Because GO plates are a physical network agent, the resistance against liquid penetration increased, and adding GO decreased the swelling behavior of the CTS cryogels. However, compared\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1389 4 of 12\nwith the addition of rGO to CTS cryogels, adding GO considerably boosted the swelling behavior, owing to the existence of hydrophilic functional groups (COOH and OH). Some studies have reported that wound dressings with 100\u2013900% capacity are the best [12]. However, the swelling ratios of the CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogels reached more than 1500%, showing excellent water uptake behavior. As shown in Figure 2F, the strain of the three cryogels could still be restored to the initial state after cyclic compressive tests, which indicated that all cryogels had good compression elasticity and stable cryogel networks. Interestingly, the compression performance of the rGOCTS cryogel was superior to those of the CTS and GO-CTS cryogels. The Young\u2019s moduli of the CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogels were determined to further analyze the mechanical properties of the cryogels (Figure 2G). Compared with the CTS cryogel, the Young\u2019s moduli of the GO-CTS and rGO-CTS cryogels showed 1.59- and 2.22-fold increases, respectively. These results suggest that the introduction of dopamine-reduced graphene oxide (pGO) could improve the mechanical properties of the CTS cryogel. Moreover, the rGO-CTS cryogel did not exert severe pressure or additional damage to the wound during application."

The shape-fixed state of the CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogels was easily obtained by squeezing and absorbing water. The cryogels immediately recovered to their original state in less than 4 s by absorbing water after they were compressed to 40% (Video S1). The cryogels were cut into the same rectangles and then folded into complex shapes, such as N, T, and U shapes. By absorbing water, they were able to recover their state in less than 50 s (Figure 3). The shape fixity rate (RSf) and shape recovery ratio (RSr) of the rGO-CTS cryogel were both 100%. Whether it was a simple recovery or a more complex recovery, the recovery time of cryogels was very short and shorter than that of the chitosan/graphene oxide-based multifunctional pH-responsive hydrogel [14]. These results illustrate that the cryogels have excellent water-triggered shape-memory performance and a high recovery speed. The shape-memory capability was attributed to the reversible collapse of the pores in the cryogel matrix. The microporous structure allowed water to flow out/in freely, which possessed high polarity to absorb water and good resilience for shape recovery [15]. When the cryogels were compressed, water from the interconnected pores flowed out, and the cryogel structure collapsed. After removing the compressive stress, the stored elastic energy was released, and the cryogels exhibited a shape-fixed state. Then, the shape-fixed cryogels reabsorbed water and immediately recovered their shape and structure [4]. Therefore, the rGO-CTS cryogel possessed excellent water-triggered shape-memory capability and presented huge potential as a hemostatic agent for hemostasis applications. Int. J. Mol.

According to the above theory, the blood clotting performance of cryogels was assessed using a dynamic whole-blood clotting test [4,13]. As shown in Figure 4A, the rGO-CTS cryogel presented a lower blood-clotting index (BCI) than the CTS and GO-CTS cryogels at each time point (p < 0.05). These results illustrate that the three cryogels had effective blood-clotting capability, and the introduction of rGO further enhanced bloodingclotting capability. To investigate the hemostatic mechanism of the cryogels, SEM was employed to observe the surface adhesion and morphology of the blood cells on these cryogels (Figure 4B). It was found that many blood cells adhered to the three cryogels and the blood cells showed irregularly formed aggregates. Electrostatic interactions between positively charged CTS and negatively charged erythrocyte membranes cause erythrocyte agglutination and hemostasis through tissue adhesion to seal the wound [16]. Owing to the interconnected porous structure and good expansion ratio of these cryogels, they can absorb considerable amounts of blood through rapid blood absorption and blood concentration and can enhance the absorption capability of blood cells [17]. Compared to the CTS and GO-CTS cryogels, rGO-CTS had a more porous structure. Therefore, the rGO-CTS cryogel had relatively good clotting ability and great potential as a cryogel hemostatic agent in hemostatic applications. Int. J. Mol.

The CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogels showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), representing Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively (Figure 5A,B). The OD values of the three cryogels against E. coli and S. aureus were approximately 0.05, demonstrating that the cryogels had the same inhibitory effect on E. coli and S. aureus. SEM was used to examine the morphology of E. coli and S. aureus on the three cryogels to further evaluate their antibacterial activity (Figure 5C). After incubation for 12 h, the E. coli was longer than the normal size, and the S. aureus changed from its original spherical shape to a long strip shape similar to that of E. coli. We hypothesized that this may be due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the rGO functional group and the bacterial membrane, which has an affinity effect. In addition, the sharp edges of rGO can rupture the bacterial membrane [19]. These results indicate that the cryogels could destroy the structure of E. coli and S. aureus to inhibit their growth and possess excellent antibacterial activity. Int. J. Mol.

It was found that the cells adhered and diffused well to the cryogels, which led to the filling of the pores and reduction in the space of the cryogels. To evaluate the cell viability of the three cryogels, a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) test was conducted after one week of application of the cryogels (Figure 6B). Compared with the control group, the cell viability of the GO-CTS and rGO-CTS cryogels decreased after 1 d owing to the introduction of GO. However, there was no significant difference in the proliferation cells in contact with the three cryogels and the control group on days 4 and 7, indicating that the three cryogels had no obvious cytotoxicity.

In Vivo Hemostatic Capacity of the rGO-CTS Cryogel\nIn the mouse liver trauma model (Figure 7A), the hemostatic performance of the cry-\nogels in vivo was further evaluated by measuring the amount of bleeding and hemostatic\ntime. A cylindrical wound made on the mouse liver was used as the non-compressible\nwound model, and medical gauze was used as the control. As shown in Figure 7B,C, the\nblank (not-treated) group had the highest blood loss (155.33 mg) among all groups. Com-\npared with the blank group, blood loss in all treatment groups decreased to varying de-\ngrees. The blood loss in the gauze group was the highest in the treatment group, and the\nblood loss in the gauze group decreased from 155.33 mg to 111.67 mg. These results indi-\ncate that medical gauze has little hemostatic effect on narrow, deep, and non-compressible\nbleeding. However, when CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO CTS cryogels were inserted into the\nbleeding site, they rapidly absorbed blood and expanded their volume to completely fill\nthe wound site. The blood losses in the CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogel groups were\n71.67, 47.33, and 22.67 mg, respectively. The results regarding hemostatic time showed the\nsame trend as in blood loss. The hemostatic time in the three cryogel groups was signifi-\ncantly shorter than that of the gauze, and the rGO-CTS cryogel was as short as 8.3 s. Here,\nwe compared the hemostatic times of different hemostatic materials based on CTS. Huang\net al. [20] prepared a high-strength composite cryogel hemostatic agent based on poly\n(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), and dopamine (DA), which\nshowed a hemostatic time of 2 min. The hemostasis time of the cryogel based on CNT and\nQCS prepared by Zhao et al. [4] was 78 s. Guo et al. prepared a QCS/PDA2.0 cryogel based\non QCS and PDA with a hemostatic time of 21 s [6]. In contrast, the rGO-CTS cryogel\nprepared in this study had the shortest hemostatic time of 8.3 s. The CTS can interact with\nred blood cells and platelets and accelerate their adhesion and aggregation. CTS further\nenhances blood clot formation by combining almost all plasma proteins and important\nclotting factors to produce a series of biochemical reactions in vivo [21]. Therefore, the\nthree cryogels exhibited good hemostatic properties for non-compressible wounds. In ad-\ndition, the rGO-CTS cryogel had the smallest pore size and the highest blood-sucking\nability, which can promote hemostasis.

            "text": "The hemostatic ability of the cryogels was assessed using a mouse liver trauma model. Female mice (6 weeks old, 25\u201332 g) were obtained from the animal center of Nantong University and randomly and equally divided into five groups. Before hemostasis, the cryogels were cut into cylindrical shapes (\u03a6 3 mm) and compressed into a shrunken shape by extruding water. After anesthesia, the livers of the mice were exposed through an abdominal incision and the serous fluid around the liver was carefully removed. A cylindrical wound (\u03a6 3 mm) made on the mouse liver was used as the non-compressible wound model. Gauze, CTS, GO-CTS, and rGO-CTS cryogels were immediately applied to the bleeding site. Untreated wounds were used as the plank group, and each group consisted of three mice. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nantong University."

            "text": "In summary, a shape-memory rGO-CTS cryogel was fabricated based on CTS, citric acid, dopamine, and GO using a one-step frozen-alkali treatment. The alkaline solution not only promoted double cross-linking of CTS but also induced dopamine to form PDAreducing GO. The cryogel exhibited water-induced shape-memory properties. Regardless of whether its shape was simple or complex, it could be restored to its original state in less than 50 s after immersion in water, and the fixity ratio and recovery rate were 100%. According to the results of SEM and mechanical tests, the rGO-CTS cryogel presented a\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1389 11 of 12\nuniform porous network structure and good shape recovery function. In addition, the rGO-CTS cryogel destroyed the structures of E. coli and S. aureus to inhibit their growth and possessed excellent antibacterial activity. The hemolysis rate of the rGO-CTS cryogel was less than 2% in vitro, indicating that it is a safe non-hemolytic material. In a mouse model of liver injury, the rGO-CTS cryogel rapidly absorbed blood, expanded its volume, and completely filled the wound. The hemostasis time was reduced to 8.3 s, and the blood loss was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Owing to its good clotting ability and high blood cell adhesion, the rGO-CTS cryogel can be used for wound treatment.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24021389/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, investigations, writing\u2014original draft, writing\u2014review and editing, H.X.; methodology, investigation; writing\u2014original draft, Q.D.; methodology, investigation, R.L., X.S. and J.Z.; supervision, methodology, investigation, B.L.; supervision, data curation, writing\u2014review and editing, Y.J.; supervision, project administration, resources, data curation, visualization, writing\u2014review and editing, H.Y.
