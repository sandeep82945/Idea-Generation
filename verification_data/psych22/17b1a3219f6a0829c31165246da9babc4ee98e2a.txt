"limitations and future studies Regardless of the positive findings, some limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, as the use of self-assessment questionnaires and online assessments could have some effect on the reliability and validity of the assessments. For instance, it is widely observed that self-report attitudes or abilities generally correlate positively with one another (Podsakoff et al., 2012). Therefore, objective measurements and indicators could be considered in future studies to prevent this potential method bias. Second, a convenience sample from only two schools was used, which may have affected the representativeness; therefore, future studies should draw from a larger and more random sample. Third, as trait EI is widely observed to correlate strongly with more general personality traits (Gannon & Ranzijn, 2005; van der Linden et al., 2017, 2018), the potential influence of personality factors should be ruled out (Podsakoff et al., 2012). Thus, it would be a good direction for future research to see if our results can be replicated when ratings of EI and/ or friendship quality are gathered from peers instead of all self-reported. Fourth, it could be the case that greater friendship support helps foster greater self-perceptions of EI, so future research is necessary to explore the predictive relationship between them. Lastly, although measured at different points in time, both the independent, mediating and dependent variables in this study were measured only once, which limited the ability to unravel the developmental changes in adolescentsâ€™ positive outcomes over time. Future studies need to use a cross-lagged panel design to analyze longitudinal data measured at two or more time points to fully delineate the causal relationship between EI and life satisfaction."
