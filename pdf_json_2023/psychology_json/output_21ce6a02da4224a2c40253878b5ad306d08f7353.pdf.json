    "abstractText": "The aqueous decoctions of Vernonia amygdalina (VA) leaves and roots are widely used in traditional African medicine as an antidiabetic remedy. The amount of luteolin and vernodalol in leaf and root extracts was detected, and their role was studied regarding \u03b1-glucosidase activity, bovine serum albumin glycation (BSA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and cell viability, together with in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Vernodalol did not affect \u03b1-glucosidase activity, whereas luteolin did. Furthermore, luteolin inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas vernodalol did not reduce it. Additionally, luteolin exhibited high antiradical activity, while vernodalol demonstrated a lower scavenger effect, although similar to that of ascorbic acid. Both luteolin and vernodalol inhibited HT-29 cell viability, showing a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 22.2 \u03bcM (\u2212Log IC50 = 4.65 \u00b1 0.05) and 5.7 \u03bcM (\u2212Log IC50 = 5.24 \u00b1 0.16), respectively. Finally, an in silico ADMET study showed that both compounds are suitable candidates as drugs, with appropriate pharmacokinetics. This research underlines for the first time the greater presence of vernodalol in VA roots compared to leaves, while luteolin is prevalent in the latter, suggesting that the former could be used as a natural source of vernodalol. Consequently, root extracts could be proposed for vernodalol-dependent antiproliferative activity, while leaf extracts could be suggested for luteolin-dependent effects, such as antioxidant and antidiabetic effects.",

The serious impairments associated with DM and its constant increase in the world drive researchers to pursue new antidiabetic agents, also of natural origin, expecting cheaper and safer drugs. Plant-derived medicines have always played an important role in the culture and health traditions of the world population, and are still of great interest [2]. Vernonia amygdalina Del. (Asteraceae), also known as \u2018bitter leaf\u2019 or \u2018ndol\u00e9\u2019 due to the bitter taste of the leaves, is an African and Asian medicinal plant well known for its use in traditional medicine in various diseases, including wound healing, malaria, hypertension, and DM [3\u20135]. Ethanol and aqueous Vernonia amygdalina (VA) extracts and their in vitro activity were studied as potential agents capable of counteracting hyperglycemia and the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), showing their activity against \u03b1-glucosidase activity and AGEs [6]. Furthermore, other authors have reported antidiabetic effects in diabetic rat models [7\u201313]. In addition to the\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1541. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15051541 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1541 2 of 14\nuse of VA leaves in African folk medicine, leaf preparations are also marketed as food supplements. Recently, authors have suggested its use in the preparation of beverages such as non-alcoholic wheat beers, using a different percentage of bitter leaf, suggesting VA as a dietary intervention for the treatment of DM [14]. Studies have revealed the presence in VA tissues of several phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, saponins, and steroid glycosides [6,15,16]. Although flavonoids are common compounds in many types of plants, which are also used for food, terpene-derived compounds are less documented. Therefore, the current study focused on the study of two representative compounds of VA, the flavonoid luteolin and the terpene vernodalol (Figure 1), assuming these to be characteristic phytoconstituents of leaf and root extracts [6].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\nhave reported antidiabetic effects in diabetic rat models [7\u201313].

Therefore, the current study focused on the study of two representative compounds of VA, the flavonoid luteolin and the terpene vernodalol (Figure 1), assuming these to be characteristic phytoconstituents of leaf and root extracts [6].\nLuteolin is a yellow flavonoid well-known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential anticancer activities [17\u201319]. Luteolin is very common in fruits and vegetables for food use, but it is also found in many medicinal plants, among those VA [6,16,20]. Luteolin has anti-inflammatory (through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2, MAPK, JNK, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) and antioxidant (reducing reactive species and increasing endogenous antioxidants) activities [19]. Luteolin might preserve intestinal epithelial barrier function through the suppression of the STAT3 signaling pathway by protein phosphoserine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) [21]. Several studies also show its potential role as an anticancer agent, although no approved indications are recognized [22,23]. Furthermore, its use as a hypoglycemic agent in DM was suggested in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models [20,24].\nVernodalol is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the roots and leaves of VA and other Vernonia species [6,25\u201327], and also from the seeds of Chenopodium anthelminticum and Distephanus angulifolius [28]. It shows several activities, including antileishmaniasis, insecticidal, and antimicrobial properties against bacteria and fungi [5,29\u201331]. Furthermore, antiproliferative activity has been reported in various cell lines, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), by inducing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and causing cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase [32], and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells, by enhancing apoptosis induced with TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) related apoptosis-inducing ligand) [25]. Recently, in silico studies of various sesquiterpene lactones, including vernodalol, on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) showed their potential anticancer activity [33]. Recently, Sinisi et al. showed that vernodalol is an activator of Nrf2 (erythroid-2 nuclear transcription factor, EC50 = 3.2 \u00b5M), which increases the expression of the antioxidant response element-dependent gene (ARE) and therefore counteracts oxidative stress [26]. Furthermore, vernodalol inhibits STAT3/NF-\u03baB pathways that suppress inflammatory damage [26].\nLuteolin is a yellow flavonoid well-known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential anticancer activities [17\u201319].

Recently, various authors have indicated that there are several hundreds of experimentally proven medicinal plants with antidiabetic properties, but the complete mechanism has been investigated for only a hundred of them [34,35]. An ongoing challenge is to deepen the knowledge about the various mechanisms by which the antidiabetic activity of traditional herbal remedies is exploited, and, in this context, attention was specifically focused on VA.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1541 3 of 14\nIn this research, vernodalol and luteolin are proposed as reference compounds of VA extracts and, for this, were quantified in leaf and root extracts. Therefore, both compounds were tested for their antioxidant, anti-\u03b1-glucosidase and antiglycant activities, and for their influence on HT-29 cell viability. Furthermore, in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) parameters of luteolin and vernodalol were evaluated. According to the purpose of this investigation, the assays considered were selected from the documented and available ones. It was not a screening approach, but a targeted investigation of the main mechanisms to explain the antidiabetic properties attributed to VA, to rationalize the traditional use and pose the basis for possible drug development."

            "text": "In a previous in vitro investigation, ethanol and aqueous extracts of VA leaves were studied for their potential use in DM, highlighting their ability to reduce BSA glycation and \u03b1-glucosidase activity [6]. In the current research, the quantification of luteolin and vernodalol in the extracts was determined to define the role of the two compounds in plant activity, since luteolin and vernodalol can be defined as reference compounds for VA extracts. Their identification and quantification in three types of leaf extracts, i.e., macerate aqueous leaf extract (AquLE), Soxhlet aqueous leaf extract (SoxLE), and macerate ethanol leaf extract (EthLE), and three root extracts, i.e., macerate aqueous root extract (AquRE), Soxhlet aqueous root extract (SoxRE), and macerate ethanolic root extract (EthRE), were determined with HPLC analysis using the calibration lines obtained with the standards, repeating the analysis four times. Figure 2 shows illustrative chromatograms of vernodalol characterization in root extracts. EthLE and SoxLE have the highest amount of luteolin, respectively, equal to 0.54 \u00b1 0.04 mg/g and 0.49 \u00b1 0.04 mg/g, compared to AquLE equal to 0.21 \u00b1 0.01 mg/g (Figure 3). On the other hand, the amount of luteolin in the root extracts was not measurable. Otherwise, the HPLC analysis performed on the root extracts of VA allowed one to highlight an elevated presence of vernodalol. The highest amount of the sesquiterpene was detected in EthRE, with a value of 336.79 \u00b1 15.60 mg/g, compared to SoxRE (176.58 \u00b1 11.49 mg/g) and AquRE (47.81 \u00b1 0.70 mg/g); see Figure 3. Otherwise, the amount of vernodalol in the leaf extracts was not quantifiable. In particular, the HPLC analysis demonstrated that the amount of compound extracted varies with the extraction method, providing useful information for the optimal management of raw materials designated for medicinal herbal use. The data obtained also confirm previous research, which detected the presence of luteolin in extracts of AV leaves, supporting the VA antioxidant and cardioprotective effects [6,45,46].

Therefore, glycation was studied using BSA with three different sugars, such as ribose, fructose, and glucose, incubated for 7 days (ribose) or 14 days (fructose and glucose). Luteolin and vernodalol were tested as inhibitors in a concentration range of 10 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M (Figure 6). The glycation obtained with ribose and fructose and glucose showed different kinetics in AGE formation over time (Figure S1). According to the literature, ribose was found to be the most potent and efficient glycation agent, since fructose induced a lower BSA glycation compared to ribose, even higher than that of glucose. Luteolin inhibited the glycation of BSA induced by ribose, fructose, and glucose in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6). The IC50 values were 58 \u00b5M (\u2212Log IC50 = 4.24 \u00b1 0.02), 19.6 \u00b5M (\u2212Log IC50 = 4.71 \u00b1 0.04), and 40.4 (\u2212Log IC50 = 4.39 \u00b1 0.05), respectively. These results are consistent with the findings of Wu et al. who showed for luteolin an IC50 of 16 \u00b5M in glucose-induced BSA glycation [52]. Similarly, Muramatsu et al. reported an IC50 of 19.55 \u00b5M in glucose-induced human serum albumin glycation [53]. Thus, the current results consolidate previous data from the literature, showing the excellent antiglycation activity of luteolin. Otherwise, no studies have been conducted on the effect of vernodalol on glycation. In the present investigation, vernodalol did not inhibit AGE formation under any of the experimental conditions examined (Figure 6). Therefore, it can be deduced that the antiglycant effects previously reported with Vernonia amygdalina extracts could be attributed, at least in part, to the activity of luteolin and not to vernodalol [6].

Luteolin and vernodalol were investigated at concentrations of 0.35 \u00b5M to 35 \u00b5M to detect their influence on HT-29 cells. (Figure 7). Experimental data showed that vernodalol exhibited a higher inhibition of cell growth than luteolin. In detail, luteolin and vernodalol showed an IC50 of 22.2 \u00b5M (\u2212Log IC50 = 4.65 \u00b1 0.05) and 5.7 \u00b5M (\u2212Log IC50 = 5.24 \u00b1 0.16), respectively. Therefore, vernodalol was approximately four times more cytotoxic than luteolin in the HT-29 cell line. Other authors studied luteolin on the viability of several types of cell lines, for example Eca109, A549, SH-SY5Y, MG-63, and HL-60 cells, respectively, obtaining IC50 values of 70.7 \u00b5M, 40.2 \u00b5M, 27.1 \u00b5M, 34 \u00b5M, and 18.4 \u00b5M [55\u201359].

The in silico ADMET parameters evaluated suggest the favorable pharmacokinetics of luteolin and vernodalol, and also when they are derived from sources other than VA.

            "text": "The Vernonia genus, and particularly the Vernonia amygdalina species, has reached increasing popularity as a medicinal plant due to its traditional use as an antidiabetic treatment in Africa [15], where DM has increased rapidly as a public health problem [67]. VA was found in experimental animal models to suppress gluconeogenesis and potentiate glucose oxidation [13], emerging as a candidate for the further characterization of its medicinal role. In this regard, the ethnopharmacology process also aims to identify the most relevant chemical entities involved in a given pharmacological action, and the pharmacological investigation of new potential drugs today considers traditional medicinal plants as a very promising source [68], also recently confirmed by authoritative reviews [69]. Published studies have previously documented the presence of several bioactive compounds in VA, including flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, terpenes, and phenols [15]. The present research showed that aqueous and ethanol extracts of leaves and roots from VA contain significant amounts of luteolin and vernodalol, respectively, since the terpenoid vernodalol is the predominant compound in root extracts, while the flavonoid luteolin occurs primarily in leaf extracts. Therefore, luteolin and vernodalol can be proposed as reference compounds helpful in standardizing the medicinal preparations of VA. The study of the two isolated compounds showed that luteolin has a very high antiradical activity, about 7\u20138 times greater than the reference ascorbic acid, while vernodalol showed an effect comparable to that of ascorbic acid. Vernodalol did not inhibit the \u03b1-glucosidase activity and BSA glycation; conversely, luteolin induced an appreciable concentration-dependent inhibition of both \u03b1-glucosidase activity and BSA glycation. In detail, the IC50 of luteolin against \u03b1-glucosidase was 16.2 \u00b5M, while the IC50 values against ribose, fructose, and glucose-induced BSA glycation were 58.0 \u00b5M, 19.6 \u00b5M, and 40.4 \u00b5M, respectively. Therefore, the properties of luteolin support the use of VA in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in traditional medicine. The cytotoxicity of both compounds was evaluated regarding the viability of HT-29 cells, showing for luteolin and vernodalol IC50 values of 22.2 and 5.7 \u00b5M, respectively. Therefore, vernodalol was a more powerful inhibitor of HT-29 cell proliferation than\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1541 11 of 14\nluteolin. The in silico pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile suggest that both compounds can be suitable candidates as drugs, having adequate pharmacokinetic behaviors. This research indicates for the first time that vernodalol is the predominant constituent of VA root extracts compared to leaf extracts, suggesting that the roots of the plant could be used as a natural source of vernodalol. Consequently, root extracts could be proposed for vernodalol-dependent activities, such as antiproliferative activity, while leaf extracts could be proposed for luteolin (flavonoid)-dependent properties, such as antioxidant, antiglycant, and antihyperglycemic effects. The results validate the use of VA as a local resource in African and Asian regions, in line with WHO recognition of the use of herbal remedies for the treatment of DM [2]. In Africa, this plant is commonly considered a food [15,70], in addition to its medicinal properties. This provides additional relevance to support the use of VA, since it can provide nourishment and, at the same time, due to the properties investigated, act as a prevention of the progression of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes. Therefore, this plant could be included among functional foods or nutraceuticals, another important and current research field for diabetes prevention and management [71,72]. Additionally, these data, along with those available in the literature, support the development of luteolin as a potential pharmacological agent in the prevention and treatment of diseases related to hyperglycemia, as a consequence of its antioxidant and antidiabetic effects here demonstrated. Relevant clinical trials are required to validate its therapeutic use.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15051541/s1, Figure S1: Kinetics of BSA glycation obtained with three different glycating agents, such as ribose, fructose, and glucose.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.F. and F.M.D.; methodology, G.F.; software, G.F. and F.M.D.; investigation, F.M.D., V.S. and E.P.; resources G.F. and E.R.; writing, G.F. and E.R.; funding acquisition, G.F. and E.R.
