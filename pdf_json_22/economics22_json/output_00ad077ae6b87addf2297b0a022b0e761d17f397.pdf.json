At present, China\u2019s environmental pollution problem is becoming increasingly serious, which not only hinders sustainable economic and social development, but also poses a major threat to public health. Therefore, based on the carbon emissions trading policy implemented in China, this paper explores this policy\u2019s impact on residents\u2019 health using the DIDmodel and illustrates the moderating e ect of environmental pollution. The results show that (1) carbon emissions trading policies can promote the improvement of residents\u2019 health; (2) the e ect is stronger for western regions and provinces with smaller population sizes after taking control variables into consideration; and (3) environmental pollution has a significant moderating e ect on the relationship between carbon emissions trading and residents\u2019 health. This research serves as an important reference for expanding the scope of the policy pilot, reducing pollutant emissions, and improving the health of the population.\nKEYWORDS\ncarbon emission trading policy, residents\u2019 health, environmental pollution, DID, the moderation e ect, China\nIntroduction\nThe theme of theHealthy China Strategy is \u201cJoint Construction and Sharing, National Health.\u201d Although China\u2019s reform and opening up has achieved rapid economic take-off, it has also brought about serious ecological damage and environmental pollution, and various diseases caused by environmental degradation have seriously hindered the health of the Chinese population. Health is the livelihood issue most directly and closely related to people\u2019s real interests. Only by keeping healthy can residents actively participate in production activities and create greater value. Faced with increasingly serious environmental pollution, China has formulated various environmental regulation\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org\npolicies and tried to build a benign and sustainable energy ecosystem by promoting low-carbon production and consumption in pilot provinces, with the aim of achieving the goal of \u201cHealthy China\u201d as quickly as possible. Therefore, exploring the intrinsic relationship between carbon emissions trading policies and residents\u2019 health, and studying how pilot policies can improve residents\u2019 health by reducing environmental pollution, is beneficial to highlighting the importance of environmental regulation implementation and achieving the goal of \u201cHealthy China.\u201d\nSo far, the existing literature has focused on the effects of environmental pollution on residents\u2019 health and the effects of environmental regulations on infant mortality, laying the foundation for us to explore the effects of environmental regulations on residents\u2019 health. However, there are still the following gaps in the literature: First, most studies on residents\u2019 health have been conducted through questionnaires to obtain self-assessed health data or have used mortality rates as a proxy for residents\u2019 health indices, with the former being more subjective and the latter potentially having biased findings. Second, there are limited studies on the health effects of environmental regulations in China, especially a lack of studies on market-incentivized regulatory policies. In addition, few studies have analyzed their impact paths, leading to a lack of understanding of the impact mechanisms and health benefits of environmental regulations.\nTherefore, the innovation of this paper is mainly reflected in the following three aspects: First, the indicator design is innovative. Referring to the WHO\u2019s definition of health, five indicators are selected, and the Topsis method of panel data is used to measure the health level of residents, which objectively reflects the health status of residents in 31 Chinese provinces and cities. Second, the research content is expanded and deepened in comparison with previous studies. From the perspective of health improvement and taking market-oriented environmental regulations as an example, this article analyzes the impact of China\u2019s carbon emissions trading policy on residents\u2019 health and provides references and suggestions for the construction of China\u2019s environmental regulation system. Third, this study offers a novel research perspective. Based on an economics perspective, this article combines front-line knowledge and methods of sociology and environmental science to analyze the impact of the interaction between environmental pollution and environmental regulations on residents\u2019 health within the context of and literature on regulatory effects, which enriches and expands existing research.\nLiterature review and research hypothesis\nResearch on population health can be traced back to 1972, when Grossman introduced the utility function of health into\nBecker\u2019s household production function and constructed a model of the demand for health capital. The introduction of this function formally opened up research on and exploration of human health. Deng et al. (1) found that adult training had a small positive impact on resident autonomy and a negative impact on resident wellness through a REDCap questionnaire. Ahn et al. (2) believed that long working hours and job-related stress can worsen the health status of residents. Raynor et al. (3) found higher incidence of mental health deterioration in people who were exposed to a COVID-19 shock. Aeschbach et al. (4) selected an active control group for a longitudinal randomized controlled trial and concluded that a tailored MBP may improve certain aspects of resident physicians\u2019 positive mental health. Shepley et al. (5) asserted that environmental quality and characteristics can impact both the mental and behavioral health of psychiatric patients. Ke and Chen (6) based on the Health Belief Model, found that residents are living healthier lifestyles after the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China. Fitzpatrick et al. (7) showed that aboriginal health and mental health problems were more severe in the wake of 2016 Horse River Wildfire in Northern Alberta, Canada. Li et al. (8) claimed that participating in physical exercise can significantly improve the subjective and objective health level of individuals.\nSince the industrial revolution, with the progress of society and the development of science and technology, the level of industrialization has been increasing and humanity\u2019s ability to exploit natural resources has been rising. As a result, humans have acquired great wealth, but this has come at the price of destroying the natural ecological environment. The decline in environmental quality has caused deterioration of the human living environment, which not only reduces human immunity, but also increases the prevalence of respiratory diseases and the rate of babies suffering congenital defects or health issues, which has a negative impact on human health. For example, the Great Smog of 1952 in London, Photochemical Smog Episode in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1960, Minamata disease incident in Japan in 1956, and Itai-itai Disease in Japan in 1931 have all had demonstrable negative impacts on human health.\nMany studies have confirmed that environmental pollution reduces the health status of the population. Qiu et al. (9) found that short-term exposure to elevated concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 were significantly associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions for psychiatric disorders among the US Medicare population. Mallongi et al. (10) believed that air pollution not only has a direct impact on human health, but also can damage the environment. Reginold Raja and Antony Selvi (11) argued that environmental pollution, especially land, air, and water pollution, can harm people\u2019s health and exacerbate social problems related to environmental pollution. Sekmoudi et al. (12) showed that long-term exposure to exceedance levels of particulate matter elevated humans\u2019 morbidity and mortality. Nwani et al. (13) found that environmental pollution as proxied by per capita CO2 emissions has a negative and\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nsignificant effect on health outcomes in Nigeria. Orru (14) mostly focused on mortality, calculated the health effects of future ozone and particulate matter concentrations under various climate scenarios.\nIn addition to direct effects, some scholars believe that there are also spillover effects of environmental pollution on residents\u2019 health. The First Law of Geography states that correlations between geographic phenomena or attributes are common, and correlations are related to geographic distance; in general, the closer the distance, the greater the correlation, and the farther the distance, the greater the variability Tobler (15). Chen et al. (16) suggested that there is a spatial spillover effect of air pollution on public health, i.e., the health of residents in a certain area is not only affected by local air pollution, but also by air pollution in neighboring areas. This spillover effect of pollution on health was verified in studies by Wang (17), Feng et al. (18), and Song and Cui (19).\nTo reduce the impact of environmental pollution on a population\u2019s health, some countries have formulated environmental regulations guided by the externality theory and attempted to limit pollutant emissions through administrative orders. Chay and Greenstone (20) found that the US Clean Air Act implemented in 1970 reduced total suspended particulate concentrations and thereby effectively reduced infant mortality; Luechinger (21) found that the German Desulfurization Policy significantly reduced SO2 concentrations and infant mortality, and Greenstone and Hanna (22) found that India\u2019s Catalytic Converter Policy significantly reduced SO2 and NO2 concentrations and thus contributed to a small reduction in infant mortality. McGartland et al. (23) estimated the health benefits of environmental regulations and concluded that reductions in various environmental pollutants can have a beneficial effect on non-cancer health. Tang et al. (24) came to the conclusion that environmental regulations have a significant co-benefit on high-quality environmental development and public health. However, some studies have also concluded that the policy effects of environmental regulation are limited. Zheng et al. (25) found that China\u2019s Air Pollution Control Law implemented in 2013 has reduced the population formaldehyde PM2.5 concentration, but themortality rate showed a non-linear corresponding trend.\nBased on the above analysis, this paper proposes the following hypothesis: environmental regulation can promote the improvement of residents\u2019 health. Environmental pollution has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between environmental regulation and residents\u2019 health.\nData sources, variables, and models"

In this paper, the occurrence of diseases among the population is used as a proxy variable for the population\u2019s health: the higher the occurrence, the lower the population\u2019s health level. Based on the World Health Organization\u2019s definition of human health, this paper constructs indicators formeasuring the health production function of residents according to the health production functionmodel, and uses the Topsis method of panel data to construct an indicator that can comprehensively measure resident health levels and any changes across different provinces and cities. In this paper, five indicators, namely number of health technicians, number of beds in medical and health institutions, pertussis infection rates, mortality, and average number of times a resident visits a hospital in each region over the study years are used to synthesize the indicator of disease occurrence. Here, the missing values are inferred by linear interpolation."

Some scholars have constructed an index system to synthesize a comprehensive index to characterize the intensity of environmental regulation, and some scholars have used environmental regulation policies implemented by a state/country as indicators of environmental regulation. In this paper, we adopt China\u2019s state-implemented carbon emission trading pilot policy as a proxy indicator of environmental regulation to judge the impact of environmental regulation policy on the health level of residents."

Studies have demonstrated that reductions in air pollution can reduce infant mortality Chay and Greenstone (20) and improvement of air quality will reduce the mortality rate of the elderly Cesur et al. (26), an effect primarily driven by reductions in cardiorespiratory deaths. The existing literature mostly uses a single indicator to measure environmental pollution, such as the integrated air pollution index Zhang et al. (27) and PM2.5 Bishop et al. (28). However, environmental pollution not only refers to air, but also involves water, soil, and other aspects, so it is one-sided to measure environmental pollution with a single indicator. In this paper, five indicators, namely chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen emission, sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxide emissions, and soot emissions in each region over the study years, are used to synthesize an indicator that can comprehensively represent the environmental pollution status through the Topsis method of panel data. Here, the missing values are inferred by linear interpolation."

If the confidence interval does not include 0, it is considered that there is a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group. If both sides of the confidence interval are <0, it indicates that the implementation of the policy has a negative effect on the occurrence of diseases and a positive effect on the health of the population, and if both ends of the confidence interval are >0, it indicates that the implementation of the policy has a negative effect on the occurrence of diseases and a positive effect on the health of the population."

(1) is a DID model without control variables, controlling only for area and time effects, and (2)\u2013(6) are the regression results of gradually including control variables on the basis of (1).\nAccording to Table 4, the estimated coefficients of the carbon emissions trading policy are negative with or without the inclusion of control variables, and they pass the 1% significance test.

That is, the implementation of the carbon emission trading pilot policy helps to improve the population\u2019s health.

To avoid endogeneity problem caused by sample selection bias, this paper further adopts the PSM-DID model to re-estimate the matched sample values by eliminating observations that do not satisfy the common area assumption based on the nearest-neighbor matching.\nAccording to the results of the equilibrium test for continuous variables, the absolute value of the standard deviation of the control variables after matching is <20%, indicating that the matching is effective; and the probability P of the T-value is much >10%, indicating that the propensity score matching is more effective. Table 5 reports the results of the DID model estimation for the carbon emissions trading policy after sample matching. According to Table 5, the results after controlling for year effects and provincial and municipal effects are generally consistent with the results of the main regression. The results show that the carbon emissions trading policy has a negative effect on occurrence of diseases; that is, the effect on residents\u2019 health is significantly positive, which is basically consistent with the results estimated by the DID method. Thus, the robustness of the main regression analysis in this paper, i.e., China\u2019s carbon trading policy has contributed to the improvement of the residents\u2019 health, is proven."

This finding gives rise to other questions, such as: Are the health effects still present in different areas? If so, are there significant differences between regions? To further study the regional heterogeneity of the pilot policy, this paper further divides the research sample into three regions, namely Eastern, Central, and Western, and explore the differences of impacts of the carbon emissions trading policy on residents\u2019 health in\ndifferent regions from the perspective of regional heterogeneity. The results are shown in Table 7.\nThe results show that without considering the control variables, the carbon emissions trading policy\u2019s effect on the occurrence of diseases is the largest in the east, second largest in the west, and the smallest in the central region. Thus, the carbon emissions trading policy has differing effects on the occurrence of diseases in different regions. Its effect on the health of residents in the east and west is significantly negative, while not significant in the central region. After considering urbanization level and other control variables, the policy\u2019s effect on residents\u2019 health is the largest in the west, second largest in the central region, and the smallest in the central region. The policy\u2019s effect on residents\u2019 health in the central and western regions is the most significant, and the effect in the eastern region is relatively weak. This is probably because the economic development level of the central and western regions is slightly lower than that of the eastern region. The central and western regions are in the primary stage of industrial structure transformation, and the scale of pollutant emissions in that process of industrial development is larger. Therefore, the carbon trading policy has a greater emission reduction effect and a stronger health enhancement effect on populations in those regions. In addition, most of the production sectors in the eastern region have been transferred to the central and western regions, and now the eastern region mainly focuses on the development of high-tech manufacturing and multifunctional manufacturing centers, so the effect of carbon emissions trading on the health of residents is limited."

The results show that (1) carbon emissions trading policies can promote the improvement of residents\u2019 health; (2) this improvement effect is heterogeneous among provinces and cities in different regions and with population sizes, and the effect is stronger for western regions and provinces with smaller population sizes after taking control variables into consideration; and (3) environmental pollution has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between carbon emissions trading and residents\u2019 health.\nIn view of the above conclusion and the actual situation in China, the following insights are obtained in this study and the following recommendations can be made: First, the scope of policy pilots should be expanded, and environmental regulation policies should be implemented. Research shows that the carbon emissions trading policy has a significant effect on the health of residents. Therefore, to reduce the incidence of diseases and improve the population\u2019s health, the scope of carbon emissions trading pilot projects can be expanded and regulation can be strengthened to reduce pollutant emissions and achieve a harmonious coexistence between human health and the natural environment. Second, the actual situation and local conditions should be considered. The impact of China\u2019s carbon emissions trading policy on the health of residents in different regions and provinces with different population sizes is heterogeneous. Thus, in the process of policy implementation, each region should consider its local conditions, combine the characteristics of the region\u2019s economic level, population size, and resource endowment to explore a low-carbon development path suitable for the region, and formulate a more scientific and reasonable carbon emissions trading policy. Third, publicity should be increased regarding the low-carbon concept and offering guidance for residents to live a low-carbon life. Environmental pollution, as a regulating variable, has a moderating effect on the relationship between residents\u2019 health and the carbon emissions trading policy. It is possible to provide low-carbon public goods and reasonable subsidies so that the low-carbon concept can be deeply rooted in people\u2019s hearts and thus improve residents\u2019 health.\nThere are still some limitations that could be explored in further research. On the one hand, this paper uses the occurrence of diseases as a proxy for population health rather than directly measuring residents\u2019 health levels. On the other hand, due to data limitations, the study in this paper is limited to\nthe provincial level, and as micro-entities of pollutant emission, the role of the carbon emission trading policy on the pollution emissions of enterprises should be noticed. We believe that future work will provide useful supplements in these aspects."
