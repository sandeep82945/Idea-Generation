    "abstractText": "HARMONI is the first light visible and near-IR integral field spectrograph for the ELT. It covers a large spectral range from 450nm to 2450nm with resolving powers from 3500 to 18000 and spatial sampling from 60mas to 4mas. It can operate in two Adaptive Optics modes SCAO (including a High Contrast capability) and LTAO or with NOAO. The project is preparing for Final Design Reviews. The AO wavefront sensor modules are assembled and tested in Marseille, requiring a large telescope simulator for realistic projection of various guide objects into the system. This is particularly challenging for the six laser guide stars, whose partially overlapping beams converge to a focus several meters behind the instrument entrance focus. To avoid building a well-corrected, meter-sized, optical system for this task, a single large lens is employed, associated with source modules individually equipped with spatial light modulators (SLM) capable both of simulating the atmosphere and the telescope's deformable mirror (M4) and of compensating the aberrations inherent to the simple simulator optics. In this paper, we present preliminary optical designs for the telescope simulator and the source units. We also describe prototype work, associated with theoretical analysis, to demonstrate the SLM's capabilities for generating sufficiently large aberrations.",

            "text": "HARMONI [1] is a visible and near-infrared integral field spectrograph providing the ELT\u2019s core spectroscopic capability. It will exploit the ELT\u2019s scientific niche in its early years, starting at first light. To get the full sensitivity and spatial resolution gain, HARMONI will work at diffraction limited scales. This will be possible thanks to two complementary adaptive optics systems [2], fully integrated within HARMONI. The first is a Single Conjugate AO (SCAO) system offering high performance for a limited sky coverage. The second is a Laser Tomographic AO (LTAO) system, providing AO correction with a very high sky-coverage. Both AO modes for HARMONI have gone through Preliminary Design Review at the end of 2017, and enter their Final Design phase starting in 2018 ending in 2023. As HARMONI will be assembled and tested at LAM, an incident beam is needed to make the instrument working. This will be achieved by a Telescope Simulator. It consists in an illuminating instrument simulating the presence of the ELT in front of HARMONI. Moreover this instrument has to simulate the atmospheric turbulence in order to test the AO mode of HARMONI. Therefore the Telescope Simulator is constrained to generate a beam with the same features than the emergent beam from the five mirrors of the ELT. This constraint imposes large dimensions to the design, but for economic reasons this design must be as simple as possible. This involves a design with a minimum number of lenses and mirrors. However the simplicity of this design causes strong optical aberrations in the emergent beam. As we generate voluntarily optical aberrations thanks to a liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulator (LCOS-SLM), we wonder if the SLM could correct at the same time the Telescope Simulator aberrations and the atmospheric perturbations. In this paper we present the Telescope Simulator design, and the tests on the SLM to conclude on its ability to correct such large optical aberrations.\nAdaptive Optics Systems VIII, edited by Laura Schreiber, Dirk Schmidt, Elise Vernet, Proc. of SPIE Vol. 12185, 121856E \u00b7 \u00a9 2022 SPIE\n0277-786X \u00b7 doi: 10.1117/12.2629301\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-1 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

            "text": "2.1. Test of HARMONI The telescope simulator (TelSim), see Fig. 1, will be placed in front of Harmoni for the tests of performance and operation of the instrument. The limited size of the integration hall imposes a constrained volume for the simulator.\nHARMONI will operate the Adaptive Optics mode thanks to the light of a natural and artificial stars. Natural guide stars (NGS) are conjugated to infinity and can be on or off axis, located within the patrol field of the NGS sensors system (NGSS [3]) of the instrument. Laser guide stars (LGS), sensed using the LGS sensors system (LGSS [4]), are artificial stars created by exciting the sodium layer located at an altitude of around 90 km and allowing HARMONI to observe in parts of the sky where natural stars are faint. HARMONI operates with up to two NGS and six LGS, located at a fixed asterism radius. The TelSim will provide two off-axis NGS as well as an on-axis star simulating a science object, and six LGS. Since the conjugation distance of the sodium layer varies with telescope pointing, a focus mechanism will be included to simulate telescope pointing. In the following, three cases of conjugation distances are considered, accounting for the telescope altitude and the thickness of the sodium layer: 70, 120 and 180 km.\n2.2. Zemax Telescope Simulator Design The ELT optical features are the starting point for the design of the Telescope Simulator. The main features we must consider are detailed in Table 1.\nIn order to respect the constraints concerning the volume, a single large lens ensures the optical conjugation with the focal plane at the entry of HARMONI. In addition, a large mirror allows folding the beam and limit the space needed to implement the Telescope Simulator. Only two more fairly small lenses are added before the mirror for the optical\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-2 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nconjugation of the sources. The LGS focus mechanism is implemented thanks to a lift, carrying all the laser sources. The design is implemented in Zemax, see Figure 2.\n2.3. Optical aberrations of the Telescope Simulator The first analysis of the Zemax design highlights the presence of very large optical aberrations. These optical aberrations were expected owing to the simplicity of the design and the size of the main lens. Consequently we decide to replace spherical lenses by aspherical one. This allowed to highly reduce the aberrations, but not all of them. The principal remaining aberrations are listed in Table 2.\nWe observe the main optical aberrations generated by this design, the coma, the astigmatism and the spherical aberration. As a case study for worst case aberrations to correct, we combine the worst optical aberration values for each configuration, shown in bold face in the table."

            "text": "The LCOS-SLM is an integral part of the source module of the Telescope Simulator. It allows to generate the wave front modulation which simulate the AO corrected atmospheric turbulences, so the phase modulation is a capital functionality of the process. Moreover we expect the SLM to correct the Telescope Simulator optical aberrations in addition to the turbulence. Therefore a good understanding of the SLM functioning in case of large phase amplitudes is fundamental. Then the objectives of our work are to define and understand the maximum optical aberration this technology is able to correct, and to understand if any the origin of these limits.\n3.1. SLM principle The LCOS-SLM, see Figure 3, aims to modulate the phase of a signal, as a deformable mirror does. But the SLM uses the property of birefringent crystals: their optical index for one polarization direction depends on the voltage input at their\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-3 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nterminal. The SLM is pixelated and each pixel is controlled in voltage. As a result we can control separately the phase values of every pixel.\nThis technology has great advantages in comparison to the deformable mirror:\n The high resolution: the SLM we use in the current study has 600x600 pixels, and a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels is currently available.\n The low price: a 1920x1080 pixel SLM costs around 15k\u20ac, whereas a 12x12 actuators deformable mirror is worth around 19k\u20ac.\nHowever, the SLM also has constraints:\n It works only for a linear polarization, defined by the orientation of the crystals.  The incident light must be monochromatic because of phase chromaticity.  The maximum optical phase shift is 2\u03c0: then phase wrapping is required for any phase variation exceeding \ud835\udf40.\nThe phase wrapping is a method for displaying on the SLM a pattern with a phase shift over \ud835\udf40. A pattern coding the phase in a pupil plane is an 8-bit array: each value of this array is included in [0,255] and the size of the array fits to the SLM resolution. The phase wrapping consists in calculating the modulus of the array pattern. This operation amounts to fold the phase between 0 and 255. The wave front coming out of the SLM is rebuilt thanks to the periodicity of the phase, in the same way as after a Fresnel lens, see Figure 4.\n3.2. SLM test bench The aim of this bench is to experiment the SLM's ability to generate large aberrations, which means aberrations with high local slopes. That is why the first observation we have done is an analysis of the tilt capacity of the SLM. For this purpose\nFigure 4. Illustration of phase wrapping with the SLM. A 16 \u03c0 Gaussian wavefront (left) and its phase wrapped version (right).\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-4 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nwe need a bench with a pupil plane to place the SLM, an intermediate focal plane for spatial filtering and a focal plane to place a camera for the PSF observation. Figure 5 presents the scheme of the test bench we have implemented.\nThe pixelated structure of the SLM generate a strong diffraction, see Fig. 6, hence the importance of the spatial filtering in order to stop the numerous orders.\n3.3. Tilt test For the first test we just want to observe the effect of an increasingly large tilt on the PSF. The experiment consists in putting an increasing tilt from 0 to 1000\ud835\udf40 on the SLM. Then the same process is achieved for a decreasing tilt from 0 to -1000 \ud835\udf40. We know that the SLM works for polarized light, and the 589 nm source we use is not polarized so only a part of the intensity will be affected by the tilt on the SLM. The expected result in the focal plane is a translation of the PSF from its initial position in the direction given by the gradient of the tilt pattern put on the SLM. Concerning the speed of the translation, it is given by the resolution of the\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-5 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nSLM. For the 600x600 pixels SLM we use, the tilt should have a periodic effect every 600\ud835\udf40 of tilt. Indeed for 600\ud835\udf40 of tilt, the slope on the pupil is 1\ud835\udf40/pixel. As a pixel is only 1\ud835\udf40 dynamic, the pattern is flat and corresponds to a 0\ud835\udf40 pattern. With the same reasoning, we know that a 600\ud835\udf40 tilt pattern corresponds to the case of a grating. Indeed for 300\ud835\udf40 of tilt, the slope on the pupil is 0.5\ud835\udf40/pixel. As a pixel is only 1\ud835\udf40 dynamic, the pattern is a succession of 0 and \u03c0 forming a binary grating. As the result we should observe diffraction orders on each side of the initial PSF, at the same distance and the same intensity. We expect to observe three different spots, see Figure 7:\n The static non-polarized PSF.  The polarized PSF coming out of the central order.  The polarized PSF coming out of the pixel diffraction first order.\nThe results of the experiment is shown in Fig. 8. This figure was created by 1) isolating the band of image pixels containing the diffraction spots, 2) summing the columns in this band, providing a one-dimensional array indicating the intensity of each spot, and 3) building a two-dimensional array of intensity versus tilt value. In addition to the slope crossing the central axis, materialized by the non-diffracted polarization, for zero and +/-600 \u03bb tilt, numerous diffraction spots are seen, forming a surprising variety of lines. Note that the spatial extent of the spot movements is limited by a spatial filter located in an intermediate focus.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-6 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\n3.4. Matlab simulation For a better understanding of these results, we made a Matlab simulation of the experiment. The idea is simply to simulate the propagation of light from the SLM to the focal plane. The Fourier optics allows to implement this simulation easily. Indeed the link between the pupil plane and the focal plane is a simple Fourier transform. Then the expression of the intensity in the camera plane is given by: where \u03d5 A.\ud835\udc52 . is the complex wavefront. We assume uniform amplitude, A=1. SLM phase pattern is denoted \ud835\udf53, the top hat pixel profile is denoted \u043fpixels,, and the comb function \u0428pixels denotes the SLM pixel grid. In this simulation, we take into account the structure of the SLM and the pixels shape. The SLM phase pattern can increase from a 0\ud835\udf40 tilt to 1000\ud835\udf40 tilt. The only difference between the simulation and the real experiment is the spatial filtering, which is not simulated. As a result, more pixel diffraction orders are observed. This allow us to have a wider sight of what happen with all these spots. We gathered all the information calculated by the simulation in Matlab in the same way that for the real experiment, see Fig. 9. We find again the 600 \u03bb periodicity, but in a totally symmetric scheme. These results are really comparable to the experimental results:\n The presence of numerous spots with various translation speed value (given by the slope of the lines), and various intensity evolution.\n The linear decreasing of the intensity of the first order coming from the initial PSF. Moreover the width of the observation in the focal plane is larger than the camera detectors or the lenses of the bench permit in the real experiment. This lets appear the pixels diffraction orders which are static (position independent of tilt value). But the significant observation on this figure is the multiplicity of orders out of the initial PSF. These orders move away from on each side of the central PSF, and are not due to pixels diffraction. They are generated by the variable diffraction grating resulting from the phase wrapping. Indeed a periodic shape appears on the SLM pattern because of phase wrapping and affect the signal like a blazed grating, see Fig. 10.\nI |TF \u03d5\u2297 \u043fpixels \u0428pixels |2\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-7 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nAs a result, there are two distinct diffractions. A static one due to the SLM pixels and a variable one due to the phase wrapping. Each static order of the pixel diffraction generates moving orders from the phase wrapping diffraction, see Fig. 11. This double diffraction explains the numerous orders and their different speeds: the higher the phase wrapping diffraction order, the faster it moves.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-8 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nThe phase wrapping also impacts the spot intensity. The edges of the wrapping are not vertical slopes as theoretically expected. This apparition of double slopes as the local tilt increases causes the decrease of the spots intensity.\n3.5. Analysis of the tilt experiment The experimental results are very interesting for several reasons:\n The presence of numerous spots with various translation speed value (given by the slope of the lines), and various intensity evolution.  The linear decreasing of the intensity of the first order coming from the initial PSF, see Fig. 12.  The variation of intensity of the non-polarized spot.\nThe main significant of these results in terms of the HARMONI TelSim is to allow us to evaluate the consequence of using the SLM to compensate the large aberrations of the simplified optical system shown in Fig. 2. Using a combination of the three main aberrations highlighted in Table 2, we can evaluate the maximum slope to an equivalent of 0.16 \u03bb/pixel in our 600-pixel diameter pupil. This corresponds to a linear slope of 97 \u03bb across the pupil, and as can be seen from Fig. 12, the remaining intensity is then 24% of the initial intensity."

Then we would be able to analyse the evolution of the quality of the PSF. The maximum local slope of the wavefront we want to correct is 0.16 \u03bb/pixel, which corresponds to 12 \u03bb of defocus. In this experiment we try to compensate up to 25 \u03bb defocus. The results presented in Figure 13 show both a decrease of intensity, and a widening of the spots. Both these effects are quantified in Fig. 14. As we saw in Fig.12, the stronger is the tilt, the more intensity decreases. For a focus, the local slope is a tilt increasing from the centre to the edges of pupil. For 12 \u03bb compensated focus, the lost intensity is 52% of the initial PSF, and the spot is 35% wider than the initial PSF. We can note that the refocused images are much cleaner than the tilt images with their multiple diffraction spots. Indeed, when the SLM is used to compensate aberrations, most of the spurious spots are uncorrected, contributing to diffuse background rather than sharp ghost images.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12185 121856E-10 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

            "heading": "4. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "We have presented the Telescope Simulator, its purpose and its optical design. The Telescope Simulator is crucial for the HARMONI tests at LAM. This simulator must accurately recreate the ELT output light with the atmospheric turbulence. Indeed, HARMONI works with Adaptive Optics, and the Telescope Simulator can simulate both natural guide stars and laser guide stars, the latter at different altitudes. The simplicity of the optical design of the TelSim - to respect the volume constraint and to reduce costs- generates large aberrations. We were wondering if the SLM used for creating the turbulences was able to introduce enough aberration to correct the Telescope Simulator aberrations. The early tests on the SLM revealed many more spots than expected, moving along the detector with different speeds and in different directions. The Matlab simulation made us understand the origin of all these spots. The simulation highlights the double diffraction due to the SLM: the first one is the pixel diffraction generating static orders, the second one the phase wrapping diffraction generating moving orders. The combination of these two diffractions produces the apparition of all these spots moving along the detector. However, these spots are significantly less intense than the main spot. The main spot loses 76% of its intensity for 97 \u03bb tilt, corresponding to the aimed slope value 0.16 \u03bb/pixel. But this target is very pessimistic, since it is only the maximum local value for the aberration gathering the strongest aberrations values of different configurations of the Telescope Simulator. This has been highlighted in the focus compensated tests on the SLM: for 12 \u03bb focus, corresponding to the aimed slope value 0.16 \u03bb/pixel, the intensity loss is no more 76% but 49%. The widening of the spot is due to other aberrations amplified by the transfer of the camera in the moving focal plane. The AO of HARMONI should be able to correct it. Finally, the SLM appears to be the efficient technology to play the key role of both turbulence simulator and aberration corrector."
