    "abstractText": "Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antidepressants used for the treatment of moderate to severe depressive disorder, personality disorders and various phobias. This class of antidepressants was created with improved margins of safety. However, genetic polymorphism may be responsible for the high variability in patients\u2019 responses to treatment, ranging from failure to delayed therapeutic responses to severe adverse effects of treatment. It is crucial that the appropriate amount of SSRI drugs is administered to ensure the optimum therapeutic efficacy and intervention to minimise severe and toxic effects in patients, which may be the result of accidental and deliberate cases of poisoning. Determining SSRI concentration in human fluids and the environment with high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, and at a low cost and real-time monitoring, is imperative. Electrochemical sensors with advanced functional materials have drawn the attention of researchers as a result of these advantages over conventional techniques. This review article aims to present functional materials such as polymers, carbon nanomaterials, metal nanomaterials as well as composites for surface modification of electrodes for sensitive detection and quantification of SSRIs, including fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline. Sensor fabrication, sensor/analyte interactions, design rationale and properties of functional material and the electrocatalytic effect of the modified electrode on SSRI detection are discussed.",

            "text": "Depression is among one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and social issues [1] affecting men and women of all ages [2,3]. It is one of the major causes of morbidity and is associated with increased mortality [3]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 280 million people globally are affected by the disease. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of depression and anxiety disorders has increased by 25% worldwide [4], thereby increasing the prescription of antidepressants [5]. Antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are available [6]. Antidepressant drugs vary significantly in their effect on individuals [7,8]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become the first choice and among the most prescribed treatments [9] of moderate to severe depressive illness, various phobias, personality disorders and illnesses related to serotonin deficiencies nationally and worldwide [10]. SSRIs act by selectively inhibiting the presynaptic recovery of serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) at the serotonin transporter (SERT), causing the increase\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1334. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14071334 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1334 2 of 27\nin serotonin at the postsynaptic membrane in the serotonergic synapse [11,12], thus improving depressive symptoms and the cognitive function of patients [13]. The highly prescribed classes in this category are: fluoxetine (FLX), citalopram (CIT), escitalopram (ESC), paroxetine (PRX), fluvoxamine (FLV) and sertraline (STR) [14]. These SSRIs share a similar mechanism of action. However, they are structurally different with no common motifs which subsequently results in their unique pharmacological differences [12]. These agents can safely and successfully treat depression [15]. However, there is a high variability in response to the drugs where a substantial number of individuals may experience no therapeutic response at all or only a delayed one [16]; those who do respond, may experience severe side effects [16]. Side effects include: nausea dizziness, sweating, tremors [17], agitation, blurred consciousness, gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, sexual dysfunction [6], risk of arrhythmias, leukopenia, manic behaviour [18] and suicidal tendencies [13]. Although there are many antidepressants available, the effectiveness of the therapy is still a serious issue [19]. Genetic polymorphisms may have an impact on the response to SSRI treatment where the rate at which drugs are metabolised is associated with variants in the gene [20]. Thus, individuals can be classified as poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultra-rapid metabolisers on the basis of their inherited genetic profiles [16]. The intake of the appropriate dosage of antidepressant is important to ensure that the patient gets the optimum therapeutic effects and that the severe side effects and toxicity are minimised [21]. Therefore, the monitoring of SSRIs is crucial for its clinical applications [22]. A variety of advanced analytical techniques for the detection of SSRIs have been found in the literature which include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultra-violet detection, liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) [23], gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) [24], solid-phase extraction, capillary electrophoresis spectrophotometry, tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry [10]. However, these conventional methods are expensive, tedious and often involve cumbersome procedures and pre-treatment steps with limited portability which does not make them reliable for rapid detection and makes them inconvenient for everyday use [25]. As a result of the electroactive properties of SSRIs, electrochemical methods have been used for the detection of these drugs providing adequate insight into the redox properties and metabolism of these compounds [26]. Electrochemical sensors for the detection of SSRIs provide simplicity, high sensitivity and selectivity [27], a broad window of potential [28], stability and reproducibility [29]. These sensors are also low cost and provide a rapid response time with easy miniaturization and construction for portable applications for on-site detection of SSRIs [30]. However, with a conventional bare or unmodified working electrode, the electrochemical detection of SSRIs may incur common problems which include, a low detection of SSRIs in real samples, as a result of low concentration of the analytes, the high over potential at the working electrodes as well as the interference of other biomolecules present in the sample with similar oxidation potential. Considering that SSRIs are absorbed onto the surface of the electrode during the oxidation/reduction reactions, the reproducibility and reuse of the bare electrode is limited. To overcome these challenges, functional material and/or nanomaterials known for their unique physicochemical and electrical properties have been incorporated into the surfaces of the bare working electrodes providing the modified electrode with new and fascinating properties. These impact strongly on the application of electrochemical sensors and biosensors through better selective and sensitive detection, limited interference of other biomolecules, improved reproducibility and increased usage, and the reduced effects of fouling [31]. Studies in material and nanomaterial sciences have progressed significantly, where materials with controlled dimensions and morphologies as well as surface charges and other physicochemical properties have been fabricated which can then be customised to specific analytes for electrochemical sensing. This review summarises the literature data from 2016 to 2023 that have demonstrated the modification of carbon-based electrodes\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1334 3 of 27\n(glassy carbon electrodes, carbon paste electrodes, screen-printed electrodes, graphite electrodes and carbon fiber electrodes) and metal-based electrodes (pencil lead electrodes, gold electrodes and platinum electrodes) with polymers, carbon nanomaterials, metal materials and nano/composites as functional materials and/or nanomaterials. Very few studies were conducted where only the bare or unmodified working electrode was used for the quantification and detection of SSRIs. These include, boron-doped diamond electrodes, edge-plane graphite electrodes [32], hanging mercury drop electrodes [33] and paper-based electrodes [34]. It is important to fully understand the physicochemical and electronic interactions occurring at the analyte-functional material-based electrode interface in order to explore the overall capabilities of advanced electrochemical sensors [35]. Thus, this review aims to evaluate the use of the functionalised material for the surface modification of the working electrode in electrochemical detection and the quantification of SSRIs in various sample types, as the appropriate functionalised material type has a direct effect on the performance and success of the electroanalysis [26]."

Their low cost, small dimensions and large surface area with simple preparation steps have enabled researchers to apply them in sensors. The conductivity of conducting polymers was initially observed in polyacetylene, where its instability led to the discovery of polyaniline (PANI), poly(o-toluidine) (PoT), poly(o-anisidine) (PoAN), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTh) and polyfluorene (PF).

            "text": "Molecular-imprinted polymers (MIPs) are considered stable polymers [37] that have been used in electrode surface modification as a promising functional material [38]. As synthetic biomimetic analogues with binding cavities for templates [39], MIPs offer chemical and steric specificity with good sensitivity towards the targeted analyte. They are also economical and easy to produce and are durable. MIP suspensions are commonly synthesised from Nafion and chitosan that allow for binding onto the electrode surface. Chitosan is known for its biocompatible and good adsorption traits [40]. Feroz and team [40] produced a novel photoinitiated MIP for the modification of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the sensitive and selective detection of fluoxetine. Through precipitation polymerisation, reproducible layers of MIP were drop coated onto a GCE and the sensor was applied to blood serum samples. Results confirmed the irreversible nature of fluoxetine with greater current responses and sharper oxidations than a nonimprinted polymer layer. MIP modified GCE showed a selectivity towards fluoxetine in the presence of interfering molecules of similar sizes owing to the affinity of the structural cavities for fluoxetine [40]. The modification of the electrode surface may not only provide a platform for the electrode reaction but can also assist in binding the target analyte. A PVC membrane with the appropriate sensing element placed on the appropriate transducer is necessary when fabricating an electrochemical potentiometric sensor. However, the PVC membrane requires an intermediate material to improve the effectivity of the ion-to-electron transfer. In this case, conducting polymers with efficient ionic and electrical conductivity have proven to be the best option [41]. Conducting polymers have specific functional groups found on their surfaces that can be oxidised and reduced and, in turn, they can electrocatalyse the oxidation and reduction of the analyte of interest. Through hydrogen bonding, these functional groups have been found to possess a high affinity for the target analyte, ion exchange and electrostatic interaction capabilities as well as reducing fouling by forming a protective layer on the electrode. Because of these properties, they have been widely used in electrochemical sensors [29]. Poly(pyrrole) (PPy)\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1334 4 of 27\nis a quasi-unidimensional polymer where the crosslinking and chains occur during its polymerisation. PPy is an insulator but its oxidized derivatives can be good electrical conductors, where its conductivity ranges from 2 to 10 S/m. Higher conductivities are achievable with larger anions during polymerisation [41]. To quantify fluoxetine in pharmaceutical formulations, Madani [41] introduced a solid state potentiometric sensor coated with conducting polymers. Instead of using a traditional membrane electrode, Madani used a graphite rod as a better ion-to-electron transducer and a sensing layer that can be used separately or as a composite. Pyrrole was electrochemically polymerised onto the graphite rod, forming a layer of poly(pyrrole) (PPy). A thin layer of another polymeric composite composed of poly(vinyl chloride), dibutyl phthalate and ion-pair compound of FLX and phenyl borate was then covered on the treated surface. PPy was incorporated to improve the ion-to-electron transduction capabilities of the electrode. The modified sensor showed superior performance compared to traditional symmetric PVC membrane electrodes or even asymmetric coated wire sensors. An LOD of 0.63 \u00b5M, a rapid response time, and a lifetime of two months were the characteristics of the modified sensor. Real sample analyses confirmed the applicability of the sensor in quantification of fluoxetine active ingredients of pharmaceutical formulation with great accuracy and precision. The electrochemical deposition of the conducting layer followed by the physical application of the sensing layer lead to better adherence to the solid contact and improved sensor performance [41]."

As an ion-to-electron transducer, PEDOT-C14 was electrodeposited onto the electrode and coated with a PVC membrane (Figure 1). PEDOT-C14 is capable of being reduced for the transfer of cations at the membrane/water interface. To detect the SSRIs in their cationic forms, Izadyar and colleagues [42] applied ITSV and showed the accumulation of these SSRIs in the PVC membrane from water samples which were exhaustively stripped from the membrane for a highly sensitive detection. The modified electrode exhibited high lipophilicity and an LOD of 35, 45 and 25 nM for fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, respectively, in tap and river water [42]. In comparison to previous studies, Izadyar and colleagues showed that the use of ITSV eliminated the need for toxic mercury electrodes and instead used a low cost, modified pencil lead-based sensor with adequate detection limit of SSRIs in tap and river water [42]. For the detection of citalopram, Rebelo et al. [43] demonstrated a sustainable and low cost method for fabricating a voltammetric MIP screen-printed carbon electrode. Through computational studies using molecular dynamics, optimal MIP formulations were predicted with a greener and rational approach, avoiding the use of organic solvents that are accompanied by analytical procedures. The modified sensor revealed a good sensitivity towards citalopram detection as revealed by an LOD of 0.162 \u00b5M.

The literature has shown that various carbon-based electrodes and metal electrodes have been modified with polymer-based functional material. Most studies have focused on using PVC membrane with conducting polymers. In one study, a graphite rod was used instead of the traditional PVC membrane, due to the detection of drift, potentially as a result of high charge-transfer resistance. However, the electrodes that employed the PVC membrane, showed a greater sensitivity for SSRI detection. The incorporation of cyclodextrins onto gold electrodes also revealed higher sensitivity for SSRI detection.

[102] fabricated a GCE modified with a nanocomposite composed of a manganese-based metal\u2013organic framework (JUK-2), MWCNTs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). JUK-2 MOF showed excellent proton-conductive properties, great stability in aquatic media and was capable of forming a highly homogenous layer on GCE. Because JUK-2 displayed no electrocatalytic properties or possessed electron conductivity, MWCNTs and AuNPs were implemented, providing an enlarged active surface area and the formation of the hybrid nanocomposite which acts as an MIEC. EIS and CV results indicated that the hybrid nanocomposite exhibited MIEC properties. An LOD of 0.011 \u00b5M was achieved and the sensor was successfully applied to biological and water samples with recovery rates of 98.6\u2013104.8%. The performance and success of the sensor toward citalopram are attributed to JUK-2 MOF that excellently bound MWCNTs and AuNPs, ensuring their synergistic effects as well as the high reproducibility and accuracy of results. The hybrid nanocomposite possessing both electron and proton conductivity was responsible for the outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of citalopram [102] For the enhanced detection of citalopram, Aminikhah and team [103] fabricated a GCE modified through in situ electopolymerisation of MIP PPy onto hollow nickel nanosperes (hNiNS) activated with MWCNTs-coupled graphene oxide nanoribbons (AMWCNTs@GONRs). Hollow nanopores or spheres are known to exhibit high surface-to-volume ratios, excellent biocompatibility and electrical conductivity properties due to their morphology. Combining hNiNS with AMWCNTs greatly enhanced the current response to citalopram through an increased rate of electron transfer and enhanced catalytic activity. MIP PPy provided specific binding sites for citalopram, improving the selectivity of the sensor. The sensor achieved an LOD of 0.043 \u00b5M [103].\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1334 19 of 27"

Sertraline The exploration of metallopolymers containing Ni(II)\u2013Ni(III) redox couples have gained great attention owing to their high electrocatalytic activity towards electro-oxidation of various substrates including, amino acids, amines and carbohydrates. Nickel oxyhydride species are formed during the reaction which act as a mediator between the analyte and the electrode surface in electro-oxidation processes. Amino acids such as levodopa (L-3, 4-dihydroxypheny- lalanine, LD) have been used as ligands for the electrochemical deposition of metallopolymers on the electrode surface, specifically in the biomedical fields [64]. For the detection of sertraline, Shoja and team [64] modified a GCE through electropolymerisation of nanostructured Ni(II)\u2013LD (LD: levodopa) complex onto AuNP-bound MWCNTs in alkaline solution. The synergistic effect of the AuNPs and MWCNTs provided an effective large surface area for the immobilisation of Ni(II)-LD nanostructures, which in turn promoted the electrocatalytic oxidation of sertraline as a result of the active Ni(II)/Ni(III) sites. The proposed electrode provided an inexpensive fabrication method with excellent selectivity and sensitivity for sertraline oxidation, a low detection limit with good linear response in wide concentration range and good reproducibility and stability [64].

This showed that the sensor was capable of creating an immediate response when the analyte comes into contact with the enzyme. The use of fluvoxamine showed a reversible competitive inhibition where the enzyme was only inactivated by paroxetine, as the sensor response would increase in the presence of fluvoxamine.

            "text": "Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the primary and the most prescribed drugs to treat major depression and depression-related disorders. With the demand for cost-effective, sensitive, accurate and rapid detection of SSRIs, there has been great focus on, and research undertaken towards, developing electrochemical sensors with surface-modified electrodes. This review features a brief overview of recent advances in the electrochemical sensor development for SSRI detection. It has attempted to elucidate the properties and interactions of surface-modified electrodes on target analytes with the significance of the functional material and the potential use of the developed electrochemical sensor. Over the past seven years, significant progress has been made in the development of novel materials and nanomaterials for the modification of electrodes for an efficient, sensitive and selective quantification and detection of SSRIs. According to the published literature, modified electrodes using composites and nanocomposites were more common among sensor development for SSRI detection than individual material because of the synergistic effect of materials for enhanced detection. Research has demonstrated that carbon\u2013metal-based composites as well as carbon\u2013polymer-based composites were the most extensively used functional material for electrode surface modification. In the carbon\u2013 metal nanocomposites, MWCNTs were most commonly used in conjunction with the metal and/or metal oxide nanoparticles. MIP was most commonly used in carbon\u2013polymer composites with either graphene or MWCNT material. These materials were shown to provide exceptional detection limits with great selectivity as a result of the synergistic effects that facilitate enhanced catalytic reactions on the target analyte. Metal\u2013polymer-based composites provided the greatest sensitivity for SSRI quantification and detection with the LOD as low as pM. Sertraline was the most detected SSRI using the modified electrodes, which makes sense as sertraline is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant. Most of the studies performed analyses of SSRIs in real samples. The general trend in recent years for detection of SSRIs uses GCE modified mostly with carbon-based functional material and polymers. Metal electrodes have rarely been used as this permits high sensitivity and selectivity with reduced interference, which may be suitable in clinical studies. This also provides high efficiency and a rapid analysis time. The development of new materials and\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1334 23 of 27\nnanomaterials are necessary to enhance surface performance of the electrode in order to achieve ultra-trace analysis of SSRIs in various sample types and, in turn, improve the practicability. In general, the modification of electrode surfaces with functional materials, have great advantages and development prospects in SSRI sensing.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.F.A.; methodology, K.P.; software, validation, T.M., formal analysis, S.C.L.B.; investigation, S.C.L.B.; resources, C.F.; data curation, S.C.L.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.C.L.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.C.L.B., T.M. and K.P.; supervision, R.F.A.; project administration, K.P. and C.F.; funding acquisition, R.F.A.
