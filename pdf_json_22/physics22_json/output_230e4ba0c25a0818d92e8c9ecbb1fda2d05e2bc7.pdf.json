    "abstractText": "The NeuLAND (New Large-Area Neutron Detector) plastic-scintillator-based time-of-flight detector for 0.1-1.6 GeV neutrons is currently under construction at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), Darmstadt, Germany. In its final configuration, NeuLAND will consist of 3,000 2.7 m \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 5 cm big plastic scintillator bars that are read out on each end by fast timing photomultipliers. Here, data from a comprehensive study of an alternative light readout scheme using silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) are reported. For this purpose, a NeuLAND bar was instrumented on each end with a SiPM-based prototype of the same geometry as a 1\u201d photomultiplier tube, including four 6\u00d76 mm2 SiPMs, amplifiers, high voltage supply, and microcontroller. Tests were done out using the 35 MeV electron beam from the superconducting Electron Linac for beams with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) with its picosecond-level time jitter in two different modes of operation, namely parasitic mode with one electron per bunch and single-user mode with 1-60 electrons per bunch. Acqiris fast digitisers were used for data acquisition. In addition, off-beam tests using cosmic rays and the NeuLAND data acquisition scheme have been carried out. Typical time resolutions of \u03c3 \u2264 120 ps were found for \u226595% efficiency for minimum ionising particles, improving on previous work at ELBE and exceeding the NeuLAND timing goal of \u03c3 < 150 ps. Over a range of 10-300 MeV deposited energy in the NeuLAND bar, the gain was found to deviate by \u226410% (\u226420%) from linearity for 35 \u03bcm (75 \u03bcm) SiPM pitch, respectively, satisfactory for calorimetric use of the full NeuLAND detector. The dark rate of the prototype studied was found to be lower than the expected cosmic-ray induced background in NeuLAND.",

For this purpose, a NeuLAND bar was instrumented on each end with a SiPM-based prototype of the same geometry as a 1\u201d photomultiplier tube, including four 6\u00d76 mm2 SiPMs, amplifiers, high voltage supply, and microcontroller.\nTests were done out using the 35 MeV electron beam from the superconducting Electron Linac for beams with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) with its picosecond-level time jitter in two different modes of operation, namely parasitic mode with one electron per bunch and single-user mode with 1-60 electrons per bunch. Acqiris fast digitisers were used for data acquisition. In addition, off-beam tests using cosmic rays and the NeuLAND data acquisition scheme have been carried out.\nTypical time resolutions of \u03c3 \u2264 120 ps were found for \u226595% efficiency for minimum ionising particles, improving on previous work at ELBE and exceeding the NeuLAND timing goal of \u03c3 < 150 ps. Over a range of 10-300 MeV deposited energy in the NeuLAND bar, the gain was found to deviate by \u226410% (\u226420%) from linearity for 35 \u00b5m (75 \u00b5m) SiPM pitch, respectively, satisfactory for calorimetric use of the full NeuLAND detector.

In the meantime a wide range of affordable types of SiPMs has become available. However, the light readout of large scintillator based neutron detectors is still dominated by\nEmail address: d.bemmerer@hzdr.de (Daniel Bemmerer) 1Deceased.\nthe use of PMTs [2, 3], despite ongoing developments [4, 5]. On the contrary, the use of SiPMs has become widespread in other applications [6\u20139] .\nOne of the new-generation neutron time-of-flight detectors is the New Large-Area Neutron Detector (NeuLAND) for the R3B setup at GSI/FAIR in Darmstadt, Germany [10\u201312]. This detector is necessary for inverse-kinematics experiments with the detection of relativistic neutrons [13, 14] that are important for the study of astrophysical neutron capture reactions by Coulomb dissociation. One of the long-term goals is to independently confirm, by direct neutron detection, the existence of the recently discovered [15] tetraneu-\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A December 20, 2022\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n09 42\n1v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. in\nsde\nt] 1\n9 D\nec 2\ntron state. Prior to the construction of NeuLAND, in a first phase studies of an approach based on iron neutron converters and multi gap resistive plate chambers had been performed [16\u201318]. However, for the final construction of NeuLAND, instead a granular design using fast plastic scintillator bars of 2.7 m length and 5\u00d75 cm2 area has been adopted. This scintillator-based design is expected to display better calorimetric properties [19], important for the multi-neutron detection as in the tetraneutron case [15]. In its final, not yet reached form, NeuLAND will contain 3,000 scintillator bars (RP-408, equivalent to EJ-200 and BC-408) instrumented with altogether 6,000 fast-timing PMTs (Hamamatsu R8619 or equivalent). Groups of 50 horizontal and 50 vertical scintillator bars will form one of a total of 30 so-called NeuLAND double planes. Currently, 40% of NeuLAND is already complete, and extensive simulations have been carried out [11, 20].\nIn order to improve the long-term viability of NeuLAND by offering an alternative and more economical readout option, in parallel to the ongoing construction, a study of an alternative light readout scheme by SiPMs is ongoing. In the first part of this study, it had already been shown that SiPMs fulfil the ambitious NeuLAND timing goal of \u03c3 < 150 ps, at close to full efficiency [4]. The present work reports the second part of this study. Using a new and much simplified readout prototype, again time resolution and efficiency are determined. In addition, now also the linearity of the gain over a wide range of signal amplitudes and the rate of so-called dark triggers have been investigated.\nIn the final NeuLAND detector, a 0.2-1.6 GeV neutron will scatter with a certain probability in the plastic scintillator material and give rise to a secondary proton with similar energy, in addition to possibly secondary neutrons and \u03b3 rays. Many of the secondary proton will have similar energy as the primary neutron and therefore be close to a mimimum ionising particle. Their interactions can therefore be studied using other minimum ionising particles; in this work, 35 MeV electrons from an accelerator and cosmic-ray muons are used to this end. As a result of the scintillation process, scintillation light of 420 nm wavelength is created in the plastic. For parts of the present study, instead of scintillation light, artificial light pulses from a 422 nm wavelength pulsed laser are used. The scintillation, or laser, light is then detected either by a classical photomultiplier or, in this work mainly, by a SiPM-based prototype.\nThis work is organised as follows. The new SiPMbased prototype, developed as possible replacement for a 1\u201d PMT, is described in section 2. It has been studied\nat a number of experimental setups (section 3), both inbeam at the ELBE 35 MeV electron beam and off-beam with a picosecond laser and cosmic-ray muons. In section 4, the calibration and data reduction procedures are described. The results of the in-beam measurements on time resolution, efficiency, and linearity are presented in section 5. The off-beam results on dark rate and muon capability are given in section 6. A discussion is given in section 7, and a summary and outlook in section 8."

The guiding principles were to construct a device that is easy to handle, sized to directly replace a standard 1\u201d PMT, and with a modular design to allow easy testing of different SiPMs types. This goal was realised with a stack of three multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs). The stack also included a temperature-regulated SiPM bias power supply, a microcontroller, preamplification, summing, and amplification stages (Figure 1)."

In order to study the effects caused by this limitation, a Monte Carlo simulation of the propagation of the scintillation light caused by an initial\n35 MeV electron transiting the NeuLAND bar was performed. This simulation used the GEANT4 [21] package, with the QGSP_BERT_HP and G4OpticalPhysics physics lists, with scintillation and Cherenkov processes enabled [22, 23]. The realistic NeuLAND bar geometry was implemented, with a total length of 270 cm, a square surface area of 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 and at each end a 10 cm conical shaped transition from the square area to a 25 mm diameter circular light output area. The datasheet properties of RP-408 (polyvinyltoluene, density 1.032 g/cm3, refractive index n = 1.58, 10,000 photons/MeVee light yield) were adopted, and perfect reflection was assumed at the NeuLAND bar sides. The simulation showed that the circular ends of the NeuLAND bar are homogeneously illuminated, so the precise placement of the SiPMs on the bar does not matter.\nAt the center of the SiPM layout, a pulsed LED is installed, to monitor the device performance. In addition, a temperature sensor (TFPT0603L1001FV) for the SiPM bias temperature correction is placed there (Figure 1). The optical coupling between the polished scintillator surface and the SiPM board was made via a foil made of optically clear silicone (QSil 219) with 1 mm thickness."

The C14156 provides a bias voltage of up to 80 V with a maximum current of 2 mA. The temperature dependence of the SiPM breakdown voltage is compensated by the C14156 unit, based on the reading of a thermoresistor directly coupled to the SiPMs and a useradjustable temperature compensation function.\nThe output voltage and the slope of the temperature compensation are controlled by analog control voltages supplied to the C14156 by 20 bit Texas Instruments DAC1220 Digital-to-Analog converters. The DACs, in turn, are controlled by the microcontroller.\nEach of the four SiPMs is connected to its own two staged transistor (BFU550A) preamplifier. The outputs of the four preamplifiers are summed in an ADG4612 analog switch. For calibration purposes, the four ADG4612 input channels can be switched on independently by the microcontroller. The ADG4612 sum signal is finally amplified with a Texas Instruments OPA695IDBVT and routed out.

ELBE delivers up to 40 MeV electron beam with a wide range of repetition rates and beam intensities from single electrons up to 1.6 mA continuous wave current.\nFor detector tests, the direct electron beam is produced by the ELBE thermionic electron source, accelerated and deflected, and exits the evacuated beam line (10\u221210 hPa) through a thin beryllium window into air. The 13 MHz radio frequency applied to the electron gun has a jitter on the few ps level and serves as timing reference. Due to this arrangement, it is not necessary to include time reference detectors with a time resolution that is better than that of the devices under study.\nThere are two ELBE modes of operation, called single-user and parasitic mode, respectively. In singleuser mode, the beam intensity is controlled via the operating parameters of the electronic gun, and using very low gate voltages at the extraction grid bunches of just 1-60 electrons are created and accelerated. Off-axis electrons created by discharges are absorbed in remotely controlled, movable screens along the beam line [29]. In parasitic mode, the direct electron beam is created by inserting a thin scattering wire in the beam line while running a main experiment on a completely different physics case that takes place in the positron or neutron time-of-flight beam lines. Just one time-correlated electron per bunch is then guided to the direct electron beam station. The scattered out electrons have a negligible effect on the main experiment. Thus, parasitic mode allows the use of ELBE for detector tests without devoting primary beam time to the experiment.\nA common feature of both modes of operation is that most bunches are actually empty, i.e. devoid of electrons, with an effective electron beam rate that can vary between 100-105 s\u22121."

The numbers of fired pixels, in turn, are obtained from the laser-based calibration of each side as described above (Equation 1).\nThe observed pulse height spectrum can be fitted by a single Landau distribution for parasitic mode and by a sum of Landau distributions for single-user mode (Figure 5). A typical example is given by the onsemi J Series 60035 SiPM. For the prototype using this SiPM type, the observed Landau distributions have a mean value of \u00b5J35 = 331, and they are offset from each other by the same value \u00b5J35 (Figure 5).

The four SiPMs used in one prototype cover only 30% of the 490 mm2 surface of the light guide at the bar end. For comparison, a standard 1\" cylindrical PMT covers this entire area.

This 0.5 cm thick initial scintillator is called S1S2 and has an area of 2\u00d72 cm2.

Note that at the lowest gate voltage\nstudied, UG = 8.5 V, the average number of electrons per bunch is below 1, because there are some triggered events where the signal in the NeuLAND bar is very low, presumably due to electrons that are scattered out of the beam or due to false triggers from background electrons.\nAt low values of Q12, the data show strict proportionality between nmip and Q12 (Figure 6, full red curve):\nnmip = 0.095 pC\u22121 \u00d7 Q12 (3) However, for Q12 > 100 pC (corresponding to nobsmip > 10) some deviation from linearity is observed (Figure 6, dashed red curve).

A GEANT4 simulation of the electron beam propagating through the Roos chamber and the NeuLAND bar showed that only fGEANT = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 of the incoming electrons hitting the NeuLAND bar also passed the\nsmaller Roos chamber.

Then, the theoretically predicted number of electrons traversing the chamber nmip is given by\nnmip = f theory Roos \u00d7 QRoos (5)\nIn order to use the data of the Roos chamber quantitatively, in addition to these theoretical considerations, an experimental calibration was performed. The electron beam was used in single-user mode, with 2 kHz signal rate. The Roos current was averaged over a time of 2- 5 minutes with stable accelerator parameters, and converted to a charge QRoos by multiplying with the 0.5 ms\nintegration window size given by the 2 kHz beam rate. The data are shown in Figure 6, blue triangles.\nThe Roos data are well described by a linear curve with a constant background of 1.6 aC (integrated current over 0.2 ms). This Roos chamber background may be explained by two factors: First, activation of the room and beam line, and second, so-called dark electrons created by discharges and then accelerated in the outer areas of the beam line. The latter are not correlated in time to the RF signal of the electron gun. The background value of 1.6 aC is fitted as a free parameter in the calibration curve and lies in the range of values obtained during dedicated room background measurements undertaken during beam interruptions.\nUsing now the above described calibration for the reference charge Q12 (Equation 3), the following relation for the experimentally observed calibration factor f expRoos is obtained:\nf expRoos = nobsmip\nQno bgRoos\n= 0.095 pC\u22121 \u00d7 Q12\nQno bgRoos\n= 0.095 pC\u22121\nQno bgRoos \u00d7\nQno bgRoos 0.042 aC/pC\n= (2.3 \u00b1 0.2) aC\u22121 (6)\nwhere nobsmip = f exp Roos \u00d7 Q no bg Roos (7)\nThe experimental calibration factor (Equation 6) is in fair agreement with the theoretical one (Equation 4).

At higher values of Q12, nobsmip is lower than predicted by linearity, which is qualitatively in agreement with the onset of saturation behaviour in the SiPMs used to determine nobsmip.\nAt the same high values of Q12, however, Q12 is strictly proportional to the Roos chamber charge QRoos. At these values, the necessary background correction\nof the Roos chamber (see above, subsection 4.5) introduces only negligible uncertainty.\nImportantly, the Roos chamber has been designed to show a strictly linear response up to doses of Gy, orders of magnitude above the range explored here. The calibration of S1S2 against the Roos chamber data (Figure 6, blue curve) shows that there are no saturation effects in the Q12 reference charge. Therefore, in the intensity range used here, S1S2 can be used as a secondary linearity standard, derived from the well-known Roos chamber linearity.\nSummarising, the data of the two ancillary detectors used here show that Q12 is a suitable proxy for the true number of electrons per bunch over the entire intensity range explored here."

Briefly, the respective trigger times obtained by the software CFDs for prototypes at both ends of the bar were averaged in order to remove the effect of the lateral size of the electron beam, and the reference time given by the accelerator RF signal was then subtracted event by event from this average. The resultant distribution was almost free of time-walk effects and simply fitted by a Gaussian to obtain \u03c3t.\nIn order to be conservative, in this work the contributions of the DAQ system and the time reference from the accelerator, both below 23 ps, were not subtracted from the \u03c3t values. The time resolutions shown here have a typical uncertainty of 5 ps, which is given by the variation of measured time resolutions in different experimental runs taken at different times, i.e. the run-to-run reproducibility.\nThe efficiency is defined as the ratio between the number of NeuLAND triggers N((S3\u2227S4)\u2227 (S1\u2227S2\u2227 S5 \u2227 S6)), on the one hand, and the rate of reference\ntriggers N((S1 \u2227 S2 \u2227 S5 \u2227 S6), on the other hand:\n= N((S3 \u2227 S4) \u2227 (S1 \u2227 S2 \u2227 S5 \u2227 S6))\nN((S1 \u2227 S2 \u2227 S5 \u2227 S6) (8)\nWhen comparing different SiPM types, it is observed that an increase in pixel size improves the time resolution. This is due to the higher fill factor, hence higher photon detection efficiency (PDE), of devices with larger pixels and less insensitive interpixel areas.\nFor all SiPMs studied, the data show a range in operating voltages around 2-3 V overvoltage that is several volts wide where the NeuLAND timing goal of \u03c3t \u2264 150 ps (green area in Figure 7) and the NeuLAND efficiency goal of \u2265 95% are both fulfilled. The lower edge of this optimal operating range is given by the decrease in PDE for lower overvoltages.\nThe upper edge, instead, is given by the onset of a significant dark rate. The degradation of the time resolution may be cause by one of two effects, or a combination of both: First, a dark count rate that affects the baseline and, hence, the time resolution (e.g. Figure 3, panels (a) and (b)). Second, dark current that may affect the amplifier [30].\nThe present plateaus are sufficiently wide for the present purposes. In the literature, using a different electronics layout with a faster return to baseline than in the present case, a similar level (\u03c3 \u223c 140 ps) of the timing plateau has been reported, but with a significantly wider, up to 4-6 V overvoltage, plateau width [31]."

If a pixel has already fired and a second photon is hitting the pixel in the same time, it cannot fire again. So the observed number of fired pixels nfired is reduced below the expected number of firing pixels nseed. This effect can be described with a statistically motivated approach [32]:\nnobsfired = npixels\n[ 1 \u2212 exp ( \u2212 nseed\nnpixels\n)] (9)\nFor practical purposes, here the linearity is quantified by its slope, which is given by the derivative of Equation 9:\ndnobsfired dnseed\n= exp ( \u2212 nseed\nnpixels\n) (10)\nIn an ideal case, the obtained slope (Equation 10) should be close to unity to allow an accurate energy determination.\nIn the literature, studies of the SiPM saturation behaviour have been reported, e.g., illuminating the SiPM directly with laser light, either at the SiPM sensitive wavelength [33], or at shorter wavelength to cause fluorescence [34]. Here, a different approach is chosen. The number of ionising particles per bunch that are simultaneously crossing the NeuLAND scintillator bar is varied in ELBE single-user mode. In this way, the possible recharging of fired SiPM pixels (not visible when using precisely time-correlated laser photons [33]) should be directly included in the results obtained. The same is expected to be true for saturation effects in the scintillation process itself (not visible when using lasers [33, 34]).\nThe expected range of energy depositions in NeuLAND reaches up to 300 MeV [10]. For 10 MeV energy deposition per 35 MeV electron passing the NeuLAND bar, this corresponds to a range of 1-33 electrons per bunch.\nFor this study, data in single-user mode were taken at several different gate voltages, corresponding to different average numbers of electrons per bunch. The data from different runs were accumulated to give an overall picture and fitted to Equation 9. For the fit, the number of pixels from the datasheet npixels was replaced by an effective number of pixels neff, which was fitted as a\nfree parameter. The accumulated data and fitted curves are shown in Figure 8.\nThe fitted effective number of pixels is generally somewhat lower than the datasheet value. For example, for the onsemi J Series 60035 based prototype, the fit results in neff = 59800\u00b1200, 35% lower than the data sheet value of neff = 4\u00d722292 = 89168. This corresponds to a stronger saturation effect than theoretically predicted. This is probably due to incomplete integration of large pulses due to the fixed integration window length (Figure 3) in our test environment. Another possible explanation is a reduction of voltage, hence detection efficiency and gain, for strong light pulses with a high number of firing pixels and a correspondingly high signal current [35].\nFor the NeuLAND application, the ratio fsat = nobsfired/nseed corresponding to the integrated saturation correction has been determined at a number of fired pixels equivalent to 300 MeV deposited energy. The determined values range between 0.81 and 0.92. With saturation corrections that are so close to unity, the calorimetric properties of the NeuLAND bar are still maintained, so no effort was made to further decrease saturation effects. As expected, both the integrated saturation correction and its slope are largest for the largest pixel size (75 \u00b5m), i.e. the lowest number of pixels per SiPM."

The frequency of occurrence of this effect depends on parameters like the overvoltage, temperature, radiation damage, and the production process in general [36, 37]. In case of a high rate of such events, stochastic coincidences and crosstalk between pixels may lead to dark events with macroscopic amplitudes that resemble real scintillation events.\nIn the case of the NeuLAND detector, such events can typically be rejected, because the dark signals are not time correlated to the start signal of the time of flight system. Still, a high dark count rate might overload the data acquisition or trigger generation system.\nThe NeuLAND trigger is composed of so-called double plane triggers, where each double plane is made of two single planes of 50 NeuLAND bars each. A double plane (dp) trigger is produced when any two of the n = 200 photosensors of the dp show a signal of \u22650.5 MeVee in a coincidence time window of \u03c4 = 60 ns. The total dark rate Rdp of a double plane by random coincidences can then be estimated using the measured\ndark rate Rtrig of a single photosensor assembly, again taken for \u22650.5 MeVee signals.\nRdp = n \u00b7 (n \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u03c4 \u00b7 R2trig. (11)\nThe measured dark count spectrum (Figure 9, for the typical example of the Hamamatsu S14160-6075 based prototype) shows the expected strong dependence on overvoltage and on the trigger threshold. The rate Rtrig is determined by using the rate for the number of fired pixels that correspond to 0.5 MeVee deposited energy, at the overvoltage used.\nThe results for the dark count rates of the SiPMs studied here are given in Table 2: For each overvoltage studied, the measured rate per prototype Robstrig and the calculated dark rate Rcalcdp using (Equation 11) and R obs trig are shown.\nFor the cases of the onsemi J Series 60035 and Hamamatsu S14160-6075 SiPMs, a calculated dark rate of Rcalcdp = 10 s\n\u22121 per double plane is found. For a full NeuLAND with 30 double planes, this would mean a dark rate of 300 s\u22121, lower than the expected cosmic rate of 1500 s\u22121 for the full NeuLAND [10]. The Hamamatsu S14160-6050 based prototype, however, shows a much higher dark rate.\nFor information, also the total dark count rate Robsdark with a trigger threshold corresponding to half the amplitude of one fired pixel is shown. This value can be compared to the datasheet values of Rdark (Table 1). The present measured Robsdark is higher than the datasheet value for the onsemi SiPM and lower for the Hamamatsu SiPMs, probably reflecting variability in this parameter from device to device.\nNo study of the temperature dependence of the dark count rate has been performed here. Previous work has shown that the dark count rate doubles for every 5-10 K temperature increase [38]."

            "text": "In order to further evaluate the practicability of reading out the NeuLAND scintillation light by SiPMs, a test was performed at the NeuLAND test station of GSI, using the NeuLAND electronics (subsection 3.6) and one Hamamatsu S14160-6075 based prototype.\nThe observed charge spectrum (Figure 10, blue curve) for incident cosmic-ray muons generally resembles that of a standard PMT (Figure 10, red curve). There are two main differences. First, the SiPM-based prototype has about 20% higher gain, a fact that can in principle be corrected using lower gain in the SiPM electronics. Second, even after correcting for the gain, the SiPM based prototype has a higher effective trigger threshold . This higher threshold is probably due to the fact that the total length of the pulses from the present prototype seems to be slightly too long, reducing the trigger efficiency especially for smaller signals. Again, this can in principle be corrected by a slight modification in the amplifier.\nNo measurement of the time resolutions with muons was attempted, as this would have required the use of a reference detector with essentially the same time resolution as the device under study. Instead, the time resolution was measured with a picosecond laser system, setting the amplitude to correspond to the main muon\npeak (Figure 10). For readout with the PMT, the resultant time resolution is \u03c3t = 80 ps. For readout with the SiPM, \u03c3t = 83-100 ps is found, depending on the operating voltage."

            "text": "In the present section, the various aspects needed for usage of a SiPM in NeuLAND that have been studied in the present work are discussed.\n1. The time resolution \u03c3t is of fundamental importance for a time of flight detector such as NeuLAND, and the technical design report calls for \u03c3t < 150 ps. In previous work, it had already been shown experimentally that this aim can be achieved with an array of four 6\u00d76 mm2 SiPMs, with an observed time resolution of \u03c3t = 136 ps [4]. Based on improvements in the prototype and also in the SiPMs studied, the present work exceeds this result. For most of the prototypes studied, there is a several volts wide plateau with \u03c3t < 120 ps (Figure 7). The one exception is the onsemi (formerly SensL) C-series 60035 SiPM that had already been studied previously [4]. For this prototype, the best value is \u03c3t = 142\u00b15 ps, consistent with the previous value of 136\u00b12 ps [4].\n2. The detection efficiency for minimum ionizing particles was previously found to be \u226595% for arrays of four 6\u00d76 mm2 SiPMs [4], as required by NeuLAND. This value was again confirmed in the present work for all SiPMs studied here (Figure 7).\n3. The dark rate has not been previously studied for SiPM arrays that will be used to detect high energy neutrons. The present results, when extrapolated to the realistic NeuLAND trigger conditions, show dark trigger rates (Rcalcdp ) of ca. 100 s\n\u22121 for all prototypes studied at the optimum overvoltage (Table 2). There is one notable exception, the Hamamatsu S14160-6050 based prototype which displays an extrapolated dark trigger rate of 3600 s\u22121 for a fully equipped double plane, much higher but still tolerable for the NeuLAND DAQ system. The fact that these dark trigger rates are tolerable is owed to the relatively restrictive NeuLAND trigger condition of two photosensors simultaneously detecting above a > 0.5 MeVee threshold. 4. The linearity of the response of the SiPM + preamplifier setup was studied using the one to few electrons per bunch of ELBE. It was found that for a deposited energy of up to 300 MeV per NeuLAND bar, the total signal deviates by \u226420% from linearity, and the slope at this highest energies is reduced by \u226435% for all cases (Figure 8). This relatively modest deviation from linearity will result in only 10% degradation of the energy resolution and is still compatible with a reliable energy calibration. 5. Finally, the practicality of connecting a NeuLAND bar read out by the present SiPM-based prototype to the NeuLAND electronics was studied using cosmic-ray and laser-based tests. It was shown that also with the NeuLAND electronics the present prototype functions well within the requested performance envelope of NeuLAND photosensors."

            "heading": "8. Summary and outlook",
            "text": "Motivated by the question whether a large scintillator-based time-of-flight detector such as NeuLAND can be successfully instrumented with semiconductor-based photosensors, called silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), a new prototype hosting four SiPMs was constructed. This prototype was designed to replace a 1\u201d classical photomultiplier tube for usage at one end of a NeuLAND plastic scintillator bar.\nExtensive tests have been done with picosecond timing lasers, cosmic-ray muons and above all single or few-electron bunches of 35 MeV electrons to study the efficiency, time resolution, dark trigger rate, linearity, and matching to the classical NeuLAND data acquisition system. All parameters tested were found to be within the performance envelope required for NeuLAND, for SiPMs operated at room temperature without active temperature stabilisation.\nRemaining questions include the practicability to manufacture a SiPM-based readout device on the scale required to (re)instrument NeuLAND with its 6,000 photosensors, and economic considerations. At current market prices, for the SiPMs studied here, the cost of the SiPM-based readout ranges from below to above the PMT option, depending on the prototype and manufacturer chosen. Also, for the specific case of NeuLAND, it has to be recognised that the SiPM operating voltages are much below the ones for the PMT option adopted, presenting advantages for safety and cabling.\nIt is hoped that this work, beyond its potential for NeuLAND, may also assist other groups pursuing similar detectors [39, e.g.]"
