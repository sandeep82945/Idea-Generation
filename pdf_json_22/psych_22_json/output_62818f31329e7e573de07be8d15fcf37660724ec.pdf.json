However, for a range of different reasons, across the UK there continue to be people who are digitally excluded. People living with a disability have been identified as being more likely to be digitally excluded and many of these people, including people with severe mental illness (SMI) already experience health inequalities. Therefore, understanding the perceived impact digital exclusion has on health and potential facilitators of increased inclusion is an important area for research. This study had two aims: 1. To understand experiences of digital exclusion and the impact on health in people with SMI. 2. To explore the influences and mechanisms which would increase engagement with digital health tools. Methods: This was an observational qualitative study, conducting focus groups (with the option of a 1:1 interview for those uncomfortable in groups) with nine people with severe mental illness. Results: Participant\u2019s responses were themed in to four key areas in relation to digital exclusion and impact on health: 1. Reduced social connectedness, 2. The impact on wider determinants of health 3. Negative perception of self, 4. Disempowerment. Key facilitators for increased engagement with digital tools included, local digital skills support with mental health lived experience involvement in the delivery, digitally engaged social referents, access to digital tools and data, personalised and straightforward digital tools. In addition, increasing health and social care staff\u2019s awareness of digital exclusion was also viewed as important in promoting inclusion. Conclusion: The research findings suggest that digital inclusion should be viewed as a wider determinant of health. Many of the identified consequences of exclusion are particularly important in relation to mental health and mental health recovery. This research suggests that identifying and addressing digital exclusion should be viewed as a priority for mental health services.\nKEYWORDS\ndigital, SMI, exclusion, health, inequalities\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "heading": "Background",
            "text": "The covid-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated the use and adoption of digital technology in health and social care services (1). In addition to video consultations, digital tools in health and care services can also include, the use of apps, wearable devices, smartphones for accessing health information and smart technology (Artificial Intelligence) (2). While there are many potential benefits from increased use of digital tools, including more rapid access to information and personalized care, more control, and empowerment (3), there is also an acknowledged risk of some people being excluded (4).\nThis is because, despite the pandemic and subsequent increased use of digital tools, 29% of the UK population still has \u201cvery low digital engagement (5).\u201d The UK consumer index measures digital engagement through establishing levels of engagement with a range of digital activities. Individuals with \u201cvery low digital engagement\u201d are generally not using digital tools such as email. This data is particularly relevant for those with severe mental illness, in light of both the documented benefits of self-management for this population (6), and aspirations for people to manage their own health through the use of digital tools (7). For those who are not able or willing to use digital tools in this way there may be a risk of being digitally excluded and not having the same opportunity (or parity) to utilise the benefits of digital tools for their health.\nDigital exclusion could lead to worse health outcomes through both indirect and direct routes (8). Direct routes relate to health services using digital technologies in ways some individuals cannot access and or benefit from. Indirect routes are related to the wider determinants of health, when, for example, housing or employment opportunities, become dependent on digital access routes (8). For people with severe mental illness (SMI), being digitally excluded could exacerbate existing health inequalities. Heath inequalities in people with SMI are driven by factors such as, diagnostic overshadowing (when new symptoms/physical health issues are wrongly attributed to the persons mental health condition), the link between mental illness and poverty, stigma, social isolation and a lack of support to access health and preventative care (9). In England, these inequalities contribute to people with SMI dying on average fifteen to twenty years earlier than the general population. The issue of digital exclusion impacting on people already at increased risk of health inequalities has been described as the \u201cdigital inverse care law\u201d with those who most need the benefits that come with digital health tools also being the least likely able to access it (3).\nWhen examining the reasons for digital exclusion, research by Borghouts et al. (10) found that people with SMI can experience additional barriers to engagement with digital tools associated with their mental health condition. For example, symptoms such as fatigue, paranoia and depression can make\nFrontiers in Digital Health 02\nconsistent engagement with digital tools more challenging. This further highlights the importance of exploring and addressing the needs of this population specifically, as they are likely to have different experiences and need a different type of digital support to other groups of people accessing health care.\nBerry et al. (11) conducted individual interviews with people living with SMI in 2016 focused on perceptions of self-guided interventions delivered via websites and smartphone apps. Within this research, participants, who reported good levels of digital literacy themselves, expressed concern that there were others who would not have the technology and skills needed to benefit from digital healthcare interventions. This suggests that digital exclusion is an area of importance for this population.\nWhen considering where the gaps in the research are, Helsper (12) concluded that research in to why or how individual\u2019s positions around digital exclusion might change is lacking. This was echoed in a scoping review of digital technology and health inequalities (8). This scoping review concluded that there is a need for further research into what factors influence engagement with digital health technology.\nIn addition, much of the research previously completed in the area of SMI and digital management of health was conducted prior to the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, considering digital exclusion and health in the context of the covid-19 pandemic is important due to the potential opportunities to use the findings to influence the delivery of mental health care services going forward. Publications such as, \u201cBuild back fairer: The covid-19 marmot review\u201d (13) have helped drive an increased recognition of inequalities and the impact of social determinants on health. The Marmot review provides the impetus for services to \u201cdo things differently\u201d and \u201cbuild back fairer\u201d when resuming services post covid. Therefore, this empirical research focused on two key areas, important in supporting mental health services to \u201cbuild back fairer\u201d; these are;\nTo understand experiences of digital exclusion and the\nimpact on health in people with SMI.\nTo explore the influences and mechanisms which would\nincrease engagement with digital health tools."

In addition, qualitative research is recognised as a valuable method in generating new knowledge in order to enhance evidence based healthcare design (16).\nEthical approval was obtained from University of Southampton, ERGO II number: 66928.There were two members of the research team with lived experience of severe mental illness who acted in an advisory (PPI) capacity.

Focus groups were selected primarily due to findings that focus groups can facilitate the sharing of sincere attitudes and beliefs due to their less formal nature, compared to one-toone interviews (18). The decision to run two focus groups was made to ensure that participants had long enough to discuss their views but also to mitigate against the potential impact of fatigue. All participants were made aware of the role of the researcher, (employed by Isle of Wight NHS Trust within a mental health clinical improvement role). They were also made aware that this research was conducted through a research initiation award with \u201cWessex Applied Research Collaboration\u201d with support from University of Southampton.\nEach focus group lasted approximately 45 minutes and was held at the community location, in a private space, that participants would usually meet to attend their mental health support group. Five participants attended the first group and four participants attended the second, one participant was not able to attend the second due to experiencing a deterioration in his mental health. Four participants met with the researcher to complete a 1:1 interview, these were offered to be inclusive of those participants who stated that they were not comfortable sharing their experiences in a group setting. The interviews lasted between 10 and 20 minutes and were completed at the location of the community support group (n = 3) and at the persons home address (n = 1).\nThe focus groups and interviews followed a topic guide (Supplementary Appendix B) which was developed for the study based on a review of the literature (10, 11, 12, 19).The topic guide was also discussed and agreed with the two members of the research team with lived experience of SMI. The first focus group asked participants about their experiences of digital exclusion and how digital exclusion has impacted on their health. The second focus group asked participants to discuss what might have to\nfrontiersin.org\nchange in their lives to enable increased use of digital tools and how any support needed in relation to this might be delivered.\nPrior to the focus group and interviews starting the lead researcher talked to participants and explained what is meant by the term digital tools and what this can include so all participants were interpreting this term in the same way."

Thematic analysis, as a six phased method (20), was used as the method for examining the perspectives of the research participants and identifying themes. The data was viewed from an interpretivist standpoint (21).\nFollowing audio transcription, the lead author listened back again to the recording while reading the transcript in order to familiarise themselves with the data. Initial coding was then completed, every line of the data was coded. While acknowledging the active role of the researcher and their epistemological position, social constructionism (21), an inductive approach to coding was taken, driven by the data. The next three steps involved theming the codes, then refining and naming the codes. Several thematic maps were generated as part of this refining process. Peer debriefing (22) was utilised throughout the coding and theming steps, with three members of the research team (NC, RE, LW). Once the themes were identified and named, member checking, checking the preliminary researcher findings and interpretations with the research participants, was completed with eight of the participants in order to generate the final themes and thematic map. Peer debriefing and member checking are recommended steps in achieving trustworthiness when using thematic analysis (22). These steps were also important elements of the process of engaging in reflexivity (23)."

            "text": "The data and themes from this study highlight the broad and complex relationship between digital exclusion and health. This relationship is particularly pertinent when viewed from a mental health recovery perspective (24). Three of the themes identified in this study, relating to social connectedness, perception of self and empowerment, are viewed as important components of mental health recovery. The acronym CHIME has been used to describe five components of personal (mental health) recovery, connectedness, hope and optimism about the future, identity, meaning in life and empowerment (24). The positive impact of belonging and meaningful connections on wellbeing and mental health in people with SMI was also highlighted by Barut et al. (25).\nParticipants discussed the value of their links with, and support from, offline communities, which may provide some of this belonging and connectedness and mitigate against the loss of social connectedness arising from digital exclusion. However, even with these offline connections, participants discussed difficulties forming or maintaining other connections when experiencing digital exclusion. The potential for digital exclusion to lead to a feeling of disconnect with wider society was evident through participants conveying a sense of \u201cus and them\u201d when discussing digital use.\nIn addition, there were concerns from participants that accelerated use of digital tools across society was leading to a loss of community infrastructure. The presence of local community infrastructure is known to be important in fostering a sense of belonging in the community. This has been found to be important in relation to promoting good health and mitigating against conditions such as, stress, depression, addiction, and chronic physical ill-health (26).\nThis experience of accelerated digital use in society and perceived loss of local community infrastructure, likely\nexacerbated by restrictions on social contact and mobility\nduring covid-19, may be leading to a sense of mistrust and\napprehension about engaging with digital tools. The areas\nmost likely to have seen the loss of community infrastructure\nare also areas with highest levels of social disadvantage, with\nsouthern coastal towns (this study was located in a Southern\nCoastal town) highlighted as being more likely to have areas\nof intense social deprivation compared with other parts of the\nUK (27). This is relevant to this research, given the location\nof the participants and the relationship between mental illness\nand poverty (28).\nParticipants discussed the feeling of stigma that comes from their mental health diagnosis. They also reported an additional\nlayer of stigma attributed to their digital exclusion. The\nanticipation of discrimination associated with stigma can lead\nFrontiers in Digital Health 09\npeople to use strategies of avoidance and concealment (29). This links with experiences relating to digital exclusion stigma described by participants in this study. For example, the participants talked of being reluctant to tell people they struggle with using technology and avoiding using it. This perceived stigma also appeared to create or exacerbate negative feelings about themselves, arising from not being able to access/use digital tools and the subsequent increased reliance on other people. This is important when considering impact on health, as a good quality of life in people with mental health problems has been found to be characterised by elements including control, autonomy and a positive selfperception (30). In contrast low control is associated with poorer health outcomes (13) and regular experiences of enacted or perceived stigma and self-stigmatising has been found to have a negative impact on areas including engagement with services and self-management (31).\nDigital inclusion is one aspect of life, and there are other influences on positive self-perception, belonging and control. However, participants did equate digital skill/access with concepts such as \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d while reporting that digital exclusion can result in a loss of choice and increased reliance on others. Therefore, supporting people to be in a position to make informed decisions about their level of digital engagement through addressing barriers could have a positive impact on perceived quality of life and on health more broadly.\nHealth is also influenced by social determinants and participants in this study discussed the ways in which being digitally excluded can negatively impact on this area. For example, they reported experiencing, delayed, altered or a lack of access to housing, employment, benefits and health services. This supports the model put forward by Davies et al. (3) outlining the ways that digital exclusion both directly and indirectly impacts on health inequalities and arguing for the need for digital exclusion to be recognised as a social determinant of health.\nMechanisms and influences of increased digital inclusion\nWhen discussing factors that may increase engagement with digital tools, participants echoed the need to consider factors identified in previous research such as cognitive difficulties associated with their mental health condition, financial barriers and the complexity of the digital tool (10, 11, 19). In addition to these several other factors were identified, including the importance of access within the local community and the presence and influence of digitally engaged peers.\nThe experiences and thoughts expressed by participants in this study indicated a strong feeling of connection with others experiencing severe mental illness. This connection appeared\nfrontiersin.org\nkey to influencing their possible future engagement with digital tools. Participants talked about the role of others with mental illness delivering digital skills support and the benefits of this in facilitating accessible digital skills support where mental health related reasonable adjustments are built into the design and delivery. Participants also talked about the role of others with mental illness, with higher levels of digital engagement, sharing their positive experiences as being a motivator to increasing their own level of digital engagement.\nThe importance of social referents supports the findings of Helsper (12) who discussed the importance of social identity and group comparisons in digital inequalities, with some individuals possibly viewing their digital exclusion as \u201cthe norm\u201d for them and those they view as their referents. This may then foster a feeling of acceptance of their current situation, reducing the individual\u2019s motivation to change. Mental health peer support is a recognised role in NHS mental health services, and there is evidence to support the positive impact this role can have on levels of hope, empowerment and quality of life (32). The provision of peer support in the area of mental health and digital skills support could be beneficial in building on the value of shared social identity as a way of increasing digital inclusion.\nParticipants stated that health and care professionals do not ask about their level of digital inclusion and as a result often make assumptions of digital access and competence. This may perpetuate a perception of stigma around digital exclusion and suggests that there is under recognition of digital exclusion within services. Recognising and identifying digital exclusion needs is an essential first step in increasing digital engagement.\nParticipants gave examples of how health services using digital tools flexibly, based on an individuals need, could have a positive impact on access to and engagement with services. For example, the use of text messaging to confirm appointments and or communicate basic health information. However, their experiences suggest that often the availability and implementation of digital tools can be too rigid meaning that the benefits of digital are not accessible to all.\nParticipants valued local community and connection with others, and described a perception that society\u2019s increased use of digital tools/services has contributed to a loss of local community infrastructure. Participants also reported they have not had the opportunity to learn and or maintain digital skills through education or employment. Therefore, local community based digital support services may provide a positive way of reinvigorating local highstreets and fostering a sense of belonging for local people. This could also provide opportunity to learn, refresh and maintain digital skills. The potential for this type of support to have a positive impact was highlighted by one participant who had received beneficial support characterised by \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cpatience\u201d from a digital support service at a bank. However, choice and\nFrontiers in Digital Health 10\ncontrol over how and where they use digital tools was seen as important with participants also discussing the need for this to be available in their own homes."

            "text": "This study was a small qualitative study, exploring the experiences of nine people with severe mental illness on the Isle of Wight. The small number of participants, somewhat limits the generalisation of findings across the whole population. However, there was a range of ages represented and mix of males and females. In addition, the findings from this study are in line with findings from other research carried out in the area of mental health and digital exclusion which adds to the validity of the findings.\nNearly all participants were recruited from the same mental health support group. This possibly enabled more open interaction within the focus groups as participants were familiar with each other. However, the homogenous geographical location may have an influence on the experiences of digital exclusion for this group of people.\nSome socio-demographic data was collected as part of this research (age, gender, employment status and education level). However, data aroundhousing status andethnicitywasnot collected.\nThis study looked specifically at the experiences of people digitally excluded, therefore it is not possible to draw conclusions relating to which factors in particular lead to some people with severe mental illness being digitally excluded and others not. However, it was noted during this study that none of the participants were currently in full or part time employment (although one person was on long term sick leave). Future research could look to establish the factors which influence digital engagement most within a population.\nFurther research would also be beneficial in evaluating the delivery of digital support, addressing areas raised in this research, and its impact on an individual\u2019s health. This is important in understanding the effectiveness of models for addressing digital exclusion and the impact on health."

            "text": "This study identified four overarching themes that relate to digital exclusion and health in people with severe mental illness: social connectedness, wider determinants of health, negative perception of self and disempowerment. These themes highlight the relationship between digital exclusion and health and support arguments that digital inclusion should be viewed as a social determinant of health. These themes appear particularly pertinent when viewed in the context of mental health and mental health recovery.\nfrontiersin.org\nThis suggests, that for mental health services, enabling informed choice around digital engagement should be viewed as an important part of their role in promoting good health. Addressing identified barriers to digital inclusion, through considering facilitators to engagement such as; access to local digital skills support with a mental health peer support component, awareness of digital exclusion amongst mental health staff and access to equipment and data. Furthermore, flexible and individualised use of digital tools by services should be viewed as a priority for mental health services."
