    "abstractText": "The emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and fungi represents a serious health problem worldwide. It has long been known that cationic compounds can inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi by disrupting the cell membrane. The advantage of using such cationic compounds is that the microorganisms would not become resistant to cationic agents, since this type of adaptation would mean significantly altering the structure of their cell walls. We designed novel, DBU (1,8diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene)-derived amidinium salts of carbohydrates, which may be suitable for disturbing the cell walls of bacteria and fungi due to their quaternary ammonium moiety. A series of saccharide-DBU conjugates were prepared from 6-iodo derivatives of D-glucose, D-mannose, Daltrose and D-allose by nucleophilic substitution reactions. We optimized the synthesis of a D-glucose derivative, and studied the protecting group free synthesis of the glucose-DBU conjugates. The effect of the obtained quaternary amidinium salts against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains and Candida albicans yeast was investigated, and the impact of the used protecting groups and the sugar configuration on the antimicrobial activity was analyzed. Some of the novel sugar quaternary ammonium compounds with lipophilic aromatic groups (benzyl and 2-napthylmethyl) showed particularly good antifungal and antibacterial activity.",

A less mentioned but at least as serious problem is that human pathogenic fungi can similarly become resistant to the antifungal agents used today [6]. The problem with the current treatment of bacterial and fungal diseases is that most of the drugs used affect the life cycle of microbes [7].

In terms of their chemical structure, the antifungal agents can be imidazole ring compounds, derivatives containing a triazole group or antimycotics with a special chemical structure. The first group includes clotrimazole (Figure 1) [11,12], which is a broad-spectrum drug. By inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergosterol, it changes the membrane composition of the fungal cell wall, which leads to permeability disturbances and then cell lysis. Fluconazole (Figure 1) is an antifungal medicine containing a triazole group that can be used orally, intravenously, and vaginally [13,14]. The disadvantage is that it also has a liver-damaging effect. Among the active substances with a special structure is flucytosine, [15,16] which can be administered both orally and intravenously. However, this compound can also have serious side effects such as bone marrow suppression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and psychosis. Terbinafine is an allylamine derivative with highly lipophilic properties, which also inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase, which plays an important role in the synthesis of the fungal cell wall [17,18].

Structure of some antifungal drugs and antifungal cationic ammonium derivatives including carbohydrates and surfactants.\nPositively charged structures can also have antibacterial and antifungal effects. Cationic ammonium surfactants, for example trimeric surfactant DTAD (tri(dodecyldimethylammonioacetoxy)diethyltriamine trichloride), excellently inhibits the growth of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, but has no effect on mammalian cells [21]. Furthermore, there exist carbohydrate derivatives conjugated with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), which also have both antifungal and antibacterial effects [22,23]. A general characteristic of these positively charged compounds is that they exert their effect by destroying the cell wall of fungi and bacteria and inhibiting synthesis [24\u201326]. As a result, resistance does not develop against them, or only with difficulty, and since they do not affect the life cycle of the microorganism, they can have a much longer effect. The presented examples clearly show that the cationic nature of compounds is always ensured by one or more quaternary nitrogen atoms, which is decisive in terms of biological activities.\nDuring our previous work, when we studied the elimination reaction of 6-iodo-hexopyranoside derivatives, completely new 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU)-conjugated quaternary amidinium salts were isolated as side products (I\u2013V, Figure 2) [27,28].\nFigure 1.

In the case of the D-allo derivative (31), using DABCO as the reagent, the quaternary ammonium salt (32) was formed exclusively (yield 86%), which could be explained by the greater nucleophilicity of DABCO relative to DBU. The fully ether-protected D-glucoside 4 gave the DBU conjugate in an acceptable yield, but in the presence of ester protecting groups (1, 5, 6), the yield of the amidinium salts was very low. We therefore attempted to increase the yield of the DBU-sugar conjugate 3 by shifting the DBU-mediated reaction of the ester-protected derivative 1 [28] towards nucleophilic substitution (Scheme 2). The optimization experiments are presented in Table 1. In our previous work, the reactions were carried out in tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is a preferred solvent for elimination [28].

Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 20\nIn the case of D-manno and D-altro configurations, the amidinium salts were formed with moderate yields (21, 22, 23, 24; 37, 38, 28\u201342%), while in the case of the D-allo configured saccharides, the nucleophilic substitution products (29, 30) were obtained in particularly high (63\u201376%) yields. In the case of the D-allo derivative (31), using DABCO as the reagent, the quaternary ammonium salt (32) was formed exclusively (yield 86%), which could be explained by the greater nucleophilicity of DABCO relative to DBU.\nThe fully ether-protected D-glucoside 4 gave the DBU conjugate in an acceptable yie d, but in the presenc of ester protecting groups (1, 5, 6), the yield of the amidinium salts was very low. We therefore attempted to increase the yield of the DBU-sugar conjugate 3 by shifting the DBU-mediated reaction of the ester-protected derivative 1 [28] towards nucleophilic substitution (Scheme 2). The optimization experiments are presented in Table 1. In our previous work, the reacti s were carried out in tetr hydrofuran (THF), which is a preferred solvent for lim nation [28].

TLC analysis was performed on Kieselgel 60 F254 (Merck) silica-gel plates with visualization by immersing in a sulfuric-acid solution (5% in EtOH) followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 (Merck 0.063\u20130.200 mm). Organic solutions were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum. 1H and J-modulated 13C NMR spectroscopy (1H: 400 and 500 MHz; 13C: 100.28 and 125.76 MHz) were performed on Bruker DRX-400 and Bruker Avance II 500 spectrometers at 25 \u00b0C (Bruker, Billerica, MA, US) Chemical shifts are referenced to SiMe4 or sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonate (DSS, \u03b4 = 0.00 ppm for 1H nuclei) and to residual solvent signals (CDCl3: \u03b4 = 77.16 ppm, CD3OD: \u03b4 = 49.15 ppm for 13C nuclei). You can find the NMR spectra of the new compounds in the supporting information. HRMS measurements were carried out on a maXis II UHR ESI-QTOF MS instrument (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) in positive ionization mode. The following parameters were applied for the electrospray ion source: capillary voltage: 3.6 kV; end plate offset: 500 V; nebulizer pressure: 0.5 bar; dry gas temperature: 200 \u00b0C; and dry gas flow rate: 4.0 L/min. Constant background correction was applied for each spectrum. The background was recorded before each sample by injecting the blank sample matrix (solvent). Na-formate calibrant was injected after each sample, which enabled internal calibration during data evaluation. Mass spectra were recorded by otofControl version 4.1 (build: 3.5, Bruker) and processed by Compass DataAnalysis version 4.4 (build: 200.55.2969).\n3.1.1. General Methods 1.

[49].\n3.2.1. Materials\nFor the antimicrobial studies, we used three human pathogens as test organisms: Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), Staphylococcus aureus subspecies aureus (ATCC 6538) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739). Staphylococcus aureus subspecies aureus and Escherichia coli were cultured on tryptic soya agar (TSA) for 18\u201324 h at 37 \u25e6C. Candida albicans was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for 18\u201324 h at 37 \u25e6C. To obtain cells for suspension, we made cell suspensions from Staph. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans with the cotton swab suspension technique. The dilution of suspension was then made with 0.85% NaCl solution, absorbance being set to A600nm = 0.06. a volume of 10 \u00b5L of these suspensions contained ~4.5\u20136.0 \u00d7 104 colony forming unit (CFU) (bacteria) and ~1.5\u20132.0 \u00d7 103 CFU for yeast. Tested agents were diluted with DMSO; the concentration of stock solutions was 4 mg/mL; and to ensure sterility, the closed sample containers were incubated at 35 \u25e6C for 1 h. The highest final concentration was 100 \u00b5g/mL.\n3.2.2. Methods\nTesting was performed in 24-well plates, and cell suspensions were prepared with 0.85% NaCl solution. Stock solutions were made from the agents with DMSO (100%). Final concentrations of used compounds were 6.25\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL. The activity of the three most effective antibacterial (10, 12 and 22) and antifungal (10, 22 and 29) compounds was also determined at lower concentrations (10\u00d7 diluted); the compounds were tested against S. aureus and C. albicans at the concentration range of 0.625\u201310.0 \u00b5g/mL. After inoculation, plates were incubated at 35 \u25e6C, and results were then read visually after 18\u201324 h. If microbial growth could not be detected, results were read visually after 72 h. If there was no growth after 72 h, incubation was continued till the fifth day of the experiment and the results were read visually and with plate reader at 600 nm after 120 h.\n3.2.3. Evaluation\nThe MIC value of a compound was defined as the minimal concentration that inhibits the growth of bacteria and yeasts comparing to the control. The results of the antibacterial\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3550 16 of 20\nand antifungal tests were read visually after 24, 48, 72 and 120 h. The microbial growth was measured by plate reader at 600 nm after 120 h. The IC50 value of a compound was defined as the concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50% relative to the control. After the MTT test, the medium containing the inhibitor was removed, and 10 \u00b5L MTT solution was added to the cells. The plates were then incubated for two hours at 37 \u25e6C. The medium from the wells was then carefully aspirated, and MTT formazan dissolved with 100 \u00b5L of DMSO aided by gentle agitation on a shaker. After 10 min at room temperature, the absorbances were read at 570 nm by an automatic plate reader. The percentage of viability reflecting the respiratory potential of the cell population in each well was expressed as (absorbance of treated cells/absorbance of control cells) \u00d7 100. IC50 values of tested agents were determined by Graphpad (Prism) semi-log line fitting (graphpad.com (8)) [50]. The MTT test was performed after treatment and removal of inhibitors followed by the addition of 10 \u00b5L of MTT solution to the cells."

After gently mixing, each mixture was incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 15 min. The released hemoglobin into the supernatant was separated by a rapid centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the absorbance of the released hemoglobin was measured at 540 nm using a Multiskan Go (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) microplate reader. The absorbance values were compared to the absorbance of the sample kept in purified water during the incubation as positive control and given as percent hemolysis [53]."

The membrane permeabilization ability of compounds 10 and 22 was tested on L. plantarum and determined in the brain heart infusion medium (BHI) (CliniChem Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). Bacterial cells were treated with the test compounds at the final concentration of 6.25 \u00b5g/mL and samples were taken at 1, 4, 8, 24 and 48 h. Samples were stained with SYTOX green fluorescent dye (ThermoFischer Scientific, Budapest, Hungary) at 1 \u00b5M final concentration for 30 min at 37 \u25e6C, and flow cytometric measurements were carried out with a Guava Easy Cyte 6HT-2L flow cytometer (Merck Ltd., Darmstadt, Germany). Green (525/30 nm) and red (695/50 nm) fluorescence channels were used to gate out the cells on a green versus red dot plot. The ratio of the SYTOX green (SG) positive bacterial cells was evaluated [54]."

            "text": "In the course of our research, we produced novel DBU-conjugated cationic carbohydrate derivatives from D-hexopyranosides of various configurations (D-gluco, D-manno, D-allo and D-altro). The -OH groups of carbohydrates were masked with benzyl, benzoyl and/or 2-naphthylmethyl protecting groups. By varying these protecting groups and free\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3550 17 of 20\nhydroxyls on the sugar unit, we were able to tune the lipophilicity of the molecules. A total of 13 fully protected and 9 partially or completely deprotected cationic sugar amidinium salts were prepared. We optimized the synthesis of a D-gluco-DBU conjugate, and attempted to produce carbohydrate amidinium derivatives without the use of protecting groups. The conjugation of the DBU unit to the sugar skeleton was carried out by nucleophilic substitution reactions on the fully protected 6-deoxy-6-iodohexopyranosides. The efficiency of the desired nucleophilic substitution was strongly dependent on the configuration of the sugar used due to competitive elimination reaction. We have found that the more the C-5 axial hydrogen of the carbohydrate is sterically hindered, the more favored the nucleophilic substitution reaction is. Accordingly, in the case of D-altro and D-allo configurations, where H-5 is sterically shielded, nucleophilic substitution was preferred, leading to the expected DBU-conjugated derivative in good yield. At the same time, in the case of the D-gluco and D-manno configurations, due to the good steric accessibility of H-5, elimination was the dominant reaction, and unfortunately the optimization experiments resulted in only a small, 7% increase in the yield of the DBU-conjugated glucoside. Our attempts to prepare unprotected DBU-sugar conjugates without the use of protecting groups failed. In the presence of free hydroxyls, intramolecular nucleophilic substitution took place in all investigated cases, resulting in the 3,6-anhydro derivative of the carbohydrate. Of the twenty-two compounds tested, nine showed promising activity against Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 6\u201325 \u00b5g/mL, and six compounds showed potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The biological results clearly show that protecting groups are necessary for antifungal and antibacterial activity and that ether protecting groups, especially naphthylmethyl ether, are more favorable than ester protecting groups. The most effective compounds turned out to be the most lipophilic derivatives of highest clogP containing only ether protecting groups. Presumably, the lipophilic units facilitate the incorporation of the compounds into the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and disrupt it. The positive results of membrane permeabilization experiments performed on a Gram-positive model bacterium with two active compounds (10 and 22) confirmed that the antimicrobial effect of our DBU-sugar conjugates may be related to their membrane-damaging ability. With the appearance of free hydroxyl groups, biological activity dropped drastically, and molecules containing more than one free hydroxyl group completely lost their activity. At the same time, the sugar configuration also plays a role in the effect, as evidenced by the ineffectiveness of the altro-configured compounds. We found that the pattern of the protecting group also affects the cytotoxic properties. Compounds containing an ester group on the molecule or containing a benzyl group in position 4 (3, 12 and 21) were cytotoxic on HaCaT cells. However, derivatives with exclusively ether groups on the molecule and a NAP group at position 4 (10, 22 and 29) showed a greatly reduced toxicity. The latter three compounds had the best antifungal effect. They act against fungi at concentrations lower than their cytotoxicity value, thus giving the opportunity to use these derivatives as antifungal agents in either oral or dermal antifungal preparations. However, this still requires further investigations. None of the 22 tested compounds had an effect against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) strain in the applied concentration range of 6.25\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL. Considering the cationic, membrane-active structure of our compounds, this is a surprising result and worthy of further investigation.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms24043550/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H. and A.B.; investigation, F.D., P.T., A.K., R.K.-O., V.B., Z.M.S., F.K., N.B., F.F., J.V. and M.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.D., A.K., Z.M.S., F.F., J.V., M.H. and A.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.D., A.K., Z.M.S., F.F., J.V., M.H. and A.B.; supervision M.H. and A.B.; funding acquisition, M.H. and A.B.
