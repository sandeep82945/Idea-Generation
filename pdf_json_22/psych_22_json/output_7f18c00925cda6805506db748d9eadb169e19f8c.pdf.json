    "abstractText": "Caregivers\u2019 language input supports children\u2019s language development, and it is often tuned to the child\u2019s current level of skill. Evidence suggests that parental input is tuned to accommodate children\u2019s expressive language levels, but accommodation to receptive language abilities is less understood. In particular, little is known about parental sensitivity to children\u2019s abilities to process language in real time. Compared to nonspectrum children, children on the spectrum are slower to process language. In this study, we ask: Do parents of autistic children and those of nonspectrum children tune their language input to accommodate children\u2019s different language processing abilities? Children with and without a diagnosis of autism (ages 2\u20136 years, N = 35) and their parents viewed a display of six images, one of which was the target. The parent labeled the target to direct the child\u2019s attention to it. We first examined children\u2019s language processing abilities by assessing their latencies to shift gaze to the labeled referent; from this, we found slower latencies in the autistic group than in the nonspectrum group, in line with previous findings. We then examined features of parents\u2019 language and found that parents in both groups produced similar language, suggesting that parents may not adjust their language input according to children\u2019s speed of language processing. This finding suggests that (1) capturing parental sensitivity to children\u2019s receptive language, and specifically language processing, may enrich our models of individual differences in language input, and (2) future work should investigate if supporting caregivers in tuning their language use according to children\u2019s language processing can improve children\u2019s language outcomes.",

Evidence suggests that\nparental input is tuned to accommodate children\u2019s expressive language\nlevels, but accommodation to receptive language abilities is less understood.\nIn particular, little is known about parental sensitivity to children\u2019s abilities to\nprocess language in real time. Compared to nonspectrum children, children\non the spectrum are slower to process language. In this study, we\u00a0ask: Do\nparents of autistic children and those of nonspectrum children tune their\nlanguage input to accommodate children\u2019s different language processing\nabilities? Children with and without a diagnosis of autism (ages 2\u20136 years,\nN = 35) and their parents viewed a display of six images, one of which was\nthe target. The parent labeled the target to direct the child\u2019s attention to it.\nWe\u00a0first examined children\u2019s language processing abilities by assessing their\nlatencies to shift gaze to the labeled referent; from this, we\u00a0 found slower\nlatencies in the autistic group than in the nonspectrum group, in line with\nprevious findings. We\u00a0 then examined features of parents\u2019 language and\nfound that parents in both groups produced similar language, suggesting\nthat parents may not adjust their language input according to children\u2019s\nspeed of language processing. This finding suggests that (1) capturing\nparental sensitivity to children\u2019s receptive language, and specifically language\nprocessing, may enrich our models of individual differences in language\ninput, and (2) future work should investigate if supporting caregivers in\ntuning their language use according to children\u2019s language processing can\nimprove children\u2019s language outcomes.\nKEYWORDS\nparent, caregiver, language, receptive language, autism, processing, eye-tracking\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 23 September 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.954983"

            "text": "Children learn the language or languages of their community by forming mental representations of the language they are exposed to. However, language input is not directly represented in children\u2019s minds but is instead filtered through their own cognitive skills and linguistic knowledge. Their intake of the input is therefore limited by their own abilities (e.g., Trueswell and Gleitman, 2007; Kidd et\u00a0al., 2013; Lidz and Gagliardi, 2014; Omaki and Lidz, 2015; He and Arunachalam, 2017; Arunachalam and Luyster, 2018; He, 2022). If, for example, parents produce language input that is too complex for the child\u2019s current abilities, the child may not benefit from it (e.g., He, 2022). Therefore, to best support intake, input must be\u00a0tuned to children\u2019s language abilities.\nThere is evidence of this kind of tuning (also called accommodation) in caregivers\u2019 language input. For instance, caregivers provide more complex linguistic input to children with larger expressive vocabularies or more advanced production of syntax than those with less advanced skills (e.g., Bernstein Ratner, 1984; Pan et\u00a0al., 2005; Bornstein et\u00a0al., 2007; Huttenlocher et\u00a0al., 2010). Leung et\u00a0al. (2021) found that parents adjust their way of speaking about animals based on their child\u2019s lexical knowledge. They provide longer referential expressions (e.g., \u201cthe spotted yellow leopard\u201d) if they report that the child does not yet produce the word than if they report that the child does produce the word (e.g., \u201cthe cat\u201d). This prior research, however, has focused primarily on children\u2019s expressive language levels. We\u00a0know much less about whether caregivers\u2019 language is tuned to children\u2019s language comprehension abilities. This is an important gap to fill, for two reasons. First, children\u2019s intake from the input is determined by their abilities to comprehend (not necessarily produce) the language they are exposed to. Second, language comprehension is harder to gauge in children; while parents know about children\u2019s expressive skills from what they say, receptive skills can only be\u00a0discerned indirectly, by observing behaviors such as whether children respond successfully to prompts (e.g., Tomasello and Mervis, 1994). If parents are less confident about what their child understands, they may have difficulty tuning their language input to their child\u2019s language comprehension abilities.\nOne recent study looked at parent tuning to children\u2019s receptive language: Arunachalam (2016) found that children processed noun phrases with postnominal modifiers (e.g., an umbrella with stripes) more quickly than those with prenominal modifiers (e.g., a striped umbrella), and correspondingly, parents more often labelled objects with postnominal modifiers, especially when the task was harder. This suggests that parents were attuned to what their child would find easier and more difficult to process and adjusted their language accordingly. The current study is a replication and extension of Arunachalam\u2019s (2016) work, and we\u00a0return to and describe it in more detail below. For the moment, we\u00a0address why language processing is particularly important to consider in this context.\nBy language processing, we\u00a0are referring to real-time language comprehension. This requires the child to access representations\nfor the words they hear, build a syntactic parse, and integrate this information with real-world knowledge about what the speaker is likely to be\u00a0speaking about. Language processing speed is typically measured by showing the child two pictures and labelling one of them (e.g., \u201cwhere\u2019s the cat?\u201d); the child\u2019s latency to look to the cat is taken as a measure of how quickly they have processed the auditory label and identified the correct referent (e.g., Fernald et\u00a0al., 2008b). Children who are faster to process the language they hear have larger vocabularies (e.g., Fernald et\u00a0al., 2006; Weisleder and Fernald, 2013) and have more opportunities to learn new words (e.g., Fernald et\u00a0al., 2008a; He et\u00a0al., 2020).\nFor some children, real-time language processing is a particularly difficult task. Children on the autism spectrum, for example, show slower language processing than their nonspectrum peers, both when the groups are matched on chronological age (e.g., Bavin et\u00a0al., 2014; Bavin and Baker, 2017) and when they are matched on language level on standard assessments (e.g., Ellis Weismer et\u00a0 al., 2016; Hartley et\u00a0 al., 2020). This suggests that language processing may be\u00a0particularly affected in autism above and beyond aspects of language that are measured on standard assessments, such as vocabulary size. Therefore, it may be\u00a0especially important for autistic1 children that their caregivers\u2019 language is tuned to their language processing abilities (e.g., Adamson et\u00a0al., 2009; Bottema-Beutel et\u00a0al., 2014; Yoder et\u00a0al., 2015; Fusaroli et\u00a0al., 2019). Perspectives from autistic adults are valuable for understanding the autistic experience of linguistic processing demands; one blogger writes on her blog \u201cMusings of an Aspie\u201d: \u201cI have all sorts of communication glitches. I\u00a0struggle with verbal instructions. If there\u2019s background noise or other distractions, my auditory processing lags to the point that it can take a few seconds to process speech from noise into words\u201d (Kim, 2013).\nIn the current study, we\u00a0 ask whether parents of autistic children, like the parents of nonspectrum children in Arunachalam (2016), tune their language input by producing language that is easier to process. We\u00a0chose this population for two additional reasons. First, some autistic children have relatively more impaired receptive language than expressive language (e.g., Artis and Arunachalam, submitted; Charman et\u00a0al., 2003; Luyster et\u00a0al., 2007; Ellis Weismer et\u00a0al., 2010; but see Kwok et\u00a0al., 2015). Second, just as language comprehension is difficult to measure in nonspectrum children because it relies on their response to prompts, the difficulty is amplified in autistic children, who are likely to show differences in social reciprocity and responsiveness (APA, 2013). Because of both of these factors, parents of autistic children may find it especially difficult to gauge\u2014and tune to\u2014 their child\u2019s language comprehension and processing abilities.\n1 Due to their ages, we\u00a0did not directly ask the participants in the study\nwhether they prefer to be\u00a0referred to as \u201cautistic\u201d or \u201con the spectrum\u201d (or\nsomething else), and so we\u00a0use both interchangeably throughout the\nmanuscript. We\u00a0use \u201cnonspectrum\u201d to indicate children whose parents\nreport that they are developing typically and do not have autism.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nIndeed, we\u00a0are not aware of any previous studies examining how parent language input is tuned to autistic children\u2019s language comprehension or language processing specifically. But there is an ample literature comparing caregiver language input provided to autistic children and input provided to nonspectrum children, which offers a relevant backdrop. In general, many of these studies report group similarities in the input: parents of autistic children use similar language as parents of nonspectrum children with respect to broad measures such as MLU, word tokens, word types, and lexical diversity (e.g., Swensen, 2007; Swensen et\u00a0al., 2007b; Warren et\u00a0al., 2010; Bang and Nadig, 2015; Nadig and Bang, 2017; Fusaroli et\u00a0al., 2019; see Bang et\u00a0al., 2019 for a review), at least when the groups are matched on expressive language level. Even with infants who have not (or yet) received an autism diagnosis but are at either higher or lower likelihood of receiving such a diagnosis based on whether they have an older autistic sibling, children in both groups receive a similar amount of infantdirected speech (see Woolard et\u00a0al., 2021 for a recent scoping review) and this input is similar in features such as number of word tokens and types (although by 18 months, infants with higher autism likelihood hear language with a lower MLU; Choi et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThese findings suggest a puzzle. Autistic children, who often have a different developmental profile (e.g., slower processing speed) may require different kinds of language input for optimal intake, and given parents\u2019 sensitivity to children\u2019s language abilities, we\u00a0might predict that parents would therefore provide different kinds of input. Indeed, when more specific parent language features are studied, group differences do appear. For example, parental input to autistic children (compared to that to nonspectrum children) contains fewer questions (e.g., Venuti et\u00a0 al., 2012; Goodwin et\u00a0 al., 2015; Luyster et\u00a0 al., 2022), fewer comments related to story characters\u2019 mental states (Slaughter et\u00a0 al., 2007), and more utterances differing in pragmatic appropriateness (Landa et\u00a0al., 1992; Losh et\u00a0al., 2008; Stern et\u00a0al., 2017). Moreover, because first-degree relatives of autistic individuals are more likely to have traits in the broader autism phenotype than the general population, some parents of autistic children also show some traits associated with autism that differ from parents of nonspectrum children. In particular, some of these parents use a slower speech rate and have prosodic characteristics associated with autism (e.g., Patel et\u00a0al., 2020).\nSome of these features of parent speech could facilitate language comprehension in autistic children. For example, differences in play behavior and responsiveness in autistic children may mean that some kinds of parent interaction and parent language input are more effective than they are for nonspectrum children (e.g., Haebig et\u00a0al., 2013; Bottema-Beutel et\u00a0al., 2014). Bani Hani et\u00a0al. (2013) found that when parents introduced novel words to their child, parents of children on the spectrum used multiple nonverbal cues (e.g., eye gaze, pointing) accompanying the new word, perhaps in order to maintain the child\u2019s attention given their knowledge of attentional differences in autistic children (generally) or their child (specifically). With infants, the\nreview paper mentioned above (Woolard et\u00a0al., 2021) also reported evidence of group differences in subtle behaviors\u2013\u2013parents of higher-likelihood and later-diagnosed children produce infantdirected speech with more attention bids and more follow-in commenting. They also use the infant\u2019s name more often (He et\u00a0al., 2018) and produce more gestures (Talbott et\u00a0al., 2015). All of these behaviors may help the parent get and maintain the child\u2019s attention, the importance of which has been noted elsewhere for both naturalistic and clinical settings (Constain et\u00a0al., 2018). Thus, previous findings are consistent with the hypothesis that parents of autistic children are sensitive to their child\u2019s attentional skills and tune their input accordingly.\nHowever, we\u00a0do not yet know the extent to which parental language input is specifically tuned to children\u2019s language processing abilities. Slower processing speed in children on the spectrum (e.g., Bavin et\u00a0al., 2014; Ellis Weismer et\u00a0al., 2016; Bavin and Baker, 2017; Hartley et\u00a0al., 2020; Horvath and Arunachalam, under revision) may mean that the best input for them is slower and/or consists of easier-to-process constructions (e.g., active instead of passive, e.g., Abbot-Smith et\u00a0al., 2017 and Messenger et\u00a0 al., 2011; or postnominal modifiers instead of prenominal modifiers, as we\u00a0investigate in the current study, e.g., Sekerina and Trueswell, 2012).\nTo summarize, past work suggests that there are both similarities and differences in the parental language input directed to autistic vs. non-spectrum children. However, one remaining gap that we\u00a0 think is particularly important is whether (and if so, how) the input might be\u00a0 tuned to children\u2019s real-time language processing.\nIn the current study, we\u00a0ask whether parents\u2019 language input is tuned to autistic children\u2019s real-time language processing abilities by replicating and extending a study with nonspectrum children by Arunachalam (2016). In that study, parent\u2013child dyads played a finding game. On each trial of the game, an array of six pictures was displayed on an eye-tracking monitor. The parent was directed to describe one of them so that their child could identify it. Parents were not told what to say, only which picture they should talk about. Arunachalam examined both children\u2019s speed of looking to the target\u2014their language processing speed, a real-time index of language comprehension\u2014and features of parental language input. Task difficulty was manipulated across two conditions2. In the Hard condition, the target object had a competitor in the display from the same basic-level category that differed in some salient property (e.g., two books: one open, one closed). In the Easy condition, there were no competitor objects from the same basic-level category. In the Hard condition, parents would have to use a more complex referential expression to label the object (e.g., \u201cthe open book\u201d or \u201cthe book that\u2019s open\u201d); in the Easy condition, although parents were still free to use those\n2 Note that Arunachalam (2016) referred to these conditions as \u201cSame\u201d\nand \u201cDifferent\u201d; for ease of comprehension, we\u00a0have changed them to\n\u201cHard\u201d and \u201cEasy,\u201d respectively.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\ncomplex expressions, the additional modifiers would be\u00a0unnecessary for target identification.\nA large psycholinguistics literature establishes that young children can process noun phrases incrementally and can correctly interpret modifiers as disambiguating information when multiple objects from the same category are present. This holds not only for nonspectrum children (e.g., Thorpe and Fernald, 2006; Fernald et\u00a0al., 2010; Huang and Snedeker, 2013; Davies et\u00a0al., 2021), but also for children on the spectrum (e.g., Bavin et\u00a0al., 2016; Bavin and Baker, 2017). Thus, Arunachalam\u2019s (2016) method applies well to autistic children. In the current study, we\u00a0therefore replicate and extend this study, focusing on autism, with nonspectrum children as a comparison.\nWith respect to children\u2019s processing, Arunachalam (2016) found that children had shorter latencies to look to the target, that is, they were faster to process the parent\u2019s referential expression, in the Easy condition than in the Hard condition. In the current study, we\u00a0predict the same to be\u00a0true for both the nonspectrum and autistic groups. Further, we\u00a0expect children in the autistic group to be\u00a0slower overall than those in the nonspectrum group, reflecting the slower language processing speeds found throughout the literature.\nWith respect to parental input, Arunachalam (2016) examined two main features: speech rate and type of referential expression. Because a slower speech rate can better support children\u2019s language comprehension, particularly in difficult tasks (e.g., Haake et\u00a0al., 2014), she expected a between-condition difference\u2013\u2013slower speech rate in the Hard condition than the Easy condition. But this hypothesis was not borne out. However, in the current study with two groups of children\u2013\u2013autistic and nonspectrum, given their differences in processing speeds, there might still be\u00a0 a between-group difference (despite a potential lack of betweencondition difference)\u2013\u2013specifically, it might be\u00a0 the case that parents of children on the spectrum would use a slower rate (than parents of nonspectrum children) in order to accommodate their slower processing speeds.\nWith respect to type of referential expression, Arunachalam (2016) coded whether parents labeled the target object with just a content noun (e.g., \u201cthe book\u201d) or whether they added modifiers, and if the latter, whether the modifiers appeared before the noun (e.g., \u201cthe open book\u201d) or after it (e.g., \u201cthe book that\u2019s open\u201d). Prenominal modifiers have been shown to be\u00a0difficult for children to process (e.g., Sekerina and Trueswell, 2012; Huang and Snedeker, 2013; Arunachalam, 2016; but see Davies et\u00a0al., 2021) and so postnominal modifiers should be\u00a0 preferable. What Arunachalam (2016) found was that parents did produce more postnominal modifiers, but only in the Hard condition\u2014when the child\u2019s task was more difficult, parents alleviated the difficulty by producing an easier-to-process referential expression. In the Easy condition, parents appeared less concerned about processing difficulty; even though modifiers were unnecessary to uniquely identify the referent (e.g., there was only one book in the display), parents did sometimes produce modifiers, and half of these were prenominal as compared to postnominal. This is interesting given\nthat unnecessary modifiers increase processing load, even in adults (e.g., Engelhardt et\u00a0al., 2006, 2011) as well as in children (e.g., He et\u00a0al., 2020). Based on these findings, for the current study, we\u00a0predict that parents will use more postnominal modifiers in the Hard condition than the Easy condition. This betweencondition difference might be\u00a0larger for the autistic group than the nonspectrum group, due to autistic children\u2019s slower processing. Further, given that unnecessary modifiers also place an additional processing burden on the child, we\u00a0predict that parents of autistic children will produce fewer unnecessary modifiers (i.e., fewer modifiers in the Easy condition) than parents of nonspectrum children.\nFinally, we\u00a0included exploratory analyses relating children\u2019s processing to features of parents\u2019 referential expressions. These analyses are exploratory because the number of data points of each type is unequal, and determined by parents\u2019 referential choices. However, the findings provide hypotheses to test in future controlled experiments. Specifically, we\u00a0 examine whether children\u2019s latencies to look to the target are predicted by the parents\u2019 choice to include unnecessary modifiers in the Easy condition, as well as whether they are predicted by modifier position (prenominal or postnominal) in either condition.\nTo summarize, our goal in the present study was to replicate Arunachalam\u2019s (2016) work with nonspectrum children and their parents, and to extend it to autistic children and their parents. Our overarching hypotheses were that we\u00a0 would replicate prior findings that autistic children are slower to process language than their nonspectrum counterparts, and that their parents would tune to this difference in processing speed by producing easier-toprocess language: slower, with fewer modifiers, and with postnominal rather than prenominal modifiers.\nLike Arunachalam (2016), we\u00a0focused on young children (i.e., preschool and early school-aged), who are old enough to understand the task. Several studies have assessed online language processing in autistic children or children with an older autistic sibling in this age group (e.g., Swensen et\u00a0al., 2007a; Venker et\u00a0al., 2013; Brady et\u00a0al., 2014; Chita-Tegmark et\u00a0al., 2015; Horvath et\u00a0al., 2018; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2019). Further, this age group is optimal for studying language input and intake in parent\u2013child dyads because these children are young enough that parents are still an important source of language input but old enough that parents have had ample time to observe their child\u2019s language growth and evaluate their expressive and receptive language skills."

Participants were primarily recruited from the greater Boston area in the United\u00a0 States using online advertisements and our lab\u2019s databases of families who expressed interest in participating in research. Some children in the autistic\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\ngroup were recruited through the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge (SPARK) database (SPARK Consortium, 2018). All recruitment and testing procedures were approved by Boston University\u2019s Institutional Review Board. A total of 20 autistic children (3 female, 17 male) and 15 nonspectrum children (8 female, 7 male) were included in the final sample. In each group, three of the participating parents were male; the rest were female. Six additional children participated in at least some elements of the study protocol but were excluded from the final sample: 4 had been assigned to the autistic group based on parent report of an autism diagnosis but failed to meet diagnostic criteria during the study (see below); 1 had been assigned to the nonspectrum group but scored above the autism threshold on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ, see below); and 1 (in the autistic group) was unwilling to complete the experimental task.\nThe autistic group\u2019s mean age was 4:9 (range 3:6 to 6:10) and the nonspectrum group\u2019s mean age was 3:6 (range 2:1 to 4:5). We\u00a0intentionally recruited nonspectrum children at younger ages to yield two groups that did not significantly differ on language or cognitive ability (see below). In both groups, dyads were included if parents reported that children were English learners with no more than 30% exposure to another language and had no known developmental disorders aside from either autism (for the autistic group) or those that are often comorbid with autism such as ADHD.\nFor the autistic group, diagnosis was confirmed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition (ADOS-2; Lord et\u00a0al., 2012), the gold standard diagnostic instrument for autism spectrum disorder, by a research-reliable examiner. The ADOS-2 is appropriate for children with a chronological and developmental age of at least 12 months through adults. None of the participating parents nor other adults in their household selfreported as being on the spectrum.\nFor the nonspectrum group, we\u00a0used the SCQ (Rutter et\u00a0al., 2003) to confirm via parent report that the child was not exhibiting features indicative of autism. This questionnaire is normed for children 48 months and older, but it has been widely used with younger children (e.g., Marvin et\u00a0al., 2017). Following Corsello et\u00a0al. (2007), we\u00a0used a threshold of \u226515 for children 48 months (and older) and a downward adjustment to \u226512 for younger children. All 15 nonspectrum children included in the final analyses scored below the relevant cutoff. None of the nonspectrum children were reported to have a household member with autism.\nTo obtain a picture of children\u2019s language and developmental profiles and to ensure that the two groups did not significantly differ from each other, we\u00a0 asked parents to complete the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory II Short Form A: Words and Sentences for expressive vocabulary (Fenson et\u00a0al., 2007; three nonspectrum children did not have MCDI scores). This form is designed for typically-developing children ages 16\u201330 months; however, the publishers note that it \u201cmay be\u00a0used with older, developmentally-delayed children\u201d (CDI\nAdvisory Board, n.d.) and many studies do so (e.g., Hambly and Fombonne, 2012; Robertson et\u00a0 al., 2017; Arunachalam et\u00a0 al., 2022). We\u00a0also note that neither group was at ceiling (see Table\u00a01). Most children also completed the Visual Reception, Receptive Language, and Expressive Language subscales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL; Mullen, 1995; due to scheduling difficulties, 1 autistic child and 4 nonspectrum children did not complete the MSEL). The MSEL is designed for children from birth to 68 months. The Visual Reception subscale serves as a rough proxy for nonverbal cognition, while the Receptive and Expressive Language scales serve as an additional measure of language level. T-tests showed no between-group differences on any of the scores: MCDI expressive vocabulary, MSEL Visual Reception, MSEL Receptive Language, MSEL Expressive Language (all ps greater than 0.1). See Table\u00a01. Unsurprisingly given the heterogeneity of the autistic population, the standard deviations were larger for the autistic group than the nonspectrum group. Some of the children also participated in an unrelated experimental task (Clancy et\u00a0al., 2019)."

            "text": "The experimental task had 16 trials and 2 conditions, both within-subjects. On each trial, an array of 6 images arranged in 2 rows of 3 was shown (see Figure\u00a01). Each image was contained in an invisible square measuring 570 pixels (px) \u00d7 410 px, with 65 px of white space between the columns and 255 px of white space between the rows. The images were similar to those used by Arunachalam (2016). To control somewhat for perceptual and conceptual complexity, we\u00a0used clip-art images of highly familiar objects, animals, and people. In pilot work for this study, these images elicited referential expressions from parents that were similar to those in Arunachalam (2016) and that successfully and uniquely identified the target referent.\nThe two conditions, Hard and Easy, each had 8 trials. In the Hard condition, trials were characterized by having one pair of images from the same basic-level category but differing in some salient property (e.g., two stars, one red and one blue); one of these objects was the target. In the Easy condition, trials had no distractor objects from the same basic-level category as the target, and there were no pairs from the same basic-level category within the distractors. See Figure\u00a01 for a sample trial.\nAll of the target images depicted common household objects, people, and animals; see Supplementary Materials for a full list. The properties on which the two competitor objects differed included color (e.g., red, blue) and size (e.g., big, small) as well as other properties that were easily discernible from the images (e.g., open, closed; asleep, awake; spotted, striped). Although parents were free to use any kind of modifiers they wished to describe the objects, the most salient property differences were describable by adjectives that children at this age would know. These included adjectives denoting color and size concepts (e.g., red, big). Note that particular modifiers may differ in whether they are more\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nlikely to be\u00a0used prenominally than postnominally (e.g., color adjectives almost universally appear prenominally in English; Thorpe and Fernald, 2006). However, because our goal is to investigate differences between the Hard and Easy conditions, we\u00a0were not concerned about potential differences at the level of individual modifiers.\nThe stimuli were presented on a Tobii T60XL eye-tracker sampling at 60 Hz, operating Tobii Studio software. Children sat in a car seat 20 in. in front of the eye-tracking monitor. The parent sat next to the child, approximately 3 feet away, and wore laser safety glasses that blocked the near-infrared wavelengths used to detect gaze but not shorter wavelengths. The parent could therefore see the screen, but their own gaze was not tracked."

            "text": "The visit began with children playing with toys and parents completing paperwork, including providing informed consent on behalf of themselves and their child. The instructions were administered as in Arunachalam (2016). First, the experimenter explained to the parent that the dyad would see six images on the computer screen and the parent\u2019s job was to get the child to identify the target image as quickly as possible. The parent was told they would need to describe the target image so that their child could identify it. The parent was instructed that they could say whatever they wanted to encourage their child to identify the correct image, but that because it was a guessing game, they could\nnot point or use their hands. We\u00a0explained that each of the 6 possible image locations was numbered, and for each trial, we\u00a0would indicate to the parent which image was the target on each trial by referring to its numbered location.\nThen, the parent and child entered the testing room, where the child was seated in front of the eye-tracker and the parent next to the child. The child first underwent a 5-point calibration procedure using Tobii Studio software. Before each trial, the experimenter, who sat behind and to the side of the parent, out of view of the child, held up a card depicting six numbers arranged in a two-by-three grid (from left to right: top row 1, 2, 3; bottom row 4, 5, 6). The same grid appeared on the computer screen, but displaying images instead of numbers, with each image on the screen corresponding to one number on the card. When the experimenter pointed to a number on the card, the parent thus knew which image was the target image on that trial, but the child, who could not see the card with the numbers, did not know. Therefore, parents were not told what to say, only which picture they should talk about.\nOn each trial, the experimenter operating the eye-tracking software from behind a curtain advanced the display so that the array of images was shown. The experimenter waited approximately 5 s to allow both the parent and child to examine the images and then showed the parent a new card with the target image\u2019s number, after which the parent described the image that corresponded to the number. Children were not required to point to the image, as we\u00a0were concerned that some autistic children might not point (and several in fact did not); if they did not point, the experimenter waited approximately 10 s or until the parent asked to move to the next trial. The duration of the task differed depending on how much or little the parent said, but the average duration was 7 min 46 s (sd = 163 s) for the autistic group and 6 min 46 s (sd = 120 s) in the nonspectrum group.\nAfter the experimental task, most children completed the subscales of the MSEL with a trained researcher. Children in the autistic group only were administered the ADOS-2 to confirm autism diagnosis on a second visit to the lab, approximately 1 week later."

The target image was the open book, top row middle.\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nChildren\u2019s processing. Following past work in the language processing literature with both children on the spectrum and nonspectrum children (e.g., Fernald et\u00a0al., 2008a; Venker et\u00a0al., 2013), we\u00a0 used latency to look to the target as an index of processing speed. That is, we\u00a0 measured how quickly children shifted their eye gaze toward the target image from the offset of the referential expression produced by the parent\u2013\u2013for instance, upon hearing \u201cLook at the bear who\u2019s sleeping,\u201d how much time elapsed before the child\u2019s first look toward the image of the sleeping bear. Following Arunachalam (2016), latencies were calculated from the offset of the referential expression, but negative latencies (i.e., looks after the onset but before the offset of the expression) were included (only one negative latency occurred in the final data set). (See more about referential expression coding below.) A look was defined as three consecutive frames for which the child\u2019s gaze fell within the target area of interest (i.e., one of the six invisible squares); the first of these frames was used to calculate latency.\nFor gaze analysis, we\u00a0 excluded children and trials with excessive track loss (i.e., sampled frames without gaze coordinates, due to blinks or excessive movement). We\u00a0first excluded children with 65% or more track loss across the entire experiment (4 children from the autistic group) and then excluded individual trials from the remaining children with 65% or more track loss (autistic, 48 trials; nonspectrum, 11 trials). We\u00a0further excluded trials on which children did not look at the target at all before the trial ended (autistic, 8 trials; nonspectrum, 13 trials). Finally, we\u00a0excluded from this analysis trials on which parents\u2019 referential expressions were not codable, as discussed below. Therefore, the final sample for eye gaze analyses included 203 trials from 16 autistic children and 194 trials from 14 nonspectrum children.\nTo analyze children\u2019s gaze, we\u00a0conducted linear mixed-effects regressions with the lme4 package version 1.1.28 (Bates et\u00a0al., 2015) in R version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2016). The lmerTest package version 3.1.3 (Kuznetsova et\u00a0al., 2017) provided p-values, using t-tests fit by Satterthwaite\u2019s method. Pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means were used to examine significant interactions using the emmeans package version 1.7.4\u20131 (Lenth, 2022). Figure\u00a02 was made using the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2009). The goal of these analyses was to understand whether autistic children were slower to process their parents\u2019 referential expressions than nonspectrum children, whether children were slower in the Hard condition than the Easy condition, and whether there was an interaction between group and condition such that autistic children had particularly long latencies in the Hard condition. Because groups differed significantly on chronological age (although they did not differ significantly on language or cognitive measures), we\u00a0included age as a fixed factor in the analyses.\nParents\u2019 input. For analyses of parental input, parents\u2019 speech was first transcribed by a trained experimenter and coded by two trained coders using Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2020). Then, speaking rate and referential expression choices were analyzed. Speaking rate was calculated by dividing the referential expression\nduration (in seconds) by the number of syllables it contained. Referential expression durations were the period of time from the onset and offset of the referential expression. For referential expression choices, we\u00a0specifically coded whether a referential expression was modified or not\u2013\u2013in particular, to what extent unnecessary modification (i.e., overmodification) was used; and for modified, where the modifiers were positioned (i.e., before or after the noun).\nReferential expressions were defined as a noun plus any modifiers from any syntactic category (excluding determiners, because preliminary coding showed that it was difficult to code their onset reliably given their brief duration). Examples of referential expressions produced by parents included: \u201clittle piano,\u201d \u201cbook that\u2019s open,\u201d \u201cdoll in a pink dress,\u201d \u201cgreen hat with green dots on it.\u201d Note that we\u00a0included modifying information as part of the referential expression whether or not it was critical for identifying the target (that is, the offset of entire phrase, \u201cgreen hat with green dots on it,\u201d was used even if there was only one hat in the display).\nFor this analysis, we\u00a0excluded trials on which parents produced referential expressions that could not be\u00a0coded (31 trials in the autistic group, 24\u00a0in the nonspectrum group). These were trials on which the parent made a reference that was specific to their family (e.g., \u201cWhich one is Aunt Debbie\u2019s favorite?\u201d), trials on which the parent spoke about the incorrect target image, and trials in the Hard condition on which the parent did not provide sufficient disambiguating information to uniquely identify the target (e.g., saying \u201cWhere\u2019s the book?\u201d when there were two books in the array). One parent in the nonspectrum group produced only referential expressions of the family-specific type and this dyad was therefore excluded from all analyses. The final sample for parent speech analyses included 278 trials from all 20 parents of autistic children and 202 trials from 14 parents of nonspectrum children.\nFIGURE\u00a02 Violin plot depicting mean latency by participant of first look to the target, in ms, by group and condition.

Across all trials, mean speaking rate was 0.39 syllables per second for parents of autistic children (sd = 0.77) and 0.33 for parents of nonspectrum children (sd = 0.20). A linear mixed-effects model with speaking rate as the dependent measure, participant and trial as random factors, and group (autistic vs. nonspectrum) as a fixed factor (contrast coded as described above for child gaze analyses) revealed no main effect of group (\u00df = 0.068, p = 0.27).\nReferential expression choices\u2013\u2013Overmodification. In the Easy condition, where modifiers were not needed in order to specifically identify the target, parents nevertheless often produced unnecessary modifiers (replicating Arunachalam, 2016). For the autistic group, parents did so on 51% of trials, and for the nonspectrum group, 60%. Although this numerical difference between the groups was in the predicted direction (that is,\nwe\u00a0expected that parents of autistic children to more actively avoid overmodification in order to reduce the child\u2019s processing burden on the child), it was not statistically significant (Fisher\u2019s exact test p = 0.20).\nReferential expression choices\u2013\u2013Modifier position. Recall that we\u00a0predicted that parents would use more postnominal modifiers in the Hard condition than the Easy condition, and that this between-condition difference might further be\u00a0 larger for the autistic group. The proportion of modifiers that were postnominal as compared to prenominal (excluding trials on which no modifiers were produced or on which both pre- and postnominal modifiers were produced) for each condition and group is shown in Table\u00a0 2. As predicted, more postnominal modifiers were produced in the Hard than the Easy condition in both groups, and Fisher\u2019s exact tests demonstrate that the difference in pre- vs. postnominal modifiers between conditions is significant for the autistic group (p =\u00a0 0.008) but not for the nonspectrum group (p = 0.3). Thus, the results suggest that parents of autistic children may be\u00a0particularly sensitive to the difficulty of the Hard condition as compared to the Easy condition.\nExploratory comparisons linking child latencies and parent input characteristics\nBecause parental input was unscripted, we\u00a0 do not have balanced numbers of trials with different parent input features. Therefore, we\u00a0cannot robustly analyze how specific parent input features might be\u00a0 associated with children\u2019s processing. Nevertheless, to provide a basis for future work, we\u00a0conducted some exploratory analyses. First, for the Easy condition, we\u00a0 compared latencies by whether the parent produced an unnecessary modifier (autistic group mean = 724 ms, sd = 969 ms; nonspectrum group mean = 318 ms, sd = 824 ms) or did not (autistic group mean = 1,093 ms, sd = 1,602 ms; nonspectrum group mean = 712 ms, sd = 1,727 ms). The number of data points in each of these cells is small and unequal, given that it depended on what parents chose to produce rather than our own manipulation (but recall that the use of unnecessary modifiers was relatively balanced; 51% for the autistic group and 60% for the nonspectrum group). Examining this pattern statistically, with latency as dependent measure, random effects of participant and trial, and fixed effects of group and modifier use and their interaction, we\u00a0found no significant effects of group (\u03b2 = 391.51, p = 0.13) or modifier use (\u03b2 = \u2212302.92, p = 0.10), and no significant\nTABLE\u00a02 Proportion of modifiers that were postnominal as compared to prenominal produced by parents by condition and group (trials with no modifiers or with both pre- and postnominal modifiers were excluded).\nGroup Hard condition Easy condition\nAutism 0.31 0.13\nNonspectrum 0.26 0.18\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\ninteraction (\u03b2 = \u2212121.59, p = 0.73). This suggests that unnecessary modifiers did not substantially decrease processing efficiency.\nWe also examined latencies in the Easy and Hard conditions by whether the modifier, when present, occurred prenominally or postnominally. Again, this analysis is exploratory and limited by the number of data points per cell, which is uneven and very small in some cases. See Table\u00a03. Like Arunachalam (2016), postnominal latencies were shorter than prenominal for the nonspectrum group in both conditions. However, this pattern did not hold for the autistic group. A model with latency as dependent measure, random effects of participant and trial, and fixed effects of group and modifier position and their interaction revealed a significant effect of group (\u03b2 = 1096.53, p = 0.005), and of modifier position (\u03b2 = 675.04, p = 0.048) and their interaction (\u03b2 = 1861.72, p = 0.006). (We did not include condition in this model because both conditions showed the same pattern and we\u00a0did not want to overfit the model.) We\u00a0further explored the interaction with pairwise comparisons of the estimated marginal means, which revealed that the difference in latencies between modifier positions was significant for the autistic group (t(254.6) = \u22123.35, p = 0.005) but not the nonspectrum group (t(255.8) = 0.52, p = 0.95).\nThis intriguing difference suggests that prenominal modifiers are more supportive than postnominal modifiers for comprehension for autistic children, contrary to what prior research has shown for nonspectrum children (and contrary to the trend, though not significant, for nonspectrum children in the current study); thus, they may benefit from different kinds of linguistic contexts for referential expressions than nonspectrum children."

            "text": "To understand children\u2019s language development, it is important to consider not only the language input they experience but also their intake from that input. The goals of the current study were to assess intake by measuring children\u2019s comprehension of their parents\u2019 language and to explore how parents might tune their speech to make the task of language comprehension easier for their child. We\u00a0compared these features across groups, evaluating autistic and nonspectrum preschoolers, because for children on the spectrum, differences in understanding and making use of social cues, as well as less robust linguistic skill and slowed processing, may mean that they process less of the language input directed to them and/or may process language more slowly (e.g., Arunachalam and Luyster, 2016, 2018; Crandall et\u00a0al., 2019). Although parents have been shown to tune their language input to their child\u2019s expressive language, we\u00a0suggested that they may be\u00a0 less attuned to their child\u2019s real-time language processing skills, and therefore less able to tune their language input to support comprehension specifically.\nChild\u2013parent dyads played a game in which the parent verbally labelled one image from an array and the child\u2019s task was to identify the correct image as quickly as possible. Children\u2019s gaze was tracked while they participated. This paradigm allowed us to analyze children\u2019s language processing and features of the parents\u2019 language input in the same setting and in real time. Specifically, we\u00a0examined features of parent language input when labeling the image, how quickly children looked to the correct referent, whether these two measures were related, and whether these patterns differed for autistic children as compared to nonspectrum children.\nThe primary findings were twofold. First, language processing speed in the autistic group was significantly slower than in the nonspectrum group. This finding is consistent with prior reports that language processing as measured in a variety of tasks, with and without eye-tracking, is on average slower in autistic children (e.g., Bavin et\u00a0al., 2014; Ellis Weismer et\u00a0al., 2016; Bavin and Baker, 2017; Marini et\u00a0al., 2020). The current study further adds evidence that the difference in processing speed occurs even with unscripted speech from a speaker the child is very familiar with (as compared to pre-recorded speech streams typically used in eye-tracking studies).\nSecond, parents of autistic children did not significantly differ from parents of nonspectrum children on any of the measured language properties: speaking rate, use of unnecessary modifiers in their referential expressions (just over half the time), or position of those modifiers (which were primarily prenominal, but less so in the Hard condition than the Easy condition). The literature is mixed on whether parent language input differs to children on and off the spectrum (see, e.g., Bang et\u00a0al., 2019; Woolard et\u00a0al., 2021 for two recent reviews). The current study provides another finding to add to this literature from a specific situation\u2014we suggest that when it comes to labelling a single image from an array in a finding game, parents of autistic children do not differ from parents of nonspectrum children in the rate of delivery or kind of language they use.\nTABLE\u00a03 Children\u2019s mean latency to look at the target by group, condition, and modifier position (trials with no modifiers or with both pre- and postnominal modifiers were excluded).\nGroup Condition Modifier position Number of data\npoints\nMean latency, ms (sd)\nAutism Hard Post 26 3,105.23\n(6,148.79)\nAutism Hard Pre 71 1,112.23\n(1,795.23)\nNS Hard Post 24 721.58\n(962.93)\nNS Hard Pre 63 994.32\n(2,058.98)\nAutism Easy Post 8 957.88\n(883.31)\nAutism Easy Pre 41 608.59\n(910.67)\nNS Easy Post 9 117.78\n(346.08)\nNS Easy Pre 41 388.17\n(974.36)\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nTaken together, the results suggest that although there is a group difference between nonspectrum and autistic children in language processing speed, the language input of parents of autistic children is not adapted specifically to support slower processing. This is not to say that parents are not aware of their child\u2019s language abilities or that their input is not tuned in other ways; indeed, parents of children on the spectrum are very sensitive to their child\u2019s language development and often delays in language are the parent\u2019s first indicator that their child might need an autism evaluation (e.g., Chawarska and Volkmar, 2007; Garrido et\u00a0al., 2018). Moreover, in the current study, parent input was adapted to the difficulty of the task across both nonspectrum and autistic groups. Specifically, in the harder condition in which there were competitor objects (the Hard condition), parents were more likely to place modifiers postnominally than in the easier condition in which there were no competitors from the same category (the Easy condition). Therefore, although parent speech is adapted to support children\u2019s processing, it is not differentially so for nonspectrum versus autistic children.\nMoreover, although we\u00a0interpret this finding cautiously due to the nature of the experimental design\u2014the number of relevant data points is constrained by what parents choose to produce\u2014 our exploratory analyses suggest children on the spectrum may benefit from different kinds of referential expressions than nonspectrum children. Specifically, while nonspectrum children showed a trend toward faster latencies with referential expressions that had postnominal rather than prenominal modifiers, and this is consistent with Arunachalam (2016), autistic children showed a significant difference in the opposite direction\u2014they were faster with prenominal than postnominal modifiers.\nIn what follows we\u00a0turn to how these findings contribute to the literature, theoretically and methodologically."

            "text": "It is well established that the trajectory of a child\u2019s development of language has many influences, including bidirectional influences between parent and child language, even beginning in infancy, and in autism as well as nonspectrum development (e.g., Huttenlocher et\u00a0 al., 2010; Bani Hani et\u00a0 al., 2013; Warlaumont et\u00a0al., 2014; Wu and Gros-Louis, 2014; Yurovsky, 2018; Fusaroli et\u00a0al., 2019; Choi et\u00a0al., 2020; Odijk and Gillis, 2020; Quigley and Nixon, 2020; Leung et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, in a longitudinal study, Fusaroli et\u00a0al. (2019) found reciprocal associations between child and parent language in nonspectrum and autistic children. In addition to affirming previous findings that parent language features predict child language, they also documented the reverse, that children\u2019s language features predicted parent language: children\u2019s language at one visit predicted parent language at a subsequent visit. This work focused on classic measures of expressive language like MLU and word types/tokens. In a more recent study, Fusaroli et\u00a0 al. (2021) focusing on caregivers\u2019 alignment (i.e., re-use of the child\u2019s language in dyad\nconversations) showed that caregivers of autistic children tended to use less and different kinds of alignment in comparison to caregivers of nonspectrum children. Thus, parents appear to be\u00a0tuned to their child\u2019s expressive language abilities and to tune their own speech accordingly.\nHowever, children\u2019s expressive language is not the only domain to which parents are sensitive. For example, parents use infant-directed speech to infants and not older children, even before the infants use any expressive language at all (e.g., Fernald and Simon, 1984), and recent evidence shows that parents finetune how they label objects depending on their child\u2019s knowledge about the object (Leung et\u00a0al., 2021). Roy et\u00a0al. (2009) found that the parents of one child produced a word in shorter utterances just before the child began to produce that word.\nDespite these intriguing individual findings, what we\u00a0know about how parents tune their speech to their child is limited, because most previous work showing reciprocal parent\u2013child influences in both nonspectrum and autistic groups has focused on expressive language ability rather than language comprehension and processing. Chronological age is unlikely to be\u00a0the sole factor, as is illustrated by evidence from autistic children and intellectual disability who show a gap between chronological age and expected language\u2014these children receive input that is more tuned to their language level but not necessarily their chronological age (e.g., Bang et\u00a0 al., 2019). It is unsurprising that expressive language ability is an important factor that parents are sensitive to, because it is a salient part of how parents experience their child\u2019s developing language ability. In the present study, we\u00a0instead chose to focus on receptive language, aiming to tap into children\u2019s intake of the input by investigating how quickly children comprehend the language produced by their parent. Although receptive and expressive language scores on standard assessments are strongly correlated in autistic children just as in nonspectrum children (Luyster et\u00a0 al., 2008), they are not perfectly correlated, and receptive language is often a domain of relative difficulty (e.g., Luyster et\u00a0al., 2008; Hudry et\u00a0al., 2010). It might be\u00a0that parents are less sensitive to their child\u2019s receptive abilities because they are less easily observed. Certainly, nonverbal communication, too, can provide a signal to parents of the child\u2019s language level (e.g., Yoder and Warren, 1993), and parents respond accordingly, producing slightly more sophisticated language at each stage of the child\u2019s development. However, the current study suggests that at least one aspect of receptive language ability, the speed with which children process language, is not a primary driver of parent tuning. Thus, the current study paves the way for examining which aspects of receptive language, over and above expressive language, parents are sensitive to."

            "heading": "Methodology",
            "text": "In addition to the above implications, the current study also makes important methodological contributions, in two ways. First, in terms of measuring children\u2019s language, our focus on\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nlanguage processing is important because language processing speed is related to children\u2019s abilities to comprehend and learn from language in real time. Here, we\u00a0used eye-tracking to measure processing, which provides an implicit measure of comprehension without requiring that the child execute motor actions or comply with instructions to speak\u2014which may be\u00a0difficult for autistic children (e.g., Kasari et\u00a0al., 2013; Venker and Kover, 2015; Plesa Skwerer et\u00a0 al., 2016; Horvath and Arunachalam, 2019). This method offers strong potential for assessing receptive language in autism (Tager-Flusberg and Kasari, 2013).\nSecond, in terms of assessing parent\u2013child interaction, prior work has mostly used either tightly controlled experimental designs to assess children\u2019s language processing (e.g., Venker et\u00a0al., 2013, 2019; Horvath and Arunachalam, 2019) or naturalistic observation of parent\u2013child interaction to assess spontaneous parental input (see Bottema-Beutel and Kim, 2021). The relation between parents\u2019 unscripted input and children\u2019s intake in the moment had not previously been examined either in typical development or in autism (e.g., Bottema-Beutel and Kim, 2021). This work therefore moves beyond the pre-recorded stimuli used in most language processing experiments; we\u00a0hope that it might generate future hypotheses that are testable within more controlled paradigms.\nCritical to our study is Arunachalam\u2019s (2016) paradigm, in which parents describe objects to children whose eye gaze is tracked, allowing analyses of both parental language and children\u2019s processing in the same setting and in real-time. With respect to parents\u2019 language, the game context offers some useful constraints over open-ended play sessions, because all participants are speaking about the same things and there are limited sources of variance in parents\u2019 speech. This has some advantages for research aiming to look at very specific phenomena, as in the current study, where we\u00a0 looked at the referential expressions parents use to uniquely identify a referent in the context of distractors. With respect to children\u2019s processing, this paradigm offers insight into how children process the language they are likely hearing in real life (i.e., from a familiar parent and in the way that person speaks given this kind of context). A recent word learning study finds that 2-year-olds with a higher likelihood of autism diagnosis process their parent\u2019s voice effectively, allowing them to learn new words (van Rooijen et\u00a0al., 2022). The current study, too, shows similar findings with slightly older children, in the context of unscripted speech."

            "heading": "Limitations and future directions",
            "text": "Despite these advantages of the paradigm, it is also important to recognize several limitations of the current study. First, due to the nature of the methodology, parents\u2019 speech in this study is inevitably less natural than everyday speech. In ongoing work, we\u00a0are examining parents\u2019 speech as they produce an unscripted narrative from a picture book (Shukla et\u00a0al., 2022); we\u00a0aim to be\u00a0able to understand whether and how the patterns observed in\nthe current study differ in more natural contexts. Second, relatedly, because of the unscripted nature of the task and the consequent variability in the language children are hearing, the findings about children\u2019s processing are exploratory, particularly for features that were rarely produced by parents (e.g., postnominal modifiers) and for which our analyses are underpowered. Our sample, though comparable in size to several other experiments involving preschool-aged children on the spectrum (e.g., Naigles et\u00a0al., 2011; Tenenbaum et\u00a0al., 2017; Venker, 2019; Venker et\u00a0al., 2019; Luyster and Arunachalam, 2020), is small, which is a limitation. We\u00a0 intentionally recruited from a relatively wide age range, intending to yield groups that were similar on language while acknowledging that they might differ greatly in chronological age; future studies, however, might benefit from concentrating on a narrower range.\nFurther, our sample does not fully capture the wide heterogeneity of the autism spectrum, and we\u00a0expect that not all autistic children will have slow language processing. Moreover, our sample was limited by the fact that, like many experimental studies, we\u00a0required families to visit the lab in order to participate, which might pose barriers related to family factors such as socioeconomic status and access to transportation as well as child factors such as interest in participating in activities outside the home.\nWe also recognize that parent\u2013child interactions (e.g., Prevoo and Tamis-LeMonda, 2017) are culturally embedded, and that these patterns of dyadic engagement are likely to vary across samples that differ in communication traditions. However, it is also true that cross-cultural research attests to the capacity of adults to strategically modify their behaviors in order to improve communication efficacy (Agredo-Delgado et\u00a0al., 2022).\nFinally, another important limitation\u2014perhaps one that especially highlights avenues for future work\u2014is the fact that none of the participating parents reported having a diagnosis of autism themselves. (Note that although there has been research on parental traits within the broader autism phenotype, recent work has cautioned against treating this as the same as having a formal autism diagnosis; Sasson and Bottema-Beutel, 2021.) A particularly exciting area for future research involves parents with a diagnosis of autism. Many autistic adults report more successful communication and better social rapport with other autistic adults than with nonautistic adults (see, e.g., Bascom, 2012). Research on the double empathy problem (e.g., Milton, 2012) has not thus far focused on parent\u2013child communication specifically. It would be\u00a0particularly instructive to examine whether autistic parents use different communication strategies with their autistic children and whether such differences might sometimes lead to more successful communication and learning; we\u00a0are pursuing these questions in ongoing research."

The current study supports prior work in documenting striking similarities between the input provided by parents of nonspectrum children and parents of autistic children, but we\u00a0extend beyond prior work to show that children\u2019s processing of this very input is slower in the autistic group than the nonspectrum group. Thus, the input is similar in many ways.\nHowever, potential effects on language learning are cascading (e.g., Naigles and Tek, 2017; Arunachalam and Luyster, 2018), so slower processing may mean that autistic children could have less intake even with similar input. Although we\u00a0examined only a brief interaction, in daily life, children who are slow language processors may be\u00a0likely to miss opportunities to learn more language. Suppose that instead of simply naming an object, parents had continued their utterances to introduce something new, e.g., \u201cthere\u2019s an open book\u2026 that\u2019s on a desk.\u201d A child who is slow to identify the open book will be\u00a0less likely to have the opportunity to learn the meaning of \u201cdesk.\u201d Prior work shows that difficulty processing the beginning of a sentence can indeed interfere with children\u2019s abilities to learn new words that occur afterward (Fernald et\u00a0al., 2008a; He et\u00a0al., 2020; He\u00a0et al., in prep). Therefore, less intake due to slower processing may have cascading effects on development of language skills, potentially contributing to explanations for the language difficulties seen in many autistic individuals throughout the lifespan."
