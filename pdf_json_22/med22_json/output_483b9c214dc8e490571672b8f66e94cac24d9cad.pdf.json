            "text": "Type I collagen, the most abundant protein in vertebrates, has been widely used as a biomaterial as it has excellent biological functions and properties.1,2 Extracting type I collagen from mammalian tissues using acetic acid combined with pepsin has been commonly used for decades.3 Schmitt developed methods using the enzyme pepsin and acetic acid for extracting collagen in a high yield from bovine skin4. Pepsin is a single chain enzyme with high specicity that is secreted by inactive pepsinogen and its autocatalytic activation occurs at a pH of <5, where the N-terminal group is removed to leave the enzyme with a molecular weight of around 34 kDa.5,6 The optimum pH of pepsin is between 1.5 and 2.0, and it is inactive above pH 6.5. Residues of Asp 32 and Asp 215 at the active sites are hydrogen-bonded by folding into two independent Asp\u2013 Thr\u2013Gly sequences, which allow pepsin to exhibit optimal biological activity in acidic environments.7 Pepsin is quite rich in Asp and Glu, but it has only one lysine residue. Pepsins play a critical role in the solubilization of extracted collagen. During collagen extraction, pepsin preferentially acts on the Cterminus of aromatic amino acids, such as Phe, Try, Leu and Tyr.8,9\nAlthough the acetic acid\u2013pepsin method is still preferred for obtaining highly puried solubilized collagen from\nEngineering of Ministry of Education,\na.

Moreover, it is difficult to separate pepsin completely from the extracted collagen, where it may remain and serve as a potential allergen.\nTherefore, the solution to these limitations may be solved by using immobilized pepsin in the extraction process. Immobilized enzymes refer to enzymes that play a catalytic role in a certain spatial range and can be used repeatedly and continuously. Immobilized enzymes can solve the problems of the high costs associated with using free enzymes, the timeconsuming separation of enzymolysis products from substrates, restriction of recovery and sample contamination, and are easy to use, separate and reuse.11\nThe immobilization process can prevent molecular interaction and self-digestion,20\u201322 as well as improving enzyme stability, activity, and selectivity.23 Several methods have been used for enzyme immobilization, such as adsorption, trapping and covalent binding.24 The applicability and advantages of enzyme immobilization in practical applications depend on the specic enzyme characteristics, reaction characteristics, substrate and product properties. Furthermore, pepsin has been successfully immobilized on different types of support using various immobilization methods. Santos successfully immobilized pepsin on biochar via adsorption and covalent binding.9 Dascalu reported the immobilization of pepsin on magnetite nanoparticles.7 Moreover, pepsin can also be immobilized on agarose,25 organosilicon,5 mesoporous silica,26 and chitosan.27 Glutaraldehyde is one of the most common tools for enzyme immobilization, as it contains two\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Glutaraldehyde is usually used to enable the rst immobilization on the support to activate the ammoniated support.30\nPorous silica clay (specic surface area 79 m2 g\u22121) has been used as a pepsin support due to its low cost and abundance.28 The inner surface of the porous material can prevent digestion, and the protein can also gain a high internal surface area to realize high load catalyst immobilization. Moreover, enzymes located in pore channels are protected against microbial attack and physical/mechanical damage.29\nHerein, silica clay was modied with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to introduce amino groups on the surface of the support. In addition, glutaraldehyde was used to further react with the amino group on the support surface and pepsin was immobilized by the reaction of glutaraldehyde with the amino group on the side chain of pepsin16. The properties of the immobilized pepsin were investigated. Then, the prepared immobilized pepsin was applied in an acetic acid\u2013pepsin extraction process of collagen from mature bovine hides.\nFig. 1 Scheme of the modification and immobilization process of pepsi\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Moreover, the band at 695 cm\u22121 can be ascribed to an asymmetric O\u2013Si\u2013C stretching mode. For A-SC (Fig. 2b), the two bending vibration peaks of \u2013CH2 and \u2013CH3 could be observed at 2975 cm\u22121, implying that the APTES was successfully coated onto the support.34 Moreover, the peaks at 1727 cm\u22121 and 2851 cm\u22121 correspond to the C]O and C\u2013H stretching vibrations of glutaraldehyde, respectively (Fig. 2c). By comparison with Glu-A-SC, as shown in Fig. 2d (Pep-Glu-A-SC), a new absorption band at 1538 cm\u22121 arises due to the amide II, which is a typical feature of a protein35.

The results thus illustrate that the surface modication process and immobilization might destroy the porous structures. The XRD prole of SC has characteristic peaks within the 2q range of 15\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 (Fig. 4a). The peaks at 2q= 21.64\u00b0 and 2q= 26.60\u00b0 are the diffraction peaks of SiO2, which are consistent with previous reports.31 Aer APTES modication, these typical peaks were maintained (Fig. 4b). As for Glu-A-SC and Pep-Glu-A-SC (Fig. 4c and d), the 2q values corresponding to the two characteristic peaks were slightly reduced, which proved that the intermolecular distance of the silica layer increased.

            "text": "3.2.1. Initial concentration of pepsin. The effect of the initial concentration of pepsin on its binding efficiency was investigated. First, 1.0 g of Glu-A-SC (glutaraldehyde 2%) and 10 mL of pepsin solution (5\u201335 mg mL\u22121 in 0.01 mol per L HCl) were incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 60 min. The binding efficiency and relative activity of the immobilized pepsin are shown in Fig. 5a. It can be observed that the amount of protein binding onto the support increases with an increase in pepsin concentration. In the presence of glutaraldehyde, pepsin is immobilized onto the A-SC support by forming stable cross-links.36 The relative activity reached a maximum when the concentration of pepsin was at 30 mg mL\u22121, while the loaded enzyme amount of the support was at 130 mg g\u22121. When the concentration of pepsin reaches 35 mg mL\u22121, the activity of the immobilized enzyme decreases. This may be due to an excess of pepsin immobilized on the support increasing the steric hindrance, which might reduce the accessibility of the enzyme to the substrate. Wu37 reported that excess pepsin causes most of the binding sites to be hidden or destroyed. These results are consistent with the results of Valentova.38 In addition to covalent cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, a few pepsin molecules may be physically adsorbed in the pores of the support.39,40 Therefore, the initial concentration of pepsin for the immobilization process was set at 35 mg mL\u22121 for further experiments.\n3.2.2. Glutaraldehyde concentration. The effects of the glutaraldehyde concentration on the binding efficiency of pepsin onto Glu-A-SC support were investigated. First, 1.0 g of Glu-A-SC (glutaraldehyde 1\u20137%) and 10 mL of 30 mg mL\u22121 of pepsin solution (in 0.01 mol per L HCl) were incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 60 min. As shown in Fig. 5b, the amount of protein binding onto the support increases with an increase in glutaraldehyde concentration. Maximum binding was reached at 150 mg g\u22121 at a glutaraldehyde concentration of 3%. Aer that, further increasing the glutaraldehyde concentration decreased the binding efficiency. However, the activity of the pepsin reached a maximum when the glutaraldehyde concentration was 5%. The concentration of glutaraldehyde was thus set at 5% for the following experiments.\nA highly activated glutaraldehyde support may have three different interactions with proteins (hydrophobic, ion exchange and covalent interactions). Immobilization of an enzyme via ion exchange has a positive effect on its stability, therefore the twisted deactivation of the enzyme would also be slowed.30 Ferreira41 reported that the use of glutaraldehyde was benecial to the reticulation between pepsin molecules and could improve the overall activity of pepsin. Monsan42 showed that it was possible to modify the main amino group in the support with just one or two glutaraldehyde molecules or by allowing uncontrolled polymerization of glutaraldehyde. The optimal reactivity of the glutaraldehyde preactivated support against the primary amino group was obtained when two glutaraldehyde molecules were introduced into each amino group in the support.\nHowever, the stability of the glutaraldehyde was relatively low.43 Since there were only two major amino residues on\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\npepsin, even if the pepsin on the glutaraldehyde preactivated support was covalently immobilized, it took a long time to obtain maximum multipoint covalently immobilization.44 Furthermore, due to the high loading of pepsin immobilized with modied SC, it could be speculated that the diffusion rate of pepsin was faster than the immobilization rate during the immobilization process, which was similar to the results shown in Fig. 5d. The introduction of glutaraldehyde changed the molecular conformation of the enzyme to a certain extent and reduced the immobilized enzyme activity.27 Moreover, due to the irreversible denaturation of pepsin under neutral and alkaline conditions, the Schiff base generated by the reaction of glutaraldehyde with pepsin may be unstable,44 and pepsin molecules might be absorbed into the porous structure. Under these conditions, the pepsin molecules are very close to each other, and if two reactive groups meet, these molecules are cross-linked, in some cases reinforcing the stabilization effect.\n3.2.3. Temperature. Fig. 5c showed the effect of temperature on pepsin immobilization onto Glu-A-SC. Temperature has little effect on the loading efficiency for the immobilization process. The loading amount of protein onto Glu-A-SC reaches 185 mg g\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C. Therefore, the following immobilization experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C.\n3.2.4. Time. The effect of the incubation time on the immobilization process of pepsin onto Glu-A-SC is shown in Fig. 5d. The loading amount of pepsin reached a maximum aer 60 min and tended towards equilibrium aer that time. The relative activity of pepsin reached a maximum value at 120 min, aer that the relative activity decreased, maybe due to the distortion of the enzyme conformation by the crowded molecules binding on the support. Santos9 suggested that the substrate must be transferred to the catalytic site by surrounding the support surface and diffusing into the pores before reaching the enzyme active site.\nThe results showed the load of pepsin immobilized by the modied SC support was close to 220 mg g\u22121. Since the lack of a primary amino group on pepsin (only one Lys residue), adsorption between the porous SC support and pepsin should occur in addition to a certain extent of covalent cross-linking with glutaraldehyde.45 The NH2 and C]O groups of pepsin interact with the silanol groups on the SC support.26 In summary, the optimal process conditions for the immobilization of pepsin onto modied SC were found to be incubation of an initial pepsin concentration of 35 mg mL\u22121 and a glutaraldehyde concentration of 5% at 25 \u00b0C for 60 min, by which the loading amount of pepsin was 220 mg g\u22121. The activity of the immobilized pepsin was 4.2 U mg\u22121."

Fig. 6b shows the inuence of temperature on the activity of free and immobilized pepsin at pH 2.0. The activity of immobilized pepsin was relatively high in the range of 20\u201340 \u00b0C, and maximum hydrolysis activity was reached at 30 \u00b0C, while free pepsin had high activity in the range of 20\u201350 \u00b0C and reached a maximum at 40 \u00b0C. This is consistent with that reported by David.32 The change in the optimum temperature may be related to the binding of pepsin onto the support surface.27 Compared with the free enzyme, the decrease in the optimal temperature of the immobilized enzyme may be due to the change in the enzyme conformation by the covalent bonds formed by the amino groups, thus affecting the temperature tolerance. Moreover, when the pepsin is crosslinked with glutaraldehyde on the surface of the support, it may adsorb to the silica. Different from immobilized lipase, these conditions will inhibit the activity of pepsin to a certain extent. The results showed that the immobilized pepsin needs to be conducted at a lower temperature to maximize the expansion of the interface of the enzyme to achieve good recognition and binding of substrate molecules. Gamze47 immobilized porcine pepsin on chitosan beads and observed the high stability of the immobilized enzyme at 40\u201350 \u00b0C. Free pepsin showed high stability at 40 \u00b0C. Therefore, the activity of the enzyme will be very different while the enzyme immobilized by different immobilization methods and supports.\nFig. 6c studied the thermal stability activities of the free and immobilized enzymes stored at 50 \u00b0C at pH 2, under acidic conditions for 0\u201312 h. The results showed that both enzymes maintained high activity before the 8 h of incubation. The relative activity of immobilized and free enzymes reached a maximum at around 5 h. The immobilized pepsin was inactivated aer 11 h, while the free enzyme retained about 30% activity at 12 h. The results showed that the free and immobilized pepsin were stable at 50 \u00b0C.\n34554 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 34548\u201334556\nHowever, compared with the characteristics of free enzymes, the activity characteristics of pepsin changed aer immobilization. The correlation between enzyme stability and activity is very complex and inverse. It is not always possible to achieve 100% of recovered activity of the enzyme aer the immobilization process.48 The activity of pepsin was closely related to the orientation of the active center. Glutaraldehyde directly immobilized pepsin on the pre-activated support, with a change in the orientation of the enzyme to some extent.27,39,49 Therefore, the load of immobilization was higher, and the chance for pepsin molecules to react with substrates may be smaller.\nFurthermore, a certain amount of pepsin was adsorbed onto the inner surface of the porous support, and the spatial structure of pepsin may have been distorted.50 Even though the support retained its ability to interact with pepsin44, the molecules gathered together to a certain extent and exhibited no mobility, resulting in additional steric hindrance. Haresh indicated that the low catalytic activity of hemoglobin as a substrate can be attributed to the fact that the hemoglobin macromolecule is a large substrate that cannot reach the inner pores of SC.26 The substrate could only interact with pepsins attached to the surface of the support, which conrmed that pepsin was primarily adsorbed within the pores. Santos9 found that the activity value of free enzymes was higher since they have greater mobility in the solution. The thermal stability of the immobilized pepsin was affected greatly at a higher temparature in compasion to the free enzyme."
