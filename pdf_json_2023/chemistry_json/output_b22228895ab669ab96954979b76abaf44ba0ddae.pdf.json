    "abstractText": "Chemical graph theory significantly predicts multifarious physio-chemical properties of complex and multidimensional compounds when investigated through topological descriptors and QSPR modeling. The targeted compounds are widely studied nanotubes attaining exquisite nanostructures due to their distinguishable properties attaining numeric values. The studied nanotubes are carbon, naphthalene, boron nitride, V-phenylene, and titania nanotubes. In this research work, these nanotubes are characterized through their significance level by implementing highly applicable MCDM techniques. TOPSIS, COPRAS, and VIKOR are used to perform a comparative analysis between them through each optimal ranking. The criteria originated from multiple linear regression modeling established between degree-based topological descriptors and the physio-chemical properties of each nanotube.",

            "text": "Chemical graph theory, a sub-field of mathematical chemistry, employs graph theory to simulate chemical mechanisms mathematically. Theoretically, according to graph theory, a chemical graph features can provide important insights into chemicals. Iv\u00e1n Gutman, Alexandru Balaban, Ante Graovac, Milan Randic\u0301, Haruo Hosoya, and Nenad Trinajstic\u0301 [1] are considered the founders of chemical graph theory. There were allegedly multiple hundred specialists who collaborated in this domain in 1988, and they contributed roughly 500 manuscripts each year. A Chemical diagram shows molecular entities in chemical graph theory. Atoms and bonds are represented by nodes and edges in a chemical network. In cheminformatics, chemical graphs are the primary data types used to depict chemical structures. A key area of cheminformatics is the assessment of (quantitative) structure\u2013activity and structure\u2013property. That can be made possible by the calculable attributes of graphs. The physical characteristics of molecules can then be reflected in these graphs as graph-theoretical descriptors or indices [2, 3].\nA sort of molecular descriptor that is assessed using the molecular graph of a chemical compound is a topological index, sometimes referred to as a connectivity index. Topological indices are numerical variables that describe the topology of a graph and are typically graph invariant. The topological index can be thought of as simple, two-dimensional descriptors that can be determined from molecular networks regardless of how the graph is represented or tagged and without the necessity to minimize the energy of the chemical structure [4].Wiener introduced one of the earliest graph invariants for the linkage between molecular characteristics and topological aspects. The topological index was utilized in his study to estimate the boiling point of paraffin. The Hosoya index, which measures the number of edge fits in a graph, was first proposed by Hosoya in 1971. In 1975, Randic\u0301 topological index was added to this study. Since bond weights formed the foundation of the calculation, it is also known as the connectivity index. After that, in 1998 Bollob\u00e1s and Erdos expanded it as a generalized Randic\u0301 index.\nR\u03b1 \u2211\nuv\u2208E (dudv)\n\u03b1\nTo study about the topological indices, their mathematical aspects and applications see [5\u201314]\na e-mail: hzh@pdsu.edu.cn b e-mail: adnanaslam15@yahoo.com c e-mail: salma.kanwal055@gmail.com (corresponding author) d e-mail: syyeda221@gmail.com e e-mail: khadijasarwar055@gmail.com\n0123456789().: V,-vol 123"

            "text": "QSAR/QSPR analysis is a prediction model generated from statistical methods that correlate chemical compounds\u2019 biological activity and property with descriptors indicative of their molecular structure or characteristics. In the chemical and biological sciences as well as engineering, regression models are used. While classification of QSAR/QSPR models ties the predictor variables to a categorical value of the response variable, QSAR/QSPR regression methods relate a collection of\u201d predictor\u201d variables (X) to the potency of the response variable (Y), like other regression models.\nIn [15], Topological descriptors are substantially linked with the physical characteristics of antituberculosis medications. It may be possible for chemists and others in the pharmaceutical business to forecast the qualities of antituberculosis medications without having to do experiments, thanks to theoretical analysis. Based on neighborhood degree sums of nodes, various new topological descriptors were suggested by Mondal et al. [16]. An algorithm was developed to facilitate the computation of the novel indices. An excellent statistical tool for examining pharmacological activity or binding mode for various receptors is the quantitative structure\u2013property relationship (QSPR) study. Hayat et al.[17, 18] assessed the efficacy of spectrum-based distance descriptors for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and tested the applicability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\u2019 spectrum-based valency descriptors. Edge and Vertex degree-based topological descriptors were used in [19] to build a quantitative structure\u2013property relationship (QSPR), and physio-chemical properties of phytochemicals tested against SARS \u2212 CoV \u2212 23CLpro were assessed. 2.1 Multi-criteria decision making\nSince its inception in the 1970s, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) has drawn the interest of numerous scholars. MCDM can be classified into two main categories: multi-objective decision-making (MODM) and multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). Since its inception, more than 70 multi-criteria decision-making strategies have been identified [20]. With so many very similar possibilities, it is necessary to adopt a strategic move to find the best solution. The alternatives differ, but because they are all part of the same group of real-world entities, it can be difficult to decide which is best among the better alternatives. This kind of decision-making calls for some level of insight. It is necessary to have a basis for ranking the options and differentiating them to improve the decision-making process. A few qualitative and quantitative variables that could aid in differentiating the options must be chosen to do this. These variables are referred to as criteria. The choices are contrasted with the chosen criteria to make the best choice. These variables are referred to as criteria. The alternatives are assessed against the chosen criteria to make the best choice. As a result, MCDM is made up of a set of numerous criteria, a set of alternatives, and some sort of comparison between them.\nAccording to Hwang and Yoon\u2019s review of the available solutions to MCDM problems, there are numerous approaches. Three highly applicable MCDM approaches, TOPSIS, COPRAS, and VIKOR, are being used in the current investigation. Among MCDM techniques, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is the second most prevalent. Numerous academics have modified or expanded the TOPSIS method to address unique challenges, as well as adapted TOPSIS to tackle basic or complex problems in various fields.\nA total of 105 peer-reviewed works developed, extended, proposed, and presented the TOPSIS technique for tackling DM problems. According to the study\u2019s findings, from 2000 to 2015, 49 academics extended or developed the TOPSIS technique, and 56 scholars proposed or presented new modifications for the technique\u2019s use in solving problems. The study\u2019s findings also showed that 2011 saw more modifications to this technique than any other year [21]. The AHP, ELECTRE, PROMETHEE, VIKOR, or TOPSIS procedures were modified [22]. The level of the information society (IS) development in the member states of the European Union from 2005 to 2010 is analyzed using the TOPSIS approach with interval arithmetic, and the findings are reported. Due to the shortcomings of conventional TOPSIS, it has undergone two significant changes because of this paper. The ranking of the weapon selection problem is next analyzed using the thorough grey TOPSIS by Yunjie Wu and Wenguang Yang [23]. The numerical findings demonstrate the viability of the enhanced grey relational analysis as well as the grey comprehensive TOPSIS. L. Ocampo et.al [24]. utilized the technique of TOPSIS to resolve a warehouse site selection problem under a substantial number of decision criteria in a group decision-making setting. A case study at a company that distributes products was done to clarify the suggested approach.\nWhen evaluating and comparing the viability of alternative energy strategies or renewable energy technologies, VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) is frequently used to provide decision support for choosing the most viable and sensible options. In the realms of sustainability and renewable energy, the VIKOR approach has been employed in several earlier pieces of research. Environmental management, life cycle sustainability assessment, energy resources, and environmental evaluation are only a few of the various sub-areas that fall under the umbrella of sustainability and renewable energy. The majority of which were extracted from the \u201cWeb of Science and Scopus\u201d databases dealt with operational research, management sciences, decisionmaking, sustainability, and renewable energy. These papers were published from 2004 to 2015 in 83 prestigious journals. Because the VIKOR method\u2019s premise is simple and easy to understand, as well as its computing procedure, which is effective and can gauge how well different decision alternatives perform relative to one another, the experiment can assist in making effective decisions [25]. Wei et al. [26] suggested using 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers to solve the multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problem (2TLNNs).\nIn [27], Jong and Byeong extended prior works that primarily take intervals or fuzzy under a flat structure of criteria and introduced the hierarchical VIKOR approach that incorporates incomplete alternatives\u2019 values as well as incomplete criteria weights. It used\nthe aggregated group utility and individual regret scores obtained from the linear programs to rank the alternatives. They used a global supplier selection issue that has an impact on the organization\u2019s sustainable growth as an example to demonstrate how to apply our suggested methodology. In 1994, Zavadskas, Kaklauskas, and Sarka presented the COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) approach. Using this method, the maximizing and minimizing index values are evaluated, and the impact of the indices on the evaluation of the outcomes is considered independently. The COPRAS approach is used in various contexts, including risk assessment, investment project selection, and material selection [28]. A case study carried out at a public transportation corporation in the southern region of India provides evidence of the established model\u2019s efficacy. AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process), FARE (Factor Relationship) method, and entropy measurement are three alternative approaches used to calculate the weights of the design parameters [29]. How to choose wisely while buying CFLs was addressed by the authors in [30]. This was addressed using the COPRAS multi-criteria decision-making approach. Applying FANMA and SDV decision-making models, objective methodologies were utilized to assess the relative importance of various factors. Krishnakumar etal [31]. proposed a comprehensive method for resolving the decision-making issue with probabilistic-hesitant fuzzy information (PHFI), which is an expansion of the hesitant fuzzy set and provided the PHFI with a COPRAS mechanism for ranking the alternatives. A case study of choosing a cloud vendor was used to illustrate the provided method, and its viability was determined by contrasting the outcomes of the technique with those of many other existing algorithms.\nTo choose the finest electric motorcycles, Patel et al. [32] introduced CRITIC-COPRAS and CRITICTOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making procedures. To help decision-makers choose the best option from among a variety of accessible electric motorcycle possibilities on the market, this approach\u2019s noteworthy notion compares the two methodologies to discover the one that is most applicable to the motorbike-choosing scenario. For the objective of evaluating the affordability of sustainable housing, a practical application and assessment of six distinct multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies were given in [33]. The comparison analysis goal is to evaluate how various MCDM techniques stack up when applied to a sustainable housing affordability assessment model. This research compares the ranks, explores the commonalities among MCDM approaches, and assesses their robustness. The TOPSIS and COPRAS algorithms were used in [34] for multi-objective enhancement to find the best combination of performance characteristics, such as spindle speed and feed rate, for simultaneous minimization of all responses when drilling Mg AZ91 with carbide tools. A comparative comparison of the TOPSIS, VIKOR, and COPRAS techniques was carried out by Hezer etal. [35] for the COVID-19 Regional Safety Assessment, and it is been noted that the COPRAS approach yields results that are the most in line with those of the report, while the VIKOR method yields results that are the furthest from them. To choose the best flow release scenario, seven alternative MCDM approaches are used in [36] to analyze an existing small run-of-the-river HP plant. Investigated and statistically contrasted are the outcomes of applying various MCDM techniques. Also highlighted are the advantages and disadvantages of the various methodological approaches. According to the comparison findings and the ensuing analyses, SHARE MCA, WPM, and VIKOR seem to possess the most intriguing traits in terms of general viability. Three significant and practical MCDM techniques WSM, AHP, and TOPSIS have been succinctly discussed [37]. To choose the best option among the many options under discussion, the article outlines the fundamental phases of each technique.\nAccording to the weights assigned to each manufacturing technique for AHP, TOPSIS, and VIKOR, sand casting came out on top. Compared to TOPSIS and AHP, the VIKOR technique outperformed both in terms of computing complexity. Additionally, the VIKOR and TOPSIS methods were more useful for choosing manufacturing processes for their flexibility during the decisionmaking process, the number of alternative processes and criteria, their suitability for supporting a group decision, and their ability to add or remove a criterion [38]. The significant applications in chemical graph theory are a major driving force behind this study. To implement the MCDM (TOPSIS, VIKOR, and COPRAS) approaches and get the most benefit out of them, QSPR analysis is done using correlation and multiple linear regression. Some recent researched works draw attention toward studied mathematical models, and targeted structures are mentioned."

Each of these has been used for contemporary technologies.\nA type of nanostructure with a cylindrical shape is a carbon nanotube (CNT). Due to the broad use of titanium in the creation of catalytic, gas-sensing, and corrosion-resistant materials, it is one of the nanostructures that have been most thoroughly explored.

In the first place, QSPR models summarize an alleged correlation between chemical structures and biological activity in a chemical data set. Additionally, QSPR models forecast the behaviors of novel compounds. This part covers multiple linear regression analysis, the perspective of selecting a specific order, and the association between physio-chemical parameters and chemical invariants. The concept we developed in this study is heavily reliant on QSPR analysis to match the physical and chemical characteristics of nanotube components to a particular topological descriptor. To get the best results, we have examined the nanostructure using the designated topological descriptor values. Table 7 displays the adjustments we made to [m, n] to determine the proximity and relationships of the vertex sets of the nanostructures. Ultimately, it is difficult to determine which mathematical value is dominant at a given structure by comparing its values to others. It is very important to view numerical data directly and arrive at a single structure when they are changing or reaching certain fluctuations. We must examine the component of nanostructures by their physical characteristics, which are their molar mass, density, and melting point, as shown in Table 8, to associate the topological descriptor with the nanostructure. The goal is to determine the best-ranging numerical values that have strong correlation and regression, matching certain values of the topological descriptor. As a result of these analyses, we now know which criteria are useful and which are not. The current study\u2019s analysis demonstrates that all the criteria, as indicated in Table 9 as topological indices, are beneficial and advantageous.

It can be used to model how strongly the link between variables will develop in the future and to gauge the strength of the relationship between variables. Multiple linear regressions are the name of a statistical method for predicting the outcome of a variable based on the values of two or more other variables. The factors we use to predict the value of the dependent variable are known as independent or explanatory variables, while the variable we seek to forecast is known as the dependent variable. To predict the result of a dependent variable, a statistical method known as multiple linear regression employs two or more independent variables. Analysts can use the technique to calculate the model\u2019s variation as well as the relative contributions of each independent variable to the overall variance. For the nanostructures under consideration, we aim to forecast their physio-chemical properties. Here, we have dependent variables named molar mass, density, and melting point and generalized Randic\u0301 index for \u03b1 \u00b11,\u00b1 12 independent variable.

At this point of discussion, we have observed that we cannot reach exactly how and at what measure each index is contributing under multiple linear regression for each property, but it produced the error zero and the value of adjusted R2 is one in each case.

We have chosen and observed values of R2 from the best line fit plotting, developed under each multiple linear regression analysis for QSPR model as shown in Tables 15, 16 and 17. We can conclude that only R 1\n2 performed outclass by achieving R2 value 0.872 generated under multiple linear\nregression modeling for model 2 which we considered as density. This allowed us to conclude and observe the combine effect and individual effect of each topological index for a specified nano-bodies. After reaching toward the prediction ability of each index to predict any property, the question arise here is to overcome the solution by ranking them best under the considered study and how QSPR effects the rankings been investigated in this research paper. We cannot consider any value to discriminate or allocate weightage as we have obtained the standard error zero and the value of effectiveness of the model run is one in each modeling. This allows us to allocate equal weightage 0.25 for each topological index. To rank these nanostructures, we have implemented three highly effective MCDM techniques named as TOPSIS, COPRAS and VIKOR. The ranking obtained by implementing the outputs based on QSPR modeling under multiple linear regression analysis justifies the weight allocation which we have chosen equally. The rankings we obtained through this whole ideology are shown in Fig. 7. We have direct visualizations that VPHX [m, n], NPHX\n[m, n] and C[m, n] are ranked equally when they ordered by considering m n and VPHX [m, n] ranked high. These are not just rankings, but this opens a new era to implement and link two highly distinguish and applicable branches of mathematics to visualize, read and measure the effects of QSPR when it comes to choose or rank structures under QSPR .\nAuthors\u2019 contribution All the authors equally contributed to the writing and proof reading of the paper.
