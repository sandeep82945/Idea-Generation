1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship of DBNs and BNs against T. cruzi.** This could be done by synthesizing and testing a series of DBNs and BNs with different structural features, such as different substituents on the phenyl rings or different lengths of the alkyl chains. This information could be used to design more potent and selective antitrypanosomal agents.
2. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of DBNs and BNs against T. cruzi.** This could be done by testing the compounds in animal models of Chagas disease. This information would be important for determining the potential of these compounds for clinical development.
3. **Investigate the mechanism of action of DBNs and BNs against T. cruzi.** This could be done by using a variety of biochemical and cell biological techniques. This information could be used to develop strategies to improve the efficacy and selectivity of these compounds.
4. **Develop drug delivery systems for DBNs and BNs.** This could be done by using a variety of approaches, such as encapsulation in nanoparticles or conjugation to antibodies. This information could be used to improve the bioavailability and targeting of these compounds.
5. **Conduct clinical trials of DBNs and BNs for the treatment of Chagas disease.** This would be the ultimate goal of this research, as it would provide definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of these compounds in humans.
