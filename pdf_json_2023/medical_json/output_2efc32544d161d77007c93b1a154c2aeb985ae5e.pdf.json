    "abstractText": "A cancer-specific anti-PDPN mAb, LpMab-23 (mouse IgG1, kappa), was established in our previous study. We herein produced a humanized IgG1 version (humLpMab-23) and defucosylated form (humLpMab-23-f) of an anti-PDPN mAb to increase ADCC activity. humLpMab-23 recognized PDPN-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 (CHO/PDPN), PDPN-positive PC-10 (human lung squamous cell carcinoma), and LN319 (human glioblastoma) cells via flow cytometry. We then demonstrated that humLpMab-23-f induced ADCC and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against CHO/PDPN, PC-10, and LN319 cells in vitro and exerted high antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models, indicating that humLpMab-23-f could be useful as an antibody therapy against PDPN-positive lung squamous cell carcinomas and glioblastomas.",

            "text": "Podoplanin (PDPN), also known as T1\u03b1/gp36/Aggrus, is a type I transmembrane sialo-glycoprotein that possesses an extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and short cytoplasmic tail [1]. The PDPN extracellular domain has tandem platelet aggregationstimulating domains, such as PLAG1, PLAG2, and PLAG3, which are associated with\nCancers 2023, 15, 5080. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15205080 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers\nCancers 2023, 15, 5080 2 of 13\ntumor-induced platelet aggregation [1]. A few PLAG-like domains (PLDs) have also been identified, one of which is called the PLAG4 domain [1]. In the extracellular domains of PDPN, serine or threonine residues are modified with mucin O-glycans with galactose \u03b21,3 -linked to N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc) [1]. O-glycosylated PLAG3 and PLAG4 have been reported to interact with C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), which is important for PDPN-induced platelet aggregation [2,3]. The PDPN intracellular domain can recruit the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) complex, which regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [4]. Furthermore, PDPN interacts with matrix metalloproteinases [5] and hyaluronan receptor CD44 [6]. The complex is formed in tumor invadopodia, which promotes hyaluronan binding and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation [7]. Furthermore, PDPN mediates the diverse pattern of tumor invasion, including collective invasion in squamous cell carcinomas [8] and ameboid invasion in melanoma [9]. Overexpression of PDPN has been reported in many tumors, including squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck, esophagus, malignant gliomas, and mesotheliomas, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes [1]. Furthermore, PDPN is also expressed in cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME). CAFs are reported to enhance cancer cell survival and affect therapeutic outcomes. CAFs are also involved in the formation of an immunosuppressive TME, which can reduce antitumor immunity [10]. Elevated PDPN staining in CAFs is correlated with poor prognosis in lung [11\u201313], breast [14], and pancreatic [15] cancer patients. Therefore, PDPN has been considered as a useful marker for diagnosis and an attractive therapeutic target for tumors. Our group previously established several mAbs against human PDPN. Clone NZ-1 exhibits neutralizing activity for CLEC-2 binding and prevents platelet aggregation and hematogenous metastasis to the lung [1]. An NZ-1-derived rat-human chimeric antibody, named NZ-8 (human IgG1, kappa), possesses antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC) activities and exerts antitumor effects against malignant mesotheliomas [16]. A mouse-human chimeric anti-PDPN mAb, named chLpMab-7 (human IgG1, kappa), which recognizes the PLD domain, did not show neutralization activity for CLEC-2 binding but suppressed tumor growth and hematogenous metastasis to the lung, indicating that ADCC/CDC activities are essential for targeting PDPN-positive tumors [17]. To select mAbs that exhibit cancer specificity, we have established a cancer-specific monoclonal antibody (CasMab) method [18]. One CasMab, clone LpMab-2, recognizes the glycopeptide structure of PDPN from Thr55 to Leu64 [18]. In contrast, another CasMab against PDPN, clone LpMab-23, recognizes a peptide structure of PDPN from Gly54 to Leu64 [19]. We successfully applied a PDPN-targeting CasMab to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy in mice preclinical studies of human glioblastoma [20]. Recently, we further developed anti-HER2 CasMabs [21]. ADCC activity is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells through the interaction of Fc\u03b3RIIIa with the Fc region of mAbs. The interaction between Fc and Fc\u03b3RIIIa on effector cells is facilitated by a core fucose deficiency in the N-glycan in the Fc region [22]. Therefore, fucosyltransferase 8 (Fut8)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the ideal hosts to produce completely defucosylated recombinant mAbs [23]. This technique was applied to the development of mogamulizumab (Poteligeo\u00ae), a defucosylated humanized mAb targeting CCR4 [24]. We previously produced mouse-human chimeric and defucosylated forms of anti-PDPN mAbs from LpMab-23 [19], which showed an antitumor effect in a mouse xenograft model. In this study, we produced a humanized and defucosylated anti-PDPN mAb (humLpMab23-f) and evaluated its ability to induce ADCC and CDC or antitumor efficacy against PDPN-positive tumor cells.\nCancers 2023, 15, 5080 3 of 13"

            "text": "In this study, we showed that humLpMab-23-f exhibited potent ADCC and CDC activities against CHO/PDPN, PC-10, and LN319 cells (Figures 2 and 4). Furthermore, administration of humLpMab-23-f in tumor-bearing mice completely suppressed the growth of CHO/PDPN xenografts (Figure 3A,C,E) and exerted potent antitumor effects in PC-10 and LN319 xenografts (Figure 5). These results indicated that humLpMab-23-f could be useful as an antibody therapy for PDPN-positive human tumors. We previously evaluated defucosylated mouse-human chimeric LpMab-23 (chLpMab23-f) [19]. Although chLpMab-23-f exhibited ADCC activity and exerted a moderate antitumor effect against CHO/PDPN cells, chLpMab-23-f neither exhibited ADCC activity against PC-10 cells nor CDC activity against PDPN-expressing tumor cells [19]. The results of the binding affinity experiments revealed that the KD of humLpMab-23 with PC-10 cells was 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 M (Figure 1D). In contrast, the KD of chLpMab-23 with PC-10 cells was 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 M (Supplementary Figure S3). These results indicated that humLpMab-23 shows a superior binding affinity compared to chLpMab-23. The increased binding affinity is thought to be a reason why humLpMab-23-f exerted more potent antitumor effects than chLpMab-23. PDPN is involved in tumor malignant progression through activation of tumor invasiveness, EMT, and stemness. Furthermore, PDPN induces platelet aggregation through interaction with CLEC-2 on platelets, which is associated with venous thromboembolism and evasion of immune cells [25,26]. Therefore, several anti-PDPN mAbs have been evaluated in preclinical studies. Our group demonstrated that chLpMab-7 (a mouse-human chimeric anti-PDPN mAb) and NZ-8 (a rat-human chimeric antibody derived from NZ-1) exerted antitumor effects through their ADCC and CDC activities. Furthermore, NZ-1R700 conjugate [27] and NZ-16 labeled with actinium-225 (225Ac) [28] have been developed as near-infrared photoimmunotherapy and radioimmunotherapy agents against PDPN, respectively. Both mAbs also exhibited antitumor effects against the malignant pleural mesothelioma xenograft model. In addition, neutralizing mAbs for PDPN-CLEC-2 interaction suppressed hematogenous pulmonary metastasis by inhibiting platelet aggregation [29]. LpMab-23 has a different epitope from the abovementioned anti-PDPN mAbs [19] and showed comparable ADCC/CDC activities and antitumor effects in vivo (Figures 2\u20135). In contrast, the reactivity of LpMab-23 to normal cells such as lymphatic endothelial cells was low in immunohistochemical analysis [30]. It should be determined whether humLpMab-23-f induces reduced cytotoxicity against normal PDPN-expressing cells. We already confirmed that mouse-human chimeric LpMab-23 (20 mg/kg) [19] did not show any toxicity against cynomolgus monkeys. CAFs are important players in the TME. CAFs are involved in tumor progression through the promotion of tumor proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance, as well as ECM remodeling and immunosuppression [31]. PDPN expression is also observed in CAFs. Increased expression of PDPN in CAFs from lung [11\u201313], pancreas [15], and breast [14] tumors is associated with poor prognosis of patients. In PDPN-positive CAFs from lung tumors, the CAFs promote lung cancer cell resistance to inhibitors of EGFR [32]. Furthermore, increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 was observed in PDPN-positive CAFs [13], which are associated with an immunosuppressive TME [10]. In breast cancer, the S100A4/PDPN expression ratio in CAFs is associated with disease outcomes across subtypes. High PDPN levels in CAFs were significantly correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival and overall survival [33]. Moreover, PDPN-positive CAFs were associated with low IL-2 activity and resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients [34]. These findings indicate that the character of CAFs is an important predictive marker of breast cancer\nCancers 2023, 15, 5080 11 of 13\nprogression and resistance to treatment. Therefore, targeting PDPN-positive CAFs using anti-PDPN mAbs could be a strategy for tumor therapy. Since we have not examined the reactivity of humLpMab-23 to CAFs, further studies to characterize humLpMab-23-reactive CAFs are needed. PD-1 and CTLA-4 on effector T lymphocytes play essential functions in tumor immune response. PDPN was reported as a co-inhibitory receptor on both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. In T lymphocyte-specific Pdpn-deleted mice, the growth of inoculated B16F10 tumors was significantly delayed. The PDPN-deficient CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes exhibited increased tumor necrosis factor production, while the abundance of exhausted T lymphocytes was decreased [35]. Moreover, deletion of Pdpn in T cells resulted in the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis with increased accumulation of effector CD4+ T lymphocytes [36]. These results suggest the involvement of PDPN in tumor immune suppression. Although the ligand of PDPN involved in suppressing T lymphocytes has not been identified, a PDPN-targeting mAb has potential as a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor. Therefore, the combinatorial effects of anti-PDPN mAbs with immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered in preclinical studies. We have established anti-PDPN mAbs against various species, including mice [1]. The anti-mouse PDPN mAbs could be useful in revealing the importance of PDPN-positive lymphocytes in cancer immunity and obtaining proof-of-concept for tumor therapy.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cancers15205080/s1, Figure S1.
