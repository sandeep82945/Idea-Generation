"Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness and generalization of the CAT-Seg framework to handle a wider variety of cardiac conditions and anatomical variations. Additionally, exploring the integration of CAT-Seg with other diagnostic tools and clinical workflows could further validate its utility in real-world settings. Investigating the application of CAT-Seg to other imaging modalities beyond CMRI could also broaden its applicability in cardiovascular diagnostics."
