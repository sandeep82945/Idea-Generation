    "abstractText": "Alcohol use, abuse, and addiction, and resulting health hazards are highly sex-dependent with unknown mechanisms. Previously, strong links between the SMPD3 gene and its coded protein neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSM) and alcohol abuse, emotional behavior, and bone defects were discovered and multiple mechanisms were identified for females. Here we report strong sex-dimorphisms for central, but not for peripheral mechanisms of NSM action in mouse models. Reduced NSM activity resulted in enhanced alcohol consumption in males, but delayed conditioned rewarding effects. It enhanced the acute dopamine response to alcohol, but decreased monoaminergic systems adaptations to chronic alcohol. Reduced NSM activity increased depressionand anxiety-like behavior, but was not involved in alcohol use for the self-management of the emotional state. Constitutively reduced NSM activity impaired structural development in the brain and enhanced lipidomic sensitivity to chronic alcohol. While the central effects were mostly",

            "text": "Alcohol use, abuse, and addiction, and resulting health hazards are highly sex-dependent with unknown mechanisms. Previously, strong links between the SMPD3 gene and its coded protein neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSM) and alcohol abuse, emotional behavior, and bone defects were discovered and multiple mechanisms were identified for females. Here we report strong sex-dimorphisms for central, but not for peripheral mechanisms of NSM action in mouse models. Reduced NSM activity resulted in enhanced alcohol consumption in males, but delayed conditioned rewarding effects. It enhanced the acute dopamine response to alcohol, but decreased monoaminergic systems adaptations to chronic alcohol. Reduced NSM activity increased depression- and anxiety-like behavior, but was not involved in alcohol use for the self-management of the emotional state. Constitutively reduced NSM activity impaired structural development in the brain and enhanced lipidomic sensitivity to chronic alcohol. While the central effects were mostly\nopposite to NSM function in females, similar roles in bone-mediated osteocalcin release and its effects on alcohol drinking and emotional behavior were observed. These findings support the view that the NSM and multiple downstream mechanism may be a source of the sex-differences in alcohol use and emotional behavior.\nKey words: neutral sphingomyelinase; osteocalcin; depression; alcohol; anxiety."

            "text": "Alcohol abuse is a wide spread phenomenon that may result in addiction, a psychiatric disorder with still poor pharmacotreatment options (GBD 2018). In regular nonaddicted consumers, alcohol is not predominantly used for its euphoric effects, but rather instrumentalized to achieve behavioral goals that would not be achievable or require a higher work load without the drug (M\u00fcller and Schumann 2011a, 2011b; M\u00fcller 2020). However, these goals significantly change in addicts (M\u00fcller et al. 2021). One of the most frequently reported instrumentalization goals is the management of an aversive affective state, which includes spontaneous or induced depression and anxiety (M\u00fcller et al. 2021). A mechanistic base for alcohol consumption to self-manage a genetically induced depression is the re-establishment of sphingolipid and monoamine homeostasis in the brain (M\u00fcller et al. 2017; M\u00fcller and Kornhuber 2017).\nAlcohol use, abuse, addiction, and resulting health hazards are highly sex-dependent (GBD 2018). Males use and abuse alcohol for other reasons and subserved by distinct neurobiological mechanisms than females (Carroll and Lynch 2016; Sanchis-Segura and Becker 2016). Also instrumentalization goals appear to be sex-dependent (Hilderbrand and Lasek 2018; Turner et al. 2018; M\u00fcller et al. 2021). A lack of sex-specific understanding of alcohol neuropsychopharmacology may be one reason that has hampered the development of a personalized treatment of alcohol addiction.\nSphingolipids are among the most abundant lipids of the brain (Holthuis et al. 2001), where they critically shape appearance and dynamics of neuronal membranes. They form highly dynamic ceramideenriched lipid platforms, which accommodate functional neurotransmitter receptors at the neuronal synapse and determine their function (Kornhuber et al. 2014; Schneider et al. 2017). Brain ceramides exert a crucial role on emotional behavior (Gulbins et al. 2013, 2018; Zoicas, Huber, et al. 2020) and learning and memory (Huston et al. 2016; Kalinichenko et al. 2021). A disruption of the brain sphingolipid rheostat may also give rise to psychiatric disorders such as depression (Gulbins et al. 2013, 2018) or alcohol addiction (M\u00fcller et al. 2017). Sphingomyelinases catalyze the turnover of highly abundant sphingomyelins to ceramides. Acid(ASM), basic-, and neutral sphingomyelinase (NSM) have been distinguished, related to their optimal pH-value (Hannun and Obeid 2008). We have previously reported an association of NSM-2 coding gene SMPD3 haplotypes with alcohol use, depression and bone defects in a cohort of 456,693 male and female human individuals. A functional analysis showed multiple syndrome interactions\nin females. However, sphingolipid systems in the brain show a strong sex-dimorphism (Gulbins et al. 2013; Zoicas, Schumacher, et al. 2020), which may be also responsible for the gender bias in alcohol addiction and depression. Here we describe a distinct role of NSM-2 in male alcohol use and in emotional behavior, which is together with its downstream neurochemical, lipidomic, and anatomical mechanisms largely different from females."

The 2 TSE Place Preference test boxes (TSE Systems) with 3 compartments were composed of nontransparent polyvinyl chloride with standard inside dimensions (40 \u00d7 15 cm). The floor of the left chamber was covered with a smooth black rubber mat and the floor of the right chamber was covered with a patterned black rubber mat, whereas the center chamber was not covered and colored white. The system automatically recorded the number of entries, the time spent in the compartment and the distance moved in each compartment for each trial using high-resolution infrared sensors. An unbiased design was used in which half of the mice were conditioned to their preferred compartment, and half to their nonpreferred compartment. Animals were injected with either saline or alcohol (2 g/kg, 10 mL/kg, i.p.) immediately before each trial, and placed into the CPP boxes for conditioning/pseudoconditioning trials (Easton, Lucchesi, Mizuno, et al. 2013; Kalinichenko et al. 2021).\nThe CPP experiment involved 4 phases: a habituation trial (1 session), a preconditioning testing (baseline, Bl), conditioning trials (14 sessions), and preference tests (3 sessions, T1\u2013T3). Habituation: The habituation session was intended to acclimatize the mice to the test procedure and apparatus prior to commencing the experiment. Mice were injected with saline and placed in the center compartment with free access to all three compartments for 20 min. Baseline test: The pretest was designed to establish a baseline level of preference for each individual. Mice were conditioned to either their preferred or nonpreferred compartment using a counterbalanced experimental design. Mice were injected with saline and placed in the center compartment with free\naccess to all three compartments for 20 min. Conditioning trials: Conditioning trials were performed in pairs; odd numbered pairings were conditioned with alcohol (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and even numbered pairings were conditioned with saline, balanced across groups. All animals received seven pairings with saline and 7 pairings with alcohol. Mice were injected with either saline or alcohol and introduced into 1 of the 2 conditioning compartments, with restricted access, for 5 min. Preference tests: Preference tests were systematically performed after 1 (T1), 3 (T2), and 7 (T3) conditioning/pseudoconditioning trials to monitor the time course of CPP establishment. Before each test, mice were injected with saline and placed in the center compartment with free access to all three compartments for 20 min. The time spent in the conditioning/pseudoconditioning compartment, the entries into these compartments, and conditioned locomotor activity were measured to estimate mechanisms driving a potential CPP (Easton, Lucchesi, Lourdusamy, et al. 2013; Kalinichenko et al. 2021).\nIn order to test the NSM effect on the expression of an alcohol-CPP, we measured the effects of an acute pharmacological inhibition of NSM activity on this parameter. For this purpose, na\u00efve male C57Bl6 mice (n = 9\u201310/group) were conditioned for an alcohol CPP as described above, but with only 4 conditioning and four pseudoconditioning trials. Before the single test trial, they were treated with 2 selective NSM inhibitors, ES048 (400 ng/kg) and GW4869 (2 mg/kg, Sigma) (Kalinichenko et al. 2021), or vehicle and CPP was measured as described above."

Two guide cannulas (Microbiotech/se AB) were aimed at the dorsal hippocampus (DH; A: \u22122.1; L: \u00b11.2; V: \u22121.1) and the nucleus accumbens (Nac; A: +1.2; L: \u00b11.6; V: \u22124.3; angle \u00b110\u25e6 from midline) using coordinates relative to bregma (Franklin and Paxionos 1997). The cannulas were fixed using two anchor screws (stainless steel, d = 1.4 mm) and dental cement. After the surgery 0.01 mL Rimadyl (5 mg/kg Carprofen) per 10 g body weight was given s.c. for analgesia; and 0.1 mL physiological saline was injected to restore fluid balance. Animals were kept warm during and after the surgery, afterwards returned to their home cages and monitored daily. The animals were given at least 5 days between the surgery and dialysis and were handled daily for 5 min/animal (Mielenz et al. 2018; Kalinichenko et al. 2019).\nOn the day of the experiment, microdialysis probes with membrane length of 1 mm were inserted into the guide cannula under a short (1\u20132 min) isoflurane narcosis (O2 at 2 l/min, Isoflurane at 3\u20135%). After probe insertion, each animal was placed into a Plexiglas chamber (21 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 30 cm) with water ad libitum and room temperature 19\u201322 \u25e6C. The probes were connected to a microinfusion pump (CMA 400, Carnegie) and were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (Carl Roth GmbH) at room temperature and the flow rate of 1.5 \u03bcL/min. The perfusion was allowed to stabilize for 2 h until a stable baseline was achieved. Then, samples were collected every 20 min into vials with 2.73 \u03bcL of antioxidant (0.1 M perchloric acid) and 500 pg dihydroxybenzylamine as internal standard (Sigma/Carl Roth GmbH). First three samples were used to measure baseline quantities of the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) (Amato et al. 2020). After 1 h, an alcohol stimulus was applied (2 g/kg, i.p., vinj = 10 mL/kg) and further six samples were collected. Once the microdialysis experiment was completed, the animal was sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The brain was isolated, and the localization of the probes was verified. Only samples from the animals with probes placed within the DH and Nac were considered for further analysis.\nAll samples were analyzed using HPLC with electrochemical detection to measure DA, 5-HT and NE levels. The column was an ET 125/2, Nucleosil 120-5, C-18 reversed phase column (Macherey & Nagel). The mobile phase consisted of 75 mM NaH2PO4, 4 mM KCl, 20 \u03bcM EDTA, 1.5 mM sodium dodecylsulfate, 100 \u03bcL/l diethylamine, 12% alcohol, and 12% acetonitrile adjusted to pH 6.0 using phosphoric acid (Carl Roth GmbH).

In order to test NSM effects in stressed animals, part of the animals were treated with corticosterone (0.25 mg/mL) in drinking water 7 days before and during testing (control: only drinking water; Gulbins et al. 2013). All tests were performed on separate days between 09:00 and 16:00 h. Mice were tested in a pseudorandom order and were moved to the behavioral suite adjacent to the housing room at least 1 h before testing. Each test apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between subjects to avoid any olfactory cues influencing behaviors. Mice were returned to their home cages at the end of each test and allowed to recover for at least 2 days before further testing. Behaviors for all tests were recorded for subsequent scoring (M\u00fcller et al. 2017; Kalinichenko et al. 2021).\nOpen Field: Each mouse was placed in a square white acrylic arena (50 \u00d7 50 cm), facing an outer wall, for 20 min and allowed to freely explore the arena. White light of 100 lx was evenly distributed across the arena during testing. Video recordings were taken and analyzed using Biobserve Viewer III (Biobserve GmbH, Germany). A virtual square of equal distance from the periphery (36 \u00d7 36 cm) was defined as the \u201ccentral zone\u201d in order to determine the number of entries, and time (s) spent in the central zone. Distance moved in the outer and central zones (cm), number of entries and time spent in the central zone were registered. Elevated Plus Maze: The elevated plus maze was constructed from black opaque acrylic with white lining on the floor, each arm measuring 30 \u00d7 5 cm and the central platform 5 \u00d7 5 cm. One set of arms, opposing one another, were enclosed completely by a wall of opaque acrylic, 15 cm high, while the other set was open with a ledge of 0.5 cm either side of the arms. The open arms were brightly lit (100 lx). The maze was elevated 50 cm from the ground on a transparent acrylic stand. Each mouse was placed on the central platform, facing towards a closed arm, and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. Biobserve Viewer III tracking software (Biobserve GmbH, Germany) was used to record locomotor activity during the test (distance moved in the open and closed arms), and the number of entries into the closed and open arms and time spent in them. An arm entry was counted when 2 paws had entered an arm, and an arm exit\nwas determined when 2 paws had left the arm. Light dark box: For the light\u2013dark test, a box of white acrylic was used (50 \u00d7 50 cm). The box was partitioned with a white acrylic wall, so that one-third of the total area was dark (\u201cdark chamber\u201d). The remaining two-thirds were brightly lit (100 lx) with white light, which served as the \u201clight chamber.\u201d A small entry door within the partition (5 \u00d7 7 cm), allowed mice to move freely between chambers. Each mouse was placed into the dark chamber facing the end wall parallel to the partition. Activity was recorded for the following 5 min using Biobserve Viewer III (Biobserve GmbH, Germany). Locomotor activity (distance moved in cm) and time (s) in the dark and light chambers, and latent period of first entrance into the light chamber were measured. A single transition was counted when 2 paws had entered a chamber. Novelty suppressed feeding: Animals were deprived from food for 24 h before NSF test. After food deprivation, each mouse was put in the corner of a square white acrylic arena (50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 cm), facing an outer wall. White light of 100 lx was evenly distributed across the arena during testing. A piece of food was placed in the center of the arena. Video recordings were taken and analyzed using Biobserve Viewer III (Biobserve GmbH, Germany). The time (s) before a mouse began eating after the fasting period (24 h) and the distance moved before eating were registered.

Then an animal was returned to the home cage. After 24 h, mice were again placed in this cylinder with water for 5 min. The latency of first floating, and total floating time during days 1 and 2 were recorded manually.

All experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the humane treatment of animals and the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and approved by the local governmental commission for animal health.\nElevated plus maze: A plus-shaped maze was fixed 50 cm high from the floor and contained two open arms (50 \u00d7 10 cm), 2 closed arm with surrounding walls (50 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 40 cm) and a center area (10 \u00d7 10 cm). Each arm was installed in each edge of the center area in order (open arm, closed arm, open arm, closed arm). The illuminations (open arm: 3 lx, closed arm: 14 lx) were followed by the previous protocol (Pum et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2019). Novelty suppressed feeding: An unfamiliar OF (55 \u00d7 55 \u00d7 45 cm), evenly illuminated (corners and center \u223c6 lx), was utilized. A round, transparent dish (d = 7 cm) was placed in the center of the OF containing a thin black rubber to prevent the reflection under lab chow. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol prior to each trial to eliminate the possible odor cues from previous animals. Twenty-four hours before the NSF, rats were food-deprived with free water access. The dish containing 2\u20133 lab chow was placed in the center of the unfamiliar OF before trial start. An animal was placed in one of the corners of the apparatus and allowed to explore freely for a maximum of 15 min, if they did not consume any lab chow. As soon as they were observed to eat, or the 15 min time limit was reached, the trial was terminated immediately. They were removed from the OF and put back to their home cage. Latencies to begin eating (s) and the locomotor activity (cm) were recorded automatically by EthoVision. After completion of behavioral testing, rats were anesthetized with carbon dioxide. Brain DH tissue was collected in 1.3 mL EDTA vial (Sarstedt), and centrifuged at 3,000 RPM at the room temperature for 5 min. NSM activity was analyzed in these samples as described previously (M\u00fchle and Kornhuber 2017; Kalinichenko et al. 2021).\nEmotional behavior after alcohol exposure Alcohol drinking was established in na\u00efve male fro and WT mice (fro: n = 8/7; WT: n = 8/8) using a 2-bottle freechoice drinking paradigm as described above.

Oxidative stress markers were determined using a commercial assay kits according to manufacture protocols. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured using Superoxide Dismutase Assay Kit (706,002; Cayman Chemical, USA), which utilizes a tetrazolium salt for detection of superoxide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. SOD activity was determined as the amount of enzyme ability that exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical and is expressed as [U] per mL of tissue homogenates [U/mL] (M\u00fcller et al. 2017).

Animals had all the time the choice between alcohol (2\u201316 vol. %) or water (Mielenz et al. 2018; M\u00fcller et al. 2019). Male fro mice showed a significantly enhanced alcohol consumption compared to WT controls (2-way ANOVA, factor genotype: F1,35 = 4.3112, P = 0.0452; factor alcohol concentration: F4,140 = 178.7101, P < 0.0001; interaction: F4,140 = 2.1264, P = 0.0807). Preplanned comparisons yielded a significant difference at single doses for 8 vol.% (P = 0.0272),\n12 vol.% (P = 0.0093), and 16 vol.% (P = 0.0355) (Fig. 1a). Lack of NSM function had no significant effect on total fluid consumption in male mice (2-way ANOVA, factor genotype: F1,35 = 1.8867, P = 0.1783; factor alcohol concentration: F4,140 = 8.7073, P < 0.0001; interaction: F4,140 = 1.4655, P = 0.2159). Preplanned comparisons did not show significant difference at single dose level (P > 0.05; Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 1).\nIn order to test whether the NSM effect is an acute effect or depends on developmental lack of NSM function, we tested the effects of an acute pharmacological inhibition of NSM activity on alcohol drinking. Alcohol drinking was enhanced in male C57Bl6 mice in a 2-bottle free-choice drinking test by chronic treatment with the NSM inhibitor GW4869 (Airola and Hannun 2013) administered by osmotic minipumps at a rate of 2 mg/kg/day (i.p.) during alcohol drinking at increasing concentrations (2-way ANOVA, factor treatment: F1,14 = 3.943, P = 0.067; factor alcohol concentration: F4,56 = 200.593, P < 0.0001; interaction: F4,56 = 0.975, P = 0.428). While alcohol consumption was enhanced at all concentrations, preplanned comparisons showed a significant effect only for 4 vol.% alcohol (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1c). No effect of the GW4869 treatment was observed on free water consumption in these animals (2-way ANOVA, factor treatment: F1,14 = 0.182, P = 0.676; factor alcohol concentration: F4,56 = 1.633, P = 0.179; interaction: F4,56 = 1.011, P = 0.409). Preplanned comparisons showed no significant difference on single days (P > 0.05) (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 2). Together these findings suggest an inhibitory role of NSM on freechoice alcohol drinking in male mice.\nAttenuated NSM function delays the establishment, but not retrieval of alcohol conditioned behavior A major driver of alcohol addiction is the establishment and later retrieval of drug seeking behavior. We tested the establishment of an alcohol-induced CPP in fro mice (Huston et al. 2013; Easton, Lucchesi, Lourdusamy, et al. 2013). We found a delayed establishment of an alcohol CPP in male fro mice (Fig. 1e). A 2-way ANOVA confirmed the establishment of an alcohol CPP (factor time: F3,51 = 7.5728, P = 0.0003), but did not show an effect of genotype (F1,17 = 3.1790, P = 0.0925) or interaction (F3,51 = 1.7679, P = 0.1650). Preplanned comparisons showed a significant increase of time in the conditioning compartment in WT mice already at T1 (P = 0.0105) and T3 (P = 0.0009), while for fro mice only at T3 (P = 0.0225). In males, acute locomotor effects of alcohol and conditioned hyperlocomotion were not altered by reduced NSM function (Fig. 1f; 2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,17 = 0.0002, P = 0.9893, factor treatment day: F6,102 = 1.6301, P = 0.1463), interaction: F6,102 = 0.6979, P = 0.6518; preplanned comparisons: all P > 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 3). Our previous studies did not reveal any memory impairments in male fro mice, which could determine the delayed establishment of an\nFig. 1. Neutral sphingomyelinase determines alcohol consumption and conditioned rewarding effects in males. (a) Male mice with a heterozygous NSM-2 knock out (fro) show enhanced alcohol consumption in a 2-bottle free choice paradigm compared to WT controls. (b) Lack of NSM function did not significantly affect total fluid consumption in male mice. (c) Male fro mice show an increased alcohol consumption in a 2-bottle free choice paradigm after pharmacological NSM inhibition with the antagonist GW4869 compared to WT controls (d) inhibition of NSM has no effect on total fluid consumption in male mice. (e). Delayed establishment of alcohol CPP in male fro mice. Alcohol (2 g/kg; i.p.) was paired at 7 occasions with a conditioning (cond.) compartment. CPP was tested after 1 (T1), 3 (T2), and 7 (T3) conditioning and saline-pseudoconditioning trials (Bl\u2014Baseline). (f) No difference in acute or subchronic locomotor response to alcohol during conditioning procedure. (g) NSM is not involved in the establishment of the conditioned reinforcing effects of preferred food in males. (h) An initial preference of the food in fro mice fades with repeated exposure during conditioning. (i) NSM is not involved in the expression of the conditioned reinforcing effects of alcohol in male mice as the 2 NSM inhibitors GW4869 and ES048 applied before CPP retrieval, did not affect CPP expression. (j) No effect of NSM inhibition on locomotor activity during CPP expression in males (P > 0.05).

Therefore, the observed delay appears to be alcohol-induced, but not based on a decline of memory.\nIn order to distinguish a role of NSM in the conditioned reinforcing effects between alcohol and a natural reinforcer, we tested mice also for food-induced CPP, using a highly palatable food that can induce a CPP also\nin satiated mice (Hess et al. 2019). While food worked well as a natural reinforcer in male mice, reduced NSM activity had no effect on CPP establishment (Fig. 1g). A 2-way ANOVA confirmed the establishment of a food CPP (factor time: F3,51 = 3.5621, P = 0.0204), but did not show an effect of genotype (F1,17 = 0.0141, P = 0.9069) or interaction (F3,51 = 0.0933, P = 0.9633). Post-hoc test\nvs. Bl confirmed an overall increase in the time in the conditioning compartment at T2 (P = 0.0099) and T3 (P = 0.05). Food consumption did not differ significantly between male fro and WT mice (P > 0.05) (Fig. 1h; Supplementary Figs. 4\u20136).\nThe expression of a previously established alcohol CPP was not affected by NSM antagonist treatment with ES048 or GW4869 in male mice (Fig. 1i) (2-way ANOVA; factor treatment: F2,23 = 0.0654, P = 0.9368, factor time: F1,23 = 49.4246, P < 0.0001, interaction: F2,23 = 0.0025, P = 0.9974; preplanned comparisons between treatment groups: all P > 0.05). Neither did these treatments affect locomotor activity (P > 0.05; Fig. 1j; Supplementary Figs. 7\u20139).\nAltogether, these findings suggest that NSM is necessary to establish, but not to retrieve the conditioned reinforcing effects of alcohol. It is not involved in the reinforcing action of natural reinforcers.\nSex-specific monoamine transmitter control by NSM Crucial mediators of the reinforcing action and addiction development of alcohol are the DA- and 5-HT-systems and their adaptations after chronic drug exposure (Spanagel 2009; M\u00fcller and Homberg 2015). Previously, a strong interaction of acid sphingomyelinase with brain monoamine tissue levels and alcohol responses were reported (M\u00fcller et al. 2017; Kalinichenko et al. 2019). We used in-vivo microdialysis in freely moving mice to test extracellular monoamine levels and responses to an acute alcohol challenge. Reduced NSM activity led to a significant reduction of basal extracellular DA levels in the DH (t = \u22122.067, P = 0.045), and an increase in 5- HT levels in the Nac (t = 2.160, P = 0.045) (Fig. 2a\u2013g). The DA-response to alcohol was enhanced in the Nac (2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,13 = 0.618, P = 0.446, factor time: F6,78 = 3.753, P = 0.002, interaction: F6,78 = 2.689, P = 0.02; preplanned comparisons vs. baseline (BL), fro: 60 min: P = 0.008; WT, 120 min: P = 0.017; Fig. 2b). Alcohol caused a small, but nonsignificant increase in DH DA levels in fro and WT mice (P > 0.05) (Fig. 2d). Alcohol had no effect on Nac 5-HT levels (P > 0.05; Fig. 2f), but enhanced DH 5-HT levels in male WT mice. This effect in the DH was attenuated in fro mice (2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,12 = 2.416, P = 0.146, factor time: F6,72 = 1.524, P = 0.183, interaction: F6,72 = 0.613, P = 0.719; preplanned comparisons vs. BL, WT, 20 min: P = 0.046, 80 min: P = 0.047; fro, P > 0.05; Fig. 2h).\nSphingomyelinase treatment inhibited 5-HT uptake in synaptosomes from DH (P < 0.01) and vStr (P < 0.05), but not from VH (P > 0.05), of male mice (Fig. 2i). This may explain the increase in Nac extracellular 5-HT levels in fro mice. Altogether, this shows a functional role of NSM in the regulation of basal monoaminergic activity and in the DA- and 5-HT responses to alcohol. In particular, the enhanced Nac DA response may suggest stronger pharmacological reinforcing action of alcohol in\nmale fro mice, and, thus, support an increased alcohol consumption."

Male fro mice showed enhanced depression-like behavior in the FST (Fig. 3b). This difference was eliminated by stress, which caused by itself an increase in depression-like behavior (2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,33 = 0.7713, P = 0.3861, factor stress: F1,33 = 2.4461, P = 0.1273, interaction: F1,33 = 0.7097, P = 0.4056). Preplanned comparisons confirmed more depression-like behavior in fro animals under no-stress conditions (t = 1.8615, P = 0.0391), but not under stress (P > 0.05). There was no overall effect on hedonic tone as measured in the SPT (Fig. 3c; 3- way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,38 = 0.9411, P = 0.9411, factor time: F4,152 = 24.7202, P < 0.0001, factor stress: F1,38 = 0.0174, P = 0.8958; all interactions: P > 0.05).

Neutral sphingomyelinase controls acute and chronic effects of alcohol on monoaminergic signaling in the brain. (a\u2013h) Heterozygous knock out of NSM affects basal extracellular dopamine and serotonin activity in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) and DH of male mice. An alcohol injection (2 g/kg, i.p.) enhanced extracellular dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) activity in the Nac and DH of WT mice. The DA increase in the Nac was enhanced, but the 5-HT increase in the DH was attenuated in fro mice (values are shown as percent baseline (BL), taken as 100%).

Male fro mice showed enhanced anxiety-related behavior in the light dark box test (LDB) test (Fig. 3d; white compartment time, 2- way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,38 = 3.3263, P = 0.076, factor stress: F1,38 = 2.6236, P = 0.1135, interaction: F1,38 = 0.2728, P = 0.6045; preplanned comparison for no-stress: t = \u22121.868, P = 0.0391; dark compartment time; 2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,38 = 3.335, P = 0.0757, factor stress: F1,38 = 2.715, P = 0.1076, interaction: F1,38 = 0.274, P = 0.6036; preplanned comparison for no-stress: t = 1.869, P = 0.0389). In the elevated plus maze test (EPM) test, fro mice showed more anxiety-like behavior than WT mice, a difference also eliminated by the effects of stress (Fig. 3e; 2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,37 = 0.8460, P = 0.3636, factor stress: F1,37 = 17.5239, P = 0.0002, interaction: F1,37 = 0.0153, P = 0.9021; preplanned comparison for no-stress: P = 0.0029). Also the OF test revealed an increase in anxiety-related behavior in fro mice, which was, however, not stress sensitive (Fig. 3f; 2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,40 = 4.9183, P = 4.9183, factor stress: F1,40 = 0.5729, P = 0.4535, interaction: F1,40 = 0.0773, P = 0.7824; preplanned comparison for no-stress: t = \u22122.3542, P = 0.0151; Supplementary Figs. 10\u201313).\nA pharmacological inhibition of NSM activity with GW4869 in naive male mice confirmed an increase in depression-like behavior in the NSF test (t = \u22121.779, P = 0.05; Fig. 3g), but had no effect on anxiety-like behavior in the EPM (P > 0.05; Fig. 3h) and OF test (P > 0.05; Fig. 3i). Neither did it affect locomotor activity (Supplementary Fig. 14). This relationship could be confirmed in a study of na\u00efve male rats where we investigated brain NSM activity in the DH and used it as a predictor for depressive-like behavior. Results suggested that animals with low NSM activity in the DH after a median split (t = 5965, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3j) show significantly more depression-like behavior in the NSF test (t =\u22122067, P = 0.05; Fig. 3k), but not more anxiety-like behavior in the EPM test (P > 0.05; Fig. 3l). Altogether, these findings suggest a strong depressogenic and partial anxiogenic effect resulting from reduced NSM activity. Thereby, NSM activity in the DH may serve as a specific predictor for depression-like behavior.\nBrain area volumes are controlled by NSM After observing strong effects of NSM on drug rewardedand emotional behavior, which mainly arise from a developmental origin, we tested structural neuroanatomy of male fro mice after chronic consumption of alcohol or water using MRI (Mielenz et al. 2018; M\u00fcller et al. 2019). This analysis revealed that fro mice show a significantly reduced volume of the DH (2- way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,27 = 14.591, P = 0.001, factor alcohol: F1,27 = 14.862, P = 0.001, interaction: F1,27 = 0.345, P = 0.562; preplanned comparisons, water: fro vs. WT, P = 0.004; alcohol: fro vs. WT, P = 0.033; Fig. 4a), the vStr (2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,28 = 3.420,\nFig. 3.

A sample of na\u00efve male rats was analyzed for emotional behavior and NSM activity in the dorsal hippocampus. (j) A median split of this sample by NSM activity yielded a high and a low NSM activity group, which differed significantly in NSM activity. (k) Naturally low NSM activity predicts enhanced depression-like behavior in the NSF test, but (l) no anxietyrelated behavior in the EPM test. All results show mean \u00b1 SEM (\u2217P \u2264 0.05, \u2217\u2217P \u2264 0.01, \u2217\u2217P \u2264 0.001).\nP = 0.075, factor alcohol: F1,28 = 0.902, P = 0.350, interaction: F1,28 = 2.410, P = 0.132; preplanned comparisons, water: fro vs. WT, P = 0.023; alcohol: fro vs. WT, P = 0.835; Fig. 4c), and the cerebellum (2-way ANOVA; factor genotype: F1,28 = 2.857, P = 0.102, factor alcohol: F1,28 = 1.496,\nP = 0.231, interaction: F1,28 = 1.325, P = 0.259; preplanned comparisons, water: fro vs. WT, P = 0.05; alcohol: fro vs. WT, P = 0.706; Fig. 4f). No effects were found in other structures, such as the insular cortex, dorsal striatum, or amygdala (P > 0.05; Fig. 4b, d, e). As these areas are involved in emotional behavior (Gulbins et al. 2013, 2018) and alcohol abuse (Krishnan and Nestler 2008; M\u00fcller et al. 2017), attenuated processing capacity may partly explain the enhanced depression- and anxietylevels in the male fro mice. Voluntary alcohol drinking for 46 days decreased the DH volume, but maintained genotype differences. This is in line with previous reports of hippocampal cell loss in males after prolonged alcohol consumption (Walker et al. 1980). In contrast, alcohol consumption enhanced vStr volume in male fro mice up to the level of WT mice.\nAltogether, morphological analysis suggests that NSM effects on emotional behavior and alcohol drinking may be mediated by its role in brain development. Significant deficits in particular in the DH and vStr may be the base for reduced control of these behaviors in adult males."

A reduction of NSM activity led to an increase in neural stem- and earlyprogenitor cells (Fig. 4g; water: P < 0.05; alcohol: P < 0.05), which, however, did not translate into enhanced number of proliferating cells (Fig. 4h), activated stem cells (Fig. 4i), or newborn neurons and neuroblasts (Fig. 4j) (P > 0.05). Chronic and binge alcohol exposure has been shown to reduce hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis in male rats (Nixon and Crews 2002; He et al. 2005) and humans (Le Maitre et al. 2018). However, the current voluntary alcohol drinking scheme did not affect neurogenesis to such an extent. Accordingly, NSM effects on DH neurogenesis may not account for the reduced DH volume in male fro mice."

            "text": "Brain area volume and functional circuit efficacy may also be controlled by regional oxidative stress, as there is a close interaction of sphingolipids with the regulation of oxidative stress (Stranahan et al. 2011). Oxidative stress, in turn, controls NSM phosphorylation (Filosto et al. 2010). Chronic voluntary alcohol consumption attenuated protective superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the DH of fro mice (Fig. 4k). This effect was eliminated by chronic alcohol consumption (2-way-ANOVA; factor: genotype: F1,20 = 4.686, P = 0.0426; factor: treatment: F1,20 = 2.021, P = 0.1705; interaction: F1,20 = 3.069, P = 0.0951; preplanned comparison, water: fro vs. WT: P < 0.0236). Catalase activity and lipid peroxidation, in contrast, were not affected (P > 0.05; Fig. 4l and m). These findings may suggest that a reduction in protective SOD activity\nmay contribute to volume loss in this region. However, it may not account for further decline after alcohol consumption.\nNSM controls lipidome adaptations to alcohol Chronic alcohol consumption is known to lead to large-scale adaptations in brain protein expression, which has direct effects on behavior. Addiction-related behaviors become established, but also virtually all other behaviors are altered. However, little is known about the effects on the lipidome, which can be crucial for the control of the emotional state and behavior (Oliveira et al. 2016). Here we investigated alterations in the lipidome after voluntary alcohol drinking and the role of the NSM. In male mice, chronic alcohol drinking led to a significant decline of triacylglycerol (TG), dihydro-shingomyeline (dhSM), globotriaosylceramide (GB3), bis(monoacyl)glycerol (BMP), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophopphatidylinositol (LPI) in the Nac (Fig. 5a). Reduced NSM activity alone enhanced only dhSM levels. However, it rendered the organism much more susceptible to alcohol effects on the lipidome, as now 20 of the 34 investigated lipid families were dysregulated in fro mice drinking alcohol. All were down-regulated, except monohexosylceramide (MhCer), which was up-regulated. Those included sphingomyelin (SM), the NSM substrate, but not ceramide (Cer), the catalysis product, when whole families were considered (Fig. 5b). However, a SM- and Cer-species analysis revealed a significant decline of Cer 16:0 after alcohol alone, which was prevented in fro mice (Fig. 5c). NSM was shown to control Cer generation in the brain (Tabatadze et al. 2010; Airola et al. 2017), which crucially shapes neuronal cell membrane structure and function (Hannun and Obeid 2008; van Meer et al. 2008). In this study, reduced NSM activity alone decreased Cer 22:0 levels and sensitized for reducing effects of alcohol on many Cer species of which Cer 20:1, Cer 22:1, and Cer 24:0 effects reached statistical significance. Chronic alcohol consumption alone reduced local Nac levels of virtually all SM species, which was significant for SM 22:0, SM 24:0, SM 24:1, SM 26:0, and SM 26:1 (Fig. 5d). Reduced NSM activity had no significant effects on local SM species in the Nac, but largely potentiated alcohol\u2019s declining effects in a way that all 12 detectable SM species were declined in fro mice after alcohol drinking. A strong potentiation of alcohol-induced increase by reduced NSM activity was also seen in 22 of the 24 detectable MhCer species, and a potentiation of the decrease in 5 of the 24 detectable lactosylceramide (LacCer) species (Supplementary Figs. 15\u201318). Together, these findings suggest that reduced NSM activity enhances lipidomic sensitivity for chronic alcohol effects."

An important role of NSM in bone mineralization is known from fragile oss syndrome, a natural occurring mutation with a homozygous SMPD3 deletion resulting\nFig. 5.

Here we asked whether the observed NSM role in sexdifferences may also have a peripheral pathway involving bone\u2013brain signaling. We used bone CT and measured whether attenuated NSM function would lead to any deficits in bone density. We found that the NSM activity deficit did not change bone density in male mice in the scalp, spinal cord, femur, tibia, humerus, and radius/ulna (P > 0.05; Fig. 6a\u2013f). This is in line with previous reports on heterozygous fro mice, and in contrast to null mutations depleting the organism of all NSM activity and inducing\ngrowth retardation and reduced bone mineralization (Aubin et al. 2005; Stoffel et al. 2005; Khavandgar et al. 2011). These findings confirm that a heterozygous NSM deletion is not sufficient to induce bone deficits in male mice.\nUncarboxylated osteocalcin is an inductor of bone mineralization in osteoblasts. Predominantly decarboxylated osteocalcin is released from osteoblast. Once released to the blood, osteocalcin reaches Gprc6a receptors in peripheral organs.

(a\u2013f) Reduced function of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (NSM) in male heterozygous NSM knock out (fro) mice has no effect on bone density, as measured with CT, compared to WT controls.

(h) Chronic administration of osteocalcin (OSTEO; 0.03 \u03bcg/30 g/h, i.p.) in male C57Bl6 mice for 28 days via osmotic mini-pumps attenuated alcohol consumption in a 2-bottle free-choice test, with (i) a small reduction in overall fluid intake.

Peripheral osteocalcin action was linked to the acute stress response (Berger et al. 2019), while centrally acting osteocalcin can improve cognitive performance (Oury et al. 2013). Here we found that male fro mice show an upregulation of blood total osteocalcin levels (t = 1.7970, P = 0.0457; Fig. 6g). In order to test whether this signal would serve as an additional mediator of the NSM-induced alcohol drinking and emotional phenotype, we treated na\u00efve C57Bl6J mice\nfor 28 days with bioactive mouse osteocalcin (0.03 \u03bcg/h, i.p.) using osmotic mini-pumps. In males, osteocalcin treatment reduced alcohol consumption (2-way ANOVA, factor treatment: F1,13 = 2.351, P = 0.1491, factor alcohol concentration: F4,52 = 213.529, P < 0.0001, interaction: F4,52 = 0.719, P = 0.5825; preplanned comparisons: 16%: P = 0.0348; Fig. 6h), but also total fluid consumption in a 2-bottle free-choice drinking test (2-way ANOVA, factor treatment: F1,13 = 4.149, P = 0.0625, factor alcohol\nconcentration: F4,52 = 0.535, P = 0.7108, interaction: F4, 52 = 0.972, P = 0.4306; preplanned comparisons: 16%: P = 0.0108; Fig. 6i).

It did also not change locomotor activity (P > 0.05; Fig. 6m). As the osteocalcin effects dissociate from the fro behavioral phenotype, present findings may suggest that osteocalcin is a counter-regulatory signal that works to eliminate (bone) or restrict (behavior) the effects of NSM reduction."

            "text": "We discovered that spontaneous genetic variations in the SMPD3 gene are related alcohol abuse and affective control in humans, which may further contribute to the shared genetic base of alcohol abuse and affective behavior (Mielenz et al. 2018; Walters et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2020). SMPD3 was selectively related to hippocampal size in the brain, but also to bone mineralization in the body periphery (Kalinichenko et al. 2021). Here we found in male mice that tonically reduced NSM activity enhanced alcohol consumption. Pharmacological NSM inhibition confirmed this role of NSM in alcohol drinking in males. In contrast, the NSM appeared to be required for the establishment, but not the expression of alcohol\u2019s conditioned rewarding effects. A delayed establishment of the conditioned reinforcing effects may be due to its role in spatial cue memory that depends in particular on NSM activity in the Nac and DH (Kalinichenko et al. 2020) and on AMPA and NMDA receptor formation (Wheeler et al. 2009; Tabatadze et al. 2010). However, the NSM is not required for the establishment of the conditioned reinforcing effects of a natural reinforcer.\nThe sphingolipids landscape has a profound effect on monoaminergic signaling in the brain, which can determine affective and cognitive behavior (Huston et al. 2016; Kalinichenko et al. 2020). Here we report a NSM control of dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling. In male mice, a reduced NSM activity attenuated 5-HT uptake and enhanced extracellular 5-HT activity in the Nac, while it attenuated spontaneous DA activity in the DH. This dissociating effect may result from distinct NSM regulation of DA and 5-HT uptake (Won et al. 2018). A previous study also showed reduction of DA uptake after reduced NSM inhibition in a PC12 cell model (Kim, Ahn, Ji, et al. 2010b). In the Nac, reduced NSM function potentiated the rather weak DA and 5-HT response to alcohol, which supports the reinforcing action and probably contributed to the enhanced alcohol drinking shown by these mice. A reduction of the 5-HT response to alcohol may be a reason for the delayed establishment of the spatial-related conditioned alcohol behaviors (Huston et al. 2013; M\u00fcller and Homberg 2015). Alcohol drinking enhanced 5-HT1A-R and 5HT2C-R, as well as DAT and SERT mRNA expression\nin the DH. All those effects were absent in male mice with reduced NSM function. In that, reduced NSM function may provide a protection against chronic adaptations in the DA- and 5-HT-systems to alcohol exposure.\nReduced NSM activity led to a significantly enhanced level of depression- and anxiety-related behavior in male mice. Thereby, anxiety effects may be developmentally induced (Stoffel et al. 2005), as they did not occur after acute pharmacological NSM inhibition. Depressogenic effect, in contrast, have been also seen after acute NSM inhibition. Thus, there may also be an acute NSM influence on this behavior. This may be further supported by the effects of chronic stress, which eliminated the NSMeffects and caused a massive anxiety and depressionlike response. The disadvantageous affective phenotype coincided with a reduced volume of the DH, vStr, and cerebellum. In particular, reduced capacity of the DH may render males more stress susceptible and facilitates depression-like behavior. In males, it was shown, that NSM is required for the excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons (Norman et al. 2010). Chronically reduced NSM activity may, therefore, attenuated DH function at a large scale and drive depression- and anxiety like behavior.\nInterestingly, male fro mice did not consume alcohol to self-manage their aversive emotional phenotype. Behavioral analysis showed that emotional behaviors were not affected after chronic alcohol drinking with self-titration. A previous study showed that a depressive/anxious phenotype induced by overexpression of ASM and resulting ceramide overload (Gulbins et al. 2013), may use alcohol to partially re-establish sphingolipid- and monoamine homeostasis in the Nac, and by that way, remit the aversive emotional phenotype (M\u00fcller et al. 2017; M\u00fcller and Kornhuber 2017). However, this mechanism was sexdependent, predominantly emerging in females. While reduced NSM function induces a comparable phenotype in males, it has distinct effects on the lipidome and brain area development, for which further alcohol use may not be beneficial and rather work to worsen lipid allostasis. In male mice, voluntary alcohol drinking eliminated brain volume differences in the vStr and cerebellum. However, it further reduced DH volume in fro and WT mice. A reduction in NSM activity had little persistent effects on hippocampal neurogenesis in males. However, reduced NSM activity attenuated protective SOD activity against oxidative stress in the DH. This effect may contribute to an attenuated DH volume development in male fro mice.\nThe partial reduction of NSM activity caused a down regulation of TG, dhSM, GB3, BMP, LPE, and LPI in the Nac. The biggest effect, however, was seen in the susceptibility of the lipidome to chronic voluntary alcohol intake. This was much enhanced in males with reduced NSM activity. Now 19 of the 34 investigated lipid families were downregulated, and one upregulated. A single species analysis for Cer and SM species showed a significant decline of Cer 16:0 after alcohol consumption, which may support an antidepressant effect (Gulbins et al. 2013; Zoicas, Schumacher, et al. 2020). The decline of other\nspecies, like Cer 20:1, Cer 22:1, and Cer 24:0, may suggest enhanced plasticity and learning in male fro mice (Huston et al. 2016). It should be noted that this were the effects of chronic voluntary alcohol consumption with permanent alcohol access and the possibility of self-titration. Binge consumption of alcohol over short periods of time, however, was shown to yield a rather different pattern of Cer responses in the cortex of male rats. This is dominated by an acute decline in several desaturated Cer species and MhCer species, and an increase in Cer during withdrawal (Bae et al. 2014; Roux et al. 2015). A generally favorable effect of alcohol drinking on forebrain total Cer levels was previously suggested by Godfrey et al. (2015), that was possibly mediated by a downregulation of sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase. As such, alcohol appears to have an unique effect on the brain sphingolipidome, which may directly affect drinking behavior, but to a smaller extent emotional behavior, in males.\nMale mice with reduced NSM function did not show deficits in bone integrity, but an upregulation of blood osteocalcin levels. Chronic osteocalcin treatment in na\u00efve mice, however, did not mimic the male fro mice phenotype of enhanced alcohol consumption, but rather showed similar effects as in females (Kalinichenko et al. 2021). This may suggest that the peripheral osteocalcin response counteracts central effects of NSM on alcohol consumption in males. This effect is in line with findings from male osteocalcin knock out mice, which showed an enhanced alcohol consumption (Patterson-Buckendahl et al. 2018). Also the effects of osteocalcin on affective behavior were different from females. In males, osteocalcin had a clear anxiolytic effect, but no effect on depression-like behavior. As such, peripheral osteocalcin may also counteract central NSM effects on affective behavior in males. Altogether, the findings suggest that SMPD3 and NSM control alcohol drinking and the emotional behavior in males by several central mechanisms, which are partly attenuated by peripheral, bone-mediated action.\nAn important finding of this study is that although SMPD3 and NSM are associated with alcohol abuse behaviors, depression/anxiety as well as bone mineralization. The neurobiological mechanisms of this association differ remarkably between males and females. Female mice with attenuated NSM function showed reduced anxiety and depression, as well as a reduced alcohol consumption. This protection may be mediated by enhanced volume of DH and insular cortex in female fro mice. This advantage, however disappeared after chronic alcohol consumption together with behavioral protection and benefits. In females, lack of NSM function did not affect lipidomic regulation very much (Kalinichenko et al. 2021). As such, centrally acting mechanisms of NSM controlling emotional and addiction-like behavior show a considerable sexdimorphism. Not so peripheral effects of the NSM, when they provoked counter regulatory processes affecting\nbehavioral control by an indirect pathway. An NSM reduction led to a compensatory osteocalcin response, which is most likely responsible for maintenance of bone integrity in the partial absence of NSM a key factor for bone mineralization (Aubin et al. 2005). Once released into the blood it can reach the brain and bind to osteocalcin- and orphan-receptors (Obri et al. 2018). Behavioral effects of this bone\u2013brain communication were shown for learning and memory as well as in emotional behavior, but in females only (Oury et al. 2013; Khrimian et al. 2017). We found that this osteocalcin response has similar effects in males and females, in that it attenuates alcohol consumption and reduces anxiety(males) and depression (females)-related behaviors. Anxiolytic effects of osteocalcin were reported in female mice in a previous study, which were mediated by brain GPR158 receptors (Khrimian et al. 2017).\nThe observed gender-specific differences of NSM involvement in the control of affective behavior might be related to the interaction between the ceramide system and sex hormones. Clinical studies showed that blood levels of ceramides, particularly long-chain ceramides, differ in a gender-specific way (Ishikawa et al. 2013; Weir et al. 2013; Mielke et al. 2015), and might correlate with circulating levels of estradiol in women (Pan et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2015). In vitro studies showed that estradiol downregulated ceramide levels probably via the suppression of de novo ceramide synthesis pathway (Pan et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2015; Vozella et al. 2019). The gender-specific differences in ceramide levels might be followed by changes in the receptor functioning, which may in turn affect the behavioral patterns. Particularly, the study of Kalinichenko et al. (2020) revealed profound sex-differences in the NSM contribution to various types of memory based on the differences in NMDA receptor functioning.\nIn summary, we demonstrate a role for the NSM in alcohol consumption and conditioned alcohol effects, as well as in affective behavior in males. Thereby, no alcohol use for self-medication of an aversive affective state was observed under NSM control. The observed effects on alcohol consumption may be mediated by an NSM control of acute and chronic monoaminergic responses and lipidomic adaptations to alcohol exposure. Counterregulatory action emerged, driven by peripheral NSM effe, cts on bone\u2013brain signaling with osteocalcin. Importantly, central, but not peripheral NSM action appeared to be highly sex-dependent and may serve as a key mechanism for the sex differences in alcohol abuse and instrumentalization. Our data support the idea of targeting NSM activity in a sex-specific treatment approach of alcohol abuse that involves affective disorder symptoms."
