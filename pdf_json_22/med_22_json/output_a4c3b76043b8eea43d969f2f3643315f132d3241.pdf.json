Sukhikh\nFederal State Budget Institution (FSBI) National Medical Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology named after Academician V.I. Kulakov Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russia\nThe major limitations associated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) triggering are inferior clinical outcomes in fresh embryo transfer cycles caused by luteal phase insufficiency following the GnRHa triggering. We included 153 high-risk patients in this study. In group I, the patients received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) trigger + 1,500 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) support on the oocyte pick-up (OPU) day; in group II, the patients had a dual trigger (GnRHa + 1,500 IU hCG); and in group III (control), 10,000 IU hCG trigger was prescribed for the final oocyte maturation. The levels of LH, estradiol, and progesterone were evaluated in serum on the stimulation starting day, day 6 of stimulation, on the day of the trigger administration, OPU day, days 3 and 5 post-OPU, and day 14 post-ET, as well as in follicular fluid. Progesterone concentration was significantly lower in group I on OPU+5 compared to the hCG group (I vs. III, \u0440 = 0.0065). Progesterone levels were significantly lower in group II in serum on OPU+5 compared to groups I and III (I vs. II, \u0440 = 0.0068; II vs. III, \u0440 = 1.76 \u00d7 108). The progesterone levels were significantly higher in follicular fluid in group III compared to the study groups (I vs. III, \u0440 = 0.002; II vs. III, p = 0.009). However, no significant differences in clinical outcomes were found between the groups. Then, we divided all women into pregnant and non-pregnant groups and found that estradiol (p = 0.00009) and progesterone (p = 0.000036) on the day of the pregnancy test were significantly higher in the pregnant women group. Also, progesterone on OPU day was significantly higher in the non-pregnant group (p = 0.033). Two cases of moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) late-onset occurred in group I (3.5%, 2/56), no case of moderate/severe OHSS late-onset in group II, and three cases of moderate late-onset in group III (5.7%,\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\n3/53). The low-dose hCG supplementation improves the luteal phase insufficiency after GnRHa triggering, which is confirmed by the comparable pregnancy rates in fresh transfer cycles between the groups. However, lowdose hCG carries a similar risk of OHSS as the full dose of hCG in highresponder patients.\nKEYWORDS\nGnRH agonist trigger, dual trigger, modified luteal support, progesterone, OHSS"

            "text": "The luteal phase insufficiency is leading to inferior clinical outcomes in fresh embryo transfer cycles after using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) for oocyte maturation. This became the main limitation for GnRH triggering implementation in fresh cycles despite an effective avoidance of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (1). This negative outcome is the result of a luteal phase defect caused by the reduced luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and fast luteolysis (2). The GnRH agonist-induced surge lasts less than 48 h, which is crucial for corpus luteum support (3).\nA recent Cochrane review demonstrated that GnRHa triggering is associated with low clinical pregnancy rates and high rates of early pregnancy loss (4, 5) despite good embryological outcomes (6\u20138). It is still an open question regarding the optimal protocol for luteal phase support after GnRHa triggering (9, 10). The main approaches that are used to overcome luteal phase insufficiency are i) luteal support with high doses of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) or ii) application of a single low-dose hCG bolus for the luteal phase rescue (10, 11).\nAccording to current data, intensive luteal phase support is not enough for luteal phase insufficiency correction after GnRHa trigger in patients with peak E2 <4,000 pg/ml compared with those with peak E2 <4,000 pg/ml (11). The serum LH on the day of a trigger is one of the strictest predictors of pregnancy. The authors conclude that some form of LH supplementation after the GnRHa trigger may be necessary for corpus luteum support and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) success in high-risk patients with peak E2 <4,000 pg/ml (11). However, the LH/hCG supplementation in high-responder patients could increase the risk of OHSS development (12, 13).\nThis prospective observational study aimed to evaluate the levels of estradiol and progesterone and a low-dose bolus on OPU or dual trigger in high-risk patients after GnRHa agonist triggering versus the standard hCG trigger in fresh embryo transfer cycles.\n02"

In group II (n = 44), patients received a dual trigger (triptorelin 0.2 mg + 1,500 IU hCG) (16). In group III (n = 53), the control group, patients received a fulldose hCG trigger (10,000 IU Pregnyl, Organon, Oss, the Netherlands). The oocyte trigger was chosen by chance by a physician involved in the study.\nAll patients in groups I and II received luteal phase support with micronized P 600 mg/day (Utrogestan; Olvera, Spain; Besins Manufacturing, Belgium) and estradiol valerate 4 mg/ day (Proginova; Lanno, France; Bayer Pharma AG, Germany) starting on the day after OPU. In group III, patients received micronized P 600 mg/day only, starting on the day after OPU.\nIn the study, we considered the late-onset forms of OHSS. Because all patients that were enrolled for analysis were allowed fresh ET and did not have early OHSS, the severity of OHSS was graded using the Golan classification (17).

Thus, no cases of OHSS were observed in the GnRHa group with the hCG support on OPU day in women at risk of OHSS with an E2 peak of 7,936 pmol/ml (20); only one case of late-onset OHSS was reported (n = 182) using the dual trigger approach despite the inclusion of high responders (a mean peak E2 level of 4,748 \u00b1 1,493 pg/ml) (16). According to the latest publication, there was no difference in live birth rates and OHSS between patients who received low-dose hCG at the time of GnRH agonist trigger (dual trigger) and those who received low-dose hCG at the time of oocyte retrieval; however, the authors show that the cases of\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 06\nOHSS in the group who received low-dose hCG at the time of oocyte retrieval were moderate, while the one case of OHSS in the dual trigger group was mild (21).\nHowever, some studies demonstrated a 16.2%\u201326% incidence of mild to moderate OHSS after GnRHa triggering following lowdose hCG luteal support on OPU day (12, 22) and a 9% incidence after the dual triggering in the high-responder patients (23).\nAfter hormonal level analysis, we found that the LH concentrations were significantly lower on the OPU day in the hCG group (Table 2), and the same result was observed in follicular fluid, too (Table 3), which is the result of induced endogenous LH surge.\nThe progesterone levels were significantly lower on OPU+5 in the study groups compared to the hCG group (Table 2). We supposed that it is the result of corpus luteum luteolysis, even when low doses of hCG were added. However, the progesterone concentrations required for pregnancy in the fresh ET cycle were not known.\nAs the ovarian stimulation by itself and hCG as a trigger are not natural processes and induce superphysiological hormonal levels and multiple follicular growth with unnaturally long hCG corpus luteum support [the hCG surge lasts for 7\u201310 days after administration reaching a peak after 24 h (24) with a mean halflife of 2.32 days (55 h) (25)], the GnRH agonist approach is more natural for oocyte triggering, as it induces the FSH and LH surge which lasts only 24\u201336 h (24, 26).\nThe progesterone levels were significantly higher in follicular fluid in group III compared to the study groups (Table 3), which\nfronti\nTABLE 5 LH, estradiol, and progesterone concentrations in follicular fluid in pregnant and non-pregnant women.\nHormonal profile\nNon-pregnant\n(n = 38)\nPregnant women (n = 16)\npvalue\nLH, IU/L 7.98 (2.05; 11.6) 7.06 (2.225; 10.65) 0.734\nProgesterone, \u00b5mol/l micromole/l\n20.11 (14.48; 33.96)\n23.65 (14; 35.01) 0.844\nEstradiol, \u00b5mol/l micromole/l\n1.3 (0.86; 1.86) 1.22 (0.74; 2.14) 0.793\nValues are median (25%\u201375%) unless otherwise noted.

No correlation was found between the studied parameters and the IVF outcomes during the early luteal phase. Only on the day of the pregnancy test, the estradiol level was significantly higher in the blood serum of pregnant women compared to that of nonpregnant patients in all groups (Table 6), while the progesterone concentrations were significantly higher in the blood serum in the hCG group than those in pregnant women (Table 6).\nThus, high-responder patients who had GnRH agonist triggering with further modified luteal support (groups I and II) had sufficient concentrations of estradiol and progesterone for pregnancy support, and even the levels of progesterone were significantly different between the groups on OPU+5 (Table 2).\nThen, we divided all women into pregnant and nonpregnant groups, and as expected, we found that estradiol (p = 0.00009) and progesterone (p = 0.000036) on the day of the pregnancy test were significantly higher in the pregnant women group (Table 4). It is complementary to previously reported data (27) and could be the result of the endogenous hCG corpus luteum support.\nAlso, progesterone on OPU day was significantly higher in the non-pregnant group (p = 0.033). Despite that we did not find premature luteinization during stimulation in the present study, it is known that progesterone receptor expression in stimulated cycle endometria is similar to the one described during the first days of the luteal phase in natural cycles, and supraphysiological concentrations of steroid hormones might cause accentuated maturation of the endometrium in IVF cycles (28). So, we supposed that higher progesterone levels in the OPU phase could affect the endometrium.\nThe estradiol levels on OPU+3 (p = 0.045) and OPU+5 (p = 0.047) were significantly higher in the pregnant women group; however, the p-value was near the 0.05 threshold, so further studies are needed to evaluate this tendency (Table 4). The progesterone levels during this period did not show any difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women (Table 4).\nAll measured hormones in follicular fluid were comparable between pregnant and non-pregnant women (Table 5). We supposed that further investigations are needed to clarify the role of estradiol and progesterone in pregnancy prediction.\nAn interesting result of the influence of luteal serum progesterone levels on live birth rates was shown by Thomsen et al.

The authors reported that serum progesterone levels of 60\u2013100 nmol/L in the early luteal phase and 150\u2013250 nmol/L during the mid-luteal phase correlated with the high chances of pregnancy in fresh embryo transfer cycles.

Also, according to a 2014 review, the minimum mid-luteal progesterone threshold is approximately 80\u2013100 nmol/L, which correlates with an early pregnancy loss reduction and an increased live birth rate (29).\nAs a consequence, we ranged our results according to progesterone levels (1: progesterone levels of 60\u2013100 nmol/L, 2: progesterone levels of 150\u2013250 nmol/L, and 3: progesterone levels >400 nmol/L) on OPU+3 and OPU+5 and measured the correlation between pregnancy rates and early pregnancy loss; however, no difference was observed.\nIn line with the present study, the recent data from Kaye et al. demonstrated that corpus luteum function was higher when low-dose hCG was given on the OPU day compared with adjuvant hCG given on the ovulation trigger day. Though both methods of hCG support effectively improved the luteal phase insufficiency and led to high pregnancy rates, the authors concluded that the potential for OHSS risk with increased corpus luteum activity after hCG on the OPU day should be considered (30). Thus, they reported about three cases of mild\u2013 moderate OHSS in the group receiving adjuvant hCG on the OPU day (15%) and one in the group receiving the dual trigger (10%) (30). The authors supposed that the difference in hormonal profile between the groups with different timing of hCG supplementation could be the result of differences in corpus luteum age as the hCG-stimulated steroidogenic response is\ndependent on the age of the corpus luteum and steroidogenic acute regulatory gene expression (30, 31).\nIn the present study, we did not find any difference in the treatment success rates between the GnRHa (groups I and II) and the hCG triggering groups, and the reproductive outcomes of the study groups were similar to those of previous studies.\nAccording to previous data, the ongoing pregnancy rate after GnRHa triggering plus the administration of a low dose of hCG on OPU day was reported to be 28%\u201337.1% (12, 20). Also, previous studies demonstrated the ongoing pregnancy rate of 57.7%\u201358.8% after dual triggering in fresh ET cycles (11, 16).\nThe current prospective randomized double-blind research that compared the timing of hCG (on ovulation triggering day or on the OPU day) supplementation after GnRHa triggering reported comparable live birth rates between the dual trigger group and the GnRHa group with hCG on OPU day (14/34, 41.2% vs. 21/37, 56.8%, p = 0.19), with OHSS rates of 9.7% and 3.8%, respectively (21).\nThe major limitations of this work are the small subset of patients and the non-randomization design. Also, another study limitation is that for the initial same size calculation, we used the early OHSS rate and not the serum hormonal concentrations and late-onset OHSS rate because late OHSS is not a common complication. In addition, in the study of Datta et al., no lateonset OHSS occurred in the GnRH agonist triggering and hCG groups; in contrast, the incidence of early mild-to-moderate OHSS was 16.2% with the GnRHa trigger and 31.0% with the HCG trigger (12). In the study of Humaidan et al., only two cases of moderate late-onset OHSS occurred in the hCG group, and\nTABLE 7 Embryological outcome.\nGnRHa group (n = 56) Dual trigger group (n = 44) hCG group (n = 53) p-value\nOocytes, n 13 (11; 16) 12 (10; 14) 14 (12; 16) 0.147\nMII oocytes, n 11 (9; 13) 10 (8; 12) 12 (10; 14) 0.242\n2PN, n 8 (6; 11) 7 (5; 10) 10 (8; 11) 0.174\nFertilization rate (IVF) 77% 71% 79% 0.472\nFertilization rate (ICSI) 86% 78% 82% 0.374\nBlastocysts, n 5.5 (3; 8) 4 (2.5; 6.5) 5 (2; 7) 0.153\nTop-quality embryos, n 3 (1; 6) 3 (1; 4) 3 (0; 5) 0.349\nValues are median (25%\u201375%) unless otherwise noted.

Moreover, the strength of the present study is that it involves good prognosis patients in terms of patient characteristics: young women with normal body mass index; high ovarian reserve without any burdened anamnesis, which reduces the effect of patient-dependent risk factors on the effectiveness of the IVF program; and the close monitoring of the patient\u2019s hormonal response during ovarian stimulation and early luteal phase.\nWe believe that more studies are needed on luteal support avoiding low-dose hCG administration, with high doses of estradiol and progesterone only (10), because a single bolus hCG support for luteal phase rescue does not eliminate OHSS.\nBased on the present data, we concluded that modified luteal support including a small dose of hCG effectively supports corpus luteum function, which results in similar pregnancy and OHSS rates compared to full-dose hCG in highresponder patients."
