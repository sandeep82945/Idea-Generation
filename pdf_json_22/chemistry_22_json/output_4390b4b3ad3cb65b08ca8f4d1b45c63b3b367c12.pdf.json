    "abstractText": "New azomethine compounds of 2-(N-tosylamino) benzaldehyde or 5-chloro-2-(N-tosylamino) benzaldehyde and the corresponding chlorine-substituted anilines, zinc(II) complexes based on them have been synthesized. The structures of azomethines and their complexes were determined by elemental analysis, IR, 1H NMR, X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. It is found that all ZnL2 complexes have a tetrahedral structure according to XAFS and X-ray diffraction data. The photoluminescent properties of azomethines and zinc complexes in methylene chloride solution and in solid form have been studied. It is shown that the photoluminescence quantum yields of solid samples of the complexes are an order of magnitude higher compared to the solutions and range from 11.34% to 48.3%. The thermal properties of Zn(II) complexes were determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry. The TGA curves of all the compounds suggest their high thermal stability up to temperatures higher than 290 \u25e6C. The electrochemical properties of all complexes were investigated by the cyclic voltammetry method. The multilayered devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NPD/Zn complex/ TPBI/LiF/Al with wide electroluminescence (EL) color range spanning the range from bluish-green (494 nm) to green (533 nm) and the high values of brightness, current and power efficiency were fabricated. The biological activity of azomethines and zinc complexes has been studied. In the case of complexes, the protistocidal activity of the zinc complex with azomethine of 5-chloro-2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde with 4-chloroaniline was two times higher than the activity of the reference drug toltrazuril.",

            "text": "For a long time, the interest of researchers in the synthesis and study of the physicochemical properties of new Schiff bases by salicylaldehyde derivatives and transition metal complexes based on them has not faded [1\u20133]. Significant progress in this area is primarily due to the practical importance of these compounds. In particular, these compounds demonstrate a wide range of biological activity [4,5] exhibiting antifungal [6,7], antibacterial [6\u20138], anticancer [9\u201313], and antiviral [14] properties, which determines their demand by medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232315259 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 2 of 17\nParticular attention is drawn to zinc complexes of chelating azomethine ligands, owing to their photo- and electroluminescent properties, which allow their use as emitting layers in OLED devices, which have many advantages in terms of power consumption, brightness, and color compared to traditional sources [15\u201321]. These complexes have a number of advantages, having high thermal stability, volatility, and solubility; they are relatively simple for synthesis, non-toxic and cheap. In addition, varying the nature of substituents in azomethine ligands makes it possible to fine-tune the luminescent characteristics of zinc complexes based on them. For example, based on Zn(II) complexes containing salicylaldiminate ligands, blue, greenish-white, and red emitters for organic photoelectronics with good stability and efficiency have been obtained [22,23]. Of particular interest are the Zn(II) complexes of azomethine ligands of 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde [24,25] and 3- methyl-1-phenyl-4-formylpyrazol-5-one [26\u201330] derivatives. Replacing the hydroxy group in the aldehyde fragment of azomethines with a 2-tosylamino group with the formation of the MN4 coordination site leads to an increase in thermal stability (m.p. increases by about 50\u2013100 \u25e6C) [7,24,31\u201333] and solvent resistance of complexes as compared to azomethine complexes based on salicylic aldehydes. In addition, the introduction of chlorine atoms into position 5 of the 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde fragment promotes an increase in the solubility of both azomethines and complexes based on them. Zinc complexes based on azomethine ligands of 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde fluoresce in the blue region of the spectrum \u03bbPL = 428\u2013433 nm and have a high fluorescence quantum yield \u03d5 > 0.20, which makes them promising objects as an active emission layer of OLED. Previously [34\u201336], we obtained a series of zinc complexes of bidentate azomethine ligands of halogenated 2-hydroxybenzaldehydes derivatives, and studied their structure, spectral-luminescent properties, and biological activity. In continuation of [35,36], we synthesized a similar series of azomethine compounds of 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde or 5-chloro-2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde and the corresponding chlorine-substituted anilines, and zinc(II) complexes based on them. The main goal of this work was to study the effect of the halogen substituent in the amine and aldehyde fragments in zinc complexes on their photoluminescent properties and biological activity."

J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 2 of 18 1. Introduction For a long time, the interest of researchers in the synthesis and study of the physicochemical properties of new Schiff bases by salicylaldehyde derivatives and transition metal complexes based on them has not faded [1\u20133]. Significant progress in this area is primarily due to the practical importance of these compounds. In particular, these compounds demonstrate a wide range of biological activity [4,5] exhibiting antifungal [6,7], antibacterial [6\u20138], anticancer [9\u201313], and antiviral [14] properties, which determines their demand by medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture.\nParticular attention is drawn to zinc complexes of chelating azomethine ligands, owing to their photo- and electroluminescent properties, which allow their use as emitting layers in OLED devices, which have many advantages in terms of power consumption, brightness, and color compared to traditional sources [15\u201321]. These complexes have a number of advantages, having high thermal stability, volatility, and solubility; they are relatively simple for synthesis, non-toxic and cheap. In addition, varying the nature of substituents in azomethine ligands makes it possible to fine-tune the luminescent characteristics of zinc complexes based on them. For example, based on Zn(II) complexes containing salicylaldiminate ligands, blue, greenish-white, and red emitters for organic photoelectronics with good stability and efficiency have been obtained [22,23]. Of particular int rest are the Zn(II) complexes of azomethine ligands of 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde [24,25] and 3-methyl-1-phenyl-4-formylpyrazol-5-one [26\u201330] derivatives. Replacing the hydroxy group in the aldehyde fragment of azomethines with a 2-tosylamino group with the formation of the MN4 coordination site leads to n increa e in hermal stability (m.p. increases by about 50\u2013100 \u00b0C) [7,24,31\u201333] and solvent resistance of complexes as compared to azomethine complexes based on salicylic aldehydes. In addition, the introduction of chl rine a oms into position 5 of the 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde fragment promotes an increase in the solubility of both azomethines and complexes based on them. Zinc complexes based on azomethine ligands of 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde fluoresce in the blue region of the sp ctrum \u03bbPL = 428\u2013433 nm and have a high fluorescence quantum yield \u03c6 > 0.20, which makes them promising objects as an active emission layer of OLED.\nPreviously [34\u201336], we obtained a series of zinc complexes of bidentate azomethine ligands of halogenated 2-hydroxybenzaldehydes derivative , n studied their structure, spectral-luminescent properties, and biological activity.

J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 8 of 17\nThe excellent thermal properties of 2a\u2013d inspired us to fabricate efficient OLEDs by vacuum thermal evaporation technique. Further, we used cyclic voltammetry to investigate the electrochemical properties and determine the energy levels of title complexes. The electrochemical behavior was studied in dry acetonitrile (0.01 M solutions) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in a three-electrode cell system. The detailed electrochemical properties of the Zn(II) complexes are listed in Table 3. During the anodic scan, a monoelectronic and irreversible anodic wave with a peak maximum at 1.04\u20131.11 V corresponding to the oxidation of the Schiff base moieties is observed in the CV profiles. From the electrochemical and spectral data, the energies of the LUMO and HOMO levels of 2a\u2013d were estimated as listed in Table 3. According to the oxidation onset-potential values, the highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels EHOMO were estimated to be \u22125.21\u20135.33 eV. The relative lower EHOMO of 2a and 2c originated from the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of chlorineatom in meta-position. Estimation of the LUMO energy values was carried out by the addition of an energy gap calculated from spectral data. LUMO levels are located in the range of \u22122.59 to \u22122.79 eV."

LiF is used both to lower the energy barrier between the LUMO level of the Zn complex and the electron emission work from aluminum and to prevent Al aluminum atoms from entering the emitting layer when forming the cathode. Aluminum served as the cathode All devices exhibited the typical diode characteristics. The light turn-on voltage for all devices was in the range of 4.5\u20137 V. All devices emitted a greenish-blue or green light (Figure 6a). Figure 6b shows the normalized EL spectra of title devices. In accordance with their PL spectra, a wide EL color range spanning from bluish-green (494 nm for 2a) to green (533 nm for 2d) was obtained for these devices. The EL spectra of these devices are almost invariant of the applied voltages, and it is clear that the EL spectra of the 2a\u2013b complex matched well with their PL in terms of spectral profile and position, confirming that no emission signal from electroplex or excimer/exciplex has appeared in these devices under electroexcitation. From the EL spectra, it was concluded that the peak position of the emitted light is independent of the applied voltage. Complexes 2a and 2c, which contain only one Cl-atom in the aldehyde fragment of the ligand, show better performance than complexes 2b and 2d which have two Cl substituents. For example, the luminescence intensity of device A-D increases with increasing voltage reaching a brightness of more than 1545 Cd/m2 at 18 V in the case of device A and 1007 Cd/m2 at 17 V in the case of device C, while the brightness of the other devices was below 1000 Cd/m2 at 18 V.

Although the luminance and efficiency values of the resulting devices do not reach the maximum values for close structures [29\u201331], these preliminary results suggest that the title complexes have the potential for use as emissive layers in organic light-emitting diodes. However, the device architecture needs to be improved, by using perhaps a different host matrix, with better electron-transporting properties.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 9 of 17\nInt. J. Mol.

Azomethines 1b, 1d, and 1e show antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but their activity is 2.2 times weaker than that of the reference drug furazolidone in the case of azomethines 1b,d containing two chlorine atoms in the amine moiety, and 1.3 times weaker in the case of azomethine 1e containing no chlorine atoms. Only azomethines 1a and 1e are active against Escherichia coli. The activity of azomethine 1a, containing a chlorine atom in the amine part, is 2.3 times, and the activity of 1e is 1.2 times weaker than that of furazolidone. In the case of complexes, the complexes 2a, 2c, 2d, and 2e show bacteriostatic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but the activity of complexes 2a, 2c, 2d, containing from one to three chlorine atoms in the ligand, is 2.2\u20132.5 times and the activity of complex 2e, which does not contain chlorine atoms in the ligand, is 1.3 times weaker than that of furazolidone. With respect to Escherichia coli,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 10 of 17\ncomplexes 2c and 2d show activity 1.5\u20131.8 times, and complex 2e is 1.3 times weaker than that furazolidone.\nIt was found that compound 1e, containing no chlorine atoms, has high protistocidal activity among azomethines (Table 5). Its activity is 4 times higher than the activity of the reference drug toltrazuril, whereas azomethines 1a\u2013d containing chlorine atoms at different positions of azomethine, show weak protistocidal activity, which is 4\u20138 times weaker than the activity of the reference drug toltrazuril. Among the complexes 2a\u2013e, the most active against Colpodasteinii is the complex 2c, containing one chlorine atom in each of the aldehyde and amine parts of the ligand, whose activity is 2 times stronger than that of toltrazuril. The activity of complex 2e is 8 times weaker than that of toltrazuril. Complexes 2a,b,d did not show protistocidal activity. When comparing the antibacterial activity of azomethines 1a\u2013e and their complexes 2a\u2013e, it was shown that complexes 2a,c, containing one or two chlorine atoms in the ligand, showed activity against Staphylococcus aureus 2.2\u20132.5 times weaker than the reference drug, in contrast to the corresponding azomethines, which did not have such activity at all. Complex 2d, containing two chlorine atoms in the amine part of the ligand, showed no activity compared to azomethine 1d, which has antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of complexes 2d,e, and the corresponding azomethines 1d,e was found to be the same. With respect to Escherichia coli, complexes 2c,d containing two or three chlorine atoms in the ligand showed activity 1.5\u20131.8 times weaker than the reference drug, in contrast to the corresponding azomethines, which did not possess such activity at all. Complex 2a showed no activity compared to azomethine 1a, which has antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The activities of complex 2e and the corresponding azomethine 1e were found to be the same. Complex 2b and azomethine 1b did not have the corresponding activity. When comparing the protistocidal activity of azomethines 1a\u2013e with their complexes 2a\u2013e, it was found that the protistocidal activity of the complexes decreases compared to azomethines, with the exception of complex 2c, which contains one chlorine atom in each of the aldehyde and amine parts of the ligand. Complex 2c showed activity 16 times greater than the activity of the corresponding azomethine 1c and 2 times greater than the activity of the reference drug toltrazuril. It should be noted that complexes 2a,b, having one or two chlorine atoms in the amine part of the ligand, did not show protistocidal activity, whereas antibacterial activity among these complexes was observed only in monochlorine-substituted 2a against Staphylococcus aureus, which was 2.5 times weaker than that of the reference drug. The introduction of a chlorine atom into the aldehyde part of the ligand of the complex with the retention of halogens in the amine part led to an increase in the biological activity of complexes 2c,d, in\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 11 of 17\nparticular, the zinc complex 2c containing one chlorine atom in the aldehyde part and one chlorine atom in the amine part of the ligand, showed protistocidal activity 2 times higher than that of toltrazuril. The replacement of a 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde fragment containing one or two chlorine atoms in azomethines with 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde or its 5-chloro derivative has no particular effect on the change in biological activity. This conclusion is consistent with previously published data for related azomethine compounds [38,39], where it was shown that the substitution of chlorine atoms in the aldehyde fragment of the 2-hydroxybenzaaldimine ligand of zinc complexes has a poor effect on their antimicrobial properties against Grampositive (Staphylococcus aureus), and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) organisms compared to the unsubstituted ligand, and less antimicrobial activity of known antibiotics (eg Gentamycin or Amoxicillin). The protistocidal activity of the zinc complex with azomethine of 5-chloro-2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde with 4-chloroaniline was 2 times higher than the activity of toltrazuril, while the complex of zinc azomethine of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde with 4-chloroaniline aniline did not exhibit this activity [35]."

The C, H, and N elemental analysis were carried out on a \u00abEuroEA-3000\u00bb (EuroVektor) analyzer. The amount of the metal was determined by the gravimetric method. The melting temperature of the synthesized compounds was determined by the capillary method, and for complexes, 2a\u20132d it was refined by DSC data. The IR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Varian 3100-FTIR Excalibur instrument in the range 4000\u2013400 cm\u20131 by the method of disturbed total internal reflection. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity-300 instrument (300 MHz) in DMSO-d6. The chemical shifts of the 1H nuclei are given relative to the residual signals of the deuterated solvent. UV-Vis spectra were recorded for a 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 M solution with Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescent spectra were recorded for a 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 M solution on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. All spectra were recorded in dichloromethane (for spectroscopy, Acros Organics) solutions at room temperature. Fluorescence quantum yield determined relative to 3-methoxybenzanthrone in toluene as standard (\u03d5 = 0.1, excitation at 365 nm) [40]. Photoluminescent spectra in the solid state were recorded with Hamamatsu C11347-01 absolute PL quantum yield spectrometer. Absolute PL quantum yield was determined using an integrating sphere of the Hamamatsu C11347-01 spectrometer (excitation at 390 nm). TG and DSC experiments were performed on a STA6000 (PerkinElmer, Inc., Shelton, CT, USA) under a static nitrogen atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry measurements for complexes 2a\u2013d were performed following the protocol described in ref [41]. The OLED devices were fabricated on glass substrates with 100 nm thickness ITO. Organic layers were sequentially deposited at a rate in the range of 0.1\u20130.3 nm/s onto the substrates by high-vacuum (10\u22125 mbar) thermal evaporation techniques. The shadow mask with 5 mm \u00d7 5 mm openings was used to define the cathodes. The evaporating speeds and thickness were monitored by quartz oscillators. All of the measurements were carried out in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature after a vacuum break. The current density\u2013luminance\u2013voltage characteristics of the OLEDs were measured by the Keithley source measurement unit with a calibrated silicon photodiode. Electroluminescence spectra were taken by a multichannel S2000 Ocean Optics spectrometer. All measurements were carried out in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The X-ray Zn K absorption edges of zinc complexes were obtained in the transmission mode at the Structural Materials Science station at the Kurchatov Synchrotron Center (Moscow) [42]. The energy of the electron beam, which was used as a source of X-ray synchrotron radiation, was 2.5 GeV at an average current of 100\u2013120 mA. The X-ray absorption spectra were processed by standard procedures for extracting the background,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 12 of 17\nnormalizing to the value of the K-edge jump, and extracting the atomic absorption \u00b50, after which the Fourier transform of the selected EXAFS (\u03c7) spectrum was performed in the range of photoelectron wave vectors k from 2.5 to 12\u201313 \u00c5\u20131 with the weight function k3. The exact values of the nearest environment parameters of the zinc ion in the studied compounds were determined by nonlinear fitting of the parameters of the corresponding coordination spheres when comparing the calculated EXAFS with that extracted by the Fourier filtering method from the full absorption spectrum. This procedure was carried out using the IFFEFIT software package [43]. The phases and amplitudes of photoelectron wave scattering required for constructing the model spectrum were calculated using the FEFF7 program [44]. As the initial atomic coordinates necessary for calculating the scattering phases and amplitudes and further fitting, we used X-ray diffraction data for single crystals of metal complexes with a similar molecular structure from the Cambridge database. The fit quality function Q, which was minimized when finding the structure parameters of the nearest environment, was calculated using the formula:\nQ2 =\nm \u2211\ni=1 w(ki)\n[ ki\u03c7exp(ki)\u2212 ki\u03c7th(ki) ]2 m \u2211\ni=1 w(ki)\n[ ki\u03c7exp(ki) ]2 where w(ki) is a weighting function, m is the number of experimental points, \u03c7data(Ri) and \u03c7th(Ri) are the EXAFS functions in the R-space. The X-ray diffraction study of the crystals 2a and 2d was carried out at the \u201cBelok/XSA\u201d beamline of the Kurchatov Synchrotron Radiation Source [45,46]. Diffraction patterns were collected in direct geometry (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6) for 2a and in a combination of direct and turned geometry (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 for the first data set and \u03b8 = 26\u25e6 for the second data set) using a 1-axis MarDTB goniometer (\u03d5-scanning mode with oscillation angle 1\u25e6) equipped with Rayonix SX165 CCD 2D positional sensitive CCD detector (\u03bb = 0.745 \u00c5). For the crystal of complex 2a, data were obtained from two data sets, collected with different matrices of the orientation of the crystals, and for the crystal of complex 2d, as described above. For each data set, ~180 diffraction frames were collected. All data were collected at 100 K. The data were indexed and integrated by the XDS and XSCALE software suites [47]. The structures were solved by direct methods (intrinsic phasing) with SHELXT [48]. The structure model was investigated by Olex2 software [49] and refined by SHELXL [50] by a full-matrix least-squares method on F2 with anisotropic displacements. As a result of combining two sets of data obtained in different geometries for the crystal of the complex 2d, the obtained data are characterized by a larger maximum angle of 2\u03b8 and, as a result, better resolution and greater accuracy of the structural model, which leads to lower anisotropic displacement parameters. The crystallographic parameters and the refinement statistics for 2a and 2d are given in Tables S1\u2013S9 (Supplementary Materials). Crystallographic data for 2a and 2d have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC 2203056 (2a), and CCDC 2203057 (2d). The supplementary crystallographic data can be obtained free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif (accessed on 7 October 2022.)."

            "text": "A number of azomethine compounds of 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde and 5-chloro2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde with chlorine-substituted anilines and their zinc(II) complexes were synthesized, the structure of which was determined by elemental analysis, IR, 1H NMR. According to the X-ray absorption spectroscopy data from EXAFS analysis of Zn K-edges, it was found that all complexes have a tetrahedral structure with similar values of Zn . . . O/N distances. The PL properties of azomethines and zinc complexes in methylene chloride solution and in solid form have been studied. It is shown that Ihe introduction of a second chlorine atom into the aniline fragment of the ligand of zinc complexes leads to a slight bathochromic shift of both the UV-Vis absorption maximum and the PL maximum (by 0\u20133 nm). However, the introduction of a chlorine atom into the aldehyde fragment of the ligand of zinc complexes significantly shifts both the position of the absorption maximum of the UV-Vis spectrum and the maximum of PL by 12\u201315 nm to the red region. Quantum yields of PL of zinc complexes in the solid-state increase 4\u201312 times compared to the values in CH2Cl2 solutions. Based on thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, it was found that all complexes have high thermal stability (290\u2013340 \u25e6C). The results of cyclic voltammetry made it possible to determine the energy levels of the complexes. The energy HOMO was \u22125.21\u20135.33 eV, with the lower values \u22125.21\u20135.33 eV (for 2a and 2c) arising from the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the meta-position chlorine atom. TO/PEDOT:PSS/NPD/2a\u2013d/ TPBI/LiF/AThe LUMO levels are in the range of \u22122.59 to \u22122.79 eV. The multilayered devices Il were fabricated in which 2a\u2013d acted as the emitters. The light turn-on voltage for all devices was in the range of 4.5\u20137 V. All devices emitted a greenish-blue (494 nm for 2a) or green light (533 nm for 2d). Complexes 2a and 2c with one Cl-atom in the aldehyde fragment of the ligand showed better performance than complexes 2b and 2d with two Cl substituents. The devices with 2a emitter show the highest in this series maximum current and power efficiency of 2.7 cd/A, 1.7 lm/W.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15259 15 of 17\nThe biological activity of azomethines and zinc complexes has been studied. Azomethins 1a, 1b, and 1d had the highest antibacterial activity, but their activity was 2 times weaker than that of the reference drug furazolidone. In the case of complexes, the protistocidal activity of the complex of zinc with azomethine of 5-chloro-2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde with 4-chloroaniline 2c was two times higher than the activity of toltrazuril. The obtained results of the study of biological activity allow us to conclude that the search for antiprotozoal drugs among azomethines of halogen-substituted 2-(N-tosylamino)benzaldehyde with halogen-containing anilines and metal complexes based on them is promising.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms232315259/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.S.B. and Y.V.K.; investigation, V.G.V., M.S.M., N.I.M., A.A.Z., D.A.G. and A.N.G.; data curation, V.A.L. and A.L.T.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.S.B. and V.G.V.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.A.K. and W.L.; visualization, V.G.V.; project administration, A.V.M.
