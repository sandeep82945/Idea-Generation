    "abstractText": "The Klein-Gordon equation, one of the most fundamental equations in field theory, is known to be not invariant under conformal transformation. However, its massless limit exhibits symmetry under Bekenstein\u2019s disformal transformation, subject to some conditions on the disformal part of the metric variation. In this study, we explore the symmetry of the Klein-Gordon equation under the general disformal transformation encompassing that of Bekenstein and a hierarchy of \u2018subgeneralisations\u2019 explored in the literature (within the context of inflationary cosmology and scalar-tensor theories). We find that the symmetry in the massless limit can be extended under this generalisation provided that the disformal factors takes a special form in relation to the conformal factor. Upon settling the effective extension of symmetry, we investigate the invertibility of the general disformal transformation to avoid propagating non-physical degrees of freedom upon changing the metric. We derive the inverse transformation and the accompanying restrictions that make this inverse possible.",

            "text": "Disformal transformation [1] is a metric transformation introduced by Bekenstein in 1992 as a generalisation of the more commonly known conformal transformation [2, 3]. The aim was to relate Finsler and Riemann geometries in a single gravitational theory. Since then, disformal transformation found its utility in many cutting-edge research areas in Physics beyond the original scope of Bekenstein\u2019s work. In the study of scalartensor theories, disformal transformation plays an important role in relating one action to another. This is with an insight to solve pressing problems about the Universe such as dark energy and dark matter, and investigate the physical consistency of the resulting action upon transformation; see Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In the area of\n\u2020corresponding author\ninflationary cosmology, disformal transformation is used in the study of G-inflation and beyond [11, 12], Higgs inflation [13], and disformal inflation [14], to name a few. The investigation of disformal transformation also extends to hairy black holes [15], D-brane cosmology [16], particle motion in semi-classical gravity [17], etc.\nAs in any other areas of physics involving the study of transformation, symmetry\nis an \u2018omnipresent\u2019 idea that has to be taken into account. Of particular interest are transformations that lend physical observables and equations of motion describing physical systems, invariant. For disformal transformation, it is found that both the gauge-invariant scalar and tensor primordial cosmological perturbations [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]\u2014the seeds that gave rise to the current universe\u2014are invariant under a hierarchy of this transformation [23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Furthermore, the \u2018trinity\u2019 of relativistic field equations, namely, Klein-Gordon equation [28], Maxwell\u2019s equations [29], and Dirac equation (under the Inomata condition) [30] are symmetric with respect to disformal transformation, subject to some constraints on the conformal and disformal factors in the variation.\nThe focus of this work is the disformal transformation of the Klein-Gordon equation.\nFalciano and Goulart [28] showed that subject to some conditions, the massless KleinGordon equation is invariant under the disformal transformation of the metric g\u00b5\u03bd that we rewrite as\u2021\ng\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = A(\u03c6,X)g\u00b5\u03bd +B(\u03c6,X)\u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd , (1)\nwhere A and B are the conformal and disformal factors, respectively. They depend on the scalar field \u03c6 and the kinetic term X defined as X \u2261 \u22121 2 g\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd . Subject to the condition given by\u00a7\nB = A\u2212 c2An\u22121\n2X , (c = const.) (2)\nwhere n is the dimension of the background spacetime, the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field with massm, transforms\u00b6 as \u03c6\u2212m2\u03c6 = 0 \u2192 ( \u03c6)/(c2An\u22121)\u2212m2\u03c6 = 0. Consequently, it is invariant under the disformal transformation in the massless limit. For the massive case, the mass may be seen as transforming from m2 \u2192 m2/(c2An\u22121). The transformation given by (1) is not the only form of disformal transformation. It can be generalised to a form involving higher-order derivatives of \u03c6 and/or derivatives of the kinetic term. It is then interesting to see if the Klein-Gordon equation would remain invariant under such generalised transformation, and identify the needed conditions, if any, for the preservation of symmetry. In this work, we consider a general disformal\n\u2021Ref. [28] started out with what we identify as the disformal transformation of the inverse metric. Here, we follow a slightly different notation; i.e., AFG = 1/A and BFG = \u2212B/[A(A \u2212 2BX)], where the subscript \u2018FG\u2019 pertains to Ref. [28].\n\u00a7The constant c is a minor correction in the result in Ref. [28] where c2 is simply unity. \u00b6We are using the metric signature (\u2212,+,+,+).\ntransformation given by\u2016 [23, 31]\ng\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd + \u03a6\u00b5\u03a6\u03bd , where \u03a6\u00b5 \u2261 C\u03c6;\u00b5 +DX;\u00b5, (3)\nwith A,C, and D being functionals of (\u03c6,X, Y, Z), in general, and the quantities Y and Z are defined as Y \u2261 g\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u00b5X;\u03bd and Z \u2261 g\u00b5\u03bdX;\u00b5X;\u03bd. Note that this transformation involves a derivative of the kinetic term in addition to that of the scalar field; effectively, the second-order derivative of \u03c6 is encoded in X;\u00b5. It reduces to the special case of Bekenstein given by (1) when D = 0 and the dependencies on (Y, Z) are removed; in this case, we can identify C2(\u03c6,X) = B(\u03c6,X) in (1).\nThe form of the disformal transformation given by (3) is a generalisation of the\nhierarchy of transformations investigated in Ref. [24, 25, 26, 27] within the context of inflationary cosmology (see Refs. [32, 33] for other forms covering dual scalars and vector disformal transformation.) Moreover, it is inspired by Refs. [23] and [31]. In Ref. [23], it is shown that both the scalar and tensor primordial cosmological cosmological perturbations are invariant under (3) in the superhorizon limit [18, 19]. On the other hand, it is explored in Ref. [31] within the scope of invertibility and physical degrees of freedom in scalar-tensor theories.\nThe first study finds its relevance in connecting general actions through disformal\ntransformation and showing the physical quantities that are symmetric. This is much like moving to and from the Einstein and Jordan frames in conformal transformation while retaining the character of primordial cosmological perturbations. The second study complements the first one in view of the fact that metric transformation may lead to Ostrogradsky instability [34, 35] and propagating non-physical degrees of freedom [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] in scalar-tensor actions in which the Klein-Gordon action belongs; invertibility ensures that the number of propagating physical degrees of freedom remain the same under a metric transformation. Having been explored in Refs. [23] and [31] the \u2018umbrella\u2019 disformal transformation encompassing that of Bekenstein and those of other works [24, 25, 26, 27], it is time that we revisit one of the most, if not the most fundamental equation in field theory, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation, under the general disformal transformation.\nTo be clear, our aim in this study is two-fold. The first one is to determine the\nform of the disformal factors C and D such that the massless Klein-Gordon equation is invariant under the general disformal transformation given by (3); this is in the same spirit as in Ref. [29]. The second one is to demonstrate the invertibility of the general disformal transformation subject to the result of the first one and other auxiliary conditions. In particular, we wish to write g\u00b5\u03bd in terms of disformally transformed quantities to the extent permitted by the form of the conformal and disformal factors in the transformation.\n\u2016As in Bekenstein\u2019s disformal transformation given by (1), this generalisation does not necessarily preserve the metric signature. Interested readers may refer to Ref. [6] and references therein for the discussion on restrictions involving Lorentzian signature and causality.\nTo meet these ends, this paper is organised as follows. In Sec. 2, we derive the\ngeneral disformal transformation of the d\u2019Alembertian of the scalar field, \u03c6, following a pathway to symmetry of the Klein-Gordon equation. Along the way, we determine the conditions on the functionals C and D,in relation to the conformal factor A, that render the massless Klein-Gordon equation invariant. In addition to this, we also look at the transformation of the mass in the massive case. In Sec. 3, we provide an alternative way to derive the conditions in the previous section for the symmetry; this serves to confirm our results. In Sec. 4, we comment on and derive the inverse general disformal transformation covered in this work. Lastly, we state our concluding remarks and future prospects in Sec. 5."

            "text": "Klein-Gordon Equation\nIn this section, we wish to derive the disformal transformation (3) of the d\u2019Alembertian of the scalar field contained in the Klein Gordon equation. The original background ndimensional spacetime is described by the metric, g\u00b5\u03bd , with signature (\u2212,+,+,+). We assume, as in Ref. [6], that the transformation leading to g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd , preserves the Lorentzian signature and causality structure of spacetime. Cases where the disformal and conformal factors lead to flipping of Lorentzian signature and acausal behaviour are left for future studies.\nIn so finding the general disformal transformation of the Klein-Gordon equation, our\npathway is bent in search of symmetry for the massless case. In other words, we do not simply derive the full transformation of the equation under (3) but take opportunities along the way whenever they present themselves as conditions that we may impose to have an invariant Klein-Gordon equation.\nThe d\u2019Alembertian of the scalar field, \u03c6, changes under the disformal\ntransformation to \u0302\u03c6 = g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd\u2207\u0302\u00b5\u2207\u0302\u03bd\u03c6, where g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd is the inverse of the disformal metric given by (3) above. The hatted covariant derivative operators (as in all other hatted quantities in this work) are disformally transformed quantities. From the ShermanMorrison formula for matrix inversion, we find\ng\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd A \u2212 \u03a6 \u00b5\u03a6\u03bd A(A\u2212 2\u03c7) , where \u03c7 \u2261 \u2212 1 2 g\u00b5\u03bd\u03a6\u00b5\u03a6\u03bd . (4)\nIt is straightforward to show that g\u0302\u00b5\u03b1g\u0302\u03b1\u03bd = \u03b4 \u00b5 \u03bd , verifying the validity of the expression for the inverse disformal metric above. For the covariant derivatives of the scalar field, we have \u2207\u0302\u00b5\u2207\u0302\u03bd\u03c6 = \u03c6;\u03bd,\u00b5 \u2212 \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u03b1, where the symbols comma \u2018,\u2019 and semicolon \u2018;\u2019 mean partial differentiation and covariant differentiation, respectively\u2217\u2217. The hatted Christoffel symbol on the right hand side can be expressed in terms of the disformal metric, derivative thereof, and its inverse, as \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = 1 2 g\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u0302\u03b2\u00b5,\u03bd + g\u0302\u03bd\u03b2,\u00b5 \u2212 g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd,\u03b2). Using the equations for the disformal metric and\n\u2217\u2217Needless to say, for the scalar field, \u03c6;\u03b1 = \u03c6,\u03b1, but \u03c6;\u03b1\u03b2 6= \u03c6,\u03b1\u03b2 .\nits inverse given by (3) and (4), respectively, the hatted Christoffel symbol can be decomposed as a sum of the original Christoffel symbol and a tensor term. In particular,\n\u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = \u0393 \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd + C \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd , (5)\nwhere C\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd , the contribution due to the disformal part of the transformation, is given by\nC\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = A;\u03bd\u03b4 \u03b1 \u00b5 + A;\u00b5\u03b4 \u03b1 \u03bd \u2212A;\u03b1g\u00b5\u03bd 2A \u2212 \u03a6 \u03b1(A;\u03bd\u03a6\u00b5 + A;\u00b5\u03a6\u03bd \u2212A;\u03b2\u03a6\u03b2g\u00b5\u03bd) 2A(A\u2212 2\u03c7)\n+\n[ g\u03b1\u03b2\nA \u2212 \u03a6\n\u03b1\u03a6\u03b2\nA(A\u2212 2\u03c7)\n] (\u03a6\u00b5\u03a6[\u03b2;\u03bd] + \u03a6\u03bd\u03a6[\u03b2;\u00b5]) +\n\u03a6\u03b1\u03a6(\u00b5;\u03bd) A\u2212 2\u03c7 . (6)\nHere, \u03a6[\u00b5;\u03bd] \u2261 12(\u03a6\u00b5;\u03bd \u2212\u03a6\u03bd;\u00b5) and \u03a6(\u00b5;\u03bd) \u2261 12(\u03a6\u00b5;\u03bd +\u03a6\u03bd;\u00b5). Observe that C\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd is symmetric with respect to the lower indices. It follows that \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd retains the symmetry of the original \u0393\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd . In the limit where C = D = 0, it reduces to that of the familiar conformal transformation [2]; i.e., \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = C\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 (A;\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u00b5 + A;\u00b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd \u2212 A;\u03b1g\u00b5\u03bd)/2A. All the needed expressions are now in place to solve for \u0302\u03c6. We have upon using (5) for the hatted Christoffel symbol in the expression for the d\u2019Alembertian,\n\u0302\u03c6 = \u03c6\nA \u2212\ng\u00b5\u03bdC\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u03b1\nA \u2212 \u03a6 \u00b5\u03a6\u03bd\u03c6;\u00b5\u03bd A(A\u2212 2\u03c7) + \u03a6\u00b5\u03a6\u03bdC\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u03b1 A(A\u2212 2\u03c7) . (7)\nWe see that the transformed d\u2019Alembertian of \u03c6 is a sum of the original d\u2019Alembertian of \u03c6, scaled by the conformal factor, A, and terms due to the disformal part of the transformation. While these terms are straightforward to compute using the equation for C\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd given above, the result is quite long and the calculation is laborious. With an eye for symmetry, as alluded above, we opt to cancel terms early on by imposing \u2018symmetry\u2019 condition(s) on the disformal factors C and D, leading to the invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation.\nThis cancellation starts with the second term on the right hand side of the equation\nabove for \u0302\u03c6. It can be expressed as\ng\u00b5\u03bdC\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u03b1 = (2\u2212 n)\u03c6;\u03b1A;\u03b1 2A \u2212 (2\u2212 n)\u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6 \u03b1 A;\u03b2\u03a6 \u03b2 2A(A\u2212 2\u03c7) + 2\u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6\u03b2\u03a6[\u03b1;\u03b2] A + \u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6 \u03b1\u03a6\u03b2 ;\u03b2 A\u2212 2\u03c7 .\nObserve that of all the terms in the equation for \u0302\u03c6 above, only this term generates\nX . Furthermore, only the term involving \u03a6\u03b2 ;\u03b2 on the right hand side of the equation\nabove for \u03c6;\u03b1g \u00b5\u03bdC\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd generates X ; to wit, \u03a6 \u03b2 ;\u03b2 = C;\u03b2\u03c6 ;\u03b2 + C \u03c6 +D;\u03b2X ;\u03b2 +D X . If \u0302\u03c6 is then to be proportional to \u03c6, leading to the equality between the two in the massless limit, the term involving \u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6 \u03b1\u03a6\u03b2 ;\u03b2 above should vanish. For this to happen, we may impose the \u201corthogonality\u201d condition\u2020\u2020 between \u03a6\u03b1 and \u03c6;\u03b1; that is,\n\u03a6\u03b1\u03c6;\u03b1 = 0. (8)\n\u2020\u2020With \u03a6\u03b1 = C\u03c6;\u03b1 +DX ;\u03b1, they are not orthogonal in the usual sense of the word orthogonal in Linear Algebra and Hilbert spaces; hence, the quotation marks.\nAs a consequence of this condition, we have the functional relation given by DY = 2CX . At this point, this relation can be satisfied by infinitely many combinations of D(\u03c6,X, Y, Z) and C(\u03c6,X, Y, Z); e.g., C = Y and D = 2X . However, as we shall see below, C and D should take special forms in relation to A and (X, Y, Z) for the symmetry of the massless Klein-Gordon equation.\nContinuing, we find that given the \u201corthogonality\u201d condition, the substitution of\nthe equation for C\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd given by (6) in the equation for \u0302\u03c6 given by (7) leads us to a much simpler expression for the latter.\n\u0302\u03c6 = \u03c6\nA + [n(A\u2212 2\u03c7)\u2212 2A+ 6\u03c7]\u03c6;\u03b1A;\u03b1 2A2(A\u2212 2\u03c7) \u2212 \u03a6\u03b1\u03c6;\u03b1\u03b2\u03a6 \u03b2 + 2\u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6\u03b2\u03a6[\u03b1;\u03b2] A(A\u2212 2\u03c7) . (9)\nNeedless to say, if the conformal factor is unity and C = D = 0, then \u0302\u03c6 = \u03c6. On the other hand, when the transformation is purely conformal, we find both \u03c7 and \u03a6\u00b5 vanish, and gain the expected result given by\u2021\u2021\n\u0302\u03c6 = \u03c6\nA + (n\u2212 2)\u03c6;\u03b1A;\u03b1 2A2 . (10)\nInterestingly, the Klein-Gordon equation is not symmetric with respect to conformal transformation unless the dimension of the embedding manifold is n = 2. Being able to push it to symmetry [28] elevates the value of Bekenstein\u2019s disformal transformation. In this work, we push the symmetry further under the general disformal transformation (3) and uncover the conditions for this symmetry.\nBeyond the conformal limit, the factors C and D are not necessarily vanishing but\nare bound by the \u201corthogonality\u201d condition given by (8). As a consequence, for the numerator of the last term on the right hand side of (9), we have\n\u03a6\u00b5\u03c6;\u00b5\u03bd\u03a6 \u03bd + 2\u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6\u03b2\u03a6[\u03b1;\u03b2] = \u2212\nB Y (Y 2 + 4XZ)\u2212 X Y 2 (Y 2 + 2XZ)\u03c6;\u03b1B;\u03b1\n\u2212 2BX 2\u03c6;\u03b1Z;\u03b1 Y 2 + 4BX2Z\u03c6;\u03b1Y;\u03b1 Y 3 , (11)\nwhere we identify C2 = B from the correspondence of the usual disformal transformation (1) and the general disformal transformation (3).\nIf \u0302\u03c6 is to be proportional to \u03c6 in (9), then the two terms following the first\nterm involving \u03c6 on the right hand side should vanish. For this to happen, B may be related to A. In an attempt to find this relationship, we take the ansatz B = q(X, Y, Z)h(X)f(A), where the functionals q, h, and f are to be determined. Note that in this ansatz, the dependence on \u03c6 is encoded in A alone while X is distributed amongst q, h, and A, with q (and A) being also dependent on (Y, Z). Using this ansatz and (8) we find\nq = Y 2\nY 2 + 2XZ , h =\n1\nX , and f = \u2212\u03c7. (12)\n\u2021\u2021We cannot set D = 0 independent of C as a consistency check because the condition \u03c6;\u03b1\u03a6;\u03b1 = 0 imposes D \u221d C. Setting D = 0 also means C = 0 or B = 0 (since C2 = B).\nWe conclude that under the disformal transformation given by g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd +\u03a6\u00b5\u03a6\u03bd ,\nthe Klein-Gordon equation for scalar field \u03c6 transforms as\n\u03c6\u2212m2\u03c6 = 0 \u2192 \u03c6 A \u2212m2\u03c6 = 0, (13)\nprovided that the disformal factors C and D are related to the conformal factor and (X, Y, Z) as\nC2 = Y 2(bA3\u2212n \u2212 A) 2X(Y 2 + 2XZ) and D2 = 2X(bA3\u2212n \u2212 A) Y 2 + 2XZ . (14)\nIn the massless limit, the Klein-Gordon equation is invariant under the transformation. On the other hand, for the massive case, the mass may be seen as transforming by conformal rescaling (i.e., m2 \u2192 m2/A) from the manifold described by g\u00b5\u03bd to the manifold described by g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd .\nIt is worth noting that our result here for the massive field is a little different\nfrom that of the usual disformal transformation, g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd + B\u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd , wherein\n\u03c6 \u2212 m2\u03c6 = 0 \u2192 ( \u03c6)/(c2An\u22121) \u2212 m2\u03c6 = 0, leading to m2 \u2192 m2/(c2An\u22121) [28]. The dependence on the dimension n is apparent in the usual one, while for our transformation, it is not present. In fact, for the massive field, the transformation of the Klein-Gordon equation is not simply a special case of ours. The condition that relates B to A given by (2) for the usual disformal transformation is not a special case of the second of (14) due to the \u201corthogonality\u201d condition binding C and D. This leads to different mass transformations with one depending on n while the other one does not. However, the massless limit yields the same symmetry for both cases. It is in this sense that we are extending the symmetry of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under the general disformal transformation (3).\nBefore we leave this section, it is good to clarify one point leading to (14) and\nconsequently, to the invariance of the Klein-Gordon equation. Along the way of our calculation, we encountered the \u2018orthogonality\u2019 condition, namely, \u03a6\u03b1\u03c6;\u03b1 = 0. Taken at face value, this seems to imply a relation for \u03c6 in addition to the Klein-Gordon equation, making it possibly over determined. However, a better and correct way to look at the \u2018orthogonality\u2019 condition is as part of the intermediate steps leading to (14). In view of the idea that this result should not be taken as an equation for \u03c6 but the forms C and D should take in order for the equation given by \u03c6 = 0, to be invariant, the \u2018orthogonality\u2019 relation, \u03a6\u03b1\u03c6;\u03b1 = 0 \u21d4 2CX = DY , should be seen as a functional relationship between C and D and a stepping stone leading to their desired forms given by (14). Taking our derivation in this section as a whole, it may not be taken as an auxiliary equation for \u03c6."

The process of calculation is mainly for verification of the previous section\u2019s results.\nFollowing this pathway, we start from the relation involving double covariant\ndifferentiation, namely, \u03c6 = g\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6,\u03bd\u00b5 \u2212 g\u00b5\u03bd\u0393\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u03b1. Knowing, however, that the contraction of the metric and the Christoffel symbol can be written as g\u00b5\u03bd\u0393\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd =\n\u2212(g\u03b1\u03b2\u221a\u2212g),\u03b2/ \u221a\u2212g, leads us to a compact form given by\n\u03c6 = (g\u00b5\u03bd \u221a\u2212g\u03c6,\u00b5),\u03bd\u221a\u2212g . (15)\nBecause the derivative operators involved on the right hand side are not covariant derivative operators but only partial derivative operators, the disformal transformation of \u03c6 can simply be written as\n\u0302\u03c6 = (g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd \u221a \u2212g\u0302 \u03c6,\u00b5),\u03bd\u221a \u2212g\u0302 . (16)\nWith the inverse disformal metric already given by (4), we only need to find the\nhatted determinant. Given the form of the disformal metric provided by (3), we find from the matrix determinant lemma, g\u0302 = An\u22121g(A\u22122\u03c7), where \u03c7 is defined by the second of (4). Using this equation for g\u0302 and (4) for g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd , in the sub-expression g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd \u221a \u2212g\u0302 \u03c6,\u00b5 above contained in the equation for \u0302\u03c6, yields\ng\u0302\u00b5\u03bd \u221a \u2212g\u0302 \u03c6,\u00b5 = A n\u22123 2 (A\u2212 2\u03c7) 12g\u00b5\u03bd\u221a\u2212g \u03c6;\u00b5 \u2212 A n\u22123 2 \u221a\u2212g (A\u2212 2\u03c7) 12 \u03c6;\u00b5\u03a6\u00b5\u03a6 \u03bd . (17)\nLooking at (16), we see that \u0302\u03c6 may be made proportional to \u03c6 if the second term on the right hand side of (17) vanishes. As before, this leads to the \u201corthogonality\u201d condition given by \u03c6;\u00b5\u03a6\u00b5 = 0.\nWhile this condition is a significant stepping stone leading to the desired final form\nof C and D, it is not sufficient for the proportionality between \u0302\u03c6 and \u03c6; the disformal factor B should be related to A. We have upon performing the second differentiation and dividing the result by \u221a \u2212g\u0302 to form \u0302\u03c6, gain\n\u0302\u03c6 = \u03c6\nA +\n[A n\u22123 2 (A\u2212 2\u03c7) 12 ],\u03bdg\u00b5\u03bd \u221a\u2212g \u03c6;\u00b5\nA n\u22121 2 (A\u2212 2\u03c7) 12\u221a\u2212g . (18)\nThe second term vanishes for A n\u22123 2 (A \u2212 2\u03c7) 12 = c\u0304, where c\u0304 is some constant. This condition allows us to find the relationship between B and A. Indeed, noting our \u201corthogonality\u201d condition for \u03c6;\u00b5 and \u03a6\u00b5, we get \u03c7 = \u2212BX(Y 2 + 2XZ)/Y 2. In effect,\nB = \u2212Y 2(A\u2212 c\u03042A3\u2212n)\n2X(Y 2 + 2XZ) and D2 = 2X(bA3\u2212n \u2212A) Y 2 + 2XZ\n(19)\nwhich matches the pair of equations given by (14) in the immediately preceding section with the identification c\u03042 = b.\nThe \u201corthogonality\u201d condition binds D and C2 = B in the general disformal\ntransformation given by g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd + (C\u03c6;\u00b5 + DX;\u00b5)(C\u03c6;\u03bd + DX;\u03bd). On the other hand, the condition given by (19) above binds B and A. In short, both C and D in the transformation are functionals of A leaving only the conformal factor free. Provided that these conditions hold, the massless Klein-Gordon equation exhibits symmetry under the general disformal transformation\u2014restating the same conclusion in the previous section. For the massive case, the mass may be seen as transforming\u00a7\u00a7 from m2 \u2192 m\u03022 = m2/A, in going from the manifold described by g\u00b5\u03bd to that with g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd ."

            "text": "The usual disformal transformation can be inverted in the sense that g\u00b5\u03bd can be solved using the hatted quantities. Indeed, given g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = A(\u03c6,X)g\u00b5\u03bd + B(\u03c6,X)\u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd, one finds that X\u0302 = X/(A \u2212 2BX), indicating that X can be considered as a functional of (\u03c6, X\u0302) provided\u00b6\u00b6 \u2202X\u0302/\u2202X 6= 0; more precisely [4, 6], B(A \u2212 AXX + 2BXX2) 6= 0 and A \u2212 2BX > 0. As a consequence of this, we may simply rewrite the conformal and disformal factors A and B as a functional of (\u03c6, X\u0302). In effect, the inverse disformal transformation may be written as\ng\u00b5\u03bd = g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd A(\u03c6, X\u0302) \u2212 B(\u03c6, X\u0302) A(\u03c6, X\u0302) \u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd ; (20)\nor, in the same form as the usual disformal transformation, g\u00b5\u03bd = A\u0302(\u03c6, X\u0302)g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd + B\u0302(\u03c6, X\u0302)\u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd , with the identifications given by A\u0302 = 1/A and B\u0302 = \u2212B/A. The invertibility of disformal transformation is crucial in the study of actions describing scalar-tensor theories; i.e., Horndeski theory and beyond [12, 38, 39, 40, 41]. In the simplest scenario wherein both A and B are functionals of \u03c6 alone as in Ref. [6], it effectively maps the Horndeski theory back to itself; thus, preventing the existence of higher order derivative terms (in the action or equation of motion) signaling Ostrogradsky instability [34, 35]. Generalisations beyond this lead to beyond-Horndeski terms whose corresponding equations of motion go beyond second order. Nevertheless, if the transformation is invertible, the number of propagating physical degrees of freedom generally remains the same as in the original theory [36, 37, 42].\nThe Klein-Gordon action is a \u2018small\u2019 part but an important special case of the\nmuch more complicated Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski actions. However, it is\n\u00a7\u00a7This is quite an intriguing transformation. But as to its physical justification, making a \u2018real-world\u2019 example of this process remains a part of our future studies.\n\u00b6\u00b6Given X\u0302 = X/(A\u2212 2BX), the conformal and disformal factors, A and B, respectively, must have restrictions on their functional forms in order to find the analytical equation for X in terms of X\u0302. However, even if such an analytical equation does not exist, the inverse can still mathematically exist under the conditions stated in Refs. [4, 6].\nimportant that we gain at least an insight about the invertibility of our general disformal transformation if the transformed action is to be physically sensible. To be honest, in the most general context, the transformation given by g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd + (C\u03c6;\u00b5 +DX;\u00b5)(C\u03c6;\u03bd + DX;\u03bd), with (A,C,D) all functionals of (\u03c6,X, Y, Z), is not invertible; invertibility needs to be supplemented by some requirements on functional dependencies [31]. In this section, our task is to find the invertibility conditions for this transformation subject to the forms of C andD given by (14), ensuring the invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation. Furthermore, we wish to derive the inverse general disformal transformation to the extent permitted by this pair of equations.\nAs a requirement for the invertibility of the general disformal transformation (3), we\nimpose that all the hatted terms X\u0302, Y\u0302 , and Z\u0302 be functionals of the unhatted quantities, namely, (\u03c6,X, Y, Z), alone. With this restriction, we may invert the relationship between the hatted and unhatted quantities provided that the Jacobian determinant is nonvanishing; i.e.,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202XX\u0302 \u2202Y X\u0302 \u2202ZX\u0302 \u2202X Y\u0302 \u2202Y Y\u0302 \u2202Z Y\u0302\n\u2202X Z\u0302 \u2202Y Z\u0302 \u2202ZZ\u0302\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 6= 0. (21)\nFor the case in hand, the restrictions among the functional factors in the general disformal transformation given by (14) allow us to \u2018spell out\u2019 the map (\u03c6,X, Y, Z) \u2192 (\u03c6\u0302, X\u0302, Y\u0302 , Z\u0302); to a good extent, we can also determine the inverse map (\u03c6\u0302, X\u0302, Y\u0302 , Z\u0302) \u2192 (\u03c6,X, Y, Z).\nStarting with X\u0302 we find from its definition together with the equations for g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd and\n\u03a6\u00b5\u03c6;\u00b5 = 0,\nX\u0302 = \u2212 1 2A\n( g\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 \u03a6 \u00b5\u03a6\u03bd\nA\u2212 2\u03c7\n) \u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd = X\nA . (22)\nIt is, in other words, a functional of (\u03c6,X, Y, Z) only. For Y\u0302 , we find an additional dependence on \u03c6;\u03b1Y;\u03b1 and \u03c6 ;\u03b1Z;\u03b1. Indeed,\nY\u0302 = g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd\u03c6;\u00b5X\u0302;\u03bd = Y\nA2 +\n2A\u03c6X 2\nA3 \u2212 AXXY A3 \u2212 AYX A3 \u03c6;\u03b1Y;\u03b1 \u2212 AZX A3 \u03c6;\u03b1Z;\u03b1. (23)\nIt follows that if Y\u0302 is to be dependent on (\u03c6,X, Y, Z) alone, then the partial derivatives of the conformal factor, namely, AY and AZ should both vanish leading to\nY\u0302 = Y A\u2212 AXX\nA3 +\n2A\u03c6X 2\nA3 . (24)\nFollowing the same logic for Z\u0302 we find\nZ\u0302 = (A\u2212AXX)2(Y 2 + 2XZ)(An \u2212 bA2)\n2bA7X\n+ (A\u2212AXX)2Z \u2212 2A\u03c6XY (A\u2212 AXX)\u2212 2A2\u03c6X3\nA5 . (25)\nIt is worth noting that although A = A(\u03c6,X) only, the disformal factors still depend on (\u03c6,X, Y, Z) based on (14).\nIn summary, assuming A = A(\u03c6,X), we have a \u2018ladderised\u2019 sequence of functional\ndependencies as\nX\u0302 = X\u0302(\u03c6,X), Y\u0302 = Y\u0302 (\u03c6,X, Y ), and Z\u0302 = Z\u0302(\u03c6,X, Y, Z). (26)\nUsing (22), (24), and (28) we may invert these relations as\nX = AX\u0302, Y = AY\u0302 \u2212 2A\u03c6X\u03022\nX\u0302X ,\nZ = bZ\u0302\nX\u03022XA n\u22123\n\u2212 (AY\u0302 \u2212 2A\u03c6X\u0302 2)2(1\u2212 bA2\u2212n)\n2AX\u0302X\u03022X + 2bA\u03c6X\u0302(AY\u0302 \u2212 A\u03c6X\u03022) X\u03022XA n\u22121 . (27)\nNote that the conformal factor, being unspecified, remains implicit in these equations. The existence of the full analytical set of equations for the inverse relations depends on the form of A. In the limit where A = A(\u03c6) alone, the set of relations above completely solves for (\u03c6,X, Y, Z) in terms of (\u03c6, X\u0302, Y\u0302 , Z\u0302). For general A = A(\u03c6,X), barring the divergences of the equations above, the inverse relations exist, (although possibly, not analytically,) provided (A\u2212AXX)/A2 6= 0 in accord with Ref. [4]. Having found (\u03c6,X, Y, Z) in terms of (\u03c6, X\u0302, Y\u0302 , Z\u0302), we seek to find the inverse of the general disformal transformation; the aim is to write from\ng\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd + (C\u03c6;\u00b5 +DX;\u00b5)(C\u03c6;\u03bd +DX;\u03bd),\nto g\u00b5\u03bd = A\u0302g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd + (C\u0302\u03c6;\u00b5 + D\u0302X\u0302;\u00b5)(C\u0302\u03c6;\u03bd + D\u0302X\u0302;\u03bd). (28)\nIn fulfilling this aim, we note from the first of (27) that X;\u00b5 does not depend on the derivative term X\u0302;\u00b5 alone but also includes \u03c6;\u00b5. This leads to \u03c6;\u00b5X;\u03bd producing \u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u03bd and \u03c6;\u00b5X\u0302;\u03bd; in particular, we have\nX;\u00b5 = A\u03c6\u03c6;\u00b5X\u0302\nAX\u0302X +\nX\u0302;\u00b5 X\u0302X . (29)\nAt first sight, this might appear as a complication in deriving the second of (28)\ndue to additional hatted terms \u2018generated\u2019. The fear is that we might not end up with exactly the right form matching the original disformal transformation. However, as it turns out upon using (29),\ng\u00b5\u03bd = g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd A \u2212 AC 2\n(AY\u0302 \u2212 2A\u03c6X\u03022)2 (Y\u0302 \u03c6;\u00b5 + 2X\u0302X\u0302;\u00b5)(Y\u0302 \u03c6;\u03bd + 2X\u0302X\u0302;\u03bd). (30)\nOur sought-for inverse of the general disformal transformation, subject to the conditions given by (14), takes the form consistent with that of the second of (28). Moreover, it is worth noting that with the identifications of C\u0302 and D\u0302 in (30), we find D\u0302Y\u0302 = 2C\u0302X\u0302 , reflecting the same form as the original \u201corthogonality\u201d condition."

            "text": "Symmetry principles are ubiquitous in the fundamental laws of nature. In the 20th century, it dominated the exploration and formulation of theories in modern physics. With the realisation of its significance in understanding our Universe, we generalised a new class of symmetry related to the background metrical structure in which a field propagates. This new symmetry is induced by a broader class of metric transformations called the disformal transformation generalising conformal transformation that is extensively used in relativity and extensions thereof.\nIn this work, we extend the discovered symmetry under Bekenstein\u2019s disformal\ntransformation of the massless Klein-Gordon equation. In particular, we show that, subject to some conditions, the massless relativistic wave equation for a scalar field in arbitrary dimensions is invariant under the general disformal transformation of the form given by g\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 g\u0302\u00b5\u03bd = Ag\u00b5\u03bd + \u03a6\u00b5\u03a6\u03bd , where \u03a6\u00b5 = C\u03c6;\u00b5 + DX;\u00b5, with the functionals A,C, and D dependent on X = \u22121\n2 \u03c6;\u00b5\u03c6;\u00b5, Y = \u03c6 ;\u00b5X;\u00b5, and Z = X ;\u00b5X;\u00b5. The\nconditions involve a functional relationship between the disformal factors (C,D) and the conformal factor A. In addition to this, with an insight for the preservation of the number of physical degrees of freedom upon transformation, we derive the inverse disformal transformation. The inverse may exist if the conformal factor is restricted to A = A(\u03c6,X). Interestingly, while disformal factors C and D are related to A in view of the symmetry of the Klein-Gordon equation, their functional dependencies include (Y, Z) in addition to (\u03c6,X) on which the conformal factor depends.\nFor future studies, we have at least three tracks in sight. First, we can revisit\nthe other fundamental equations in physics, e.g., the Dirac equation and Maxwell\u2019s equations, that may exhibit an extended symmetry under a hierarchy of disformal transformations. Second, we may ponder on the mass transformation, together with the interaction terms in the action, induced by disformal transformation. Lastly, it would be interesting to investigate disformal transformation, at least of the scalar fields and derivatives thereof, within the realm of quantum field theory in curved spacetime."
