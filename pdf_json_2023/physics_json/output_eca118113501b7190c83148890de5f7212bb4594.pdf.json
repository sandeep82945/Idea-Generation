In the present study, we investigated the effects of TCS against insulin 39 resistance in muscle cells through integrating in vitro experiment and identifying its active 40 biomarker using metabolomics and in molecular docking validation. 41 Materials and methods. We used centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) to isolate 33 42 fractions from methanolic extract of TCS, and then used UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS to identify 43 the detectable metabolites in each fraction. We assessed the insulin sensitization activity of 44 each fraction using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and then used confocal 45 immunocytochemistry microscopy to measure the translocation of glucose transporter 4 46 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane. The identified active metabolites were further simulated for 47 its molecular docking interaction using Autodock Tools. 48 Results. The polar fractions of TCS significantly increased insulin sensitivity, as measured by 49 the inhibition of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) at serine-312 residue 50 (ser312) also the increasing number of translocated GLUT4 and glycogen content. We 51 identified 58 metabolites of TCS, including glycosides, flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, and 52 nucleotides groups. The metabolomics and molecular docking simulations showed the presence 53 of minor metabolites consisting of tinoscorside D, higenamine, and tinoscorside A as the active 54 compounds. 55 Conclusions. Our findings suggest that TCS is a promising new treatment for insulin resistance 56 and the identification of the active metabolites in TCS could lead to the development of new 57 drugs therapies for diabetes that target these pathways. 58",

The polar fractions of TCS significantly increased insulin sensitivity, as measured by 49 the inhibition of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) at serine-312 residue 50 (ser312) also the increasing number of translocated GLUT4 and glycogen content. We 51 identified 58 metabolites of TCS, including glycosides, flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, and 52 nucleotides groups.

Introduction 71 Tinospora crispa (L.) Hook. f. & Thomson is a medicinal plant that belongs to the genus 72 Tinospora of the Menispermaceae family. It is found in primary rainforests or mixed deciduous 73 forests of Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia), Africa, and the northeastern 74 region of India (Ahmad et al., 2016). T. crispa has a variety of local names that follow the 75 language of the region where it grows, including Brotowali, Antawali, and Andawali 76 (Indonesia); Petawali and Akar Seruntum (Malaysia); Giloya (India); Makabuhay, Panyawan, 77 and Manunggal (Philippines) (Heyne, 1987; Keim & Sujarwo, 2021). The synonym names 78 were diverse, including Menispermum crispum L.; Menispermum rimosum (Blume) Spreng.; 79 Menispermum tuberculatum Lam.; Menispermum verrucosum Roxb.; Tinospora rumphii 80 Boerl.; Tinospora tuberculata (Lam.) Beum\u00e9e ex K. Heyne; Tinospora verrucosa (Roxb.) 81 W.Theob. (Keim & Sujarwo, 2021). 82 Empirically, it has been commonly used in traditional medicine to treat various health 83 conditions. In Indonesia, since the early 20th century, the decoction of T. crispa stems has been 84 empirically reported for the therapy of diabetes mellitus as well as a postpartum remedy and 85 muscle pain treatment (Heyne, 1987; Keim & Sujarwo, 2021). In Thailand, the decoction from 86 the stem of T. crispa has been used as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and appetite enhancer 87 (Ahmad et al., 2016). In Malaysia, it is traditionally used for numerous therapeutic purposes 88 such as diabetes, hypertension, appetite stimulation, and protection from mosquito bites (I. 89 Ismail et al., 1931). 90 Scientific studies have shown that T. crispa has a variety of pharmacological activities, 91 including anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic against cancer cell lines, antimalarial, hypoglycaemic, 92 and antifilarial. It also has antioxidant activity, immunomodulatory effect, antinociceptive 93 activity, and hypoglycemic effect (Ahmad et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2016; Hamid et al., 2015; 94 Haque et al., 2020; Klangjareonchai & Roongpisuthipong, 2012; Lam et al., 2012; Lokman et 95 al., 2013; Noor & Ashcroft, 1989; Ruan et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016; Zuhri et al., 2022). 96 The phytochemical composition of T. crispa includes groups of alkaloids, glycosides, 97 diterpenoids, triterpenoids, lactones, steroids, and flavonoids (Ahmad et al., 2016; Thomas et 98\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity. It is made available under a preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in\nThe copyright holder for thisthis version posted September 4, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.01.555830doi: bioRxiv preprint\nal., 2016). The diterpenoid glycosides in T. crispa include borapetosides A-G, with three main 99 constituents as borapetoside A, B, and C. Among others, borapetoside A has been shown to 100 have the highest activity in lowering plasma glucose levels and increasing plasma insulin levels 101 intraperitoneally (Fukuda et al., 1985, 1986; Lam et al., 2018; Ruan et al., 2013; Yonemitsu et 102 al., 1995). Of the Literature studies indicate that the antidiabetic activity of T. crispa is a 103 combination of several mechanisms related to insulin secretion, inhibition of glucose 104 absorption, and insulin signaling in muscle and liver tissues (Ahmad et al., 2016; Thomas et 105 al., 2016; Zuhri et al., 2022). 106 The commonly used method in natural product-based drug discovery research, known as 107 bioassay-guided isolation, is considered as less accurate in identifying bioactive compound 108 markers from natural sources. This approach is less representative for research on complex 109 natural materials (Yuliana et al., 2013). However, to date, the target for insulin sensitization 110 therapy in skeletal muscle and its corresponding bioactive compounds remain undisclosed. 111 Therefore, there is a need for research on the T. crispa using approaches that better represent 112 its activities and mechanisms as a multicomponent system, such as bioinformatics and 113 metabolomics. In this research, we employed this innovative methodology to investigate the 114 pharmacological activity of T. crispa stem (TCS) as insulin sensitizer in vitro and determine 115 its main active constituents, which were subsequently validated using in silico molecular 116 docking study. 117\n2.

Each fraction then 135 evaporated, dried under lyophilization, and was subjected to further analysis. 136 137\n2.3. Cell treatment 138 L6.C11 skeletal muscle cells were maintained in growth medium, consist of DMEM 139 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% (v/v) 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 140 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% (v/v) 250 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B at 37 oC incubator in a 141 humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were seeded at 96 well plate (8000 cells/well) for 142 pIRS1, 48 well plate (24000 cells/well) for glycogen measurements while for GLUT4 143 measurement were seeded at 12 well plate (150000 cells/well) equipped with sterilized round 144 cover slips at the bottom of each plate. After the cells reach 80-90% confluence, the FBS was 145 switched to 2% (v/v) to induce differentiation. It was maintained for 6 days with medium 146 changing every 2 days to fully differentiated myotubes (Tang et al., 2017). 147 Insulin resistance induction was conducted according to previous experimental method 148 (Huang et al., 2002; Zuhri, 2022). Myotube cells were pretreated with high glucose-high insulin 149 medium (25 mmol/L glucose and 100 nmol/L insulin) for 24 hours followed by deprived of 150 serum and glucose (serum free and 5 mmol/L glucose) for 5 hours before incubation with tested 151 materials. The tested fractions were 400 ppm of 33 TCS fractions and the positive control was 152 400 ppm metformin. Both diluted in DMEM with 0.5 % final DMSO concentration, incubated 153 for 24 hours at 37 oC incubator in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The normal control was 154 incubated with the solvent only. The cells were then incubated by acute high glucose-high 155 insulin incubation for 5 minutes. 156 157 2.3.1. pIRS1 ser312 measurement 158\nThe serine-312 phosphorylated IRS1 (pIRS1 ser312) was measured using in cell ELISA 159 assay following manufacture\u2019s manual guide (MBS9501484). Briefly, cells were fixated in 160 plate base, following overnight incubation with primary antibodies, incubation using HRP 161 conjugated secondary antibodies, addition of substrate, and reading the optical density (OD) 162 value at 450 nm.

The inhibition of ser-312 pIRS1 was 164 measured relative to negative control myotube cells. 165 166 2.3.2. Translocated GLUT4 measurement 167\nInsulin resistant induced cells in round cover slip were treated as described above followed 168 by fixation in 4% paraformaldehydes for 15 minutes. GLUT4 conjugated Alexa fluor 488 169 antibody (Rat IgG1, Santa Cruz SC-53566 AF488) was applied to the cells at a dilution of 1:50 170 in 5% FBS overnight in 4 oC. DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining for cell nuclei 171 was conducted by 10 minutes incubating at 20 \u03bcg/mL after washing with PBS. The coverslips 172 than washed in PBS and mounted before confocal imaging (Bradley et al., 2014). Image 173 quantifications were conducted for each slide with two slides replication for each group. At 174 least 5 images were captured per slide, therefore for each group at least 10 images were 175 analyzed. For quantification of GLUT4 fluorescence intensity was carried out using Fiji ImageJ 176 and was kept consistent between images. GLUT4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 177 quantified by measuring the signal intensity after the background reduction for each image. No 178 image processing was carried out prior to intensity analysis. 179\n2.3.3. Glycogen content measurement 180\nGlycogen content was measured using glycogen ELISA kit following manufacture\u2019s 181 manual guide (Mybiosource, MBS729293). Briefly cells were harvested and lysed by three 182 times freeze-thaw cycle. The supernatant then subjected to well coated primary antibody, 183 adding the conjugate, and substrates respectively. The glycogen content was measured based 184 on OD value of the standard curve. 185 186\n2.4. Untargeted metabolomics analysis 187\n2.4.1. Instrumentation and software 188\nWe used Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher 189 Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) to separate the metabolites of TCS. The metabolite 190 quantification analysis was conducted using Thermo XCalibur version 4.2.28.14 and 191 Compound Discoverer 3.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). The multivariate 192 analysis was performed using SIMCA 16 (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). 193 194\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Metabolites identification 195 Freeze dried TCS fractions (n=33) were dissolved in 1 mL of methanol using an ultrasonic 196 water bath at room temperature for 10 min. The mixtures underwent filtration using a 0.2 197 micrometer syringe filter and placed in autosampler vial. Subsequently, an injection of 5 \u00b5L 198 from each mixture was introduced into a Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass 199 spectrometer. 200 We employed an Accucore C18 (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.5 \u00b5m) as the LC separation column, 201 while the UV detector was set at 254 nm wavelength. Heated electrospray ionization was used 202 as the ionization source and the Q-Orbitrap as mass analyzer. Collision energy levels of 18, 35, 203 and 53 eV were used for fragmentation. Other experiments were as follows, spray voltage of 204 3.8 kV, 320 \u00b0C capillary temperature, sheath gas flow rate 15 mL/min, and auxiliary gas flow 205 rate 3 mL/min. The delivery system flow rate was adjusted at 0.3 mL/min, the autosampler 206 temperature was maintained at 10 \u00b0C, and the sample injection volume was 5 \u00b5L. The mobile 207 phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (A) as the gradient elution 208 system. The total scan time was 32 min with 2 min of calibration. The scan was set for full 209 MS/dd MS2 scan ranges from 100 to 1500 m/z in positive and negative mode. 210 The mass spectrometer data were processed and quantitively analyzed using Thermo 211 XCalibur and Compound Discoverer 3.3 software. The minimum peak detection was set at 212 10,000. The steps are including selecting and aligning the mass spectra, detecting known 213 compound using databases, detecting the unknown compounds, identify the unknown 214 compound by fragmentation patterns of mass spectrum (MS and MS/MS), spectral matching 215 using previous studies related to Menispermaceae family and predictive fragmentation 216 algorithms using CFM-ID (https://cfmid.wishartlab.com/predict) (Wang et al., 2022). The 217 databases used in this study were mzCloud, ChemSpider (Pence & Williams, 2010) and 218 PubChem (Kim et al., 2019). The mass error value (10 ppm) was set as the filtering criteria. 219 220\n2.5. Molecular docking 221 The ten main active metabolites based on metabolomics and multivariate data analysis 222 (MVDA) would be studied using molecular docking. Its two dimensional structures were 223 acquired from PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Kim et al., 2019). The crystal 224 structure of GLUT4 as target proteins were downloaded from Research Collaboratory for 225 Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) (https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB ID: 3PCU) (Berman, 2000; 226 Y.

Subsequently, the pdbqt format files were transformed from PDB format files by 229 AutoDock Tools. The docking area was set at 40x40x40 at the docking site following its native 230 ligand position. The affinities of each compound to its target protein were simulated by 231 molecular docking using AutoDockTools software (Morris et al., 2009). The docking 232 validation was conducted by redocking its native ligand with RMSD value < 2 Amstrong from 233 its reference crystal structure as the threshold (Astiani et al., 2023). 234 235\n2.6. Statistical analysis 236 Quantitative data were presented as mean + SD (standard deviation). Normality and 237 homogeneity data were required before the ANOVA test. One way ANOVA tests were 238 performed for each variable measurement. If there were significant difference between groups, 239 data than analyzed using Tukey\u2019s comparison test with multiple comparison to negative control 240 group. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San 241 Diego, CA, USA). Correlation analysis between the three measured variables was also 242 performed using GraphPad Prism through Pearson correlation analysis. 243 The multivariate analysis was conducted in unsupervised manner using principal 244 component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent square (OPLS) performed using 245 SIMCA software 16.0 (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). OPLS analysis used to reduce the 246 dimensionality of data sets that contain both predictor and response variables, while preserving 247 as much of the variation in the data as possible (Triba et al., 2015). In this study, we use OPLS 248 model to find a linear relationship between two matrices: a predictor matrix of mass 249 spectrometric data from TCS fractions (X matrix) and a response matrix of inhibition of pIRS1 250 ser312, enhancing translocated GLUT4 and glycogen (Y matrix). Each of the measured 251 variables was developed into its own OPLS model. 252 253 3. Result and discussion 254 3.1. In vitro effect of TCS on insulin resistant induced L6.C11 skeletal muscle cell 255 To examine the bioactivity of TCS fractions, we carried out an in vitro study to identify the 256 most potent fraction as insulin sensitizer. We firstly developed a cell model of insulin resistance 257 based on previous procedure (Huang et al., 2002). We chose L6.C11 skeletal muscle cells 258 because they have sufficient expression of IRS1 and GLUT4, which can be well measured 259 using the chosen method. It has been previously reported that hyperinsulinemia conditions lead 260\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

T. 263 crispa has been reported to have a multiple targets-multiple components mechanism for its 264 insulin-sensitizing activity, with the prediction of main pathway being the PI3K/Akt pathway 265 (Zuhri et al., 2022). The measurement of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 at 266 serine312 (IRS1 ser312) inhibition, glycogen content, and translocated GLUT4 are considered 267 to be respective variables for the insulin-sensitizing activity of TCS. 268 269\n3.1.1. Inhibitory activity of TCS on ser312 IRS1 phosphorylation 270 The alterations in pIRS1 ser312 in L6.C11 skeletal muscle cells were measured in the TCS 271 treated groups using the in-cell ELISA assay. The phosphorylation of IRS1 in ser312 may 272 induce several defects on insulin signaling, including dissociation of IRS1 from the receptor 273 concomitant with IRS1 degradation and interrupts IRS1 binding to its downstream effectors 274 (Boura-Halfon & Zick, 2009). Inhibition of serine phosphorylation was one of emerging 275 indicator of insulin sensitization regarding its in-line effect of increasing AKT phosphorylation. 276 Under conditions of low phosphorylation of ser312, insulin signaling will be activated, whereas 277 under conditions of its high phosphorylation, insulin signaling will be inhibited (Copps & 278 White, 2012). The ser-312 pIRS inhibitory properties of the TCS fractions differed in each 279 fraction (Figure 1A and Supplementary material 1). 280 The one way ANOVA test showed a significant differences (p<0.0001; F=53.02) in 281 inhibition activity of TCS fraction compared to the negative control (C-). The test showed that 282 all treatment groups had a significant difference from the negative control except for treatment 283 F8, F10, and F11 (p=0.2129; 0.1556; 0.9535). The C- group is a group of cells that were 284 induced to insulin resistance and then incubated with only solvent. This group represents a high 285 state of ser312 phosphorylation on IRS1, so a significant difference from this group is the 286 expected treatment result. The post hoc Tukey\u2019s Test result showed that the F3 was 287 comparatively the most effective in reducing ser312 IRS1 phosphorylation than the other 288 fractions. It reached 43.68 + 3.20% inhibition, followed by fraction F7 (44.30 + 1.92%) and 289 fraction F1 (40.84 + 4.40%). Fraction F3 from TCS is a fraction obtained from descending 290 CPC fractionation at the early elution stage, which provides a gradient of polarity from polar 291 to non-polar at the end of fractionation. Therefore, fraction F3 is a polar fraction. Based on the 292 trend of bioactivity from the tested fractions, polar fractions (F1 to F7) tend to have higher 293\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The active compounds responsible for the activity will be 294 identified through OPLS multivariate analysis in section 3.3. 295 3.1.2. Induce GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane 296 The translocation of GLUT4 to cell membrane remains the key effect of insulin signaling 297 that deployed to glucose uptake to the intracellular environment. The embedded GLUT4 in cell 298 membrane is a requirement for glucose uptake from the circulation. Immunocytochemistry 299 technique using GLUT4 specific antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 488 (AF488) was 300 conducted to reveal the increasing amount of translocated GLUT4 in cell membrane. The 301 immunofluorescence was observed under confocal microscope at the same fluorescence 302 wavelength using 63x magnifying factor. 303 The one-way ANOVA test results revealed significant differences among the treatment 304 groups, as presented in Figure 1B and supplementary material 2. Significant differences (p< 305 0.05) in translocated GLUT4 compared to negative control were found in every TCS fraction 306 with differ potency. In the previous study, it has been reported that GLUT4 transcription was 307 unaltered when the glucose uptake was elevated in insulin resistant L6.C11 cells treated with 308 T. crispa, measured by RT-PCR method (Noipha & Ninlaaesong, 2011). 309 Our findings showed a significant increase of GLUT4 that embedded to cell membrane 310 as a result of TCS treatment. Further research is needed to investigate whether the increased 311 translocation of GLUT4 is influenced by the level of GLUT4 transcription. The mean 312 fluorescence intensity effected by F3 incubation was the most effective in inducing GLUT4 313 translocation to cell membrane (64.07 + 1.78 AU) compared to the other fraction and even 314 higher than the metformin treatment (49.01 + 1.12 AU) at the same concentration (400 ppm). 315 The representative images of confocal observation are shown in Figure 2 and the complete 316 images were shown at Supplementary material 4. 317\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Activity of TCS as glycogen enhancer 343 The outcome effect of insulin signaling in cell culture was measured using the glycogen 344 production in the L6.C11 skeletal muscle cells. All the TCS fractions showed significant 345 induction of glycogen production compared to the negative control (Figure 1C and 346 supplementary material 3). Our result showed that the F3 (2.55 + 0.12 \u03bcg/mL) was the most 347 effective fraction to induce glycogen production compared to the other fractions. Its activity 348 was even higher than the metformin treatment (2.33 + 0.16 \u03bcg/mL) at the same concentration. 349 Glycogen was the outcome product of insulin signaling to keep the glucose homeostasis.

A limitation of this study is that the biomass 352 of L6.C11 cell culture was not measured, so no data was available to reflect muscle mass. The 353 glycogen content of 2.55 + 0.12 \u03bcg/mL in the F3 treatment showed a three-fold increase 354 compared to the negative control, indicating the positive effect of TCS in attenuating insulin 355 resistance conditions. 356 357\n3.1.3. Correlation of inhibition of pIRS1 ser312, translocated GLUT4, and glycogen 358 content 359 Pearson correlation analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software to investigate 360 the relationship between the three variables. Normality and homogeneity tests were conducted 361 prior to correlation analysis. The results of the normality test using Shapiro-Wilk test showed 362 that the data was normally distributed (p>0.05) and Levene's homogeneity of variances test 363 showed that the data was homogeneous with a p-value>0.05. The results of the Pearson 364 correlation test showed a positive and significant correlation between pIRS1 ser312 inhibition 365 and GLUT4 translocation (p<0.05) with 59% coefficient determination value (Figure 3). 366\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Glucose that has 384 entered the cell is then converted into glycogen through a process initiated by the glycogenesis 385 and glycogen synthase enzymes (Gual et al., 2005). The process is a complex signaling cascade, 386 and inhibition of pIRS1 ser312 and GLUT4 translocation only has a small correlational 387 contribution to glycogen content. 388 389\n3.2. Putative identification of TCS metabolites 390 Putative identification of phytoconstituents present in TCS was performed in this study as 391 explained in 2.4.2 subsection. Phytochemicals found in natural product were in a complex 392 mixture at wide polarity differences (Q. W. Zhang et al., 2018). The CPC fractionation process 393 was expected to produce slightly different compound combinations for each obtained fraction, 394 which might have varied biological potency. A total of 2667 features were detected in both 395 positive and negative ionization modes. By analyzing the MS1 and MS1 mass spectra of the 396 analyte peaks, 58 metabolites were successfully identified using data from previous studies and 397 databases (Table 2) (Ahmad et al., 2016; Bowen & Motawe, 1985; Choudhary, Ismail, Ali, et 398 al., 2010; Choudhary, Ismail, Shaari, et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2010; Fukuda et al., 1985, 1993; 399 Gao et al., 2016; M. Ismail & Choudhary, 2016; Kim et al., 2019; Lam et al., 2018, 2012; Li et 400 al., 2004a, 2004b; Pachaly et al., 1992; Thomas et al., 2016; Van Kiem et al., 2010; Xu et al., 401 2017; Yonemitsu et al., 1995; Y. Zhang et al., 2010). 402 Based on the PCA analysis (Figure 4), the TCS fractions were divided into four clusters 403 regarding their chemical profile similarity. The first two main components remain presenting 404 88.2% of the total variance. It was showed that sequentially the group 1 to 5 had tinosporol C, 405 n-feruloyloctopamine, n-feruloyloctopamine, borapetoside I, and columbin as their most 406 abundant metabolites. Group 1 consists of F1 to F6 (A, B, and C), group 2 consists of F10 (A, 407 B, and C) and F11 (A and C), group 3 consists of F7 and F9 (A, B, and C), group 4 consists of 408 F8A, B, and C, and group 5 only consist of F11B. The grouped fractions indicate the similarity 409 of their chemical profile. It is indicated that the fractions have different compositions. 410 Phytochemicals, as other chemicals have a selective of solubility based on its polarity or 411 stated as \u201clike dissolves like\u201d. Polar chemicals are more likely to solved in polar solvent and 412 vice versa (Lefebvre et al., 2021; Smith et al., 1977). Our work was conducted CPC 413 fractionation using H Arizona solvent system (n hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water; 1-3-1-414 3) those solvents created two immiscible biphasic solvents. The lower phase or aqueous phase 415\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The solvent 416 mixture saturates each other, constructing a unique solvent composition. The polar phase from 417 Arizona system type H consist of 67.2 water, 11.9 ethyl acetate, 0.04 hexane, and 20.9 methanol 418 (% v/v) (Berthod et al., 2005). This polar solvent mixture would likely dissolve polar 419 phytoconstituents from TCS methanol extract. 420 The identified metabolites were grouped in glycosides, flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, 421 and nucleotides groups. Therefore, it did not directly represent the most active metabolites as 422 insulin sensitizer. To identify the highly active metabolites, we conducted OPLS analysis to 423 reveal the highly correlated metabolites to each measured bioactivity. 424 425\n3.3. Identification of TCS active metabolites 435 The OPLS model was further established to identify the active biomarker of TCS in each 436 measured bioactivity. Before further examination of OPLS model, the quality of the OPLS 437 models were assessed (Figure 5). In general, R2Y and Q2 provide an estimation of fitness and 438 quality of the model prediction. To achieve a high predictive ability, the values of R2Y and Q2 439 should be close to one. The OPLS model generates values of 0.955 and 0.939 suggesting that 440 the model has excellent reliability and predictability (Triba et al., 2015). 441\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

The first two principal components (PCs) explain 76.4% of the total variance in the 444 OPLS model. The OPLS analysis results indicate that the fractions with the highest activity, in 445 consecutive order, are fraction 3 (A, B, and C), fraction 1A, fraction 5 (B and C), and fraction 446 4B. It seems that the solvent polarity contributes to the separation of samples, which is related 447 to their activity. The TCS polar fractions tend to be more active than the less polar fraction. 448 The results of the OPLS model were verified by a permutation test. At the three bioactivity 449 dataset, shown that the Q2 point of the model from left to right is lower than the original Q2 450 point, and the R2 and Q2 values of the model are more than 0.9. Those which indicates that the 451 model can reliably predict the results without any overfitting phenomenon (n=100) (Triba et 452 al., 2015) (Figure 5). 453 To determine the metabolites with the highest contribution to bioactivity, the OPLS loading 454 plot and Y-related profiles were under scrutinized. In the loading plot, the closer the coordinates 455 of a metabolite to the zero coordinates (0,0), means the smaller of its contribution to the 456 bioactivity (Figure 6). We also used Variable of Importance Projection (VIP) scores to estimate 457 the contribution of each metabolite to the bioactivities as predicted by the OPLS model. The 458 VIP scores > 1 was set as threshold for minimal contribution (Yuliana, Khatib, Verpoorte, & 459 Choi, 2011). 26 metabolites reached this threshold as metabolites marked in Table 2. The Y-460 related coefficient plot indicated the correlation of metabolites to insulin sensitizer activity 461 (Figure 7). The higher value regarded a higher correlation. Metabolites that showed the greatest 462 contribution to bioactivity were isovitexin, syringin, tyramine, senesionine, tinoscorsida D, 463 tinoscorsida A, higenamin, scopoletine, cytidine, and tinocordiside. The metabolites also pass 464 the threshold for the VIP value. It can be concluded that all signals from the active compounds 465 have a significant contribution to the insulin sensitizing activity. 466\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Validation the TCS active metabolites using in silico molecular docking study 492 AutoDockTools was used to validate the accuracy of TCS active compound revealed by 493 metabolomics study. This in silico study could determine the binding activity between primary 494 active metabolites and GLUT4 as their key therapeutic target. The energy level denotes the 495 binding strength, with lower energy levels indicating a stronger binding capacity. Typically, if 496 the docking calculation score falls below -7 kcal/mol, the binding affinity is classified as potent 497 (An et al., 2021). Based on the data presented in Table 3, the computed binding energies 498 between ten primary active components to GLUT4 demonstrated a close or even lower value 499 than -7. All the active metabolites have a higher binding affinity than metformin. The top five 500 active metabolites consist of tinoscorside D, tinoscorside A, senecionin, higenamine, and 501 tinocordiside suggesting a favorable binding interaction. The ligand binding site of the docking 502 simulation result showed a remarkable active sites of GLUT4 as plotted in Figure 8 (Berman, 503 2000). The highest binding affinity towards the GLUT4 protein model was tinoscorside D, with 504 a binding energy of -10.92 kcal/mol. 505 The discovery of three active compounds in brotowali, namely tinoscorside D, higenamine, 506 and tinoscorside A, is a novel finding that has important implications for the development of 507 new treatments for insulin resistance. These findings are consistent with our previous study, 508 which identified tinoscorside A as the active compound in brotowali (Zuhri et al., 2022). 509 Tinoscorside A, despite being the least abundant compound in the active fraction, exhibits a 510 high correlation with bioactivity, as evidenced by the area under the curve in the mass spectra. 511 These results suggest that tinoscorside A may be a promising candidate for the development of 512 new antidiabetic drugs (Tabel 1). 513 Tinoscorside D is a member of phenolic glycoside group that have previously been reported 514 to be present in the plant Tinospora cordifolia. Our study identified the presence of this 515 compound in T. crispa, a plant that belongs to the same genus and shares similarities in its 516 chemical composition and bioactivity (Chi et al., 2016). Higenamine is an alkaloid compound 517 that has also been reported to be present in T. crispa and is known for its active role as an 518 antihypertensive agent (Praman et al., 2012). 519 These three compounds are minor compounds that are difficult to detect in natural product 520 formulations. This is because natural medicinal sources are complex and require repeated 521 fractionation and characterization, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Metabolomics 522 methods are considered capable of expediting the identification process of both minor and 523 major active compounds (Salem et al., 2020; Wishart, 2016; Yuliana et al., 2014). 524 525\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

These previous 530 studies used in vitro and in vivo methods to investigate the effects of these compounds, and 531 they found that borapetoside A increased glycogen synthesis and decreased plasma glucose 532 activity (Ruan et al., 2013). However, in this study, we used metabolomics to identify active 533 compounds in TCS considering metabolomics as a powerful tool that can identify multiple 534 compounds simultaneously. Our findings suggest that the three active compounds detected 535 through metabolomics have great potential as candidate of new drugs for addressing insulin 536 resistance. 537\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseperpetuity.

Conclusion 544 The recent study deciphered, for the first time, tinoscorside D, tinoscorside A, and 545 higenamine as the active constituents of TCS to insulin insulin resistance by combined in vitro, 546 metabolomics, and in silico methods. Our data demonstrated that TCS could reduce IRS1 547 ser312 phosphorylation, promote GLUT4 translocation, and increase glycogen. TCS 548 eventually ameliorated L6.C11 induced insulin resistance skeletal muscle cells through multi-549 component and multi-target effects. This valuable finding may provide theoretical support for 550 further study as drug candidates of novel insulin sensitizing agents.
