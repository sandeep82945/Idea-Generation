Moreover, the limit of detection, linear range, and sensitivity for glucose and H2O2 were investigated (CV: 2.5 nM L \u22121 and 25 nM L\u22121, 50\u2013500 mM, 0.052 and 0.072 mA mmol cm\u22122; DPV: 3.1 nM L\u22121 and 18 nM L\u22121, 50\u2013500 mM, 0.062 and 0.066 mA mmol cm\u22122 and CA: 10 nM L\u22121 and 20 nM L\u22121, 50\u2013500 mM, 0.098 and 0.07 mA mmol cm\u22122, respectively). In addition, the\nAlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode showed good selectivity for the detection of glucose and H2O2 in the presence of common interfering substances, such as AA, DA, UA, glycine, L-cysteine, nitrite, Pb(II),\nCd(II), Cu(II), Co(II), Hg(II), Zn(II), and glucose. For the detection of glucose and H2O2, the kinetic parameters, including the electron transfer coefficient and catalytic reaction rate constant, were also\nestablished.

Diabetes is caused by abnormal blood sugar levels.5 Thus, the detection of analytes, such as hydrogen peroxide and glucose, have been extensively explored using enzyme-free electrochemical sensors owing to their major usefulness in numerous sectors. Patients must frequently check their blood sugar levels to manage their blood sugar. Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a simple but crucial natural molecule, is widely employed as an oxidizing agent in the food and chemical sectors.6,7 Thus, glucose sensors are also being studied extensively together with H2O2 sensors. The blood sugar level is determined by the amount of glucose present in the human body. In addition, H2O2 serves as a precursor for the development of highly reactive and potentially dangerous hydroxyl radicals and is one of the most signicant indicators of oxidative stress.8,9 Therefore, it is crucial for practical purposes to accurately measure glucose and H2O2.

Presently, in-depth research is being conducted on phthalocyanines as multifunctional chemicals, which are important in both modern technology and medicine.16\u201321 The highly delocalized planar 18-electrons in phthalocyanines (Pcs) increase its electronic structure. Furthermore, these compounds are actively researched as materials of outstanding technical value because of their benets, including exceptional stability, exibility, and recyclability (use in semiconductor devices, solar cells, photosensitisers, nonlinear optics, etc.).22\u201324\nIn the current study, a unique multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite with aluminum(III) tetra methoxyquinoline\u2013carboxamide phthalocyanine (Al(III)TMQNCAPc) on a modied glassy carbon electrode was synthesized and characterized (GCE). As observed by SEM, Al(III)TMQNCAPCs were visible on the surface of Al(III)TMQNCAPCs@MWCNTs. Furthermore, the synthesized materials were thoroughly characterized. Al(III)TMQNCAPCs@MWCNTs performed satisfactorily in electrochemical tests for the oxidation of glucose and reduction of H2O2. Based on these results, we fabricated a sensitive glucose sensor with good selectivity and long-term stability. The study of the H2O2 sensor revealed that it had a broad linear range, good sensitivity, and selectivity."

In the case of Al(III) TCAPc, the Q-band appears in the range of 500\u2013700 nm, while the B-band appears at 200\u2013350 nm (Fig. S2,\u2020 inset a curve). The UV-vis studies of phthalocyanine exhibited two strong absorption peaks. Between them, the Q band in the range of 620\u2013 730 nm is attributed to the p\u2013p* transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the Pc ring. The deeper p-level/ LUMO transition, which occurs in the range of 300\u2013350 nm, correspond to the B band (Fig. S2,\u2020 inset b curve).29\u201331 Fig. S2\u2020 depicts the UV-vis spectrum of the compound shown in Scheme 1 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 28 \u00b0C. The red and green colors of the complex exhibited a peak in the Q-band area and a shoulder peak between 570 and 625 nm, showing the effective aggregation of PC.\nThe powder X-ray diffraction study of Al(III)TCAPc, Al(III) TMQNCAPc, MWCNTs and Al(III)TMQNCAPc@MWCNTs was performed in the 2q range of 5\u201360\u00b0, as shown in Fig. S3,\u2020 inset curves ((a) Al(III)TCAPc, (b) Al(III)TMQNCAPc, (c) MWCNTs and (d) Al(III)TMQNCAPc@MWCNTs). The crystal structure and size of the QDs were claried by PXRD investigation. The replacement complex and parent PCs displayed the same patterns. However, compared to similar aluminum PCs, the patterns have a higher peak intensity throughout the complex. The crystallinity was described using powdered X-ray diffraction (PXRD)\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\npatterns.32,33 The diffraction pattern of Al(III)TMQNCAPc show sharps peaks at 7\u00b0, 8\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 24\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 46\u00b0, and 55\u00b0 with slightly lower intensity, which was caused by the conjugation of the pelectrons, manipulating its stacking arrangement. The shapes of the X-ray diffraction patterns indicate that Al(III)TCAPc, Al(III) TMQNCAPc, MWCNTs and Al(III)TMQNCAPc@MWCNTs were crystalline in nature.34,35\nThe thermal stability and decomposition characteristics of the synthetic phthalocyanine compound and MWCNT composites were revealed by TGA tests. Fig. S4\u2020 depicts the thermogram for the thermal degradation of the phthalocyanines. The monomeric Al(III)TCAPc was shown to be stable up to 500 \u00b0C in the thermograms, but it subsequently began to breakdown in an air atmosphere at around 500 \u00b0C to 560 \u00b0C, which caused rapid weight loss, in accordance with the degradation of the core structure of the Al(III)TCAPc molecule (inset curve a). In comparison, the substituted Al(III)TMQNCAPc was found to be stable up to 650 \u00b0C (curve b), aer which the Al(III) TMQNCAPc@MWCNT molecule began to breakdown in the air atmosphere between 600 \u00b0C to 650 \u00b0C (curve c). Due to the extended conjugation and delocalization of the p-electrons, Al(III)TMQNCAPc@MWCNTs exhibited superior thermal stability compared to Al(III)TMQNCAPc and MWCNTs. The stable TGA curve aer 650 \u00b0C corresponds to the respective metal oxide formed aer complete degradation of PCs.36\u201338\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20723\u201320736 | 20727\nFig. 6 CVs plot of (A) different concentrations of glucose/mM (50 to 500 mmol), (B) linear plot of different concentrations of glucose vs. current at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121, (C) different scan rates of glucose (10 to 100 mV s\u22121) and (D) linear plot of different scan rates of glucose vs. current by AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The FESEM images of Al(III)TMQNCAPc@MWCNTs, as shown in Fig. S5 and S6\u2020 at different magnications, show that every particle in Al(III)TMQNCAPc is rmly linked to MWCNTs. As shown in Fig. S5(A\u2013D),\u2020 the Al(III)TMQNCAPc molecules resemble pellet shapes. The successful incorporation of MWCNTs in Al(III)TMQNCAPc was proven by the observation of densely absorbed MWCNTs on its surface, as shown in Fig. S6(A\u2013D).\u2020 The cross-section of Al(III)TMQNCAPc also contained MWCNTs, which were incorporated in the material. MWCNTs were evenly distributed over these structures, which resemble pellets. These results conrmed that MWCNTs were present on the surface of Al(III)TMQNCAPc. As presented in Fig. S5(A\u2013D),\u2020 crystals in agglomerated form are visible in the SEM images of Al(III)TMQNCAPc and Al(III) TMQNCAPc@MWCNTs, which were detected at distinct stages at the mM and nM levels. This was further demonstrated by the powdered X-ray diffraction technique (ESI, Fig. S3\u2020).\nThe substitution of aluminium(III) phthalocyanine resulted in an increase in the surface area accessible for electrons to store charge on the surface of the molecule. This is due to the agglomeration of MWCNTs on the surface of the molecule. Electron microscopy techniques were used to study the morphological characteristics of the two catalysts (Fig. 1A). The\n20728 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20723\u201320736\nSEM image (Fig. 1A) of the Al(III)TMQNCAPc catalyst shows the presence of micrometer- and nanometer-sized agglomerated particles of black pearls (carbon spheres). Compared to the Al(III)TMQNCAPc catalyst, the composite multi-walled carbon nanotube-based catalyst (MWCNTs) exhibited a clearly distinct shape. The SEM image (Fig. 1B) of the Al(III)TMQNCAPc catalyst revealed the presence of individual, large micrometer-sized crystallites. However, more in-depth imaging further demonstrated the abundance of carbon nanotubes in the nanostructure of the crystallites.39"

The bare GCE showed no response (a curve), 200 mM of glucose was detected with a low peak current response by the AlTMQNCAPc@GC electrode (b curve), while 200 mM of glucose was detected by the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode with a high oxidation peak current and positive peak potential (c curve), showing a better result than the composite without MWCNTs (b curve) at the potential of +315 mV in PBS (pH 7) electrolyte solution. Therefore, the sensitivity of the GCE should be further improved for real sample analysis by chemical modication. Furthermore, in addition to electronic conductivity, other factors affect the sensing performance, where some affect it more than electronic conductivity, such as the ability to absorb and accumulate glucose. The dependence of the oxidation current on the different modied electrodes is shown in Fig. 7B. The inuence of different concentrations (50\u2013500 mM) of glucose at the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode was also investigated by DPV. The peak current slightly increased as the potential shied linearly from +315 mV (glucose), as shown in Fig. 7C, with the linear plot of different concentrations of glucose vs. peak current and correlation coefficient of 0.999 shown in Fig. 7D. The detection limit of glucose using the proposed method was found to be 12 nmol L\u22121 at a signal-tonoise ratio of 3 in the linear range of 50\u2013500 mmol L\u22121. A comparison of the limit of detection obtained using the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode with recently reported methods is presented in Table S1,\u2020 which obviously species an enhancement compared to the reported values.\nAs shown in Fig. S7(A),\u2020 the oxidation current peak of glucose increased with an increase in the catalyst loading in the range of 50\u2013250 mM. The dependence of glucose oxidation current on the catalyst loading is shown in Fig. S7(B).\u2020 The highest oxidation current was observed for 250 mM catalyst, which was set for further experiments. This can be attributed to the thickness of the loaded catalyst on the surface of the electrode. The inuence of pH was checked by DPV analysis in the presence of glucose. As shown in Fig. S7(C),\u2020 the oxidation current of glucose increased from pH 3.0 to 11.0. The highest oxidation peak of glucose was observed at pH 7.0, which suggests that the most electrooxidation occurred at the surface of the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode. The dependence of the oxidation current and oxidation potential on the pH is shown in Fig. S7(D).\u2020 As observed, the oxidation potential of glucose was found to shi towards a negative value linearly with an increase in the pH (7.0 to 11.0) of the electrolyte.\nFig. 8A demonstrates the evaluation of the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode for the detection of H2O2 in neutral phosphate buffer solution containing 100 mMH2O2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121 at various AlTMQNCAPc@GC electrodes (curve a, without analyte), where the AlTMQNCAPc@GC\n20732 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20723\u201320736\nelectrode detected low peak current responses in the presence of H2O2 (b curve) compared to the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode (c curve).

Generally, the electrocatalysts were evaluated by measuring the current at different applied potentials (+0.3 V and \u22120.45 V) and time aer the addition of the analytes of glucose and H2O2. Therefore, amperometry measurements were performed at a detection potential of +300 mV in neutral PBS solution containing the AlTMQNCAPc@GC and AlTMQNCAPc@CNT/GC electrodes (Fig. 9C, curves b and c), respectively, where upon the addition of glucose, a high peak current was detected (c curve) compared to without MWCNTs (b curve) and the bare GCE (curve a). The electrochemical responses were recorded while the solution was constantly stirred.

Thus, we studied the selectivity of the present glucose and H2O2 biosensor against these possible interfering species by measuring the amperometric response to the successive addition of physiological levels of various interfering species (50 mM of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA), glycine, Lcysteine, nitrite, Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Co(II), Hg(II), Zn(II) and glucose) at the potential of +0.300 V (Fig. 10A, b\u2013m marked by arrows), where the twelve interfering species generated a completely negligible current response compared to the current responses of glucose (Fig. 10A, a marked by an arrow). Also, the same interfering physiological species were investigated in the amperometry determination of H2O2 by the modied electrode at an applied potential of \u22120.450 V, where each species was added at 50 s intervals. L-Alanine, L-arginine, glycine, L-cysteine, Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Co(II), and Hg(II) were detected with negligible current responses (Fig. 10B, b\u2013j marked by arrows) and H2O2 (Fig. 10B, a marked by arrow). The following two explanations can be used to explain the high selectivity. On the one hand, the relatively low detection potential may signicantly reduce the reactions to typical electroactive interferences. On the other hand, the addition of MWCNTs to the AlTMQNCAPc@GC electrode also helped to reduce interferences because their neutral charged prevent interfering species (such as AA, DA, and UA) from reaching the electrode surface.45\u201347\n4.2.2 Stability and reproducibility studies. The long-term storage stability, operational stability, and repeatability of the AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode were further examined using the amperometric current\u2013time method. By continuously measuring 100 nM glucose and H2O2 for 60 min, the operational stability was tested. Aer 60 min, the response remained constant and continued to be sensitive to glucose and H2O2 (Fig. S9(A) and (B)\u2020), respectively. Moreover, in the cyclic voltammograms with 10 consecutive scans on the same sensor, the oxidation peak and reduction peak were nearly identical (Fig. S10(A)\u2020 glucose and S10(B)\u2020 H2O2). The operational stability was very good, as indicated by the relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1.7% and 2.6%, respectively.\n4.2.3 Determination of real sample analysis in the clinic using 3% hydrogen peroxide. The AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode was used to determine the concentration of H2O2 in a clinical product (3% solution) to conrm the accuracy of the procedure for the analysis. Specically, 50, 100, and 150 mmol L\u22121 H2O2 solution was injected in a 10 mL volume ask and made up to the volume with PBS (pH 7). Then, using the DPV method, this test solution was added to an electrochemical cell for the detection of H2O2. The analytical results are listed in Table S2.\u2020 The results were satisfactory and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods for estimating the presence of 3% H2O2 in clinical products.\n4.2.4 Application for the detection of glucose in human urine samples. The AlTMQNCAPc@MWCNT/GC electrode was used to detect human urine under less-than-ideal circumstances to further conrm that it accurately predicted the real sample of human urine. As shown in Table S3,\u2020 the recovery rate of the sample increased from 96.15% to 102.33%. The\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
