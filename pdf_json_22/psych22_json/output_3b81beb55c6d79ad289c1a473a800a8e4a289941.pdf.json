    "abstractText": "(1) Background: Negative experiences during adolescence increase the vulnerability to develop mental disorders later in life. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these long-term alterations could help to identify better therapeutic interventions. (2) Methods: Adolescent male Wistar rats were used to explore the effects of repeated stress and alcohol exposure on anxietylike behaviors, plasma corticosterone levels and the gene expression of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and other relevant signaling systems (glutamatergic, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)) in the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). (3) Results: Overall, both stress and alcohol induced anxiety-like behaviors, but only the alcohol-exposed rats displayed increased plasma levels of corticosterone. In the amygdala, there was a general deficit in the gene expression of the ECS and increases in the mRNA levels of certain subunits of glutamate receptors. Interestingly, there were significant interaction effects between stress and alcohol on the expression of the NMDA receptor subunits. In addition, increased mRNA levels of the CRH receptor were observed in alcohol-exposed rats. In the mPFC, alcohol exposure was associated with an increase in the gene expression of the ECS. By contrast, the combination of stress and alcohol produced opposite effects. (4) Conclusions: In summary, early stress and alcohol exposure induced long-term anxiety-like behavior in male rats but different mechanisms are involved in these maladaptive changes in the brain.",

During this period of maturation, many morphological and functional changes occur, which make the adolescent brain highly vulnerable to the impact of stressful events in neuronal circuitry. In fact, repeated life stress is considered as one of the major environmental risk factors that increases vulnerability to later psychiatric disorders [1]. Thus, when stress is experienced during adolescence, it produces enduring effects on behavior, including an increased susceptibility to an early onset of problem drinking and\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10030593 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593 2 of 22\nthe emergence of psychiatric disorders in adulthood, such as anxiety and substance use disorders [2,3]. Restraint is widely used as a stressor in rodent models, because this model of stress does not cause physical pain or harm to the animals [4]. Numerous preclinical studies have described the behavioral and hormonal effects of repeated restraint stress, including depressive-like behaviors, anxiety-like behaviors, cognition impairments and increased plasma corticosterone levels [for review see [5]]. However, these responses associated with repeated restraint stress are more evident in adolescents than in adult rodents [6,7]. While in adult male rodents there is a habituation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to repeated exposure to the same stressor (i.e., a homotypic stressor) [8,9], repeated stress leads to an increase in the stress-induced HPA responses in early adolescence [10,11]. These sensitized hormonal stress responses might contribute to the adolescent vulnerability to develop mental disorders in adulthood [7]. Another risk factor during adolescence to facilitate vulnerability to mental disorders later in life is alcohol consumption [12,13]. Similar to stress, the adolescent brain is highly sensitive to the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Thus, adolescent alcohol exposure induces alterations in brain structure and function that could lead to behavioral changes, including increased anxiety, alcohol preference or cognitive deficits [for review see [14,15]]. The most common drinking pattern among adolescents is binge drinking, which is considered a serious public health concern. This problematic drinking pattern consists of consuming large quantities of alcohol in a period of approximately 2 h to reach blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) of at least 80 mg/dL [16]. Binge drinking is associated with a range of acute alcohol-related problems, but also with long-term consequences, which include an increased risk of alcohol use disorders (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression [17\u201319]. Because both stress and alcohol consumption during specific developmental periods can have harmful consequences on the adolescent brain and behavior, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the increased vulnerability to develop AUD and/or other psychiatric disorders is necessary for better prevention and treatment strategies. Substantial evidence has shown that stress and alcohol exposure can affect the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) [for review see [20\u201322]], which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of psychiatric diseases. The ECS is a lipid signaling system expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues, which is involved in several physiological functions, including the modulation of the brain reward circuitry and emotional homeostasis [20,23]. This relevant modulatory system is composed of two major types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1R and CB2R), their endogenous ligands or endocannabinoids (the best-studied are two arachidonic acid derivatives, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide or AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)), and the enzymes involved in synthesis, transportation and degradation of endocannabinoids [24]. There is now considerable evidence demonstrating that the ECS can modulate alcoholrelated behaviors, as well as the stress response [for review see [20,25,26]]. Anatomically, the ECS is prominently expressed within the mesocorticolimbic areas that are important for reward and motivation, including the hippocampus, amygdala, striatum or prefrontal cortex (PFC) [27\u201330]. Given the importance of these circuits in the regulation of emotion and reward, and the role of the ECS in the modulation of both stress responses and alcoholrelated behaviors, it is possible that negative experiences during adolescence may lead to a dysregulation of the endocannabinoid function. Thus, the combination of stressful experience with alcohol consumption during this developmental period may be associated with a dysregulated ECS that influences vulnerability to mental illness in adulthood. Recently, we have reported that both acute restraint stress and alcohol exposure during adolescence result in an increased anxiety-like behavior and high plasma levels of corticosterone in young adult male rats, but this anxious phenotype is associated with different mechanisms in the amygdala [31]. Thus, while acute restraint stress mainly alters the expression of the corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) receptors and some\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593 3 of 22\nglutamate receptor subunits, intermittent alcohol exposure during adolescence results in a dysregulation of 2-AG signaling and an increase of the expression of some glutamate receptor subunits. Moreover, we do not find a synergism effect on anxiety-like behaviors following the combination of acute restraint stress and alcohol consumption [31]. For a better understanding of the isolated and interactive effects of adolescent stress and alcohol consumption, the current study examined the long-term effects of repeated restraint stress and/or alcohol exposure. To this end, adolescent male Wistar rats were exposed to repeated restraint stress for five consecutive days and/or intermittent alcohol exposure using a bingelike procedure as previously described [31] to evaluate the separate and combined effects on anxiety-like behaviors and the expression of genes encoding the main components of the ECS and some subunits of receptors of the glutamatergic system in the medial PFC (mPFC) and the amygdala of young male adult rats. These brain regions play a role in the regulation of anxiety and emotion, and in the regulation of reward and addictive-related behaviors [32]. In addition, we also analyzed the effects on the mRNA expression of other signaling systems related to anxiety and stress (e.g., CRH and neuropeptide Y (NPY)) in the amygdala of young male adult rats."

After the adolescent alcohol/saline exposure, rats were left undisturbed in their home-cages before performing behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors and spontaneous motor activity two weeks later into withdrawal (i.e., a time point of withdrawal without physical symptoms).\n2.2.3. Determination of Blood Ethanol Concentration All the rats in the alcohol and saline subgroups were tail bled 1 h after the last day of the first week and the last exposure to alcohol or saline. Blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 2000\u00d7 g for 15 min to obtain plasma. Plasma was assayed for the determination of BEC using the alcohol oxidase method with an AM1 Alcohol Analyser (Analox Instruments, London, UK).\nFigure 1. Experimental design of the study.

Elevated Plus-Maze\nTwo weeks after the last alcohol/saline exposure (PND76), anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated using the elevated plus-maze as previously described [33]. The apparatus was made of opaque plastic and was composed of two oppositely positioned open arms (45 \u00d7 10 cm), two oppositely positioned closed arms of the same size and 50 cm high walls. The arms were connected by a central and neutral area (10 \u00d7 10 cm). The entire apparatus was elevated 75 cm above a white floor and exposed to an illumination of 70 lux. At the beginning, rats were placed in the center of the maze, facing an open arm, and were allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. The number of entries (an arm entry was defined as all four paws in the arm zone) and the time spent in each arm were scored using a video monitor. The number of entries into the closed arms (expressed as number of entries into the closed arms), the percent of entries into the open arms (number of entries into the open arms/total entries \u00d7 100) and the percent of time spent in the open arm (time spent in the open arms/total time \u00d7 100) were calculated.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593 5 of 22"

            "text": "We have recently reported that both an acute restraint stress episode and excessive alcohol consumption during adolescence result in an adult phenotype characterized by anxiety-like behaviors and high plasma levels of corticosterone, but this common anxious phenotype is associated with different disturbances in the amygdala circuits [31]. Interestingly, after the repeated restraint stress, the rats exposed to restraint stress displayed lower body weight gain than the non-stressed rats. In agreement with that, previous studies have reported stress-induced reductions in body weight gain in rodents [35\u201338].\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593 17 of 22\nChanges in body weight gain may be considered as an index of the physiological effects of the stressor; in fact, there was a recovery after finishing the restraint period, and differences in body weight gain were not observed during alcohol exposure between the stressed and non-stressed rats in the following weeks. In the present study, we have investigated the long-term effects of repeated restraint stress and intermittent alcohol exposure during adolescence on anxiety-like behaviors and the mRNA expression of the main components of the relevant signaling systems involved in the modulation of reward and anxiety/stress responses in the amygdala and the mPFC of male Wistar rats. In adulthood (PND76), all groups of rats underwent behavioral testing on the EPM. We found that chronic restraint stress or intermittent alcohol exposure resulted in increased anxiety-like behaviors compared with control rats, but no differences in spontaneous motor activity. These results support the idea that adolescent stress as well as excessive alcohol consumption can have enduring effects and can shape future behaviors, resulting in a high-anxiety phenotype in adulthood. Our results are consistent with previous reports of increased anxiety-like behaviors in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress [10,39,40] or excessive alcohol consumption [31,33,41], and the combination of stress and alcohol did not induce higher anxiogenesis than those produced by chronic stress or alcohol individually, which suggests a ceiling effect [31]. While anxiety-like behaviors were associated with higher plasma corticosterone levels in rats exposed to alcohol, we did not observe alterations in this stress hormone in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress. By contrast, we have previously described that acute restraint stress induces a long-term increase in plasma corticosterone levels [31]. The present results may suggest a habituation of the neuroendocrine response after chronic restraint stress. In this regard, previous studies have reported that the corticosterone response is blunted in rodents after repeated exposure to the same stressor [42,43], and the exposure to chronic homotypic stressors given at predictable intervals may produce habituation [8]. Moreover, adolescent rodents exposed to a chronic stress display a higher corticosterone level immediately after cessation of the stressor, but a rapid recovery to baseline levels [44]. During adolescence, many brain areas are known to undergo functional and structural reorganization. Among the primary structures involved in stress, emotional regulation, motivation and reward, are the mPFC and the amygdala, which are vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress and alcohol exposure [45]. The ECS is widely expressed in both brain regions [46], and this system is also undergoing dynamic changes during adolescence [47,48]. Thus, some alterations of these processes of maturation during this crucial period may result in enduring consequences, including alterations in emotional behaviors and stress sensitivity."

            "text": "Previous studies from our group have described a general deficit in the gene expression of the ECS in the amygdala of rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence [33,41]. In accordance with these previous studies, the present results showed similar neuroadaptations of the ECS in response to an intermittent alcohol exposure during adolescence. However, we observed an upregulation of the mRNA expression of Cnr2 that may be associated with alcohol-induced neuroinflammation [49]. In fact, CB2R receptors are found in microglia and astrocytes in the CNS [50], and these receptors are upregulated under neuroinflammatory conditions [51]. Rats exposed to early repeated restraint stress also displayed a general deficit in the gene expression of the amygdalar ECS, but an increase in the mRNA expression of Cnr2. Numerous studies have reported the effects of the stress on the ECS [for review see [20]], but these effects depend on many factors, including the brain region, the type of stressor or the chronicity of the stress. Finally, the combination of repeated restraint stress and alcohol consumption did not produce a synergism effect on the mRNA expression of the main components of the ECS in the amygdala, which suggests an overall ceiling effect. The present results suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure and an early repeated stress produce long-term changes in the gene expression of the main\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593 18 of 22\ncomponents of the ECS. These changes could produce neuroadaptive modifications in amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling that may be associated with the development of negative responses, such as anxiety-like behaviors. However, a main limitation of this study is that we have not yet examined the protein expression of the different components of the ECS, and it is difficult to ascertain whether the alterations in the mRNA expression are directly related to changes in protein levels or enzymatic activity, given that there are numerous posttranscriptional and translational mechanisms that would need to be considered. Moreover, because endocannabinoids act as retrograde messengers, the mRNA transcripts and the proteins are not localized in the same brain nuclei in projection neurons. Therefore, the association between changes in the gene expression and the protein expression, and activity of these enzymes should be addressed in future research. For a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the long-term effects of repeated restraint stress and/or adolescent alcohol exposure, we also evaluated the alterations of the gene expression of some glutamate receptor subunits in the amygdala of these animals. Overall, we found that both stress and alcohol produced changes in the mRNA expression of glutamate receptor subunits. In agreement with our previous report [31], the present results provide new evidence of the hyperactivity of glutamatergic signaling in the amygdala that may be associated with an inefficient inhibitory function of the ECS and may contribute to the anxious phenotype exhibited by these animals. Interestingly, there were significant interaction effects between repeated restraint stress and alcohol exposure on the gene expression of the subunits of NMDA receptors, with decreased mRNA expression of Grin1 and increased mRNA expression of Grin2B. The NMDA receptors are involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, and variations in the subunit composition may affect their function [52]. Therefore, our results suggest that the combination of an early repeated restraint stress and alcohol exposure during adolescence might modify the glutamate transmission through alterations in the composition of NMDA receptors. Because both CRH and NPY signaling systems are involved in the regulation of the stress responses, we also analyzed their mRNA expression in the amygdala of these rats. We found that alcohol exposure induced a decrease in the mRNA expression of Crh, but an increase in the mRNA expression of its receptor. As mentioned previously, these alterations in the gene expression may not be related to similar changes in protein levels. However, these results suggest an increase in the signaling mediated by CRH that may be associated to anxiogenic-like behaviors. In agreement with that, we have previously described an increase in the protein expression of CRHR1 in the amygdala of rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence [31]. Regarding the NPY system, we found a decrease in the mRNA levels of Npy and its receptor in alcohol-exposed rats. This decrease may also be associated to the anxiety state exhibited by these rats [33]. Unlike alcohol exposure, repeated restraint induced a slight decrease in the mRNA expression of Crh, Crhr1 and Npy, but no changes on the mRNA levels of Npy1r. Moreover, the combination of stress and alcohol did not produce different alterations to those produced by stress or alcohol alone. These results provide new evidence of the existence of different mechanistic pathways involved in the anxious phenotype associated with stress and/or alcohol exposure."

This is supported by the present results because the mRNA expression of many components of the ECS was increased in non-stressed rats exposed to alcohol in comparison with control rats two weeks after the last alcohol exposure. These results suggest a long-term potentiation of endocannabinoid signaling in the mPFC by increasing the production of endocannabinoids, which might be associated with the homeostatic role of this system in response to the withdrawal-induced negative-affective states [20,53,54]. In addition, the increase in the mRNA expression of Ppara and Napepld also suggests an increase in the signaling\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 593 19 of 22\nmediated by other non-cannabinoid N-acylethanolamines (e.g., oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide) that are involved in neuroprotection [55,56]. Contrarily to the effects observed in rats exposed to alcohol without restraint stress, we did not find many significant alterations on the mRNA expression of the ECS in the mPFC of young adult rats exposed to early repeated restraint stress. Interestingly, we observed that the combination of stress and alcohol produced different effects to those produced by stress or alcohol separately. In the present study, rats exposed to stress and alcohol displayed a decrease in the mRNA expression of the main components of the ECS in the mPFC. These long-term alterations in the endocannabinoid signaling might be relevant in the modulation of reward and behavioral processes. For example, the ECS plays a protective role against the development of anhedonia after chronic stress [20], therefore a deficiency in endocannabinoid signaling after a combination of stress and alcohol may result in an impairment to reward sensitivity or anhedonia. Finally, we also found that both stress and alcohol produced changes in the mRNA expression of glutamate receptor subunits in this brain region. However, we observed that the combination of repeated restraint stress and alcohol consumption did not produce different effects on the glutamatergic system than those produced by chronic stress or alcohol individually."

However, while rats exposed to intermittent alcohol displayed high plasma corticosterone levels, we did not observe alterations of this hormone in the stressed animals, which suggests habituation after repeated restraint stress. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that these long-term effects on emotional behaviors were associated with different alterations in the mRNA expression of proteins related to the ECS and other signaling systems, such as the glutamatergic, CRH and NPY systems, in the amygdala and the mPFC (an overall summary is shown in Table S2). The present study provides new evidence of the existence of partially different mechanisms by which an early repeated stress, adolescent alcohol exposure or the combination of both lead to maladaptive changes in emotional behaviors. However, we are aware that this study has an important limitation because female rats were not included. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to elucidate sex differences in the mechanisms that regulate stress responses and anxiety-like behaviors after early exposures to stressful events.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biomedicines10030593/s1, Table S1: Primer references for TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems).
