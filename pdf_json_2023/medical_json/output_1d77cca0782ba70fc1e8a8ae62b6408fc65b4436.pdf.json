The most widely used tests are lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Ag assays have also been developed. The number of commercially available SARSCoV-2 Ag detection tests has increased rapidly, as has the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best-practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is an update to the third in a series of frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by the IDSA. IDSA\u2019s goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and nonmedical settings. A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. A review of relevant, peer-reviewed published literature was conducted through 1 April 2022. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel made 10 diagnostic recommendations that address Ag testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and assess single versus repeat testing strategies. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Ag test sensitivity is dependent on the presence or absence of symptoms and, in symptomatic patients, on timing of testing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive Ag results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to those of laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection of specimens for testing yields similar results. Modeling suggests that repeat Ag testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available to inform this question. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing helps identify individuals with SARSCoV-2 infection. Data were insufficient to make a recommendation about the utility of Ag testing to guide release of patients with COVID-19 from isolation. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.\nKeywords.

Laboratory-based Ag test platforms also exist, but experience with their performance and utility is limited. The main advantage of POC testing is the rapid availability of results, which facilitates isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and potential treatment decisions. Given the recent expansion of the literature on diagnostic testing along with widespread adoption of Ag testing, particularly outside of healthcare settings, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has updated evidence-based guidelines for the use of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests.\nThe overall specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests was 99% or higher compared with standard nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT; ie, rapid reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] or laboratory-based NAAT) (Supplementary Figure 2B). Therefore, routine confirmation of positive Ag results by a reference molecular method is not necessary in most settings. In contrast, Ag test sensitivity was low or moderate and was dependent on the presence or absence of COVID-19 symptoms and the time of testing after symptom onset. Pooled Ag test sensitivity was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78% to 84%) for symptomatic individuals (Supplementary Figure 2A) and 89% (95% CI: 83% to 93%) if testing occurred within the first 5 days of illness (Supplementary Figure 3A); after 5 days, sensitivity fell to 54% (Supplementary Figure 4A). Testing patients within 3 days of symptom onset yielded results similar to testing within 5 days; studies reporting results of testing of patients within 1 or 2 days of symptoms were not identified. Among asymptomatic individuals, the pooled sensitivity of Ag testing was 63% (Supplementary Figure 12A). Antigen tests performed similarly in adults and children, although data on children were limited (Supplementary Figures 13A and 13B).\nDespite the widespread use of Ag testing to guide individual attendance at school, work, and large social gatherings, the panel identified no clinical trials or observational studies that directly informed these testing applications, and so it was unable to make recommendations about Ag testing in these situations. Similarly, the panel found no clinical trials or observational studies that compared the risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV2 from patients who were released from isolation based on time from symptom onset versus results of an Ag test. Therefore, the panel was unable to make a recommendation about the utility of Ag testing to guide discontinuation of isolation.\nSince no empirical data were identified to inform the value of serial versus single sample testing compared with molecular testing, results of serial testing were estimated using mathematical modeling; results of this analysis suggested that repeat testing would improve sensitivity (Note: On 11 August 2022, the FDA issued recommendations for repeat Ag testing to diagnose COVID-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic persons;\nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/ home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-falsenegative-results-fda-safety#:\u223c:text=Currently%2C%20all%20 at%2Dhome%20COVID,t%20have%20COVID%2D19%20 symptoms. This recommendation was based on publication of a preprint that reported improved sensitivity of rapid Ag testing compared with a composite nucleic acid amplification reference standard when asymptomatic study participants tested 3 times at 48-hour intervals and symptomatic study participants tested 2 times within 48 hours; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/35982680/). Other evidence gaps included the performance of Ag tests in vaccinated individuals or those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Very limited data were available on the performance of Ag tests in immunocompromised patients (although the literature review excluded studies that included only immunocompromised individuals), or in individuals infected with recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the literature search conducted through April 2022, the panel identified only 1 study that included persons tested after November 2021, the time during which Omicron variants emerged and became dominant. All studies compared Ag with molecular test results, with none using a clinical reference standard.\nSpecific recommendations and comments related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with FDA-EUA status are summarized below. An algorithm based on these recommendations is provided to aid in decision making (Figure 1). A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary, and rationales that support each recommendation, as well as unmet research needs, can be found online in the full text.\nBriefly, an expert panel consisting of clinicians, medical microbiologists, and methodologists critically appraised the SARS-CoV-2 Ag diagnostic literature using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to assess the certainty of evidence. Per GRADE, recommendations are categorized as \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cconditional.\u201d The word \u201crecommend\u201d indicates a strong recommendation and \u201csuggest\u201d indicates a conditional recommendation. This guideline assumed availability of rapid Ag testing and focuses on testing for diagnosis and asymptomatic screening.\nGiven the superior sensitivity of molecular diagnostics, the panel suggests using standard NAAT over Ag tests if standard NAAT is available and results of testing will be timely. The panel recognizes the value of diagnosing COVID-19 quickly, since treatment options are typically approved for administration within 5 days of symptom onset. In addition, rapid isolation of contagious patients is expected to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Therefore, rapid Ag testing has value when timely NAAT is unavailable, especially when results are positive; the high specificity of Ag testing means that positive results are actionable without needing confirmation. In contrast, negative Ag results should be confirmed by standard NAAT when clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is high. Ultimately, deciding\n2 \u2022 CID \u2022 Hayden et al\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad032/7005394 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nwhether to use rapid Ag tests in lower-risk, nonmedical settings will depend on several factors, including the prevalence of disease in the population, combined with assessment of the value of detecting true SARS-CoV-2 infection versus the detrimental effects of erroneous results (ie, falsely negative or positive results). Feasibility of test implementation and costs of testing are other important considerations.\nRecommendation 1: For symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19, the IDSA panel recommends a single Ag test over no test.

            "text": "Making a rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an essential component of comprehensive mitigation strategies aimed at curtailing COVID-19. Standard NAAT, defined throughout this document as rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAATs, is considered the reference method for diagnosing symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, over the course of the pandemic, especially early on, molecular diagnostic test shortages and delayed test turnaround times plagued testing initiatives in many locations. Currently, multiple pharmacologic therapies for COVID-19 have EUA from the US FDA for use within the first 5 days of symptoms, justifying the need for rapid, accurate test results.\nCommercially available, rapid Ag tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins have helped to address the ongoing need for widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing. While Ag-based assays for respiratory viruses are generally less sensitive than reference molecular methods, Ag tests can be easier and faster to perform, and these assays are typically less expensive than NAAT. In addition, rapid Ag testing can be easily deployed outside of clinic or hospital settings, with analysis performed by nonmedical staff. Table 1 compares the advantages and limitations of Ag testing versus NAAT.\nAs of September 2022, 51 SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests have received EUA from the FDA [1]. SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests use monoclonal antibodies to capture and detect viral proteins in respiratory secretions obtained with a nasopharyngeal, midturbinate, or nasal swab. On 23 September 2021, the FDA revised the EUAs of certain Ag tests to require manufacturers to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations on their test\u2019s performance, and to update their authorized labeling accordingly [1]. Depending on the manufacturer, Ag test swabs may either be analyzed directly or placed in an approved transport media or other fluid for testing. Currently available SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests come in a variety of formats, including rapid lateral flow assays (LFAs) and other types of immunoassays. Lateral flow assays are the most used method for SARS-CoV-2 Ag detection and are amendable to testing at the POC. In addition, several SARS-CoV-2 LFAs have received EUA designation for home testing. Lateral flow assays are configured as single-use test strips with results read either visually or by an instrument in approximately 15 minutes. Other\nimmunoassay designs may require instrumentation or procedural steps that must be performed in a clinical laboratory by laboratory-trained staff, with results typically generated in under 1 hour of instrument run time.\nMost SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with EUA status are labeled for testing symptomatic individuals who are suspected of having COVID-19, but an increasing number of tests are labeled for postexposure screening of asymptomatic persons [1]. Most Ag tests have indications for use within the first 5, 7, 12, or 14 days of symptom onset, depending on the test. Antigen testing is also being used for surveillance purposes (ie, testing asymptomatic individuals with no known or suspected exposure to a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services exercised enforcement discretion to allow the use of all Ag tests in asymptomatic individuals for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Depending on the indication for testing, Ag testing may also be completed once (single test) or performed sequentially over time (repeated tests) [2].\nGiven the broad range of uses of Ag tests and the rapidly growing number of published studies focused on Ag testing, the IDSA convened an expert panel to systematically review the SARS-CoV-2 Ag diagnostic test literature with a focus on assays with EUA status. The panel compared pooled estimates of test accuracy to make evidence-based recommendations for best use in clinical practice. This guide assumes ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the availability of EUA-designated Ag tests but does not address use for public health surveillance."

For each test, we extracted sampling sites, sampling method (healthcare worker, self, or supervised self-collection), use of transport media (vs dry swabs or direct testing), location of sample collection (eg, ambulatory, hospital-based, field), the target Ag, and the test platform (eg, lateral flow). We also recorded whether the same specimen was used for Ag and NAAT testing; whether the same site was used for both tests (when different specimens were used); whether the specimen for 1 test was obtained before the other systematically (eg, Ag swabs always collected first); whether there was a time gap between collection of specimens (eg, a specimen for NAAT collected on admission followed by a specimen for Ag testing collected a few days later); and whether the sample was collected from the right, left, or both sides when laterality is possible (eg, nasal swabs), alongside the timing of specimen collection relative to symptom onset.\nFor each study, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic index test and used the Clopper\u2013Pearson method to estimate 95% CIs.

To pool accuracy estimates for analyses including fewer than 5 studies, we fit a fixed-effects model as implemented in the meta package in R (version 4.1.2). We used forest plots to plot individual and summary estimates and conducted subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity.\nFor repeat testing, we included studies that reported outcomes of repeat testing on people with COVID-19.\nThis guideline assumes the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 as a result of exposure in a community, household, or facility. To determine the prevalence of infection for each PICO question, we considered published literature in consultation with clinical experts. Prevalence, as defined by the results of surveillance NAAT testing over the last 14 days in each community, has been shown to change over time. For purposes of the guideline, we applied 1%, 5%, and 10% pretest probability for asymptomatic cases and used 5%, 20%, to 50% pretest probability for symptomatic patients\u2014that is, those with at least 1 of the common symptoms of COVID-19. These pretest probabilities were chosen based on the prevalence of SARS-COV-2 reported by the CDC and other sources at different times during the pandemic [4]. Instances of higher pretest probability include symptomatic patients, residence in a community with high prevalence, and/or a person living in a household or with continued contact with someone with confirmed COVID-19 within the antecedent 14 days. For comparative purposes, the diagnostic accuracy of rapid RT-PCR and laboratory-based NAAT from 5 studies that used a composite reference standard was used as a reference standard against which to compare the performance of Ag testing [5\u20139] (Supplementary Figure 10). The performance of NAAT in each of these 5 studies was compared against a composite reference standard composed of at least 2 other NAATs."

Therefore, the panel relied on diagnostic test accuracy data to inform this recommendation. The reference standard in the included studies was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT).\nWe identified 65 studies [15\u201378] that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Ag testing as compared with NAAT as a reference test in symptomatic individuals (Table 2).

We conducted subgroup analyses based on time since symptom onset (ie, \u22643 days vs >3 days, \u22645 days vs >5 days, and \u22647 days vs >7 days). Additional subgroup analyses were performed based on different age groups (ie, adult vs pediatric patients). Overall and subgroup test accuracy data for symptomatic patients are reported in Supplementary\nFigures 2\u20139. Pooled diagnostic test accuracy measures did not differ in any subgroup or sensitivity analysis except for assessment of time post\u2013symptom onset, with reduced sensitivity of Ag testing after 5 or 7 days of symptoms. Studies did not separately report the effect of immunocompromised status, vaccination, or prior COVID-19 on diagnostic accuracy. We searched for studies that stated that they had included SARS-CoV-2 variants, and also attempted to infer inclusion of variants by date of specimen collection. Only 1 study was found; it reported reduced sensitivity for detection of Omicron versus Delta variants for several rapid Ag tests [79]. We were also unable to identify studies that compared the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus no testing.\nWe analyzed diagnostic test accuracy for specimens collected from patients before and after 3, 5, and 7 days of symptoms. Three days was chosen because of concern that Ag tests had lower sensitivity when used soon after development of symptoms; we were unable to identify studies that reported testing specimens collected only on the first or second day of symptoms. Five days was chosen because several COVID-19 treatments have EUA to begin therapy within 5 days of symptoms. Seven days was chosen because many Ag tests evaluated received EUA for use within 7 days of symptom onset.\nThe pooled sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 78% to 84%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%). The certainty of the evidence was moderate for sensitivity due to unexplained inconsistency of reported test performance, even for the same Ag test, same specimen source, and similar time from symptom onset. The certainty of evidence was high for specificity.\nFor the subset of patients who were symptomatic for less than or equal to 5 days, 8 studies were included [31, 33, 35, 37, 54, 64, 66, 68], with 584 positive and 2092 negative results, based on standard NAAT. The pooled sensitivity for this group was 89% (95% CI: 83% to 93%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%). The certainty of the evidence was moderate for sensitivity due to unexplained inconsistency and high for specificity (Table 3). Results for the subset of patients who were symptomatic for less than or equal to 3 days were similar (ie, we did not observe a reduction in sensitivity or specificity compared with standard NAAT) (Supplementary\nFigure 7). For the subset of patients tested more than 5 days after symptom onset, 15 studies were included, with 1076 positive and 4933 negative patients, based on standard NAAT. The pooled\nsensitivity for this group was 54% (95% CI: 44% to 64%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%) (Supplementary Figures 4A). The certainty of the evidence was low for sensitivity due to unexplained inconsistency and high for specificity. Results of analysis of specimens collected more than 7 days after symptom onset were similar to results of specimens collected more than 5 days after symptom onset (Table 4)."

            "text": "The panel assumed that diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients has benefits for both individuals and for the community. Establishing SARS-CoV-2 as the etiology of an individual\u2019s symptoms can influence decisions about initiation of therapy and isolation in those who are infected, and about contact tracing and quarantine. Sensitivity of a single Ag test is dependent on timing of testing relative to symptom onset, with higher sensitivity earlier in the course of symptomatic infection. The false-negative rate of Ag testing performed within 5 days of symptom onset ranged from 5 (range: 3 to 8) patients per 1000 patients tested at a prevalence of 5%, to 55 (range: 35 to 85) patients per 1000 patients tested at a prevalence of 50%. As noted above, results of single Ag testing within 3 days of symptom onset were similar to results of testing within 5 days of symptom onset, but the panel was unable to locate reports of testing on day 1 or 2 after symptom onset. Antigen testing of symptomatic individuals after 5 days of symptoms demonstrated a much lower sensitivity of 54% (95% CI: 44% to 64%), with almost equal numbers of true-positive and falsenegative results. False-negative results can lead to failure to treat symptomatic patients in whom treatment is indicated, potentially leading to poorer patient outcomes. False-negative results can also lead to failure to isolate an infected person or to quarantine close contacts, potentially increasing the risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Because of these potential patient harms, a negative result in someone with continued suspicion for COVID-19 should be confirmed promptly with a standard NAAT.\nIn contrast, specificity of Ag testing remained close to 100% regardless of time from symptom onset. Currently available therapies are recommended to be started within 5 days of symptoms. Antigen testing during this time yielded almost no false-positive results, even if the prevalence of COVID-19 was as low as 5% (0 false-positive results; range: 0 to 9 falsepositive results per 1000 patients tested). This suggests that Ag testing within the first 5 days of symptom onset yields actionable results in symptomatic patients who test positive and qualify for treatment. The high specificity of Ag testing makes the risk of inappropriate treatment due to a false-positive result very low.\nFew studies reported on symptomatic pediatric patients, but the available data indicated an overall sensitivity comparable to that in adults (80%; 95% CI: 74% to 86%), with overall\n10 \u2022 CID \u2022 Hayden et al\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad032/7005394 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nTa bl\ne 2.\nG\nRA D\nE Ev\nid en\nce P\nro fil\ne of\nT es\nt A cc\nur ac\ny Re\nsu lts\nfo r P\nre va\nle nc\ne/ Pr\nete\nst P\nro ba\nbi lit\ny of\n5 %\n, 2 0%\n, a nd\n5 0%\n, f or\nS ym\npt om\nat ic\nP at\nie nt\ns O\nve ra\nll w\nith N\nuc le\nic A\nci d\nA m\npl ifi\nca tio\nn Te\nst in\ng as\nth e\nre fe\nre nc e st an da rd\nO ve\nra ll\npe rf\nor m\nan ce\no f\nan tig\nen t\nes tin\ng\nS en\nsi tiv\nity\n.8 1\n(9 5%\nC I:\n.7 8\nto .8\n4)\nS pe\nci fic\nity\n1. 00\n(9 5%\nC I:\n.9 9\nto 1\n.0 0)\nO ut\nco m\ne N\no. o\nf S\ntu di\nes\n(N o.\no f\nP at\nie nt\ns)\nS tu\ndy D\nes ig\nn\nFa ct\nor s\nTh at\nM ay\nD ec\nre as\ne C\ner ta\nin ty\no f\nE vi\nde nc\ne E\nff ec\nt pe\nr 10\n00 P\nat ie\nnt s\nTe st\ned\nTe st\nA\ncc ur\nac y\nC oE\nR\nis k\nof B\nia s\nIn di\nre ct\nne ss\nIn\nco ns\nis te\nnc y\nIm pr\nec is\nio n\nP ub\nlic at\nio n\nB ia\ns\nP re\nte st\nP\nro ba\nbi lit\ny of\n5%\na\nP re\nte st\nP\nro ba\nbi lit\ny of\n20\n% a\nP re\nte st\nP\nro ba\nbi lit\ny of\n50\n% a\nTr ue\np os\niti ve\ns (p\nat ie\nnt s\nw ith\nC\nO V\nID -1\n9)\n65 S\ntu di\nes\n(2 0\n27 2\npa tie\nnt s)\nC oh\nor t\nan d\nca se\n-c on\ntr ol\n\u2013t yp e st ud ie s\nN ot\ns er\nio us\nb\nN ot\ns er\nio us\nc S\ner io\nus d\nN ot\ns er\nio us\nN\non e\n41 (3\n9 to\n4 2)\n16\n2 (1\n56 t\no 16\n8)\n40 5\n(3 90\nt o\n42 0)\n\u2295\n\u2295 \u2295\n\u25ef\nM od\ner at\ne\nFa ls\ne ne\nga tiv\nes (p\nat ie\nnt s\nin co\nrr ec\ntly c\nla ss\nifi ed\na s\nno t\nha vi\nng C\nO V\nID -1\n9)\n9 (8\nt o\n11 )\n38 (3\n2 to\n4 4)\n95\n(8 0\nto 1\n10 )\nTr ue\nn eg\nat iv\nes\n(p at\nie nt\ns w\nith ou\nt C\nO V\nID -1\n9)\n65 S\ntu di\nes\n(5 1\n06 3\npa tie\nnt s)\nC oh\nor t\nan d\nca se\n-c on\ntr ol\n\u2013t yp e st ud ie s\nN ot\ns er\nio us\nb\nN ot\ns er\nio us\nc N\not s\ner io\nus\nN ot\ns er\nio us\nN\non e\n95 0\n(9 41\nto 9\n50 )\n80 0\n(7 92\nt o\n80 0)\n50\n0 (4\n95 t\no 50\n0)\n\u2295 \u2295\n\u2295 \u2295\nH\nig h\nFa ls\ne po\nsi tiv\nes (p\nat ie\nnt s\nin co\nrr ec\ntly c\nla ss\nifi ed\na s\nha vi\nng\nC O\nV ID\n-1 9)\n0 (0\nt o\n9)\n0 (0\nt o\n8)\n0 (0\nt o\n5)\na W e\nus ed\na p\nre te\nst p\nro ba\nbi lit\ny of\n5 %\nto re\npr es\nen t l\now c\nom m\nun ity\np re\nva le\nnc e\nan d\nus ed\na 2\n0% a\nnd 5\n0% p\nre te\nst p\nro ba\nbi lit\ny fo\nr c as\nes o\nf m ed\niu m\nto h\nig h\nco m\nm un\nity p\nre va\nle nc\ne, k\nno w\nn cl\nos e\nco nt\nac t o\nr d ur\nin g\nou tb\nre ak\ns.

For example, it is plausible that a young, vaccinated, otherwise healthy, symptomatic adult who is not eligible for treatment and who chooses to isolate without a diagnostic confirmation would not need testing. The imperfect correlation between positive SARS-CoV-2 culture and Ag test results also precludes using a positive Ag test result to predict infectiousness. Still, while a negative Ag test result does not exclude infectiousness, a positive result makes infectiousness more likely."

Negative Ag tests have lower negative-predictive values to rule out COVID-19 infection. Individuals with a negative Ag test result who remain symptomatic and for whom an alternative diagnosis has not been established should undergo prompt testing for SARS-CoV-2 using standard NAAT.\nQuestions remain regarding the impact that variant strains, immunocompromised host status, vaccination, and/or prior COVID-19 may have on the analytical accuracy of Ag tests, including optimal specimen source (eg, anterior nares vs throat) and timing of testing (eg, sensitivity of Ag testing on day 1 or 2 of symptoms) [80]. The performance of antigen testing in very young children (eg, <6 months of age) is also poorly understood. This is especially notable since these individuals cannot mask and are not eligible for receipt of currently available COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe panel identified a few studies [81\u201384] that reported better positive percent agreement between Ag testing and viral culture than between standard NAAT and viral culture but identified no empirical evidence that informed the question of whether Ag test results predict infectiousness, as measured by transmission. Further, the IDSA panel found no empirical evidence to support the use of Ag test results to guide release of patients with COVID-19 from isolation. Given the consequences of this widespread practice, including cost, studies to identify a marker of infectivity are needed. Ensuring equal access to accurate, affordable, and timely SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic\ntesting for underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minority groups, should be a priority [84]."

To calculate standard NAAT diagnostic test accuracy, we pooled results from 5 studies [85\u201389] that reported a comparison of standard NAAT results to a composite reference standard (Supplementary Figure 10). This analysis yielded a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%).\nWe summarized the evidence for overall symptomatic (any day after symptom onset) (Table 2), less than or equal to 5 days after symptom onset (Table 3), and more than 5 days after symptom onset (Table 4). Additional subgroups included the following: less than or equal to 7 days after symptom onset (Supplementary Figure 5) and more than 7 days after symptom onset (Supplementary Figure 6). The more than 5 day cutoff was chosen because several commonly used COVID-19 therapies have EUA to begin treatment within the first 5 days of symptoms. The more than 7 day cutoff was chosen because many of the available rapid Ag tests have EUA for use within 7 days of symptom onset.\nFor comparative results, we included 70 studies\u201465 informing Ag testing [15\u201378, 90] and the 5 studies [85\u201389] discussed above that informed standard NAAT, with 20 621 positive and 51 593 negative results (Table 5). The pooled sensitivity for Ag testing was 81% (95% CI: 78% to 84%) and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 100% to 100%).

The patients included in the 5 studies of standard NAAT versus a composite reference standard were different from those who participated in the 65 studies of Ag testing versus standard NAAT; hence, the comparison of standard NAAT and Ag test performance was indirect, seriously reducing confidence in the certainty of the evidence. Certainty of the evidence was therefore low for sensitivity due to indirectness and unexplained inconsistency and low for specificity due to indirectness."

Standard NAAT has a higher sensitivity compared with a composite reference standard than does rapid Ag testing compared with standard NAAT. During a COVID-19 surge when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the community is high (ie, 50%) testing with a single Ag test resulted in 80 more falsenegative results per 1000 patients tested compared with a standard NAAT overall. If the Ag test were to be performed within 5 days of onset of symptoms, false-negative results decreased to 40 per 1000 patients tested, but if performed after 7 days of onset of symptoms, false-negative results increased to 215 per 1000 patients tested. During nonsurge periods when the community prevalence among symptomatic individuals is lower, the number of false-negative results is also relatively lower. At a prevalence of 20%, there were 16 more false-negative results per 1000 persons undergoing Ag testing within 5 days of symptom onset and 86 more false-negative results if Ag testing was done after 5 days of onset of symptoms. Therefore, a single Ag test can result in more false-negative results compared with a single standard NAAT.\nHowever, the panel also placed a high value on test availability and result timeliness. Obtaining a standard NAAT generally requires a visit to a testing site, and results may not be available for several days. This delay can push patients outside the antiviral treatment window, which is usually within 5 days of symptom onset. Long turnaround times for COVID-19 diagnostic tests can cause delays in isolation of infected patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of their close contacts, potentially allowing further COVID-19 transmission. Alternatively, long turnaround times for patients who ultimately test negative for COVID-19 may cause unnecessary home isolation and absence from work or school. In contrast to standard NAAT, Ag tests are often more available, results are reported usually within 15 minutes of testing, and Ag self-testing can be performed by patients at home. These considerations led the IDSA panel to suggest rapid Ag testing if results of standard NAAT will be delayed more than 1 day.\nAntigen testing has very high specificity, and a positive result is actionable immediately. Because of lower sensitivity, a negative Ag test result should be confirmed with a standard NAAT if clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains high. Especially in patients in whom treatment of COVID-19 would be indicated, Ag testing should be done within 5 days of symptom onset to minimize the number of false-negative results and to diagnose patients within the treatment eligibility window."

Federal government subsidization of Ag testing has evolved during the pandemic, with the federal government sometimes providing no-cost home test kits upon request. Insurance company reimbursement for home tests has also varied over time. Uninsured individuals may be able to access free at-home Ag test kits through programs sponsored by their local or state public health departments, through community programs and nonprofit organizations, and through Medicare-certified health clinics. These programs may serve households in rural areas and individuals belonging to underserved populations who traditionally experience barriers to accessing healthcare (although access to Ag testing was not assessed by the panel). Currently, both at the national and local levels, there is a strong public health effort to ensure continued access to testing and to use Ag testing as the primary testing modality given that it can be performed at home, requires minimal technical expertise, and is relatively inexpensive compared with standard NAAT."

Other factors that require investigation include optimal timing of detection of SARS-CoV-2 for different variants and in different specimen sources (eg, anterior nares vs throat) and the performance of Ag tests compared with multiplex molecular assays. Last, although difficult to design and implement, rigorously designed clinical trials comparing a single Ag test with standard NAAT to assess both treatment and transmission outcomes would provide direct evidence to guide this recommendation.

For this reason, modeling analysis was performed using a repeat testing algorithm. Results of the modeling analysis were compared with standard NAAT diagnostic accuracy (Supplementary Figure 11A). For all comparisons, 5%, 20%, and 50% were used for the prevalence of SARS-COV-2 infection in the symptomatic population. The modeled sensitivity and specificity for Ag testing and repeat Ag testing (total of 2 Ag tests) within the first 5 days of symptoms were estimated as 98% (95% CI: 97% to 99%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively. For standard NAAT diagnostic test accuracy data, we pooled the results from 5 studies [85\u201389] that reported comparison of standard NAAT results to a composite reference standard (Supplementary Figure 10). This analysis yielded a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%). Comparing the 2 testing\nstrategies estimated 0 to 5 fewer false-negative results with repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT, depending on the disease prevalence. The modeled sensitivity and specificity for first Ag testing within the first 7 days of symptom onset and repeat testing after 7 days of symptom onset were 93% (95% CI: 89% to 96%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively. Comparing both modalities showed 2 to 20 more false-negative results per 1000 persons tested with repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT, depending on the prevalence of disease. The sensitivity and specificity for Ag testing and repeat Ag testing after the first 5 days of symptom onset were 75% (95% CI: 69% to 86%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively. Comparing both modalities showed 11 to 110 more false-negative results per 1000 persons tested with repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT, depending on the prevalence of COVID-19.\nThe certainty was very low and low for sensitivity and specificity, respectively, due to indirectness and inconsistency. Indirectness occurred because the results for consecutive Ag testing were based on a modeling analysis, whereas the standard NAAT results used as the comparator were based on primary patient data. Additionally, the comparison between repeat testing and standard NAAT testing was indirect due to different populations. There was serious unexplained inconsistency in the original single Ag test studies."

Delays in diagnosis of COVID-19 can deny affected patients with a positive test result potentially life-saving therapy and risk exposing others to SARS-CoV-2 because of delayed isolation of infected patients, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts. Alternatively, long turnaround times can prolong unnecessary isolation of individuals who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. While repeat Ag testing is potentially a faster option, by definition it means that an initial test is negative but the person may still be infected."

Finally, in persons with prior COVID-19 infection, the timing between the first and potential subsequent infection bears consideration as a test could remain positive from prior infection if it occurred in the recent past and therefore not represent a new infection; the differential specificity of a standard NAAT versus Ag testing in this situation needs to be defined.

For example, a single test may be considered in situations where a positive test would lead to increased monitoring for symptoms and signs of infection in persons at high risk of serious COVID-19, or in outbreak settings where positive results would assist in decision making about isolation, quarantine, and contact tracing. \u2022 A negative Ag test result reduces the likelihood of infection. However, the longer the time since testing, the more this likelihood reduction wanes, especially early in infection when virus replication may be rapid.

Although a single positive Ag test result may theoretically help reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 if it triggers isolation of the person who tests positive, the panel found no evidence that the use of Ag tests reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. A negative Ag test result may provide false assurance of non-infectiousness. Users of rapid Ag tests may not understand the limits of a negative test result. In 1 study, two-thirds of participants believed that they were noninfectious the day following a negative rapid Ag test [105]. In addition, sensitivity is linked to timing of exposure; a negative test result may convert to positive within hours early in the course of infection [81, 83].\nThe panel considered a range of prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 infection, using standard NAAT as the reference standard. When the prevalence of SARS CoV-2 infection was 1%, the number of true-positive Ag test results was small and approximated the number of false-negative results (ie, 6 true positives and 4 false negatives per 1000 asymptomatic individuals tested) (Table 6).

Therefore, the panel relied on diagnostic test accuracy data to inform this recommendation. The reference standard in the studies included was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). For calculation of the standard NAAT reference standard, we pooled results from 5 studies [85\u201389] that compared standard NAAT results with a composite reference standard (Supplementary Figure 10). This comparison showed a pooled sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%). The IDSA panel considered 1%, 5%, and 10% as the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients with known exposure.

The patients who underwent standard NAAT were different from those who underwent Ag testing; hence, comparisons were indirect, reducing confidence in the certainty of the evidence.

In contrast, the specificity of Ag testing compared with standard NAAT is high, approaching 100% (Table 7). Therefore, the potential harm of using an Ag test instead of a standard NAAT is the potential for false-negative results. False-negative Ag test results are expected to be most harmful in high-risk settings such as healthcare settings, where failure to diagnose presymptomatic individuals before major elective surgery may increase patients\u2019 risk of adverse events in the perioperative period [107, 108]; of note, methodologic challenges and conduct of these studies before widespread COVID-19 vaccination may limit their current relevance [109]. False-negative results of SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing might also lead to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other patients, residents, and staff of hospitals or long-term care facilities, especially if infection-prevention practices such as masking are dependent on test results."

Standard NAATs will detect the larger number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a greater number of opportunities to prevent transmission compared with currently\navailable Ag tests, through targeted isolation of individuals who test positive, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts. The superior performance of standard NAAT is expected to have the greatest impact when the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in the community is moderate to high (ie, \u226510%). However, the use of less-sensitive rapid Ag tests may still be helpful in some lower prevalence settings when standard NAAT is not available. Antigen testing is expected to detect infection when viral load is high. Additionally, given the high specificity of Ag testing observed across studies of asymptomatic individuals, routine confirmation of positive results is not necessary in most situations. Large-scale studies evaluating the value of Ag versus RNA detection in relation to SARS-CoV-2 transmission events are needed, especially as vaccine coverage and the number of previously infected individuals increases. The development of new Ag tests with increased analytic sensitivity is of great interest."

The sensitivity and specificity of Ag testing and repeat testing were modeled and were found to be 86% (95% CI: 80% to 90%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively.

This showed a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI: 93% to 99%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96% to 100%). Comparing the 2 testing strategies, there were 1 to 11 more false-negative results per 1000 persons tested for repeat Ag testing compared with standard NAAT depending on disease prevalence.\nThe certainty of the evidence was very low for sensitivity and low for specificity, due to indirectness and inconsistency. Indirectness was due to the results being based on modeling analysis and not primary human testing data. Additionally, comparison between repeat testing and standard NAAT testing was indirect because the data used came from different populations. There was also serious unexplained inconsistency in the original single Ag testing results."

The other theoretical benefit would be to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but we were unable to identify studies of serial testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with molecular testing that included transmission as an outcome. Therefore, the analysis presented focuses on diagnostic test accuracy. The justification to perform testing of asymptomatic individuals in the general population after exposure is unclear. In congregate settings, such as nursing homes, incorporation of serial rapid Ag testing into a bundle of control measures during an outbreak may help identify individuals most likely to be contagious and guide isolation recommendations [82]. We identified one study that assessed serial testing as compared with isolation and showed noninferiority of testing for the prevention of transmission [112]. The available data did not inform the timing of NAAT or Ag testing following an exposure, or the timing of repeat Ag testing."

The IDSA panel\u2019s recommendation considered access and availability of standard NAAT testing, although arguably, in the scenario presented, timeliness of results would likely not be critical. If, for example, standard NAAT was not available on a weekend, it could be performed on a weekday if the exposed individual quarantined or took other measures to reduce the risk of onward transmission of infection while\nwaiting to be tested. Not all exposures are the same. For example, prolonged household exposures carry more transmission risk than do shorter non-household exposures [111, 114], with transmission risk also being influenced by the level of infectiousness of the person to whom the individual is exposed, the level of immunity in the exposed person (vaccination history, prior history of COVID-19 infection, and timing thereof), and the viral variant.\nThe following assumptions and remarks are important to state for this question addressing asymptomatic individuals:\n1. There are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n2. The IDSA COVID-19 Diagnostics Panel assumed that asymptomatic individuals are usually contagious at some point during the course of their infection.\n3. The IDSA panel assumed that there may be benefit in identifying asymptomatic individuals through testing.\n4. The panel found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic reduces risk of transmission."

            "text": "Published, peer-reviewed studies directly comparing 2 consecutive rapid Ag tests with a single standard NAAT in asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were lacking and are needed. Such studies should include special populations such as children, immunocompromised hosts, vaccinated, boosted, and unvaccinated populations, and those with and without prior COVID-19 infection, as well as those exposed to contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, in individuals with prior COVID-19 infection, the timing between the prior and subsequent infections bears consideration as a test could remain positive from the prior infection if it occurred in the recent past and therefore not represent a new infection; the differential specificity of a standard NAAT versus Ag testing in this situation needs to be defined. The ideal time interval between the repeat Ag tests also needs definition."

Therefore, a modeling analysis was performed using a repeat testing algorithm (2 consecutive Ag tests). Results of each test were considered to be independent, which might not be a valid assumption. For all comparisons, prevalences of 1%, 5%, and 10% SARS-CoV-2 infection were considered. The sensitivity and specificity of testing (2 consecutive repeat Ag tests) versus no testing, using standard NAAT as the reference standard, were 86% (95% CI: 80% to 90%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively. Comparing 2 repeated tests versus no testing showed 1 to 14 falsenegative results per 1000 patients tested, depending on disease prevalence.\nThe certainty of the evidence is very low and low for sensitivity and specificity, respectively, due to indirectness and inconsistency. Indirectness was due to the fact that the results were based on a modeling analysis and not primary human testing data. Additionally, the comparison between repeat testing and no testing was indirect because the data used came from different populations."

Some indirect evidence was identified that suggested possible benefit of serial testing. A large, cluster-randomized trial of English secondary schools and colleges found that daily Ag testing was noninferior to self-isolation in preventing secondary cases of COVID-19, with similar numbers of contacts testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in both study arms [112]. A retrospective cohort study of students at 18 colleges and universities in Connecticut, United States, reported that institutions that tested students more frequently detected more COVID-19 cases and prevented further spread [115]; in the fall of 2020, each additional test per student per week was associated with a decrease of 0.0014 cases per student per week (95% CI: \u2212.0028 to \u2212.00001)."

            "text": "This recommendation assumes widespread availability of Ag testing and does not take cost considerations into account. Furthermore, it is known that not all classroom or workplace settings are the same in terms of risk. Learning\nenvironments or workplace settings may range from small classrooms with young children to factory floors with closely packed, poorly ventilated workstations, to larger workplaces with distantly spaced worksites. In some workplaces, such as in the entertainment industry, there may be unique risks, such as those associated with close contact (including intimate contact) required for film/television production. The risk of exposure and viral transmission may also be related to the level of immunity in the exposed person (vaccination history, prior history of COVID-19 infection, and timing thereof), age and comorbid medical conditions, the timing of the exposure relative to disease onset in the index case, and the viral variant.\nThe IDSA panel recognizes that serial rapid Ag testing of students and employees is common, and that testing cadences vary, with common cadences being daily, twice weekly, or weekly Ag testing. We chose to model 2 consecutive rapid Ag tests. Performing additional rounds of testing would be expected to alter the performance characteristics of the testing strategy.\nEmployers may require serial testing of asymptomatic employees who decline SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Because actions of 1 subject could impact others in the same cohort, this might best be performed as a cluster-randomized trial. Variables such as prior vaccination and/or prior COVID-19 infection would need to be accounted for, as would circulating variants and underlying risk factors in the students/ employees. Outcomes of interest could include illness (including numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic), time away from school or work, healthcare encounters, hospitalizations, and deaths in study subjects and their contacts."

There were 86 positive and 601 negative results, based on standard NAAT. The sensitivity and specificity of rapid home Ag testing of these asymptomatic individuals were 41% (95% CI: 25% to 61%) and 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%), respectively. These sensitivity and specificity values were considered together with prevalence of COVID-19 of 1%, 5%, and 10% in an asymptomatic community population. The certainty of the evidence was very low and low for sensitivity and specificity, respectively, due to indirectness and imprecision. Indirectness occurred since patients undergoing home testing were not specifically the same population as those attending large gatherings. Imprecision was due to the low number of subjects in the study and the wide CIs."

The theoretical benefit to the population of testing before a large gathering is to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatically infected persons who might attend, particularly in settings where distancing is not possible or ventilation is poor, and community prevalence of asymptomatic infection is moderate to high (ie, >10%). However, we were unable to identify empirical evidence to support that Ag testing of asymptomatic individuals before a large gathering reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

If the gathering requires cost or logistics to attend, or is highly desirable to an individual, not being able to attend might be an incentive to not participate in testing or reporting thereof, or to inappropriately collect a sample, compromising test performance. In addition, Ag tests would either need to be purchased by or made available to those attending\nthe gathering, adding cost either way.

However, there is no empirical evidence to date that Ag testing reduces the risk of transmission. The question of the possible benefit of one-time testing before a large gathering might be answered using a cluster-randomized trial. Even such a trial could yield results that vary depending on local geography, vaccine coverage (including type, timing, and boosting), and history of prior COVID-19 infection among attendees and the local population (or the population attendees will return to after the gathering), characteristics of people attending the gathering (comorbidities, age), whether masking is used and what type, whether food is consumed, whether physical distancing is in place, whether the event is indoors or outdoors, levels of ventilation (for indoor sites), and the stage in the pandemic (eg, surges, waves, variants). Finally, the specific Ag test used might impact performance based on variability in test design and potential impact of the circulating viral variants [80].\nPoint-of-Care Versus Laboratory-Based Antigen Testing Recommendation 9: For individuals for whom Ag testing is desired, the IDSA panel suggests for either POC or laboratorybased Ag testing.

The outcome of interest was diagnostic test performance. The studies included a total of 2304 patients, 374 who tested positive and 1930 who tested negative based on standard NAAT (Table 8). We categorized the assays as POC versus laboratory-based assays based on the location where the test was completed, and results were interpreted. If the test was completed at the bedside immediately after specimen collection, it was considered as POC. If the test was completed after transport of a specimen to a laboratory, it was considered laboratory based.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of POC Ag testing were 63% (95% CI: 28% to 88%) and 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%), respectively (Supplementary Figure 14).

Since the included studies were conducted in mixed populations, we rated the strength of evidence downward for indirectness when the evidence was used to inform decisions about testing in symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals. Also, CIs for sensitivity were wide, and considering the lower versus the upper limits might lead to different clinical decisions. Therefore, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for imprecision.

Possible harms to patients or to the population might arise if home testing were associated with more technical errors, incorrect test interpretation, or failure to report results to public health or other relevant parties. Education of patients and the development of quick, easy ways to report results might mitigate these theoretical harms. The potential benefits and harms outlined here were not assessed in available studies.\nPoint-of-care Ag tests are now widely available for home or field use but testing multiple individuals simultaneously as part of large testing programs can be logistically challenging.

Eleven studies [5, 9, 22, 28, 39, 58, 59, 65, 122\u2013124] provided information on diagnostic test accuracy for observed specimen self-collection and 1 study [116] provided diagnostic test accuracy information for unobserved specimen selfcollection. There were 1570 positive and 17 196 negative patient results, based on standard NAAT. Only 101 positives and 723 negatives were from the study of unobserved self-collected specimens (Table 9).\nThe pooled sensitivity and specificity of Ag testing of observed self-collected specimens were 72% (95% CI: 59% to 82%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively (Supplementary Figure 16). The sensitivity and specificity for Ag testing of unobserved self-collected specimens from the single study of Ag testing of unobserved self-collected specimens in symptomatic patients were 63% (95% CI: 54% to 72%) and 100% (95% CI: 99% to 100%), respectively (Supplementary\nFigure 17). SARS-CoV-2 prevalences of 5%, 10%, and 20% were used to assess the impact of these performance characteristics in different populations of patients. Regardless of prevalence, there were more false-negative results when self-collection of specimens was unobserved compared with when it was observed.\nThe certainty of evidence was low for both sensitivity and specificity, due to indirectness. Indirectness was due to an absence of head-to-head comparisons of observed and unobserved specimen self-collection in symptomatic patients, which required the panel to compare observed and unobserved specimen self-collection in 2 populations of patients."

This may be a particular benefit to individuals in rural or other areas without convenient access to a testing facility, or to individuals who prefer to avoid healthcare facilities. Cost is another consideration; observed testing adds cost to patient care, either to the patient directly or to the healthcare system.\nThe potential harm of Ag testing overall is the risk of a falsenegative result. This can provide false assurance as to the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially facilitating spread of infection if an infected but undiagnosed person does not take measures to prevent transmission. If the infected person is symptomatic, a false-negative result might also result in failure to treat someone who would benefit from treatment. On the other hand, with appropriate understanding that a negative test does not rule out infection (and a recommendation for followup testing), such potential harms may be mitigated through the provision of detailed instructions (written materials,\nillustrations, videos) on specimen collection, test performance, and interpretation of results."

The specific Ag test used might impact diagnostic sensitivity based on variability in test design and potential impact on detection of viral variants [79, 80]. Finally, the reason for doing the testing might impact sensitivity in cases of unobserved self-collection (although arguably, this could occur with observed self-collection depending on the nature of the observation); if, for example, the desired endpoint is a negative result (eg, return to work or school, participation in a preferred activity), the quality of specimen collection may be purposely compromised."

The availability, simplicity, and relative low cost of rapid Ag tests have enabled expanded testing initiatives, particularly in nonmedical settings. Recent studies demonstrate that rapid SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests can be performed accurately, without the need for highly qualified laboratory personnel, in a variety of community locations such as pharmacies, nursing homes, and schools. Laboratory-based Ag testing is an alternative approach that allows for testing larger numbers of specimens at one time. However, the need for specimen transport to a centralized laboratory increases turnaround time for results. More performance data were available for rapid Ag test performance than for laboratory-based Ag tests, but the sensitivity and specificity of rapid POC versus laboratory-based Ag tests appear to be comparable (Supplementary Figures 14 and 15).\nAn important finding of this updated systematic review is the observation that rapid Ag tests have very high specificity.

Importantly, many of the studies included in our analysis used nonmedical staff to administer rapid Ag testing in the field. Unobserved self-collection of anterior nares specimens for testing appeared to yield comparable results to observed specimen collection, although no head-to-head comparisons of these 2 approaches were found. Whether the same accuracy can be achieved with self-testing at home, however, has yet to be definitively determined. Recent studies published after completion of the literature review for this guideline suggest that accuracy of Ag self-test interpretation may be poor but can be improved with patient education [125, 127]. Given the high specificity of EUA rapid Ag tests, routine confirmation of positive test results is not usually necessary; positive results can be used immediately to help guide treatment, isolation, and quarantine decisions. Even when the pretest probability or prevalence is low (ie, 1%), the number of false-positive Ag results is expected to be very small, on the order of 0\u201310 false-positive results per 1000 individuals tested (Table 6), regardless of the presence of symptoms or timing of testing relative to onset of illness. However, confirmation of positive Ag test results may be considered rarely on a case-by-case basis when the pretest probability or prevalence of infection is very low (ie, <1%) and/or if the impact of a potential false-positive result is deemed to be significant.\nCurrent EUA SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests are less sensitive than standard NAAT. Sensitivity differences were most apparent in comparisons across groups of symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals. The clinical sensitivity of Ag testing was highest (89%) (Supplementary Figure 2A) for symptomatic individuals tested early during the course of illness, the time when the viral load is expected to be highest. Test sensitivity dropped to 54% (Supplementary Figure 4A) after more than 5 days of symptoms. Some recent anecdotes and 1 carefully performed observational study [83] published after the literature search for this guideline was completed have reported lower Ag test sensitivity within the first day or 2 of symptoms, possibly related to specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and/or vaccination status of infected individuals. However, the IDSA panel was unable to identify studies that reported Ag test performance this early after symptom onset during the period of the literature review. The sensitivity of Ag testing within 3 days of symptoms onset was similar to sensitivity within 5 days of symptoms. Antigen test sensitivity during this time was again lower for asymptomatic individuals (63%) (Supplementary Figure 12A). Few studies reported on children with COVID-19. The overall sensitivity of Ag testing in symptomatic pediatric patients was 80% (95% CI: 74% to 86%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI: 97% to 100%), which are comparable to Ag test performance in symptomatic adults.\nThe isolation of replication-competent virus in culture has been used as a surrogate to infer the presence of infectious virus in a clinical sample. In the original IDSA guideline on Ag testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the panel analyzed the relation between Ag positivity and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 [84]. This observation supported the assertion that Ag testing should identify most culture-positive individuals, and by inference, this would be a group who would more likely be shedding infectious virus. However, the panel noted several important caveats to this interpretation. First, while culture-positive specimens were also likely to be Ag positive, culture negativity or Ag negativity does not mean that transmission of infection is not possible. Viral culture is a relatively insensitive method that is also prone to analytical variability across laboratories. Additionally, false-negative Ag results were observed in all of the studies that used culture as a comparator (range: 3%\u201321% false-negative Ag tests vs culture) [64, 128\u2013130]. It is likely that some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who test negative by Ag and/or culture are contagious. While the use of Ag testing to infer contagiousness and need for isolation is common, the panel identified no studies that provided direct empirical evidence in support of this practice. Careful epidemiologic investigations in households or other high-transmission settings coupled with genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 are needed to determine how well Ag test results correlate with contagiousness. New tests capable of accurately predicting contagiousness are also needed.\nThe panel identified other notable evidence gaps. Despite the common use of single or serial Ag testing as a tool to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools, colleges, workplaces, and before large social gatherings, we were unable to identify any empirical evidence in support of these practices. Mathematical modeling has suggested that repeated Ag testing will help overcome the sensitivity limitations of rapid Ag tests and that the frequency of testing and turnaround time to results may be just as important as test sensitivity in certain situations. Well-designed studies are needed to measure the effect of repeated testing strategies on analytical test performance and transmission events in a variety of settings. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of repeated Ag testing versus less-frequent rapid RT-PCR, or potentially no testing depending on prevalence, needs to be determined. Potential effectiveness measures should include the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases identified, the results of contact tracing around new cases, and ideally, transmission events. In addition to the price of test kits (eg, reagents and consumables), assessments of cost should also factor in the resources required to scale-up testing.\nInformation was also limited on the performance of Ag tests in immunocompromised persons and in individuals who had received 1 or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine or who had had natural COVID-19 infection. Data on the performance of Ag tests in detecting contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variants,\n30 \u2022 CID \u2022 Hayden et al\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad032/7005394 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nincluding Omicron, were also lacking. One study published after the literature search for the current systematic review was completed used deep mutational scanning to identify SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid escape mutations of rapid Ag tests. This report predicted that available Ag tests that target the nucleocapsid would detect current and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants [130]. Peer-reviewed studies of Ag test performance in populations infected by the newest variants are needed. Testing recommendations may change as additional data on test performance in these populations increase.\nFinally, it is important to note that we included only studies of Ag tests with FDA-EUA or CE status. Non-EUA tests may perform similarly, better or worse than EUA and CE marked tests. New tests are also likely to come to market in the future and will need to be evaluated."

            "text": "Equitable access to testing resources such as rapid Ag testing should be ensured across all communities. The ease of use and lower price per test relative to standard NAAT are attractive features of rapid Ag testing. Overall, Ag testing had a sensitivity of 80% in symptomatic individuals and 63% in asymptomatic persons, with specificities of close to 100% in both populations, compared with a single standard NAAT. Given the low sensitivity of Ag tests, standard NAAT remains the diagnostic modality of choice for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially when the pretest probability of infection is moderate to high and/or the harms of falsely negative results are significant. In situations where standard NAAT is not available, timely, or feasible, Ag testing can be used without the need to routinely confirm positive test results. However, a negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ideally, negative Ag test results should be confirmed by standard NAAT if the suspicion of COVID-19 is moderate or high; repeat Ag testing may be considered when standard NAAT is not an option. Notably, a negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, although a positive Ag test makes infectiousness more likely."
