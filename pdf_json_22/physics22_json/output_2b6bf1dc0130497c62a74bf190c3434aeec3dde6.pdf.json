    "abstractText": "The latest results of CDF-II collaboration show a discrepancy of 7\u03c3 with standard model expectations. There is, also, a 4.2\u03c3 discrepancy in the measurement of muon magnetic moment reported by Fermilab. We study the connection between neutrino masses, dark matter, muon (g\u2212 2) and W-boson mass anomaly within a single coherent framework based on Z4 extension of the scotogenic model with vector like lepton (VLL). Neutrino masses are generated at one loop level. The inert doublet, also, provide a solution to W-boson mass anomaly through correction in oblique parameters S, T and U . The coupling of VLL triplet \u03c8T to inert doublet \u03b7 provides positive contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment. In the model, the VLL triplet provides a lepton portal to dark matter (\u03b70 R). The model predicts a lower bound mee > 0.025 eV at 3\u03c3, which is well within the sensitivity reach of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay experiments. The model explains muon anomalous magnetic moment \u2206a\u03bc for 1.3 < y\u03c8 < 2.8 and mass of DM candidate in the range 152 GeV < M\u03b70 R < 195 GeV. The explanation of W-boson mass anomaly, further, constrain the mass of DM candidate, M\u03b70 R , in the range 154 GeV < M\u03b70 R < 174 GeV. \u2217009simranarora@gmail.com \u2020monalkashav@gmail.com \u2021s 7verma@hpcu.ac.in, Corresponding Author \u00a7bcawake@hpcu.ac.in 1 ar X iv :2 20 7. 08 58 0v 1 [ he pph ] 1 8 Ju l 2 02 2",

There is, also, a 4.2\u03c3 discrepancy in the measurement of muon magnetic moment reported by Fermilab.

The coupling of VLL triplet \u03c8T to inert doublet \u03b7 provides positive contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment.

            "text": "The existence of dark matter (DM), non-zero neutrino masses and matter-antimatter asymmetry suggest that the standard model (SM) of particle physics, despite its enormous triumphs, cannot be regarded as a conclusive hypothesis. Very recently, muon (g \u2212 2) Collaboration at Fermilab has reported the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment a\u00b5 \u2261 (g\u00b5 \u2212 2)/2 showing a 4.2\u03c3 discrepancy with SM prediction [1]. The difference between the combined experimental result aexp\u00b5 = 116592061(41) \u00d7 10\u221211 [1] and SM prediction aSM\u00b5 = 116591810(43) \u00d7 10\u221211 [2] of muon anomalous magnetic moment is \u2206a\u00b5 \u2261 aexp\u00b5 \u2212aSM\u00b5 = 251(59)\u00d710\u221211 which is a sign of new physics (NP) beyond the SM. Several models have been proposed with an aim to accommodate muon (g\u22122). Although, there exist theoretical models based on discrete symmetries to resolve muon anomaly [3\u20136] but the most general framework include the extension of SM by U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 symmetry [7, 8], wherein an additional gauge boson provide correction to muon magnetic moment at one loop [9\u201315].\nWithin SM, the mass of W-boson is MSMW = 80.354\u00b1 0.007 GeV [16], however, CDFII collaboration has recently published their results for the mass of W gauge boson MW = 80.4335 \u00b1 0.0094 GeV [17] which shows 7\u03c3 discrepancy with corresponding SM prediction [16]. There have been many attempts to resolve this anomaly [18\u201327]. The authors in Refs. [28\u201338] have attempted to provide a common explanation for both muon (g \u2212 2) and W-boson mass anomaly.\nIn the context of scotogenic models, U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 symmetry has been employed where new gauge boson emanating from the symmetry breaking explains the muon(g \u2212 2) [39\u201343]. In such scenarios, the scotogenic fields (\u03b7,Nk) do not contribute to muon (g\u22122), explicitly. Alternatively, in the present work, Z4 symmetry is employed for the coupling of muon to the inert doublet \u03b7 and vector like lepton (VLL), \u03c8T , explaining muon (g\u22122) in the framework of scotogenic model [44]. The novelty of the framework lies in the fact that inert doublet (\u03b7) contributes to neutrino mass, dark matter, muon (g \u2212 2) and and W-boson anomaly explanation. With the addition of three righthanded neutrinos and an inert doublet, the scotogenic model offers a simultaneous explanation for dark matter and non-zero neutrino masses. A scalar singlet is added to the particle content of the model which breaks Z4 to Z2 symmetry. The inert doublet and right-handed neutrinos are odd under the unbroken Z2 symmetry and stabilizes the lightest DM candidate that is real part of inert doublet in the model. The neutrino masses are generated at one loop level. In order to accommodate the muon (g\u22122), a VLL triplet is added which when couples to the scalar doublet results in chirally enhanced positive contribution to muon (g\u2212 2) and, also, provide a lepton\nportal to DM. In addition, the model can resolve W-boson mass anomaly through correction in oblique parameters S, T and U reflecting the NP contribution.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we have discussed the basic structure and phenomenological consequences of the scotogenic model. In Section 3, we outline the numerical analysis and related discussion. Finally, in Section 4 we summarize our results."

The investigation of lepton flavour violation (LFV) process is encouraging from the perspective of explorable signatures of BSM scenarios at collider experiments. Any detection of such LFV decays like \u00b5\u2192 e\u03b3 will be a new physics signature. Within the model proposed in this work, the charged component of scalar doublet can provide such NP contribution for which the decay width is given by [64,65]\nBr(\u00b5\u2192 e\u03b3) = 3(4\u03c0) 3\u03b1em\n4G2F |AD|2Br(\u00b5\u2192 e\u03bd\u00b5\u03bd\u0304e), (20)\nwhere\nAD = \u2211 k y\u2217keyk\u00b5 16\u03c02 1 M2\u03b7+ f(x\u2032), (21)\nGF is Fermi constant, x \u2032 = M2k/M 2 \u03b7+ and f(x \u2032) = 1\u22126x \u2032+3x\u20322+2x\u20323\u22126x\u20322 log x\u2032 12(1\u2212x\u2032)4 . The LFV prediction of the model is found to be in consonance with the experimental bound( in fact less than 10\u221214) for the obtained DM mass range."

            "text": "Muon (g \u2212 2) anomaly, neutrino mass and mixing pattern, dark matter lack an explanation within the SM. Also, recent observation of W-boson anomaly requires new physics explanation beyond SM. In this work, we propose a scotogenic scenario explaining neutrino oscillation data, muon (g \u2212 2), W-boson mass anomaly with a possible DM candidate, simultaneously. SM gauge group is extended with Z4 symmetry wherein a scalar singlet S is introduced which acquires vev and breaks this symmetry to the remnant Z2 symmetry stabilizing the DM candidate in the model. In particular, to accommodate small neutrino masses and DM in the model, we have considered scotogenic model that includes three right-handed neutrinos and an inert scalar doublet which is odd under unbroken Z2 symmetry. The real part of inert doublet is the lightest Z2 odd particle, thus, it is a suitable DM candidate in the model. Furthermore, a VLL triplet \u03c8T is introduced which couples to scalar doublet providing positive contribution to muon (g \u2212 2). We, also, provide benchmark point of the numerical analysis indicating the simultaneous explanation of the above mentioned anomalies. In addition, the implication of the model for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay has, also, been studied. The model predicts a lower bound mee > 0.025 eV at 3\u03c3, which is well within the sensitivity reach of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay experiments. The model, in general, predicts both CP conserving and CP violating solutions. The model explains muon\nanomalous magnetic moment \u2206a\u00b5 for 1.3 < y\u03c8 < 2.8 and mass of DM candidate in the range 152 GeV < M\u03b70R < 195 GeV (Fig. 6(b)). The explanation of W-boson mass anomaly, further, constrain the mass of DM candidate, M\u03b70R , to be in the range 154 GeV < M\u03b70R < 174 GeV (Fig. (8))."
