    "abstractText": "We investigate the robustness of earnings surprise measures in the context of a revised market reaction. While existing literature suggests that financial anomalies may distort cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) during annual announcements, our research proves that a revised market reaction offers a more accurate reflection of investor reactions to earnings correction. Specifically, we introduce an innovative adjustment to CAR using stock price jumps, and prove that the fraction of misses on the same side (FOM) provides a superior measure of earnings surprises. Furthermore, we find that investor trading patterns align with FOM, and the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) strategy based on FOM outperforms that based on analysts\u2019 forecast error.",

            "text": "A substantial body of literature shows that analysts\u2019 tendency to exhibit an optimistic bias in their earnings forecasts, revealing that the forecasts released by analysts are typically higher than the actual earnings [1\u20133]. The overly optimistic forecasts not only suggest that analysts place excessive weight on their private information [4], but also withheld negative information causing lower pricing efficiency in the stock market [5]. Nonetheless, analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts remain an integral benchmark for current scholars to measure the market consensus [6]. Much of the literature takes the average (the median or the latest) of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts before the earnings announcement as the market consensus, and then calculates earnings surprises. However, the overly optimistic forecasts may lead to the undervaluation of earnings shocks, which amplifies the investors\u2019 sensitivity to earnings shocks. At the same time, due to a general short-selling restriction in China\u2019s stock market, analysts are required to furnish a higher number of \"buy\" rating reports to enhance commission income, thereby leading to a stronger optimistic bias [7, 8]. Thus, there exists a greater need for conducting an exhaustive analysis of the effectiveness of measuring earnings surprises in China\u2019s stock market.\nEarnings surprises are widely used in the basic research on stock markets such as market\nefficiency and earning management. How to better measure earnings surprises is a core question in related empirical researches. The methods employed to measure earnings surprises continue to evolve. For instance, Brown et al. [9] illustrated that earnings surprises based on analysts\u2019 forecasts provided better predictions of corresponding abnormal returns than that\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296394 December 22, 2023 1 / 24\na1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Pan Q, Huang K (2023) How to measure earnings surprises: Based on revised market reaction.

Conversely, O\u2019Brien [1] demonstrated that forecasts\u2019 errors based on the Foster Model proved to better explain abnormal returns than those established by analysts. Such as some financial valuation ratios can also be used to predict futures tock earnings [10\u201312]. Subsequently, most literature acknowledges analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts as a more reliable indication of stock market consensus and uses them as a proxy for market consensus expectations [13]. Furthermore, Bouchaud [14] uses the mean of analysts\u2019 forecasts as a proxy for market consensus, but Gu and Wu [15] based on minimizing the mean-squared error loss function, found that the median earnings forecasts are a better proxy for market consensus than the average. In addition, other academic studies suggest that the most recent earnings forecasts contain all public and private information, and are a better proxy for market consensus [16]. Nevertheless, Chiang et al., [3] point out that earnings surprises based on the median or the latest analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts still encounter systematic forecast bias, although they dilute the effect of outliers on the average. There exist certain restrictions in the literature. On one hand, it is worth noting that while current studies typically rely on analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts to estimate earnings surprises [17], the literature on earnings surprises measurement methods has primarily focused on comparing random walk models to analyst earnings forecasts, which lack of discussion on the different calculation methods of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts; on the other hand, with the rapid development of China\u2019s capital market, leading to an increase in the number of analysts and greater attention paid to their opinions. Consequently, there is a need for further research on the validity of earnings surprises measurement in China\u2019s stock market.\nHow to test the accuracy of various earnings surprise measures? The mainstream literature\nemploys event study method to investigate the relationship between earnings surprises and market reaction [3, 13]. They examine a noticeable positive correlation exists between earnings surprises and cumulative abnormal return (CAR) around the earnings announcement. However, some studies have revealed the substantial influence of financial anomalies on individual stock returns around earnings announcement. For example, Saver and Wilson [18] discovered that stocks which released their earnings announcements early and provided preliminary market cash flow information garnered a higher risk premium compared to those that disclosed their earnings at a later time. Similarly, Engelberg et al. [19] identified 97 distinct financial anomalies coinciding with earnings announcements, noting that the abnormal return during this period is 6 times higher than normal. Therefore, financial anomalies potentially introducing bias into CAR measurements. Thus, we believe that CAR needs to be amended to eliminate the effects of financial anomalies.\nFirst, we examine whether CAR can accurately represent investors\u2019 reactions to earnings\ninformation. Due to the unique announcements disclosure mechanism in China, some companies are compelled to disclose the preliminary earnings by CSRC. About half of the listed companies opt to disclose the preliminary earnings before the end of February, then release the annual report around April. Although the preliminary earnings are not audited, they are usually seemed as an important reference to the actual earnings by investors with high accuracy [20]. Therefore, we calculate the difference between the preliminary earnings and the actual earnings as the earnings correction (EPS_PUB), which be the proxy for earnings surprises for specified firms. If EPS_PUB is zero, then there should be no earnings shock around annual announcement. So, we can apply EPS_PUB to assess the of validity of CAR. We find that only when there are earnings shocks, there is a significant positive correlation between EPS_PUB and CAR, but when there is no earnings shock, the correlation is insignificant, and the coefficient of EPS_PUB declines by about 80%. This indicates the stock return in the time window is dominated by other non-earnings factors when there is no earnings shock. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, stock prices follow a random walk and exhibit price\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296394 December 22, 2023 2 / 24\nCompeting interests: NO authors have competing interests.\njumps in response to earnings shocks. Reference from Jiang and Zhu [21], we introduce an innovative revision to CAR, denoted as CAR_NEW, incorporating stock price jumps, and we validate that CAR_NEW is an effective proxy for investors\u2019 reactions to earnings correction (EPS_PUB).\nSecond, we explore the correlation between various measures of earnings surprises and\nrevised market reaction (CAR_NEW). Most literature uses the analysts\u2019 forecast error (ERROR) as the market consensus [14, 22], while Chiang et al. [3] proposed a new measure of earnings surprises, that is the fraction of misses on the same side (FOM, the mean of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts\u2019 signs). They find that FOM is the better measure of actual earnings surprises within the U.S. stock market. We find that ERROR is not significantly related to CAR_NEW, whereas FOM is positively related to CAR and CAR_NEW. Then, when we put all measures of earnings surprise together as explanatory variables, only FOM remains significantly positive. These results indicate that FOM is a better proxy than other measures and absorbs the most unexpected earnings information reflected by ERROR. Moreover, earnings surprises calculated by star analysts, who should be with stronger abilities, still less effective than FOM. In addition, we also study the Post-Earnings Announcement Drifts (PEAD) with different measures of earnings surprises. When there is earnings shock, earnings surprises measured by different methods are significantly and positively correlated with post-earnings announcement cumulative abnormal return (POSTCAR), while there is no earnings shock, only FOM remains significantly positive. We further divide the samples of stock price jumps into positive jumps and negative jumps. We find that the systematic optimistic bias leads to analysts\u2019 overestimation of earnings, and earnings surprises estimated based on analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts are higher than market consensus, which amplifies the market reaction to earnings information, and also weakens the market reaction to earnings information when it is lower than market consensus.\nIn addition, we examine the validity of earnings surprises from other two aspects. On the\none hand, if earnings surprises reflect the actual earnings shock for investors, there should exist a significantly positive relation between earnings surprises and investor trading behavior. Thus, we use high-frequency data to track the trading behavior of investors and examine whether earnings surprises are in line with investors trading behavior around earnings announcement. The result shows that only FOM exhibits a substantial positive correlation with order imbalance, i.e., investors show a preference for buying over selling when FOM is positive, which provides new evidence that FOM is a robust measure of earnings surprises. On the other hand, we investigate PEAD strategies for different earnings surprise and find that the premium of PEAD constructed by FOM can fully explain that by ERROR. These results also show that FOM is a more validity measure of earnings surprises.\nFinally, we also carry out a series of robustness tests to ensure the reliability of our conclu-\nsion, including considering the impact of earnings pre-announcement, a more robust calculation of cumulative excess return, and other earnings surprises measurement methods.\nThe contribution of this paper may be reflected in the following aspects: First, we expand the literature related to earnings announcement and market reaction, previous literature has used the event study method to examine the relationship between earnings surprises and market reaction [3, 13]. However, they ignore the influence of financial anomalies on individual stock returns around the earnings announcement [19]. As far as we know, this is the first paper to point out such problem and prove that the market reaction measured by cumulative abnormal return cannot effectively represent the investors\u2019 response to earnings correction; Second, we build an appropriate metric for the actual investors\u2019 response to earnings shocks, i.e. revised market reaction (CAR_NEW), and verify that the revised market reaction can be a better measure of the investors\u2019 response to earnings correction; Third, we expand the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296394 December 22, 2023 3 / 24\nliterature about the measurements of earning surprises and prove FOM is a better proxy for earnings surprises in China\u2019s stock market. We examine the validity of different earnings surprises measures based on analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts, and find that investors\u2019 behaviors are in line with FOM in China\u2019s stock market.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: The first part is the introduction; The second part is hypothesis development; The third part is data; The fourth part is variables definition; The fifth part is empirical findings; The sixth part is the robustness test; The last part is the conclusion."

Thus, we believe that CAR needs to be amended to eliminate the effects of financial anomalies, and we examine whether CAR can accurately represent investors\u2019 reactions to earnings information.\nMaheu and McCurdy [23] shows that the inflow of major information would have a sig-\nnificant influence on the volatility of stock returns. Therefore, we use the stock price jump around the earnings announcement to proxy for the earnings information shock. When the stock price jumps, it indicates that there is a major unexpected earnings information, and the earnings surprise is large; Conversely, when there is no jump, the stock price follows a random walk and there is no significantly unexpected earnings information. therefore, we use stock price jumps as a proxy for information shocks and construct corrective market reactions.\nFirst, we examine whether CAR or CAR_NEW is a better proxy for investors\u2019 reactions to\nearnings information. Due to the unique announcements disclosure mechanism in China, we calculate the difference between the preliminary earnings and the actual earnings as the earnings correction (EPS_PUB), which be the proxy for earnings surprises for specified firms. If EPS_PUB is zero, then there should be no earnings shock around annual announcement. So, we can apply EPS_PUB to assess the of validity of CAR and CAR_NEW, and our hypothesis is stated as follows:\nH1: EPS_PUB is significantly related to CAR_NEW, and EPS_PUB is significantly related to CAR.\nChiang et al. [3] proposed a new measure of earnings surprises, that is the fraction of misses on the same side (FOM, the mean of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts\u2019 signs). The earnings surprises calculated by the mean, the median or the latest of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts all face the problem of systematic bias, the influence of outliers of FOM is small, which reduces the influence of extreme of analysts\u2019 forecasts error. They find that FOM is the better measure of actual earnings surprises within the U.S. stock market.\nDue to short selling in the Chinese A-share market is substantially limited, for example, short selling was banned prior to 2010 and 2016 restrictions prohibited the short selling of nearly 70% of stocks. These short-selling restrictions [24]. Then analysts are required to furnish a higher number of \"buy\" rating reports to enhance commission income, thereby leading to a stronger optimistic bias [7]. Thereby FOM is a better proxy for earnings surprises in China\u2019s stock market, rather than the earnings surprises calculated by the mean, the median or the latest of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts. Our second hypothesis is thus as follows:\nH2: FOM is significantly related to CAR_NEW, and ERROR is significantly related to CAR_NEW.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296394 December 22, 2023 4 / 24\nThen we examine the validity of earnings surprises from other two aspects. First, we use\nhigh-frequency data of investors\u2019 trading to capture investors\u2019 active behavior, examine whether investor trading behavior is significantly related to earnings surprises around earnings announcement. Then we employ a portfolio-based approach to test whether different measures of earnings surprises obtain difference PEAD. Specifically, we construct two groups, based on FOM and on ERROR, to evaluate their ability to explain each other\u2019s performance. Our third hypothesis is thus as follows:\nH3: Investor trading behavior is significantly related to FOM, and investor capture a more validity premium of PEAD constructed by FOM than ERROR."

While preliminary earnings constitute the primary unaudited operational data, their reliability remains consistently robust. From the descriptive statistics in Table 1, the difference between preliminary earnings and annual report is almost zero from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile, and only 1/4 of the samples have differences, with the annual earnings correction (EPS_PUB) deviating by a mere 3% from the mean of analysts\u2019 forecast errors. Therefore, after the release of the preliminary earnings, investors take the earnings released by preliminary earnings as the expectation of the actual earnings. Subsequently, upon the issuance of annual report, EPS_PUB is a reasonable proxy for earnings surprises [20]. We test whether it can proxy the investors\u2019 reactions to earnings correction during the earnings announcement.\nWe use the stock price jumps to describe the information shocks during earnings\nannouncement, and divides stocks into two groups according to whether the stock price jumps, that is, the stock price jumps (JUMP6\u00bc0), and the stock price no jump (JUMP = 0). Regression of two different samples as follow:\nCARj;t \u00bc a\u00fe gEPSPUBj;t \u00fe Controlsj;t \u00fe \u03b5i;j;t \u00f07\u00de\nwhere CAR is the market reaction, the cumulative excess return during the earnings announcement, EPS_PUB is the annual earnings correction, and Controls are control variable.\nThe results are shown in Table 2, while the stock price jumps during the earnings\nannouncement (JUMP6\u00bc0), the coefficient of the annual earnings correction (EPS_PUB) is 0.675, which is statistically significant at 1%, After adding control variables, the significance remains unchanged. In the sample that the stock price no jump (JUMP = 0), that is, the stock price follows random walk in the earnings announcement, and the relationship between CAR and EPS_PUB is not significant, the t-value is only 1.20. After controlling other variables, the relation between CAR and EPS_PUB is still not significant. The coefficient of EPS_PUB is about 80% lower than the sample in which the stock price jumps.\nOnly in the presence of an earnings information shock, EPS_PUB is positively correlated\nwith the CAR, and the CAR can act as a proxy for the investor response. When there is no earnings information shock in the window, CAR may be interfered by financial anomalies, and the measurement of investors\u2019 response is biased, which cannot effective proxy for investors\u2019 reactions to earnings correction. It shows that when there is no earnings information shock in annual report announcement, the CAR is disturbed by other non-earnings information factors.

The regression results are shown in Table 4. When employing CAR as the dependent variable, the regression coefficients for ERROR1, ERROR2 and FOM all exhibit significantly positive, these findings are consistent with Fried and Givoly [31], ERROR is a suitable proxy for earnings surprises, but the significance of the coefficient for FOM is 14.28, which is higher than the t-value of the ERROR1 (4.00) and the t-value of the ERROR2 (3.09). However, after controlling for the three earnings surprises measures, only the coefficient of FOM remains significantly positive in relation to CAR. In contrast, the coefficients of the other two earnings surprises become statistically insignificant. When using CAR_NEW as the dependent variable, no significant correlation is observed with ERROR1 and ERROR2, while only FOM retains its significant, the coefficient between FOM and CAR_NEW is 0.186 with a t-value of 5.59, which is significant at the 1% statistical level. These results suggest that FOM effectively captures unexpected earnings information present in ERROR1 and ERROR2, so it is the sole proxy for market earnings surprises.\nThe findings presented in Table 4 suggest that FOM fully absorbs the unexpected earnings\ninformation manifested in both ERROR1 and ERROR2. When contrasted with the prevalent method of using analysts\u2019 absolute earnings forecasts to calculate ERROR1 and ERROR2, the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296394 December 22, 2023 10 / 24\nFOM derived from the sign of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts is a better proxy for market earnings surprises. The regression coefficients for earnings surprises are notably positive when each of the three earnings surprises measures are individually examined using CAR as an indicator of investors\u2019 reactions to earnings information. Each earnings surprises measurement appears effective, the existing literature often does not differentiate between these three measurements in their detailed examinations of earnings surprises.\nHowever, after revising CAR, the regressions of ERROR1, ERROR2 and CAR_NEW are\nnot significant, and only FOM remains significantly positive, indicating that the mean (the latest) of analysts\u2019 forecasts errors does not proxy for market consensus and that the fraction of misses on the same side is a better proxy for earnings surprises. Given the inherent biases in CAR, the results are debatable when CAR is employed to assess the validity of various earnings surprises measures.

Given this differential in analyst ability, we only select the sample of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts after becoming star analysts, constructs earnings surprises (ERROR1_STAR, ERROR2_STAR), based on the mean (the latest) of star analysts\u2019 forecasts, and tests the validity of three different earnings surprises estimated by ERROR1_STAR, ERROR2_STAR and FOM. To focus on this narrowed sample, we include only companies that have earnings forecasts from star analysts, and FOM is calculated using the earnings forecasts from all analysts.\nThe results are shown in Table 5, are consistent with Table 4, the regression coefficients are\nsignificantly positive when the more capable star analysts replace the earnings forecasts of all analysts, regression ERROR1_STAR, ERROR2_STAR and FOM are all significantly positive with CAR, respectively, and only the coefficient of FOM is significantly positive when controlling for all three kinds of earnings surprises measures simultaneously; when replacing the explanatory variables with CAR_NEW, only the coefficient of FOM is significantly positive, and neither the coefficient of ERROR1_STAR nor ERROR2_STAR is significant. The conclusions in Table 5 show that even the star analysts with stronger individual ability, the mean (the latest) of their earnings surprises are still not as effective as FOM. Considering that FOM can covers more companies, using FOM as a proxy for earnings surprises is better than those calculated based on the mean (the latest) of star analysts\u2019 errors.\n5.3.2. Different earnings surprises measures and Post-Earnings Announcement Drift.\nBrown [33] first discovered the financial anomaly known as the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift. Within this phenomenon, stocks demonstrating the most pronounced earnings surprises continue to ascend, while those with the weakest earnings surprises persistently decline post-announcement. This intriguing trend has been consistently reaffirmed in subsequent research [34\u201336]. Therefore, we further investigate the phenomenon of the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift caused by different earnings surprise measures, using the post-earnings announcement cumulative excess return (POSTCAR) to test the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift of three kinds of earnings surprises, we divided them into two samples according to whether the stock price jumps.\nTable 6 shows our empirical findings. When JUMP6\u00bc0, the coefficient of ERROR1 and\nPOSTCAR is 0.659, achieving significance at the 5% statistical level. This denotes the sensitivity of stock prices to earnings information shocks. Conversely, in instances where JUMP = 0, indicating an absence of stock price jumps and a potential adherence to a random walk model, the coefficient of ERROR1 and POSTCAR is a mere 0.041, lacking statistical significance.\nRegardless of stock price jumps, the coefficients associated with ERROR2 and POSTCAR\nare statistically insignificant. Conversely, FOM exhibits a significant PEAD irrespective of the\npresence or absence of stock price jumps during earnings announcements. Specifically, with JUMP6\u00bc0, the coefficient of FOM is 6.382\u2014nearly three times its counterpart (2.598) in cases devoid of stock price jumps. This suggests the PEAD is larger in stocks with significant earnings information shocks in the market. Moreover, the t-value for FOM is 5.85, which is larger than the t-value of the ERROR1, 2.03. This finding also suggests that whether there is a significant earnings information shock, the fraction of misses on the same side is better proxy for earnings surprises.\nWe further divide the sample of stock price jumps (JUMP 6\u00bc0) into positive jumps\n(JUMP>0) and negative jumps (JUMP<0). Table 7 shows the results of this subdivision. For positive jumps (JUMP>0), where EPS is higher than expected and both ERROR1 and FOM coefficients with POSTCAR are significantly positive. Notably, the coefficient for FOM is 9.84, approximately 50% elevated compared to its value for JUMP 6\u00bc0 as presented in Table 7. On the other hand, when considering negative jumps (JUMP<0), all three earnings surprise coefficients relative to POSTCAR are statistically inconsequential. These observations resonate with prior literature highlighting analysts\u2019 systematic optimism bias [1\u20133]. Such bias suggests analysts tend to overestimate EPS, resulting in inflated earnings\nsurprises based on their forecasts. This can accentuate market reactions when actual earnings surpass market consensus, yet attenuate responses when they underperform against the same benchmark."

PEAD_FOM is the difference between the value-weighted average of the returns on the high-FOM portfolio and the average of the returns on the low-FOM portfolio. In the same way, stocks are allocated to five groups using ERROR1 in every year, and are calculated the portfolio return (PEAD_ERROR1) of PEAD. Then e_mkt and v_mkt are the equal-weighted and value-weighted excess portfolio returns adjusted by market return. e_ff3 and v_ff3 are the equal-weighted and value-weighted excess portfolio returns adjusted by the FF3 factors, respectively.\nTable 9 shows that PEAD_FOM is capable of explaining PEAD_ERROR1, implying that\nFOM reflects more earnings surprises information.

Additionally, we calculated the annual earnings correction (EPS_PUB) by measuring the difference between the earnings reported in the preliminary earnings and those in the annual report, and it acts as the proxy for the earnings surprises. The result shows that CAR cannot validity proxy for the investors\u2019 reactions to earnings correction, and suggests that it is reasonable to use the CAR_NEW to proxy the reaction of investors to\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0296394 December 22, 2023 21 / 24\nearnings. Subsequently, we employ CAR_NEW to evaluate the three measures of earnings surprises and find that only FOM is a valid proxy variable for earnings surprises. We further use high-frequency data to track the trading behavior of investors and find that the investors trade on FOM. We also find that the returns of portfolio constructed by FOM can fully explain that by ERROR.\nIn summary, our research demonstrates that despite the systematic optimism bias in analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts, the nonparametric estimation of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts (FOM) remains a better proxy for earnings surprises. This finding is helpful for future earnings surprises fully explained in related academic fields. We introduce the innovative concept of utilizing stock price jumps to construct a revised market reaction, thereby addressing biases in stock returns associated with financial anomalies during earnings announcements\u2014an aspect often overlooked in existing literature. Furthermore, we use the unique announcements disclosure mechanism in Chinese stock market, and confirm the enhanced precision of the revised market reaction in measuring investor responses, this valuable contribution can assist researchers in recognizing potential market response biases in future investigations. For investors, while absolute values of analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts may exhibit significant errors, the fraction of misses on the same side remains a valuable tool, which helps investors make more efficient use of analyst information.\nSupporting information"
