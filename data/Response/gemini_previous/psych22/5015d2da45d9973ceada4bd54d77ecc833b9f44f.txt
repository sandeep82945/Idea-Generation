1. **Investigate the impact of the PREMIUM-CAT on patient-provider communication and treatment outcomes.** By measuring the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI, the PREMIUM-CAT could help to improve communication between patients and providers, leading to better treatment outcomes. Future research could examine the relationship between PREMIUM-CAT scores and patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and clinical outcomes.


2. **Explore the use of the PREMIUM-CAT in different settings and populations.** The PREMIUM-CAT was developed and validated in a sample of patients with SMI in France. Future research could examine the psychometric properties of the PREMIUM-CAT in other settings and populations, such as patients with SMI in other countries or patients with other mental illnesses.


3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to improve the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI.** The PREMIUM-CAT could be used to identify patients who are not receiving adequate information about their illness and treatment. Future research could develop and evaluate interventions to improve the quality of information delivered to these patients, such as educational programs or decision aids.


4. **Examine the relationship between the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI and their health literacy.** Health literacy is the ability to understand and use health information. Patients with low health literacy may have difficulty understanding the information they receive from their providers, which could lead to poor treatment outcomes. Future research could examine the relationship between the quality of information delivered to patients with SMI and their health literacy, and develop interventions to improve health literacy in this population.


5. **Use the PREMIUM-CAT to study the impact of different communication strategies on patient understanding and satisfaction.** Different communication strategies can be used to deliver information to patients with SMI. For example, some providers may use written materials, while others may use verbal communication or a combination of both. Future research could use the PREMIUM-CAT to study the impact of different communication strategies on patient understanding and satisfaction, and develop recommendations for best practices in communication with patients with SMI.
