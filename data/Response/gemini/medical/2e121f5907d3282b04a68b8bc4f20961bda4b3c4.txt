1. Investigate the potential synergistic effects of multiple air pollutants and heavy metals on the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy.


2. Examine the role of genetic factors in modifying the association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals and the development of ASD and epilepsy.


3. Evaluate the impact of postnatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals on the risk of ASD and epilepsy, and explore the potential for early intervention strategies to mitigate these risks.


4. Investigate the underlying biological mechanisms through which prenatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals may lead to the development of ASD and epilepsy, including epigenetic modifications, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.


5. Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term health effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution and heavy metals on neurodevelopment and overall health outcomes in children with ASD and epilepsy.
