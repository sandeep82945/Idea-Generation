Background: In recent years, the focus on respiratory disorders has increased, notably on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), an inflammatory condition of the upper airway that can significantly impact oneâ€™s quality of life. Interestingly, CRS has emerged as a potential comorbidity in erectile dysfunction (ED). This study aims to assess the impact of endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS on sexual function. Materials and Methods: The authors conducted a prospective study of patients who visited their clinics for chronic rhinosinusitis between June 2018 and June 2022. The study involved 53 patients aged between 40 and 70 years who were treated for CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Preoperative and postoperative assessments were performed using the Nasal Obstruction Symptoms Evaluation Score (NOSE score) and the 5th International Index of Erectile Function Score (IIEF-5 score) to evaluate potential improvements in sexual function following endoscopic sinus surgery. Results: Before surgery, the average NOSE score was 72.6, which decreased to 24.9 postoperatively. The average preoperative IIEF-5 score was 16.35, while the postoperative average increased to 19.52. Statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in erectile function for penetration (p-value = 0.024) and overall satisfaction after intercourse (p-value < 0.001) regarding the degree of nasal obstruction. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential benefits of treating chronic obstructive upper airway diseases such as sinusitis in improving the sexual outcomes of patients clinically diagnosed with erectile dysfunction. 1. conclusions This study provides evidence of how the treatment of chronic obstructive upper airway diseases can improve the sexual outcomes of patients clinically diagnosed with erectile dysfunction. Notably, the average postoperative NOSE score significantly decreased to 24.9, indicating substantial improvements in nasal obstruction. Furthermore, the average preoperative IIEF-5 score was 16.35, while the average postoperative value increased to 19.52. Consistent with the previous literature, there was a significant increase in all domains of erectile dysfunction assessed by the questionnaire following surgical treatment. This research highlights the importance of considering nasal obstruction and its systemic effects as potential contributors to erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction etiology has been identified as organic, psychogenic, and mixed. Our findings suggest that addressing nasal obstruction through surgical intervention can yield significant improvements in both nasal function and sexual outcomes because of the many consequences on the respiratory, vascular, and therefore systemic spheres that chronic upper airway obstruction can cause.
