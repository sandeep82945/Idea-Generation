    "abstractText": "Four actinomycete strains isolated from the coral Acropora austera and coral sand samples from the South China Sea, were found to produce a series of halogenated compounds baring similar ultraviolet absorption based on the analysis of HPLC and LC-MS. The production titers of halogenated compounds from Streptomyces diacarni SCSIO 64983 exceeded those of other similar strains leading us to focus on SCSIO 64983. Four new thiocarbazomycins A\u2013B (1\u20132), chlocarbazomycin E (3), and brocarbazomycin A (4), together with three known chlocarbazomycins A\u2013C (5\u20137) containing a carbazole core were identified, and their structures were determined using a combination of spectroscopic analysis including HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR. Structurally speaking, compounds 1 and 2 have the rare sulfur-containing carbazole nuclei, and 3 and 4 contain Cl and Br atoms, respectively. Although these compounds have not yet been found to have obvious biological activity, their discovery highlights the role of molecular libraries in subsequent drug discovery campaigns.",

Many CABs can prevent coral diseases and protect corals from pathogens by producing defensive agents with antiviral, anti-bacterial, anti-fouling, and anti-parasitic activities [1\u20133]. Coral-derived actinomycetes have the potential to produce polyketides [4\u20138], alkaloids [9], and terpenes [10], etc.; all are important sources for drug discovery and development [11]. In particular, carbazole compounds have a wide range of biological activities, including but not limited to antibacterial, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and neuroprotective activities [12,13]. Graebe and Glaser first discovered compounds possessing a carbazole nucleus from coal tar in 1872; subsequent efforts found that some carbazole-derived compounds could be isolated from roots, root barks, cow urine, and cyanobacteria of higher plants [12,13]. There are, however, very few reports of carbazole compounds being produced by marine microorganisms.

Comparisons of the NMR and HRESIMS data sets reported in the literature [13] to the data generated herein revealed that compounds 5, 6, and 7 are the previously known compounds chlocarbazomycin A, chlocarbazomycin B, and chlocarbazomycin C, respectively. With respect to SCSIO 64983-derived compounds not clearly assignable as established agents, thiocarbazomycin A (1) was identified as a light brown powder with molecular formula C14H10N2OS and 11 degrees of unsaturation as deduced from HRESIMS data (Figure S11). The 13C NMR and DEPT135 spectra of 1 revealed 14 carbon signals which were assigned to seven quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 130.6, 115.2, 120.9, 123.8, 142.1, 138.2, and 167.1), six methine carbons (\u03b4C 110.1, 117.0, 123.6, 119.7, 126.8, and 111.8), and one methylene group (\u03b4C 30.6) (Table 1 and Table S1). The 1H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of six aromatic protons, and 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of two spin systems: H-7 (\u03b4H 7.07)/ H-8 (\u03b4H 7.30) and H-1 (\u03b4H 7.45)/ H-2 (\u03b4H 7. 39) / H-3 (\u03b4H 7.17) / H-4 (\u03b4H 8.36), indicating that 1 contained at least two benzene rings. The HMBC correlations of H-8 (\u03b4H 7.30)/C-6 (\u03b4C 130.6, C), C-4b (\u03b4C 120.9, C) and H-7 (\u03b4H 7. 07)/C-5 (\u03b4C 115.2, C), C-8a (\u03b4C 138.2, C) suggested the presence of a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted benzene ring (C ring). In addition, HMBC correlations of H-4 (\u03b4H 8.36) /C-9a (\u03b4C 142.1, C), and H-1 (\u03b4H 7.45) /C-3 (\u03b4C 119.7, CH), C-4a (\u03b4C 123.8, C) indicated the existence of a 1,2-disubstituted benzene ring (A ring). Two parts (A and C rings) appeared to be connected via C4a-C4b and C8a-NH-C9a, as suggested by HMBC correlations of H-4 (\u03b4H 8.36) /C-4b (\u03b4C 120.9, C), and 9-NH (\u03b4H 11.37) /C-4b (\u03b4C 118.8, C), C-4a (\u03b4C 121.9, C), C-9a (\u03b4C 140.2, C) and C-8a (\u03b4C 135.9, C); these findings were consistent with the presence of a pyrrole ring (B ring). HMBC correlations of 10-NH (\u03b4H 10.52)/ C-1\u201d (\u03b4C 164.3, C) and C-2\u201d (\u03b4C 29.0, CH) and the chemical shift of C-1\u201d indicated the existence of a -CH2-CO-NH- linkage as well. HMBC correlations of H-2\u201d (\u03b4H 3.59) to C-5 (\u03b4C 112.6, C), and 10-NH (\u03b4H 10.52)/ C-7 (\u03b4C 115.9, CH) and C-5 (\u03b4C 112.6, C), in conjunction with the remaining point of unsaturation and S atom indicated identity of the D ring. Therefore, the structure of compound 1, hitherto named thiocarbazomycin A (1), was established (Figures 3 and 4).\nFigure 2.

The 13C NMR and DEPT135 spectra of 1 revealed 14 carbon signals which were assigned to seven quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 130.6, 115.2, 120.9, 123.8, 142.1, 138.2, and 167.1), six methine carbons (\u03b4C 110.1, 117.0, 123.6, 119.7, 126.8, and 111.8), and one methylene group (\u03b4C 30.6) (Tables 1 and S1). The 1H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of six aromatic protons, and 1H-1H COSY spectrum of 1 revealed the presence of two spin systems: H-7 (\u03b4H 7.07)/ H-8 (\u03b4H 7.30) and H-1 (\u03b4H 7.45)/ H-2 (\u03b4H 7. 39) / H-3 (\u03b4H 7.17) / H-4 (\u03b4H 8.36), indicating that 1 contained at least two benzene rings. The HMBC correlations of H-8 (\u03b4H 7.30)/C-6 (\u03b4C 130.6, C), C-4b (\u03b4C 120.9, C) and H-7 (\u03b4H 7. 07)/C-5 (\u03b4C 115.2, C), C-8a (\u03b4C 138.2, C) suggested the presence of a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted benzene ring (C ring). In addition, HMBC correlations of H-4 (\u03b4H 8.36) /C-9a (\u03b4C 142.1, C), and H-1 (\u03b4H 7.45) /C-3 (\u03b4C 119.7, CH), C-4a (\u03b4C 123.8, C) indicated the existence of a 1,2-disubstituted benzene ring (A ring). Two parts (A and C rings) appeared to be connected via C4a-C4b and C8a-NH-C9a, as suggested by HMBC correlations of H-4 (\u03b4H 8.36) /C-4b (\u03b4C 120.9, C), and 9-NH (\u03b4H 11.37) /C-4b (\u03b4C 118.8, C), C-4a (\u03b4C 121.9, C), C-9a (\u03b4C 140.2, C) and C-8a (\u03b4C 135.9, C); these findings were consistent with the presence of a pyrrole ring (B ring). HMBC correlations of 10-NH (\u03b4H 10.52)/ C-1\u201d (\u03b4C 164.3, C) and C-2\u201d (\u03b4C 29.0, CH) and the chemical shift of C-1\u201d indicated the existence of a -CH2-CO-NH- linkage as well. HMBC correlations of H-2\u201d (\u03b4H 3.59) to C-5 (\u03b4C 112.6, C), and 10-NH (\u03b4H 10.52)/ C-7 (\u03b4C 115.9, CH) and C-5 (\u03b4C 112.6, C), in conjunction with the remaining point of unsaturation and S atom indicated identity of the D ring.

The NMR data for 2 are hown in Table 1. The combined HRESIMS and NMR data set suggested that 2 contained one methoxy group, one chlorine atom, one sulfur atom, one carbon-based\nMar. Drugs 2022, 20, 537 5 of 9\ngroup, two N-containing active hydrogens, 9 quaternary carbons, 4 methine units, and 1 methylene group. The existence of one chlorine atom in compound 2 could be deduced from its HRESIMS data corresponding to the pseudo-molecular peaks for [M + H]+ at 319.0303 and 321.0275 with a ratio of 3:1 as shown in Figure S23. The signals representing the two N-containing active hydrogens were shown in Table S1. The subunits indicated by 1D and 2D NMR data as shown in Figure 3 revealed that this compound is very similar to compound 1, in that both are carbazole compounds. Compound 2 was found to have one more chlorine atom and one more methoxy group (\u03b4H 3.90, s) than compound 1, and HMBC correlations of H-2/C-4 (\u03b4C 116.7) and 3-OCH3 /C-3 (\u03b4C 150.8) indicated that the chlorine atom and -OCH3 are attached to the C-4 and C-3 positions, respectively. Therefore, the structure of compound 2 was elucidated as thiocarbazomycin B (2). Chlocarbazomycin E (3), also was found to be a light brown amorphous powder, and was found to have a molecular formula of C14H12ClNO2 by analysis of its HRESIMS data (Figure S31) and 13C NMR data. It was determined that 3 possesses nine degrees of unsaturation. 1H NMR showed that there are five hydrogens in the aromatic region, and detailed interpretation of its 1D NMR data (Table 1) suggested a high degree of structural similarity to chlocarbazomycin C (7) [13]. It was noted that spectroscopy of compound 3 displayed an additional signal of a methoxyl group which is absent in 7. Indeed, the HMBC correlation of 6-OCH3 (\u03b4H 3.89, s)/C-6 (\u03b4C 153.0) indicated the regiochemistry of the additional methyl group as shown in Figure 3. Thus, the structure of 3 was determined, and named chlocarbazomycin E. Brocarbazomycin A (4) was isolated as a light brown solid and combined HRESIMS data (Figure S39) and NMR data revealed its molecular formula to be C13H10BrNO. The 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic data of compound 4 were very similar to those of chlocarbazomycin A (5) [13], but the chemical shift for C-4 (\u03b4C 106.3) was found to be significantly up-field shifted in 4 (\u03b4C 117.1 in 5). Combined with our knowledge of its molecular composition and origins, we proposed that a Cl-atom in 5 may simply, in 4, be replaced by a Br-atom. This speculation was secured by the HMBC correlation of H-2/C-4 and HRESIMS profiling with a ratio of 1:1 between 79Br:81Br. Thus, the structure of 4 was readily determined, and named brocarbazomycin A."

TLC and HPLC analyses revealed that remaining target compounds were concentrated in fractions Fr. C4 and Fr. C12. Accordingly, Fr. C4 was subjected to semi-preparative HPLC purification using MeCN-H2O (55:45) as eluent to yield compound 3 (tR = 22.0 min, 0.8 mg). Similarly, Fr.C12 was purified by semi-preparive HPLC [eluted with MeCN-H2O (40:60) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min] to render 2 (tR = 20.0 min, 1 mg) and compound 1 (tR = 23.6 min, 0.8 mg). Fr. A8 was eluted with a chloroform\u2013methanol solvent gradient (100:0, 98:2, 96:4, 94:6, 92:8, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5: 5, 0:100, v/v) and fractions Fr. D1~Fr. D10 were obtained. HPLC analyses revealed that the remaining target compounds were concentrated in Fr. D2. Consequently, Fr. D2 was chromatographed using a semipreparative HPLC column and elution with MeCN-H2O (60:40) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min to generate compound 7 (tR = 11.0 min, 1.8 mg) and compound 6 (tR = 9.0 min, 1.1 mg).

            "text": "In conclusion, we identified four microbial strains from coral Acropora austera and coral reef sand samples that can produce halocarbazomycins. Of the strains found, the most productive, S. diacarni SCSIO 64983, was fermented and found to generate seven halo- and thiocarbazomycins including chlocarbazomycins A\u2013C (5\u20137) [13], thiocarbazomycins A\u2013B (1\u20132), chlocarbazomycins E (3), and brocarbazomycin A (4). Isolation and characterization of the halo- and thiocarbazomycins revealed that compounds 1 and 2 share a 6/5/6/6 tetracyclic skeleton containing an S atom, whereas compound 4 has a rare aryl bromide group. The biological activities displayed by these compounds and their biosynthetic origins have not yet to be extensively explored but clearly warrant future efforts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/md20080537/s1, Figures S1\u2013S61, Table S1: HRESIMS spectra, 1H (700 MHz) and 13C (175 MHz) NMR data for compound 1\u20137.
