1. **Investigating the effects of different metal dopants on the HDO performance of MoS2 catalysts.** The paper focuses primarily on Co and Pt doping, but other metals such as Ni, Fe, and W have also been shown to have promising effects on MoS2's HDO activity. Exploring the effects of these different metals and their combinations could lead to the development of even more efficient catalysts.
2. **Developing new methods for creating defects within the basal planes of MoS2.** The paper mentions that creating defects within the basal planes is an effective way to enhance the HDO activity of MoS2 catalysts, but the methods currently used for creating these defects are limited. Developing new methods that are more efficient and controllable could lead to further improvements in HDO performance.
3. **Investigating the role of surface hydrophobicity in the deactivation of MoS2 catalysts.** The paper briefly mentions that surface hydrophobicity can help to prevent sulfur loss and coking, but the exact role of surface hydrophobicity in the deactivation of MoS2 catalysts is not fully understood. Further research is needed to investigate this role and to develop strategies for improving the surface hydrophobicity of MoS2 catalysts.
4. **Exploring the use of MoS2-based catalysts in the HDO of other bio-oils.** The paper focuses on the HDO of p-cresol, but MoS2-based catalysts could also be used for the HDO of other bio-oils, such as lignin-derived oils and pyrolysis oils. Investigating the HDO performance of MoS2-based catalysts with these other bio-oils could lead to the development of new and more efficient processes for the production of biofuels and other valuable chemicals.
5. **Developing new characterization techniques for MoS2-based catalysts.** The paper relies on a variety of characterization techniques to study the structure and properties of MoS2-based catalysts, but there is always a need for new and more powerful characterization techniques. Developing new techniques that can provide more detailed information about the structure and properties of MoS2-based catalysts could lead to a better understanding of their HDO performance and to the development of more efficient catalysts.
