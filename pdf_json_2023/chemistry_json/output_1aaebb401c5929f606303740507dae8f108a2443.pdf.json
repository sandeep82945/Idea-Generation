    "abstractText": "To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first direct electropolymerization of a dicyanobenzene-carbazole dye functionalized with an imidazole group to prepare redoxand photoactive porous organic polymer (POP) films in controlled amounts. The POP films were grown on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) and carbon surfaces using a new monomer, 1-imidazole-2,4,6tri(carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene (1, 3CzImIPN), through a simple one-step process. The structure and activities of the POP films were investigated as photoelectrodes for electrooxidations, as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photosynthetic olefin isomerizations, and for solid-state photoluminescence behavior tunable by lithium-ion concentrations in solution. The results demonstrate that the photoredox-POPs can be used as efficient photocatalysts, and they have potential applications",

            "text": "Molecular dyes are utilized in applications that include photocatalysis of organic reactions, as components of OLED (organic light-emitting devices) displays, in photodynamic cancer therapy, in dye-sensitized solar cells, and in photoelectrodes for solar fuels [1,2]. Ru- [3\u20135] and Ir-polypyridyl [6,7] and related complexes are common molecular dyes because they have strong absorption in the visible range (metal-to-ligand charge transfer). Moreover, they are readily modified to tune the wavelengths of absorption and emission as well as the redox properties of the excited state, and they readily undergo intersystem crossing to form relatively long-lived triplet excited states. There are inherent disadvantages with these compounds that include cost, toxicity, and low stability under certain reaction conditions that limit their large-scale application [8\u201310]. Organic dyes that are abundant and easy to prepare offer a promising alternative to precious-metal-based systems [11\u201313]. The most studied organic dyes include perylene derivatives [14], porphyrins [15], triphenylamines [16], and subporphyrins [17]. The excitation of push\u2013pull dyes involves intramolecular charge transfer [3\u20135]. The push\u2013pull dye 1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-4,6dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) [18\u201320] has been successfully utilized in OLEDs [21\u201323] and as photocatalysts for organic reactions [24\u201328], the hydrogen photoevolution reaction [29], and CO2 photoreduction [30,31]. Our group and others have attached organic dyes to electrode surfaces by electrografting with diazonium precursors [32\u201334]. The resulting carbon (dye)\u2013oxygen (semiconductor) bond shows promising stability under alkaline conditions that exceed those of the carboxylate or phosphonate bridges typically used to attach molecular chromophores to semiconductors [32,35]. We previously reported the electrografting of 4CzIPN onto indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) or carbon electrodes using diazonium chemistry, and\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3340. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15163340 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3340 2 of 17\nthe system was more stable and active under basic conditions than the representative Ru-polypyridyl complexes [36]. Porous organic polymers (POPs) offer several potential advantages over monolayers or near-monolayers of organic dyes attached to electrode surfaces [37]. For example, POPs have three-dimensional, large surface-area (i.e., high specific surface-area) structures that may coordinate with redox catalysts or act as sensor detection sites. In addition, 3-dimensional POPs made of dye monomers offer larger cross sections for light absorption than their corresponding monolayers. As well, many POPs are grown directly from simple organic monomers that do not require synthetic modifications, greatly simplifying the preparation, processing, and purification steps for large-scale preparations [28,38]. Carbazole-containing molecules have been extensively studied as electropolymerization monomers, and a wide variety of polycarbazole electropolymers have been developed for purposes that include OLEDs, capacitors, and memory devices [39]. To our knowledge, there is one example of a POP made from a dicyanobenzene-carbazole chromophore [28]. In that report, the parent dye, 4CzIPN, was copolymerized with formaldehyde dimethyl acetal using an Fe(III)-redox oxidant to affect the polymerization. The resulting polymer was evaluated as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for construction of C(sp3)\u2013P bonds and selective oxidation of sulfides in water under mild conditions [28]. We now report the first direct electropolymerization of a dicyanobenzene-carbazole dye. Specifically, we prepared redox- and photoactive-POP films in controlled amounts employing a new monomer, namely, 1-imidazole-2,4,6-tri(carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene (1, 3CzImIPN), on flat ITO (1-ITO), on ITO nanoparticles (1-ITO-NP) and on carbon (1-CP) surfaces. The reasons we focused on 3CzImIPN includes not only its similarity to 4CzIPN in acting as a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) photo-active catalyst, but also due to the N-site linkage facilitated by the imidazole group. This linkage allows for potential interactions with other active metal molecular catalysts or metal ions, rendering it suitable for applications in photo-assisted CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, other photo-redox organic reactions, or ion sensing. We report the structure and activities of the POP films as photoelectrodes for electrooxidations, as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photosynthetic olefin isomerizations, and as solid-state fluorescent metal ion sensors."

Characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDX) mapping measurements were conducted using a Zeiss EVO MA10 scanning electron microscope with EDX (Jena, Germany). Typically, the system vacuum of SEM was lower than 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 torr when acquiring images. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted using a Kratos Axis Ultra (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK). A monochromatized Al K\u03b1 source (h\u03bd = 1486.71 eV) was used, while the pressure in the sample analytical chamber was maintained below 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 torr. Survey scans covered the binding energies of 1100\u20130 eV with 160 eV analyzer pass energy. For the deconvolution process, the spectra were calibrated to position C\u2013C binding energy at 284.6 eV in order to correct the charge effect. Solid-state UV\u2013Vis spectra were collected using a Cary 5000 UV\u2013Vis (Santa Clarita, CA, USA) spectrometer in reflection mode. Solidstate photoluminescence was acquired using a Horiba-PTI QM-8075-11 (Edison, NJ, USA) fluorescence system with a solid stand. FTIR was measured using a Thermo Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer and continuum FTIR microscope on ATR (Thermo Fischer Scientific Instruments, Waltham, MA, USA). The 1H NMR spectra were acquired using 400 MHz, 500 MHz, or 600 MHz Varian Inova or Varian DD2 M2 400 MHz NMR spectrometers (Agilent T chnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Th 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a Va ian VNMRS 500 Hz NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The chemical shifts were reported i parts per million relative to TMS with the solvent as the internal standard. Abbreviations used in reporting of NMR data are s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), dd (doublet of doublet), dq (doublet of quartet), and m (multiplet). HRMS spectra were acquired using either electrospray ionization in an Agilent 6220 ao TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or electron ionization on a Kratos Analytical MS50G double-focusing sector mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Ltd., Manchester, UK). The experiment involving simulated sunight was c rried out using a 300 W xenon light source solar simulator equipp d with an AM 1.5G optical filter (Xian Toption Instrum nt Co., Ltd., Xi\u2019an, Sh anxi, China). To obtain a cross-sectional view of the film using a SEM, the sample was first coated with gold as the conduction layer and then coated with tungsten as the protection layer. The measured angle was autocorrected to obtain the thickness of the polymer film.\n3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Preparation of Monomer\nThe imidazole-dye compound 1 was prepared by displacement of fluoride in the known precursor 1-fluoro-2,4,6-tri(carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene by cesium imidazolate in 95% yield (Scheme 1).\nScheme 1. Synthesis of the monomer 3CzImIPN (1).\nFigure 1a shows the solid-state structure of 1. As has been observed in related compounds [40,41], the dihedral angles between the benzene and carbazole rings range from 60\u201370\u00b0 to relieve steric crowding. The dihedral angle between the benzene and imidazole ring is ~52\u00b0. Figure 1b shows the UV\u2013Vis and steady-state photoluminescence spectra recorded in dichloromethane. As is well known for carbazole-dicyanobenzene dyes [40], the excitation at ~421 nm results in a strong emission at ~543 nm. In keeping with the known photochemistry of this class of compound, the excitation is a charge-transfer excitation\nScheme 1.

Scheme 2 shows the proposed structure of the POP in both the reduced (neutral)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3340 6 of 17\nand oxidized (polycationic) forms. The oxidative wave at ~0.7 V specifically arises from 1 e\u2212 oxidation of the carbazole-nitrogen centers in the polymer to form the polycationic, conjugated polymer shown in Scheme 2. This behavior is typical of polycarbazoles, and the conjugated polycationic polymers are known to be electronically conductive. The reductive wave at ~0.6 V corresponds to the reduction of the positive nitrogen centers in the polycation to form the neutral polycarbazole structure shown in Scheme 2. These CVs are similar to those in the previous report by Li and his colleagues when obtaining polymers of carbazole derivatives [47]. Furthermore, the use of high upper sweep limits, as was done during these experiments, is known to produce polycarbazoles, not simple dimers [47]. Again, this behaviour is quite typical of polycarbazoles. Scheme 2 illustrates the results from the polymerization occurring at one carbazole ring per molecule of 1. In principle, the polymerization can occur at more than one carbazole ring. Further, Scheme 2 illustrates the polymerization occurring at both the 3- and 6-positions of the same carbazole ring. In principle, however, polymer growth can occur at more than one carbazole ring and at only one of the 3- or 6-positions. We note, however, that sweeping to high potentials typically results in polymerization at both positions [47]. The amount of the resulting polymer increases with each subsequent sweep, as shown by the increase in charge under the redox peaks for the polymer, and their potential shifts. Specifically, the cathodic peak shifts from ~0.65 V in the first negative-going sweep to more reducing potentials, and the anodic peak shifts to more oxidizing potentials as the amount of polymer increases, slowing the rate of electron and ion transfer through the POP. The resulting POP (10-1-ITO-NP) contains redox-active groups in the backbone and photoactive groups in the polymerized monomer, and it is capable of reactions at the imide groups. The degree of crosslinking in the photoredox-POP is unknown. The film transparency at 600 nm of 45-1-ITO was 70.4. The film thickness was 362 nm, proving it is not a simple dimer (Figure S11 in Supplementary Materials). Similar trends were observed during the 5- and 45-cycle electropolymerizations forming the 5-1-ITO-NP and 45-1-ITO-NP, respectively (Figure S1). Figure 2b shows the CV curves sweeping to negative potentials (sweep rate 10 mV s\u22121; 5, 10, 45 sweeps; sweep range from\u22120.41 to\u22121.91 vs. Fc/Fc+) for the isolated 5-, 10-, and 45-1-ITO-NP photoredoxPOPs recorded in acetonitrile solution under N2 (0.1 M TBAPF6). The electrodes were removed from the electropolymerization solution and washed thoroughly with CH2Cl2 before the CVs were recorded. The photoredox-POPs all contain highly reversible reduction peaks at ~\u22121.6 V vs. Fc/Fc+ [48]. The corresponding oxidation peak occurs ~\u22121.5 V in the positive-going sweep. The CV of the free monomer 1 contains the corresponding 1 e\u2212 reversible redox wave at ~\u22121.5 V, and it corresponds to the 1 e\u2212 reduction and oxidation of the dicyanobenzene ring [36]. The CVs of the electrodes (Figure 2b and Figure S2 in Supplementary Materials) show that the dicyanobenzene rings in the photoredox-POPs undergo the same redox process. The charge under these peaks increased with increasing electropolymerization cycles, showing that the amount of the photoredox-POP is controlled by the number of potential sweeps during the polymerization. No oxidation or reduction peaks were detected in control CVs of the bare ITO-NP electrode. Using the charges under the anodic peaks, the coverages are estimated to be 1.50 \u00d7 10\u22128, 2.94 \u00d7 10\u22128, and 4.74 \u00d7 10\u22128 moles cm\u22122 for 5-, 10-, and 45-1-ITO-NP, respectively.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3340 7 of 17 Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 17\nScheme 2.

This redox behavior is typical of polycarbazoles [39,49,50].\nThe photoredox-POP can be grown over carbon paper and bare ITO slides as well (Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials).

Figure S4 shows the weak signals at around 2237 cm\u22121 corresponding to the dicyano group on the central aromatic ring [43]. The strong peak at about 839 cm\u22121 is due to the hexafluorophosphate [51] counterions to the cationic nitrogen centers formed during the oxidation of the carbazole groups in 1. The C\u2013H stretching appears around 3000 cm\u22121 [28]. The peak around 1554 cm\u22121 is a ring vibration band characteristic of the (partially) oxidized (doped) PCz [52].

These calculations support the results for similar compounds reported in the literature [43]. During photoexcitation, an electron is promoted from S0 to a higher-energy singlet state. The electron then undergoes internal conversion (IC) to reach the lowest-energy singlet excited state S1. Two outcomes are possible: either the electron emits fluorescent light and returns to the ground state S0, or it undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC) to the lowest triplet excited state T1. The electron in state T1 can either emit phosphorescent light and return to the ground state, S0, or undergo reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and return to state S1. These calculations illustrate the photochemical processes that occur in 1 and in the photoredox-POPs. A prediction made by combining the results from the calculations with the structure and redox functions of the polycarbazole (Scheme 2) is that the highest occupied molecular orbitals will be partially depleted at higher potentials as the carbazole groups are electro-oxidized. Depletion of these orbitals is expected to decrease the photoluminescence. Indeed, Figure 6e shows that the photoluminescence intensity of the 45-1-ITO photoredoxPOP is significantly decreased after oxidation at 2.45 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for 20 min relative to the same photoredox-POP held at \u22120.55 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for 20 min. The highest occupied molecular orbitals are predominantly localized in the carbazole groups, whereas the lowest energy unoccupied orbitals primarily reside in the dicyanobenzene ring. The effect of oxidation of the carbazole groups on the light emission of the system may, for example, alter the electron transfer pathway. Specifically, upon oxidation of the carbazole groups, the excited electrons might be trapped in the holes of the oxidized carbazole groups.\nFigure 6.

The effect of oxidation of the carbazole groups on the light emission of the system may, for example, a ter the electron a sfer pathw y. Specifically, upon oxidation of the carbazole groups, the exci ed\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3340 13 of 17\nelectrons might be trapped in the holes of the oxidized carbazole groups. Regardless of the exact mechanism, these results show that the photoluminescence behavior of these photoredox-POPs can to some extent be modulated by the applied potential."

            "text": "A one-step preparation of the imidazole-functionalized, polycarbazole dicyanobenzene dye 1 is reported. The photophysical behavior of 1 is typical of this class of organic chromophores [10]. The dye is readily electropolymerized in air at the carbazole rings to produce photoredox-POPs on ITO glass, nanoparticles, and carbon paper. The resulting deposits are active photoanodes, photocatalysts for olefin isomerization reactions, and their photoluminescence behavior responds to lithium ions in solution, presumably through the coordinating imidazole groups. Studies are underway in our laboratories to fully investigate the photochemical properties and utility of these new photoredox-POP deposits.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15163340/s1, Figure S1.
