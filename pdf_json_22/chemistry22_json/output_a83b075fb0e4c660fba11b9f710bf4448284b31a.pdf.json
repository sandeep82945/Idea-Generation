We demonstrate on H2CO, PH3, CH4, C2H4 and SF6 that the proposed effective model can provide crucial information to spectroscopists within a very short\ntime compared to empirical spectroscopic models.

INTRODUCTION\nPrecise knowledge of high-energy molecular states and absorption spectra is of primary\nimportance because it gives access to the determination of the physical properties of various planetary objects1,2 and clearly demonstrates the necessity of having consistent line-byline molecular databases (e.g. like HITRAN3 or GEISA4 for the modelling of the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere). The interpretation of strong spectral features requires the use of sophisticated\nand robust theoretical models (i) for an accurate quantum-mechanical description of highly-\nexcited molecular states and (ii) for the prediction of line intensities for reliable opacity\ncalculations. Two approaches are commonly used in spectroscopy for the modelling of\nrotation-vibration spectra:\nEffective models. For the analysis of absorption spectra of molecules whose energy levels\nare organized as small groups of strong interacting vibrational levels, called polyads, the idea of introducing effective, or phenomenological, models (EM) is now well established5\u20137. Such\nmodels are defined by a set of empirical parameters, either directly fitted to experiment\nor fixed manually by the user. By definition, each polyad is formed by groups of nearly\ndegenerate vibrational states characterized by the same number, called polyad number\nP = c1v1 + c2v2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ cNmvNm (ci \u2208 R>0), (1)\nwhere vi are the vibrational quantum numbers and Nm the number of vibrational modes. In a basis of the type | \u03b3; J,C\u3009P , every block of the Hamiltonian matrix will be properly labelled by the total angular momentum J and by the symmetry C. As stated in Ref.8,\nthe polyad numbers P are approximate good quantum numbers which will be also used\nto label every block of the effective Hamiltonian. \u03b3 denotes all other labels or quantum\nnumbers (vi, etc). The first polyad P = 0, or simply denoted as P0, corresponds to the ground vibrational state. Though the second polyad does not necessarily equal P = 1, it\nwill be denoted as P1, and so on. The full problem is thus divided into a series of much smaller problems making EMs. The success of the effective approach in spectra analyses will be partly governed by a convenient choice of the polyad vector c = (c1, c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cNm)t. Krasnoshchekov and Stepanov9 introduced a number \u0398 which is interpreted as a measure of\nproportionality between the polyad coefficients ci and the vibrational harmonic frequency \u03c9i. Molecules like methane or phosphine exhibit a clear polyad structure (see Section IV), at least for the first vibrational states, while many others do not have such a regular structure.\nIn the latter case, we propose here to replace (1) by an alternative condition based on the\nfollowing energy criterion\nPk \u2208 [Ekmin, Ekmax] with Ekmin < \u2211 i vi\u03bdi \u2264 Ekmax, (2)\nwhere \u03bdi are the fundamental band centers. Probably the biggest limitation when using empirical EMs is a proper characterization of the resonance couplings due to missing in-\nformation on \u201cdark\u201d states. This generally leads to poorly defined resonance parameters\nand makes the extrapolation capabilities of theses models very limited beyond the range of\nobserved data.\nVariational calculations. The variational approach (VA) based on the use of ab initio\npotential energy surfaces (PES) is now very common for computing a consistent set of eigenvalues and associated wavefunctions, even for high energies10\u201327. As stated by Carter and Handy28, \u201cPotential energy functions have a vital role to play, when linked to the variational\nmethod, in assisting the spectroscopist in his experimental studies\u201c. A recent demonstration was given in Ref.29 where about 13000 lines in the DAS (Direct Absorption Spectroscopy) and CRDS (Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy) methane 12CH4 spectra 30\u201332 in the icosad (P = 5) region between 6280 and 7800 cm\u22121 were assigned in 1 week from accurate first-principles\npredictions resulting in the identification of 108 vibrational sub-bands. As a comparison, the same number of lines up to P = 4 (tetradecad, <6200 cm\u22121) was assigned over the\npast 40 years. With the development of modern and efficient algorithms, combined to the\nconstant advances in the computer technology, it is now possible to obtain approximate solutions of the Schro\u0308dinger equation for molecules with more than 5 atoms33\u201350 and to\nachieve very satisfactory convergence of (ro)vibrational levels. Several research groups have followed different strategies to significantly reduce the memory cost (see e.g. Refs.41,51\u201367) combined or not with iterative methods68,69 which are widespread choices for solving the eigenproblem without storing the full Hamiltonian matrices70,71. All this studies mainly ex-\nplain why the development of computer codes in the VA generally requires much more effort\nthan in the effective Hamiltonian approach. It is also worth mentioning that the VA will be\ngenerally preferred for applications where completeness is very important (e.g. astrophysical applications1,2), though the accuracy of the variationally-computed energy levels does not reach that of the EMs so far, except for some triatomic molecules72.\nThe present paper proposes a general and systematic method for the construction of ab\ninitio effective Hamiltonian and dipole moment operators. This method combines the best\nof both worlds, namely (i) manipulation and diagonalization of block-diagonal matrices of\nsmall dimension for fast calculations, even for very high J values (> 100), with the possibility\nof refining some molecular parameters on experiment without much computational effort and\n(ii) completeness of the variational method. As a prerequisite, we start from a complete\nnuclear motion ab initio Hamiltonian, assumed known here, and compute the variational\nsolutions of the stationary Schro\u0308dinger equation for low-J values only.\nIn this work, we focus on the study of semirigid molecules in their ground electronic state\nbelonging to arbitrary Abelian or non-Abelian point groups. The motivations of this work\nas well as the methodology for the derivation of ab initio EMs are presented in Section II.\nComputational details are given in Section III and the validation of the method is presented\nin Section IV on the calculation of rovibrational energy levels and infrared spectra of H2CO, PH3, CH4, C2H4 and SF6. It is highly likely that this work will be of great help in current and futures analyses by accompanying spectroscopists in the assignment of rotationally resolved\ninfrared spectra, even for complex polyads. As to the construction of an effective model for\nmore flexible molecules, it will be briefly discussed in Conclusion.\nII. CONSTRUCTION OF AB INITIO EFFECTIVE MODELS:\nMOTIVATIONS AND METHODOLOGY"

            "text": "Undoubtedly, the effective Hamiltonians have greatly contributed to the \u201cgolden age\u201d\nof the high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, but the current researches in the study of\nvarious planetary atmospheres require knowledge of increasingly complex molecular systems over wide wavenumber and temperature ranges2. Unfortunately, empirical EMs are begin-\nning to reach their limits for studying molecules with complex rovibrational energy-level\nstructures and for which the successive polyads contain many vibrational bands and nu-\nmerous degeneracies and quasi-degeneracies. Modelling of the \u201cdark states\u201d which are not\ndirectly observable is one of the major obstacles in the empirical effective approach. Another\nchallenging problem concerns the modelling of line intensities, both for cold and hot band\ntransitions. Indeed, the density of states may rapidly increase for many molecules resulting\nin strongly congested spectra where almost no individual lines can be extracted easily due\nto the overlap of thousand experimental transitions, even at room temperature. This lack\nof information may lead to a poor determination of both resonance coupling and effective\ndipole moment parameters with possibly wrong intensity transfers between weak and strong\nlines.\nIt is evident that the complete, or even partial line-by-line analysis of very crowded\nspectral regions can take years or even decades using \u201ctraditional\u201d EMs (see Section IV).\nExtrapolation to high temperatures (say >1000 K) is another limiting factor because too\nmany hot bands are still missing in the available EMs. Consequently, it is highly desirable to\npropose an alternative model which is capable of both dealing with complex polyads within\na very short time and accompanying spectroscopists in the assignment of dense and rich\nrotationally resolved infrared spectra.\nThe aim of this paper is to build an ab initio EM whose the key features can be summa-\nrized as follows:\n- This model must contain most of the resonance coupling terms up to a given polyad\nwhere the polyad scheme defined in Eq. (1) or (2) has to be conveniently chosen\nby the user. Contrary to empirical EMs where some vibrational bands in polyads\nare sometimes voluntary omitted to simplify calculations, our ab initio EM includes\nthe major contributions for computing line positions and line intensities over a large\nspectral range.\n- This model takes full advantage of the symmetry and provides to spectroscopists an\ninitial set of physically meaningful \u201cab initio\u201d effective parameters. Except for the\nzero order vibrational and the rotational constants, it is common to start an analysis\nfrom parameters initialized to zero whereas those we are able to provide are initialized\nto \u201cgood\u201d values. An illustrative example on the determination of the ground state\n(P = 0) and dyad (P = 1) parameters of PH3 will be given in Section IV.\n- A part of the initial set of Hamiltonian parameters can be further optimized by fine\ntuning to experimental spectra in order to compute energy levels at the \u201cspectroscopic accuracy\u201d, say of 10\u22123 cm\u22121 which is for example the typical resolution of Fourier\ntransform rotationally resolved spectra in the infrared. This procedure takes few\nseconds and is thus much less demanding than refining some PES parameters.\n- This model allows computing high-J rovibrational energy levels in only few minutes\nfrom the diagonalization of matrices whose the size does not usually exceed 1000.\n- If the DMS is available, an ab initio effective dipole moment is derived almost auto-\nmatically for line intensity calculations.\n- Finally, this model attempts changing the time-scale from months or years to some days\nor weeks for understanding and modelling the main spectral features of polyatomic\nmolecules, even for transitions involving high energy rovibrational states.\nUsually, the formal derivation of ab initio EMs in quantum mechanics is based on perturbation theory which has a long history (see for example the review by Watson73). The oldest approach is known as the Rayleigh-Schro\u0308dinger perturbation method74 which has been generalized to tackle the case of quasi-degenerate states75,76. Another approach was suggested by Van Vleck77 and is known as canonical perturbation theory or contact transformation (CT) method78\u201387 falling in the domain of the Lie algebra88. The basic idea is to a apply a series of\nunitary transformations TCT to the nuclear motion Hamiltonian in order to transform it to a new, block-diagonal representation. Very briefly, in perturbation theory the untransformed Hamiltonian is commonly expanded as a power series H \u2261 H(\u03930) = H0 + \u03bbH1 + \u03bb2H2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 where H0 is the zero order model, \u03bb a small formal parameter and \u03930 the totally symmetric irreducible representation of G. Following Van Vleck, the initial Hamiltonian H(\u03930) is transformed to an effective one H\u0303(\u03930) from successive unitary transformations as\nH\u0303(\u03930) = T\u22121CT H (\u03930)TCT, TCT = e \u2212i\u03bbS(\u03930)1 e\u2212i\u03bb 2S (\u03930) 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n(3)\nwhere the S (\u03930) n are the generators of the CTs which insure a block-diagonal form. In order\nto accelerate calculation of high-order contributions, the modern algorithms employ the super-operator technique proposed by Primas88 (see e.g. the MOL\u2212CT computer code 89 by Tyuterev & Tashkun designed for rigid asymmetric top molecules of symmetry Cs and C2v).\nIn this work, we present a numerical method which is not based on perturbation theory.\nSome tedious algebraic calculations involved in the derivation of effective Hamiltonian and\ntransition dipole moment operators are clearly obviated."

            "text": "moment operators\nBefore giving more details in Section III, our procedure for building an ab initio EM up\nto a polyad PNP can be summarized in three steps as follows.\n(i) First, we start from the complete nuclear motion Hamiltonian H(\u03930) and compute the\nfull matrix\nH(J,C) = \u3008\u03b3\u2032; J,C | H(\u03930) | \u03b3; J,C\u3009, (4)\nin a basis set {| \u03b3; J,C\u3009}. This matrix is diagonalized for each block (J,C) for some low-J\nvalues (see Section IV) and the corresponding variational eigenpairs are stored. As already\nmentioned in Introduction, a large number of theoretical developments and associated computer codes based on sophisticated algorithms10\u201327,33\u201367 are now able to perform accurate\nvariational calculations, even for molecules with more than 10 atoms.\n(ii) Then, we search for a unitary transformation TP \u2261 T (J,C)P that brings H(J,C) into block diagonal form up to a maximum polyad PNP following a polyad scheme defined by (1) or (2). In other words, the new matrix\nH (J,C,P ) Polyad = T \u22121P H(J,C)TP\n= [H (J,C) P0 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295H(J,C)PNP ]\u2295H (J,C) R ,\n(5)\nhas the same eigenvalues as H(J,C) but is now composed of NP + 2 blocks. The last block HR includes all the \u201cremaining\u201d polyads that are not of interest for the present study (see Section III B).\n(iii) In a last step, we assume that there exists a phenomenological Hamiltonian H\u0303(s\u0303) with a set of unknown effective parameters {s\u0303} = {s\u0303P0 , s\u0303P1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s\u0303PNp} associated with each polyad Pk. We propose to determine these parameters such that the matrix representation of H\u0303(s\u0303) in a basis set {| \u03b3; J,C\u3009Pk \u2261| m\u3009Pk} restricted to a polyad Pk matches the corresponding block in Eq. (5). So, a set of parameters s\u0303Pk is determined by solving\nPk\u3008m\u2032 | H\u0303(s\u0303) | m\u3009Pk = (H (J,C) Pk )m\u2032m =\u21d2 {s\u0303Pk}. (6)\nThe present procedure amounts to (a) searching for the matrix representation of TCT in Eq. (3) without knowing explicitly the generators Sn and (b) computing the block-diagonal representation of an effective operator H\u0303(\u03930) before knowing its parameters. A non-empirical\nEM is thus deduced without performing a perturbative expansion of H and TCT. This clearly obviates the need to compute thousands or even millions of multiple commutators of the type [iS (\u03930) n , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 [iS(\u03930)n , H(\u03930)j ] \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ], as both the order of expansion and the number of atoms N increase. Moreover, our procedure allows a full account of the symmetry properties\nthrough the use of irreducible tensor operators adapted to Abelian and non-Abelian point groups. This generalizes the work by Sadovskii & Zhilinskii90 on the dyad of methane to\narbitrary point groups and polyads. Most importantly, we will also see that the construction\nof effective operators other than Hamiltonians (e.g. dipole moment, polarizability, etc.) is\ncarried out for the very first time in a systematic and direct manner from the transformation TP defined in Eq. (5). To our knowledge, no effective dipole moment operator obtained by CT in a systematic manner has been published so far, except for some simple asymmetric rotors91,92."

            "text": "Let us now focus with more details on the three steps presented in Section II. We just assume that the Hamiltonian H(\u03930) is written as a sum-of-product of irreducible tensor\noperators to deal with arbitrary Dn, Cnv, Dnh, Dnd, Td or Oh point groups.\nA. Variational calculation (step 1)\nFor calculating rovibrational energy levels and eigenstates, it is common to first solve\nthe J = 0 stationary Schro\u0308dinger equation H (\u03930) v \u03a8 (Cv) v = Ev\u03a8 (Cv) v for each symmetry block Cv where H (\u03930) v = Tv + V refers to the vibrational Hamiltonian. To this end, we consider a basis {\u03a6(Cv)v,j } of a subspace Fr spanned by MCv primitive functions selected through the\npruning condition F\u03bb(p) = \u2211Nm i=1 \u03bbivi \u2264 p with vi = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p and where \u03bbi are weight coefficients. p and \u03bbi are chosen to properly converge the vibrational levels. So far the largest molecule our computer code was able to treat using this direct-product basis set is SF6 48. Undoubtedly, our procedure would strongly benefit from the use of reduced-dimension Hamiltonians28 to construct contracted bending, stretching or torsional functions, as done\nin many other theoretical developments and computer codes. An updated version of our\nTENSOR computer code is currently in progress to tackle big molecules (N > 7) by using\ncontracted functions in conjunction with irreducible tensor operators for a full account of\nsymmetry.\nOnce the J = 0 problem solved, the standard procedure consists in retaining NCv vi-\nbrational eigenvectors \u03a8 (Cv) v,i = \u2211MCv j=1 U (Cv) j,i \u03c6 (Cv) v,j , (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , NCv), for making J > 0 calculations35. Hv is diagonal in the product contracted basis (\u03a8 (Cv) v,i \u2297 \u03a8 (Cr) r ) \u2261| ir\u3009 where \u03a8 (Cr) r are symmetry-adapted rotational functions. Computation of the rovibrational matrix elements \u3008i\u2032r\u2032 | Hvr | ir\u3009 is much more costly because it requires making sums over j and j\u2032 with the evaluation of the matrix elements \u3008j\u2032r\u2032 | Hvr | jr\u3009 which cannot be stored in memory when Mv is large. Several dedicated algorithms 33\u201367 and optimized computer codes (e.g. GENIUSH15 or TROVE12) have been developed to compute variational solutions for\nJ > 0.\nIn this work, we follow the strategy of Refs.26,93 which consists in considering a smaller vibrational basis set F\u03bb\u2032(p \u2032) \u2208 Fp\u2032 of dimension M \u2032Cv << MCv such that the full vibrational eigenvectors (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,MCv) can be decomposed as\n\u03a8 (Cv) v,i = \u2211 j\u2208Fp\u2032 U (Cv) j,i \u03c6 (Cv) v,j + \u2211 k/\u2208Fp\u2032 U (Cv) k,i \u03c6 (Cv) v,k . (7)\nA set of M \u2032v eigenvectors is then selected from analysis of the Gram matrix [U (Cv)]tU (Cv) before introducing approximate or reduced (p\u2192 p\u2032) eigenvectors\n\u03a8 (Cv) app,v,i = \u2211 j\u2208Fp\u2032 U (Cv) app,j,i\u03c6 (Cv) v,j (8)\nwhere U(C)app \u2208 RM \u2032 v\u00d7M \u2032v contains a set of vectors orthonormalized using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. In order to further reduce the dimension of the problem, N \u2032Cv eigenvectors can be retained using the so-called \u201cVSS parameter\u201d (see e.g. Fig. 5 of Ref.94 as an illustration).\nRecently, this procedure allowed computing rovibrational energy levels up to J = 120 for a seven atomic molecule48. However, \u03a8app,v are not eigenvectors of H (\u03930) v , strictly speaking but we can show that U (Cv) app,j,i \u2248 U (Cv) j,i (j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M \u2032v) in the energy range of many molecules where observation are available, making the second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (7) very small. Obviously, if p\u2032 = p then \u03a8app,v = \u03a8v and the \u201cusual\u201d procedure is applied.\nFinally, it can be shown that the rovibrational Hamiltonian matrix (4) reads\nH(J,C) \u2248 g \u2295 i=1 qi 6=0\n( E(Ci)v \u2297 Iqi ) + T\u22121v hrvTv, (9)\nwhere hrv is the matrix representation of H (\u03930) \u2212H(\u03930)v built in the rovibrational primitive basis of dimension M , g the number of classes of G and Tv a unitary transformation given by\nTv = g \u2295 i=1 qi 6=0\n( U(Ci)app \u2297 Iqi ) . (10)\nIn Eqs. (9) and (10), qi is a multiplicity index, that is the number of allowed vibrational basis functions \u03a6 (Ci) v which appear in the rovibrational functions of symmetry C. E (Ci) v is\na diagonal matrix which contains the variationally-computed energy levels Ev. To improve the \u201cquality\u201d of the eigensolutions of H(J,C), namely\n{Evr,\u03a8(J,C)vr = [U(J,C)]\u22121\u03a6vr}, (11)\nthe Ev values in Eq. (9) can be directly replaced by the observed levels, when available.\nAs an illustration, let us focus on the calculation of the energy levels of PH3 for the block\n(J = 3, E) using either (a) \u03a8 (Cv) v or (b) \u03a8 (Cv) app,v. More details about the construction of the\nmodel can be found in Section IV. The vibrational problem is solved using the basis F (14)\nwhich leads to symmetry blocks of dimensions MA1 = 6945, MA2 = 5985 and ME = 12915.\n(a) Without \u201creduction\u201d, the number of rovibrational primitive functions using the\npruned basis F (p = 14) is of 90435 for the block (J = 3, E). In the variational calcula-\ntion, we have retained only 5% of eigenvectors, that is Nv = 0.05Mv, leading to a final symmetry block of dimension 4522. The corresponding eigenvalues, which are all converged within 10\u22124 cm\u22121 up to 4800 cm\u22121 with respect to the calculation with Nv = Mv, are taken as benchmark. The variational calculation took 80 min on a computer with 28 processors.\n(b) The vibrational eigenvectors are now \u201creduced\u201d using a pruned basis F (p\u2032), with p\u2032 =8, 10 and 11, of dimensions (M \u2032A1 ,M \u2032 A2 ,M \u2032E)=(590,415,999), (1506,1170,2666) and (2290,1842,4122) and N \u2032v = 0.65M \u2032 v, N \u2032 v = 0.25M \u2032 v and N \u2032 v = 0.15M \u2032 v \u201capproximate\u201d eigenvectors are retained, respectively.

We can conclude that the reduction procedure proposed in Eqs. (7) and (8) gives\nquite good results and requires computation of much less matrix elements than in the \u201cfull\u201d\nproblem.

There exist many published papers dedicated to this task (see e.g. Refs.95\u2013100) and infinitely many\ntransformations bringing a given matrix into block diagonal form. The approach proposed\nby Cederbaum et al.101,102 to block-diagonalize Hermitian matrices turns out very relevant for this work. They required that the transformation TP \u201cchanges the initial matrix as little as possible\u201d which amounts to imposing the condition || TP \u2212 I ||=min where || . || is the Euclidean norm. This latter condition is sufficient to uniquely determine TP which is finally given by101\nTP = U(J,C)(U(J,C)BD )t [ U (J,C) BD (U (J,C) BD ) t ]\u22121/2 , (12)\nwhere U(J,C) is the eigenvector matrix of Eq. (11) and U (J,C) BD its non-singular, block-diagonal part related to the choice (1) or (2). The success of the method is mainly governed by the good extraction of U (J,C) BD from U (J,C) which has to be made with care for polyads that are not well isolated. In order to build (5) up to the polyad PNP , we proceed in two steps.\n1. Extraction of a single block containing all vibrational states up to PNP\nIn a first step, we want to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix in two blocks: a\nblock including all vibrational states and coupling terms from the polyad P0 to the polyad PNP and another one including all the \u201cremaining\u201d states beyond PNP . In order to properly define the block-diagonal part U (J,C) BD leading to this structure, we have to organize U (J,C) in a convenient manner. To this end, the M primitive rovibrational basis functions | \u03b3; J,C\u3009P which were used to build (9) are sorted in increasing values of P . The U(J,C) matrix is thus rearranged via a permutation Prow of its rows as ProwU(J,C) = U(J,C)r . If M \u2032 denotes the number of basis functions up to the polyad PNP , then we extract from Ur the first M \u2032 rows and form the new matrix Ur \u2208 RM \u2032\u00d7M . The M \u2032 relevant vectors of Ur associated with\nP0\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7PNP are chosen such that the trace \u2211M \u2032 i=1[U trUr]ii of the Gram matrix is maximal. This property can be obtained by applying a permutation Pcol of the columns. A new sorted matrix is written as\nU(J,C)r Pcol = U(J,C)s . (13)\nFinally, we can decompose the sorted matrix (13) as the sum of a block-diagonal and anti-\ndiagonal block part as\nU (J,C) s = UP0\u2212Nps 0 0 URs +  0 U12s U21s 0  = U (J,C) BD + U (J,C) ABD ,\n(14)\nComplete nuclear-motion Hamiltonian (input)\nHamiltonian matrix, Eq.

The anti-diagonal block contribution is removed by substituting U (J,C) s and U (J,C) BD in the transformation (12). One can show that the transformed eigenvector matrix reads\nU\u0303 (J,C) s = T \u22121P0\u2212NpU (J,C) s = UlV t r\n= U\u0303P0\u2212Nps 0 0 U\u0303Rs  , (15) where Ul and Vr are the left and right orthogonal matrices involved in the singular decomposition UBD = UlDV t r.

U\u0303Rs \u2208 RM\u2212M \u2032\u00d7M\u2212M \u2032 is the block which describes all the \u201cremaining\u201d polyads that are not of great interest for our purposes.

Usually, we start from an Hamil-\ntonian operator with known parameters and we compute the matrix elements to deduce\nits energy spectrum after diagonalization. Conversely, we start in this work from a known matrix H (J,C) Pk for a polyad Pk and we search for the corresponding effective Hamiltonian. Mathematically speaking, we have to deal with an inverse problem for determining a set of unknown parameters {s\u0303} = {s\u0303P0 , s\u0303P1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s\u0303PNp} of an effective operator H\u0303(s\u0303) by solving Eq. (6) for each Pk.\nIn the effective Hamiltonian theory, it is common to use creation-annihilation operators\nbecause the terms of the type a+mii a ni i must satisfy the resonance condition 84 \u2211 ci(mi\u2212ni) = 0 where the ci\u2019s are defined in (1). Within this condition, it is possible to write a formal Hamiltonian for each polyad by forming the \u03930-invariant polynomials as\nH\u0303(\u03930) = NP\u2211 i=0 hi\u2211 j=1 s\u0303j,Pi ( V \u2126v(\u0393) {\u03b1,Pi} \u2297R \u2126r(Kr,\u03b1r\u0393) )(\u03930) j\n= NP\u2211 i=1 hi\u2211 j=1 s\u0303j,PiO\u0303ij, (18)\nwhere V and R are vibrational and rotational operators of degree \u2126v and \u2126r in ai, a + i and in the total angular momentum components J\u03b1, respectively. Kr is the rank of the tensor in SO(3) and the parity in the conjugate momenta with = (\u22121)\u2126r because of the time\nreversal invariance. \u03b1 is a set of vibrational labels associated with each vibrational mode. More details about the construction of these tensor operators can be found elsewhere7,103. Using the so-called vibrational extrapolation scheme7, the effective Hamiltonian (18) for a\ngiven polyad contains the contributions of all lower polyads. In that case, the parameters\nspecific to the next polyad should be, in principle, only small corrections. The major limi-\ntation of the vibrational extrapolation is that spectra analysis has to be carried out polyad\nby polyad. For example, if we want to study the polyad P3 of a molecule, the polyads P0, P1 and P2 need generally to be studied before. In our approach, all the s\u0303 parameters are determined simultaneously.\nFinally, from Eqs. (6) and (18) the hk parameters s\u0303j,Pk specific to a polyad Pk can be determined iteratively by solving the overdetermined system of equations using the dgelsy\nroutine of LAPACK\nhk\u2211 j=1 s\u0303j,PkO\u0303ikm\u2032m = H (J,C,Pk) m\u2032m \u2212 k\u22121\u2211 i=1 hi\u2211 j=1 s\u0303j,PiO\u0303 ij m\u2032m, (19)\nwhere O\u0303ijm\u2032m are the matrix elements of O\u0303ij computed using the Wigner-Eckart theorem adapted to the point group. Only some low-J values will be sufficient to determine the\nfull set of parameters. As a rule, we have to compute the variational eigenpairs at least up to J = \u2126r/2 (resp. (\u2126r + 1)/2) if \u2126r even (resp. odd) such that number of equations\u2265 number of unknowns. In this work, the system (19) is first solved for the purely vibrational\npart to deduce the corresponding parameters. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (18) will\nreproduce exactly the variationally-computed or observed levels if \u2126v has been conveniently chosen. For example, if a polyad contains the band 4\u03bdi, then we should consider \u2126 max v = 8. As to the rovibrational part, the J > 0 levels of the Hamiltonian (18) whose parameters have\nbeen obtained by solving (19) will not match exactly those in Eq. (11) because convergence\nof the variational calculation is rarely fully achieved. This is in principle not an issue because\nthe major part of the resonance parameters will be fixed to their consistent ab initio values\nwhile only few ones will be slightly refined to observation. This strategy was already applied with success in the framework of CT (see e.g. Ref.104)."

We recall that the aim of this work is to present a new methodology and give a general overview\nof what our global ab initio EM can bring to improve the current models. Future spectra\nanalyses will be carried out with the help of specialists in the domain (i) who will use our\nparameters as input data in dedicated programs for spectra analysis and (ii) who will publish\nrefined spectroscopic parameters in dedicated papers in due time. Note that global effective\nmodel is often used in this paragraph instead of ab initio effective model in order to highlight\nthe difference with the empirical models which usually focus on small spectral regions.

A brief inspection of the harmonic frequencies would\nenergies (V) up to J = 8.

Up to 2000 cm\u22121, such a\nscheme works quite well but many \u201ceffective\u201d polyads overlap beyond with for instance the\nlow-lying energies of the polyad P9 far below those of the polyad P7. In this work, we choose c = {2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1} which obviously leads to bigger polyads but in turn to a more consistent treatment, at least up to 4000 cm\u22121. We have built two effective Hamiltonians (18) up to\nthe polyad P3 using the variational eigenpairs (11) up to J = 5 to solve (19). The first one was expanded up to \u2126v = 6 and \u2126r = 6 and the second one up to \u2126v = 8 and \u2126r = 6. They are composed respectively of 722 and 2740 irreducible tensor operators. Fig. 3a displays\nthe convergence error of the energy levels up to J = 8 for these two models with respect\nat T = 298 K is also given..\nto the variational calculation, taken as the benchmark. We can see that the errors between effective and variational calculation are below 10\u22123 cm\u22121 up to 3000 cm\u22121 and \u223c10\u22123 up to 5000 cm\u22121 when \u2126maxv = 8. The results are thus quite similar, except that energy level calculation took less than 1 min up to J = 40 using the effective model against few hours\nfrom the variational approach. A comparison between the reduced energy levels obtained from our global model and from those used to build HITRAN3 is given in Fig. 3 (panels b &\nc). Unlike traditional empirical EMs, we can see that our model can predict all bright and\ndark states, here up to the polyad P3, and could predict other ones far beyond if necessary.\n\u2022 PH3: Previous calculations were published for this molecule107. Here, we have considered the PES and DMS of Refs.108,109 where the quadratic force constants have been slightly\nrefined for this work and the geometry fixed to re = 1.4119002 A\u030a, \u03b1e = 93.39082 degrees using the optimization procedure described in Ref.26. A variational calculation was carried out in the C3v point group using the normal mode model 18\u219210 and the basis 17\u219210 up to J = 5. Unlike H2CO, the PH3 molecule exhibits a clear polyad structure with a resonance scheme 2:1:2:1. Using this polyad model, the effective Hamiltonian (18) was expanded at order 10 up to P5 with \u2126v \u2264 10 and \u2126r \u2264 8 and the resulting 10415 rovibrational parameters have been determined by solving (19). Tab. I gives a comparison between some effective\nground state and dyad parameters s\u0303 derived from Eq. (19) and obtained from a fit. We can\nsee that the initial parameters s\u0303 only need to be slightly refined to reproduce high-resolution\ndata.\nConcerning the line intensity calculation, the effective dipole moment (21) was built at\norder 6 with \u2126r \u2264 2 to account for all transitions Pi \u2190 Pj (i, j=0,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,5). The corresponding 8519 parameters were determined from the variationally-computed transitions up to J =\n2. We thus obtain the first global effective model for PH3 up to P5 whereas the current spectroscopic models derived from high-resolution analysis these past three decades are available only up to P3 110\u2013112. Due to its completeness, our model will be used for the analysis of P4 and P5 as well as for the construction of hot line lists for astrophysical applications. In order to validate this model, Fig. 4(a) shows the convergence of the rovibrational levels\nup to J = 8 using the Hamiltonian (18) at order 6, 8 and 10, with respect to the variational\nenergies in the P4 region. The two other panels in Fig. 4 show a comparison of both line positions and line intensities up to J = 15 in the P4 region between our effective model and the variational calculation. We can see a very good agreement between these two approaches, even for small transitions (say < 10\u221223 cm/molecule) with errors on the line\nintensities below 0.1%. Fig. 5 gives an overview of the spectrum up to P5 computed from our global model (18) and (21). In this figure, the consistency of our model is clearly seen\nfrom a direct comparison of the theoretical absorption spectrum for the polyad P4 with experimental PNNL records105.\n\u2022 12CH4: We started from the ab initio model described in Ref.114 using the PES and DMS of Refs.115,116. As for PH3, the methane polyad scheme is quite clear and is also given by the resonance scheme 2:1:2:1. In this work, a very first global effective model beyond tetradecad (P4) 117 was built using an effective Hamiltonian expanded at order 8, up to \u2126r = 4 (7912 parameters) and an effective dipole moment at order 5 with \u2126r \u2264 2 (522 parameters), only for cold band transitions. A higher-order expansion in \u2126r will be easily carried out for practical studies. The first global predictions of 12CH4 (Td) spectra in the icosad (P5) and triacontad (P6) regions using an effective model are given in Fig. 6. Some observed energy levels for low-J values in the icosad (P5) determined from the partial assignment29 of the Grenoble WKLMC experimental line list113 have been directly replaced\nin Eq. (16). In the next polyad (P6), the big deviations on line positions are partly explained by the \u201cpoor\u201d accuracy (of \u223c0.1\u22121 cm\u22121) of the PES115 in this region. Though most of the\nline will deserve to be refined in position, the agreement with high-resolution experimental\nspectra remains quite good, in particular if we remember that the complete modelling of\nroom-temperature methane spectra up to the tetradecad (P4) took more than forty years. Undoubtedly, our model will allow to complete the current assignments in the regions above\nP5 118,119 in a shorter time.\n\u2022 12C2H4: Several studies were focused on ethylene36,120\u2013122 and an accurate line list was built44. Here, we start from the variational calculation performed in the D2h point group which is based on the PES and DMS of Refs.123,124 and described in detail in Ref.125. This molecule is the typical case where the choice (1) is unclear beyond 2000 cm\u22121, so the energy criterion (2) was used to define the successive polyads up to 5000 cm\u22121. For example, the polyad P1 falls in the region [800, 1050] cm \u22121 and contains 4 vibrational states, P8 belongs to [2785, 3390] cm\u22121 and has 52 vibrational states while P13 \u2208 [4100, 4850] cm\u22121 and has 251 vibrational states. Such a polyad scheme can be customized by the user who can add\noretical absorption spectrum for the P8 (panel b) and P13 (panel c) polyad with experimental medium resolution PNNL records105 at T = 298 K is given. In panels (d) and (e), detailed por-\ntions of the ethylene spectra in the P2 and P5 regions, respectively, and comparison with the PNNL experimental database105.\nor remove vibrational states quite easily. The panel (a) in Fig. 7 gives an overview of the ethylene spectrum up to 5000 cm\u22121 between our calculated EM and those used to generate HITRAN2020. The panels (b\u2212e) show the very good agreement between our calculated spectra in the P2, P5, P8 and P13 regions and the PNNL databases 105 and Fig. 8 illustrates the so-called vibrational extrapolation. In this figure, the \u201cglobal EM P13\u201d corresponds\nlene using the full P13 model and the P8 model extrapolated up to P13 (see text).\nto the full effective model up to P13 whereas the \u201cglobal EM P8\u201d contains spectroscopic parameters only up to P8 but was used to generate the P13 spectrum by extrapolation. As expected, the agreement of the P13 model with experiment is better though the P8 model gives reasonable results despite fewer parameters (16081 for P13 vs. 4157 for P8).\nOnce again, a first \u201cglobal\u201d effective model is presented for this molecule, both for line\npositions and line intensities. For example, our model takes into account 52 interacting\nvibrational bands in the 3 \u00b5m region, which is to be compared to the 4 bands included in\nthe current HITRAN database. In the present EM, the resonances between all bright and\ndark states induce intensity transfers that cannot be properly described using the available\nempirical effective Hamiltonians. We can note that the variational calculation presented in Ref.125 up to 6400 cm\u22121 and J = 71 took five days using 96 processors while the computed\nspectra up to J = 40 in Fig. 7 were built on a laptop in 1 hour only.\n\u2022 32SF6: We conclude this work by an illustration on the 32SF6 (Oh) molecule for which completeness is crucial. Here, the PES and DMS of Ref.126 were employed and the Hamiltonian model as well as the choice of the basis functions were described in Ref.48. According to the six harmonic frequencies, we have fixed the polyad vector (1) as c = {2.3, 1.8, 2.8, 1.5, 1}.\nIn order to take into account all the cold and hot band transitions falling in the strongest\nabsorption region around 10 \u00b5m, a polyad model up to P24 has been constructed.

The resulting 9773 parameters have been determined from the variational eigenpairs up to J = 10. The dipole moment has been expanded at order 5 and\ncontains all operators corresponding to the cold and hot bands having the strongest integrated intensities, as tabulated in Supplementary Material of Ref.48. A set of 4311 effective\ndipole moment parameters has been determined from variationally-computed transitions up\nto J = 2. Fig. 9a shows a comparison of both line positions and line intensities up to J = 80 in the P7 region between our effective model and the variational calculation of Ref. 48.\nThe most extensive empirical \u201cglobal\u201d model to date contains only 13 vibrational bands127,128 and has been used to generate the SF6 HITRAN database (see Fig. 9b,c). In this work, hundreds of cold and hot bands have been generated in 5 hours up to J = 120.\nThe very good agreement with PNNL in Fig. 9c validates the construction of our effective\nHamiltonian (18) and dipole moment (21). We can conclude that all the missing hot bands\nin HITRAN-like databases cannot provide good opacity calculations required for accurate\natmospheric applications."

            "text": "To summarize, our TENSOR computer code initially designed for variational calcula-\ntions is now able to manage EMs for spectra analyses. More generally, the steps 2 & 3\nin Section III, namely the block-diagonalization procedure and the construction of effective\nHamiltonians, could be also implemented in most of the variational computer codes. For\nusers who do not feel comfortable with the theory of irreducible tensor operators, the Hamil-\ntonian (18) and dipole moment (21) could be easily replaced either by the standard Watson formalism5 or by another one. Alternatively, the parameters involved in different formalisms\ncould be linked together, as shown in Appendix A. Unlike Van Vleck perturbation theory,\nwe have shown that the present numerical approach obviates the need to know explicitly\nthe rotation-vibration algebra, with sometimes very involved calculations.\nWe have demonstrated that the proposed effective model can provide crucial information\nto spectroscopists (e.g. a good set of initial parameters) within a very short time and is a\nclear alternative to more traditional spectroscopic models if, for a given molecule, the ab ini-\ntio surfaces are available. So far, only variational calculations were able to provide complete\nmolecular line lists for different temperature and spectral ranges contrary to empirical EMs\nwhich are able to make accurate but quite \u201clocalized\u201d predictions. Finally, the contribution\nof the proposed effective approach is threefold: (1) it is much less demanding than perform-\ning a full variational calculation, (2) it allows computing very rapidly and simultaneously all the cold (Pi \u2190 P0) and hot (Pi \u2190 Pk) band transitions up to a given polyad and (3) the parameters can be refined much more easily. Undoubtedly, this model brings a new\ninsight into high-resolution spectra analysis and will be of great help, not only in current\nor future infrared spectra analyses of polyatomic molecules but also in the modelling of hot\natmospheres for which completeness is crucial.\nFor future studies, the case of nonrigid molecules exhibiting one or several inversion or\ninternal rotation motions could be considered. Numerous papers dealing with the construc-\ntion of empirical effective models for nonrigid molecules have been published these past four decades (see e.g. Refs.129\u2013133 and references therein). We could imagine that the nonrigid\ncounterpart of (18) can be also derived in the same fashion using a convenient polyad scheme and parametrization134. We will show in a forthcoming study that the tensorial Hamiltonian (18) can be formulated in the Hougen-Bunker-Johns (HBJ) formalism135 by making the substitution s\u0303\u2192 s\u0303(\u03c1) where \u03c1 is a large amplitude curvilinear coordinate. The effective\nparameters for the rigid motions will be determined on a numerical grid \u03c1i. Coordinate transformations in the framework of HBJ as well as choice of the axis system where the\nangular momentum due to the large amplitude motion vanishes or is of constant magnitude have been recently discussed136,137. The first candidate will be the NH3 molecule for which accurate PESs have been recently constructed138.\nAnother point concerns the construction of a \u201cfull\u201d curvilinear EM. This could be done for example by using the curvilinear creation-annihilation operators A and A+ introduced in Ref.139. Other formalisms like those implemented in GENIUSH15 or TROVE12 could possibly\nbenefit from the present study while anharmonic basis functions (Morse, etc.) associated with generalized ladder operators140,141 could replace the harmonic oscillator basis functions."

            "text": "Irreducible tensor operators are great tools to deal with symmetry for both Abelian and\nnon-Abelian point groups but in turn may appear as abstract mathematical objects for many users. We can show that any rovibrational tensor operator T (\u0393)i\u03c3 = ( V \u2126v(\u0393v) {\u03b1,Pi} \u2297R \u2126r(Kr,\u03b1r\u0393r) )(\u0393) i\u03c3 can be expressed in terms of \u201cstandard\u201d vibrational (X, Y ) = (q, p), (a+, a) or (S,\u2212id/dS)\nand rotational (Jx, Jy, Jz) or (J+, J+, Jz) operators of degree \u2126v and \u2126r, respectively. It is common to write these operators in a normally-ordered form. Typically, if we know the structure constants ckij of a Lie algebra (e.g. Heinsenberg-Weyl, so(n), su(n), su(m,n), etc.), defined by a set of generators G1, G2, etc. satisfying the commutation rules [Gi, Gj] = c k ijGk, any linear combination of arbitrary powers of Gi can be normally ordered as\n(\u03b2Gn1G m 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b3Gr1Gl2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 )p = \u2211 m1m2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7mk Tm1m2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7mkG m1 1 G ml 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7G mk k . (A1)\nSuch ordering is greatly simplified with the aid of symbolic calculation where non commu-\ntative objects can be now easily manipulated. Eq. (A1) helped us to express the rotational tensors R\u2126r(Kr,nr\u0393r) in terms of angular momentum components. For example, a rovibra-\ntional coupling term for the \u03bd4 band of a D3h molecule reads \u2212i ( V 2(A\u20322)\n{\u03bd4\u03bd4,2} \u2297R 3(3,0A\u20322)\n)(A\u20321) =\n4\u221a 5\n( Jz + 2J 3 z \u2212 3(J2x + J2y )Jz)(a +(E\u2032) 4b a (E\u2032) 4a \u2212 a +(E\u2032) 4a a (E\u2032) 4b ) ) .\nEq. (A1) could be also used for the derivation of the structure constants of the rotational\nalgebra supplemented by the direction cosines \u03bb\u03b8,\u03b1, involved for example in dipole moment contact transformations.\nFinally, ifMi denotes an operator of the type ( \u220f kX mik k Y nik k )J mi\u03b1 \u03b1 J mi\u03b2 \u03b2 J mi\u03b3 \u03b3 , with (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) =\n(x, y, z) or (+,\u2212, z), the TENSOR computer code is able to expand each rovibrational tensor in elementary operators (see Eq. (21) of Ref.139) and find the transformation C such that\nT = CM, (A2)\nwhatever the order \u2126v + \u2126r and the point group G. Here T and M are two vectors which contains the elements T (\u0393)i\u03c3 and Mi, respectively. In order to properly invert Eq. (A2), we must consider all the \u0393-covariant tensors. For example, in the case of C3v species the vector T is composed of T (A1)i , T (A2) i , T (E) ia and T (E) ib . We can thus write\nM = C\u22121T , (A3)\nso that any Hamiltonian H\u0303(Xi, Yi, J\u03b1, J\u03b2, J\u03b3; t\u0303) can be transformed like (18) and hundreds of rovibrational parameters t\u0303 and s\u0303 can be linked together in few seconds by solving linear\nsystems of equations. We write t\u0303i = \u2211 i cij s\u0303i , s\u0303i = \u2211 i dij t\u0303i. (A4) Note that a recent paper142 provides relations between some rotational parameters involved\nin the tensorial and Watson formalisms for a limited number of point groups whereas illus-\ntrative examples were already given elsewhere for the vibration-rotation Hamiltonian (see Eqs. (31)-(33) of Ref.143 and Tab. 1 and Eqs. (28)-(29) of Ref.144). The same holds for the derivation of dipole moment parameters (see e.g. Eqs. (54)-(55) of Ref.145). Obviously, the\ntransformation (A2) or (A3) can be provided upon request.\nSometimes, calculations are not performed in the highest symmetry point group but in one\nof its subgroups. If for example methane is treated in C2v instead of Td our procedure allows converting any C2v operator to a better suited symmetry-adapted form. The components of the total angular momentum in the C2v (x \u2032, y\u2032, z\u2032) frame can be thus expressed as a linear combination of rotational Td tensor operators as\nC2v Td Jz\u2032 = \u2212 12\u221a2 ( R 1(1,F1) x \u2212R1(1,F1)y ) , J2z\u2032 = \u2212 \u221a 6 24 R 2(2,E) a \u2212 \u221a 2 8 R 2(2,F2) z \u2212 \u221a 3 12 R2(0,A1), Jx\u2032Jz\u2032 = \u2212 i \u221a 2 8 ( R 1(1,F1) x +R 1(1,F1) y ) ,\n\u2212 1 8\n( R 2(2,F2) x \u2212R2(2,F2)y ) ,\nJy\u2032Jz\u2032 = i 4 R 1(1,F1) x +\n\u221a 2\n8 R 2(2,E) b ,\nJ3x\u2032 = R 1(1,F1) z +\n\u221a 27\n40 R\n3(1,F1) z +\n\u221a 10\n40 R\n3(3,F1) z ,\n(A5)\nand so on. The vibrational part could be also transformed in this way and other point groups could be considered (see e.g. Ref.145 where the link between C3v and Td was clearly established)."
