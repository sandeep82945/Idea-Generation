Originally from France, Sedbon studied design at the University of the Arts in London before spending several years as an interactive artist and designer. His work has made the rounds at festivals and won awards like the STARTS prize of the European Commission and the Lumens Prize. Now he\u2019s back in school, studying synthetic biology at CRI in Paris.\nThe cover, as well as Figures 1\u20133, are from Sedbon\u2019s project, CTRL, an installation in which ten Physarum Polycephalum\u2014unicellular organisms also known as slime molds\u2014send control signals to a machine running Conway\u2019s Game of Life. Developed by British mathematician John Conway, the Game of Life is a cellular automaton, a grid of cells that evolves by itself via rules based on various initial conditions.\nSedbon built the CTRL environment to monitor the slime mold activity via electrical potential differences.

Even though it is unicellular\nand thus without a central nervous system or brainlike infrastructure, it does exhibit a sense of locomotion, giving it a type of decentralized intelligence. Computer scientists have studied slime molds for years, just for this reason.\n\u201cPeople who study cognition use this organism as a model to conduct basic experiments to derive a theory about how computing exists in biology,\u201d Sedbon says. \u201cIt does locomotion, which is one behavior usually associated with animals or things that have brains.\u201d\nThus, the title of the piece, CTRL, provides double, if not triple meanings. Who or what is in control? Is the computer controlling the biological world or vice versa? Can biology be triggered to evolve in the same way, with the same results, as when electrical circuits are controlled? Can digital systems accurately mimic biological systems? Can societies be controlled in the same way that hardware or software stacks are controlled? Who or what controls the possibility of immortality? What about free will? All of these questions emerge from such a simple project.\nTHE ORIGINS OF CTRL Sedbon discusses other projects at length in this issue\u2019s Art on Graphics section (see page 58). For CTRL, he says the influence came from his own basic interest in the histories of both computer science and biology.\n\u201cIt was really clear to me that since the beginning, when we started to make computers, like modern computers, let\u2019s say the late 19th century, most of what we were trying to do was biomimicry,\u201d Sedbon says. \u201cSo for me, it looked like the first goal was to make some sort of artificial intelligence since the very, very beginning. And this artificial intelligence was mostly trying to reproduce what we can see in things we usually consider intelligent, like animals, or things that are biological.\u201d\nIn a sense, computers were always trying to imitate biology, he says. The man was always trying to conquer nature. Even today, though, as people continue to build computers and robots inspired by biological paths, the results are never quite what anyone expects. No one can truly control the outcome. 0272-1716 2022 IEEE Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/MCG.2022.3211405 Date of current version 13 December 2022.\nNovember/December 2022 Published by the IEEE Computer Society IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 5\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was looking at,\u201d Sedbon says. \u201cHow culture and knowledge in biology influenced culture, knowledge and the tools of computer science. That was the beginning of it.\u201d\nThe beginning of CTRL, one could say. The problem is that the real biological world features all sorts of extraneous noise that actually plays a more important role, and a more fun role, in the evolution of processes. Slime molds, for example, are quite noisy and indeterministic, so connecting them to a very deterministic process like the Game of Life, becomes an interplay of opposites, a balance between control and indeterminacy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also true of other kinds of systems\u2014social systems or human systems,\u201d Sedbon says. \u201cLike things that involve humans in their activity. For example, one of the biggest assumptions of design and architecture is that if you produce spaces or devices that are for\nsome [specific] uses, then your user is going to use it this way. However, we know that\u2019s not true. History has proven that cities are not used in the way that the city planners think about it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s beautiful about them.\u201d\nELECTRO-GENETICS Right now, Sedbon is taking a break from art and design to focus more on engineering. In particular, he spends more time on synthetic biology projects. He enthusiastically talks of another subject area, that of electro-genetics, a set of tools that allow electricity to interact with bacteria.\n\u201cThis means that you could give an electrical input to bacteria and trigger the expression of some genes,\u201d he says. \u201cThese genes do some biochemical processing inside the cells and output an electrical signal that you\u2019ll be able to retrieve electronically with a microcontroller. In of itself, this turns the population of bacteria into bioelectronic components.\u201d\nSo instead of a normal electronic component, a material object, transforming a signal, which can then be assembled into a circuit, we would see biochemical processes transforming the signal. We would see bacteria converted into a circuit board. The artistic potential is enormous.\nIn the end, Sedbon may or may not end up measuring slime molds again. If he does, it would be for a project more like his other work, focusing on the slime\u2019s potential for memory storage. Nevertheless, the Physarums are fun to take care of.\n\u201cThey make good pets,\u201d he says.\nGARY SINGH lives and works in San Jose, CA, USA.
