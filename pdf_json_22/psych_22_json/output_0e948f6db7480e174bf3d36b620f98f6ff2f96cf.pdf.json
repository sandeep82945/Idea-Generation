            "text": "Numerous studies link sleep characteristics to cognitive performance and subsequent decline in older adults, as well as to diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia (Devore et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018). Less is known, however, about associations of circadian rhythms with subsequent cognitive decline among cognitively healthy older adults. Many physiological processes (e.g., core body temperature, melatonin, and cortisol secretion) follow a circadian rhythm; they cycle approximately once every 24 h under endogenous control of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and are synchronized with the light/dark cycle through environmental cues, including bright light and feeding (Zee et al., 2013; Lananna and Musiek, 2020). Characteristic changes in circadian rhythms occur with aging. Circadian rest/activity rhythms (CRARs), estimated from continuously collected wrist actigraphy data, are routinely used as a proxy measure of circadian rhythms in human research. Aging is associated with decreases in CRAR amplitude (i.e., reductions in the magnitude of difference in activity between active and rest phases) and phase advances (i.e., earlier daily peaks in activity), both of which may have consequences for cognitive functioning in later life (Krishnan and Lyons, 2015; Musiek et al., 2018) [Definitions of standard CRAR metrics are presented in Table 1].\nAlthough several cross-sectional studies have linked altered CRARs to cognitive function in older adults (Krishnan and Lyons, 2015), findings have been mixed. For example,\nOosterman et al. (2009), Luik et al. (2015), and Yang et al. (2022) found that greater rhythm fragmentation [intradaily variability (IV)] was associated with poorer global cognition and performance on tests of executive function, although Yang et al. (2022) also observed a negative association between IV and memory performance. Oosterman et al. (2009) and Yang et al. (2022) also found that weaker CRARs (i.e., lower amplitude and relative amplitude) were associated with poorer performance on tests of memory, executive function, auditory attention, and global cognition. Yi Lee et al. (2021), however, found no\nTABLE 1 Definitions of circadian rest activity rhythm (CRAR) indices.\nDefinition\nCosinor indices\nAmplitude Difference between the minimum and maximum activity value\nMesor Average activity over 24 h\nAcrophase Time of maximum activity counts over 24 h\nNon-parametric indices\nRelative amplitude (RA) Metric of rhythm strength; normalized difference between most active 10 h and least active 5 h\nInterdaily stability (IS) Stability of activity profiles over days\nIntradaily variability (IV) Fragmentation of the rhythm relative to its 24-h amplitude\nL5 time Midpoint of an individual\u2019s L5 interval\nM10 time Midpoint of an individual\u2019s M10 interval\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\nassociation of rhythm strength metrics (i.e., mesor, amplitude) or circadian timing (i.e., acrophase) with dementia or MCI status at baseline. Longitudinal studies examining CRARs with subsequent change in cognitive performance have found that metrics indicative of lower rhythm strength (i.e., mesor, amplitude) and delayed rhythm timing (i.e., later acrophase) were associated with greater declines in global cognition and executive function (Walsh et al., 2014; Rogers-Soeder et al., 2018; Yi Lee et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022a,b), and increased risk for MCI and dementia (Xiao et al., 2022b). Other work has shown that greater IV at baseline and greater increases in IV were associated with greater declines in global cognition, and that lower RA and IS, and higher IV at baseline was associated with greater risk for developing incident cognitive impairments among older adult men (Xiao et al., 2022a). Li et al. (2020) also found that greater increases in IS and amplitude and slower decreases in IV were associated with slower global cognitive decline. Taken together, the majority of the literature has linked greater CRAR fragmentation, weaker rhythm strength, and greater phase delay with greater risk for poor cognitive performance and faster cognitive decline.\nIn the present study, we sought to address several gaps in the literature. First, most longitudinal studies of CRARcognition associations have examined a single measure of global cognitive function and, at most, one other cognitive measure. The examination of associations of CRARs with multiple cognitive domains has the potential to elucidate associations that might be obscured when using a global cognitive composite. Second, few studies have examined associations of cognitive outcomes with both parametric cosinor and non-parametric CRAR metrics. Whereas parametric cosinor approaches assume that CRARs can be adequately modeled with a cosine function, non-parametric methods do not make such distributional assumptions and can be a more flexible modeling approach. Third, no studies to our knowledge have evaluated whether age, sex, race, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modify associations between CRARs and cognitive function or change. Women (Mazure and Swendsen, 2016), people of color (Mayeda et al., 2016), older age groups (Xia et al., 2018), and APOE e4 allele carriers (Wolfe et al., 2018) are at heightened risk for MCI and dementia. However, the extent to which these demographic and genetic factors interact with CRAR characteristics to influence their association with cognitive health remains unknown.\nTo address the aforementioned gaps, we investigated associations of CRARs (including standard parametric cosinor and non-parametric metrics) with cognitive performance and change in cognitive performance over time in five cognitive domains in middle-aged and older adults who were cognitively normal at baseline. We hypothesized that weaker, more fragmented, less stable, and more phase-delayed rhythms would be associated with poorer cognitive performance at baseline and greater decline in performance over time. We also explored\nwhether these associations differed as a function of participant age, sex, race, and APOE e4 allele carrier status."

This device logs movement in activity counts and records ambient light levels using a built-in accelerometer and photometer, respectively. While wearing the actigraph, participants were instructed to complete sleep diaries each morning and evening, in which they recorded information including the times they got into bed at night with the intention of sleeping (i.e., \u201clights out\u201d) and when they got up to start their day, and the timing of any naps and any actigraph removal. They were also instructed to press an event-marker button on the watch at lights out and upon getting up to start the day. We used event-marker, sleep diary, and ambient light level data to identify the in-bed intervals, to which we applied a validated algorithm (Kushida et al., 2001) to derive sleep parameters using Actiware v. 6.0.9 software (Philips Respironics).\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org\nActigraphic activity count data were preprocessed using R software Version 4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2020). First, we removed 24-h periods with > 5% (>72 min) of data missing. Second, we log-transformed the activity counts (AC) to create a more symmetric distribution. Third, we averaged the log-transformed AC within 144 distinct 10-min bins. Fourth, we estimated the mean subject-specific rest activity rhythms by averaging the daily curves over the days for which valid actigraphy data were collected. In all analyses, the mean subject-specific rest activity rhythm was reflected in 144, 10-min log-transformed ACs.\nCosinor circadian rest-activity rhythm metrics\nWe computed standard parametric cosinor CRAR metrics, which are based on the assumption that CRARs reflect a cosine curve (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003), using the \u201ccosinor\u201d package1 in R (R Core Team, 2020). These included two measures of rhythm strength, namely amplitude (peak-to-trough difference) and mean of estimated cosinor curve (mesor; average activity level), and acrophase (timing of peak activity), a measure of circadian timing (i.e., \u201cphase\u201d) (de Feijter et al., 2020).\nNon-parametric circadian rest-activity rhythm metrics\nWe also calculated non-parametric circadian indices using the \u201cActCR\u201d package2 in R (R Core Team, 2020), given that CRARs do not always manifest a cosinor (parametric) shape. Specifically, we computed: relative amplitude (RA; rhythm strength); interdaily stability (IS; consistency of rhythm across days); intradaily variability (IV; within-day rhythm fragmentation); midpoint of an individual\u2019s total activity during the least active continuous 5 h (L5 time); and midpoint of an individual\u2019s total activity during the most active continuous 10 h (M10 time) (de Feijter et al., 2020)."

All continuous variables, except time, were z-scored (M = 0, SD = 1) prior to model fitting. To investigate the association of baseline CRARs with cognitive performance at baseline and rate of subsequent change in performance, we fit separate linear mixed-effects models with one cognitive domain composite as the outcome and one cosinor or non-parametric circadian rhythm parameter as the primary predictor.\nWe fit partially and fully adjusted regression models to examine associations of baseline CRARs with cognitive outcomes. In addition to a CRAR parameter, time of follow up in years, and the interaction between the CRAR parameter and time, Model 1 included baseline age, sex, race, years of education, and interactions between time and each of these covariates. In these models, the main effect of a CRAR parameter reflects the cross-sectional association between the CRAR metric and cognitive performance at baseline; the CRAR parameter\u2217time interaction reflects the longitudinal association of each CRAR metric with change in cognitive performance over time. Model 2 included all variables in Model 1, as well as baseline BMI, cardiovascular disease burden, smoking status, sleep medication use, CES-D score (minus the sleep item), APOE e4 carrier status, and interactions between these covariates and time.\nWe also examined whether age, sex, race, and APOE e4 carrier status moderated cross-sectional associations of CRARs with cognitive functioning and longitudinal associations of CRAR metrics with cognitive change by entering twoway interactions between each potential moderator and primary predictor variables, and three-way interactions (moderator\u2217primary predictor\u2217time) simultaneously in fully adjusted models. When there was a three-way interaction, all lower-order terms were included in the model. Baseline age was modeled as continuous variable.

Several main effect associations of CRARs with cognitive outcomes were observed. For example, lower rhythm strength (i.e., interdaily stability) was associated with greater declines in memory, which parallels findings from Xiao et al. (2022a) in which individuals with lower interdaily stability were more likely to develop incident cognitive impairments. In minimally adjusted\nmodels, we also observed a marginally significant association of greater rhythm strength (i.e., amplitude) with slower declines in executive function, paralleling previous findings observed in work conducted by Walsh et al. (2014). There were few main effects, however, in comparison to the numerous interactions we observed between participant characteristics (i.e., age, sex, race, and APOE e4 carrier status) and CRARs with respect to cognitive outcomes. These findings highlight the complexity of CRAR-cognition associations and the importance of considering these participant characteristics when studying links of CRARs with cognitive function and decline.\nWe observed several interactions of age and CRARs, with consistently opposite associations observed at age 65 vs. age 85.

Measures of greater rhythm strength (i.e., amplitude, mesor), greater consistency (i.e., IS), and lower fragmentation (i.e., IV) were associated with slower language declines at age 85; however, some of these associations were null or reversed at age 65. Although these findings are consistent with prior research linking lower CRAR strength to incident MCI and dementia in women with a mean age of 83 (Tranah et al., 2011), it is unclear why the effect would be opposite at an earlier age. As one possible explanation, in the younger old, among whom neurodegeneration has more recently begun, CRARs may have effects on cognitive performance that are independent of neurodegenerative disease. In the older old, however, among whom neurological deficits may be more advanced, neurological changes may be a shared cause of both CRAR alterations and\ncognitive impairment. This may account for the differences we observed. Alternatively, participants who have been retained in the study over time may be healthy compared to those who dropped out (potentially for health-related reasons). In other words, survival bias may account for some of the differences in CRAR-cognition associations among age groups. On the other hand, if CRARs are in fact causing cognitive decline, our findings would suggest that intervening on CRARs may have different effects on cognition at different ages. Further work in this area is needed, including studies investigating mechanisms that link CRARs to cognition across the life course.\nThere was also evidence that associations of CRARs and cognitive performance differed as a function of sex.

For example, lower rhythm fragmentation (i.e., lower IV) predicted slower declines in visuospatial performance in Black participants, but not White participants. Several studies demonstrate a higher incidence of dementia among Black older adults relative to White older adults (Tang et al., 2001; Mayeda et al., 2016), and differences in the incidence rates of dementia may be partially driven by documented racial differences in CRARs. For example, compared to White older adults, Black older adults tend to have weaker rhythm strength (i.e., lower amplitude, lower IS) (Mitchell et al., 2017). Differences in CRARs among Black adults and White adults may be due to a host of socioeconomic factors (e.g., occupation, neighborhood conditions) emanating\nfrom historical and contemporary forms of structural racism and discrimination that likely increase psychological stress, lead to physiological arousal, and subsequently adversely affect sleep/wake patterns (Jackson et al., 2013; Slopen et al., 2016; Gaston et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2021). Importantly, our findings suggest that circadian rhythmicity is a more important predictor of change over time in cognitive functioning among Black, compared to White, middle-aged and older adults. Interventions aimed at improving cognitive health in Black adults should also consider targeting CRARs, as well as modifiable social and environmental exposures (e.g., poverty, discrimination), in this population. Such an approach has the potential to reduce widespread health disparities in agingrelated diseases (Jackson et al., 2021).\nWe observed numerous interactions of APOE e4 carrier status with CRARs in relation to cognitive performance and decline such that the association of CRARs with cognitive outcomes were stronger among APOE e4 carriers relative to non-carriers. The APOE e4 allele has been linked to poorer\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org\ncognitive performance and greater cognitive decline in older adults (Nilsson et al., 2006; Brewster et al., 2014; Zhen et al., 2017; Todd et al., 2018; Gharbi-Meliani et al., 2021), and APOE e4 may increase vulnerability to cognitive effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology (Weigand et al., 2021). Other research conducted in the BLSA found differences in the association of the APOE e4 and cognition based on age and sex (Williams et al., 2019). To our knowledge, no studies have examined APOE genotype-CRAR interactions with change in cognition over time. However, findings from animal models indicate that APOE e4 allelic variation in mice may contribute to alterations in circadian rhythms (Graybeal et al., 2015). Regardless, our findings suggest that associations of CRARs (i.e., weaker rhythm strength) and cognitive decline are more robust among APOE e4 carriers. Although the mechanisms of this interaction are unclear, findings may reflect a dual vulnerability in which the combination of higher genetic liability for AD and specific CRAR patterns may confer greater risk for cognitive decline. Further studies are needed to investigate the extent to which persons at high genetic risk for AD are susceptible to negative cognitive effects of circadian disruption. Notably, prior research in the BLSA has linked APOE genotype to self-reported measures of shorter sleep duration (Spira et al., 2017). Further studies investigating associations of APOE and other AD risk genes with actigraphic sleep and CRARs are needed.\nThe present study has important strengths. To our knowledge, it is the first study to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of parametric and non-parametric actigraphic CRAR metrics with performance and change across multiple cognitive domains in middle-aged and older adults, and the first to explore whether these associations differ as a function of age, sex, race, and APOE e4 carrier status. Moderation analyses revealed that associations of CRARs with cognitive performance and decline were generally stronger among older adults aged 85, women, Black participants, and APOE e4 carriers. Future work is needed to examine the effects of interventions targeting circadian rhythms [e.g., bright light exposure (Klerman et al., 2001), melatonin (Zisapel, 2018), scheduled activity (Safi and Hodgson, 2014)] on cognitive performance and change in older adults in general, and in these subgroups in particular, given our findings suggest they may be more vulnerable to cognitive effects of circadian alterations. These effects may include dementia due to various etiologies, including AD. Future studies with larger samples are needed to replicate our observed pattern of results, but with MCI and dementia as outcomes and inclusion of AD biomarkers to elucidate the potential mediating neurodegenerative disease process.\nDespite these strengths, this study has limitations that must be considered. Because this is the first cross-sectional and prospective study of both parametric and non-parametric CRAR metrics and multiple domains of cognition and key interactions, we erred on the side of multiple testing to avoid Type II error. Consequently, our results may include false positives due to\nmultiple comparisons. Second, our sample consisted primarily of participants with a high level of education, all of whom were very healthy at enrollment; thus, results may not generalize to the broader population of older adults. Both limitations necessitate replication of our findings in independent cohorts more representative of the general population of middleaged and older adults. In addition, the number of days of actigraphy data collection was relatively small. Future research should collect actigraphic data over a longer duration of time, which would allow for more accurate estimates of participants\u2019 CRAR parameters. In addition, future work should examine interactions of actigraphic sleep parameters and CRARs in predicting cognition over time.\nIn sum, our findings demonstrate that CRARs are generally more strongly associated with cognitive performance and change among older individuals, women, Black adults, and APOE e4 carriers. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying these differential associations, and whether individuals in these populations are more likely than those from other populations to derive cognitive benefits from CRAR-based interventions."
