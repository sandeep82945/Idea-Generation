    "abstractText": "Herein, an ultra-sensitive and facile electrochemical biosensor for procalcitonin (PCT) detection was developed based on NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. Firstly, NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were synthesized using hydrothermal methods and then functionalized on the electrode surface by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Afterward, the monoclonal antibody that can specifically capture the PCT was successfully linked onto the surface of the nanocomposites with a 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) condensation reaction. Finally, the modified sensor was employed for the electrochemical analysis of PCT using differential Pulse Voltammetry(DPV). Notably, the larger surface area of g-C3N4 and the higher electron transfer capacity of NiCoP/g-C3N4 endow this sensor with a wider detection range (1 ag/mL to 10 ng/mL) and an ultra-low limit of detection (0.6 ag/mL, S/N = 3). In addition, this strategy was also successfully applied to the detection of PCT in the diluted human serum sample, demonstrating that the developed immunosensors have the potential for application in clinical testing.",

            "text": "Procalcitonin (PCT), an environmental-friendly biomarker of a variety of diseases induced by bacterial infections, has already played a significant role in clinical medicine practice [1\u20135]. Currently, various detection methods have been developed for PCT quantitative detection, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [6,7], protein microarrays [8\u201310], electrochemiluminescent immunosensors [11\u201313], surface plasmon resonance biosensors [14\u201316] and electrochemical biosensors [17\u201319]. Compared with other methods, the electrochemical biosensor is an effective analytical approach, and it has attracted great interest owing to its advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity, rapid response, low cost and easy miniaturization [20\u201322]. However, choosing the right electrode material remains a challenge for achieving a high-performance electrochemical sensor. In recent years, nanocomposites based on graphene and its derivatives have drawn considerable attention in the field of sensing. Graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a two-dimensional planar conjugation material, because of its larger surface area, unique electronic band structure, good biocompatibility, excellent electronic and physicochemical properties, has been taken as a promising alternative for SERS sensing and bioimaging, optoelectronics, direct solar water splitting and visible light photocatalytic pollutant degradation [23\u201327]. Despite these excellent properties, the application of g-C3N4 in the electrochemical sensing area is still restricted because of the large contact resistance and poor conductivity. To overcome this disadvantage, some alterations, such as doping or coupling with other nanomaterials, were adopted to improve the conductivity, making it suitable for electrochemical sensor applications.\nSensors 2023, 23, 4348. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23094348 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 4348 2 of 13\nTransition metal phosphides, such as CoP, Cu3P and Ni2P, because of their quasimetallic properties, good conductivity, stability and high electrocatalytic activity, have been widely used in photocatalysis, supercapacitors and other research fields. However, as an electrochemical material, due to the synergy between metals, bimetallic phosphide nanomaterials showed better electrochemical properties than the corresponding monometallic [28]. Additionally, features such as high electrical conductivity, the low electronegativity of phosphorus compared to oxygen, and less negative charge of phosphorus make them particularly suitable for biosensor design. The ternary metal phosphide NiCoP has received significant attention in the field of electrocatalysis for its excellent electrical conductivity and electronic structure. In addition, factors such as a low overpotential and small charge transfer impedance make NiCoP exhibit better electrochemical performance than single [29\u201332]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research on using NiCoP as a sensing interface to improve sensing performance. In this paper, a new electrochemical immunosensor based on NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposite modification was for the first time constructed and used for PCT detection (Scheme 1). The formation of the NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the functionalization was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Additionally, the electrochemical properties of this sensing platform were investigated in monitoring the PCT with different concentrations and with different backgrounds. The recovery of this sensing platform was investigated by monitoring different pulse voltammetry (DPV) of PCT in the presence of human serum blood.

            "text": "The morphologies of g-C3N4 and NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were investigated by SEM and TEM. For the g-C3N4, they appeared layered, rippled and resembled waves of crumpled silk veil, illustrating the nanosheets structure (Figure 1A,D). Our previous research identified that this special nanosheet structure could provide more active binding sites [35]. For the NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposites, there were several small nanoparticles displayed on the g-C3N4 surface, implying that NiCoP was successfully loaded onto the g-C3N4 surface (Figure 1B,E). The HRTEM image shows distinct lattice fringes with a plane spacing of 0.22 nm and 0.51nm, corresponding to the (111) and (100) planes of NiCoP (Figure 1C) [36\u201338]. In addition, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping image obtained in STEM mode demonstrated the C and N elements distributed in the substrate, and the Ni, Co and P elements throughout the structure (Figure 1F\u2013K), further confirming the presence of NiCoP nanoparticles. XRD was used to distinguish the phases and the structures of bare g-C3N4 and NiCoP loading. As shown in Figure 2, the lattice planes of triazine units (100) (13.1\u25e6) and the lattice planes of interlayer stacking of aromatic segments (002) (27.8\u25e6) were detected, indicating the bare g-C3N4 was successfully synthesized [35,39]. For the NiCoP/g-C3N4 samples, beside the strongest diffraction peaks of g-C3N4, several weak peaks appeared at 41\u25e6, 44.95\u25e6 and 47.97\u25e6, which correspond to the (111), (201) and (210) lattice planes of NiCoP, respectively [40,41] (JCPDS No. 71-2336). These results implied that the NiCoP nanoparticles had been successfully loaded on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Detailed information on the g-C3N4 and NiCoP/g-C3N4 nanocomposites was obtained by XPS. The survey spectra of bare g-C3N4 and NiCoP/g-C3N4 were shown in Figure 3A,D. C, N and O elements in g-C3N4 and the C, N, P, Co and Ni elements in the NiCoP/g-C3N4 sample were detected, respectively. The detected O 1s peaks in the bare g-C3N4 were mainly due to the surface-adsorbed O2 and H2O molecules. By contrast, the O 1s peak of NiCoP/g-C3N4 increased significantly, which may have been caused by the surface oxidation of NiCoP nanoclusters [36]. Four binding energy peaks were shown in the C 1s XPS spectrum of the original g-C3N4 at 284.3, 285.2, 287.5 and 288.2 eV (Figure 3B), which originated from the graphitic, C-N/C-O bindings, cyanide/cyanoquione and heptazine typed carbons, respectively. Four peaks located at 397.97 eV, 399.3 eV, 400.3 eV and 403.4 eV were well-suited for the N 1s XPS spectra of g-C3N4 (Figure 3C), which is attributed to the heptazine N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidic N, respectively [33]. By comparing the binding energy spectrum after NiCoP deposition, we found the shift in the C 1s and N 1s spectra of NiCoP/g-C3N4 (Figure 3E,F), indicating an internal force between NiCoP and gC3N4. For the P 2p spectrum (Figure 3G), the binding energy peak was located at 127.7 eV, which was close to the P 2p3/2, indicating the presence of the P element. Moreover, the peak at 131.9 eV could be attributed to the oxidized phosphorus species in contact with\nSensors 2023, 23, 4348 5 of 13\nair [40,42]. For Co 2p, 777.25 eV and 792.2 eV the binding peaks were attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of metallic Co because of the formation of Co-P [43,44] (Figure 3H). Likewise, for the Ni 2p region, the strong binding energy of 852.25 eV was close to the nickel metal (852.6 eV), which implied the presence of partially charged Ni species (Figure 3I). The XPS results further confirmed that NiCoP nanoparticles had been successfully loaded onto the g-C3N4 surface.

As shown in Figure 7C, for each interfering substance, the DPV value was close to the control sample; however, after mixing with the PCT, the DPV response of the mixture was similar to PCT alone, indicating that our sensor can specifically recognize and capture the PCT.
