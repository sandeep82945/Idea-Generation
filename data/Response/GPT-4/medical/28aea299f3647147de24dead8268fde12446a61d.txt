Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multimodal Analgesia Programs: Investigate the long-term outcomes of implementing multimodal analgesia programs in comparison to traditional opioid-centric pain management strategies in perioperative care. This research could focus on patient recovery times, satisfaction levels, and the incidence of persistent postoperative opioid use (PPOU).

Developing and Testing Opioid Stewardship Interventions: Design, implement, and evaluate the impact of targeted opioid stewardship interventions within the perioperative period on opioid prescribing practices, patient outcomes, and the prevalence of opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs). These interventions could include educational programs for healthcare providers, electronic prescribing guidelines, and patient-centered decision aids.

Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics for Opioid Stewardship: Utilize machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to identify patients at high risk of developing opioid dependence or experiencing ORADEs postoperatively. This research could explore the development of predictive models that integrate patient data, surgical factors, and postoperative care variables to guide personalized pain management plans.

Quality Indicators for Perioperative Opioid Use: Further refine and validate the quality indicators for perioperative opioid use identified in the paper. This could involve conducting prospective studies to assess the feasibility, reliability, and impact of these indicators on improving perioperative opioid stewardship and patient outcomes. Additionally, research could explore the development of new indicators that capture emerging aspects of opioid use and management.

Patient and Provider Education on Opioid Risks and Alternatives: Investigate the effectiveness of different modalities and content of education for patients and healthcare providers on the risks associated with opioid use and the availability of non-opioid pain management alternatives. This could include evaluating the impact of educational interventions on changing prescribing behaviors, patient expectations regarding pain management, and the incidence of PPOU and ORADEs.
