1. **Investigate the association between ability grouping and subjective well-being in different educational systems.** This study focused on the German educational system, which has a rigid between-school tracking system. It would be interesting to see if the results would be replicated in other countries with different ability grouping practices, such as within-school tracking or no tracking at all.


2. **Examine the effects of achievement composition on subjective well-being in different school contexts.** This study found that achievement composition was negatively associated with the decline in life satisfaction, but not school satisfaction. It would be interesting to see if this finding would hold in different school contexts, such as schools with different socioeconomic backgrounds or schools with different academic emphases.


3. **Explore the role of individual factors in moderating the association between school context and subjective well-being.** This study did not examine the role of individual factors, such as personality traits or coping mechanisms, in moderating the association between school context and subjective well-being. Future studies could investigate how these individual factors might influence the impact of school context on subjective well-being.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of school context on subjective well-being.** This study only examined the effects of school context on subjective well-being during secondary school. It would be interesting to see if these effects would persist into adulthood.


5. **Examine the effects of school context on other aspects of well-being, such as mental health or academic achievement.** This study focused on subjective well-being, but school context may also affect other aspects of well-being, such as mental health or academic achievement. Future studies could investigate these other aspects of well-being to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of school context on adolescent development.
