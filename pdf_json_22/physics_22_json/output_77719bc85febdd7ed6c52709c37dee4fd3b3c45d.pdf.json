    "abstractText": "In this review we deal with open (dissipative and stochastic) quantum systems within the Bohmian mechanics framework which has the advantage to provide a clear picture of quantum phenomena in terms of trajectories, originally in configuration space. The gradual decoherence process is studied from linear and nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations through Bohmian trajectories as well as by using the so-called quantumclassical transition differential equation through scaled trajectories. This transition is governed by a continuous parameter, the transition parameter, covering these two extreme open dynamical regimes. Thus, two sources of decoherence of different nature are going to be considered. Several examples will be presented and discussed in order to illustrate the corresponding theory behind each case, namely: the so-called BrownianBohmian motion leading to quantum diffusion coefficients, dissipative diffraction in time, dissipative tunnelling for a parabolic barrier under the presence of an electric field and stochastic early arrivals for the same type of barrier. In order to simplify the notations and physical discussion, the theoretical developments will be carried out in one dimension throughout all this wok. One of the main goals is to analyze the gradual decoherence process existing in these open dynamical regimes in terms of trajectories, leading to a more intuitive way of understanding the underlying physics in order to gain new insights.",

            "text": "Real physical systems do not exist in complete isolation in nature and therefore they can be thought as open systems in the sense that the interaction with their environments is always present. From the very beginning, the motion of particles in quantum mechanics was analyzed in terms of stochastic processes. A formal analogy between the Brownian motion and the Schro\u0308dinger equation was noticed by Fu\u0308rth [1]. Subsequently, Fe\u0301nyes [2] and Weizel [3\u20135] developed this approach with more mathematical detail. The search for a stochastic support for quantum mechanics comes from the early 1950s. The first attempt in the Bohmian mechanics was due to Bohm and Vigier [6]. These authors assumed that the electron is a particle suspended in a Madelung fluid [7] whose general motion is determined by the resolution of the Schro\u0308dinger equation. In general, the aim was to show how close it is to classical theory of Brownian motion and Newtonian mechanics, and how the Schro\u0308dinger equation might have been discovered from this point of view. The theory was well established by Nelson [8] starting from a different point of view of those proposed by Fe\u0301nyes, Weizel, Kershaw [9], Comisar [10] and de la Pen\u0303a [11]. Olavo [12] also followed previous works but starting from a more axiomatic formulation. In this respect, one can claim that the depart of Bohm and collaborators is again a breakthrough. Bohm and Hiley [13, 14] make clear that there is no way to avoid non-locality in the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Recently, this initial work has also been reviewed and extended by Drezet within the context of Brownian motion in the pilot wave interpretation of de Broglie [15].\nIn general, the field of open quantum systems is growing very rapidly due to the fact that the interaction of the system with an environment and the entanglement between both lead to the emergence of a new and very exciting physics [16\u201321]. There are three main approaches in the literature to deal with the dissipative and stochastic dynamics in open quantum systems [17, 21]: (i) the system-plus-environment approach leading to master equations for the reduced density matrix which is issued from integration over the environmental degrees of freedom, (ii) effective time-dependent Hamiltonians through linear Schro\u0308dinger equations such as the so-called Caldirola-Kanai (CK) equation [22, 23] and (iii) non-linear Schro\u0308dinger equations. We are going to focus here on the second and third approaches where the wave function is the object of interest, not the reduced density matrix. Seven of such non-linear Schro\u0308dinger equations have been analyzed elsewhere [24] by providing the corresponding Feynman propagators: the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski (BBM) equation [25], the Bateman-Caldirola-Kanai equation [22, 23, 26], the Dio\u0301si-HalliwellNassar equation [24, 27], the Schro\u0308dinger-Langevin (SL) or Kostin equation [28], the Schuch-Chung-Hartmann (SCH) equation [29, 30], the Su\u0308ssmannHasse-Albretch-Kostin-Nassar equation [31\u201334] and the Schro\u0308dinger-Nassar equation [35]. Among these nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equations, the SL equation derived heuristically by Kostin from the Heisenberg-Langevin equation for the momentum operator seems to be the most widely used. Furthermore, a\nnonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equation was also proposed by Nassar and Miret-Arte\u0301s (NMA) [36] to describe at the same time the continuous measurement of the position of a quantum particle interacting with its environment. Chavanis [37] also derived two other nonlinear equations using the theory of scale relativity due to Nottale [38] by introducing a complex friction coefficient. For real frictions, one of them reduces to the SL equation. A different generalized SL equation was proposed in the literature for nonlinear interaction providing a state-dependent dissipation process exhibiting multiplicative noise [39]. This differential equation was afterwards extended to a non-Markovian scheme [40].\nOn the other hand, Bohmian mechanics [41\u201343] is clearly a complementary, alternative and new interpretive way of introducing quantum mechanics and has the advantage to provide a clear picture of quantum phenomena in terms of trajectories, originally in configuration space. Our purpose is also to present and analyze the corresponding trajectories in order to describe open dynamics within this formalism (we will speak about dissipative and stochastic Bohmian trajectories). Furthermore, if the gradual decoherence process is also studied by using the so-called quantum-classical transition wave differential equation, originally proposed by Richardson et al. [44] in the context of conservative systems, the corresponding dynamics are governed by a continuous parameter, the transition parameter. Chou applied this wave equation to analyze wave-packet interference [45] and the dynamics of the harmonic and Morse oscillators with complex trajectories [46]. The resulting trajectories have been called by us scaled trajectories [47, 48] since a scaled Planck\u2019s constant in terms of the transition parameter is used. Moreover, by assuming a time-dependent Gaussian ansatz for the probability density, Bohmian and scaled trajectories are expressed as a sum of a classical trajectory (a particle property) and a term containing the width of the corresponding wave packet (a wave property) within of what has been called the dressing scheme [21]. Similarly, the same scheme is observed in the context of nonlinear quantum mechanics [49] where solitons, which differ completely from normal microscopic particles, also possess the wave-particle duality; their wave property appears in the form of a travelling solitary wave and their corpuscle feature is analogous to a classical particle. Scaled trajectories also display the well-known non-crossing property even in the classical regime.\nThe procedure of using a continuous parameter monitoring the different dynamical regimes in the theory could be seen quite similar to the WKB approximation (based on a series expansion in powers of Planck\u2019s constant), widely used for conservative systems. However, some important differences should be clearly stressed. First, whereas the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the classical action is obtained at zero order in the WKB approximation, the so-called classical wave (nonlinear) equation [50] is reached by construction. Second, the hierarchy of the differential equations for the action at different orders of the expansion in ~ is substituted by only a transition wave differential equation which can be solved in the linear and nonlinear domains. Third, the transition from quantum to classical trajectories is carried out in\na continuous and gradual way. Fourth, the scaling procedure extended and applied to open quantum systems is very easy to implement. And fifth, the gradual decoherence process due to the scaled Planck\u2019s constant allows us to analyze what happens at intermediate regimes. At this level, it is interesting to point out that this process studied within this theoretical scheme displays two sources of decoherence but of different nature; the first one is due to the open dynamics itself and the second one due to the transition parameter pinpointing and stressing different dynamical regimes until reaching the open classical regime.\nIn the nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equation approach, the so-called Schro\u0308dingerLangevin-Bohm (SLB) equation is obtained by substituting the polar form of the wave function into the SL nonlinear differential equation [21]. Then, by assuming a Gaussian ansatz as a solution of the SLB equation for potentials of at most second order in space coordinate, the center of the wave packet is ruled by the classical Langevin equation and its width fulfills the so-called generalized Pinney equation [51]. Surprisingly, thermal fluctuations do not affect the width of the wave packet. The classical Langevin equation is solved by using a white noise for the stochastic force which is typical for the Brownian motion. In Ref. [52], quantum noise (white and colored) has been used to solve the Kostin equation for the simple harmonic oscillator. The most basic problem to be considered is the Brownian motion described by stochastic Bohmian trajectories. Thus, one speaks about the Brownian-Bohmian motion. In this diffusion regime, time dependent classical and quantum diffusion coefficients issued from mean square displacements in the classical and Bohmian context are defined, respectively. At asymptotic times, both diffusion coefficients tend to be the same. This behavior can also be derived from the velocity autocorrelation function [53].\nIn this work, several examples will be presented and discussed in order to illustrate the corresponding theory behind each case, namely: the BrownianBohmian motion leading to quantum diffusion coefficients, dissipative diffraction in time reported when a sudden release from a totally absorbing shutter occurs in a free non-conservative dynamics (originally it was reported for conservative dynamics), dissipative tunnelling for a parabolic barrier under the presence of an electric field and stochastic early arrivals with respect to free propagation for the same type of barriers but time dependent. In particular, dissipative tunnelling through a parabolic repeller has been studied via quantum Langevin equation [54], in resistively shunted Josephson junctions, and using the CK [55] and Kostin [47] approaches. Investigation of dissipative tunnelling times through different approaches have attracted many researchers [56\u201360]. Thus, Baskoutas and Jannussis [61] and Papadopoulos [55], Tokieda and Hagino [62] have considered similar theoretical frameworks. In order to simplify the notations and physical discussions, the theoretical developments will be carried out here in one dimension. One of the main goals is to illustrate the gradual decoherence process existing in these dynamical regimes by applying very different theoretical methods to those widely used such as the\ndensity matrix, path-integral and Langevin formalisms [17]. In this different and less known alternative [21], the decoherence process is followed by means of stochastic trajectories leading to a more intutitive way of understanding the underlying physics. In this sense, analytically solvable models are very useful in order to gain new insights."

Here we follow the standard notation where a dot on a given variable means derivation with respect to time. The canonical momentum pc is obtained as\npc = \u2202L \u2202x\u0307 = mx\u0307e\u03b3t, (1)\nwhich is explicitly time-dependent and mx\u0307 = pce \u2212\u03b3t is the kinematic momentum.

Thus, as long as quantities related to this momentum are not computed, the use of this wave differential equation in the physical coordinate space is formally correct [64].

(6) and (7) are the well-known continuity and Hamilton-Jacobi equations for dissipative problems respectively, and the probability density and current density are expressed as\n\u03c1(x, t) = R2(x, t), (9)\nj(x, t) = R2 1\nm\n\u2202S \u2202x e\u2212\u03b3t = ~ m Im\n{ \u03c8\u2217 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202x\n} e\u2212\u03b3t, (10)\nwhere Im stands for the imaginary part. Furthermore, the dissipative Bohmian velocity field is given by the guiding condition\nvB(x, t) = j(x, t)\n\u03c1(x, t) =\n1\nm\n\u2202S \u2202x e\u2212\u03b3t, (11)\nfrom which dissipative Bohmian trajectories x(x(0), t) are extracted by integrating this equation leading to\ndx dt = vB(x, t) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=x(x(0),t) . (12)\nAs can be seen, the only initial condition is the position of the particle since its initial momentum is specified by the phase of the wave function according to Eq. (11). From Eq. (12), one has that\nmx\u0308 = d\ndt\n( e\u2212\u03b3t \u2202S\n\u2202x\n) = e\u2212\u03b3t [ \u2212\u03b3 \u2202S\n\u2202x +\n( \u2202\n\u2202t + x\u0307\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n) \u2202S\n\u2202x\n] . (13)\nNow, from Eqs. (12) and (7), Eq. (13) can then be rewritten as\nmx\u0308+m\u03b3x\u0307+ \u2202\n\u2202x (V + e\u22122\u03b3tQ) = 0, (14)\nwhich resembles the classical Langeving equation without noise except for the extra term e\u22122\u03b3t\u2202Q/\u2202x which represents the quantum force derived from the quantum potential, Eq.

            "heading": "2.3 The Generalized nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equation",
            "text": "Based on the theory of scale relativity due to Nottale, Chavanis [37, 38] derived the following quantum equation of motion\n\u2202\n\u2202x { \u2202S \u2202t + 1 2m ( \u2202S \u2202x )2 \u2212 iD\u2202 2S \u2202x2 + V + Vr + \u03b3S } = 0, (23)\nwith S being a complex action, D playing the role of a diffusion coefficient and \u03b3 a complex friction. After integrating over space, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation within this framework is written as\n\u2202S \u2202t + 1 2m ( \u2202S \u2202x )2 \u2212 iD\u2202 2S \u2202x2 + V + Vr + \u03b3S + f(t) = 0, (24)\nwhere f(t) is a constant of integration which will be determined later on. By introducing now the wave function as follows (the so-called Schro\u0308dinger transformation)\nS = \u22122imD ln\u03c8, (25)\nEq. (24) can be rewritten as\n2imD\u2202\u03c8 \u2202t =\n{ \u22122mD2 \u2202 2\n\u2202x2 + V + Vr \u2212 2imD\u03b3 ln\u03c8 + f(t)\n} \u03c8 (26)\nand defining the diffusion coefficient after Nelson [8] as\nD = ~ 2m , (27)\nEq. (26) leads to a generalized nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equation\ni~ \u2202\n\u2202t \u03c8 =\n{ \u2212 ~ 2\n2m\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 + V + Vr \u2212 i\u03b3R~(ln\u03c8 \u2212 \u3008ln\u03c8\u3009) + ~\u03b3I(ln\u03c8 \u2212 \u3008ln\u03c8\u3009)\n} \u03c8\n(28)\nwhere \u03b3R and \u03b3I are the real and imaginary parts of the complex friction coefficient \u03b3, playing the role of classical and quantum friction coefficients, respectively. The imaginary part has been related to an effective temperature Te (positive or negative) through 2kBTe/~ where kB is the Boltzmann constant [37]. The term accompanying \u03b3I in Eq. (28) can then be considered as a statistical potential leading under certain conditions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [37]. This is a reminiscent of the symmetry of the wave function describing an ensemble of particles (bosons and fermions) as the origin of what is called statistical potential [66], which can be attractive or repulsive. Finally, the integration constant f(t) is set in such a way that the expectation value of the friction term proportional to \u03b3R is zero.\nFrom the polar form of the wave function Eq. (5), Eq. (28) can be split again into real and imaginary parts according to [67]\n\u2212 \u2202S \u2202t = 1 2m\n( \u2202S\n\u2202x\n)2 + V + Vr +Q+ \u03b3R(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009) +\n~\u03b3I 2 (ln \u03c1\u2212 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009)\n(29)\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x\n( \u03c1 1\nm\n\u2202S\n\u2202x\n) = \u2212\u03b3R\u03c1(ln \u03c1\u2212 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009) +\n2\u03b3I ~ \u03c1(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009)\n(30)\nwhere\n\u03c1(x, t) = |\u03c8(x, t)|2, (31)\nQ(x, t) = \u2212 ~ 2\n2m 1 \u221a \u03c1\n\u22022 \u221a \u03c1\n\u2202x2 . (32)\nEqs. (29) and (30) can now be seen as the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi and continuity equations, respectively. This continuity equation has now two\nsource/sink terms and therefore Eq. (28) violates the local conservation of probability density. The integration over the whole space of Eq. (30) provides however the correct global conservation of the normalization. The partial derivative with respect to the space coordinate of Eq. (29) yields(\n\u2202 \u2202t + 1 m \u2202S \u2202x \u2202 \u2202x\n) \u2202S\n\u2202x = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202x (V + Vr +Q)\u2212 \u03b3R \u2202S \u2202x \u2212 ~\u03b3I 2\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 \u2202x . (33)\nAt this point it is of interest to discuss Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem for complex friction. As is well known, Ehrenfest\u2019s relations in three dimensions are given by\nd dt \u3008r\u0302\u3009 = \u3008p\u0302\u3009 m , (34)\nd dt \u3008p\u0302\u3009 = \u2212\u3008\u2207V \u3009 \u2212 \u03b3R\u3008p\u0302\u3009. (35)\nFor interaction potentials of at most second order in space coordinates where \u3008\u2207V (r)\u3009 = \u2207V (\u3008r\u3009), after Eq. (34), Eq. (35) can be written as\nm d2\ndt2 \u3008r\u0302\u3009 = \u2212\u2207V (\u3008r\u3009)\u2212 \u03b3R\u3008p\u0302\u3009, (36)\nwhich is the classical equation of motion for the expectation value of the position operator. This equation is known as Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem [68]. One can see that the standard continuity equation (the continuity equation without source/sink terms), which preserves local conservation of normalization, is a sufficient condition for fulfilling Eq. (34).\nHowever, the generalized nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equation (28) violates both Ehrenfest relations. The time derivative of the expectation value of the position operator is given by\nd dt \u3008r\u0302\u3009 =\n\u222b d3x \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t r = \u3008p\u0302\u3009 m \u2212 \u03b3R\n\u2329 r\u0302(ln \u03c1\u2212 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009) \u232a + 2\u03b3I ~ \u2329 r\u0302(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009) \u232a , (37)\nwhere integration by parts and the relation \u3008p\u0302\u3009 = \u3008\u2207S\u3009 have been applied. Eq. (37) explicitly shows violation of Eq. (34). Analogously, the same happens with Eq. (35). For this goal, we multiply both sides of Eq. (33) by \u03c1. Then, by taking into account the continuity equation (30), one has that\n\u2202(\u03c1\u2207S) \u2202t + \u2211 i ei\u2207 \u00b7 ( \u03c1 \u2207iS m \u2207S ) +\u2207S ( \u03b3R\u03c1(ln \u03c1\u2212 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009)\u2212 2\u03b3I ~ \u03c1(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009) ) = \u2212\u03c1\u2207(V +Q)\u2212 \u03b3R\u03c1\u2207S \u2212\n~\u03b3I 2 \u2207\u03c1,\n(38)\nwhere ei denotes the unit vector along the xi direction . Now by integrating both sides of this equation over the whole space and given that \u3008\u2207Q\u3009 = 0, one has that\nd dt \u3008\u2207S\u3009 = \u2212\u3008\u2207V \u3009 \u2212 \u03b3R\u3008\u2207S\u3009 \u2212 \u03b3R\n\u2329 \u2207S(ln \u03c1\u2212 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009) \u232a +\n2\u03b3I ~\n\u2329 \u2207S(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009) \u232a .\n(39)\nFor solutions where the phase of the wave function is linear in space, \u2207S is only a function of time. Thus, the last two terms of right hand side of Eq. (39) becomes zero. Only in this case, this Ehrenfest relation is fulfilled."

Here, \u03ba plays the role of the resolution of the continuous measurement apparatus. If the polar form of the wave function Eq. (5) is again substituted into Eq. (40), the resulting equations for the real and imaginary parts are expressed now as\n\u2212 \u2202S \u2202t = 1 2m\n( \u2202S\n\u2202x\n)2 + V + Vr(x, t) +Q+ \u03b3(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009), (43)\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x\n( \u03c1 1\nm\n\u2202S\n\u2202x\n) = \u22122\u03ba\u03c1(ln \u03c1\u2212 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009). (44)\nComparison of Eq. (29) with Eq. (43) and Eq. (30) with Eq. (44) shows that when \u03b3I = 0 and \u03b3R = 2\u03ba, the generalized nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equation (28) is equivalent to the NMA equation (40) for the special value \u03ba = \u03b3/2.\nIn the previous section, we have showed that Eq. (28) violates local conservation of the probability density function. In this context, another generalized\ndifferential equation has been proposed [37]\ni~ \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202t =\n{ \u2212 ~ 2\n2m\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 + V + Vr + ~\u03b3I ln(|\u03c8|)\n+ ~ 2i \u03b3R\n[ ln ( \u03c8\n\u03c8\u2217\n) \u2212 \u2329 ln ( \u03c8\n\u03c8\u2217\n)\u232a]} \u03c8. (45)\nAs mentioned above, Chavanis [37] introduced \u03b3I = 2kBTe/~ leading to a form of fluctuation-dissipation theorem between real and imaginary parts of the friction coefficient, Te being an effective temperature. If \u03b3I = 0, Eq. (45) reduces to the Kostin or SL equation (15). For an imaginary friction coefficient, it reduces to BBM equation [25] which possesses soliton-like solutions of Gaussian shape. Eq. (45) can then also be proposed to describe continuous measurements in dissipative media as an alternative to the NMA equation.\nOnce more from the polar form of the wave function (5), Eq. (45) leads to\n\u2212 \u2202S \u2202t = 1 2m\n( \u2202S\n\u2202x\n)2 +V +Vr + \u03b3R(S\u2212\u3008S\u3009)\u2212 ~2\n2m\n1 |\u03c8| \u22022|\u03c8| \u2202x2 + ~\u03b3I ln |\u03c8| (46)\nand \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202t +\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n( \u03c1 1\nm\n\u2202S\n\u2202x\n) = 0. (47)\nThese equations are the modified Hamilton-Jacobi and continuity equations, respectively. The space derivative of Eq. (46) is(\n\u2202 \u2202t + 1 m \u2202S \u2202x \u2202 \u2202x\n) \u2202S\n\u2202x = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202x\n( V + Vr \u2212 ~2\n2m\n1 |\u03c8| \u22022|\u03c8| \u2202x2\n+ ~\u03b3I ln |\u03c8| ) \u2212 \u03b3R \u2202S\n\u2202x (48)\nand comparison with the classical equation of motion suggests us to define a (Bohmian) velocity field as [41]\nv(x, t) = 1\nm\n\u2202S \u2202x , (49)\nfrom which Eq. (48) can be recast\ndv dt = \u2212 1 m \u2202(V +Q) \u2202x \u2212 \u03b3Rv + 1 m Fr(t)\u2212 ~\u03b3I 2m \u2202 \u2202x ln \u03c1. (50)\nThus, the new term ~\u03b3I 2 ln \u03c1 is actually an additional contribution to Q. Due to the fact that Bohmian particles are distributed according to the Born rule, Bohmian average values of physical quantities are just quantum expectation values. Let us see an illustration. The energy of a Bohmian particle is given by\nE(x, t) = 1\n2m\n( \u2202S\n\u2202x\n)2 + V + Vr +Q+\n~\u03b3I 2 ln \u03c1 = \u2212\u2202S \u2202t \u2212 \u03b3R(S \u2212 \u3008S\u3009),(51)\nwhere Eq. (46) has been used in the second part of the equation. Thus, its average is expressed as \u3008E\u3009 = \u222b dx |\u03c8(x, t)|2E(x, t)\n= 1\n2m\n\u222b dx ( |\u03c8|2 ( \u2202S\n\u2202x\n)2 + ~2 \u2223\u2223\u2202\u03c8 \u2202x \u2223\u22232)+ \u222b dx |\u03c8|2(V + Vr + ~\u03b3I ln |\u03c8|) = \u3008p\u03022\u3009 2m + \u3008V \u3009+ \u3008Vr\u3009+ ~\u03b3I 2 \u3008ln \u03c1\u3009. (52)\nThe energy expectation value is then calculated by [28]\n\u3008E\u3009 = \u222b dx \u03c8\u2217i~ \u2202\n\u2202t \u03c8 (53)\nand the same result is reached. Now, if we recall that for any arbitrary function A(x, t)\nd dt \u3008A\u3009 =\n\u222b dx \u2202\n\u2202t (A|\u03c8|2) =\n\u2329 dA\ndt\n\u232a , (54)\nwhere Eq.

The last term in (56) which is proportional to the quantum potential is responsible for the nonlinearity and important to recover the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The wave-particle duality is\nthus present in this classical wave differential equation but the wave function does not play the role of Bohmian mechanics, the state of a classical system is still determined by its position and momentum. After Holland [41], one continuously passes from one extreme regime to the other by varying the effectiveness of the quantum potential. A similar approach is also used by Allori et al. [71].\nAn alternative way to establish a continuous quantum-classical transition is through what is known the quantum-classical transition wave differential equation according to [44]\ni~ \u2202\n\u2202t \u03c8 (x, t) =\n[ \u2212 ~ 2\n2m e\u2212\u03b3t\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 + V (x)e\u03b3t\n+(1\u2212 ) ~ 2\n2m\ne\u2212\u03b3t |\u03c8 (x, t)| \u22022|\u03c8 (x, t)| \u2202x2\n] \u03c8 (x, t), (57)\nwhere a degree of quantumness ruled by the transition parameter (with 0 \u2264 \u2264 1) has been included. This transition differential equation provides a continuous description of the dissipative process of a physical system from going to one extreme regime to the other and in-between. Furthermore, for = 0, this transition equation reduces to the classical wave equation (56) while, for = 1, it reduces to the Schro\u0308dinger equation (4) in the CK framework.\nFollowing the same procedure, by substituting the polar form of the wave function written now as\n\u03c8 (x, t) = R (x, t)e iS (x,t)/~ (58)\ninto Eq. (57) and after some straightforward manipulations, the following equations are reached\n\u2212\u2202S \u2202t \u03c8\u0303 = 1 2m e\u2212\u03b3t ( \u2202S \u2202x )2 \u03c8\u0303 + V (x)e\u03b3t\u03c8\u0303 \u2212 ~\u0303 2 2m e\u2212\u03b3t 1 R \u22022R \u2202x2 \u03c8\u0303,\n(59)\ni~\u0303 \u2202R \u2202t eiS /~\u0303 = \u2212 ~\u0303 2 2m e\u2212\u03b3t\n[ 2i\n~\u0303 \u2202R \u2202x \u2202S \u2202x eiS /~\u0303 + i ~\u0303 \u22022S \u2202x2 \u03c8\u0303\n] , (60)\nwhere the scaled Planck constant as well as the scaled wave function in polar form have been defined as\n~\u0303 = ~ \u221a , (61)\nand\n\u03c8\u0303(x, t) = R (x, t)e iS (x,t)/~\u0303, (62)\nrespectively. Now, by adding Eq. (59) and Eq.

(63)\nIn other words, the nonlinear transition differential equation (57) is equivalent to the scaled linear Schro\u0308dinger equation (63) and similar to Eq. (4).

Thus, the decoherence process resulting from both the open quantum dynamics and scaled Planck\u2019s constant is carried out in a gradual way within each dynamical regime (it is worth mentioning that the environment is also seen as acting like a continuous measuring apparatus)."

Thus, one has now that\nS(x, t) = m\n2 \u03c3\u0307(t)\u2212 \u03b3R2 \u03c3(t) \u03c3(t) ( 1 +\nm\u03b3I ~ \u03c3(t)\n2 ) (x\u2212 q(t))2 +m q\u0307(t)\n1 + 2m\u03b3I\n~ \u03c3(t) 2\n(x\u2212 q(t)) + g(t)\n(76)\nwhere g(t) is the constant of integration which can be determined by Eq.

(79)\nAgain, the linear independency of different powers of (x\u2212 q(t)) has been used. This procedure is exact for potentials of at most second order in space coordinates and one should expect that the center of the wave packet follows a classical trajectory. Eq. (78) explicitly shows however that, in general, q(t) does not follow a classical trajectory since the width is involved in its equation of motion. Thus, for complex friction coefficients, the dressing scheme mentioned above is no longer valid. For the special case of a real friction coefficient, q(t) do follow the classical equation of motion. Furthermore, the differential equation for the width is the well-known dissipative Pinney equation [21]. In fact, Eq. (77) can be seen as a generalized dissipative Pinney equation. Dissipative Bohmian trajectories are issued from these two time differential equations.\nFor stochastic Bohmian trajectories, Vr 6= 0, one has to solve Eqs. (47) and (50) together with the time-dependent Gaussian ansatz (71) for the probability density. This Gaussian ansatz satisfies Eq. (47) provided that the velocity field and trajectories are given by\nv(x, t) = \u03c3\u0307(t)\n\u03c3(t) (x\u2212 q(t)) + q\u0307(t) (80)\nand\nx(x(0), t) = q(t) + (x(0) \u2212 q(0)) \u03c3(t) \u03c3(0) , (81)\nwhere x(0) and q(0) are the initial conditions for x(x(0), t) and q(t), respectively. As mentioned above, Eqs. (80) and (81) display the standard dressing scheme for the velocity and position [21].\nBy introducing again the ansatz (71) and Eq. (80) into the equation of motion (50), one obtains\nq\u0308(t) + \u03b3Rq\u0307(t) + 1\nm\n\u2202V\n\u2202x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=q(t) = Fr(t), (82)\n\u03c3\u0308(t) + \u03b3R\u03c3\u0307(t)\u2212 ~2 4m2\u03c3(t)3 \u2212 ~\u03b3I 2m 1 \u03c3(t) + \u03c3(t) 1 m \u22022V \u2202x2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=q(t) = 0 (83)\nwhere the interaction potential around the classical path q(t) up to second order has been expanded. As can be seen, q(t) is governed by the classical Langevin equation of motion and \u03c3(t) by the generalized Pinney equation; the new term with \u03b3I provides the extension of the standard dissipative Pinney equation [21, 67]. The equation is also known as Ermakov equation and appears, for example, in the process of cooling down atoms in a harmonic trap [72]. It should be mentioned that the differential equations fulfilled by q(t) and \u03c3(t) are not coupled each other; the width is not influenced by the random force. Chavanis [37] pointed out that in cosmology, the so-called Hubble parameter which can be defined as the ratio \u03c3\u0307/\u03c3, the corresponding width\nalso follows Eq. (83). For time-independent quadratic potentials, there is a soliton-like solution for Eq. (83) with \u03c3\u0307 = 0,\n\u03b3I = \u2212 ~\n2m\u03c320 + 2\u03c320 ~ V2, (84)\nwhere V2 = d 2V (x)/dx2 is a constant for time-independent quadratic potentials. One can thus rewrite this equation as a condition for the width initial value to have a soliton-like solution. Thus, Eq. (84) reveals that for free particles \u03b3I must be negative in order to have a soliton-like solution.\nConcerning scaled Bohmian trajectories in the context of SL, let us start by introducing the polar form (62) of the scaled wave function into the scaled SL Eq. (69) and then decomposing into imaginary and real parts. One then easily obtains Eqs. (66) and (67) with ~\u0303 instead of \u221a ~. Then, from Eq. (66), the continuity equation is thus written as\n\u2202\u03c1\u0303 \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x (\u03c1\u0303v ) = 0, (85)\nwhere\n\u03c1\u0303(x, t) = R2 (x, t) (86)\nand\nv (x, t) = 1\nm\n\u2202S (x, t)\n\u2202x (87)\nare the probability density and the corresponding velocity field, respectively. From Eq. (67) and the corresponding quantum potential defined by\nQ (x, t) = \u2212 ~2\n2m\n1\nR \u22022R \u2202x2 , (88)\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the phase\n\u2212\u2202S \u2202t = 1 2m ( \u2202S \u2202x )2 + V + Vr + \u03b3(S \u2212 \u3008S \u3009) + Q\u0303, (89)\nis found with Q\u0303 = Q . The differential equation for the velocity field can be expressed as\ndv dt = \u2202v \u2202t + v \u2202v \u2202x = \u2212 1 m \u2202 \u2202x\n( V + Vr + Q\u0303 ) \u2212 \u03b3v , (90)\nwhich is the classical equation of motion but with the additional term Q\u0303 responsible for non-classical effects. One can solve Eqs. (85) and (90) by imposing a time-dependent Gaussian ansatz for the probability density of the form [21, 73],\n\u03c1\u0303(x, t) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03c3\u0303(t) exp\n[ \u2212 (x\u2212 q\u0303(t)) 2\n2\u03c3\u03032(t)\n] , (91)\nwhere q\u0303(t) = \u222b dx x \u03c1\u0303(x, t) is the time dependent expectation value of the position operator which follows the center of the Gaussian wave packet and \u03c3\u0303(t) gives its width. Eq. (91) satisfies the continuity equation (85) for\nv (x, t) = \u02d9\u0303\u03c3\n\u03c3\u0303 (x\u2212 q\u0303(t)) + \u02d9\u0303q(t), (92)\nfrom which scaled trajectories are generated and expressed as\nx (x (0), t) = q\u0303(t) + (x(0) \u2212 x0)\n\u03c3\u0303(t)\n\u03c30 , (93)\nwith x(0) being the initial condition for the coordinate, x0 the initial value for xt and \u03c30 = \u03c3\u0303(0). For = 1, the standard Bohmian trajectories are recovered. The same dressing scheme [21] is again reached. Now, as usual, by replacing Eqs. (91) and (92) into Eq. (90), and then Taylor expanding the interaction potential around q\u0303(t) up to second order and using the condition for linear independence of different powers of (x \u2212 q\u0303(t)), a classical Langevin equation for the position of the center of the wave packet and a second order differential equation in time for the width are then derived\n\u00a8\u0303q(t) + \u03b3 \u02d9\u0303q(t) + 1\nm\n( Fr(t) + \u2202V\n\u2202x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=q\u0303 ) = 0, (94)\n\u00a8\u0303\u03c3 + \u03b3 \u02d9\u0303\u03c3 \u2212 ~\u0303 2 4m2\u03c3\u03033 + \u03c3\u0303 m \u22022V \u2202x2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=q\u0303 = 0, (95)\nwhere a linear form (16) is again explicitely assumed for the random potential. It is clear seen that and \u03b3 affect the width of the wave packet whereas, as expected from Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem, the motion of its center is not altered by and, therefore, q\u0303(t) follows a classical trajectory. Even more, due to the fact the scaled Planck\u2019s contant appears only in the differential equation for the width, with , the quantum character of its time evolution is gradually lost. Remember that the Gaussian ansatz is the exact solution of the transition wave equation for these cases where potentials of at most quadratic order are involved.\nMoreover, when one neglects the random force term Fr(t) and considers only dissipation with the second order interaction potential written as\nV (x, t) = V0(t) + V1(t)x+ 1\n2 V2(t)x\n2, (96)\nthen, from the previous two equations we have\n\u00a8\u0303q(t) = \u2212\u03b3 \u02d9\u0303q(t)\u2212 V1(t) m \u2212 V2(t) m q\u0303(t).

(97) is analytical and given by\nxt = \u2212 V1 V2 +\n( x0 +\nV1 V2\n)[ cosh \u2126t+ \u03b3\n2\nsinh \u2126t\n\u2126\n] e\u2212\u03b3t/2 + x\u03070 sinh \u2126t\n\u2126 e\u2212\u03b3t/2,\n(99)\nwith the damped frequency\n\u2126 = \u221a \u2212V2/m+ \u03b32/4. (100)\nOn the contrary, the solution of Eq. (98) is not found in an analytical way. However, for the non-dissipative or frictionless case \u03b3 = 0, provided that V2 is independent of time, its solution is given by\n\u03c3\u0303(t) = \u03c30\n\u221a cosh2(\u03c9t) +\n~\u03032 4m2\u03c92\u03c340 sinh2(\u03c9t), (101)\nfor \u02d9\u0303\u03c3(0) = 0 and where \u03c9 = \u221a \u2212V2/m. For the classical regime, = 0, and V2 independent of time, the solution of Eq.

In these equations, \u03c3\u03070 stands for the initial value of \u02d9\u0303\u03c3(t).\nNow, from Eq. (93), the difference between two typical scaled trajectories can be expressed as\nx (x (0) 1 , t)\u2212 x (x (0) 2 , t) = (x (0) 1 \u2212 x (0) 2 )\n\u03c3\u0303(t)\n\u03c3\u03030 . (104)\nThus, trajectories diverge during the time evolution revealing the non-crossing property of trajectories. Notice that this property is even valid in the classical regime and can be used to provide a criterion for tunnelling or, in general, any quantum effect."

A time-dependent diffusion coefficient D(t) can be defined as the ratio of MSD over 2t [67]. From Eqs.

(111)\nThe quantum diffusion constant follows the same dressing scheme as the quantum trajectories in the Bohmian framework. For the soliton-like solution Eq.

As the right panel clearly shows each curve tends to an asymptotic value from which the corresponding diffusion coefficient can be extracted. From Einstein\u2019s relation, this coefficient increases with temperature. Furthermore, quantum coefficients are always greater than classical ones due to the width contribution of the wave packet according to Eq. (110)."

For a given position x = x0, at time t = t0 = \u2212 1\u03b3 ln ( 1\u2212 \u03b3mx0p ) where the argument of the Fresnel integral becomes zero, this density becomes 1/4 for non-classical regimes.

In the quantum-classical transition, the number of oscillations increases and the pattern shifts to shorter times. In order to better observe these features, the location of the first maximum versus time for various regimes in the right panel of this figure is plotted. Values of the corresponding\nmaxima and minima in various regimes are almost the same and thus the visibly, quantifying the interference contrast, has almost the same value 0.5921 for all non-classical regimes.

(123) with \u2126 given by Eq. (100).\nThe time-dependent transmission probability for incidence from left to right of the parabolic barrier is known to be [55, 61, 76]\nT (t) = B(t)\u222b xm\n\u2212\u221e dx \u03c1(x, 0) (127)\nwith\nB(t) = \u222b t 0 dt\u2032 j(xd, t \u2032) = \u222b \u221e xd dx [\u03c1(x, t)\u2212 \u03c1(x, 0)], (128)\nxm being the location of the barrier maximum, xm = 0. Here xd can be any point on the right side of the barrier. In the stationary regime, this probability reaches a constant value which is independent on the choice of xd. The second equality in Eq. (128) results from integrating the continuity equation. For xd = xm = 0, Eq. (127) reduces to\nT (t) = erf(xt/\n\u221a 2\u03c3\u0303(t))\u2212 erf(x0/ \u221a 2\u03c30)\nerfc(x0/ \u221a 2\u03c30) (129)\nfor the wave packet (71). The transmission probability thus depends on the electrical field through xt and can be written in terms of the error function and its complementary function [75].\nNumerical calculations have been carried out in atomic units (m = 1, ~ = 1 and q = \u22121) and the initial Gaussian wave packet parameters are chosen to be \u03c30 = 1, p0 = 1, x0 = \u221210 and the frequency of the parabolic repeller \u03c9 = 0.2. In Figure 4, transmission probabilities are displayed versus time for four different values of dissipation \u03b3 = 0 (black curve), \u03b3 = 0.1\u03c9\n(red curve), \u03b3 = 0.2\u03c9 (green curve), and \u03b3 = 0.3\u03c9 (blue curve) . These probabilities are plotted for different dynamical regimes, namely: = 1 (first column), = 0.5 (second column) and = 0.1 (third column) in the CK (first row) and Kostin (second row) approaches. Transmission probabilities decrease in both approaches and, with the transition parameter, the same is observed when passing from the quantum regime to a nearly classical regime ( = 0.1). Moreover, with this choice of parameters, the transmission probability becomes constant after t \u2248 30 and displays a maximum at very short times. This maximum corresponds to trajectories passing through the barrier but after a short period of time turn around. Kostin results always display a higher tunnelling transmission than the CK one as could be predicted from Eq. (129) since \u03c3\u0303CK(t) < \u03c3\u0303SL(t). This is also observed in Fig. 5 where these probabilities are plotted as a function of at four dissipative values for the two approaches. At around t = 150, the asymptotic value of T is already reached. As expected, these probabilities decrease when tends to the classical limit and with \u03b3 where the decoherence process is playing more and more a major role.\nAs can be seen, the variation of the tunnelling probability with the field parameters comes solely through xt, the width \u03c3\u0303(t) of the wave packet being independent on them. Figures 6 and 7 display the dependence of transmission probability to the field parameters \u03c90 and E0, respectively. Figure 6 shows the transmission probabilities versus the frequency (in units of \u03c9) of the applied electrical field for several amplitudes: E0 = 0.12 (black curve), E0 = 0.1 (red curve) and E0 = 0.08 (green curve) with \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0/2. With this initial phase, the field is a pure sine function of (\u03c90t). In the first, second and third rows, the nondissipative motion, the CK and Kostin approach (for \u03b3 = 0.3\u03c9) are plotted, respectively. The different dynamical regimes are also plotted in the three columns with = 1, = 0.5 and = 0.1. A gradual decreasing of tunnelling is seen with , that is, when approaching the classical regime. In the\nabsence of the field which this occurs when \u03c90 = 0, the transmission probability is different from zero in the nonclassical regime. The maximum observed is attributed to a resonant transmission and observed at any dynamical regime. As expected, in the absence of friction, the resonance takes place when \u03c90 = \u03c9. With friction, this resonant mechanism is observed for \u03c90 < \u03c9. In our case, \u03c90,res \u2248 0.86\u03c9. Furthermore, the role of the field amplitude is just the opposite of the friction, when increasing its value, the corresponding probabilities also increase in a nonlinear way. In the near classical regime = 0.1, the tunnelling is very small. All of these features are also illustrated in Fig. 7 where these probabilities are plotted versus the amplitude of the applied field for different values of the frequency: \u03c90 = 0.5\u03c9 (black curve), \u03c90 = \u03c90,res \u2248 0.86\u03c9 (red curve) and \u03c90 = 3\u03c9 (green curve) at different dynamical regimes in the two approaches with \u03b3 = 0.3\u03c9. The resonance or red curve gives the maximum value of the transmission probability."

            "text": "In time-dependent barriers for isolated systems, the scattering of wave packets displays an effect known as early arrivals [77, 78]. The transmission probability versus time increases when compared to the case of free wave packet propagation. Thus, early arrivals refer to this early increase (relative to the free case) in the transmission probability. It is then of interest to study this effect for open quantum systems. To this end, we consider the corresponding transmission probabilities, in the context of the generalized Schro\u0308dinger equation (45),\nfrom a time-dependent parabolic barrier\nV (x, t) = \u22121 2 m\u03c92e\u2212g(t\u2212tB) 2 x2, (130)\nwhich corresponds to the appearance of a parabolic repeller during a short time interval if a Gaussian time window is assumed. The parameters of the barrier are tB and g displaying the peak time and inverse width of the window, respectively. Here, \u03c9 characterizes the strength of the barrier. If an initial wave packet is localized on the left side of the barrier, the transmission probability is then given by\nPtr(t) = \u222b \u221e xd dx \u03c1(x, t) = 1 2 erfc [ xd \u2212 q(t)\u221a 2\u03c3(t) ] , (131)\nwhere xd is the detector location and a Gaussian ansatz (71) is assumed. For the pure dissipative dynamics, one fixes tB from the condition qf (tB) = 0 where f denotes the free case, The strength of the barrier is thus maximum when the center of the free Gaussian packet arrives at the top of the barrier. From the solution of Eq. (94) for the free dissipative dynamics, one has that\ntB = \u2212 1\n\u03b3R ln\n( 1 + \u03b3R q(0)\nq\u0307(0)\n) . (132)\nNoting the negative sign of q(0) and positive q\u0307(0) and in order to have a positive time tB , one must impose the condition\n\u03b3R |q(0)| q\u0307(0) < 1. (133)\nIn Figure 8, the time-dependent transmission probability under the presence of thermal fluctuations or noise is plotted. The Langevin equation (94) is solved by using an algorithm proposed in Ref. [79] with initial conditions q(t)|t=0 = q(0) and q\u0307(t)|t=0 = q\u0307(0) where q\u0307(0) is chosen according to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Then, for the thermal transmission probability we have\n\u3008\u3008Ptr(t)\u3009\u3009 = ntra\u2211 i=1 Ptr,i(t) = 1 2 erfc [ xd \u2212 qi(t)\u221a 2\u03c3(t) ] , (134)\nwhere in the second equality we have used Eq. (131) and qi(t) refers to the i\u2212th trajectory. The number of trajectories used to simulate a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for initial velocities is ntra = 10, 000. Two different temperatures kBT = 2 (left panel) and kBT = 10 (right panel) are used for \u03b3R = 0.1 and \u03b3I = 0. In each panel, two different values of barrier\u2019s strength \u03c9 = 0 (black curves) and \u03c9 = 1.5 (red curves) are showed. Here, we have set tB in Eq. (130)\nas tB = 3tb where tb = 2m\u03c3 2 0/~ is the time-scale appearing in the relation of freely propagating Gaussian wave packet in a non-dissipative medium. Therefore, the effect of early arrivals is also seen in this stochastic dynamics. One clearly sees that temperature also enhances transmission probability."

            "text": "The main purpose of this work is to review the dynamics of open quantum systems by means of two approaches which are less used and applied in this context than the master equation for the reduced density matrix namely, effective Hamiltonians and nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equations. The decoherence process is described in terms of trajectories in the configuration space inspired by Bohmian mechanics, leading to a more intuitive way of understanding the underlying physics. This theoretical analysis is carried out by calculating dissipative/stochastic Bohmian and scaled trajectories in order to better understand the quantum-to-classical transition. This transition is monitored by the so-called transition parameter which goes from = 0 (classical regime)\nto = 1 (quantum regime). As mentioned in the Introduction, this gradual transition can be seen as an alternative way to the WKB approximation (valid for conservative systems) but in the context of open quantum dynamics. An important feature of this analysis is the theoretical observation that using trajectories, the so-called dressing scheme is kept for all types of trajectories, similar to the soliton description of nonlinear quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we have reached for all cases presented here different generalized continuity, Hamilton-Jacobi and Pinney equations. In the Introduction we mentioned the two sources of decoherence of different nature presented here. The transition parameter facilitate us to analyze continuously dynamical regimes between the quantum and classical ones but keeping always the open character of them. Both sources of decoherence work in the same direction.\nIn order to illustrate the theory behind the two approaches used, several well-known problems have been considered. First, the Brownian-Bohmian motion which is the paradigm of open quantum systems (or quantum Brownian motion). In this stochastic dynamics, a quantum diffusion coefficient is obtained in terms of the standard classical one. Einstein\u2019s law for diffusion is reproduced. The second problem is diffraction in time which is an effect occurring by sudden release from a totally absorbing shutter in a free dynamics. The hallmark of this effect is still robust for dissipative dynamics. The third problem is the study of dissipative tunnelling by an inverted parabolic barrier showing how the decoherence process is gradually established for the different dynamical regimes and friction values. The role played by electrical field parameters (in particular, frequency and amplitude) shows that the resonance process observed is valid for any dynamical regime, except the pure classical one. An interesting point here is that when comparing the Kostin and CK approaches, the tunnelling probabilities are different as also observed by Tokieda and Hagino [62]. This discrepancy comes from the differential equation governing the Gaussian width used where both approaches differ. The Kostin approach seems to be more convenient than the CK one for at least two reasons. First, when an interaction with an environment (bath, measuring apparatus, etc) is present, linear quantum mechanics seems to be no longer applicable and nonlinear differential equations have to be implemented for a proper description of the corresponding open quantum dynamics. And second, the Kostin equation comes from the quantum Langevin equation which is also issued from a Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian formalism, whereas the CK Hamiltonian comes from a phenomenological or effective approach. Finally, the fourth problem is the well-known early arrivals effect for time dependent barriers. From stochastic trajectories, we have shown again that this effect is still robust under the presence of friction and temperature.\nThe success of the different trajectories applied to these simple problems should be seen as an alternative way to the master equation and path integral formalisms as well as a stimulus to extend this type of analysis to more general problems in order to see the validity and range of application of the different\nnonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equations. In particular, the solution of the SL nonlinear equation (or similar equations analyzed here or in the literature) could be explored following, for example, the well-known stochastic wave function method [16, 18].\nAcknowledgements SVM acknowledges support from the University of Qom.
