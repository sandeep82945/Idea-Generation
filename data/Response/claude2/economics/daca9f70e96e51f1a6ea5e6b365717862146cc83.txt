 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Conduct interdisciplinary research to develop new narratives that promote human-nature interdependence and sufficient lifestyles. This could involve collaborations between social scientists, environmental humanities scholars, economists, and stakeholders to co-create shared narratives. 

2. Test the effectiveness of different narratives in changing attitudes and behaviors related to overconsumption through experimental studies. This could compare narratives like circular economy, anthropocene, human-nature interdependence, etc.

3. Explore how narratives spread through society and become dominant or marginalized using tools from media studies, discourse analysis, and network analysis. Examine the role of different actors in shaping and propagating narratives.

4. Develop interventions that leverage effective narratives to promote sustainable behaviors, like sufficient lifestyles, eco-friendly habits, and reduced consumption. Test these interventions through field studies. 

5. Analyze how dominant economic narratives and assumptions may constrain sustainability efforts. Propose new economic models and frameworks aligned with sustainability narratives and worldviews.
