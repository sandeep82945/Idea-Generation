"The potential of AI for lung cancer detection and classification is evident; however, further research is needed to optimize ML architectures and evaluate their performance in diverse patient populations. Some future research directions should include the development and validation of AI algorithms in large, multi-center studies that include diverse patient populations to ensure the generalizability of the results. Another important topic is the investigation of the optimal combination of imaging modalities, such as CT, PET, and MRI, and their integration with AI algorithms for improved lung cancer diagnosis. Other possible study hypotheses include the exploration of AI’s role in predicting treatment response, prognosis, and patient outcomes; evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of AI-based lung cancer diagnosis, including the potential reduction in unnecessary follow-up procedures or interventions for patients with benign lesions; and the assessment of the impact of AI on clinical decision making and patient–physician communication, which may lead to better patient-centered care."
