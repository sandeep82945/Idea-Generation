 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate how different types of memories (e.g. spatial, episodic) are encoded by engram cells and replayed during sharp-wave ripples. Are there differences in the firing patterns?

2. Explore how new memories are integrated with existing memories in the hippocampus. How do engram cells and replay for new memories interact with old memories? 

3. Examine the coordination between engram cells in the hippocampus and other memory-related brain regions like the prefrontal cortex. How is information consolidated across regions?

4. Develop new neural recording techniques to simultaneously monitor engram cell activation and sharp-wave ripple events to further test their relationship.

5. Build computational models that can store multiple memories via engrams and recreate replay of different memories through sharp-wave ripples to better understand the underlying mechanisms.
