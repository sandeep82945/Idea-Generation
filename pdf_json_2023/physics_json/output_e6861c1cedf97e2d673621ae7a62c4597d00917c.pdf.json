Conventionally, proteins are targeted using antibodies, and protein-antibody interactions are converted to signal readout by enzymes. Recent developments have refined this method and added nanomaterial to improve the efficiency of signal enhancement. However, antibodies and enzymes, as well as other biomacromolecules, often present on their surface at various sites of different chemo-physical feature, liable to interfering interactions, also adding uncertainty to the interactions with nanomaterial of sizeable surface-to-volume ratio. Adding to this complexity is the fact that many biomacromolecules are employed as reagents, added step-by-step after the initial protein-probe interaction. Therefore a series of reactions of different spatiotemporal features takes place in the biosensing system. These characteristics tend to make the biosensing interactions as complicated as that in actual cellular life, where a large number of proteins are engaging in dynamic interplays. This complexity of the living system of protein interactions may explain that it is not unusual for biomedical research to arrive at contradictory and confusing conclusion on newly discovered interactions. But it is these interactions that compose the molecular mechanism of pathological processes, so"

It becomes clear that the bioanalytical tools for detecting proteins need to be simpler, introducing the most minor complexity to the already complicated target protein interactions.\nOn how to simplify the biosensing system, inspiration could come from the living system of protein interactions where the non-covalent interplays between proteins are transient. If similar non-covalent molecular recognition of proteins can be designed to induce covalent cross-coupling, then protein interactions can become affixed and yield a more definite analytical readout (Koniev and Wagner, 2015; Sheng et al., 2015). Moreover, employed as biosensing elements, biomacromolecules that present a mosaic of different chemical sites naturally tend to invite the interference of weak but numerous non-specific interactions. If artificial targeting agents such as aptamers and peptides are utilized (Song et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017), their definite and straightforward chemical structure may reduce, to a great extent, such interference and complexity. Besides, simple artificial targeting ligands may also enable the design of a \u201ccompact probe\u201d in which target-binding, signal conversion, and amplification can all be packed together, sparing the multi-step addition of reagents that accounts for the second\nsource of complexity and interference. Such a covalent and reagent-less protein assay may prove more feasible and robust for future in-field applications.\nBased on these considerations we have designed a peptidebased covalent and reagent-less protein biosensing probe with enzyme-free signal enhancement. The reactivity of tyrosine (Wong and Wessel, 2008) and Cu ion (Skounas et al., 2010) under an electrochemically controlled oxidizing and reducing microenvironment has been enlisted to enable this new design. A linear peptide probe is designed to be of four motifs (Scheme 1A): (1) an N-terminal DAHK motif complexed with Cu ion (Hureau et al., 2011), (2) a tyrosine-containing and flexible poly-G linker, derived at the side chain of D in the DAHK the motif, immobilizing the probe onto the biosensing surface, (3) a protein targeting sequence to the C-terminal of DAHK the motif, and (4) the C-terminal poly tyrosine (40\u2013200 moieties) as signal amplifier using electrochemical oxidation of the significant numbers of tyrosyl residuals. Upon electrochemical activation, DAHK-Cu can catalyze oxidative cross-linking of tyrosine moieties (Li et al., 2016) (framed sub-scheme on the right of Scheme 1b). The tyrosine moieties in the motif (2) and (4) are separated by the targeting sequence, a long sequence, so their spontaneous cross-linking can be prevented by the large entropy obstacle of\nSCHEME 1 The proposed method for protein detection using protein-triggered, conformation-driven, Cu (II) facilitated side-chain di-tyrosine cyclization of the peptide probe.

Protein binding may confine the protein targeting motif (3) in a more stable and curved-back conformation, facilitating the cross-linking (Scheme 1B, right), or the di-tyrosine cyclization reaction between tyrosine in poly tyrosine motif (4) and that in motif (2). While catalyzing the cross-linking, the N-terminal DAHK motif is also destroyed by Cu-catalyzed oxidative cleavage (Lee and Oe, 2016; Li et al., 2017) (Scheme 1C, detailed reaction process as shown in the framed sub-scheme to the right). Therefore all protein-free probes will lose their poly-tyrosine motif (4) (Scheme 1C, left), leaving only the motif (4) of protein-bound probes crosslinked with the stocks of the probe (Scheme 1C, right for signal amplification (Scheme 1D). This method has been applied in the quantification of several non-homologous proteins, as well as in clinical samples of hepatocellular carcinoma, with satisfactory analytical performance for different targets and in clinical settings. These results may promise the future application of the proposed methods for low-cost and robust protein detection in clinical practice. The proposed method generates fluorophore directly, rather than using quenching mechanisms, promising greatly lowered background and high sensitivity. This design has been demonstrated using a marker protein and therapeutic target of osteosarcoma, (Shi et al., 2019), integrin, which has been involved in various pathological signaling during the progress towards osteosarcoma (Vihinen et al., 1996; Guo et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016). As integrin signaling often involves G protein (Wang et al., 2019), this protein has also been included as a relevant target, while avidin is selected as a reference target to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method."

            "text": "The proposed method is as illustrated in Scheme 1; its design has been demonstrated using three types of non-homogeneous proteins: integrin (\u03b11\u03b21), G protein subunit \u03b11 (G\u03b11), and avidin, the targeting peptides (Meyer et al., 2006; Millward et al., 2007; Mas-Moruno et al., 2010) (their sequences as in Supplementary Figure S1) towards these three model proteins all tend to adopt a curved conformation when binding, favoring the proposed mechanism to work. The binding of these protein-targeting sequences in the designed probe has been first validated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to record the kinetics of peptide-protein binding. (Supplementary Figure S2), and relatively strong 1:1 binding can be observed for the tested probes.\nThe designed protein-triggered, conformation-driven, Cu (II) facilitated side-chain di-tyrosine cyclization of the peptide probe, is studied and investigated using various methods. First, possible Cu catalysis is studied using electrochemical methods (Figure 1). Figure 1A shows that when a target protein is detected using the\nmethod planned in Scheme 1, a pair of aligned reversible redox oxidation peaks can be seen for the Cu(II) ion complexed by the surface-tethered probe. As the electrochemical scan proceeded, the oxidation peak narrowed and the redox peak correspondingly increased; however, it gradually stopped after mutual reduction of the scan and the original tyrosine (Figures 1B, C). These may suggest that Cu co-promotes electrochemical dityrosine crosslinking: Figure 1A shows how Cu(I) reduced from Cu(II) at the electrode is oxidized back to Cu(II) to catalyze the crosslinking. As a result, there is less and less Cu(I) that can be oxidized by the electrode and more and more Cu(II) waiting to be reduced. Figure 1D shows the development of H2O2, which is consistent with earlier results for Cucatalyzed free-radical oxidative bis-tyrosine crosslinking, suggesting that reducing ions may use free radicals to catalyze crosslinking via a Fenton-like mechanism (Smith et al., 2007). By measuring and computing the surface density of the tethered probe (Supplementary Figure S3) and substituting a ferrocene tag for the poly-Tyr amplifier, the possibility of inter-probe di-tyrosine cross-linking may be ruled out. Given the short half-life of the radicals produced by the Cu ion and the electrochemical scanning, inter-probe cross-linking can be suppressed if the duration of scanning is controlled.\nThen, using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (X-band EPR), the Cu(II) complex of DAHK, potential Cu catalysis, and DAHK self-cleavage are examined (Figure 2A). Cu(II) may be detected with a typical four-peak separation; g is 2.21; and A has a peak separation of around 184 G (about 570 MHz), showing that the square plane is coordinated with four N-coordinated ligands (Gala et al., 2014). As the electrochemical scan advances, the sampled EPR signal loses significance, while other peaks, such as those identifying Cu(III), grow complicated around 2,000, 3,400, and 4,100 G, are absent (Krebs et al., 1999). These findings could point to selfcleavage of the coordination site, electrochemical reduction of Cu(I) incapable of complexing with the peptide, or both. The electrochemical data mentioned above could point to a decrease of Cu(I) (Figure 1A). The cleavage of polytyrosine may be confirmed by charting the electrochemical response of polytyrosine during the course of the electrochemical scanning process (Figures 2B, C). These two complementary results reveal that the solution response and the surface response vary reciprocally. And this may indicate the oxidative decomposing of the polytyrosine chain, generating the observed signal (Supplementary Figure S4), according to a previous report (Gao and Cranston, 2010).\nParalleling the above observation, the sensing of the surface is also studied using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the surface plasma resonance (SPR) method (Figures 3A, B). In the SPR result, a control probe using GHK in the place of DAHK to prevent the selfcleavage (only an N-terminal D can be cleaved shows a shallower slope in the dissociation phase, indicating the existence of self-cleavage for the original probe. Meanwhile, the step-by-step EIS with gradually longer electrochemical scanning time also shows more and more evident losses of impedance, recorded after the violent rinsing; this may also support the above observation of self-cleavage.\nUsing GHK substituted probes the electrochemical peeled off [by the electrochemical opening of the Au-S bond (Wildt et al., 2010)] from the sensing surface after the violent rinsing step in Scheme 1, and the induced target-induced conformational change can be studied using circular dichroism (CD) (Figure 3C) on the GHK control peptide that cannot self-cleave. In the absence of the target protein,\nFIGURE 5 Assay-graded clinical samples\u2019 square-wave voltammetric signal responses were displayed as data distributions for the osteosarcoma condition group and the benign condition group, respectively. Asterisks signify statistical differences of more than 5%.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org06\nrandom coil and beta-sheet components are the most evident; with the beta-sheet attributable to the poly-Tyr signal amplifier, the random coil may be assigned to the targeting sequence that represents the most significant length of the rest of the probe. On the contrary, after protein binding and electrochemical scanning, the turn component becomes more evident. Together, these may indicate protein binding induced conformational changes being successfully captured by crosslinking, validating the proposed mechanism. As a control, a peptide derived from p53 to target MDM2, and with a known stiffened \u03b1-Helix linear form upon binding with MDM2 (Pazgier et al., 2009), can show an almost totally compromised signal response (Figure 3D), confirming the proposed design and its feasibility for the loop and turn conformations that are at least as abundant as the linear helix, as encountered in protein-protein interactions.\nIn the proposed design, the sample was first incubated with the sensing surface for a time, before the whole sensing system was brought to electrochemical scanning; so both the time for preincubation and that for electrochemical scanning have to be optimized. It can be expected that both prolonged incubation and scanning will lead to elevated false positives as the background interference. To suppress this background, prolonged time courses are recorded for both conditions, and contracted with an incorrect positive background time course recorded using BSA as the nonspecific control (Supplementary Figure S5). From the resulted time plots, it is clear that the background can rise to evidence after or around the saturation of incubation or scanning is achieved, so a time point slightly before saturation is selected for the two conditions, to succeed as large as possible response with an acceptable background false positive.\nQuantitative assay performance was assessed in conjunction with the condition optimization discussed above (Figures 4A\u2013F), demonstrating that the fluorescent signal readout grows according to the logarithm of the target concentration, with a limit of detection., also considering the above-selected background level, to be in the range of 1\u201310 p.m. The specificity is as shown in Figures 4G\u2013I. The electrochemical signal of the polytyroine strand can also be used o quantify the target proteins, as shown in Supplementary Figure S6. A few osteosarcoma cancer tissue samples retrieved during resection and grouped by the TNM staging rule are employed for clinical test. After lysis and fraction, the cellular membrane fraction, containing integrin (\u03b11\u03b21) and used for detection can reveal important group differences between matched paracancerous benign samples and cancer samples (Figure 5). Still, statistically significant differences among stages cannot be observed. The observed elevation of integrin, associated with the development of osteosarcoma cancer, is consistent with previous biomarker report (Boudjadi et al., 2013)."

Specifically, a peptide probe containing two tyrosine moieties as two potential covalent bridging sites is designed with the two sites separated by a\nrelatively long protein-targeting sequence; outside of this portion, the linear peptide is extended, at one terminus, by a surface immobilization sequence for tethering onto a sensing surface; and a poly-tyrosine electrochemical oxidative signal amplification sequence, at the other end. The binding of the target protein can lock the peptide in a curved form favoring dityrosine cross-linking, At the same time, a DAHK sequence between the two tyrosine bridging sites, and in the vicinity of the protein-targeting sequence, can be electrochemically controlled to cleave itself, resulting in only the protein-bound thus di-tyrosine bridged probe still retaining the amplification sequence. This design may greatly simplify the biosensing scheme and process of biosensor manufacturing, with improved feasibility and robustness towards the field clinical application."
