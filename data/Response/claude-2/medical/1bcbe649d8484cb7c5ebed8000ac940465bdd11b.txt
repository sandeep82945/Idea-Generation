 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct clinical trials comparing afatinib to 3rd generation EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib as first-line treatment for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations like G719X, L861Q, and S768I. The paper suggests afatinib has good efficacy in these patients, but head-to-head trials against newer agents are lacking.

2. Evaluate mechanisms of resistance to afatinib in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The paper mentions this is still unclear compared to classical EGFR mutations. Studies could examine rates of secondary T790M mutations versus other resistance mechanisms. 

3. Explore combinations with afatinib to overcome resistance, such as afatinib plus cetuximab for T790M-mediated resistance. The paper proposes this combination may help overcome T790M-based resistance. Clinical trials could test this hypothesis.

4. Conduct trials comparing first-line afatinib to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in patients with specific uncommon EGFR mutations. The optimal first-line treatment is still uncertain for many uncommon mutations. Head-to-head comparisons would help guide management.

5. Analyze outcomes with afatinib in larger cohorts of patients with specific uncommon exon 20 insertion mutations. The paper notes efficacy varies based on specific insertion subtype. Larger subtype-specific analyses could help determine which benefit most from afatinib.
