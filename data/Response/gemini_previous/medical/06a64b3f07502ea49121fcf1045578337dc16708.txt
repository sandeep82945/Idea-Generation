1. **Investigate the use of AI in detecting lung cancer at an earlier stage:** 
Explore the potential of AI algorithms to identify pre-cancerous lesions or early-stage lung cancer, which could lead to improved patient outcomes through early intervention.


2. **Develop AI algorithms that can accurately differentiate between different types of lung cancer:** 
This would aid in providing more personalized treatment options for patients, as different types of lung cancer respond differently to various therapies.


3. **Explore the use of AI in predicting the response of lung cancer patients to different treatments:** 
This could help clinicians tailor treatment plans to individual patients, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes.


4. **Investigate the potential of AI in monitoring the progression of lung cancer and detecting recurrence:** 
This could enable timely intervention and improve patient survival rates.


5. **Develop AI-powered decision support systems to assist clinicians in diagnosing and managing lung cancer:** 
These systems could provide real-time guidance to clinicians, helping them make more informed decisions and improve patient care.
