    "abstractText": "The general purpose of this study is to promote access to haptic virtual environments. Using a haptic device, people with and without visual impairments (VI) are able to feel different textures and compare these textures based on different surface properties, i.e., friction and hardness. The objectives of this study were to examine the following: (a) whether the variables of friction and hardness were identifiable through the Touch device (Phantom Omni) and could therefore function as 3D haptic variables; (b) if there were differences between people with VI and sighted individuals in terms of their performance; (c) the differences that should exist between the values of each variable so that the virtual surfaces could be identified as different to each other; and (d) if the individual characteristics of participants have an impact on their performance. The results showed that it is necessary to use surfaces which are differentiated based on the degree of friction and hardness because the haptic properties of a virtual object are then better perceived. Individuals with VI need more time and more effort to understand friction and hardness, respectively. With the motivation of increasing access to object perception for people with VI in a virtual environment, accessibility advisors and experts can extract useful information for the development of functional and efficient 3D objects for haptic perception.",

            "text": "Even nowadays, the use of graphic communication has excluded individuals with VI [1], as they are deprived of visual information [2]. However, innovative technology and software can transfer information not only by auditory and visual means, but also by adding the sense of touch [3,4]. Touch is important in our everyday interactions, and allows perception of, and interaction with, objects [5]. Object information can be separated into both geometrical (such as shapes) and material properties [6\u20139], with variability in them directly affecting identification [10]. Object recognition studies have put emphasis on the shape rather than material and surface properties [11,12]. The surface properties of an object can both provide useful information on the object\u2019s identity [11] and increase the naturalness of virtual environments [13]. A basic distinction between tactile (the physical environment) and haptic (the virtual environment) perception should be made. During tactile perception, people have the ability to use their fingers directly on a stimulus and explore it in detail. However, when objects are placed between the fingers and the stimulus, fewer features can be perceived [7]. Thus, in the case of haptic perception which involves the use of a force feedback device, a stylus is placed between the fingers and the stimulus, resulting in the user touching only one point of the 3D object at a time [14,15]. In this case, it has been suggested that only specific features of the stimulus, such as vibration and roughness, can be perceived by moving the handle towards or across the virtual surface [16].\nSensors 2022, 22, 9745. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22249745 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 9745 2 of 11\nThree subjective dimensions and specific features\u2014roughness, hardness, and stickiness/slipperiness\u2014dominate the haptic perception of surfaces [17]. Roughness is another dimension of surfaces and is formed mainly by differentiating the height or/and the pattern of the elements on a surface, as well as the distance among them [7,18]. In addition, changes in the friction of a virtual surface can change how rough this surface feels [19]. Friction is defined by stickiness and slipperiness and is one dimension of a surface [20]. Finally, hardness is defined by the degree of intrusion of one object (for instance, the finger or the virtual cursor) into another (a physical object or a virtual object with respect to the previous example). Only one of these dimensions\u2014roughness\u2014has been widely studied [20,21]. The dimension of roughness has been studied by many researchers using haptic feedback devices [14,18,19,22\u201328]. Most of these studies included sighted individuals, apart from the ones by Jansson et al. [14] and Kornbrot et al. [26] in which blind and sighted individuals participated. The findings of these studies support the perception of roughness in virtual surfaces with and without vision. More specifically, Kornbrot et al. [26] found that status of vision was not correlated with roughness perception and Jansson [23] found that the blindfolded participants in his research performed well, suggesting that blind individuals would have performed equally well or perhaps even better. However, when he conducted a similar study including both individuals with blindness and sighted individuals, he concluded that there were differences in performance between the two groups [14,24]. The second major dimension\u2014hardness\u2014has been much less studied than that of roughness in a virtual environment. Few studies, such as [29\u201332], have dealt with the perception of hardness simulated by haptic feedback devices. Specifically, the devices used in these studies were the Phantom Omni, a one degree of freedom force display, the Phantom, and the Freedom6S hand controller, respectively. Additionally, people with VI did not participate in these studies. Regarding the third dimension of surface haptic perception, stickiness and slipperiness are related to the dimension of friction [20]. Few studies, such as [21,33,34], have investigated the perception of friction using haptic feedback devices, especially the Phantom device used by participants without VI in these studies. Evidently, people with VI have not participated in the majority of the aforementioned studies. As technology is advancing at a rapid rate, it is increasingly important to consider the different capabilities of many users [35]. Haptics in virtual environments enables users, including individuals with VI, to feel, touch, and interact with virtual objects in such environments [35]. Given that haptics in these environments can be implemented in various fields, such as education, cartography, games, and cultural heritage, it is important to ensure accessibility to them. For example, virtual reality applications are commonly used in museums, but the major disadvantage of them is that they do not allow visitors to experience the tactile exploration of cultural heritage artifacts [36], and so they are still far from accessible to users with VI. The general idea of this study is to explore how to improve accessibility to a haptic virtual environment. For example, how can people with VI perceive the artifacts/objects of a museum if tactile exploration is not allowed? In this case, the perception of artifacts can become available through haptic devices, such as the Haption Virtuose 6D Force Feedback Device, the Geomagic Touch X (formerly Sensable Phantom Desktop), the (formerly known as) Phantom Omni Force Feedback Haptic Device (now \u201cTouch\u201d), or NOVINT Falcon 3D Force Feedback Haptic Device. However, the use of haptic devices with digital 3D object models cannot provide the information needed to fully and accurately identify and understand 3D objects. The application of 3D haptic variables/properties to digital 3D models through properly designed applications could fill this gap. Thus, the basic concept of this study is the identification of 3D haptic variables which could be applied to the construction of 3D objects that a user would sense through a haptic feedback device. For instance, the recognition of a 3D artifact that represents a human face could be enabled and finally achieved by applying\nSensors 2022, 22, 9745 3 of 11\ndifferent textures on the surfaces. The differentiation of textures could be based on the use of different haptic variables (e.g., roughness or hardness) or the use of the same haptic variable but with different values (e.g., hardness of higher and lower value) so that the facial features could be sensed differently. Although 2D haptic variables have been referred to previously, such as in [37] (p. 94), 3D haptic variables/properties have not yet been specified. The present study is the first in a series of surveys that we plan to conduct in the coming years to determine 3D haptic variables for different haptic devices. The general objective of the present study was to investigate the appropriateness of utilizing the 3D haptic properties/variables of friction and hardness to develop differently sensed surfaces identifiable through a haptic feedback device. In the present study, friction and hardness were examined using the same and different surfaces with regard to their exponent, i.e., the value that defines the degree of friction or hardness. The specific objectives of the study were to examine the following: (a) whether the variables of friction and hardness were identifiable through the Touch haptic device (Phantom Omni), and could therefore function as easily identifiable 3D haptic variables; (b) if there were differences between people with VI and sighted individuals in the identification of friction and hardness through the Touch haptic device; (c) the differences that should exist between the values of each variable (friction and hardness) so that the virtual surfaces can be identified as different to each other (e.g., the user of the haptic device should feel that they were touching surfaces with different levels of friction); and (d) if the individual characteristics of participants have an impact on their performance in the experiment."

The mean age at onset of VI was 4.89 (SD = 6.94), and the mean age of vision loss was 11.1 (SD = 9.11). In addition, the years living with VI were calculated (age minus age at onset of VI) (M = 27.7, SD = 13.5). None of the participants had cutaneous or kinesthetic impairments. In terms of the level of education of individuals with VI, 16 participants were university students, 16 were university graduates, 9 had graduated from high school, 2 had graduated from junior high school, 1 was an adult high school student, and 1 had graduated from an institute of vocational training. With regard to the educational level of the sighted participants, 20 were university graduates, 9 were university students, 9 had a master\u2019s degree, 3 had graduated from high school, and 2 had a Ph.D. Fourteen individuals with VI had previous experience with similar haptic feedback devices, but none of the sighted participants had any similar experience before the experiment. Moreover, participants with VI were asked to refer to the reading media they used. Thirty-four participants stated that their reading media was Braille or audio-supported reading, three said that they used (magnifier) books with low vision aids, and eight stated that they used both Braille/audio-supported reading and (magnifier) books with low vision aids."

This device was formerly known as the Phantom Omni, but it has since been named (Geomagic) Touch [39].

Haptic and tactile attributes such as stiffness and static and dynamic friction can be assigned to each node with the help of xml tags. The experiment took place in a quiet room. Each participant sat comfortably in front of the Touch (see Figure 1). Sighted and low-vision participants were blindfolded during the experiment. Before starting the experiment, participants were informed of the safety of the device and told how to use the stylus connected to the haptic feedback device.

            "text": "According to the results, all the participants spent more time examining surfaces that were the same as far as the exponent of friction was concerned. On the contrary, surfaces that differed in terms of the friction exponent were more or less easy for the participants. This means that when friction is being examined as a 3D surface property, differentiation is necessary for time saving during exploratory tasks. Similarly, Ziherl and Munih [34] found that rendering materials in a virtual environment using the friction model implies identification and difficulties, and therefore suggested exaggerating friction properties in order to enable the user. Furthermore, when hardness is being examined, a high exponent of differentiation is needed for the most efficient and time-saving perception of the 3D stimuli. In the present study, with reference both to their score and the time needed to complete the trial, participants performed better when the surfaces presented the greatest differentiation in hardness. This is in line with the results of previous studies. It has been suggested that when the stiffness of a surface is maximized the vibratory frequency is raised [29,30]. Consequently, the feedback (i.e., the intensity of stimulation) on the user\u2019s receptors (skin, fingers, etc.) is increased and, as a result, the user perceives hardness more easily [31].\nSensors 2022, 22, 9745 9 of 11"

            "text": "As in the present research, when Hollins and his colleagues [18] examined the perception of stiffness (hardness) using various exponents they arrived at the same exponent (1.01) and found that there was a clear effect caused by stiffness differentiation size in terms of the participants\u2019 understanding of the surfaces. The result of the study mentioned above that deviates from the present research is the exponent\u2019s size for friction. Hollins et al. [18] suggested a 1.49 exponent for stickiness (friction), while in the present study both 0.35 and 0.70 were effective when they were compared to different exponent-size surfaces. A hypothesis that could be formulated with certainty is that Hollins et al. [18] followed a research design where the participants were allowed specific exploratory movements, while in our case participants were not restricted. In addition, they themselves found that the change in exploratory behavior led to different results. When discussing friction and hardness in combination, the main conclusion is that both need a degree of exponent differentiation between similar surfaces with respect to the range of values in each case. Hardness, especially, needs the greatest possible differentiation as it appears to create more difficulties in haptic perception. Of course, a surface\u2019s formation or geometry could have an impact on the comprehensibility of the virtual object, and thus create the need for a different friction and/or hardness exponent. According to Mart\u00ednez et al.\u2019s study [8], when the 3D stimulus was not a geometric shape, subjects scanned the surface at a constant speed to examine the frequency of the marks and perceive the texture. This means that, based on vibration, the subject can acquire the necessary information. If this is the case then someone could conclude that it is vibratory feedback which differentiates friction from hardness. Hardness seems to lack the appropriate vibratory feedback and that is probably why it needs the maximum possible exponent. Heller [10] observed in his study that, in smoother surfaces, individuals changed their exploratory study by pushing their index against the surface, probably in an attempt to maximize the vibratory or frictional sense. Hollins and his colleagues [18] actually proved Heller\u2019s [10] observation with virtual surfaces. They found that, when participants were permitted to press down firmly on the surfaces, the magnitude of property estimation was higher than estimations performed after gentle pressure. Thus, in cases where a subject encounters both (a) haptic exploration through a force feedback device (which by definition entails identification restrictions since the contact with the stimulus is mediated by a stylus) and (b) a stimulus (such as a hard surface that does not provide enough vibratory or frictional cues), identification becomes more difficult and time consuming compared to surfaces with ample vibratory feedback."

            "text": "Moreover, specific attention should be directed to the case of users of force feedback devices with VI. When 3D objects are prepared for haptic exploration by users with VI, more time should be available to them to identify friction compared to the time users without VI might need. In the research of Jansson et al. [22], four out of the ten participants had difficulties completing the experiment, though these participants improved their performance after training. As far as hardness is concerned, users with VI faced more difficulties in identifying surfaces with hardness differentiation and, thus, a great hardness exponent should be applied on surfaces. In line with this result, Hollins et al. [18] found that when vision was obstructed, exploratory behavior was altered. Additionally, motor behavior was variable, though downward force exerted was increased because of the difficulty of distinguishing the stimulus."

For instance, statues in museums could be rendered virtually, and visitors with and without blindness could access them by touching the facial features. Cultural and popular tourist destinations could provide 3D models for orientation which would elevate their level of accessibility. In addition, accessible educational material could be developed for students with severe VI so that they receive support for the textual information they receive with the figurative content. To conclude, accessibility advisors and experts could definitely exploit the results of the present study. It should be noted that to achieve the standardization of 3D haptic objects for individuals with and without VI, a more holistic approach should be followed. This means that exponent escalation could be examined in more detail, while other variables/surface properties should be studied alone or in combination with each other. Future research should focus on this.\nAuthor Contributions: Conception and design of experiments: K.P.; performance of experiments: E.G. and V.K.; analysis of data: K.P. and E.K.; writing of the manuscript: K.P., E.K., E.G. and V.K.
