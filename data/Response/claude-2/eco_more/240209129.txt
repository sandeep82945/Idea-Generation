 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Extend the analysis to settings with more complex trader preferences beyond additive and quasilinear utility. The paper focuses on additive quasilinear settings for simplicity, but many real-world preferences are more complex. Studying optimal market making under richer preference models could reveal new economic insights.

2. Investigate optimal market making in dynamic settings. The current analysis considers a one-shot interaction, but real markets evolve over time. Studying repeated interactions between market makers and informed traders could reveal interesting temporal effects. 

3. Incorporate budget constraints for the market maker. The paper assumes the market maker has unlimited budget, but real-world market makers have financial constraints. Adding budget constraints could change the structure of optimal mechanisms.

4. Consider competition between multiple market makers. The paper studies a monopolist market maker, but many real markets have competing market makers. Analyzing the effects of competition on optimal mechanism design would be interesting.

5. Empirically test the performance of the proposed mechanisms in real markets. The theoretically optimal mechanisms may perform differently in practice. Field experiments could provide insights into how the mechanisms work in real trading environments.
