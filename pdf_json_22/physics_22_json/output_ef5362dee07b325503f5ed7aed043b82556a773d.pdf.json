    "abstractText": "The semi-source independent quantum walk random number generator (SI-QW-QRNG) is a cryptographic protocol that extracts a string of true random bits from a quantum random walk with an adversary controls a randomness source, but the dimension of the system is known. This paper analyzes SI-QW-QRNG protocols with a memory-based quantum walk state. The new protocol utilizes a generalized coin operator with various parameters to optimize the randomness of the quantum walk state. We focus on evaluations of the protocols in multiple scenarios and walk configurations. Moreover, we show some interesting behavior of the system depending on the size of the memory space and the number of quantum coins.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nA string of uniform and independent (true) random bits from random number generation has an essential role in many fields, such as cryptography, scientific simulations, game-theoretic protocols, artificial intelligence, lotteries, and basic physical tests. These works depend on the unpredictability of random numbers. Pseudo-random numbers generated via classical processes generally cannot guarantee intrinsic unpredictability. But quantum random number generation (QRNG) can produce true random numbers because of the inherent randomness throughout quantum processes. So, researching quantum random number generation (QRNG) is essential in quantum information science and engineering. Currently, cryptographically secure QRNG protocols are well-reviewed, ranging from the case of all devices utilized, sources, and measurements are fully characterized, called \u201cfully trusted-device\u201d scenario, to the case of all apparatuses operated in a QRNG protocol are not trusted, \u201cdevice-independent (DI)\u201d approach [1]\u2013[3]. The DI-QRNG protocol is the ideal model because of its minimal assumptions for security from a cryptographic point of view. A practical experiment for the DI-QRNG protocol has been rapidly improving, but the bit-rates of such protocols cannot comply with other models [7]\u2013[9]. As a midpoint, the source independent (SI) model was introduced in [5] by assuming measurement devices are characterized, but the source is under the control of a dishonest party, called an adversary. In the SI model, a user wishes to generate cryptographically secure random bits without trusting the server that is probably under the adversary\u2019s control. For further information, we refer the reader to view a survey of QRNG [11].\nMoreover, quantum walks (QW) are the quantum analog of classical random walks, which is an essential process in\nquantum computation [16]\u2013[28] and, recently, in quantum cryptography [43]\u2013[46]. Lately, a QW-based random number generation (QW-QRNG) protocol was introduced in [47]. The first security analysis of the QW-QRNG protocol is provided to be secure in the semi-source independent (SI) model [48]. In this paper, we extend the results from [48] to show a more rigorous evaluation of the SI-QW-QRNG protocol with different walk parameters such as alternative coin operators and alternative models such as history-dependent quantum walks [29]\u2013[34]. The history-dependent quantum walk is one of the memory-based quantum walk models in which the walker exploits memory coins as it evolves. The state of the history-dependent walker contains its evolution history in the memory coins. In this paper, we employ the history-dependent quantum walk state to design a memory-based QW-QRNG protocol as the SI secure model.\nWe make three primary contributions to this paper. First, we develop a memory-based QW-QRNG protocol with various cases. Second, we analyze the multiple protocols from a cryptographic perspective, which produces secure systems and proves they are secured in the SI model. This analysis designates the first memory-based QW-QRNG protocol in the SI security model. Our proof utilizes the method of quantum sampling by Bouman and Fehr [68], expanded with techniques we developed in [48], [67] for entropic uncertainty. Thirdly, we carefully and thoroughly evaluate the various protocols with the Hadamard, generalized, and coin-flip operators [45] in the memory-based walker\u2019s evolution to optimize a random bit rate. We show some fascinating manners of the quantum random number generation procedures depending on increasing the size of the memory space and the number of quantum coins over different noises in simulated channels. For example, our protocols can improve the random bit rate against overall noises with an odd number of qubits and enhance the random bit rate of the low-dimensional position space against general noises with an even number of qubits. This odd-even behavior shows in various areas of quantum physics, such as magnetic molecular clusters, quantum dots, heavy-ion collisions, Bernal-stack trilayer graphene, the quantum Ising chain, and the quantum Szilard machine [88]\u2013[109]. Further understanding the memory-based QW-QRNG may open the door to constructing a new quantum cryptographic application, such as memory-based QW-Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ar X iv :2 20 7. 08 97 3v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 1\nO ct\n2 02\n2\nand designing a nonlocal game with an entangled quantum walk state without the freedom of will assumption that may lead to the efficient DI-QRNG and QKD with less loopholes."

            "text": "In this section, we introduce underlying definitions and notations that will be used all over this paper. A notation Ad means a d-dimensional alphabet, that is, Ad = {0, ..., d\u2212 1}. So, consider a word q \u2208 ANd and a random subset t \u2286 [N ], where [N ] = {1, 2, ..., N}. Then a new word qt represents the substring of q indexed by t, namely a letter in q indexed by i \u2208 t. A string qt\u0304 implies the complement of qt in q. The Hamming Weight of q is a function wt(q) = |{i : qi 6= 0}|. And the relative Hamming weight is w(q) = wt(q)/|q|.\nA Hermitian positive semi-definite operator of unit trace that acts on a Hilbert spaceH is a density operator. Suppose a pure quantum state |\u03d5\u3009 \u2208 H is given. Then the density operator of the pure state is denoted |\u03d5\u3009\u3008\u03d5|. We simplify it as the symbol [\u03d5] to mean |\u03d5\u3009\u3008\u03d5|.\nA notation H(X) means the Shannon entropy of a random variable X . And hd(x) represents the d-ary entropy function, which is defined as: hd = x logd(d \u2212 1) \u2212 x logd(x) \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) logd(1 \u2212 x). Also, a definition H\u0304d(x) is the extended dary entropy function which is identical to hd(x) for all x \u2208 [0, 1\u22121/d], is 0 for all x < 0, otherwise 1 for all x > 1\u22121/d.\nSuppose \u03c1BE be a quantum state that acts on an arbitrary Hilbert space HB\u2297HE . The conditional quantum min entropy [55] is defined as follows: H\u221e(B|E)\u03c1 = sup\u03c3E max{\u03bb \u2208 R : 2\u2212\u03bbIB \u2297 \u03c3E \u2212 \u03c1BE \u2265 0}, where IB is the identity operator on HB . Consider that \u03c1B = \u2211 b pb[b] means the E system is trivial and the B portion is classical. So, its min entropy is H\u221e(B) = \u2212 log maxb pb. The smooth conditional min entropy [55] is defined as follows: H\u03b5\u221e(B|E)\u03c1 = sup\u03c3\u2208\u0393\u03b5(\u03c1)H\u221e(B|E)\u03c3, where \u0393\u03b5(\u03c1) = {\u03c3 : \u2016\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c1\u2016 \u2264 \u03b5}. Note that \u2016X\u2016 is the trace distance of operator X .\nIf the E portion is classical, namely the quantum-classical state \u03c1BE = \u2211 e pe\u03c1 e B \u2297 [e], then it can be shown that: H\u221e(B|E)\u03c1 \u2265 mineH\u221e(B)\u03c1e . Moreover, the quantumquantum-classical state \u03c1BER has the following inequality. Let the quantum-quantum-classical state \u03c1BER be of the form \u03c1BER = \u2211 r pr \u00b7 \u03c1rBE \u2297 [r], where the R portion is classical. Then we have the following inequality:\nH\u221e(B|ER)\u03c1 \u2265 min r H\u221e(B|E)\u03c1r , (1)\nwhich proof is not difficult to show by using the above definitions regarding the conditional quantum min entropy.\nSuppose a classic-quantum state \u03c1BE is given.

            "text": "Several memory-based quantum walk models have been\nintroduced, including the quantum walk with memory [29]\u2013 [32], the non-repeating quantum walk [23], and the quantum walk with recycled coins [33]. We briefly review the quantum walk with recycled coins, called the history-dependent quantum walk (HD-QW), with additional memory space to store the coin-flip history [33]. The process involves a Hilbert space HW = HP \u2297 HC0 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 HC\u03ba\u22121 where HP is the P -dimensional position space, HCi is the 2-dimensional coin space, and \u03ba is the number of (all) recycled coins (memory coins and an active coin) in the HD-QW, where \u03ba \u2265 2 and P \u2208 N. Note that if \u03ba = 1, then the quantum walk is a non-history-dependent quantum walk state. The sub-space HM = HC0 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297HC\u03ba\u22122 can be considered as the memory coin space that keeps track of the coin-flip history. So, the Hilbert space can be written as HW = HP \u2297 HM \u2297 HC , where HC = Hc\u03ba\u22121 , and the dimension of the walker\u2019s space |W | is 2\u03ba \u00b7 P . The walker begins at some initial position |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009, e.g., |0, 0, ..., 0\u3009 from which a walk operator W is applied T times for walker\u2019s propagation. The evolution of the walk is decomposed into three stages by adding a memory operator M as follows:\nC : |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 \u2192 \u2211 c\u2032\u03ba\u22121 \u03b1 (x) c\u2032\u03ba\u22121 \u2223\u2223x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122, c\u2032\u03ba\u22121\u232a , S : |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 \u2192 |x+ (\u22121)c\u03ba\u22121 , c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122, c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 ,\nM : |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 \u2192 |x, c\u03ba\u22121, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122\u3009 , where ci \u2208 {0, 1} and all arithmetic in the position space is computed module P . Let W = M \u00b7 S \u00b7 C be the walk operator, where C = IP \u2297 IM \u2297 HC . The identity matrix IP enacts on walker\u2019s position |x\u3009 and IM is the identity matrix on walker\u2019s memory coins |c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122\u3009. And suppose the coin operator HC that applies on an active coin |c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 is the Hadamard operator. After T steps, the walker evolves to state WT |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009. At this point, a measurement may be done on the position and the coin spaces, causing a collapse at one of the P and \u03ba spots. We denote by |wx,c\u03ba\u3009 to mean the evolved state WT |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009. We also use |wi\u3009 when appropriate, using the natural relationship of tuples (x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121) to integers i, with (0, 0, ..., 0) being the first index i = 0.\nGiven an HD-QW state |wi\u3009, where i \u2208 {0, ..., 2\u03baP \u2212 1}, we use the notation P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u03ba)) = \u3008wi| [x] \u2297 [c\u03ba] |wi\u3009 to denote the probability that the walker is observed at a point of the position x \u2208 {0, ..., P \u2212 1} and coins c\u03ba = c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121 \u2208 {0, 1}\u03ba after we measure the state in a position and all recycled coins. The maximum probability is defined as: maxx,c\u03ba P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u03ba)). Since the walker\u2019s operation W along with the number of steps T , this maximum probability can be optimized as a function of walk parameters:\nG(\u03ba, P ) = min t max x,c\u03ba\nP(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u03ba)), (3)\nwhere t \u2208 T . When we measure the state in a position x and only memory coins c\u00b5 = c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122 \u2208 {0, 1}\u00b5, its probability\nis denoted as: P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u00b5)) = \u3008wi| [x]\u2297 [c\u00b5]\u2297 Ic\u03b1 |wi\u3009, where an identity operator Ic\u03b1 on an active coin |c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 \u2208 HC . The maximum probability function is defined as follows:\nG\u2032(\u03ba, P ) = min t max x,c\u00b5 P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u00b5)), (4)\nwhere t \u2208 T . Note that when the number of recycled coins of the HD-QW state is \u03ba = 1, that is, there is no memory coin space, so the probability is defined as: P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 x) = \u3008wi| [x]\u2297Ic\u03b1 |wi\u3009. So the function of the maximum probability is G\u2032(\u03ba, P ) = mint maxx P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 x). When we only measure the state in a position x, then the probability is that the walker is observed at position x after measurement, namely P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 x) = \u3008wi| [x] \u2297 Ic\u03ba |wi\u3009, where Ic\u03ba is an identity matrix on all recycled coins |c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 \u2208 HM \u2297HC . The maximum probability function is defined as follows:\nG\u2032\u2032(\u03ba, P ) = min t max x P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 x), (5)\nwhere t \u2208 T . To optimize further the function of the maximum probability, we also evaluate the protocols with the general form of the coin-rotation operator from [45], that is:,\nH \u2032C(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n[ ei\u03c6 cos(\u03b8) ei\u03c6 sin(\u03b8)\n\u2212e\u2212i\u03c6 sin(\u03b8) e\u2212i\u03c6 cos(\u03b8)\n] , (6)\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 is chosen by a user such that \u03b8, \u03c6 \u2208 {g\u03c0/R | g = 0, 1, ..., R} and R \u2208 Z>0 so that the evolution operator W = M \u00b7 S \u00b7H \u2032C . Moreover, a user employs a flipcoin operator fc\u03b1 that is an operator acting only on the active coin |c\u03ba\u22121\u3009, which is to \u201cflip\u201d the last coin at some initial state before evolving the walk. The flip-coin operators are as follows:\nI =\n[ 1 0\n0 1\n] , X =\n1\u221a 2\n[ 1 1\n1 \u22121\n] , Y =\n1\u221a 2\n[ 1 1\ni \u2212i\n] . (7)\nThe set of flip-coin operators is F = {I,X, Y }. So the quantum walker state with the above descriptions is as follows: for any time T \u2208 N and any initial state |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009, |wi\u3009 = WT (IP \u2297 Ic\u00b5 \u2297 fc\u03b1 |x, c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22121\u3009 , where fc\u03b1 \u2208 F acts on the active coin (when the context is clear, we forgo the subscript of fc\u03b1 to f ). When the memory-based QW-QRNG employs these generalized and flip-coin operators (6) and (7), the maximum probability (3) is redefined as follows:\nG(\u03ba, P, F ) = min t,f,\u03b8,\u03c6 max x,c\u03ba\nP(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u03ba)). (8)\nAlso, we define the maximum probability (4) is as follows:\nG\u2032(\u03ba, P, F ) = min t,f,\u03b8,\u03c6 max x,c\u00b5 P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u00b5)). (9)\nSimilar to the function (4), when the number of coins of the state is \u03ba = 1, the function (9) is defined as: G\u2032(\u03ba, P, F ) = mint,f,\u03b8,\u03c6 maxx P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 x). Lastly, the function of maximum probability (5) is described as follows:\nG\u2032\u2032(\u03ba, P, F ) = min t,f,\u03b8,\u03c6 max x P(|wi\u3009 \u2192 x). (10)"

They discovered an interesting connection relating classical sampling strategies with quantum ones, even when the quantum state is entangled with an environmental system such as an adversary. We review its concepts in this section, but we guide a reader to look through [68] for more details.\nSuppose a string q \u2208 ANd . A classical sampling method is a procedure of selecting a random subset t \u2282 [N ] to observe qt that is the subset of the string q indexed by t. Then it evaluates a target value of the undiscovered part, where a user can define the target function such as the Hamming weight in the unobserved portion [68]. In the sampling strategy, we will utilize sets of selecting a subset t of size m \u2264 N/2 uniformly at random to have a random subset qt and an output w(qt) as an estimate of the Hamming weight in the unobserved portion. The result was presented in [68] that, for \u03b4 > 0:\n\u03b5cl\u03b4 := max q\u2208ANd P(q 6\u2208 Bt,\u03b4) \u2264 2 exp ( \u2212\u03b42m(n+m) m+ n+ 2 ) , (11)\nwhere the probability is over all possible selections of subsets t and Bt,\u03b4 is the group of all \u201cgood\u201d words such that this sampling strategy is to almost likely produce a \u03b4-close estimate of the Hamming weight of the unobserved portion, namely:\nBt,\u03b4 = {q \u2208 ANd : |w(qt)\u2212 w(qt\u0304)| \u2264 \u03b4}.\nThe error probability of the classical sampling strategy is the value \u03b5cl\u03b4 , where the \u201ccl\u201d superscript means a classical sampling strategy.\nIn [68], Bouman and Fehr show the failure probabilities of the quantum sampling strategy are functions of the classical error probability. Let a basis be {|0\u3009 , ..., |d\u2212 1\u3009}. Precisely, the choice may be arbitrary, but it is then fixed; when we use this result, the basis will be the walk basis {WT |x, c\u03ba\u3009}x,c\u03ba = {|wi\u3009}i. Define the quantum analogue of the \u201cgood collection\u201d of classical words as follows [68]:\nspan(Bt,\u03b4) = span{|wi1 , ..., wiN \u3009 : |w(it)\u2212 w(it\u0304)| \u2264 \u03b4}.\nConsider that if given a state |\u03d5\u3009AE \u2208 span(Bt,\u03b4) \u2297 HE , then a measurement in the given basis performing on those qudits indexed by t leads to outcome q \u2208 Amd . Interestingly, it must keep the fact that the remaining state is a superposition of the form: |\u03d5t,q\u3009 = \u2211 i\u2208J \u03b1i |wi, Ei\u3009 , where J \u2282 {i \u2208 AN\u2212md : |w(i)\u2212w(q)| \u2264 \u03b4}.

It allows computing the lower bound of entropy of Z given E by using a mixed quantum state, that is, quantifying how much information an adversary E, prepares an entangled quantum state |\u03c8\u3009AE and sends A portion to Alice, has on measuring the state by Alice. The superposition lemma is as follows:\nLemma 1. Let |\u03c8\u3009AE and \u03c1mixAE be of the form: |\u03c8\u3009AE = \u2211 i\u2208J \u03b1i |i\u3009W \u2297|Ei\u3009 and \u03c1 mix AE = \u2211 i\u2208J |\u03b1i|2[i]W \u2297 [Ei],\nwhere |i\u3009W = |i1, ..., in\u3009W is the n-tensors of HD-QW states, J = {i \u2208 An2\u03baP : |w(i) \u2212 w(q)| \u2264 \u03b4} and n = N \u2212 m with m = |q|, q \u2208 {0, 1}m and N is the total number of signals from the adversarial source E to Alice A. Let \u03c1ZE and \u03c1mixZE = \u03c7ZE describe the hybrid systems obtained by measuring subsystem A of |\u03c8\u3009AE and \u03c1mixAE , respectively in basis {|z\u3009}z and tracing out a coin subspace out of all coin spaces, respectively. Then we have that:\nH\u221e(Z|E)\u03c1 \u2265 H\u221e(Z|E)\u03c7 \u2212 log2 |J |. (12)\nThe quantum sampling main result [68] translated for our application as follows:\nTheorem 1. Let \u03b4 > 0.

Our protocol is to generate a secure string of true random bits by using an HD-QW state [33]. Without loss of generality, the randomness source, possibly controlled by an adversary, prepares the N - walkers and sends them to Alice. If a source is honest, then it should prepare the state |w0\u3009\u2297N = ( WT |0, 0, ..., 0\u3009 )\u2297N , independent of HE and send it to Alice, but the adversarial source may prepare anything. Also, there are no assumptions on this state\u2019s overall structure beyond that it consists of the N - walkers, and it may even be non-i.i.d. The goal of the memorybased QW-QRNG is to produce a uniformly random string, independent of any adversary\u2019s system. The general memorybased QW-QRNG protocol is as follows: Public Parameters: The quantum walk setting includes the dimension of the position space P , the dimension of the coin space ci, the \u03ba-number of (all) recycled coins, the walker\u2019s unitary operator W , and the number of steps to evolve by T . The walker exploits the \u00b5 = \u03ba \u2212 1 number of memory coins |c\u00b5\u3009 = |c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122\u3009 as a memory of the coin evolution. When a user employs the generalized coin operator (6), an angle \u03b8 and a phase \u03c6 are public parameters, otherwise the Hadamard coin operator used. Also, if the protocol exploits the set of flip-coin operators, F , (7) that each operator flips the (last) active coin at some walker\u2019s initial state before the evolution, the set F is to be known to the public. Source: An untrusted source, possibly adversarial, produces an HD-QW state. |\u03c80\u3009 \u2208 HA \u2297 HE , where HA \u223c= H\u2297NW . If the source is honest, the state prepared should be of the form |\u03c80\u3009 = |w0\u3009\u2297N \u2297 |0\u3009E , namely, N -copies of the walker state |w0\u3009 = WT ( |0\u3009 \u2297 |0, ..., 0\u3009 ) unentangled with Eve E. Note that Alice can define which state is a honest state |w0\u3009.\nUser: Alice chooses a random subset t \u2282 [N ] of size m and measures the systems indexed by this subset using POVM W = { [w0], I \u2212 [w0] } = {W0,W1} resulting in outcomes q \u2208 {0, 1}m. She measures the remaining n-walker systems in a basis of measurements Z , where n = N \u2212m. The first outcome is used to test the fidelity of the received state while the second is used as a raw-random string r \u2208 An|Z|. Postprocessing: Alice applies privacy amplification to r, producing a final random string of size `. As proven in [4], the hash function used for privacy amplification need only be chosen randomly once and then reused for each run of the protocol for a QRNG protocol of this nature.\nThere are several cases of considered protocols for the memory-based QW-QRNG as follows. For each case, most settings are similar to the general protocol above, but a set of measurement operators Z in a randomness extraction mode is differently defined as follows."

Suppose that |\u03c8i\u3009AE be the quantum state that the dishonest source E creates and sends the A portion to Alice N -times with the fixed error \u03b5 > 0. If the source is honest, Alice receives the state |\u03c80\u3009AE = |w0\u3009 \u2297N \u2297 |E0\u3009, where\n|wi\u3009 \u2208 HW = HP \u2297 HM \u2297 HC and i \u2208 {0, ..., 2\u03baP \u2212 1}. Note that \u03ba is the number of all (memory and active) coins and P is the walker\u2019s positional dimension. By Theorem 1. in the quantum sampling, there exists ideal states, indexed over all subsets t \u2282 [N ] of size m such that |\u03d5t\u3009 \u2208 span ( |wi1 , ..., wiN \u3009 : |w(it) \u2212 w(it\u0304)| \u2264 \u03b4 ) \u2297 HE . Note that we define |w0\u3009 = |0\u3009P \u2297 |0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\u3009c\u00b5 \u2297 |0\u3009c\u03b1 , where c\u00b5 = c0, ..., c\u03ba\u22122 and c\u03b1 = c\u03ba\u22121. We utilize a similar approach, a two-step proof method, from [67], [48] to show the security. Analyzing the security of the ideal state \u03c3TAE = 1/T \u2211 t[t]\u2297 [\u03d5t], where T = ( N m ) and p(t) = 1/T is the first footstep. We measure the T register in \u03c3TAE , which leads the state to collapse to the superposition of ideal states |\u03d5t\u3009 that is a quantum analogy of a classical random sampling. After the quantum sampling, we measure the ideal states |\u03d5t\u3009 in a set of measurement POVM W to have q \u2208 {0, 1}m. It tests whether a sample of quantum states |wi\u3009 is honest or not. If the outcome is q = 0, i.e., |w0\u3009, Alice considers the state from the source is honest so that she can extract true randomness. Then the experiment traces out the measured portion of size m resulting in the post-measurement state \u03c3(t, q) acting on H\u2297n2\u03baP \u2297HE . Since |\u03d5t\u3009 \u2208 span(B\u03b4t,2\u03baP )\u2297HE , we claim that the post-measurement state is of the form:\n\u03c3(t, q) = \u2211\ne\u2208Awt(q) (2\u03baP )\u22121\npe \u00b7 \u03c3(e)AE , (25)\nwhere P (Z) = ZZ\u2217, wt(q) is the (non-relative) Hamming weight of q, \u03c3(e)AE = P (\u2211 i\u2208J(e)q \u03b1 (e) i |wi\u3009\u2297|Ei\u3009 ) , and J (e)q \u2282 {i \u2208 An2kP : |w(i)\u2212 w(q)| \u2264 \u03b4}. Recall n = N \u2212m. This is the form of the post-measurement state after the experiment is done. Indeed, note that |\u03d5t\u3009 is a superposition of vectors of the form {|wi\u3009 : |w(i) \u2212 w(q)| \u2264 \u03b4}. Thus, on observing q using POVM W on subspace indexed by t, but before tracing out the measured portion, the state is of the form:\n\u2211 e\u2208\u2126q \u221a pe |xe\u3009Q \u2297 \u2211 i\u2208J(e)q \u03b1 (e) i |wi\u3009 \u2297 |Ei\u3009 , (26)\nwhere \u2126q = {e \u2208 Am2kP : ei = 0 iff qi = 0}. As the final step of the experiment, tracing out the Q register brings Eq. (26). Let us consider one of the \u03c3(e)AE states. And in the using memory case, Alice performs a measurement using POVM Z \u2032 (15), on the remaining A portion to extract true randomness based on the hi-dimensional space (in the not using memory case, she measures the state using POVM Z \u2032\u2032 (16). For the using memory case, to compute this state \u03c3(t, q), we write a single quantum walker |wi\u3009 \u2208 HW as |wi\u3009 = \u2211 c\u03b1 |\u03d5(c\u03b1, i)\u3009\u2297 |c\u03b1\u3009, where |\u03d5(c\u03b1, i)\u3009 are walker\u2019s states in H2\u00b5P and |c\u03b1\u3009 is the active coin. For the not using memory case, |wi\u3009 \u2208 HW as |wi\u3009 = \u2211 c\u03ba |\u03d5(c\u03ba, i)\u3009 \u2297 |c\u03ba\u3009, where |c\u03ba\u3009 are all memory and active coins and |\u03d5(c\u03ba, i)\u3009 are walker\u2019s states in HP . With this notation, in the using memory case, we can compute a postmeasurement state, with Alice storing the outcome z \u2208 An2\u00b5P\nin a classical register Z and also tracing out the active coin register. The post-measurement state is as follows:\n\u03c3 (e) ZE = \u2211 z [z]Z \u2211\ni,j\u2208J(e)q\n\u03b1i\u03b1 \u2217 j \u2211 c\u03b1\u2208{0,1}n \u03b2z,c\u03b1,i\u03b2 \u2217 z,c\u03b1,i \u2297 [Eij ],\nwhere z \u2208 An2\u00b5P and \u03b2z,c\u03b1,i = \u220fn\u22121 `=0 \u2329 z` \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(c(`)\u03b1 , i`)\u232a. In the not using memory case, Alice saves the outcome z \u2208 AnP in a classical register Z after her measurements with the set Z \u2032\u2032 and tracing out the all memory and active coins register. Then the post-measurement state is as follows:\n\u03c3 (e) ZE = \u2211 z [z]Z \u2211\ni,j\u2208J(e)q\n\u03b1i\u03b1 \u2217 j \u2211 c\u03ba\u2208{0,1}\u03ban \u03b2z,c\u03ba,i\u03b2 \u2217 z,c\u03ba,i \u2297 [Eij ],\nwhere z \u2208 AnP and \u03b2z,c\u03ba,i = \u220fn\u22121 `=0 \u2329 z` \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03d5(c(`)\u03ba , i`)\u232a. In the using memory case, to compute the min-entropy of the postmeasurement state, we will consider the following density operator:\n\u03c7ZE = \u2211 z [z] \u2211 i |\u03b1i|2 \u2211 c\u03b1 |\u03b2z,c\u03b1,i|2 \u2297 [Ei].\nSimilarly, we will have the following density operator in the not using memory case:\n\u03c7ZE = \u2211 z [z] \u2211 i |\u03b1i|2 \u2211 c\u03ba |\u03b2z,c\u03ba,i|2 \u2297 [Ei].\nDue to the superposition lemma (12), in both cases, it bounds the min-entropy of a superposition based on the minentropy of both suitable mixed states, we find that:\nH\u221e(Z|E)\u03c3(e) \u2265 H\u221e(Z|E)\u03c7 \u2212 log2 |J (e)q |. (27)\nConsider the state \u03c7ZEI where we append an auxiliary system spanned by orthonormal basis |i\u3009 as follows:\n\u03c7ZEI = \u2211 i |\u03b1i|2 \u00b7 \u03c7(i) \u2297 [Ei]\u2297 [i], (28)\nwhere \u03c7(i) = \u2211 z[z] \u2211 c\u03b1 |\u03b2z,c\u03b1,i|2 in the using memory case\nand \u03c7(i) = \u2211 z[z] \u2211 c\u03ba |\u03b2z,c\u03ba,i|2 in the not using memory case. Particularly, in the using memory case, for strings z \u2208 An2\u00b5P and i \u2208 An2kP , let p(z|wi) be the probability that outcomes z is observed if measuring the pure, and unentangled state, state |wi1 , ..., win\u3009 using POVM Z \u2032. Simple algebra shows that this is in fact p(z|wi) = \u2211 c\u03b1 |\u03b2z,c\u03b1,i|2. So \u03c7(i) = \u2211 z p(z|wi)[z]. Similarly, in the not using memory case, for strings z \u2208 AnP and i \u2208 An2kP , let p(z|wi) be the probability that outcomes z is observed if measuring the pure, and unentangled state, state |wi1 , ..., win\u3009 using POVM Z \u2032\u2032. Again, simple algebra shows that is in fact p(z|wi) = \u2211 c\u03ba |\u03b2z,c\u03ba,i|2. So \u03c7(i) =\u2211\nz p(z|wi)[z]. From the strong subadditivity of the minentropy [55], in both cases, from Equation (1), and treating the joint EI registers as a single classical register, we have:\nH\u221e(Z|E)\u03c7 \u2265 H\u221e(Z|EI)\u03c7 \u2265 min i H\u221e(Z)\u03c7(i) . (29)\nFix a particular i \u2208 J (e)q and \u03b7 = n \u2212 wt(i) (namely, \u03b7 is the number of zeros in the string i.) Then, in the using\nmemory case, it is clear that p(z|wi) \u2264 maxx,c\u00b5 PW (|w0\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u00b5))\n\u03b7 = \u03be\u03b7 . Indeed, any other PW (|w0\u3009 \u2192 (x, c\u00b5)) \u2264 1. Similarly, in the not using memory case, it shows that p(z|wi) \u2264 maxx PW (|w0\u3009 \u2192 x)\u03b7 = \u03be\u03b7 , where PW (|w0\u3009 \u2192 x) \u2264 1. So in the both cases, we may consider only the |w0\u3009 term as contributing to this upper-bound. From this it follows that H\u221e(Z)\u03c7(i) = \u2212 log maxz p(z|wi) \u2265 \u2212 log \u03ben\u2212wt(i). From [67] and [48], by considering the noise in the source via the sampling, we have that for i \u2208 J (e)q and w(i) \u2264 n(w(q) + \u03b4), miniH\u221e(Z)\u03c7(i) \u2265 \u2212 log \u03ben(1\u2212w(q)\u03b4) \u2265 \u03b7q\u03b3\u2032, where \u03b7q = n(1 \u2212 (w(q) + \u03b4)), the gamma is \u03b3\u2032 (22) in the using memory case, and the gamma is \u03b3\u2032 (23) in the not using memory case. Finally, by the well known bound on the volume of a Hamming ball |J (e)q | \u2264 dnH\u0304d(w(q)+\u03b4), Eq. (12) in the superposition lemma, and the inequality (29), we have the bound of the min-entropy:\nH\u221e(Z|E)\u03c3(e) \u2265 \u03b7q\u03b3\u2032 \u2212 nH\u03042\u03baP (w(q) + \u03b4)\nlog2\u03baP (2) . (30)\nThe above analysis is for the ideal state. Since we use a similar technique that we employed in [67] and [48] for translating this ideal analysis to the real case, we refer the details to [67] and [48]."

The secure random bit rates are computed through the main theorems from [67], [48] and their modifications for the version of the HDQW state [33]. To compute the gamma \u03b3 in Eq. (19), we employ the maximum probability with the Hadamard operator. Note that for \u03ba = 1, which is the non-memory based quantum walk case, the case has the following maximum probabilities:\nG(1, 3) = 0.2224, G(1, 5) = 0.1474, G(1, 11) = 0.0983, G(1, 21) = 0.0642, and G(1, 51) = 0.0367 over T . For \u03ba > 1, the using all case with the maximum probability (3) and the maximum probability (8) are evaluated in table I and II, respectively. Note that in the table II, the function G(\u03ba, P, F ) is written as G(\u03ba, P ).\nThe random bit rates of the using all case with the Hadamard coin operator show in Fig.1 and Fig.2. They show interesting manners depending on the \u03ba-number of quantum recycled coins used.\n1) The odd number of coins improves random bit rates against noises: The using all case of the memory-based QWQRNG protocols utilize HD-QW states with the odd number of recycled coins (\u03ba = 1, 3) and the Hadamard coin operator achieves better random bit rates over all noises we tested, e.g., (w(q) = 0, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3). When we increase the number of recycled coins \u03ba to add increments, the random bit rates are improved. Particularly if the number of coins \u03ba = 3, the random bit rate over a low dimensional walker\u2019s space |W | = 23 \u00b7 3 shows more resilience as noises are increased than in other walker\u2019s spaces, shown in Fig.1. Note that since these simulation results are tested with a limited number of recycled coins, e.g., \u03ba = 1, 3, for a clear outcome, it needs to experiment with a higher number of recycled coins such as \u03ba = 5, 7, which is restricted as a walker\u2019s dimension is increased.\n2) The even number of coins enhances random bit rates of the low-dimensional walker\u2019s spaces against noises: The memory-based QW-QRNG protocols with HD-QW states of the even number of recycled coins (\u03ba = 2, 4) and the Hadamard coin operator show the random bit rates over low dimensional walker\u2019s spaces, e.g., |W | = 22\u00b73, |W | = 24\u00b73 are able to withstand to noises are increased than in high walker\u2019s spaces, shown in Fig.2. In other words, the random bit rate over a high dimensional walker\u2019s space, e.g., |W | = 22 \u00b7 51,\nis vulnerable as noises are increased. But as the number of recycled coins \u03ba to even increments, the noise sensitivity is improved while the random bit rate over lower dimensions still shows better resilience than higher ones, shown in Fig.2. Similarly, since these simulation results are tested with a limited number of recycled coins, e.g., \u03ba = 2, 4, for a better result, it needs to test with a higher number of recycled coins such as \u03ba = 6, 8, which is restrained as a walker\u2019s dimension is increased.\n3) The generalized and flip coin operators raise random bit rates: First, the memory-based QW-QRNG using the generalized and flip-coin operators (6) and (7) improves its overall random bit rates, as shown in Fig.3. Secondly, the noise sensitivity in random bit rates over the higher walker\u2019s\ndimensions is improved, particularly in the cases of the even number of recycled coins (\u03ba = 2), shown in Fig.3."

            "text": "In this paper, we newly devise various memory-based QWQRNG protocols by using an HD-QW state [33]. We explore the memory-based QW-QRNG protocols in multiple scenarios, including the using all case (using memory and active coins), the using memory coins, and the not using memory coins. We analyze these memory-based QW-QRNG protocols to be secure in the semi-source independent (SI) model. We simulate the protocols with different coin operators (Hadamard, generalized, and flip-coin operators) to optimize the randomness of the bit string. Throughout the simulations, we show exciting behaviors of the protocols depending on the size of the memory space and the number of quantum recycled coins. For example, in the protocol using the odd number of recycled coins to generate a random bit, the protocol can improve the random bit rate against overall noises. But when the protocol uses the even number of recycled coins, it enhances the random bit rate of the low-dimensional position space against general noises. This simulation result may connect to some open problems, particularly analyzing how the number of recycled coins affects the random bit rate of the memory-based QW-QRNG over noises. Also, developing and analyzing a protocol of QKD with the memory-based quantum walk state will\nbe another exciting problem. Moreover, devising a non-local game [70]\u2013[74] with an entangled state via quantum walks [35]\u2013[42] will be an exciting project so that we may exploit it to develop a device-independent QRNG/QKD protocol [80]\u2013 [87] without the measurement independent assumption in the non-local game [75]\u2013[79]."
