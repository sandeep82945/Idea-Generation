Regarding the dust continuum, we use a mass-weighted dust temperature, T mw , determined using new empirical relations between temperature and luminosity. We find the average L/ M mol gas mass conversion factors (including He) to be \u03b1850 = 6 . 9 \u00d7 10 12 W Hz \u22121 M \u22121 , \u03b1CO = 4.0 M ( \u03ba km s \u22121 pc 2 ) \u22121 , and \u03b1C I = 17.0 M ( \u03ba km s \u22121 pc 2 ) \u22121 , based on the assumption that the mean dust properties of the sample ( \u03baH = gas-to-dust ratio/dust emissivity) will be similar to those of local metal rich galaxies and the Milky Way. The tracer with the least intrinsic scatter is [C I ](1\u20130), while CO(1\u20130) has the highest. The conversion factors show a weak but significant correlation with L IR which is not apparent when T mw is held constant. Assuming dust properties typical of metal-rich galaxies, we infer a neutral carbon abundance X C I = [C 0 / H 2 ] = 1 . 6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , similar to that in the Milky W ay. W e find no evidence for bi-modality of \u03b1CO between main-sequence (MS) galaxies and those with extreme star-formation intensity, i.e. ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and SMGs. The means of the three conversion factors are found to be similar between MS galaxies and ULIRGs/SMGs, to within 10\u201320 per cent. The o v erarching conclusion of our work is that, for metal-rich galaxies, near -universal a verage values for \u03b1CO , X C I , and \u03baH are adequate for global molecular gas estimates within the expected uncertainties. The 1 \u03c3 scatter in our optimized values for \u03b1CO , X C I , and \u03baH are 0.14, 0.11, and 0.15 dex, respectively.",

Received 2022 July 25; in original form 2022 February 13\nA B S T R A C T We present a self-consistent cross-calibration of the three main molecular gas mass tracers in galaxies, namely the 12 CO(1\u20130), [C I ]( 3 P 1 \u20133 P 0 ) lines, and the submm dust continuum emission, using a sample of 407 galaxies, ranging from local discs to submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs) up to z \u2248 6. A Bayesian statistical method is used to produce galaxy-scale universal calibrations of these molecular gas indicators, that hold o v er 3\u20134 orders of magnitude in infrared luminosity, L IR . Regarding the dust continuum, we use a mass-weighted dust temperature, T mw , determined using new empirical relations between temperature and luminosity. We find the average L/ M mol gas mass conversion factors (including He) to be \u03b1850 = 6 . 9 \u00d7 10 12 W Hz \u22121 M \u22121 , \u03b1CO = 4.0 M ( \u03ba km s \u22121 pc 2 ) \u22121 , and \u03b1C I = 17.0 M ( \u03ba km s \u22121 pc 2 ) \u22121 , based on the assumption that the mean dust properties of the sample ( \u03baH = gas-to-dust ratio/dust emissivity) will be similar to those of local metal rich galaxies and the Milky Way. The tracer with the least intrinsic scatter is [C I ](1\u20130), while CO(1\u20130) has the highest. The conversion factors show a weak but significant correlation with L IR which is not apparent when T mw is held constant. Assuming dust properties typical of metal-rich galaxies, we infer a neutral carbon abundance X C I = [C 0 / H 2 ] = 1 . 6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , similar to that in the Milky W ay. W e find no evidence for bi-modality of \u03b1CO between main-sequence (MS) galaxies and those with extreme star-formation intensity, i.e. ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and SMGs. The means of the three conversion factors are found to be similar between MS galaxies and ULIRGs/SMGs, to within 10\u201320 per cent. The o v erarching conclusion of our work is that, for metal-rich galaxies, near -universal a verage values for \u03b1CO , X C I , and \u03baH are adequate for global molecular gas estimates within the expected uncertainties. The 1 \u03c3 scatter in our optimized values for \u03b1CO , X C I , and \u03baH are 0.14, 0.11, and 0.15 dex, respectively.\nKey words: ISM: dust, extinction \u2013 Galaxies: high redshift \u2013 Submillimetre: galaxies, ISM \u2013 Radio lines: galaxies, ISM.\n1\nT t h 2 g k t 2 o g \u2013 Y e e\nm S t\ng h i W s w H w\ng p s 1 p A 2 i 2 b i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nhe cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density has declined by more han an order of magnitude during the past \u22488 Gyr of cosmic istory (Lilly et al. 1996 ; Madau et al. 1996 ; Madau & Dickinson 014 ). The driver of star formation is the molecular gas supply in alaxies, and indeed the SFR\u2013stellar mass (SFR\u2013M ) relationship nown as the galaxy main sequence (MS) is purely a by-product of he relationship between SFR and molecular gas (e.g. Baker et al. 022 ), for unperturbed galaxies with significant gas reserves. A major bservational goal is to produce a combined census of the molecular as \u2013 the \u2018potential for future star formation\u2019 \u2013 and the stellar content the \u2018record of past star formation\u2019 \u2013 o v er this period (e.g. Keres, un & Young 2003 ; Dunne et al. 2003 , 2011 ; Zwaan et al. 2004 ; Zafar t al. 2013 ; Walter et al. 2014 ; Decarli et al. 2016 , 2019 ; Saintonge t al. 2017 ; Driver et al. 2018 ; Rhee et al. 2018 ; Riechers et al. 2019 ).\nThe molecular gas fraction of a galaxy is a crucial component in odels of galaxy formation (e.g. Obreschkow et al. 2009 ; Popping, omerville & Trager 2014 ; Lagos et al. 2015 ; Chen et al. 2018 ) and\nhus measurements of H 2 and stellar mass o v er large representativ e\nE-mail: haley.gomez@astro.cf.ac.uk m\nPub\nalaxy samples are key requirements for understanding how galaxies ave transformed from clouds of gas residing in dark matter haloes nto the regular agglomerations of stars we see in the local Universe.\nhile it is clear that CO(1\u20130)-luminous gas is the phase linked with tar formation (e.g. Wong & Blitz 2002 ), observations of molecules ith higher critical densities (e.g. HCN) revealed that it is the dense 2 gas phase ( n > 10 4 cm \u22123 ) that correlates most tightly and linearly ith tracers of star formation (Gao & Solomon 2004 ). Atomic hydrogen (H I ), on the other hand, constitutes a longer term as reservoir for star formation, where under certain conditions of ressure, far-UV radiation field, density and metallicity, a phase tranition H I \u2192 H 2 takes place, catalysed by dust grains (e.g. Elmegreen 993 ; Papadopoulos, Thi & Viti 2002 ; Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006 ): a icture supported by numerous observations (e.g. Honma, Sofue & rimoto 1995 ; Leroy et al. 2008 ; Bigiel et al. 2008 ; Schruba et al. 011 ). This transition occurs in the inner H I distribution of galaxies, n the cold neutral medium (CNM: n \u223c 50\u2013100 cm \u22123 , T kin \u223c 100\u2013 00 K ), meanwhile pure H I gas often extends many optical radii eyond the luminous stellar disc (e.g. P \u0301eroux & Howk 2020 ), where t can be found concomitant with cold dust (e.g. Thomas et al. 2002 ).\nUnlike H I and its hyperfine line emission at 21 cm, the H 2 olecule in its S(0): J = 2 \u2212 0 transition at 28 \u03bcm (the least\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s) lished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 963\ne t\nr \u223c o\na t m u \u223c\nm v m 1 c p a c o d l W\nC\nt 1\na r c e a\nb g h V e w i d o t 2 e\ng h C 0\n1\nB e w 2\nr\nw f e l l ( r Z\n1\ng H s t a p v c\n( e e w s m s e C S i e\na r 1 a F S r i M a W u f\nt b t 2 2\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nxcitation-demanding H 2 line) is essentially invisible at temperatures ypical of giant molecular clouds (10\u201320 K ). This is because its E/k B \u223c 510 k, limits its excitation and detection only to shocked egions of molecular clouds, where gas temperatures can rise past 1000 K , for small ( \u223c1\u20132 per cent) gas mass fractions. Even then, to bserve this H 2 line at 28 \u03bcm requires space-borne telescopes. For these reasons, the rotational transitions of CO (the next most bundant molecule with [CO / H 2 ] \u223c 10 \u22124 ) are commonly used to race H 2 gas, with the lowest transition ( 12 CO J = 1\u20130) being the\nost established tracer. Its E 10 / k B \u223c 5.5 K ensures a well-populated pper le vel e ven in the coldest gas, while its low critical density, n cr\n400 cm \u22123 , ensures its excitation even at low densities. 1\nThe CO(1\u20130) line has significant optical depths in the typically acro-turbulent H 2 gas, though these arise locally within the\nelocity-coherent gas cells allowing the CO emission to trace gas ass throughout molecular clouds (e.g. Dickman, Snell & Schloerb 986 ). The conversion factor, \u03b1CO , in the relation M H2 = \u03b1CO L \u2032 CO annot be determined using standard optically thin line formation hysics due to the high line optical depths. This created the need for \u03b1CO calibration as soon as the ubiquity of CO line emission in H 2 louds was established. Observational and theoretical investigation f \u03b1CO suggests it is sensitive to metallicity, molecular gas surface ensity, and kinematic state in galaxies (e.g. Pelupessy & Papadopouos 2009 ; Narayanan et al. 2011 ; Papadopoulos et al. 2012a ; Bolatto,\nolfire & Leroy 2013 ). Three distinct problems are now recognized regarding the use of O as a global tracer of H 2 mass in galaxies:\n(i) The \u03b1CO factor is sensitive \u2013 in a highly non-linear fashion \u2013 to he ISM metallicity and ambient far-UV radiation fields (e.g. Israel 997 ; Pak et al. 1998 ; Bolatto et al. 2013 ). (ii) Non-self-gravitating molecular clouds \u2013 and/or very different verage ISM states in terms of average temperature and gas density ange from those found in spiral galaxies where \u03b1CO was first alibrated \u2013 can yield systematically different \u03b1CO factors. For xample, \u03b1CO \u223c 1/5 \u2212 1/4 \u00d7 Galactic was initially reported for sample of four ULIRGs by Downes & Solomon ( 1998 ).\n(iii) Ele v ated cosmic ray (CR) energy densities can destroy CO elow a certain gas density threshold, leaving behind more C-rich as. This density threshold depends on the CR energy density in a ighly non-linear fashion, as e xplored by Bisbas, P apadopoulos & iti ( 2015 ), who found that regions of CO suppression may occur ven in moderately enhanced CR conditions if the gas density is low, hile the very high CR energy densities expected in ultraluminous nfrared galaxies (ULIRGs) may be partly compensated by higher gas ensities in such starbursts. Modelling [C I /CO] ratios as a function f CR, turbulence, gas density, and metallicity is an active area of heoretical research (e.g. Bisbas et al. 2015 , 2017 ; Glo v er & Clark 016 ; Clark et al. 2019a ; Papadopoulos, Bisbas & Zhang 2018 ; Gong t al. 2020 ; Bisbas, Tan & Tanaka 2021 ).\nIn the distant Universe, additional problems arise. High-redshift alaxies are often observed solely in high- J CO lines ( J = 3\u20132 and igher), due to the observational challenge of observing the two low- J O lines. 2 Using the high- J lines means that global CO( J + 1, J )/(1\u2013 ) ratios must be assumed before an \u03b1CO factor can be used; given the\nBecause the CO(1\u20130) line is typically optically thick, with \u03c4 10 \u223c 5\u201310 (e.g. ryant & Scoville 1996 ; Papadopoulos et al. 2012a : their equation 11 ), the ffective critical density is lower still: n cr ( \u03b210 ) = \u03b210 n crit \u223c 40\u201380 cm \u22123 , here \u03b210 = (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03c410 ) /\u03c410 is the line escape probability. Prior to the commissioning of its bands 1 and 2, low- J lines from highedshift galaxies are inaccessible to the Atacama Large Millimetre Array\n( C c h 3\nr C i\nide range of CO spectral-line energy distributions (SLEDs) found or LIRGs for J = 3\u20132 and higher (Papadopoulos et al. 2012b ; Greve t al. 2014 ; Kamenetzky et al. 2016 ), these assumptions come with arge uncertainties. Finally, at the highest redshifts ( 4), low- J CO ines (and dust emission) can be severely suppressed for cold gas and dust) reservoirs due to their low contrast against the ambient, est-frame cosmic microwave background (da Cunha et al. 2013 ; hang et al. 2016 ). In principle, radiative transfer models of well-sampled CO (and 3 CO) SLEDs can yield \u03b1CO values appropriate for a particular alaxy (or even galaxy class) (e.g. Papadopoulos et al. 2012b , 2014 ; arrington et al. 2021 ). Nevertheless, the size of the CO line data ets per galaxy required to do this make it impractical (in terms of elescope time) to obtain M (H 2 ) for large galaxy samples. Amassing large sample typically means only one or two lines can be gathered er galaxy, and thus a calibration of \u03b1CO and its uncertainties remains ery valuable. The only practical way to achieve this is to crossalibrate against the other galaxy-scale H 2 mass tracers.\nLarge-area far-infrared (FIR) and submillimetre (submm) surv e ys e.g. Armus et al. 2009 ; Eales et al. 2010 ; Vieira et al. 2010 ; Kennicutt t al. 2011 ; Oliver et al. 2012 ; Hodge et al. 2013 ) ushered in a new ra in which submm continuum emission from dust has been used idely as an alternative tracer of M H2 , although it has been clear that ubmm-derived dust masses ( \u221d L 850 ) and CO-derived molecular gas asses ( \u221d L \u2032 CO ) are tightly correlated ever since the first statistical ubmm surv e y of 100 local FIR-bright galaxies (SLUGS; Dunne t al. 2000 ). The first suggestions to use dust as an alternative to O at high redshift (e.g. Santini et al. 2010 ; Magdis et al. 2012 ; coville et al. 2014 ) were followed quickly by work demonstrating ts potential (e.g Scoville et al. 2016 ; Hughes et al. 2017 ; Orellana t al. 2017 ).\nAn advantage of using submm continuum emission from dust s an H 2 gas tracer is that it becomes easier to measure at high edshift, because of the ne gativ e K -correction (e.g. Blain & Longair 993 ), while recent technological advances made it possible to image reas large enough to be free of cosmic variance, leading to the IR/submm detection of many thousands of galaxies by the Herschel pace Observatory , for example. The use of dust as a gas mass proxy equires an estimate of metallicity, since the dust-to-gas ratio, \u03b4GDR , s roughly proportional to metallicity (e.g. Mu \u0303 noz-Mateos et al. 2009 ;\nagdis et al. 2012 ; Sandstrom et al. 2013 ; Draine et al. 2014 ). The ppropriate \u03b4GDR can then be applied (e.g. Valentino et al. 2018 ).\nhilst this requirement is often raised as a problem regarding the se of dust as a gas mass tracer, its dependence on metallicity is in act weak er than that of CO. 3\nFor galaxies selected at FIR/submm/mm wavelengths, it is safe o assume that the metallicity will be high, such that \u03b4GDR will e broadly similar to those found for local metal-rich spirals and he Milky Way (Dunne & Eales 2001 ; Draine 2009 ; Magdis et al. 012 ; Sandstrom et al. 2013 ; Rowlands et al. 2014 ; Yang et al. 017 ; Berta et al. 2021 ).

Moreo v er, since H 2 cannot be traced (in bulk) by any of its own lines, egardless of which other tracer (X) is used (dust emission, CO, or 13 CO, or I line emission), it will al w ays be necessary to assume a [X / H 2 ] abundance n order to proceed to a final H 2 gas mass estimate.\n964 L.

( 2015 ) and Scoville et al. ( 2017 ). 4\nA third method of tracing molecular gas \u2013 the use of atomic carbon ines \u2013 has come to the fore since ALMA became operational. Its romise was recognized by Papadopoulos, Thi & Viti ( 2004 ) and ts first application as a tracer for molecular gas mass in galaxies ave good results (Wei\u00df et al. 2003 ; Papadopoulos & Greve 2004 ), mplying that: (a) the [C I ]( 3 P 1 \u20133 P 0 ) lines are optically thin for the ulk of H 2 gas (P \u0301erez-Beaupuits et al. 2015 ) and (b) atomic carbon s present throughout CO-rich molecular cloud volumes.\nThe latter contradicts the earlier simple plane-parallel PDR model here atomic carbon (and its line emission) occupied only a thin ayer, sandwiched between C + in the outer and CO in the inner egions of FUV-illuminated molecular clouds (Tielens & Hollenbach 985 ). Ho we ver, observ ations have repeatedly shown excellent oncomitance of C I line emission with CO line emission, by area nd by velocity, and C I shows a tighter correlation with 13 CO than ith 12 CO. C I is now thought to arise from same volume as the CO, ith similar excitation conditions (e.g. Plume et al. 1999 ; Ikeda et al. 002 ; Schneider et al. 2003 ; Beuther et al. 2014 ; P \u0301erez-Beaupuits t al. 2015 ). Moreo v er, it may be that C I lines can also trace COark molecular gas, should such phase exist in galaxies in significant mounts, e.g. due to CR-induced dissociation of CO to C (and O) Bisbas et al. 2015 ).\nDespite being much fainter than the C + line at 158 \u03bcm (the prime SM cooling line), atomic carbon lines do hold certain advantages, amely: (a) they solely trace H 2 gas, whereas the C + line also races the H I and H II gas reservoirs, which can be significant, specially in metal-poor systems (e.g. Madden et al. 1997 ; Liszt 011 ; Papadopoulos & Geach 2012 ; P \u0301erez-Beaupuits et al. 2015 ; lark et al. 2019a ); (b) the C I lines can remain excited for cold as (e.g. for [C I ](1\u20130): E 10 / k B \u223c 24 K ) unlike the C + line, where he E / k B \u223c 92 K will keep it very faint for cold gas; (c) the requencies of the two C I lines, at 492 and 809 GHz, remain ccessible for galaxies o v er a much larger redshift range (and thus osmic volume) than the C + line. In the latter case, its rest-frame requency, \u03bd(C + ) \u223c 1 . 9 THz, means the C + line is observable by LMA\u2019s most sensitive receivers only at z 4. Nevertheless, the high rest-frame frequencies of the C I line made arly observations (and thus any calibration efforts) in the local niv erse v ery dif ficult. Initially there had been relati vely little obserational work outside of the Milky Way, largely confined to extreme ystems such as quasars and starburst nuclei (e.g. White et al. 1994 ; ei\u00df et al. 2005 ; Walter et al. 2011 ). These studies advocated a higher arbon abundance for these extreme systems, X C I = [C 0 / H 2 ] = 5\u2013 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , compared to the X C I = 1\u20132.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 seen in the Milky ay (Frerking et al. 1989 ). More recently, Herschel observed many local galaxies in C I , lthough the [C I ](1\u20130) line was at the edge of the observable range or the Hersc hel F ourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), such that he sensitivity was somewhat compromised. As a result, most of the etected galaxies were either ULIRGs, starbursts, or low-metallicity warfs (Kamenetzky et al. 2014 ; Rosenberg et al. 2015 ; Lu et al. 017 ; Jiao et al. 2017 ). A small sample of normal disc galaxies was apped in C I (Jiao et al. 2019 , hereafter J19 ; see also Crocker et al. 019 ). J19 studied the spatial distribution of L \u2032 C I and L \u2032 CO at a \u223c1-kpc cale in 15 local galaxies. They concluded that C I is a good tracer f molecular gas, in the sense that it correlates well with CO and the\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nContinuum dust emission does not yield information on kinematics, unlike pectral lines.\nL m m t\natio L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO is distributed smoothly across galaxies. Comparing gainst CO(1\u20130) maps and the independent estimates of \u03b1CO from andstrom et al. ( 2013 ), these resolved studies suggested X C I = 1.3\u2013 .5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , similar to the range in the Galaxy, and that found by the bsorber study of Heintz & Watson ( 2020 ).\nWith ALMA now in routine operations, studies of C I have xpanded to a broader range of galaxies, with a greater variety f average ISM conditions, over a wider range of redshift. These nclude SMGs, which lie mainly at z > 1 (e.g. Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 013 ; Bothwell et al. 2017 ; Popping et al. 2017 ; Oteo et al. 2018 ; esvadba et al. 2019 ; Dannerbauer et al. 2019 ; G \u0301omez-Guijarro t al. 2019 ), and MS galaxies at z = 0.35\u20131.2 (Valentino et al. 018 , 2020 ; Bourne et al. 2019 ; Dunne et al. 2021 ). C I has even een detected in the intracluster medium of the Spiderweb galaxy luster at z = 2.16, as well as in several of its individual galaxies Emonts et al. 2018 ). Routine use of C I as a tracer of molecular as is currently limited by the lack of calibration studies to explore nd determine the values and behaviour of the parameters involved, .e. X C I and \u03b1C I . X C I = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 has been adopted by almost all ecent studies, taken from Wei\u00df et al. ( 2003 ), determined from a omparison of analyses of CO and C I in the centre of M 82, which as unusually high [C 0 / CO] \u223c 0 . 5, whereas attempts to estimate X C I n other ways \u2013 e.g. from absorption studies of Gamma-ray bursts nd quasar absorbers (Heintz & Watson 2020 ) \u2013 have found lower alues, consistent with the range seen in the Milky Way.\nThis paper presents the first dedicated cross-calibration study of he dust, 12 CO(1\u20130) and [C I ]( 3 P 1 \u20133 P 0 ) emission in a sample of 07 galaxies from the literature, including MS galaxies and SMGs, uch that we can compare their properties and tracer-(H 2 mass) onversion factors. We include the 250- \u03bcm-selected galaxies at z = .35 observed with ALMA in all three tracers by Dunne et al. ( 2021 ) here our method was first briefly presented. In Section 2 , we describe the samples used in this analysis, the bservables, and the derived quantities. In Section 3 , we describe he Bayesian approach for producing optimized, self-consistent racer-(H 2 -mass) conversion parameters between multiple tracers imultaneously.

In order to test for the effect of SF intensity or \u2018SF-mode\u2019 on\nny later results, we divide the sample into two groups, referred to ereafter as \u2018MS galaxies\u2019 and \u2018SMGs\u2019, the names of the groups re not meant to be accurate definitions but rather a reference to amiliar cate gories. F or this heterogeneous data-set, defining a simple riterion for two groups is not possible, and even if it were, a fuzzy oundary would still remain due to measurement errors and the nability to capture the complexity in a single parameter. The extreme tarburst \u2018SMG\u2019 group contains the high-redshift submillimeter elected galaxies which were disco v ered in the pre-ALMA era and s such are extreme star forming systems (else they could not have een detected), plus the local ULIRGs and some LIRGs which have vidence for very intense and obscured regions (e.g. NGC 4418, C 860) where conditions are likely to be extreme (D \u0301\u0131az-Santos et al. 017 ; Falstad et al. 2021 ). The \u2018MS galaxy\u2019 group contains the ower luminosity local disc galaxies plus the LIRGS which are not xtreme, the intermediate redshift sources selected at 250 \u03bcm from he Herschel -ATLAS \u2013 z = 0.35 galaxies from Dunne et al.

(Full eferences are provided in Table 1 .)\nThere are two situations where corrections to luminosities may be equired, they are discussed below.\nAlthough lensed galaxies were included in their work, the luminosities were ot de-magnified.\na t\nM\n.1.1 H I -dominated galaxies at low L IR .\nor galaxies with a large fraction of H I within their optical disc, heir dust tracing H I rather than H 2 makes a significant contribution o the submm continuum emission. Since our intention is to provide a alibration for H 2 rather than total gas, we apply a correction to L 850 or galaxies with f H I = H I / H 2 > 1, as described in Appendix B1 . alaxies corrected in this way are shown as cyan diamonds in the lots.\n.1.2 Local galaxies mapped in C I by the Herschel FTS.\nhe local galaxies mapped using the Herschel FTS by J19 present ome complex issues. Some do not have C I and dust continuum easurements in matched apertures, and those same galaxies are ften only detected in C I in the inner few kpc of the galaxy, where the atios of L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO may also be biased \u2013 for example, by a lower \u03b1CO in alaxy centres. We discuss the issues in more detail in Section 4.4 and ppendix B2 . Galaxies requiring a significant correction ( > 0.1 dex) o L \u2032 C I are labelled as C I cor ; they are shown in the plots as pink iamonds, but not included in the analysis unless specified.\n.2 Obser v ables\ne will compare three tracers of molecular gas, where the observbles (the luminosities L 850 , L \u2032 CO , and L \u2032 C I ) are empirically related to he molecular gas mass as\nmol = L 850 / \u03b1850 = \u03b1CO L \u2032 CO = \u03b1C I L \u2032 C I .

For CO and C I , we use L \u2032 as efined by Solomon & Vanden Bout ( 2005 )\n\u2032 = 3 . 25 \u00d7 10 7\n\u03bd2 rest\n( D 2 L 1 + z )[ \u222b V Sd v Jy km s \u22121 ] K km s \u22121 pc 2 , (2)\nhere \u222b\nV S d v is the v elocity-inte grated line flux density, D L is the uminosity distance (Mpc), and \u03bdrest is the rest frequency 6 of the ransition in GHz.\nMost of the galaxies in our compilation have been observed in he 12 CO( J = 1\u20130) transition. Ho we ver, some observ ations at high edshift target the 12 CO( J = 2\u20131) line. We convert L \u2032 21 to L \u2032 10 using he line luminosity ratio R 21 = 0.8; if instead we were to set R 21 to nity, this would not affect any of our conclusions. We do not use \u2265 3 CO lines because the uncertainties in the global excitation orrections become too large for a useful calibration study.\nWe use only the C I 3 P 1 \u20133 P 0 line, as it is the least sensitive to the v erage e xcitation conditions, and correlates better with the low- J O emission (Jiao et al. 2017 , 2019 ; Crocker et al. 2019 ). Moreo v er, here is now evidence of strongly sub-thermal excitation for C I (2\u2013 ) (Harrington et al. 2021 ; Papadopoulos, Dunne & Maddox 2022 ), aking it difficult to use this line as an H 2 mass tracer since its xcitation is extremely uncertain. For the dust continuum emission, we use L 850 , the luminosity at est-frame 850 \u03bcm\n850 = 4 \u03c0S \u03bd(obs) \u00d7 K ( D 2 L 1 + z ) W Hz \u22121 , (3)\nhere D L is the luminosity distance, S \u03bd(obs) is the observed flux ensity and K is the K -correction to rest-frame 850 \u03bcm, defined as\n= ( 353 GHz\n\u03bdrest )3 + \u03b2 ( e h \u03bdrest / k T d \u2212 1 e 16 . 956 / T d \u2212 1 ) .

Sco16 assumed a T d = 25 K and \u03b2 = 1.8, respectively, to xtrapolate (or K correct) their observed submm luminosities to est-frame 850 \u03bcm. We make full use of the available data to efine this procedure as follows: (1) With sufficient data, we fit he SED ourselves with \u03b2 = 1.8 and estimate the rest-frame 850- m luminosity directly from the SED fit. (2) Failing that, we use he reported T d in the literature to make the extrapolation from he longest wavelength measurement available. (3) For SMGs with nsufficient data points to have had their SED fitted, we adopt their bserv ed av erage, T d = 38 K (da Cunha et al. 2015 ). The bulk of the igh- z samples now have observations between 2 and 3 mm with LMA, as such the extrapolation to rest-frame 850 \u03bcm is small, ven at the highest redshifts. The shortest rest-frame wavelengths e deal with are \u03bbr \u223c 250 \u03bcm for sources at z \u223c 2 \u22123 observed at 50 \u03bcm, which require K -corrections in the range 50\u2013140. Ho we ver, he important consideration is the potential uncertainty in that K - orrection, not its absolute value. We tried alternatively using the co16 method of assuming T d = 25 K to extrapolate to rest-frame\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nWhere we use \u03bdrest , Solomon & Vanden Bout ( 2005 ) use \u03bdobs , hence the ifferent exponent for (1 + z) cf. their equation (3).\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 967\nFigure 2.

The black line is for all galaxies with log L \u2032 CO < 8 . 9, including the lo-VALES galaxies suspected of having f H I > 1.

Middle column : L 850 / L \u2032 C I \u2013 there are no indications of bias due to lensing or redshift.

The third panel shows once more the difference between the C I cor and other galaxies in both high and low luminosity bins. Even though the C I and CO are measured in the same apertures, the C I cor galaxies have much lower L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO .

The true uncertainty due to the SED sampling and -correction will be smaller than this, as we know from our work n Section 2.3.1 and Fig. 4 that the dust temperatures in SMG are uch higher than 25 K . We, thus, do not consider the extrapolation\no rest-frame 850 \u03bcm to be a significant source of uncertainty or bias n this analysis.\n.3 Physical dependencies of gas mass tracers\n.3.1 Dust\u2013H 2 calibration\narge dust grains ( a \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm) in thermal equilibrium with their ncident radiation field emit as a modified blackbody (MBB), where he emission is related to the mass of hydrogen as:\nH2 = L \u03bd 4 \u03c0B( \u03bd, T mw ) \u03baH ( \u03bd) . (5)\nhe two physical quantities needed to calibrate dust continuum mission as a tracer of gas are therefore T mw and \u03baH . Expressing quation ( 5 ) in astronomical units for \u03bb = 850 \u03bcm, we can write M H2\n[ M ] = 6 . 14 \u00d7 10 \u221214 \u03baH [ kg m \u22122 ] L 850 [ W Hz \u22121 ]\n( 24 . 5\nT mw\n)\u22121 . 4 , (6)\nhere we have simplified the exponential term in the Planck function s \u223c (24 . 5 / T mw ) 1 . 4 for 17 < T mw < 30 K .\nThe mass-weighted dust temperature, T mw , is often lower than he luminosity-weighted dust temperature, T d , as derived from an sothermal MBB fit to the dust SED, because warm dust outshines old dust per unit mass. There is an excellent discussion of this in the ppendix to Sco16 which we will not repeat here (see also Dunne & ales 2001 ). To determine T mw , we require a multicomponent MBB fit to a wellampled dust SED (e.g. Dunne & Eales 2001 ), or an SED fit using model that allows a range of radiation field strengths, leading to a ange of dust temperatures (e.g. Draine et al. 2007 ). These methods\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n968 L. Dunne et al.\nM\nFigure 3. Relationships between the observed luminosities.

Cyan diamonds indicate those local galaxies which have f H I > 1 and have corrected values of L 850 . The best fit is shown, including the H I -corrected set, but excluding the lo-VALES galaxies (peach circles with log L \u2032 CO < 8.9; see Appendix B1 ). Choosing only galaxies with f H I < 1 does not change the results; the fit is consistent with a linear slope with a high degree of confidence. Top right-hand panel : L 850 \u2013L \u2032 C I . The resolved C I cor galaxies from J19 that have an aperture correction (Appendix A ) applied to L \u2032 C I in order to compare to L 850 are shown as pink diamonds. The dotted blue line shows the fit when these galaxies are included. The solid blue line is the fit that excludes these galaxies, while the dashed blue line is the fit to the log L IR > 11 galaxies only. Bottom left-hand panel : L \u2032 C I \u2013L \u2032 CO . The pink diamonds are the C I cor galaxies, where now the C I and CO are from matched regions, ho we ver, they are still offset to lower L \u2032 C I for a given L \u2032 CO . The fit including the pink diamonds is steeper than linear, while excluding them (solid line) returns a linear slope. Bottom right-hand panel : \u03c3 \u2032 850 \u2013L \u2032 C I . We compare the 850- \u03bcm emissivity ( \u03c3 \u2032 850 = M dust \u00d7 \u03ba850 ) to L \u2032 C I . This allows us to show dust data in the resolved galaxies from Jiao et al. ( 2021 ) (pink stars) measured in the same region as [C I ](1\u20130). The dotted blue line shows the fit including the pink stars, the solid line shows the fit excluding the C I cor galaxies and the dashed line shows the fit to log L IR > 11 galaxies only. The local resolved (C I cor ) galaxies from J19 /J21 appear to have less C I emission for a given dust or CO luminosity, an effect which persists even when comparing matched regions (bottom row).\ng l H H 2 2\nt c d [ o a c\nc 2 p o L h 3 ( S e\n7\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nive broadly consistent results. As a rule of thumb, the range of T mw in ocal star-forming galaxies is 15\u201325 K (Dunne & Eales 2001 ;Dale & elou 2002 ; Draine et al. 2007 ; da Cunha, Charlot & Elbaz 2008 ; unt et al. 2015 ; Bendo et al. 2015 ; Clark et al. 2015 ), increasing to 5\u201330 K in luminous starbursts at higher redshifts (Rowlands et al. 014 ; da Cunha et al. 2015 ). As the dust ( \u03b1850 ) factor is only weakly dependent on the assumed emperature at rest-frame 850 \u03bcm, Sco16 and others assumed a onstant T mw = 25 K . If instead the true T mw were to be 15 [30] K , the ust and gas mass would be under[o v er]estimated by a factor \u223c2 \u00d7 1.3 \u00d7], which is o v ershadowed by the other uncertainties. On the ther hand, failure to account for any systematic trend of T mw with nother physical parameter can introduce or mask correlations of the onversion factors with that physical parameter.\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nWe therefore explore the validity of assuming constant T mw by ollating measurements of T mw from the literature (Dunne & Eales 001 ; Hunt et al. 2019 ), and additionally making our own fits where ossible. In Fig. 1 , we show that there are indeed strong correlations f T mw with the observables, namely z, L IR and the SED colour, IR / L 850 . There is a clear difference between samples with low and igh SFRs, with \u3008 T mw (MS) \u3009 = 23 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 4 K while \u3008 T mw (SMG) \u3009 = 0 . 1 \u00b1 0 . 7 K . We fit empirical relations for the correlations in Fig. 1 see Table 4 ). Where there is no direct estimate of T mw from an ED fit, which is the case for two-thirds of galaxies, we use these mpirical relations 7 to derive T mw for use in our subsequent analysis.\nWe restrict the predicted T mw such that T mw \u2264 T d .\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 969\nTable 2.

In their work on strongly lensed SMGs at high redshift, which ncludes dust continuum emission as a constraint in a large-velocity radient (LVG) model, Harrington et al. ( 2021 ) find that T d \u223c T mw or most SMGs, with both measures of temperature higher than the mw = 25 K commonly used in the literature. To ensure consistency ith our other estimates of T d , we fitted the Harrington et al. ( 2021 )\nhotometry with three simple models: (1) an isothermal optically hin MBB; (2) an MBB with variable optical depth and \u2013 where there ere enough data \u2013 (3) a two-component MBB. In agreement with arrington et al., we find that a single dust temperature adequately escribes the SED of these galaxies, in contrast to lower redshift U)LIRGs and normal galaxies which are better fit with multiple ust components ( T d > T mw ) and/or fits with higher FIR optical epths. The temperatures from the Harrington et al. turbulence odel correlate best with our isothermal T d measurements for these alaxies, and the temperatures returned when allowing variable ptical depth, T d ( \u03c4 ), are al w ays significantly higher than those from he Harrington et al. model. We therefore do not use optically thick ts to yield T mw for our high-redshift SMGs. We instead use twoomponent SED fits to the lensed Planck sources and the handful of MGs with sufficient data for the empirical relations shown in Fig. 5 . The other key physical parameter in the dust\u2013H 2 conversion is \u03baH ,\nhich is a combination of the dust mass absorption coefficient ( \u03ba850 ) nd \u03b4GDR , such that 8 \u03baH = \u03b4GDR / \u03ba850 . Briefly, \u03ba850 is sensitive to the rain composition and structure (amorphous; crystalline; coagulated; antled), while \u03b4GDR is roughly proportional to metallicity and, for alaxies with metallicity within a factor 2 of Z , as expected for hose in our samples, can be taken to be roughly constant, at \u03b4GDR = 00\u2013150 (Sodroski et al. 1997 ; Dunne et al. 2000 ; Dunne & Eales 001 ; Draine et al. 2007 ; Mu \u0303 noz-Mateos et al. 2009 ; Leroy et al. 011 ; Planck Collaboration 2011 ; Sandstrom et al. 2013 ; Jones et al. 017 ; De Vis et al. 2021 ).

(8)\nhe excitation term, Q 10 , describes the relative fraction of carbon toms in the J = 1 state. Under general non-LTE conditions, it is a unction of both gas density, n , and T k and is derived analytically in he Appendix to Papadopoulos et al. ( 2004 ). A recent study of the C I ](2\u20131)/(1\u20130) line ratio (Papadopoulos et al. 2022 ) finds that the I lines are both sub-thermally excited in the ISM of galaxies, with he [C I ](2\u20131) especially so (see also Harrington et al. 2021 ). Thus, he LTE expressions for Q 10 should not be used, nor will the C I line atio produce an estimate of T k (both methods having been widely sed in the literature to date). Details for Q 10 are in the Appendix D , ut in summary we find the following:\n(i) The [C I ](1\u20130) excitation term, Q 10 , is a non-trivial function of ensity and temperature, but for the range T k \u2265 20 K and log n \u2265 2.5 which is where the bulk of H 2 in star forming galaxies is thought to eside \u2013 \u3008 Q 10 \u3009 = 0.48 \u00b1 0.08 where the 99-per cent confidence range s quoted (see Papadopoulos et al. 2022 and Fig. D1 for details).\n(ii) Due to a slight superthermal behaviour, higher density, higher k conditions can produce similar or even lower Q 10 than lower ensity, lower T k conditions. This breaks any intuitive link between 10 and the ISM conditions, i.e. we do not necessarily expect a higher 10 in SMGs compared to MS galaxies (see Fig. D1 ). (iii) As the [C I ](2\u20131) line is even more strongly sub-thermally xcited, its Q 21 = N 2 / N tot factor varies strongly. 9 This is the main eason why our current study is restricted to the [C I ](1\u20130) line.\nAs the [C I ]( 3 P 1 \u20133 P 0 ) line is optically thin for most conditions xpected in spiral discs (Wei\u00df et al. 2005 ; P \u0301erez-Beaupuits et al. 015 ; Harrington et al. 2021 ), the relationship between L \u2032 C I and M H2 s proportional to X C I \u2013 the abundance of carbon atoms relative to H 2 . his dependence on abundance is as expected for any method that mploys tracers of H 2 gas mass other than the H 2 lines themselves. 10\nWith the excitation factor Q 10 varying no more than 16 per cent v er the typical range of H 2 conditions in galaxies ( T k \u2265 20 K, log \u2265 2.5), the major source of uncertainty in C I -based molecular as mass estimates (and thus the major source of scatter in the C I conversion factor) is the neutral carbon abundance, X C I . The elatively recent introduction of the [C I ](1\u20130) line as a gas tracer\nThe Q 21 ( n , T k ) that enters the estimates of molecular gas mass when the C I ](2\u20131) line is used can vary almost by a factor of \u223c5, depending on ( n , k ). 0 Even for optically thick tracers of H 2 gas, such as CO(1\u20130) line emission, [CO / H 2 ] abundance still enters the method via the CO\u2013H 2 cloud volumelling factor, f CO , albeit not in a sensitive fashion unless a combination of trong FUV radiation and/or low metallicities selectively dissociate CO in he outer cloud layers while leaving the largely self-shielding H 2 intact (then CO can be 1, see Pak et al. 1998 for details).\nL \u03b1 ( i \u03b1\n1\nh 1\neans that X C I has not been widely explored \u2013 constraining it and nv estigating an y potential trends is a ke y outcome of our crossalibration work.\nIn the Milky Way, X C I is found to vary only modestly, from .8\u20132.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (e.g. Zmuidzinas et al. 1988 ; Frerking et al. 1989 ; auber et al. 1995 ; Ikeda et al. 2002 ), while a much higher value X C I = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) has been inferred for the nearby starburst nucleus f M 82 (Schilke et al. 1993 ; White et al. 1994 ; Stutzki et al. 1997 ). 11\nhanks to ALMA, very high localized ratios of L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO (translating\no high X C I = 5\u20137 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) have also been measured in extreme egions, such as the Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND) of NGC 7469 hich is believed to host an X-ray Dominated Region (XDR; Izumi t al. 2020 ) and the outflow region in NGC 6240 (Cicone et al. 2018 ). ore modestly ele v ated L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO ratios tend to be found in the central uclear regions of starburst galaxies (J19; Salak et al. 2019 ; Saito t al. 2020 ). Ho we v er, when av eraged o v er larger kpc scale re gions \u2013 he ratios become consistent with the average global ratios measured or this sample (see Fig. 5 ). Independent measurements of X C I = . 6 + 1 . 3 \u22120 . 7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (for solar metallicity) were made by Heintz & Watson 2020 ) using UV absorption measures for a range of absorber systems cross cosmic time. CRs (and X-rays) are expected to dissociate O in fa v our of atomic carbon, increasing [C 0 /CO], a hypothesis upported by both simulations and observations (e.g. Bisbas et al. 015 ; Clark et al. 2019a ; Israel 2020 ; Izumi et al. 2020 ).\n.3.3 CO\u2013H 2 calibration\nhe 12 CO(1\u20130) line is optically thick in most (but not all, see e.g. alto et al. 1995 ) ISM conditions expected in galaxies. Unlike ust continuum emission where optical depths build up o v er large olumns of dust, the entire CO line optical depth builds up within ery small gas \u2018cells\u2019 ( < 0.1 pc) due to the very turbulent nature f the velocity fields, and the small thermal line widths (Tauber, oldsmith & Dickman 1991 ; Falgarone et al. 1998 ). This localized ature of CO line optical depths and the macro-turbulent CO line ormation mechanism allows a great simplification of the radiative ransfer models of such lines, i.e. the use of the so-called Large Veocity Gradient (LVG) approximation. Ho we ver, it also complicates he relationship between the CO line luminosity and the underlying 2 gas mass, making the corresponding con version factor , \u03b1CO , ependent on the thermal state of the gas, its average density, as ell as its dynamic state. F ollowing P apadopoulos et al.

In principle, multiphase VG models of CO (and 13 CO) SLEDs can be used to constrain CO , but, in practice, this demands large line data sets per galaxy e.g. Papadopoulos et al. 2014 ; Harrington et al. 2021 ), making it mpractical for use in large galaxy samples. This is why in our study CO remains an empirical conversion factor to be (cross)-calibrated.\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n1 The measurement is in fact the [C 0 / CO] abundance, and a value for [CO/H 2 ] as then to be assumed to infer X C I . 2 Here, the cloud CO-H 2 volume filling factor is set f CO = 1.\n972 L.

The properties of these samples are in Table 2 . The best constraints at log 10 L IR > 11 14 come from the daX sample ecause it has three independent tracers of gas mass, but it lacks o v erage of luminosities below l IR = 11. The ad sample is the largest nd spans the widest range in L IR , reflecting the longer time for which O observations have been possible for nearby galaxies. We begin with the daX sample, to illustrate the method of optimizaion for the estimates of all three conversion factors simultaneously. 15\nhere are four unknowns namely: m = log ( M H2 ), X = log ( X C I ), = log ( \u03baH ), and \u03b1 = log ( \u03b1CO ), and three observables: L \u2032 CO , L \u2032 C I , nd L 850 . With an independent measure of the true M H2 , the observables ould provide direct estimates of the three conversion factors; o we ver, the v alue of M H2 is not kno wn a priori , so we must use a robabilistic argument based on the fact the observations do provide onstraints on the relative values of the conversion factors for each alaxy. There is, thus, a set of self-consistent conversion factors hich link the observables to the true M H2 , with an unknown common onstant factor. The Bayesian approach we use is described, in detail, in Apendix F and requires an estimate of the intrinsic scatter for the ogarithms of each of the factors: s X , s \u03ba , and s \u03b1 . The observable uminosities relate to these factors as follows, where the coefficients\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n3 Hereafter, we omit the units for \u03b1CO , \u03b1C I , and \u03b1850 . 4 Hereafter, we will refer to log 10 as simply log. 5 This method was first presented in brief in Dunne et al. ( 2021 ), where it as applied to the sample of z = 0.35 galaxies.\nt e\n1\nt i\nf proportionality are listed in Table 3 :\nL \u2032 CO L \u2032 C I \u221d \u03b1CO X C I , L 850 L \u2032 C I \u221d \u03baH X C I , L \u2032 CO L 850 \u221d \u03b1CO \u03baH . (12)\ne begin by measuring the intrinsic scatter between the three pairs f observables using an orthogonal distance regression (ODR) fitting ethod, which includes the intrinsic scatter, \u03bb, as a third parameter n the analysis 16 (see Appendix I for full details). The three pair ariances deri ved from the data are then used to estimate the intrinsic ariance of the three individual conversion factors (the deri v ation an be found in Appendix E ). The values of the intrinsic scatter for he parameters are given in Table 3 , with X C I having the smallest catter between galaxies. This finding is purely empirical, requiring o assumptions about the values or trends of the conversion factors, nd as such is very interesting.\nAs we do not have any independent measure of the gas mass ith which to normalize our cross-calibration (four unknowns but nly three measurements), we must make an assumption about the ample average of one of the physical or empirical conversion factors. o we ver, with that assumption made transparent, the individual alues can al w ays be scaled to whichever normalization a reader ishes to adopt. The relative values, however, are always the optimal\nolution. We choose to use the dust parameter \u03baH = \u03b4GDR / \u03ba850 for this ormalization, because there are no trends of L 850 / L \u2032 CO or L 850 / L \u2032 C I ith L IR (see Figs 2 and G1 ) and \u03baH also has the best observational onstraints.\nFor the Xa sample, where there are no dust continuum measureents, we normalize to X C I N = 1 . 6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which is the mid-range\nf the values suggested by the independent study of absorption lines y Heintz & Watson ( 2020 ). All the galaxies in our sample are metal rich (0.5 < Z / Z < 2) nd so we assume that \u03baH ( \u03b4GDR ) should be similar to that in the ilky Way and other local discs. Throughout the rest of this work, e will use as our reference point the mid-range of extragalactic eterminations, \u03baH = 1500\u20132200 kg m \u22122 , which are consistent with easurements of the diffuse ISM in the Milky Way. Our chosen ormalization value, then, is \u03baH N = 1884 kg m \u22122 , which is a good atch to current theoretical dust models (THEMIS: Jones et al. 2017 , nd the updated Draine et al. 2007 modified by Hensley & Draine 021 ). For the standard Milky Way value of \u03b4GDR ( = 135, Magdis t al. 2012 ; Jones et al. 2017 ), \u03baH = 1884 kg m \u22122 implies that \u03ba850 0.071 m 2 kg \u22121 , similar to that used in many extragalactic studies Dunne et al. 2000 ; James et al. 2002 ; da Cunha et al. 2013 ). For a GDR fixed to 135, the range of \u03baH in extragalactic studies implies range in \u03ba850 of 0.06\u20130.09 m 2 kg \u22121 . Table C1 lists \u03baH values from xtragalactic and Galactic observations, as well as from theoretical ust models. Note that the choice of normalization does not affect any of the rends, nor the ratio of the conversion parameters in the pairings; it erely sets the average value of the reference calibration parameter, o which the others are relative. The sample mean expectation values for the other two parameters, \u03b1CO \u3009 and \u3008 X C I \u3009 , are next derived from our assumed value of \u3008 \u03baH \u3009 , ogether with the mean ratios of the observables listed in Table 3 . The ffective standard deviation is also calculated \u2013 the intrinsic scatter\n6 We need to multiply \u03bb from the ODR fitting routine by \u221a\n2 because we need o know the intrinsic scatter of X \u2212 Y in our data set in order to determine the ntrinsic scatter of each conversion factor in turn.\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 973\no t\n\u03c3\nw m\no t t \u3008 d i\nP\nT b a i A v\nw\nm\nw t t c\na\nT v\n\u03c3\na v\n\u03c3\nw q\no t\n4\nA l\n1\no c\ns c w p e w a d l F t\n4\nT v o u 8 t t H l w G < h ( m w b p s t c l (\n4\nT p d r a d t t A 0 o s fi l s fi\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nf each parameter added in quadrature to the measurement error for hat gas tracer. For example, for CO\neff = \u221a\ns 2 \u03b1 + \u03c3 2 CO , here s \u03b1 is the intrinsic scatter in log( \u03b1CO ), and \u03c3 CO is the easurement error on log( L \u2032 CO ). We can now estimate the probability of finding a particular set\nf conversion factors for any given galaxy. We use a i , i = 1 , 2 , 3 o denote the logarithms of the three conversion factors, 17 and write he mean expectation values and effective standard deviations as a i \u3009 and \u03c3i, eff , respectively. Assuming that these follow Gaussian istributions, the probability of finding the factors, a i , for any galaxy s\n\u221d N \u220f\ni= 1 exp\n( \u2212 ( a i \u2212 \u3008 a i \u3009 ) 2\n2 \u03c3 2 i , eff\n)\n= exp ( \u2212 N \u2211\ni= 1\n( a i \u2212 \u3008 a i \u3009 ) 2 2 \u03c3 2 i , eff\n) . (13)\nhus, the ratios of observable luminosities for any given galaxy can e used to determine the ratios of conversion factors (equation 12 ), nd the common scaling factor that maximizes the probability n equation (13) is the best estimate of M H2 . The deri v ation in ppendix F shows that this reduces analytically to a simple inverse ariance weighted mean, such that log M opt H 2 = \u2211 N\ni= 1 ( m i \u00d7 w i ) \u2211 N i= 1 w i , (14)\nhere w i = 1 /\u03c3 2 i, eff , and m i is the log mass estimate for each tracer. i = l i + \u3008 a i \u3009 , here l i is the measured observable (log luminosity) and \u3008 a i \u3009 is he sample mean expectation value for the conversion factor. Once he optimal mass is determined this way, we can then estimate the orresponding optimal conversion factor on a per-galaxy basis, as\ni = m opt \u2212 l i . (15) he error on the optimal mass is simply the error on the inverse ariance weighted mean\nopt m =\n( N \u2211\ni= 1 w i\n) \u22121 / 2 , (16)\nnd the error on each of the conversion factors, accounting for coariance is\nai = \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u03c3 2 m opt + \u03c3 2 li ( 1 \u2212 2 w i \u2211 N\nj= 1 w j\n) , (17)\nhere \u03c3 li is the logarithmic measurement error on the observable uantity, e.g. L \u2032 CO , L \u2032 C I , L 850 .\nBy design, each tracer for a given galaxy, together with its ptimized conversion factors, will produce the same gas mass, such hat M H2 CO = M H2 C I = M H2 dust .\nT R E N D S IN T H E LUMINOSITY R AT I O S\ns our cross-calibration process relies on measurements of the uminosity ratios, it is first instructive to look at the trends in these\n7 For ease of representation, a 850 = \u2212log ( \u03b1850 ).\ng b p\nbservables to better understand any subsequent trends in the derived onversion factors.\nHistograms of the tracer ratios are shown in Fig. 2 , split by factors uch as lensing, redshift, SFR, and other notable quantities. The orrelations of the three tracer luminosities are shown in Fig. 3 , here the various samples are colour coded and labelled and in each anel the blue line and shaded region represent the best fit and 2 \u03c3 rror interval. Fitting was performed using our own ODR method, hich includes x and y errors, intrinsic scatter as a third parameter, nd covariance in errors where required. The method is described in etail in Appendix I . Fit parameters, slope m , intercept c , and scatter n \u03bb, are listed in Table 4 and statistics for the various subsets from ig. 2 are given in Table 5 . It is instructive to look at these two plots ogether for the same luminosity pairs.\n.1 L 850 versus L \u2032 CO\nhe left-hand column of Figs 2 and 3 (a) show the quantities L 850 ersus L \u2032 CO . There are no significant differences in the distribution f L 850 / L \u2032 CO with lensing, redshift or SF-mode, but the observed ncorrected ratio is significantly higher for galaxies with log L \u2032 CO < .9 (Fig. 2 ; left green histogram). These log L \u2032 CO < 8.9 galaxies tend o have optical discs dominated by atomic hydrogen ( f H I > 1) and he likely increased contribution to L 850 from dust associated with I rather than H 2 results in the offset to higher L 850 / L \u2032 CO ratios. For ocal galaxies with f H I > 1, we apply a correction (Appendix B1 ) hich appears to remo v e this offset (c yan diamonds in Fig. 3 a). alaxies with log L \u2032 CO < 8.9 from the VALES sample at 0.04 < z 0.3 (Hughes et al. 2017 ; Villanue v a et al. 2017 ) have noticeably igher L 850 / L \u2032 CO ratios than VALES galaxies with log L \u2032 CO > 8.9 peach circles in Fig. 3 a and Table 5 ). There are no published H I easurements for VALES, but we suspect that the lo-VALES sample ith log L \u2032 CO < 8.9 is likely to be H I -rich, based on the similarity etween the log L \u2032 CO < 8.9 and f H I > 1 categories in the third anel. We therefore exclude lo-VALES from our averages, as we uspect they are in need of a correction for H I but we have no means o apply one. We also recommend that a low L \u2032 CO requires careful onsideration of H I -related dust. In Fig. 3 (a), the tracers show a inear dependence, regardless of exactly which galaxies are included Table 4 ). The lo-VALES galaxies are excluded from all the fits.\n.2 L 850 versus L \u2032 C I he central column of Figs 2 and 3 (b) show L 850 versus L \u2032 C I , the air with the least scatter (ln \u03bb in Table 4 ). There are no significant ifferences in the distributions of L 850 / L \u2032 C I as a function of lensing, edshift, or SF-mode. The L 850 \u2013L \u2032 C I sample has 12 galaxies with large ngular sizes from J19 that have only part of their disc detected in C I , enoted C I cor . To compare L \u2032 C I and L 850 for these galaxies, we need o apply an aperture correction to their C I fluxes, thereby assuming hat their L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO ratios remain roughly constant across the disc (see\nppendix 4.4 ). Some of the correction factors are very large (up to .7 de x); ev en after correction, their L 850 / L \u2032 C I ratios are significantly ffset from the rest of the MS sample (green histogram). Fig. 3 (b) hows L 850 versus L \u2032 C I , with the C I\ncor galaxies as pink diamonds. The t to all galaxies including the C I cor subset is shown as a dotted blue\nine, and has a sub-linear slope m (3 \u03c3 ), although the difference is very mall ( m = 0.937 \u00b1 0.020). Excluding the C I cor galaxies from the t leaves a linear relationship, shown by the blue solid line. At first lance, this and the green histogram in Fig. 2 suggests that our COased corrections are insuf ficient; ho we ver, Fig. 3 (d) shows that the roblem is not simply the assumption used to correct L \u2032 C I to match the\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n974 L.

This plot shows the dust emissivity cross-section, \u03c3 \u2032 850 , qui v alent to L 850 but with the temperature sensitivity remo v ed. 18 mportantly, this quantity is measured in the same aperture as L \u2032 C I . he C I cor galaxies are shown as pink stars, and they \u2013 along with any other low-luminosity galaxies in J21 \u2013 still appear to have less I emission for a given amount of dust. .3 L \u2032 C I versus L \u2032 CO he right-hand column of Figs 2 and 3 (c) show L \u2032 C I versus L \u2032 CO . here are no significant differences in L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO for strongly lensed ersus unlensed sources, but the highest redshift, z > 3, galaxies ave higher L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO ratios at marginal significance ( p = 0.012). here are only 11 galaxies at z > 3 and a larger sample is needed o determine if this is a genuinely significant trend. Fig. 3 (c) shows he C I cor galaxies as pink diamonds, where the C I and CO fluxes re measured in the same apertures by J19 . The solid line shows he fit to all galaxies, which is non-linear at 3 \u03c3 significance ( m = .078 \u00b1 0.026). The slope becomes linear once the C I cor galaxies are emo v ed. The green histogram in Fig. 2 (right) shows more clearly hy we see this: the C I cor galaxies have significantly lower L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO atios compared to other galaxies at similar or higher luminosity. he bottom histogram shows a marginal difference between galaxies ith different SFRs ( p = 0.056) when excluding the C I cor galaxies, hich becomes significant when they are included ( p = 0.006). .4 Resolved C I fluxes from Herschel FTS mapping\nhe local resolved galaxies observed with Herschel FTS (J19) lie ff the global trends seen in Fig. 3 . There are possible physical xplanations why lower luminosity, and more quiescently starorming galaxies might have lower C I /CO line ratios (for example, ifferent ISM environments in terms of their position in the CR nergy density versus average molecular gas density diagram: see g. 1 in Bisbas et al. 2015 ). Low ratios of L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO have been found n other studies, most intriguingly in the case of the interacting LIRG GC 6052 using ALMA (Michiyama et al. 2020 ), and some high- z trongly lensed sources (Harrington et al. 2021 ). Such ratios tend o be unusual in higher luminosity samples, ho we ver, whereas the esolved FTS sample has a very low avera g e for the C I line ratios ith both CO and dust.\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n8 \u03c3 \u2032 850 is derived from the data provided in Jiao et al. ( 2021 ) by multiplying he dust mass in the C I aperture by the \u03ba850 used in their method, \u03ba850 0.034 m 2 kg \u22121 (Draine 2003 ; Draine et al. 2007 ).\nt d J a o\nWe recommend caution in the interpretation of the data for these esolved FTS sources because another team subsequently presented he same data but drew different conclusions (Crocker et al. 2019 ). We an therefore only note that the C I fluxes from Herschel FTS mapping ata sets are not al w ays consistent when analysed by different eams. 19 As these resolved FTS measurements are essentially the nly source of C I data at log L IR < 11, and carry a lot of weight in IR and SFR correlations, we chose not to include the C I cor galaxies n the statistical analysis. If, instead, we take the J19 measurements t face value \u2013 they signpost a fundamental physical change in I properties, a finding which clearly warrants further study with round-based facilities. We discuss possible physical mechanisms or changes in the L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO and L \u2032 C I / L 850 ratios in Appendix B2 .\n.5 Trends with global indicators of star formation\ninally, we check to see if any of the tracer ratios are sensitive to FR indicators. In our data set, the dust observables L IR and T d are\nndicators of the intensity and magnitude of star formation in galaxies e.g. Kennicutt 1998 ; Foyle et al. 2012 ; Liu et al. 2021 ). As expected, he distribution of T d is very different for the MS galaxies and SMGs Fig. 4 and Table 5 ), reflecting the increase in the intensity of star ormation in the SMGs. The only tracer ratio sensitive to these SF ndicators is L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO , which in Fig. 5 is seen to increase with L IR and d when all galaxies are considered. Such a trend was not reported or smaller samples o v er a more limited range of luminosity (e.g. Jiao t al. 2017 , 2019 ), presumably because of limited statistics. Ho we ver, f the C I cor galaxies (pink diamonds) are excluded, the correlation ll but disappears (blue dotted line).\nNaiv ely, we might e xpect L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO to rise with increasing SFR ntensity, due to the expected destruction of CO by CR in highFR environments (e.g. Bisbas et al. 2015 ). For a given range of H 2 ensities in the typically hierarchical molecular clouds, any increased R-induced ionization rate, \u03b6 CR (due to a rising average CR energy ensity, U CR ) will destroy CO in the lower density, more extended reas, while leaving CO still tracing H 2 in the more compact, denser egions (see also fig. 1 of Papadopoulos et al. 2018 for a visual effect f this). Intriguingly, the gas density, n (H 2 ), and CR ionization rate,\nhem from their published measurements; hence, we cannot use their work irectly in our analysis. Q. Jiao has provided us with the maps used in 19 , enabling us to check the measurements independently and extend our nalysis, b ut we ha ve had no responses to our requests for integrated fluxes r the details of the method used from the Crocker team.\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 975\n\u03b6 w t t n d b 2 t o m\np c\n5\nI fi a t S\ns s d l a g e W e i m d b t c 1 f f e m a s u s m\nt (\n2\nr 2\na P e o 2\n2\n1\nc C w a m\n5\nW m g\n5\nW h s m s s o F l b d g w h\nZ e i f o m p o i c k t i h e t h i m\nu\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nCR , will compete against each other in ULIRG/SMG environments, ith the higher < n > expected in their highly turbulent ISM tending\no keep the ordinary CO/C I chemistry in place, even when exposed o the higher \u03b6 CR values. 20 Guessing which one will win this highly on-linear competition (see fig. 1 and 8 in Bisbas et al. 2015 ) is angerous in the absence of CO and C I line data. These effects have een probed with a variety of simulations (e.g. Bisbas et al. 2015 , 021 ; Clark et al. 2019a ; Gong et al. 2020 ) and while showing similar rends, they are not easily parameterisable in terms of n (H 2 ) and \u03b6 CR ; ne reason why such cross-calibration efforts of the available gas ass tracers are so important. 21\nThe other two tracer ratios show no trends with either L IR , T d (our roxies for SFR) \u2013 we present the rele v ant plots in Appendix G1 for ompleteness.\nRESULTS\nn this section, we present the results of the optimization method, rstly for the daX sample, for which we have all three gas tracers, nd later for the other three samples, for which we have pairs of racers. We investigate trends of the conversion factors with L IR and FR. Mean values for the conversion factors are listed in Table 6 . Fig. 6 shows the results for the daX sample (Figs 7 \u20139 present the ame results for each of the samples in turn). The top row of each plot hows the distribution of the relevant physical parameter for C I and ust, and the conversion factor for CO: X C I , \u03baH , and \u03b1CO . The lower eft-hand panels show the same quantities for the individual galaxies s a function of L IR ; each panel indicates a reference measure to iv e conte xt. F or X C I , the horizontal lines indicate the measured xtremes found in the local Universe: Orion A/B clouds in the Milky ay (Ikeda et al. 2002 ) and the starburst centre of M 82 (White t al. 1994 ), while the grey shaded region shows the range of values nferred from observations of GRB hosts and QSO absorbers for solar etallicity by Heintz & Watson ( 2020 ). They use a method which oes not rely on emission measures of dust, CO, or C I and so can e considered independent. For \u03b1CO , the horizontal lines indicate he typical \u03b1CO for the Milky Way (Bolatto et al. 2013 ) and that ommonly adopted 22 for ULIRGs and SMGs (Downes & Solomon 998 ). For \u03baH , we show a shaded band indicating the range derived or local galaxies (see Table C1 ), along with lines showing the value or the most diffuse and dense sightlines in the Milky Way (Remy t al. 2017 ).

Fig. 6 shows that for galaxies with log L IR > 11 there are only weak rends of the conversion factors with L IR .

Ho we ver, e ven in the ALMA era, this remains very xpensiv e in terms of telescope time making it prohibitive for large samples f galaxies. 2 In this panel, \u03b1CO does not include the factor 1.36 for He. 3 As elsewhere, the empirical parameters \u03b1C I and \u03b1850 include the factor .36 for He.\no s a s\np\nb c s s\nonsistent with the Milky Way and other nearby spirals, the CO and I conversion factors derived from the luminosity ratios also lie ithin the ranges expected from independent studies. The averages t log L IR < 11 are based on only a small number of points (12) and ore C I studies are required to probe quiescent local galaxies.\n.1 A calibration for the gas masses\ne next give a prescription for estimating gas mass, tailored to how any tracers are available and \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 the type of\nalaxy being investigated.\n.1.1 Dual-band\nhile the information content is greatest for the daX sample, which as three tracer pairs to optimize, the method presented in Section 3 till impro v es the cross-calibration for samples which hav e two tracer easurements, i.e. one pair. The results for the Xd, Xa, and ad amples are shown in Figs 7 \u20139 and behave similarly to the daX ample, as one would hope given that the daX galaxies are a subset f the others. The pink diamonds in the lower left-hand panels in igs 7 and 8 denote the C I cor galaxies. The cyan diamonds in the ower left-hand panel of Fig. 9 are galaxies with f H I > 1 which have een corrected for the contribution of dust mixed with the H I gas, as escribed in Appendix A . The open peach circles are the lo-VALES alaxies, which we suspect to have f H I > 1 (see Section 4.1 ) but hich we cannot correct. We do not include these in an y av erages or istograms. The method previously used in the literature (e.g. Alaghbandadeh et al. 2013 ; Scoville et al. 2016 ; Hughes et al. 2017 ; Orellana t al. 2017 ; Valentino et al. 2018 ) has been to assume one tracer n a pair (e.g. L \u2032 CO ) has a known conversion ( \u03b1CO ), then to fix that actor for all galaxies in order to estimate the second (i.e. the one f interest). We show this simple method alongside our optimal ethod as grey lines and dashed grey error bars in the rele v ant anels of Figs 7 \u20139 . The scatter in the conversion factors for the ptimized estimates are go v erned by the intrinsic scatter we inferred n our analysis of the data in Appendix E , free of assumptions. In ontrast, the simple method proscribes that there is no scatter in the nown con version factor , and therefore all of the intrinsic scatter in he luminosity ratio is attributed to the second conversion factor of nterest. The optimized method presented here does not assume an ad oc preference for any particular conversion factor: as it is based on mpirical variance analysis, it uses more of the available information o impro v e the accurac y of the estimated conv ersion factors. The istograms in Figs ( 7 \u20139 ) show that the scatter in the factor of interest s larger when using the simple method, and the trends in the running edians are also more exaggerated. Comparing the parameter estimates using three tracers to those sing two tracers for the same galaxies allows us to test the accuracy f these two-tracer estimates. The details are in Appendix H , but in ummary there is a reasonable correlation between the three-tracer nd two-tracer estimates, without bias (Fig. H1 ) and an average catter of 0.06\u20130.08 dex.\nThus, when multiple H 2 tracers are available, we recommend the rocedure outlined in the example below. Example: Take the example of a galaxy with observations of oth dust and CO. We take the mean value for the appropriate pair ombination from Table 3 : \u03b1CO / \u03baH = 0.00133. For our adopted ample mean normalization of \u03baN = 1884 kg m \u22122 , we now infer the ample mean expectation value of \u3008 \u03b1\u3009 = 0.00133 \u00d7 1884 = 2.5\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n976 L.

(18) ext, we calculate the ef fecti ve standard de viation by adding the bservational error on the tracer luminosities in quadrature to the ntrinsic scatter for \u03b1 and \u03ba . \u03ba eff = \u221a s 2 \u03ba + \u03c3 2 850 , \u03b1 eff = \u221a s 2 \u03b1 + \u03c3 2 CO , (19) here \u03c3 850 , \u03c3 CO are the errors on log ( L 850 ) and log ( L \u2032 CO ), and s \u03ba and \u03b1 are the intrinsic scatter on log ( \u03baH ) and log ( \u03b1CO ) listed in Table 3 . The optimal H 2 mass estimate is then calculated thus opt = M \u03ba/\u03c3 2 \u03ba, eff + M \u03b1/\u03c3 2 \u03b1, eff 1 /\u03c3 2 \u03ba, eff + 1 /\u03c3 2 \u03b1, eff .

(21) .1.2 Single band: empirical conversion factors\nhe three empirical conversion factors, \u03b1850 , \u03b1C I , and \u03b1CO , directly elate the observable tracer luminosity to a gas mass, according to quation ( 1 ). If only one tracer ( L \u2032 CO , L \u2032 C I , or L 850 ) is available, the mpirical conversion factor we have estimated in Table 7 is the best hoice. We adopt a convention that the empirical parameters are eferenced to M mol , which includes a factor 1.36 for He.\nFigs 6 \u20139 show the empirical conversion factors as a function of IR ; Fig. 10 shows the empirical conversion factors as a function of\nhe tracer luminosity, and Fig. 11 shows their distribution when the ample is split into MS galaxies and SMGs (see Table 8 for details). ll empirical factors show significant but shallow correlations with he tracer luminosity. We have carefully accounted for the co-variance\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\netween the x and y parameters when fitting, so the correlations we nd are not caused by the involvement 24 of L 850 , L \u2032 C I , and L \u2032 CO in he deri v ation of \u03b1850 , \u03b1C I , and \u03b1CO . Table 9 lists the fit parameters. he intrinsic scatter in all of these relationships is very small once he measurement errors are accounted for. Correlations are also seen etween L IR and \u03b1850 , \u03b1C I , and \u03b1CO (Fig. 7 \u20139 ), albeit with more catter.\nA correlation between \u03b1850 and L 850 was also noted by Sco16 shown as the red dashed line on our plot) but ours is somewhat hallower ( m = 0.052 versus m = 0.07 from Sco16), although the ifference is unlikely 25 to be significant. These shallow but significant elationships with their tracer luminosity could be further applied to ive a more accurate calibration (see Table 9 ). The trends of \u03b1C I and CO with their respective tracers are explored for the first time in arge numbers here.\n.2 Discussion of empirical factors relati v e to the literature.\n.2.1 Submillimetre dust empirical calibration, \u03b1850\nhe final calibration factors from this work are provided in Table 0. A compilation of \u03b1850 values from our optimal method 26 and hose from the literature, referenced to a common \u03b1CO = 4 . 3: the alactic value including He from Bolatto et al. ( 2013 ) is presented in able 11 . Literature values co v er the range, \u03b1850 = 3.6\u201310.1 \u00d7 10 12 , omfortably within the range of estimates here: \u03b1850 opt = 6.5\u2013 .2 \u00d7 10 12 . The lo west v alue, \u03b1850 = 3 . 6 + 3 . 6 \u22121 . 9 \u00d7 10 12 , comes from the ocal sample of Orellana et al. ( 2017 ), who include H I as well as M mol from L \u2032 CO ). Their \u03b1850 refers to the total gas mass \u2013 sensibly, since heir lower luminosity sample is more H I -dominated than the others e compare to \u2013 meaning that a lower value for \u03b1850 is required.

This statistical bias results in a linear mean for \u03b1850 which is 0 per cent higher than the log-mean (Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy 013 ). Assuming the shape of our \u03b1850 distribution is similar to hat from Sco16, we adjust their linear mean down by 20 per cent to pproximate our log-mean method. Thus, our log-mean estimate of\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nhe Sco16 value is \u03b1850 LM (Sco16) = 8 . 4 \u00d7 10 12 . Secondly, there have een changes in the versions of the Herschel pipeline data used as he basis for the local portion of the Sco16 sample (see Appendix A ).\nhen we re-fitted the local galaxy SEDs to estimate T mw and L 850 sing the most recent Herschel flux densities (Chu et al. 2017 ; Clark t al. 2018 ), we found an increase in L 850 of \u223c0.1 dex compared to\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 979\nt S\n2\nm\nA\nhat reported in Sco16. 28 Once these factors are accounted for, the co16 result is comparable to ours.\n8 This difference is not just the photometry change; Sco16 used a different ethod to estimate L 850 from the Herschel 500- \u03bcm fluxes.\nW l v e\ntomic carbon empirical factor: \u03b1C I\ne compare our optimized \u03b1C I estimates with others from the iterature in Table 12 , and for reference, we also compile the literature alues for X C I in Table 13 , the two are related simply by the xcitation factor Q 10 , as given in equation ( 11 ).

This compares ell with the only truly independent measure, \u03b1C I = 21 . 4 + 13 \u22128 , from bsorber systems across a range of redshift by Heintz & Watson 2020 ), but is considerably higher than reported by many literature tudies, e.g. \u03b1C I = 4 . 9\u201310.3 for a large study of (U)LIRGs by Jiao\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nt al. 2017 and \u03b1C I = 7 . 3 + 6 . 9 \u22123 . 6 for local discs by Crocker et al. 2019 ). Many literature studies assume a fixed value for either C I or \u03b1CO in order to derive \u03b1C I (typically X C I = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 or CO = 1 for high- z SMG or local (U)LIRGs).

Low luminosity (log L IR < 11) values are based only on the ad sample due to the small numbers of reliable C I measurements in this luminosity range. The differences in the weighted means for SMGs and MS galaxies are significant in all cases, but are likely driven by the trends with luminosity seen in Figs 6 , 9, and 10 . A more accurate way to determine the conversion factor to use would be to use one of the relationships from Table 9 .\ne s\na H o o r d g a a l w t 4 m o d t d i\nc a t a d r M u o o \u03b4 s \u3008 a o t i\n2\nw\nT M b\nC\nW l d i e I d r o t i\na d c m 4 c f a t o 2 ( i d t t b a 0 a w\n5\nO t r s s w l g a\n30 While there are differences in the normalization for the dust mass model chosen by J21 and ourselves, the introduction of a metallicity dependence for the dust-to-gas ratio by J21 means that there is no simple way to scale their results to our method.

Table 12 describes the assumptions made for each literature ource. The MS galaxies in this work have a value of \u03b1C I of 19.1 \u00b1 0.6, gain significantly higher than that found in Crocker et al. ( 2019 ). o we ver, J19 , using a largely overlapping sample, derived a value f \u03b1C I = 19 . 9 \u00b1 1 . 9 using the same Herschel FTS C I mapping bservations. Crocker et al. use L \u2032 [CO](2 \u22121) images and spatially esolved \u03b1CO estimates from Sandstrom et al. ( 2013 ), which were erived using a robust method which minimizes the scatter in the as-to-dust ratio (see also Eales et al. 2012 ). While there are no priori assumptions about \u03b1CO in Crocker et al. ( 2019 ), implicit ssumptions are required for the av erage CO r 21 e xcitation. The imited sensitivity of the FTS instrument to [C I ](1\u20130) meant that C I as primarily detected in the brighter nuclear regions, where \u03b1CO ends to be lower than is typical in spiral discs ( \u223c1 compared to \u223c3\u2013 ), (e.g. Sandstrom et al. 2013 ) \u2013 as noted by Crocker et al. Their easured L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO ratios in the resolved regions are compatible with ther MS galaxies in our sample (though still higher than the ratios erived for the same set of sources by J19 , see Fig. 5 ), meaning hat the \u03b1C I / \u03b1CO ratios are also similar. As \u03b1CO in these regions is etermined to be low in the Sandstrom et al. ( 2013 ) analysis, the \u03b1C I nferred by Crocker et al. is correspondingly lower as well. Jiao et al. ( 2021 ; hereafter J21) use CO(1\u20130), H I , [C I ](1\u20130), dust ontinuum, and metallicity maps to investigate the variation of \u03b1C I nd \u03b1CO across the discs of six well-resolved local galaxies from heir J19 study. They use the FIR/submm dust maps from Spitzer nd Herschel and the method of Draine et al. ( 2007 ) to model the ust mass across the galaxy and relate this to a gas mass via a elationship between dust-to-gas and metallicity (Draine et al. 2007 ;\nu \u0303 noz-Mateos et al. 2009 ; Sandstrom et al. 2013 ). As the y e xplicitly se the dust mass together with a model of the \u03b4GDR dependence n metallicity, their results are normalized to the dust properties f the Draine & Li ( 2007 ; hereafter DL07 ) model, which assumes GDR = 100 and \u03ba850 = 0.034 m 2 kg \u22121 at solar metallicity. Their elf-consistent DGR(ii) method derives weighted mean values of \u03b1C I \u3009 = 19 . 9 \u00b1 1 . 9 (including the information from lower limits) nd \u3008 \u03b1CO \u3009 = 2 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 3 (2.6 \u00b1 0.4) o v er the same area as the C I bservations (the entire CO detection region). 29 In the central region, he \u03b1CO values are significantly lower at \u03b1CO C = 1 . 5 \u00b1 0 . 3, while \u03b1C I s not found to be significantly different with \u03b1C I C = 21 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 5.\n9 We have multiplied the values in J21 by 1.36 to include He for consistency ith our convention.\nc H l \u03b1\nhese values are comparable to our average of \u03b1C I = 19 . 1 \u00b1 0 . 6 for S galaxies, and to the average value for Z derived independently y Heintz & Watson ( 2020 ) of \u03b1C I (HW20) = 21 . 4 + 13 . 3 \u22128 . 2 . 30\nO empirical factor: \u03b1CO\ne compare our optimized \u03b1CO estimates with others from the iterature in Table 14 . Sophisticated LVG modelling with very large ata sets which include high-density gas tracers, optically thin CO sotopologues, full CO SLEDs, and sometimes the C I lines and dust mission (e.g. Wei\u00df et al. 2007 ; Papadopoulos et al. 2012b , 2014 ; srael 2020 ; Harrington et al. 2021 ) can break some of the model egeneracies of the optically thick CO lines, though the method is still eliant on assumptions for [CO/H 2 ], isotopologue ratios, the number f components allowed (single components give very different results o multiple components) and the allowed range of velocity gradients n the models.\nThe best examples are NGC 6240 (Papadopoulos et al. 2014 ) nd the Planck lensed galaxies (Harrington et al. 2021 ) where etailed LVG modelling and comprehensive data sets have sufficient onstraints to break the degeneracies which usually be-devil this ethod. The two-component LVG result for NGC 6240 is \u03b1CO = 2\u2013 (Papadopoulos et al. 2014 ; cf. \u03b1CO = 0.6 when using a single omponent LVG model Papadopoulos et al. 2012b ) and we can urther use the ratio of L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO measured by Cicone et al. ( 2018 ) nd our relationship, L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO = \u03b1CO / \u03b1C I = 3324 \u03b1CO X C I , to infer hat X C I = 1 . 4\u20132.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in the starburst region. In fact, our ptimized values for this galaxy using global fluxes, are \u03b1CO ( daX ) = . 9 \u00b1 0 . 6, X C I ( daX ) = (2 . 4 \u00b1 0 . 5) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , \u03baH ( daX ) = 2800 \u00b1 700 \u03b4GDR = 200), in excellent agreement. The Planck lensed galaxes analysed by Harrington et al. ( 2021 ) do not have the same e generac y-breaking lines used by Papadopoulos et al. ( 2014 ) in heir analysis, but they do have multi- J CO coverage and incorporate he C I lines and the dust continuum emission in their model fitting, ased on Wei\u00df et al. ( 2007 ). They assume similar dust parameters s we do for their normalizations ( \u03b4GDR = 120\u2013150 with \u03ba850 = .08 m 2 kg \u22121 ). With this, they infer an average \u03b1CO = 3\u20134 and an verage \u03b1C I = 16 . 2 \u00b1 7 . 9 (including He), remarkably consistent ith our results, given our very simple approach.\n.3 Lack of bi-modality in the conversion factors\nur sample contains normal star-forming galaxies \u2013 those obeying he SFR\u2013M correlation that forms as a result of the more intimate elationship between SFR and H 2 \u2013 as well as many extreme tar-forming systems, which belong to the (U)LIRG and high- z ubmillimeter selected samples. Here, we remind the reader that e refer to the extreme SF group \u2013 those that supposedly require a ower \u03b1CO \u2013 as \u2018SMGs\u2019, and the normal star forming sources as \u2018MS alaxies\u2019, or sometimes just \u2018MS\u2019.

We compare MS galaxies and SMGs for each subset to look for differences in the parameters. The MS group excludes C I cor and lo-VALES galaxies, but it does include the f H I > 1 galaxies, after applying the correction from Appendix B1 . The numbers in each subset are: daX: MS = 46, SMG = 55; Xd: MS = 60, SMG = 79; Xa: MS = 54, SMG = 55; ad: MS = 184, SMG = 144. Bold indicates parameters which are significantly different between the MS galaxies and SMGs in the Z-test and KS tests. The C I parameters, X C I and \u03b1C I , are simply linked due to our adoption of constant Q 10 = 0.48, meaning that the distrib utions ha ve the same KS results. The dust parameters, \u03baH and \u03b1850 , are related to each other as a function of T mw and so the y can behav e differently, e.g. \u03baH can be indistinguishable between samples but the \u03b1850 can be significantly different. Thus in the dust section, there are two P KS values: those for \u03baH and then, in parentheses, those for \u03b1850 . The final column, P KS (25 K ), is the KS result when T mw is fixed to 25 K , which makes the distributions of \u03baH and \u03b1850 identical.\nr f t e o t M t U M e a n a c t\nf t t t S t a t b p ( \u223c o s\n3\n1\nl d\nr e o s w \u03b1 d a l\ni e g t g o \u2018 t t r s i t l f t c i o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023 ather \u2018fuzzy\u2019 as we do not have a measure of SFR or stellar mass or all sources, nor any homogeneous way to estimate them. We, hus, rely on the categories used by previous authors where possible, specially for high- z sources. The z = 1 galaxies from the samples f Bourne et al. ( 2019 ) and Valentino et al. ( 2018 , 2020 ) are deemed o be \u2018MS\u2019, as are the sources from ASPECs (Boogaard et al. 2020 ). ost low redshift sources with log L IR < 12 are classed as \u2018MS\u2019 hough there are some exceptional LIRG class sources in the local niv erse which hav e e xtreme properties as evidenced by their FIR, IR lines, and vibrational HCN (D \u0301\u0131az-Santos et al. 2017 ; Falstad t al. 2021 ). We note that using a more conserv ati ve separation when ssigning galaxies into MS and extreme starburst categories does ot change any of the results. We therefore conclude that while our ssignment of sources into the two SF categories is not perfect, this ategorization is not capable of masking any strong bi-modality in he observable ratios. Fig. 11 and Table 8 detail the distributions of conversion factors or each sample, split into MS galaxies and SMGs. While formally here are significant differences in the parameters for some samples, hese are very small \u2013 around 10\u201320 per cent in the mean, rather han the factor \u223c3\u20134 times often assumed for \u03b1CO (e.g. Downes & olomon 1998 , \u03b1CO = 0.8, derived for four ULIRGs). In fact, only\nhe ad sample shows any difference in \u03b1CO between the MS galaxies nd SMGs, while the estimates based on C I and CO, or on all three racers, show no significant difference. This is partially explained y the larger luminosity range in the ad sample, combined with the re viously noted negati ve correlation between \u03b1CO and luminosity Figs 9 and 10 ), with a factor \u223c2 times reduction in \u03b1CO for a factor 100 times increase in L \u2032 CO . We cannot rule out that the correlation f \u03b1CO with luminosity is the true reason that the ad sample shows a ignificant difference between MS galaxies and SMGs. 31\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n1 L IR (ad) (MS) = 10 . 95 ( L \u2032 CO (ad) (MS) = 9 . 31) while L IR (Xa) (MS) = 1 . 22 ( L \u2032 CO (Xa) (MS) = 9 . 52). Using the relation in Table 9 , the expected \u03b1CO = \u03b1CO (MS) \u2212 \u03b1CO (SMG) = 0 . 36 for the Xa sample and \u2013 due to the ower numbers in the Xa and daX samples \u2013 such a difference would not be etected at a significant level, if it existed.\n3\nC r 3\nt\nThis is not the first time 32 that lack of bi-modality in \u03b1CO has been eported when compared to dust-based determinations (e.g. Magdis t al. 2012 ; Rowlands et al. 2014 ; Genzel et al. 2015 ). The range f \u03b1CO we find for SMGs (see Fig. 9 ) is well within the framework et out by Papadopoulos et al. ( 2012a ), who noted that galaxies ith a highly turbulent ISM (e.g. ULIRGs and SMGs) can have CO similar to galaxies with a much more quiescent ISM, the only ifference being that in a turbulent ISM, the distribution of gas mass s a function of density is weighted to higher densities than in a ess-turbulent ISM.\nRecent joint SLED/SED modelling of an exquisite data set that ncludes CO, C I , and dust continuum for lensed SMGs (Harrington t al. 2021 ) finds a mean \u03b1CO = 3 . 4\u20134.2 for these highly turbulent alaxies (albeit with a large dispersion). The Harrington et al. radiaive transfer models employ a continuum distribution of molecular as mass as a function of average Mach number (and average density f the molecular cloud ensemble), making them better equipped to capture\u2019 any re-distribution of the underlying molecular gas mass owards higher densities. While important for other issues (e.g. he initial conditions of star formation in SMGs/ULIRGs), such a e-distribution in a highly turbulent ISM may actually leave \u03b1CO tatistically unaffected. The initial reports of a bimodal \u03b1CO factor n the local Universe, with \u223c4\u20135 times lower values for ULIRGs han LIRGs and ordinary spirals, can possibly be explained by a COuminous, strongly unbound, low-density molecular gas component ound preferentially in ULIRGs. Such a component can dominate he global CO(1\u20130) line luminosities of ULIRGs/SMGs (even if ontaining only small fractions of their total molecular gas), while ts large K vir values will yield systematically low \u03b1CO factors, under ne-component LVG modelling (equation 9 ). 33\n2 Ho we ver, our current data set is more homogeneous, using only CO(1\u20130) or O(2\u20131) and a consistent approach to modelling the dust with our empirical elations for T mw . 3 Also, we must consider the size of the original sample \u2013 four ULIRGs in he first study by Downes & Solomon ( 1998 ).\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 983\nFigure 10. Correlations of the empirical calibration factors with their tracer luminosity. The largest sample was used in each case: ad (top and bottom); Xd (top centre). For \u03b1850 (top), we include the relationship from Scoville et al. ( 2016 ), exactly as quoted in that paper. Parameters for the median posterior fit (dark blue line), accounting for co-variance in the errors, are quoted in the legend, and we include 100 random fits from sampling the posterior as pale blue lines to show the scatter. Further details are given in Table 9 . All tracers have a significant correlation with their tracer luminosity.\nS g 2 o m w e c i w e t e M\nv c 2 t\ng w t d T \u03b1 l c w\nc p 2 2 2 S a d t\np d b t X e t w s n M m t t c r\n3\nS 3\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nFor individual galaxies, only multicomponent models of LED/SED (that also include molecules/transitions tracing the dense as) can properly account for this effect (e.g. Papadopoulos et al. 014 ; Harrington et al. 2021 ), while for large galaxy samples, ur cross-calibration of \u03b1CO against the other two molecular gas ass tracers, is the most economical method. In that regard, it is orth noting that dust continuum is immune to the gas-dynamics ffects described abo ve , i.e. a dif fuse lo w-density, unbound, H 2 gas omponent will contribute very little to the total dust continuum if ts gas/dust mass is indeed low. The optically thin C I line emission ill also be much less sensitive than CO(1\u20130) to such gas-dynamics ffects exactly because of its low optical depths. These are perhaps he reasons why our cross-calibration of \u03b1CO against dust and C I mission has not unco v ered an y ob vious bimodality of its values in S galaxies compared to SMGs. The range of values we find for \u03b1CO is consistent with expected alues for Z > 0 . 5 Z galaxies (Accurso et al. 2017 , based on alibrating \u03b1CO using C II ). Using their predictions, we would expect . 7 < \u03b1CO < 15 . 2 for the likely range of metallicity and offset from he MS in our sample.\nOur underlying assumption: that the dust\u2013gas properties of MS alaxies and SMGs can be described as a uni-modal distribution ith well-defined mean and scatter, is based on our finding that he luminosity ratios (Fig. 2 ) \u2013 the most basic observables used in eriving the empirical conversion factors \u2013 have such a distribution. hey show no evidence for the strong bi-modality advocated for CO in some of the literature. That the distribution of the observed uminosity ratio is, to first order, similar to the distribution of the onversion parameters, is the simplest \u2018Occam\u2019s Razor\u2019 assumption e can make. To see what a different initial assumption would mean for the onversion factors, we repeated our analysis, this time inserting the opular bi-modal behaviour in \u03b1CO (Greve et al. 2005 ; Wei\u00df et al. 005 ; Tacconi et al. 2006 , 2008 ; Genzel et al. 2010 ; Walter et al. 011 ; Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2013 ; Jiao et al. 2017 ; Valentino et al. 018 ) as our prior, such that the sample mean normalizations for MGs and MS galaxies are set to be different: \u03b1CO N (SMG) = 0 . 8 nd \u03baH N (MS) = 1884 kg m \u22122 . Our optimal method then allows the ata to return the most likely values for the other parameters 34 under hese assumptions.\nFig. 12 shows the results with this bi-modal normalization, (blue oints: MS galaxies, red points: SMGs). By design, we have reprouced the extreme bi-modality \u03b1CO (MS) \u223c 3\u20134 and \u03b1CO (SMG) \u223c 1, ut Fig. 12 clearly shows that the same extreme bi-modality has o be present in \u03baH ( \u03b4GDR ) and X C I , giving a clear prediction that C I (SMG) \u2265 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 if the bimodality in \u03b1CO really exists, with ssentially no o v erlap in X C I between the MS galaxies and SMGs. To est this will require an independent determination of X C I in SMGs, ithout reference to dust or CO calibration. To date, there is no uch determination of X C I , although Izumi et al. ( 2020 ) observed the earby LIRG NGC 7469 with ALMA, using kinematic data to derive dyn , which is the sum of M H2 , stellar mass, and dark matter. This ethod has promise, but the systematic uncertainties in M H2 from his analysis are too large (0.3 dex) to answer our question. While he Izumi et al. study clearly indicates 35 that the [ C 0 / CO] abundance an be enhanced in extreme environments, the CND is only a tiny egion and the global ratio for this source is very similar to other\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n4 We did not re-calculate the intrinsic scatter split into MS galaxies and MGs, only the values of the X C I / \u03b1CO and \u03b1C I / \u03baH pairs. 5 Via the extremely high observable ratio L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO = 0 . 92 in the CND.\n984 L.

Any study which wishes to\nest the bi-modality hypothesis must also be representative of the alaxy global properties.\nHere, we must stress again that for individual galaxies, joint LED/SED radiative transfer models of well-sampled SLEDs and ust emission SEDs do reco v er Galactic-valued \u03b1CO factors even n (U)LIRGs or SMGs (Papadopoulos et al. 2014 ; Harrington et al. 021 ). Ho we ver, such results cannot be used in a statistical sense, i.e. s typical of the respective galaxy populations for obvious reasons, nd our statistical approach remains the sole avenue.\nIndeed, the only way that a bi-modal \u03b1CO for MS galaxies and MGs can be reconciled with M H2 estimates using dust or C I is to\nmpose the same bi-modality on their conversion parameters ( \u03baH , C I , \u03b1850 , \u03b1C I ). A reduction of \u03b1CO by a factor 3 times necessitates a\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\necrease [increase] in \u03baH [ X C I ] by the same factor. Thus, if \u03b1CO = 0 . 8 s preferred for extreme star-forming galaxies (e.g. Walter et al. 011 ), then \u03baH = 600 ( \u03b4GDR = 43 for \u03ba850 = 0.071 m 2 kg \u22121 ) and C I = 5 . 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 must also be adopted (statistically, for this galaxy opulation). This discrepancy was previously noted by Bothwell et al. 2017 ) and Valentino et al. ( 2018 ) who found that using X C I (SMG) = \u00d7 10 \u22125 with L \u2032 C I as a tracer resulted in larger gas masses than using\n\u2032 CO with the \u2018ULIRG\u2019 value of \u03b1CO = 0 . 8. Ther efor e, the popular choices\u2019 of \u03b1CO = 0 . 8 and X C I = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 are incompatible with ach other.\nBased on our current understanding, there are two plausible hysical mechanisms which may cause an increase in X C I and a ecrease in \u03baH in extreme ISM conditions. The effect of enhanced R densities on carbon chemistry (Bisbas et al. 2015 , 2021 ; Glo v er &\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 987\nFigure 12. Results assuming a bi-modal behaviour for \u03b1CO . We run the optimization process with the normalization for SMGs set to \u03b1CO N (SMG) = 0 . 8, keeping MS galaxies at \u03baH N (MS) = 1884 kg m \u22122 (equi v alent to \u03b1CO = 2.8). This creates the strong bi-modality in \u03b1CO but also induces a similarly strong or even stronger effect in \u03baH and X C I , which would be mirrored in \u03b1850 and \u03b1C I .\nC h d e i e (\nh t t c s w m c t t\n5\n5\nS s b r c n t d l r\n5\nT h s t\n3\nv i w T\ns w a w\n0 c\n6\nT i p\n\u03b1 a i q i w w t ( i ( g a t\nw \u2018 \u03ba m\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nlark 2016 ; Gong et al. 2020 ) fa v ours a higher [C 0 / CO] abundance, o we ver, this mechanism is density dependent and is less ef fecti ve in ense regions, which typify the ISM of SMGs. Thus, while extreme nvironments with ele v ated CRs or X-rays would certainly act to ncrease X C I at a fixed density, it does not simply follow that xtreme SF activity will produce high X C I since those same regions CRDR/XDR) are typically found in regions with increased density. The higher dense gas fractions common in SMGs may fa v our igher rates of grain growth, or mantling, both of which would reduce he value of \u03baH \u2013 (i) by decreasing the \u03b4GDR and (ii) by increasing he dust emissivity, \u03ba850 . Our results imply, ho we v er, that an y such hanges must act in harmony with each other so as to maintain the ame observable ratios, so an increase in X C I must correlate directly ith a decrease in \u03baH and \u03b1CO . This prediction is a clear challenge to odels, and full astro-chemical simulations for the extreme physical onditions expected in the ISM of SMGs and ULIRGs will be needed o explore how the three tracers can vary in the exact same way hrough very different physical mechanisms. .4 On the robustness of our choices .4.1 Impact of uncorrected f H I > 1 galaxies tatistically, the effect of having uncorrected f H I > 1 galaxies is mall, since there are only 15 such galaxies, where \u3008 \u03b1CO \u3009 increases 36 y + 0.27 in their luminosity bin compared to when they are emo v ed altogether (by + 0.18 compared to when they have been orrected). We are, thus, confident that dust associated with H I is ot biasing our o v erall determination of conversion factors and their rends, at least in this sample. For indi vidual galaxies, ho we ver, the ifference in \u03b1CO can be very large. When using this method for ow-redshift galaxies with significant H I within the dust-emitting egion, corrections are needed.\n.4.2 Impact of using a constant T mw\nhe strong correlation found between T mw and luminosity (Fig. 1 ) as not been considered in previous works. In Appendix H2 , we how a comparison of results using our empirical T mw relations to hose for constant, T mw = 25 K . Summarizing these findings:\n6 Note that this offset is linear, not logarithmic.\nv c L\n(i) The median offsets between parameters when using constant ersus variable T mw are < 0.015 dex. The scatter in a parameter s generally within 0.1 dex (Fig. H2 ). Thus, the global averages e present in this paper are not affected by a change to constant mw = 25 K . (ii) Allowing T mw to vary with L IR is more realistic and leads to a hallow but significant trend with luminosity, such that \u03b1CO decreases ith increasing L IR , while \u03baH , \u03b1850 , and X C I increase slightly. Using constant T mw of 25 K produces no trends of any conversion factor ith L IR (Fig. H3 ). (iii) Using a constant T mw of 25 K results in gas masses up to .1 dex lower at log L IR < 11 and 0.1 dex higher at l IR < 12.0 ompared to the variable T mw used in the main analysis (Fig. H4 ).\nDI SCUSSI ON\nhe diverse galaxies in this study show a remarkable consistency n their gas mass tracers, with linear relationships between all three airs of observables, L 850 , L \u2032 C I , and L \u2032 CO .\nWe find weak trends in the conversion factors with L IR ; decreasing CO , \u03b1C I and increasing \u03b1850 , \u03baH , X C I . These trends are very shallow, mounting to a factor < 2 times change o v er 2\u20133 orders of magnitude n luminosity. The intrinsic variation in \u03baH and X C I (the physical uantities encompassing most of the uncertainties in the correspondng conversion factors) is likely very small, and approximating them ith a single constant value should be robust. For the sub-samples ith a C I tracer (daX, Xa, Xd), we see decreases in all three racer conversion factors at log L IR < 11: X C I (15\u201325 per cent), \u03b1CO 10\u201330 per cent), and \u03baH ( \u03b4GDR : 20\u201325 per cent). Ho we ver, the data ndicating a drop in conversion factors originates from the J19 sample see earlier discussions). More C I studies of normal star-forming alaxies in the local Universe are urgently required to further explore ny such trend, in particular using the global C I line emission, rather han that of the central few kpc of a galaxy.\nThe average values of X C I , \u03b1CO , and \u03baH ( \u03b4GDR ) for galaxies ith all three tracers (the daX sample) and log L IR > 11 are our reference\u2019 values, \u03b1R CO = 3 . 7 (including He), X R C I = 1 . 6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , H\nR = 1990 ( \u03b4R GDR = 141). These agree within the errors with the ean values determined using only two tracers. These reference\nalues are not unique because only the ratios and products of the onversion factors are constrained by the observables, L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO ,\n\u2032 C I / L 850 , and L 850 / L \u2032 CO .\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n988 L.

For example, using the ad sub-sample and normalizing to H\nN = 2800 m 2 kg \u22121 would produce X C I = 1 . 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and \u03b1CO = . 7, in reasonable agreement with Accurso et al. ( 2017 ) for Z = . 6 Z , while normalizing to \u03b1CO N = 0 . 8 gives X C I = 5 . 8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 nd \u03b4GDR = 34. While the data are consistent with both of these ossibilities, or any other combination of the abo v e ratios, we must aution that the low values of \u03b1CO often reco v ered from CO-only ethods (and after modelling only a few low-J CO lines) may be n artefact of well-known gas-dynamics effects, which are expected o have very little impact on the global C I line emission and none hatsoever on the corresponding dust continuum. For galaxies at log L IR < 11, we can only use the ad sample CO and dust continuum) because of the uncertainties surrounding he C I cor galaxies. For the 88 galaxies at log L IR < 11 with CO nd dust measurements, \u03b1CO = 4 . 8 + 1 . 4 \u22121 . 1 (including He), with \u3008 \u03baH \u3009 = 718 kg m \u22122 ( \u03b4GDR = 122) but note that this is still a sample of assive and metal-rich galaxies, just at lower log L IR \u223c 9 \u221211. This tudy is not applicable to low mass metal-poor galaxies.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne have cross-calibrated the three mainstays of molecular gas easurements in extra-galactic astronomy: 12 CO(1\u20130), [C I ]( 3 P 1 \u2013 P 0 ) and submm continuum emission from dust. This analysis uses alaxy samples spanning 0 < z < 5 and more than four orders of agnitude in L IR . All the galaxies are metal rich and/or massive, to emo v e the need for large corrections for metallicity effects.\n(i) We present a new method of optimizing gas mass estimation hen multiple tracers are observed, making use of the intrinsic scatter n all three pairs of gas tracers. We demonstrate its ef fecti veness ompared to the simpler method used previously in the literature, nd give examples and prescriptions for its use.\n(ii) In a purely empirical analysis, we show that L \u2032 C I is the olecular gas tracer with the least intrinsic scatter, particularly at og L IR > 11. In such galaxies, L \u2032 C I should be the preferred tracer, all ther considerations being equal. (iii) Using our optimized method, we determine the mean empirial conversion factors for M mol (including He). For log L IR > 11 these re: \u03b1C I R = 17 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 3 , \u03b1850 R = (6.9 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10 12 , \u03b1CO R = 4 . 0 \u00b1 . 1, with a scatter of 0.11\u20130.15 dex. These values are for an o v erall ormalization set to the average dust properties of local galaxies and iffuse dust in the Milky Way ( \u03baH = \u03b4GDR / \u03ba850 = 1884 kg m \u22122 ). A hange in this choice of normalization will affect \u03b1CO and \u03b1C I in a roportional manner and \u03b1850 in an inversely proportional way. Our eference conversion values can be applied to any metal-rich galaxy ith Z > 0 . 5 Z in the range 0 < z < 6. (iv) Using the same method, we determine the principal mean hysical parameters on which these conversion values depend. For alaxies at log L IR > 11: X C I R = 1 . 6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , \u03baH R = 1990 ( \u03b4GDR R = 41). (v) The relationships between the observables, L 850 , L \u2032 CO , and L \u2032 C I re consistent with being linear and the ratios of these observables do ot show a strong dependence on IR luminosity, dust temperature, edshift, or the intensity of star formation.\n(vi) The ratio of L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO is marginally (3 \u03c3 ) different for MS alaxies and SMGs, with the latter having higher L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO , broadly onsistent with expectations from astro-chemical cloud models that nclude enhanced CRs.\n(vii) We find Q 10 = 0.48 to be a reasonable choice for the xcitation function (required to convert L \u2032 C I to M C I ), based on recent\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nnalysis showing that Q 10 has a superthermal behaviour in non-LTE onditions (Papadopoulos et al. 2022 ). For a range of plausible galaxy SM density and gas temperatures, the 99th percentile confidence nterval on this value is \u00b116 per cent.\n(viii) We present empirical relations for the mass-weighted dust emperature, T mw , to allow observers to better estimate their dust alibration factors. We find a significant trend, where T mw increases ith L IR . The median T mw for SMGs at z \u223c 2.5 is T mw SMG = 30 . 1 \u00b1 . 7 K , while for MS galaxies T mw MS = 23 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 4 K . (ix) We find a weak trend for \u03baH and X C I to increase with L IR , and\nsimilar trend for \u03b1CO to decrease. The empirical conversion factors \u03b1CO , \u03b1C I and \u03b1850 ) also show a shallow but significant correlation ith their tracer luminosities. These trends are not apparent if a onstant T mw is adopted. They are therefore driven by the change in mw with luminosity. (x) Using an Occam\u2019s Razor assumption that metal-rich galaxies ave similar dust emissivity per unit gas mass, we find no evidence or the factor 3\u20134 \u03b1CO bi-modality between SMGs and MS galaxies ften adopted in the literature. The shallow trends we do find reflect he common assumption that extreme SF systems have lower \u03b1CO and igher X C I , albeit at a far more subtle level, with only a \u223c15 per cent ifference in the sample mean \u03b1850 (higher), \u03b1C I (lower) and \u03b1CO lower) for extreme star-forming galaxies versus \u2018normal\u2019 MS starormers. o o v erall\n(xi) With the Occam\u2019s Razor assumption, we also find no evidence o support the extremely high global estimates of X C I ( \u223c6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) eported in some literature for ULIRGs/SMGs \u2013 the high reported alues are a consequence of assuming a low \u03b1CO \u223c 1. High X C I alues may be expected, and indeed have been measured in small < 500 pc) regions such as M82 (nuclear starbursts) and XDR regions round AGN, but the extent to which a global estimate would be nhanced depends on the dominance of that extreme environment in he galaxy\u2019s H 2 reservoir.\n(xii) One can, ho we ver, still postulate a different prior for the ormalization assumption and impose the popular bimodality in \u03b1CO . he constancy of the measured tracer luminosity ratios then forces he conversion factors for the other two tracers (dust and C I ) to ecome bi-modal in the same way.\nWe conclude by noting that lacking a direct M H2 measurement ethod (i.e. via the H 2 lines themselves), one must assume a\normalization for one of the sample mean conversion factors in tatistical studies like ours. In this study, we choose to benchmark o the dust emission, with \u03baH N = 1884 kg m \u22122 . Other normalization hoices can, of course, be made, but currently dust emission is the implest and best understood tracer, and has the advantage of being otally insensitive to the gas-dynamic effects that affect the \u03b1CO onversion factor (e.g. unbound molecular gas components in the inds that exist in actively star-forming galaxies; winds which can e CO-bright while carrying little mass). The [C I ](1\u20130) line emission ill also be largely unaffected by these gas-dynamics effects, and as uch the corresponding conversion factor, \u03b1C I , shows promise as good benchmark, borne out by the empirical finding that it has he least intrinsic scatter of the three tracers. With more e xtensiv e bservational and theoretical studies of C I line emission (particularly n galaxies of lower IR luminosity), the limits of its usefulness as a as tracer can be determined.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhe authors thank the referee for their careful reading and insightful omments on the original version of the paper.

To estimate T mw , T d , and L 850 , we fitted he photometry presented by Chu et al. ( 2017 ) and Clark et al.

( 2004 ), here for galaxies with D < 148 Mpc, we reduce the 850- \u03bcm flux ensity by 25 per cent. (iii) It appears that the CO(2\u20131) data from Aravena et al. ( 2016 ), as eproduced in Bothwell et al. ( 2017 ), has been incorrectly converted o L \u2032 10 ( L \u2032 21 appears to have been multiplied by 0.9 instead of being ivided by it). We have corrected this error and applied our chosen alue of r 21 = 0.8 for the conversion.\n2 Homogenization of distances\nhe most local galaxies ( D < 30 Mpc) often have a variety of istances used in the literature. As we have often taken L IR , L \u2032 C I , \u2032 CO , and L 850 from different papers, we have had to homogenize he literature luminosities to correspond to a common distance. The istance chosen is that listed in Dale et al. ( 2017 ) and presented in able 1 .\n3 Updating local CO data\nhe Sco16 local galaxy sample used CO(1\u20130) fluxes from the CRAO single-dish surv e y of Young et al. ( 1995 ), which has ignificant and uncertain extrapolations to total fluxes for extended alaxies. We have updated the CO data for these very local galaxies o use CO(1\u20130) maps from the COMING surv e y (Sorai et al. 2019 ) here possible as well as from other mapping data sets from the iterature (Gao & Solomon 2004 ; Kuno et al. 2007 ; Young et al. 008 ; Galametz et al. 2011 ; Koda et al. 2011 ; Schruba et al. 2012 ; eda et al. 2014 ).\new CO measurement for ID141 We use an unpublished CO(1\u20130) ux for ID141, which was observed with the Jansky Very Large rray and has S 10 = 0 . 61 \u00b1 0 . 09 Jy km s \u22121 .\nPPENDIX B: REQU IRED C O R R E C T I O N S\n1 H I -dominated galaxies at lower L IR\nhere is a potential source of bias when deriving calibration factors nvolving L 850 for galaxies with large ratios of f H I = H I / H 2 , as the ust may be tracing H I as well as H 2 . If we apply our method from ection 3 to such H I -dominated galaxies, we will infer the presence f more H 2 due to the dust which resides only in the H I phase. ecause, we calibrate in pairs of tracers, this leads to an o v erestimate f \u03b1CO or \u03b1C I as well as a bias in the dust-based calibration factor. To investigate this, we estimated f H I in the same regions as the ubmm flux densities for the local galaxies we could find in the iterature (Dunne et al. 2000 ; Spekkens, Irwin & Saikia 2004 ; Wong t al. 2013 ; Gro v es et al. 2015 ; Thuan et al. 2016 ; Dale et al. 2017 ; oribalski et al. 2018 ; Jiao et al. 2021 ). As f H I correlates inversely ith M \u2217, metallicity, and L IR (e.g. Bothwell et al. 2014 ; Saintonge t al. 2016 ), this issue affects more of the low L IR galaxies (mostly n the ad sample). For any galaxies with f H I > 1 within the optical isc, we make a correction to L 850 , removing that portion of the ust emission which is likely associated with the excess H I . This orrection is designed to produce the same L 850 /H 2 ratio as a galaxy ith f H I = 1.\n850 cor = L 850\n( 2 f H I + 1 ) . (B1)\nNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nalaxies with f H I > 1 are shown with this correction applied as cyan iamonds in the figures. The higher luminosity (U)LIRGs and SMGs re dominated by molecular gas (e.g. Yao et al. 2003 ), so we do not eed to correct these.\n2 Discussion of local C I data\nor the Herschel FTS measurements of local (U)LIRGs (Lu et al. 017 ), we only include local galaxies with D > 27 Mpc to a v oid ssues with mis-matched beams. We also rejected galaxies where here was a large discrepancy between the measurement of Lu et al. 2017 ) and that of Kamenetzky et al. ( 2016 ; using the same data).\nThe set of local galaxies which were mapped by the Herschel FTS nd presented by J19 are shown in the figures, but not included in he averages for the following reasons:\n(i) The C I and CO measurements are made in matched apertures, o we ver, the area mapped in C I is sometimes much smaller than that sed for the 500\u2013850- \u03bcm flux densities reported in the literature. ny analysis which involves both L \u2032 C I and L 850 requires a correction o L \u2032 C I to address the mis-match in apertures. We attempted to do this y taking the global CO luminosities (which are equi v alent global uxes to the submm continuum measurements) and assume that the eficit between the global L \u2032 CO and that measured in the same aperture s the C I by J19 is the same as the deficit in L \u2032 C I\n\u2032 C I cor = L \u2032 C I J19 L \u2032 CO global\nL \u2032 CO J19 . (B2)\nhese corrections (JC) range from JC = 0 . 00\u20130.74 dex, and the ink diamonds in the figures indicate those galaxies that have C > 0 . 07 de x. Ev en after applying the corrections, the J19 galaxies a ve different a verage properties in the L 850 / L \u2032 C I ratio (see Fig. 2 ). e therefore, do not have confidence in our comparison of L \u2032 C I to 850 for these galaxies and so exclude them from the statistics. (ii) Although the CO and C I luminosities from J19 are measured n the same apertures, there is a trend for these resolved galaxies to ave lower L \u2032 C I for a given L \u2032 CO compared to galaxies which have\nore global flux measurements. There could be a sampling bias ecause C I is only detected o v er the inner kpc or so of the larger alaxies. The CO luminosity per mass of gas ( \u03b1CO ) has been found o be lower in the central regions of many galaxies (Sandstrom et al. 013 ), which would produce a decrease in L \u2032 C I / L \u2032 CO . Since we wish o compare the same averaged global fluxes across all galaxies, we emo v e these \u2018centrally-biased\u2019 galaxies from our statistical analysis, ut we show them in the figures for completeness.\n(iii) Finally, a more recent paper by Jiao et al. ( 2021 ) did produce atched dust and C I measurements for a subset of the J19 galaxies. he results are shown in Fig. 3 (d) where it can be seen that the J21 alaxies are still deficient in C I compared to the higher luminosity alaxies. This cannot be due to a mis-matched aperture but the same ampling bias is present toward the inner regions of the resolved alaxies. An offset to lower L \u2032 C I per L 850 implies either depressed \u2032 C I (lower X C I ) or increased L 850 per unit gas mass (lower \u03b4GDR , or igher dust emissivity). (iv) Unfortunately, this is the only published set of C I fluxes for alaxies with log L \u2032 C I < 8 and the only set of fluxes published for he mapping mode of the Herschel FTS. There is no description in he literature of how the processing for this mode should be made, nd there are differences in the results of J19 and Crocker et al. 2019 ), who analyse some of the same mapping data. Despite our est attempts to contact the rele v ant team, we have not been given he details of their flux measurements.

It is related to the calibration arameter we use in our analysis, \u03baH = \u03b4GDR /\u03bad , where \u03baH refers to he dust emission per H mass, thus encompassing the two unknowns f dust optical properties and gas-to-dust ratio ( \u03b4GDR ). The dust optical properties are not easily measured, and can vary normously from laboratory-based studies to theoretical dust models nd from those inferred by observations (for a re vie w see e.g Dunne t al. 2003 ; Clark et al. 2019b ).\nCommonly adopted extragalactic estimates range from \u03ba850 = .03\u20130 . 08 m 2 kg \u22121 ( Dunne et al. 2000 ; Li & Draine 2001 ; James t al. 2002 ; Draine 2003 ; Planck Collaboration XIX 2011 ; Eales t al. 2012 ; Clark et al. 2016 ; Bianchi et al. 2019 ), though higher alues (by factors of several) are inferred for the very densest nd coldest environments where grains can grow icy mantles and oagulate (K \u0308ohler et al. 2015 ; Remy et al. 2017 ; Ysard et al. 2018 ). hese changes in opacity have also been correlated with a loss of AH and stochastically heated small grains (Flagey et al. 2009 ;\nable C1.

This carbon mantle-accreting regime s largely assumed to be the dark neutral medium (close to the tomic-molecular transition, where there is low CO emission and igh H I opacity). Deeper within clouds, where the temperature rops to T d < 16 K , the dust begins to aggregate and accrete ice antles, which increases the opacity further. These very dense, cold nvironments do not, ho we ver, contain the bulk of the ISM mass and ertainly do not emit a dominant fraction of L 850 in a galaxy (Draine t al. 2007 ; Bianchi et al. 2019 ). The increase in dust emissivity \u03ba850 ) from atomic to moderately dense molecular material is in the ange 1.2\u20132.0 (Remy et al. 2017 ).\nIn fact, it is \u03baH \u2013 the parameter relating the dust emissivity to the as mass \u2013 that can be measured in astrophysical situations, since we ave no absolute knowledge of \u03b4GDR . Table C1 lists a comprehensive et of observational and theoretical values for \u03baH from the literature. stimates of \u03baH in the Milky Way are made across a number of ightlines, from H I -only (diffuse) to H 2 -dominated clouds (dense), here CO emission is used with assumptions about \u03b1CO in order o determine N H . Independent confirmation is provided by studies e.g. Remy et al. 2017 ) using \u03b3 -ray observations to determine the as column; the resulting values of \u03baH are in good agreement (see able C1 ), with \u03baH being higher along diffuse sightlines (1800\u2013 400), dropping to 700\u20131500 in denser molecular or dark neutral edia.\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\nher work in the literature, where \u03b4GDR and \u03baH refer to the mass of hydrogen\nReference\nactic estimates This work\natomic regions fuse sightlines Planck Collaboration XVII ( 2014 ) with \u03b1CO = 3 . 2 Planck Collaboration XI ( 2014 ) tion, Planck, scaled \u03b2 = 1.8 Planck Collaboration XIX ( 2011 ) c with \u03b2 = 1.8, H I Boulanger et al.

( 2004 ). recent study of the [C I ](2\u20131)/(1\u20130) line ratio found that [C I ](2\u20131) s strongly sub-thermally excited, and [C I ](1\u20130) presents interesting uperthermal behaviour in the range of density and temperature xpected for galaxies. We illustrate the dependence of Q ul on ( n , T k ) in ig. D1 . As discussed by Papadopoulos et al. ( 2022 ), the value of Q 10 or lower densities ( n = 300\u20133000 cm \u22123 ) can exceed the LTE value t T k > 20 K , but Fig. D1 shows that for a reasonable range of n and k (300 < n < 10 000 cm \u22123 , 25 < T k < 80 K ) Q 10 does not go outside he range 0.35\u20130.53. In fact, for a uniform probability of (2.4 < log n 4.0) and (25 < T k < 80 K ) the 99-per cent range for Q 10 is 0.40\u2013 .54, median = 0.48. The relative uncertainty on the calibration of I mass from the lack of knowledge of ( n , T k ) is, thus, < \u00b116 per cent. e will therefore use the median value of Q 10 = 0.48 throughout, ecause even though we may be able to use the measured T d to infer he galaxies with higher or lower T k (assuming T k = \u03b1TD T d \u2013 see apadopoulos et al. 2022 ), the lack of knowledge of the density and he superthermal behaviour in the J = 1 state means that there is o direct correlation between Q 10 and T k .

This would lead to an 18-per cent v erestimate of the H 2 mass using C I . For the [C I ](2\u20131) line, things are not so promising [Fig. D1 (rightand panel)]. The range of possible values of Q 21 are large, ranging rom 0.07\u20130.37 for the 99-per cent range. The median is Q 21 = 0.22, iving an uncertainty range of \u00b168 per cent for reasonable values of n , T k ). Because of the sub-thermal behaviour, the [C I ](2\u20131) line is a ensitive indicator of density (Papadopoulos et al. 2022 ) and galaxies ith strong [C I ](2\u20131) emission will have a larger fraction of their H 2 n a dense state.\nPPENDI X E: F RO M PA IRW ISE VA R I A N C E S O I N D I V I D UA L VA R I A N C E S\ne have measurements of different tracers of gas mass for several alaxies, but no direct measurements of M H2 itself. Hence, it is not ossible to measure directly how well each tracer follows the gas ass. Ho we ver, we do have measurements of the different tracers for ach galaxy, so we can estimate the scatter in the difference between he tracers. Under some assumptions this allows us to infer the scatter etween each tracer and the gas mass.\nTo simplify the notation, we write the log of observed quantities nd corresponding standard deviation of errors as\nx 1 = log (L 850 ) , \u03c31 = log (1 + \u03c3850 / L 850 ) , x 2 = log (L \u2032 CO ) , \u03c32 = log (1 + \u03c3CO / L \u2032 CO ) , x 3 = log (L \u2032 C I ) , \u03c33 = log (1 + \u03c3C I / L \u2032 C I ) .\n(E1)\nf true value of the log of the gas mass is \u02c6 m = log ( M H2 ), and the true alues of the observed quantities are \u02c6 xi , where i = 1...3, then we can rite\n\u02c6 = \u02c6 xi + \u02c6 ai , (E2)\nperature for a range of densities, where lines are labelled with the values of\nsity user on 23 M ay 2023\nCross-calibration of global H 2 gas mass tracers 995\nw\na\na\na\nN d\ns\nm\nT\nw a t w\nv\nw\np g m t\nI g\nv\nI v\ns\nw e w U f c t r 0 T\ng i\nA C\nO i\n3\nl a\np m f f w w m\no e o\nP\nw v t\nP\nw a a t m o\nP\nH w e o a\nP\nP\nS l\n\u03c7\nT\nm\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023\nhere \u02c6 ai are the true calibration factors for each galaxy,\n\u02c6 1 = \u2212 log ( \u0302 \u03b1850 ) , \u02c6 2 = log ( \u0302 \u03b1CO ) , \u02c6 3 = log ( \u0302 \u03b1C I ) . (E3)\note that the true values \u02c6 ai may be different for each galaxy, epending on the individual physical conditions within the galaxies. If we choose a particular set calibration factors for all galaxies, ay \u02dc ai , this provides three estimates of the gas mass for each galaxy\ni = x i + \u02dc ai . (E4) he error in each mass estimate is\nm i \u2212 \u02c6 m = x i \u2212 \u02c6 xi + \u02dc ai \u2212 \u02c6 ai = \u03b4x i + \u03b4a i ,\n(E5)\nhere \u03b4a i is the difference between the true factor for this galaxy nd the value we have chosen, and \u03b4x i are the measurement errors of he observations. If we assume that the errors on x i are not correlated ith the errors on a i , then the variance of the mass errors is given by\nar ( m i \u2212 \u02c6 m ) = \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i , (E6) here s 2 i is the variance of the true calibration factors. The value of s 2 i gives a direct measure of how accurate the articular tracer is when using a universal calibration factor for all alaxies. Without knowing the true gas mass, we do not have a direct easure of this value, but we can obtain an estimate by considering he differences between the mass measurements\nm i \u2212 m j = x i \u2212 x j + \u02dc ai \u2212 \u02dc aj = \u03b4x i \u2212 \u03b4x j + \u03b4a i \u2212 \u03b4a j .\n(E7)\nf we ignore all co-variance terms, the variance of the differences is iven by\nij = var ( m i \u2212 m j ) = \u03c3 2 i + \u03c3 2 j + s 2 i + s 2 j . (E8) t is straightforward to re-arrange these equations to find the intrinsic ariance of the calibration factors as\n2 0 = ( v 01 \u2212 v 12 + v 20 ) / 2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 0 , (E9) ith similar equations for s 2 1 , and s 2 2 . So long as we have good stimates of the measurement errors, \u03c3 i , for the observed quantities, e can estimate the scatter in calibration constants for each tracer. sing our data set, we have measured the variance for each pair of actors in equation ( E8 ). Assuming that the co-variance between the alibration factors is zero, we use the three pair variances to estimate he intrinsic variance of the three individual calibration factors. The esulting standard deviations are s \u03ba = 0.1294, s \u03b1 = 0.1436, and s X = .1125, using all galaxies except the C I cor . 37 Values are listed in able 3 . This analysis shows that X C I has the smallest scatter between alaxies, especially when considering log L IR > 11 galaxies, which s a new result, independent of any assumptions.\nPPENDIX F: A BAYESIAN APPROACH TO O M B I N I N G G A S MASS ESTIMATES\nur method of combining the three gas mass tracers is based on the dea that the conversion factors for any particular galaxy come from\n7 When restricting the analysis to log L IR > 11 galaxies, C I produces notably ess scatter than both CO and dust continuum, with s \u03ba = 0.1339, s \u03b1 = 0.1646 nd s X = 0.082.\nw t e e v\narent distributions with variances as derived in Appendix E . This eans that we should allow for the expected scatter in conversion actors as well as the observational error when combining estimates rom the different tracers. Using a Bayesian approach to the problem, e show the most likely mass estimate is simply the inverse variance eighted mean of the tracers, where the weights include both easurement error and the variance in conversion factors. We continue to use the the notation as in Appendix E , where the bserved quantities are x i and errors \u03c3 i . Assuming the measurement rrors are Gaussian the probability of measuring the observed value f x i is\n( x i | \u0302 xi , \u03c3i ) = N ( x i | \u0302 xi , \u03c3 2 i ) , (F1) here N represents the normal distribution centred on \u02c6 xi and with ariance \u03c3 2 i . No w, for each observ ation we can use Bayes theorem o estimate the posterior probability that the gas mass is m\n( m, \u0302 ai | x i ) = P ( x i | m, \u0302 ai ) P ( \u0302 ai ) P ( m ) /P ( x i ) , (F2) here we have assumed m and \u02c6 ai are independent. For the prior on \u02c6 i , we assume a normal distribution with mean a\u0304 i and variance s 2 i , s discussed in Appendix E . We assume a flat prior on m , implying hat P ( m ) is constant. Since P ( x i ) is also constant, the position of the\naximum posterior probability does not depend on the actual value f P ( m )/ P ( x i ), and for convenience we set this to 1. Therefore\n( m, \u0302 ai | x i ) \u221d P ( x i | m, \u0302 ai ) P ( \u0302 ai ) = N ( x i | m \u2212 \u02c6 ai , \u03c3 2 i ) N ( \u0302 ai | \u0304a i , s 2 i ) = N ( \u0302 ai | m \u2212 x i , \u03c3 2 i ) N ( \u0302 ai | \u0304a i , s 2 i ) . (F3)\nere, we have used equation ( E2 ) to go from m \u2212 \u02c6 ai to m \u2212 x i . Since e are interested primarily in the value of the gas mass, and not\nxplicitly in the values of the calibration factors, we can marginalize v er the values of \u02c6 ai . Ignoring the uncertainties on the variances, \u03c3 2 i nd s 2 i , leads to\n( m | x i ) = N ( m | x i + a\u0304 i , \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i ) . (F4) Including all three observations for the galaxy this becomes ( m |{ x i } ) = 3 \u220f\ni= 1 N ( m | x i + a\u0304 i , \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i )\n\u221d exp ( \u2212 3 \u2211\ni= 1\n( m \u2212 x i \u2212 a\u0304 i ) 2 2( \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i )\n) . (F5)\no maximizing the posterior probability with respect to m is equi v aent to minimizing \u03c72 , where\n2 = 3 \u2211\ni= 1\n( m \u2212 x i \u2212 a\u0304 i ) 2 2( \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i ) . (F6)\nhe minimum with respect to m is given by opt = (\n3 \u2211 i= 1 x i + a\u0304 i \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i ) /( 3 \u2211 i= 1 1 \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i )\n= (\n3 \u2211 i= 1\n( x i + a\u0304 i ) w i ) /( 3 \u2211\ni= 1 w i\n) , (F7)\nhere w i = 1 / ( \u03c3 2 i + s 2 i ). So the optimal mass estimate is simply he inverse variance-weighted mean of the three estimates, where ach uses the mean conversion factor, and where the variance for ach measure is the sum of the measurement error and the expected ariance of the conversion factor.\nMNRAS 517, 962\u2013999 (2022)\n996 L.

(F9) The uncertainty on the factor a i depends on the uncertainty on m opt , rom equation ( F8 ), and the uncertainty on the measurement x i , from quation ( E1 ).

The filled histogram represents galaxies free from systematic uncertainties in C I fluxes for the J19 sample (the affected C I cor galaxies are shown as the line histogram). The median offsets are shown as the grey dotted lines on the histograms (calculated excluding the C I cor galaxies) and are very small (0.02, 0.006, 0.04 dex for Xa, Xd, ad, respecti vely). The of fset histograms have a maximum of 0.2 dex with an rms of 0.06\u20130.08 dex. The scatter plots show the robust galaxies as filled circles, with C I cor as open circles. The larger median offset for the daX\u2013ad comparison is apparent as a non-linear trend in the \u03baH values: for \u03baH ( daX ) < 2000, there is a persistent trend for the ad pair to return a higher \u03baH than the daX three-pair method. The offset is also present in the \u03b1CO parameter (top left-hand panels) but looks more like a constant offset in the calibration rather than a non-linearity. The C I cor galaxies (line histogram, open circles) are biased in the sense that the daX and one-pair methods produce very different values for the same parameters. The difference is smallest for the Xd sample because both daX and Xd are affected by the same corrections to the C I fluxes. The difference is more pronounced when comparing daX to ad or Xa, the reason being that the uncertain correction only affects the daX results (because the correction is between C I and dust continuum) while the ad and Xa samples do not have the C I \u2013dust continuum pair.\nH\nI m m t s t H a s f\n3\no r s e\nc t a s v a T d\nt\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/517/1/962/6651387 by C ardiff U niversity user on 23 M ay 2023 2 Impact of using fixed versus variable T mw n this section, we test a different approach to T mw , one of the ain physical dependencies that impacts on the calibration of gas asses. 38 To estimate gas mass from L 850 , the mass-weighted dust\nemperature, T mw , is required.

Similarly, we have hown that Q 10 is not easy to determine per galaxy, but its range is small nough to have no significant impact on our calibration study.\nt v a 0\nc A\nHaving determined empirical relationships between z, L IR , SED olour ( L IR / L 850 ), and T mw in Section 2.3.1 , we compare the calibraion results using these empirically determined T mw to the standard ssumption of constant T mw = 25 K made in the literature.

The important finding is that the trends in conversion factors with L IR disappear when a constant T mw is assumed.\nFigure H4.

The biases are quite pronounced when the range sampled by the data is not much larger than the errors on the data, but are significant even when the range sampled is \u223c10 \u03c3 . The biases also depend on which axis is chosen as the \u2018true\u2019 independent variable and whether the errors are asymmetrical ( \u03c3 x \u03c3 y , or \u03c3 x \u03c3 y ).
