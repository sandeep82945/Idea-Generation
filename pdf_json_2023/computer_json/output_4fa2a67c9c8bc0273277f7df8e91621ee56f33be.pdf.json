INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, as the rapid growth of China's transportation industry, urban rail transit has developed rapidly in large and medium-sized cities due to its advantages such as large passenger flow, fast speed, safety and stability, green environmental protection, and convenience [1]-[4].\nImproving the operating speed of urban rail trains has attracted the attention of relevant researchers from various countries. The well touch between the collector strip and the contact wire provides guarantee for the safe operation of urban rail trains. As the development of science and technology, the speed of urban rail trains has been continuously improved, the vibration both the collector strip and the contact wire is very severe, leading to a sharp increase in the number of offline pantograph-catenary, and frequent occurrence of pantograph-catenary arc in urban railway, seriously affecting the safe operation of urban railway trains [5]-[7]. The essence of urban rail pantograph-catenary arc actually is a gaseous discharge appearance. When the pantograph-catenary is offline, if the voltage between the pantograph-catenary is greater than the arc voltage between\nthe pantograph-catenary, it is going to penetrate the air gap of the pantograph-catenary and generate an arc between the pantograph-catenary [8]-[12]. When the arc occurs between the pantograph-catenary, a large amount of heat is generated, which will repeatedly act on the material surface of the pantograph-catenary system, severely wear the material of the pantograph-catenary system, affect flow quality of the pantograph-catenary system, shorten the service life of the pantograph-catenary system, and may lead to the breakage of the contact wire, leading to the operation accident of urban rail trains [13], [14]. Therefore, it is essential to study the urban railway pantograph-catenary arc temperature characteristics and distribution, understand the arc generation mechanism, master the influence factors on the arc temperature distribution rule, and provide data for extending the operation life of pantograph-catenary equipment, improving current collection quality, and reducing arc burning times [15]-[18].\nArc phenomenon is a process of coupling change of electromagnetic field, thermal field, flow field and other physical fields. An arc is more trouble to crush out than a\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Domestic and foreign scholars have carried out correlations studies on the arc of pantograph-catenary. Hu Yi [24] spectral diagnosis method and infrared camera are used to study the arc temperature of pantograph during pantograph descent. It is concluded that the surface temperature of the contact wire is higher than that of the collector strip, and the rising trend of the temperature of the collector strip and the contact wire slows down. Wang Junpeng [25] the electric data related to arc that it were collected through DC arc experiments, and the arc burning image of arc was taken by camera, and the related characteristics of arc were studied. It is concluded that the arc in the pantograph system is easy to be generated under the negative power supply. The larger the current between pantograph and catenary, the stronger the arc combustion will be. Reference [26] proposes a calculation model for the wear rate of the pantograph-catenary system, which can approximately predict the wear situation of the pantograph-catenary system, and verifies the calculation model through experiments. The predicted results are consistent with the actual wear, which may provide data reference for extending the operation life of the pantograph-catenary system. Reference [27] studied the position and time of arc root under different air pressure and gas flow rates. It can be concluded that the start time of arc and the existence time of arc root are obviously longer than normal under low pressure, which leads to more serious wear of pantograph-catenary system.\nBased on the previous research on pantograph-catenary arc, the pantograph-catenary arc in urban railway transit is studied in this paper. Firstly, the assumptions related to the physical characteristics of the urban railway pantograph-catenary arc simulation model are proposed, and a mathematical model with multiple physical field coupling is established. The COMSOL finite element software is used to solve the arc mathematical model, establish the urban rail pantograph-catenary arc simulation model, and output the arc temperature distribution cloud diagram. Collect the maximum arc temperature and arc duration data, and use the DC offline pantograph-catenary arc platform to obtain\npantograph-catenary arc test data. Based on the simulation and experimental data of the pantograph-catenary arc, a curve diagram of the maximum temperature and duration of the arc was drawn, and the feasibility of the simulation model was verified through comparative analysis. According to the simulation model, the surface temperature distribution of collector strip made of different materials under the affection of urban rail pantograph-catenary arc is studied."
