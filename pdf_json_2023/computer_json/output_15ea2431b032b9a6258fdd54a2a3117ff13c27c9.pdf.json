    "abstractText": "This paper studies the transmit energy beamforming in a multi-antenna wireless power transfer (WPT) system, in which an access point (AP) equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) sends radio signals to wirelessly charge multiple singleantenna energy receivers (ERs). Different from conventional energy beamforming designs that require the AP to acquire the channel state information (CSI) via training and feedback, we propose a new training-free energy beamforming approach assisted by wireless radar sensing, which is implemented based on the following two-stage protocol. In the first stage, the AP performs wireless radar sensing to estimate the path gain and angle parameters of the ERs for constructing the corresponding CSI. In the second stage, the AP implements the transmit energy beamforming based on the constructed CSI to efficiently charge these ERs in a fair manner. Under this setup, first, we jointly optimize the sensing beamformers and duration in the first stage to minimize the sensing duration, while ensuring a given accuracy threshold for parameters estimation subject to the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Next, we optimize the energy beamformers in the second stage to maximize the minimum harvested energy by all ERs. In this approach, the estimation accuracy threshold for the first stage is properly designed to balance the resource allocation between the two stages for optimizing the ultimate energy harvesting performance. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed training-free energy beamforming design performs close to the performance upper bound with perfect CSI, and outperforms the benchmark schemes without such joint optimization and that with isotropic transmission.",

INTRODUCTION\nFuture sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are expected to support massive Internet-of-things (IoT) devices to enable emerging applications such as smart home and smart city [1]. In practice, IoT devices are with small size, thus making the conventional battery-based energy supply unreliable. As a result, how to provide sustainable power supply for a large number of IoT devices in a cost-effective manner is becoming an important but challenging task for the success of IoT applications. Wireless power transfer (WPT) has emerged as a promising technology to resolve this issue for realizing sustainable zero-power IoT networks [2], in which base stations\nL. Qiu and J. Xu are the corresponding authors.\n(BSs) and access points (APs) can be utilized for wirelessly charging IoT devices as energy receivers (ERs).\nAmong various approaches, the multi-antenna transmit energy beamforming has been widely recognized as a promising WPT technique to enhance the energy transfer efficiency, in which multiple transmit antennas are deployed at the AP, such that the transmit signal beams can be steered towards the desired directions of the ERs. The implementation of energy beamforming highly relies on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the AP. Conventionally, there have been three approaches for the AP to acquire the forward-link CSI with the ERs based on channel training and feedback (e.g., [2]\u2013[4]). In the first approach, the ERs send pilots to the AP in the reverse link using the same frequency band as the forward link, and based on the pilots the AP can estimate the reverse-link channel, which is then utilized as the forwardlink CSI by exploiting the channel reciprocity [2]. In the second approach, the AP sends pilots in the forward link, based on which each ER estimates its associated CSI and then feeds it back to the AP after proper quantization and compression [3]. In the third approach, the AP adaptively adjusts its pilots over time in the forward link, and each ER measures the harvested energy levels over time and feeds them back to the AP, which then estimates the CSI based on the feedback energy measurements [4]. However, the above three conventional approaches require the ERs to perform baseband signal processing and/or active signal feedback transmission, which are energy-consuming and thus may seriously reduce the net harvested energy by the ERs. Therefore, it is of great importance to find new energy beamforming designs with light or even zero training/feedback.\nIntegrating wireless radar sensing in wireless networks has attracted growing interests in both academia and industry to enable integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) for 6G [5]. The radar sensing capability has shown its potential in facilitating the wireless communications. In particular, the BS and AP can use the radar sensing to estimate the channel parameters (e.g., angles) of communication users as sensing targets, and accordingly construct the communication CSI with reduced signaling overhead. For instance, the author in [6], [7] studied a radar-assisted predictive beamforming design for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, in\nar X\niv :2\n30 8.\n09 35\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.I T\n] 1\n8 A\nug 2\n02 3\nwhich the echo signals reflected by the vehicles are exploited to track and localize them for facilitating the information beamforming. Motivated by the success of ISAC and sensingassisted communications, we expect that the radar sensing can also be integrated into WPT systems as an effective solution to facilitate the transmit energy beamforming. In the literature, there has been prior work [8] studying the integration of WPT and ISAC in a multi-functional wireless systems, in which the transmit beamforming at the hybrid AP is optimized to balance the performance tradeoffs among powering, sensing, and communication. However, how to exploit radar sensing to enable zero- or light-training energy beamforming has not been well investigated.\nIn particular, this paper studies a sensing-assisted trainingfree energy beamforming approach in a multi-antenna WPT system, in which a multi-antenna AP equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) sends radio signals to wirelessly charge multiple single-antenna ERs. By assuming the line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the AP and all ERs, we propose to utilize the radar sensing at the AP to acquire the CSI of the ERs for implementing energy beamforming. Towards this end, we present a two-stage transmission protocol, in which the transmission block of interest is divided into two stages for radar sensing and energy transmission, respectively. In the first stage, the AP sends radar sensing signals and collects the echo signals from the ERs to estimate their path gain and angle parameters, which are then used for constructing the corresponding CSI. To achieve optimized target estimation performance in this stage, the AP properly designs the sensing beamforming based on the ERs\u2019 parameters that are a priori known from the estimation in the previous block. In the second stage, the AP implements the transmit energy beamforming based on the constructed CSI in the first stage, such that the wireless energy is fairly delivered to the multiple ERs. Under this setup, first, we jointly optimize the sensing beamformers and duration in the first stage to minimize the sensing duration, while ensuring a given accuracy threshold for parameters estimation subject to the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Next, we optimize the energy beamformers in the second stage to maximize the minimum harvested energy by all ERs. In the proposed design, the estimation accuracy threshold for the first stage should be properly designed to balance the resource allocation between the two stages for optimizing the ultimate energy harvesting performance. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed training-free energy beamforming design performs close to the performance upper bound with perfect CSI, and outperforms the benchmark schemes without such joint optimization and that with isotropic transmission.\nNotations: Matrices are denoted by bold uppercase letters, and vectors are represented by bold lowercase letters.

Consequently, based on the components of the CSI hk, the constructed CSI of ER k by using the estimated angle \u03b1\u0302k and path gain \u03b8\u0302k can be denoted as\nh\u0302k = \u221a |\u03b1\u0302k|\u03b2\u0303kej arg(\u03b1\u0304k) 2 at ( \u03b8\u0302k ) , (10)\nwhere \u03b2\u0303k = ( \u03c10\u03b2 \u22121 k ) 1 4 is a constant known to the AP. Correspondingly, the AP can utilize the constructed h\u0302k to optimize Rx for maximizing Pk(h\u0302k,Rx).\n1Notice that ER k exploits the rectifiers to convert the received RF signals into direct current (DC) signals for energy harvesting. Here, we consider the received RF power as the energy harvesting performance metric, as the harvested DC power is in general monotonically non-decreasing with respect to the received RF power."

            "text": "In this stage, we focus on the sensing task, aiming to estimate the angles and path gains of the ERs in the current block of interest. To optimize the target estimation performance, the AP designs the sensing duration \u03c4 and sample covariance matrix Sx based on the known angles and path gains estimated in the previous block. Our objective is to minimize the sensing duration while ensuring the estimation accuracy requirement, such that the minimum transmission energy is utilized for the first stage. In particular, we use the Crame\u0301r-Rao bound (CRB) as the performance metric for parameters estimation, which serves as a performance lower bound for any unbiased estimator.\nIn particular, the CRB matrix for estimating angles and path gains of the ERs is given as follows. First, the angles and path gains of all ERs to be estimated are denoted as \u03b8 = [\u03b81, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b8k, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b8K ]T and b = [\u03b11, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1k, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1K ]T .\nFor notational convenience, the receive signal in (6) is rearranged as\nY = ArBA T t X+ Z, (11)\nwhere Ar = [ar (\u03b81) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,ar (\u03b8K)], B = diag(b), and At = [at (\u03b81) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,at (\u03b8K)].\nThe Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to \u03b8, and the real and imaginary parts of b is given by [11]\nF = 2\n\u03c32r  Re (F11) Re (F12) \u2212 Im (F12)ReT (F12) Re (F22) \u2212 Im (F22) \u2212 ImT (F12) \u2212 ImT (F22) Re (F22)  , (12)\nwhere F11 = \u03c4 ( A\u0307Hr A\u0307r ) \u2299 ( BHAHt S \u2217 xAtB ) + \u03c4 ( A\u0307Hr Ar ) \u2299 ( BHAHt S \u2217 xA\u0307tB ) + \u03c4 ( AHr A\u0307r ) \u2299 ( BHA\u0307Ht S \u2217 xAtB ) +\n\u03c4 ( AHr Ar ) \u2299 ( BHA\u0307Ht S \u2217 xA\u0307tB ) , F12 = \u03c4 ( A\u0307Hr Ar ) \u2299(\nBHAHt S \u2217 xAt\n) + \u03c4 ( AHr Ar ) \u2299 ( BHA\u0307Ht S \u2217 xAt ) , F22 =\n\u03c4 ( AHr Ar ) \u2299 ( AHt S \u2217 xAt ) , A\u0307r = [ a\u0307r(\u03b81), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , a\u0307r(\u03b8K) ] ,\nand A\u0307t = [ a\u0307t(\u03b81), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , a\u0307t(\u03b8K) ] . The derivative of at(\u03b8k) is\na\u0307t(\u03b8k) =\n[ 0, j2\u03c0 d\u0303\n\u03bb a2 cos \u03b8k, . . . , j2\u03c0 (Nt \u2212 1)\nd\u0303 \u03bb aNt cos \u03b8k\n]T ,\n(13) where ai represents the i-th entry of at(\u03b8k). And the derivative of ar(\u03b8k) takes similar form to (13). Then, based on the\nFIM in (12), the corresponding CRB matrix is C = F\u22121. In particular, we adopt the trace of the CRB matrix C as the performance metric to be optimized, which has been shown to be a good design choice to lower the CRB of multiple targets [11]. Accordingly, the CRB for estimating parameters \u03b8 and b under a given duration \u03c4 and sample covariance matrix Sx is denoted as\nCRB (\u03c4,Sx,\u03b8,b) = tr (C) = tr ( F\u22121 ) . (14)\nNotice that the CRB in (14) depends on the parameters \u03b8 and b, which are generally unknown initially. In the following, we optimize the estimation performance based on the estimated \u03b8\u0304 = [ \u03b8\u03041, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b8\u0304k, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b8\u0304K ]T and b\u0304 = [\u03b1\u03041, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1\u0304k, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1\u0304K ]T\nin the previous block, and accordingly use CRB ( \u03c4,Sx, \u03b8\u0304, b\u0304 ) as an apprixmation of CRB (\u03c4,Sx,\u03b8,b).\nFurthermore, note that allocating more duration for sensing can ensure the estimation accuracy requirement, but it may also lead to a decrease in the available duration for energy beamforming in the second stage. Therefore, in the first stage, we aim to jointly optimize sensing duration \u03c4 and sample covariance matrix Sx to minimize sensing duration \u03c4 while ensuring the estimation accuracy characterized by the threshold \u0393, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. As such, the corresponding CRB constrained sensing duration minimization problem is formulated as\n(P1) : min \u03c4,Sx\u2ab00 \u03c4 (15a)\ns.t. \u03c4 \u2208 {Nt, . . . , T}, (15b) tr (Sx) \u2264 Pmax, (15c) CRB ( \u03c4,Sx, \u03b8\u0304, b\u0304 ) \u2264 \u0393. (15d)\nProblem (P1) is non-convex, as constraint (15d) is non-convex due to the coupling between \u03c4 and Sx. In the following, we present the optimal solution to problem (P1).\nFirst, it is noted that the optimal solution to (P1) is attained when constraint (15c) is met with strict equality, since otherwise the AP can further increase the transmit power to reduce the objective value while achieving the same CRB in (15d). Furthermore, as the objective value of (P1) is independent from Sx, the optimal solution of Sx in (P1) can be obtained by minimizing CRB ( \u03c4,Sx, \u03b8\u0304, b\u0304 ) under any given value of \u03c4 . As such, the optimal solution of Sx can be obtained by solving the following problem:\n(P2) : min Sx\u2ab00\nCRB ( \u03c4,Sx, \u03b8\u0304, b\u0304 ) (16a)\ns.t. tr (Sx) = Pmax. (16b)\nTo solve problem (P2), we introduce auxiliary variables {ti}3Ki=1. Then, the problem (P2) is reformulated as\n(P2.1) : min Sx\u2ab00,{ti}3Ki=1 3K\u2211 i=1 ti (17a)\ns.t. eTi F \u22121ei \u2264 ti,\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , 3K} (17b)\n(16b),\nwhere ei denotes the i-th column of identity matrix I3K . Further, the constraint in (17b) can be equivalently transformed into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with respect to Sx, i.e.,[\nF ei eTi ti\n] \u2ab0 0,\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , 3K}. (18)\nAccordingly, the problem (P2.1) is reformulated as\n(P2.2) : min Sx\u2ab00,{ti}3Ki=1 3K\u2211 i=1 ti\ns.t. (16b), and (18),\n(19)\nwhich is a semi-definite program (SDP) that can be optimally solved by convex solvers, such as CVX [12]. Let S\u22c6x denote the obtained optimal solution to problem (P2.2).\nNext, with S\u22c6x obtained, we find the optimal sensing duration \u03c4 by solving the following problem:\n(P3) : min \u03c4 \u03c4 (20a) s.t. CRB ( \u03c4,S\u22c6x, \u03b8\u0304, b\u0304 ) \u2264 \u0393, (20b)\n(15b). Recall that CRB ( \u03c4,Sx, \u03b8\u0304, b\u0304 ) is inversely proportional to \u03c4 . Therefore, the optimal solution of \u03c4 to (P3) is obtained as the minimum sensing duration \u03c4\u22c6 to ensure CRB threshold \u0393. Thus, the optimal solutions of S\u22c6x and \u03c4\n\u22c6 to problem (P1) are finally obtained."

Remark 1: Note that in our proposed design, the estimation accuracy threshold \u0393 is a key parameter that can be designed to balance the resource allocation between the two stages for maximizing the ultimate energy harvesting performance. In particular, by reducing the CRB threshold \u0393, the time duration allocated for radar sensing \u03c4 in the first stage should be increased to meet the more stringent estimation accuracy\nrequirement. This leads to more accurate channel estimation in the first stage, but results in less duration for energy transmission in the second stage. This phenomenon will be demonstrated in the numerical results in Section IV."

            "heading": "IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS",
            "text": "In this section, we present numerical results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed sensing-assisted energy beamforming design. In the simulation, the interval between adjacent antennas of the AP is half-wavelength. We set the noise power as \u03c32r = \u221250 dBm and the channel power at the reference distance as \u03c10 = \u221240 dB. We consider that there are K = 3 ERs in the system, in which their angles {\u03b8\u0304k} are given by 0\u25e6, 30\u25e6, and 60\u25e6, and the distances {d\u0304k} are 5 m, 8 m, and 10 m, respectively. The estimation error bounds are set as \u03d5 = 5\u25e6, D = 2 m, respectively. Furthermore, we assume that each transmission block consists of T = 200 symbol periods.\nFig. 3 shows the minimum average harvested power among the ERs (i.e., energy normalized by the block duration T ) versus the CRB threshold \u0393 for the first stage, where the maximum transmit power is set to be Pmax = 30 dBm and the numbers of transmit and receive antennas at the AP are set as Nt = Nr = 8. It is observed that there exists an optimal value of \u0393 that achieves the maximum minimum harvested power. When \u0393 is lower than this value, the minimum harvested power increases with the increase of \u0393. This is due to the fact that the AP needs to allocate less sensing duration in the first stage to ensure the sensing accuracy, which results in more remaining duration in the second stage to perform energy beamforming. When \u0393 further increases, the minimum harvested power is observed to decrease, as the estimated parameters of the ERs become less accurate in this case. This thus shows the trade-off between sensing accuracy and energy transmission, as shown in Remark 1.\nIn the following, we compare the performance of our proposed design with the following benchmark schemes. Note that in our proposed design, we set \u0393 as the optimized value to maximize the minimum harvested energy.\n\u2022 Perfect CSI: By considering that the CSI of {hk} is perfectly known a priori, the whole transmission block is allocated to the second stage for energy transmission, in which the energy beamforming R\u22c6x is obtained by solving\nproblem (P2). Then the minimum harvested power among all the ERs is min\nk\u2208K\n{ hH1 R \u22c6 xh1, . . . ,h H KR \u22c6 xhK } .\n\u2022 Isotropic transmission: The whole transmission block is used for energy transmission. In particular, the AP uses the identity transmit covariance matrix Rx = PmaxNt I. \u2022 Equal time allocation: The whole transmission block is divided into two stages with equal durations for radar sensing and energy transmission, in which the sensing and energy beamformers are designed based on those in Section III.\nFig. 4 shows the minimum average harvested power versus the maximum transmit power, where the numbers of transmit and receive antennas at the AP are set as Nt = Nr = 8. It is observed that our proposed design performs close to the performance upper bound with perfect CSI. This shows the effectiveness of our proposal. Furthermore, the proposed design is observed to outperform the isotropic transmission, thanks to the transmit energy beamforming design for steering energy towards desired directions. Additionally, the proposed design is observed to outperform the scheme with equal time allocation, as the transmission energy in the benchmark is wasted due to the lack of time allocation design.\nFig. 5 shows the performance versus the number of antennas at the AP, where the numbers of transmit antennas and receive antennas are the same (i.e., Nt = Nr = N ), and the maximum transmit power is set to be Pmax = 30 dBm. It is observed that the performance achieved by the proposed design, the scheme with perfect CSI, and the equal time allocation improves as N increases, while the performance of isotropic transmission remains unchanged. This is because in the first three schemes, energy beamforming can be steered towards the ERs. Furthermore, the proposed design is observed to significantly outperform the benchmark schemes with the isotropic transmission and the equal time allocation, which can be similarly explained as for Fig. 4."
