            "text": "Squaraine dyes possess outstanding optical properties such as a narrow absorption band in the red or NIR spectral region, a high (photo)chemical stability and a high uorescence quantum yield,1\u20134 and, thus, are suitable candidates for a number of optoelectronic5\u201310 and biomedical8,11\u201316 applications. However, only a few examples of chiral squaraines are known. In most cases, chirality of the dyes was achieved by attaching peripheral groups to the dye, namely cholesterol17,18 and proline,19 or chiral alkyl side chains.20,21 According to Snatzke, bringing a chiral centre closer to the chromophore leads to a more distinct electronic circular dichroism (ECD).22 For this reason, we recently investigated squaraines where the stereogenic centre is in close proximity to the chromophore. In that work, indolenine squaraine monomers with a chiral centre in the 3-position of the indolenine, containing either n-propyl or phenyl groups, were synthesised. Thereby, a signicant rise of the ECD effects as compared to monomers containing only chiral sidechains was observed.23\nWu\u0308rzburg, Am Hubland, Wu\u0308rzburg 97074, uerzburg.de versita\u0308t Wu\u0308rzburg, Theodor-Boveri-Weg,\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nIn this work, we focus on the synthesis and the chiroptical analysis of two axially chiral squaraine dimers and a merocyanine dimer with the aim to enhance their chiroptical properties beyond those of squaraine monomers with chiral substituents. According to Rosenfeld, the rotational strength R, which is the equivalent for the electric dipole strength of absorption spectroscopy, depends on the scalar product of the electric (m) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments24\nR \u00bc Im(m$m) \u00bc jmjjmjcos w (1)\nwhere w is the angle between the two vectors, which have to be non-orthogonal, otherwise the ECD effect vanishes. Integration of the ECD band yields an experimental access to the rotatory strength R as given in the ESI (eqn (S5)).\u2020 The anisotropy factor gabs is dened as the ratio of the ECD signal to the maximum absorption coefficient, which can also be derived as g\u2032abs from calculated data as given in eqn (2).

The rst term (Rmon) contains the sum of the local (one electron) rotational strengths of the individual monomers. Re\u2013m describes the electric\u2013magnetic coupling of m of the one with m of the other monomer and vice versa. The third term is the exciton term Rex, which depends on the cross product of the electric transition dipole moments and the distance vector between the centres of the monomers (r21). A chiral orientation of the monomers to each other is mandatory for this term not to be zero. Rex is believed to dominate the rotational strength and is the basis of the so-called exciton chirality method.24,26 This is particularly the case for axially chiral molecules and the reason why molecular dimers with this stereogenic element oen possess\nFig. 1 Target molecules: reference monomers (R)-mSQA, (R)-mSQB and dMC with (P)-configuration.

While the total magnitude of each term is identical for both exciton states, Re\u2013m and Rex possess opposite sign for the two transitions. This leads to the typical exciton couplet with a bisignate signal.\nIn the case of a chiral orientation between chromophores, the exciton chirality rule can be used to determine the absolute conguration by considering only Rex of eqn (3). Looking at the screw sense of the orientation of both electric transition moments m with respect to each other, a clockwise arrangement of the chromophores leads to a positive Cotton effect (CE), while a counter-clockwise arrangement is assigned to a negative CE.26\nMost axially chiral chromophore arrangements in the literature were derived from axially chiral 1,1-binaphthyl derivatives as the chiral scaffold in combination with a chromophore unit such as BODIPYs,27\u201330 phthalocyanines,31,32 pentacenes,33 phenylenes,34 triarylboranes,35 spirooxazines,36 methine dyes,37 perylene diimides38,39 or other perylene and pyrene dyes.40 An intriguing but seldom used approach is to connect two chromophores directly via a chiral axis, thus avoiding any chiral scaffold.41,42 In this case additional ortho-substituents next to the axis prevent rotation and therefore provide stability of the\n(R)-mMC, squaraine dimers dSQA and dSQB and merocyanine dimer\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

This chromophore dimer appears to be the only directly linked axially chiral cyanine-type chromophore mentioned in the literature so far. For this dimer, using a TDDFT-fragmentation method, a separation of the rotational strength into the contributing terms as in eqn (3) was achieved. Bruhn et al. showed that in their case, the rst and the second term are more dominant than Rex. Therefore, the absolute conguration could not be predicted by applying the excition chirality rule.46 The BODIPY dimers showed rather small gabs and glum values of 5 10\u22124 and 4 10\u22124 (a,a dimer) and of 1 10\u22122 and 4 10\u22123 cgs (b,b dimer).47 In a further example by Bringmann et al.,48 the synthesis of atropisomeric porphyrin dimers was achieved by an optimised Suzuki\u2013 Miyaura coupling procedure.\nHowever, axially chiral squaraine dyes have to the best of our knowledge not been synthesised and investigated yet despite their promising optical properties such as a very small absorption bandwidth. Thus, in this work we developed a novel strategy to use a stereogenic centre in the indoleninemoieties of a squaraine dye to induce axial chirality in a biphenyl-linked squaraine dimer. Therefore, two axially chiral indolenine squaraine dimers dSQA and dSQB (see Fig. 1) were synthesised and investigated in terms of their chiroptical properties. Here,\nFig. 2 Synthesis of (P)-dSQA, (P)-dSQB and (P)-dMC by Yamamoto cou\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthe biaryl axis connecting the two squaraine monomers was formed by a transition metal mediated reaction. The preferred position of the monomers with respect to the axis was directed by the phenyl group at the chiral centre in the 3-position of the indolenine moiety. The steric congestion makes one of the two possible diastereomeric biaryl conformers thermodynamically unfavourable. Thus, starting from an indolenine with an (R)congurated stereogenic centre leads to a (P)-conguration of the biphenyl axis in the squaraine dimer. To demonstrate the general applicability of this strategy to synthesise indolenine derived dye dimers, the same axial chiral bridging unit was used to synthesise the merocyanine dimer dMC. This merocyanine also possesses a signicantly broader absorption bandwidth than the squaraine dyes. For comparison, also reference monomers of all dimers were synthesised and investigated. The chiroptical properties of all chromophores were characterised by ECD and CPL spectroscopy. In order to analyse the individual terms Rmon, Re\u2212m and Rex, which contribute to the overall rotatory strength we performed time-dependent density functional calculations (TD-DFT) calculations."

This biaryl was synthesised by direct Ni mediated Yamamoto coupling of enantiopure (R)-oxindole 7 (e.e. > 99%) thereby creating a new stereogenic axis. The oxindole in turn was prepared analogously to a synthesis starting from (D)-serine hydrochloride (see ESI Section 7\u2020), originally developed by Richmond et al.,49 and used by us recently to prepare chiral squaraine monomers.23 Coupling of 7 to give compound 8was achieved inmoderate yield (42%) but excellent d.e. This type of atropo-diastereoselective synthesis appears to be a novel access to atropisomerically pure biaryl systems.44 The bis-oxindole 8 was treated with a methyl Grignard nucleophile followed by acidic elimination to generate the indolinium salt 9, which, because of its instability, was used in situ and condensed with the two semisquaraines 10 or 11 to produce (P)-dSQA and (P)-dSQB, respectively, in reasonable yield. The stereochemical purity was determined by analytic HPLC on a chiral phase to be over 99% d.e. and e.e. for both dimers. The chromatograms can be found in the ESI in Section 5.\u2020\nThe sketched synthetic pathway via the bis-oxindole has the advantage that this compound can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of diverse axially chiral dyes. As an example, atropisomerically pure merocyanine dimer (P)-dMC was also synthesised. Thus, the indolinium salt 9 was treated with thiobarbituric acid, which was extended to an enamine using triethyl orthoformate and aniline.50,51 A yield of 53% and a stereochemical purity of 99% e.e. were achieved for (P)-dMC.\nAnalytical HPLC on a chiral phase showed all dimers to be enantiomerically pure (see ESI Fig. S14\u2013S17, S21 and 22\u2020). Rotation around the stereogenic biaryl axis would allow to form two diastereomers. But although we could not nd any associated signal in the HPLC, this does not necessarilymean that the barrier between the two diastereomers is too high for an interconversion at room temperature since biaryls with only one ortho-substituent per aryl group are usually congurationally unstable.52 However, thermodynamics could shi a possible dynamic equilibrium completely to one side. In order to assess these issues, we performed DFT optimisations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory on the bis-oxindole 8, which also served as a model for all other\n12232 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12229\u201312238\nchromophore dimers.We optimised the two diastereomers as well as the transition state that interconverts these two structures (see Fig. 3). One diastereomer was found to possess a much higher energy (2396 cm\u22121 [28.7 kJmol\u22121]) than the other, which is caused by steric interactions of the two phenyl groups (see space lling model in Fig. 3). From the energy of the transition state (5288 cm\u22121 [63.3 kJ mol\u22121]) it is evident that the higher-energy diastereomer is not stable at room temperature and that the equilibrium will rapidly and completely shi to the side of the lower energy diastereomer.53 Thus, we conclude that the two stereogenic centers of the indolenine units afford diastereoselective control of the biaryl axis and that all chromophore dimers derived from bisoxindole 8 possess the same axially chirality."

For (P)-dMC the uorescence quantum yield (7%) is rather low as is that of the corresponding monomer (5%). The Stokes shi is rather small for all squaraines (<300 cm\u22121) and even vanishes for the dimers. The uorescence maximum of the merocyanine dimer is shied by 300 cm\u22121 with respect to the absorption spectrum. Considering the exciton lifetimes, the squaraine dimers (P)-dSQA and (P)-dSQB both show a biexponential decay with aminor short component of <1 ns and longer components of 1.4 and 3.1 ns, respectively. In comparison, the monomers decay monoexponentially but with similar lifetimes as the longer component of the dimers.23 For the merocyanines, the decay is monoexponential with 0.2 ns (dimer) and 0.1 ns (monomer). However, the lifetimes are signicantly reduced compared to those of other indolenine barbituric acid merocyanines, which explains the low uorescence quantum yield.54 From the quantum yield and the lifetime, the radiative rate constant was calculated and from that the squared uorescence transition moment m\n2 via the Strickler\u2013Berg equation (see ESI\u2020). The value of m\n2 of the dimers turns out to be signicantly smaller than that of the absorption, which indicates localisation of excitation in the relaxed excited state as observed in other excitonically coupled squaraine dimers recently.60"

            "text": "Electronic circular dichroism spectra were measured in toluene for all molecules but circular polarised luminescence was measured for the chromophore dimers only. For all dimers, the spectra are depicted in Fig. 4 and the data are summarised in Table 2. The monomer spectra and data can be found in the ESI in Fig. S6\u2013S8.\u2020 While all R-congurated monomers display a negative ECD signal at the position of the lowest energy absorption band with D3 on the order of 10 M\u22121 cm\u22121, all dye dimers exhibit a much stronger ECD couplet signal. For the (P)congurated dimers, the rst exciton state comes along with a positive signal, the second one with a negative signal with increasing wavenumber, that is, a positive Cotton effect. The ECD spectra of the enantiomers, the (M)-congurated dimers,\ncorrespondingly show a negative Cotton effect. From the peak maxima of the ECD couplet one can estimate the exciton coupling strength which is 417 cm\u22121 for dSQA, 334 cm\u22121 for dSQB and 418 cm\u22121 for dMC. The D3 value of the rst exciton state each is outstandingly high61 given the relatively small size of the chromophore dimers,41 with over 1400 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for the two squaraine dimers and ca. 1000 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for (P)-dMC.\nOne may ask why the D3 value of the merocyanine dimer is signicantly smaller than those of the squaraine dimers despite the same geometrical arrangement of the chromophores (see Fig. 4). Two reasonsmay account for this observation: the rst is the somewhat reduced dipole strength of the merocyanine and the second is the partial mutual cancelation of the negative and the positive ECD signal in the couplet because of the signicantly broader bands. Assuming mirror-image relationship of the emission spectra and the unknown absorption prole of the S1 state, the band width of the latter was estimated from the emission spectra and is given in Table 1. Thus, in order to produce large D3 values both a high dipole strength and a small band width compared to the exciton coupling interaction is mandatory.62\nThe ECD signals of the second exciton states are about half the intensity of the rst one, again, because of signicant overlap with the vibronic progression of the lower exciton state. Nevertheless, the shi of the maxima of the ECD signals almost correspond to the absorption maxima. Thus, despite the high D3 values, the anisotropy factors gabs are only in the region of 10\u22123 cgs, which is comparable to literature known axially chiral dyes.46,63 However, in comparison to the corresponding monomers (R)-mSQA, (R)-mSQB, and (R)-mMC, which exhibit only small negative ECD signals with anisotropy factors of 10\u22125 to 10\u22124 cgs (ref. 23) (ESI, Fig. S4\u2013S6\u2020), the strong inuence of the axial chirality becomes evident. The chiral axis leads to an intrinsic chirality of the chromophore, which leads to much higher ECD effects compared to a chromophore with only central chirality in close proximity.22 Following the exciton chirality method, the positive Cotton effects of all (P)-congurated molecules indicate a clockwise screw sense of the electronic transition dipole moments in the dimers. Since the electric transition dipole moment m of the monomers are polarised along the long axis (see below), this conrms the predicted (P)-conguration of the atropoisomers, which is generated by the repulsion of the phenyl groups attached to the indolenines.\nl strength, anisotropy factor, CPL maxima and anisotropy factor of CPL)\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

For (P)dSQB, the signal is at 13 600 cm\u22121, which makes it one of only a handful literature known organic NIR CPL emitters.64\u201366 The glum values are 5.3 10\u22123 cgs for (P)-dSQA, 1.5 10\u22123 cgs for (P)-dSQB, and 3.8 10\u22123 cgs for (P)-dMC. They are therefore similar to glum obtained for axially chiral PDI or BODIPY dimers.46,63 The larger glum compared to gabs in dSQA is probably caused by the relatively bad signal-to-noise (SN) ratio of the CPL spectra. Self-absorption is a common problem when recording emission spectra,67,68 especially for the squaraine dyes, which show a small or even negligible Stokes shi. Although the CPL spectra were corrected for this self-absorption, they nevertheless show a weak SN ratio. On the other hand, the CPL spectrum of the (P)-dMC \u2013 which displays a somewhat larger Stokes shi \u2013 thus shows a much better resolution and a better agreement of glum and gabs.\nTime-dependent density functional calculations\nThe structures of all chromophores were optimised at B3LYP/631G*. Using these structures, for all molecules time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed at the BHandHLYP/6-31G* level of theory because this functional yields slightly more accurate absorption spectra for indolenine squaraines.57 The corresponding calculated optical spectra were shied for each compound in order to agree with the experimental lowest energy transition. The ECD signal for the lowestenergy transition of the monomeric dyes (R)-mSQB and (R)mMC are negative in agreement with the experiment (see ESI Fig. S12 and S13\u2020). However, for (R)-mSQA we observed a small bisignate ECD signal. The TD-DFT calculations gave a small but positive ECD signal. However, the angle between the magnetic and electric transition dipole moment is close to 90 . Small changes of the angle thus can lead to a reversal of the sign. We\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nassume that the bisignate experimental ECD signal indeed stems from vibronic coupling, which may change this angle (Fig. 5).69\nFor the chromophore dimers we calculated the rotational strengths Rtheo for the ECD couplet and the underlying electric and magnetic transition dipole moments m and m, and the angle w between them, which are collected in Table 3. As expected, both ECD signals of the couplet possess about the same rotational strength. Comparison of the calculated rotational strength with the experimental value (see Table 2) shows that the former is almost three times higher. However, we have to take into account that the experimental rotational strength is a lower limit because the positive and negative ECD signal of the couplet with its nal bandwidth cancel each other to some extent. Likewise, when looking at the anisotropy factor gabs, the experimental values are around 1.5 10\u22123 to 5.3 10\u22123 cgs, whereas the calculated ones are between 4.8 10\u22123 cgs and 16 10\u22123 cgs. This overestimation may have three sources: (1) the calculated electric transition dipole moments are too high. For example, the electric transitionmoment of (R)-mSQA is 10.4 D while the computed one is 12.1 D. A similar difference is found for all chromophores in this work but it is not high enough to account for the enhancement of computed rotational strength. (2) The angle between the electric and magnetic transition moment is wrong. However, for the upper exciton state of the chromophore dimers, this angle is 180 by symmetry, but nevertheless, the calculated rotational strength is much too high for this state. (3) Thus, we are le with the possibility that the calculated magnetic transition moment is too high. In order to estimate the experimental magnetic transition dipole moment of the second exciton state of (P)-dSQA, we need the electric transition moment of this state. This, in turn, was estimated by subtracting the mirror image of the reduced uorescence spectrum (as an estimate of the spectral distribution of the rst exciton state) from the total exciton absorption spectrum. By area integration, this allowed us to estimate mS2\n2 \u00bc 85.0 D2 and mS1 2 \u00bc 137.5 D2.

Thus, it appears that our DFT computations systematically overestimate the magnetic transition moment.70\nIn order to analyse the three contributions to the rotatory strength of eqn (3) we used the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the two respective monomer units m1/m2 and m1/m2 of the dimer (see ESI Tables S5\u2013S10\u2020), and calculated the angles w1 between m1 and m1 (\u00bcm2,m2), w2 between m1 and m2 (\u00bcm2,m1), a between m1 and m2 and b between r21 and (m1 m2) Then, eqn (3) was used to calculate the contributing terms Rmon, Re\u2013m und Rex to the overall rotational strength Rsum. As the lower exciton state results from an antisymmetric combination of the vectors in all molecules, the negative signs were used for Re\u2013m and Rex (eqn (3)), and positive signs for the symmetric second exciton state. These values are summarised in Table 4.\nGenerally, the agreement of Rsum and Rtheo is excellent for all dimer chromophores, highlighting the correctness of exciton coupling theory in the present cases. Analysing the three contributions to the rotatory strength, it is obvious that in all cases Rmon does not play a signicant role, which is caused by the almost orthogonal orientation ofm andm. Therefore, the possibly wrong sign of Rmon (see above the discussion for (R)-mSQA) of (P)dSQA does not have any inuence. In all cases, the exciton term Rex is dominating the rotational strength. This is due to the large b(r21, (m1 m2) angle, which is between 110\u2013120 (see Table 4). However, the Re\u2013m term is signicant AND possesses the same sign as Rex. Thismeans that both terms add to the total rotational strength, which, thus, is enhanced compared to what was expected by the pure exciton chirality method. This is a consequence of the magnetic transition moments, which are almost perpendicular to the electric transition moment within one monomer.While this leads to an almost vanishing Rmon term it is\n12236 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12229\u201312238\nideal for the Re\u2013m term provided that the w2 (m1,m2) angle strongly deviates from orthogonality as is in the present cases. For an axially chiral BODIPY dimer, Bruhn et al. also observed that Rmon + Re\u2013m contributes signicantly to the rotatory strength, but in another case the sum of the two terms Rmon and Re\u2013m were even larger than Rex but possessed an opposite sign, which led to a reduction of total rotational strength and an unusual positive Cotton effect for the M-enantiomer.46\nThe good agreement of Rtheo and Rsum shows that the partitioning of R into the three components appears to be internally consistent for the DFT calculated rotatory strength. However, one should bear in mind that the DFT calculations overestimate m, which leads to too high Rmon and Re\u2013m values, while Rex is independent of m."

Thus, two C(3)-chiral phenyloxindoles were coupled by a Yamamoto-type reaction to give a dimer, where steric interactions of the attached phenyl groups led to a thermodynamically preferred conformational arrangement of themonomers with respect to the formed biaryl axis. The stereochemical conguration was retained in the axially chiral squaraine dimers that resulted from condensation of the oxindole dimer with two semisquaraines. The same oxindole dimer was also used for the synthesis of themerocyanine dimer (P)-dMC and is a potential precursor for other axially chiral dye dimers.\nIn the linear absorption spectra characteristic strong absorption bands were observed for the dimeric squaraine and merocyanine\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The chiroptical properties show signicant ECD effects in the region of the main absorption bands with a positive Cotton effect, highlighting the excitonic coupling in all cases. The (P)congurated compounds exhibit a positive rst and a negative second exciton state, and therefore a clockwise screw sense of the electric transition dipole moments according to the exciton chirality method. The ECD spectra of the (M)-congurated dimers are mirror images thereof. Relative to the molecular size, extremely high D3 values of up to 1447 M\u22121 cm\u22121 for (P)-dSQB were achieved for the squaraine dimers which is a consequence of the high dipole strength and the small absorption bandwidth in comparison to the excitonic splitting. However, because of the almost exact match of ECD/CPL peak position with absorption/uorescence signals, this leads to gabs around 10\n\u22123 cgs for all dimers, which is typical of chiral biaryls. From the recorded CPL spectra, glum in the same magnitude were determined. TD-DFT calculations of the rotational strengths and the derived gtheo are internally consistent but too high compared to the experimental values, which is caused by a computational overestimation of the magnetic transition moments. Using the Rosenfeld equation, the terms Rmon, Re\u2013m and Rex, which contribute to the total rotational strength, were calculated for (P)-dSQA, (P)-dSQB and (P)-dMC from the electric and magnetic transition dipolemoment of themonomeric subunits. As expected for axially chiral compounds, the exciton term Rex is the largest for all dimers. However, the mixed term Re\u2013m possess the same sign and also adds signicantly to the total rotational strength, which is due to a favourable arrangement of the monomeric subunits with respect to each other. This provides a strategy to enhance chiroptical properties of chromophore dimers beyond the exciton chirality interactions."
