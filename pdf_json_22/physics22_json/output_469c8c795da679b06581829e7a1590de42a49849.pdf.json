    "abstractText": "In a fully-controllable experiment platform for studying non-Markovian open quantum dynamics, we show that the non-Markovianity could be investigated from the global and local aspects. By mixing random unitary dynamics, we demonstrate non-Markovian and Markovian open quantum dynamics. From the global point of view, by tuning the base frequency we demonstrate the transition from the Markovianity to the non-Markovianity as measured by the quantum mutual information (QMI). In a Markovian open quantum process, the QMI decays monotonically, while it may rise temporarily in a non-Markovian process. However, under some circumstances, it is not sufficient to globally investigate the non-Markovianity of the open quantum dynamics. As an essential supplement, we further utilize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) flow to locally characterize the non-Markovianity in different channels. We demonstrate that the QMI in combination with the QFI flow are capable of measuring the non-Markovianity for a multi-channel open quantum dynamics.",

In a Markovian open quantum process, the QMI decays monotonically, while it may rise temporarily in a non-Markovian process. However, under some circumstances, it is not sufficient to globally investigate the non-Markovianity of the open quantum dynamics. As an essential supplement, we further utilize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) flow to locally characterize the non-Markovianity in different channels. We demonstrate that the QMI in combination with the QFI flow are capable of measuring the non-Markovianity for a multi-channel open quantum dynamics.\nnpj Quantum Information (2022) 8:22 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-022-00537-z"

            "text": "Quantum coherence and entanglement lie at the heart of important resources for quantum metrology and quantum information processing1,2. Due to interaction with the environment, any quantum system inevitably suffers from decoherence and quantum entanglement disappears at a finite time3,4. However, environment does not always play a harmful role and some interesting phenomena may rise in open quantum dynamics with structured baths. For example, in a spin bath, multidecoherence processes may be slower than single-decoherence processes when applied with appropriate pulse sequences5,6. In radical-pair mechanism for avian compass, the local magnetic environments compete against the homogeneous geomagnetic field to affect the yield of chemical reaction and thus effectively play the role of measuring instrument for the weak geomagnetic field7,8. Interestingly, the environment can assist efficient energy transfer toward the reaction center in natural photosynthesis9,10. In a non-Markovian environment, the quantum Zeno effect can be utilized to steer the state evolution and explore quantum entanglement to improve the precision of metrology11\u201314. Generally speaking, the dynamics of open quantum systems are described by the quantum master equation, in which the wellknown Markovian and Born approximations have been applied15. However, under some circumstances, the quantum dynamics can significantly deviate from that predicted by the Markovian quantum master equation, e.g., strong coupling to some vibrational modes in the bath16, or the system-bath couplings are comparable to the intra-system couplings17. Furthermore, the positivity may be violated in the reproduced quantum dynamics by the non-Markovian quantum master equation when some approximations are made in the deduction18\u201321. Therefore, it is necessary to exactly describe the open quantum dynamics for the whole parameter regime in a unified manner22, e.g., the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM)23.\nApart from the theories for simulation, many useful measures have been put forward to assess the non-Markovianity of the open quantum dynamics24\u201328. Because the Markovian open quantum process will erase the memory of the initial state, quantum systems which start from different initial states will result in the thermal equilibrium. The temporary rise in the trace distance between two initial states can be viewed as a signature of the nonMarkovianity29,30. Because local trace-conserving complete positive maps do not raise the entanglement, in Markovian processes the monotonic decay will be observed for the entanglement between the system and an ancillary system. Thus, the entanglement was also proposed for measuring the degree of non-Markovian behavior in open quantum dynamics31, e.g., in photosynthetic exciton energy transfer20,32. However, because the entanglement characterizes only the quantum correlation33, it may be more convincing to use the quantum mutual information (QMI), which is the total correlation including both quantum and classical correlation, to explore the nonMarkovianity34. Nevertheless, all the above measures only quantify the non-Markovianity from a global point of view. Since a many-body system can interact with the environments individually, it is quite natural to ask can we investigate the non-Markovianity from a different point of view, e.g., from different channels. The flow of the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which has been used to estimate the error bound of quantum metrology, was proposed to study the information exchange between the system and bath35. In Markovian processes, the QFI flow is unidirectional from the system to the bath, while it is bidirectional in non-Markovian processes. Especially, the QFI flows in different channels can be used to study the local information flows between the system and bath, which can not be explored with the global measures. On the other hand, it was suggested that mixing Markovian semigroups or unitary dynamics may result in the emergence of non-Markovianity by virtue of an ancillary system36. It might be interesting to experimentally engineer and mix unitary quantum dynamics to simulate a non-Markovian open quantum dynamics.\n1Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, 100084 Beijing, China. 2Department of Physics, Applied Optics Beijing Area Major Laboratory, Beijing Normal University, 100875 Beijing, China. 3School of Optoelectronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 400065 Chongqing, China. 4Faculty of Fundamental Science, Space Engineering University, 101400 Beijing, China. 5These authors contributed equally: Xin-Yu Chen, Na-Na Zhang, Wan-Ting He. \u2709email: aiqing@bnu.edu.cn; gllong@tsinghua.edu.cn\nwww.nature.com/npjqi\nPublished in partnership with The University of New South Wales\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () :,;\nIn order to experimentally investigate the non-Markovianity from both the global and local points of view, an experiment platform with both systematic and environmental parameters accurately tunable is required. Recently, we have theoretically developed and experimentally demonstrated an efficient quantum simulation approach, which can exactly simulate the open quantum dynamics for an arbitrary Hamiltonian and various types of spectral densities37\u201340. It effectively makes use of the bath-engineering technique41 and the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm42,43 to exponentially accelerate the exact simulation."

            "text": "Because by varying \u03c90 we can effectively tune the temporal behavior of \u03c7(t)41, in Fig. 2 we investigate the non-Markovianity vs the base frequency \u03c90. At a small \u03c90, e.g., \u03c90= 0.05 MHz in Fig. 2 (b), the time evolution of the norm of the off-diagonal term in the density matrix f(t) manifests a monotonic decay. The unidirectional information loss from the system to the bath is a signature of a Markovian process. By increasing \u03c90, f(t) turns to be oscillatory as shown in Fig. 2(c)\u2013(d). To explore the underlying physical mechanism, we investigate the time dependence of \u03c7(t) with respect to the change of the base frequency. When \u03c90 is sufficiently small, \u03c7(t) is quadratic with time. As \u03c90 increases, \u03c7(t) becomes linearly dependent on time. However, if we further enlarges \u03c90, \u03c7(t) will not be monotonically increasing with the time and thus results in temporal rise in f(t). Because the temporary rise in the off-diagonal term of the density matrix shows the information backflow from the bath to the system, both these two processes are not Markovian. Notice that the quantum dynamics in Fig. 2(c) is Markovian until tf= 5 \u03bcs, as f(t) decays monotonically in this period. Hereafter, up to tf= 5 \u03bcs, we explore the non-Markovianity by increasing \u03c90 as measured by the QMI, i.e., N 0 \u039b\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc R tf 0; ddtI > 0 d dt I \u03c1sa\u00f0 \u00dedt34, which accumulates the rising part of the QMI, I \u00bc S \u03c1s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe S \u03c1a\u00f0 \u00de S \u03c1sa\u00f0 \u00de with S\u00f0\u03c1\u00de \u00bc Tr\u00f0\u03c1log2\u03c1\u00de.

In Fig. 2(a), we also compare the QMI with the BLP29 and the RHP31. Interestingly, all three measures show a similar dependence on the \u03c90 and the phase transition in three cases accidentally occurs at \u03c90= 0.1 MHz. These observations are consistent with the theoretical discoveries in Ref. 45 that the three criteria for Markovianity may coincide in many cases, although they are different in general.\nQuantum fisher information In addition to the QMI, the QFI flow was proposed to observe the information exchange between the system and bath in different channels35. Recently, Lu et al. engineered multiple dissipative channels of an open system in diamond and used QFI to quantify its non-Markovian dynamics46. Here, we also use the QFI flow to analyze the local information exhange between the system and the bath in different channels. However, by virtue of bathengineering technique, we can effectively engineer individual channels from Markovian to non-Markovian in the simulated open quantum dynamics. We further show that by mixing unitary dynamics, we could obtain non-Markovian open quantum dynamics36. We consider a total system with two qubits, as shown\nin Fig. 1(b), where the system qubit 13C is the first channel and the auxiliary qubit H is the second channel35. By applying noise to different qubits, we can realize the information flow of different channels. When the noise is applied to the system and the auxiliary qubit, the corresponding channel 1 and channel 2 are opened respectively. When the noise is applied on both qubit, both channels are turned on. We also assume that the initial state is the maximum-entangled state, i.e., \u03a6sa\u00f00\u00dej i \u00bc \u00f0 00j isa \u00fe 11j isa\u00de= ffiffiffi 2 p .

By using the quantum simulation approach37,38, we again simulate the time evolution of density matrix \u03c1(t) and compare it to that by the HEOM. The HEOM has been widely used in studying open quantum systems23,48,49, as it faithfully reproduces accurate open quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of our quantum simulation method is significantly reduced as compared to that of the HEOM37,38. By straightforward calculation, we obtain the QFI Q(t) and then numerically fit the experimental data to attain the QFI flow F\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u2202tQ\u00f0t\u00de. First of all, we turn on the noise of the system qubit. The off-diagonal term of the density matrix f(t) decreases monotonically, cf. Fig. 3(a), and thus this channel is Markovian as the QFI flow is negative all the time in Fig. 3(g). Then, if we only switch on the noise of the auxiliary qubit, there are oscillations in f(t), cf. Fig. 3(b), which suggests positive QFI flow in Fig. 3(h) when f(t) is rising during the corresponding period. Finally, we examine the case when the noises are applied to both qubits. In Fig. 3(c, f), both of f(t) and the QFI decrease monotonically along with the time. The process is\nMarkovian since the QFI flow is always negative as shown in Fig. 3 (i). However, the summation of the QFI flows over two individual channels can be positive and thus F sa \u2260F s \u00fe F a, because the total noise can exert influence on all channels35. Therefore, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that it is inadequate to only use global measures such as entanglement and QMI to characterize the non-Markovianity of the open quantum dynamics. The local measures, e.g., the QFI flow, can subtly survey the nonMarkovianity inside the open quantum system."

            "text": "In the above investigations, a specific model in which the noise Hamiltonian commutes with the system Hamiltonian is utilized in order to obtain the analytical results. However, in practice the system-bath interaction generally do not commutate with the system Hamiltonian. To show the broad applicability of our proposal, we use a generic model in Ref. 10, where the environment assists efficient energy transfer in photosynthetic four-chromophore system. Since it has been shown in Refs. 37,38 that the NMR experiments faithfully reproduce the exact results of the HEOM simulation, here we compare the time evolution of QFI flows F ij\u00f0t\u00de and QMI N 0 by the quantum simulation and HEOM in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4(a), the QMI discontinuously rises and almost reaches the steady state around t= 18ms. The total QFI flow can be divided into the flows in different channels as F \u00bc Pi;jF ij \u00bc Pi;j\u03b3ijJ ij35, where J ij \u00bc Tr\u00f0\u03c1\u00bdL;Aij y\u00bdL;Aij \u00de with \u03c1 and L being the density matrix and the symmetric logarithmic derivative respectively, \u03b3ij is the decoherence rate associated with the jump operator Aij \u00bc \u03b5ij i \u03b5j\nin the Lindblad-form quantum master equation with \u03b5ij i being ith eigen state of HS, i.e., HS \u00bc P i\u03b5i \u03b5ij i \u03b5ih j.

In order to evaluate the QFI, we perform a unitary transformation U\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc exp\u00bd\u00f0\u03c3zs \u00fe \u03c3za\u00de\u03b8 on the initial state \u00f0 00j i \u00fe 11j i\u00de= ffiffiffi2p before the open quantum dynamics35, i.e., we adopt the same generator as in the second experiment. By varying \u03b8 with a small quantity d\u03b8, we could repeat the above procedure and obtain \u2202\u03b8\u03c1. Since [HS, HSB] \u2260 0, there are generally two kinds of channels for the QFI, i.e., the dephasing and dissipative channels. In Fig. 4(b), we only show the three dissipative channels responsible for the energy transfer between the nearest neighbours in the eigen basis, i.e., F j;j\u00fe1. Obviously, the QFI flows in the three channels are not equal. Because the coupling between 1j i ( 3j i) and 2j i ( 4j i) is larger than their siteenergy difference, the energy explores coherent relaxation to transfer between them10, and thus the F 34 (F 12) can be positive. Since 00j i 1j i ( \u03b54j i) is the state (eigen state) with the highest site energy (eigen energy), F 34 oscillates with the largest amplitude. On the contrary, since 11j i 4j i ( \u03b51j i) is the state (eigen state) with the lowest site energy (eigen energy), F 12 oscillates with a smaller amplitude. However, due to the smaller coupling between 2j i and 3j i with respect to their large energy gap, the energy transfer between them is incoherent and thus results in a lower rate. Therefore, F 23 is negative and its oscillation is negligibly small. Here, we show that although the QMI N 0 indicates that the open quantum dynamics in the photosynthetic light-harvesting is not Markovian, the QFI flows subtly reveal the local characteristics for different channels. In this paper, we apply a recently-developed experimental platform for the investigation on the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics. By tuning the base frequency, we can effectively change the open quantum dynamics from Markovianity to non-Markovianity. Furthermore, by turning on/off the noise on either qubit, we can observe the QFI flows from different\nchannels. As a generalization, we apply these two measures on the investigations of the open quantum dynamics of photosynthetic energy transfer. In addition to the global measures such as the QMI, the local measure, i.e., the QFI flows, can show the local information backflow, which clearly demonstrate nonMarkovianity from a local point of view. Notably, we have experimentally realized mixing-induced non-Markovianity with unitary dynamics. Here, the random fields \u03b2i(t) essentially play the role as the ancillary system, which exchange information with the system, and thus the mixing-induced non-Markovianity emerges36. To conclude, we demonstrate that the combination of the QMI and QFI flow are fully capable of characterizing a multichannel open quantum dynamics."

By averaging over the ensemble, we obtain the exact time evolution of the density matrix of the open quantum system predicted by the HEOM, if we assume the system Hamiltonians in the open quantum dynamics and quantum simulation are the same, and the spectral density and power spectral density are equal37,38. Physical speaking, the coherent and incoherent dynamics are determined by the system Hamiltonian and spectral density, respectively. As long as these two quantities are the same, the open quantum dynamics can be faithfully reproduced by the quantum simulation. Finally, the theoretical Hamiltonian HQS is decomposed into a series of experimentally feasible pulse sequences by the GRAPE algorithm. In this way, we can apply our quantum simulation approach for efficient simulating the exact open quantum dynamics."
