            "text": "When a high-power wave propagates in a plasma, nonlinear decay into a pair of daughter waves may occur, if the pump power exceeds a given threshold. The interaction is called parametric decay instability (PDI) and is ubiquitous in media\n\u2217 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed. a See Klinger et al 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/ab03a7) for the W7-X Team. with a second-order non-linearity, such as plasmas [1, 2], fluids [3, 4], and optical crystals [5]. In inhomogeneous media, if daughter waves are retained in a finite-size decay layer, an absolute PDI (APDI) can be excited, with temporal growth of the trapped waves\u2019 amplitude. In magnetized plasma, such a layer can be created by a non-monotonic density profile. This scenario is produced in ionospheric plasma by density depletion regions called striations [6]; APDI of upper hybrid waves (UHWs) propagating across the striation excites trapped UHWs and lower hybrid waves [7, 8].\n1741-4326/22/074003+6$33.00 1 \u00a9 EURATOM 2022 Printed in the UK\nSimilarly, in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, nonmonotonic density profiles are generated by magnetic islands and edge localized modes. In these cases, anomalous microwave signals observed in TEXTOR [9] and ASDEX Upgrade [10] tokamaks during second-harmonic extraordinary (X2) electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) were explained with APDI into a pair of trapped UHWs at half the pump frequency [11]. However, the wave trapping mechanism could not be assessed, since the decay region was poorly diagnosed.\nIn this letter, we present experimental evidence of PDI in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator [12] where ECRH beams cross a stationary magnetic island in the plasma edge. Highquality measurements of the density bump in the island support the possibility of localization of the primary UHWs and ion Bernstein waves (IBWs). We present a theoretical model that reproduces the power and the spectrum of the PDI-related signal and predicts a theoretical power threshold around 300 kW, comparable to the experimental observations. For the experiments under consideration, the developed model predicts 4% of the injected microwave power to be converted into daughter waves, exceeding 50% for density bumps more prominent than those measured. Such strong pump power absorption, between 40 and 80%, was experimentally observed in the linear device granite [13]. This would significantly reduce the efficiency of the microwave injection system, fundamental for plasma heating and current drive in fusion plasmas, and hamper the operation of microwave diagnostics [14]. At the same time, supra-thermal ion or electron populations [15, 16] can be generated by parametrically driven UHWs and IBWs. On the one hand, these waves can potentially be exploited as an auxiliary plasma heating mechanism. On the other hand, such supra-thermal electron populations in the plasma edge might damage plasma-facing probes. A better understanding of PDI and of the conditions needed to excite or prevent it, could thus be used to increase the heating efficiency and fusion gain in such experiments."

An incoming pump beam with frequency \u03c9+0 could decay into a trapped UHW, \u03c9 + 1 < \u03c90/2, and a back-scattered X-mode, \u03c9\u22122 , as shown in figure 2, where \u2018 + \u2019 and \u2018 \u2212 \u2019 refer to inward (decreasing x) and outward direction of propagation. Conservation of energy and momentum imply \u03c9+0 = \u03c9 + 1 + \u03c9 \u2212 2 , and k0 = qEm + kp where k0, qEm, and kp are wave-vectors of the pump, the trapped UHW, and back-scattered X-mode, while m is the eigenvalue of the resonant UHW.\nFor the pump X-mode wave, the cold dispersion relation reads\nk0 = \u03c90 c\n\u221a 1 \u2212\n\u03c92pe \u03c920 \u03c920 \u2212 \u03c92pe \u03c920 \u2212 \u03c92UH , (1)\nwhere k0 = |k0|, c is the speed of light in vacuum, \u03c9UH = (\u03c92ce + \u03c9 2 pe) 1/2 is the upper hybrid frequency,\u03c9ce = qB/me and\n\u03c9pe = (neq2/(\u03b50me))1/2 are the electron cyclotron and plasma frequency, \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity, and ne, me, q, are the electron density, mass, and electric charge, respectively. The same dispersion relation applies to the escaping X-mode daughter with (kp,\u03c92). For the trapped UHW, the dispersion relation is\nq\u00b1Em = 1 lT\n\u221a \u2212S\n2 \u2213 S 2\n\u221a 1 +\n4\u03c921 c2 (S2 \u2212 D2) S2 l2T, (2)\nwhere q\u00b1Em are the warm (+) and cold (\u2212) branches of the UH dispersion curve, l2T = 3\u03c9 2 pe\u03c9 2 cer 2 Le/([4\u03c9 2 ce \u2212 \u03c921][\u03c921 \u2212\n\u03c92ce]), with rLe = vTe/( \u221a\n2|\u03c9ce|) and vTe = (2Te/me)1/2 the electron Larmor radius and thermal velocity.

The value of m is found from the Bohr\u2013Sommerfeld quantization condition:\u222b xr\nxl\n|q+Em| \u2212 |q\u2212Em| dx = (2m + 1)\u03c0, (3)\n2\nwith xl and xr coordinates of the inversion points, where \u03c9UH(xr) = \u03c9UH(xl) = \u03c91.\nIn figure 1, resulting dispersion curves are plotted for electron temperature Te = 40 eV, ion temperature T i = 30 eV, and B = 2.23 T, values measured in the plasma edge in our experiments. The loop displayed by qEm confirms confinement of the mode around the density maximum. Build-up of primary UHWs in the cavity is saturated by the secondary decay into an UHW, \u03c9\u00b13 , and an IBW, f \u2213 4 = \u03c9 \u2213 4 /(2\u03c0) = 0.93 GHz propagating in opposite directions (see figure 2). Trapping of the secondary daughter waves within the density bump increases the strength of the nonlinear coupling, compared to mechanisms involving escaping waves [18].\nFinally, higher order plasma non-linearities leading to fourwave interactions, and particularly the combination of the scattered X-mode with the primary UHW and with IBWs, may excite high frequency modes at \u03c9\u22125 and \u03c9 \u2212 6 , as shown in figure 2, \u03c9\u22122 + \u03c9 + 1 + \u03c9 +,\u2212 4 = \u03c9 \u2212 5,6, (4)\nwhere the order of the subscripts on the right-hand side corresponds to the order of the superscripts on \u03c94.\nA more comprehensive description of the process must include diffraction losses along the poloidal direction, y\u0302, and along the magnetic field lines, z\u0302 (\u039b jy,z with j = 1, 3, 4), and wave damping due to electron\u2013ion collisions (\u03bd1,3,4). If a1, a3, and b4 are quantities proportional to the amplitude of the primary UHW, the secondary UHW, and the IBW respectively, the PDI-cascade is described by the following set of equations [19]:\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 \u2202a1 \u2202t \u2212 i\u039b1y \u22022a1 \u2202y2 \u2212 i\u039b1z \u22022a1 \u2202z2 = \u03b3p exp ( \u2212y 2 + z2 w2 ) a1 \u2212 \u03b3+\u2217s a+3 b\u22124 \u2212 \u03b3\u2212\u2217s a\u22123 b+4 \u2212 \u03bd1a1 \u2202a+3 \u2202t \u2212 i\u039b3y \u22022a+3 \u2202y2 \u2212 i\u039b3z \u22022a+3 \u2202z2 = \u03b3+s a1b \u2212\u2217 4 \u2212 \u03bd3a+3 \u2202b\u22124 \u2202t \u2212 i\u039b4y \u22022b\u22124 \u2202y2 \u2212 i\u039b4z \u22022b\u22124 \u2202z2 = \u03b3+s a1a +\u2217 3 \u2212 \u03bd4b\u22124 \u2202a\u22123 \u2202t + i\u039b3y \u22022a\u22123 \u2202y2 + i\u039b3z \u22022a\u22123 \u2202z2 = \u03b3\u2212s a1b +\u2217 4 \u2212 \u03bd3a\u22123\n\u2202b+4 \u2202t + i\u039b4y \u22022b+4 \u2202y2 + i\u039b4z \u22022b+4 \u2202z2 = \u03b3\u2212s a1a \u2212\u2217 3 \u2212 \u03bd4b+4\n(5) where w is the width of the pump beam, \u03b3p,s are the nonlinear coupling coefficients for the primary (subscript \u2018p\u2019) and secondary (\u2018s\u2019) decays, while asterisks denote complex conjugation.\nA solution of equation (5) is computed in a 2D box with dimensions along y\u0302 and z\u0302 equal to 2yB \u00d7 2zB much larger than the size of the pump using periodic boundary conditions following [19]. The time evolution of the daughter energy normalized to the thermal noise level, \u03b51,3(t) \u221d |a1,3(t)/ath1,3|2 and \u03b54(t) \u221d |b4(t)/bth4 |2, is shown in figure 3, where \u3008. . .\u3009 denotes averaging across the pump beam cross section. The black line displays the exponential growth of the primary UHWs after pump injection (t = 0 s), with saturation around t = 15 \u03bcs. Dashed and dashed-dotted lines depict the evolution of\nsecondary daughter waves for the case with inward and outward propagating IBWs, respectively. The predicted fraction of pump power absorbed by the daughter waves sums up to 4%.\nIn order to compute the power threshold, P0, for the primary instability, we put the instability growth rate \u03b3 = 0 [20]:\n\u03b3 = |\u03b3p| \u2212 \u03bdei(Te) \u2212 \u221a\n|\u03b3p| 2w2\n[ (2lz + 1) \u221a \u039b1z\n+ (2ly + 1) \u221a \u039b1y ] = 0, (6)\nwhere ly, lz are the thickness of the interaction region along y\u0302 and z\u0302. In the low-temperature regime considered here, collisional energy losses dominate over diffraction, \u03bdei(Te) \u039b1y,z/w\n2, hence equation (6) can be cast as \u03b3 \u2248 |\u03b3p| \u2212 \u03bdei(Te) = 0 where |\u03b3p| \u221d P0. For Te = 40 eV, the condition yields P0 \u2248 300 kW.\nFinally, we focus on the prediction of the spectral power density (SPD) for the peak at \u03c95. The amplitude of the signal collected by the receiver antenna can be expressed in terms of the spatial distribution of the third-order non-linear current density, jNL(\u03c95, r), produced by the combination of waves at \u03c91, \u03c92, and \u03c9 + 4 [20]:\nA(\u03c95) = 1 4\n\u222b jNL(\u03c95, r)E(\u03c95, r)dr, (7)\nwhere the integration is carried out over the whole plasma volume. Here, E(\u03c95, r) is the electric field of the beam on the receiver antenna operating as an emitting one at the opposite sign of the magnetic field and normalized to unit power. The power of the back-scattered signal can be computed as ps = |A(\u03c9)|2. Assuming a spectrum line width, \u0394\u03bd = 0.1 GHz, for the peak at \u03c95, the predicted SPD is given by ps/\u0394\u03bd = 2.1 MeV.\nHowever, the intensity of the peaks at \u03c95 and \u03c96 does not only depend on the amplitude of the daughter waves, which affects the power absorption. It also depends on the strength of the nonlinear coupling between combining waves and so\n3\ndoes not necessarily mirror the fraction of power absorbed by each channel. Since a stronger nonlinear combination is found for \u03c9+4 , the up-shifted sideband is expected to be weaker."

In W7-X, superconducting coils produce the nested magnetic flux surfaces and the chain of five magnetic islands outside the last closed flux surface [21], shown in figure 4.\nPlasma heating was accomplished via X2 ECRH with two 1 MW gyrotrons at f0 = 140 GHz and on-axis magnetic field strength B0 = 2.52 T. As shown in figure 4, the microwave beams are injected from the ECRH antennas on the right, intercept the equatorial-plane magnetic island, and are absorbed at the electron cyclotron resonance, shown in cyan.\nThe radiated microwave power is monitored with a highly sensitive radiometer with steerable line-of-sight, originally developed for collective Thomson scattering [22]. Gyrotron lines are blocked by notch filters and the signal is mixed down in two stages, and sampled using a PXIe-5186 digitizer, with sampling frequency f s = 6.25 GS/s. The SPD of the signal is computed from its Fourier transform, with time and frequency\nresolution \u03b4t = 0.6 \u03bcs and \u03b4 f = 1.53 MHz.

Before t = 1 s (start-up phase), the hydrogen plasma is sustained by gyrotrons A1, with PA1 \u223c 750 kW, and B1, modulated between PB1 \u223c 250 and 500 kW, while the line-integrated density [24] grows up to ne,LA = 3 \u00d7 1019 m\u22122 (see figure 5(a)). Probe measurements [25] of Te = 40 eV and T i = 30 eV at the plasma edge correspond to the values used in the model above, with B = 2.23 T at the centre of the island. At t = 1 s, PA1 drops to 500 kW, whereas six more gyrotrons are turned on for a total ECRH power of Ptot = 4 MW, inducing a steep rise of ne,LA.\nRadial density profiles across the magnetic island measured by the ABES [26] are shown in the figure 4 inset. The mean density during the start-up phase is shown by the lower solid curve, while the tallest profile shows the mean between t = 1.08\u20131.54 s. The grey-shaded area identifies the evanescent region for the primary extraordinary daughter wave, where PDI is inhibited.\n4\nThe spectra detected by the radiometer are shown in figure 5(b), with frequency shift from gyrotron A1, \u0394 f , on the y-axis. Thin lines around \u0394 f = 0 GHz are produced by the gyrotron stray radiation. Two symmetric sidebands appear above the electron cyclotron emission background from t \u2248 0.18 s and persist during the start-up phase. The frequency shift of the sidebands is comparable and grows from |\u0394 f | = 0.75 to 1 GHz, and the band width, \u0394\u03bdXP \u2248 0.1 GHz, is in both cases similar to the value assumed in the theoretical section. Conversely, the power distribution is asymmetric, with 5\u20137 MeV in the down-shifted signal, and \u223c1 MeV in the upshifted counterpart. We note that the main signal in figure 5(b) responds to the frequency and power of gyrotron A1. The fine structure of each sideband, shown in the top right corner of figure 5(b), reveals thin spectral lines separated by \u224835 MHz.\nIn order to assess an experimental power threshold, a power ramp from PA1 = 650 to 150 kW was performed in a different discharge with ne,LA \u223c 2.23 \u00d7 1019 m\u22122, an inward shifted magnetic configuration and plasma composition 50/50% H/He. The resulting intensity of the down-shifted sideband is plotted versus PA1 in figure 6. Orange points refer to the mean value (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of the signal in each power bin, respectively. Above PA1 \u2248 320 kW the signal mean value grows exponentially."

Experimental evidence of IBWs is provided by the spectral lines within each sideband, separated by the edge ion cyclotron frequency, f edgeIC \u2248 35 MHz. Furthermore, the dominant fraction of power is experimentally observed in the down-shifted component, in agreement with the evolution predicted in figure 3, and is consistent with the predicted SPD, ps/\u0394\u03bd.

Exponential growth of the instability was observed above the threshold, confirming the nonlinear power scaling of the process involved.\nPDI-related sidebands are excited only in the start-up phase, when the edge density profile lies below the evanescent region.\n5\nThis suggests inhibition of PDI when the primary X-mode daughters cannot propagate. However, a density peak above the evanescent region would trigger the two-plasmon decay instability where both daughter waves, at half pump frequency, are retained in the cavity. Here, the quicker growth of the trapped UHWs could substantially lower the instability power threshold.\nIt is also crucial to monitor the shape of the edge density profile in order to prevent a significant increase of pump power absorption by the daughter waves. Density profiles similar to the dashed curve in figure 4 would allow trapping of tertiary UHWs with frequency\u03c97 = \u03c93 \u2212 \u03c94 within the density bump and consequently reduce the power threshold for the decay of secondary UHWs (\u03c93) into a tertiary UHW and an IBW (\u03c94). In a similar scenario, where build-up of secondary UHWs is saturated, pump depletion seems to become the principal saturation mechanism for the primary process. As found by modifying equation (5) to include a tertiary decay, following [19], the fraction of pump power absorbed by the daughter waves in similar circumstances results above 50%. Edge profiles displaying a more hollow density bump could, thus, have a major impact in the overall plasma discharge."

            "text": "We have shown experimental evidence of PDI during X2 ECRH in W7-X and presented a model for PDI in the density bump measured with high-spatial resolution within the equatorial-plane magnetic island in the plasma edge. The density profile allows for trapping of a single primary and secondary UHWs and IBWs. The model reproduces the power and spectrum of the measured PDI signal, along with the observed power threshold P0 \u2248 300 kW. We predict the fraction of power absorbed by the daughter waves in the cascade, \u22484%, and predict scenarios where power absorption >50% could occur due to the onset of a tertiary instability. This would dramatically reduce the heating and current-drive efficiency of the microwave injection system in W7-X and in reactor-like environments like the ITER tokamak [27], additionally posing a serious hazard to the optimal operation of microwave-based diagnostics [14]."
