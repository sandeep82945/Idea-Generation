    "abstractText": "In this study, a new 3D porous PVDF-foam-imprinted membrane (PPIM) for the selective separation of artemisinin (ART) was first prepared via the dopamine adhesion of pre-synthesized MIPs into the interior of the PPIM. In the PPIM, the pre-synthesized molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with artesunate (ARU) as a dummy template were uniformly loaded on the interior of the membrane, avoiding the defects of recognition site encapsulation found in the conventional membrane. This membrane also exhibited excellent flux, which is beneficial in practical separation applications. The PPIM was systematically characterized via FT-IR, SEM, pore-size distribution analysis, water contact angle test, membrane flux, and mechanical performance analysis, respectively. In the static adsorption experiment, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model better fitted the rebinding data of ART. Under dynamic conditions, the ART adsorption capacity of the PPIM could be further remarkably improved by tailoring the flow rate to 3 mL min\u22121. In the selective separation experiment, with artemether (ARE) as the competition substrate, the selective separation ability (\u03b1) of the PPIM towards ART/artemether (ARE) reached its peak value (3.16) within only 10 min at this flow rate, which is higher than that of porous PVDF foam non-imprinted membranes (PPNM) (ca. 1.5), showing great separation efficiency in a short time. Moreover, the PPIM can be reused five times without a significant decrease in its adsorption capacities, showing good regeneration performance. This work highlights a simple strategy for constructing new MIMs with high flux and great mechanical strength to achieve the efficient selective separation of ART and ARE in practical applications.",

            "text": "Artemisinin (ART) is an effective and widely used drug for the treatment of malaria [1,2]. Among the ether derivatives of artemisinin, artemether (ARE) has the highest antimalarial activity\u2014six times that of artemisinin [3,4]. It also has the advantage of being fast-acting with low toxicity compared to artemisinin, has good oil solubility, which makes it easier to be converted into other biological agents, and has high therapeutic value. The intramuscular injection of artemether was once used as an important treatment for malaria. In existing synthesis technology, artesunate has always been obtained via the reduction of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin using sodium borohydride in methanol or ethanol as the solvent, finally followed by etherification [5]. Therefore, the artemether currently available in the market is often obtained via methylation using artemisinin as a raw material. However, in the synthesis process of preparing artemether from artemisinin as a reactant, there is always some unreacted artemisinin within the raw material, which leads to a decrease in artemether purity. The current application of artemether in pharmacology has certain safety impacts on human health [6]. Therefore, it is important to improve the purity of the artemether during the production process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7452. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28217452 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7452 2 of 15\nThe molecular imprinting technique (MIT) is a method used for the specific recognition of target molecules by simulating \u201cantigen\u201d and \u201cantibody\u201d interactions [7,8]. The main principle is to form a complex by pre-polymerizing a template molecule (target molecule, imprinted molecule) with a selected functional monomer molecule using various forces (covalent bonding, coordination, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic force, hydrophobic interaction, etc.), and then an appropriate amount of specific cross-linking agent is added to the complex mixture, forming a highly cross-linked polymer using an initiator light or thermal polymerization. Finally, the imprinted molecules are eluted from the polymer to form a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) [7\u201311]. This gives the polymer an amazing \u201cmemory\u201d function and a very selective adsorption ability towards the target molecule. Molecularly imprinted membrane technology [12] is a new crossover technology that combines the advantages of specificity and the high selectivity of MIT with the advantages of easy and continuous operation and mild conditions of membrane separation technology, and it is widely used in the fields of the separation and purification of substances, bionic sensors, and solid phase extraction [13,14]. The common preparation methods of molecularly imprinted membranes (MIMs) are mainly interfacial condensation, surface grafting, electrostatic spinning, and phase conversion techniques, among which phase conversion is the most commonly used method to prepare molecularly imprinted membranes. However, traditional molecularly imprinted membranes for phase conversion are prone to swelling and cause the encapsulation of imprinted sites in the recognition sites, resulting in decreased selectivity [15,16]. Moreover, MIMs generally have rather low membrane fluxes and large mass transfer resistance [17\u201319]. Therefore, it is important to explore new MIMs with high flux and high selectivity to solve the flux/perm-selectivity trade-off phenomenon for future industrial applications. Foam-type membranes with three-dimensional (3D) cross-network structures may provide an ideal membrane substrate that can provide sufficient space for MIP loading and high flux with abundant pores. Li constructed a PVDF frame (CoFe LDH(F)/PVDF) with the NH4F-assisted hydrothermal growth of CoFe LDH(F)/PVDF nanoarrays to achieve an ultra-fast decolorization effect in flowing dye wastewater with high flux [20]. As we know, the adhesive proteins of mussels contain unusually high concentrations of catechol and amine functional groups, which are capable of mediating adhesion to most organic and inorganic surfaces. Messersmith\u2019s group first reported that polydopamine (PDA) was able to mimic the adhesive proteins of mussels, and various surfaces were deposited with these bioinspired polymers simply via the oxidative polymerization of dopamine in alkaline conditions [21\u201323]. Inspired by this breakthrough, as well as several successful examples of using PDA in molecular imprinting [24,25], we intend to use PDA as a bridge to introduce the MIP particles to foam-type membranes to construct a 3D MIM with high flux. In this study, we introduced the synthesized MIPs into the interior of the foam PVDF membrane using dopamine adhesion to obtain a large-throughput foam PVDF/PDA-based imprinted membrane (PPIM) that avoids the defects of recognition site encapsulation. It is noteworthy to mention that the preparation of MIPs relied on the dummy template approach with its analog artesunate (ARU) as the real template. This choice was made because the ART molecule lacks active groups such as \u2013OH, \u2013COOH, and \u2013NH2 that can engage with the functional monomers. On the other hand, in consideration of the structure of ARU, like ART and the extra carboxyl as an effective active group, the ARU molecule was selected as the template molecule. The MIP was prepared via precipitation polymerization as follows: acrylamide (AM) was used as the functional monomer, artesunate (ARU) as the dummy template molecule, ethylene glycol di-methacrylate (EGDMA) as the crosslinker, and 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as the initiator. The preparation and characteristics of the PPIM and the non-imprinted membrane (PPNM) were investigated, and then the adsorption properties of the PPIM toward ART were explored. In addition to static adsorption, the PPIM can also be used as a dynamic adsorption membrane to evaluate the dynamic adsorption behavior and selectivity of the material.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7452 3 of 15\n1:8 resulted in large holes in the membrane due to the excessive number of NaCl particles added, which led to the membrane becoming too fragile. Therefore, the mass ratio of 1:7 was chosen as the optimal ratio of PVDF powder/sodium chloride particles for preparing the foam PVDF membrane."

After the synthesis, it was found that the PVDF membrane was easy to break when the mass ratios of PVDF powder/sodium chloride increased to 1:8, which is due to the excessive pores formed by the elution of sodium chloride. Although the foam PVDF membranes with mass ratios of 1:6 and 1:7 both showed good appearance, the insufficient addition of sodium chloride particles (1:6) directly led to fewer pores in the prepared foam PVDF membrane, which does not favor more MIP loading inside the membrane. On the contrary, the foam PVDF membrane with a ratio of 1:8 resulted in large holes in the membrane due to the excessive number of NaCl particles added, which led to the membrane becoming too fragile. Therefore, the mass ratio of 1:7 was chosen as the optimal ratio of PVDF powder/sodium chloride particles for preparing the foam PVDF membrane."

Briefly, certain amounts of AM as a functional monomer (0.0284 g) and ARU as a dummy template (0.0384 g) were dissolved in 10 mL of acetonitrile and stored at 5 \u25e6C for 4 h. Then, the cross-linker agent of EGDMA (0.396 g), AIBN as an initiator (0.015 g), and 50 mL of acetonitrile were added to the above mixture and were uniformly dissolved together via sonication and purged with N2 gas (for 10 min) to remove the dissolved oxygen. The reaction vessel was sealed and placed in a water bath oscillator at 65 \u25e6C and reacted for 16 h. After polymerization, in order to remove the template and also to form specific cavities, the resultant products were collected and refluxed with an extraction solvent of methanol/acetic acid (9:1, v/v) in a Soxhlet for 24 h. Then, the polymers were washed several times with double distilled water and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum drying oven at 50 \u25e6C for 24 h.

After that, the foam PVDF membrane was soaked in boiling water for 24 h to dissolve the NaCl using the sacrificial template.

Then, 0.1 g of \u201cTris\u201d buffer reagent was weighed into a 250 mL beaker, and then 100 mL of deionized water was added and the pH was adjusted to 8.5 using hydrochloric acid. Then, 0.2 g of dopamine hydrochloride, porous foam PVDF membrane, and 0.2 g of MIPs were added into the solution using sonication for 10 min. Then, the 250 mL beaker was stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 10 h.

In order to calculate the amount of MIPs adhered to the foam PVDF membrane, the foam PVDF/PDA membrane was obtained the same way, but in the absence of dummy MIPs. The difference between the mass of the PPIM and the foam PVDF/PDA membrane is the amount of MIPs in the adhesion process.

Then, the adsorption capacity was calculated using Equation (3).\n3.7.2. Crossflow Selective Separation Experiment\nSince the selectivity of the PPIM is very important for the separation and selective recognition of ART, we conducted selective experiments in a mixed solution of ART and ARE with similar structures. The process was as follows: the membrane (PPIM or PPNM) was fixed onto the support screen (12.56 cm\u22122 effective filtration area) of the low-pressure crossflow experimental equipment (Figure S1). Then, 150 mg L\u22121 ART ethanol feed solution was added to the material tank at a certain dynamic flow rate (3.0 mL min\u22121) at 25 \u25e6C under normal pressure. Samples were taken at different times (0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min), and the concentration of ART in the adsorption solution was detected using HPLC. The selectivity factor can be calculated using the following equation (Equation (4)):\n\u03b1 = (Cpt/Cft) (4)\nwhere Cpt and Cft represent the percentage mass of ART and ARE collected in the permeate and feed streams, respectively.\n3.7.3. Reusability Experiments\nThe recyclability of the membrane is also an important indicator reflecting its performance. In this experiment, the PPIM was subjected to five cycles of adsorption, desorption, and re-adsorption to explore the regeneration capacity. The specific operation was the same as the crossflow selective separation experiment, except that the membrane was desorbed when it reached the adsorption equilibrium and then recycled (methanol/acetic acid mixture 90:10, v/v)."

The preparation method is simple in operation, low in cost, and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the 3D-type foam PPIM possessed a relatively large flux, which is beneficial for industrial separation applications. In addition, the pseudo-second-order rate equation described the kinetic curve well. Moreover, the foam membrane can be used at least five times without significant weakening of the binding ability. Compared with non-imprinted foam (PPNM), imprinted foam (PPIM) has significant adsorption performance, whereas non-imprinted foam exhibits poor non-specific binding. The dynamic crossflow selective separation\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7452 14 of 15\nresearch showed that the selective separation ability (a) of the PPIM towards ART/ARE reached its peak value (3.16) within just 10 min, which suggests that the high flux of PPIM can increase the separation efficiency.
