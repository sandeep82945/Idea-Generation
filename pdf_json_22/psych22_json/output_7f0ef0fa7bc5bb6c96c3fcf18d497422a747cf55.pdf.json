Thus, the study examines the effect of work-life balance on the performance of employees in SMEs, along with the mediating role of job satisfaction and the moderating role of family-supportive supervisor behaviors. We have developed a conceptually mediated-moderated model for the nexus of work-life balance and job performance. We collected data from SMEs and employed SEM-PLS to test the research hypothesis and model. Empirical results demonstrate that work-life balance positively influences job satisfaction and performance. Our empirical findings also revealed that job satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between work-life balance and job performance. We also found that when FSSB interacts with work-life balance and job satisfaction, it moderates the relationship between work-life balance and job performance and job satisfaction and job performance. Hence, our findings provide exciting and valuable insights for research and practice.\nKeywords: work-life balance, job satisfaction, job performance, family-supportive supervisor behaviors, Indonesia\nINTRODUCTION\nThe importance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the global and national economies is worth mentioning, considering their role in creating employment and contributing to GDP. According to a World Bank (2020) survey on SMEs, the sector accounts for 90% of businesses and 50% of jobs globally. According to the report, this sector contributes more than 40% of GDP and creates 70% employment in developing economies. The SME sector is rapidly expanding in Indonesia, and around 63 million SMEs operate (Surya et al., 2021). Of those, 62 million are classified as medium-sized firms, and 0.75 million are classified as small businesses. SMEs are divided into four categories: household businesses with 1\u20135 workers; small and medium businesses with 6\u201319 workers; medium-sized companies with 20\u201329 workers; and large companies with more than 100 workers (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2020). More importantly, the sector contributes 61.07%\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 906876\nof the country\u2019s total GDP and provides 97% of the entire employment (ILO, 2019; Kementerian Koperasi dan UKM Republik Indonesia, 2019; Pramono et al., 2021).\nGiven the importance of SMEs in the economy, it is necessary to maintain and sustain the sector\u2019s human resource performance. A strand of the literature highlighted that firm-specific factors and the environment impact employee performance. Another strand of the literature highlighted that the performance of an employee could be influenced by cognitive factors, such as individual quality (Luthans et al., 2007), supervisor support, work-life balance (Talukder et al., 2018), cognitive abilities, personality (Kanfer and Kantrowitz, 2005), leadership, and family supportive supervisor behaviors (Walumbwa et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2015). Although all these factors are important determinants, the current study argues that work-life balance and family supportive supervisor behavior are more important than employees\u2019 involvement in every possible business activity of SMEs.\nIn the SME world, the working hours are different from those in larger firms. SMEs demand longer hours from employees. Therefore, it is difficult for employees to balance work and personal life. Some of the time, they also failed to maintain social and personal life due to high engagement and stress at work. The entanglements between work and family are a significant source of psychological discomfort for employees (Cegarra-Leiva et al., 2012; Lamane-Harim et al., 2021). This could lead to job dissatisfaction and poor job performance. Hence, the employee turnover and the intention to quit. On the other hand, Haar et al. (2014) stated that WLB has a positive impact on one\u2019s achievements, including performances. Similarly, increased job satisfaction impacts performance (Luthans et al., 2007; Walumbwa et al., 2010). Positive job satisfaction will increase employee capacity, which, if appropriately managed, will have a good impact on the employee\u2019s job performance (Luthans et al., 2007).\nHowever, in the competitive market, being a small team, the SMEs may not be able to afford to lose their skilled and knowledgeable employees as they are involved in product innovation and product sales. In order to facilitate work-life balance, SMEs indeed need to deploy the WLB\u2019s supportive culture. Lamane-Harim et al. (2021) suggest that practices or the introduction of WLBSC could influence job satisfaction and organizational commitment. These factors ultimately determine employee performance in SMEs and their sustainability (e.g., Cu\u00e9llar-Molina et al., 2018). In the practices of WLBSC, familysupportive supervisor behaviors could play an important role, as family-supportive supervisor behaviors are expected to influence outcomes related to one\u2019s performance (Wang et al., 2013). In previous studies, supportive family supervisor behaviors were associated with job satisfaction and job performance (Greenhaus et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Heras et al., 2021). Past studies also suggest the mediating role of work-life balance supportive culture in SMEs. However, since the work-life balance supportive culture is a contextual factor and a new introduction into the working environment, it is expected to increase or decrease the extent of the relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and job satisfaction and the relationship between work-life balance\n(WLB) and job performance. It also raises the question of how moderation affects the existing relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and job satisfaction and the relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and job performance. However, past studies have not investigated the moderating role of familysupportive supervisor behaviors (e.g., Greenhaus et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Heras et al., 2021; Lamane-Harim et al., 2021).\nPast studies on work-life balance have primarily focused on large firms. Several other studies have recommended more studies of this topic in SMEs (Lavoie, 2004; Cegarra-Leiva et al., 2012). Recently, Lamane-Harim et al. (2021) have researched work-life balance and WLBSC on Spanish SMEs. Furthermore, most research analyzing the relationships between WLBSC and employee outcome has been conducted in the United States. Moreover, national culture can also affect the intensity of the link between WLB practices and their effects on employee outcomes (Spector et al., 2007; Poelmans et al., 2005; CegarraLeiva et al., 2012; Lucia-Casademunt et al., 2015; Ollier-Malaterre and Foucreault, 2017; Putnik et al., 2020; Kelley et al., 2021). Thus, the current study fills the research gap by examining the moderating role of family-supportive supervisor behaviors on the relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and job satisfaction and the relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and job performance. To fulfill these objectives, a review of the literature is carried out. The research hypotheses are developed, which are examined in an empirical study with a sample of employees of Indonesian SMEs in an industrial sector. The implications arising from the investigation are given in the final part. Henceforth, the current study will be beneficial to the SME sector in Indonesia alongside the literature."

In an organizational behavior context, the social exchange theory is frequently used to explain the formation and maintenance of interpersonal relationships between employees and employers regarding reciprocation procedures (Chen et al., 2005; Rawshdeh et al., 2019). The theory explains why employees choose to be less or more engaged in their jobs (Lee and Veasna, 2013) and how the organizational support system influences subordinates\u2019 creativity (Amabile et al., 2004) and other positive behavior.\nPast studies have argued that when management provides benefits to employees, employees tend to feel indebted to the organization and make more substantial efforts to ensure its well-being and achieve its goal (Eisenberger et al., 2001; Vayre, 2019). Several studies found evidence in the work-life balance literature that when organizations or supervisors care about their employees\u2019 personal and professional well-being, employees tend to reciprocate by helping them achieve their goals through\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 906876\nimproved performance (Campo et al., 2021). Therefore, based on the social exchange theory, this study argues that when organizations take care of the balance between employees\u2019 personal and professional lives, employees\u2019 perceived positive feelings increase their job satisfaction, and they are more inclined to reciprocate the favor through high job performance (Talukder et al., 2018). In such circumstances, the supervisor\u2019s formal and informal support further increases employees\u2019 perceived positive feelings toward the job and strengthens the relationship between work-life balance, job satisfaction, and job performance. We present a conceptual model in Figure 1, which illustrates the expected causal relationship among study variables."

It is also defined as an individual\u2019s productivity compared to their coworkers on a variety of job-related behaviors and results (Babin and Boles, 1998; Aeknarajindawat and Jermsittiparsert, 2020). Performance is determined by the quality and quantity of work completed as part of an employee\u2019s assigned responsibilities. Employee performance directly influences an organization\u2019s financial and non-financial outcomes (Anitha, 2014). Thus, organizations need high-performing employees to achieve their corporate goals, vision, and mission and gain a competitive advantage (Thevanes and Mangaleswaran, 2018).\nA business must have a persistent competitive advantage in the SME context with many competitors to compete with other companies in the same industry. While job stress has been shown to have a significant negative impact on employee performance, work overload, lack of work-life balance, management style, and job insecurity are some of the factors that contribute to increased job stress (Naqvi et al., 2013). Since SMEs need employees to work longer hours, it is possible that SMEs\u2019 employees lack a healthy balance between work and family life, thereby impacting their\njob performance. Organizations are increasingly focusing on implementing a variety of HR practices and strategies, including work-life balance, on increasing employee job performance, as work-life balance is seen as one of the most important factors influencing job performance (Thevanes and Mangaleswaran, 2018). Previous research found ample evidence that work-life balance is essential to increasing employee job performance (Preena, 2021). Therefore, the role of work-life in influencing SME employees\u2019 job performance should be determined to ensure the industry\u2019s survival."

            "text": "Work-life balance refers to balancing one\u2019s professional work, family responsibilities, and other personal activities (Keelan, 2015; Kerdpitak and Jermsittiparsert, 2020). It refers to an employee\u2019s sense of a balance between work and personal life (Haar et al., 2014). It represents how people fulfill or should fulfill their business and personal obligations so that an overlapping situation is avoided (Konrad and Mangel, 2000). The changing work patterns and the pressing demand for domestic chores have had an adverse impact on people\u2019s work, social, and family lives (Barling and Macewen, 1992). Therefore, researchers suggested that the human resource management of an organization should develop effective policies such as adequate mentoring, support, flexible working hours, reducing workload, and many others that can reduce employees\u2019 work-life conflict (Cegarra-Leiva et al., 2012) and positively influence their satisfaction (Allen et al., 2020) and performance (Hughes and Bozionelos, 2007).\nWork-life balance is one of the most important issues that human resource management should address in organizations (Abdirahman et al., 2020). Regardless of their size, organizations should ensure that employees have adequate time to fulfill their family and work commitments (Abdirahman et al., 2020). A flexible working environment allows employees to balance\nFIGURE 1 | Conceptual research model.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 906876\npersonal and professional responsibilities (Redmond et al., 2006). Organizations that ignore the issue of work-life balance suffer from reduced productivity and employee performance (Naithani, 2010). Indeed, employees with a healthy work-life balance are generally grateful to their employers (Roberts, 2008). As a result, they put forth their best effort for the company as a gesture of gratitude, resulting in improved job performance (Ryan and Kossek, 2008). Thus, a high work-life balance employee could be highly productive and an excellent performer (French et al., 2020). Thus, based on these discussions and research findings, we developed the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Work-life balance has a positive effect on job performance.\nPrevious researchers have argued that satisfaction and success in family life can lead to success and satisfaction at work Victoria et al. (2019). Employees who are pleased with their personal and professional achievements are more likely to achieve the organizational goal (Dousin et al., 2019). While the work-life conflict has been shown to have a negative impact on employee job performance and satisfaction (Dousin et al., 2019), work-life balance has been found to improve employee satisfaction and job performance in various industries and countries (Mendis and Weerakkody, 2017; Thevanes and Mangaleswaran, 2018; Victoria et al., 2019; Obrenovic et al., 2020; Rini et al., 2020; Preena, 2021). It is documented that medical doctors\u2019 job satisfaction and performance are influenced by their perceptions of flexible working hours and supportive supervision (Dousin et al., 2019). Besides, there is ample empirical evidence that job satisfaction can positively influence employee job performance (Krishnan et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Abdirahman et al., 2020). Based on the above research findings, the following hypotheses have been developed:\nHypothesis 2: Work-life balance has a positive effect on job satisfaction.\nHypothesis 3: Job satisfaction has a positive influence on job performance\nJob satisfaction refers to the positive attitude felt by an employee toward the company where they work (Luthans et al., 2007; Tschopp et al., 2014). It combines cognitive and affective responses to the disparity between what an employee wants and what they get (Cranny et al., 1992). Previous research has often linked a person\u2019s job satisfaction with their behavior at work (Crede et al., 2007). It is argued that employees would be more committed to their jobs if they found them satisfying and enjoyable (Noah and Steve, 2012). Employee job satisfaction is influenced by an organization\u2019s commitment to work-life balance, and satisfied employees are more likely to invest their time and effort in the development of the organization (Dousin et al., 2019) in exchange for the support they received (Krishnan et al., 2018; Abdirahman et al., 2020). Previous research found that employee work-life balance increases employee job performance by positively influencing psychological well-being (Haider et al., 2017). Dousin et al.\n(2019) found that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between employee work-life balance and job performance in a medical context. Since work-life balance has been seen as an influencer of job satisfaction (Victoria et al., 2019) and job satisfaction influences employee job performance (Dormann and Zapf, 2001; Saari and Judge, 2004; Crede et al., 2007; Luthans et al., 2007; Tschopp et al., 2014; Krishnan et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Abdirahman et al., 2020). Thus, based on the above research findings, this study offers the following hypothesis:\nH4: Job satisfaction significantly mediates the relationship between work-life balance and job performance."

(2009) define family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) as the emotional, instrumental, role-modeling, and creative work-family management supportive behaviors that the supervisors provide to ensure employee effectiveness and satisfaction on and off the job. It refers to an employee\u2019s perception of their supervisor\u2019s positive attitude toward them (Clark et al., 2017). Supervisory support could be formal or informal (Achour et al., 2020). It is critical in developing flexible work arrangements (Suriana et al., 2021).\nSupervisory supportive behavior is very important for ensuring work-life balance and achieving organizational goals. It has been shown to reduce work-family spillover (Garc\u00eda-Cabrera et al., 2018) by increasing employee job satisfaction autonomy and reducing work pressure (Marescaux et al., 2020). The flexibility and independence generated by FSSB help to reduce work-family conflict (Greenhaus et al., 2012) by increasing employees\u2019 control over their work (Marescaux et al., 2020) and allowing them to strike a balance between their work and family life (Heras et al., 2021). Employees who believe their managers care about their personal and professional lives are more likely to improve their performance and meet supervisory objectives (Rofcanin et al., 2018). In a universitybased study, Achour et al. (2020) showed how supervisory support positively moderates the relationship between a female academic\u2019s work-family demands and perceived well-being. Kim et al.

The composite reliability can be used to assess the reliability of a variable\u2019s indicators. With its indicators, there is a latent loading factor value. The loading factor is the path coefficient that connects the latent variable to the indicator. If an indicator has a composite reliability value greater than 0.6, it can fulfill reliability requirements. Cronbach\u2019s alpha needs to be taken into account in the reliability test using the composite\nreliability approach. If a value has a Cronbach\u2019s alpha value better than 0.7, it is deemed to be consistent (Hair et al., 2014). Convergent validity testing reveals the average variance extracted value (AVE), which should be greater than 0.6 Hair et al. (2014). The discriminant validity test is carried out by examining the value of the cross-loading factor and the criterion of the heterotrait-monotrait correlation ratio (HTMT). The HTMT ratio should not exceed 0.85 (Henseler et al., 2015). Finally, the multi-collinearity test focuses on determining if there is a relationship between exogenous variables. The tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) values are used to analyze the extent of collinearity. A VIF value of less than 10 indicates the presence of a collinearity-free indicator. Multicollinearity is not an issue in our study as we used reflective measuring items.\nThe results of convergent validity and composite reliability are presented in Table 2. We have observed that Cronbach\u2019s alpha values for the construct lie between 0.820 and 0.907, which are above the cut-off value of 0.6, and all latent variables had Cronbach\u2019s alpha values above 0.7.

We also found that the HTMT ratio in Panel B of Table 3 between variables was less than 0.85. Henceforth, the Fornell-Lacker Criterion and HTMT ratio indicates the discriminant validity of the construct.

In contrast, employees with a healthy work-life balance have improved job performance (Roberts, 2008; Ryan and Kossek, 2008). In this regard, our findings demonstrate that the direct effect of work-life balance on job performance is significant with a coefficient of 0.152 (T-statistic of 3.007), suggesting a positive relationship between work-life balance and job performance. These empirical results also suggest that the employee\u2019s job performance will also increase with a higher work-life balance. The respondents in the study also commented on their readiness to be flexible at work when needed, and they underlined that they are not ready to sacrifice their personal lives for work. Thus, the empirical findings lend strong support to our hypothesis H1. Our results are in line with the social exchange theory that a balanced proportion of time\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 906876\nFIGURE 2 | Result of structural model.\ngiven by an employee to work-life and life-outside of work will make the employee more productive (Brough et al., 2008; Roberts, 2008; Ryan and Kossek, 2008; Hofmann and StokburgerSauer, 2017). In support of the WLB and performance nexus, French et al. (2020) and Haar et al. (2014) stated that a high work-life balance also makes individuals yield to their higher job performance. Therefore, SMEs need to create a work-life balance supportive culture in the organization in order to bring out employees\u2019 best performances, which could lead to better firm performance. The fact is that the entanglements between work and family are a significant source of psychological discomfort for employees (Cegarra-Leiva et al., 2012), which causes poor performance. Additionally, Lamane-Harim et al. (2021) suggested that WLB could lead to better employee outcomes in Spanish SMEs. As a result, both employees and employers must work together to foster a work-life balancesupportive culture in the organization, which is especially difficult in the SME sector.\nAccording to Victoria et al. (2019), satisfied and prosperous family life could lead to success and satisfaction at work. Therefore, the importance of work-life in employee job satisfaction is indicated in the literature (Dousin et al., 2019). Concerning that affirmation, this study\u2019s evidence demonstrates that the effect of work-life balance on job satisfaction is significant with a coefficient of 0.187 (with a T-statistic value of 2.95), which is indicative of a positive relationship between worklife balance and job satisfaction. This finding implies that with a higher work-life balance, the job satisfaction of employees will also increase. Henceforth, the current results are strongly supported by hypothesis H2. These findings are in line with Haar et al. (2014); Dousin et al. (2019), and many others. Their studies also found that work-life balance has a positive effect on job satisfaction; namely, the higher the work-life balance, the higher the job satisfaction of employees. Flexible working hours, given autonomy, and company policies that support the creation of a balance between work and personal life will lead to higher job satisfaction (French et al., 2020). Feeney and Stritch (2019) stated that family-friendly policies and a culture of family support are essential in generating a healthy work climate. Henceforth, job satisfaction will increase. Additionally, creating a family-supporting culture, flexible working hours, and autonomy could not be done in the SME industry as the working environment is different from that of large organizations. However, suppose SMEs take the initiative to create some sort of flexible working hours and give some autonomy depending on their position inside the company.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 906876\nIn that case, the employees could be more satisfied, especially if the primary intention is to increase employee productivity and performance. In support of this statement, our findings have found a positive influence of job satisfaction on job performance.\nJob satisfaction and job performance are widely studied relationships in HRM and organizational contexts. Most studies have discovered a positive relationship between job satisfaction and job performance (Dormann and Zapf, 2001; Saari and Judge, 2004; Crede et al., 2007; Luthans et al., 2007; Tschopp et al., 2014; Krishnan et al., 2018; Jermsittiparsert et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Abdirahman et al., 2020). As expected, in the current context of the study, we also found that the effect of job satisfaction on job performance is significant, with a coefficient of 0.401 (with a T-statistic value of 7.761). Hence, the current empirical findings lend strong support to H3 that job satisfaction will increase job performance. Therefore, in line with the extant studies, we also argue that SMEs should attempt to keep employees satisfied with their jobs so they can generate their best performance. The organizational theory suggests that perceived job satisfaction makes employees more committed toward their jobs, hence better output. In the SME case, work\u2013life balance and a supportive culture could play an important role in making employees more committed and satisfied, which will increase job performance. Our hypothesis rectifies this assertation that H3 work-life balance has positive effects on job satisfaction.\nIn their study, Haider et al. (2017) have discussed how work-life balance increases employee job performance via influencing psychological well-being. Job satisfaction is one of the main components of psychological well-being at the workplace. Therefore, on the mediating role of job satisfaction, our findings demonstrate that the relationship between work-life balance and job performance is mediated by job satisfaction (with a coefficient of 0.075 and a T-statistic value of 2.64). Since there is a direct relationship between work-life balance and job performance, it can be concluded that the mediation is a partial mediation\nrather than a full one. Thus, our hypothesis H4 is accepted. The current empirical findings also support the past empirical studies, as Dousin et al. (2019) found the mediation role of job satisfaction between employee work-life balance and job performance in a medical context. Hence, our findings imply that work-life balance improves job performance by increasing job satisfaction.\nFamily supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) in the organization are about work-family spillover (Garc\u00eda-Cabrera et al., 2018) by boosting employee job satisfaction autonomy and minimizing work pressure (Marescaux et al., 2020). Hence, it has been able to increase job satisfaction and performance. In this regard, although we do not hypothesize the direct effect of family-supportive supervisor behaviors, our findings confirm that FSSB positively influences job satisfaction and performance. Therefore, the existence of FSSB is essential to improve employees\u2019 job satisfaction and job performance. Hence, these findings agree with the past studies that present a positive influence of FSSB on job satisfaction and job performance (Rofcanin et al., 2018; Talukder et al., 2018; Campo et al., 2021). Henceforth, these findings confirm the assertion of social exchange theory and organizational support theory that supervisors\u2019 formal and informal support further increase employees\u2019 attitude toward the job, which improves job satisfaction and job performance (Talukder et al., 2018).\nFurthermore, our empirical results indicate that the interaction between FSSB and work-life balance positively affects job performance (with a coefficient of 0.235 and a t-statistic of 5.04). These findings suggest that when FSSB interacts with work-life balance, it attenuates the link between work-life balance and job satisfaction and job performance. As a result, the current findings provide significant support for our hypothesis H5. Kim et al. (2017) discovered that supervisory support could increase the link between deep acting and work performance. On the other hand, Alias (2021) suggest that supervisory support cannot moderate the relationship between flexible work arrangements and employee performance. Our findings, however, offer evidence that contradicts the assertion of Alias (2021), in which we demonstrated that there could be moderating effects on the relationship between work-life balance and job performance. Hence, our finding adds novel evidence in the area of work-life balance and job performance. Again, these findings reinforce the need for a work\u2013life balance supportive culture in the organization, as it could facilitate supervisory actions to a certain degree in supporting employees\u2019 family and personal life.\nBased on hypothesis H5, we concurred on the moderating impact of FSSB on the link between job satisfaction and job performance. We evaluated the moderating influence of FSSB on this relationship. The current study\u2019s empirical findings indicate that the interaction effects of FSSB and work satisfaction on job performance are relatively positive (with a coefficient of 0.206 and a t-statistic of 3.25). These findings suggest that when FSSB interacts with work-life balance and job satisfaction, it moderates the link between work-life balance and job satisfaction and job performance. Hence, the current empirical results verify our claim and offer substantial support for Hypothesis H6.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 906876\nThe interaction effects are reasonably sensible in that when employees are satisfied and believe that they will receive the required support from their boss while coping with family or personal concerns. As a result, when the level of belief and job satisfaction rises, so does the level of job commitment and engagement, resulting in higher job performance. In this regard, the current study contributes to the body of evidence on the FSSB\u2019s moderating effects on job satisfaction and performance.\nPractical Implications In support of the WLB-performance nexus, several studies have indicated that an excellent work balance also leads to more extraordinary job performance. Thus, SMEs must foster a work\u2013life balance-friendly culture to bring out the best in their employees, which may contribute to improved business/firm performance. In reality, the entanglements between work and family are a major source of psychological distress for employees, resulting in poor performance. Henceforth, the implementation of various WLB practices is suggested for Indonesian SMEs, particularly those not required by regulation or legal minimum to fulfill the needs of all employees. Furthermore, we also recommend that firms should provide separate WLB practice alternatives for men and women because the impacts of WLB on job satisfaction are varied, as suggested by Lamane-Harim et al. (2021). Furthermore, family-supportive supervisor behaviors are important for promoting employees\u2019 performance. Therefore, firms and supervisors provide some support to employees to handle and overcome family-related issues. In this regard, our findings emphasized the need to establish a work\u2013life balance supportive culture in the firm as it might assist supervisory activities in supporting workers\u2019 family and personal life to a different extent. In addition,\nmanagers may gain useful knowledge to create efficient job systems to improve job performance in SMEs, taking into account the relevance of work-life balance, family supportive supervisor behaviors, and job satisfaction. Individuals in SMEs can increase job performance by balancing their work and personal life. The impact of SMEs on employee work-life balance and performance is a fascinating topic. As a result, work-life balance will have a bigger impact on the organization\u2019s overall performance."

However, the findings may not be generalizable, and the results must be interpreted in light of the evolving context and economic conditions in which the study was done. Additionally, future studies should look into religiosity as a moderator of the relationship between WLB and job satisfaction and performance. It\u2019s important to think about becoming a moderator since employees who have a strong understanding of religion and put it into practice have a good sense of self-control. It could have a different effect when attempting to explain the link between work-life balance and job performance. Stress and anxiety are one of the most essential factors to consider when attempting to explain the link between WLB and job performance. Many employees may feel stressed and anxious about their professional and personal development while working in SMEs. As a result, as moderators in this association, it may be an important aspect to investigate in future research.
