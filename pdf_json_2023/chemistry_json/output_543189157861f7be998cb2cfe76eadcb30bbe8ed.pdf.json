    "abstractText": "Methods: The hepatoprotective effect of CR against cholestasis liver injury induced by \u03b1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) was evaluated in rats. The serum biochemical indices, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bile acid (TBA), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), as well as the liver oxidative stress indexes and the pathological characteristics of the liver were analyzed. In addition, we also performed a serum metabolomics study using UPLC-Q Exactive HF-X technology to investigate the effect of CR on the serum of rats with ANIT-induced IC and screened potential biomarkers. The enrichment analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by transcriptomics. Finally, the regulatory targets of CR on potential biomarkers were obtained by combined analysis, and the relevant key targets were verified by western blotting.",

Crocin I (CR) is effective in the treatment of IC, but its underlying mechanisms need to be further explored. We aimed to reveal the therapeutic mechanism of crocin I for IC by combining an integrated strategy of metabolomics and transcriptomics.\nMethods: The hepatoprotective effect of CR against cholestasis liver injury induced by \u03b1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) was evaluated in rats. The serum biochemical indices, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bile acid (TBA), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), as well as the liver oxidative stress indexes and the pathological characteristics of the liver were analyzed. In addition, we also performed a serum metabolomics study using UPLC-Q Exactive HF-X technology to investigate the effect of CR on the serum of rats with ANIT-induced IC and screened potential biomarkers. The enrichment analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by transcriptomics. Finally, the regulatory targets of CR on potential biomarkers were obtained by combined analysis, and the relevant key targets were verified by western blotting.\nResults: CR improved serum and liver homogenate indexes and alleviated liver histological injury. Compared with ANIT group, the CR group had 76 differential metabolites, and 10 metabolic pathways were enriched. There were 473 DEGs significantly changed after CR treatment, most of which were enriched in the retinol metabolism, calcium signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, circadian rhythm, chemokine signaling pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, bile secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and other pathways. By constructing the \u201ccompoundreaction-enzyme-gene\u201d interaction network, three potential key-target regulation biomarkers were obtained, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), ATP-binding cassette transporter G5 (ABCG5), and sulfotransferase2A1(SULT2A1), which were further verified by western blotting. Compared with the ANIT group, the CR group significantly increased the expression of ABCG5 and SULT2A1, and the expression of HMGCR significantly decreased.\nConclusion: Combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses show that CR has a therapeutic effect on IC through regulation of the biosynthesis of bile acids and bilirubin in the bile secretion pathway and regulation of the expression of HMGCR, ABCG5, and SULT2A1."

            "text": "A common type of liver disease, intrahepatic cholestasis (IC) is a primary hepatocellular disease. Bile formation and blood flow are blocked due to damage to hepatocytes and bile duct cells. In particular, bile acids are trapped, and bile components such as cholesterol and bilirubin continue to accumulate (Yang et al., 2018). Disturbances in bile acid metabolism and inflammation are common features of IC, with clinical symptoms of jaundice, itchy skin, darkened urine, and physical frailty. If the cholestatic state is not effectively treated, it will develop into liver fibrosis, and even liver cirrhosis (Zhang et al., 2022). Ursodeoxycholic acid, obeticholic acid, S-adenosylmethionine, and other drugs are often used for the clinical treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis. However, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid will cause intolerance in patients. Obecholic acid can produce side effects such as itching (Samant et al., 2019; Fujita et al., 2021). Therefore, the search for an effective drug with few side effects to treat IC is an important topic. Chinese medicines and their monomers have the advantage of being widely applied and have few side effects. Terpenoids have various anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrosis pharmacological activities that can effectively alleviate IC, and terpenoids are expected to become new drugs for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease (Ji et al., 2022).\nCrocin I (CR), as a diterpenoid, is the main active component of saffron (Figure 1). In recent years, many studies have shown that CR has hepatoprotection (Lari et al., 2015), antitumor (Tang et al., 2022), anticardiovascular disease (Motlagh et al., 2021), anti-inflammatory (Teng et al., 2021), and hypoglycemic (Qiu et al., 2020) effects. In addition, it has less toxicity and fewer side effects, and its medical value\nhas received increasing attention. However, the mechanism of how CR alleviates IC is still unclear. Combining the relevant gene expression information provided by transcriptomics with the statistical information of metabolomics data variables is a reliable method of studying the material basis and mechanism of action of the pharmacological effects of Chinese medicine monomers. Currently, integrating the two techniques to explore the mechanism of CR in the treatment of IC remains a void.\nMetabolomics is an important part of systems biology. By revealing the metabolic trends and laws of the body under the influence of internal and external factors, metabolomics can qualitatively and quantitatively determine the dynamic changes of metabolites in the living system caused by pathological, physiological stimulation, or genetic modification (Alarcon-Barrera et al., 2022). The mechanism of how CR protects the liver can be elucidated through metabolomics. Genes are closely related to changes in metabolites, so transcriptomics is used to explain changes in gene expression after drug administration. In addition, combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis can reveal phenotyperelated metabolic pathways and gene functions through the identified metabolites and differential genes to further gain potential therapeutic targets for various types of liver injury and elucidate disease pathogenesis.\nIn this study, metabolomics and transcriptomics were integrated. The effects of treating IC with CR on essential metabolites were determined with untargeted metabolomics. We then developed a novel integrated strategy to explore the key targets and mechanisms of CR in treating acute IC based on metabolomics and transcriptomics. This study provided new insights into the\nFIGURE 1 The structure of crocin I.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\nprotective effects of CR in the treatment of IC. The research flowchart is shown in Figure 2."

In view of the one-sidedness of single omics, data analysis and interpretation were performed using transcriptomic conjoint analysis methods. We found three key targets (ABCG5, HMGCR, SULT2A1) and one pathway (bile secretion). Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics was designed to study the metabolite profiles and gene expression profiles in biological systems under administration conditions and analyze the internal changes of biological systems from two levels (Chen et al., 2020).\nIn this study, we investigated the mechanism of the effect of CR against IC through metabolomics and transcriptomics. The IC model was successfully established by the administration of ANIT olive oil solution. Compared with the CON group, the serum levels of AST, TBA, and TBIL in the ANIT group were significantly increased, while they were significantly inhibited in the CR groups, which was consistent with the result of Xiong et al.

In addition, compared with the ANIT group, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, 1L-L\u03b2, and 1L-6 in serum were significantly inhibited after CR administration, indicating that CR could play a protective and therapeutic role by alleviating inflammation, which was consistent with histological analysis.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11\nCholestasis is closely related to metabolic disorders. Metabolomics can reveal the changes in the spectrum of endogenous metabolites in the body and further analyze the overall biological status and functional regulation of the body (S. Chen et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2020). After CR treatment, 45 metabolites in the serumwere regulated. These candidate biomarkers and pathways suggest that the pathogenesis of cholestasis disease is a complex process. Therefore, the transcriptomic analysis was applied to explore the mechanism of CR when treating IC. In our study, 3,211 DEGs were obtained between the CON and the ANIT group. Compared with the ANIT group, 148 genes were regulated in the CR group. In addition, the enrichment pathways were mainly involved with endocrine system-related pathways, signal transduction pathways, and lipid metabolism pathways. Using an integrated strategy of transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed the mechanism of CR in the treatment of IC. To further understand the regulation of potential biomarkers in the CR group, we used the Spearman correlation algorithm to perform correlation analysis on DEGs and differentially expressed metabolites. The targets and potential biomarkers of the CR group were analyzed,\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12\nand an interactive network of \u201cpotential-biomarker-targetcomponents\u201d was constructed. The results showed that the bile secretion pathway was the most important pathway in IC, and the most closely potential biomarkers were HMGCR, SULT2A1, ABCG5, ABCG8, and ABCC3.\nThe increase of bilirubin is one of the important phenomena of IC. Direct bilirubin is produced by indirect bilirubin through the transformation of bilirubin in the blood by hepatocytes in the liver (Kong et al., 2021). Further correlation analysis of DEGs and DEMs revealed that SULT2A1, HMGCR, are positively correlated with bilirubin, and ABCG5 are negatively correlated with bilirubin. The corresponding proteins of these three genes were verified by western blot. The analysis of expression of ABCG5, SULT2A1, and HMGCR was consistent with the western blot results, indicating that the results at the gene level and protein level were consistent, and the results of the bioinformatics analysis were reliable.\nSynthetic and metabolic enzymes of bile acids also play significant roles in bile acid homeostasis. SULT2A1 can play an important role in the bile secretion pathway (Wu et al., 2021). This study found that the expression level of SULT2A1 in the ANIT group was significantly lower than that in the CON group. The expression of SULT2A1 can be significantly increased after the high-dose intervention of CR, indicating that CR at a dose of 90 mg/kg can exert a detoxification effect by regulating bile acid metabolism. Cholestasis can also lead to abnormal cholesterol metabolism. The liver cholesterol transporter ABCG5/8 is a member of the ABC transporter family, and it is highly expressed in the liver. In this study, the expression of ABCG5/8 in the ANIT group was lower than that of the CON group, and cholestasis developed. In the CR group, the expression of ABCG5/8 could be reversed, and the liver injury was relieved. Multidrug resistancerelated protein 3 (MRP3/ABCC3) belongs to the ABC transporter\nsuperfamily, which can combine ATP and utilize energy to drive a variety of different molecules across cell membranes (Wang et al., 2021). MRP3 is responsible for the transfer of certain specific bile acids, and the part of MRP3 may be compensated for by other transporters (Perez-Pineda et al., 2021). In this study, the expression level of HMGCR protein in the ANIT group was increased. In the CR-H group, this protein was significantly downregulated, indicating that the cholesterol synthesis ability was inhibited, and the secretion of bile acids was relatively reduced.\nThe concentration of 12-ketodeoxycholic acid in the bile of rats in the ANIT group was significantly higher than that in the control group, suggesting that bile acid metabolism in rats was significantly interfered with, thus causing lipid metabolism dysfunction. Due to liver function injury, bilirubin secretion and synthesis of primary bile acid in liver cells increased, which promoted the excretion of 12- ketodeoxycholic acid and increased the detected amount of 12- ketodeoxycholic acid in bile. In the ANIT group, the levels of sulfated cholate in the liver and serum were significantly increased, suggesting that the body had a compensatory detoxification process and alleviated the hepatocyte accumulation toxicity of cholate."
