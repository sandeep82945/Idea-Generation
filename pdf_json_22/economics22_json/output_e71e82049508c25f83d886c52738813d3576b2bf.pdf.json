            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "Since the seminal work of Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012) on the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks in production networks that lead to aggregate fluctuations in the economy, research has focused on investigating the channels through which such shocks are transmitted. One line of papers provides supporting evidence based on microeconomic (firm-level) data by examining identifiable production-network linkages. To do so, these papers rely on large localized economic shocks perpetrated by natural disasters (e.g., Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016) and Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar (2019)). The alternative line of research relies on economy-wide shocks and identifies network connections through input-output tables (e.g., Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016)).\nOur article di\u21b5ers from the existing literature in a number of dimensions. First, we combine elements of both lines of investigation by examining a macro shock with micro-level data, as we can observe totality of the production network based on firm-level data. As a result, we can examine the economy-wide transmission of a non-localized shock, measured with disaggregated data that aren\u2019t limited to larger firms with publicly listed securities. Second, we study the propagation of a small unexpected shock, which heterogeneously a\u21b5ects a portion of firms in the production chain. We find that this a priori benign shock not only has a economically non-trivial direct e\u21b5ect but it also gets transmitted downstream through the production network. Third, and most importantly, we study the role of financial constraints in the shock transmission. We focus on liquidity constraints, as the relatively minor yet unexpected regulatory shock that we examine is more likely to a\u21b5ect firms in the shorter run: if companies carry less cash or cash equivalents on their balance sheets, they are more likely to have di culty to accommodate the e\u21b5ects of the RUSF increase. Our inferences suggest that even relatively small and non-localized shocks propagate through the production networks, especially so when firms are liquidity constrained.\nOur paper focuses on a shock that increased the cost of import financing in a heterogeneous manner. In October 2011, the Turkish government unexpectedly doubled the rate of the Resource Utilization Support Fund (RUSF) tax from 3% to 6%.1 This tax applies only to import transactions backed by international trade financing that is, in e\u21b5ect, a source of credit from non-domestic\n1For more detail on RUSF, see Section 2.\n1\nsources. This regulatory shock had a heterogeneous impact across Turkish importers because the use of international trade credit, which is the subject to the increased tax, di\u21b5ered across firms. Since the increase in the RUSF import duty was unexpected, an adjustment to other sources of financing may not have been possible in the short run. For similar reasons, replacing imported inputs with those sourced domestically is unlikely to have taken place immediately for most firms. Consequently, we examine the most plausible factor that could have delayed firms\u2019 reaction to the RUSF increase: whether their pre-shock financial liquidity played a role in the transmission or absorption of the shock.\nOur analysis proceeds as follows. First, we empirically investigate the extent to which the inputcost shock a\u21b5ected the importers that were directly exposed to the RUSF tax prior to its increase. Second, we examine whether the shock was transmitted to the upstream and downstream firms in the production network. Since our data allow us to observe the quasi-totality of the supplierbuyer pairs in the economy, we are able to study the propagation of this cost-shock in the entire production network. Third, we investigate the role of short-term financial constraints (referred to as liquidity constraints henceforth) in the transmission of the RUSF shock throughout the economy. To do so, we provide a simple partial equilibrium model that elicits the role of liquidity constraints in the shock\u2019s transmission. We extend an otherwise standard model (e.g., Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2015)) by allowing firms to choose between paying for imports immediately or delaying payment by using international trade credit. The model presents a simple, yet useful, setting for understanding the propagation of an input cost-shock, such as the increase in the RUSF tax, in a production network. Importantly, it also allows us to illustrate how liquidity constraints a\u21b5ect this propagation, something which we test empirically.2\nOur results can be summarized as follows. First, we find that firms with greater direct exposure to the RUSF tax prior to its increase experience a decline in sales relative to firms with lesser or no exposure to the shock. The exposed-firms decrease their reliance on imported inputs and add new domestic suppliers, suggesting that the tax increase induces an input reallocation towards domestic sellers. This finding suggests that, for the highly-exposed firms, the permanent input-cost increase, which is due to the doubling of the RUSF tax rate, is higher than the costs of switching to domestic\n2Di\u21b5erent from existing literature (e.g. Chaney (2016)), our model focuses on liquidity for financing importer\u2019s working capital needs.\n2\nsuppliers.3 Overall, the share of input costs in the total costs of a\u21b5ected firms goes up. While the full adjustment of imports and sales takes place in the year following the shock, the process of adding new suppliers continues for three years (which is the period considered in the analysis).\nSecond, in line with Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016), we find that the supply shock we consider propagates downstream through the exposed suppliers, but not upstream through the a\u21b5ected domestic buyers. Moreover, we find the e\u21b5ects of the indirect transmission of the shock through domestic suppliers is as large as the e\u21b5ect of the own (i.e., direct) exposure to the shock.\nThird, we find that the importers that were liquidity-constrained prior to the RUSF increase are hit harder by the shock: the magnitudes of our coe cient estimates indicate that the liquidityconstrained firms appear to have amplified the propagation of the shock in the production network as compared to unconstrained ones.\nOur paper focuses on a particular policy episode that allows us to isolate the e\u21b5ects of a relatively minor and non-localized cost-shock, as such events are typically very di cult to identify compared to larger and localized perturbations. But we believe that our conclusions go beyond the context of the RUSF tax and extend to any setting where adjustment to a cost-push shock requires incurring a fixed cost. For example, a trade war or dissolution of an existing preferential trade agreement (e.g., Brexit) are cost-push shocks that may force firms to find alternative supply sources and incur search costs in the process.4 Since the latter are more consequential events, our a priori benign regulatory change forms can be thought of providing a lower bound for the e\u21b5ects of larger shocks.\nOur paper is closely related to three strands of existing research. First, our work contributes to the literature on the transmission of shocks through production networks, which originated with the work of Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012) and has been extended by others. For example, Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016) show that large economic shocks caused by localized natural disasters in the US, which a\u21b5ect suppliers that are listed on the stock markets, have economically important e\u21b5ects on their client-firms whose shares are traded. Carvalho, Nirei, Saito, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2016) and Boehm, Flaaen, and Pandalai-Nayar (2019) focus on the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake in Japan and provide more evidence on the propagation of shocks through\n3Though we do not analyze aggregate output or welfare, results by Baqaee and Farhi (2019) imply that even small tari\u21b5 changes can have first-order e\u21b5ects on both in open economies with distortions.\n4See Bernard, Moxnes, and Saito (2019) for evidence on how search cost a\u21b5ect formation on buyer-supplier linkages.\n3\nproduction networks. Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016) investigate the impact of various shocks on the American economy using a model of sectoral network structure, which they identify based on the industry-level US input-output tables. They find sizeable network propagation e\u21b5ects for both demand and supply shocks. The demand shocks, such as increases in Chinese imports and changes in US government spending, propagate upstream; whereas the supply shocks, such as those a\u21b5ecting TFP and patenting, tend to be transmitted downstream. We extend this literature by drawing attention to the importance of short-term financial constraints (in the form of low financial liquidity) for shock propagation. Importantly, we show that even a relatively small cost-push shock can propagate through a production network and have a non-negligible impact. We also confirm, with detailed data on firm-to-firm linkages, the sector-level finding of Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016) that a supply shock propagates to downstream firms but has no discernible impact on upstream firms.\nSecond, our paper extends the literature on the role of financial constraints in production networks (see Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016); Alfaro, Garc\u0301\u0131a-Santana, and Moral-Benito (Forthcoming); Bigio and La\u2019O (2020); Costello (Forthcoming); Jacobson and von Schedvin (2015); Boissay and Gropp (2013); and Kalemli-Ozcan, Kim, Shin, Sorensen, and Yesiltas (2014)).5 In contrast to these papers, we are able to examine the firm-level transmission of an unexpected shock through a country\u2019s entire production network. Our findings suggest that even relatively minor, non-localized cost-push shocks can have economically non-negligible e\u21b5ects. While the focus of our paper is not about (domestic or foreign) network formation, our results also suggest that, in the face of an input shock, the exposed firms alter their supplier network. They appear to do so by substituting foreign inputs, whose prices went up due to the unexpected regulatory change, with local alternatives from\n5Bigio and La\u2019O (2020) introduce reduced-form working capital constraints into the Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016) fixed network model to analyze the aggregate impact of firm-level financial constraints. They find that financial constraints prevent firms from producing at the optimal scale and lead to misallocation of labor across sectors. Moreover, an ine cient discrepancy between labor and consumption, and the resulting employment choices, arise in their set-up due to general equilibrium e\u21b5ects. Altinoglu (2018), Reischer (2019) and Luo (2020) use similar frameworks to study the impact of inter-firm trade credit through calibration exercises. Jacobson and von Schedvin (2015) study the exposure of Swedish firms to corporate bankruptcies through trade credit in production chains and find that trade creditors su\u21b5er 50% higher losses than banks lending to the corporate sector. Boissay and Gropp (2013) examine the transmission of trade-credit-related payment defaults. They find that credit-constrained firms that are on the receiving end of payment defaults (whose causes cannot be observed in the data) are more likely to pass on a major portion of the related shock through trade credit, which generates additional payment defaults. In contrast, companies that are financially unconstrained help stop the payment default chain. Costello (Forthcoming) uses proprietary data to study firm-level bank credit shocks impact on supplier-buyer relationships, including trade credit.\n4\ndomestic suppliers.\nFinally, our work is also related, albeit less directly, to the growing literature on domestic production networks. On the theoretical front, there has been significant progress in explaining the formation of production networks (e.g. Oberfield (2018), Lim (2018), Tintelnot, Kikkawa, Mogstad, and Dhyne (2019), Huneeus (2018)). On the empirical front, Bernard, Dhyne, Magerman, Manova, and Moxnes (2019) use firm-to-firm trade data similar to ours to study the sources of firm size heterogeneity in Belgium. While we don\u2019t study network formation per se, our findings can be seen as a contribution to this literature as we document a substitution between foreign and domestic intermediates in the face of an unexpected cost-push shock.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the exogenous shock that we use for identification in the empirical analysis. Section 3 details the data and variable definitions, while Section 4 outlines the empirical approach. Section 5 presents the main results on the direct and indirect impacts of the shock. The first part of Section 6 describes the simple partial equilibrium theory framework that guides our empirical tests on the role of liquidity constraints in cost-push shock\u2019s transmission; whereas the second part of the same section takes these predictions to the data. Section 7 concludes the paper."

            "text": "The imports-related RUSF contribution was instituted by the Turkish Council of Ministers on May 12, 1988. The management of this import tax, which is considered a statutory import duty by the US Department of Commerce (e.g., ICF 201304), is within the realm of the executive branch, as changes therein do not require a prior parliamentary debate. Before 2011, RUSF imposed a 3% levy on the value of imports involving explicit or implicit non-domestic credit made available during an international trade transaction. In the face of a growing current account deficit, on October 13, 2011, a Council of Ministers\u2019 decree unexpectedly increased the RUSF levy on imports from 3% to 6%.\nThe RUSF tax is administered by the Turkish Customs and Trade Ministry, which requires that all import transactions\u2019 details be entered into an electronic database by its o cers during the customs clearing process. The resulting dataset allows us to know product and payment details for\n5\nall imported goods. These are comprehensive since the Turkish Customs\u2019 Law no. 4458 imposes high penalties (at the order of three times the mandated RUSF payment, which is proportional to the value of the imported goods) if the RUSF tax is not paid as due or its avoidance is detected.\nIn practice, the implementation of the RUSF levy is based on the type of internationally defined financing method used in an import transaction. The RUSF statute applies the levy to imports using open account (OA), acceptance credit (AC), and deferred-payment letter of credit (DLC). These three types of international trade financing amount to international trade credit being provided by the foreign exporter to the the Turkish importer. In the case of OA, the payment to exporter is typically due within 30 to 90 days after the receipt of the goods. AC is a type of letter of credit financing that involves a time draft for a delayed payment after receipt of the trade documents. DLC is another type of letter of credit financing with deferred payment, but one that does not involve a time draft.\nIn contrast, the levy does not apply to cash in advance transactions (in which the importer pre-pays for the goods), transactions financed through a standard letter of credit (in which the payment is guaranteed by the importer\u2019s bank provided that the conditions stipulated in the trade contract are met), or documentary collection (which involves bank intermediation without a payment guarantee).\nFinally, the RUSF levy applies only to ordinary imports. Processing imports, used in the manufacture of products solely destined for exports, have always been exempted from import taxes in Turkey.6"

            "heading": "3.1 Data",
            "text": "To conduct our analysis, we use two Turkish administrative micro-level datasets that can only be accessed on the premises of the Turkish Statistical Institute (TSI) and the Turkish Ministry of Industry and Technology (MoIT).7\n6The fact that processing imports are not subjected to RUSF allows us to use them in a placebo test. 7Similar to the US Census micro-data utilization requirements, access to these confidential datasets requires a special permission involving a background check, and the results can only be exported upon approval by the MoIT and TSI sta\u21b5.\n6\nThe first dataset, available at the TSI, contains detailed customs data which can be merged with the business survey data. The latter include information on firm-level costs, sales and employment (but no balance sheet data), and cover all firms with more than 20 employees together with a representative sample of small firms. TSI customs dataset allows us to trace the universe of Turkish imports disaggregated by the importing firm, source country, 6-digit Harmonized System (HS6) product code, trade regime (i.e., ordinary or processing), and importantly for our purposes, trade financing type involved (i.e., cash in advance, letter of credit, open account, etc.)\nThe second administrative dataset that we use is maintained by the MoIT for the purpose of calculating and collecting the value added tax (VAT). The firm-to-firm domestic trade data that are collected by the MoIT cover all domestic between-firm flows so long as the total value of transactions for a seller-buyer pair is above 5,000 Turkish Liras (TLs), or roughly $2,650 (based on the Dec 31, 2011 exchange rate) in a given year. This low annual threshold allows us to observe almost all domestic supplier-buyer pairs in Turkey. Between 2010 and 2014, we are able to trace, on average, roughly 600,000 firms, approximately 6,000,000 buyer-seller connections, with close to 20,000,000 transactions per year. We also match these firm-pair transaction data with corporate financial statements (income statement and balance sheet) as well as the customs data on imports (with one important caveat, see the next paragraph). The financial statement data available allow us to calculate outcome variables (such as sales growth), as well as control variables (such as leverage or liquidity ratios). Finally, the MoIT dataset also reports the 4-digit NACE industry and provincelevel location of firm, which allow us to include fixed-e\u21b5ects to control for sector- and locality-level unobservables that might otherwise confound our estimates.\nWhile the MoIT dataset covers Turkish firms\u2019 imports at the HS6 product code, country, and year level, it does not include information on the types of trade financing used. Since the RUSF is charged based on the type of trade financing, the absence of this information in the MoIT dataset prevents us from constructing a direct firm-level measure of exposure to the policy change. Moreover, due to confidentiality reasons, we cannot transfer firm-level import financing information from the TSI dataset and match it with the one at the MoIT. Therefore, we use the TSI data to create a HS6 product code-country-year-level measure of exposure to the RUSF tax based on import financing mode, which we then merge with the MoIT dataset in order to create a Bartik-type instrument. This measure is constructed based on ordinary imports (i.e., it excludes processing imports) and is\n7\ndefined as follows:\nExposurevt =\nP m2{OA,AC,DLC}MvmtP\nmMvmt\nwhere v indexes input variety (i.e., country-product pairs), m trade financing types (including OA, AC, and DLC targeted by RUSF), M denotes imports, and t is the time (i.e., year) index.\nThe Exposure measure covers 150 source-countries, roughly 4,700 HS6 product codes, and corresponds to approximately 75,000 country-product pairs.8 Figure A1 presents the frequency distribution of Exposurevt for t = 2011 (which we consider to be the pre-shock year, as the tax increase took place in mid-October 2011) and t = 2012 (henceforth, prefix A denotes Appendix figures and tables). The measure varies between 0 and 1, though zeros are excluded from the figure, in order not to overwhelm the rest of the frequency distribution graph. As illustrated in the figure, the distribution shifted to the left after the increase in the RUSF rate. The average value of the share of imports with foreign source of financing decreased from about 20% before the the shock to roughly 14% afterwards.9\nIn the empirical analysis, we measure Exposure as of 2010. However, reliance on external financing at the variety level is quite stable over time. Table A2 shows that the vast majority of the explained variation in Exposurevt over the 2004-2011 period is due to variety-specific factors. Accounting for variations over time across countries or products adds very little to the share of explained variation in Exposurevt. To provide further evidence, we regress Exposurevt on time varying country and product fixed e\u21b5ects, as well as time-invariant variety fixed e\u21b5ects. Figure A3 in the Appendix plots Exposurev,t=2010 against the estimated variety-level fixed e\u21b5ects from this regression. The correlation between the two measures is high, and the linear slope is close to one. As importers frequently switch products and source countries (e.g. Manova and Zhang (2009)), i.e., the set of importers for a given variety changes over time, this correlation is driven by time-invariant characteristics of varieties. This is the variation we will exploit in our empirical analysis.\n8As illustrated in Appendix Table A1, there is a lot of variation in Exposure across products within sourcecountries, as well as across source countries within the imported product.\n9Figure A2 in the Appendix presents the frequency distribution of Exposurev,t based on processing imports for the same years and shows no such shift.\n8\nAnother feature of Exposurev,t=2010 is that it pools information from a large and heterogeneous set of importers. Import values are not concentrated among a few firms within a variety: average number of importers per variety is 65, and the average share of an importer in total value of imports is less than one percent (median is about 0.05%, and 99th percentile is 17%). These statistics are almost unchanged for varieties with Exposurev,t=2010 > 0.\nAs our identification is driven by the increase in a border tax that applies to imported goods with foreign trade financing, we exclude service sector firms. Moreover, we drop micro entities that do not report balance sheets or income statements.10 These restrictions leave us with a sample of about 60,000 manufacturing firms, for which we observe domestic trade links, detailed income and balance sheet information, and customs records. To these MoIT data, we add the payment-type based HS6 product code-country Exposure constructed from the TSI dataset, as explained in the next section."

            "text": "Firm-level exposure, which is the key variable in our analysis, is constructed as a Bartik-type variable for t = 2010 as follows:\nExposuref,t=2010 = X\nv\n!fv,t=2010 \u21e5 Exposurev,t=2010 (1)\nwhere !fv,t=2010 denotes the share of imports of variety v in firm f \u2019s total variable costs (defined as the sum of labor costs, purchases from other domestic firms and imports) at time t = 2010. Exposuref,t=2010 predicts actual firm-level exposure based on the firm\u2019s import composition and the exposure of a given variety (Exposurev,t=2010). To investigate the e\u21b5ects of the RUSF tax increase, we construct the following variable that captures the e\u21b5ective tax increase ( ln \u2327f ) at the firm-level:\nln \u2327f = Exposuref,t=2010 \u21e5 ln \u2713 1 + \u23272012 1 + \u23272011 \u25c6 (2)\nAs indicated above, the tax increase took place in the mid-October 2011, so for the purposes of\n10Such firms keep records using a single-entry bookkeeping system.\n9\nour analysis we consider 2011 to be the pre-shock year.11 However, to be conservative, we create our exposure variable based on 2010 trade figures in order to avoid the possibility of the exposure measure being a\u21b5ected by the policy change.\nAs explained before, because the customs dataset available at MoIT does not report information on payment methods, we need to rely on a Bartik-type variable to capture the extent to which Turkish firms were a\u21b5ected by the increase in the RUSF rate. It is worth noting that even if the firm-level exposure were directly observable, we would prefer to instrument it with our Bartik-type exposure variable due to potential endogeneity concerns. Therefore, it is important that the Bartiktype exposure is su ciently relevant for the actual firm-level exposure to the RUSF shock. To check whether our Bartik-type exposure variable in equation (1) tracks the actual exposure well, we use the TSI customs database where the actual exposure can be fully measured using information on payment methods:\nExposureActualf,t=2010 =\nP m2{OA,AC,DLC}Mf,m,t=2010\nTotal costsf,t=2010 , (3)\nwhere Total costs is equal to the sum of the costs of labor and domestic and imported material inputs. Using ExposureActualf,t=2010, we construct the actual e\u21b5ective tax increase as follows:\nln \u2327Actualf = Exposure Actual f,t=2010 \u21e5 ln \u2713 1 + \u23272012 1 + \u23272011 \u25c6 (4)\nThe distributions of Exposuref,t=2010 and ExposureActualf,t=2010 are presented in Figure A4.\n11If firm-level outcomes were to be a\u21b5ected by the short period (between mid-October and end of December in 2011) during which the higher tax rate was in e\u21b5ect, this would work against us finding any impact of the shock in the analysis.\n10\nTo check the informativeness of our Bartik-type instrument, we regress the actual firm-level RUSF exposure that can only be observed in the TSI dataset on the Bartik-type instrument we calculate, and present the results in Table 1. The coe cient estimated in the first column of Table 1 implies that, controlling for industry-region fixed e\u21b5ects, a one-percent increase in the predicted firm-level Exposuref,t=2010 is associated with a one-percent increase in the actual firmlevel exposure to the RUSF shock. The second column repeats the exercise for the increase in firm-level e\u21b5ective tax rate ln \u2327Actualf . As expected, the estimated coe cient is almost identical to the one in the first column. We draw two conclusions from these results. First, our Bartik-type exposure variable is highly informative about the actual firm-level exposure to the RUSF shock.12 This is not surprising given our earlier result that time-invariant variety-specific characteristics constitute the primary source of variation in the reliance of imports on external financing. Second, the magnitudes of the estimates presented in Table 1 are not statistically di\u21b5erent from one. This implies that 2SLS regression, where the Bartik-type exposure variable constitutes an instrument for the actual firm-level exposure, would generate an estimate that is is very close to the reduced-form\n12The respective values of R2 in the first and second columns are 0.580 and 0.582. The second column corresponds to our first-stage, and the F-statistic for the instrument is 594.3.\n11\nestimate.13\nOur Bartik-type (shift-share) instrument is constructed from a large number of highly dispersed \u201cshocks\u201d (i.e., Exposurev,t=2010) distributed heterogeneously across firms in di\u21b5erent industries and regions. In a recent paper, Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel (2018) study the conditions under which identification can be achieved in shift-share instrumental variable regressions through the quasi-random assignment of shocks even when exposure shares are endogenous. Here, we discuss those conditions in our setting. First, we already established in the previous paragraph that Exposuref,t=2010 is highly informative about importing firms\u2019 actual reliance on external financing. Second, our shocks are generated via imports (given the trade-financing type) from about 150 distinct source countries and 4,700 6-digit HS codes, which amounts to a large number (approximately 75,000) unique varieties. Third, these shocks are highly dispersed: the standard deviation of Exposurev,t=2010 is 0.28 for all varieties, and 0.31 for varieties with Exposurev,t=2010 > 0. The interquartile range for the latter sample is 0.40. Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel (2018) show that the \u201cshocks\u201d view to identification in shift-share instrumental variable regressions relies on an important condition: average importance of any shock should be su ciently small. To illustrate this in our data, we construct average import share of each variety across importers: !v = P f (1/N)!fv,t=2010. The condition requires that even the largest !v must be small. In our data, its value varies between (approximately) zero and 0.004. Both the mean and median values are close to zero. The concentration of shocks, as measured by the Herfindahl\u2013Hirschman Index, is also low. The inverse of this index is informative about the e\u21b5ective number of shocks, which is about 36,388 in our data. Based on these statistics, we believe identification is achieved in our setting through firm-level \u201cshocks\u201d even in the presence of possibly endogenous shares.\n13In an exactly identified model with one endogenous variable, the following relationship holds between the 2SLS estimate ( 2SLS) and the reduced form estimate ( RF ), which is obtained by regressing the outcome variable directly on the instrument: 2SLS = RF\nFS , where FS denotes the first-stage estimate. As the estimated coe cient in the\nsecond column of Table 1 (which corresponds to FS in this context) is not statistically di\u21b5erent from one, the values of 2SLS and reduced-form estimates would be very close. We confirm this later in Table A6.\n12"

To see this, we present below an alternative representation of our Bartik-type exposure variable, which has two components: the predicted share of firm\u2019s imports subject to the RUSF tax (ExposureM ) and firm\u2019s import intensity (i.e., the share of imported inputs in firm\u2019s variable costs):\nExposuref,t=2010 = X\nv\n!f,v,t=2010 \u21e5 Exposurev,t=2010\n= X\nv\nMf,v,t=2010 TotalCostsf,t=2010 \u21e5 Exposurev,t=2010\n= X\nv\nMf,v,t=2010 TotalCostsf,t=2010 \u21e5 Mf,t=2010 Mf,t=2010 \u21e5 Exposurev,t=2010\n= Mf,t=2010\nTotalCostsf,t=2010| {z } Import intensity\n\u21e5\nExposureM f,t=2010z }| { X\nv\nMv,f,t=2010 Mf,t=2010\n\u21e5 Exposurev,t=2010 | {z } Share of firm\u2019s imports subject to RUSF\n(10)\nThe median direct exposure in the sample is zero. For importers, the average direct exposure amounts to 1.8% of the total variable costs. This low level exposure is primarily due to small import intensity as the average value of ExposureM is 17% among importers. Table A3 shows that almost all firms are indirectly exposed to the tax via their suppliers or customers. The median value of exposure via suppliers and customers equals 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. These figures are only slightly higher for importers."

One possibility is that they avoided the tax altogether by switching to cash-in-advance payment, in which case they would have to increase their working capital (i.e., cash that is devoted to their operations). Another way to avoid RUSF completely was to switch to domestic suppliers of same inputs or their substitutes presuming that they existed at acceptable quality and price. The importing firms weighed the costs of these options against paying the higher RUSF tax and preserving their pre-shock foreign input supplier. The default course of action for the importing firms was to continue buying from the same exporter under the same conditions, but now pay a 100% higher RUSF tax.\nFor all these reasons, it is reasonable for our analysis to consider only changes to the domestic supplier network. Searching for new foreign suppliers would be the dominated strategy for all importers: not only they would need to pay (potentially higher than domestic) search costs for new foreign suppliers, but still face the same international trade financing cost increases either via cash-in-advance terms or paying the tax on open account transactions."

The latter is particularly important as the shares in our Bartik-type variable are incomplete: since the denominator of !fv,t=2010 in equation (10) is the firm\u2019s total costs rather than its total imports, the shares do not add up to one at the firm level. In this, we follow Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel (2018) who suggest controlling for incomplete shares in the regression as failing to do so could pose a threat to identification. Moreover, adding the initial import intensity of firms to the specification controls for other trade related shocks such as exchange rate movements.17\nThe specification in equation (11) also controls for industry-region fixed e\u21b5ects, \u21b5i,r where i denotes one of the 22 two-digit NACE industry segments; and r corresponds to the 81 contiguous\n15Further on, we investigate whether the shock has medium term e\u21b5ects by estimating the baseline specification between 2013-2012 and 2014-2013.

These fixed e\u21b5ects control for confounding factors or shocks that could vary at the economy, industry, region, or industry-region levels. As our firm-level dependent variable is di\u21b5erenced, firm-level time-invariant unobservables, which might otherwise have an influence on our results, are also eliminated. In all regressions, standard errors are clustered at the industry-and-region (i.e., i and r) level.18\nIn equation (11), is the tax elasticity of the outcome variable Yf .

The size of this elasticity depends on the pass-through of taxes onto costs and firm\u2019s mark-ups.\nOur extended specification includes additional variables capturing a firm\u2019s exposure to the shock\nvia its suppliers and buyers:\nlnYf = ln \u2327f + s ln \u2327 Suppliers f + b ln \u2327 Buyers f + Xf,t=2010 + \u21b5i,r + f (12)\nwhere, lnYf , ln \u2327f , ln \u2327 Suppliers f , ln \u2327 Buyers f , and \u21b5ir are as defined under section 3.3.

For the time being, we ignore the network e\u21b5ects. We expect directly exposed firms to move away from imported inputs and increase their reliance on domestic sourcing from local suppliers. Our findings below confirm that such a substitution does indeed take place. 18Our results are robust to clustering standard errors at the 4-digit NACE industry-segments. The number of 2- digit manufacturing industries in NACE classification is not su ciently large for us to use as our alternative clustering variable.\n19See Appendix A.3.1 for a derivation of the two e\u21b5ects in equation (40). There is also a negligible e\u21b5ect due to substitution between foreign and domestic intermediates that we ignore here.\n17\nIn the first column of Table 2, we consider the annual change in the share of imports in total value of input purchases taking place after the RUSF increase. The coe cient estimate for the increase in the e\u21b5ective tax rate is negative and statistically significant at the 1%-level: the increase in the RUSF tax has discouraged exposed firms from using imported inputs. The implied elasticity of imports (as a fraction of total input purchases) calculated for the average importer that imports about half of its inputs is 2.6.20\nIn the second column of Table 2, the dependent variable is the change in the share of input purchases in total costs (where total costs are defined as input purchases and wages).21 The estimated coe cient on \u2327f is positive and statistically significant, implying that firms exposed to the shock experienced an increase in their input costs relative to their overall costs. To the extent that the exposed firms pass this cost increase into their prices, the shock will a\u21b5ect their buyers regardless of whether they are themselves directly a\u21b5ected by the shock or not.

Therefore, we normalize input costs by overall costs.\n18\ninvestigate further in the paper.\nConsistent with the observed decrease in the imported goods as a fraction of total input purchases, firms directly exposed to the tax appear to have substituted foreign inputs with domestic ones. This is illustrated in the third column of Table 2, where the outcome variable is the number of new domestic suppliers in 2012, normalized by the number of firm\u2019s domestic suppliers in 2010. A new domestic supplier is defined as one from which the firm in question did not make any purchases at t = 2010 or t = 2011. The coe cient of interest is positive and statistically significant at the 1%-level. The estimate suggests that a one-standard-deviation increase in the RUSF exposure for an importer is associated with one new domestic supplier.22\nTurning to the control variables, the estimated coe cients on the pre-shock employment do not seem to suggest an economically meaningful impact. We note that pre-shock import intensity is positively correlated with the number of new domestic suppliers added after the tax change. Finally, we note that our findings are robust to excluding the control variables."

In the last column of Table 2, the dependent variable is defined as the log change in sales between 2011 and 2012.

The coe cient estimate for\nln \u2327f is equal to 6.2, and it is statistically significant at the 5%-level. This result is consistent with the earlier observation about the increase in input costs in the year following the RUSF shock (see column (2) of the same table).\nTo interpret the magnitude of this e\u21b5ect, recall from Section 3.2 that , the estimate of the tax elasticity of the outcome variable, here sales, is equal to the product of the two other elasticities @ ln pf @ln\u2327f \u21e5 (1 \"H). To recover the value of the elasticity of price with respect to tax, we assume the price elasticity of demand to be \"H = 5 (Broda and Weinstein (2006)).

For instance, assuming \"H = 9.65, based on the estimates reported by Head and Ries (2001), would imply a passthrough rate of tax onto prices of 0.7.24 Depending on the assumed value of price elasticity of demand, a one standard deviation increase in Exposure for importers ranges between 0.07% and 0.15% increase in the estimated price response.25\nTo gauge the economic significance of the estimated e\u21b5ect on sales, let us consider a one-standarddeviation increase in Exposure. Our baseline estimate implies a 0.65% decline in sales for such importer. This e\u21b5ect is economically important as the average sales growth between 2011-2012 observed in the data is 9%."

The estimated coe cients for the year 2012 are broadly similar to the baseline estimates. More importantly, including observations for 2010 and 2011 allows us to test for the existence of pre-trends in the relationship between the firm-level outcome and its exposure to the RUSF shock, while includ-\n23Using the tari\u21b5 changes introduced during the 2018 trade war, Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (2019) estimate that the passthrough rate of input tari\u21b5s onto domestic producer prices is 1.8. In another paper, Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2019) also exploit the recent changes in the US trade policy and report a complete passthrough of the tari\u21b5s to import prices.\n24Head and Ries (2001) estimate price elasticities focusing on the US-Canada trade. As the two economies are very similar, we believe that their estimates may be more appropriate in our within-Turkey context than others available in the literature. Head and Ries (2001) obtain price elasticities of demand ranging between 7.9 and 11.4 depending on the specification. In our calculations, we use the average of these two values, namely 9.65.\n25One can cite additional factors that may play a role increasing the tax passthrough. For example, RUSF introduction may nudge firms to increase their prices earlier than planned \u2013 as shown by Gagnon (2009) prices can be staggered even in economies with medium inflation. Moreover, as exposed firms move away from foreign intermediates (as documented in section 5.1.1), they bear search costs and adjustment costs for the usage of new intermediate inputs. In the short run, these are likely to increase the variable costs.\n20\ning later years is useful for understanding the persistence of the e\u21b5ects. For all outcome variables the coe cient estimates for pre-shock years (2010 and 2011) are small in magnitude and not significantly di\u21b5erent from zero. This finding is reassuring for the identification strategy: it suggests that the assumption of parallel trends for the treated and control groups in the pre-treatment period, which is a prerequisite for a valid di\u21b5erence-in-di\u21b5erences estimation, cannot be rejected. Second, the RUSF shock seems to have a level e\u21b5ect on all outcomes except for the exposed firm\u2019s new domestic supplier linkages. In other words, the adjustment to imported inputs and sales taking place in 2012 is not followed by further changes in the subsequent years. The finding that adjustment to the domestic supplier network continues beyond 2012 is consistent with the fact that it takes time to switch from imported inputs purchased from foreign suppliers to domestically produced ones.\nNotes: The figure plots the estimates of l, together with 95% confidence intervals, obtained from estimating the specification in (13). Dependent variable changes across sub-figures as clearly stated in the titles. Robust standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the 2-digit NACE and region level.\nTo verify that the coe cient estimates that we observe in Table 2 are really driven by the changes in the RUSF tax, we conduct a placebo test for which we construct \u2327f based on Exposure Processing f,t=2010 using data on firms\u2019 processing imports and actual RUSF taxes of \u23272011=0.03 and \u23272012=0.06. Since the RUSF does not apply to processing imports, we should not see any response of firm-level outcomes to this placebo exposure measure. The results presented in Table A5 are consistent with this prior: the estimated coe cients of ln \u2327f are not economically or statistically significant for any of the outcome variables. These results lend further credibility to our baseline results.\nAdditional controls In a set of robustness checks, we examine whether our baseline estimates are driven by omitted variables. In particular, we include additional control variables in the baseline specification, which are constructed using similar shares as in equation (1) and shifts that are potentially correlated with Exposurev,t=2010. As discussed in Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel (2018), adding such controls in the estimation is useful not only for consistency but also to obtain valid inference.26\nFirst, reliance of Turkish firms on external financing when importing a particular product could be correlated with economic developments in the source-country during the same period to the extent that such developments a\u21b5ect the product\u2019s price. To account for this possibility, we add to the baseline specification a weighted average of changes in source-country real per capita GDP between 2010 and 2012: Weighted GDPpc growthf = P c !fc,t=2010 \u21e5 GDPpc growth 2010 2012 c , where !fc,t=2010 is the share of source country c in firm\u2019s total costs as of 2010. The results are presented in panel B of Table A5. For all outcome variables, the estimates obtained for the variable of interest are very close to the baseline estimates.\nAnother potential threat to our identification strategy is exchange rate movements. Depreciation of TL during the same period would increase the price of imported inputs and trigger a chain of events (broadly) similar to the increase in RUSF rate. This concern is alleviated by the fact that the share of USD-denominated imports was 62% in 2011-2012, with the rest distributed between\n26Adao, Kolesa\u0301r, and Morales (2019) also discuss inference in settings similar to ours and propose methods to obtain valid inference.\n22\nEuro (33%), and TL (3%), and other currencies (2%). As a result, adding the firm\u2019s initial import intensity as a control variable captures its overall exchange rate risk prior to the RUSF-shock. However, one could still be concerned about cross-currency movements: if switches between USD and Euro are associated with switches between payment methods, then exposure to RUSF would be correlated with exposure to cross-currency risk. To address this concern, we construct a Bartiktype variable that is very similar to Exposuref but replaces the shifts in equation (1) with the share of USD-denomonated imports at the variety level as of 2010. As reported in panel C of Table A5, our results are robust to this additional control variable.\nFinally, we check whether accounting for exposed firms\u2019 capital structure, which is likely to be representative of their longer-term financial constraints, matters for the baseline results. In the bottom panel of Table A5, we add the leverage variable, defined as the ratio of total debt to total assets, calculated as of 2010 as an additional control to the baseline specification. Including the leverage ratio as a control does not a\u21b5ect the estimates for or their statistical significance in any of the four columns. We conclude that the firms\u2019 long-term financing structure (i.e., financial contraints) does not a\u21b5ect its response to the RUSF increase. That said, the short-term financial constraints (i.e., access to liquidity) might, something we examine in Section 6.\nAlternative sample and 2SLS estimation As discussed in Section 3.2, data on actual firmlevel RUSF exposure are available in the TSI dataset but not in the MoIT dataset. Using just the TSI data, we were able to show that our Bartik-type instrument is highly informative about the actual firm-level exposure (recall Table 1). Moreover, the coe cient estimated in the first stage was not statistically di\u21b5erent from unity, implying that 2SLS estimation, where Exposuref,t=2010 is used as an instrument for the actual firm-level RUSF exposure, would yield an estimate that is very close to the reduced-form estimate (i.e., our baseline estimates).\nWe confirm this in Table A6 where we examine the impact of the shock on firm sales using the TSI as well as the MoIT datasets. We have to restrict our attention to gross sales, as it is the only outcome variable that we can construct using both datasets in a comparable way. In the former, we observe the actual firm-level exposure to the RUSF tax change, while in the latter we have to rely on the exposure predicted based on the composition of firm-level imports.\nWe start with the TSI dataset. In the first column of Table A6, we estimate an OLS regression\n23\nrelating changes in firm\u2019s sales to change in the actual firm-level exposure to the RUSF tax shock. As expected, we obtain a negative and highly significant coe cient. Next, we instrument the actual exposure with the predicted exposure, and again obtain a negative and highly significant coe cient of interest (see second and third columns). In the final column, we turn to the MoIT, where only the predicted exposure is available, and estimate an OLS specification.\nThe take-away message from this exercise is that the estimates from the reduced form approach are very close to those obtained from the IV specification. This validates our choice of relying on MoIT data whose main advantage is observing firm-to-firm linkages that will allow us to investigate propagation of the shock through production networks."

            "text": "Next, we examine whether the RUSF shock propagates beyond the directly exposed firms, using the regression equation (12). We consider the same firm-level outcomes as before, namely annual change in the share of imports in total input purchases, share of input purchases in total costs, new domestic supplier links, and sales. The results, presented in Table 3, follow the same format as the earlier tables.\nThree observations emerge from Table 3. First, after adding the indirect exposures through suppliers and buyers, the direct exposure e\u21b5ects retain their order of magnitude and statistical significance reported in Table 2: directly exposed firms reduced their reliance on imported inputs, experienced an increase in the cost of their input purchases, expanded their domestic supplier network, and su\u21b5ered lower sales growth compared to non-exposed firms.\n24\nSecond, and more importantly, we find evidence of a downstream propagation of the RUSF shock from suppliers to their customers, as indicated by a decrease in the sales growth of the latter. In other words, we observe that firms are indirectly a\u21b5ected by the shock if their suppliers are exposed to the RUSF increase. This finding, which is separate from firms\u2019 possible own-shock exposure, is consistent with a pricing channel, assuming that (i) importers reflect RUSF increase in their prices, and (ii) switching from shocked importer-suppliers to domestic-suppliers is costly, at least in the short-term. Indeed, in the second column, we find that firms that are exposed to the RUSF increase through their suppliers experience an increase in the cost of their input purchases. The estimated coe cient on ln \u2327Suppliersf in the fourth column is equal to 7.0 and statistically significant at the 5%-level. While its magnitude looks slightly larger than the magnitude of the direct e\u21b5ect, in unreported tests we find that these two are not statistically di\u21b5erent from each other. This suggests that, for an equal-sized direct exposure and supplier-driven exposure to the RUSF increase, the e\u21b5ect on sales through suppliers is comparable to the direct e\u21b5ect.\n25\nThird, and equally importantly, we find no evidence of upstream propagation of the shock from the exposed buyers to their domestic suppliers. The coe cient on ln \u2327Buyersf is small and statistically insignificant for all of the outcome variables presented in Table 3.\nIn another exercise, presented in Table A7, we consider the sum of both first and second degree linkages in the production network, as defined in equations (5)-(9). The results confirm the conclusions from Table 3. The estimates obtained when using the cumulative first- and second-order exposures are very similar in magnitude.27\nIn sum, we conclude that the increased tax burden has a\u21b5ected firms\u2019 sales in the short term through two channels: (i) directly through own exposure if they are importing in ways covered by RUSF, and (ii) indirectly via their suppliers. Moreover, we find that the impact of the shock that travels downstream through the production network is comparable to the direct e\u21b5ect on the exposed firms. However, we find no empirical evidence that the RUSF shock travels upstream in the domestic production network. These findings are consistent with the predictions of Acemoglu, Akcigit, and Kerr (2016). We conclude that even a relatively small, non-localized cost-push shock can propagate and get magnified through the production networks."

We also find that the negative e\u21b5ects of the shock are short lived as the a\u21b5ected firms switch to domestic input substitutes within a short time period (Figure 1).\nThat said, it is unlikely that all firms are a\u21b5ected the same way by the input-cost shock: to the extent their short-term financial condition, i.e., their liquidity position, allows it, at least a certain fraction of firms ought to be able to avoid or dampen the e\u21b5ect of the RUSF increase on their input costs. In order to do so, firms could cease importing based on international trade credit terms that expose them to the RUSF import levy. Alternatively, albeit less likely, they could continue to import and pay the higher RUSF duty but not pass it into their prices. Given the unexpected nature of the tax increase, it makes economic sense that the way firms would avoid\n27Adding higher order network exposures does not a\u21b5ect the size of the respective estimates.\n26\n(or fail to avoid) the RUSF depends on their short-term financial condition: firms rich in cash or cash equivalents ought to be able to avoid (or at least dampen) the e\u21b5ect of the tax increase by switching (at least partially) to cash-in-advance payment (for at least some of their imported inputs). As a result, RUSF-exposed firms\u2019 reaction to the tax increase should di\u21b5er depending on their short-term financial capacity. This channel would suggest that the above observed e\u21b5ect would be concentrated in liquidity-constrained firms that cannot avoid the tax. In contrast, RUSFexposed firms that are (relatively) liquidity-rich would either be una\u21b5ected by the shock, or at a minimum, be less impacted by the import duty increase.\nTo fix these ideas more formally, the next subsection presents the predictions from a simple theoretical framework (with the full model and calculations being presented in Appendix A), in which we focus on firm\u2019s sales to other firms, as this is what we can observe in data. In subsection 6.2, we take these predictions to the data and confirm that firm\u2019s liquidity constraints indeed amplify the impact of the shock, and this for both direct and indirect (supplier) channels."

The direct e\u21b5ect of a change in \u2327 on the firm f \u2019s unit costs can be approximated by:\nd ln cf d\u2327\n\u2327 = (\u23271 \u23270) X\nv2N\u2327\nv 1\n\u23270 \u2318Ff,v (17)\nwhere \u2318Ff,v is the share of f \u2019s foreign intermediates in overall cost of input v.\nThe corresponding e\u21b5ect for a firm with a low liquidity cost rf < r\u21e4 = \u23271 is\n(rf \u23270) X\nv2N\u2327\nv 1\n\u23270 \u2318Ff,v (18)\nIn both expressions (17) and (18), the direct e\u21b5ect of a change in \u2327 on firm f \u2019s unit (marginal) costs increases with the firm\u2019s exposure to international trade financing, which is represented by P\nv2N\u2327 v 1 \u23270 \u2318Ffv. Also, for a given exposure, firms that have low costs of liquidity will experience a\nlower increase in their costs as (\u23271 \u23270) > (rf \u23270).\nThe RUSF can also impact a firm\u2019s cost indirectly, through increases of firm suppliers\u2019 direct\ncosts caused by the increase of this import levy. The exact expression is given in Appendix A."

            "text": "Next, we analyze, in a simple network-production economy, the demand for a firm\u2019s output variety and the impact of a permanent change in an input cost on its sales.\nGiven its production function (14), firm f will spend a constant fraction v of its input purchases\non composite input v:\nPf,vXfv = vpfQf (19)\nwhich can be re-written as\nPf,vXf,v = p H f,vlx H f,vl \u2318Hf,v 1 1f,vl\n30\nwhere, \u2318Hf,v = 1 \u2318Ff,v, is the share of domestic varieties in material inputs, whereas f,vl is the share of the particular domestic sub-variety l of input v in the expenditures on domestic intermediates for composite input v, while xHf,vl denote the quantity of home (H) input v\u2019s sub-variety l used in the production of firm f \u2019s (only) output, and pHf,vl is its price. 31\nThis set-up allows us to derive the demand for a particular home sub-variety as a function of\nprices, elasticities, productivities, and other parameters of the model.\nConsider the demand for firm f product. Let Y denote global expenditure on domestic goods\nand final demand for domestic varieties be of the CES type \u2713P l (\u00b5l) 1 \"Q (xl) \"Q 1 \"Q \u25c6 \"Q \"Q 1 with \"Q being the elasticity of substitution in final demand and \u00b5l > 0. In what follows, we set \"Q = \"H to concentrate on the salient substitution across foreign and domestic varieties. Then, the final demand for an individual variety of firm f can be written as xf = (pf ) 1 \u21e3fY where \u21e3f =\npfxfP l plxl is\nthe fraction of total final demand expenditures for the firm f \u2019s product. Assume that each firm\u2019s output is used as a sub-variety to produce only one type of composite inputs v. Then, the total demand for a firm\u2019s product coming from final demand and the demand from other n 1 firms can be written as:\nQf = \u21e3fY\npf +\nnX g 6=f xgf = \u21e3fY pf + nX g 6=f \u2318Hgv gvf v pf pgQg\nWe can express the vector of firm sales pQ = [p1Q1 p2Q2 ... pnQn] T as\npQ = (I \u2305) 1 \u21e3Y, (20)\nwhere \u2305 is a collection of constants as well as domestic intermediates\u2019 shares in the production process and the shares of particular varieties in firms\u2019 expenditures on domestic intermediates, both of which are endogenous. The term (I \u2305) 1 in (20) summarizes all of the cross-e\u21b5ects that go through the economy.\nTo understand the e\u21b5ect of changes in the input cost (in our case, the increase in the RUSF levy on sales), let us consider a first-round approximation of firm f \u2019s sales based on the approximation of the inverse proposed by Waugh (1950). If firm f were to be the first firm, the sales are then\n31We assume that the rest of the world is providing the inputs and/or Turkish firms are buying domestic inputs at exogenously given prices.\n31\ngiven by:\np1Q1 =  1 \u2318H\n2,v 2,vf v ... \u2318 H n,v n,vf v \u21e3Y.\nThis gives the direct e\u21b5ect of final (first entry) and indirect demands (rest of the vector) for the firm 1\u2019s product. Assuming that Y is constant (i.e., no demand shocks) and letting pf \u2318 pHgvf , the first-round e\u21b5ect of a change in the RUSF, operating through changes in firm\u2019s costs, on firm f \u2019s sales is given by:\n@ (pfQf )\n@\u2327 = Y\n0 @ X\ng 6=f \u21e3g v\n\" \u2318Hgv\n@ gvf @pf + gvf @\u2318Hgv @pf\n# +\n@\u21e3f @pf\n1 A @pf @\u2327\n(21)\nThe e\u21b5ect above depends on the behavior of both the changes in the buyers\u2019 use of a particular\nintermediate among other domestic intermediates (i.e., @ gvf @pf @pf @\u2327 ), the general change in the usage of domestic and foreign intermediates (captured by the terms @\u2318Hgv @pf @pf @\u2327 ), and the change in firm f \u2019s final demand @\u21e3f @pf @pf @\u2327 . As a result, the RUSF change can a\u21b5ect firm sales in complex ways. That said, we can separate out here the principal cost channels through which these changes should operate.\nTo consider the most plausible scenario, consider a situation where \"H > 1 and \"X > 1.32 There is a negative e\u21b5ect on the firm\u2019s production costs due to the increase in the input prices (due to the RUSF levy). In the model, such cost increases are fully transmitted by the firms into their output prices (which is consistent with our results), @ gvf @pf < 0 as firm f \u2019s buyers will substitute away from f \u2019s variety towards other domestic varieties (see equation (36) in the Appendix). Moreover, as this would increase the overall price level of domestic intermediates faced by buyer firms, there would be some substitution towards foreign intermediates, as @\u2318Hgv @pf < 0 (equation 37). Final demand for firms\u2019 f variety also falls as @\u21e3f @pf < 0. Finally, for a given level of reliance on international trade financing subject to RUSF, firms with high costs of bank credit (i.e., liquidity) would be subjected to a larger fall in sales because they would experience a higher increase in their costs. These observations are summarized in the following proposition.\n32We are studying medium- and long-term e\u21b5ects of the shock (one to three years after impact). Hence, the substitution within domestic varieties (Broda and Weinstein (2006)) and between domestic and foreign inputs (see Imbs and Mejean (2015) or Feenstra, Luck, Obstfeld, and Russ (2018)) should be greater than 1.\n32\nProposition 1 Suppose \"H > 1 and \"X > 1. The impact of a RUSF change on firm\u2019s sales is negative for firms using international trade financing subject to the RUSF tax and, ceteris paribus, increasing:\n(i) in the initial exposure of a firm to purchasing foreign intermediates with international trade\nfinancing that is subject to RUSF,\n(ii) in the firm\u2019s liquidity costs, given the firm\u2019s initial exposure to international trade financing\nthat is subjected to RUSF.\nProof. See Appendix A.\nAnother relevant cost channel operates through domestic suppliers that relied on the international trade financing that is subject to RUSF and were hit by the unexpected RUSF increase. As their imported-input costs go up due to RUSF increase, there is an increase in their total costs generating a passthrough to the buyer\u2019s costs, which in turn a\u21b5ects buyer\u2019s sales.33 As a result, we can state the following:\nProposition 2 Suppose that \"H > 1 and \"X > 1. The impact of a RUSF increase on firm\u2019s sales through domestic suppliers is negative and increasing in:\n(i) the domestic input share,\n(ii) imported input share of the firm\u2019s domestic suppliers, and\n(iii) the share of domestic suppliers that face high liquidity costs, provided that at least some sup-\npliers that are exposed to RUSF.\nProof. See Appendix A.\nThe e\u21b5ect on sales to buyers a\u21b5ected by RUSF (upstream propagation of the shock) would be close to zero if the substitution of demand towards domestic intermediates and the concomitant negative e\u21b5ect on sales balance out (see Section A.3.3 in the Appendix) even if technologies are not assumed to be Cobb-Douglas.\n33Since the substitution between material inputs is not Cobb-Douglas, there could be also an e\u21b5ect on firms\u2019 sales coming from buyers (upstream propagation of the shock) that are exposed to the types of international trade financing subjected to RUSF. In particular, such buyers\u2019 own sales could be reduced (and hence rendering their input purchases lower), but at the same time they could substitute away from foreign to domestic intermediates, increasing their expenditures. Indeed, results presented in Table 3 suggest that this channel is not detectable.\n33"

            "heading": "6.2 Financial constraints and shock propagation",
            "text": "The simple model summarized in the previous subsection has clear predictions as to how firms will respond to the RUSF increase: (i) companies with no liquidity constraints will switch to cash-in-advance financing and avoid paying the higher RUSF import duty altogether, whereas (ii) liquidity-constrained firms will continue to rely on international trade financing that is subject to RUSF despite its higher cost after the shock. As a result liquidity-constrained firms will be more a\u21b5ected by the RUSF levy increase.\nIn our empirical setting, we define liquidity constrained firms relative to the mean liquidity measure for their industry (defined as one of the 22 two-digit-level NACE sectors) in the year prior to the shock. We measure ease of access to short-term financing with the average interest paid on existing debt calculated for 2010: total financing costs divided by existing debt stock, FCf,t=2010.34\nFigure A8 shows the distribution of the implied interest rate in the data. The average value of FCf,t=2010 is 16%, which is about 6 percentage points above the average deposit rate in 2011. Based on the value of FCf,t=2010, we split firms into two groups: constrained firms (Constrainedf,t=2010) have an implied interest rate that is above their two-digit-level NACE industry average; and unconstrained firms (Unconstrainedf,t=2010) have an implied interest rate below the mean.35\nWe augment our estimating equation (12) by adding the above-defined indicator variable for\nliquidity unconstrained firms (Unconstrainedf,t=2010), as well as its interaction with \u2327f .\n34In the absence of firm-bank-level loan data, which would have given us the marginal cost of new bank credit for the firm as referred to in our theory model, we have to rely on the average cost of debt financing, albeit at the firm level. We reduce the measurement error associated with this imputed cost of debt (that we calculate using the firm\u2019s year-end t = 2010 financial statements) by classifying firms into high- and low-debt-financing cost groups in their industries. The underlying assumption is that, if firm f is among those with an average high cost of debt in its industry, the marginal bank credit it seeks in the face of the unexpected RUSF shock will have the same average, or possibly even higher, interest rate.\n35The correlation between \u2327f and FCf,t=2010, conditional on industry and region fixed e\u21b5ects, is neither economically nor statistically significant. The result holds controlling for initial firm size and import intensity.\n34\nThe results presented in Table 4 confirm our prediction that financial constraints, in the form of liquidity constraints, play a role in economic shocks\u2019 transmission. The estimates presented in the last column suggest that the impact of the shock on the sales growth of financially constrained firms is more than three times higher than its impact on financially unconstrained firms: assuming the price elasticity of demand \"H = 5, the implied passthrough of tax onto prices is 2.3 for constrained firms compared to 0.5 for financially unconstrained firms. As for the other outcomes, the cost channel appears relevant here: estimates in column (2) suggest that financially constrained firms that were more exposed to the RUSF experienced a significantly higher increase in their input costs compared to financially unconstrained ones. Moreover, as presented in column (3), firms in the latter group were able to expand their domestic supplier network more extensively relative to the financially constrained ones within the same industry, which is presumably related to the ability to\n35\nbear search costs.\nWe subject our results to two robustness tests. First, Table A8 presents the results from a robustness check that uses an alternative definition of short-term financial constraints, namely the quick ratio defined as the ratio of the sum of cash and marketable securities (i.e., cash equivalents) and accounts receivable to current liabilities. The results are similar to the ones presented in Table 4.36 Second, we investigate whether allowing the pass-through rate to change with firm size a\u21b5ects our results.37 To do so, we add an interaction between initial firm size and exposure to the RUSF shock to the baseline specification. As reported in Table A9, this modification strengthens our main result that financial constraints, in the form of liquidity constraints, play a role in economic shocks\u2019 transmission.\nIn our model, the RUSF shock a\u21b5ects firm prices similarly to a (negative) productivity shock. The first order e\u21b5ect of our relatively small, non-localized shock on real output of an exposed firm is approximated by the Hulten result and is equal to the ratio of the firm sales to GDP multiplied by the RUSF price elasticity (see Appendix A.3.4). The RUSF price elasticities di\u21b5er depending on whether firms are liquidity constrained. The negative impact on real output of liquidity-constrained firms is, ceteris paribus, more than three times greater than that on output of unconstrained firms. Therefore, firms with financial constraints tend to amplify the shock\u2019s impact.\nA similar conclusion follows when we study how shocks are transmitted by suppliers. In Table 5, we turn our attention to the potential role of liquidity constraints faced by the suppliers and buyers of the firm. To do so, we distinguish between the liquidity-constrained and -unconstrained suppliers as well as buyers when considering the indirect e\u21b5ects of the shock: we create two measures of indirect exposure via suppliers (ExposureSuppliers,Unconsf,t=2010 , Exposure Suppliers,Cons f,t=2010 ) and do the same for buyers (ExposureBuyers,Unconsf,t=2010 , Exposure Buyers,Cons f,t=2010 ).\n36We choose the implied interest rate on existing debt as our baseline measure of financial constraints, as it better links our theoretical framework to the empirical results.\n37In a recent paper, Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2019) show that large firms have lower pass-through rates, and thus their sales respond less to changes in their costs.\n36\nThe results presented in the top panel of Table 5 suggest that the indirect e\u21b5ects are due only to financially constrained suppliers. The statistically significant coe cients on financially-\n37\nconstrained suppliers found in columns (2) and (4) indicate that their role in shock propagation is visible in the a\u21b5ected firms\u2019 input cost share and sales. In contrast, none of the coe cients on financially-unconstrained suppliers reaches conventional significance levels. We also note that previously observed lack of evidence for buyers continues to prevail when we account for liquidity constraints: we observe no statistically discernible e\u21b5ect for financially-constrained buyers.\nTo double check that we are really capturing the impact of suppliers\u2019 financial constraints rather than the e\u21b5ects of an omitted variable correlated with size (since access to finance is easier for larger firms), we include two additional variables in our regression specification: the size-weighted average exposures of the firm to its suppliers and buyers as of the year 2010.38 The results presented in the bottom panel Table 5 confirm our earlier findings. They suggest that the indirect e\u21b5ect is much larger for firm\u2019s cost of input purchases and sales when it comes from financially constrained suppliers. In column (4) of Table 5, where the dependent variable is sales growth, the coe cient estimate for ExposureSuppliers,Consf,t=2010 is equal to 11.4, whereas the one for Exposure Suppliers,Uncons f,t=2010 is equal to 4.2, with only the former being statistically significant at the conventional levels. The di\u21b5erence between the two e\u21b5ects is statistically significant as well.\nSummarizing, the results in this subsection support the theoretical predictions of our simple theory framework. They are also consistent with the view that liquidity-constrained firms magnify and propagate the perturbation downstream."

            "text": "This paper examines whether a relatively small and non-localized cost-push shock propagates in a production chain, and if it does, what are its short- and medium-run e\u21b5ects on the firms in the network. Such socks are typically di cult to discern clearly in the data. To identify the e\u21b5ects of the supply shock, we use an unexpected policy change in Turkey that increased the price of imports from 3% to 6% overnight. Given that this tax is based on the type of international trade financing\n38These variables are defined as follows: \u2327Suppliers,SizeWeighted f\n= P\ns !fs,t=2010 \u21e5 lnEmployments,t=2010 where\n!Sfs,t=2010 is the share of supplier s in firm f \u2019s total variable costs in year 2010; and Employments,t=2010 is supplier s\u2019s employment relative to its industry average as of 2010. Similarly, we define \u2327Buyers,SizeWeighted f\n=P s !Bfb,t=2010 \u21e5 lnEmploymentb,t=2010, where !Bfb,t=2010 is the share of buyer b in firm f \u2019s total sales in year 2010, and Employment b,t=2010 is buyer b\u2019s employment relative to its industry average as of 2010.\n38\nused, the policy change had a heterogeneous impact across importers, a feature that we exploit for identifying the impact of the cost-shock.\nThe results, based on detailed Turkish production network data, can be summarized as follows. First, we find that what is a priori a fairly benign policy change on imports has an economically relevant, even if temporary, impact on the directly-exposed firms\u2019 performance. Second, the shock leads to changes in the a\u21b5ected-firms\u2019 sourcing patterns: our analysis shows that directly exposed firms switch to local suppliers. Moreover, this switch is not limited to the short term, as it takes place over three years after the policy change. Third, the input-shock propagates downstream as exposed suppliers pass it onto their customers. More interestingly, indirect exposure through suppliers magnifies the e\u21b5ects of the tax increase over and above the e\u21b5ects of the firms\u2019 direct exposure. Fourth, propagation of the cost-push shock is amplified by liquidity-constrained firms.\nPut di\u21b5erently, our findings suggest that even relatively minor and non-localized economic shocks can a\u21b5ect open economies in ways that are non-negligible as they are transmitted over the production networks. The resulting impact is not limited to direct exposure only: indirect exposure through suppliers appears to be equally important in terms of economic magnitudes. Importantly, the relatively small shock that we consider changes the exposed firms\u2019 supplier networks: the affected firms switch from imported varieties to their domestic counterparts. The resulting e\u21b5ects on firm performance appear to be level e\u21b5ects, with the exception of the changes to exposed firms\u2019 supplier networks, which take place over a longer time period. A likely explanation is that the search costs involved in finding new suppliers: the observed changes in the supplier networks suggest that such costs are not economically trivial even in a domestic setting. We believe that quantifying the explicit and implicit search costs for substitute products and suppliers, which we do not undertake here, is worthy of further research.\n39"

(27)\nFirms are assumed to be perfectly competitive, and so the price that the firms charge will be\nequal to their marginal cost, pf = cf .\nA.2 Incorporating payment choice\nWhen firms import, they choose between paying immediately and delaying payment. By paying immediately, firm f incurs a financing cost, rf > 1 but saves on the import tax \u23270 > 1. Thus, the cost of importing sub-variety k to produce variety v is equal to rf \u21e5 pFfvk, where pFfvk is the price of the imported variety excluding the cost of financing or taxes. If the firm delays payment by using (RUSF-subjected) international trade financing, the cost becomes \u23270 \u21e5 pFfvk. The liquidity costs, rf , are drawn from a common and known distribution g(r) with positive support on the interval\n45\n(r,1) and a continuous cumulative distribution G(r).\nWe assume that firms already agreed on the optimal types of payment terms for each imported intermediate through bargaining with their international suppliers before the shock (i.e., at t = 2010). This gives rise to an exogenous firm distribution of exposure to the RUSF shock at the time of the policy change (i.e., at t = 0). For ease of exposition, we assume that for a given composite intermediate, the firm chooses one payment method. We denote the set of composite intermediates for which firm f initially pays the tax on all foreign sub-varieties by N\u2327 .\nA.2.1 E\u21b5ect of RUSF changes on firm costs\nThe increase in the RUSF rate from \u23270 to \u23271 leaves the exposed firms with a choice: for the next batch of goods to be imported, they can either switch to immediate payment or pay the increased tax. We assume that immediate (i.e., cash in advance) payment for the imported good results in a cost of financing rf for the firm, for example, due to additional bank debt it has to incur. As a result, the firm compares its cost of liquidity (rf ) to its cost of international trade financing that is now subjected to the higher RUSF tax (\u23271), and chooses the method that is lower. Given that firms are heterogeneous in the cost of liquidity they are facing, we can define a marginal firm that is indi\u21b5erent between paying immediately and delaying payment: r\u21e4 = \u23271. Firms with rf 2 [r, r\u21e4] choose to pay immediately, and others use international trade financing subjected to the higher tax to delay payment.\nTaking the logarithm of both sides of (26) and letting be a collection of parameters, we obtain:\nln cf = \u21b5 lnR+ lnw + NX\nv=1\nvPfv lnAf .\nNow, consider a firm with rf > r\u21e4 = \u23271, i.e., a firm that uses external financing when sourcing inputs from abroad even after the shock for j 2 N\u2327 . The direct e\u21b5ect of a change in \u2327 on the firm\u2019s unit costs, going through the imported input prices Pfv is (approximately):\nd ln cf d\u2327\n\u2327 = (\u23271 \u23270) X\nv2N\u2327\nv 1\n\u23270 \u2318Ffv (28)\n46\nwhere \u2318Ffv = a( ePFfv)\n1 \"X 1 \"F\na( ePF fv ) 1 \"X 1 \"F +(1 a)( ePH fv ) 1 \"X 1 \"H\n! is the share of foreign intermediates in the overall cost\nof input v for firm f .\nThe corresponding e\u21b5ect for a firm with rf < r\u21e4 = \u23271 is\n(rf \u23270) X\nv2N\u2327\nv 1\n\u23270 \u2318Ffv. (29)\nIn both expressions (28) and (29), the direct e\u21b5ect of a change in \u2327 on firm f \u2019s unit (marginal) costs increases with the firm\u2019s exposure to external financing, which is represented by the summation P\nv2N\u2327 v 1 \u23270 \u2318fv. Also, for a given exposure, firms that have low costs of liquidity will experience a\nlower increase in their costs as (\u23271 \u23270) > (rf \u23270).\nIn the model, firms are a\u21b5ected by the change in the tax rate \u2327 through two channels. First, a rise in the RUSF a\u21b5ects firms directly by increasing the cost of imported inputs. Second, the rise in RUSF increases costs faced by firms\u2019 domestic suppliers, which a\u21b5ects downstream firms\u2019 costs to the extent that the suppliers pass these increases onto their buyers. It is precisely through the latter channel how non-importers can be a\u21b5ected through the change in the RUSF tax. Firm\u2019s f price index for input j depends indirectly on \u2327 through the impact of RUSF on the price of domestically purchased varieties as follows:\n\u2713 @ lnPfv\n@\u2327\n\u25c6\nindirect\n= 1\n1 \"H \u2318Hfv\n@ ePH fv\n@\u2327\nePHfv (30)\nwhere \u2318Hfv = 1 \u2318Ffv is the share of domestic intermediates in the cost of input v for firm f and\n@ ePHfv @\u2327 = @\n\u2713PNH,v l \u21e3 pHfvl \u23181 \"H bHfvl \u25c6\n@\u2327 = (1 \"H)\n2 4 NH,vX\nl\nbHfvl pHfvl\n( \"H) @ \u21e3 pHfvl \u2318\n@\u2327\n3 5 .\nIn our simple framework, firms do not charge mark-ups, and any changes in their costs are\nreflected in their prices so that @pH fvl @\u2327 = @cfvl @\u2327 . The direct cost increase of each of the suppliers depends on their use of foreign intermediates and their liquidity cost, and these changes will be given by expressions similar to equations (28) and (29).\nCombining all above elements into equation (30), assuming that secondary and further network\n47\ne\u21b5ects (e\u21b5ects through suppliers of suppliers and so on) are negligible, the indirect change in the cost of firm f caused by a change in the RUSF is given by:\nNX\nv=1\nv 1\n\u23270 \u2318Hfv\n8 >< >: h (\u23271 \u23270) P l /2\u21e5fv fvl \u21e3P q2N\u2327,l q\u2318 F lq \u2318i + hP l2\u21e5fv (rl \u23270) fvl \u21e3P q2N\u2327,l q\u2318 F lq \u2318i 9 >= >; (31)\nwhere \u21e5fv denotes, for firm f and input variety v, the set of suppliers that face low liquidity costs, i.e., rf < r\u21e4, and fvl = pH fvl xH fvlP\npH fvk xH fvk\n= bH fvl(pHfvl)\n1 \"H\nePH fv\n, the share of domestic sub-variety l in the\nexpenditures on all domestic varieties in the composite input v.\nFor firm f , the indirect e\u21b5ect of changes in \u2327 on firm\u2019s f cost is increasing in the domestic input share of firm f , the imported input share of the firm\u2019s domestic suppliers, and the number of domestic suppliers that face high liquidity costs.\nA.3 The e\u21b5ect of RUSF on sales\nGiven the production function (22) for firm f , the firm will spend a constant fraction of its input expenditures on input v:\nPfvXfv = vpfQf , (32)\nwhich can be re-written as\nPfvXfv = p H fvlx H fvl \u2318Hfv 1 1fvl,\nwhere fvl = (pHfvl) 1 \"H bH fvlP\n(pH fvk )1 \"H bH fvk\n= pH fvl xH fvlP\npH fvk xH fvk\nis the share of the particular domestic variety l in the\nexpenditures on domestic intermediates.\nThe rest of the world is providing inputs and/or buying domestic products at exogenously given prices.

In what follows, we shall set \"Q = \"H . Then, the final demand for an individual variety of firm f can be written as xf = (pf ) 1 \u21e3fY where \u21e3f =\npfxfP l plxl is the fraction of total final demand\nexpenditures for the firm f \u2019s product. Assume that each firms\u2019 output is used as a sub-variety to produce only one type of composite inputs v. Then, the total demand for a firm\u2019s product coming\n48\nfrom final demand and the demand from other n 1 firms can be written as:\nQf = \u21e3fY\npf +\nnX g 6=f xgf = \u21e3fY pf + nX g 6=f \u2318Hgv gvf v pf pgQg\nLet us define \u21e0fg = \u2318Hgv gvf v and \u21e0f,f = 0; \u21e0f =  \u21e0f,1 \u21e0f,2 ... \u21e0f,n ; and\npQ =  p1Q1 p2Q2 ... pnQn T . Then we can write\npfQf = \u21e3fY + \u21e0fpQ\nStacking for all firms, with \u2305 =  \u21e01 \u21e02 ... \u21e0n T and \u21e3 =  \u21e31 \u21e32 ... \u21e3n T , we obtain\npQ = (I \u2305) 1 \u21e3Y, (33)\nwhere \u2305 is a collection of constants as well as domestic intermediates shares in the production process and the shares of particular varieties of firms\u2019 expenditures on domestic intermediates, both of which are endogenous. The term (I \u2305) 1 in (33) is the Leontief\u2019s inverse that summarizes all the e\u21b5ects that go through the economy.\nTo understand the e\u21b5ect of changes in the RUSF levy on sales, let us consider only the first-round\ne\u21b5ects \u2013 an approximation proposed by Waugh (1950).

If \"H > 1 and \"X > 1 then the e\u21b5ects of a direct RUSF cost-push shock on firm f sales are negative. The impact is higher for firms with a greater\n50\nexposure to intermediates imported on credit terms (claim i) and for firms with higher liquidity costs (claim ii), as their cost increase is greater. Q.E.D.\nOne can rewrite equation (39) as the elasticity of sales with respect to the tax separating it\ninto (i) the elasticity of price with respect to tax ( @pf @\u2327 \u2327 pf ), and (ii) the price elasticity of demand for domestic varieties (1 \"H), noting that empirically in our data on average \u2318Fgv gvf and \u21e3f are small.\n@ (pfQf )\n@\u2327\n\u2327\npfQf \u21e1 (1 \"H) @pf @\u2327 \u2327 pf (40)\nA.3.2 E\u21b5ects of RUSF through suppliers\u2019 costs\nProof of Proposition 2\nGiven the derivations in Section A.3.1 \u2013 equations (36) and (37) \u2013 it is straightforward to obtain the changes in firm f costs stemming from the RUSF cost of suppliers and substitute for @pf @\u2327 from equation (31). It is immediate that the impact of changes in \u2327 through supplier\u2019s costs on the cost of composite input j and then on total cost and sales of firm f is increasing in the domestic input share of firm f , \u2318Hfv (claim i); the imported input share of the firm\u2019s domestic suppliers (claim ii), and the number of domestic suppliers that face high liquidity costs (claim iii). Q.E.D.\nA.3.3 E\u21b5ects of RUSF through buyer\u2019s demand\nA buyer that is struck by a RUSF shock will substitute away from foreign to domestic suppliers; but if this increases their costs this has a negative impact on their sales. Indirectly, then, it will a\u21b5ect the demand for the domestic suppliers as well. These contradicting forces can be seen in the changes in firm 2 input demand from firm 1 in eq. (34) after a RUSF shock hits firm 2. Since @ fji @\u2327f = 0 because own RUSF shock does not a\u21b5ect the choice within domestic intermediates, we find\n@ (p1Q1)\n@\u23272 \u21e1\n2 4 (1 \"X) \u23182j + (1 \"Q) X\nk2N2\nk\u23182k\n3 5 1 \u23270 (1 \u23182j) 2ji j\u21e32Y\nand the resulting elasticity is @S1@\u2327 \u23270 S1 = h (1 \"X) \u2318F2j + (1 \"Q) P k2Nm k\u2318 F 2k i . If \"X = \"Q = 1 the technologies are Cobb-Douglas, both the impact of RUSF on substitution between foreign and\n51\ndomestic varieties and on sales are zero. But the opposing e\u21b5ects between the substitution towards domestic varieties and the fall in sales on firm 2 demand for domestic intermediates may also cause the net e\u21b5ect to be zero if \"X 6= 1 and \"Q 6= 1. Suppose that the share of foreign varieties in the production of composite varieties is equal: \u2318F 2j = \u2318 F 2k for any j, k 2 {1, ..., Nm}. Then if (1 \"X) = (1 \"Q) P\nk2Nm k, upstream propagation will be zero as well. Given our production\nfunction P\nk2Nm k = 1 \u21b5 < 1. This means that for a wide range of reasonable parameter\nvalues upstream propagation will be small or close to zero. For example, if \"X = 2 and \"Q = 6, and P\nk2Nm k \u21e1 1 3 .\nA.3.4 First order e\u21b5ects of a firm-level RUSF shock on real output\nOur constant-returns to scale final demand aggregator - measure of real aggregate output is\nU = max xl\nX\nl\n(\u00b5l) 1 \"Q (xl) \"Q 1 \"Q\n! \"Q \"Q 1\nsubject to the budget constraint P\nplcl = Y where Y is expenditures or nominal GDP.
