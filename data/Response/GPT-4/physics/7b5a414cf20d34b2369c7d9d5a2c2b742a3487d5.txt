Development of Next-Generation PSMA-Targeting Ligands with Enhanced Renal Safety Profiles: The study highlights the issue of kidney uptake as a significant concern. Future research could focus on designing PSMA-targeting ligands with modifications that specifically reduce renal accumulation without compromising tumor targeting efficacy. This could involve exploring different linker modifications, targeting moieties, or utilizing kidney-uptake inhibitors.

Exploring Alternative Radionuclides for PSMA-Targeted Therapy and Diagnosis: While Indium-111 has shown promising results, exploring the use of other radionuclides might offer benefits in terms of resolution, half-life, and therapeutic potential. Research into the use of alpha-emitters (such as Actinium-225) or beta-emitters (such as Lutetium-177) in the context of the optimized ligands described could provide insights into their therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles.

Combination Therapies Involving PSMA-Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals: The paper mentions the potential of combining PSMA-mediated radioligand therapy (RLT) with other therapeutic modalities. Future studies could systematically evaluate the synergistic effects of combining optimized PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or novel treatments like boron neutron capture therapy, focusing on maximizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.

Personalized Dosimetry and Therapy Planning Based on PSMA Expression: Given the variability in PSMA expression among patients, future research could develop personalized dosimetry models that take into account individual PSMA expression levels and tumor characteristics. This would involve creating advanced imaging protocols and computational models to predict the optimal therapeutic dose for each patient, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing toxicity.

Long-term Efficacy and Safety Studies of Optimized PSMA-Targeting Agents: While the current study provides valuable insights into the short-term efficacy and safety of the novel PSMA-targeting compounds, comprehensive long-term studies are necessary. These studies should evaluate the overall survival, quality of life, and long-term adverse effects of these treatments in larger patient cohorts. Additionally, investigating the mechanisms of resistance that might develop against these agents could lead to the discovery of new targets or strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance.
