            "text": "For more than a month, Iran has been convulsed by daily protests following the death in police custody of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, on 16 September. The\u00a0authorities\u2019 response has been brutal. More than 200 people have been killed and more than 110 students have been taken into custody. Many universities are, in effect, closed. Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran\u2019s leading centre for science and technology, has seen some of the worst crackdowns. Academic staff are conflicted about what to do. But silence was no longer an option for Encieh Erfani, a cosmologist who studies dark-matter candidate particles. On 23 September, Erfani resigned from the physics department at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences in Zanjan, and is now in a secure location.\nWhy did you choose to resign? After the death of Mahsa Amini, students were shouting: \u201cThe streets are covered in blood and our professors are silent.\u201d I teach students and I could not stay silent any more. The twenty-third of September is when schools and universities open in Iran. I have great memories of that day, ever since I was a child. I told myself: if I want to resign, I have to do it on this day. It does not make sense to continue.\nWhat is it like to teach and do research in Iranian universities? Iran\u2019s universities are under the control of the government. In committees that evaluate professors applying for academic posts, there are mullahs \u2014 clerics \u2014 evaluating you from the political point of view. Apart from the scientific evaluation, you have to pass a non-scientific evaluation concerning your background, your family, your political activities. If you pass the scientific evaluation but you fail in these respects, for sure you will not get hired. The pressure on women is much greater, because they check whether your dress code is according to the rules. You must be careful about what you wear, what you do, what you say. Talking about women\u2019s rights is not allowed. I am aware of sexual-harassment cases but nobody can talk about them.\nHow engaged are researchers in the protest movement? Professors are largely silent because the heads of universities are with the government. If professors join the students, they will get fired. Student protesters might be suspended for one or two semesters or, in a really hard situation, they might get kicked out of the university and have to transfer somewhere else. But for faculty members, if you get fired there is no job for you any more because you are on a government banned list.\nHow is this protest different from those in the recent past? Students used to protest for a few days and get arrested and everything would go silent again. You never used to hear about students going on strike. This is completely new. The other thing is the nature of the slogans the students are shouting. You used to hear calls to release imprisoned students. Now, they are saying: \u201cDeath to the dictator.\u201d Female students are now removing their hijabs inside the university. You never used to see that in a university in Iran.\nWhat is the significance of the crackdown on Sharif University? The government made a big mistake in attacking Sharif University. It represents the elite of Iranian science. All of us, during our schooldays, had dreams of going to Sharif. What\u2019s happening there makes all of us sad. Why have they done that? Just because of some slogan they did not like?\nWhat should the global scientific community do to help people in Iran? Policymakers are thinking about sanctions, but sanctions affect the lives of all Iranians. If I am denied an international bank account because of sanctions, I cannot pay registration fees for conferences overseas; I cannot receive international grants, pay for flights or book accommodation abroad. If I get financial support from any international organization, they have to pay me in cash. Getting visas is also a big problem.\nIn experimental science you need instruments, but we cannot buy them because of sanctions. Telescopes larger than about 35 centimetres are under sanctions, because it is deemed that they could be used for spying. Imagine, a telescope under sanctions.\nIf you want to impose sanctions, then impose them on the minister of science and education. The heads of universities should not get their visas easily and should not be allowed to be involved in collaborations. They don\u2019t have their positions because of their scientific ability, but because of their close relations with the government.\nInterview by Michele Catanzaro This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Mahsa Amini\u2019s death sparked protests in Iran and worldwide, such as in Toulouse, France.\n\u2018I could not keep silent\u2019: Iranian physicist resigns to join protests\nA LA\nIN P\nIT T\nO N\n/N U\nR P\nH O\nT O\n/G ET\nT Y\nEN C\nIE H\nE R\nFA N\nI\n430 | Nature | Vol 610 | 20 October 2022\n\u00a9\nSpringer Nature Limited.
