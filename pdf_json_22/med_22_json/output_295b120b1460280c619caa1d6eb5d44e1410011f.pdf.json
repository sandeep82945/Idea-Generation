The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical efficacy and seizure adequacy of sevoflurane, compared with those of thiopental, in the course of ECT in patients with mood disorders.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective chart review. Patients who underwent a course of ECT and received sevoflurane (n = 26) or thiopental (n = 26) were included. Factors associated with ECT and treatment outcomes were compared between the two groups using propensity score (PS) matching. Between-group differences were examined using an independent t-test for continuous variables and a \u03c72-test for categorical variables.\nResults: Patients who received sevoflurane needed more stimulations (sevoflurane: 13.2 \u00b1 4 times, thiopental: 10.0 \u00b1 2.5 times, df = 51, p = 0.001) and sessions (sevoflurane: 10.0 \u00b1 2.1 times, thiopental: 8.4 \u00b1 2.1 times, df = 51, p = 0.01) and had more inadequate seizures (sevoflurane: 5 \u00b1 3.9 times, thiopental: 2.7 \u00b1 2.7 times, df = 51, p = 0.015). Remission and response rates were similar in both groups.\nConclusion: The present findings indicate that sevoflurane should be used with caution in ECT and only when the clinical rationale is clear.\nKeywords: anesthesia, electroconvulsive therapy, depression, sevoflurane, thiopental\nINTRODUCTION\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide (Vigo et al., 2016). Despite a range of pharmacological treatments, 30% of patients show poor response (Rush et al., 2006) and are referred to as having treatment-resistant MDD. This group of patients may benefit from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\nAbbreviations: ATC, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical; c-CGI, clinical note Clinical Global Impression scale; CGIS, Clinical Global Impression\u2013Severity scale; DDD, Defined Daily Dose; DSM, Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; ECT, electroconvulsive therapy; EEG, electroencephalogram; MDD, major depressive disorder; PS, propensity score.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 933622\n(Weiss et al., 2019). ECT requires general anesthesia (Weiss et al., 2019), which affects seizure adequacy that may contribute to the clinical efficacy and tolerability of ECT (Kadiyala and Kadiyala, 2017). Intravenous anesthesia is commonly used in ECT. However, inhalational anesthesia would be preferable, specifically for patients with needle phobia, poor tolerance of intravenous induction agents, and agitation that affects their ability to cooperate (Rasmussen et al., 2005; Bryson et al., 2017; Erdil et al., 2017). Sevoflurane is the most common inhalational anesthetic used in ECT (Bryson et al., 2017; Aoki et al., 2021) because of its rapid and smooth induction (Loughnan et al., 2004). In addition, higher doses of sevoflurane may induce epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) (Gibert et al., 2012), which may improve seizure adequacy. Meanwhile, sevoflurane increases the expression level of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors in the brain (Murao et al., 2002) and shortens seizure duration induced by ECT (Rasmussen et al., 2006; Aoki et al., 2021). These factors may negatively affect seizure adequacy. Previous studies have investigated the effect of sevoflurane on ECT using a crossover design (Calarge et al., 2003; Wajima et al., 2003; Hodgson et al., 2004; Loughnan et al., 2004; Rasmussen et al., 2005, 2006, 2007; Toprak et al., 2005; Matsubara et al., 2012; Bege\u00e7 et al., 2013; Jadeja et al., 2014; Ulusoy et al., 2014; Erdil et al., 2015a,b, 2017; Pekel et al., 2016; Aoki et al., 2021). However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the effects of sevoflurane used throughout the course of ECT (i.e., when sevoflurane was used in all sessions of the course of ECT).\nAt our institution, intravenous anesthesia using thiopental (Nuzzi et al., 2018; Weiss et al., 2019) has been the standard protocol for ECT. However, sevoflurane is becoming increasingly popular as a standard because it facilitates rapid and smooth anesthesia induction. Therefore, we were able to compare the efficacy and outcomes associated with both anesthetics with minimal selection bias. This study aimed to examine the outcomes of sevoflurane used throughout the course of ECT, including seizure adequacy, and to compare them to those of thiopental use, using propensity score (PS) matching."

In addition, psychotic, melancholic, and catatonic features, as defined by DSM IV-TR or DSM-5, were assessed at baseline.\nResponse to ECT was assessed using the clinical note Global Impression Improvement scale (c-CGI) (Kaster et al., 2017), which is a 4-point scale, where 1 point indicates excellent response and 4 points indicate poor response. This scale has been used in previous retrospective ECT chart reviews (Kristensen et al., 2013; Kaster et al., 2017). Three board-certified psychiatrists (AT, TU, and HJ) retrospectively assessed the CGI scores and other clinical features based on medical records; the assessors were blinded to the type of anesthetic used; any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Remission was defined as a c-CGI score of 1 point, and treatment response was defined as a c-CGI score of 1 or 2 points; therefore, patients who met the remission criteria also met the response criteria."

In the present study, the number of stimulations, ECT sessions, and inadequate seizures were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the thiopental group. These findings suggest some disadvantages of the routine use of sevoflurane as a general anesthetic for ECT.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 933622\nFIGURE 2 | Receiver operating characteristic curve. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.696 (95% confidence interval: 0.582\u20130.81).\nECT is a treatment option for the most severe psychiatric disorders, making it difficult to conduct a randomized controlled trial on the impact of the anesthetic type used during treatment administration (Fond et al., 2016); consequently, we used PS matching in this study. Previous studies on the use of sevoflurane in ECT involved crossover or parallel randomized designs (Calarge et al., 2003; Wajima et al., 2003; Hodgson et al., 2004;\nLoughnan et al., 2004; Toprak et al., 2005; Rasmussen et al., 2006, 2007; Matsubara et al., 2012; Bege\u00e7 et al., 2013; Jadeja et al., 2014; Ulusoy et al., 2014; Erdil et al., 2015a,b, 2017; Pekel et al., 2016; Aoki et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of sevoflurane used during the entire treatment course on the clinical efficacy and seizure adequacy of ECT. This study involved a proper evaluation of matching (Ali et al., 2015), and the distribution of PS overlapped between the groups and covariates was balanced (Bergstra et al., 2019).\nAoki et al. (2021) performed a meta-analysis showing that sevoflurane shortened seizure duration and increased heart rate compared with other intravenous anesthetics. In addition, previous cross-over studies on the clinical effects of sevoflurane and thiopental (Rasmussen et al., 2006; Jadeja et al., 2014) showed that sevoflurane shortened seizure duration compared with thiopental. Although the duration of seizures was similar in the sevoflurane and thiopental groups in the present study, the frequency of inadequate seizures was higher in the sevoflurane group than in the thiopental group. The increase in the number of inadequate seizures associated with sevoflurane may have clinical implications. In fact, in our dataset, the sevoflurane group received more ECT sessions and ECT stimulations than the thiopental group. These increases may result in increased hospitalization duration and financial burden to both patients and healthcare systems. Furthermore, the number of stimulations has been associated with the risk of delirium (Tsujii et al., 2019), which is an adverse neuropsychological event. A previous study showed that the number of treatments was relevant to cognitive decline in specific cognitive domains such as autobiographical memory (Sackeim et al., 2007; Porter et al., 2008). Relevant to this evidence, increasing the number of treatments in the sevoflurane group may exacerbate cognitive decline caused by ECT.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 933622\nValues are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD unless otherwise indicated. The between-group differences were examined using an independent t-test for continuous variables and a \u03c72-test for categorical variables. SMD, Standardized Mean Difference; MDD, major depressive disorder; ECT, electroconvulsive therapy; GTC, generalized tonic-clonic seizures; PSI, Post-ictal Suppression Index; DDD, defined daily dose; CGI, Clinical Global Impressions; NaN. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005.\nMoreover, ECT causes generalized autonomic nervous system response, with initial parasympathetic-induced bradycardia followed immediately by a sympathetic response that results in transient tachycardia and hypertension (Ding and White, 2002; Uppal et al., 2010) and myocardial oxygen consumption increases (Ding and White, 2002; Uppal et al., 2010). An increased number of sessions may increase the occurrence of arrhythmias and cardiac overloads, which may be problematic, particularly in older adults.\nIn the present study, the sevoflurane and thiopental groups achieved similar treatment outcomes; this finding is consistent with that of a previous study (Fond et al., 2016), which concluded that the evidence to recommend a specific anesthetic for ECT is insufficient, and the choice should be at the discretion of the attending physician, given the adverse event profile and seizure duration. This approach makes room for the use of sevoflurane in this context (Andrade, 2021). Sevoflurane may be useful for patients who are agitated or afraid of injections (Rasmussen\net al., 2005), experience problematic prolonged seizures (Andrade, 2021), and are pregnant, as this agent helps reduce uterine contractions after ECT (Ishikawa et al., 2001; Andrade, 2021).\nThis study had some limitations. First, data were collected retrospectively, including information on treatment outcomes. Specifically, the retrospective use of CGI-S and c-CGI may attenuate the reliability of treatment outcomes. Future research may need a structured assessment of symptoms. Second, the time interval between anesthetic and ECT administrations and depth of anesthesia were not evaluated; all of these factors may affect seizure quality (Kranaster et al., 2013; G\u00e1lvez et al., 2016; G\u00e1lvez and Loo, 2017; Taylor et al., 2019). Consequently, we could not exclude the possibility that our results reflect differences in the depth of anesthesia rather than differences in the action of anesthetic agents. Third, we might not completely eliminate the other confounding factor that potentially affects the convulsion\u2019s quality.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 933622\nThe present findings suggest potential disadvantages of sevoflurane for ECT, as it may increase the number of ECT stimulations and sessions required and that of inadequate seizures experienced by patients. The present findings suggest that sevoflurane for ECT should be used cautiously and only when the clinical rationale is clear."
