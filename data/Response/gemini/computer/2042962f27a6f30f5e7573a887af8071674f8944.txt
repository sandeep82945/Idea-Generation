1. **Investigate the use of different program slicing techniques to extract contextual information.** The current study uses a single program slicing technique to extract contextual information. However, there are a variety of other program slicing techniques that could be used, and it would be interesting to see how these different techniques affect the performance of the NPR framework.
2. **Explore the use of different neural network models for the NPR task.** The current study uses a pre-trained language model as the neural network model for the NPR task. However, there are a variety of other neural network models that could be used, and it would be interesting to see how these different models compare in terms of performance.
3. **Investigate the use of different data sets for the NPR task.** The current study uses a single data set for the NPR task. However, there are a variety of other data sets that could be used, and it would be interesting to see how the performance of the NPR framework varies across different data sets.
4. **Explore the use of the NPR framework for fixing bugs in other programming languages.** The current study focuses on fixing bugs in Java code. However, the NPR framework could also be used to fix bugs in other programming languages, and it would be interesting to see how the performance of the framework varies across different programming languages.
5. **Investigate the use of the NPR framework for fixing bugs in different types of software systems.** The current study focuses on fixing bugs in open-source software systems. However, the NPR framework could also be used to fix bugs in other types of software systems, such as proprietary software systems and embedded systems, and it would be interesting to see how the performance of the framework varies across different types of software systems.
