    "abstractText": "\u03b13\u03b24 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been recognized as an emerging biomarker for the early detection of drug addiction. Herein, \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR ligands were designed and synthesized to improve the binding affinity and selectivity of two lead compounds, (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2, for the development of an \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR tracer. The structural modification was achieved by retaining the key features and expanding the molecular structure with a benzyloxy group to increase the lipophilicity for blood-brain barrier penetration and to extend the ligand-receptor interaction. The preserved key features are a fluorine atom for radiotracer development and a p-hydroxyl motif for ligand-receptor binding affinity. Four (R)and (S)-quinuclidine-triazole (AK1-AK4) were synthesized and the binding affinity, together with selectivity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR subtype, were determined by competitive radioligand binding assay using [3H]epibatidine as a radioligand. Among all modified compounds, AK3 showed the highest binding affinity and selectivity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR with a Ki value of 3.18 nM, comparable to (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2 and 3069-fold higher affinity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR in comparison to \u03b17 nAChR. The \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR selectivity of AK3 was considerably higher than those of (S)-QND8 (11.8-fold) and (S)-T2 (294-fold). AK3 was shown to be a promising \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR tracer for further development as a radiotracer for drug addiction.",

            "text": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channel receptors in the Cys-loop superfamily, which are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) [1\u20133]. The subunits of nAChRs can be alpha (\u03b12\u2013\u03b110) and beta (\u03b22\u2013\u03b24) subunits surrounding an ion pore. The nAChR subtypes can be divided into two classes, according to subunit assembly: homopentameric receptors such as \u03b17 and \u03b19 and heteropentameric receptors such as \u03b13\u03b24 and \u03b14\u03b22 [3]. The different subunit combinations bring about the distinct pharmacological profile of nAChR [1]. For example, the \u03b17 and \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR subtypes, which are expressed at high levels in the brain, are involved in neurological disorders (Alzheimer\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson\u2019s disease,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3614. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24043614 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3614 2 of 15\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and inflammation [4\u201310]), whereas the \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR is involved in depression and drug addiction [11\u201313]. Drug addiction, particularly nicotine addiction, is a worldwide epidemic that affects the lives of both smokers and non-smokers. The reward and reinforcement effects, through the mesolimbic pathway, and the aversive effects of withdrawal, via the medial habenulainterpeduncular (MHb-IPN) pathway, are involved in maintaining nicotine use [14\u201316]. Examples of subunits in nAChR subtypes that are mainly expressed in the mesolimbic pathway are \u03b14, \u03b16, \u03b17, and \u03b22 subunits [17], whereas \u03b13, \u03b15, and \u03b24 subunits are in the MHb-IPN circuit [13,18,19]. Human genetic studies showed that gene clusters expressing \u03b13, \u03b15, and \u03b24 subunits were associated with tobacco dependence and higher numbers of cigarettes smoked per day [20\u201322]. The expression of \u03b13, \u03b15, and \u03b24 nAChR subunits in the MHb-IPN circuit has drawn attention to the study of both \u03b13\u03b24* and \u03b15* nAChRs in nicotine aversion. However, some evidence supports the role of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b15* nAChR in regulating glutamate transmission [23] and that of \u03b13\u03b24* nAChR in regulating acetylcholine release in the MHb-IPN pathway [24\u201326]. The \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR expressed in the MHb-IPN circuit [14,27\u201329] has been reported to play a role in drug or psychostimulant-seeking behavior including nicotine, morphine, methamphetamine, and alcohol [30]. The \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR is not only expressed in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and the medial habenula (MHb), but also in the pineal gland, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus [31]. Several compounds are reported to bind with \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, including 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) [32], dextromethorphan [33], mecamylamine [34], SR16584 [35], (S)-T1 [36] and AT-1001 [37] (Figure 1). However, all of them except (S)-T1 and AT-1001 are non-selective ligands, which can bind with other subtypes or other receptors. For example, 18-MC can bind to an opioid receptor [38] and a muscle AChR [39], mecamylamine can antagonize several nAChR subtypes [40] and dextromethorphan can block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [41]. The selective \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR (S)-T1 and AT-1001 with Ki below 10 nanomolar were further developed to be \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR radiotracers by labeling with a radionuclide yielding [125I]AT-1012 [42] and (S)-[18F]T1 [36], respectively. [125I]AT-1012 labeled with 125I, a gamma-emitter, is a singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer, while (S)-[18F]T1 containing 18F, a positron emitter, is a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent. The selective \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR radiotracer is a tool for studying psychostimulant and drug-seeking behavior and drug discovery. Nowadays, the combined use of a radiotracer and a PET scanner is the most precise imaging technique to detect early-stage of diseases at a molecular level [43]. The scanner quantitatively measures biochemical and physiological processes by using a suitable radiotracer. The radiotracer comprises two parts: a specific tracer to localize a target or disease biomarker and a positron-emitting radionuclide, such as fluorine-18 (18F) or carbon-11 (11C), to produce gamma radiation via the process of positron annihilation [44]. The development of a radiotracer has three main steps: (i) design and synthesis of non-radioactive reference compound (formerly named cold standard), where the radionuclide in a radiotracer is a non-radioactive isotope; (ii) synthesis of a precursor for radiolabeling; and (iii) radiosynthesis or radiolabeling of a precursor to yield a radiotracer [45]. The starting point for the development of a new radiotracer is the design of a new tracer or search for available non-radioactive reference compounds with good binding affinity at a nanomolar level and high selectivity profile to a target (disease biomarker). In this study, four compounds (AK1-AK4) were designed to increase the binding affinity and selectivity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR. The designed structures were synthesized by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and evaluated in silico and in vitro for binding affinity and selectivity. The compound showing the highest affinity and selectivity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR will be selected as a non-radioactive reference compound for further development as an \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR PET imaging agent for drug addiction.\nInt.

Results and Discussion Four quinuclidine-triazole compounds (AK1-AK4) were modified by merging the structures of two lead compounds, (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2 [46], followed by single point modification (Figure 2) to improve \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR binding affinity and selectivity profiles. Two pharmacophoric features, a chiral quinuclidine ring ((R) and (S)) acting as a cationic center and a triazole linker acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor [47], were kept in the modified structures. The key functional motifs in the hydrophobic part of (S)-QND8 and (S)T2 were preserved: a hydroxyl group (-OH) for forming a hydrogen bond with the receptor [48] and a fluorine atom for further development as a positron-emitting radionuclide, fluorine-18. Besides retaining the fluorine atom and the hydroxyl group, the single-point modification was made by extending the hydrophobic part with a benzene ring at the hydroxyl function. The benefit of the added benzyloxy is that it can increase the lipophilicity of (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2 from log P of 1.87 and 2.03, respectively to log P of 4.03 and accordingly enhance brain penetration and subtype selectivity. The hydrophobic area has been reported to mediate nAChR subtype selectivity. The binding affinities (Ki) of AK1-AK4 and two lead compounds were presented in Table 1. All compounds exhibited binding affinity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, \u03b17 nAChR, and \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR in the range of 2.28\u20139760 nM. Comparing (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, the (S)-isomers of both AK1 and AK3 preferably bound to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, whereas their corresponding (R)-isomers (AK2 and AK4) selectivity bound to \u03b17 nAChR. The stereoselective binding of (S)-enantiomers to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR and (R)-enantiomers to \u03b17 nAChR agrees with previous reports [46,48]. This might lead to some limitations of this study. The data discussed stereoselectivity came from one core structure, which is a quinuclidine ring.\nFigure 1. Structures of (a) \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR ligands and (b) radio-imaging agents."

The selectivity of AK3 over the \u03b17 subtype is the highest with a 3069-fold higher affinity to the \u03b13\u03b24 in comparison to the \u03b17 subtype, whereas for all compounds the selectivity for the \u03b14\u03b22 subtype is much lower with a range of 10\u2013220-fold. Molecular docking of AK1, AK3, and lead compounds to \u03b13\u03b24 and \u03b17 nAChR homology models were performed to explain the remarkably high selectivity profile of AK3 to \u03b13\u03b24 over \u03b17 nAChRs.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3614 5 of 15\nThe molecular docking of new compounds and lead compounds to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR homology model showed that all compounds aligned and formed hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with amino acid residues in an aromatic cage located at the interface between the \u03b13 subunit and \u03b24 subunit. The protonated quinuclidine ring of all (S)-enantiomers pointed to Asp173, a key amino acid determinant to form a salt bridge and hydrogen bond interaction in slightly shorter distances than their (R)-counterparts, particularly of 1.74 \u00c5 of AK3 vs. 2.14 \u00c5 of AK4 (Figure 3, Table 2). In agreement with a previous report [48], the (S)-enantiomer of a quinuclidine ring allowed the docked pose to accommodate a salt bridge interaction with Asp173, the key determinant of the \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR binding. Other common key residues of \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR for binding are Trp149 and Tyr190 in the \u03b13 subunit for which the interactions can be observed to Trp149 and/or Tyr190 in the modified compounds. For AK1, the protonated quinuclidine formed a salt bridge interaction with Asp173, and the phenolic \u2212OH formed a hydrogen bond with Ser148. The additional interactions were cation-\u03c0 interaction with Trp59, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with Trp59, Trp149, Trp190, and Tyr197, and halogen bond with Trp149 (Figure 4A and Table 2). Even though the number of hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction of AK3 with key residues was less than those of AK1, the binding affinity of AK3 to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR (Ki = 3.18 nM) was found to be comparable to AK1 (Ki = 2.28 nM). This result confirms that the extending benzyloxy group increased hydrophobic interactions as designed. These interactions from the expansion contributed to the similar binding affinity and ligand efficiency (LE), a parameter to assess the binding affinity of different molecular weights, of these two compounds (LE = \u22120.52 and \u22120.51 for AK1 and AK3) (Table 2).

Therefore, the added benzyloxy group is the key contributor t the enha ced \u03b13\u03b24-selectivity of AK3 by provi ing the hydrophobic interactions with the \u03b24 subunit.\nFigure 3.

Orange and green indicated residues in \u03b13-principal and \u03b24-complementary subunits, respectively.\nMD simulation of AK3 to \u03b13\u03b24 and \u03b17 nAChRs was performed to gain more insight into the high affinity and selectivity of AK3 to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR (Ki = 3.18 nM, 3069-fold selectivity over \u03b17 nAChR). The strong interaction from the salt bridge formation between protonated quinuclidine and the carboxylate of Asp173, which appeared to mediate high affinity and selectivity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, was detected by MD simulation. Besides the salt bridge formation, the major interactions observed in the MD simulation of AK3 to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR are four \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between both middle and terminal benzene rings of the hydrophobic part of AK3 and residues Tyr93, Trp149, Tyr190, and Tyr 197 (Figure 6a). When compared with molecular docking, most of the interacting amino acid residues were the same (Tyr93, Ser148, Trp149, Ser150, and Tyr197 in principal \u03b13 subunit and Ala42, Trp59, Ile113, Leu123, Pro125, and Asp173 in complementary \u03b24 subunit) but the binding interaction types were altered, due to the flexible and solvated receptor in MD simulation. For example, the halogen bond between a fluorine atom and Trp149 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions of a triazole ring to Trp59 and Trp149 observed in molecular docking were replaced by additional \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions of middle and terminal benzene rings to Tyr93, Tyr190, and Tyr 197 in MD simulation (Figure 6a). Although the number of main interactions in the complexes of AK3-\u03b13\u03b24 nAChR and AK3-\u03b17 nAChR, were equal (four \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions), the salt bridge interaction between the protonated quinuclidine and Asp173\nFigure 3.

The results from both molecular docking and MD simulation supported the higher affinity and selectivity of AK3 to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR than \u03b17 nAChR.\nFigure 4.

A and B indicated \u03b13 and \u03b24 subunits, respectively.\nFor (R)-enantiomers, AK2 and AK4 showed lower binding affinities to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR with Ki values of 601 and 112 nM, respectively than their (S)-counterparts and the lead compounds. From molecular docking results, the ligand-receptor interactions provided by quinuclidine and hydrophobic pharmacophores of AK2 and AK4 were not different from those of AK1 and AK3 (Figure 3 and Table 2). Only the triazole ring pointed to a different angle leading to the lower number of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the triazole ring of AK2 and AK4 with \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR compared to their (S)-counterparts (AK1 and AK3) showing the important role of this moiety for the binding affinity (Figure 4). However, the (R)-enantiomers AK2 and AK4 bound to \u03b17 nAChR with Ki values of 4.49 and 53.6 nM, respectively, which are higher than the values of their (S)-counterparts (Table 1). The molecular docking to the \u03b17 nAChR homology model showed that the quinuclidine ring interacted with Trp149 and Tyr93, key determinants of the \u03b17 subtype leading to the high affinity of AK2 and AK4 (Figure 6). The key interactions of AK2 are strong cation-\u03c0 to Trp149, hydrogen bonds to Tyr93 and Trp149, and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions to Trp55 and Trp149, whereas AK4 bound to the receptor with the hydrogen bond to Tyr93 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction to Trp149 in addition to halogen bonds with Ser148 and Trp149 (Figure 7, Table 3). The absence of a strong cation-\u03c0 interaction of the quinuclidine ring together with the lack of -OH to form additional hydrogen bonds resulted in the lower binding affinity of AK4 compared to AK2. In addition, the extended benzyloxy group present in AK4 might have caused steric hindrance to the receptor, leading to a decrease in affinity. The higher binding affinities of AK2 than AK4 (Ki of 53.6 and 4.49 nM) were found to agree with the ligand efficiency (LE) of these two compounds: AK4 bound to \u03b17 nAChR weaker than AK2 (LE = \u22120.47 and \u22120.52, respectively) (Table 3).\nFigure 4.

The \u03b17 nAChR binding poses of AK3 and (S)-QND8 showed that the quinuclidine ring of these two compounds is aligned in different directions leading to the higher number of hydrogen bond interactions of (S)-QND8 (Figure 5B). Three hydrogen bond interactions of (S)-QND8 to \u03b17 nAChR are composed of the interaction of protonated quinuclidine to Asp164 and Ser166 and the interaction of -OH to Tyr93. Only one hydrogen bond interaction between protonated quinuclidine to Tyr93 was observed in AK3 resulting in less preference for the \u03b17 subtype. Hence, the extension approach, via the added benzyloxy group in the AK3 structure, significantly enhanced the selectivity\nInt. J. Mol.

Red circles indicate different interacting amino acid residues between MD simulation and molecular docking.\nFor (R)-enantiomers, AK2 and AK4 showed lower binding affinities to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR with Ki values of 601 and 112 nM, respectively than their (S)-counterparts and the lead compounds. From molecular docking results, the ligand-receptor interactions provided by quinuclidine and hydrophobic pharmacophores of AK2 and AK4 were not different from those of AK1 and AK3 (Figure 3 and Table 2). Only the triazole ring pointed to a different angle leading to the lower number of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the triazole ring of AK2 and AK4 with \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR compared to their (S)-counterparts (AK1 and AK3) showing the important role of this moiety for the binding affinity (Figure 4). However, the (R)-enantiomers AK2 and AK4 bound to \u03b17 nAChR with Ki values of 4.49 and 53.6 nM, respectively, which are higher than the values of their (S)-counterparts (Table 1). The molecular docking to the \u03b17 nAChR homology model showed that the quinuclidine ring interacted with Trp149 and Tyr93, key determinants of the \u03b17 subtype leading to the high affinity of AK2 and AK4 (Figure 6). The key interactions of AK2 are strong cation-\u03c0 to Trp149, hydrogen bonds to Tyr93 and Trp149, and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions to Trp55 and Trp149,\nwhereas AK4 bound to the receptor with the hydrogen bond to Tyr93 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction\nto Trp149 in addition to halogen bonds with Ser148 and Trp149 (Figure 7, Table 3). The absence of a strong cation-\u03c0 interaction of the quinuclidine ring together with the lack of -OH to form additional hydrogen bonds resulted in the lower binding affinity of AK4 compared to AK2. In addition, the extended benzyloxy group present in AK4 might have caused steric hindrance to the receptor, leading to a decrease in affinity. The higher binding affinities of AK2 than AK4 (Ki of 53.6 and 4.49 nM) were found to agree with the ligand\nInt. J. Mol.

A and B indicated principal and complementary subunits, respectively.\nIn terms of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of quinuclidine-triazole derivatives targeting \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, three components are required for high affinity and selectivity: the (S)-enantiomer of a quinuclidine ring, a triazole ring and a large hydrophobic group (extended benzene ring). Among four synthesized compounds, AK3 showed the highest binding affinity and selectivity to \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR, qualifying this compound as a non-radioactive reference compound for \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR. Therefore, AK3 is a high potential candidate for further development as \u03b13\u03b24 nAChR PET tracer for monitoring drug addiction, after replacing the fluorine atom with the radioactive isotope, fluorine-18."

Cells were collected, sedimented (800 rpm, 3 min), diluted with 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored at \u221225 \u25e6C until use. Frozen cell suspensions were thawed and homogenized by a 27-gauge needle and diluted with incubation buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl, and 5 mM KCl). The membrane suspension was incubated with (\u00b1)-[3H]epibatidine (0.3 to 0.6 nM final concentration; molar activity 2.22 GBq/mmol). Nonspecific binding was determined by co-incubation with 300 \u00b5M (-)-nicotine tartrate. The incubation was performed at room temperature for 120 min and terminated by rapid filtration using Whatman GF/B glass-fiber filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine and a 48-channel harvester (Biomedical Research and Development Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) followed by 4 times washing with ice-cold 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4. Filter-bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) were estimated from the competition curves by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software and the Ki values were calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation [49]."

The similar 3D conformations orientation within 2.0 \u00c5 were grouped as conformation clusters. The docked poses in the highest cluster as well as free binding energies (\u2206G binding) and ligand efficiency (LE) were analyzed.

The newly designed quinuclidine-triazole derivative AK3 showed good binding affinity (Ki = 3.18 nM) and a significantly enhanced selectivity \u03b17 nAChR (3069-fold). The structural features contributing to the significant improvement of affinity and selectivity profiles of AK3 are the (S)-enantiomer of the quinuclidine ring, the triazole linker, and the extended hydrophobic part for interaction with the \u03b24 subunit. The presence of a fluorine atom in AK3 provides the opportunity to develop AK3 as an \u03b13\u03b24 nAChRtargeted PET tracer. Therefore, AK3 is a promising compound for further development as a drug-seeking behavior monitoring agent.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24043614/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S., O.V., and K.A.; Formal analysis, A.K., W.D.-C., S.C., O.V. and K.A.; Funding acquisition, A.K., J.S., O.V. and K.A.; Investigation, A.K., W.D.-C., S.C. and K.A.; Writing\u2014original draft, A.K. and K.A.; Writing\u2014review & editing, A.K., W.D.-C., S.C., J.S., C.C., O.V. and K.A.
