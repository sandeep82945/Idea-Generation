 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Compare the network dynamics of cities in other major economies like India, Brazil, Russia etc. to see if similar patterns emerge. This can reveal interesting insights about growth strategies adopted by different countries.

2. Analyze the impact of specific government policies, trade agreements, infrastructure investments etc. on the network connections and economic growth of cities over time. This can help identify effective policies. 

3. Study the resilience of stable versus changing cities to economic shocks like recessions, pandemics etc. This can uncover vulnerabilities and guide policy. 

4. Use other network analysis techniques like community detection, motif analysis etc. on the city networks to identify clusters and analyze their dynamics.

5. Build predictive models using the network data to forecast future growth or decline of cities. This can support policy and investment decisions.
