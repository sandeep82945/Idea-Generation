Literature was searched from Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, from inception to Nov 1st, 2022. The risk of BCR was compared between PC originating from transition zone with peripheral zone. Relative risk (RR) was pooled in a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to assess the source of heterogeneity.\nResults: 16 cohorts and 19,365 patients were included. PC originating from transition zone was associated with a lower risk of BCR (RR, 0.79, 95%CI; 0.69- 0.92, I2, 76.8%). The association was consistent in studies with median follow-up time \u226560 months (RR, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.48 to 0.88, I2 56.8%), studies with NOS score \u22658 (RR, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.62 to 0.80, I2 32.4%), and studies using multivariate regression model (RR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.48 to 0.69, I2 23%).\nDiscussion: This meta-analysis supported that transition zone origin was an independent prognostic factor of a better biochemical result in clinically localized prostate cancer after treatment.\nSystematic review registration: 10.37766/inplasy2023.11.0100, identifier INPLASY2023110100.\nKEYWORDS\nprostatic neoplasms, transition zone, peripheral zone, prognosis, biochemical recurrence\n1 Introduction\nProstate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer in men and the sixth most common cause of cancer death worldwide in 2020, causing >350,000 death in men (1). In most men, prostate cancer is diagnosed while the disease is confined within the prostate (2), which is termed localized prostate cancer. Initial treatment of clinically localized PC includes radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy (RT), hormonal therapy, and deferred\nfrontiersin.org01\ntreatments such as active surveillance and watchful waiting (3\u20135). However, after RP or RT with curative intent, up to 27\u201353% of these patients experience biochemical recurrence (BCR) (6). BCR is considered as an early event indicating disease progression and is related to a higher risk of metastasis and disease-specific mortality. To estimate the risks of BCR, D\u2019Amico classification system was developed and verified. Now the derivatives of D\u2019Amico system are widely used in clinical practice (3\u20135). However, the best stratification and optimal treatment remain controversial (5).\nThe human prostate was histologically divided into transition zone (TZ), peripheral zone (PZ), central zone (CZ), and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS) by McNeal (7). Approximately 25%, 70%, and 5% of prostate cancer originate respectively from TZ, PZ, and CZ (8). Heterogeneity has been found between prostate cancers with different zonal origins. Compared with PZ tumors, most TZ tumors are usually diagnosed with larger volume and higher prostatic specific antigen (PSA) levels, but with earlier T stage and lower Gleason scores, indicating that TZ tumors might have better biological behavior. Some studies suggested that zonal origin in TZ was associated with a lower risk of BCR (9, 10). Conversely, other studies found no significant differences in 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival between TZ tumors and PZ tumors (11). Information about CZ tumors is limited due to scarcity (12). Therefore, the prognostic role of zonal origin in prostate cancer is still controversial.\nConsidering that most of the previous studies are retrospective single-institutional, we aim to conduct a meta-analysis of all eligible published studies to quantify the prognostic value of zonal origin in prostate cancer."

In the subgroup analysis shown in Table 2, regardless of the grouping variables used, I2 of the subgroups could not drop below 50% at the same time. In the metaregression shown in Table 3, regression model type (P=0.002) and NOS score (P=0.025) were found to be possible sources of heterogeneity, but the residual I2 was still high than 50% (64.45% for regression model type and 69.79% for NOS score), indicating that they could only explain part of the heterogeneity.\nResults of specific subgroup analysis were consistent with the overall analysis, supporting the prognostic value of TZ origin.

The result was robust in sensitivity analysis and no publication bias was observed. This association should be considered cautiously as there was high heterogeneity in the overall analysis (I2, 76.8%). Nevertheless, it was supported by subgroup analysis in high-quality literature with NOS \u22658 (RR, 0.70;\nfrontiersin.org\nJin e t al.\n10 .3 3 8 9 /fo n c.2 0 2 3 .12 4 8 2 2 2\nFro n tie rs in O n co lo g y\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\n0 4\n95%CI, 0.62-0.80; I2, 32.4%). To our acknowledgment, this was the first meta-analysis about the prognostic value of zonal origin of clinically localized prostate cancer. Our results suggest that the association of zonal origin with BCR merits consideration.\n4.2 Possible mechanisms for principal findings\nPrevious studies had indicated the difference between prostate cancer originating from different zones. In patients receiving prostatectomy (9, 12, 21\u201333), the ratio of TZ tumors ranged from 10% to 30%, compared with a nearly 70% ratio of PZ tumors. Most studies showed that TZ tumors had higher PSA levels, larger volumes, and a higher positive rate of the surgical margin. On the contrary, the pathological stage and Gleason grade of TZ tumors were similar or even better than PZ tumors. The difference in PSA level and tumor volume might be explained through diagnosis delay of TZ tumors because most of the included cohorts used transrectal systematic\nFrontiers in Oncology 05\nbiopsy, in which the detection of TZ tumors was more difficult (34). Therefore, TZ tumors tend to grow larger and give rise to higher PSA levels when diagnosed. The difference in pathological T stage could be explained by spatial location and prostate histology. TZ tumors are originally far away from the seminal vesicle and the prostate capsule. What\u2019s more, there is an interstitial band around the transition zone which may limit the spread of TZ tumor (35). As a result, it is more difficult for TZ tumors to invade outside the prostate capsule. However, the difference on Gleason grade has not been not well explained.\nRegarding the prognosis after treatment with curative intent, conclusions were not consistent. One explanation for this phenomenon is that most of the previous studies did not control confounding factors such as tumor stage, Gleason grade group, and surgical margin. Augustin (10) and O\u2019Neil (36) found that when confounding factors were controlled, there was no difference in 5- year BFS between TZ and PZ tumors. However, other multivariate regression analyses (25, 27, 31\u201333) support TZ origin as an independent prognostic factor. In our meta-analysis, when T stage and Gleason grade were balanced, the pooled RR was 0.57\nfron\ntiersin.org\nFrontiers in Oncology 06\n(95%CI 0.48-0.69), indicating that TZ tumors might be a different clinical entity with better prognosis, regardless of T stage and Gleason grade. It is worth noticing that the studies of Augustin (10) and O\u2019Neil (36) were not included in our final analysis because of new literature from the same center (9, 23).\nMolecular biology might help to reveal the fundamental differences between TZ and PZ tumors. Adler (37) used genomewide oligonucleotide microarray on micro-dissected normal prostate tissues from TZ and PZ. They found 351 significant differentially expressed genes. The most significantly highly expressed genes in PZ were mostly targets of ETGs, a transcription factor family which is associated with prostate cancer. Al Kadhi\u2019s metabonomics study (38) indicated that the pathway associated with lipid biosynthesis, with was considered a contributor to prostate cancer, was significantly enhanced in PZ. Guo (39) and Falzarano (40) found that the TMPSSR2-ERG fusion event, which was common in prostate cancer, was more frequent in PZ tumors. The expression of Ki-67, MMP-2, MMP9, p53, and Bcl-2 was also less observed in TZ cancer by Lee (27). Based on those findings, more mechanistic studies are needed to connect the molecular difference with prognosis.\n4.3 Secondary findings\nOne interesting finding in our meta-analysis was the different prognostic role of TZ origin between the high Gleason grade group and the low Gleason grade group. In Kim\u2019s (26) and Teloken\u2019s (9)\nfrontiersin.org\nstudy, prostate cancer was divided into the low-grade group (Grg 1/2) and the high-grade group (Grg 3/4/5). They both found that the prognostic value of TZ origin was only significant in the high-grade group. Our subgroup analysis had similar results, as shown in Figure S1. In cohorts with more than 80% of patients having Grg \u2265 2, the pooled RR was 0.74 (95%CI, 0.60-0.90), while in cohorts with less than 80% patients having Grg \u2265 2, the pooled RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.76-1.14). These findings suggest the prognostic value of TZ origin might be more worthwhile in prostate cancer with a high Gleason grade. Those intermediate or high-risk patients with TZ tumors might should receive less adjuvant treatment to avoid adverse effects. However, this conclusion needs more support because there are only two studies focusing on the high-grade group, and in most of the included cohorts, patients who received adjuvant treatment were excluded. In our literature search, no literature compared the oncological outcome of prostate cancer originating from transition or peripheral zone who received adjuvant treatment.\nAnother point worth discussing is that two of our included studies (21, 32) used lesion location on MRI to define TZ tumor. The definition of zonal origin through MRI or pathological sections was not a source of heterogeneity and the prognostic value of TZ origin was consistent in the subgroup using MRI or pathological sections. This supports the use of MRI because it is more practical and non-invasive. A few studies have investigated the ability of MRI to diagnose the location of tumors. In Shin\u2019s study (32), tumor location was verified through pathology, and the concordant rate between MRI and pathology was 86.2% (200/232). In Goldman\u2019s study of 64 men, the overall correlation was 89.1% (41). In Wilbulpolprasert\u2019s cohort of 415 patients, using whole-mount histopathology as a reference, the sensitivity was 79.1%(246/311) for PZ tumors and 73.1%(76/104) for TZ tumors (42). Overall, lesion location on MRI might be acceptably sensitive to predict tumor location on pathological examination but more research is needed.\nFrontiers in Oncology 07"

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First was the heterogeneity. Though we used subgroup analysis and meta-regression, only the regression model type were identified as possible sources of heterogeneity and they could only explain a limited part of the heterogeneity. Secondly, RRs were indirectly estimated from 6 cohorts, which might introduce errors. However, subgroup analysis showed that the prognostic value was still significant and not changed much when we considered the source of RRs. Thirdly, only one study of radiation therapy and no study of active surveillance were included, because there is a lack of relevant literature. As a result, our result was unsuitable for patients who received radiation therapy or active surveillance. We expect relevant research to fill this gap in the future. Finally, there was a language bias, since our search included only studies written in English. In the future, we plan to focus on the prognostic value of zonal origin specifically in highgrade group prostate cancer, and include high-quality studies to decrease the heterogeneity."

Prostate tumors originating from the transition zone might be a different clinical entity with a better prognosis. The biological mechanisms behind such correlation remained partially unclear, and thus better designed epidemiological and mechanistic studies were necessary to clarify the underlying mechanism. More radiation therapy cohorts and active surveillance cohorts are also desperately needed to verify the prognostic value of zonal origin in such patients.\nfrontiersin.org"
