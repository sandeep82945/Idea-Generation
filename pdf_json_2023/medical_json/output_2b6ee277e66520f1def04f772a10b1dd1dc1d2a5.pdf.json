    "abstractText": "Individuals with sickle cell disease are increasingly surviving into adulthood, many of whom have interest in future biological parenthood. Reproductive health knowledge is low among adolescent and young adult males and their caregivers. Their understanding of these topics is needed to optimize their reproductive health outcomes. As such, through collaboration with a community advisory board (adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease and mothers of adolescent and young adult males with sickle cell disease) and digital design team, we developed a web-based sickle cell disease-focused reproductive health program entitled FUTURES to address these knowledge gaps. For phase I of this two phase feasibility and acceptability study, adolescent and young adult males and their caregivers will complete a preand post-program reproductive health knowledge and attitudes questionnaire to assess change in knowledge. In phase II, after learning about fertility testing as part of the FUTURES curriculum, adolescent and young adult male participants are given the option to pursue testing. The two-phase study aims to: 1) develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a reproductive health web-based educational program at increasing reproductive health knowledge in male adolescent and young adult males with sickle cell disease and their caregivers, and 2) assess feasibility of fertility testing. The long-term goal is to improve reproductive and psychosocial outcomes among adolescent and young adult males with sickle cell disease.",

The ethics committee may be reached for data requests at IRB@nationwidechildrens.org.\nFunding: This study is in part funded by two grants (K08CA237338 & UL1TR002733) awarded to LN by the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer\n[1\u20133]. SCD is characterized by life-long, debilitating symptoms that lead to significant decreases in quality of life. Advances in medical treatments have led to substantial increases in symptom management and survival rates, with current life expectancy estimates ranging from 38 to 54 years [1\u20133]. Given the growing number of adults with SCD, there is an increasing need to examine and address the long-term effects of SCD and its treatments, including impacts on reproductive health outcomes. Further, multiple calls for initiatives to address gaps in SCD health-related knowledge have been made [4\u20136].\nThere are various implications that SCD and its treatments have on adolescent and young\nadult (AYA) males\u2019 reproductive health. Initial studies found that hypogonadism, defined as low sperm concentration and testosterone production, can occur in up to 25% of males with SCD [7\u20139]. Additionally, a recent study found that 91% of adult males with SCD and 100% of those treated with hydroxyurea, the primary treatment for SCD, had abnormal semen parameters, raising concerns that SCD and its treatments may increase the risk for fertility impairment [10]. This is notable as studies with other populations at risk for fertility impairment, such as male childhood cancer survivors, show that parenthood is a high priority and that infertility in adulthood is associated with psychosocial distress [11]. Finally, discussions about the genetic inheritance of SCD and contraception are also critical since AYA are at a developmental stage associated with romantic relationship development and sexual behaviors [12]. Research suggests low rates of contraception use and high rates of unplanned pregnancies among the SCD population [13, 14]. Despite increasing awareness about the wide spectrum of reproductive health implications of SCD, educational resources for these AYA remain limited, and those that exist exclude fertility-related content and/or do not target adolescents [15\u201317].\nA recent pilot study by the current research team examining reproductive health knowledge\nin male AYA with SCD and their caregivers showed that 85% of AYA expressed interest in having a biological child in the future [18]. Additionally, a large proportion of AYA (70% and 65% respectively) and caregivers (80% and 53% respectively) expressed unfamiliarity with the purpose and process of fertility testing, and a desire for more information about how SCD and its treatments may impact reproductive health [18]. Lastly, 50% of AYA and 40% of caregivers reported never having received information about the potential infertility risks associated with SCD and its treatments from a provider [18]. These findings highlight the need for efficacious, evidence-based educational tools addressing reproductive health topics for AYA with SCD.\nDeveloping culturally appropriate and accessible education tools on reproductive health is\nespecially important for this population, given the many barriers to care and knowledge that AYA with SCD face. Some of these obstacles include limited economic resources, lack of transportation to appointments, and low health literacy [3, 6, 19, 20]. Additionally, minoritized populations impacted by SCD often have poor patient-provider communication resulting in patients feeling ambivalent towards receiving medical care and unprepared for medical decision making [21]. AYA also report being uncomfortable discussing sexual health care with their provider because of the sensitivity of these topics, and physicians report lacking the SCDspecific knowledge and confidence to facilitate these conversations [22, 23]. Preliminary research has supported feasibility and efficacy of a web-based format for delivering sexual and reproductive health education in SCD populations [24, 25]."

FUTURES study team. To create a reproductive health education program that was comprehensive, culturally and developmentally appropriate, and engaging, a multidisciplinary team was assembled. This team included clinicians with expertise in reproductive health and SCD (a pediatric endocrinologist and hematologist), clinical research coordinators, a community advisory board (CAB), and a visual communication design team from a university. A CAB was included based on a lack of community-based SCD research and prior research indicating the importance of understanding the target population\u2019s perspectives and knowledge base to improve project outcomes [29]. CAB members included two mothers of male AYA with SCD and three AYA males (aged 19\u201321 years) with SCD. CAB members were invited by the clinicians based on their prior successful engagement in research and interest in promoting SCD knowledge in the community. The design team consisted of an English professor, two visual communication design professors, and an undergraduate student majoring in design. The three professors on the design team had previously worked with the hematologist on a web-based, health-related educational program about sickle cell trait [27, 30]. With their academic background in writing and visual rhetoric, they focused on creating effective and engaging digital health-related material through a user-centered design approach.\nFUTURES development. Initially, data from the pilot study [18] and recent literature [31\u2013 36] were used to draft the program\u2019s knowledge objectives. Subsequently, three, two-hour meetings were held with the research team in which CAB members provided overall feedback and suggestions regarding the drafted knowledge objectives, ideal program features (gamelike, intuitive technology, self-guided), and the comprehensibility of the content. Additionally, CAB members indicated that FUTURES would ideally be delivered in conjunction with a clinic visit and would last no longer than 15 minutes to ensure sustained attention.\nThe design team joined the second meeting to discuss graphics and interactive qualities to\ninclude. The team decided that having a) information boxes that would appear when certain figures were clicked (Fig 2) b) knowledge checks in the forms of multiple-choice and true/false questions to promote engagement (Fig 3) and c) answer explanations (confirming or correcting answer selection) to improve retention of the material (Fig 3) were important to include."

This is especially important considering the adverse outcomes on psychosocial well-being that can occur due to missed biological parenthood opportunities [38]. As such, FUTURES aims to educate male AYA and their caregivers on the potential fertility impacts of SCD and its treatments, genetic implications of SCD, safe sex practices, and the method and purpose of fertility testing. Additionally, this study aims to explore the feasibility of fertility testing at a local testing site in this population.\nFUTURES is a novel, comprehensive web-based educational program designed to address\nreproductive health-related knowledge gaps among male AYA with SCD and their caregivers. FUTURES was created through an iterative process involving the collaboration of clinicians, researchers, visual communication design experts, and community members affected by SCD to promote the efficacy of both content and format for those with varying levels of health literacy. Our ongoing study will assess the feasibility (recruitment rates and FUTURES video completion), acceptability (satisfaction survey), and efficacy (FKAQ outcome data) of this program among male AYA (aged 14\u201322 years) with SCD and their caregivers, as well as the feasibility of fertility testing (percent of participants completing testing and facilitators/barriers) for this population. While this study will be limited in scope (conducted at a single site with community advisory board members that are more engaged than the general SCD population), results will be used to inform programmatic revisions followed by larger, multi-site, implementationeffectiveness studies. Moving forward, the researchers plan to review associations between measures of healthy literacy and learning outcomes to see if additional actions need to be taken to increase knowledge. Anticipated outcomes of this line of research include improvements in reproductive health knowledge and psychosocial outcomes within this population and ultimately adaptations of FUTURES to support reproductive health care in other populations at-risk of infertility distress (e.g., female AYA with SCD and their caregivers)."
