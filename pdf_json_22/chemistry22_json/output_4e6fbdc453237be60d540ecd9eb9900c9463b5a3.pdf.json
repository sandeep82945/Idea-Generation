The mechanism of the oxidation reactions of Cl-VOCs over ceria is usually considered to be of the redox or Mars and van Krevelen type.\nes des Mate\u0301riaux (CNRSM), Technopo\u0302le, E-mail: gannoun.chiraz@gmail.com atalyse, De\u0301partement de Chimie, Faculte\u0301 e, 2092 El Manar Tunis, Tunisia\nof Condensed Matter and Nanosciences aterials and Catalysis (MOST)\u201d, Place -Neuve, Belgium\n0932\nThe key step of this mechanism is that CeO2 supplies active oxygen to the vanadium species that are reduced during the catalytic reaction.8\nHowever, the capabilities of the redox couple Ce4+/Ce3+ could be strongly enhanced if other elements are introduced into the CeO2 lattice. Among various elements, the introduction of zirconium in the lattice of CeO2 is particularly effective in the enhancement of the storage/release capacity and redox properties of CeO2.12,13\nOn the other hand, the combined TiO2\u2013ZrO2 mixed oxide has also attracted considerable attention recently as active catalyst as well as support for a wide variety of catalytic applications.14\u201320 In fact, it is established in the literature that mixing these two dissimilar oxides could lead to totally different physico\u2013chemical properties and catalytic behavior since they are liable to formnew stable compounds.21 Such advanced titania\u2013zirconia mixed oxides not only take advantage of both TiO2 (active catalyst and support) and ZrO2 (acid\u2013base properties), but also extend their application through the generation of new catalytic sites due to a strong interaction between them.21 In fact, the facile formation of zirconium titanate (ZrTiO4) compound between ZrO2 and TiO2 allows excellent catalytic properties for various reactions.21\nTherefore, given the favorable characteristics of zirconia, the aim of this work is to study the effect of the direct incorporation of ZrO2 in TiO2 and TiO2\u2013CeO2 aerogel supports prepared by sol\u2013gel route on the physico\u2013chemical and catalytic properties of supported vanadia catalysts in the total oxidation of chlorobenzene.\nTo determine the physico\u2013chemical properties of various samples elaborated, different characterization techniques\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

In fact, CeO2 is benecial for the specic surface area of TiO2 aerogel which increases from 115 m2 g 1 to 140 m2 g 1 aer incorporation of ceria. However, doping TiO2 with ZrO2 allows preserving its pristine specic surface area.\nFurthermore, the TiO2\u2013CeO2 sample exhibits specic surface area of 140 m2 g 1. A steady decrease from 140 to 94 m2 g 1 is observed in the case of TiO2\u2013CeO2\u2013ZrO2 aerogel support. The observed decrease could be due to the penetration of the dispersed zirconium oxide into the pores of TiO2\u2013CeO2 support, thereby narrowing its pore diameter and blocking some of the pores.23\nOn the other hand, vanadia based materials were found to display greater or quiet similar specic surface area than TiO2, TiO2\u2013ZrO2, TiO2\u2013CeO2 and TiO2\u2013CeO2\u2013ZrO2 supports.

According to the IUPAC classication,24 all the samples are characterized by the type IV isotherms (behavior characteristic of mesoporous materials) with hysteresis loops type H1 characteristic of porous materials.24\nIt is clearly seen from the pore size distribution curves of the supports that the modication of TiO2 by CeO2, ZrO2 or CeO2\u2013 ZrO2 contributes to the enlargement of its pors. The observed increase in the diameter of pores could result from the combination of different pore sizes derived from TiO2 particle and TiO2\u2013ZrO2 or TiO2\u2013CeO2 particle on the other hand.25,26\nAer vanadium impregnation, the average pore diameter of TiO2 increases leading to clear changes in the textural properties. These results could be attributed to the reorganization of TiO2 crystallites sizes aer vanadium impregnation.27\nIn the case of ceria rich catalysts, a decrease in the average pore diameter is observed which could be due to the plugging of the small pores by cerium incorporation.28 On the contrary, V2O5\u2013TiO2 and V2O5\u2013TiO2\u2013ZrO2 samples had narrow BJH pore\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

However, TPD prole of V2O5/TiO2\u2013CeO2\u2013ZrO2 revealed that the strength of strong acid sites was higher than that of V2O5/TiO2\u2013CeO2 since the NH3-desorption temperatures shied toward higher temperatures. Based on literature,43 strong acid sites which are present on the surface of supports improve the spreading of VOx active phase and consequently, could favour a better catalytic activity."

Especially, the reducibility of vanadium becomes more important in the VTiCeZr solid than that of VTi and VTiZr materials since TPR reduction peaks shied toward lower temperature. These observations suggest that the presence of zirconium species enhance the reduction ability of catalysts. Thus, the VTiCeZr material with better reducibility could indicate better oxygen absorbing capacity and hence could lead to a better catalytic performances.\nAer ceria addition, a new peak centered at 548 C appeared in the TPR prole of the V2O5/TiO2\u2013CeO2 which can be attributed to the reduction of surface Ce4+ to Ce3+.46\nFor ZrO2 containing materials, peaks revealed at 584 C and 578 for VTiZr and VTiCeZr respectively, could be attributed to the reduction of ZrO2.47\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

This was associated with the ZrO2 ability to modify sublattice oxygen into CeO2\u2013ZrO2 mixed oxides, generating defective structures and highly mobile oxygen atoms.49,51\nCombined with the XPS results, the good reducibility owing to the increase of the amount and the kinds of reactive oxygen species can provide a facile redox process that could contribute to enhancing the catalytic activity."

Fig. 8 presents the chlorobenzene light-off curves of the impregnated catalysts supported on TiO2, TiO2\u2013CeO2, TiO2\u2013ZrO2 and TiO2\u2013 CeO2\u2013ZrO2 in the range 100\u2013400 C by steps of 50 C. The reaction was run from 100 C to 400 C by steps of 50 C. At each temperature investigated, the catalyst was stabilized for 150 min in order to reach the steady state. CO2 is the main product. The carbon balance is completed with carbon monoxide, which is also produced especially at a relatively high temperature (from a few % up to ca. 30%). No other partial oxidation products (chlorinated or not) are observed. These observations hold for all the catalysts.\nThe VTi reference catalyst is almost inactive up to 250 C. However, it exhibits moderate activity above 300 C and merely reaches 55% at 400 C. The incorporation of zirconia into this catalyst brings a slight improvement in catalytic activity in the range (100\u2013250 C). This improvement could be attributed to (i) the better acidic properties, as shown by NH3-TPD results, which help the adsorption of the pollutant and/or (ii) the\n10930 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 10924\u201310932\nstabilization of the V2O5 active phase in a higher oxidation state, as demonstrated by XPS results. Moreover, the superior activity of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst in the range (300\u2013400 C) could be related to the higher V surface concentration in VTi sample than that shown by VTiZr as demonstrated by XPS results.\nOn the other hand, the V2O5\u2013TiO2\u2013CeO2 and V2O5\u2013TiO2\u2013 CeO2\u2013ZrO2 catalysts hardly convert chlorobenzene below 250 C and their activities increase with temperature to reach 100% conversion at 400 C. However, their behavior with the increase of temperature is quite different. Especially, at 300 C VTiCeZr catalyst converts 89% while VTiCe converts 71%. This observation pointed up the benecial effect of the introduction of zirconium groups into the binary oxide TiO2\u2013CeO2 aerogel support. In particular, according to XPS results, it seems that zirconia succeeds to stabilize vanadium at a higher oxidation state (V5+). In fact, in the case of VTiCeZr catalyst, ceria mainly exists in the form of Ce3+. The enrichment of Ce3+ could create a charge imbalance, and more oxygen vacancies are formed. This could facilitate the activation and transportation of active oxygen species. Indeed, CeO2 is a powerful oxidant for the regeneration of the V2O5 reduced sites. This higher oxidation strength of CeO2 assisted by ZrO2 induces a speeding up of the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism.52 This speeding up corresponds to the observed increase of the chlorobenzene conversion. This result correlates well with that obtained by H2-TPR. Particularly, VTiCeZr catalyst with better reducibility is the most active catalyst."
