    "abstractText": "Background Allosteric modulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is nowadays one of the hot topics in drug discovery. In particular, allosteric modulators of D2 receptor have been proposed as potential modern therapeutics to treat schizophrenia and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Methods To address some subtle structural and stereochemical aspects of allosteric modulation of D2 receptor, we performed extensive in silico studies of both enantiomers of two compounds (compound 1 and compound 2), and one of them (compound 2) was synthesized as a racemate in-house and studied in vitro. Results Our molecular dynamics simulations confirmed literature reports that the R enantiomer of compound 1 is a positive allosteric modulator of the D2L receptor, while its S enantiomer is a negative allosteric modulator. Moreover, based on the principal component analysis (PCA), we hypothesized that both enantiomers of compound 2 behave as silent allosteric modulators, in line with our in vitro studies. PCA calculations suggest that the most pronounced modulator-induced receptor rearrangements occur at the transmembrane helix 7 (TM7). In particular, TM7 bending at the conserved P7.50 and G7.42 was observed. The latter resides next to the Y7.43, which is a significant part of the orthosteric binding site. Moreover, the W7.40 conformation seems to be affected by the presence of the positive allosteric modulator. Conclusions Our work reveals that allosteric modulation of the D2L receptor can be affected by subtle ligand modifications. A change in configuration of a chiral carbon and/or minor structural modulator modifications are solely responsible for the functional outcome of the allosteric modulator.",

            "text": "Dopamine receptors belong to rhodopsin-like G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) and share the molecular architecture typical for this family of proteins. The gene for the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) produces two isoforms: the truncated D2SHORT receptor (D2S, UNIPROT accession code: P14416-2, 415 amino acids in length) and the D2LONG receptor (D2L, UNIPROT accession code: P14416-1, 444 amino acids in length), containing an additional sequence of a 29-amino-acid fragment in intracellular loop 3, ICL3 [1]. While presynaptic D2S receptors serve as auto-receptors in dopaminergic neurons inhibiting neurotransmission, D2L receptors are mainly postsynaptic [2]. Still, both isoforms are co-expressed in the\u00a0D2R-expressing neurons, share some pharmacological features [3\u20135] and support relevant postsynaptic dopamine functions [6].\nA promising way of targeting GPCRs and achieving therapeutic effects with diminished risk of side effects is the use of allosteric modulators, which are compounds that interact with binding sites that are topographically different from the orthosteric site recognized by a native, endogenous ligand [7, 8]. The use of allosteric modulators has advantages over classical orthosteric modulators,\namong them the increased selectivity for GPCR subtypes, the so-called \u2018ceiling effect\u2019 that prevents overdosing, and the allosteric probe dependence, which offers the possibility of introducing beneficial therapeutic effects without compromising the integrity of complex, physiologically regulated signalling networks. Since allosteric modulators are very sensitive to protein conformational changes, they also have been used to determine whether a particular mutation produces global changes in protein conformation [9]. Allosteric ligands can be classified into three types depending on their pharmacological action. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) can potentiate agonist-mediated receptor responses, while negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) decrease receptor activity. Silent allosteric modulators (SAMs) can target allosteric binding sites and block positive or negative modulator activity rather than modulate orthosteric ligand responses [10\u201314]. At dopamine receptors, all three modes of allosteric modulation are possible [15].\nA handful of ligands have been shown to modulate D2R by an allosteric mechanism. For example, the binding of sodium ions to D2R reduces its affinity for agonists by inducing conformational changes [16]. In contrast, the tripeptide proline-leucine-glycine (PLG) and a peptidomimetic, PAOPA, modify dopaminergic neurotransmission by increasing dopamine binding to D2R and prevent the conversion of high-affinity state to their low-affinity state [17\u201320].\nIn this study, we present an extensive in silico and in\u00a0 vitro investigation of allosteric modulation of the D2RLONG in complex with G\u03b1i1 and G\u03b1i2 proteins (DG1 and DG2) by compound 1 [21] and its novel derivative, compound 2 (Fig.\u00a01). Wood et\u00a0al. found that the R enantiomer of compound 1 does not directly stimulate the D2R, but potentiated the effects of dopamine. On the contrary, the S enantiomer reduced the effects of the PAM and the effects of dopamine. Finally, in radioligand binding studies, both enantiomers of compound 1 did not compete for the binding of orthosteric ligands. However, the R\n408 J.\u00a0\u017buk et al.\n1 3\nenantiomer resulted in a higher number of high-affinity sites for [3H]-dopamine, but did not affect Kd. Compound 2 was designed and synthesized by our group, and it is reported here for the first time.\nIn this work, enantiomers of compounds 1 and 2 were studied, and their effects on the receptor function were investigated. The rationale for our work is constituted by the limited data on structural aspects of D2R allosteric modulation, in particular regarding the structure\u2013activity relationship of the modulators."

The hypothetical allosteric binding pockets for the studied ligands were determined by docking performed by Molegro Virtual Docker 6.0 software [27] using the following settings: number of runs = 100; the maximal number of iterations = 10,000; the maximal number of poses = 50; and the poses representing the lowest value of the scoring function (MolDockScore) were further analysed. Molecular dynamics simulations were done in Gromacs v. 2018.4 [28]. An Amber03 force field [29] was used for receptors, Slipids (Stockholm lipids) [30] for the membrane and General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [31] for ligands. Ligand ESP charges were obtained by RESP ESP charge Derive Server [32]. Topologies were obtained with the ACPYPE server [33]. Each system was minimized for 500 steps and equilibrated in 1\u00a0ns NVT and 10\u00a0ns NPT simulations with protein and ligand position restrained by a force constant of 10,000\u00a0kJ/mol nm2 put on the heavy atoms. The most energetically favourable orientations (one for each system with lower protein \u2212 ligand interaction energy) were subjected to 1\u00a0\u00b5s all-atom molecular dynamics run\u00a0in triplicate. As a reference, these systems without modulator (with dopamine) were also simulated.

In particular, gmx covar and gmx anaeig were used for principal component analysis. For the first analysis, all trajectories were concatenated and analysed in a common subspace. For further analyses, trajectories containing Gi1 and Gi2 proteins were grouped separately to avoid G protein-dependent bias. Trajectories were fitted to C\u03b1 of the 7TM bundle (without ICL3). Analyses were performed on heavy atoms of separate helices.\nThe similarity analysis was performed using Canvas v. 4.2 [37, 38]. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were compared to the structures of 10,054 dopamine D2 receptor ligands with Ki below 10,000\u00a0nM as available in the CHEMBL database [39]. Hashed linear fingerprints and Tanimoto similarity were used.\nThe molecular similarity approach as incorporated in PASS software [40] was applied to identify other possible pharmacological activities, biological targets and adverse effects of compounds 1 and 2."

Competition binding experiments were carried out following previously described procedures [42]. In brief, cell membranes and 1.5\u00a0nM radioligand [3H]-Spiperone (76.1\u00a0Ci/mmol, 1\u00a0mCi/ ml, NET1187250UC, PerkinElmer, Madrid, Spain) were incubated in 96-well assay plates for 120\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C in incubation buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, 120\u00a0mM NaCl, 5\u00a0mM KCl, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1\u00a0mM EDTA (pH = 7.4)), in the absence or presence of compound or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). After incubation time, assay plates were filtered through GF/C glass filters and filters washed with ice-cold wash buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, 0.9% NaCl (pH = 7.4)). Nonspecific binding was assessed in wells containing 10\u00a0\u00b5M sulpiride ((S)-( \u2212)-Sulpiride, Sigma-Aldrich). Compound 2 was assayed at concentrations from 1\u00a0nM to 10\u00a0\u00b5M. The compound was dispensed into the empty assay plate using an acoustic dispensing noncontact instrument and vehicle (0.1% DMSO) was kept constant along the concentration curve. Nephelometry confirmed the solubility of the compound at these concentrations in the assay buffer and assay conditions, whereas 100\u00a0\u00b5M concentration was excluded from the assays due to solubility problems as assessed by nephelometry (NEPHELOstar Plus instrument, BMG LABTECH GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany), see Fig. S14. Haloperidol (SigmaAldrich) (0.01\u00a0nM\u20131\u00a0\u00b5M) was included as reference competitor in the experiments.\ncAMP assays at\u00a0 D2 receptors\nDirect D2 agonist or antagonist activity of compound 2 was investigated in cAMP assays on the cell line stably expressing the cloned human D2S employed in the radioligand binding assays. Previously described protocols were followed with minor modifications [42]. Cells were seeded in 384- well plates in assay buffer containing 500\u00a0\u00b5M 3-isobutyl1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (as inhibitor of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases, directly added as powder to the assay buffer). Vehicle (1% DMSO) or antagonist (10\u00a0\u00b5M compound 2) was added to the corresponding wells (\u201cantagonist mode\u201d) by traditional tip-based dispensing method. After 5\u00a0min incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 10\u00a0\u00b5M compound 2 or quinpirole (( \u2212)-Quinpirole hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich) at the concentration of 100\u00a0nM close to its\u00a0 EC50\u00a0and\u00a0prepared from aqueous stock solution, were added as agonists\u00a0to the corresponding wells (\u201cagonist mode\u201d). After 10\u00a0min incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 10\u00a0\u00b5M forskolin (from a 5x intermediate solution prepared in assay buffer containing IBMX and 0.5% DMSO) was added to the corresponding wells (\u201cagonist mode\u201d and \u201cantagonist mode\u201d) and incubation was continued for 5\u00a0min. After this time, cellular cAMP levels were quantified using the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based cAMP Gs dynamic kit (Cisbio, Bioassays, Codolet, France) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Basal cAMP levels were determined in wells in the absence of forskolin, both in the presence of vehicle and compound 2.\nPotential properties of compound 2 as allosteric modulator of D2 receptors were assessed by investigating its effect on dopamine response at cAMP signalling. Concentration (1\u00a0nM\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5M)\u2013response curves of dopamine (Dopamine hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich) (prepared from aqueous stock solution) were carried out in the presence of vehicle (1% DMSO) or 10\u00a0\u00b5M compound 2 on the cell line stably expressing D2 receptors indicated above. Cells were incubated with the ligands and 10\u00a0\u00b5M forskolin for 1\u00a0h at room temperature according to protocols previously described [21], and cellular cAMP levels were determined as indicated above. Basal cAMP levels were determined in wells in the absence of dopamine and forskolin, both in the presence of vehicle and compound 2. Individual concentration\u2013response curves were fitted to the model of sigmoidal dose\u2013response curve log(agonist) vs. response (three parameters) (Hill slope (nH) = 1) described by the equation Y = bottom + (top\u2013bottom)/(1 + 10^((LogEC50-X))) using Prism 7 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and pEC50 values for dopamine were extracted from the fitting. Dopamine response at concentrations EC80\u2013EC90 and EC30 corresponds to the experimental data points at the concentration of dopamine that elicited the response closest to 80\u201390% (or to 30%) of the maximal dopamine response in\n410 J.\u00a0\u017buk et al.\n1 3\nconcentration\u2013response curves of dopamine in the absence of vehicle or compound 2.\nThe solubility of compound 2 at the concentration employed in cAMP assays was confirmed by nephelometry, assessed as previously indicated (see Fig. S15)."

The resulting pose clusters were analysed. The most frequently occurring and best scored putative allosteric site was similar to that described in the literature [43\u201350], i.e. at the extracellular ends of TM2 and TM7. Therefore, this pocket was selected for further studies. As compounds 1 and 2 are close structural analogues, a similar binding site was assumed, which was supported by molecular docking. The most favourable orientation of R and S was with the benzothiazole group pointing to the extracellular side of the protein. The binding pocket of R1_DG1 consists of W2.60, V2.61, L2.64, V3.29, F6.51, H6.55, I6.59, Y7.34, T7.38 and Y7.42 (Ballesteros\u2013Weinstein residue numbering [51]). The most convincing docking poses (i.e. corresponding to allosteric ligands poses known from the literature, selected by visual inspection, with high scoring values) involved the formation of hydrogen bonds between the benzothiazole nitrogen of the ligand and Y7.34. In S1_DG1, the putative binding pocket consists of V2.61, L2.64, D3.32, V5.40, F6.51, H6.55, Y7.34, T7.38 and Y7.42.

To improve clarity, the Gi1-bound receptor was used as an example. The (S) enantiomer of compound 1, which is NAM, does not significantly drift from the initial docking pose, which is shown in Fig.\u00a07A. In turn, in simulations of its (R) enantiomer, both maintaining the initial pose and drift to other poses were seen, suggesting that the initial docking pose was not optimal (Fig.\u00a07B). The representative conformation of R1 modulator after drift from the initial pose is shown in Fig.\u00a07C. The pose is particularly interesting, as its analysis sheds some light on hypothetical mechanisms of its positive modulatory effects, as well as provides hypothetical explanation of different signalling outcomes of the two enantiomers of compound 1. In this pose, the methyl group at the chiral carbon protrudes into a hydrophobic pocket formed by F3.28, L3.31 and V2.57, resulting in favourable shape complementarity and removal of water from the hydrophobic area. In this particular conformation, the R1 modulator does not prohibit entrance of small molecule ligands into the orthosteric pocket. Moreover, its carbonyl group would serve as additional coordination of positively charged protonated nitrogen of orthosteric ligands. Binding of the (S) enantiomer in an analogical way would place the methyl group in immediate proximity of the aspartate 3.32, making the modulator binding much less energetically favourable. The binding of R2 and S2 compounds would also be less favourable, since N-methylation would affect possible direct or water-bridged polar interactions with Y7.43.

On the distance maps, points corresponding to values of 0\u20135\u00a0\u00c5 are marked as black dots, and distances between modulators and D2 receptor residues are surrounded by circles.

For this reason, to avoid domination of G protein subtype-dependent differences in the results, all further PCAs were done separately for Gi1 and Gi2 bound receptors.\nThe most pronounced differences between positive, negative and silent modulators were found in conformation of TM7. The first three principal components showed clear separation of these groups in most cases. Modulators seem to affect TM7 bending at the conserved P7.50, which was expected. Surprisingly, PCA revealed interesting patterns of the helix bending at G7.42, next to the Y7.43 residue, which is an important part of the orthosteric binding site. The bending seems to be coupled with conformation of W7.40, especially in Gi1-bound complexes, which is depicted in Fig.\u00a08. Measurement of \u03c71 dihedral of this residue, depicted in Fig.\u00a010, suggests that indeed it may be involved in the modulation mechanism, especially in case of the positive modulation by the R enantiomer of compound 1 and, to some extent, in NAM action of its S enantiomer.\n416 J.\u00a0\u017buk et al.\n1 3\nNotably, in all simulations of Gi1-containing complexes, the dihedral value oscillates around \u2212\u00a0180\u00b0/180\u00b0 (which corresponds to the side chain protruding toward the membrane) except of the R1 compound simulation\u2014in two of three replicas the dihedral is shifted to \u2212\u00a060\u00b0 for the major fraction of time (which corresponds to the orientation towards TM1 and TM2). Interestingly, compound S1 was able to induce opposite shift in one of replicas (from \u2212\u00a060\u00b0 to \u2212\u00a0180\u00b0 in replica 2). While similar effect was also observed in another simulation (R2_DG2), the latter was apparently of transient nature, while the former was permanent and persisted until the end of the simulation. In all other simulations W7.40 \u03c71 values seemed to be dependent on the type of G protein coupled, rather than on extracellular ligands. In Gi2-bound\ncomplexes, the most pronounced effect in both PC1 and PC3 was the TM7 orientation in relation to neighbouring helices\u2014both principal components indicate that PAM makes TM7 move closer to TM6, while NAM binding decreases distance between TM7 and TM2 (Fig.\u00a09). Importantly, PCA indicates that in trajectories with PAM bound, Y7.53 usually points to the protein interior, while in NAM and SAM-bound complexes it tends to protrude toward the cytoplasm, regardless of the G protein type in a complex.\nConformation of TM6 was also suspected to play a role, based on the previously described RMSD values. However, only in complexes with Gi1 protein bound different types of modulators were separated in the first two PCs to some\nFig. 9 Statistical analysis of relationship between modulator type and motions of TM7 in Gi2-bound complexes.

Analogically, high PC1 values and low PC3 values are characterized by decreased distance between TM7 and TM2\n1 3\nextent. Effects of modulators on TM6 in Gi2-bound systems in PCA were indistinguishable (data not shown).\nSimilarly to TM7, PCA of TM2 also provided interpretable results only in complexes with Gi1. In contrast to TM6, in most simulations TM2 assumed stable, nearly identical conformations, and only the second and third replica yielded decreased PC1 values, corresponding to a different helix bending. This analysis has also shown that differences in interactions of modulators with W2.60 may be responsible for differences in signalling outcomes (data not shown)."

Initial experiments aimed at detecting a possible direct agonistic or antagonistic activity of compound 2. For this purpose, cells were incubated for 10\u00a0min with vehicle (1% DMSO) or 10\u00a0\u00b5M of compound 2 and, after that, 10\u00a0\u00b5M forskolin was added to the cells to stimulate cAMP signalling for 5\u00a0min (\u201cagonist mode\u201d) (Fig.\u00a012A). Forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels were of the same magnitude in cells exposed to vehicle than in cells exposed to compound 2 (Fig.\u00a012A), indicating no direct D2 agonist effect of the compound. We did not observe specific effects of compound 2 on basal (not forskolin-stimulated) cellular cAMP levels either (Fig.\u00a012A). The possible D2 antagonistic effect of compound 2 was investigated in the presence of quinpirole, a selective D2 agonist. Cells were incubated for 5\u00a0min with vehicle (1% DMSO) or 10\u00a0\u00b5M of compound 2, and after that 100\u00a0nM quinpirole was added for 10\u00a0min before 5\u00a0min stimulation with 10\u00a0\u00b5M forskolin (\u201cantagonist mode\u201d) (Fig.\u00a012B). Under these conditions, 100\u00a0nM quinpirole reduced forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels to 62.5 \u00b1 4.0% in the presence of vehicle and to 73.5 \u00b1 0.9% in the presence of 10\u00a0\u00b5M compound 2 (t3 = 3.383, p = 0.0430, unpaired t test) (Fig.\u00a012B). This\nmodest yet statistically significant antagonism of quinpirole response by compound 2 could be related to the low D2 affinity of the compound detected in our radioligand binding assays. Higher concentrations of the compound were not tested in cAMP assays due to solubility limitations and because cell toxicity could not be ruled out based on the cytotoxicity data available (see Fig. S12 in the Supplementary Information).\nUpon these in\u00a0vitro findings and in the light of our in silico results, we aimed at investigate the possible functional consequences of the interaction of compound 2 with allosteric binding sites of the receptor. Hence, we carried out a detailed characterization of the effects of compound 2 on the response (inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production) of the orthosteric endogenous agonist dopamine in cAMP assays. In these experiments, we employed longer assay incubation times, which might favour the possible interaction of the compound with allosteric binding sites at the receptor.\nConcentration\u2013response curves of dopamine (1\u00a0nM\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5M) were carried out in the presence of vehicle or 10\u00a0\u00b5M compound 2 (Fig.\u00a013).

Dopamine inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in a concentration-dependent manner similarly to that in the presence of vehicle or compound 2 (Fig.\u00a013A), while compound 2 did not affect the potency of dopamine in these assays (pEC50 (mean \u00b1 SEM) = 7.14 \u00b1 0.11 and 7.00 \u00b1 0.13 for vehicle and compound 2, respectively) (t4 = 0.669, p = 0.5401, unpaired t test) (Fig.\u00a013B).\nAt dopamine concentration in its EC20 to EC40 range, which would afford maximal sensitivity for detection of enhancing effects by positive allosteric modulators [54], no PAM activity of compound 2 was observed (Fig.\u00a013A, C). Dopamine response (% Emax of dopamine in the absence of vehicle or compound 2) was (mean \u00b1 SEM) 29.4 \u00b1 4.5 and 30.7 \u00b1 2.8 for vehicle and compound 2, respectively (t4 = 0.2609, p = 0.8071, unpaired t test) (Fig.\u00a013C). Similarly, at dopamine submaximal concentrations (EC80\u2013EC90), optimal for measuring dampening effects by negative allosteric modulators [54, 55], no NAM effect on dopamine response by compound 2 was detected. Dopamine response (% Emax of dopamine in the absence of vehicle or compound 2) was (mean \u00b1 SEM) 89.5 \u00b1 0.3 and 90.3 \u00b1 3.4 for vehicle and compound 2, respectively (t4 = 0.1521, p = 0.8865, unpaired t test) (Fig.\u00a013D). A possible mode of action of allosteric modulators is to alter the dissociation kinetics of an orthosteric ligand. Yet with the limitation of possible probe dependence in allosteric effects. it should be mentioned at this point that radioligand binding kinetic experiments at D2 receptors revealed no effect of compound 2 on the dissociation rate constant (koff) of [3H]-spiperone (see Fig. S13 in the Supplementary Information). Therefore, following an experimental design that would favour the interaction of allosteric modulators with the allosteric binding site predicted by our in silico studies, compound 2 did not affect the response to the orthosteric agonist as it is expected for a silent (or neutral) allosteric modulator (SAM) [55], whereas a PAM effect was observed for compound 1R and a weak NAM effect for 1S by an independent group following the same experimental protocol to the best of our knowledge [21]."

            "text": "D2 receptor has been an important model system for understanding allosteric modulation of GPCR signalling [14, 56, 57] and\u00a0an important target for typical [58] and atypical [59,\n420 J.\u00a0\u017buk et al.\n1 3\n60] antipsychotics used to treat schizophrenia [61] and for therapeutic strategies in Parkinson\u2019s disease [62\u201364], as well as a target of interest in Alzheimer\u2019s disease [65, 66]. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of four ligands as allosteric modulators of the constructed full models of the dopamine D2L receptor in complex with a natural agonist, dopamine,\u00a0and with G protein (with G\u03b1i1 or G\u03b1i2 subunit). Although models of the dopamine D2 receptor in active conformation with or without the respective G protein are already available in the literature [67\u201369], this is, to our best knowledge, the first time the allosteric modulators were docked to full D2L isoform, including ICL3 loop.\nCompound 1, reported by Wood et\u00a0al., was the basis to design and synthesize compound 2 [21] to check its possible allosteric effect on dopamine D2 receptor. Detailed in\u00a0vitro studies of this compound in a form of a racemate, which included radioligand binding assay, functional studies, and kinetic assay, indicated that compound 2 may be a SAM of the receptor. It should be stressed that the probe dependence effect cannot be excluded in this case [70].\nThe models of dopamine D2 receptor used in our research turned out to be very similar to the corresponding X-ray structure, published relatively recently, PDB ID: 6VMS [25]. The observed RMSD may be due in part to the fact that the crystal structure contains a synthetic agonist bromocriptine. In addition, the crystal structure is a single frame of the studied crystal which does not reflect the actual dynamics of the protein, the quality of the model can therefore be regarded as satisfactory.\nThe availability of structural data about the possible allosteric sites of GPCRs is crucial for structure-based drug design [71, 72]. The comparison of available X-ray and electron microscopy structures makes it possible to distinguish the most common binding sites for GPCRs allosteric modulators. Firstly, in the transmembrane bundle, the allosteric sites can be classified into three groups: [73] (i) at the extracellular side of the receptor, (ii) at the central 7TM helical bundle and (iii) at the intracellular side of the receptors [72]. Recently, Xiao et\u00a0al. [74] described a dopamine D1\u2013Gs complex simultaneously bound to dopamine in the orthosteric site and the PAM LY3154207 in an intracellular allosteric pocket [75]. This allosteric binding pocket at D1 receptor was confirmed by Zhuang et\u00a0al. [76]. Such intracellular allosteric binding sites are also known for other GPCRs (class A chemokine CCR2 [77], CCR7 [78] and CCR9, [79] and \u03b22AR receptors [80]) and are possible but have been not experimentally verified yet for D2-like receptors. Moreover, the allosteric sites at the receptor\u2013lipid bilayer interface are situated at various faces of the receptor [72].\nThere are few literature reports on molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations of allosteric modulators of dopamine D2 receptor [45, 47\u201349]. In these studies, SB269652, a bitopic ligand which interacts with both the\northosteric binding site and a secondary binding pocket in both D2R and D3R, was described as a NAM. The secondary binding pocket was identified between TM2 and TM7, similarly to the allosteric site in our work. Importantly, selected residues of dopamine D2 receptor were mutated to indicate which of them affect binding and functional properties of SB269652. It was also found that SB269652 exerts allostery across the D2R dimer. A similar secondary binding pocket has been recently found for dopamine D3 receptor [43]. As there is no structural similarity between compounds 1 and 2 and SB269652 and similarly acting compounds [81], in particular compounds 1 and 2 cannot be considered bitopic ligands, their allosteric effect results rather from the interaction with the receptor monomer, not a dimer.\nIn this work, we used molecular docking approach to identify the region of the receptor that is most likely involved in the binding of allosteric modulators. The position of the allosteric pocket depended on the type of model used. In DG1, all modulators bound deeper into the receptor, just above dopamine, while ligands in the DG2 model bound closer to the extracellular part of the receptor. During molecular dynamics simulations, ligands bound to DG2 migrated into lower binding pockets.\nThe examined RMSD values for individual helices allowed determining the most dynamic receptor structures. In particular, TM5, TM6 and TM7 movements turned out to be significant in the MD study of allosteric modulation of the ligands used. The results obtained in this study explain the phenomena of positive modulation with the R1 ligand in DG1 and DG2. Because of rotameric transitions of Y5.58 and Y7.53, their side chains can be placed within the space emptied by the outward movement of TM6. Thus, rearrangement of these residues appears to stabilize the receptor in its active conformation by structural water-mediated hydrogen bond network [82, 83]. Whereas the hydrogen bond between Y5.58 and Y7.53 remained stable throughout the simulation with R1, modulator S1 caused a larger fluctuation and increase in the distance between these residues. Furthermore, in the case of S1, the organization of TM5, TM6 and TM7 differs significantly. We also examined the behaviour of several microswitches, which are important for the GPCR activation process. We analysed changes in the dihedral angle of the conserved W6.48 [83\u201386], F6.44 (called transmission switch) [87\u201389], Y7.53 of NPxxY motif [90], and H6.55 (a crucial residue for dopamine D2 receptor activation [91, 92]). The \u03b15 helix of the G\u03b1 subunit is a critical region for the receptor-mediated and basal activity [93, 94]. Therefore, we used MD simulations to investigate how the studied modulators affect the interactions with the G\u03b1i1 and G\u03b1i2 proteins and receptor activation processes. This observation indicates that changes in the position of \u03b15-G\u03b1 helix are slight, but sufficient to determine the type of\n421Allosteric modulation of\u00a0dopamine D2L receptor in\u00a0complex with\u00a0 Gi1 and\u00a0 Gi2 proteins:\u2026\n1 3\nmodulation. The R1 modulator stabilizes the C-terminus of G\u03b1i proteins in a position into the binding pocket higher than the S1 modulator. In contrast to R1 and S1, in this study, we did not observe significant differences in the action of R2 and S2 compared to the dopamine receptor simulations.\nFinally, we performed principal component analysis to detect\u2014in a statistical manner\u2014the relationships between modulator structures and receptor conformation. The most pronounced changes were found in TM7 with helix bending at P7.50 and G7.42 situated near Y7.43, an important component of the orthosteric binding site. Importantly, PCA indicates that conformation of the Y7.53, which is a part of the NPxxY motif and conserved in Class A GPCRs, is affected by the enantiomers of compound 1 in opposite ways, which is in line with their signalling outcomes observed in in\u00a0vitro assays and therefore serves as a validation of the in silico part of the study. Notably, in all these analyses, conformations of compound 2 complexes assume intermediate conformations, in between extremes explored by NAM and PAM enantiomers of compound 1, which, together with in\u00a0vitro results, supports the conclusion that compound 2 does not affect conformational space explored by the receptor upon binding, i.e. behaves like SAM. Moreover, PCA allows drawing more general conclusions on mechanisms employed by all the investigated compounds. There is apparent difference in the receptor response depending on the Gi protein subtype bound. While differences revealed by the PCA of all trajectories in the common subspace (Fig. S11) can be considered as an artefact originating in modelling and equilibration steps, different sensitivity of TM2 and TM6 to the modulators in Gi1 and Gi2-bound complexes may indicate possible allosteric functional selectivity, which points to new directions for further studies of these modulators. Additionally, PCAs suggest a role of particular residues that are possibly involved in the allosteric signal transmission. In particular, W7.40 conformation seems to be affected by the presence of the PAM compound (Fig.\u00a010).\nIn summary, the in silico results obtained in this work show that the R1 and S1 are able to bind in an allosteric site of the D2R and thereby promote conformational changes of helical bundle that can be associated with the transition towards an active or inactive state, respectively. In case of R2 and S2, the binding to the D2R in the allosteric pocket is devoid of significant influence on the receptor activation mechanism which is supported by in\u00a0vitro data. Our work indicates that the allosterism at GPCRs, in particular at dopamine D2 receptor, is governed by subtle structural and stereochemical ligand modifications, which significantly hampers the efforts to obtain a series of modulators to study their SAR.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s43440- 021- 00352-x.\nAuthor contributions AAK: conceptualization; J\u017b, DB, AGS, MP, OK, TMW: investigation; J\u017b, DB, AGS, MP, OK, MC and AAK: methodology; AAK and MC: supervision; J\u017b, DB, AGS and TMW: visualization; J\u017b, DB, AGS, OK, TMW, MC and AAK: writing\u2014original draft; J\u017b, DB, AGS, MP, OK, TMW, DM, MC and AAK: writing\u2014review and editing.\nFunding The research was performed under OPUS grant from National Science Center (NCN, Poland), grant number 2017/27/B/NZ7/01767 (to A.A.K.).
