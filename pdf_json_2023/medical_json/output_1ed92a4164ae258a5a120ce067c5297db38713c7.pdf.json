The diagnoses give affected individuals and their families access to resources, prognosis, and available treatments. There is an increasing use of expert systems to support syndrome diagnosis, including computer databases and analytic software, but also human expert and online services [1].\nThe aim of this study is to show how syndrome similarity analysis using given phenotypic profiles containing observable characteristics can help diagnose rare diseases (RD). This study describes a feasible system architecture to be used as an interoperable module of a case-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) for unclear diseases."

One ontology that covers a wide range of bioinformatics resources for human disease analysis, especially RDs, is the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) [2]. Complete phenotypic profiles on RDs can be accessed via Monarch [3] or HPO [2].\nThe selection of the similarity algorithm is crucial for the quality of the analysis. For HPO, there is the Python library pyhpo [4], which is open source and offers the possibility to define and compare different symptom sets. This functionality enables the module to compare syndromes of a new patient with given phenotypic profiles of RDs.\nThe usage of the HL7 data exchange standard FHIR ensures interoperability.\n1 Corresponding Author: Richard Noll, Institute of Medical Informatics, Goethe University Frankfurt, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; E-mail: richard.noll@kgu.de."

In addition to the calculated percentage similarity, further information such as the indication of identical, similar, or missing symptoms to the different phenotypic profiles is conceivable as an output."

This study shows such an algorithm in conjunction with FHIR.\nThe advantage of an interoperable module over an isolated web-based platform is the cross-system operability and the possibility of a combined analysis of symptoms along with additional characteristics such as demographic data or laboratory tests to accumulate distinctive information and make an accurate differential diagnosis."
