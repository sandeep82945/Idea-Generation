AuSn4 is, contrary to PtSn4, superconducting with a critical temperature of Tc = 2.35 K. Recent measurements present indications for quasi-two-dimensional superconducting behavior in AuSn4. Here we present measurements of the superconducting density of states and the band structure of AuSn4 through scanning tunneling microscopy and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The superconducting gap values in different portions of the Fermi surface are spread around 0 = 0.4 meV, which is close to but somewhat larger than = 1.76kBTc expected from BCS theory. We observe superconducting features in the tunneling conductance at the surface up to temperatures about 20% larger than bulk Tc. The band structure calculated with density functional theory follows well the results of ARPES. The crystal structure presents two possible stackings of Sn layers, giving two nearly degenerate polytypes. This makes AuSn4 a rather unique case with a three-dimensional electronic band structure but properties ressembling those of low-dimensional layered compounds.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.024804\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTopological insulators host interesting surface states with nontrivial electronic properties, such as dissipationless charge and spin transport along surface channels [1]. The combination of superconductivity with topological insulators is expected to produce novel behavior, for instance, with nonAbelian modes, thanks to the combination of edge conduction channels and the electron-hole symmetry of the superconducting state [2,3]. However, superconductivity requires a finite density of states at the Fermi level, which can only be obtained by closing the bulk insulating gap. There is a growing set of semimetallic systems with a finite density of states at the Fermi level that might host nontrivial topological properties, but only a few are superconducting too [4\u20136].\nOften, semimetals with potentially topological crossings in the band structure also present a huge magnetoresistance (MR) [7\u201310]. Among such systems, PtSn4 and PdSn4 stand out because of reports connecting topological properties of the band structure with a three orders of magnitude increase in the resistance between zero field and 14 T [11\u201313]. In addition, the surface of PtSn4 presents Dirac node arcs which consist of a linear dispersion extending over a portion of the Brillouin zone [14]. PtSn4 and PdSn4 are not superconducting,\n*Corresponding author: edwin.herrera@uam.es\nbut AuSn4 is superconducting with a critical temperature of Tc = 2.35 K [15]. The question if superconductivity in AuSn4 is unconventional is important in the light of the anomalous band structure properties of PtSn4 and PdSn4 [16\u201318]. A recent examination of the bulk and transport properties of single crystals of AuSn4 provides a clear specific heat jump at the superconducting transition. The proposed magnetic-field temperature phase diagram provides indications for twodimensional superconductivity in AuSn4 [16\u201318].\nHere we analyze the normal state and superconducting properties of AuSn4. We grow single crystals of AuSn4 and characterize them using x-ray diffraction and resistivity. We measure the superconducting properties with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and the electronic band structure with angular resolved photoemission (ARPES). The superconducting density of states shows a well-opened superconducting gap which remains above the bulk Tc. The band structure obtained by ARPES is successfully compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discuss the structural properties of AuSn4 and their influence on the observed electronic behavior."

            "text": "Single crystals of AuSn4 were grown using excess Sn flux [19]. Based on the binary phase diagram data published in Ref. [20], we mixed high-purity Au (Goodfellow 99.99%) and\n2475-9953/2023/7(2)/024804(13) 024804-1 \u00a92023 American Physical Society\nSn (Goodfellow 99.995%) with the proportion 88:12\u2013Sn:Au. The Au-Sn mixture was introduced in a fritted crucible set [21,22] and sealed inside a quartz ampoule with Ar gas. To fully melt the Au-Sn mixture, the ampoule was heated from room temperature to 1100 \u25e6C in 12 h, then cooled to 250 \u25e6C in 12 h and finally cooled to 230 \u25e6C in 90 h. The ampoule remained for 48 hours at that temperature and was then extracted from the furnace. To separate the remaining liquid from the crystallized AuSn4, we immediately placed the ampoule in a centrifuge [19]. We obtained platelike crystals with a few mm thickness. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), the plates can be crucible limited and end up adopting a cryptomorphic (in this case circular/elliptical) morphology that is defined by the inner dimensions of the crucible. Powder x-ray diffraction (Cu K\u03b11, \u03bb = 1.54 \u00c5) on ground AuSn4 crystals led to an orthorhombic crystalline structure with very little difference between two of the three crystalline axis. The observed a = 0.652 nm, b = 1.173 nm, c = 0.652 nm [Fig. 1(a)] were compatible with the crystal structure of AuSn4 found previously. Note that here we find indistinguishable values for a and c from x-ray scattering, although literature reports provide\nsmall differences [17,23\u201325]. Further details about the crystal structure, polytypism, and atomic positions are provided in Appendix A.\nTo measure the resistivity, we attached four gold wires using silver epoxy to an in-plane-shaped sample. In Fig. 1(b), we show the temperature dependence of the resistivity up to 300 K, from which we obtain a residual resistivity ratio of 122, twice the value found in a recent work [16]. We estimate a residual resistivity of \u03c10 \u223c 0.62\u00b5 cm, which confirms the excellent quality of the samples. The superconducting transition [inset of Fig. 1(b)] provides Tc = 2.35 K in agreement with previous reports [15,16,18].\nTo perform the STM measurements, we used the STM and the cryogenic movable sample holder described in Ref. [26]. We measured the superconducting gap of Al in the same setup, obtaining a perfect fit to s-wave BCS theory with a measurement temperature of 80 mK and an energy resolution of 8 \u00b5V [27,28]. We used a tip of Au, which we cleaned and prepared following Ref. [29]. We cleaved the sample below liquid helium temperature. The sample had a layered shape and was easily cleaved giving shiny flat surfaces oriented perpendicular to the b axis. The critical magnetic field along this axis (inset of Fig. 1(b) and Ref. [16]) was of a few hundred Oe. This provides an intervortex distance well above 100 nm at the upper critical field, which is larger than the largest flat surfaces we could find. Thus, we did not follow the tunneling conductance with the magnetic field. Due to the layered structure of the samples, it happened sometimes that pieces of the sample became attached to the Au tip. This gave superconductorsuperconductor tunneling conductance curves. In that cases, we deconvoluted the tunneling conductance of the superconducting tip, taking measurements obtained with a normal Au tip, to obtain the tunneling conductance of the sample. To render images and tunneling conductance measurements, we used software described in Refs. [30,31].\nThe ARPES experiments were performed using tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser ARPES spectrometer that consists of a Scienta DA30 electron analyzer, picosecond Ti:Sapphire oscillator, and fourth-harmonic generator [32]. Data from the laser-based ARPES were collected with 6.7 eV photon energy. Angular resolution was set at \u22480.1\u25e6 and 1\u25e6, along and perpendicular to the direction of the analyzer slit, respectively, and the energy resolution was set at 2 meV. The VUV laser beam was set to vertical polarization, i.e., along the ky direction. The diameter of the photon beam on the sample was \u224815 \u00b5m. Samples were cleaved in situ at a base pressure lower than 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 Torr, usually producing very flat, mirrorlike surfaces, similar to those obtained in the STM studies. Results were obtained at a temperature of 10.5 K and were reproduced on several different single crystals.\nWe carried out DFT calculations of the bulk electronic band structure as implemented in the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package [33]. We used the generalized gradient approximation and the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof functional to describe the exchange-correlation energy [34]. To fully optimize the structure, we selected standard solid-state U.S. pseudopotentials from the Materials Cloud database [35] and sampled the Brillouin zone by a fine -centered 8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 k-point Monkhorst\u2013Pack mesh [36]. The ground state and electronic structure of the material were calculated including spin orbit\n024804-2\ncoupling (SOC) by taking fully relativistic norm-conserving pseudopotentials from the Pseudo-Dojo database [37]. We sampled the Brillouin zone by a -centered 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 k-point Monkhorst\u2013Pack mesh [36]. The electronic wave functions were expanded with well-converged kinetic energy cutoffs for the wave functions and charge density of 80 Ry and 640 Ry, respectively. Dispersion corrections were considered by applying semiempirical Grimme-D3 corrections [38]. The structure was fully optimized using the BroydenFletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm [39] until the forces on each atom were smaller than 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 Ry/au and the energy difference between two consecutive relaxation steps was less than 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 Ry."

            "text": "We show in Fig. 2(a) the orthorhombic crystal structure of AuSn4 (space group No. 68). In Figs. 2(b)\u20132(e), we show several STM images found in different fields of view and in different cool downs. We find flat surfaces separated by steps whose height is an integer or half integer number of the b-axis lattice constant [Fig. 2(f)]. Inside the planes, we find atomic size features [Fig. 2(g)]. These can be associated to the Au in-plane sublattice [black circles in Fig. 2(g)], suggesting that the Au sublattice provides a cleaving plane. This agrees with previous work on PtSn4, which found a Pt sublattice at the surface [40]. The tunneling conductance versus bias voltage obtained at different positions is shown in Fig. 2(h). We observe a well-opened superconducting gap and pronounced quasiparticle peaks. We show the temperature\ndependence of the tunneling conductance in Fig. 3(a). The superconducting gap value is reduced when increasing temperature, but remains finite above the bulk Tc found in the resistive transition. To obtain the superconducting density of states N (E ) as a function of temperature, we deconvolute N (E ) from the tunneling conductance \u03c3 (V ), following Refs. [30,41\u201344]. \u03c3 (V ) is related to N (E ) through \u03c3 (V ) =\u222b\ndEN (E ) \u2202 f (E\u2212eV ) \u2202E , where E is the energy, and f (E ) the Fermi function. We seek at each temperature the N (E ) that best fits the experiment, showing the corresponding \u03c3 (V ) at each temperature as a black line in Fig. 3(a). We show N (E ) in Fig. 3(b). We find a broad N (E ), far from the s-wave single gap BCS expression, N (E ) = Re( E\u221a\nE2\u2212 2 ). The quasiparticle peaks are broad and there is a large density of states down to energies well below the position of the quasiparticle peaks.\nNote that N (E ) has a feature inside the quasiparticle peaks [see Figs. 2(h) and bottom curves of Figs 3(a) and 3(b)]. The contribution of this feature changes when taking tunneling conductance curves at different positions [see Fig. 2(h)]. To reproduce N (E ) at the lowest temperatures shown in Fig. 3(b), we can assume a s-wave BCS density of states built from a distribution of gap values i, N (E ) \u221d \u2211 i \u03b3iRe(\nE\u221a E2\u2212 2i ). This provides the distribution \u03b3i( i ). The resulting \u03b3i versus i is shown in Fig. 3(c). The distribution consists of two Gaussians, one centered at 1 = 0.54 meV with a width \u03c31 = 0.21 meV and another one centered at 2 = 0.25 meV with a width \u03c32 = 0.1 meV. Taking bulk Tc = 2.35 K from resistivity, we find that the BCS value of the superconducting gap (T = 0K ) \u2248 1.76kBTc is of 0.36 meV, in between 1 and 2. Taking Tc,surface = 2.75 K, as observed from our tunneling conductance data [curves at the top of Fig. 3(a)],\n024804-3\nwe find 0.42 meV, which is also in between 1 and 2. A similar value is found for the position in energy where the density of states is approximately half its normal phase value. We plot the latter as points in Fig. 3(d) as a function of temperature, using the curves in Fig. 3(b). We compare the result with BCS prediction for the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap, both taking the bulk Tc from the resistivity [Tc = 2.35 K, continuous line in Fig. 3(d)] and the temperature of the observed vanishing of the superconducting density of states at the surface [Tc,surface = 2.75 K, dashed line in Fig. 3(d)]."

We first notice a Fermi surface with a rhombic shape around the center of the Brillouin zone [Fig. 4(a)]. We find an intricate band\nstructure.

            "text": "The observed superconducting density of states suggests a large distribution of gap values over the Fermi surface, going down to values very close to zero energy. Such a large distribution of values of the superconducting gap might come from multiband superconductivity. The obtained intricate shape of the Fermi surface, with many bands crossing the Fermi level [Figs. 4(b)\u20134(e)], makes it very likely to have different values of the superconducting gap in different portions of the Fermi surface.\nLet us now comment on the superconducting signal in the tunneling conductance we find above Tc. Previous work also showed different Tc\u2019s in thin films of AuSn4 [45]. It is useful to compare the crystal structures of AuSn4, PtSn4, and PdSn4. The orthorhombic crystal structure has been determined, finding a = 0.643 nm, b = 1.135 nm, and c = 0.638 nm for PtSn4 [46], a = 0.644 nm, b = 1.145 nm, and c = 0.639 nm for PdSn4 [47], but a = 0.652 nm, b = 1.173 nm and c = 0.652 nm for AuSn4 [23]. We cannot distinguish the values of a and c from x-ray scattering in AuSn4. We observe a small difference between a and c in the calculated relaxed structure (provided in Appendix A). Thus, the values of a and c are difficult to distinguish in AuSn4 but can be differentiated clearly in the other two compounds. This suggests that the presence of domains with rotated in-plane orientations is more likely in AuSn4 [24,25]. Contrary to crystals of PtSn4 and PdSn4 which present a bulky three-dimensional appearance, crystals of AuSn4 have a platelike shape and are extremely easy to cleave and very brittle. The Debye temperatures are of 304 K, 255 K, and 238 K in PtSn4, PdSn4, and AuSn4, respectively [48], suggesting that AuSn4 is softer than PtSn4 and PdSn4. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the thermal expansion in PtSn4 and PdSn4 as compared with AuSn4. Taken together, we can see that the properties of AuSn4 are easily modified by defects along the b axis and can induce properties characteristic of a layered crystal structure. As we show in the next paragraphs, this is due to polytypic modifications of the structure of AuSn4.\nCalculations detailed in Appendix A show that there is little energy difference between the atomic positions found in two different space groups (No. 68 and No. 41) in AuSn4. Both present very similar lattice constants and the atomic positions are nearly the same. The Au layers and Au atomic positions are identical. The difference is in the Sn layers\nabove and below the Au layers in Fig. 2(a). In No. 68, Sn layers above and below give an inversion center in the crystal structure (Sn layer stacking sequence A-B-B\u2019-A\u2019, with A and A\u2019 being inversion symmetric and the same for B and B\u2019), whereas for No. 41 the layers above and below have lost the inversion center (Sn layer stacking sequence B-A-B\u2019-A\u2019). The difference between both structures appears within Sn layers. Thus, the two space groups are polytypes of AuSn4. Polytypes form in systems having layers with two structures that are energetically very close. The different arrangements in each layer leads to polytypism. Polytymism can be viewed as a natural sequence of stacking faults which do not produce any other structural changes than a rotation or another symmetry operation on a layer [49,50]. The small energy difference between both atomic arrangements in the Sn layers suggests that stacking faults consisting of Sn layers rotated from A to B and viceversa (see Appendix A for more details) are the most probable defects in AuSn4.\nThe influence of stacking faults in the Tc has been reported in other layered materials. For example, the layered diantimonide LaSb2 shows a very large resistive superconducting transition and the Tc observed at the surface is larger than the temperature at which the resistivity drops to zero [51]. Often, transition-metal dichalcogenides show no superconductivity at all in certain polytypes, and superconducting properties in others, leading to a spatially dependent superconducting density of states which varies from s-wave BCS theory [42,51\u201357]. The effect of polytypism on Tc has been studied in the layered dichalcogenide TaSe2\u2212xTex [58]. In this system, the 3R polytype has shown an increment in Tc up to 17 times the Tc of its 2H polytype; an effect attributed to the change in the electronic properties as a consequence of the small variations in the layer-stacking sequence.\nThus, the presence of intrinsic stacking faults in AuSn4 can explain an increase of Tc by nearly 20% close to the surface, leading to the observation of superconductivity in the tunneling conductance above the Tc from the resistive transition. Furthermore, we can associate the dependence of the density of states as a function of the position to spatial inhomogeneities of the superconducting properties along the b-axis, perpendicular to the surface.\nOn the other hand, the coincidence between ARPES results and DFT calculations (presenting the surface projection of the band structure of the No. 68 space group, see Fig. 8 for the surface projection of the No. 41 space group) show that there are only a few aspects in the band structure that are much modified by polytypic stacking faults. The electron bands observed in Fig. 4(e) are more separated in the DFT calculations than in ARPES. Furthermore, the shape of the Fermi surface is more in-plane isotropic in ARPES [Fig. 4(e)] than in DFT calculations (shown in Appendix C). But many other features, described above, follow the DFT calculation for the No. 68 space group.\nWe should remember the involved length scales in different measurements. At the photon energy used to collect the ARPES data, the photoelectron escape depth is of about 30 \u00c5. Therefore, the ARPES signal shows the band structure several unit cells close to the surface. Nevertheless, the influence of stacking faults might well extend over a larger scale. The superconducting density of states measured with STM provides\n024804-5\nan average over distances of order of the coherence length, which is of about 75 nm [16]. This is large and shows that the polytypic modifications are not just at the last few layers but extend considerably in depth. The magnetoresistance (Appendix D) is also likely influenced by the distribution of polytypic stacking faults over large distances.\nThe polytypism of AuSn4 also has consequences that go beyond the pure electronic properties. It has been shown that the layered properties of AuSn4 play a significant role in the embrittlement of Sn-based soldering alloys. Indeed, the recent thrust in developing lead-free solders has led to a close reanalysis of phase diagrams of Sn with other elements [59]. In the Au-Sn binary phase diagram, several intermetallic compounds form [60]. AuSn4 is the first compound crystallizing from a Sn rich melt. AuSn4 crystallizes in a melt with a concentration between 7% and 20% of Au when crossing the temperature range between 250 \u25e6C and 220 \u25e6C. This easily occurs when soldering wires to electronic appliances because many surface mounting systems finish in a Au-containing surface [61\u201363]. The dissolution of Au and its later solidification leads to the precipitation of AuSn4 single crystals, which migrate to the interface between the solder and the substrate. It has been shown that these crystals participate in processes weakening the bond [62\u201365]. The strong tendency to form stacking faults due to polytypism suggests that the pronounced mechanical anisotropy of crystals of AuSn4 could also be related to defects [23\u201325]. These might help in producing embrittlement at critical parts of the joint [61,64].\nIn summary, we have grown and characterized single crystals of the superconductor AuSn4. From local scanning tunneling conductance measurements, we find superconductivity above the bulk Tc. ARPES provides an intricate band structure. We discuss the role of polytypism in the electronic and superconducting properties of AuSn4. Polytypism usually appears in quasi-two-dimensional superconductors. AuSn4, however, has a strongly three-dimensional Fermi surface, suggesting that polytypic stacking faults are relevant to better understand the properties of this system, which is a rather unique example of a three-dimensional compound presenting properties characteristic of quasi-two-dimensional systems."

            "text": "The crystal structure of AuSn4 has been measured using powder x-ray diffraction. All available x-ray scattering data are compatible with both the No. 68 centrosymmetric space group Ccca and No. 41 noncentrosymmetric space group Aba2 [18,20,23,24,66]. Both present nearly identical lattice parameters, and the difference is purely coming from different heights of different peaks [17]. The powder x-ray diffraction is based on milling down the sample into ideally small grains of randomly distributed shapes. The layered properties of AuSn4, however, make it quite difficult to mill AuSn4 into powder with random shapes, as it is easy to obtain flakes. This does not lead to an equal distribution of grains, for which the height distribution in powder x-ray diffraction is influenced by the shape of particles in the powder. Thus, it is impossible to distinguish between No. 68 and No. 41 from powder x-ray diffraction. This might also explain the differences found in the determination of the lattice constants a and c (a, c \u2248 0.65 \u00b1 0.01) in literature [17,18,20,23,24,66]. As we discuss below, here we show that the ARPES results are better explained by the No. 68 space group. Our DFT calculations also show that No. 68 is the more stable configuration.\nTo describe with more detail the atomic positions in the two possible space groups, we have computed the atomic positions using the same coordinate frame (Fig. 5). We then identify layers of Au and Sn and describe the arrangement perpendicular to the layers. Here, for simplicity, we focus on the atomic arrangement in Sn layers.\nAs we see in Fig. 5, there is strictly no difference in atomic positions when viewing both space groups from the side and the top. The atomic positions of Au are indeed identical in both cases. But not the Sn positions. The eight Sn atoms surrounding the Au atoms are arranged differently in each Sn layer. We can see the difference when we slightly tilt the viewpoint (Fig. 6). The Sn positions are slightly different in each plane, leading to an inversion center in No. 68 and no inversion center in No. 41.\nA better insight is won when looking at each layer from the top (Fig. 7). For clarity, we discuss only the Sn positions (Au positions are identical in both space groups No. 68 and No. 41). Sn arrangements are made of dumbells of Sn surrounding each Au atom. Within each plane, this leads to squares of Sn that are tilted to the left in A and to the right in B. In A\u2019 and B\u2019, the tilts are the same for each arrangement, but the Sn squares are displaced. As we see in Figs. 7(b) and 7(d), the stacking sequence is exactly opposite in the upper two layers in No. 68 as compared to No. 41. This inverted sequence removes the inversion center in the No. 41 space group. We provide in Table I the atomic positions of the fully optimized structure.\n024804-6\nFrom this representation of the atomic positions, we see that AuSn4 has two polytypes. The difference between No. 68 and No. 41 amounts to a different stacking of Sn layers.\nThe computed difference in energy of atomic positions in both structures is of 0.0165 meV per atom, favoring the No. 68 space group. In the relaxed state, we find that a = 0.6567 nm and c = 0.6561 nm in the No. 68 space group and a = 0.65124 nm and b = 0.65680 nm in the No. 41 space group.\nFrom such a small difference between No. 68 and No. 41, we also see that AuSn4 in the No. 68 space group is prone to present intrinsic stacking faults consisting of different Sn arrangements within layers."

            "text": "We compare the ARPES results with calculations of the band structure in the No. 41 space group in Fig. 8. We see that\n024804-7\ncut 1 [Fig. 8(b)] reproduces roughly the ARPES results. When approaching the zone center, there are significant differences. In particular, the calculated band structure is much more shallow in Fig. 8(d) (cut 3) and the two electron like bands on cut 4 are much more separated from each other [Fig. 8(e)] than in the No. 68 space-group band structure discussed in the main text.\nWe now discuss the surface band structure. To obtain the surface band structure of AuSn4 in space groups No. 41 and No. 68, we constructed maximally localized Wannier functions [67,68] in the WANNIER 90 code. We reproduced the bulk band structure in the range EF \u00b1 1eV by selecting the Au s,d and Sn s,p orbitals as projectors. We then calculated the surface spectral functions of semi-infinite surfaces using the surface Green\u2019s function method [69,70], as implemented in Wannier tools [71]. We show the result of the calculation of the surface band structure for the No. 68 space group in Figs. 9(a)\u20139(c). For the No. 41 space group, the result is in Figs. 9(d) and 9(g). As No. 41 is noncentrosymmetric, we provide the results of the projection to the two inequivalent top and bottom surfaces. We identify a rhombic shape around the center of the Brillouin zone which is in-plane asymmetric for both structures. Some details of the surrounding features are slightly different. For example, there are pockets around the diagonals of the plane which are more elliptical-like in the calculation for the No. 41 space group. There is no clear evidence for the two electronlike bands near observed in the\nARPES experiment. The comparison is, in all, much worse. Note, for example, the complete absence of a clear set of parabollic bands in cut 4 for all options of the surface band structure. This suggests that ARPES is mostly probing the bulk band structure."

The orbital resolved density of states is shown in Fig. 10(b). We see that the Fermi surface is predominantly of Sn 5p character, with some Sn 5s contributions.\n024804-8\nThe five Fermi surface sheets are shown in Figs. 10(d)\u201310(h). We see that there is one sheet with intricate pockets at the corners of the Brillouin zone [Fig. 10(d)]. Furthermore, there is another large sheet which covers most of the Brillouin zone and has large open Fermi surface sheets [Fig. 10(e)].\nAnother sheet centered at consists of a 3D pocket centered in the Brillouin zone and quasi-2D pockets at the corners of the Brillouin zone [Fig. 10(f)]. A similar sheet with slightly smaller pockets is shown in Fig. 10(g). Finally, there are small closed pockets at the center of the Brillouin zone, shown in Fig. 10(h). When projected to the surface, the Fermi surface shows an intricate set of bands. For example, the centered pockets in Figs. 10(f)\u201310(g) provide an in-plane anisotropic shape whose size is similar to the rounded Fermi surface structures observed in ARPES [Fig. 4(a)]. The difference might come from changes in the band structure produced by stacking faults.\nOur calculations show that the AuSn4 Fermi surface is different from the Fermi surface obtained in PtSn4. The latter is formed by three small pockets and only one large Fermi surface sheet [11,14,74], whereas the calculated Fermi surface of AuSn4 is formed by four large and one small sheets. In PtSn4, the surface band structure around the X point presents a sharp band with two Dirac features which are gapped when moving across the X point. This leads to nodes formed by the crossing point of the Dirac dispersion around the X point."

            "heading": "4. Magnetoresistance of AuSn4",
            "text": "In Fig. 11(a), we show the magnetoresistance (MR) (MR = \u03c1(H,T ) \u03c1(H=0,T ) ) as a function of the magnetic field up to 14 T at different temperatures between 2.5 K and 100 K. The MR increases by more than 500% between 0 T and 14 T at 2.5 K. In the inset of Fig. 11(a), we provide the MR at small magnetic fields.\nThe MR changes as a function of temperature. At temperatures below 20 K, we observe a slight downward curvature below about 2 T. Above 2 T, we observe a linear increase up to 14 T without any sign for saturation. Above 20 K, we observe that the MR is significantly reduced and the magnetic field dependence approaches the quadratic behavior observed in simple metals for the whole field range. We provide Kohler\u2019s\n024804-9\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n100 K50 K\n20 K\n10 K\n) %( R M\nH (T)\nT=2.5 K\n0.0 0.5 1.0 0\n50 M R\n(% )\nH (T)\n(a)\n(b)\nplot in Fig. 11(b). This compares the temperature dependence of the resistivity \u03c1(H = 0, T ) with the MR by normalizing the magnetic field to \u03c1(H = 0, T ). We see that Kohler\u2019s scaling\nroughly holds, as curves at all temperatures are quite close to each other. Nevertheless, we also observe that the downward curvature below 20 K and the quadratic behavior at high temperatures produce visible deviations from Kohler\u2019s rule.\nThe MR in AuSn4 is large, but considerably smaller than the MR of PtSn4 and PdSn4 [11\u201313]. Other than a slight downward curvature below 2 T, AuSn4 shows a linear and nonsaturating behavior of the MR, in contrast to a quadraticlike MR observed in PtSn4 and PdSn4. To understand the MR, we can try to use a simple two-band model with near electron-hole compensation, successfully used previously in PtSn4 and PdSn4, see Refs. [11\u201313].\nThe two-band model assumes that there is no anisotropy in the Fermi surface, and that all electron or holelike carriers have the same mobility. Within this model, the MR would show a close to B2 behavior or be saturated at high field, depending on the level of the electron/hole compensation. Neither of the two cases can explain the non-saturating linear MR observed here. The inset of Fig. 11(b) shows as a purple line the best fit that can be obtained from the two-band model, manifesting a large deviation from the experimental data (we use \u03c1(B) = ne\u03bce+nh\u03bch+\u03bce\u03bch (ne\u03bch+nh\u03bce )B2\ne[(ne\u03bce+nh\u03bch )2+(ne\u2212nh )2\u03bc2e\u03bc2hB2] ,\nwhere ne (nh) and \u03bce (\u03bch) are electron (hole) concentration and mobility [7,75]). Our calculations show that the Fermi surface of AuSn4 contains five large and highly anisotropic sheets (Fig. 10). Moreover, four out of five sheets are open [Figs. 10(d)\u201310(g)]. This suggests that the two-band model may not be sufficient to explain the MR.\nWe can also consider other sources for a nonsaturating MR, such as a linearly dispersing portion of the band structure, charge density waves, open orbits, or disorder [7\u201310,10,75\u2013 90]. We do not find portions with a linear dispersion close to the Fermi level in the band structure. A charge density wave would lead to a feature in the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which we do not observe. Open orbits are clearly present in the large and complex multiband Fermi surface, but the mixture with other bands make it unlikely that these play a significant role in the MR. The remaining mechanism is disorder, here most probably related to the polytypic nature of the crystal structure. Notice that we do not observe the dip found at low magnetic fields in Refs. [16,18], but instead a smooth increase of the MR with the magnetic field. This suggest that different sets of samples have a different density of stacking faults, indicating that polytypism induced disorder has an influence on the MR.\n[1] M. Z. Hasan and C. L.
