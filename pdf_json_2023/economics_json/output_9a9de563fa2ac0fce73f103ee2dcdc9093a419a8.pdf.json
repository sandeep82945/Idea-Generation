    "abstractText": "With climate change and rising sea levels, the residents and assets in low-elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are at increasing risk. The application of high-resolution gridded population datasets in recent years has highlighted the threats faced by people living in LECZ. However, the potential exposure of gross domestic product (GDP) within LECZ remains unknown, due to the absence of refined GDP datasets and corresponding analyzes for coastal regions. The climate-related risks faced by LECZ may still be underestimated. In this study, we estimated the potential exposure of GDP in the LECZ across China by overlying DEM with new gridded GDP datasets generated by random forest models. The results show that 24.02% and 22.7% of China\u2019s total GDP were located in the LECZ in 2010 and 2019, respectively, while the area of the LECZ only accounted for 1.91% of China\u2019s territory. Significant variability appears in the spatial-temporal pattern and the volume of GDP across sectors, which impedes disaster prevention and mitigation efforts within administrative regions. Interannual comparisons reveal a rapid increase in GDP within the LECZ, but a decline in its share of the country. Policy reasons may have driven the slow shift of China\u2019s economy to regions far from",

            "text": "Low-elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are areas below 10 m elevation with hydrological connections to the sea [1], and are widely distributed in coastal zones around the world [2]. Given the advantages in transportation, resource and terrain, such coastal zones are often attractive for residential, commercial and tourism development [3]. However, climate change has accelerated sea level rise (SLR), and intensified tropical and extratropical cyclones, exposing the LECZ to an increasing risk of natural disasters [4\u20136]. In the extremes, SLR in the 21st century could even exceed 2 m, threatening to inundate large numbers of people and significant amounts of property worldwide [7,8]. In response to this situation, the research on climate change and the population living in LECZ has been of increasing interest in recent years [9\u201311]. McGranahan et al. [1] first reported that LECZ cover 2% of the world\u2019s land area but comprise 10% of the global population. Fine-grained global population datasets, such as LandScan and WorldPop, currently the two most widely known population datasets worldwide, have also been used to estimate the potential exposure of the population in the LECZ across the world [12,13]. However, despite being one of the most important hazard-affected elements in disaster risk assessment, the geographical distribution of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the LECZ has been poorly studied, resulting in an insufficient understanding of the impact of climate change on the economy within LECZ.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1285. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15051285 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1285 2 of 17\nGross domestic product is the primary indicator for measuring economic activity [14,15], and highly urbanized areas are typically densely populated and economically developed [16]. With 3351 cities and 13 megacities globally located in coastal areas [17], substantial GDP will be at risk of inundation from sea level rise by 2100 [18]. In addition, differentiated economic activity characteristics divide the GDP categories, with the primary sector (GDP1) covering agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries, the secondary sector (GDP2) including mining, manufacturing and transportation and the tertiary sector (GDP3) containing all service industries. This further highlights the threats faced by GDP within the LECZ, making it difficult for GDP to formulate a unified disaster prevention policy such as population [19]. For example, when the basic industry in the secondary sector suffers from a natural disaster, industrial production, the surrounding natural environment and the population will be continuously affected [20]. Previous studies have also shown that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between natural disaster losses and wealth, with adequate prevention support leading to losses increasing and then decreasing as wealth increases [19,21]. The geographical analysis of the GDP distribution within the LECZ will be a key step in both disaster prevention and loss assessment for complex economic activities. Gross domestic product data are usually collected from the administrative level (cities, counties, etc.), which leads to issues such as low resolution and insufficient spatial heterogeneity and hinders their integration with other geospatial data [22,23]. Decomposing traditional GDP statistics with other auxiliary data is a common method for obtaining gridded GDP data [24,25]. Nighttime lights (NTL) are viable indicators for detecting economic activities and are widely used in GDP mapping [26,27]. However, the GDPs of secondary and tertiary sectors in complex urban areas are difficult to differentiate by considering only NTL data [28]. Moreover, for agricultural activities with marginal or no NTL emissions, NTL data are not able to disaggregate GDP from the administrative district scale [29]. The inclusion of multisource data in GDP mapping has become a consensus among researchers [30,31]. In recent years, advances in geospatial big data and machine learning have provided new opportunities for fine-grained GDP mapping [32,33]. Rich economic activity information is embedded in point of interest (POI) and road network data in the era of geospatial big data [28,34]. Machine learning methods are used to effectively capture the nonlinear relationship between covariates and GDP, generating a high-precision GDP distribution map of urban areas [35]. Combining these developments, Chen et al. [28] mapped the distribution of different sectors in mainland China in 2010 at the 1 km resolution. Wang et al. [36] also used machine learning methods to generate global GDP distribution at the 1 km resolution. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to apply previous GDP datasets to the current risk assessment of LECZ due to their outdated data vintage. Also, single-year data hardly allow researchers to see the changes in the potential exposure of GDP, and the impact of government decisions, and make reasonable recommendations. Furthermore, gridded GDP datasets at the 1 km resolution are still too coarse for estimating GDP exposure within the LECZ and could lead to overestimations compared to 100 m resolution [37,38]. Gross domestic product density maps should be updated on both temporal and spatial scales to meet the spatial analysis assessment requirements of GDP in LECZ. In this study, we took the LECZ of mainland China as the study area and decomposed the 2010 and 2019 official GDP by integrating multisource remote sensing data and geospatial big data using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The years 2010 and 2019 exclude the economic impact of COVID-19, etc., and have complete official statistics in the study area. The GDP1, GDP2 the GDP3 were modeled, respectively, and gridded GDP maps of different sectors with a resolution of 100 m were produced. Then, a spatial analysis of the potential exposure of GDP in LECZ across China was performed based on digital elevation model (DEM) data and our GDP gridded maps. Finally, we contrasted the risks posed by GDP and population in LECZ and emphasized the importance of assessing GDP within the LECZ and the trends of potential exposure of GDP and population within LECZ in China.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1285 3 of 17"

Road networks and POIs have been widely used for mapping of secondary and tertiary industries in previous studies [33]. According to the Chinese semantic description of POIs, we divided POIs into secondary sector-related POIs (factories, mining companies, etc.) and tertiary sector-related POIs (commercial buildings, restaurants, banks, etc.) [28]. Then, kernel density estimation [41] was used for the conversion of discrete POI data into continuous and smooth density surfaces (POIs-Sec-density and POI-Ter-density) with a bandwidth of 200 m, an optimal size for urban building function identification and recognition [42]. The road network data were used to generate the corresponding distance to the nearest road (DtN-road) layers at a resolution of 100 m. The NTL data for 2010 and 2019 were obtained from the extended time-series of the global NPP-VIIRS-like NTL dataset [43]. This NTL dataset was calibrated from the DMSPOLS and NPP-VIIRS NTL data with a time range of 2000\u20132020 and a spatial resolution of 500 m. Land surface temperature (LST) data were derived from the MODIS MOD11A1 product (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/ (accessed on 13 January 2022)), which records global daily mean LST information and separately stores daytime and nighttime data at the 1 km resolution. The mean daytime LST (LST-day) and mean nighttime LST (LST-night) for the summers of 2010 and 2019 were calculated using LST images [44]. The net primary product (NPP) data were obtained from the MODIS MOD17A3H product in 500 m resolution. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were calculated based on Landsat 8 satellite data at the 30 m resolution. The near-infrared band (band 5) and red band (band 4) of Landsat8 were selected using the Google Earth Engine to calculate the annual average NDVIs in 2010 and 2019. The land cover datasets for China are the annual data from 1990 to 2010 with a resolution of 30 m produced by Yang and Huang [45]. The proportions of cropland, forest, grassland and water bodies were calculated in 100 m \u00d7 100 m grids (e.g., cropland rate, forest rate, grassland rate and water rate). The 30 m resolution DEM dataset was obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/ (accessed on 12 December 2020)). These DEM data (hereafter referred to as NASADEM) are a reprocessing of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data and combine data from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Global DEM and Geoscience Laser Altimeter with excellent accuracy and quality. Finally, the slope layer with 100 m resolution was generated by the NASADEM. All remote sensing data used in this study are publicly available. All raster data were re-projected to the Albers Conical Equal Area Projection and resampled to 100 m resolution in ArcGIS 10.2 (Hangzhou, China). The Snap Raster function was kept on to ensure that the different covariates were aligned with each other."

Discussion For a physical event to be hazardous and damaging, a population and/or assets must be exposed to the threat [52]. Previous studies have examined the distribution of population within the LECZ at the global or regional scale and the potential impact of climate change [1,53], but no study has quantified the exposure of GDP in the same manner as population. To better understand the threats facing the LECZ, we first mapped the GDP distribution of three sectors along the coast of China, and then superimposed the LECZ obtained by DEM for GDP assessment. As described above, although the LECZ accounts for only 1.91% of China\u2019s territory, the GDP generated within it is enormous (Table 3). Specifically, LECZ contributed 24.02% and 22.7% of China\u2019s GDP in 2010 and 2019, respectively. The Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Bohai Rim are the most economically developed regions in eastern China, but unfortunately are also the regions with the largest LECZ areas. In particular, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Shanghai are identified as the provinces with the highest GDP output within the LECZ.\nAll sectors of GDP exhibit significant potential exposure in the LECZ, but behave differently in terms of spatial distribution, aggregate and temporal variation. Nearly 10% of the primary sector and over 20% of the secondary and tertiary sectors are located in the LECZ in mainland China. Not surprisingly, due to the resources and transportation constraints, GDP1 is predominantly located in rural areas, GDP2 is typically generated in suburban fringes, and GDP3 is concentrated in urban centers, especially in highly urbanized metropolises such as Shanghai and Guangdong. However, even with a narrower\nFigure 7. A 100 m gridded GDP ap of China\u2019s LECZ in 2010 (a,c,d) and 2019 (b,e,f) (unit: million CNY/ha)."

The clustering of the population and economy in the LECZ further contributes to the rapid development of China. A comparison of our GDP dataset with the LandScan population dataset confirms the high geographic overlap of economic\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1285 13 of 17\nand demographic hotspots within the LECZ, especially between GDP3 and population (Figure 9). However, a dramatic difference between population clustering and GDP clustering in the LECZ is also observed, with GDP exhibiting stronger regional heterogeneity. McGranahan et al. [1] and Yang et al. [38] have derived that about 10% and 12.7% of the population of mainland China live in the LECZ, respectively. In our results, even GDP1, which has the lowest absolute and relative values within LECZ, yields result similar to the proportion of LECZ\u2019s population in the country, whereas GDP2 and GDP3 are almost twice as large as the population (Table 3). Although previous research has shown that wealthier regions tend to have greater capacities to recover from disasters [56,57], for pre-disaster prevention, the higher agglomeration of the economy also implies higher exposure risk, especially within the LECZ in the context of climate change [58].

The resolution of LandScan is 1 km and the resolution of GDP data is 100 m.\nMoreover, the high degree of population and economic overlap does not mean that it is conducive to concentrated disaster risk prevention within the LECZ. The complexity of the characteristics of economic activities still plagues city managers in responses to disaster threats across sectors [59]. Specific, well-targeted defense policies need to be proposed, as well as the careful consideration of long-term coastal planning options. For example, for existing GDP1 and GDP2, physical defenses such as strengthening the existing protection facilities, building new storm defense facilities and developing coastal shelter forests will be clear and effective solutions [60,61]. At the same time, special attention should be paid to the fact that the destruction of coastal industries by natural disasters may further trigger serious industrial technological disasters, such as fire, explosions, poisoning, etc., causing a more profound negative impact on society and the environment [20,62]. Moreover, for GDP3 in the LECZ, while the negative effect of climate change and sea level rise are obvious [63,64], measures to address such negative impacts are much more complex.

Macroeconomic adjustment to reduce GDP3 exposure in LECZ remains an effective tool for the government department, although this often takes a long period of time [65]. It is important to note, however, that moving all residents and assets out of LECZ is hardly practical so, similar to the population issue, \u201cdefense\u201d and \u201cretreat\u201d are the two baseline strategies for addressing the risk to economic activities in the LECZ [53]. Policy preferences are an important factor in China\u2019s economic development and will also be an effective strategy to deal with the potential exposure of GDP in the LECZ. This can be explained by another interesting phenomenon observed in this study and contributes to the analysis of the relationship between population and economy in China. As mentioned earlier, firstly GDP (as well as GDP1, GDP2 and GDP3) within the LECZ shows a trend of significant growth in total, but both GDP1 and GDP2 show a decrease in their share of the economy of the LECZ, with GDP3 replacing GDP2 as the main economic source within the LECZ. The transformation of industries within the LECZ in China is ongoing [66]. At the same time, the share of GDP in all sectors of the LECZ is decreasing nationally. Considering the dependence of GDP1 on environmental resources, we believe that the center of gravity of China\u2019s GDP2 is gradually migrating to the interior of China, followed by the shift of GDP3 [67,68]. However, LandScan\u2019s results show that China\u2019s population has maintained its migration to the LECZ during this period. This phenomenon stems from the increasing importance of the inland in relation to the transformation of China\u2019s economic reform and open-door policy to the strategy of developing eastern, central and western China simultaneously [69,70]. We make a hypothesis based on this phenomenon that policies drive economic transfer, economic transfer drives population migration and there is often a delay between conversions, primarily between the population and economy. For the consideration of mitigating the impact of climate change, the Chinese government\u2019s inward migration policy will help reduce the risk faced by LECZ, but it will be a slow process. The economic status of LECZ will remain difficult to replace for a long time to come. Although we estimated the potential GDP exposure within the LECZ for China in 2010 and 2019, inevitably multiple limitations remain. Firstly, difficulties in data availability limit our ability to explore more years and regions of potential GDP exposure within the LECZ. More variation between years would be useful to further analyze the spatio-temporal pattern of GDP variation across sectors within the LECZ. This direction has been little studied and more peers are expected. The relationship between population and GDP within the LECZ and national policies also deserves more in-depth exploration. Although we propose a hypothesis from a policy perspective, more detailed data analysis such as geographic detection [71], and spatial autocorrelation methods would help to reveal the underlying causes of the induced changes. Also, even with the current state-of-the art GDP mapping method, our simulation of GDP1 is still under-optimal. The spatialization of GDP1 is still one of the difficulties in the field, and more accurate assessment schemes need to be developed, both in terms of new covariates and fitting methods. In addition, the uncertainties introduced in the assessment process were ignored, and the shoreline changes, DEMs from different sources and the resolution of covariates will effectively affect the estimation results and need to be considered in future more refined and small-scale studies. There is currently a need for a unified and rational assessment scheme for LECZ to support the formulation of disaster mitigation policies."

Our estimates indicate that the GDP within the LECZ accounted for 24.02% and 22.7% of China\u2019s total GDP in 2010 and 2019, respectively, while their corresponding areas accounted for only 1.91% of the country\u2019s total area. Similar to the previous studies on population exposure, GDP also showed agglomeration within the LECZ, and even higher aggregation than population. At the same time, the substantial differences in the spatial-temporal distribution, aggregate and economic characteristics of GDP of various sectors make it harder to prevent the risks posed by GDP in the LECZ. Therefore, we are insistent on ensuring that the GDP exposure in the LECZ should be given the same attention as the population, and that sector-specific defense strategies must be developed. Through the assessment of the potential exposure of GDP within China\u2019s LECZ, this study highlights the huge risks posed by climate change to economic activities within the LECZ, and the same issue is also worth discussing in other coastal countries.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.Y.; methodology, F.L., Q.C. and X.Y.; software, L.M.; validation, L.M. and Q.C.; formal analysis, F.L.; investigation, F.L. and Q.C.; resources, L.M. and Q.C.; data curation, F.L. and X.Y.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.M. and X.Y.; visualization, F.L. and X.Y.; supervision, Q.C.; project administration, X.Y.; funding acquisition, X.Y.
