    "abstractText": "Research on electroactive microorganisms (EAM) often focuses either on their physiology and the underlying mechanisms of extracellular electron transfer or on their application in microbial electrochemical technologies (MET). Thermodynamic understanding of energy conversions related to growth and activity of EAM has received only a little attention. In this study, we aimed to prove the hypothesized restricted energy harvest of EAM by determining biomass yields by monitoring growth of acetate-fed biofilms presumably enriched in Geobacter, using optical coherence tomography, at three anode potentials and four acetate concentrations. Experiments were concurrently simulated using a refined thermodynamic model for EAM. Neither clear correlations were observed between biomass yield and anode potential nor acetate concentration, albeit the statistical significances are limited, mainly due to the observed experimental variances. The experimental biomass yield based on acetate consumption (YX/ac = 37 \u00b1 9 mgCODbiomass gCODac \u2212 1) was higher than estimated by modeling, indicating limitations of existing growth models to predict yields of EAM. In contrast, the modeled biomass yield based on catabolic energy harvest was higher than the biomass yield from experimental data (YX/cat = 25.9 \u00b1 6.8 mgCODbiomass kJ 1), supporting restricted energy harvest of EAM and indicating a role of not considered energy sinks. This calls for an adjusted growth model for EAM, including, e.g., the microbial electrochemical Peltier heat to improve the understanding and modeling of their energy metabolism. Furthermore, the reported biomass yields are important parameters to design strategies for influencing the interactions between EAM and other microorganisms and allowing more realistic feasibility assessments of MET.",

Thermodynamic understanding of energy conversions related to growth and activity of EAM has received only a little attention. In this study, we aimed to prove the hypothesized restricted energy harvest of EAM by determining biomass yields by monitoring growth of acetate-fed biofilms presumably enriched in Geobacter, using optical coherence tomography, at three anode potentials and four acetate concentrations. Experiments were concurrently simulated using a refined thermodynamic model for EAM. Neither clear correlations were observed between biomass yield and anode potential nor acetate concentration, albeit the statistical significances are limited, mainly due to the observed experimental variances. The experimental biomass yield based on acetate consumption (YX/ac = 37 \u00b1 9 mgCODbiomass gCODac\u2212 1) was higher than estimated by modeling, indicating limitations of existing growth models to predict yields of EAM. In contrast, the modeled biomass yield based on catabolic energy harvest was higher than the biomass yield from experimental data (YX/cat = 25.9 \u00b1 6.8 mgCODbiomass kJ\u2212 1), supporting restricted energy harvest of EAM and indicating a role of not considered energy sinks. This calls for an adjusted growth model for EAM, including, e.g., the microbial electrochemical Peltier heat to improve the understanding and modeling of their energy metabolism. Furthermore, the reported biomass yields are important parameters to design strategies for influencing the interactions between EAM and other microorganisms and allowing more realistic feasibility assessments of MET."

            "text": "Electroactive microorganisms (EAM) extend their electron transfer chain across the periplasm and the outer membrane \u2013 this is called extracellular electron transfer (EET) (Kumar et al., 2017). EET allows coupling oxidation of soluble substrates, being electron donors (ED), to solid terminal electron acceptors (TEA). Hence, the energy harvesting metabolism is wired to the reduction of solid electron conductors that cannot pass the cellular envelope. EAM can also receive electrons from solid ED to perform reduction reactions using soluble TEA. In addition to using direct EET that needs physical contact, EAM are also known to use soluble redox shuttles (i.e., mediated EET) and to exchange electrons among each other (i.e., direct interspecies electron transfer, DIET) (Logan et al., 2019).\nExploiting a wide variety of insoluble ED and TEA is advantageous for EAM as it enables survival in ecological niches that are not accessible to other microorganisms (Koch and Harnisch, 2016). Following this unique physiological trait, a substantial influence of EAM on environmental processes seems evident including degradation of organic matter, redox cycling of metals (Gescher, 2012), and biocorrosion (Dou et al., 2021). Moreover, EAM are discussed to be harnessed as bioelectrocatalyst in primary microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) for different applications (e.g., wastewater treatment, synthesis of chemicals, and desalination), with the technical devices being termed bioelectrochemical systems (BES) (Cao et al., 2009; Logan and Rabaey, 2012; Schro\u0308der et al., 2015). In BES, anode and cathode serve as inexhaustible electron sink (i.e., TEA) or electron source (i.e., ED), respectively. EAM exhibit planktonic and sessile growth, but the most efficient\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: benjamin.korth@ufz.de (B.

This interest has been driven by the desire to leverage the application potential of EAM and to reveal their actual impact on environmental processes. Surprisingly, knowledge of the thermodynamics of EET and energy conversions of EAM is still in its infancy. At the same time, these are central aspects when analyzing and predicting growth and activity of EAM. As thermodynamics determines the energetic limits of biological conversions, it represents a cornerstone for energetic and economic assessments of biotechnological processes (Kontogeorgis and Folas, 2010; von Stockar, 2018).\nA first theoretical framework for thermodynamic analyses of MET on the system level was proposed by Sadhukhan et al. performing substrate screening for microbial fuel cells (MFC) and energy efficiency estimations for microbial electrochemical syntheses (Sadhukhan et al., 2016). One of the first experimental attempts to investigate the thermodynamics of EAM and the energetic consequences of EET was conducted in a combined experimental and constraint-based modeling study with planktonic cultures of the electroactive model organism Geobacter sulfurreducens. Comparing growth of G. sulfurreducens with soluble\nfumarate and insoluble Fe(III) as TEA revealed that biomass yield was significantly lower in case of Fe(III), suggesting a restricted catabolic energy harvest when EET is performed (Mahadevan et al., 2006). Recently, applying a thermodynamic model for EAM demonstrated that the catabolic energy harvest does not linearly correlate with the anode potential (i.e., the external driving force for EET) but exhibits a saturation effect (Korth and Harnisch, 2019). The maximum catabolic energy that can be used for generating proton motive force (pmf), which in turn is utilized for ATP synthesis (i.e., biological energy transduction), is not determined by the energy difference between the soluble ED and the solid TEA (including anodes). It is determined by the energy difference between the soluble ED and the last component of the electron transport chain that still contributes to pmf (Bird et al., 2011; Korth and Harnisch, 2019) (Fig. 1a). However, it was not yet experimentally demonstrated that the energy harvest of EAM using anodes as TEA is limited and that a different theoretical approach is required for calculating the catabolic energy gain compared to microorganisms using soluble EA. One crucial obstacle for such an investigation is the need for a non-invasive and robust tool to monitor the biomass growth of electroactive biofilms at electrodes.\nRecently optical coherence tomography (OCT) was introduced as biomass quantification method, which fulfills these requirements and\ninclude several electron transfer steps from the inner membrane Rox/RredH to periplasmic and outer membrane redox centers, but it simulates a direct electron transfer from Rox/RredH to the biofilm matrix. Subfigures a) and b) were adapted from Korth and Harnisch, 2019, and Korth et al., 2015, respectively.\nB. Korth et al.\nWater Research 242 (2023) 120279\nallows corresponding experiments (Molenaar et al., 2018). OCT uses near-infrared light to visualize biofilm morphology and to quantify the total biomass amount on electrodes at different time points. With this visual and non-invasive technique, the development of electroactive biofilms and their morphological adaptations can be studied at micrometer scale under different operating conditions. Thus, combining OCT measurements for assessing biomass production with quantification of the reactants of the catabolic reaction and thermodynamic modeling allows to investigate the restricted catabolic energy harvest.\nTo provide an experimental assessment of the hypothesis of restricted energy harvest of EAM using anodes as TEA, anodic electroactive biofilms were cultivated with different acetate concentrations and at different anode potentials. Concurrently, biomass production was monitored via OCT, and the biomass yield was calculated based on the consumed acetate and the harvested catabolic energy, assuming restricted energy harvest. In addition, a previously developed thermodynamic model for EAM (Korth et al., 2015) was refined and adapted to simulate the performed experiments. Experimental and model results indicate that the energy harvest of EAM is indeed restricted, but further experiments are required to decipher the relationship between biomass yield and acetate concentration or anode potential. Furthermore, it appears that established microbial growth models need adaptations to correctly simulate the thermodynamics of EAM."

The reactor design has been previously described (Molenaar et al., 2018). Briefly, the anode compartment was composed of a flow channel (33 cm3), and a graphite sheet (Voltea Inc., USA) was used as current collector for the FTO electrode. The flat and transparent electrode surface with an area of 22.3 cm2 allowed the non-invasive biofilm monitoring via optical coherence tomography (OCT). A bipolar membrane (Ralex PEBPM, MEGA a.s., Czech Republic) was placed between the anode and cathode compartment to prevent crossover of, e. g., cathodically produced hydrogen to the anode. The cathode compartment was composed of a flow channel identical to the anode compartment with a flat platinum/iridium coated titanium plate (Pt/IrO2 80:20, Magneto special anodes B.V., The Netherlands) serving as cathode. In addition, a Ag/AgCl 3 M KCl reference electrode (Prosense B.V., The Netherlands) was used.\nEach electrode chamber was connected to a feed and recirculation peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S, Cole-Parmer\u00ae, Instrument Solutions Benelux B.V., The Netherlands). The feed was stored in a 10 L reservoir (Laboratory Glass Specialists B.V., The Netherlands) and pumped at 0.36 mL min\u2212 1. The recirculation rate of anolyte and catholyte was 60 mL min\u2212 1. Effluents from anodic and cathodic chambers were collected in 10 L reservoirs. Considering the total volume of the anolyte (220 mL, i.e., anode compartment and belonging tubing), 10 h hydraulic retention time (HRT) was obtained. A potentiostat (N-stat D-module, Ivium Technologies, The Netherlands) was used to apply a constant anode potential with current being sampled every minute. The reference electrode was connected to the anode flow channel using a HaberLuggin capillary (ProSense B.V., The Netherlands) filled with 3 M KCl solution and positioned at 5 mm distance to the FTO electrode. Quick-\ncoupler valves (SS-QC4-D-400, Swagelok, USA) were connected to the tubing of each reactor to avoid oxygen penetration into the system, while reactors were disconnected for OCT analysis. The reactor temperature was controlled in a climate chamber at 298 K."

The microbial community was not directly determined, but we have excellent reasons to anticipate a high share of Geobacter species within the acetate-fed anodic electroactive biofilm. For instance, its enrichment using the here applied conditions was demonstrated several times (Commault et al., 2013; Korth et al., 2020b; Torres et al., 2009) even with the same experimental setup (Pereira et al., 2022a). Furthermore, the determined formal potential (\u0394Ef\u2032Rox/RredH = \u2212 0.164 V) (Fricke et al., 2008) and the high Coulombic efficiency (90 \u00b1 24%) (Commault et al., 2015; Jung and Regan, 2007) indicate a typical Geobacter enrichment biofilm cultivated at anodes. Furthermore, 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid was added to the medium to inhibit methanogenesis. In addition, in a previous study with the same setup and comparable experimental conditions (EA = \u2212 0.15 V, 10 mM acetate, Geobacter exhibited a relative abundance of ca. 75% within the biofilm (Pereira et al., 2022a). Consequently, we focus on the genus Geobacter in the discussion of results, in line with the main body of literature on physiological adaptations to changing redox potentials of the TEA as well as the energetic consequences thereof. It is also of note that in the previous publication, only anaerobic bacteria were identified, and thus, we assume a biofilm consisting of almost only electroactive microorganisms performing acetate oxidation and EET to the anode, albeit the biofilm did not solely consist of Geobacter (Pereira et al., 2022a)\nThe anolyte constituted of (g L\u2212 1): 3.40 KH2PO4, 4.36 K2HPO4, 0.1 MgSO4\u00d77H2O, 0.74 KCl, 0.58 NaCl, 0.28 NH4Cl, 0.1 CaCl2\u00d72H2O, 1 mL of trace metals mixture, and 1 mL of vitamins mixture according to DSMZ culture medium 141 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany). 0.04 (0.5 mM), 0.17 (2 mM), 0.41 (5 mM), or 0.65 (8 mM) NaCH3COOH were added as electron donor. 1.97 g L\u2212 1 of BrCH2CH2SO3Na was added to the medium to inhibit methanogenesis. The anolyte inflow was continuously sparged with nitrogen during the experiments to maintain anaerobic conditions. The catholyte was a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.

Biomass yield based on catabolic energy harvest (YX/cat) For determining YX/cat, we followed the principle of a restricted energy harvest of EAM. Thus, the standard Gibbs energy of catabolic reaction (\u0394RG0 \u2032 cat [kJ mol\n\u2212 1]) based on the direct coupling of acetate oxidation with the reduction of intracellular redox centers (Rox/RredH, eq. 3) located at the inner membrane using literature values for biochemical standard conditions (Heijnen and Kleerebezem, 2010). The Gibbs energy of formation of redox centers, required for the calculation of \u0394RG0 \u2032 cat, was calculated using the formal redox potential (Ef \u2032 Rox/RredH, SI-2) obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments (SI-3, see discussion in Section 3.3). The determined Ef\u2032Rox/RredH = \u2212 0.164 \u00b1 0.009 V is indicative for a Geobacter dominated biofilm (Fricke et al., 2008). It is necessary to mention that using CV data as input parameter for inner membrane cytochromes represents an approximation as formal potentials derived from turnover CV represent mixed potentials that are not determined by only one reaction, but influenced by different cytochromes and their redox states under particular growth conditions. Information on the localization of specific cytochromes can be, for instance, obtained by open circuit potential measurements (Schrott et al., 2019). However, the determined Ef\u2032Rox/RredH is close to formal potentials of inner membrane cytochromes of Geobacter sulfurreducens (e. g., CbcL, Ef = \u2212 0.150 V) (Reguera and Kashefi, 2019; Zacharoff et al.,\n2016).

The model refinement presented in this study comprises an adjusted incorporation of the restricted energy harvest of electroactive microorganisms (in the original model, only the energy difference between acetate and NAD+/NADH was considered as microbial energy harvest), pH dependency of redox centers, continuous conditions, and bidirectional ion transport across the membrane (SI-5).\nThe microbial cells utilize acetate for harvesting energy leading to current production (i.e., catabolic reaction) and for biomass formation (i.e., anabolic reaction).

Being in line with time-resolved surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy data, by Ly et al. (2013), the model distinguishes between homogeneous (between inner membrane redox centers and extracellular biofilm matrix) and heterogeneous (between biofilm matrix and anode) electron transfer both modeled with the Butler-Volmer equation but with different rate constants (SI-5). Only the acetate oxidation and the electron transfer from NADH to Rox contribute to the energy harvest but not the homogeneous and heterogeneous electron transfer as they discretely simulate the electron transfer from the inner membrane across periplasm, outer membrane, and biofilm matrix to the anode. A variety of literature data was used as input parameters for the model, and the model output was validated with literature data to increase its significance. A complete model description can be found in Korth et al., 2015. For this study, the model was tailored to consider the design (e.g., reactor and electrode size, flow rate, medium composition, and anode potential) of the experimental study (see SI-5 for main model parameters and adapted equations). For creating the model and for performing simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics V5.1 (COMSOL Inc., Sweden) was used.\n2.7.2. Biomass yield based on catabolic energy harvest (YX/cat) The catabolic reaction was modified to consider the restricted energy harvest of EAM adequately. In detail, acetate oxidation was coupled to NAD+ reduction (eq. 8), and biological energy transduction at the electron transport chain (i.e., conversion of reduction equivalents in ATP) was simulated by coupling NADH oxidation to the reduction of inner membrane redox centers (e.g., inner membrane cytochromes, eq. 9). Both corresponding Gibbs energies (\u0394RG0 \u2032 cat1 and \u0394RG0 \u2032 cat2) were corrected for actual experimental conditions following eq. 4 (SI-6) in order to obtain \u0394Gcat1 and \u0394Gcat2.\nC2H3O\u22122 + 4H2O + 4NAD + \u21922HCO\u22123 + 4NADH + 5H +\n\u0394RG0 \u2032 cat1 = 32.3 kJ\nmol\n(8)\nNADH + 2Rox + H+ \u21922RredH + NAD+\n\u0394RG0 \u2032 cat2 = \u2212 30.2 kJ mol (9)\nIn accordance with Section 2.6.2, redox centers were assumed to be one-electron carriers. Their difference in Gibbs energy of formation was based on CV results as already described in Section 2.6.2 (see also SI-2). The difference in Gibbs energy of formation of the redox couple NAD+/ NADH was similarly obtained as previously explained (Korth et al., 2015).\nThe Gibbs energies of both catabolic reactions were integrated over biofilm thickness and time, considering all catabolic reactions within the biofilm during the whole simulation time (t) for obtaining the total microbial energy harvest (eq. 10).\nU =\n\u23a1 \u23a3 \u222bt\n0\n\u239b \u239d \u222bx\n0\n\u0394Gcat1rac,catdx\n\u239e \u23a0dt+ \u222bt\n0\n\u239b \u239d \u222bx\n0\n\u0394Gcat2ridx\n\u239e\n\u23a0dt\n\u23a4\n\u23a6\u00d7 Aanode (10)\nrac,cat [mol s \u2212 1 L\u2212 1] is catabolic acetate consumption rate (only considering acetate consumption for energy harvesting but not for anabolism) based on a double Michaelis-Menten kinetics (i.e., considering availability of acetate and NAD+), x [\u00b5m] is biofilm thickness, ri [mol s\u2212 1 L\u2212 1] is intracellular electron transfer rate between NAD+/ NADH and Rox/RredH (this reaction rate is based on the concentrations of the reactants and rate constants of forward and backward reaction) (Korth et al., 2015), and Aanode [cm2] is anode area.

Fig. 2 illustrates two examples of the development of current density (j) and biomass for limiting (i.e., low acetate concentration, Cac,influent = 0.5 mM, and low anode potential, EA = \u2212 0.2 V) and non-limiting (i.e., Cac,influent = 5 mM and EA = 0 V) conditions. In all cases, j rapidly increased in the beginning without an apparent lag phase (SI-8). Within a few days, j saturated and remained constant for non-limiting conditions. When limiting conditions were applied, j usually decreased after reaching its maximum and stabilized at a lower value.\nCurrent densities did not exceed 0.3 A m\u2212 2 when Cac,influent was 0.5 mM. For this low substrate concentration, changes in anode potential did not have any effect on j, representing acetate-limited conditions. For Cac,influent of 2 mM and 5 mM, j ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 A m\u2212 2, while 8 mM resulted in a higher current density of 1.3 to 3.5 A m\u2212 2. For all acetate concentrations, the highest j were measured at \u2212 0.1 V and 0 V with only minor differences between them. For instance, in case of 8 mM acetate, a steep current increase was observed when the anode potential was changed from \u2212 0.2 to \u2212 0.1 V, but a further increase to 0 V led to a less evident rise of current, indicating limiting and non-limiting potential conditions for \u2212 0.2 and 0 V, respectively.\nFor all tested anode potentials and acetate concentrations, biomass growth was observed via OCT at the beginning of the experiments, while current production was negligible. Consequently, coulombic efficiency (CE) was low at the beginning of most experiments but reached 90 \u00b1 24% when complete experiments were considered. This indicates that a considerable share of acetate (and thus electrons) were directed toward biomass formation in the early growth phase, as it was already demonstrated for batch cultures with anodic Geobacter enrichment biofilms (Korth et al., 2020a). After substantial biomass was formed, biofilm growth slowed down, and more acetate was channeled through catabolism leading to an increasing CE during experiments. Intriguingly, the model showed a similar behavior during all simulations with comparable low CE initially, subsequently increasing and leveling off at around 95%.\nB.

            "text": "By averaging all experimental results, a biomass yield based on acetate consumption (YX/ac) of 36.7 \u00b1 8.6 mgCODbiomass gCODac\u2212 1 (or expressed in dry weight 30.9 \u00b1 7.3 mgDWbiomass gac\u2212 1, Table 1) was derived. This is in line with previously published growth yields of 38\u201342 mgCODbiomass gCODac\u2212 1 obtained with a similar experimental design used for establishing OCT as method for in situ biomass quantification of electroactive biofilms (Molenaar et al., 2018). Similar to this previous work, calculations on biomass yield were solely based on biofilm growth and did not consider the proliferation of planktonic cells and their wash-out in the continuous system. However, due to the absence or negligible concentration (sulfate) of alternative soluble terminal electron acceptors and the use of 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid to inhibit methanogenesis, it is unlikely that a substantial fraction of acetate was directed to the formation of a planktonic phase. Biofilm detachment could also have contributed to the occurrence of planktonic cells. However, as biofilm detachment infers with biofilm quantification via OCT, only the experimental duration before biofilm decrease being observed was considered for all calculations. Generally, YX/ac showed the opposite behavior compared to CE, as it was initially high but decreased within a few days and leveled off during the experiment. However, for improved time-resolved analysis of the biomass yield, more replicates are required, and cultivation of pure cultures could reduce the observed experimental variability. This investigation would also include the application of more positive anode potentials to prove the hypothesized generality of the observed results. When the experimentally obtained data is normalized to molarities, it can be seen that the biomass yield of acetate-fed electroactive biofilms (0.074 C-molbiomass C-molsubstrate\u2212 1 ) is in the lower range compared to biomass yields reported for several other anaerobes growing on different carbon sources including fermentative microorganisms and methanogens (Heijnen and van Dijken, 1992). This observation verifies the calculations for the standard Gibbs energy of catabolic reaction of the electroactive biofilm\n(\u0394RG0 \u2032 cat = \u2212 88.4 kJ mol \u2212 1, Eq. 3) as \u0394RG0 \u2032 cat is in the same range as, for instance, hydrogenotrophic (\u2212 135.5 kJ mol\u2212 1) and acetoclastic (\u2212 31.0 kJ mol\u2212 1) methanogenesis, acetogenesis (\u2212 104.5 kJ mol\u2212 1) (SI-9), fermentation of butanediol to acetate and ethanol (\u2212 38.2 kJ mol\u2212 1), or fermentation of acetoin to acetate and ethanol (\u2212 75.4 kJ mol\u2212 1) (Schink, 1984).\nThe biomass yield can also be normalized to the catabolic energy harvest (YX/cat) using time-resolved experimental data (Sections 2.6.2 and 2.7.2). By doing so, biomass yield is related to all energy-yielding reactions occurring within the biofilm. Taking all experiments into account, YX/cat amounts to 25.9 \u00b1 6.8 mgCODbiomass kJ\u2212 1 (or expressed in dry weight 21.8 \u00b1 5.7 mgDWbiomass kJ\u2212 1, Table 1). This value is beneficial for establishing holistic energy balances of MET in future as it facilitates the incorporation of microbial energy demand together with other processes that produce or consume chemical, electrical, or heat energy. Consequently, comprehensive economic assessments of MET and direct comparisons with other (bio)technological approaches (Kontogeorgis and Folas, 2010; von Stockar et al., 2003) are feasible."

            "text": "To obtain further knowledge on the energy metabolism of EAM, the experimental data was compared to results obtained with the enhanced thermodynamic model on EAM (Section 2.7.1 and Korth et al., 2015). All conducted experiments were simulated in order to compare modeled and experimentally derived biomass yields using total charge production as optimization parameter. Intriguingly, only one model parameter (i.e., the rate constant for the heterogeneous electron transfer from the biofilm matrix to the anode, k0a = 0.032 \u00b1 0.028 s\n\u2212 1, n=21) had to be slightly adjusted to simulate charge production of experiments (deviation 0.5 \u00b11.3%) within the same time interval. Presumably, material and geometric inhomogeneities of the used FTO electrodes led to different charge transfer resistances requiring adaptions of k0a for the\nB. Korth et al.\nWater Research 242 (2023) 120279\ndifferent simulations. Although the applied values for k0a indicate a (quasi-)reversible electron transfer; the applied anode potential (\u2212 0.2 to 0 V vs. SHE) is in the potential range where EET may limit the catabolism (see SI-3, cyclic voltammograms).\nInterestingly, the modeled YX/ac and YX/cat exhibited opposite tendencies when they were compared with their experimental counterparts. Whereas YX/ac derived from modeling was ca. 35% lower compared to the experimental value, the modeled YX/cat was ca. 30% higher than the biomass yield obtained from experiments (Table 1). These observed yield differences have several implications for the thermodynamic modeling of electroactive biofilms considering the average modeled catabolic energy harvest of \u2212 40.9 \u00b1 2.8 kJ molac\u2212 1 (SI-11). This value translates to an upper thermodynamic limit of 0.7 molATP molac\u2212 1 assuming an energy requirement of \u2212 60 kJ mol\u2212 1 for ATP synthesis at physiological conditions (Nelson and Cox, 2017) being in line with the theoretical maximum yield of 0.5 molATP molac\u2212 1 proposed by Mahadevan et al. for G. sulfurreducens using soluble Fe(III) citrate as TEA which also leads to a restricted energy harvest (Mahadevan et al., 2006). Therefore, we propose that the \u201cenergy input\u201d (i.e., the restricted catabolic energy harvest of EAM that is only exploiting the energy difference between the substrate and the electron-transport chain) was adequately modeled. However, it seems that the energy utilization (i.e., mainly growth and maintenance) requires refinements for improved simulations.\nThe underestimation of YX/ac by the model indicates that processes that directly influence the biomass yield (e.g., maintenance requirements and amount of dissipation energy needed to facilitate growth) are overestimated. Thus the available energy for biomass growth is underestimated. To calculate microbial growth parameters, the model applied a well-established method based on Gibbs energy of dissipation which results are consistent compared to the efficiency of energy capture approach (Heijnen and Kleerebezem, 2010; VanBriesen, 2002). Nevertheless, applying these methods to anaerobic growth systems is still a delicate endeavor leading to significant uncertainties (Liu et al., 2007). Moreover, the maintenance requirements are indeed based on large data collection of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, but biofilm cultures were not included in this analysis. Biofilms and planktonic cells usually exhibit certain physiological differences as cellular functions like stress response and motility are less required within the biofilm than in planktonic cells (Dumitrache et al., 2017). It was also shown for the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum that genes for the energy metabolism are differently expressed in biofilm and planktonic state (Dumitrache et al., 2017). Therefore, a customized growth model for electroactive biofilms is required, considering the particular properties of EAM and biofilm physiology. To our knowledge, experimental data on maintenance requirements is only available for the planktonic growth of the model organism G. sulfurreducens using fumarate and Fe(III) citrate as TEA (Mahadevan et al., 2006). However, a generalized growth model has to be based on different EAM consuming different substrates and using soluble as well as solid TEA. Another potential reason for the observed deviations of the yield could be the biomass composition. In the model, a conventional formula for biomass was used (CH1.8O0.5N0.2, (Roels, 1980)), but recent results indicate that the elemental composition of G. sulfurreducens biofilms is more reduced compared to microorganisms breathing soluble electron acceptors (Howley et al., 2022) resulting in different energy demands for anabolic processes.\nThe overestimation of YX/cat by thermodynamic modeling clearly suggests that the assumption of the restricted catabolic energy harvest is correct. Moreover, a comparison of modeling and experimental results indicates that the catabolic energy harvest is even more restricted than delineated by model assumptions or that further processes occur that decrease the availability of the harvested catabolic energy. For instance, the microbial electrochemical Peltier heat (mePh) constitutes an entropic barrier at the interface EAM/anode that requires an energy investment to be overcome (Korth et al., 2016). But the mePh also\nrepresents an entropic contribution to the driving force for growth. So far, only the mePh of Geobacter enrichment biofilms transferring electrons to a graphite electrode was measured (27 \u00b1 6 kJ mol\u2212 1) (Korth et al., 2016). Still, it is supposed to vary depending on the active redox species (e.g., outer membrane cytochromes of EAM), the electrode material, and the electrolyte considering its abiotic equivalent, the electrochemical Peltier heat (Fang, 2011)."

            "heading": "3.4. (In-)Dependence of biomass yield from anode potential and acetate concentration",
            "text": "Generally, neither YX/ac nor YX/cat obtained from experiments and modeling showed clear correlations with acetate concentration or anode potential. Especially the comparable high variability of some experimental conditions resulted in a limited statistical significance of the results so that only a few trends for the thermodynamic model can be anticipated. For instance, a minor dependency of the modeled YX/ac and YX/cat on acetate concentration was indicated for anode potentials of 0 and \u2212 0.1 V, but only with low coefficients of determination (SI-12). For EA = \u2212 0.2 V, the model predicts no dependence of biomass yield from acetate concentration, indicating that the TEA limitation governs microbial activity. Also, the model indicated no clear dependence of the biomass yield on anode potential. At Cac of 5 mM and 8 mM, the biomass yield weakly increases with more positive anode potentials. Surprisingly, the opposite was observed for Cac = 2 mM (SI-12). This could be explained by the complex interplay of different partially opposite gradients and kinetics within the electroactive biofilm (see discussion below), leading to the occurrence of an energetic minimum of the thermodynamic frame (i.e., maximum available energy that catabolic reactions can harvest) (Korth and Harnisch, 2019).\nThe experimental independence of the acetate concentration on biomass yield was unexpected, as it is in strong contrast to planktonic cultures of G. sulfurreducens cultivated at limited and excessive availability of ED or TEA (Esteve-N\u00fan\u0303ez et al., 2005). Besides the comparable high experimental variability, other reasons could had contributed as well. For instance, gradients within the biofilm, the small sample size for similar experimental conditions not capturing the biological variance of electroactive biofilms (Larrosa et al., 2009), the inherent challenges for a reliable determination of biomass yields (Liu et al., 2007), and the physiological differences between biofilm and planktonic cells (Berlanga and Guerrero, 2016). Electroactive biofilms are complex systems with several internal gradients (substrate, pH, counter ion, and redox potential) (Atci et al., 2016; Babauta et al., 2012; Franks et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2022b). Conceivably, this leads to different activities and hence biomass yields in different biofilm layers, depending on biofilm thickness and density. Similarly, these gradients could also conceal a putative relation between biomass yield and anode potential that relies on the presence of different inner membrane cytochromes in response to the available TEA, as demonstrated for G. sulfurreducens (Joshi et al., 2021; Levar et al., 2014; Zacharoff et al., 2016). With this mechanism, G. sulfurreducens can presumably maximize its total microbial energy harvest (i.e., U) as more positive TEA lead to the production of inner membrane cytochromes with higher redox potentials. Consequently, lower anode potentials lead to the expression of inner membrane cytochromes with low redox potentials, which decreases the maximum available energy (i.e., U) as the energy difference between the electron donor and the inner membrane cytochrome decreases. Nevertheless, this mechanism ensures that EET can still proceed at a sufficient rate as the energy difference between inner membrane cytochromes and the cytochrome network in the periplasm and at the outer membrane and, thus, the anode remains exergonic. For G. sulfurreducens, it is described that for anode potentials more positive than \u2212 0.1 V, mainly the inner membrane cytochrome ImcH is active whereas below \u2212 0.1 V, CbcL is dominating (Levar et al., 2014). Although a more negative a more positive anode potential than \u2212 0.1 V is applied in this study, no changes\nB. Korth et al.\nWater Research 242 (2023) 120279\nin biomass yield were observed likely due to the abovementioned superimposed gradients within the biofilm.\nThe applied thermodynamic model does not consider the effects of changes within the electron transport chain or the influence of the anode material on the overall energy balance due to the lack of sufficient experimental data that could be used as input parameters (e.g., cytochrome concentrations, electron transfer rate constants). Yet, the implementation of different EET pathways is undoubtedly a future improvement of the model to further increase its significance\nAs mentioned above, the applied anode potential range is relatively narrow, eventually not triggering the synthesis of different inner membrane cytochromes. Yet, the range is of high practical relevance, as a low anode potential usually leads to higher power output in MFC (i.e., converting chemical energy stored in wastewater into electrical energy) or lower required energy input and higher overall energy efficiency in microbial electrolysis cells (MEC, i.e., converting chemical energy stored in wastewater with electricity input into hydrogen)."

            "text": "The obtained results on biomass yields can be used to energetically optimize biotechnological applications based on anodic electroactive biofilms. Together with substrate uptake rates (Korth et al., 2020a; Kubannek et al., 2022) and an optimized anode potential (i.e., minimizing energy input for applying a potential but providing sufficient driving force for growth of EAM), a tailor-made feeding strategy for EAM could be designed optimizing biomass production. After EAM established sufficient biomass for a particular MET process, the anode potential (or the external resistance of a MFC) can be modulated for steering the energy fluxes towards improved energy efficiency of MET by decreasing the energy flux to the biomass. By doing so, further biomass formation would be minimized, and the probability of process failures (e.g., by biofilm detachment or by clogging of 3D electrodes due to the accumulation of inactive biomass) could be decreased.\nIn the following, we demonstrate how the obtained data on biomass yields can be used to estimate the impact of the energy needs of biofilm formation on the overall energy balance and thus on the economic feasibility of MFC (see SI-13 for detailed calculations). In a prototype study by Hiegemann et al., a submergible MFC module was presented, which can be integrated into existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) (Hiegemann et al., 2019). This module has an anode size of 4.2 m2 and covers an area of 0.3 m2. When taking the example of a rather small WWTP (55,000 population equivalents) with a daily wastewater inflow of 8050 m3 and an average organic load of 0.4 kgCOD m\u2212 3 (Korth et al., 2021), the primary clarifier (ca. 30\u00d710 m) could host a maximum of 1000 MFC modules. For the formation of electroactive biofilms covering the total anode area of these 1000 MFC modules, a substrate input of 630 kgCOD would be required considering an average biofilm coverage of 5.5 gCODbiomass m\u2212 2 and a biomass yield of 36.7 mgCODbiomass gCOD\u2212 1, as both determined in this study. Therefore, only 0.05% of the annual WWTP\u2019s total COD inflow is consumed for forming the electroactive biofilm, leaving the major part of the chemical energy within the wastewater for harvesting electric energy. Besides the proposed trade-off between power production and COD removal depending on the reactor configuration (Rossi and Logan, 2022), these calculations disclose one current major drawback of the MFC technology. Even with this vast anode area (4200 m2), only ca. 2% of the wastewater could be treated with the implemented MFC modules calling for reinforced engineering of reactor and anode geometries to achieve an optimized anode area-to-volume ratio while preventing limited mass transfer due to formation of excess biomass (Chong et al., 2019; Mo\u00df et al., 2019). Theoretically compensating for this insufficient treatment capacity in order to treat 100% of the wastewater inflow with MFC modules, still only 3.8% of the annual total chemical energy stored in wastewater would be required for biomass formation. Obviously, this examination represents only a first step towards an operational energy balance of\nMFC, but it underlines the energetic potential of MFC as well as its current bottlenecks for applications. It is common sense that in wastewater treatment plants also other biomass growth than anodic biofilms occurs as alternative electron acceptors (mainly oxygen but also, e.g., nitrate) are freely available, likely presenting a larger energy sink than the formation of anodic biofilms. Still, a CE of 10\u201330% seems conceivable for a real-world application of MFC (Alsayed et al., 2020)."

Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations and modeling were conducted to shed further light on the energy metabolism of EAM. The experimental biomass yield based on acetate consumption amounted to 36.7 \u00b1 8.6 mgCODbiomass gCODac\u2212 1 and no clear trends between biomass yield and acetate concentration or anode potential were observed, calling for further investigations to improve the statistical significance. The ratio of biomass yield and catabolic energy harvest is well in line with literature about different anaerobic microorganisms verifying the applied thermodynamic model and calculation framework. Yet, at the same time, it demonstrates the complexity of electroactive biofilms exhibiting several internal gradients (e.g., redox potential, pH, and substrate), resulting in different growth efficiencies within different biofilm layers challenging the determination of general yield coefficients. A previously developed thermodynamic model for EAM was refined to allow adequate simulation of the restricted energy harvest of EAM and tailored to simulate the performed experiments. Thus, the general applicability of the thermodynamic model to simulate different experimental designs and concepts was demonstrated as only minor changes within the system of equations were required therefore. Experimentally derived and modeled biomass yields exhibited noticeable deviations indicating that the applied growth model requires adaptations for an improved description of the energy metabolism of electroactive biofilms. Especially considering the physiological differences between biofilm and planktonic state, the requirement for specified microbial maintenance and energy dissipation of electroactive biofilms seems evident. Furthermore, unique phenomena of EAM, like the microbial electrochemical Peltier heat, coincidently representing an entropic energy sink and a significant contribution to the driving force for growth, need to be considered in thermodynamic calculations. These refinements must be based on sets of experiments with a wide variety of different EAM consuming different substrates and TEA. Nevertheless, the obtained biomass yields can already be used to estimate the impact of biological energy demands in holistic energy balances of microbial fuel cells and other MET, contributing to assessments of their economic feasibility. Doing so showed that only a minor fraction of the chemical energy stored in wastewater is needed for sufficient biofilm formation covering the complete anode area to treat the daily wastewater inflow.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nData availability\nData will be made available on request."
