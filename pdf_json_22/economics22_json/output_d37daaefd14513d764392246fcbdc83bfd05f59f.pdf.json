    "abstractText": "Background Little research has examined how pandemics affect residents in under-resourced communities. This study investigated how COVID-19 and lockdown policies affected residents of Alexandra, one of Johannesburg, South Africa\u2019s lowest-income townships. Methods We conducted a telephone survey May 11\u201322, 2020, while the lockdown and alcohol ban were in effect, of a spatially stratified sample of 353 adult Alexandra residents drawn randomly from voter registration, credit card application, and prior studies\u2019 sampling frames. We examined economic consequences; health experiences, including COVID-19 exposure and mental health symptoms; alcohol use; and personal experiences with violence. Results Respondents were aged 18 to 89 and 47% female. About 70% of those employed before the lockdown were no longer working. Over half of households lost at least one source of income. About 50% of respondents reported stockpiling food. A majority reported price rises and declines in availability of food. Smaller percentages reported such changes for other items. Over 80% reported stress or anxiety, or depression due to the pandemic. The prevalence of past-week alcohol use fell from over 50% before the lockdown to less than 10% during the lockdown. Self-reported physical violence victimization increased. Discussion COVID-19 and the lockdown disrupted Alexandra residents\u2019 lives through unemployment, lost income, mental health problems, and increased violence. The differences between these outcomes and those in more advantaged communities deserve investigation. Research should also seek to identify tailored responses to effectively address the challenges of marginalized communities that often have limited resources to deal with pandemics and policies to contain them.",

After the first confirmed case in early March 2020, South Africa instituted a strong policy response to curtail the epidemic\u2019s spread. By March 15, a national state of disaster was declared that included a travel ban, social distancing, and the closure of schools and universities. Eight days later, President Ramaphosa announced a national lockdown that took effect on March 26 and required all but essential workers to stay at home and to leave only to access health care or buy essential items (South African News Agency, 2020, March 23). Nationwide, alcoholic beverage sales were banned from March 26 through May 31, and again from mid-July to mid-August (Reuter et\u00a0al., 2020). Lockdown enforcement was vigorous, with more than 300,000 arrests\n* Deborah A.

A study of trauma cases in the emergency center of a large, rural regional hospital found that the volume of patients treated for assaults, road crash injuries, and other injuries declined dramatically (56\u201360%) from February (pre-pandemic) to April (post-pandemic) of 2020 (Reuter et\u00a0al., 2020). The reductions persisted even after the alcohol ban was lifted (Venter et\u00a0al., 2021).\nDespite the potential benefits of containing the spread of the coronavirus and possible reductions in crime and trauma requiring medical care, highly restrictive policies such as lockdowns may be burdensome, particularly for residents of low- and middle-income countries (Obasa et\u00a0al., 2020). Stay-at-home orders may make it impossible for lower-wage workers to perform their jobs, thus causing economic hardships especially for families that are already economically disadvantaged. In addition, reduced access to food and other essential commodities along with price increases associated with COVID-19 policies may disproportionally affect such families (Paslakis et\u00a0al., 2021). One study of nine countries in Africa conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that female-headed households, the poor, and those with less formal education appeared to suffer the most in terms of food insecurity (Dasgupta & Robinson, 2021). Additionally, the diversion of resources to fight a pandemic may strain health care resources that are particularly critical to vulnerable populations (e.g., maternal and child health services). For example, using data spanning January 1, 2018, through July 31, 2020, from 65 primary care clinics in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, investigators found that HIV testing decreased by 47.6% by April 2020 (Dorward et\u00a0al., 2021). Additionally, the median number of initiations of antiretroviral therapy decreased from a median of 571 per week pre-lockdown to 375 per week post-lockdown. The reduction occurred immediately, with an estimated 46.2% decrease in the first week of the lockdown. Pandemics such as COVID19 and the attendant shifts in health care resources that may be implemented to contain them may negatively affect diagnosis and the continuity of care for other health issues, resulting in increased non-COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, especially among at-risk populations (Blumberg et\u00a0al., 2020). Some have argued that the early and extensive lockdown in South Africa benefitted health service preparedness for handling COVID-19 cases, but had deleterious effects on tuberculosis and vaccine programs, as well as HIV treatment (Kaswa, 2021; Madhi et\u00a0al., 2020).\nStudies of the effects of disasters have repeatedly found adverse effects on emotional distress and mental health\noutcomes (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). In a study of COVID-19-related stressors and mental health among a self-selected sample of South Africans who were of higher SES and education, De Man et\u00a0al. (2022) found that 46.0% of respondents reported anxiety and 47.2% reported experiencing depression. In addition to anxiety and depression, the circumstances associated with pandemics (e.g., social isolation, economic loss, inadequate food supplies) may also lead to increases in stress, boredom, irritability, confusion, substance use, and domestic violence (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2020; Galea et\u00a0al., 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020; Wu et\u00a0al., 2008). These emotional and psychological effects may last beyond the pandemic (Liu et\u00a0al., 2012). Although physical and mental health problems may be common during public health disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic, those with relatively few resources, and particularly a low income, may find it more difficult to cope with pandemic-related circumstances and experience more negative outcomes.\nTo investigate the effects of the pandemic and the associated lockdown in a vulnerable community, we conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of residents in Alexandra Township within Johannesburg, South Africa. The purpose of the survey was to investigate broadly how the pandemic affected the lives of Alexandra residents. In contrast to nearby upper-class suburbs, Alexandra is one of the poorest urban areas in South Africa, with families often living in densely clustered \u201cshacks\u201d which average nine square meters floor space and often house families of three or more. Our survey asked residents about preparations they made before the lockdown, access to food and other supplies, employment and economic repercussions, and pandemicrelated outcomes, including COVID-19 infection, mental health, alcohol use, and experiences with violence during the lockdown."

            "text": "Our phone survey in Alexandra, conducted in May of 2020, indicated that the COVID-19 lockdown imposed substantial economic and personal hardships on township residents. A great majority of those who were working before the pandemic no longer were employed while locked down about 2\u00a0months after the first local case was detected. Over half of households had lost at least one source of income. Substantial numbers reported stocking up on food staples prior to the lockdown and a substantial majority reported experiencing higher prices and decreased availability of food and other supplies.\nRespondents who reported having contracted COVID19 all said that they followed public health guidelines to quarantine themselves post-diagnosis. Although none of the respondents who contracted COVID-19 was among those who thought they had been exposed to someone with the virus, most had traveled outside their home and most were from households where someone was traveling to and from work during the epidemic. Community transmission thus may have played an important role in infection spread.\nConsistent with other studies of pandemics, substantial numbers of the township\u2019s residents reported stress or anxiety, or depression associated with COVID-19 (Cullen et\u00a0al., 2020; Esterwood & Saeed, 2020; Lima et\u00a0al., 2020; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2020; Shah et\u00a0al., 2020; Yao et\u00a0al., 2020). Harling\net\u00a0al. (2020) and Kim et\u00a0al. (2020) reported smaller, but nevertheless significant, mental health impacts associated with COVID-19 elsewhere in South Africa, especially as the lockdowns there relaxed. Interestingly, other studies found that COVID-19-related mental health impacts were less evident in rural and low-income areas (Harling et\u00a0al., 2020; Spaull et\u00a0al., 2020). In contrast, we found very high levels of stress or anxiety and depression among this sample of South Africa\u2019s poorest residents.\nAmong those who had consumed alcohol in the past year, past-week prevalence of alcohol use decreased from 59% before the lockdown to 9% during it. Respondents believed that police were actively enforcing the strict alcohol policies that prohibited sales during the lockdown. This finding is consistent with the most frequently reported sources of alcohol consumed by past-week drinkers\u2014their stock of purchased alcohol and their own or someone else\u2019s homebrew.\nDespite reduced prevalence of alcohol consumption, the lockdown was associated with a significant increase in selfreported physical violence victimization, but no change in reports of sexual violence. The increase in physical violence victimization is consistent with reports of 65\u2013100% increases in domestic violence hotline calls in South Africa during the lockdown (Farber, 2020, September 1; Grobler, 2020, May 11). In contrast, hospital-treated trauma decreased during and after the lockdown (Navsaria et\u00a0al., 2020; Reuter et\u00a0al., 2020; Venter et\u00a0al., 2021) and, in April\u2013June, police reports of murder, attempted murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, rape, and car-jacking each fell 35\u201341% below the comparable months in 2019 (Waterworth & Chemaly, 2020, August 15). Murder and rape then surged above their usual numbers as restrictions eased (Harrisberg, 2020, June 16). With travel restricted and alcohol sales banned, drink driving convictions declined by 86% and drug crimes by 53%. Police Minister Cele said \u201cthe reduction in crime was not only due to the alcohol ban, but also to people staying in their homes and high-visibility policing including the army, police and metro police\u201d (Waterworth & Chemaly, 2020, August 15). We suggest that fear of catching COVID-19 at a hospital or during a police investigation may have discouraged violence victims from seeking medical care or reporting victimization. That possibility serves as a cautionary note about\n1 3\nrelying on formal data sources alone to track violence during a pandemic. Although our data suggest that non-sexual physical violence rose during the lockdown, this finding does not necessarily indicate that the alcohol sales ban did not itself reduce violence. Given that 72% of medically attended violent victimization incidents in South Africa involve alcohol, of which at least 49% may be directly attributed to alcohol (Cherpitel et\u00a0al., 2012), violence might have risen even more absent the sales ban.\nIn a recent study, Zhu and colleagues examined policy responses to the pandemic and other factors in COVID-19 infections in the BRICS countries, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2021). Using a policy stringency index from 0 to 100 that reflected the level of policy response to the pandemic, the investigators found that daily new COVID-19 cases rose rapidly when the policy stringency index was low (0 to 45), slowed when the index was higher (46 to 80), and decreased when the index was above 80. The investigators concluded that strong policy responses such as through effective containment and case management are crucial to curtail a pandemic. Effective and strong policy responses are undoubtedly an important tool for curtailing public health disease outbreaks that pose risks for extensive morbidity and mortality. It is also important, however, for policy makers to consider that pandemics, as well as some policy responses developed to address them, may disproportionately burden vulnerable segments of the population and exacerbate existing inequities. For example, Nguse and Wassenaar (2021) found that while the COVID19 pandemic affected all South Africans in various ways, the poor have been most affected due to structural inequality, poverty, unemployment, and lack of quality health care and other services. Thus, attention to ways to reduce or counter the adverse effects of strong policy responses on vulnerable populations is important. Dasgupta and Robinson (2021) reported that loss of income, attributable to lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19, decreased access to food. To address food insecurity, the nine African countries in that study used both food and cash safety nets, the latter of which appeared to be slightly more effective. An investigation of other efforts to address inequities related to pandemic mitigation measures was conducted by Sweeney et\u00a0al. (2021). Using data from six countries (Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, Philippines, and South Africa), the investigators developed an econometric model to simulate the impact of lockdown policies on income loss. Findings suggest that improved safety nets (e.g., replacement of lost income) can reduce adverse economic and health impacts resulting from stringent lockdown policies. Such models may be used to assist policy makers in evaluating the equity implications of interventions, identifying segments of the population in need of social protection, and informing decisions on implementing\npolicy interventions (e.g., determining when and how best to implement less stringent approaches and providing robust support when more stringent ones are necessary)."

            "text": "Our sample may not have been representative, insofar as our sampling frame comprised respondents whose names appeared on voter rolls and credit applications, or who had participated in previous surveys and agreed to be recontacted for future studies. That said, it is likely that our efforts to increase the external validity of our sample by ensuring some degree of its spatial dispersion in Alexandra increased its representativeness. However, compared to 2011 census data (https:// censu s2011. adria nfrith. com/ place/ 798014) and our 2018 household survey (Miller et\u00a0al., 2019), our unweighted telephone sample had fewer respondents under age 35 and more over age 50. Although we weighted our data to better reflect the population, the representativeness of the sample may be limited. Additionally, retrospective reports are subject to recall bias. Because most of our questions asked respondents about events that occurred in the previous week during the pandemic, we expect these reports to be relatively free from such bias. However, our pre-pandemic measures asked respondents about the week prior to the lockdown, which involved a recall period of approximately 6 to 7\u00a0weeks before the interview. Because the survey was administered by an interviewer, there may also have been social desirability biases, especially on questions concerning illegal or sensitive behaviors. Despite these issues, by providing a snapshot of how the coronavirus has affected the lives of residents in a socioeconomically disadvantaged South African township, this survey helps fill a void given that most studies have focused on higher-income countries."

In marginalized communities, where many residents have jobs that cannot be performed by telecommuting, strict sequestration orders can cause substantial income loss as well as loss of access to household necessities, including food. Efforts to contain the virus in such communities may need to place greater emphasis on testing and contact tracing than in well-resourced communities. Finally, efforts to understand the association of social problems with sequestration orders and alcohol bans should use multiple data sources, given that archival data from police and medical facilities may undercount the true number of cases if people do not seek treatment or report adverse events because of concerns about contracting the virus.\n1 3"

It also was associated with anxiety, depression, and violence. Further research is needed to understand how the incidence of these outcomes differs between disadvantaged communities and those that are well resourced. Understanding these differences, together with the health, economic, and equity implications of strategies for managing and mitigating pandemics, will inform policy makers\u2019 efforts to address pandemic threats while reducing the burdens they impose on vulnerable communities."
