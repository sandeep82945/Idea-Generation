In this study, we present our findings on porous colloids settled at a solid wall in an aqueous solution comprising a photo-sensitive azobenzene-containing cationic surfactant and a cyanine-based dye, capable of ionically binding to each other. The surfactant acts as an activation agent for diffusioosmotic flow. When exposed to modulated light, it undergoes photo-isomerization from a hydrophobic trans-state to a more hydrophilic cis-state, creating a concentration gradient near the irradiated area of the wall. The resulting osmotic pressure gradient sets the flow in motion. Porous colloids actively participate in flow generation by readily incorporating the surfactant molecules in the trans-state and releasing them in the cis-state, creating a constant source of diffusioosmotic flow. Under UV illumination, an excess of cis-isomers near the porous colloids elicits long-range repulsive interactions, tenfold the diameter of a particle. The dye acts as a sensor for the surfactant filling or emptying the pores of the colloids. It forms a complex with the trans-isomer and diffuses into the pores, where photoisomerization to cis-state destroys the complex and causes both the dye and the surfactant to leave the pores, altering the luminescence brightness within the colloids. We demonstrated that the presence of the dye affects cis-trans isomer ratios of the surfactant at photo-stationary states, thereby influencing the process of diffusioosmosis. This process enables the manipulation of colloidal particles and remote control of the interaction potential between them, facilitating the formation of well-ordered surface aggregates.

            "text": "Diffusioosmosis is a membrane-free osmotic transport mechanism that relies on generating a fluid flow close to a solid surface where the colloids are trapped.1\u20133 The colloids can either passively move along the diffusioosmotic (DO) flow pattern or undergo selfpropelled motion.4\u201317 This phenomenon has recently gained considerable attention as a means of manipulating a colloidal ensemble at solid-liquid interfaces.9,18,19 The driving force behind the tangential DO flow is the osmotic pressure gradient originating from a solute gradient at the solid surface.20\u201327 To generate a solute gradient at the surface, the concept of light-driven diffusioosmotic (LDDO) flow has recently been introduced.28\u201330 Here, a solution of photo-sensitive surfactant molecules containing an azobenzene group in the hydrophobic tail is irradiated with modulated light of an appropriate wavelength, at which the azobenzene groups reversibly\nphoto-isomerize from a less polar and hydrophobic trans- to a more polar cis-state, generating a concentration gradient of the isomers near a solid surface.31,32 For instance, under UV light irradiation, the majority of surfactant molecules switch to a metastable cis-state, resulting in an outward-directed DO flow due to the formation of a local excess concentration of cis-isomers near the surface, while longer wavelength light (e.g., blue and green) leads to a prevalence of more stable trans-isomers at the irradiated area in a cis-isomerenriched solution, resulting in an inward-directed flow.27,30 Thus, it has been demonstrated that the generated DO flow is capable of removing or gathering colloids from or within the illuminated area, with the particles passively following the created LDDO flow (passive motion).29,33\nA similar mechanism can be applied to generate active motion of the colloids, i.e., the particle itself can generate a concentration gradient of the isomers. To achieve this, the particle should be able to\nJ. Chem.

For instance, when a porous particle immersed in a solution of cis-isomers is illuminated with green light (converting from cis- to trans-), the diffusion of trans-isomers into the particle generates a depletion zone near the colloid surface, resulting in aggregation of colloids due to attractive diffusioosmotic interactions.30 On the other hand, under irradiation with blue light, a steady-state DO flow is established around the particles, leading to stable long-time repulsive DO interactions.28 The generation of different DO flows in porous particles renders them active in the sense that the inter-particle interactions can be adjusted.34 Despite the fact that LDDO was introduced by our group back in 2016 and further extended in 2020 to enable the active displacement of a certain type of particles, numerous open questions still remain regarding such aspects of the LDDO flow, such as direct visualization of the flow pattern and understanding the time development of the concentration gradient between two different isomers.\nIn this paper, we introduced a fluorescent dye to the surfactant solution to visualize the dynamics of surfactant diffusion during the development of local light-driven diffusioosmotic (l-LDDO) flow. For this purpose, we chose a dye that could ionically bind to the cationic surfactant molecule without spectral overlap between the excitation/emission wavelength of the dye (absorbing in the red range) and the wavelengths of azobenzene photoisomerization.\nIn life sciences, the use of red- and near-infrared (NIR)absorbing dyes has become a popular solution to reduce issues such as autofluorescence of the sample and problems arising from scattered light.40\u201343 Cyanine dyes, in particular, are highly attractive as fluorescence probes for bioanalytical applications.44\u201349 They offer high fluorescence efficiency, increased photostability, high fluorescence quantum yield, and the potential to design tailor-made fluorescence probes covering a wide spectral range in absorption and fluorescence.50 Usually, cyanine dyes are based on two heteroarenes coupled by a polymethine chain, which determines the spectral properties of the dye molecule.51\u201353 Issues related to low solubility, self-quenching, and self-aggregation can be reduced by introducing functional groups such as sulfonic acid.54\u201358 We chose a water-soluble cyanine dye, DY-631, with absorption and emission maxima in water at 623 and 651 nm, respectively, to provide an additional dimension to the l-LDDO studies [Fig. 1(b)]. Since the dye has three negatively charged groups (two SO3\u2212 and COO\u2212), it was expected to form a complex with the positively charged surfactant, allowing better visualization of its entry into and exit from the pores of the active silica particles using red light (\u03bb = 625 nm), which does not affect the behavior of the azobenzene-containing surfactant. Interestingly, the dye itself also affected the system, namely, it affected the photo-stationary ratio of the two isomers, leading to differences in the duration and strength of the diffusioosmotic flow. Therefore, a comprehensive study of the system was necessary for the interpretation of the results, which we have conducted.\nThus, in this paper, we present a multi-dimensional study of the local light-driven diffusioosmotic (l-LDDO) flow in a dye-labeled solution of a photosensitive surfactant, which enforces long-range attraction, repulsion, and interaction with the dye under global illumination with UV (\u03bb = 365 nm) and blue (\u03bb = 455 nm) light. We demonstrate the formation of a complex between the photosensitive surfactant and its influence on the cis/trans ratio of the surfactant and, subsequently, the process of LDDO. We also described the dynamic and luminescent behavior of the aforementioned threecomponent system under irradiation with global UV and blue light and the process of local light-driven diffusioosmosis in the presence and absence of the dye."

The cis isomer is characterized by two absorption bands with maxima at 313 and 437 nm (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0\u2217 and n\u2013\u03c0\u2217 transitions, respectively). The lifetime of the cis isomer in the dark or under red illumination (\u03bb = 600 nm) is \u223c48 h, while the cis-to-trans photoisomerization under irradiation with blue light (\u03bb = 450 nm, I = 1.5 mW/cm2) takes place within a few seconds, reaching a photo-stationary state (\u223c65% fraction of the trans isomer) after 10 min of irradiation. Under UV illumination (\u03bb = 375 nm) at the photo-stationary state, 90% of the surfactant molecules are in the cis state.62\nDY631 has a characteristic absorption band at \u03bb = 623 nm in water [Fig. 1(d)]. The dye molecule possesses three negatively charged groups (two SO3\u2212 and one COO\u2212), suggesting the potential formation of a complex between a dye molecule and three cationic surfactant molecules. To test this hypothesis, we recorded absorption spectra of aqueous solutions of DY631 with varying concentrations of AzoC6 [Fig. 2(a)]. Upon reaching a 1:5 ratio of DY631/AzoC6, we observed a shift in the characteristic absorption\nband of the dye (\u03bb = 623 \u2192 648 nm), indicating the formation of a complex between AzoC6 and DY631. Further decreases in the DY631/AzoC6 ratio did not result in a larger red shift of the band, confirming that the system had reached its equilibrium state at a 1:5 DY631/AzoC6 (D/A) molar ratio. Therefore, this concentration ratio was used in all reported spectroscopy experiments unless otherwise specified.\nSubsequent illumination of the AzoC6 + DY631 solution with blue (\u03bb = 455 nm) and UV (\u03bb = 365 nm) light [Fig. 2(b)] led to the destruction of the complex, as evidenced by a blue shift of the DY631 absorption peak (\u03bb = 638\u2192 626 nm and \u03bb = 638\u2192 622 nm for blue and UV irradiation, respectively). To investigate the influence of the dye on the cis/trans ratios of AzoC6 under blue and UV irradiation, we recorded a series of absorption kinetics at \u03bb = 375 nm. The studied solutions contained a fixed concentration of AzoC6 (25 \u03bcM) and a variable concentration of DY631 (0\u201325 \u03bcM) at different concentration ratios. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table I, the equilibrium state was reached at different trans-cis-isomers ratios.\nUnder UV irradiation, the proportion of trans-isomers in pure AzoC6 solution is 10%.30 However, with an increase in the concentration of DY631 in the solution, the proportion of trans-isomers gradually increases, reaching 41% at the D/A ratio of 1:1 [Fig. 3(a)]. Under blue irradiation, the proportion of trans-isomers at the equi-\nTABLE I.

Regarding the influence of the red LED, in the AzoC6 solution, there is no significant difference in decay times with or without red LED under both blue and UV illumination. However, in the AzoC6+DY631 solution, red light caused a 20% increase in decay times compared to the samples without red LED illumination under both blue and UV light. This behavior can be attributed to the complex formation between the dye and surfactant molecules, which leads to a competition for energy processes between the isomerization of AzoC6 and the excitation followed by luminescence of the dye.\nThe significant difference in isomer ratios observed depending on the dye concentration in the solution can be attributed to the formation of the AzoC6-DY631. This complex formation introduces additional energy and steric hindrance, which affects the isomerization reaction. Indeed, even the steric hindrance upon micellization has been shown to significantly alter the isomerization quantum yields and the extinction coefficients, thereby slowing down the trans-cis photoisomerization compared to the free molecules of the surfactant.65 In the presence of the dye, the additional electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged molecules further modify the photoisomerization process.\nAnother parameter that required investigation was the influence of the red LED on the isomerization behavior of AzoC6 in the presence and absence of the organic dye. Decay curves of the characteristic trans-band of AzoC6 at \u03bb = 351 nm were recorded until reaching an equilibrium state [e.g. Figure 4(a)], and the decay time was calculated using Eq. (3). The influence of LED intensities on the decay times of AzoC6 and AzoC6-DY631 solutions under various combinations of red and blue/UV LEDs is shown in Fig. 4(b). The intensity of the red LED was kept constant (\u03bb = 625 nm, 1 mW/cm2)\nwhile the intensity of the blue/UV LED (\u03bb = 455/365 nm) was varied between 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 mW/cm2. In the control measurement, the sample was illuminated by UV/blue LED (1 mW/cm2) alone.\nIt can be noted that the influence of the blue/UV intensity on the decay time was noticeable and inversely proportional for both AzoC6 and AzoC6-DY631 solutions. Regarding the influence of the red LED, in the AzoC6 solution, there was no noticeable difference in decay times with or without red LED under both blue and UV illumination. However, in the AzoC6+DY631solution, red light caused a 20% increase in decay times compared to the samples without red LED illumination under both blue and UV light. This behavior could be attributed to the complex formation between the dye and surfactant molecules, which led to a competition for energy processes between the isomerization of AzoC6 and excitation followed by luminescence of the dye.\nThe presence of dye molecules leads to different trans/cis ratios in the photo-stationary states, which, in turn, affected the velocity of the light-driven diffusioosmotic (LDDO) flow. As mentioned in Ref. 29, the velocity of the diffusioosmotic flow depends on the gradient of cis-isomers generated during irradiation with modulated light. Without the dye, under UV illumination, \u223c90% of all surfactant molecules switched to the cis-state. However, the presence of dye reduced this percentage (as shown in Table I). Consequently, the velocity of the flow (as indicated in Table II) decreased, as evidenced by the velocity of the tracer particles (plain silica particles with a diameter of 5 \u03bcm) shown in Fig. 5.\nFigure 5 and Videos S1\u2013S3 in the supplementary material clearly show a noticeable difference in the velocity of the \u201ccleansing\u201d process when even a small quantity of dye was added to the surfactant solution. In Fig. 5, it can be observed that the entire area was completely \u201ccleansed\u201d after \u223c11 min of irradiation. However, in the solution with just 0.2 \u03bcM DY631, even after 42 min, not all silica particles were removed. The velocity of an average particle was calculated for all three cases, and the trend is evident (Table II): as the dye concentration in the solution increased, there was a signif-\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224907 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0174638 159, 224907-6\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n09 January 2024 10:57:48\nicant decrease in the average particle velocity. This phenomenon can be attributed to the previously discussed alteration of the cis- and trans-isomer ratios of AzoC6 due to the presence of the dye. By extrapolating the dependence presented in Table I, it can be assumed that the concentration of cis-isomers of AzoC6 in solution under UV irradiation would be 86% and 88% for 0.20 and 0.05 \u03bcM DY631, respectively. The extrapolation graphs and equations can be seen in Fig. S2 in the supplementary material. The dependence can be fitted as an exponential decay since the concentration of the surfactant is considerably higher than that of the dye, and the formation of the complex is only limited by the concentration of DY631.\nIncorporation of dye\u2013surfactant complex into porous particles\nTo prove the incorporation of the dye\u2013surfactant complex into the pores of the microparticles, as opposed to adsorption on the flat surface of non-porous colloids, we recorded a time-lapse of the incubation process using a mixture of porous and non-porous silica microparticles with an aqueous solution containing 1 mM AzoC6 and 50 \u03bcM DY631 (Fig. 6). The results clearly demonstrate that over time, the brightness of the porous particles increased, particularly in the center, indicating the penetration of the dye-surfactant complex into the pores. On the other hand, the non-porous silica particles showed no signs of interaction with the fluorescent solution. Therefore, we can confidently confirm that the incorporation of the dye indeed occurred within the microparticles\u2019 pores. This process is governed by micellization of the surfactant within the particle, which takes place at much smaller concentrations than the solution critical micelle concentration (CMC) due to micelle charge neutralization by charges on the pores surface, while the native counter ions are expelled out of the pores.38\nTo further support our findings, we conducted a similar experiment using an aqueous solution of 1 mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), a surfactant of similar size and with the same polar head as AzoC6, along with 50 \u03bcM DY631. In addition, we performed the experiment using an aqueous solution of 50 \u03bcM\nJ. Chem.

The results of these experiments can be observed in Videos S6 and S7 in the supplementary material.\nIn the case of CTAB, we observed a similar pattern of dye incorporation as seen in the 1 mM solution of AzoC6. This further confirms the ability of the dye-surfactant complex to penetrate and be incorporated into the particles. However, when DY631 was dissolved in water alone, no observable incorporation of the dye into the particles was detected, indicating that the presence of the surfactant molecule is necessary for the incorporation due to the repulsion between the negatively charged dye and the pores.\nGeneration of local-light-driven diffusioosmotic flow in the three-component system\nPorous silica particles with a diameter of 5 \u03bcm were dispersed in a 1 mM aqueous solution of the photosensitive surfactant, either containing an aliquot of DY-631 or without it. The dispersion was then introduced into a closed chamber and placed under an optical microscope, as described in the \u201cExperimental section.\u201d Image acquisition was performed under general illumination with red light at a wavelength of 625 nm.\nIn the samples without the dye, the behavior of the system aligned with previous descriptions found in Refs 27, 28, and 30. Specifically, when non-focused UV light at a wavelength of 365 nm was switched on, the mesoporous silica particles that had been sedimented at the glass surface started to repel each other, resulting in\ntheir separation and the formation of a grid-like structure. However, this grid-like order was only transient, as over several minutes, the particles began to agglomerate again, leading to the loss of the grid-like arrangement. This happens due to the formation of a local depletion zone of trans-isomers in the vicinity of the porous colloids.\nAs for the samples containing DY-631, we could observe two simultaneous phenomena: on the one hand, the motion of the mesoporous particles, and on the other, their luminescent behavior. In the presence of DY-631 and under global UV light illumination, the particles immediately repelled each other, resulting in a rapid and intense burst of luminescence from the dye. However, this was followed by particle aggregation, similar to the case without the dye [refer to Fig. 7(a)], and the complete disappearance of the luminescence from the dye [refer to Fig. 7(b)].\nWe hypothesize that the observed behavior in the presence of DY-631 can be attributed to the rapid destruction of most dye\u2013surfactant complexes and the conversion of the majority of AzoC6 molecules to the cis-state. This process leads to a swift outward flow, carrying the dye molecules into the surrounding solution. Consequently, the background luminescence of the solution becomes undetectable, and there are few dye molecules remaining inside the particles. Simultaneously, the local lack of osmotic pressure around the particles induces their thermal motion.\nWhen global (non-focused) blue light (\u03bb = 455 nm) was switched on with only AzoC6 and silica present, the particles started\nJ.

As for the system with DY631, its kinetic behavior was similar to the case without the dye\u2014with no additional illumination, the colloids aggregated on the glass surface, and under non-focused illumination with blue light (\u03bb = 455 nm), they repelled each other, forming a grid, which was, however, less stable\novertime than that in the dye-free solution [Fig. 8(b)]. This can be explained by the altered ratio of cis- and trans-isomers of AzoC6 in the system caused by the presence of the dye (Table I). Here, the ratio of trans-AzoC6 was expected to be slightly higher compared to the regular dye-free solution; however, the presence of the dye means that a portion of the surfactant molecules is present in the\nJ.

This inevitably affects the expected CMC levels: normally, this value is 0.5 mM for the trans- and 4 mM for the cis-isomer of AzoC6.29 However, in the system where complexation is present, the CMC of the trans isomer to is higher, which influences the l-LDDO process. The luminescence of the particles steadily increased over time, indicating a constant process of the destruction of the dye-Azo complex and consequent release of the free dye molecules. As can be seen from the spectra in Fig. 9(a),\nthe illumination of the system with blue light produced a significant increase in the absorption of the dye (at \u03bb = 631 nm), which supports this hypothesis. We could suggest that the system reached an equilibrium: the isomerization of trans-isomers to cis-form of the surfactant inside the pores and simultaneous destruction of the dyeAzo complex produced an outward diffusion of the surfactant out of the pores, while the surrounding trans-isomers diffused inward, formed new complex molecules that were, in turn, destroyed again.\nFIG. 10.

In the case of UV irradiation, the transition was fast and DY631 molecules were carried out of the microparticles by the cisAzoC6. In the case of blue irradiation, the trans-cis isomerization was slower, as shown by rate constants calculated from the graphs in Fig. 9: 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 vs 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm\u22122 (mW \u00d7 s\u22121) for UV and blue light, respectively (rate constants were calculated as in Ref. 62 for the intensities used for microcopy experiments).\nThus, a constant process of complex destruction, exodus of cis-AzoC6, and the inward flow of the new trans-AzoC6-DY631 complex molecules into the pores to eventually be isomerized formed a cycle. This cycle ultimately led to the accumulation of DY631 molecules in the pores and resulted in the observed increase in illumination as depicted in Fig. 8.\nAs for the influence of the UV/blue LED intensity on the l-LDDO process in the system, the experiment was performed at UV (\u03bb = 365 nm, I = 1.28, 4.35, and 8.10 mW/cm2) and blue (4.32, 12.10, and 21.60 mW/cm2) irradiation, and the intensity of the red LED (\u03bb = 365 nm) was kept constant at 1.8 \u03bcW/cm2. We observed an increase in the dye luminescence brightness with the increase in the blue LED intensity, while with the UV LED, the difference was not that obvious due to the fast quenching of the dye luminescence (Fig. S3, supplementary material)."

            "text": "In this work, we have successfully demonstrated the formation of a complex between the surfactant AzoC6 and DY631 and used it to gain a deeper understanding of the light-driven diffusioosmotic phenomenon. We have shown that the AzoC6-DY631 is destroyed under blue (\u03bb = 455 nm) and UV (\u03bb = 365 nm) irradiation, coinciding with the trans-cis isomerization of the surfactant. Furthermore, we have observed that the presence of the dye in the solution can significantly alter the cis/trans ratio of AzoC6, reaching up to a 30% change in the photo-stationary state after UV irradiation. Consequently, even at relatively low concentrations of DY631, the \u201cpassive\u201d light-driven diffusioosmotic flow was found to be three times slower compared to the system without the dye.\nMoreover, our study has demonstrated that the DY631-AzoC6 complex is incorporated into the pores of the silica particles. This phenomenon was also observed in the case of CTAB, a non-azobenzene-containing cationic surfactant. Conversely, in the absence of AzoC6, the repulsion between the negatively charged dye and the pores prevented the molecules from entering the colloids.\nWe have further investigated the local-light-driven diffusioosmotic flow in the three-component system comprising AzoC6, DY631, and porous silica colloids. Under non-focused UV light, the particles exhibited rapid repulsion and separation, followed by agglomeration after several minutes of continuous irradiation,\nconsistent with previous observations in the absence of the dye. In the presence of DY631, the luminescence inside the colloids rapidly diminished, indicating a deficit of trans-AzoC6 within the pores and subsequent repellence of the dye molecules from the negatively charged pores.\nUnder global non-focused blue irradiation, the particles separated, forming a uniform grid (stable over time), due to a continuous in-and-out flow of trans- and cis-AzoC6 isomers, respectively. In case of the DY631-containing system, the luminescence inside the colloids has even increased overtime, suggesting a continuous process of complex formation and destruction between AzoC6 and DY631 complex and possible accumulation of the dye molecules, brought in as part of the complex to be destroyed, inside the pores. The dye luminescence brightness increased with the increase in the blue LED intensity, while the UV LED did not demonstrate such a clear trend due to the rapid quenching of the dye luminescence.\nOverall, this study has provided valuable insights into the l-LDDO process and the interaction between azobenzenecontaining surfactants and organic dyes. The findings serve as a foundation for further investigations and hold potential for applications such as light-mediated targeted delivery and imaging."
