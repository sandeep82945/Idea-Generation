    "abstractText": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a kind of typical degenerative disorder of the skeletal muscle system caused by many factors including aging, abnormal mechanical stress and inflammatory responses. Glycitin is a natural isoflavone extracted from legumes. Previous studies have found that it is anti-inflammatory and promotes wound repair. However, the role of Glycitin in IVDD has not been elucidated. In the present research, we were surprised that Glycitin antagonized the NF-\u03baB pathway activity. In addition, we also found that Glycitin alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced metabolic disorders, extracellular matrix degradation, oxidative stress, inflammation responses, and mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, in in vivo experimental study, we discovered Glycitin attenuated IVDD. The results revealed that Glycitin alleviated the degenerative phenotype of IVDD. According to this research, Glycitin has anti-inflammatory properties that might exert a protective function in IVDD, suggesting a prospective therapeutic approach for IVDD.",

            "text": "Low back pain (LBP) has become the main reason for global productivity decline and the leading reason for disability in most countries [1, 2]. Relevant studies have shown that 80% of adults have suffered from LBP at some point, and the prevalence is higher in older age groups [3]. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is receiving increasing attention as a major cause of LBP [4]. The nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration is key\nfeature of IVDD, manifested by dysfunction of this kind of cells and ECM degradation [5].\nThe mechanisms of IVDD were not sufficiently clarified. Previous research discovered that the expression of inflammatory factors enhanced in degenerative intervertebral discs, which further accelerated aging and apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells, and affected the metabolism of ECM [6, 7]. Among the many inflammatory factors involved, tumor necrosis factor\nIntervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a kind of typical degenerative disorder of the skeletal muscle system caused by many factors including aging, abnormal mechanical stress and inflammatory responses. Glycitin is a natural isoflavone extracted from legumes. Previous studies have found that it is anti-inflammatory and promotes wound repair. However, the role of Glycitin in IVDD has not been elucidated. In the present research, we were surprised that Glycitin antagonized the NF-\u03baB pathway activity. In addition, we also found that Glycitin alleviated TNF-\u03b1-induced metabolic disorders, extracellular matrix degradation, oxidative stress, inflammation responses, and mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, in in vivo experimental study, we discovered Glycitin attenuated IVDD. The results revealed that Glycitin alleviated the degenerative phenotype of IVDD. According to this research, Glycitin has anti-inflammatory properties that might exert a protective function in IVDD, suggesting a prospective therapeutic approach for IVDD.\nwww.aging-us.com 13694 AGING\n(TNF-\u03b1) has received much attention because of its position as a predominant pro-inflammatory cytokine and its critical role in the pathogenesis of multiple disease processes [8, 9]. In the degenerative nucleus pulposus, the TNF-\u03b1 levels were markedly increased, and were positively related to disc degeneration level [10]. Moreover, anti-TNF-\u03b1 cytokines and drugs exhibit the potential to delay or treatment IVD degeneration [11]. Furthermore, activation of the TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory pathway in degenerative intervertebral discs further leads to accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (Lipid ROS) and activation of oxidative stress responses [12].\nGlycitin (C22H22O10) is a physiologically active natural isoflavone produced by soybeans during growth [13]. Previous studies results have shown that Glycitin has a crucial position in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, anti-osteoarthritis, anti-osteoporosis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and promoting wound healing [14, 15]. What\u2019s more, Glycitin was discovered to exert an important function in inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway in multiple diseases [16].\nIt is believed that the NF-\u03baB pathway leads to inflammatory factors released in NP cells, promotes the production of inflammatory microenvironment in NP tissue, causes homeostatic imbalance in NP cells, and plays a key role in IVDD [17]. But constricting the NF-\u03baB pathway activity can delay disc degeneration [18, 19]. Nevertheless, the role of Glycitin in IVDD has not yet been clearly evaluated. This research was designed to determine the role and underly molecular mechanism of Glycitin in IVDD."

            "text": "Glycitin alleviated the TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory response\nThe high level of inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1, is a key factor in IVDD process [21]. Hence, we investigated the impact of Glycitin on IVDD progression by subjecting HNPCs to different treatments for 24 hours to assess mRNA levels and for 48 hours to assess protein levels. These treatments included DMSO, TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), and TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) + Glycitin (100 \u03bcg/ml). The results depicted in Figure 1A\u20131C, reflected through RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis, demonstrated a significant upregulation in the mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory molecules such as iNOS and COX-2 in the presence of TNF-\u03b1. But the expression of relevant molecules was significantly reduced upon Glycitin treatment.\nFurthermore, statistical analysis further confirmed the notable difference (Figure 1D, 1E). Additionally, Figure 1F, 1G presented the immunofluorescence staining, illustrating the expression of COX-2. This staining exhibited that Glycitin treatment effectively mitigated the TNF-\u03b1 -induced inflammation of HNPCs.\nGlycitin retained ECM metabolism of HNPCs in stimulation of TNF-\u03b1\nThe nucleus pulposus tissue consists predominantly of type II collagen and Aggrecan [22]. The degradation of components within the extracellular matrix is a critical characteristic of intervertebral disc degeneration [23]. Previous studies have indicated that TNF-\u03b1 promotes the upregulation of ADAMTSs and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), resulting in the breakdown of ECM and the inhibition of ECM anabolism [24]. To analyse the role of Glycitin in maintaining ECM homeostasis in degenerative intervertebral discs, this study cultured and stimulated HNPCs with DMSO, TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), or TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) + Glycitin (100 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h to assess mRNA levels and for 48 h to determine protein levels. The results depicted in Figure 2A\u20132D show that TNF-\u03b1 stimulation led to a decline in the mRNA expression levels of anabolic biomarkers Col-2 and Aggrecan, while elevating the catabolic biomarkers MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 expression. Interestingly, the additional use of Glycitin significantly altered these trends. Figure 2E\u20132I demonstrate that Glycitin reversed the TNF-\u03b1-induced decrease in Aggrecan, Col-2 protein level and reduced the protein level of MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5. Importantly, as Figure 2J\u20132M, our studies were further verified by IF staining.\nGlycitin attenuated TNF-\u03b1-induced HNPCs apoptosis in HNPCs\nPrevious studies have indicated that the progression of IVDD involves the crucial role of apoptosis in nucleus\nwww.aging-us.com 13697 AGING\npulposus cells [25, 26]. This paper researched the potential of Glycitin in treating apoptosis in HNPCs, the cells were incubated with TNF-\u03b1, with or without Glycitin for 24h and mRNA levels of apoptosis-related\nmolecules were measured. As depicted in Figure 3A\u20133C, the transcriptional level changes of Bax, Caspase-3, and Bcl-2 induced by TNF-\u03b1 were observed to be restored by the inclusion of Glycitin. Additionally, the cells\nwww.aging-us.com 13698 AGING\nwww.aging-us.com 13699 AGING\nwww.aging-us.com 13700 AGING\nunderwent the indicated treatments for 48 hours to assess the expression of apoptosis indexes expression at the protein levels. The Western blot analysis demonstrated the inhibitory function of Glycitin on TNF-\u03b1-caused apoptosis in HNPCs (Figure 3D\u20133G).\nTo gain further insights into the therapeutic role of Glycitin in HNPCs apoptosis, the flow cytometry (Figure 3H, 3I) and the TUNEL assay (Figure 3J) were employed. These measurements provided evidence that Glycitin significantly reversed TNF-\u03b1-mediated cell apoptosis.\nGlycitin improved TNF-\u03b1-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in HNPCs\nIt is known that exacerbation of oxidative stress and dysfunction of mitochondria are closely associated with IVD degeneration [27\u201329]. To analysis the potential inhibitory effect of Glycitin on that in HNPCs, this study cultured HNPCs with DMSO, TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) + Glycitin (100 \u03bcg/ml). In this study, as shown in Figure 4A, JC1 staining was conducted to measure the mitochondrial dysfunction by membrane potential, and we found the dysfunction which resulted by TNF-\u03b1 were alleviated after treatment with Glycitin. Furthermore, to assess the influence of Glycitin on mitochondrial\nROS during IVDD, DCFDA staining assays were employed, as depicted in Figure 4B. The outcomes revealed the efficacy of Glycitin in protecting against disc degeneration in HNPCs by inhibiting TNF-\u03b1mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.\nGlycitin protected against the degeneration of IVD in rats in vivo\nTo further assess the attenuation of IVDD by Glycitin, we utilized the rat IVD needle puncture model. The rats were subjected to intraperitoneal administration for 4 weeks, as depicted in Figure 5A. As Figure 5B, 5C, X-ray indicated the IVD height was obviously lost in the model group. But Glycitin effectively reversed such trend. Moreover, MRI-T2WI result indicated that Glycitin obviously prevented signal intensity loss (Figure 5D, 5E). Thereafter, Safranin O staining and Masson staining were employed to evaluate cartilage tissue loss induced by needle puncture injury, and Glycitin exhibited a rescuing effect in preventing cartilaginous tissue destruction (Figure 5F, 5H, 5I). Further examination through H&E staining demonstrated the detrimental impact of needle puncture injury on the tissue structure of the IVD (Figure 5F, 5G). Conversely, the additional use of Glycitin effectively restored the structural damage caused by the injury.\nwww.aging-us.com 13701 AGING\nGlycitin antagonized the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway\nNumerous studies suggested a strong correlation between IVDD and the NF-\u03baB pathway [30, 31].\nTo analyse the potential ability of Glycitin to prevent the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway, we cultured and stimulated HNPCs using TNF-\u03b1, and following treatment with or without Glycitin, total cellular mRNA was extracted. As indicated in Figure 6A, we found that Glycitin\nwww.aging-us.com 13702 AGING\nwww.aging-us.com 13703 AGING\nindicated group (n=3). Scale bar, 100 \u00b5m.

The values represent the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 vs. control group.\neffectively hindered the activation of NF-\u03baB. Thereafter, at different time points, we collected total cellular proteins, the Western blot showed that Glycitin completely suppressed this kind of phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 at indicated different time points (Figure 6B\u20136D). In addition, the TNF-\u03b1-mediated increase in pI\u03baB\u03b1 expression levels was abolished by Glycitin, as shown by IF staining in Figure 6E, 6F.\nTo further validate the Glycitin intervention on NF-\u03baB pathway, the translocation of p65 was analyzed by IF staining (Figure 6G, 6H) and Western blotting analysis (Figure 6I\u20136K). Our findings indicate that TNF-\u03b1 largely increased the translocation level of p65 to the nucleus. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous use of Glycitin reversed TNF-\u03b1-mediated P65 translocation."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Numerous studies suggested that nucleus pulposus cells in IVDD can produce and secrets a variety of inflammatory factors, like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, iNOS, TNF-\u03b1 [7, 22, 32]. TNF-\u03b1 is related to many pathological variations of IVDD and it is considered as a crucial element of the inflammatory cascade, and its levels are positively correlated to IVDD severity [33]. TNF-\u03b1 can also lead to increased catabolism of IVD by inducing the level of MMPs and ADAMTSs, disrupting the balance of the myeloid environment, exacerbating ECM degradation, and further accelerating IVDD [34]. Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 can stimulate NP cells to generate a number of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby intensifying the inflammatory responses [12]. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 was implicated in disc herniation and nerve irritation and in growth. It was indicated that a key role of TNF-\u03b1 in the progression of IVDD [35, 36]. As a result, TNF-\u03b1 is a potential target for clinical intervention of IVDD. In present research, we stimulated nucleus pulposus cells with TNF-\u03b1 to reveal the function and mechanisms of Glycitin in preventing IVDD. Glycitin is a natural isoflavone isolated from plants. The safety of Glycitin is our primary concern, and we have gone through a series of experiments to ensure its safety in cells and mice (Supplementary Figure 1).\nCompared with the DMSO group, TNF-\u03b1 effecttively caused the inflammatory response, significantly\nincreasing the level of inflammatory factors, including COX-2 and iNOS. Interestingly, the inflammatory response caused by TNF-\u03b1 was inhibited after therapy with Glycitin compared with the TNF-\u03b1 induce group, which reflected that Glycitin may alleviate the inflammatory level of degenerative intervertebral discs. In addition, TNF-\u03b1 leads to increased expression of destructive matrix components (MMP-13 and ADAMTS5), resulting in significantly reduced expression of extracellular matrix components, including Aggrecan and Col-2. In this study, Glycitin effectively reversed the TNF-\u03b1-mediated loss of Col-2 and Aggrecan, and reduced the level of MMP-13 and ADAMTS5, suggesting that Glycitin is a key role in metabolic disorders of IVD.\nPrevious research confirmed that TNF-\u03b1 can promote apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells [37, 38]. The imbalance of Bax and Bcl-2 level induced C-caspase3 expression and caused NP cells apoptosis, which are related to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway during intervertebral disc degeneration. According to the current study, Glycitin treatment decreased Bax and C-caspase-3 level, while Bcl-2 expression enhanced. It is implied that Glycitin reduces the increase in TNF\u03b1 -mediated apoptosis of HNPCs cells.\nSome scholars found that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in IVDD development [39]. Our study found that HNPCs after TNF-\u03b1 treatment had increased ROS expression levels and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential than the control group. Many scholars found that there is a crosstalk between ROS and TNF-\u03b1 [40]. ROS production leads to oxidative stress, which is very important in the inflammatory process [41]. ROS can activate various transcription factors, causing differential expression of many genes related to the inflammatory pathway [42]. NF-\u03baB is a typical transcription factor [43]. And ROS translocates the active NF-\u03baB to nucleus, where it induces the expression of abundant molecules, like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which are molecules associated with the inflammatory response of IVDD [44]. Our findings suggest that Glycitin significantly reversed these changes.\nTo further validate the therapeutic effect of Glycitin in IVDD, we designed in vivo experiments to investigate. By establishing the needle puncture rat IVDD model,\nwww.aging-us.com 13704 AGING\nwe found that the results of needle puncture injury included alteration of disc signal, reduction of disc height and loss of cartilage [45]. The results showed that Glycitin has a protective function in IVDD and exhibited a treatment effect in the rat IVD needle puncture model.\nIn addition, the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is a classic downstream inflammatory pathway activated by TNF-\u03b1 and is closely associated with the development of multiple inflammatory degenerative diseases [46]. In intervertebral disc degeneration, activation of the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway leads to the secretion of inflammatory factors from nucleus pulposus cells, promoting the generation of an inflammatory microenvironment in nucleus pulposus tissue and causing a homeostatic imbalance in the nucleus pulposus tissue internal environment [5, 47]. It is widely believed that activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is related to IVDD; activation of this pathway leads to accelerated disc degeneration, whereas blocking this signaling pathway activation alleviates the aging\nprocess [48]. TNF-\u03b1, mainly by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway, is related to various pathological processes of intervertebral disc degeneration [12]. By detecting the level of mRNA, the results indicated that the Glycitin inhibited the TNF-\u03b1-induced increase in NF\u03baB1 level. TNF-\u03b1 increases the levels of key parameters of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, including pI\u03baB and p-P65 protein. Intriguingly, the expression levels of pI\u03baB\u03b1 and p-P65 were remarkably decreased by Glycitin therapy. Moreover, the translocation of p65 indicates the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. However, Glycitin abolished P65 nuclear translocation. Glycitin appears to be beneficial in inhibiting TNF\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling in IVDD (Figure 7). Further, we showed that Glycitin is comparable to SN50 in inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in IVDD and is a potential NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 2). However, it is unclear which molecules were targeted by Glycitin during this process, which will be the topic of our next studies. In conclusion, the findings from in vivo and in vitro suggest that Glycitin has great potential in the treatment of IVDD.\nwww.aging-us.com 13705 AGING"
