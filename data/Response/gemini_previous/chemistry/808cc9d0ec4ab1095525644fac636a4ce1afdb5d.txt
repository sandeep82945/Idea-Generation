1. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of other PGMs, such as platinum, rhodium, and iridium, from spent automotive catalysts.** This would help to further demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method and its potential for recovering a wider range of valuable metals from secondary sources.


2. **Explore the use of different types of bioreactors for the production of biogenic thiosulfate.** This could include investigating the use of membrane bioreactors, which have been shown to be effective for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from biogas, or using different types of microorganisms that are capable of producing thiosulfate.


3. **Optimize the bioleaching process for the recovery of PGMs from spent automotive catalysts.** This could involve investigating the effects of different leaching parameters, such as temperature, pH, and the concentration of thiosulfate, on the leaching efficiency.


4. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of PGMs from other secondary sources, such as electronic waste and spent chemical catalysts.** This would help to demonstrate the broader applicability of the proposed method and its potential for recovering PGMs from a variety of sources.


5. **Conduct a life cycle assessment of the proposed method for the recovery of PGMs from spent automotive catalysts.** This would help to evaluate the environmental impacts of the process and compare it to other methods for recovering PGMs from secondary sources.
