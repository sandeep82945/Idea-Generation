            "text": "Page 2/15\nIntroduction An integral part of anatomical science is constituted by the variant anatomy which is related to the abnormalities within the human body morphology. For a long time, variations of the normal human anatomy were well-illustrious and oftentimes were cases of gross abnormalities, such as a hand with six digits [2]. The systematic study of human anatomy granted a revivi cation, and before the discovery of xrays, the understanding of most anatomical variants discovered either through cadaveric dissection or incidentally at surgery is based on anatomic experience. With the advent of radiographs, it became clear the spectrum of variations from the standard anatomy was far broader than had been appreciated. The cognizance of variants in anatomy has to be considered an integral part of anatomy schooling [6, 24]; knowledge of common variants re ects the ability to recognize the diverse clinical reality of anatomy. One such variation in the structural morphology of the coronoid process of mandible was recently identi ed by Nyer Firdoose and has been elaborated as coronoid foramen (Fig.\u00a01) in the Oro-facial region [11]. The foramen in the coronoid process was seen to exist in only fossils including early genera and was recovered as a paenungulate Synapomorphy suggesting a phylogenetic hypothesis [3, 10, 32].\nThere was no literature on the presence of coronoid foramen in the mandible of living humans until the mention of the same in the case reported with a stereolithographic 3D reconstructed model by Firdoose [11]. Clinicians need to be aware of the prevalence of anatomic variants so patients could be prevented from being (mis)treated for pseudo pathology based upon a misunderstanding of a normal anatomical variation as a pathological nding [8, 27].\nMuch to the good fortune of the present era comprising the latest investigatory advancements like conebeam computed tomography (CBCT) is a de nite paradigm shift from the conventional 2D to 3D approach providing simple applicability and integration into conventional practices, including higher image sharpness and lower radiation dose to the osseous structures. Real anatomy exists in three dimensions and CBCT imaging with its high spatial resolution provides superior image quality and allows accurate three-dimensional visualization of anatomic variations such as mandibular accessory foramina (MAF) and minute nutrient canals in comparison with the panoramic radiography [26, 30].\nPage 3/15\nOwing to the scarcity of literature, the authors in this script aim at presenting a detailed assessment of the coronoid foramen terming it as \u2018foramen of Nyer\u2019 (FN) based on the person rst identifying it [11]; in a clinical series to determine its prevalence using CBCT while evaluating its variability in terms of unilateral, bilateral or gender predilection and propose the signi cance of such an anatomic variation in clinical practice.\nMaterial And Methods A total of 19,979 Panoramic radiographs were evaluated from August 2015 till Dec 2021 of which 7,768 were excluded for being duplicate radiographs taken as part of follow-up, further 9,573 radiographs were excluded as lack of CBCT co-relation/maxillary scans. Finally, 2,638 patients having undergone CBCT assessment of the mandibular region for various reasons involving bone evaluation for implant placement and pathologic lesion exclusion were considered. Further 470 scans out of 2,638 (Figure 2) were excluded because of insu cient quality, a low eld of view size, normal structural variations like Medial sigmoid depression (MSD), images with artifacts, fracture, or pathologies in the posterior region of the mandible. Each author did the screening independently to reach a nal consensus.\u00a0\nAll procedures followed were per the protocol of the work centre and ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.\u00a0This study was approved by the ethical board with vide approval number 20- 242E.\nPanoramic radiography parameters:\nAll panoramic radiographs were acquired using Picasso Trio SC 12*7, 3 in 1 system with integrated EzDent software having technical parameters: Image volume size 12 x 7 cm, D-051 stationary anode type tube, tube current 2-10 mA, tube voltage 40 - 90 kV, focal spot 0.5 mm, total ltration 2.8 mm Aluminum, exposure time 11.3 s / 13.2 s.\nCone beam computed tomography parameters:\u00a0\nThe basic mandible reconstruction was performed based on volumetric methods of scanning using 3D CBCT by Orthopantomograph OP300 scanner with technical parameters: image volume size 80 \u00d7 150 mm, tube current 15 mA, tube voltage 80 kV, scan time 16 s, exposure time 12 s pulsed X-ray was used for all images.\u00a0\nThe software used was DICOM OnDemand3D from Cybermed, USA, for the reconstruction of sagittal, axial, coronal, and three-dimensional images. Image acquisition and\u00a0scans were reported and consulted by three specialists\u00a0with at least two-decade experience\u00a0in their respective elds of Maxillofacial radio diagnosis, medical imaging, and Head & Neck imaging to rule out the MSD, other possible pathologies and to rule out the occurrence of pseudo foramina or a pseudocyst as a post-acquisition or manipulation\nPage 4/15\nerror in doubtful cases.\u00a0All evaluations were performed on a 15.6-inch monitor with a resolution of 1366 x 768.\nStatistical analysis:\nThe data obtained were analyzed using\u00a0Statistical software SPSS 2.2.0 and R environment 3.2.2.\u00a0Descriptive and inferential analysis was done.\u00a0Based on the available data the following assumptions were considered: Dependent variables should be normally distributed, Scans drawn from the patients were random and cases of the scans being independent. The recorded variables were the patient's gender, age, distribution pattern, and surface localization of the foramina. The dependent variables were assessed\u00a0to see if they were normally distributed using a Shapiro-Wilk test.\nDescriptive statistics such as number, gender, age, and surface localization for the variables are represented in tables (Table 1 - 4). Chi-Square / Fisher Exact test was used to nd the signi cance of study parameters on a categorical scale between two or more groups & a non-parametric setting for qualitative data analysis was done. The Fisher Exact test was used when cell samples were small while investigating the normal distribution of the variables. On the interpretation of the results, the level of signi cance was set at 0.05; in the case of p<0.05, there was a signi cant association between variables, whereas in the case of p>0.05 there\u00a0was no signi cant association with the variables on a categorical scale.\nResults In the present research, mandibular scans from a total of 2168 patients were evaluated of which 1480 (68%) were females and 688 (32%) males, age range is between 8\u201380 years with a mean age of 41.5 years. Analysis for FN revealed its presence in 96 (4.4%) patients, among which 32 (1.5%) patients had FN unilaterally, the bilateral presence of FN was found in 59 (2.7%) patients, and bilateral FN with accessory foramina were found in 5 (0.2%) patients. From the unilateral type 13 (0.6%) were left-sided while 19 (0.9%) were right-sided respectively (Table\u00a01).\nThe association of variant type with gender revealed the presence of FN unilaterally in 21 (21.87%) females and 11 (11.4%) males, the bilateral variant type was seen in 39 (40.62%) females and 20 (20.83%) males, whereas the bilateral variant with accessory foramina was seen in 4 (4.16%) females and 1 (1.04%) male respectively. This showed no statistically signi cant difference in the presence of FN with regards to gender, p = 0.831 (p > 0.05) (Table\u00a02).\nThe FN based on surface localization was found to be more prevalent over the medial aspect 129 (74.6%) as compared to 44 (25.4%) over the lateral aspect (Table\u00a03).\nHowever, the association of the variant type with age showed a statistically signi cant relationship, p = 0.0058 (p < 0.05). Much of the bilateral variant type about 31 (68.9%) were found between the 41\u201350 years group followed by 11 (64.7%) in the 51\u201360 years group. Likewise, the unilateral left-sided variant 10\nPage 5/15\n(22.2%) were mostly found in the 41\u201350 years age group, whereas the unilateral right-sided variant 9 (69.2%) were identi ed in the 21\u201330 years group followed by 4 (8.9%) in the 41\u201350 years group. The bilateral with accessory foramina variant 3 (25%) was identi ed to be more prevalent in the 31\u201340 years group (Table\u00a04).\nThe coronoid process when considered as a triangular structure showed a signi cant distribution pattern of the foramina (Fig.\u00a03), from the 173 foramina identi ed majority were located towards the base up to 111 (64.2%) followed by the central aspect accounting for 28 (16.2%), the postero-superior aspect towards the sigmoid notch added up to 21 (12.1%) and the least being the antero-inferior surface accounting for only 13 (7.5%) (Table\u00a05).\nThe gender distribution of FN among the 96 patients is as follows: 64 (66.67%) females and 32 (33.33%) males, from the individual variant types: the unilateral left-sided variant was found in 13 (13.54%) patients of which 8 (8.33%) were females and 5 (5.2%) males, whereas the unilateral right-sided variant was observed in 19 (19.79%) patients of which 13 (13.54%) were females and 6 (6.2%) males, the bilateral variant was found in 59 (61.45%) patients of which 39 (40.62%) were females and 32 (20.83%) males respectively. Moreover, 5 (5.20%) patients had 13 accessory foramina around the main FN bilaterally of which 4 (4.16%) were females and 1 (1.04%) male (Table\u00a06).\nIn the present study, the gender distribution pattern based on age revealed a greater number of females compared to males in all age groups (Fig.\u00a04) and the gender distribution based on variant type revealed the prevalence of FN more in females compared to the males in the ratio of 1:2 both unilaterally and bilaterally (Fig.\u00a05).\nThe diameter of the FN was measured. when the measurement was less than 0.25mm it was measured as absent. The mean diameter of the FN was 1.89 and 2.32 mm \u00b1 0.22mm (range 0.26\u20134.28). All measurements were made on scale integrated in the cbct software. Two maxillofacial radiologists performed all the measurements.\nDiscussion Unearthing the con nes of normality in anatomical studies was and will never be easy. The exceptional work way back in 1542, which referred to anatomical variations 'De Humani Corporis Fabrica' merits Vesalius, for being the father of modern anatomy after Galen [14, 17, 29, 31]. Many several decades later Bergman et al, published a compendium of human anatomical variations which forms the most recent compilation of such observations in anatomical variants with scope for improvising additions with the newest editions [2]. The anatomy of organisms is not the same within each species is an established certainty by now, and this applies inter alia to humans [1, 17, 22, 29]. The anatomical variations consequently cannot be limited to variants or anomalies; it also encompasses \u201cnormal\u201d variation among individuals [6, 23, 25].\nPage 6/15\nIn the present study, we determined the FN as a normal anatomical variation in the coronoid process in human mandibles analyzed radiographically amongst the patients of Saudi origin. A systematic review identi ed only ve studies that reported the prevalence of FN in live humans [11, 12, 13, 15, 16]. Most of the foramina and canals continue towards progressive obliteration from birth to the rst year of life [1]. Any persistence of foramina into adulthood is considered as anatomic variation [17, 18, 23]. The rst description of FN in a live human was associated with the presence of lateral accessory foramina and canal on the mandibular ramus attributing itself to a phylogenetic hypothesis which implied that FN was not observed in humans except for fossilized mammals [11, 12]. It was Ferretti and Debruyne [10] mentioning in their article \u2018Elephas Maximus\u2019 as having a foramen and a canal merging with the alveolus at the distal-most erupting molar [3, 10]. This canal emerging as the coronoid canal was elaborated as a synapomorphic feature of paenungulates by Tassy and Shoshani [32]. Continuous studies of human morphology are warranted to understand better this anatomic variation. The youngest patient to date was a 7-year-old boy and the oldest patient was a 75-year-old lady to have the con rmed variation in their mandible, the only other published study of similar variation at such a young age was by Ghousia et al [15]. The study by Gunduz et al was in association with the accessory mandibular foramina in a Turkish population reporting a mere 2% presence of FN in a sample size of 979 radiographs scanned retrospectively [16]. The de ciency in their results can be attributed to the difference in sample size, interpretation methods, and other variables in comparison to our study. The present script is the only isolated study of the FN carried out meticulously to detail out its occurrence in both genders\u2019 along with its prevalence of occurrence on the left or right side of mandible and unilaterally or bilaterally while adding on much required valuable literature about this unique variant FN in mandible.\nClinical Implication\u00a0\nMAF is an opening apart from alveolar sockets, mandibular and mental foramina, and constant structure in the mandible [6,7,26]. MAF is commonly observed in the posterior mandible and symphysis region. Moreover, MAF is more frequently found on the medial surface of the mandible than on the lateral surface [20,21,23]. Bilateral symmetry is frequent, but variations are observed in size, number, and shape [28,32]. Undoubtedly, FN falls well under this category of a well-established normal variant of the mandibular accessory foramen.\nFor obvious reasons, these variants such as MAF and the FN have been reported to cause implications in clinical practice and may lead to complications if not previously determined.\u00a0These variant foramina are almost always occupied by the neurovascular bundle [7,20], leading to failure of local anesthesia over adjacent structures and or di culties in controlling intraosseous hemorrhage due to the presence of accessory blood vessels [8,21]. Understanding variations in the coronoid process of the mandible is particularly important for dental implants and several surgical operations such as orthognathic surgeries or corrective mandibular surgeries involving diagnostic techniques and therapeutic interventions [6,21,22,24]. \u00a0Also, it has been reported that accessory foramina in the mandible provide an easy way for tumor spread following radiotherapy [7,9,28]. If FN is present, the clinicians must be informed and careful while planning for radiotherapy. Clear information and understanding of anatomic and morphologic\nPage 7/15\nvariations of landmarks will help the surgeon thwart complications. For this reason, extensive and detailed preoperative radiologic assessment using proper imaging modalities should be performed. Moreover, adequate information on the anatomy will help surgeons achieve superior planning and surgical outcomes while preventing wrong interpretation and misdiagnosis [8,19,24,27].\u00a0\nLimitations:\n1. Unequal gender distribution in different age groups.\n2. The study is con ned to Saudi population, requires analyses on larger geographic & demographic regions.\u00a0\n3. lack of knowledge on the co-occurrence and or association with additional anatomic variant(s) other than orofacial region.\u00a0\nConclusion The presence of anatomic variants generally does not interfere with the function of the mandible and never typically manifests as pathological units and can be an unpleasant surprise for the operating specialist when revealed during a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention. Moreover, under certain circumstances, these variants can worsen existing pathological conditions or even evoke new ones. A sub-optimal anatomical knowledge regarding the existence or possibility of anatomical variants and the ignorance of the same has more often than not been attributed to an increase in medico-legal claims making it believe as malpractice [4, 8]. For such reasons, it gets paramount to consider variant anatomy an unmissable aspect of the body which may potentially defeat a clinician from achieving successful treatment outcomes.\nIt is the obligation of the radiologist evaluating a head and neck scan to carefully peruse the topographic anatomy in search of variants and to document on them [5, 19], speci cally when surgery is under consideration. Pertinent diagnostic and pre-surgical assessment of the region will not only help to assess any anatomical variants present but also in uences the outcome of surgical procedures related to that particular region along with preventing any sort of iatrogenic injuries to these variant structures postoperatively. It is undeniable that diagnostic to a prognostic evaluation of such patients needs to be studied further for a better understanding of the outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the exclusive FN series report. Additional studies with higher investigation modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging are necessary to clearly understand and discuss the contents of FN and we hope this series will be a foundation for future investigations.\nDeclarations Ethical approval and consent to participate:\u00a0Compliance with ethical standards,\u00a0with vide approval number 20-242E.\nPage 8/15\nConsent for publication:\u00a0The authors consent for publication\u00a0\nAvailability of data and materials:\u00a0Not applicable\nCompeting interests:\u00a0None\nFunding & Disclosure of Interest:\nThe authors received no funding or grants for this work from any organization or foundation.
