    "abstractText": "We study static solutions of the standard Skyrme model with a pion mass. Using approximately 105 pseudo-random initial configurations made of single Skyrmions in the non-symmetrized product Ansatz and an automatic detection of repeated solutions, we find 409 local energy minimizers (Skyrmions) of the model with baryon numbers 1 through 16, of which 383 are new. In particular, we find new solutions for baryon numbers 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. Our results for the number of solutions per baryon number suggest that this number could grow either polynomially or exponentially. We identify new families of solutions: sheets of Skyrmions in synchronized and antisynchronized hexagonal layers (which we call graphene); chains of 2and 3-tori; chain-like solutions containing a hinge and many clustered Skyrmions. Contrary to common lore, only the B = 12 global energy minimizer is made of alpha particles or some chunk of a cubic crystal, whereas the B = 9, 11, 14, 15 minimizers contain the B = 7 icosahedrally symmetric Skyrmion as a component. The B = 10, 13, 16 are symmetric graphene-like solutions. We find B = 5 and B = 8 minimizers with numerically indistinguishable energies. The B = 8 candidates are the chain of two cubes, which is a chunk of the cubic Skyrme crystal and the fullerene-type ball found originally by the rational map approximation. The B = 5 global minimizer is either the well-known D2d symmetric fullerene or a new C2v symmetric solution. Finally, our findings show a large number of solutions have no discrete symmetries or just one symmetry, contrary to the common lore that Skyrmions are highly symmetric configurations.",

            "text": "In the 1960s, Tony Skyrme proposed an elegant model of nuclei as solitons in a nonlinear sigma model [1, 2]. The model is consistent with chiral symmetry and contains the (unique) leading second-order term in the chiral Lagrangian as well as a special fourth-order term, now known as the Skyrme term. Nontrivial topology means that field configurations can be labeled by a conserved topological charge B \u2208 Z, which is identified with the baryon number. In the basic theory, each classical energy minimizer (Skyrmion) is identified with a nucleus and a semiclassical quantization allows for comparison with nuclear data. Early studies were made giving qualitative results for the single nucleon matching experimental data at about the 30% level [3], see ref. [4] for a review. To make the connection with nuclear physics, one must first find the classical solution for baryon number B. The mass, radius, moments of inertia and symmetries of the solution are needed to probe the properties of nuclei. Even for the deuteron (B = 2), the problem\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\nis nontrivial. The shape of this solution was settled after some discussion and the result is that two single Skyrmions merge into a torus, yielding a classical solution with axial symmetry [5\u20137]. A multitude of numerical methods were used to determine the Skyrmion solutions with B > 2 [8\u201310], and the solutions for B < 8 were found to be hollow fullerenes. The analytic breakthrough to understand these solutions came from the Rational Map Approximation (RMA). Here, the target 3-sphere of the Skyrme model is decomposed into a radial direction and a rational map describing the angular distribution of the solution [11]. This allowed for a reconstruction of the known numerical minimizers and a detailed study of the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints [12], which tell us how the symmetries restrict the allowed quantum states of the theory. The RMA predicts that these hollow fullerenes are the energy minimizers as B grows. However, these large hollow shells are only the minimizers of the energy functional when the pion mass term is excluded [10, 13]. The solutions drastically change when the pion mass term is included, since the hollow region inside the fullerenes correspond to the anti-vacuum of the pion fields (the antipodal point on the target space 3-sphere) and is penalized by the pion mass term. Since the surface area of the shell grows like r2, whereas the volume of the shell grows like r3, small enough fullerenes are allowed and the expectation is that large fullerene solutions collapse into smaller clusters. It was suggested that these clusters would be alpha particles of B = 4 cubes, which would be a welcome result as it connects the Skyrme model to the well-known alpha-particle model of nuclei. Low energy solutions were found with B = 8, 12, 16 which look like cubes arranged in geometric shapes [14]. The cubes also appear in the infinite crystal solution of the Skyrme model. Hence it seems reasonable that medium to large Skyrmions are composed of B = 4 cubes in a variety of arrangements. Results supporting this lore include [15\u201317]. In contrast to this cluster picture, it has also been found that the hollow fullerenes collapse into flat structures [10]. There are also several proposals for Skyrmions with special baryon numbers which have high symmetry, such as tetrahedral symmetry [18\u201321]. Overall, there are many proposals for the form of large B Skyrmions with nonzero pion mass. The shape and symmetry of the classical solutions is important in the semiclassical expansion generally used to construct nuclear spectra from Skyrmions. In a rigid body quantization, the Skyrmion is allowed to rotate and isorotate and these symmetries lead to spin and isospin quantum numbers. However, the discrete symmetry of the Skyrmion restricts which values of spin and isospin are allowed about each solution, due to the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints [22]. Furthermore, the classical solutions also contain information about the mass and moments of inertia, which feed into the energies of the quantum states. Rigid body quantization relies on several approximations. The wavefunction is a \u03b4-function on configuration space, which approximates a harmonic oscillator focused around that minimizer. For this to be accurate, the classical solution must be isolated from other solutions: either by a potential energy barrier or a large distance in the space. If the energy landscape is relatively flat with many local minima, the approximation breaks down and another quantization method should be used. The spins of excited nuclear states are governed by the classical vibrational modes that the particular Skyrmion possesses [23].\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\nThe small number of vibrational quantizations which have been attempted rely on similar approximations to rigid body quantization: that the configurations which are included in the quantization are separated from other solutions. These approximations all make sense if, for example, there is only one energy minimizing Skyrmion per baryon number. We will soon see that this is only true for small B. In this paper, we search for the classical local (and global) energy minimizing solutions, i.e. the Skyrmions. We use a state-of-the-art arrested Newton flow code implemented in CUDA C and run on an NVIDIA GPU high-performance computing cluster. On average, a solution takes about 3\u20138 minutes to complete and we have run an order of 105 calculations with random initial conditions, described in more detail in the text. In order to sort through the results, we have implemented a code that can recognize repeated solutions and only flag solutions in the \u201cgray zone\u201d for human verification. The \u201cgray zone\u201d comes about due to the existence of soft modes, i.e. paths between two solutions with an extremely small potential barrier. We have found 409 Skyrmions with B = 1\u2212 16 in the Skyrme model with a pion mass, including 383 which are new. This is by far the largest number of Skyrmions ever found. We find that although the cube is very stable and a common sub-cluster in large massive Skyrmions, a slew of other types of solution exist. As well as the cube, large Skyrmions contain arrangements of the B = 7 icosahedron as well as other smaller Skyrmions. We also find new types of solutions which look like graphene layers with holes either synchronized or anti-synchronized; we dub this kind of solution symmetric and out-of-phase graphene with an obvious abuse of terminology. We find the well-known chains of cubes, which are part of the cubic Skyrme crystal. But we also find that chains of B = 7 Skyrmions exist and can have a smaller energy than the chains of cubes; for example, such a chain of 7-Skyrmions is the global minimizer of the energy functional for B = 14. A new finding is a slight variation of the chain of cubes, which we call hinge Skyrmions and are bent chains with a 1-, 3-, 5- or 7- Skyrmion acting as a hinge which allows for the bend. Another interesting phenomenon is that although several configurations are unstable by themselves, they are a viable component in larger Skyrmions. The most common of these is the 3-torus. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review the massive Skyrme model, detail the moment of inertia tensors and translate the results to vector notation (useful for numerical computations), review the energy bound for the model including the pion mass term, define the characteristics used to distinguish solutions and explain how to identify discrete symmetries possessed by the solutions. In section 3, we explain the algorithm to generate pseudo-random initial configurations, the numerical method and the method we use to automatically eliminate already-found solutions. In section 4, we discuss the results and the new types of solutions found in this work, as well as present statistics based on the properties of all 409 solutions. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion and outlook in section 5. Tables containing plots and details of the 409 solutions are presented in appendix A. The solutions are also available online accompanied by animations of each solution rotating at http://bjarke.gudnason.net/smoergaasbord.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7"

(2.4)\nIn this paper we define a Skyrmion to be a solution to the equation of motion (2.3) which is at least a local minimum of the static energy. Static, finite-energy configurations must satisfy U \u223c 12 as |x| \u2192 \u221e, causing a one-point compactification of space. This means that the static Skyrme field is a map from S3 \u2192 S3, allowing for nontrivial topology. Each configuration has a conserved integer topological charge, which is given by\nB = \u2212 124\u03c02 \u222b R3 ijk Tr[LiLjLk] d3x. (2.5)\nThe energy of a Skyrmion with charge B is bound by B and grows approximately linearly with B. The B = 1 Skyrmion has a spherically symmetric energy density. The Skyrme field takes the form\nU = 12 cos f(r) + ix\u0302 \u00b7 \u03c4 sin f(r), (2.6)\nwhere r = |x| and f(r) is the profile function. We can insert this Ansatz into the Lagrangian to find the equation for f(r),\n(r2 + 2 sin2 f)f \u2032\u2032 + 2rf \u2032 + sin 2f ( f \u20322 \u2212 1\u2212 sin 2 f\nr2\n) \u2212 r2m2 sin f = 0. (2.7)\nAlthough pions have a fixed physical mass, the dimensionless value depends on the calibration since m = 2m\u03c0eF\u03c0 . As there are various ways to calibrate the Skyrme model, previous works have used various m, such as m = 0.526 [24], m = 1 [13] and m = 1.125 [25].\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\nAs we are interested in qualitative features of the Skyrmions, we choose m = 1. This also allows us to compare our results with previous studies [13, 14]. Our results, especially the properties of the solutions, would change if m was changed. There are also known solutions with m = 0 which are unstable when m = 1, and vice versa. Hence we expect Skyrmions to appear and disappear as m changes."

Since we only generate a single configuration per numerical computation, we use a CPU code to generate the random initial parameters, but a GPU code to generate the initial data on the lattice. The algorithm we use to generate a random initial configuration is described as follows. We first generate a 3-tuple of random numbers for the position and a 3-tuple of random numbers for the 3 rotational Euler angles of a 1-Skyrmion (rotation in space and in isospace are equivalent for a 1-Skyrmion); from now on we will call this a 6-tuple of moduli of the 1-Skyrmion. Then for each additional 1-Skyrmion (that is for the B \u2212 1 remaining 1-Skyrmions), we generate a new 6-tuple of random numbers. The new 1-Skyrmion is only accepted if the distance between it and one of the previously generated 1-Skyrmions is smaller than a fixed length. This criterion avoids the possibility of having isolated Skyrmions of topological degrees B1 and B2 at different places in space. After having fixed all the moduli randomly for each of the B 1-Skyrmions, we move the center of mass to the origin of space. Finally, we will create the initial configuration using the asymmetric product Ansatz U = U1U2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7UB, which preserves the nonlinear sigma model constraint detU = 1 and\nUi = 12 cos f(ri) + i(Ri(x\u2212 xi)) \u00b7 \u03c4\nri sin f(ri), i = 1, 2, . . . , B, (3.1)\nwith ri = \u221a\n(x\u2212 xi) \u00b7 (x\u2212 xi) the distance from the position xi, Ri a rotation matrix and f(ri) the profile function of the 1-Skyrmion, which is a solution to the equation (2.7).\nThe algorithm in pseudo code is:\nx[0] = genRand3(XMIN,XMAX); alpha[0] = genRand3(0,2*pi); for (i=1:B-1)\nminlen = XMAX; do\nx[i] = genRand3(XMIN,XMAX); for (j=0:i-1) if (vectorlength(x[i]-x[j]) < minlen) minlen = vectorlength(x[i]-x[j]);\nwhile (minlen > MAXSEPARATION); alpha[i] = genRand3(0,2*pi)\nend for com = {0,0,0}; for (i=0:B-1) com += x[i]; com /= B; for (i=0:B-1) x[i] -= com; create1Skyrmion(U,x[0],alpha[0]) for (i=1:B-1) add1SkyrmionByRightMultiplication(U,x[i],alpha[i]);\nWe have defined suitable functions, constants are written in caps and the latter two lines are implemented as GPU code.

We monitor the static potential energy E (2.19), and eliminate the entire kinetic energy by setting \u2202tnA = 0 whenever E increases during a computation. After several iterations the configuration will lie at the bottom of a potential well, and is a local or global energy minimizer. This method is sometimes called the arrested Newton flow [29]. We stop the evolution when \u2211 lattice sites \u22114 A=1 | \u03b4E\u03b4nA |\n2 < th for some threshold th < 0.01.

Once we have found the final energy minimizers, we repeat the calculation on a 3613 lattice with lattice spacing 0.0444, to increase the accuracy of the final energy. We estimate the systematic error by integrating the topological charge density and seeing how close it is to its integer value. This estimate is only reliable because we have tested that the threshold for stopping the computations is good enough that it does not give a significant contribution, except for soft modes where one should bear in mind that the numerical error may be larger than reported in the appendix.\nIt is well known that 1-Skyrmions attract or repel depending on their initial relative orientation. Despite this, we find that the initial Skyrmions generally attract, given enough time. Occasionally, a 1-Skyrmion is repelled by the others. In this case, the 1-Skyrmion moves away from the others and our boundary conditions allow for it to leave the box. At the end of the evolution we calculate the total baryon number B, which can differ from the initial baryon number Bin due to this phenomena. The final solution is considered to be a B-skyrmion."

Every time a new Skyrmion candidate is found, its characteristics are computed and the vector d is calculated for each solution in the database (with the same topological charge). The new candidate solution is rejected if d < dthreshold. Practical tests reveal that a suitable threshold distance in solution space is dthreshold = 0.004. If all d are smaller than dthreshold then the solution is already known; if one or more are larger then it is a new Skyrmion solution.

For B = 8, our code finds two configurations which are too close in energy to distinguish. These are the chain made of two cubes with D4h symmetry and the fullerenetype ball with D6d symmetry. Both solutions are well known and our study confirms that their energies are near degenerate when m = 1. The surprising result is that the B = 5 sector also has two energetically indistinguishable solutions: one is the known solution with D2d symmetry, the other has only C2v symmetry. In one orientation this new Skyrmion looks rather flat, with four holes on top and four on the bottom. The holes are out of phase and it could be interpreted as a deformed version of the previously studied D4dsymmetric 5-Skyrmion [25]. The D2d-symmetric B = 5 has one anomalously low vibrational frequency [23]: perhaps the two solutions are related through this mode. The minimizer for B = 9 is a 7a-Skyrmion with a 2-torus attached to a face. The minimizer for B = 10 is of a type we will denote \u201csymmetric graphene\u201d (see next subsection) and has been previously found by Battye and Sutcliffe [13]. The B = 13 and B = 16 minimizers are similar to that of the B = 10 sector, extended in a natural way. For B = 11, the minimizer is a 7a-Skyrmion with a cube attached in such a way that there is a retained reflection symmetry. The B = 12 minimizer is as expected from previous work: a chain of cubes with the middle cube rotated by 90 degrees around the axis joining them. The minimizer for B = 14 is made of two 7a-Skyrmions. The minimizer for B = 15 is the 7a-Skyrmion attached to the end of the 8a-Skyrmion. These minimizers show that the icosahedral B = 7 Skyrmion plays an important role as a cluster in low energy configurations, as well as the cubic B = 4 Skyrmion. There are many \u03b1-cluster models of nuclear physics but no 7Li-cluster models. This may be because of the fermionic nature of Lithium-7: it must have a quantum spin contribution, meaning that it is more difficult to use as a building block than the spinless \u03b1-particle. Classically, there is no such restriction."

            "text": "Although we have found many new Skyrmions, they can mostly be sorted into a small number of different families of solutions. In this section we will explore these families, with examples. For small B, the Skyrmions form symmetric polyhedra. Most of the small-B solutions (B < 8) are known, although we have found a new B = 5 solution with C2v symmetry. Many large-B Skyrmions look like loosely bound clusters of these lower-charge building blocks. All small B Skyrmions appear frequently as clusters in large Skyrmions. We can see this by looking at the charge 12 sector. The 12q-, 12t-, 12ab- and 12aa-Skyrmions look like two weakly bound 6a-Skyrmions; the 12f -Skyrmion like a 7 + 5 cluster; the 12z-Skyrmion like a 8 + 4 cluster; the 12h-, 12u and 12i-Skyrmions like a 4 + 4 + 4 cluster and the 12w-Skyrmion like a 3 + 4 + 5 cluster. Some of these solutions are shown in figure 3. Often the Skyrmions are attached symmetrically, so that some of their shared symmetry group remains intact. Many solutions are finite slices of an infinite (or large) solution. The most studied infinite solution is the chain [30]. There are several ways to interpret this: as a chain of\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\n4a 6a 8a 10c 12a 14b 16f\nFigure 4.

Hinge Skyrmions.\ncubic 4a-Skyrmions with alternating orientations or as toroidal 2-Skyrmions stacked on their axis of continuous symmetry. The 4a-, 6a-, 8a-, 10c-, 12a-, 14b- and 16f -Skyrmions, seen in figure 4, can be thought of as slices from this chain. These solutions all have low energy and are the global minimizers for B = 4, 6 and 12. The energy of the 8-chain is degenerate with the D6d symmetric 8b-Skyrmion. For B > 12, other solutions have lower energy meaning that the chains become local, rather than global, minimizers.\nThe infinite chain can bend: a Skyrmion can be inserted between two cubes, acting as a hinge. Different hinges give different angles between the incoming and outgoing Skyrmions. We have found bent chains with hinges given by the 1a-, 3a-, 4a-, 5a- and 7a-Skyrmions, which can be seen in figure 5. These are the 9e-, 11i-, 12i-, 13n-, and 15z-Skyrmions. Using these hinges, one could construct a long Skyrmion with complex geometry. A simple starting point would be a ring solution. Each hinge-type will generate an optimal ring with a different size and baryon number.\nA new type of chain appears, and has low energy, for B \u2265 11. This is constructed from a combination of 2-tori and 3-tori stacked next to one another. The dodecahedral 7a-Skyrmion can also be interpreted as a 2+3+2 stack and configurations which repeat this pattern have low energy. At B = 12 the competing cubic chain and 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 chain have very similar energies; while at B = 14 the cubic chain 14b-Skyrmion has higher energy than the new 14a-Skyrmion, which takes the form of a 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 stack (or can be interpreted as two 7a-Skyrmions). This suggests that the infinite 2 + 3 chain will have lower energy than the cubic chain, which is interesting since the 3-torus is by itself unstable. The 11m-, 12c-, 13v-, 15a- and 16b-Skyrmions are displayed in figure 6. These chains are always capped by 2-tori, suggesting that capping with a 3-torus is energetically unfavorable.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\nThere is a particularly nice infinite series of Skyrmions with baryon number 7 + 5N , which look like alternating 2- and 3-tori capped by 2-tori. The 7a- and 12i-Skyrmions take this form. The next in the series is at B = 17, beyond the scope of this paper.\nThere is a well-known infinite flat lattice solution [31]. Its energy is concentrated on a plane, focused on the edges of tessellated hexagons with holes in the hexagon centers. We call this solution graphene, due to its likeness with this structure. Many large-B Skyrmions look like two finite layers of graphene stacked atop one another. Some examples are shown in figure 7. The stacking can be done with the layers in phase, as is seen for the top two rows of the figure, or out of phase so that the holes of one layer match the vertices of the next layer, as is seen in the bottom row. We call these two options symmetric and out-of-phase graphene, respectively. For some configurations the two layers of graphene are not, or cannot, be stacked symmetrically. These solutions often have no symmetry at all. The energy of the graphene depends on the edge of the solution. The configurations in the top row of figure 7 seem to have a thicker edge than those in the middle row. The edge of the graphene depends on how the finite slice has been cut from the infinite solution. We posit that the thick edge appears when the cut is made through the matter between two holes. If a cut is made through a hole, single Skyrmions can appear. This can be seen in the 14bc-Skyrmion: at the top of this solution, two cuts have taken place through two holes, leaving a single Skyrmion jutting out. The next cuts are through the matter between holes; leaving a smoother edge. The top row configurations are all global minimizers for that baryon number, suggesting that configurations with a thick edge will generically have lower energy. They also appear to be the first three configurations in an infinite sequence with baryon number 10 + 3N . There are many more examples of symmetric, out-of-phase and asymmetric graphene in the table of Skyrmions (see appendix A).\nAlthough the one-layer graphene solution has been studied in detail, our finite B solutions suggest that this structure rarely appears by itself in Skyrmions. In contrast, the two-layer solution appears regularly. Hence, it seems worthwhile to do a study of infinite multilayered graphene. An initial study was done for m = 0 in ref. [32]. It is also worth noting that even small solutions can be interpreted as graphene. The cubic 4-Skyrmion is a tightly folded slice of graphene with 6 holes. One could think of the graphene as an infinite piece of paper, and could construct many Skyrmions by cutting out nets and folding them together into solutions.\nThe hexagonal lattice has been known for a long time. Battye and Sutcliffe noted that the solution looks like an infinite array of trivalent vertices. Using this observation they proposed the GEM rules [9] for Skyrmion energetics, which state that low energy Skyrmions will have an energy density consisting of these trivalent vertices. The global minimizers,\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\n10a 13a 16a\n12v 14bc 16br\n12d 14c 15g\nFigure 7. Graphene Skyrmions.\n5b 9b 16ax 15as\nFigure 8. Layered Skyrmions with tetravalent vertices.\nwhich include some configurations from figure 6 and some from the top row of figure 7, all obey this rule. However, we have also found solutions with tetravalent vertices. This is first seen for the new 5b-Skyrmion, and the structure can be seen in other solutions such as the 9b-, 15as- and 16ax Skyrmions. These solutions can be seen in figure 8. Apart from the 5b-Skyrmion, these solutions all have relatively high energy, agreeing with the GEM rule energetics.\nHigh-symmetry solutions have always motivated studies of classical and quantized Skyrmions. We do not find many new high-symmetry solutions. Some examples are the D5d 12b- and 14a-Skyrmions, the D2h 15cf -Skyrmion and the C3v 16dk-Skyrmion. The last is one of many solutions with at least C3 symmetry. Some more are displayed in figure 9. Here we see that C3 symmetry can appear in Skyrmions which look like graphene, cubes sharing a single Skyrmion, a flat arrangement containing tori or simply cubes. No single type of solution has a monopoly on any one symmetry group.\nOccasionally the presence of one Skyrmion can stabilize another, previously unstable configuration. An example of this is the untwisted B = 8 solution. This is a well-known saddle point of the Skyrme model, and it looks like two cubes next to each other in the same orientation. A small mode analysis shows that the solution is unstable to one of the cubes twisting on the axis joining the pair [23]. However, the 9e-Skyrmion looks like two cubes in the same orientation, but fused by a 1a-Skyrmion. The 1a-Skyrmion somehow\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\n9e 11l 12s\nFigure 10. Solutions whose constituent clusters aren\u2019t solutions themselves.\nstabilizes the previously unstable configuration. Another example is the 11l-Skyrmion, which looks like a slice of out-of-phase graphene with a 1a-Skyrmion attached. There is no 10-Skyrmion which looks like out-of-phase graphene, meaning that the 1-Skyrmion has stabilized the configuration. This out-of-phase structure with baryon number 10 is also seen in the 14h, 15bd, 16aj and 16z solutions. Finally, the 12s-Skyrmion looks like a(n unstable) D6h 8-Skyrmion attached to another cluster. These examples can be seen in figure 10. We have so far focused on special solutions of the Skyrme model. However, most other solutions can be understood as some combination or deformation of those we\u2019ve discussed. For instance: the 12l-, 13k-, 14r- and 16m-Skyrmions are all almost-symmetric graphene; the 12e-, 14bb-, 15bd- and 16bw-Skyrmions look like small-B Skyrmions attached to graphene; the 12k-, 14t-, 15av- and 16bl-Skyrmions are deformed graphene with no symmetry and the 11o-, 12y-, 14bg- and 15bh-Skyrmions are deformed chains. This is only a small collection of examples. Using a combination of small solutions, graphene, chains and hinges we can describe almost all of the 409 Skyrmions found. There can also be many different versions of the same combination. For instance the 16cb-, 16cc-, 16ch-, 16ce-, 16cj-Skyrmions all look like a 6a-Skyrmion attached to symmetric graphene and have near-degenerate energy. However, they all look different as there are many ways to combine the two objects. It is worth noting that many solutions belong to several of these categories and can be interpreted in different ways. For instance the 12q-Skyrmion looks like two 6a-Skyrmions attached symmetrically and like a slice of symmetric graphene. This is equally true of small Skyrmions: the cubic 4a-Skyrmion looks like two 2-tori, the dodecahedral 7a-Skyrmion like a 3-torus sandwiched between two 2-tori and so on. Our descriptions in this section and in appendix A are suggestions of how to interpret the solutions. Depending on the application, certain interpretations may be more or less appropriate."

Alternatively, they can be thought of as a path between two or more solutions in configuration space with an extremely shallow potential barrier. A good example of this is the 12f -Skyrmion, which contains a soft mode as it takes very little energy to rotate the 5a-Skyrmion relative to the 7a-Skyrmion. Another example in the same topological sector are the 12aa- and 12ab-Skyrmions, for which the relative rotation of the 6a-Skyrmion is a very low-energy mode. There are many examples with high energies, to just mention a few, the 13g-, 14w-, 14ah-, 14ay-, 14bi-, 15p-, 14r-, 15q-, 15t-, 15bo-, 15bu-, 16aq-, 16bn-Skyrmions contain soft modes.

            "text": "Our results provide the most comprehensive search for solutions of the Skyrme model to date. As such, we will now compare our results to past studies, predictions and approximations.\nThe Rational Map Approximation (RMA) describes Skyrmions as shell-like configurations, which contain a center filled with antivacuum (U = \u221212). As the pion mass m increases so does the energy cost of this center. As such, we expect that predictions from the RMA do not compare well to the results here, where m = 1. The RMA successfully describes the fullerene solutions for B = 1-8 [11]. For B = 9-16, Battye and Sutcliffe calculated the optimal RMA Skyrmions, and relaxed them numerically [33, 34]. Of these, we only find the C4d symmetric 9b-Skyrmion and the D3h 11h-Skyrmion. There is also a higher-energy tetrahedral 9f -Skyrmion. None are the global energy minimizers. The other RMA configurations are not seen and may be saddle points of the theory. We also do not see any of the proposed Skyrmions from the double RMA [35], such as the tetrahedral B = 12 and cubic B = 13 configurations.\nIn ref. [13], the authors used squashed RMA Skyrmions as initial conditions to find solutions of the Skyrme model with m = 1. They found flat solutions for B = 10-16 which we would call graphene. We find all these configurations. The 10a-Skyrmion is the global minimizer while the 11c, 12d, 13k, 14c, 15c and 16c are the third, fourth, eleventh, third, third and third lowest energy solutions in their respective baryon sectors.\nIn the \u03b1-particle model, B = 4N Skyrmions are constructed from N B = 4 cubes [14]. In refs. [15\u201317] the authors construct highly symmetric \u03b1-clusters for B = 12 and 16. We do reproduce the 12a chain, the 12h triangle, the 16f chain and the 16g bent square. However, we find no tetrahedral B = 16 solutions, despite there being many ways to construct such a state. The closest configuration to this is the 16dk-Skyrmion which is a flattened tetrahedron with C3v symmetry. The fact that we do not find a B = 16 tetrahedron does not mean it is not an important configuration: it could be a low energy saddle point.\nFinally, we do not find any of the previously discovered saddle points of the Skyrme model. These include the B = 2 hedgehog, B = 5 Oh-symmetric solution, B = 8 untwisted chain and B = 16 flat square. That we do not find these is a reassuring check on our numerical scheme, which is designed to only find minimizers.\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\nn u m\nb e r\no f\ns o lu\nti o n s\nB\n0.12e 0.44B 4.39\u00d710 \u22126B6.24\n5.08\u0393(0.32B)\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n(a)\nr\nB\n0.687B0.50\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n(b)\nFigure 11.

            "text": "Having obtained 409 solutions of the Skyrme model, it is sensible to calculate some macro properties of the set of solutions. First, we consider how many solutions there are for a given baryon number B, presented in figure 11(a). With the data we have at this point, it is difficult to determine the type of growth, but at least polynomial growth seems likely. Note that the polynomial growth suggests that there would be \u223c 40, 000 solutions at B = 40. Hence finding all energy minimizers for important nuclei such as Calcium-40 would be prohibitively difficult. We have also shown the average and median of the radii as well as the spread of the radii for each B in figure 11(b). A fit shows that the mean radius of the Skyrmions is roughly proportional to \u221a B. Curiously, this is midway between the behavior of normal materials (R \u223cM1/3) and BPS monopoles or black holes (R \u223cM) [36], where we have used that B \u223cM with M being the (baryon) mass.\nWe plot the normalized energies (normalized by the energy bound) per baryon number (see eq. (2.40)) in figure 12. This shows that the smallest generally decreases as B increases, as expected. One exception is the minimizing 14a-Skyrmion which has very low energy and a large energy gap. This naively matches the exceptionally low binding energy of Nitrogen-14. We also see several anomalously high energy solutions, for B = 10, 11, 13. If such solutions exist for these baryon numbers, they might also exist for other B. This suggests that there could be solutions that our method has missed. We do not claim to have found all Skyrmions. Note, the energies plotted in figure 12 are all classically stable solutions; that is, no saddle points are included in our data.\nThe random initial conditions lead to a large number of solutions, many of which are identical. Although our algorithm eliminates repeated Skyrmions, we keep every log file and have tracked how many times the same solution has been found. This tells us the frequency of a solution, which might indicate the size of the basin of attraction of the solution. The result is shown in figure 13.

Equally, there are plenty of high energy solutions which are quite common. These results may be showing the bias of our initial configuration generator. For instance long chains are very rare, and it is also very rare for a random initial configuration to take this shape. There are many solutions for B \u2265 11 that we only find once. If we have found several solutions which are very rare, it is logical to assume that there are even more still undiscovered.

Number of solutions possessing certain symmetries.\nIn figure 14, we plot the number of solutions with a given symmetry. The colors (globally defined in this section) represent the solution of a given baryon number B. We see that the most common symmetry groups are the empty set and C1h (one reflection). The next most common is C2v (two reflections). Hence a slim majority of Skyrmions do have a reflection symmetry. The fact that so many solutions have no symmetry goes against the common lore that Skyrmions have high symmetry. Many of these asymmetric solutions contain sub-clusters which do have approximate symmetry. Perhaps these symmetries should be taken into account in a full quantization. We note that in the \u03b1-particle model of nuclear physics, the individual sub-clusters are quantized first and then interactions and dynamics are considered.\nIn figure 15, we plot the sphericity \u2206s versus the normalized energy , defined as\n\u2206s = \u221a \u220621 + \u220622, (4.1)\nwith \u22061 =\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb2 + \u03bb1 , \u22062 = \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 + \u03bb2 , (4.2)\nwhere 0 < \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bb3 are the three eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor V , see eq. (2.23), with the eigenvalues VD found in eq. (2.43) related as VD = diag(\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3). Spherical symmetry implies \u22061 = \u22062 = 0, an oblate solution has \u22062 = 0 and \u22061 > 0, whereas a prolate solution has \u22061 = 0 and \u22062 > 0. We see that the only low-energy spherical Skyrmions are the small-B fullerenes. There are some high energy Skyrmions which are spherical, such as the 9f - and 10h-Skyrmions, but the small energy solutions are not. Finally, we show the relationship between sphericity, oblacity, prolacity and normalized energy ( ) in figure 16.

            "text": "In this paper, we have used large scale numerical computations on a GPU cluster to find 409 Skyrmion solutions, of which 383 are new. We find new families of Skyrmion such as different types of graphene-like solutions, new chains and previously unstable sub-clusters stabilized by adding some small Skyrmion. We used a state-of-the-art arrested Newton flow algorithm implemented in CUDA C and run on an NVIDIA GPU high-performance computing cluster. The usage of GPU code, as opposed to traditional CPU code, was crucial in order for us to be able to perform this large scale numerical computation and finish within half a year. For comparison, we tested a C++ implementation, i.e. CPU code, of the same algorithm and estimate that the computation with our current computing resources (a single Intel Xeon CPU node with 24 cores) would have taken 45 years to complete.1 We found that the new chains made from 2- and 3- tori sometimes had lower energy than the usual cubic chains. Does this hold more generally? The question can be answered for large B by looking at the infinite chains. Similarly the 10a-, 13a- and 16a-Skyrmions are finite versions of an infinite slab and could be studied in this limit. Other graphene solutions are also cut from the infinite two-layer hexagonal lattice. Hence their properties may be deduced from a careful study of the Skyrmion lattice. There may even be a way to generate certain shapes from the lattice in a (semi-)analytic way.\n1To be fair, we have used highly advanced memory and optimization techniques to make the CUDA C code very efficient, but we not made the same efforts for the C++ code.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 7\nFor rigid body quantization to be a good approximation, the quantized Skyrmion should be isolated in configuration space. The wavefunction is concentrated around a single Skyrmion, not overlapping with any other solutions. This should work well for B < 8, where there are few solutions. Indeed, with an appropriate calibration of the Skyrme model, rigid body quantization does give reasonably accurate nuclear spectra, albeit only for even baryon numbers [25]. For odd B, additional ingredients in the quantization become necessary in order to produce realistic spectra. There are extra modes that must be quantized, in the spirit of the semi-classical expansion as a low-energy effective field theory, as light modes \u2014 vibrational modes [23] \u2014 and turn out to be crucial for the nuclear spectrum of e.g. Lithium-7 [37]. Again, relying on these light modes only works on the assumption that the Skyrmion is isolated in configuration space. An obvious laborious task for future work would be to calculate the vibrational spectra of all the newly found Skyrmion solutions and furthermore use this information to construct nuclear spectra. The sheer number of classical solutions show that the Skyrmion landscape is incredibly complicated \u2014 and the minima are only the starting point. Morse theory guarantees that any two minima have a saddle point between them. So the landscape is likely rather flat, with many low energy paths between the many low energy solutions. This picture is in stark contrast to the assumptions of rigid body quantization. Our results suggest that a new paradigm for Skyrmion quantization is required: one where we take the enormous family of low energy configurations seriously. How this is done in a computationally efficient way is unknown. Perhaps our results can be used as direct input in some new method. Another option is to use ADHM data to produce large families of Skyrme configurations [38]. Further future avenues of research include altering the Skyrme model to yield smaller classical binding energies, see e.g. [29, 39\u201346], and recalculating all the classical solutions in such cases. We expect that there will be many more solutions in a weakly bound Skyrme model with realistic binding energies [43], which would further limit the practical usefulness of the semi-classical quantization. Our method to generate configurations is simple: we generate B random 1-Skyrmions and place them near one another. This naive method has produced the largest number of Skyrmions ever found. Perhaps the method could be implemented in other soliton systems to find new solutions. We hope that our work will serve as motivation for the invention of new methods to analytically describe classical Skyrmions and provoke a complete rethink of Skyrmion quantization."
