    "abstractText": "Improving the existent effective treatments of depression is a promising way to optimise the effects of psychological treatments. Here we examine the effects of adding a rehabilitation type of imagery based on exergames and dynamic simulations to a short behavioural activation treatment of depression. We investigate the acceptability and the efficacy of an exergame-augmented dynamic imagery intervention added to behavioural activation treatment and associated mechanisms of change.",

            "text": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental health problem that results in severe impairment of the life of affected individuals [1]. Although there are several effective treatments of depression, their efficacy was challenged, only a moderate-small effect being evidenced after removing the existing research biases [2]. Estimates suggest that 59% of depressed patients do not even respond to psychological treatments (50% reduction in symptoms) and two thirds do not remit [2]. To this shortcoming it adds the high rates of relapse, recurrence, residual symptoms, and the fact that many affected individuals receive no treatment. It is estimated that after treatment, 30 to 50% of recovered patients are still troubled by residual symptoms and up to 75% of patients relapse [3]. Improving the treatment for depression has a major impact on global mental health and economy.\nFinding efficient ways to treat depression has always been a preoccupation for both\nresearchers and clinicians. Despite significant efforts, the efficacy of treatments for depression did not significantly improve in time [4]. Targeting new mechanisms and optimising the already effective interventions are promising solutions to advance the treatment of depression [5].\nMental rehearsal interventions are considered promising stand-alone or added-on treat-\nments for depression [5\u20139]. Recently, the effect of imagery has been tested by adding imagery to behavioural activation treatment for depression. Behavioural activation treatment is one of the most effective and robust psychological treatments for depression [10, 11]. Although adding imagery interventions to behavioural activation brings great promise for improving the treatment of depression, there are several potential improvements for imagery interventions. Renner et al. [9] have recently pointed out the limitations of mental imagery interventions in depression: only individuals who vividly imagine actions benefit from intervention; depressed individuals have difficulties vividly simulating actions, not knowing the ingredients of a prospective mental rehearsal of actions.\nWe suggest that a major source of potential improvements for mental imagery interven-\ntions comes from paying more attention to the contribution of the ongoing states of the sensorimotor and affective brain systems (motor, affective, and visual) to mental simulations. Considering the characteristics of the sensorimotor and affective brain systems involved in the mental construction of those experiences results in several advantages for imagery interventions. First, the differences in the states of the sensorial, affective, and motor systems recruited for simulation should be considered during imagery interventions for depressed individuals. For instance, depressed individuals show large differences in the state of modality-specific brain systems, having attenuated excitation of the motor cortex [12, 13] and deficient recruitment of brain systems involved in positive affect [14], which may influence the effect of the interventions. Second, considering how particular imagery modalities (e.g., visual versus motor) are used during the imagery process in depressed individuals may show a significant advantage. Differences in using some modalities over others may result in differences in the effect of imagery over behaviour [15]. For instance, the recruitment of the motor brain in imagery and the effect of mental imagery on action largely depend on the success of using kinesthetic rather than visual imagery [16]. Depressed individuals have more impaired motor imagery than visual imagery and compensate for this deficit by using modalities, which may limit the impact of imagery interventions [17]. Third, adopting an understanding of the mental simulation of feelings as mental re-activation of body sensations in imagery intervention may also bring a significant advantage for intervention. Recent research showed that felt sensations in the body are core components of feelings [18, 19], they can be maintained as representations in working memory [20], they are attenuated in depressed individuals [21], and that\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288910 July 31, 2023 2 / 14\ndecision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nprospective simulations of sensations felt in the body during feelings in positive situations are attenuated in individuals with high levels of depressive symptomatology [22].\nHere we propose that we may use these advantages and significantly improve imagery inter-\nventions by focusing on enhancing the embodiment of mental rehearsal in imagery-based treatments for depressed individuals. A large body of research suggests that the effect of mental simulations on emotion and behaviour heavily depends on their embodiments, or the efficient recruitment of specific sensorimotor and affective modalities in mental simulations by attention, verbal, and memory controls [23]. For instance, when simulating and paying attention to visual details rather than proprioceptive sensations, one will recruit the visual cortex for action simulation rather than the interoceptive and motor cortex, and vice versa [24]. Mental rehearsal of action is efficient for action and affective control when it adequately recruits motor and affective simulations [25]. Depressed individuals have difficulties recruiting motor and affective brain areas in their thinking. Thus, to optimise imagery treatment for depressed individuals, one should enhance the recruitment of modal (motor and affective) brain systems in the mental simulation process. When deficiencies of the modal brain areas required for imagery simulations are stable alterations (i.e., cognitive deficits of cognition), the intervention should follow a rehabilitation approach similar to motor rehabilitation imagery used in patients with brain damage (e.g., damages due to stroke). We focus on two potential solutions for improving imagery based on embodied processes: exergames and dynamic imagery.\nA promising way to support the embodiment of simulations of action in depressed individ-\nuals is by using remote kinematics in the form of exergaming (XboxKinect\u2122 games). Previous research showed that using exergaming results in the augmentation of motor (kinesthetic) imagery [26\u201328], increased motor rehabilitation in stroke patients [29], motor learning [30] and it is efficient as a stand-alone intervention for the reduction of depressive symptomatology [31\u201334]. Furthermore, exergaming has an increased acceptability and feasibility in various populations [29]. Based on these results, using exergaming as a tool for motor rehabilitation of action cognition in imagery interventions for depressed individuals seems to be worth investigating.\nAnother promising solution came from dynamic imagery. Dynamic imagery, as opposed to\nstatic imagery (mental rehearsal of movement without overt movement) requires mimicry of simulated movements [35]. Previous research has shown a dynamic superiority effect, individuals remembering better moving rather than static stimuli [36]. Similarly, a dynamic superiority effect has been evidenced for imagery. In comparison with static imagery, dynamic imagery results in higher vividness of mental imagery [37] motor learning [35] and behavioural performance [38]. Moreover, the imagery deficits which are evidenced in static motor imagery tasks are not evident when a dynamic strategy of motor imagery is applied for the same population [39].\nGiven that imagery methods added to behavioural activation treatments are promising for the treatment of depression [6, 9] and that dynamic imagery and stimulation by remote kinematic may help overcome limitations of existing imagery interventions, we intend to test the effect of adding a dynamic imagery intervention augmented by exergames to a short behavioural activation treatment [40].\nStarting from the idea that action cognition and motor imagery deficits are stable alter-\nations in depressed individuals [41\u201343] we use a rehabilitation type of motor imagery intervention based on principles of rehabilitation of motor imagery for individuals with neurological conditions. To this end, we integrate forward modelling of action and motor imagery [44], remote kinematics (Kinect) and embodied cognition account (action support of mental simulations, [25, 45]. This intervention is a new one that proved efficient in clinical work (Tiba, [Unpublished protocol]), [46]. There are several steps in the intervention. In the first session,\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288910 July 31, 2023 3 / 14\nthe therapists introduce the dynamic simulation routine: how to support mental imagery of activities through gestures, language, and attention. Then, the patients undergo an exergame for 5 to 10 minutes and an \u201cactfulness\u201d exercise focusing on feelings of movement and motor simulation. After the exercise, the participants dynamically imagine a planned activity. In session two, patients are thought to restructure action memories by focusing on movements. Deficient action simulations are rehabilitated by (a) partial movements (they alternate covert with dynamic-partial movements simulations in response to stimuli); (b) linguistic supports (training in gerundival perceptions that is to recognize and name stimuli by actions; for instance, a door is recognized as a door to open; [47]), (c) enhanced perceptual and affective simulations (PETTLEP system, [48]), and (d) episodic memory support (they have to form future memories of action cores-last sequence of movement before perception of desired environmental change, correct them by experience, and remember at the end of the day). Thus, it is a rehearsal training that mixes actual and mental practice [49, 50] with augmentation of the motor component of simulations in thinking by enhancing gestures, language, and episodic memory as controls of simulation, and is applied to promote the use of motor simulations in everyday life.\nWe expect that adding a dynamic imagery intervention will augment the effects of beha-\nvioural activation treatment (BA) on severity of depressive symptoms. Second, we investigate whether adding the dynamic imagery intervention to behavioural activation treatment has any effect on secondary outcomes such as anhedonia, apathy, and vividness of imagery. Third, we investigate the moderators and mediators of the effects of the intervention."

            "text": "Primary outcome. Depressive symptom severity is assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [54]. BDI-II comprises 21 items assessing the DSM symptoms of the major depression episode during the past 2 weeks. Each question is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher depression. The BDI-II manual states that scores between 0 and 13 indicate minimal depression, 14 to 19 indicate mild depression, 20 to 28 indicate moderate depression, and 29 to 63 indicate severe depression [55]. Psychometric strengths such as validity and reliability were supported by numerous studies across many populations and cultural backgrounds [54, 56].\nSecondary outcomes. Depressive symptoms severity is assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 [57]. PHQ-9 scale contains nine items that measure the severity of nine depressive symptoms on a 4-point scale during the past two weeks. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).\nDepression remission is measured using The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinician Version [SCID-5-CV; 58], affective module at post measurement and follow-up. SCID-5 is a structured clinical interview used to determine the core diagnoses according to DSM-5 guidelines. Participants are considered remitted when they no longer fulfil diagnostic criteria for a major depression episode.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288910 July 31, 2023 6 / 14\nDepression response is assessed based on BDI II scores. To identify responders to treatment we compute the reliable change index. A reliable change index of more than 1.96 will classify a participant as a responder [59].\nAnhedonia severity is assessed with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale [60] SHAPS is a 14-item scale assessing the degree to which a person is able to experience pleasure or the anticipation of a pleasurable experience. Participants respond on a four points scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Each \"disagree\" response receives one point, whereas each \"agree\" response receives zero points. Thus, the final score ranges from 0 to 14.\nApathy level is assessed with the Apathy-Motivation Index [61]. AMI is a 18-item questionnaire used to identify three dimensions of apathy: Behavioural Activation (propensity to initiate goal-directed behaviour), Social Motivation (level of engagement in social interactions), and Emotional Sensitivity (feelings of positive and negative affection). Higher scores indicate greater apathy. Item scores are averaged to get scores for subscales and a total score (range 0\u20134) [61].\nAnxiety severity is assessed with the Generalised Anxiety Scale 7 [GAD-7; 62]. GAD-7 is a self-report scale measuring the severity of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) during the past 2 weeks. It contains seven items related to DSM criteria for anxiety. Participants respond on a 4-point scale. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).\nHealth and disability level outcome is assessed with The World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) 12 \u2013Self-Report Version WHODAS 12), [63]. WHODAS 12 is a practical, general assessment instrument. It has 6 subscale, each subscale containing two questions from the corresponding subscale in the full version: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities and participation. The response options for each item ranged from 0 (none), to 4 (extreme/cannot do). The individual scores in each subscale are calculated by adding the two item scores. The total score ranges from 0\u201348.\nAdverse and unwanted effects of the experimental intervention are assessed using the Negative Effects Questionnaire [64]. NEQ is a 20-item scale used to assess the adverse and unwanted effects of psychological treatments. Participants respond on a 5-point Likert-scale about the presence of adverse events during treatment such as symptoms (e.g., stress, shame, anxiety), quality (e.g., confidence regarding treatment and therapy), dependency (e.g., addiction to treatment medicine or therapy), stigma (e.g., feeling ashamed in front of other people), hopelessness, and failure (e.g., when thinking that things could get better) [65].\nThe vividness of motor imagery is assessed using the Vividness of Motor Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2) [66]. The vividness of imagining twelve movements is measured using a Likert scale from 1 (perfectly clear and vivid as you would normally picture the image) to 5 (no image or sensation at all, you are only aware you are \u201cthinking\u201d of the movement). The VMIQ-2 version was found to be as a psychometrically valid questionnaire) [66, 67].\nThe level of rewards is assessed with \u201cThe environmental and reward observation scale\u201d (EROS); [68]. EROS consists of 10 items (e.g., \u201cIt is easy for me to find enjoyment in my life\u201d), where responses are given on a Likert-type scale ranging from \u201ccompletely disagree\u201d to \u201cabsolutely agree\u201d, on a 4-point scale. A higher score indicates a larger experience of reinforcing events from the environment.\nThe level of rumination is assessed with the Ruminative Response Scale-SV [69]. Participants respond on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u201calmost never\u201d) to 4 (\u201calmost always\u201d). The scale describes different components of the rumination response to depressed mood such as self-focused rumination (e.g., \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about some things\u201d), symptom focused rumination (e.g., \u201cI have never been able to distract myself from unwanted thoughts\u201d) or rumination focused on the possible consequences and causes of the mood (e.g., \"When I have a\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288910 July 31, 2023 7 / 14\nproblem it will gnaw in my mind for a long time\"). Brooding involves self-criticism, whereas reflection is related to more active problem solving.\nActivation and avoidance is assessed using the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale\u2014 Short Form (BADS-SF) [70]. BADS-SF is a 9-item scale used to assess the activation over the past week. It is organised in activation and avoidance subscales. BADS-SF is used to track when and how participants were activated during BA treatment.\nWorking memory is assessed with a Backward digit span task. Participants are given a series of digits and asked to repeat them backward. The score is based on how many numbers participants are able to repeat. A higher score indicates better working memory. Pairs of the sequences are read aloud to participants. The subsequent set of sequences will be one digit longer if both are successfully repeated and one digit shorter if none of the pair\u2019s sequences is correctly repeated. The following pair of sequences will have the same length if one of the pair\u2019s sequences is incorrectly repeated while the other sequence is correctly repeated [71].\nExecutive functioning is assessed with the verbal fluency test. In the verbal fluency test, participants are asked to say as many words as possible with a given letter (consonant F, A or S) for 1 minute.\nVerb fluency. In the verb fluency task, participants are asked to produce as many verbs as possible for one minute. The participant\u2019s score in each task is the number of total correct words.\nAcceptability ratings. Acceptability is measured as satisfaction with the intervention, intention to continue and the intention to recommend the intervention assessed on a 5-points Likert scale. Drop-out rates are analysed as well.\nAffect and behaviour monitoring scale. Changes in functioning, emotions, behaviour profile, efficacy, and difficulty of simulation are assessed. For each item, the score ranges from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much)."
