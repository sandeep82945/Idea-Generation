1. **Investigate the role of ATP in phage head-host cell binding and ride-hitching:** 
Explore the molecular mechanisms by which ATP promotes phage head-host cell binding and subsequent ride-hitching. Determine the specific proteins or cellular factors involved in this process and investigate how ATP levels influence the efficiency of phage propagation.


2. **Characterize the structural and functional properties of the partially decondensed phage genomes:** 
Study the unique structural features of the partially decondensed phage genomes and their implications for DNA packaging and release. Investigate the role of these structural features in the assembly and infectivity of phage particles. Additionally, explore the potential applications of these partially decondensed genomes in genetic engineering and biotechnology.


3. **Investigate the low assembly assistance for gp6 and its implications for phage assembly:** 
Examine the molecular basis for the low assembly assistance requirement of gp6 during phage head assembly. Determine the structural and functional properties of gp6 and its interactions with other assembly proteins. Investigate the potential role of scaffolding proteins or alternative assembly mechanisms in the assembly of phage 0105phi7-2.


4. **Explore the relationship between phage surface charge and blood persistence:** 
Conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the correlation between the relatively low component of negative surface charges on phage 0105phi7-2 and its low persistence in murine blood. Determine the specific surface properties that contribute to phage persistence and explore the potential of manipulating these properties to improve phage therapeutic efficacy.


5. **Investigate the prevalence and diversity of phages with similar properties to phage 0105phi7-2:** 
Conduct a systematic screening of environmental samples to identify additional phages that exhibit similar properties to phage 0105phi7-2, such as large plaque size, ride-hitching behavior, and low blood persistence. Characterize these phages in terms of their genomic, structural, and functional properties to gain insights into the diversity and evolution of phages with these unique characteristics.
