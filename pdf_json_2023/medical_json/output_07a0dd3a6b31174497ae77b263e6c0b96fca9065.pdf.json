    "abstractText": "Background Growing evidence supports an association between physical activity (PA) and the risk of osteoarthritis (OA), but this may be influenced by confounding and reverse causality. Therefore, we performed a two\u2010sample Men\u2010 delian randomization (MR) analysis to reveal the causal relationship between PA and OA. Methods MR was performed to explore the causation of PA and OA with genetic variants as instrumental vari\u2010 ables. The genetic variants were derived from the summary statistics of a large genome\u2010wide association study meta\u2010analysis based on the European population (n = 661,399), including self\u2010reported leisure screen time (LST) and moderate\u2010to\u2010vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and Arthritis Research UK Osteoarthritis Genetics Consortium cohorts (417,596, 393,873 and 403,124 for overall, hip and knee OA, respectively). The major MR analysis used in this work was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, and sensitivity, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity studies were performed to evaluate the validity of the findings. Results IVW estimates indicated that LST had a risk effect on overall OA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.309, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.198\u20131.430, P = 2.330 \u00d7 10), hip OA (OR = 1.132, 95% CI: 1.009\u20131.269, P = 0.034) and knee OA (OR = 1.435. 95% CI: 1.286\u20131.602, P = 1.225 \u00d7 10). In contrast, no causal relationship was found between MVPA and OA (overall OA: OR = 0.895, 95% CI: 0.664\u20131.205, P = 0.465; hip OA: OR = 1.189, 95% CI: 0.792\u20131.786, P = 0.404; knee OA: OR = 0.707, 95% CI: 0.490 \u20101.021, P = 0.064). In addition, we observed significant heterogeneity in instrumental variables, but no horizontal pleiotropy was detected. Conclusions Recent findings demonstrated a protective impact of reducing LST on OA, independent of MVPA. This provides valuable insights into the role of physical activity in OA and offers lifestyle recommendations, such as reduc\u2010 ing recreational sedentary behaviors and promoting appropriate exercise, for individuals at risk of OA.",

            "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease caused by various factors, such as obesity, aging, and strain, which leads to degenerative damage of articular cartilage and reactive hyperplasia of joint marginal and subchondral bone [1, 2]. Studies have shown that loss of complete meniscus function due to joint instability or abnormal mechanical load can cause OA in humans [3, 4]. Although our understanding of the disease has advanced considerably [5], there is still no cure for OA [6]. Therefore, it is critical to identify modifiable risk factors and seek potential treatments to slow the progression or even prevent the disease [7], of which physical activity (PA) is one. PA is movement done by skeletal muscles that demands energy expenditure beyond a baseline level and encompasses workouts, sports, and PA conducted in everyday life, work, transportation, and recreation [8].\nPA is often seen as a factor that reduces the risk of OA. A meta-analysis based on data from 17 randomized clinical trials, including 1,705 patients, showed that resistance exercise was beneficial in reducing pain, relieving stiffness, and improving physical function in patients with OA of the knee [9]. One study concluded that higher levels of PA were associated with the maintenance of physical function and encouraged PA in older adults at risk of OA [10]. However, one randomized controlled trial showed that high-intensity PA did not result in improvements in physical functioning in patients with knee OA compared to low-intensity PA [11], and another study came to a similar conclusion [12]. Additionally, a study found a significant association between reduced sedentary behavior and a subsequent decrease in functional decline in the future, independent of time spent in MVPA [13], another study reached a similar conclusion [14]. In contrast, studies have shown that non-pharmacological OA prevention is not only based on regular PA but also on reducing the amount of time spent in sedentary activities throughout the day and changing sedentary behaviors [15]. However, there is evidence that in the general adult individuals, self-reported diagnosis of knee/hip OA was not associated with low, moderate or high levels of PA [16]. Because of the inherent limitations of reverse causality and potential bias in observational studies, the role of PA in OA etiology has yet to be convincingly concluded to date.\nMendelian randomization (MR) may be used for causal inference in epidemiology [17], which employs genetic variations closely associated with exposure as the exposure device to infer the causal influence of exposure on the result from non-experimental data. Due to the fact that genetic variations are allocated randomly at the time of conception, genetic analysis technologies provide substantial benefits by removing potential sources of error\nand establishing a clear chain of causation. In MR Analysis, the hypothesis of a causal relationship between exposure and outcome is supported if the observed genetic variation associated with exposure is also associated with the risk of the outcome. In addition, coupled with the wide availability of published genetic associations, MR became a time and cost-effective method and contributed to its growing popularity in evaluating and screening potential causal associations [18].\nIn this study, we performed a two-sample MR analysis, which allows the selection of genetic variants as instruments for a risk factor (PA) in one sample and explore associations of these variants with outcomes (OA) in another sample [19, 20]. By overcoming the requirement for estimating the exposure and outcomes in the same dataset, this approach is able to explore associations in publicly available aggregated statistics from large GWAS and increase power accordingly."

Two PA phenotypes were analyzed in this study, including self-reported leisure screen time (LST) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Activities such as swimming and jogging were classified as MVPA, while activities such as watching television, playing video games, and sitting at the computer were classified as LST. Different studies used different questionnaires to assess PA, so population-specific characteristics were defined to make optimal use of the available data. GWAS for the PA trait used an additive genetic model that was adjusted for age, age-squared, and other study-specific covariates. The standard quality control checks were conducted for GWAS data before imputation.\nSummary statistics for overall OA, hip OA, and knee OA were obtained from Arthritis Research UK Osteoarthritis Genetics Consortium cohorts, which were based on 417,596 (39,427 OA cases and 378,169 controls), 393,873 (15,704 OA cases and 378,169 controls), 403,124 (24,955 OA cases and 378,169 controls) European individuals [22].

Notably, persistent physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are generally associated with the developing risk of functional limitation in adults with knee OA independent of sedentary category [33], with a similar result also found in another study [35]. However, some studies have come to the opposite conclusion. Sixtynine studies from 23 countries have shown that multiple activities, including lifting weights and whole-body vibration, increase the risk of developing OA in men and women [37]. Besides, including 6 global, communitybased cohort studies, an international meta-analysis of individual participant-level data has suggested that physiologic energy expenditure during recreational activities and time spent in PA are not related to the risk of OA. Compared with large-scale prospective clinical trials requiring long-term observation, the MR analysis offers an efficient way to explore the causality between PA and the risk of OA [38]. Using the MR approach, our study confirmed that reducing LST would have a beneficial effect on OA. Therefore, the incidence of OA can be reduced by promoting lifestyle management, such as reducing recreational sedentary activities and encouraging appropriate exercise.\nOne possible explanation is that PA could function by inducing the expression and release of irisin in muscle tissue [39, 40]. On the one hand, the irisin-integrin-wnt/ \u03b2-catenin-Runx2 regulatory axis may form a signaling axis [41\u201343], regulating the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts. On the other hand, irisin can inhibit the apoptosis of chondrocytes by reducing inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinases in chondrocytes [44, 45], thereby exerting a protective effect on OA [46]. Besides, PA can function as an underlying immunomodulatory therapy. PA leads in dramatically increased T-regulatory cells, reduced immunoglobulin production, and alterations in the Th1/Th2 ratio, and has been proven to attenuate inflammatory events in patients and animal models of inflammatory disorders [47, 48]. As recently reported, the considerable improvement in function and pain following physical exercise intervention in overweight adults with knee OA is partially modulated by alterations in a mix of inflammatory markers, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1sR, and CRP [49]. These observational studies implied that PA might affect the pathogenesis of OA through modulation of inflammation.\nThe current study had several main advantages. Firstly, by assigning randomly allocated alleles to offspring and essentially immobilizing them at conception, MR results are less susceptible to confounding and reverse causal measurement errors than traditional observational studies. Secondly, our study utilized large-scale GWAS datasets from two distinct European populations to reduce\nthe effects of population stratification and increase statistical power for identifying a causal inference. Thirdly, multiple sensitivity analyses revealed no pleiotropy, further confirming the robustness of our results.\nNonetheless, there were several limitations worth mentioning in our study. Firstly, since the PA was ascertained by self-report, this was prone to recall and response bias. Secondly, given that our findings were mainly limited to participants of European ancestry, our conclusions may not be suitable for generalization to other kinds of populations. Thirdly, our MR analysis only yielded genetic evidence. Further larger or multiethnicity studies or prospective clinical trials should be conducted to validate our findings in the future, explore the underlying mechanisms of this possible causality and further explore related mechanisms. Lastly, our data had not demonstrated a causal relationship between MVPA and OA, so we should interpret the results cautiously."
