"Both panel and country-level causality analyses point out that economic freedom, government size, international trade freedom, and education are significant determinants of environmental degradation proxied by CO2 emissions, although country-level findings partially differ depending on country-specific characteristics in line with the theoretical expectations. Therefore, reforms toward market-oriented economic structures and education can be used effectively to combat environmental degradation by using market-based environmental instruments, raising environmental awareness, and developing green or energy-efficient technologies."
