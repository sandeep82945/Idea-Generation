A consensus on 31 the use of such diagnostic tools for optimal perioperative management of all PHPT patients has not 32 been reached. 33 Design 34 A decision tree model was constructed to estimate and compare the clinical outcomes and the cost-35 effectiveness of preoperative imaging modalities and intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) 36 monitoring criteria in a 14-year time horizon. The robustness of the model was assessed by 37 conducting a one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic uncertainty analysis. 38 Setting 39 The United States healthcare system. 40 Population 41 A hypothetical population consisting of 5,000 patients with sporadic, symptomatic, or 42 asymptomatic PHPT. 43 Interventions 44 Pre- and intraoperative diagnostic modalities for parathyroidectomy 45 Main outcome measures 46 Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), net monetary benefits (NMB), clinical outcomes 47 Results 48 In the base-case analysis, four-dimensional (4D)-computed tomography (CT) was the least 49 expensive strategy with $10,289 and 13.93 QALYs. Ultrasound and 99mTc-Sestamibi single-50\nphoton-emission computed tomography/CT were both dominated strategies, while 18F-51 fluorocholine positron emission tomography was cost-effective with a net monetary benefit of $264 52 considering a willingness to pay threshold of $95,958. The application of ioPTH monitoring with 53 the Vienna criterion decreased the rate of reoperations from 10.50 to 0.58 per 1,000 patients. Due 54 to an increased rate of bilateral neck explorations from 257.45 to 347.45 per 1,000 patients, it was 55 not cost-effective. 56 Conclusions 57 4D-CT is the most cost-effective instrument for the preoperative localization of parathyroid 58 adenomas. Due to an excessive increase of bilateral neck explorations, the use of ioPTH monitoring 59 is not cost-effective in PHPT but leads to a significant reduction of reoperations. 60 61 62 Strengths and limitations of the study 63 \u2022 Our decision tree model is the most complete for parathyroidectomy; incorporating both 64 solitary adenomas and multiglandular disease and ioPTH monitoring. 65 \u2022 In addition to cost-effectiveness, we present the impact of the interventions on the major 66 clinical outcomes. 67 \u2022 Our study is limited to the United States and does not include a societal perspective. 68 \u2022 The model did not consider the potential institutional variations in the prevelance of 69 multiglandular disease 70 \u2022 There remains uncertainty for certain parameters for the model as they were derived from 71 a limited number of single-institution studies 72\n73"

            "text": "Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder with a prevalence of one to 75 seven cases per 1,000 adults, and is the primary reason for hypercalcemia.1 In 70 - 90%, 10 \u2013 30%, 76 and less than 1% of the cases, the underlying cause is a single gland parathyroid adenoma, 77 multiglandular disease (MGD), and parathyroid carcinoma, respectively.2 Even though PHPT is 78 often diagnosed at an asymptomatic stage, the surgical removal of the diseased tissue is generally 79 recommended due to the long-term deleterious effects of PHPT and remains the only curative 80 treatment.3 81 To optimize surgical cure rates and to reduce operative trauma, surgeons often rely on imaging 82 technologies and specialists for the preoperative localization of the diseased gland(s). If a solitary 83 adenoma is suspected, a focused parathyroidectomy (FP) might be performed with a cure rate that 84 is comparable to the conventional bilateral neck exploration (BNE).4 FP is associated with reduced 85 operative times, risk of developing postoperative hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal 86 nerve (RLN) injury.5 However, the sensitivity and specificity of a preoperative localization vary 87 not only between the different preoperative diagnostic modalities but also between single adenomas 88 and MGD.6\u20139 89 If an FP is performed, an intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring is recommended 90 to exclude MGD and to avoid reoperations.10 The two most common criteria for defining surgical 91 success, measured as a 50% decline of the ioPTH level 10 minutes after resection, use different 92 baselines. The Miami criterion uses the highest ioPTH level (pre-incision or pre-excision) as the 93 baseline, while the Vienna criterion uses the pre-incision ioPTH level as the baseline.11 94 The overall clinical utility of ioPTH monitoring is under debate due to the risk of misleading 95 surgeons with false negatives and false positive results depending on the criterion used.12 96\nFurthermore, the application of ioPTH monitoring would require additional resources: increased 97 surgery time and the cost of the procedure.13 Some recent cost-effectiveness analyses focused only 98 on preoperative imaging modalities without considering the inclusion of patients with MGD and 99 reoperations.14 Other health economic evaluations only assessed the cost of preoperative 100 localization and ioPTH monitoring, omitting the clinical outcomes.12 The absence of a complete 101 evidence on the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of using either criterion for the ioPTH 102 evaluation contributes to the lack of consensus on whether the use of ioPTH monitoring is 103 warranted and what criterion should be for solitary adenomas and MGD.12 104 Thus, this study aims to estimate the clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of common 105 preoperative imaging modalities and ioPTH monitoring criteria for patients with sporadic, 106 symptomatic, or asymptomatic PHPT. 107 108\n2. METHODS 109 2.1 Decision-analytic model 110 We structured the clinical decision-making problem using the decision-analytic modeling 111 framework, where the architecture of the model is in the form of a decision-tree model. We 112 simulated a hypothetical population consisting of 5,000 65-year-old patients with sporadic, 113 symptomatic, or asymptomatic PHPT who met the recently updated National Institutes of Health 114 (NIH) criteria for parathyroid surgery and were eligible for Medicare reimbursements.10 The 115 available strategies included four preoperative imaging modalities: ultrasound, 99mTc-Sestamibi 116 single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT), four-117 dimensional (4D)-CT, 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography (FCH-PET/CT). For each 118 preoperative imaging modality, the use of ioPTH monitoring was considered. The baseline value 119 below which a decrease of ioPTH concentration is considered positive was determined by applying 120 either the Miami or Vienna criterion. 121 For patients with a solitary adenoma, an FP was performed after a successful preoperative 122 localization and an adequate decrease of ioPTH. A false negative localization of a solitary adenoma 123 resulted in BNE, while a false positive localization led first to a unilateral neck exploration (UNE) 124 and in cases where the adenoma was located on the contralateral side to a BNE. 125 For patients with MGD, a true positive localization and a true positive decrease of ioPTH led to 126 either a unilateral neck exploration (UNE) or BNE, depending on the localization of the adenomas, 127 whereas a false negative decrease of ioPTH resulted in a BNE. A false positive localization of 128 MGD with a false positive decrease of ioPTH leads to a reoperation after UNE or BNE. A false 129 positive localization of MGD with a true negative decrease of ioPTH leads to a BNE. A false 130 negative localization leads to a BNE. Fig1 depicts a simplified version of the decision-tree model. 131\nWe incorporated the following assumptions into the model. First, an adenoma can always be 132 differentiated macroscopically from a normal parathyroid gland by the surgeon in the absence of 133 ioPTH monitoring. Second, in case of a successful preoperative localization with an adequate 134 decrease of ioPTH, the surgeon would base his decisions solely on the ioPTH decrease and refrain 135 from further explorations. This assumption implies that, in the case of a false positive localization 136 of a single adenoma, the surgeon would perform a UNE/BNE irrespective of the ioPTH readout. 137 Therefore, we did not consider false positive and true negative ioPTH readouts for these events. 138 Since a false positive localization misses an adenoma in MGD, we considered false positive and 139 true negative ioPTH readouts in this case. Third, the time horizon of the analysis was the life 140 expectancy of a 65-year-old patient, which was estimated to be 14 years based on the US life table 141 15 and was assumed to be uniform across the different surgeries. Based on expert advice, we 142 assumed that the probability of complications, costs, and utilities for UNE are identical to those of 143 FP. For reoperations, we considered the same model architecture with an increased risk of 144 complications.16 Lastly, we assumed FP and BNE to be carried out in an outpatient and inpatient 145 setting, respectively. 146 When available, estimates for the probability parameters were derived from the latest systematic 147 reviews. The prevalence of solitary adenomas was taken from the latest surgical guideline by the 148 American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, which was based on a comprehensive review of 149 published papers from 1985 to 2015 by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.17 The sensitivity and 150 positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasonography in MGD were obtained from a systematic 151 literature review between 1995 and 2003.7 The sensitivity and PPV of SPECT/CT, 4D-CT and 152 FCH-PET/CT were retrieved from the latest systematic reviews 6,8, whereas the sensitivity and 153 PPV for FCH-PET/CT in MGD was taken from a single-institution study.9 The sensitivity and 154 specificity of the different ioPTH criteria were estimated from two single-institution studies with 155\n570 patients.11,18 The probabilities of developing persistent postoperative hypoparathyroidism and 156 persistent RLN injury were estimated from a randomized controlled trial with 91 patients.19 Table 157 1 lists all the model parameters\u2019 estimates and their sources. 158 159 2.2 Cost-effectiveness analysis 160 The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the healthcare system perspective, focusing 161 on the United States. To calculate the total costs for each strategy, we considered the costs of the 162 preoperative imaging modality, ioPTH assay, hospital stay (depending on the procedures), and the 163 surgery time multiplied by the costs of the operating theater per minute. Costs were reported in 164 2022 US dollars. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-based physician and facility costs of 165 surgery (CPT 60500), imaging (CPT 78072, CPT 76536, CPT 72127, CPT 78814, CPT A9552), 166 and ioPTH monitoring (CPT 83970) were derived from the US medical reimbursement schedule.20 167 As FCH-PET/CT is currently not authorized in the United States, we combined the cost of a neck 168 PET/CT scan (CPT 78814) with the price of the most commonly used radiotracer, 18F-169 fluorodeoxyglucose (CPT A9552). 170 We calculated anesthesiology fees (CPT 00320) by multiplying the base and time units, and the 171 national average anesthesia conversion factor (CF) taken from the 2022 Centers for Medicare & 172 Medicaid Services (CMS) release.21 The base unit for CPT 00320 was 6, and the time units were 173 expressed in 15-minute increments. The national average anesthesia CF was 21.5623. The length 174 of surgeries was converted into time units. The costs for outpatient (CPT 99223) and inpatient 175 (CPT 99217) hospital services were derived from a previous study 22, which calculated the costs 176 for the Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) 627. 177 We expressed the effectiveness of each intervention as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which 178 were calculated by multiplying the life expectancy by utility weights. The utility weights for 179\npersistent hypoparathyroidism and RLN injury, where a utility value of 1 corresponds to a perfect 180 state of health and 0 corresponds to being dead, were derived from previous studies that used Short 181 Form 36-Item Health Survey.23 As a metric for cost-effectiveness, we used the net monetary benefit 182 (NMB), which was calculated as the difference between two measures: 1) the total effectiveness 183 times the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, which values the effectiveness generated by the 184 intervention in terms of the opportunity cost forgone and 2) the total cost of the intervention. We 185 set the WTP threshold to US $95,958, according to the latest comprehensive report, which 186 calculated this value for 174 countries.24 We evaluated the following clinical outcomes, i.e., the 187 probabilities of reoperation due to missed MGDs, BNE, persistent postoperative 188 hypoparathyroidism, and persistent RLN injury, by calculating the proportion of people 189 experiencing these events in the simulated cohort. To simplify the model, we did not account for 190 radiation exposure for preoperative imaging modalities (4D-CT, SPECT/CT, and FCH-PET/CT). 191 192 2.3 Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses 193 To determine the influence of each model parameter on the model outcomes, we conducted a one-194 way sensitivity analysis by varying the parameter values within \u00b150% of their base case values and 195 evaluating the resulting effect on the NMBs. The sensitivity analysis was performed on all 196 parameters, and its result was presented as a tornado diagram, which ranks model parameters 197 according to their influences. To account for the effect of uncertainty in the model parameter 198 estimates, we conducted an uncertainty analysis using a Monte Carlo sampling approach. For 199 probabilities and utility weights, we fitted beta distributions, where the parameters were estimated 200 by using the method of moments.25 For costs, gamma distributions were used, and we followed the 201 same approach for estimating their parameters. When 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 202 available, we assumed that the CIs were 1.98*2 standard deviations wide. When only the lower 203\nand upper limits were reported, we assumed the limits to be equal to the 95% CIs. We generated 204 5,000 random samples of the parameters\u2019 estimates from the corresponding beta and gamma 205 distributions and evaluated our model at each sample. We presented the results of the uncertainty 206 analysis using scatter plots and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. To identify the values of 207 the influential parameters at which the conclusions of the cost-effectiveness analyses change (from 208 being cost-effective to not cost-effective), we performed threshold analyses. The selection of the 209 influential parameters was based on the results of the sensitivity analyses. 210 The construction of the decision-tree model and the analyses were performed using Python 3.9. 211 The Python codes are publicly available at https://github.com/danielbatora/batora_phpt_cea. 212\n3. RESULTS 213 3.1 Cost-effectiveness analysis 214 3.1.1 Base-case analysis 215 The least expensive preoperative localization modality was 4D-CT with $10,289 and 13.93 216 QALYs, which was followed by ultrasound with $10,740 and 13.89 QALYs and the SPECT/CT 217 with $10,778 and 13.91 QALYs. FCH-PET/CT was the most expensive modality with a cost of 218 $11,623, albeit it provided 13.94 QALYs (S1 Table). At a $95,958 WTP threshold, FCH-PET/CT 219 resulted in a NMB value of $264. For all imaging modalities, the addition of ioPTH monitoring 220 generated higher costs and fewer QALYs, thereby making them dominated strategies (Table 2). 221 The use of the Miami criterion was found to be less expensive and associated with more QALYs 222 in all cases when compared to using the Vienna criterion (Table 2). 223 224 3.1.2 Sensitivity analysis 225 We conducted two one-way sensitivity analyses focusing on comparing the non-dominated 226 preoperative localization strategies, and ioPTH monitoring. In the comparison between the non-227 dominated preoperative localization strategies without ioPTH monitoring, i.e., the 4D-CT 228 compared to FCH-PET/CT, the model was most sensitive to the prevalence of single adenomas 229 with NMB ranging from -$6,909 to $2,698, the sensitivity of FCH-PET/CT for single adenomas 230 with NBM ranging from -$6,651 to $1716, the cost of the FCH-PET/CT with NMB ranging from 231 -$726 to $1254 and the PPV of FCH-PET/CT for single adenomas and MGD with NMB ranging 232 from -$4,115 to $488 and -$2,080 to $335, respectively (Fig 2A). 233 In the comparison of the with and without ioPTH monitoring strategies for 4D-CT imaging, the 234 model was most sensitive to the prevalence of solitary adenomas with NMB ranging from -$6,743 235 to $1,452, followed by the sensitivity of the 4D-CT for single adenomas with NMB ranging from 236\n-$6,332 to $1,800, the sensitivity of ioPTH monitoring with NMB ranging from -$6,349 to -$409, 237 and the PPV of 4D-CT for single adenomas with NMB ranging from -$6,349 to -$409. 238 Furthermore, the results were sensitive to the cost for outpatient and inpatient hospital stay (-$1,473 239 \u2013 $242, -$1,306 \u2013 $71), the utility weights for complications (persistent hypoparathyroidism [-240 $2,849 \u2013 $192] and RLN injury [-$1,590 \u2013 -$30]) and the cost of the operating theater per minute 241 (-$1,150 \u2013 -$238) (Fig 2B). 242 243 3.1.3 Uncertainty analysis 244 When accounting for uncertainties in all parameters, the 4D-CT without ioPTH monitoring was 245 the least expensive strategy with $10,302 (95% CI $10,297-$10,307) and 13.926 QALYs (95% CI 246 13.942\u201313.943). The most expensive and the only non-dominated intervention was the FCH-247 PET/CT with $11,622 (95% CI $11,618\u2013$11,627) and 13.943 QALYs (95% CI 13.942\u201313.943) 248 (S2 Table). Varying the WTP thresholds from $20,000 to $500,000 revealed that the FCH-PET/CT 249 is unlikely to be cost-effective at WTP thresholds below $80,000 (Fig 3). 250 251 3.1.4 Threshold analysis 252 For 4D-CT, we identified the values for different parameters that would render the ioPTH 253 monitoring with the Miami criterion cost-effective: an MGD prevalence of more than 49%, a 254 positive predictive value of 4D-CT for detecting MGD of less than 70%, a probability of persistent 255 hypoparathyroidism due to reoperation of more than 39%, and a probability of persistent RLN 256 injury due to reoperation of more than 28% (Fig S1). 257 258 3.2 Clinical outcomes by using the Miami or Vienna criterion for ioPTH monitoring 259\nBy using 4D-CT with the Miami criterion, the rate of reoperations decreased from 10.50 to 2.77 260 per 1,000 patients compared to not using ioPTH monitoring. With the Vienna criterion, which has 261 a higher specificity, the rate of reoperations decreased to 0.57 per 1,000 patients compared to not 262 using ioPTH monitoring. 263 With the Miami criterion, the rate of BNEs increased from 257.48 to 274.38 per 1,000 patients, 264 while it increased to 347.45 per 1,000 patients with the Vienna criterion due to its lower sensitivity 265 compared to not using ioPTH monitoring. 266 The rate of complications associated with the surgery was higher with the Vienna criterion: the 267 overall probability of persistent hypoparathyroidism and persistent RLN injury increased from 2.91 268 to 3.81 per 1,000 patients and from 1.68 to 1.74 per 1,000 patients, respectively, compared to not 269 using ioPTH monitoring. With the Miami criterion, the rate of persistent hypoparathyroidism 270 increased to 3.03 per 1,000 patients, whereas the rate of persistent RLN injury decreased to 1.45 271 per 1,000 patients compared to not using ioPTH monitoring (Fig 4).With all the other preoperative 272 imaging modalities, the trends were generally similar (S3 Table). 273 274 4. DISCUSSION 275 This study evaluated the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of pre- and intraoperative diagnostic 276 tools in the surgical management of PHPT in the United States. The study has three major results. 277 First, 4D-CT alone was found to be the least extensive preoperative localization strategy and FCH-278 PET/CT to be cost-effective near the US WTP threshold. Second, the addition of ioPTH monitoring 279 decreased the frequency of reoperations; however, it was not cost-effective due to a higher rate of 280 BNEs, in addition to the assay and anesthesia costs. Third, the rate of BNEs was considerably 281 higher by using the Vienna criterion compared to the Miami criterion. 282\nAn accurate localization of parathyroid adenoma(s) is an important component of the preoperative 283 planning of parathyroid surgery. Our analysis demonstrated that 4D-CT was the least expensive 284 preoperative imaging modality, while both SPECT/CT and ultrasound were more expensive and 285 provided fewer QALYs than 4D-CT. FCH-PET/CT was superior to 4D-CT in terms of the QALYs 286 gained and is likely cost-effective below a $85,000 WTP threshold. Our results were consistent 287 with the most recent cost-effectiveness analysis14 despite using more conservative estimates for the 288 diagnostic performance parameters for several preoperative localization strategies (ultrasound, 289 Sestamibi-SPECT/CT, and 4D-CT) from the latest meta-analyses. A plausible explanation for 290 reaching a comparable conclusion might lie in the inclusion of MGD cases in our study, for which 291 the preoperative localization is considerably less accurate.6,7 292 Even though our analysis showed 4D-CT imaging to be the least expensive strategy, the use of 4D-293 CT as the first-in-line preoperative imaging modality in the future could be restricted to centers 294 with a high frequency of PHPT cases, as its operation requires considerable radiological training. 295 Furthermore, due to limited available data, our model could not evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 296 the sequential application of preoperative imaging modalities, which is commonly applied in 297 clinical practice to reserve the more expensive modalities for cases where the first-in-line treatment 298 is likely less accurate. 299 In our analysis, the addition of ioPTH monitoring was not cost-effective, even though it led to a 300 significantly reduced number of reoperations. The clinical benefit of ioPTH monitoring was 301 outweighed by erroneous classifications by the method, resulting in a substantial increase of 302 unnecessary BNEs. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the sensitivity of the assay 303 and the occupancy of the operating theater were key determinants in the cost-effectiveness of 304 ioPTH monitoring. In line with our results, the study of Badii et al. showed that ioPTH monitoring 305 was not cost-saving due to substantially longer operative times.13 Morris et al. suggested that the 306\nuse of ioPTH monitoring would only be beneficial in a relatively small fraction of patients where 307 the accuracy of preoperative localization was low.12 This finding is supported by our threshold 308 analysis, which revealed that only a PPV for MGD of less than 70% would render ioPTH 309 monitoring cost-effective. Recent technological innovations in the field aim to substantially reduce 310 both cost and time expenditure for ioPTH monitoring, which suggests the possibility of being cost-311 effective in the future.26,27 312 Overall, the interpretation of our cost-effectiveness analysis is limited to the United States. 313 However, our uncertainty analysis suggested that the decision-analytical model is robust and, 314 therefore, can be adapted to other countries with distinct cost structures as well. 315 In addition to the cost-effectiveness, reducing the complications in parathyroid surgery are 316 essential. We found that ioPTH monitoring using the Vienna criterion minimized the risk of 317 reoperations, while the Miami criterion minimized complication rates. The physical manipulation 318 of an adenoma during operation might lead to an increase in ioPTH.3 This risk could be higher in 319 the case of MGD due to the manipulation of more than one gland. The Miami criterion has a higher 320 risk of false positive results due to using the highest ioPTH level (pre-incision or pre-excision) as 321 the baseline value. Surgeons should therefore consider using the Vienna criterion for patients with 322 suspected MGD to maximize specificity and the Miami criterion for patients with suspected 323 solitary adenoma to maximize sensitivity. 324 325 4.1 Limitations of the study 326 As the use of FCH-PET/CT and 4D-CT imaging has only been recently introduced for the 327 localization of parathyroid adenomas, there were only a handful of available systematic reviews to 328 inform the estimates of the model parameters related to the imaging modality. Hence, for the 329 sensitivity and PPV values for FCH-PET/CT in MGD, we relied on data from a single institutional 330\nreport9, which limits the generalizability of our results. Similarly, data for estimating the model 331 parameters related to the ioPTH protocol were derived from a limited number of studies, which 332 showed considerable variations in the estimates. To overcome this limitation in the evidence base, 333 we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine how robust the conclusions were to variation in the 334 model parameter values. Furthermore, our uncertainty analysis accounted for the effect of 335 uncertainty in the estimates of the model parameters on the cost-effectiveness analysis results. 336 Nevertheless, meta-analyses that stratify solitary adenomas and MGD are warranted to reduce the 337 risk of bias in the performance values of localization techniques. 338 Moreover, the true rate of solitary adenomas is also debated, as some institutions report a 339 significantly higher rate of MGD than the consensus value.2 Accordingly, our threshold analysis 340 reveals that the prevalence of MGD strongly impacts the complication rates which influences the 341 cost-effectiveness of ioPTH monitoring. Therefore, it is critical to consider the existing institutional 342 variations in this parameter during the decision-making process. In addition, as FCH-PET/CT is 343 not yet authorized in the US, our model likely underestimates the future cost of FCH by inferring 344 from the cost of the most used PET tracer, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (CPT A9552); suggesting that 345 the threshold to reach cost-effectiveness for FCH-PET/CT might be higher than estimated. 346 Similarly, as a societal perspective was not incorporated into our evaluation, e.g., absence from 347 work due to inpatient hospitalization, the economic consequences of unnecessary BNEs due to 348 ioPTH monitoring might be underestimated in our model. 349 4.2 Conclusions 350 In our decision-analytical model of parathyroidectomy that also considered the MGD cases, 4D-351 CT was found to be the least expensive diagnostic tool for the preoperative localization of 352 parathyroid adenomas, and FCH-PET/CT is likely a cost-effective modality. Due to an excessive 353 increase of BNEs, the use of ioPTH monitoring was found not cost-effective in PHPT but led to a 354\nsignificant reduction in the rate of reoperations. If ioPTH monitoring is used, our model suggest 355 that the Miami criterion should be applied for suspected solitary adenomas and the Vienna criterion 356 for suspected MGD. 357\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS 358 4D: four-dimensional 359 BNE: bilateral neck exploration 360 CF: conversion factor 361 CI: confidence interval 362 CPT: Current Procedural Terminology 363 CT: computed tomography 364 DRG: Diagnostic-Related Group 365 FCH-PET: 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography 366 FP: focused parathyroidectomy 367 ioPTH: intraoperative parathyroid hormone 368 MGD: multiglandular disease 369 NIH: National Institutes of Health 370 NMB: net monetary benefit 371 PHPT: primary hyperparathyroidism 372 RLN: recurrent laryngeal nerve 373 SPECT: single-photon-emission computed tomography 374 UNE: unilateral neck exploration 375 WTP: willingness-to-pay 376 377 378 379 380 381\nFunding: This study was funded by the 'Ruth & Arthur Scherbarth Stiftung'. 382 Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest. 383 Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Prof. Dr. med.

Simplified illustration of the decision-tree model. 421 Patients diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) due to a single adenoma or 422 multiglandular disease (MGD) had a preoperative imaging (four-dimensional [4D]-computed 423 tomography [CT], ultrasound, 99mTc-Sestamibi single-photon-emission computed tomography 424 [SPECT]/CT or 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography [FCH-PET/CT]). The use of 425 intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring was considered for each intervention. 426 Based on the result of preoperative imaging and ioPTH monitoring, either focused 427\nparathyroidectomy (FP), unilateral neck exploration (UNE) or bilateral neck exploration (BNE) 428 was performed. The following surgical complications were considered: persistent 429 hypoparathyroidism and persistent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury. 430\n431\nFigure 2. One-way sensitivity analysis. 432 A: Variation of the parameters of the 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography (FCH-433 PET/CT) without intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring within \u00b150% of their 434 base case values. Incremental net monetary benefits were calculated in comparison with the base 435 case values of the four-dimensional-computed tomography (4D-CT) without ioPTH monitoring, as 436 this was the least expensive intervention in our base case analysis. 437 B: Varying the parameters were done in a similar manner as in panel A. Incremental net monetary 438 benefits of 4D-CT with ioPTH monitoring were calculated in comparison with the base case values 439 of the 4D-CT without ioPTH monitoring. 440 Abbreviations: BNE, bilateral neck exploration; FP, focused parathyroidectomy; MGD, 441 multiglandular disease; PPV, positive predictive value; RLN, recurrent laryngeal nerve; UNE, 442 unilateral neck exploration. 443\n444\nFigure 3. Uncertainty analysis. 445 A: Scatter plots showing the outcome of the Monte Carlo simulation. For each parameter, beta or 446 gamma distributions were fitted. In all, 5,000 samples were drawn from the distributions and were 447 used for the subsequent analysis in the decision-tree model. Total costs and quality-adjusted life 448 years (QALYs) were calculated for each sample. 449 B: A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was generated from the result of the Monte Carlo 450 simulation. We varied the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold from 20,000 to 500,000; and 451 calculated the proportion of the highest net monetary benefit (NMB) for each intervention. Below 452 a WTP threshold of $80,000, 4D-CT without intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) 453 monitoring yields the biggest proportion of highest NMBs. Above a WTP threshold of $80,000, 454 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography (FCH-PET/CT) becomes the dominant strategy. 455 In the range of a WTP threshold between $20,000 and $500,000, 99mTc-Sestamibi single-photon-456 emission computed tomography [SPECT]/computed tomography [CT] and ultrasound are 457 dominated strategies. 458\nAbbreviation: 4D-CT, four-dimensional-CT. 459\n460\nFigure 4. The impact of different ioPTH criteria on the main clinical events using four-461 dimensional-computed tomography (4D-CT) 462 Differences in clinical events per 1,000 parathyroidectomies compared with patients without 463 intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring. In addition to the Miami and Vienna 464 criterion, we evaluated the combined use of the Miami criterion for solitary adenomas and the 465 Vienna criterion for suspected multiglandular disease. Unnecessary bilateral neck explorations 466 (BNEs) were minimized by applying the Miami criterion (+17 BNEs compared to patients without 467 ioPTH monitoring), while reoperations were minimized by using the Vienna criterion (-10 468 reoperations compared to patients without ioPTH monitoring). 469 Abbreviation: RLN, recurrent laryngeal nerve. 470 471\n472 Figure S1. Threshold analysis on parameters for the four-dimensional-CT (4D-CT). 473 Assessment of the theoretical possibility of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) 474 monitoring with a positive net monetary benefit value. Each parameter of the 4D-CT with ioPTH 475 monitoring (Miami criterion) was varied from 0 to 1 for probabilities and utility weights, 476 respectively, and 0 to the base case value for costs. Incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) was 477 calculated in comparison with the 4D-CT without ioPTH monitoring. 478 Abbreviations: BNE, bilateral neck exploration; MGD, multiglandular disease; PPV, positive 479 predictive value; RLN, recurrent laryngeal nerve; 4D-CT, four-dimensional-CT. 480\nReferences 481 1.
