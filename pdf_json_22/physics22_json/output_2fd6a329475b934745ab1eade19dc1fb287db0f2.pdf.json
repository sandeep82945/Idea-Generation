            "text": "Micro-instabilities driven by electron temperature gradients excite turbulence and lead to anomalous electron thermal transport. Because such a transport event is associated with the degradation of confinement in fusion devices, predicting the transport level is one of the most important issues in designing future fusion devices. However, the physics of electron thermal transport in fusion devices is not yet fully understood. Electrostatic turbulence driven by the electron temperature gradient (ETG) mode or trapped electron mode (TEM) is known to increase transport in low-\u03b2 devices (\u03b2 is the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure). In higher-\u03b2 devices, turbulence driven by electromagnetic micro-instabilities involving magnetic fluctuations may play a role in causing anomalous transport. ar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n09 28\n3v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. pl\nas m\nA number of gyrokinetic simulations dedicated to specific experimental devices,\nsuch as standard tokamaks [1, 2], spherical tokamaks [3, 4, 5, 6], and reversed-field pinches (RFP) [7, 8], have demonstrated that the microtearing mode, which is an electromagnetic mode, becomes unstable and causes electron transport comparable to the measured experimental value [9, 10]. The microtearing mode enables topological changes in magnetic field structures and generates small-scale islands that may overlap to provide a stochastic magnetic field structure, thereby enhancing electron transport along the field lines [11, 12]. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations for the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) device [9, 13] have estimated that although an oversimplified assumption that local transport and global confinement can be directly compared is employed, transport scaling with respect to collisionality is roughly consistent with global energy confinement scaling.\nThe first linear theory of microtearing instability was presented by Hazeltine et\nal. [14] using a kinetic model that included the rigorous Fokker\u2013Planck collision operator. It extends the tearing mode theory based on a fluid model [15] to include a nonuniform background temperature and to avoid assuming a highly collisional fluid limit. In these analyses, a standard multi-scale treatment was employed. Given a sheared magnetic field B(x), a boundary layer (inner region) may appear near the singular point x = xs, where B \u00b7 \u2207|xs = 0 owing to the singular perturbation nature of non-ideal terms, such as resistivity. The inner-region solution is asymptotically matched with the outer-region solution of an ideal fluid model. Hazeltine et al. discovered that the velocity dependence of the collision frequency is indispensable for tapping the free energy associated with the temperature gradient to drive microtearing instability. Subsequently, the electron\u2013ion collision frequency dependence of the microtearing mode has been investigated theoretically [16] and numerically [17, 18]. A remarkable conclusion has demonstrated that the growth rate of the mode is non-monotonic with respect to the collision frequency, with the growth rate peaking at \u03c9\u2217e . \u03bdei, where \u03c9\u2217e and \u03bdei are the electron diamagnetic drift frequency and electron\u2013ion collision frequency, respectively. The microtearing mode is stabilized in both collisionless and collisional limits. The collisional driving mechanism of the microtearing mode is ascribed to the thermal force arising from the interaction between the electron temperature gradient and velocitydependent collisions. Hassam derived electron transport equations using the Chapman\u2013 Enskog expansion of the electron Fokker\u2013Planck equation under the assumption that \u03c9/\u03bdei 1 [19, 20], where the second-order terms in \u03c9/\u03bdei are retained. (\u03c9\u22121 is the timescale of interest.) It is shown that the time-dependent thermal force appears only in the second order and makes the mode unstable.\nHowever, the linear theory of the microtearing mode remains controversial. The\nmost debatable issue is whether the microtearing mode becomes unstable in weakly collisional or collisionless plasmas. Some numerical evidence shows a reconnecting instability driven by the electron temperature gradient in collisionless slab plasmas [21, 22, 23]. It is argued that there is a tearing-parity electromagnetic ETG mode in a slab, which has different characteristics from the microtearing mode [22, 23]. In toroidal\ngeometry, theoretical and simulation studies [24, 25, 26] have shown that trapped particle effects can drive the collisionless microtearing mode.\nIn this paper, we review existing theoretical studies on the microtearing mode\nand present numerical analyses using a gyrokinetic model, focusing on collision effects. We restrict our analyses to slab geometry as the simplest problem setup to clarify the essential destabilizing mechanism of the mode. Through the analyses, we conclude that the slab microtearing mode is stable in the collisionless regime as long as a certain condition for \u03b2 and \u03bdei is satisfied.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We present theoretical analyses\nof tearing-type instability using a fluid model in Sec. 2. The effects of the magnetic shear and temperature gradient are highlighted. Numerical simulations of the microtearing mode using the electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulation code AstroGK [27] are presented in Sec. 3. The collision effects are estimated in terms of the transport coefficients, and an instability region is identified where the time-dependent thermal force works as an instability mechanism. A nonlinear evolution of the microtearing mode is also discussed in the same section. Finally, we summarize the paper in Sec. 4."

The form of conductivity varies depending on the model. In the following analyses, we use collisional conductivity derived from the fluid model of Hassam [19]. This is essentially the same as that derived from the kinetic models, as long as the collision effects are sufficiently strong.\nIn this section, we review instability analyses induced by the temperature gradient\nand collisions. We first consider the case without magnetic shear, where the electromagnetic drift-wave-type mode is destabilized owing to time-dependent thermal force. Then, we proceed to tearing-type instabilities in non-uniform temperature plasmas. The similarity between the instability mechanisms with and without magnetic shear is discussed."

            "text": "The thermal force is an effective force acting on electrons with a non-uniform temperature profile. Because the collisionality \u03bdei, defined as (see, for example, [28])\n\u03bdei \u2261 \u221a 2niZ 2e4 ln \u039b\n16\u03c0 20m 1/2 e T 3/2 e\n, (1)\ndepends on the temperature, an imbalance of friction forces caused by collisions with background ions occurs, which leads to net momentum transfer in the opposite direction\nto the temperature gradient. In the presence of a strong magnetic field (\u03bdei/\u2126ce 1, where \u2126ce is the electron cyclotron frequency), electrons move freely along the field lines and gyrate around the magnetic field. Consequently, the thermal force in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field differs by a factor of \u03bdei/\u2126ce. In the following, we only consider the thermal force in the parallel direction. The thermal force for strongly magnetized plasmas is given by\nF th\u2016 = \u2212\u03b1tne\u2207\u2016Te, (2)\nwhere ne and Te are the electron density and temperature, respectively, and the numerical factor \u03b1t was estimated as \u03b1t = 0.71 for hydrogen by Braginskii [29]. The derivative is taken in the direction of the magnetic field \u2207\u2016 = B \u00b7 \u2207/|B|. Hassam [19] later obtained nonlinear transport equations for electrons with a less restricted constraint than that of Braginskii\u2019s, that is, \u03c9 \u03bdei. The generalized Ohm\u2019s law is given by [20]\n\u03b1i \u2202\n\u2202t (meneu\u2016,e) = \u2212eneE\u2016\u2212\u2207\u2016(neTe) + ene\u03b7j\u2016\u2212\u03b1tne\u2207\u2016Te +\u03b1t\u03b1tt\n1\n\u03bdei\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n( ne\u2207\u2016Te ) . (3)\nThe resistivity \u03b7 is also written in terms of the collisionality \u03b7/\u00b50 = \u03b1\u03b7\u03bdeid 2 e, where \u00b50 is the vacuum permeability, and de is the electron skin depth. The coefficient is \u03b1\u03b7 = 0.38 [29, 30]\u2021. The newly appeared smaller-order terms in \u03c9/\u03bdei are the inertia term on the LHS (me is the electron mass, and u\u2016,e is the electron flow in the magnetic field direction) and the time-dependent thermal force in the last term of the RHS. \u03b1t, \u03b1tt, and \u03b1i are numerical factors depending on the collision model, which vanish in the collisionless limit. It will be shown shortly that the time-dependent thermal force brings about an instability where a magnetic field fluctuation is amplified to develop current filaments (the self-filamentation mode) [20].\nWe consider a non-uniform plasma with density n0e(x) and temperature T0e(x)\nembedded in a uniform magnetic field given by B0 = Bz0z\u0302. The density and temperature gradients are taken in the x direction: L\u22121n0e = \u2212\u2202x lnn0e and L \u22121 T0e\n= \u2212\u2202x lnT0e. When a small perturbation B\u0303 = B\u0303xx\u0302 = \u2202yA\u0303zx\u0302 (B\u0303x Bz0) is applied, it propagates because of the electron force balance along the field line. Faraday\u2019s law in the parallel direction,\n\u2202A\u0303\u2016 \u2202t = \u2212E\u0303\u2016, (4)\nand the generalized Ohm\u2019s law (3) constitute a closed set of equations for magnetic fluctuation. Note that A\u0303\u2016 = A\u0303z if Bz0 = \u2202xAy0. By eliminating the electric field and assuming a plane-wave solution \u221d e\u2212i(\u03c9t\u2212kyy), we obtain\n\u2212i\u03c9A\u0303\u2016 = \u2212i\u03b1i\u03c9 meu\u0303\u2016,e e \u2212 \u03b7j\u0303\u2016 \u2212 B\u0303x Bz0 T0e e\n[ L\u22121n0e + L \u22121 T0e ( 1 + \u03b1t + \u03b1t\u03b1tt i\u03c9\n\u03bde\n)] . (5)\n\u2021 Note that the number is different from that written in [29] because we use \u03bdei = (3 \u221a \u03c0/4)/\u03c4e, where \u03c4e is the collision time used in [29].\nThe current and parallel electron flow are expressed in terms of A\u0303\u2016 if the ion parallel flow is negligible, j\u0303\u2016 = \u2212en0eu\u0303\u2016,e = \u2212(1/\u00b50)\u22072A\u0303\u2016.

(11)\nIn the leading order of , the fluctuation propagates in the y direction with a frequency of \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2217n0e + (1 + \u03b1t)\u03c9\u2217T0e . We refer to this wave as an electromagnetic drift wave. In the subsequent order, a positive imaginary part of \u03c9 arises. Only the time-dependent thermal force proportional to \u03b1tt has a destabilizing effect. The electromagnetic drift wave and its destabilization are shown in Fig. 1. The time-dependent thermal force causes a lag in the inductive electric field behind the magnetic field perturbation and leads to an increase in the perturbation."

Similar expressions can be derived from kinetic electron treatment using specific collision models [16, 22]. In the collisional limit, where k2\u2016D\u2016/\u03c9 1, the conductivity becomes spatially uniform. As the collision effects become weaker, the parallel current and conductivity tend to peak around the singular point where k \u00b7B \u2248 0, similar to those obtained from kinetic theory.

Even though the equations can be solved analytically, we derive a scaling relation in a rather intuitive manner, implicitly employing knowledge of the analytic solution. By integrating (18) over the inner region (0 < x < \u03b4), we obtain( 1\u2212 \u03c9\u2217n0e\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217T0e \u03c9 )\u22121 a2 \u03c4R \u222b \u03b4 0 \u22022A\u0303\u2016 \u2202x2 dx = \u222b \u03b4 0 ( \u2212i\u03c9A\u0303\u2016 \u2212By0 x a v\u0303x ) dx\u221d \u2212i\u03c9A\u0303\u2016(0)\u03b4.\n(20)\nThe main part of the integral comes from the A\u0303\u2016 term, which is approximately constant and is denoted by A\u0303\u2016(0) (the so-called constant\u2013A\u2016 approximation [15]). Since the exact solution of v\u0303x smoothly and asymptotically approaches to a constant of order unity away from the singular point [31], the effect of the flow term in the integral is minor and is expressed by a numerical factor. (In this paper, we exclusively set the proportionality factor as unity, because this does not matter for scaling laws.) Using the definition of the tearing parameter \u2206\u2032,\n\u2206\u2032\n2 =\n1\nA\u0303\u2016(0)\n[ \u2202A\u0303\u2016 \u2202x ]\u03b4 0 , (21)\nwe obtain\n\u2212i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217e) = 1\n\u03c4R\n\u2206\u2032a2\n2\u03b4 , (22)\nwhere we define \u03c9\u2217e \u2261 \u03c9\u2217n0e + \u03c9\u2217T0e . The inner-layer width \u03b4 is estimated as (\u03b4/a)4 \u2248 \u03c92\u03c4 2A/(i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217e)\u03c4R) from (18) and (19). The integration is truncated at \u03b4 because the electric field (integrand) disappears in the outer region. Therefore, around x \u03b4, where A\u0303\u2016 \u2248 (\u2206\u2032/2)A\u0303\u2016(0)x, the flow v\u0303x has the form\nv\u0303x \u2248 \u2212 1\nBy0\n\u2206\u2032a\n2 i\u03c9A\u0303\u2016(0). (23)\nFor a positive \u2206\u2032, the flow points toward the X point.\nIf there is no drift, \u03c9\u2217e = 0, we recover the normal tearing mode solution:\n\u03b30\u03c4A = =(\u03c9\u03c4A) = (\u2206\u2032a/2)4/5S\u22123/5, where S \u2261 \u03c4R/\u03c4A is the Lundquist number. Solving (22) for the limit \u03c9\u2217e \u03b30 or \u03c9\u2217e \u03b30, we obtain the drift-tearing mode solutions\n\u03c9\u03c4A =\n{ 3 5 \u03c9\u2217e\u03c4A + i\u03b30\u03c4A ( 1\u2212 3 25 (\u03c9\u2217e/\u03b30) 2 )\n(\u03c9\u2217e \u03b30) \u03c9\u2217e\u03c4A + i 1/3(\u03b30\u03c4A) 5/3(\u03c9\u2217e\u03c4A) \u22122/3 (\u03c9\u2217e \u03b30) . (24)\nIn Fig. 3, a numerical solution to the dispersion relation (22) is shown in the complex \u03c9 plane. As \u03c9\u2217e increases, the growth rate decreases and asymptotes to scaling \u03c9 \u22122/3 \u2217e . The argument of \u03c9 decreases from \u03c0/2 to zero, which corresponds to the phase difference between A\u0303\u2016 and v\u0303x (see (19)). Figure 4 shows how the drift stabilizes the tearing mode. In Fig. 4 (a), a normal tearing case is shown. The black solid lines represent the magnetic field lines, and the red arrows indicate the direction of the plasma flows. The direction of the flow corresponding to the sign of \u2206\u2032 is determined by the competition between the magnetic tension force and pressure force. Even though the magnetic tension force tends to expel plasmas outward (opposite direction to the red arrows), plasmas are attracted to the X point to maintain the incompressibility. Therefore, the flux is continuously supplied and grows exponentially. When finite drift is incorporated, the amount of flux supplied to the X point is reduced because the location of the maximum flow slips off from the X point (Fig. 4(b)). In the negative \u2206\u2032 case (Fig. 4(c)), the flows are in opposite directions. Therefore, the magnetic perturbation is damped. One might expect that the drift destabilizes the mode for \u2206\u2032 < 0 if it convects the X point to the position where the flow points inward. However, this never occurs because the phase difference never exceeds zero.\nWe now discuss the destabilization mechanism of collisional microtearing instability\n(\u03b1t, \u03b1tt, \u03b1i 6= 0). The parallel conductivity becomes\n\u03c3\u2016 = 1\n\u03b7\n[ 1\u2212 \u03c9\u2217n0e\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217T0e \u03c9\n( 1 + \u03b1t + \u03b1t\u03b1tt i\u03c9\n\u03bdei\n)]( 1\u2212 \u03b1i\n\u03b1\u03b7\ni\u03c9 \u03bdei\n)\u22121 . (25)\nBy substituting (25) into (16), and integrating over the inner layer \u03b4MT, we obtain \u2212i\u03c9 (\n1\u2212 (\u03c9\u2217n0e + (1 + \u03b1t)\u03c9\u2217T0e) \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b1t\u03b1tt i\u03c9\u2217T0e \u03bdei\n)( 1\u2212 \u03b1i\n\u03b1\u03b7\ni\u03c9 \u03bdei\n)\u22121 = 1\nc\n1\n\u03c4R\n\u2206\u2032a\n2\u03b4MT . (26)\nThe layer width \u03b4MT is given by\n\u03b44MT a4 = \u03c4 2A \u03c4R\n\u03c92\ni(\u03c9 \u2212 (\u03c9\u2217n0e + (1 + \u03b1t)\u03c9\u2217T0e)\u2212 \u03b1t\u03b1tt\u03c9\u2217T0e(i\u03c9/\u03bdei))\n( 1\u2212 \u03b1i\n\u03b1\u03b7\ni\u03c9 \u03bdei\n) . (27)\nBy substituting (27) into (26), and using the collisional condition \u03c9/\u03bdei 1, we obtain the following dispersion relation for the collisional microtearing mode:[\n1\u2212 \u03c9\u2217MT \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03c9\u2217T0e\n\u03bdei\n( \u03b1t\u03b1tt +\n\u03b1i \u03b1\u03b7 \u03c9\u2217MT \u03c9\u2217T0e\n)]3 = i\n\u03c95\n( \u2206\u2032a\n2c\u03c4 3/4 R \u03c4 1/2 A\n)4 = i (\u03b30 \u03c9 )5 , (28)\nwhere \u03c9\u2217MT \u2261 \u03c9\u2217n0e + (1 + \u03b1t)\u03c9\u2217T0e . For simplicity, we define a new parameter \u03b1tt,i \u2261 \u03b1t\u03b1tt + (\u03b1i/\u03b1\u03b7)(\u03c9\u2217MT/\u03c9\u2217T0e). We look for a solution\n\u03c9 \u03bdei \u223c \u03c9\u2217n0e \u03bdei \u223c \u03c9\u2217T0e \u03bdei \u223c 1. (29)\nIf (\u03b30/\u03c9) 5/3 \u223c O(1), we arrive at the same solution as in the drift-tearing case, which is stable if \u2206\u2032 < 0. However, if we consider (\u03b30/\u03c9) 5/3 \u223c , we obtain the following unstable microtearing mode solution:\n\u03c9\u03c4A = \u03c9\u2217MT\u03c4A ( 1 + \u03b1tt,i\ni\u03c9\u2217T0e \u03bdei\n) + i1/3(\u03b30\u03c4A) 5/3(\u03c9\u2217MT\u03c4A) \u22122/3. (30)\nIf \u03b30/\u03c9 is even smaller, we recover the same dispersion relation as in the selffilamentation mode. Because the second term including \u03b30 stabilizes the microtearing mode if \u2206\u2032 < 0, only the term proportional to \u03b1tt,i causes instability. The destabilization mechanism is the same as in the self-filamentation mode, that is, the lag of the inductive electric field behind the magnetic field owing to the time-dependent thermal force and electron inertia. Note that these two effects result in essentially the same effect and are indistinguishable. Hereafter, we refer to this force as time-dependent thermal/inertia force.\nAs discussed in [32], the spatial structure of the microtearing mode is significantly\ndifferent from that of the normal and drift-tearing modes, which are driven by the macroscopic magnetic field characterized by \u2206\u2032. When the thermal conductivity is invoked in the weakly collisional case, the temperature fluctuations are washed out at around \u2206\u03ba, where \u2206 2 \u03ba \u2261 \u03c9/(k\u2032\u2016 2\u03ba\u2016). Consequently, the plasma attempts to move faster near k\u2016 = 0. The resultant diamagnetic current near the singular point shields the magnetic perturbation in the outer region from the singular point. If magnetic diffusion over a single wave period \u223c \u03c9\u2217e does not reach \u2206\u03ba, such that\n\u2206\u03ba \u2206\u03b7 \u2261 (\n\u03b7\n\u00b50\u03c9\u2217T0e\n)1/2 , (31)\nthe mode is localized near the singular point. The localization is characterized by \u03b2\u0302T \u2261 (\u03b2e/2)(Bz0a/(By0LT0e))2 \u221d \u22062\u03ba/\u22062\u03b7. For large \u03b2\u0302T, the microtearing mode is disconnected from the outer region and thus is independent of \u2206\u2032. From the scaling, the current layer width of the microtearing mode in the leading order is scaled as \u03b4MT/a \u223c (a/(Sde))1/2. (For the normal tearing mode, \u03b4/a \u223c (\u03b30\u03c4A/S)1/4.) Finally, we comment on the collisionless case, although the analyses presented here are not applicable to the collisionless case because they are based on the collisional model. As the collision frequency decreases, the destabilization term may increase as long as \u03b1tt,i is constant. However, as might be expected, the effects of the thermal forces and inertia induced by collisions must vanish in the collisionless limit, that is, \u03b1tt,i \u2192 0. From the numerical simulations, we observe that the microtearing mode is stabilized in a weakly collisional regime. In the collisionless regime, the genuine electron inertia works as an effective magnetic diffusion within de near the singular point. However, the magnetic shielding also works to stabilize the mode if the condition (\u2206\u03ba/de) 2 1 is satisfied, which is read as\n\u03b2\u0302T 2\u03b1\u03ba 3\n( \u03b7e\n\u03b7e + 1 )2 \u03c9\u2217e \u03bdei . (32)\nWe speculate that as long as the condition (32) is met, the genuine inertia does not contribute to the collisionless microtearing mode destabilization, as shown by Drake and Lee [16]."

The simulation setup follows that of a previous tearing instability study [33], which is equivalent to the configuration discussed in Sec. 2.2. For the microtearing instability study, we stabilize the normal tearing mode by setting \u2206\u2032 < 0 and additionally apply the electron temperature gradient LT0e and density gradient Ln0e .\nThe basic parameters are chosen as follows: \u03b2e = 0.024 with reference to NSTX [6],\nkya = 2.5 (\u2206 \u2032a = \u22124.58), Bz0a/(By0LT0e) = 500, \u03b7e \u2261 L\u22121T0e/L \u22121 n0e = 1, n0e = n0i = n0, \u03c4 \u2261 T0i/T0e = 1, \u03c3 \u2261 me/mi = 1/1836, Z = \u2212qi/e = 1, and \u03c1Se/a = 0.0141, where \u03c1Se \u2261 \u221a miT0e/(eBz0) is the ion-sound Larmor radius. We scan the collision frequency \u03bdei ranging from \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e \u2248 100 (highly collisional regime) to \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e \u2248 0.01 (weakly collisional regime).\nAs discussed in Sec. 2.2, the destabilization physics of the slab microtearing mode\nis the time-dependent thermal/inertia force (see (30)). To highlight this destabilization mechanism, we choose parameters that satisfy \u03c9\u2217MT\u03c4A \u223c \u03c9\u2217e\u03c4A (\u03b30\u03c4A)5/2, where \u03c9\u2217e\u03c4A can be represented by \u03b2\u0302T as \u03c9\u2217e\u03c4A = (\u03c1Se/a)(\u03b2\u0302T) 1/2(1/\u03b7e + 1).

AstroGK employs the model\nFokker\u2013Planck collision operator, which includes pitch-angle scattering, energy diffusion, and conserving terms to ensure the conservation of the particle number, momentum, and energy. Basically, the collisionality is dependent on the particle velocity; therefore, the velocity-dependent collision frequencies for various collision operators are given by the collision frequency \u03bdst between the particle species s and t, multiplied by some function of v/vth. For example, the Lorentz collision operator includes \u03bdst(v/vth,s) \u22123. Such velocity dependences in the collision operators can be switched off artificially in AstroGK. We show that these velocity-dependent collision frequencies are necessary for the microtearing mode to become unstable, as theoretically predicted. In this study, we consider the electron\u2013electron and electron\u2013ion collision frequencies as free parameters and set \u03bdee = \u03bdei. We ignore the ion collisions \u03bdii = \u03bdie = 0. Unless otherwise stated, we use the full collision operator including pitch-angle scattering, energy diffusion, and conserving terms with the velocity-dependent collision frequency."

            "text": "3.2.1. Properties of the linear microtearing mode We solve the linear initial value problem and obtain the complex eigen-frequencies for the most unstable (least stable) mode with the given parameters. Figure 5 shows the collision-frequency dependence of the microtearing mode. The collision frequency \u03bdei, mode growth rate =(\u03c9), and real frequency <(\u03c9) are normalized by the diamagnetic drift frequency \u03c9\u2217e = \u03c9\u2217T0e + \u03c9\u2217n0e . The blue circles and magenta crosses correspond to cases with and without the energy diffusion operator, respectively. The red dashed line is the theoretical curve corresponding to (26) obtained using the coefficients \u03b1t and \u03b1tt,i measured from the simulation results, as shown later in Fig. 9. The real frequencies in the left figure are <(\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9\u2217e for all regimes from \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e \u2248 100 to \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e \u2248 0.01 and are almost independent of the collision operators. The growth rates in the right figure show a non-monotonic dependence on the collision frequency for both collision operators. The growth rate peaks at \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e = 1.56 for the collision operator with energy diffusion, whereas it peaks at \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e = 5.0 for the operator without energy diffusion, which is approximately 1.6 times higher than the maximum growth rate obtained using energy diffusion. The energy diffusion operator strongly suppresses the mode growth. This discrepancy in collision operators is most remarkable in 1 . \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e . 10. It should be noted that linear stability is quite sensitive to the collision model, particularly in the semi-collisional regime. The microtearing mode is stable at both collisionless and collisional limits. These results qualitatively agree with those of previous studies [17, 18]. The stability threshold is reached at approximately \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e \u223c 0.01. The microtearing mode may also exist in weakly collisional plasmas in future high-temperature plasma confinement devices. The applicability of our result to the present and future experiments is discussed in Sec. 4.\nFigure 6 shows the typical eigen-functions of A\u0303\u2016 and \u03c6\u0303 in microtearing mode. To\ncompare the amplitudes of these functions, A\u0303\u2016 and \u03c6\u0303 are represented in the dimensions of the electric field, that is, \u03c9A\u0303\u2016 \u223c \u03c9\u2217eA\u0303\u2016 and k\u2016\u03c6\u0303, and normalized by T0e/(kyL2T0e|qe|). The red and blue lines represent real and imaginary parts, respectively. A\u0303\u2016 is an even function, and \u03c6\u0303 is an odd function, that is, tearing parity. The mode structure is localized around the singular point x/a = 0. The magnetic perturbation is clearly dominant, and the electrostatic potential is minor.\nThe current layer width is measured using the eigen-function j\u0303\u2016 shown in Fig. 7\n(left). j\u0303\u2016 is normalized by n0e|qe|vth,e/(kyLT0e). As shown in the figure, the current profile may exhibit multiple peaks. We define the current layer width \u03b4c as the central peak of |j\u0303\u2016| such that \u03b4c is given by the full width at half maximum height of |j\u0303\u2016| where the height is measured from the top to the first local minimum value. Figure 7 (right) shows the current layer width \u03b4c/a against \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e. The measured layer widths follow the scaling of \u03b4MT/a \u223c S\u22121/2 and represent theoretical predictions. Figure 8 shows the electron temperature gradient dependence of the microtearing mode eigen-frequencies for several electron beta values, \u03b2e = 0.024, 0.1, 1. The other\nparameters are the same as those in the most unstable case, with energy diffusion shown in Fig. 5 , that is, \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e = 1.56. The growth rates in the left figure monotonically increase with respect to \u03b7e. The mode is stable at \u03b7e = 0. The real frequencies in the right figure are always of the order of the diamagnetic drift frequency. Clearly, the plasma beta has no effect on this parameter regime. It is predicted that the eigenfrequency is independent of \u03b2e provided that \u03b30/\u03c9\u2217e is small because the time-dependent thermal force term is irrespective of \u03b2e (see (30)). We may expect that the level of microtearing turbulence in future higher-\u03b2 devices will be driven at the same level as that observed in the present tokamaks as long as the assumption, \u03b30/\u03c9\u2217e 1, is still holds.\nFinally, we investigate the effect of the velocity-dependent collision frequency by\nartificially switching off the velocity dependence. We perform a simulation for the same parameter set as the most unstable case in Fig. 5, but without the velocity dependence of the collision frequency, and obtain \u03c9/\u03c9\u2217e = 0.968\u2212 i0.0108. This result implies that the effect not included in the velocity-independent collision, which is the time-dependent thermal/inertia force, is the source of instability. In the next section, we show that the quantitative measurement of the coefficient \u03b1tt,i of the time-dependent thermal/inertia force allows us to explain the microtearing unstable regime against collisionality.\n3.2.2. Evaluation of the time-dependent thermal force We estimate the coefficient \u03b1tt,i of the time-dependent thermal/inertia force from the simulation results. At the singular point k\u2016(x) = 0, the parallel electric field is given solely by the inductive components,\nE\u0303\u2016 = i\u03c9A\u0303\u2016 = j\u0303\u2016/\u03c3\u2016. Using (25) for \u03c3\u2016, we obtain the following equation:\ni\u03b1t\u03c9\u2217T0eA\u0303\u2016 \u2212 \u03b1tt,i \u03c9\n\u03bdei \u03c9\u2217T0eA\u0303\u2016 = i\u03c9A\u0303\u2016 \u2212 (i(\u03c9\u2217n0e + \u03c9\u2217T0e)A\u0303\u2016 + \u03b7j\u0303\u2016), (33)\nwhere the LHS represents the electric field generated by the thermal forces and collisional inertia force. We assume that the coefficient of resistivity \u03b1\u03b7 = 0.380 is fixed. By substituting the complex-valued A\u0303\u2016, j\u0303\u2016, and \u03c9 obtained from the simulations in (33), the coefficients \u03b1t and \u03b1tt,i are uniquely determined.\nFigure 9 shows the measured coefficient \u03b1tt,i of the time-dependent thermal/inertia\nforce against the collision frequency \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e for different electron temperature gradient \u03b7e values. The coefficient \u03b1t of the thermal force is also plotted in Fig. 9. The red and blue symbols correspond to \u03b1tt,i and \u03b1t, respectively. Parameters other than the electron temperature gradient are chosen to be the same as those in the most unstable case with energy diffusion in Fig. 5. The coefficients \u03b1t and \u03b1tt,i should be constant with respect to the collision frequency in the collisional limit. However, the collisionfrequency dependence is clearly observed in Fig. 9. It is observed that, as the collision frequency increases, the coefficients tend to become constants. Referring to [19], the coefficients of the Lorentz collision operator are \u03b1t \u2248 0.8 and \u03b1tt,i \u2248 0.43, which are close to the obtained values. The coefficients \u03b1t and \u03b1tt,i do not depend on the electron temperature gradient and are uniquely determined for any given collision frequency. We find that the numerically obtained eigen-frequencies are consistent with the dispersion relation for the collisional microtearing mode (28) using these coefficients.\nThe behavior of microtearing instability is explained in terms of the time-dependent\nthermal/inertia force. In the collisional limit \u03bdei \u2192 \u221e, the coefficient \u03b1tt,i becomes constant. Because the time-dependent thermal/inertia force is proportional to \u03bd\u22121ei (see\n(30)), only the thermal force remains. In this limit, the simulation results demonstrate that the microtearing is stable (see Fig. 5). In the collisionless limit \u03bdei \u2192 0, it is clear that the time-dependent thermal/inertia force vanishes as the force is generated by electron\u2013ion collisions. The microtearing mode is also stable in this limit, as shown in Fig. 5. In the \u03bdei \u223c \u03c9\u2217e regime, the coefficient \u03b1tt,i depends on the collision frequency but is finite; therefore, it can lead to an unstable microtearing mode. It is uncertain at what collision regime the coefficient \u03b1tt,i vanishes, and the same is true for the existence of a collisional microtearing mode. This existence is subtle because the coefficient varies depending on the collision model. (Remember that energy diffusion, which is not considered in some theoretical models, strongly suppresses the growth of the mode.) The present result quantitatively demonstrates the existence of the microtearing mode unstable regime using a comprehensive collision model."

The black\nsymbols correspond to the total energy, the blue and red lines are the energies of the electrons and ions, respectively, and the magenta and green lines are the perpendicular and parallel magnetic-field energies, respectively. The yellow, red, and blue dashed lines correspond to the energy of the electrons associated with the density perturbation and parallel and perpendicular flows, respectively.

We found via preliminary analyses that the electron energy, which accounts for the majority of the energy, is not the energy associated with either the density perturbation or the parallel and perpendicular flow velocities and may be supported by the energy owing to the electron temperature perturbation. The further detailed analyses will be investigated in the future. During the process, the magnetic energy remains at a very low level and has little influence on the process. This result is in marked contrast to the magnetic reconnection process driven by the tearing mode presented in [35], where the initial magnetic energy is drastically released to heat plasmas. Unlike in the normal tearing mode, an explosive release of magnetic energy does not occur in the microtearing mode. We conclude that the microtearing and normal tearing modes are completely different processes, as indicated by their driving mechanisms."

            "text": "In this papar, we have presented theoretical and numerical studies on the destabilization mechanism of the collisional microtearing mode.\nWe have reviewed linear theoretical analyses in a slab geometry based on Hassam\u2019s\nfluid equations and have shown that the essential destabilizing mechanism of the mode is the phase lag of the inductive electric field behind the perturbed magnetic field. The lag is induced by the time-dependent thermal force and/or collisional inertia force. Because it is not magnetically driven, a similar instability exists even without magnetic shear (the so-called self-filamentation mode).\nWe have perfomed linear gyrokinetic simulations using AstroGK code to investigate\nthe fundamental properties of the microtearing mode. The microtearing mode becomes unstable in the regime where \u03bdei \u223c \u03c9\u2217e and is stable in collisionless and collisional limits. By quantitatively estimating the coefficients of the time-dependent thermal/inertia force, we have obtained the dispersion relation of the microtearing mode, which agrees well with the theoretical prediction. The unstable regime is identified as 0.01 < \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e < 1.\nWe infer the implications of our results to the present and future experiments.\nWe refer to the experimental data on the NSTX device. According to Table 1 in [36],\nat r/r0 = 0.5 (r and r0 are the radial coordinate and minor radius of the device, respectively), the collision frequency normalized by the diamagnetic frequency \u03bdexei /\u03c9\u2217e is estimated as \u03bdexei /\u03c9\u2217e \u2248 0.878. The poloidal wavenumber k\u03b8\u03c1s = 0.6 is used, which can dominantly drive microtearing instability. Using the electron temperature of ITER shown in [37] to estimate the collision frequency, \u03bdei/\u03c9\u2217e \u2248 0.0281 because of \u03bdei \u221d T\u22123/2e . Our result in Fig. 5 indicates that ITER and NSTX experiments are in an unstable regime. It has been also shown that the collisional microtearing mode is independent of \u03b2. We expect the same level of instability in future higher-\u03b2 devices. Note that \u03b2 dependence of collisionless microtearing modes driven by other mechanisms, such as trapped particles are debatable.\nWe have also presented a nonlinear simulation result showing the energy evolution\nfor the microtearing mode. Although the energy associated with the electron temperature perturbation may be dominant in the microtearing mode, the detailed analyses are left behind as the future works. No explosive magnetic energy release is observed.\nThe collisionless microtearing mode is not observed in the present study. We have\nderived a condition for stabilization of the microtearing mode in the collisionless regime although it is not a proof of non-existence of the collisionless microtearing mode (see (32)). Careful investigation of the existence of unstable modes in the purely collisionless regime remains as future work.\nAs discussed in this paper, phase lag is essential for the destabilization of the\nmicrotearing mode, similar to the destabilization of electrostatic drift waves. The instability can be discussed in terms of the mechanism leading to the phase lag. In toroidal geometry, trapped particles may provide a phase lag and lead to instability in the collisionless regime. The stability of the collisionless electromagnetic tearing-parity ETG mode is also an important issue although it is not discussed in this work. As shown in [23], the electron finite Larmor radius (FLR) effect is a key component, which is not considered in our present simulation. The relationship between the destabilization mechanism of the microtearing mode and the collisionless electromagnetic tearing-parity ETG mode may be discussed elsewhere."
