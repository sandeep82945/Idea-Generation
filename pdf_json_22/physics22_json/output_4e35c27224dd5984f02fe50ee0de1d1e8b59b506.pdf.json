Assuming an initially correlated Gaussian random field and spectral index 0 < ns < 1, we derive the small-scale asymptotic behaviour of the initial momentum-momentum correlations. This result is then used to derive the asymptotics of the power spectrum in the Zel\u2019dovich approximation. Our main result is an asymptotic series, dominated by a k\u22123 tail at large wave-numbers, containing higher-order terms that differ by integer powers of kns\u22121 and logarithms of k . Furthermore, we show that dark matter power spectra with an ultraviolet cut-off develop an intermediate range of scales where the power spectrum is accurately described by the asymptotics of dark matter without a cut-off. These results reveal information about the mathematical structure that underlies the perturbative terms in kinetic field theory and thus the non-linear power spectrum. We also discuss the sensitivity of the small-scale asymptotics to the spectral index ns .",

            "text": "The Zel\u2019dovich approximation (Zel\u2019dovich 1970) is ubiquitous in the theory of structure formation (see White 2014 for a relatively recent review), as a key analytic approximation that encapsulates many of the physical effects pertinent to structure formation. One of its many advantages is that it allows for the derivation of a simple formula for the two-point correlation function (Schneider & Bartelmann 1995; Taylor & Hamilton 1996), and thus the power spectrum. While the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum accurately describes structures on linear scales, it is a non-linear power spectrum since it is a non-linear functional of the initial power spectrum. In kinetic field theory (hereafter KFT), the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum plays an important role and is key to the full non-linear power spectrum (Bartelmann et al. 2017, 2019; Bartelmann et al. 2021; Konrad & Bartelmann 2022). It represents the leading order power spectrum of perturbation theory and additionally is the starting point of a mean-field theory within KFT, which is an alternative way to incorporate those particle interactions that are not already captured by the Zel\u2019dovich approximation (Bartelmann et al. 2021). To derive the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum from KFT, three ingredients are necessary: (i) the specification of the initial conditions in classical phase-space, (ii) the assumption of straight particle trajectories1 that contain parts of the gravitational interactions and (iii) the expanding space-time as background (Bartelmann et al. 2016; Bartelmann et al. 2017). We consider Gaussian initial conditions, implying that two-point correlation functions are sufficient to completely determine the initial probability distribution in phase space. We assume that initial momenta are correlated, while initial density-density and density-momentum correlations are neglected. This is reasonable on large scales and at late times, as they grow much more slowly than the initial momentummomentum correlations. The initial velocity field can be considered to be curl-free, such that it can be expressed in terms of a gradient of a velocity potential \ud835\udf13. Since the continuity equation has to hold initially, the initial density contrast has to satisfy Poisson\u2019s equation\n\ud835\udeff (i) = \u2212\u22072\ud835\udf13 . (1)\n(All the constants that might appear are absorbed into \ud835\udf13 here.) Consequently, the initial velocity potential power spectrum is related to the initial density fluctuation power spectrum via \ud835\udc43 (i) \ud835\udf13 (\ud835\udc58) = \ud835\udc58\u22124 \ud835\udc43 (i) \ud835\udeff (\ud835\udc58) . (2)\n\u2605 fz002@uni-heidelberg.de \u2020 ginat@campus.technion.ac.il 1 They are inertial if time is transformed to a specific non-linear function of itself.\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n08 05\n9v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n5 M\nay 2\nThe initial momentum-momentum correlation matrix of two particles separated by q is then given by ?\u0302?\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d (q) = \u222b \ud835\udc58\u2032 ( k\u2032 \u2297 k\u2032 ) \ud835\udc43 (i) \ud835\udf13 (\ud835\udc58 \u2032) eik \u2032 \u00b7q . (3) The ansatz that the particle trajectories are straight is key to the Zel\u2019dovich approximation. In KFT, this ansatz is expressed by splitting up the actual time dependent trajectory of a particle into the Zel\u2019dovich part qZ (\ud835\udc61), that is linear in the initial phase space coordinates q(\ud835\udc56) , p(i) , and an interaction part qI (\ud835\udc61) that contains all the remaining interactions that are not captured by the Zel\u2019dovich approximation, q(\ud835\udc61) = q(\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udc54Z\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56) )p(\ud835\udc56) + q\ud835\udc3c (\ud835\udc61) \u2261 qZ (\ud835\udc61) + qI (\ud835\udc61) , (4) where \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56) ) is the so-called propagator. Considering only q\ud835\udc4d (\ud835\udc61) and identifying \ud835\udc54Z\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56) ) \u2261 \ud835\udc37+ (\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc37+ (\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56) ) with the linear growth factor \ud835\udc37+, yields the Zel\u2019dovich approximation. In the following, we define the initial time \ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc56) = 0 and then replace in our notation the propagator \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc61, 0) by \ud835\udc61. This not only simplifies the notation but also highlights that the propagator serves as a time coordinate. We emphasise that Eq. (4) is exact. When these assumptions are combined, the unperturbed zeroth-order power spectrum of KFT is equivalent to the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum and is given by\nP(\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc61) = e\u2212\ud835\udc44 \u222b d3\ud835\udc5e ( e\ud835\udc61 2 k>?\u0302?\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d (q)k \u2212 1 ) eik\u00b7q , (5)\nas shown in Bartelmann et al. (2016); Bartelmann et al. (2017). The exponent \ud835\udc44 is\n\ud835\udc44 = \ud835\udf0e21 3 \ud835\udc582 \ud835\udc612 , (6) where \ud835\udf0e21 is one of the moments \ud835\udf0e2\ud835\udc5b = 1 2\ud835\udf0b2 \u222b \u221e 0 d\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc582\ud835\udc5b+2 \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udf13 (\ud835\udc58) (7) of the power spectrum \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udf13 of the initial velocity potential \ud835\udf13. It is important for the present derivation of our results that \ud835\udf0e2 is finite, which is the case for 0 < \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 < 1, but higher moments are allowed to be infinite. We emphasise that nothing in this paper relies on features peculiar to KFT \u2013 indeed, all that we assume is that the power spectrum in the Zel\u2019dovich approximation is given by (5), which can be reached from, e.g., Lagrangian perturbation theory, too (Taylor & Hamilton 1996). The small-scale limit of the power spectrum is of interest to cosmologists for many reasons: it can be used to study the behaviour of dark matter inside haloes (Ma & Fry 2000), and thereby to gain some understanding on their universal density profile (see, e.g., Wang et al. 2020). Besides, the rate of decay of the power spectrum with \ud835\udc58 at large \ud835\udc58 influences the degree of relativistic gravitational back-reaction (see, e.g., Adamek et al. 2018; Ginat 2021). Another reason for investigating the power spectrum on small scales is that, through the time dependence of the asymptotic expansion, it might shed light on the process of virialisation in gravitational collapse (Peebles 1980). Even though we are deriving results here for ensembles of classical particles following Zel\u2019dovich trajectories in an expanding background space-time, we should like to emphasise that our results are applicable without change also to static space-time and inertial trajectories in a different time coordinate. Our essential assumptions are that initial phase-space coordinates sample a Gaussian random field whose power spectrum satisfies some fairly general properties. Our results should therefore extend to wide classes of classical particles streaming freely from Gaussian initial conditions. Konrad & Bartelmann (2021) proved that (5) may be expanded as\nP(\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc61) \u223c \u221e\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc5a=0\nP (\ud835\udc5a) (\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc583+2\ud835\udc5a , (8)\nfor \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e, where the time dependent coefficients P (\ud835\udc5a) depend on the initial power spectrum only through \ud835\udf0e2\ud835\udc5b for \ud835\udc5b \u2264 \ud835\udc5a, and they derived explicit expressions for these coefficients. Chen& Pietroni (2020) also derived a similar expansion, based on a Lagrangian view-point. However, these results relied on the assumption that all the moments (7) are finite, which implies that if one assumes dispersion free cold dark matter, where the initial power spectrum has a flat tail, one needs to introduce a regulator which then affects all results. In this work, we derive the asymptotic behaviour for cold dark matter power spectra, without introducing a regulator, which leads to markedly different results. We do so by applying theMellin transform technique of asymptotic expansions, which consists of computing theMellin transform, continuing it analytically to the entirety of the complex plane (except for various possible poles), and then using this analytic continuation, together with Gauss\u2019 residue theorem to compute the inverse Mellin transform by shifting the contour of integration (see, e.g. Chapter 4 of Bleistein & Handelsman 1986 or Appendix A of Hughes 1995). This technique has been applied before in various works in astrophysical contexts (e.g., Touma & Tremaine 1997; Ginat et al. 2020, to which we refer the readers for pedagogical utilisations). Its great advantage over other expansion techniques is that it produces, automatically, the correct expansion functions, even non-analytic ones: it can handle non-integer powers in a power-series, logarithms, etc. For completeness, we summarise the relevant theorem in Appendix A. This paper is structured as follows: we start by deriving the asymptotic expansions of the initial momentum correlation matrix ?\u0302?\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d both at small and large \ud835\udc5e in \u00a72. We then use these results in conjunction with the Mellin transform technique in \u00a73 to expand (5) at large values of \ud835\udc58 , without assuming an ultraviolet cut-off on the initial power spectrum. In \u00a74 we specialise the expansion to late times (we define what \u2018late\u2019 means there), where some simplifications are possible. We then study the time-dependence of the expansion coefficients in \u00a75, and summarise in \u00a76.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)"

We use the Planck 2016 cosmological parameters (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), as given in Tab. 1. We stress that all results presented here are independent of the explicit choice of a transfer function for the initial power spectrum. The only important features are the asymptotics at small scales, i.e. at \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e, that has to agree with the general form specified in (15) below; and that 0 < \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 < 1. To derive an asymptotic expansion, it is best to move from distances \ud835\udc5e to a dimension-less variable \ud835\udc65, defined by \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 , where\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc58eq \ud835\udc501 , (14) and switch from wave numbers \ud835\udc58 to the dimension-less quantity \ud835\udf05 = \ud835\udc58/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 . This effectively re-scales \ud835\udc501,...,7 \u21a6\u2192 \ud835\udc501,...,7 \u2261 \ud835\udc501,...,7/\ud835\udc501, which is what we shall do below. Likewise, we define \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udf05) in the same way as \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc37 , but with \ud835\udc501,...,7 instead of \ud835\udc501,...,7. The initial power spectrum \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56)\n\ud835\udeff is taken to have an asymptotic expansion as \ud835\udf05 \u2261 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 \u2192 \u221e that reads\n\ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udeff\n\u223c \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\u22124 \u221e\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc5a=0 \ud835\udf05\u2212\ud835\udc5a 2\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=0 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5b ln\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf05 .

The sum of both orders (light blue lines) describes the small scale asymptotics of \ud835\udc4e1,2 very well up to Mpc scales. Let us recall here, that our results (17) and (18) are only valid for \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 < 1. In the limit \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 \u2192 1, the analytical continuation ofM [ \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udeff ; 3 ] , i.e. the second moment of the initial velocity potential power spectrum, diverges (see Fig. 2). Thus, for \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 = 1, the resulting\nseries contain terms with even powers of \ud835\udc5e and logarithms of higher order than 2 due to coinciding poles ofM [ \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udeff ; \ud835\udc67 ] andM [ \ud835\udc571,2; \ud835\udc67 ] .

            "text": "The small-scale asymptotics of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum as \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e are determined by the saddle points of the exponent of the integrand in (5). The saddle point, that dominates the \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e asymptotics of the integral, is located at the origin \ud835\udc5e \u2192 0+. To prove this claim, let us now show that any potential saddle point of the form \ud835\udc5e = ord ( \ud835\udc58\ud835\udefd ) , where \ud835\udefd > 0, gives an exponentially-decreasing\ncontribution to P(\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc61). As \ud835\udc5e \u2192 \u221e, the Mellin-transform technique may be used to show that \ud835\udc4e1,2 \u223c \ud835\udc5e\u22121\u2212\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 . (The explicit expression for the large-scale asymptotics of \ud835\udc4e1,2 is shown in Appendix B2.) This result implies that for any saddle point where lim\n\ud835\udc58\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5e = \u221e, we have\n?\u0302?\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udc5c(1), and therefore that the exponential, \ud835\udc612\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc56 (?\u0302?\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc57 \u2212\ud835\udc44 , (22) with \ud835\udc44 \u223c \ud835\udc582 from (6) is dominated by \u2212\ud835\udc44 in the large-\ud835\udc58 limit. That is, the contribution to P from such a saddle point is proportional to the exponentially-decaying factor\nexp [ \u2212\ud835\udc582 \ud835\udf0e21 \ud835\udc61 2\n3 + \ud835\udc5c\n( \ud835\udc582 )] . (23)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nIn a similar fashion, when \ud835\udefd = 0 and \ud835\udc5e \u2260 0 (i.e. \ud835\udc5e has a constant finite value), \ud835\udc61 2\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 (?\u0302?\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc57\u2212\ud835\udc44\n\ud835\udc582 is a negative, order unity quantity, and thus\ngives rise to an exponentially-decaying contribution. Consequently, if a saddle point exists with \ud835\udefd < 0, i.e. at \ud835\udc5e \u2192 0+, and if this saddle point yields a contribution that decays more slowly than exponentially, then it does dominate over all other saddle points with \ud835\udefd \u2265 0. We are now in a position to evaluate the dominant contribution to the power spectrum, by inserting (17) and (18) into (9) and (5), and integrating over \ud835\udc5e.

(20) and (21). Equation (29) is the main result of this paper: it shows the full dependence of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum on \ud835\udc58 , for large values of \ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 ,\nup to corrections of order \ud835\udc58\u22125 (for the Dicus transfer function), which are in principle calculable using the Mellin transform technique. Here, as opposed to earlier works (Konrad & Bartelmann 2021; Chen & Pietroni 2020), higher moments of the initial power spectrum need not be finite. There, a UV cutoff of the initial power spectrum had to be introduced. In its presence, a full asymptotic expansion for \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e is given by (8). Without a UV cutoff in the initial power spectrum, the asymptotics of the evolved Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum is instead given by (29) up to O ( \ud835\udc58\u22125 ) . With a UV cutoff, (29) reduces to the single non-vanishing term with \ud835\udc5a = 0, expressing the leading-order \ud835\udc58\u22123 asymptotics of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum. We emphasize that terms with \ud835\udc5a > 0 are not only negligible, but strictly absent in presence of a UV cutoff since they only appear due to the poles of the Mellin transform of the initial power spectrum. Our result (29) also shows why terms beyond the order \ud835\udc58\u22123 are necessary to describe the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum on cosmologically relevant scales: the weak increase of logarithms in the numerator almost precisely cancels the weak increase of \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a(1\u2212\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60) (for realistic \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60) in the denominator. The relevance of high orders can be seen in Fig. 4, which shows the asymptotic series up to a maximum value of \ud835\udc5a \u2264 \ud835\udc40 , for various \ud835\udc40 . This maximum value \ud835\udc40 is chosen such that contributions way beyond order \ud835\udc58\u22125 are considered, indicating that the missing O(\ud835\udc585)-terms in (29) are less relevant; see also Appendix C.

            "text": "If dark matter is made of massive fermions, then the initial power spectrum does not decay like \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\u22124 log2 \ud835\udc58 . It may rather have a cutoff, determined by the particle mass and the particle production mechanism, which is related to the type(s) of interaction the particle undergoes (Green et al. 2004). The ultraviolet cut-off \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 is also typically related to a temperature of dark matter. In this section, we discuss two aspects of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum that are related to the physically relevant scenario of dark matter with a finite temperature. Konrad & Bartelmann (2021) have shown that the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum for large \ud835\udc58 can be expanded in a series with terms of order \ud835\udc58\u22123\u22122\ud835\udc5a, when\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nthe initial power spectrum has a cut-off and all moments of the initial velocity potential power spectrum exist. The first two coefficients in the series (8) are given by\nP (0) (\ud835\udc61) = 3(4\ud835\udf0b)3/2 ( 5 2\ud835\udf0f22 )3/2 e \u2212 5 2\ud835\udf0f22 ,\nP (1) (\ud835\udc61) = (4\ud835\udf0b) 3/2 28 \ud835\udf0e23 \ud835\udf0e22 ( 5 2\ud835\udf0f22 )5/2 e \u2212 5 2\ud835\udf0f22 123 \u2212 132 ( 5 2\ud835\udf0f22 ) + 20 ( 5 2\ud835\udf0f22 )2 , (37) where P(\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc61) \u223c P (0) (\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc58\u22123 +P (1) (\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc58\u22125 as \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e. While the first term describes the asymptotic \ud835\udc58\u22123 tail very well, the intersection with the\nsecond term, of order \ud835\udc58\u22125, engenders a time-dependent scale \ud835\udc58asymp = \u221a\ufe02 P (0)P (1) , below which the asymptotics fail to reproduce the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum. Thus, an analytical description of the latter between this scale and the linear regime was missing. In Fig. 5 we show the dimension-less Zel\u2019dovich power spectra of strictly cold dark matter without an initial ultraviolet cut-off, i.e. when dark matter is treated as a non-relativistic Vlasov fluid at all scales (purple line), at redshift \ud835\udc67 = 0, together with those of three types of warm dark matter, where the initial (linear) power spectrum is exponentially cut off at a scale \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 = {102, 104, 106} Mpc\u22121 by a multiplicative Gaussian exp(\u2212\ud835\udc582/\ud835\udc582\n\ud835\udc37 ) (yellow, blue and green line, respectively). The latter corresponds to a power spectrum of WIMP dark matter with particle mass\nof \u223c 100 GeV (Green et al. 2004). For small and intermediate wave numbers, the Zel\u2019dovich power spectra align with the spectrum of the strictly cold dark matter. At large wave numbers, the spectra become flat, reaching the \ud835\udc58\u22123 asymptotics (coloured dashed lines). The wave number where the spectra with finite initial temperature deviate from the strictly cold dark matter spectrum is in all shown cases indicated very well by the intersection of the \ud835\udc58\u22123 (coloured dashed lines) and the \ud835\udc58\u22125 (dotted dashed lines) asymptotics. In case of the WIMP dark matter, the wave number regime just below validity of the \ud835\udc58\u22123 asymptotics, i.e. below 104 Mpc\u22121, is now very well described by the asymptotics of the strictly cold dark matter (thick dashed dark blue line) that we derived in this paper up to order \ud835\udc40 = 1000. This is remarkable, since the latter contains information about the asymptotic tail of the initial power spectrum, that is actually cut-off for WIMP dark matter, but ultimately originates from the fact that \ud835\udf0e23 /\ud835\udc58 4 \ud835\udc60 M[\ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udeff ; 5]\n, where the former is computed with a cut-off, and the latter \u2013 without one. It may be surprising, prima facie that the asymptotic tails of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectra with initial ultraviolet cut-off have a higher amplitude at redshift \ud835\udc67 = 0 the stronger the ultraviolet cut-off is, i.e. the smaller \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 . The reason for this is that the time evolution of the asymptotic amplitude P (0) , (37), depends on the product \ud835\udf0e22 \ud835\udc61\n2. This implies that smaller values of \ud835\udf0e2 lead to a slower evolution of the asymptotic tail. Since at redshift \ud835\udc67 = 0, all of these amplitudes are decreasing in time due to re-expansion, the spectra with larger \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 , i.e. larger \ud835\udf0e22 already progressed further in re-expansion. The time evolution of the amplitude is discussed in detail in Konrad & Bartelmann (2021)."

            "heading": "6 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this paper we derived an asymptotic expansion for the cold dark matter power spectrum in the Zel\u2019dovich approximation, at large wave numbers \ud835\udc58 , by using the Mellin transform technique; the result, Eq. (29), shows that in addition to the expected \ud835\udc58\u22123, \ud835\udc58\u22125, etc. terms, there are terms that go like negative integer powers \ud835\udc581\u2212\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 , accompanied by positive powers of log \ud835\udc58 . These are a sine qua non in any practical use of asymptotic expansions of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum, since only by going to high order, can a reasonable accuracy be achieved (see Fig. 4). This differs from the case where the power spectrum contains an ultraviolet cut-off, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 (Konrad & Bartelmann 2021). In this case, there exists a cut-off and time dependent wave number \ud835\udc58asymp above which the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum aligns with the \ud835\udc58\u22123 asymptotics. However if \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 , there is an intermediate regime, where \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58asymp. There, physically, the cut-off should have no effect, and for these values of \ud835\udc58 , we indeed see in Fig. 5 that P(\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc61) follows (29), rather than the asymptotic expansion of Konrad & Bartelmann (2021); Chen & Pietroni (2020). This already means that for such \ud835\udc58 one should not use the expansion with a cut-off, but rather treat the cut-off as non-existent. The applicability of an expansion without a cut-off, well below the cut-off in asymptotic expansions is known to exist elsewhere in cosmology, e.g. in the distribution of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background (Ginat et al. 2020). We therefore have shown that (29) is valid even for realistic models of dark matter, which do include some ultraviolet cut-off, as long as one considers scales below \ud835\udc58asymp. We therefore conclude that for Zel\u2019dovich power spectra of dark matter with an initial ultraviolet cut-off, the \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e asymptotics are correctly described by the result of Konrad & Bartelmann (2021), (8), rather than (29). This is because the \ud835\udc5a > 0 terms in (29) appear only due to the poles of the Mellin transform of the initial power spectrum when no initial ultraviolet cut-off is imposed. For some intermediate regime of finite values of \ud835\udc58 , however, at wave numbers below which the series (8) fails to reproduce the warm dark matter Zel\u2019dovich power spectra, warm dark matter and stricly cold dark matter spectra align and the warm dark matter spectra can be described by the asymptotics of the cold dark matter spectra (29) derived in this work. We suspect that the mathematical reason for this is that there might exist an expansion for the warm dark matter spectra in the \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e limit for which the \ud835\udc5a > 0 terms do not vanish strictly, but are suppressed by an \ud835\udc42 (\ud835\udc58\u2212\u221e function (i.e. one that falls off more steeply than any power law), with the suppression controlled by the cut-off scale \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc37 . Since such terms would be non-perturbative, they would not appear in the asymptotic expansion (8). In between those two regimes, i.e. at wave numbers of about \ud835\udc58asymp, the warm dark matter power spectrum follows some interpolation of the two asymptotic expressions. It will be subject to future work to investigate the connection between those two expansions and to formally derive the correct interpolation.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nWhile one has to include many terms in the series (29) for it to be accurate, knowing the functional form of the \ud835\udc58-dependence of the power spectrum is of theoretical significance in itself. Evaluating the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum can be achieved by solving the integral (5) numerically. This expansion will help to find out more about the mathematical structure of the Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum in general; we anticipate that once this series is known, in the future one would be able to re-sum it to arrive at more accurate results without needing to go to very high orders. The Zel\u2019dovich power spectrum resembles the zeroth order power spectrum of KFT and is a fundamental building-block of perturbative terms; the result of this paper will therefore guide future work on KFT perturbation theory and thereby on analytical expressions for the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, and put them on mathematically solid ground. Here, we have approximated particle trajectories by straight lines. Due to this Zel\u2019dovich approximation, virialization is not expected to occur. However, virialization is an emergent effect in KFT and thus need not be introduced explicitly. Incorporating gravitational interactions beyond the Zel\u2019dovich approximation will lead to more persistent structures on small scales, since gravity prevents the structures formed in the Zel\u2019dovich approximation from re-expanding. Nonetheless, we have convincing reasons to believe that the shape of the asymptotics will not be changed even by interactions: Taking them into account in a mean-field approximation, we could show that the multiplicative interaction term becomes scale-independent for large \ud835\udc58 (Bartelmann et al. 2021; Konrad & Bartelmann 2022). Then, the amplitude of the power spectrum will increase, but the shape will remain unchanged. The analytical result based on the mean-field approximation recovers fully numerical results for non-linear power spectra to an accuracy of a few percent up to wave numbers \ud835\udc58 . 10 \u210eMpc\u22121. In future work we will extend the present calculation beyond the Zel\u2019dovich approximation, and endeavour to find an asymptotic series of the form (29) for the full cold dark-matter power spectrum. We did not consider baryonic effects either here, but dark matter only as a back-bone for cosmic structure formation. This is of particular cosmological interest because the question as to which small-scale structures in (warm and cold) dark-matter only universes form is not completely solved yet, e.g. in the notorious \u201ccore-cusp\u201d problem (Genina et al. 2018). While baryonic effects are certain to change the smallscale structures built from dark matter, it is yet unclear which small-scale structures actually arise in dark-matter only universes, as numerical simulations are limited in resolution. We are convinced that this is an important question to solve, prior to incorporating any baryonic effects. Moreover, as is visible from Fig. 2, the coefficients P\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61, ln \ud835\udc58) (or P\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc61)) are extremely sensitive to the spectral index \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 . We believe that the primordial \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 may leave an imprint on cosmic structure formation at early times. Since the cooling time of the baryonic matter is finite, the formation of dense baryonic structures is expected to set in later than small-scale structures form by stream-crossing in cold dark matter.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nThese small-scale, cold dark-matter structures will in turn influence the mass and time scales of baryonic structure formation. These different time scales might themselves be reflected in observables related to reionization or the recombination epoch. It is thus quite possible that the primordial \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 may be related to observables of cosmic structure formation. It will be the subject of future work to investigate these time scales and predict observables, with initial conditions for our theory set during the matter-dominated era. In future surveys, if they could be inferred experimentally, they could furnish an additional probe of this cosmological parameter."

Finally, let us remark that for \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 < 1, Stirling\u2019s approximation for \ud835\udc5a! implies that the series (27) diverges very slowly, for fixed \ud835\udc58 , but is of course still asymptotic as \ud835\udc58 \u2192 \u221e.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)"
