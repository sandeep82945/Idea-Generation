1. **Investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on cognitive function in healthy adults.** Previous studies have shown that betaine can improve cognitive function in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is not known whether betaine has similar effects in healthy adults. A clinical trial could be conducted to investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on cognitive function in healthy adults. The trial could measure changes in cognitive function using a variety of tests, such as memory tests, attention tests, and problem-solving tests.


2. **Examine the effects of betaine supplementation on exercise performance in athletes.** Some studies have shown that betaine can improve exercise performance in athletes. However, the results of these studies have been mixed. A well-designed clinical trial could be conducted to investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on exercise performance in athletes. The trial could measure changes in exercise performance using a variety of tests, such as time to exhaustion tests, Wingate tests, and VO2 max tests.


3. **Explore the potential of betaine as a treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).** NAFLD is a common liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Betaine has been shown to have beneficial effects on liver health in animal models of NAFLD. A clinical trial could be conducted to investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on NAFLD in humans. The trial could measure changes in liver function using a variety of tests, such as liver enzyme tests, liver biopsy, and imaging tests.


4. **Investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).** CKD is a common kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure. Betaine has been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney function in animal models of CKD. A clinical trial could be conducted to investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on kidney function in patients with CKD. The trial could measure changes in kidney function using a variety of tests, such as blood creatinine tests, urine protein tests, and imaging tests.


5. **Examine the potential of betaine as a treatment for cancer.** Some studies have shown that betaine can inhibit the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. However, it is not known whether betaine has similar effects in humans. A clinical trial could be conducted to investigate the effects of betaine supplementation on cancer in humans. The trial could measure changes in tumor size and growth using a variety of tests, such as imaging tests and tumor marker tests.
