    "abstractText": "Lately, a new class of nanofluids, namely hybrid nanofluids, has been introduced that performs much better compared with the nanofluids when a healthier heat transfer rate is the objective of the study. Heading in the same direction, the present investigation accentuates the unsteady hybrid nanofluid flow involving CuO, Al2O3/C2H6O2 achieved by an oscillating disk immersed in the porous media. In a study of the homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, the surface catalyzed reaction was also considered to minimize the reaction time. The shape factors of the nanoparticles were also taken into account, as these play a vital role in assessing the thermal conductivity and heat transfer rate of the system. The assumed model is presented mathematically in the form of partial differential equations. The system is transformed by invoking special similarity transformations. The Keller Box scheme was used to obtain numerical and graphical results. It is inferred that the blade-shaped nanoparticles have the best thermal conductivity that boosts the heat transfer efficiency. The oscillation and surface-catalyzed chemical reactions have opposite impacts on the concentration profile. This analysis also includes a comparison of the proposed model with a published result in a limiting case to check the authenticity of the presented model.",

Introduction\nThe importance of base fluids (orthodox liquids) for thermal transfer in industrial processes cannot be denied. Generally, these liquids possess poor heat transferability. To overcome this barrier, nano-sized (<100 nm) particles are added to improve the thermal transport capability. This idea was initially pitched by Choi and Eastman [1]. Generally, it is an accepted truth that solid particles have higher thermal heat conduction when compared with liquids. Thus, the inclusion of nano-sized particles in customary fluids improved their thermal conduction comprehensively. These solid particles are identified as nanoparticles. The amalgamation of the base fluid and the nanoparticles is termed a nanofluid. Eastman [2], in an experimental work, claimed that the addition of a small amount of nano-sized solid material particles can improve the thermal conduction of conventional liquids. The conclusion of this study revealed that the thermal performance of ethylene glycol (the base fluid) was improved by 40\u201350% after the addition of copper nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at <1% (volume fraction). This is because nanofluids have a pivoting role in electro-mechanical gadgets, heat exchange, advanced\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1794. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12111794 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1794 2 of 15\ncooling systems, etc. A good number of experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted with various combinations of the nanoparticles and base fluids [3\u201312]. Lately, an advanced form of nanofluids has been introduced, namely hybrid nanofluids. The hybrid nanofluids comprise an orthodox liquid and two or more kinds of nanoparticles. Hybrid nanofluids are more efficient than customary nanofluids as far as heat transport is concerned. The synthesis of a hybrid nanofluid comprising Al2O3-Cu/water using a two-step method was conducted experimentally by Suresh et al. [13]. The study revealed an enhancement of 12.11% in thermal conduction for a 2% volume fraction. Madhesh et al. [14] experimentally discussed a copper\u2013titania hybrid nanofluid and copper\u2013titania hybrid nanocomposite flows with volume concentrations of 0.1\u20132.0%. The results divulged that the rate of heat flux is improved by 49% for a volume fraction of up to 1%. An experiment was conducted by Toghraie et al. [15] on the synthesis of a ZnO\u2013TiO2/EG hybrid nanofluid to demonstrate the impacts of the nanoparticles\u2019 concentration and temperature on the hybrid nanofluid\u2019s conduction. The outcome was interesting, revealing that the thermal conduction was 32% for a volume fraction of 3.5% at 50 \u25e6C. Parallel to these experimental works, researchers have also focused on theoretical studies focusing on hybrid nanofluid flows. Gul et al. [16] conducted a comparative study of Hamilton\u2013Crosser, and Yamada\u2013 Ota hybrid nanofluid models containing titanium oxide and silicon carbide nanoparticles added into diathermic oil. The hybrid nanofluid was taken through stimulation with a magnetic dipole and the flow was assumed over an extended surface. The salient outcome revealed that the Yamada\u2013Ota model was far better in terms of heat transfer performance than the Hamilton\u2013Crosser hybrid nanofluid flow model. Water-based ternary hybrid nanofluid flows with numerous nanoparticle shapes including spheres, cylinders, and platelets of aluminum oxide, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, respectively, between two parallel sheets, were examined theoretically by Arif et al. [17]. An enhancement in thermal heat transfer of 33.67% was observed for the ternary hybrid nanofluid flow when compared with the unitary nanofluid flow. Recent studies featuring hybrid nanofluid flow in various scenarios may be observed in [18\u201322]. The problems related to fluid flow over rotating disks are among the well-known active research topics owing to their applicability in many engineering applications encompassing hard disks, jet motors, turbine systems, etc. This is why the subject of rotating flow has gained massive attention and has been welcomed by researchers [23\u201328]. Studies associated with chemical reactions attract the interest of researchers due to their importance in various physical and chemical processes. The molecular diffusion of species in such processes, whether inside or on the surface, cannot be overlooked. Many chemical, biological, and physical processes involve chemical reactions. Therefore, to study these reacting systems, the study of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions is essential. The presence of a catalyst is essential for a reaction to proceed at a better speed. A reaction occurring on the surface of absorbent media is also a type of heterogeneous reaction and is known as a surface-catalyzed chemical reaction [29]. Elattar et al. [30] computed the hybrid nanofluid flow with Hall current over a slender surface. Recent work focused on chemical reactions may be found in [31\u201333]. The published literature and referenced publications demonstrate a plethora of investigations focusing on nanofluid flows. Nonetheless, there are only a few studies that have shown a comparison of hybrid flows over a variety of geometries. The current study is innovative in several ways: Firstly, the flow over a fluctuating rotating disk was combined with homogeneous\u2013heterogeneous reactions and surface-catalyzed chemical reaction. Secondly, the heat transfer rate was studied, considering the numerous shapes. Thirdly, porous media were incorporated for surface catalysis. To solve the problem, various numerical techniques have been used by various researchers [34\u201338]. The numerical results were tabulated by using the Keller Box scheme, and the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles were sketched graphically. Finally, the numerical solution included a validation table to ensure the validity of the proposed model. This research intended to provide answers to the following essential questions:\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1794 3 of 15\n\u2022 Which is the best nanoparticle shape to manufacture a hybrid nanofluid? \u2022 Does a fluctuating rotating disk influence the reaction rate? \u2022 Do the Wall temperature and disk fluctuation both affect the heat transfer rate? \u2022 Is there a significant impact of the surface catalyzed reaction on the rate of reaction? \u2022 Is the axial velocity profile affected by variations in the volume fraction?\n2.

With \u03c62 = 0.07, the blade-shaped nanoparticles would give the best thermal conductivity as compared with the other shapes. Figure 4 delineates the heat transfer analysis by taking different values for the volume fraction of Al2O3 and considering various nanoparticle shapes. The results obtained were found to have a good correlation with Figure 2. The blade-shaped Al2O3 with \u03c61 = 0.05, \u03c62 = 0.07 (the volume fraction of CuO) had a higher heat transfer rate. As the Nusselt number is the fraction of the convective heat transfer and the conductive heat transfer, the blade-shaped particles would have the maximum heat transfer rate. However, the heat transfer rate was minimum for the spherical particles.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 17\n4.1.

Concentration Profile Versus Varying Parameters Figure 7 shows the concentration profile with fluctuations in the surface catalysis and disk parameter. It is noticed that the surface catalysis parameter boosts the reaction rate, causing the concentration profile to decline, while the oscillating disk parameter inhibits the reaction rate at the same rate. Therefore, the concentration profile is increased through contraction and relaxation of the disk.\nFigure 7 shows the concentration profile with fluctuations in the surface catalysis and disk parameter.

Numerical Results for Drag Force and the Heat and Mass Transfer Rate\nThe numerical results for drag force (Re1/2C f ), the heat transfer rate (Re\u22121/2Nu), and the mass transfer rate (Re\u22121/2Sh) are delineated by tabulating the results obtained. Table 3 shows the numerical results for the drag force, heat, and mass transfer rate by fixing Kvs = 0.5, \u03bb = 0.5, \u2126 = 0.1, Sc = 1, Pr = 1, \u03b1 = 0.5, Ks = 0.5, Kc = 0.5 for increasing values of the oscillating parameter S. This parameter controls the up and down motion of the disk for corresponding positive and negative values of S. With an increasing positive value of S, the drag force near the disk increases. Physically, this points to the reality that the frictional forces increase due to the expansion of the disk. The heat transfer rate is also triggered due to the energy transfer process among the accelerating nanoparticles of the hybrid nanofluid. Similarly, the mass transfer process during the reaction process also accelerates for increasing values of S.\nRe1/2C f = A [( f \u2032(0) )2 + (g(0))2 ] 1 2 , Re\u22121/2Nu = \u2212C1D\u03b8\u2032(0), Re\u22121/2Sh = \u2212\u03c6\u2032(0). (46)\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1794 12 of 15\nTable 4 was constructed to depict the numerical results of the heat transfer rate obtained for various values of the variable wall temperature parameter and the oscillating parameter of the disk. It is seen that for both parameters, the heat transfer rate is enhanced. For a zero value of \u03b1, the wall is at a fixed temperature. However, with an increase in \u03b1, wall temperature is raised and the heat transfer process increases. The oscillating parameter modifies the impact of the variable wall temperature parameter.\nTable 4. Numerical outcomes for the Nusselt number Re\u22121/2Nu with a varying wall temperature parameter [26] and fixing Kvs = 0.5, \u03bb = 0.5, \u2126 = 0.5, Sc = 1, Pr = 1, Ks = 0.5, Kc = 0.5.\n\u03b1 = \u22122 \u03b1 = \u22121 \u03b1 = 0 \u03b1 = 0.2 \u03b1 = 0.3 S = 1 0.0783255 0.0686171 0.0581365 0.0559352 0.0548204\nS = 5 0.1552720 0.1243270 0.0855891 0.0764042 0.0715711\nTable 5 quantifies the effect of the upward and downward motion of the disk for surface drag force and the heat transfer rate by fixing the disk rotation to \u2126 = 0.5. For S < 0, acceleration of the disk results in a reduction in the drag force. For S = 0, the disk is fixed at its position. For S > 0, with an increase in S, the decelerating disk slows down the nanoparticles, thus causing the momentum transfer process to increase. Thus, the drag force increases rapidly. The heat transfer rate declines for an accelerating disk (S < 0) and increases slowly for a decelerating disk (S > 0).\nTable 6 validates the results presented here by comparing them with those of Turkyilmazoglu et al. [26] for various values of S. In this table, we have considered \u03c61 = 0, \u03c62 = 0 for the limiting case.

Conclusions\nThe present investigation explored unsteady hybrid nanofluid flow due to a fluctuating spinning disk.
