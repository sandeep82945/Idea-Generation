It is dened by twelve principles, which include waste prevention, atom economy, less hazardous synthesis pathways, the design of benign chemicals, green solvents and auxiliaries, energy efficiency, renewable feedstocks, reducing derivatives, catalysis, degradability, real-time analysis for pollution prevention and overall accident prevention.1 Catalysis plays a key role in green chemistry, with a focus on reactions at high selectivity under mild reaction conditions. The applied catalyst can be in the form of catalyst complexes, metal nanoparticles, or bulk powders. In addition to the catalyst's activity, the catalyst separation from the reaction media is an important issue that can be solved by catalyst immobilization. Homogeneous catalyst complexes can be immobilized in a liquid\u2013liquid two-phase system, as shown in the Ruhrchemie/Rho\u0302ne-Poulenc process for the hydroformylation of propene to n-butyraldehyde.2 Nanoparticles can be immobilized in different ways. One approach uses stabilizers like micelles3 or polymers.4,5 The most\nf Chemistry, TC8, Stra\u00dfe des 17.

For example, gold nanoparticles can be deposited on various metal oxides like silica, cerium oxide, or zirconium oxide, using chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) as the Au precursor.6 Metal oxides are preferred as support materials because of their high chemical and thermal stability.6,7 However, since many reactions such as coupling reactions or hydrogenations of phenol8 or allylbenzene9 take place at temperatures below 150 \u00b0C or even at room temperature, an alternative is to use sustainable biomaterial supports like chitosan, starch, and cellulose.6,10,11 Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer. In recent years, its use as a support material for metal nanoparticles has been investigated, as shown in the review of Kaushik and Moores.12 Cellulose nanoparticles such as nanocrystals and nanobres can be obtained from the hydrolysis of cellulose with sulfuric acid, removing the amorphous regions. Conventional deposition methods of metal nanoparticles from metal salt precursors like impregnation, including calcination at high temperatures, are not suitable because cellulose degrades at temperatures above 170 \u00b0C. Therefore, preparing supported metal nanoparticles from an appropriate precursor is common using reducing agents. Salt precursors of various metals are mostly reduced using sodium borohydride, ascorbic acid, or hydrogen as reducing agents.12 Precursors can also be reduced directly on the unmodied cellulose surface with hydroxy groups or modied nanoparticle surfaces with, e.g., aldehyde or thiol groups.12 The effort for\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The deposition of gold and silver nanoparticles is not elaborate. Their precursors, chloroauric acid and silver nitrate, are reduced by heating at 80\u2013120 \u00b0C.13,14 Reducing hexachloroplatinic acid by the surface hydroxy groups of cellulose is more challenging as an autoclave and supercritical carbon dioxide are required.15\nThe phenomenon of photodeposition describes the irradiation-induced reduction of a metal salt precursor in the presence of a reducing agent. It is also referred to as photoreduction and photochemical deposition. The photodeposition of metal nanoparticles is widely known when immobilizing them onto semiconductors such as titanium dioxide, tungsten oxide, zinc oxide, or cadmium sulde, stating the necessity of the band gap for the deposition mechanism.16 This contribution and the literature show that the necessity of a semiconductor is not true for all metal salt precursors. Nanoparticles from dissolved hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), silver perchlorate (AgClO4) and the chelate complex copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) can be directly photochemically synthesized in a solution or dispersion with support. Alcohols like ethanol and methanol are frequently used for the deposition of silver and platinum nanoparticles.17 Since alcohols can be used as a reducing agent and solvent simultaneously, the photodeposition turns out to be a very simple and green method. This contribution investigates the photodeposition of platinum nanoparticles onto cellulose, which is a popular method for the in situ immobilization of metal nanoparticles as co-catalyst in photocatalytic water splitting,18 as catalysts for the hydrogen of para-nitrophenol (PNP). The hydrogenation of PNP to para-aminophenol (PAP) is a common reaction in the pharmaceutical industry, e.g., for the synthesis of the painkiller paracetamol,19 the cough expectorant ambroxol,20 and the anticancer drug sorafenib.21 PNP can be hydrogenated with molecular hydrogen, but only at elevated pressures above 20 bar.22 Due to the high pressure and the possibility of the formation of explosive gas mixtures, safety measurements and trained personnel are required. Therefore, alternative hydrogenation reactions have been investigated, such as transfer, photocatalytic or electrocatalytic hydrogenation. The choice of the hydrogen donor depends on the reaction type. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is oen used in transfer hydrogenations in the liquid phase for catalyst testing,23 alcohols like methanol and ethanol are applied in photocatalytic hydrogenations,24 and water is used in the electrocatalytic hydrogenation. To study the catalytic performance of the as-prepared cellulose-supported Pt catalysts, the transfer-hydrogenation of PNP with NaBH4 was selected as the model reaction, because the reaction progress can be easily followed by UV-vis spectrometry. Two catalysts with different loadings were prepared via the photodeposition method and characterized. The catalytic activity was determined under different operating conditions and evaluated based on the catalyst preparation. For comparison, a commercial alumina-supported Pt catalyst was selected, too. In addition, hydrogen from electrochemical water-splitting was used in situ for the reduction of PNP as proof of both an alternative\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The setup calibration was done with platinum standard solutions with concentrations of 2.5 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 25 ppm. The nanoparticles from the catalysts were dissolved overnight by adding a mixture of HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 (10 mL, V/V/V = 3/1/1) to the sample (20 mg). Aer this time, ModCe was ltered off, and the solution was diluted with water up to 50 mL. 5 mL of this solution were taken and further diluted up to 15 mL. The catalyst loading was calculated from the prepared sample solution's measured platinum concentration.

The TECNAI device did direct recordings of diffraction patterns. The size distributions of platinum nanoparticles were generated by measuring the nanoparticle size in the TEM images using the image processing and acquisition soware Digital Micrograph from Gatan Inc.

The data analysis and visualization program QTiPlot (Version 5.12.8) was used to t the size distribution curves.\n2.5 Hydrogenation of para-nitrophenol\nThe catalysts PDPt1 and PDPt2 were used to reduce paranitrophenol with sodium borohydride as the hydrogen donor.

Next, the aqueous PNP solution (100 mL) and an aqueous MeOH solution (VMeOH/ Vwater = 70/30) was added and stirred until the NaBH4 was dissolved. The measurement program was started, and the reaction was initiated by adding the Pt@ModCe dispersion (0.25 mL of PDPt, 1.0 mL of PDPt2). The MeOH fraction and the catalyst amount were varied, and each experiment was conducted three times. A pseudo-rst-order reaction law eqn (1) was assumed to evaluate the reaction performance, where cPNP is the concentration of PNP, t the time, and k is the reaction rate constant.

Uncompensated resistance was obtained from impedance measurements, and iR corrections were performed to the applied voltage. A Pt cathode (Pt foil, 0.05 mm thick, Premion\u00ae, 99.99%, Thermo Scientic) was used as the working electrode with a geometric active area of 10 cm2. The counter electrode was a dimensionally stable anode (DSA\u00ae), and the reference electrode was a leak-free Ag/AgCl (3.4 M KCl) electrode (LF-1, Innovative Instruments Ltd). A cation exchange membrane (NRE-212, Naon\u2122, thickness 0.002 inches) was placed between the anolyte and the catholyte chambers. The anolyte was 1 M potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer solution (pH = 7), and the catholyte was either 1 M KPi with added 0.03 mM of p-nitrophenol (1 M KPi + PNP) or 1 M KPi with 0.03 mM of pnitrophenol and 0.08 g L\u22121 of PDPt1 catalyst (1 M KPi + PNP + PDPt1).

Fig. 1 shows the catalyst preparation with photodeposited platinum nanoparticles on cellulose and the resulting catalysts PDPt1 and PDPt2. The precursor suspension (Fig. 1a) has a pale-yellow color, which turns to dark grey (Fig. 1b), indicating the formation of platinum particles. The determined platinum loadings are 2.7% for PDPt1 and 0.8% for PDPt2, with corresponding deposition yields of 42% and 80%, respectively. The difference in deposition yields probably originates from different irradiation periods (30 min vs. 105 min). However, it is also known that support properties and the interaction between support and nanoparticles are important for the deposition process. Schr\u00f6der et al. used the photodepostion method to immobilize Pt nanoparticles onto carbon nitride, and the deposition yields were below 10%.26,27 The support effect in the deposition of metal nanoparticles was studied by Parapat et al.28 using a colloidal deposition method, showing that with an appropriate support, high deposition yields can be obtained. Here, the loading is relatively high (>40%), showing that cellulose can be used as a support material for the deposition of Pt nanoparticles. Further, the higher deposition yield for PDPt2 can be explained by using a cut-off lter. When using the full spectrum for the photodeposition process, the reduction of the platinum salt is fast. It produces many nanoparticles in the liquid phase, having less time to deposit onto the cellulose surface. In contrast, the reduction is much slower with the lter, so the deposition is more efficient.\nThe Pt@ModCe catalysts were characterized by TEM (Fig. 2a, c, and e), showing round-shaped nanoparticles of PDPt1, PDPt2, and Pt@Al2O3, and the particle sizes and size distributions were obtained from these images (Fig. 2b, d, and f). PDPt2 shows a smaller average particle size of 2.3 nm than PDPt1 with 4.6 nm. The difference in average particle size originates from the precursor concentration (128 mg L\u22121 for PDPt2 and 822 mg L\u22121 for PDPt2), which was also shown in earlier publications.16,29 The particle size variation of PDPt1 and PDPt2 is with a value of 0.9 nm, identical and independent from the precursor concentration. The average particle size of platinum particles of the commercial catalyst Pt@Al2O3 is 5.8 nm, signicantly larger than the PDPt2 and slightly larger than the PDPt1 particles. The particle size variation of 1.3 nm is slightly larger than that of PDPt1 and PDPt2. The crystallinity of platinum nanoparticles was investigated by determining the Miller indices of the lattice planes through the diffraction patterns recorded for PDPt1, PDPt2, and Pt@Al2O3, as shown in Fig. 3. The electron diffraction of polycrystalline materials leads to diffraction patterns with sharp rings. The reciprocal lattice value 1/r is the radius of\nthese rings and was measured to calculate the plane distance d. The lattice plane distance is the characteristic value for each crystal composition's lattice plane and was determined by the internal database of the TEM devices (JCPDS 46-1043 and 04- 0802). The values 1/r, d, and Miller indices are listed in Table 2. For all platinum crystals, at least the two Miller indices (111) and (200), and sometimes additionally (220), were identied. In the diffraction patterns of Pt@Al2O3, the aluminum oxide reexes can overlay platinum's reexes because the lattice plane distances are similar. However, since no other typical reexes of platinum are found, the same lattice plane distances can be assumed. The combination of the Miller indices of the lattice planes indicates a face-centered cubic lattice structure (fcc) of platinum nanocrystals, which is also the characteristic lattice structure of platinum.30,31 Consequently, the deposition method does not inuence the crystallinity when platinum nanoparticles are formed. The photodeposition of platinum nanoparticles on a non-semiconductor like cellulose provides nanoparticles with platinum-characteristic fcc lattice structure in small, narrow distributed sizes. Best deposition yield and smallest nanoparticles were obtained with low precursor concentration."

The reduction of the nitro group proceeds over two intermediates (Fig. 4a). First, the NaBH4 deprotonates the hydroxyl group of PNP to pnitrophenolate (PNPT), causing the shi of its absorption maximum from 315 nm to 400 nm, as shown in Fig. 4b. That enables the monitoring of the reaction via UV-vis spectroscopy. Second, the nitro group is reduced to p-aminophenolate (PAPT) in three steps. In each step, two hydrogens (a hydride and a proton) are transferred.11 Finally, with the complete decomposition of NaBH4 and the neutralization of the solution, PAPT is protonated to PAP. The obtained data for an experiment was plotted as an absorbance\u2013time diagram (Fig. 4c). The maximum of the curve occurs aer the catalyst was added and was marked as time t= 0 for further evaluation with eqn (3). The absorbance at t = 0 was I0. The data was then plotted in an ln I I0 -time diagram (Fig. 4d). The slope of the regression line was the rate constant k.\n3.2.2 Impact of reaction solvent. Unmodied cellulose can not be dispersed in polar solvents like water or methanol; therefore, it was modied by sulphuric acid treatment. Aer this modication, cellulose can be dispersed. However, the solvent still inuences the homogeneity, as shown in Fig. 5. The best dispersion of cellulose is obtained for a mixture of methanol and water with a methanol content of about 70 vol%\n30864 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 30860\u201330870\n(Fig. 5b). For pure water (Fig. 5a), the dispersion is quite homogenous. However, in the case of pure methanol (Fig. 5c), an inhomogeneous dispersion is obtained.\nIn the investigation of how the solvent inuences the catalytic activity and to select the solvent system for the following experiments, the methanol fraction was varied in the range 4\u2013 96 vol%. The reaction rate constant k and the activity A were determined as described in Section 3.2.1 and plotted in Fig. 6 against the methanol volume fraction 4.\nFor the high-loaded PDPt1 (2.7 wt% Pt), the reaction rate constant and the activity do not change with variation of the methanol fraction. For the low loaded PDPt2 (0.8 wt% Pt), the reaction rate constant and the activity are slightly lower for a methanol fraction of 92 vol%. The latter is probably due to the limitation of mass transport caused by the swelled cellulose, increasing the viscosity of the solution. The platinum concentrations with 11 mM for PDPt1 and 3 mM for PDPt2 for the reduction of 33 mM PNP are considerably high, providing sufficient activity centers to lower or, in the case of PDPt1, avoid the impact of the cellulose swelling on the reaction rate. However, the overall impact of cellulose swelling with increasing methanol fraction on reaction rate and activity is negligible. The activity values of PDPt2 are generally higher than those of PDPt1 because of the lower loading of PDPt2 and, therefore, lower Pt concentration. The mean activity of PDPt2 is about 3 mmol g\u22121 min\u22121 which is about 1.7 times higher than\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The comparison of the platinum mass ratio m(PDPt2)/m(PDPt1) of 0.7 with the catalysts activity ratio A(PDPt2)/A(PDPt1) of 1.7 shows that the activity is not inuenced by the catalyst mass exclusively. If that is the case, both values would be identical. The nanoparticle surface ratio (NSR) was calculated from eqn (5):\nNSR \u00bc p\u00f0rPDPt2\u00de 2\np\u00f0rPDPt1\u00de2 (5)\nThe NSR is 0.3, which is close to the value of the ratio of the activity ratio and mass ratio, indicating that the catalyst activity is mainly inuenced by the particle size of the active catalytic species.\n3.2.3 Impact of catalyst concentration. For the variation of the catalyst concentration, the added volumes of the catalyst stock suspension were variated to be 125 mL, 250 mL, 500 mL, and\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n1000 mL for PDPt1 as well as 250 mL, 500 mL, and 1000 mL for PDPt2. The catalyst concentration is given as the concentration of platinum nanoparticles calculated from the added catalyst amount multiplied by the platinum loading measured by ICPOES. The obtained rate constants and activities are plotted against the platinum concentration in Fig. 7. The reaction rate constant and the activity of a commercial Pt@Al2O3 catalyst is shown as a reference. For the same platinum concentration, the reaction is four-fold faster for the cellulose-supported catalysts prepared via photodeposition. With increasing catalyst concentration, the reaction constant increases rst but will become constant later. PDPt1 indicates a saturation curve with a maximum k value of 0.43 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121 for platinum concentrations higher or equal to 23 mM, caused by mass transport limitation at the solid\u2013liquid interface. The PNP to PAP conversion is faster than the molecular diffusion of the reactants onto and from the catalyst.

The saturation level of PDPt2 is not reached within the same concentration range because of the low loading of PDPt1. Due to the low platinum concentration in the stock suspension, the required suspension volume would have been too large for the cuvette in further experiments. The activity decreases with increasing platinum concentration and decreases slightly more for PDPt2 than for PDPt1.\nNo reference was found in the literature where supported platinum nanoparticles catalyze the PNP reduction with the same concentrations of platinum and PNP as used here. One example was found by K\u00f6nig et al.9 with 32 mMPNP in a reaction volume of 3 mL. They studied a catalyst with ethoxylated polyethylene imine as support with a Pt loading of 30 wt%. Thus, the platinum concentration was 513 mM resulting in a rate constant of 0.165 min\u22121 and an activity of 63 mmol g\u22121 min\u22121. Further discussions with these reported catalysts are only possible with additional characterizations like particle size. Another example is the publication of Lin et al.32 with 13 mM PNP in a reaction\n30866 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 30860\u201330870\nvolume of 3 mL and a catalyst with wood cellulose as support (0.1 wt%, Pt). The size of Pt particles was 2.3 nm, which is similar to the particle size of PDPt2 and smaller than the particle size of PDPt1. Thus, the platinum concentration was 0.9 mM resulting in an activity of 0.6 mmol g\u22121 min\u22121, which is a lower activity than obtained for Pt catalysts in this work despite the low loading and small Pt nanoparticles. These results show that the Pt@ModCe catalysts are active for PNP transfer-hydrogenation. The activities are in the same order of magnitude or even better than the reported ones.\n3.2.4 Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of para-nitrophenol. The possibility to utilize electrochemically generated hydrogen to hydrogenate PNP to PAP using the Pt@ModCe catalyst PDPt1 was also explored. Three-electrode electrochemical conguration was used, with a Pt cathode as the working electrode, a dimensionally stable anode as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. 1 M potassium phosphate (KPi, pH 7) buffer was used as the anolyte, and the catholyte was 1MKPi and 0.03mMPNP without and with PDPt1 catalyst (80 mg L\u22121).

Since no hydrogenation catalyst is added, the electrochemical hydrogenation of PNP to PAP occurs directly on the surface of the Pt cathode. The instability of the measured potential is attributed to the transformation of Pt surface during the hydrogenation reaction, as reported previously during the electrochemical hydrogenation of maleic acid.33 This limitation is overcome when the PDPt1 hydrogenation catalyst is added to the catholyte; the measured potential remains stable within two hours of the electrochemical measurement (see Fig. 8a \u2013 red curve). In this conguration, hydrogenation of PNP occurs in a coupled mechanism, i.e., H2 electrochemically evolves on the surface of the Pt cathode, which is subsequently used for the catalytic hydrogenation of PNP over the PDPt1 catalyst within the catholyte compartment. The coupled electrochemical hydrogenation results in a much more rapid initial decrease of I/I0, which then saturates at 0.30 0.08 aer \u223c10 min (see Fig. 8b \u2013 red curve). This indicates that complete hydrogenation of PNP to PAP nishes within 10 min. Assuming that the\n30868 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 30860\u201330870\nfaradaic efficiency for H2 is 100% on the Pt cathode, this corresponds to a H2-to-PAP conversion of \u223c5%, i.e., 5% of the electrochemically generated H2 are directly used in situ to hydrogenate PNP to PAP. Further improvement of the conversion is expected by optimizing the electrochemical cell parameters (e.g., ow rate, electrolyte composition), but this is beyond the scope of the current study. Fig. 8c shows the natural logarithm of I/I0 plotted as a function of time. Based on eqn (3), the hydrogenation rate constant can be determined from the slope of the curves. The hydrogenation rate constant increases from 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121 to 0.11 min\u22121 with the addition of PDPt1 into the catholyte. This 20-fold increase in rate constant highlights the important benet of coupled vs. direct electrochemical hydrogenation. The same PNP and PDPt1 catalyst concentrations were used for coupled electrocatalytic hydrogenation and the previously shown transfer hydrogenation with NaBH4. The rate constant for the coupled hydrogenation is approximately 256- fold higher than the highest reaction rate of the classic model reaction (0.43 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121), emphasizing the high effectivity of this reaction concept.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "Platinum nanoparticles were deposited onto cellulose via photodeposition. Two catalysts were manufactured this way using no lter (PDPt1) and a 395 nm cut-off lter (PDPt2) during irradiation. PDPt1 and PDPt2 were compared to a commercial Pt@Al2O3 catalyst for characterization and testing with the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of PNP with NaBH4. The characterization by transmission electron microscopy showed that the platinum particles on cellulose are with 4.6 nm for PDPt1 and 2.3 nm for PDPt2 smaller and have a narrower size distribution than the particles on Pt@Al2O3 (5.8 nm). Not using a cutoff- lter probably leads to a lower deposition yield of PDPt1 (42%) than PDPt2 (80%). Platinum particles of all catalysts are round-shaped and have the same crystallinity. The testing with the transfer hydrogenation of PNP, evaluated with rst-order reaction rate law, investigated the inuence of the solvent composition and catalyst concentration. The dispersion becomes inhomogeneous, with increasing methanol volume fraction inuencing the reaction rate constant negligibly. PDPt1 shows a higher conversion than PDPt2 due to its higher loading. However, the comparison of the activity of the manufactured catalysts showed that nanoparticle size mainly inuences the activity of the catalysts. Varying the catalyst concentration, the transport limitations lead to a maximum possible rate constant of 0.43 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121. The activity values of the prepared platinum nanoparticles are similar to or better than those of other reports. PDPt1 and PDPt2 are considerably more active than the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

In this coupled reaction, the in situ, electrochemically generated molecular hydrogen is directly used for the PNP reduction. This hydrogenation method, forming molecular hydrogen at the platinum electrode and its subsequent consumption for the PNP hydrogenation, achieves a vastly higher reaction rate (256-fold) than the transfer hydrogenation method with sodium borohydride. This example of a coupled electrocatalytic hydrogenation shows the potential and necessity to continue exploring this technique.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no conicts of interest."
