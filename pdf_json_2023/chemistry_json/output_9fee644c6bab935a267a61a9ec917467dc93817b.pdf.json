    "abstractText": "Improving the dispersion of active sites simultaneouswith the efficient harvest of photons is a key priority for photocatalysis. Crystalline silicon is abundant on Earth and has a suitable bandgap. However, silicon-based photocatalysts combined with metal elements has proved challenging due to silicon\u2019s rigid crystal structure and high formation energy. Here we report a solid-state chemistry that produces crystalline silicon with well-dispersed Co atoms. Isolated Co sites in silicon are obtained through the in-situ formation of CoSi2 intermediate nanodomains that function as seeds, leading to theproductionof Co-incorporating silicon nanocrystals at the CoSi2/Si epitaxial interface. As a result, cobalt-on-silicon single-atom catalysts achieve an external quantum efficiency of 10% for CO2-to-syngas conversion, with CO and H2 yields of 4.7mol g(Co) \u22121 and 4.4mol g(Co) , respectively. Moreover, the H2/CO ratio is tunable between 0.8 and 2. This photocatalyst also achieves a corresponding turnover number of 2 \u00d7 10 for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction over 6 h, which is over ten times higher than previously reported single-atom photocatalysts.",

Sargent 2, Cheng-Yong Su 1 & Zhenyu Yang 1\nImproving the dispersion of active sites simultaneouswith the efficient harvest of photons is a key priority for photocatalysis. Crystalline silicon is abundant on Earth and has a suitable bandgap. However, silicon-based photocatalysts combined with metal elements has proved challenging due to silicon\u2019s rigid crystal structure and high formation energy. Here we report a solid-state chemistry that produces crystalline silicon with well-dispersed Co atoms. Isolated Co sites in silicon are obtained through the in-situ formation of CoSi2 intermediate nanodomains that function as seeds, leading to theproductionof Co-incorporating silicon nanocrystals at the CoSi2/Si epitaxial interface. As a result, cobalt-on-silicon single-atom catalysts achieve an external quantum efficiency of 10% for CO2-to-syngas conversion, with CO and H2 yields of 4.7mol g(Co) \u22121 and 4.4mol g(Co) \u22121, respectively. Moreover, the H2/CO ratio is\ntunable between 0.8 and 2. This photocatalyst also achieves a corresponding turnover number of 2 \u00d7 104 for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction over 6 h, which is over ten times higher than previously reported single-atom photocatalysts.\nThe optimization of active site performance and atom efficiency are essential objectives in the realms of energy conversion, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis1\u20133. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received worldwide research interests toward these goals due to their tunable and well-defined coordination environments4\u20136.\nNotable synthetic progresses havebeenmade to achieve SACswith highly dispersed guest atoms7\u20139. The precise control of the desired catalysts configuration, however, remains challenging for developing\nefficient SACs. Specifically, seeking approaches to achieve efficient atomic metal dispersion on the desired substrate is essential to fulfil these desired objectives in practical catalytic applications.\nConstructing SACs on semiconductor substrates has the potential to unite efficient photon harvesting and electron\u2013hole separation for catalytic reactions10\u201314. To date, photocatalytic SACs have featured metal oxides, chalcogenides, and metal\u2013organic frameworks;15\u201319 however, poor charge carrier generation has led to external quantum efficiencies below 1%, even with the benefit of\nReceived: 3 August 2022\nAccepted: 15 March 2023\nCheck for updates\n1MOE Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry, Lehn Institute of Functional Materials, School of Chemistry, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275 Guangzhou, China. 2Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 35 St. George Street, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada. 3Frontiers Science Center for Transformative Molecules, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, China. 4Electron Microscopy for Materials Science (EMAT), University of Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, 2020 Antwerp, Belgium. 5NANOlab Center of Excellence, University of Antwerp, 2020 Antwerp, Belgium. 6Department of Chemistry, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China. 7Canadian Light Source, Inc.

The rigiddiamond-type structure of silicon tends to expel dopant elements during crystal formation at high temperatures, yielding low concentrations of active sites in silicon SACs reported to date34\u201336. We reasoned that epitaxial growthon silicon could provide precise control over the location of the guest atoms37. We sought a solid-state chemistry approach to construct silicon-based SACs (Fig. 1), pursuing a route wherein metal silicide with layered structures leads to silicon domains that decompose to yield active metal atoms dispersed in the silicon lattice38. We posited that the in situ formation of metal silicide might facilitate the growth of silicon and lead to the incorporation of dopant metals from the metal silicide/silicon interface.\nWe tested this idea using cobalt silicide (CoSi2) as the target and silicon as the host since these have similar cubic crystalline structures and low lattice mismatch (1.6% and 2.2% along the [100] and [110] orientations, respectively, Fig. 1a)39. We hypothesized that the CoSi2 domains could serve as templates to promote the in situ growth of\ndiamond-structured crystalline Si (c-Si) via atomic epitaxy, enabling the incorporation of Co atoms in c-Si lattice during the decomposition of the CoSi2 domain at high temperatures (Fig. 1b). We prepared Co@Si SACs with tunable Co concentrations in c-Si (0.4\u22121.4 wt%) with negligible aggregation (e.g., formation of clusters or nanocrystals, Supplementary Table 1). The incorporation of atomically dispersed Co on nano-silicon enables efficient visible-light-driven CO2RR to produce syngas (H2 + CO) with the H2: CO ratio ranging between 0.8 and 2 (v/v). With 1.4wt% of Co loading, the Co@Si catalysis achieved turnover number (TON) values up to 2 \u00d7 104, over 13 times higher than the previous best obtained using single-atom photocatalysts40."

No crystalline features are seen in the XRD pattern of the HSiO1.5 precursor, confirming its amorphous nature. After the thermal annealing at 500 \u00b0C, strong signals emerge at 47.8\u00b0 and 56.2\u00b0, which can be assigned to the (220) and (311) facets of CoSi2 42 (Fig. 2a).

The process is initiated by CoSi2 nanodomains formation by doping Co(II) in a silicon-rich network homogeneously (Step i) and annealing at low temperature (T1 = 500 \u00b0C) (Step ii); the thermally-induced CoSi2 decomposition occurred at high temperature (T2 = 700 \u00b0C) during the silicon crystallization enables the crystal re-arrangement (Step iii); the diffusion of Co and Si atoms during extended annealing (T2 = 700 \u00b0C) enables single Co dispersion in the lattice of c-Si, yielding Co@Si SAC (Step iv).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1719 3\nsubsequent annealing at 700 \u00b0C, suggesting the growth of CoSi2 nanodomains at elevated temperatures. However, the presence of c-Si domains cannot be determined by XRDmeasurements due to the high degree of lattice coherence between CoSi2 and c-Si. We, therefore, proceeded with hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching to remove CoSi2 and SiO2 matrix and confirmed the formation of silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs)with an average size of ~12 nmas verifiedby the Scherrer equation (Supplementary Fig. 2). The migration of Co atoms becomes more evident at higher temperatures as the crystalline cobalt is found from the XRD pattern of the sample annealed at 800 \u00b0C (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nThe XRD results hint that both CoSi2 and c-Si can be generated and co-exist in a series of solid-state reactions. We sought to explore further\u2014with the aid of using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) \u2014 atomicmigration and the local environmentof both Si andCoduring the annealing processes. Prior to annealing, only the emission features at 102.1 and 103.2 eV were observed, which can be attributed to Si(III) and Si(IV) (Fig. 2b). The characteristic signals of Co(II) are found in higher-energy regions (2p1/2: 795 eV; 2p3/2: 780 eV, Fig. 2c), consistent with the homogeneously dispersed ionic cobalt in the HSiO1.5 precursor42. After thermal annealing at 500 \u00b0C, the original Co(II) signals disappeared,whereas a new feature is foundat 778.2 eV,whichcan be assigned toCo(0) (Fig. 2c). A new signal at 99.2 eV emerges on the Si 2p spectrum (Fig. 2b), falling within the literature values of Si(0) in c-Si42. Since cobalt and silicon have similar electronegativity (\u03c7Co = 1.88, \u03c7Si = 1.90) meanwhile the crystalline cobalt signal is absent from the XRD pattern (Fig. 2a), we therefore conclude that CoSi2 nanodomains are formed through a two-step process: (1) the disproportionation of HSiO1.5 and (2) the redox reaction from Co\n2+ to CoSi2 (in which the valence of Co is close to 0) at 500 \u00b0C due to its relatively lower formation energy compared to that of metallic Co43. When the temperature increases to 700 \u00b0C, no observable change in the signals of Si(0) and Si(IV), whereas the disappearance of the Si(III) feature suggests complete disproportionation ofHSiO1.5 to elemental Si and SiO2 at that temperature43. As for Co, the notable Co(0) signal confirm the presence of elemental Co sites embedded in the c-Si lattice, whereas the re-emergence of Co(II) signals at 795 eV (2p1/2) and 780 eV (2p3/2) indicates partial dissociation of atomic Co from CoSi2 and the subsequent diffusion to the SiO2 matrix, yielding CoOx.\nWe next investigated the structure of Co@Si SACs and the dispersion of Co atomsusing electronmicroscopy. The distribution of Co within the annealed sample is relatively uniform as indicated by the combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the corresponding EDX analysis (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Table 2). To further test whether the active Co sites are located on the silicon nanodomains, we applied HF-etching to extract the Si NC components; and we then functionalized their surfaces with alkyl ligands (see \u201cMethods\u201d). We investigated the surface-functionalized NCs using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging, showing highly dispersed Co atoms (as denoted with yellow dashed circles) in Si NCs with an average diameter of 5 nm (left panel of Fig. 2e and Supplementary\nFig. 6). A Co@Si NC exhibits lattice spacings of ~3.1 \u00c5 and ~2.0 \u00c5 (Fig. 2e, f). The first distance is in agreement with the expected d-spacing of the {111} lattice planes (3.1 \u00c5) of c-Si. However, the value of ~2.0 \u00c5 is slightly different from the expected d-spacing of the {220} lattice planes (1.9\u00c5) of c-Si, a lattice expansion which has already been reported for Si NCs in a previous study44. The Co electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) signal (L3 edge, 779 eV) is observed in the EEL spectrum from a selected area of functionalized Co@Si NCs (demonstrated by the cyan square), which proved the presence of Co (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Note 1). By tuning the Co:Si ratio in the sol\u2013gel precursor, we tuned the Co concentration from 0.4 to 3.4wt% as evidenced via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (see \u201cMethods\u201d and Supplementary Table 1).\nThe materials characterization leads us to a more detailed model of the CoSi2-assisted SAC growth mechanism (Fig. 2h). During the thermal annealing at 500 \u00b0C, HSiO1.5 disproportionates and form Si atoms, which subsequently interact with Co(II) under a reducing atmosphere to form CoSi2 nanodomains within the porous SiO2 matrix. Owing to the low latticemismatchwith c-Si, CoSi2 domains can behave as the \u201cseeds\u201d to allow further nucleation of Si atoms at elevated temperatures (e.g., 700 \u00b0C), yielding Si NCs on grown from the CoSi2 nanodomains. In the meantime, because of the lack of thermal stability of CoSi2 at 700 \u00b0C, Co and Si atoms gradually diffuse from the CoSi2 lattice and participate in the growth of Si NCs to form Co@Si SACs."

The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Si K-edge exhibit both elemental Si and SiO2 features from the Co@Si structures with various Co concentrations45 (Supplementary Fig. 7). The Co K-edge XANES spectra of Co@Si samples show undistinguishable cobalt oxides (CoOx) and elemental Co signals, suggesting that the Co atoms are well-dispersed in SACs. In contrast, notable Co\u2013O and Co\u2013Co features are found from the Co@SiO2 control sample (i.e., no c-Si domains), indicating the inevitable oxidation or aggregation of Co atoms when no crystalline silicon domain is available for anchoring (Fig. 3a).\nTo investigate the chemical environments of the active sites in Co@Si, we applied Fourier-transformed EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectroscopy. We examined the local bonding information of Co atoms (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9, and Supplementary\nTable 3), finding that the oxidized (dCo-O = 1.6\u20131.9 \u00c5) and metallic Co (dCo-Co = 2.2\u20132.5 \u00c5) signals are observed from the spectra of the Co@Si structures with 1.4 wt%Co and 3.4 wt%Co, respectively45\u201347. Both oxidation and aggregation of Co are exhibited in Co@SiO2 control sample. In contrast, neither the metallic feature nor the oxidation state is found in the Co@Si samples with lower Co concentrations (e.g., 0.4 wt% and 0.5 wt%Co). We therefore conclude that the efficient isolated Co dispersion can be achieved only when the Co concentration is below 1.4 wt% (Fig. 3c).\nThe coordination information of Co atoms can be further extracted from the Co K-edge EXAFS results. Relatively low coordination number (CN) values (2.5\u20134.0) of Co atoms are noticed in the Co@Si sampleswith variousCo concentrations (from0.4wt% to 3.4wt % Co, Fig. 3d) compared tometallic Co (CN =6). The emergence of the Co\u2013O was noticed in the 1.4wt% sample and both Co\u2013O and Co\u2013Co appeared in the 3.4wt% sample, indicating that the increase of Co concentration may introduce oxidation and aggregation of Co atoms (Fig. 3d). The corresponding fitting parameters of bond lengths are summarized in Fig. 3d. The Co\u2013Si bond length within the control Co@SiO2 sample (2.9\u00c5) is ~25% longer than the average Co\u2013Si bond length of Co@Si SACs (~2.3 \u00c5), which can be attributed to the Co\u2013O\u2013Si linkage between Co and Si atoms (Fig. 3e). In contrast, the average Co\u2013Si bond lengths are consistent in allCo@Si samples, indicating that the Co atoms in Co@Si samples, regardless of the Co concentration, own a similar coordination environment when incorporated in silicon lattice (Fig. 3e)."

The porous nature of the SiO2 matrix (pore size: ~5 nm, Supplementary Figs. 10\u201312) enables high CO2 capture capability (~9.2 cc/g, Supplementary Fig. 13), facilitating CO2RR on Co@Si SACs. In a typical reaction, 2mg of the Co@Si powders were dispersed in acetonitrile in a sealed glass vial filled with CO2 gas. Triethanolamine (TEOA) and tris(2,2\u2019-bipyridine) ruthenium dichloride ([Ru(bpy)3]Cl2)\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1719 4\nwere applied as the sacrificial agent and photosensitizer, respectively. The reduction products, CO and H2, were immediately formed when the solution was irradiated by the white light source (\u03bbex > 400 nm). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC\u2013MS) results confirmed that the generation of 13COwhen 13CO2 was applied as the input gas, ensuring that CO2 is the only carbon source of CO (see \u201cMethods\u201d and Supplementary Fig. 14). The H2 product, in contrast, can be generated even by the Co-free control sample (Supplementary Fig. 15), suggesting that the c-Si domains promote the proton-to-H2 conversion.\nThe intense light absorption by the c-Si domain further promotes the CO2RR (Supplementary Fig. 16). The highest yields of CO (4.72mol g(Co) \u22121) andH2 (4.43mol g(Co) \u22121) were achievedwith the 0.5wt %Co sample, over 103\u2013104 times higher than those produced by the commercial Co andCo3O4, respectively (Fig. 4a). It is important to note that the free-standing Co@Si NCs (i.e., without the SiO2 matrix) also exhibited evident photocatalytic activity compared to the Co-free counterpart when no photosensitizer was applied, indicating that the photocatalytic behaviors of the Co@Si powders originate from theCoincorporated Si cores (Supplementary Fig. 17, also see Supplementary Note 2 for more details).\nThe combination of efficient photon harvesting and dispersion of active Co atoms steers the state-of-the-art CO2 conversion. A total TON of ~2.0 \u00d7 104 for CO2-to-CO was achieved on the Co@Si SACs with 1.4wt%Co for a typical reaction of 6 h. This is 13-fold higher than the best previously reported heterogeneous catalysts for photocatalytic CO2RR (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 18, and Supplementary Table 4)\n40. The H2/CO ratio can be tuned from 0.8 to 2 through the change of Co concentration in Co@Si powders (Fig. 4b) and the amount of proton source (Supplementary Fig. 19, the detailed discussion about the\nfunctions of water and TEOA is available in SupplementaryNote 3). We observed a notable decrease in TON for the reaction with higher Co loading (3.4wt%Co, Fig. 4b). Thismay be attributed to the aggregation of Co atoms in which the catalytic activity of the single-atom site is inhibited48.\nThe stability tests were performed to evaluate the photocatalytic durability of the catalyst. The SACs retained ~100% syngas production rate after three cycles (1 h per cycle) of photocatalysis (Supplementary\nFig. 20). The Co@Si sample with 3.4wt%Co presents the highest CO conversion of ~10mmol g\u22121, which can be attributed to its relatively high Co loading (Fig. 4c). The atomic Co dispersion is remained consistent in catalyst after irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 21). The CO production rate drastically reduced after 6 h irradiation (Fig. 4c). This may be because of the decomposition of photosensitizer under continuous visible-light irradiation49. Through the compositional engineering of the Co@Si SACs, we achieved an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10% combining the efficient metal loading, which surpasses the performance of previously reported heterogeneous photocatalysts for visible-light-driven CO2RR (Fig. 4d, more information about the referred catalysis is available in Supplementary\nTable 5)15\u201318,20,50\u201364.\nThe materials characterization and catalytic performance investigation presented above lead us to a more detailed model of the syngas production promoted by Co@Si SACs which follows a joint reaction (Supplementary Fig. 22)65. As the initial step, CO2 gas was captured by the porous structure of the SiO2 matrix and converted to the absorption state (CO2\n*, Step i). The proton was supplied by the ionic equilibrium of H2O.

Meanwhile, the CO2* grasps the electron and the proton from Co@Si and solution, respectively, which subsequently converts to form the COOH* intermediate and finally forms CO (Steps v and vi)52,66. A considerable amount of asformed protons are eventually reduced on the Co-free c-Si facets to produce H2 (Step vii). Similar joint reaction processes have also been found from other photocatalytic systems such as Janus particles, and two-dimensional heterostructures67\u201371.\nWe report a solid-state synthetic strategy to prepare Si-based SACs with tunable Co concentrations between 0.4 wt% and 3.4 wt% and a porous SiO2 matrix as catalyst support. The formation of Co@Si powders is based on a two-step solid-state epitaxial growth process. The in situ formation of the CoSi2 intermediate is key to the formation of Si domains at relatively low temperatures and the subsequent Co diffusion into the silicon lattice. Combined spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were applied to elucidate the atomic environment of the active Co sites on silicon nanodomains. The catalytic efficiency towards visible-light-driven syngas production is exhibited by 4.72mol g(Co) \u22121 of CO and 4.43mol g(Co) \u22121 of H2 output with a TON value of 2 \u00d7 104, outclassing any other photocatalytic SACs based on noble metals or transition metals. The H2/\nCO ratio can be continuously tuned between 0.8 and 2 by adjusting the Co concentration and the components of the proton source, which are compatible with downstream industrial catalytic processes such as Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis and methanol production72,73. This work develops a synthetic path toward efficient SACs using group IV semiconductors, which are believed to be ideal photocatalytic platforms for CO2 valorization integrated with organic synthesis."

The light source was a white LED light setup (10W, \u03bb > 400nm, PCX50B/50C, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.). In the long-term stability test in the recycling experiment, TEOA and photosensitizer were directly added to the previous reaction to restart the following cycles.\nCarbon isotope tracer measurements The isotope-labeling catalytic experiments using 13CO2molecules were performedunder the same conditions. Briefly, 2mgof powderyCo@Si SAC samplewas suspended in a 50-mLglass vial with 5mLof themixed solvent containing TEOA and MeCN (volume ratio: 1:4) and the presence of 4mg of photosensitizer of [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+Cl2, yielding a homogeneous light-orange solution. 13CO2 (99.999%, Sigma) gas was purged three times (15min for each purge period) to the glass vial to obtain a saturated 13CO2 atmosphere. The gaseous products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010).\nExternal quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements The EQE results were estimated by arranging actinometry to measure the photon flux difference through an empty vial and the sample (containing TEOA, MeCN, H2O, [Ru(bpy)3]\n2+Cl2, and catalyst) from the bottom to the top of the vial. 2mgof the powdery 3.4wt%Co@Si SACs was suspended in a 50-mL glass vial with 5mL of the mixed solvent\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1719 7\ncontaining TEOA and MeCN (volume ratio: 1:4) and the presence of 4mg of photosensitizer of tris (2,2\u2019-bipyridine) ruthenium dichloride, to the homogeneous solution 0.5mL of DI water was added as proton donors. The photocatalytic experiment was proceeded using a blue LED lamp (\u03bb = 450nm), and the light intensity was calibrated using an optical power meter (FZ-A, BNU Photoelectric Instruments). The CO2RR was maintained for 1 h.\nThe EQE values were calculated using the following Eq. (1):\nEQE\u00f0%\u00de= 2n\u00f0CO\u00deNAhc tirrI\u03bbA \u00d7 100% \u00f01\u00de\nHere, n(CO) is the number of moles of the product CO, NA is Avogadro\u2019s number, h is Planck\u2019s constant, c is the speed of light, tirr is the reaction time, I is the intensity of light, \u03bb is thewavelengthof the incident light, and A is the cross-sectional area of irradiation. In this study, 18.16 \u03bcmol of H2 and 27.92 \u03bcmol of CO were produced after the irradiation for 1 h (irradiation wavelength: 450nm), NA =6.02 \u00d7 10\n23mol\u22121, h=6.63 \u00d7 10\u201334 J\u00b7s, c= 3\u00d7 108m/s, I =88mWcm\u20132 = 0.88 J cm\u20132 s\u20131, A=0.785 cm2. According to the equation, the EQE(H2) and EQE(CO) values were calculated as 4% and 6%, respectively."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded with a special aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (JEOL-ARM200F) operated at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM images and EELS results were acquired using an aberrationcorrected \u201ccubed\u201d Thermo Fisher Scientific Themis 60\u2013300 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV with a probe current of ~50 pA for HAADF-STEM imaging and ~150 pA for EELS measurement, respectively. Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF) aperture of 2.5mmwas used. The individual EELS image is 25 \u00d7 25 pixels, taking a dwell time of 1 s per pixel. The spectrometer dispersion was set to 0.25 eV, and 2048 channels were used. 10 \u00b5L of functionalized Co@Si NC dispersion was drop-casted on a homemade graphene grid in order to achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio during the measurements. To alleviate carbon contamination of the samples induced by electron beam illumination, the graphene TEM grid was heated in activated carbon (Charcoal activated for analysis, extra pure, Merck KGaA, Germany) at 300 \u00b0C for 8 h and then cooled down to room temperature prior to the electron microscopy study.\nSynchrotron XAS studies Synchrotron XAS measurements at the Si K- and Co K-edges were carried out at the Soft X-rayMicro Characterization Beamline (SXRMB, E/\u0394E > 104) of the Canadian Light Source (CLS, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada). Non-polarized X-rays were used for excitation, and fluorescence X-rays were recorded using a 7-element silicon drift detector. XAS data were processed using Athena software in Demeter (v.0.9.26). A cubic spline function was used to fit the background above the absorption edge for the XAS spectral normalization75. The normalized EXAFS function, \u03c7(E), in energy space was then transformed to \u03c7(k), where k is the photoelectronwave vector. To assess the interatomic interaction of Co atoms, \u03c7(k) was multiplied by k to amplify the EXAFS oscillations in the low-k region. Fourier transformation (from k space to R space) of the k -weighted \u03c7(k) with a k range of 2.5\u201311 \u00c5\u22121 for the Co K-edge was applied to differentiate the EXAFS oscillation from different coordination shells. Co K-edge EXAFS data recorded in R space (0.6\u20133.0 \u00c5) was fitted using Artemis software in Demeter with the FEFF6 program76, in which structural parameters of Co samples were calculated, including coordination number (CN), bond distance (R), inner potential shift (\u0394E0), and Debye\u2013Waller factor (\u03c32)."
