    "abstractText": "This study determined the effects of techno-stressors on employees\u2019 well-being. It also determined the moderating role of technostress inhibitors in techno-stressors and employees\u2019 well-being. We employed a time-lagged design and self-administered survey method to collect data from banking employees. We retrieved 355 usable responses. The results showed that techno-stressors significantly and negatively affected employees\u2019 well-being. Technostress inhibitors significantly and positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. The moderating effects of techno-stressors and technostress inhibitors showed that six of nine moderating effects were significant and positive. The results implied that technostress inhibitors help to improve employees\u2019 well-being. In the end, we present some implications for theory and practice.",

The stress arising from the use of technology is called technostress (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Ayyagari et al., 2011). Technostress refers to stress that individuals experience because of information systems at the workplace (Tarafdar et al., 2019). It is a syndrome of adaptation because of the incompetence in managing advanced technologies (Brod, 1984). Individuals feel anxiety and the opposing effects on beliefs, deeds, insolences, and bodies when dealing with technology (Kupersmith, 1992; Weil and Rosen, 1997). Technostress results from distorted behaviors of work that are because of the use of updated information technologies at work and home (Srivastava et al., 2015).\nPeople experience technostress when they cannot adjust to information technologies properly. Technology has become a part of our daily life, and it keeps us linked all the time (Tarafdar et al., 2014). People feel bound to share daily updates, answer work-related information on time and involve in routine multi-tasking. Researchers have specified the negative aspects of technological advancement (Heinssen et al., 1987; Fisher and Wesolkowski, 1999; Ma et al., 2021). Employees continuously update their technical skills and receive training to work with a new and upgraded technology-based system (Richardson, 2017). These requirements negatively affect employees\u2019\nthoughts on the road to technological advancements (Heinssen et al., 1987). This situation forces employees to work hard and faster to fulfill work demands. Introducing new technology or system up-gradation may lead to downsizing. Employees feel vulnerable that they may be replaced if they cannot meet their job demands (Bradley, 2000).\nDifferent researchers have studied the effects of technostress on a variety of outcomes, such as productivity, role overload and role conflict (Tarafdar et al., 2007), satisfaction and commitment (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Ayyagari et al., 2011), disruptive behavior dissatisfaction at work, lack of job involvement, and poor job performance (Tarafdar et al., 2011, 2014; Srivastava et al., 2015), emotional exhaustion and poor work-life balance (Ma et al., 2021) and job insecurity (Grant et al., 2013). Earlier studies had mainly considered techno-stressors a composite construct that hindered the ability to segregate the effects of different techno-stressors on outcomes. Besides, their focus remained on work-related outcomes. However, non-work-life outcomes received less attention (Tarafdar et al., 2019). The researchers suggested that the social consequences of technology are not fully explored (Tarafdar et al., 2019; Zhong, 2020; Dai et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021). Atasanoff and Venable (2013) called for an inquiry to understand the influence of technostress on employees\u2019 wellness. Employee\u2019s well-being as an important employee-level outcome has not been studied as a social consequence of technology that leaves a notable gap in the literature. To fill this void, this study mainly establishes the relationship between techno-stressors and employees\u2019 well-being separately to deepen the understanding.\nWhen organizations implement a new technological-based system or upgrade the existing systems, they introduce interventions to help employees work on a new system (RaguNathan et al., 2008). The organizational efforts address two important aspects: technical and psychological. The technical aspect covers the technical competencies that enable employees to work efficiently on a new system. The psychological aspect prepares employees to accept new technology, and it also covers the social support provided to an employee to work on a new system. These planned interventions are techno-stress inhibitors that help employees develop technical competencies to cope with stress stemming from technology (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). Thus, this study also explains the moderating role of technostress inhibitors in techno-stressors and employees\u2019 well-being. We conducted this study in the banking sector of Pakistan. Earlier studies could not generalize to Pakistani organizations because of differences in technology level and workforce characteristics. The banking sector of Pakistan is suitable to study the phenomena under investigation. This sector has undergone major reforms by introducing the new technological-based banking system.\nThe rest of this manuscript comprises four sections. The second section offers the hypotheses. The third section discusses the research method employed to test the hypotheses. The fourth section presents the findings of the study. The last section discusses the study\u2019s results and implications for theory and practice. The manuscript ends with some suggestions for future inquiry."

This model posits that occupational stress results from the imbalances between the individual\u2019s job demands and the resources he/she is provided to meet job demands. Job demands refer to \u201cphysical, social, or organizational characteristics of a job that require sustained physical or mental effort and therefore associated with psychological and physiological costs\u201d (Bakker et al. 2005, p. 170). Within the parlance of the job demands-resources model, the technostressors are the job demands that are the characteristics of jobs in the modern workplace. The job resources are \u201cphysical, psychological, social or organizational aspects of the job that (a) are functional in achieving work goals, (b) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs, or (c) stimulate personal growth and development\u201d (Bakker et al. 2005, p. 170). Technostress inhibitors such as literacy facilitation, technical support provision, and involvement facilitation are the organizational mechanisms expected to reduce techno-stressors\u2019 negative effects on employees\u2019 well-being."

            "text": "Techno-stressors refer to the causes that create stress in an organization\u2019s environment because of information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Tarafdar et al., 2010). ICTs create stress in different ways (Ayyagari et al., 2011). Earlier researchers presented five technology-related factors that cause technostress; techno-overload, techno-invasion, technouncertainty, techno-complexity, and techno-insecurity (RaguNathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2010). Techno-overload refers to the situations which compel employees to work faster and longer (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2014). Techno-invasion creates a blurring of boundaries between work and personal life perspectives; because individuals feel continuously connected (Tarafdar et al., 2010). Because of technology, employees feel they can be reached and contacted anytime (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). Techno-complexity means employees cannot manage the complexity of the new technology. They feel a lack of computer skills that force them to spend more time learning and understanding new technology (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2014). Techno-insecurity relates to the state in which employees fear being substituted by experienced people with greater ICT skills. Because of continuous changes in hardware and software, the situation becomes very uncertain for employees and refers to techno-uncertainty. Employees feel organizations move from one cycle to another with reduced time between systems upgrades, leaving them unsettled (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008).\nTechnostress Inhibitors An organization\u2019s survival depends on its ability to adopt new technology. Technology implementation is not simple as it changes the social performance, distresses persons and groups in the organization (Nelson, 1990). An organization invests resources in helping its employees to cope with the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 821446\ntechnical and social changes arising because of introducing new technology. Technostress inhibitors are such organizational resources/mechanisms that reduce the technostress among employees (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). Technostress inhibitors comprise literacy facilitation, technical support provision, and involvement facilitation. Literacy facilitation is defined as a mechanism to share ICT-related knowledge within an organization through professional training or documentation (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2021). Technical support provision refers to technical support provided to users to solve technology-related problems (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2011). Involvement facilitation is defined as keeping the individual informed about the rationale of introducing new technology, involving them in system introduction to progress and application (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2011)."

            "text": "Well-being is a subjective concept and refers to an individual\u2019s overall evaluation of his/her quality of life depending on his/her standards and emotional experience (Diener, 2000; de Jong, 2014). It is a state of individual being characterized by good health or wellness and comfort, home life, and personal prosperity (Seligman, 2011). It refers to the overall excellence of an employee\u2019s familiarity and functioning at work. It creates an environment that encourages a state of satisfaction and permits an employee to flourish and achieve his/her full potential to benefit himself/herself and the organization (Grant et al., 2007; Sarfraz et al., 2020). Well-being encompasses two aspects; subjective experience of happiness and realization of personal achievement and self-actualization (Bayhan Karapinar et al., 2020). Changes in the individuals\u2019 situations or circumstances, including their work context, affect their well-being. Employers are increasingly adopting measures that promote the health and well-being of their employees. Organizations have accepted that the work environment can encourage or strengthen good working practices and routine varieties positively contribute to employees\u2019 physical and psychological well-being. For example, an effort to promote job quality that permits employees more control, independence, and participation positively contributes to employees\u2019 well-being (Coats and Lekhi, 2008; Ajaz et al., 2020)."

            "text": "In the fast-changing environment, organizations continuously upgrade their work-related technology for survival. Though introducing new technology enhances work efficiency, it also negatively affects employees. Because of the new technological system, employees experience system crashes, face data transfer errors, and poor technical support that cause frustration and create stress. Further, organizational efforts to urge employees to fulfill tasks rapidly and work for a longer time cause frustration among employees (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). This implies that techno-stressors negatively affect employees\u2019 well-being. For example, because of techno-overload, employees work for long hours and faster to fulfill their job demands (Fisher and Wesolkowski, 1999). Techno-invasion is when technology forces\nemployees to deal with work issues even when they are at home and keeps them attached to their work and organization. Techno-complexity requires employees to invest more time and effort to learn new technological work procedures at work or during their time (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). Investing extra time and effort drains employees\u2019 resources reservoir that negatively affects their well-being (Ma et al., 2021). Techno-insecurity and techno-uncertainty promote feelings of fear and insecurity among employees.\nThe fear of job loss reduces employees\u2019 confidence to work with new technology, leading to anxiety and frustration (Tarafdar et al., 2011). Techno-stressors are the job demands related to the use of technology that individuals find unable to meet and leaving adverse effects on their well-being (Tarafdar et al., 2019). Employees unable to meet job demands during normal working hours have to work for late hours to fulfill their job demands. Work-related activities beyond the normal working hours take time away from their leisure and relaxing activities and shorten time to recover from work-related stress (Atasanoff and Venable, 2013). Besides, the job demands-resources model and the effort-recovery model (Meijman and Mulder, 1998) provide theoretical explanations of the negative relationships between techno-stressors and well-being. This model also states that employees facing tough work conditions spend excessive time and energy at work, leaving little time to engage in activities that help them recover from stress work-related stress (Deng and Gao, 2017; Bayhan Karapinar et al., 2020; Abdullah et al., 2021). Therefore, we expect that techno-stressors negatively affect employees\u2019 well-being.\nH1: Techno-stressors (techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, and techno-uncertainty) have significant and negative effects on employees\u2019 well-being.\nTechnostress Inhibitors and Employee\u2019s"

The managers construct some model demonstration and make plans for practice (Kupersmith, 1992). During the application of complex systems, systematic workload reduction sometimes gives to employees to study and practice on a new system (Brod, 1984). Similarly, the users\u2019 involvement in system planning and implementation phases is another mechanism for reducing the stress (Brod, 1984). By welcoming the individuals to join the discussion on how new applications can be executed and integrating their requirements into system design increases their confidence in the new system. Helping employees to become familiar with new applications reduces the stress among them and increases their well-being (Nelson, 1990). Earlier research also showed that technostress inhibitors have a positive role and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 821446\nFIGURE 1 | The research framework.\nlessen stressors\u2019 effects (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2021).

            "text": "As already discussed, technostress inhibitors are the organizational resources that reduce or inhibit techno-stressors\u2019 outcomes (Ma et al., 2021). These technostress inhibitors work as boundary conditions to reduce the effects of techno-stressors on employees\u2019 well-being. They encompass mechanisms like providing system-related technical training to employees, helping employees to troubleshoot the problems, and involving them in designing and implementing systems that can ensure the successful implementation and execution of the new system. These are confidence-building measures that increase employees\u2019 confidence in new systems and organizations. These make it easier to use and lead to positive job appraisals among individuals. Therefore, on one side, they positively contribute toward employee-level outcomes. They also offer that much potential that can neutralize the negative effects of techno-stressors on employee-related outcomes (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). Earlier research has used the composite scores of techno-stressors and technostress inhibitors to determine their joint effects on outcomes. This approach hinders the segregation\nof the effects. Thus, to deepen the understanding, this study will determine the dimensional joint effects of techno-stressors and technostress inhibitors on employees\u2019 well-being. Thus, we hypothesize that;\nH3: Technostress inhibitors (literacy facilitation, technical support provision, and involvement facilitation) moderate the relationship between techno-stressors (techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, and techno-uncertainty) and employee\u2019s well-being, such that their join effects will be positive on employee\u2019s well-being when technostress inhibitors are high and vice versa (Figure 1)."

We tested discriminant validity by comparing the squared roots of AVE scores with paired correlation coefficients (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The comparison revealed that squared roots of AVE scores were greater than paired correlation coefficients that confirmed the discriminant validity.\nAs for reliability, we obtained composite reliability and Cronbach\u2019s Alpha scores.

This technique allows defining the hierarchy and computing the variance accounted for each set of predictors. Before running the moderated multiple regression analysis, we computed the interaction terms of predictors (techno-stressors) and moderators (technostress inhibitors) using their standardized scores. The interaction term based on standardized scores of the predictor and moderator minimizes the possibility of multicollinearity (Aiken and West, 1991). We run a four-step hierarchical procedure to test the hypotheses. First, we entered the control variables in the model.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 821446\nSecond, we entered the predictors (techno-stressors). Third, we entered the technostress inhibitors. Fourth, we entered the model\u2019s interaction terms of the predictors and moderators.\nThe results of a four-step moderated multiple regression model are shown in Table 3. The first step results showed that gender (\u03b2 = 0.113, ns) and experience (\u03b2 = 0.132, ns) did not significantly influence the employee\u2019s well-being. Respondents\u2019 age significantly but negatively affected employees\u2019 well-being (\u03b2 =\u22120.208, p < 0.01). The control variables accounted for 3.9% of the employees\u2019 being variance.\nThe results of the second step showed that all five predictors; techno-overload (\u03b2 = \u22120.169, p < 0.01), technoinvasion (\u03b2 = \u22120.118, p < 0.01), techno-complexity (\u03b2 = \u22120.153, p < 0.01), techno-insecurity (\u03b2 = \u22120.174, p < 0.01), and techno-uncertainty (\u03b2 = \u22120.095, p < 0.01) significantly and negatively influenced the employee\u2019s well-being. The techno-stressors accounted for 35.6% of the total employee variance. The results of the third step showed that two of the three technostress inhibitors produced significant and positive effects on employees\u2019 well-being. Literacy facilitation (\u03b2 = 0.106, p < 0.01) and technical support provision (\u03b2 = 0.138, p < 0.01) significantly and positively affected the employee\u2019s wellbeing. However, involvement facilitation did not show a significant effect (\u03b2 = 0.012, ns) on employees\u2019 well-being. Technostress inhibitors explained 5.6% of the variance in employees\u2019 well-being.\nThe results of the fourth step showed that out of fifteen possible moderating effects, nine moderating effects are significant. Further, out of nine significant moderating effects, six are positive, and three are negative, contrary to the expectations. Literacy facilitation (\u03b2 = 0.092, p < 0.05) and technical support provision (\u03b2 = 0.134, p < 0.01) combined with techno-overload significantly and positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. Techno-invasion joined with literacy facilitation (\u03b2 = 0.105, p < 0.01) significantly and positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. Techno-invasion combined with involvement facilitation significantly but negatively (\u03b2 = \u22120.068, p < 0.05) affected the employee\u2019s well-being. Techno-complexity combined with literacy facilitation (\u03b2 = 0.089, p < 0.05) and technical support (\u03b2 = 0.079, p < 0.05) significantly and positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. Techno-insecurity and literacy facilitation conjointly positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being (\u03b2 = 0.062, p < 0.01).

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "This section presents the outcomes of the study\u2019s findings in terms of theoretical and practical implications. We formulated the direct and moderating effects hypotheses on the premise of the job demands-resources model (Bakker et al., 2003,\n2005). The first set of direct hypotheses was about technostressors\u2019 effects on employees\u2019 well-being. The techno-stressors are the job demands arising from upgrading or implementing a new technology system. The results showed that all five techno-stressors, such as techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, and techno-uncertainty, negatively affected employees\u2019 well-being. Our study\u2019s results are consistent with the job demands-resources model (Bakker et al., 2005) and results of previous studies (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008: Tarafdar et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2021). These results imply employees suffer most from technological changes in the organizations.\nThe second set of hypotheses was regarding the direct effects of technostress inhibitors on employees\u2019 well-being. The technostress inhibitors are the resources provided by an organization to its employees to cope and work with new technological systems. The results showed that technostress inhibitors such as literacy facilitation and technical support provision have significantly and positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. The results are fully in line with the theoretical lens of the job demands-resources model (Bakker et al., 2005) and findings of the earlier studies (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008: Tarafdar et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2021). The results imply that technostress inhibitors, as organizational resources, positively contribute toward employees\u2019 well-being.\nIn testing the third set of hypotheses regarding the moderating effects of technostress inhibitors on technostressors and employees\u2019 well-being, we tested fifteen possible interaction effects based on individual dimensions of technostressors and technostress inhibitors. The results showed that of the fifteen possible moderating effects, we found nine significant moderating effects. Of these significant effects, six interaction terms were positive and supported the hypothesized relationships. Among three technostress inhibitors, literacy facilitation combined with techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity, and techno insecurity positively affected employees\u2019 well-being. The results imply that building and improving employee competence through training programs is the most effective mechanism to build employees\u2019 confidence in new technology (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2014), resulting in improved well-being. In combination with technooverload and techno-complexity, technical support provision positively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. The results imply technical support provides assurance to employees to solve their system-related problems and increases their comfort level with a new system (Tarafdar et al., 2014). In combination with techno-invasion and techno-insecurity, involvement facilitation negatively affected the employee\u2019s well-being. The results are complex, but these may hold in a power distance society like Pakistan. The possible explanation of the negative moderating effect of involvement facilitation on techno-invasion and employees\u2019 well-being could be that employees might have felt over-involved, leading to frustration and exhaustion. When a new system is implemented, employees already feel insecure because of a lack of competence. Employee involvement could increase their fear of insecurity because they might feel that their competence is judged for the new system. The same also holds\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 821446\nfor the negative joint effect of techno-insecurity and technical support provision."

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "This study determined the effects of techno-stressors on employees\u2019 well-being. It also explained the role of technostress inhibitors to buffer the negative effects of techno-stressors on employees\u2019 well-being. The time-lagged data (3-month apart) were collected from banking employees. The results supported the negative effects of techno-stressors on employees\u2019 well-being. The results also supported technostress inhibitors\u2019 direct and moderating roles in employees\u2019 well-being, with few exceptions. The results showed that technology causes anxiety and fear of insecurity among employees, negatively affecting their wellbeing. Organizations can help employees cope with anxiety and fear and build their confidence and competence to work on a new system by providing resources. In the end, we offered implications of the findings regarding theory and practice. We concluded our study by suggesting some promising areas for future researchers.\nStudy Implications This study significantly contributes to theory and practice. Our study complements and extends the job demands-resources model (Bakker et al., 2003, 2005) and technostress literature (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Tarafdar et al., 2011, 2014, 2019; Ma et al., 2021). We established direct and indirect effects hypotheses based on the premise of the job demands-resources model. Our study extended the job demands-resources model and technostress literature by explaining the effects of technostressors on employee well-being that earlier studies overlooked. Second, we included all five techno-stressors in our model and segregated their effects on well-being. We expect our study to strengthen the understanding and provide a detailed picture to explain which techno-stressor is crucial for employees\u2019 well-being. For example, the individual effects of technostressors showed that the magnitudes of techno-insecurity, techno-overload, and techno-complexity are high. Implementing new technology heightens feelings of insecurity, followed by information overload and system complexity.\nSimilarly, we also explained technostress inhibitors\u2019 direct effects on employees\u2019 well-being and moderating effects on techno-stressors and employees\u2019 well-being. Our direct effects results showed that literacy facilitation and technical support provision showed significant and positive effects that suggest that training and technical support are crucial for a new system\u2019s success (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2021). The moderating effects showed that literacy facilitation played a significant role in helping employees cope with technostress that increased the employee\u2019s well-being. These findings are important for managers to understand that they should arrange system-related training programs to improve employees\u2019 competence. After literacy facilitation, technical support provision neutralized the negative effects of techno-stressors\non employees\u2019 well-being. The managers should ensure that technical support is available to employees when working on the new system."

            "text": "Despite its value, our study is not without limitations. First, we selected a sample from one organization that could restrict the generalizability of our study. Every organization has unique technology requirements, systems, culture, and work procedures. The types and levels of technology vary from industry to industry. The sample should be taken from multiple organizations for better generalization of the results. Some countries have high technology infrastructure and technology acceptance and usage compared to others. We invite future researchers to conduct cross-cultural studies comparing high and low-tech countries. Second, we suggest extending our model by taking employees\u2019 well-being as a mediating mechanism of workrelated behavioral outcomes, such as performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, and counter-productive work behaviors. Besides employees\u2019 well-being, future researchers should explore other mediating mechanisms to offer an alternative explanation. Third, our study included organizational resources (technostress inhibitors) as mechanisms to cope with technostress. Besides organizational resources, personal-level and peer-level resources should be explored to buffer the negative effects of technostressors on outcomes under investigation. Fourth, involvement facilitation in our study did not provide the expected potential. Though, we understand that this could be because of sample homogeneity. We could also ascribe this to a national cultural context like in a power distance society like Pakistan, where endusers are just informed about the decisions. This could be one of the reasons that employees do not show disagreement with their managers and approve whatever top management has decided. We invite future researchers to conduct cross-cultural studies to understand the culture-specific nature."
