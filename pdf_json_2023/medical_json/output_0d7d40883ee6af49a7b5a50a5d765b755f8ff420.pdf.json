Hydroboration is one of the simplest methods for the synthesis of a wide array of organoboranes. Typically, these reactions are promoted by precious transition metal complexes based on rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, platinum and others; however, an increasing focus on the application of cheaper and more Earth-abundant alternatives such as first-row transition metals2 and main group elements3 has recently been observed. In particular, boron Lewis acids have sparked growing attention (Scheme 1). For example, Hoshi described that dicyclohexylborane and 9-borabicyclo (3.3.1)nonane (9-BBN) can catalyse regioselective cis-hydroboration of alkynes with HBcat (catecholborane) at ambient temperature.4 Thomas reported that simple, commercially available borane adducts, H3B\u00b7THF and H3B\u00b7SMe2, can be\nused as effective catalysts for the hydroboration of alkynes and alkenes with HBpin (pinacolborane),5 and Okuda demonstrated that alkali metal hydridotriphenylborate complexes [(Me6TREN)M][HBPh3] (Me6TREN = tris{2-(dimethylamino) ethyl}amine) can serve as efficient catalysts for the hydroboration of a broad range of substrates with carbonyl groups.6 One area that has gained particular attention is where fluorinated aryl borates such as tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] 7 or Piers\u2019 borane [HB(C6F5)2] are used as pre-catalysts. 8 We and Oestreich have later developed the use of other borane catalysts including tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane,9 tris (2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)borane,10 and tris(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl) borane11 as effective catalysts for a range of hydroboration reactions. In these cases, the catalytic activity was generally found to be higher than that of the archetypical B(C6F5)3 catalyst.\nEarlier this year, we reported the synthesis of a range of fluorinated triaryl borates [B(OArF)3] with varying Lewis acidity, prepared by reacting various fluorophenols with BCl3.\n12 This concept stems from Britovsek\u2019s findings that the introduction of an O-atom spacer between the boron atom in B(C6F5)3 and the C6F5-aryl ring increases the Lewis acidity of the borate\nScheme 1 Boron-based hydroboration catalysis. \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

The borates prepared included B(OArF)3 (Ar\nF = 2-FC6H4, 3-FC6H4, 4-FC6H4, 2,3-F2C6H3, 2,6-F2C6H3, 3,5-F2C6H3, 2,3,4-F3C6H2, 3,4,5- F3C6H2, 2,3,5,6-F4C6H, and C6F5) (compounds 1b\u2013k, respectively). We also prepared two new borates B(OArx)3 (Ar\nX = 2,6- Cl2C6H3 1l and 2-(CF3)C6H4 1m) for comparison. The rationale for this is that, in previous studies, the steric and electronic effects of the functional groups at the ortho-position were found to influence the efficacy of the pre-catalyst.9,11 These two new compounds could be recrystallised and characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1).\nThe Lewis acidity of the two new boranes was then determined by both experimental and computational methods. Using the Gutmann\u2013Beckett (GB) Lewis acidity test,14 the 31P NMR chemical shifts (\u03b4 ppm) of the Et3PvO \u2192 B(OAr\nx)3 adducts were 78.9 and 78.7 ppm for 1l and 1m, respectively. The change in the 31P NMR chemical shift between the free phosphine oxide (\u03b4 = 52.5 ppm) and the adduct (\u0394\u03b4) was determined to be 26.4 (1l) and 26.2 ppm (1m). Computational studies15 at the M06-2X+D3(0)/def2-QZVPP level of theory gave fluoride ion affinities (FIAs) of 336 (1l) and 400 (1m) kJ mol\u22121, and hydride ion affinities (HIA) of 317 (1l) and 381 (1m) kJ mol\u22121. Finally, the Lewis acidity was also determined using the global electrophilicity index (GEI),16 which gave values of 1.31 (1l) and 1.39 (1m) eV. In comparison to previously reported\nborates, 1l has the lowest Lewis acidity of the series when considering Gutmann\u2013Beckett, HIA and FIA values, for example in comparison to the weakly Lewis acidic borate, B(OPh)3 (GB: \u0394\u03b4 = 23.0 ppm, FIA: 350 kJ mol\u22121, and HIA: 323 kJ mol\u22121). On the other hand, 1m shows higher Lewis acidity than previously reported ortho-substituted borates from Gutmann\u2013Beckett, FIA and HIA [i.e., B(O(2-FC6H4))3 has GB: \u0394\u03b4 = 23.8 ppm, FIA: 351 kJ mol\u22121, HIA: 339 kJ mol\u22121], and comparable Lewis acidity to the most Lewis acidic borates, B(O(3,4,5-F3C6H2))3 and B(OC6F5)3.\n12 The GEI Lewis acidity metric is intrinsic, and considers the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap rather than the coordination to an external probe and, from this, both 1l and 1m fall within the range of the reported values for F-substituted borates (GEI: 0.88\u20131.45 eV).12 This suggests that the larger chlorine substituents at both the ortho-positions in 1l hinder adduct formation over intrinsic factors significantly more than the previously explored fluorine substituents. However, higher Lewis acidity is observed for 1m with an ortho-CF3 group, which has comparable size to chlorine, from both intrinsic and extrinsic metrics, suggesting that the electronic effects of the electronwithdrawing CF3 group outweigh steric effects.\nWith a range of borate catalysts in hand, we were interested in understanding their comparative reactivity in the hydroboration reaction of unsaturated substrates. We began our investigations using styrene (2a) as the model substrate and HBpin as the hydroboration reagent under neat conditions, and measured the isolated yield (3a) of the borylated product\nFig. 1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures of 1l (top) and 1m (bottom).

Using these conditions, we found that the first set of conditions (a) gave the poorest overall results with the catalysts giving yields from 29% (1i) to 67% (1b). Upon changing the HBpin equivalents to 2, increasing the reaction temperature to 80 \u00b0C, and the time to 48 h (conditions (c)), the yields predictably increased for all catalysts (range: 69% (1g) to 96% (1e)) whilst keeping the catalyst loading the same. However, when we reduced the catalyst loading to 2 mol% or 5 mol% while keeping the other conditions the same (conditions (b) and (c), respectively), the yields expectedly decreased to 52% (1i)\u201375% (1f ), but were not as low as those under the initial set of conditions (a) with the exception of catalysts 1a and 1g. While very good yields are obtained for conditions (d), we chose to use conditions (b) as the standard conditions for examining the catalysts in the hydroboration of other substrates as these allowed for better differentiation between the different activities of the catalysts.\nWith these conditions in hand, we investigated different catalysts in the hydroboration of other substrates to compare their catalytic activity (Table 2). Initially, two further alkenes were trialed including the electron-deficient 4-fluorostyrene (2b) and electron-rich 4-methoxystyrene (2c). For all catalysts, the yields increased when using the electron-deficient substrate 2b (range: 58% (1a) to 81% (1m) versus 52% (1i) to 75% (1f )). Conversely, the yields were generally lower with the more electron-rich substrate 2c than those with 2b (range: 44% (1e) to 81% (1m)). These results are interesting as other Lewis acidic boranes such as tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] borane were previously found to give trace products with substrate 2c.9\nFollowing this, we investigated the catalysts for the hydroboration of alkynes including electron-neutral phenyl acetylene (4a), electron-deficient 1-ethynyl-4-fluorobenzene (4b), and electron-rich 4-ethynylanisole (4c). For all substrates, the catalysts mostly performed better with the alkyne substrates (4) than the alkene substrates (2). When looking at the catalysts, the least Lewis acidic borate B(OPh)3 (1a) performed the poorest. The other borates, however, showed little trend between their Lewis acidity and their yield for the reaction. It was noticed, that the catalysts that had ortho-F atoms including B(O(2-FC6H4))3 (1b), B(O(2,6-F2C6H3))3 (1f ), B(O(2,3,4F3C6H2))3 (1h), and B(O(2,3,5,6-F4C6H))3 (1j) tended to perform better, showing higher yields for the majority of the reactions. Conversely, borates with no ortho-F atoms showed poorer activity including B(O(4-FC6H4))3 (1d), B(O(3,5-F2C6H3))3 (1g), and B(O(3,4,5-F3C6H2))3 (1i). Interestingly, by including orthoCl atoms, as in B(O(2,6-Cl2C6H3))3 (1l), the yield decreased relative to the fluorinated derivative 1f. The ortho-CF3 derivative B(O(2-(CF3)C6H4))3 (1m), on the other hand, gave very good yields for several substrates (2b, 2c, and 4b).\nOestreich proposed the formation of intermediary hydroboranes [HnBAr F 3\u2212n]2 and [(Ar\nF)(H)B(\u03bc-H)2BArF2] as the active catalytic species when using tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]borane.9 We similarly investigated the stoichiometric reactions between 1b and HBpin and found full conversion of both reagents to form 2 new species as revealed in the 1H NMR spectrum (see the ESI\u2020). We hypothesise that the formation of a catalytically active hydroborate species is stabilised by ortho-fluorine substituents on the borates, and this accounts for their higher activity. Importantly, a control experiment with TMEDA suggested no involvement of B2H6, which may catalyse the reaction through \u201chidden boron catalysis\u201d (see the ESI\u2020).17\nUsing one of the best catalysts, B(O(2,3,5,6-F4C6H))3 (1j), we investigated a small scope of aliphatic, aromatic, and internal and terminal alkene or alkyne substrates (Scheme 2). Styrene derivatives (2a,b) worked well but a lower yield was observed with a p-OMe substituent (2c) generating 3c in, 48% yield.\nThe 1,1-disubstituted alkenes \u03b1-methyl styrene (2d) and 1,1- diphenylethylene (2e) also reacted well giving the hydroborated products 3d and 3e in 56% and 67% yields, respectively. The cyclic alkenes cyclooctene (2f ) and indene (2g) also reacted very well giving products 3f (75%) and 3g (72%) in high yields. The terminal phenyl acetylenes gave excellent product yields of 70\u201386% for 5a\u2013c and 5h. The internal aliphatic alkynes but-2yne (4d), oct-4-yne (4e), and diphenylacetylene (4f ) also reacted well giving the hydroborated products in 83% (5d), 79% (5e), and 64% (5f ) yields, respectively. On the other hand, 1-phenyl1-propyne (4g) gave 5g as a mixture of two regioisomers in a combined yield of 81% (major : minor = 1.6 : 1). Non-aromatic acetylenes also reacted, (prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzene (4i) and ethynylcyclohexane (4j) yielded the desired hydroborated products 5i and 5j with 72% and 71% yields, respectively.\nIn conclusion, we have reported the reactivity of a series of triaryl borates B(OArx)3 as catalysts for the hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes. The catalysts tested included commercially available B(OPh)3, previously reported fluorinated triaryl borates, and two new borates with varying ortho-substituents\nScheme 2 Hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes using B(O(2,3,5,6F4C6H))3 (1j).

Although all catalysts were active in the reaction, it was observed that there was no obvious trend between their Lewis acidity and the reaction yield. However, commercially available B(OPh)3 performed the poorest, whereas catalysts with o-F atoms appeared to perform much better. One of the more active catalysts, B(O(2,3,5,6-F4C6H))3, was then trialed with a range of aliphatic, aromatic, and internal and terminal alkenes or alkynes."
