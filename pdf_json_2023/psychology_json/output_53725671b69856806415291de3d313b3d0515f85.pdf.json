    "abstractText": "Dextran methacrylate (Dex-MA) is a biodegradable polysaccharide derivative that can be cross-linked by ionizing radiation. It is therefore considered a potential replacement for synthetic hydrophilic polymers in current radiation technologies used for synthesizing hydrophilic cross-linked polymer structures such as hydrogels, mainly for medical applications. This work is focused on the initial steps of radiation-induced cross-linking polymerization of Dex-MA in water. Rate constants of two major transient water radiolysis products\u2014hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) and hydrated electrons (e\u2212 aq)\u2014with various samples of Dex-MA (based on 6\u2013500 kDa dextrans of molar degree of substitution or DS with methacrylate groups up to 0.66) as well as non-substituted dextran were determined by pulse radiolysis with spectrophotometric detection. It has been demonstrated that these rate constants depend on both the molecular weight and DS; reasons for these effects are discussed and reaction mechanisms are proposed. Selected spectral data of the transient species formed by \u2022OHand e\u2212 aq-induced reactions are used to support the discussion. The kinetic data obtained in this work and their interpretation are expected to be useful for controlled synthesis of polysaccharide-based hydrogels and nanogels of predefined structure and properties.",

            "text": "Ionizing radiation has been long recognized as a useful tool for cross-linking polymers [1\u20133]. Numerous large-scale technologies based on this idea have been developed and continue to be used in industrial practice [4]. Versatility of radiation technology allows us to perform cross-linking not only in the solid state but also in solution. In particular, irradiation of hydrophilic polymers in water is a simple way to synthesize hydrogels. Here, cross-linking (gel formation) can be combined in one technological step with sterilization, making this approach particularly suitable for synthesizing hydrogel-based biomaterials and medical products, such as hydrogel wound dressings [5\u20137]. While this technology has been employed for many years and the products\u2014based on radiation-cross-linked synthetic polymers of excellent biocompatibility\u2014have a well-established position on the market, emerging trends and customer expectations stimulate new developments in this field. One of them is focused on replacing synthetic polymers with those based on natural and renewable resources. While successful attempts have been made in cross-linking various biobased compound and structures, including proteins [8], one of the main research trends, stimulated by potential applications, is to seek solutions allowing the use of ionizing radiation to synthesize cross-linked structures based on polysaccharides. Research on the influence of ionizing radiation on polysaccharides has been conducted since the 1950s [9\u201311]. Basically, polysaccharides are known as polymers that undergo mainly degradation upon exposure to ionizing radiation. Reduction in molecular weight\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4231. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28104231 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4231 2 of 17\nis predominantly caused by the scission of glycosidic bonds present between repeating units. Degradation occurs both when irradiation is performed in the solid state and in the aqueous solution [12\u201315]. This phenomenon is industrially exploited in order, for instance, to improve solubility or control-reduce molecular weight for specific applications [15]. Nevertheless, a cross-linking reaction may be present or even predominate over scission of polymer chains during exposure to ionizing radiation. Under certain conditions of irradiation and in the presence of additives\u2014participating or mediating in the cross-linking, molecular weight of the polysaccharide can increase, moreover an insoluble fraction\u2014the gel\u2014can be formed [16,17]. Efficient cross-linking of polysaccharides by ionizing radiation without cross-linking agents was first demonstrated by Yoshii and coworkers, who described radiation-induced cross-linking of cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropyl or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) processed in highly concentrated aqueous solutions, resulting in stable hydrogels with covalent bonds linking polysaccharide chains [18,19]. While handling and deoxygenating highly viscous, concentrated polysaccharide solutions may be difficult, it has been subsequently proved that CMC can be radiation-cross-linked or even in dilute solutions when certain conditions are met [20]. Other examples demonstrate additive-free radiation cross-linking of chitin and chitosan derivatives [21,22], leading to the formation of materials to be used in the field of regenerative medicine [23\u201326]. In general, cross-linked polysaccharides seem to be a perfect starting material for the design of numerous future applications in the field of biomaterials. Many polysaccharides have excellent biocompatibility, are non-toxic and biodegradable. One of them is dextran\u2014 a bacterially derived homopolysaccharide, included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, with a long-standing record of medical applications. Dextran contains a large amount of hydroxyl group present in sugar residual, where hydrogen atoms can be replaced by numerous substituents. This approach allows the introduction different functional moieties into chemical structure, yielding dextran derivatives with specific properties, which can be further engineered to design and obtain a variety of microstructural forms such as fibers, scaffolds or hydrogels, with potential application in the field of tissue regeneration [27,28]. In our recent study, we focused on dextran methacrylate (Dex-MA), which, due to the presence of a polymerizable methacrylic group (-MA), is capable of forming biocompatible, insoluble macroscopic hydrogels at low doses of ionizing radiation [29]. Another successful application of radiation for cross-linking of dextran methacrylate and hyaluronan methacrylate cryogels has been demonstrated by Reichelt and coworkers [30\u201333]. Therefore, radiation technology seems to be a versatile, additive-free and clean tool to produce chemically cross-linked, biocompatible hydrogels based on methacrylated polysaccharides.\nThe structure of Dex and the methacrylate moieties are shown in Figure 1.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 19\nResearch on the influence of ionizing radiation on polysaccharides has been conducted since the 1950s [9\u201311].

Another successful application of radiation for cross-linking of dextran methacrylate and hyaluronan methacrylate cryogels has been demonstrated by Reichelt and coworkers [30\u201333]. Therefore, radiation technology seems to be a versatile, additive-free and clean tool to produce chemically cross-linked, biocompatible hydrogels based on methacrylated polysaccharides.\nThe structure of ex and the ethacrylate oieties are sho n in Figure 1.\nThe present report describes basic studies on radiolysis of dextrans (Dex) and dextran methacrylates with various degree of substitution (DS) with MA moieties and a wide range of initial molecular weight of the parent polysaccharide in aqueous solutions. These studies were performed by pulse radiolysis with spectrophotometric detection, using both a direct approach and competition kinetics. The focus of this work is the kinetics of the first step of Dex-MA radiolysis in water, namely, its reactions with the main transient products of water radiolysis, i.e., hydroxyl radicals and hydrated electrons. We aimed at determining the dependencies\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4231 3 of 17\nof the respective rate constants on the average molecular weight and degree of substitution (including non-substituted substrates), and thus identifying the role played by the MA moiety in the overall reactivity of Dex-MA under irradiation and formulating the general mechanism of radiation-induced reactions in aqueous Dex-MA solutions, in the context of the following polymerization and cross-linking steps. We hope that these results will be helpful for the rational design of radiation synthesis of new cross-linked polysaccharide-based products, particularly hydrogels and nanogels for medical applications."

            "text": "Essentially, in the radiolysis of dilute aqueous solutions of a polysaccharide, polymerderived radicals are formed as a consequence of reaction with initial products of water radiolysis. When the aqueous solution of polymer is irradiated, most of the supplied energy is absorbed by water molecules leading to the formation of wide range of very reactive water-derived radicals, as follows [13,34\u201337].\nH2O \u2192 \u2022OH + e\u2212aq + H\u00b7 + H+ + H2 + H2O2\nThe main products are hydroxyl radicals, hydrated electrons and hydrogen atoms, which, in typical conditions of gamma-ray or electron beam irradiation, are formed with radiation-chemical yields of 0.28, 0.28 and 0.06 \u00b5mol/J, respectively. Hydrated electrons are relatively unreactive towards unsubstituted sugars and polysaccharides containing no carbonyl bonds. This usually manifests itself by the fact that the decay rate of hydrated electrons in water is not significantly accelerated by addition of these substrates. In contrast, hydroxyl radicals are known to react with sugars at a considerably high rate constant (e.g., for \u2022OH reaction with glucose k = 1.5 \u00d7 109 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 and with saccharose k = 2.3 \u00d7 109 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 [35]) by abstracting hydrogens from carbon atoms, thus leading to the formation of carbon-centered radicals. Selectivity of \u2022OH attack is usually low. H atoms participate in analogous reactions, albeit typically at a lower rate, and since their yield is also much lower than that of \u2022OH, H-atom reactions are often neglected in kinetic and product analysis, at least when irradiation is performed in solutions of neutral pH. Carbon-centered radicals resulting from \u2022OH attack in the absence of oxygen undergo transformations leading mostly to scission of glycosidic bonds (and thus to degradation and reduction of molecular weight). More detailed description of radiation-induced reactions in typical non-modified polysaccharides can be found elsewhere [12,13,38]. Cross-linking of polysaccharides under irradiation (in the absence of such additives as cross-linking agents or synthetic polymers) requires the presence of at least a moderate number of particular functional groups capable of promoting radical recombination or propagation. In carboxymethylcellulose and other carboxymethylated polysaccharides, this role is played by the methylene group; radicals located there can undergo cross-linking [20\u201324,39,40]. In methacrylated hyaluronate or dextran, methacrylate groups are expected to undergo polymerization when suitable initiation is provided by irradiation. Our recent study indicates that irradiation of aqueous solutions of Dex-MA results in very efficient hydrogel formation at low irradiation doses [29]. This is expected to be both due to efficient initiation and propagation steps. In the following sections, the kinetics of initiation (formation of Dex-MA radicals) are studied in some detail, in order to determine whether and how two main products of water radiolysis, \u2022OH and e\u2212aq, react with the methacrylated dextran derivatives and what the influence of initial molecular weight of Dex and DS of Dex-MA on the rate constant of these reactions is."

            "text": "While this study is manly focused on the kinetics of \u2022OH and e\u2212aq reactions with Dex and Dex-MA, besides discussing the kinetics-related results we also consider some spectral data collected in our experiments; these two approaches allow us to present some general remarks regarding the mechanism of main reactions taking place in the studied system. Hydroxyl radicals are known to react with non-modified carbohydrates by hydrogen abstraction, thus generating C-centered hydroxyalkyl-type radicals. Selectivity of the \u2022OH attack on sugars is low, thus one may assume that these radicals are generated randomly at various positions. The rate constants of this reaction for low-molecular-weight sugars is in the order of k = 2 \u00d7 109 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 ([35], see above). As it is usually observed both for synthetic and natural polymers, the rate constants of their reactions with \u2022OH radicals in dilute aqueous solutions are typically lower than those for corresponding low-molecularweight analogues, which is at least in part caused by the change of reaction geometry (polymer coils separated by large \u201cvoid\u201d volumes of water vs. relatively homogeneously distributed small molecules; this influences the average diffusion distance of \u2022OH, which is to be crossed, to reach the macromolecule), lower mobility of monomer units when embedded into a long chain and also steric hindrance. It should be mentioned that, even within the dilute concentration regime, the rate constant of \u2022OH reaction with a polymer does depend both on its concentration and molecular weight. When defined in dm3 per second and mol of monomer units, this rate constants decreases with increasing molecular weight. The amplitude of this effect for flexible chains, such as poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone), may amount to reducing the rate constant by one order of magnitude when moving from single monomer unit to a polymer of ca. 100 kDa. For more detailed studies and discussions on these effects, see [46\u201348]. In marked contrast to \u2022OH radicals, reactivity of hydrated electrons towards simple unsubstituted sugars, including polysaccharides, is very low, the rate constants being below k = 5 \u00d7 106 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 [35], which in practical terms means that the presence of sugar does not noticeably increase the rate of e\u2212aq decay in comparison to pure water. This is also the case of our pulse-radiolysis observations on Dex + e\u2212aq reaction, where values not exceeding k = 2\u20133 \u00d7 106 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 have been estimated (Figure 7). The presence of acrylate or methacrylate function changes the situation dramatically. Hydroxyl radicals are known to react with simple acrylates or methacrylates at a diffusion-controlled rates, by addition to the C=C bond. Exemplary rate constants are k = 1.2 \u00d7 1010 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for methyl methacrylate [35] and k = 1.5 \u00d7 1010 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for butyl acrylate [49]. Similarly, hydrated electrons have been demonstrated to react rapidly with low-molecular-weight acrylates and methacrylates (for instance, k = 1.6 \u00d7 1010 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for butyl acrylate [49], k = 1.7 \u00d7 1010 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate\u2014PEGDA 700 [50]). These reactions are the basics of the initiation step in radiation-induced polymerization of acrylate and methacrylate monomers in aqueous media, both in solution and emulsion. Here, we follow the influence of the content of methacrylate groups (defined as DS) and also the average molecular weight on the kinetics of \u2022OH and e\u2212aq reactions with dextran methacrylate. These data, supported by transient spectra and previous literature data on the reactions with low-molecular-weight methacrylates, allow us to indicate the main reactions taking place in the studied systems."

            "heading": "3.2. Reactivity of Hydroxyl Radicals with Dextran and Dextran Methacrylate",
            "text": "In the molecules of dextran methacrylate, the unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds of the methacrylate group are a favorable site for \u2022OH attack due to the high electron density and suitability for \u2022OH attachment reaction. This is reflected in the fact that the rate constant of \u2022OH reaction with methacrylate monomers is k = 1\u20132 \u00d7 1010 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 (see above), i.e., one order of magnitude higher than with glucose, which can serve as a model of single dextran unit. The former value can be assumed as an upper limit of possible rate constant of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4231 10 of 17\n\u2022OH radical and Dex-MA with increasing degree of substitution, at low molecular weight of the polymer. With increasing degree of substitution of dextran monomer units with methacrylate groups, we expect the ratio of \u2022OH radicals undergoing addition to methacrylate vs. reacting by hydrogen abstraction from dextran backbone to increase as well. This effect is indeed observed in our kinetic data. Interestingly, in the range of low DS, this dependence seems to follow simple competition rules. Assuming, on the basis of the above-cited literature data, that the rate constant of \u2022OH reaction with methacrylate is ca. 10 times higher than with a sugar monomer unit, we shall expect that incorporating 10% (mol) of methacrylate into dextran would lead to equal participation of both reaction types in the reaction with \u2022OH, thus doubling the rate constant observed for pure dextran. The experimentally observed enhancement factors for DS = 0.1 are indeed close to this expected value, with the exception of Dex6 (which, being the most difficult to purify, could have contained some low-molecular-weight impurities increasing the observed rate constant for the non-modified sample). At higher DS values we observe a deviation from this simple competition rule. While we can see constantly increasing rate constant values with increase in DS, the effect becomes moderate and the values are lower than expected from simple competition. This can be caused by changes in chain conformation caused by the presence of high amount of added side groups, both by steric effects caused by the bulkiness of these groups and by the change in intramolecular interactions between chain segments, where methacrylate units may have the tendency to associate due to their more hydrophobic properties. These effect may influence both the volume occupied by macromolecules (thus changing the diffusion properties of the solution) and the accessibility of methacrylate groups for \u2022OH radicals within the polymer coils. Another aspect worth discussing is the dependence of the rate constants on molecular weight, observed both for Dex and Dex-MA. The values of rate constant for \u2022OH attack on pure dextrans obtained here (Figure 3) are, as expected, somewhat lower than the value for glucose. Moreover, they decay with increasing molecular weight (from k = 9 \u00d7 108 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for Dex6 down to k = 3 \u00d7 108 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for Dex500, an expected trend that has been observed for other water-soluble polymers before [46,51\u201353]. The same tendency is evident from data shown in Figure 3 also for dextran methacrylates. For instance, at DS \u2248 0.5, the rate constants decrease from k = 1.6 \u00d7 109 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for Dex6 methacrylate down to k = 4 \u00d7 108 dm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 for Dex500 methacrylate. Since the \u2022OH reaction with low-molecular-weight methacrylates is diffusion controlled, the presence of molecular weight dependence for Dex-MA clearly indicates that the reaction rate of \u2022OH with methacrylated dextran is controlled by diffusion as well, but here the diffusion is governed by the micro-heterogeneous geometry of dilute polymer solution, becoming more pronounced with increase in molecular weight. The fate of carbon-centered radicals in unsubstituted polysaccharides formed as a result of \u2022OH attack in oxygen-free systems depends to some extent on their localization. Those located in the vicinity of glycosidic bonds may transform with breakage of these bonds, thus leading to chain scission and reduction of the average molecular weight. The latter effects of dextran radiolysis in dilute aqueous solutions have been known since the first studies on this topic were undertaken in 1950s [10]. Incorporation of methacrylate groups able to undergo cross-linking polymerization allows us to overcome the (usually unwanted) tendency of the polysaccharide to degrade under irradiation; cross-linking polymerization of Dex-MA is so efficient that 3D gels based on covalently cross-linked chain network are formed at irradiation doses as low as 200 Gy (J/kg) [29]. A proposed scheme of main reactions induced by \u2022OH reaction with the methacrylate group of Dex-MA is shown as Equations (6)\u2013(8). Addition of the hydroxyl radical to the C=C bond (reaction (6)) predominantly creates an \u03b1-carboxyalkyl radical/1/. The latter can add to the double bond on the same of other Dex-MA molecule, inducing a chain reaction of propagation (reaction (7), structure/2/). Since the Dex-MA molecules involved have many MA groups available, this is actually cross-linking polymerization leading to the formation of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4231 11 of 17\n3D network. Moreover, besides addition, such radicals can undergo recombination (reaction (8)), either by disproportionation or by cross-linking, leading to products/3/and/4/or/5/, respectively. These two reactions of propagating radicals are expected to be the main radical termination modes in the studied system. Other reactions of minor importance (not shown) could be, e.g., radical transfer by H-abstraction. Of course, also the radicals formed, in minor quantities, by \u2022OH attack on the Dex backbone, could participate in recombination. They also can rearrange with breakage of the glycosidic bond, a reaction which may make the dominating network formation process somewhat less efficient. On the other hand, radicals generated upon glycosidic bond scission, located at the newly formed chain end, may also contribute to the network formation, or reduce degradation effect, if reacted with C=C double bond to attach the split chain to another macromolecule.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 19\nof propagation (reaction (7), structure/2/).

Therefore, while there is no much doubt as to the character of main reactions initiated in Dex-MA system by \u2022OH radicals, featureless character of the spectra, overlay of the (similar) spectra resulting from H abstraction from the sugar backbone and from \u2022OH addition to the C=C bond of the methacrylate group and parallel occurrence of several reactions influencing absorption makes it difficult to extract more detailed information from the spectral evolution of this system. These expectations are in line with the spectra presented in Figures 4 and 5. In Figure 4 we see that the spectra for non-substituted Dex70 are totally featureless, as expected for sugar radicals formed by H-abstraction by hydroxyl radicals, while the spectra for Dex70MA0.06, in particular at 180 \u00b5s after the pulse, show a weak side absorption band at ca. 290\u2013340 nm characteristic for methacrylate adduct radicals. The amplitude of this band doesn\u2019t seem to increase strongly for higher DS values (Figure 5) which indicates that, due to much higher rate of \u2022OH addition when compared to H-abstraction, already at DS = 0.06 significant part of hydroxyl radicals react according to the former mechanism."

Therefore, while there is no much doubt as to the character of main reactions initiated in Dex-MA system by \u2022OH radicals, featureless character of the spectra, overlay of the (similar) spectra resulting from H abstraction from the sugar backbone and from \u2022OH addition to the C=C bond of the methacrylate group and parallel occurrence of several reactions influencing absorption makes it difficult to extract more detailed information from the spectral evolution of this system.

From the point of view of radiation-induced polymerization, precise differentiation between both protonation pathways is not of prime importance, since both types of resulting radicals are able to initiate polymerization. The radical anion is expected to have an absorption spectrum in the UV region, with a maximum at ca. 250\u2013280 nm. Its protonation leads to the two above-mentioned radicals which have been demonstrated on similar acrylate structures to have a spectrum rising monotonously towards low wavelength for the ketyl-type radical or/and a relatively weak spectrum with a broad maximum between 300 and 350 nm for the of \u03b1-carboxyalkyl radicals. We see that after completion of e\u2212aq reaction with Dex-MA and at least partial (at 5 \u00b5s) or complete (at 180 \u00b5s) protonation of the radical-anions the spectra of products derived from Dex-MA in fact show a broad band in the 300\u2013350 nm region, of more pronounced absorbance than non-substituted Dex. While the kinetics of protonation hasn\u2019t been studied here, it can be estimated that after 180 \u00b5s after the pulse protonation is expected to be complete and only few of the so formed radicals have already reacted by addition to other methacrylate groups (for estimation method in pulse-induced polymerization, see e.g., [57,58]), thus it is expected that most of the radicals present at that time would be the protonation products/8/and/7/, their spectra being in line with expectations based on earlier studies on radiolysis of acrylates and methacrylates. Those radicals are anticipated to participate in propagation and cross-linking reactions, similarly to transient products of \u2022OH radical reactions with methacrylate moiety, contributing to network formation. Spectra recorded at 180 \u00b5s after the pulse (Figure 10) show that in the 300\u2013350 nm range absorbance in Dex-MA solutions is stronger than in case of unsubstituted Dex. However, similarly as in the case of \u2022OH-induced reactions, there is no much difference in absorbance between Dex70-MA0.06 and Dex70-MA0.62; in both cases almost all e\u2212aq have reacted with methacrylate group and the product concentration is controlled mainly by the quantity of hydrated electrons, directly dependent on the dose, which was the same for both samples. Since we expect of \u03b1-carboxyalkyl radicals/8/to be the dominating protonation product of electron adduct in our system, the spectrum observed due to its formation should be similar to the spectrum of \u2022OH addition product/1/. In fact, the spectra observed in both cases at 5 \u00b5s and 180 \u00b5s after the pulse are of similar shape (Figure 11). Both these radicals can add to the C=C bond of another methacrylate group thus initiating propagation. Even if we assume that some single acts of propagation might have already taken place within the studied timeframe (180 \u00b5s), the propagating radicals in both cases would have the same structure and thus the same spectral properties."

            "text": "To reduce the unfavorable influence of presence of oligosaccharides and lower-molecularweight fractions, and also to remove potential low-molecular-weight impurities, all dextrans used in pulse radiolysis experiments were prepurified by dialysis against pure water. The molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the cellulose membrane was selected according to Dex initial molecular weight. A series of Dex-MA of different initial molecular weight (nominal Mr of original dextran substrate = 6, 25, 70 and 500 kDa) and a wide range of degree of substitution (DS) was synthesized using the procedure of van Dijk-Wotthuis [59]. The synthesis and characterization methods of Dex-MA are described in detail elsewhere [29]. In short, Dex-MA batches were synthesized in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide used as a solvent, in the presence of a catalysts, 4\u2013(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine with glycidyl methacrylate added in molar ratio with respect to dextran, determined for expected DS. The synthesis proceeded for 48 h under ambient gas atmosphere, and the reaction was terminated with HCl, equimolar to the catalyst. A prolonged dialysis against water was employed to purify the product prior its lyophilization. Synthesized dextran derivatives were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H\u2013NMR, Bruker Avance II 700 MHz UltraShield Plus, Karlsruhe, Germany) in order to determine degree of methacrylate substitution. The intended DS of Dex-MA series was 0.1\u20130.7, which ensures complete solubility in water. The actual values of DS obtained in synthesis of Dex-MA series are shown in Table 1. Dex-MA samples are marked in the text by the average molecular weight of the parent dextran (e.g., 500 for 500 kDa) and their DS (e.g., 0.66); samples of these parameters is coded Dex500-MA0.66."

What\u2019s more, this effective action manifests itself already for low degrees of dextran substitution with methacrylate groups (even below DS = 0.1), which is in line with previous experimental observations on very efficient hydrogel formation taking place already for low DS and low doses of radiation. Transient products of \u2022OH and e\u2212aq reactions with methacrylate double bonds and carbonyl groups, that is, radicals located at the side group of dextran derivative, undergo polymerization and recombination, thus advancing cross-linking. High cross-linking polymerization rate and efficiency at low DS values is also advantageous for the potential biomedical applications of radiation-synthesized Dex-MA hydrogels since it allows us to avoid potential biocompatibility problems, which were encountered only for gels of DS exceeding 0.8.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.J.S., R.A.W. and P.U.; methodology, K.J.S., R.A.W. and P.U.; software, K.J.S. and R.A.W.; validation, K.J.S., R.A.W. and P.U.; formal analysis, K.J.S. and R.A.W.; investigation, K.J.S. and R.A.W.; resources, R.A.W. and P.U.; data curation, K.J.S. and R.A.W.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, K.J.S. and R.A.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, R.A.W. and P.U.; visualization, K.J.S. and R.A.W.; supervision, R.A.W. and P.U.; project administration, K.J.S.; funding acquisition, K.J.S., R.A.W. and P.U.
