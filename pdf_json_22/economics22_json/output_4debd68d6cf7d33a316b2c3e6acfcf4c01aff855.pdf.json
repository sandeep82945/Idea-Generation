    "abstractText": "Considering the complexity pattern of the gold price, this paper adopts the decomposition-reconstruction-forecast-mergence scheme to perform the international gold price forecast. Te original gold price data are decomposed into 12 intrinsic mode functions and a residual by the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)method, and then the 13 sequences are reconstructed into a high-frequency subsequence (IMFH), a low-frequency subsequence (IMFL), and the residual (Res). According to the diferent characteristics of the subsequences, the IMFL and Res are forecasted by the support vector regression (SVR) model. Besides, in order to further improve the prediction accuracy of IMFH, we have developed a novel hybrid method based on the support vector regression (SVR) model and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm with SVR for predicting the IMFH of gold prices, i.e., the CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model. Tis hybrid model combines the methodology of complex systems with machine learning techniques, making it more appropriate for analyzing relationships such as highfrequency dependences and solving complex nonlinear problems. Finally, the fnal result is obtained by combining the forecasting results of the three subsequences. Te empirical results show that the proposed model demonstrates the highest prediction ability among all of the investigated models in a comparison of prediction errors with other individual models.",

Te original gold price data are decomposed into 12 intrinsic mode functions and a residual by the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)method, and then the 13 sequences are reconstructed into a high-frequency subsequence (IMFH), a low-frequency subsequence (IMFL), and the residual (Res). According to the diferent characteristics of the subsequences, the IMFL and Res are forecasted by the support vector regression (SVR) model. Besides, in order to further improve the prediction accuracy of IMFH, we have developed a novel hybrid method based on the support vector regression (SVR) model and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm with SVR for predicting the IMFH of gold prices, i.e., the CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model. Tis hybrid model combines the methodology of complex systems with machine learning techniques, making it more appropriate for analyzing relationships such as highfrequency dependences and solving complex nonlinear problems. Finally, the fnal result is obtained by combining the forecasting results of the three subsequences. Te empirical results show that the proposed model demonstrates the highest prediction ability among all of the investigated models in a comparison of prediction errors with other individual models."

            "text": "As a precious metal, gold also acts as a reserve. Te central banks of many countries hold an amount of gold, for the purpose of mitigating potential risks, resisting infation, and increasing economic growth. Gold plays an important role in reserve assets. Especially in the last few years, the international situation has undergone complex and deep changes due to the continuous escalation of the China-US trade war. In this context, it is of great signifcance to mitigate international fnancial risks and maintain economic stability. Central banks\u2019 demand for gold has been increasing. In 2021, central banks added a total of 463 tons of gold, 82% more than in 2020, bringing global central bank gold reserves to the highest level in nearly 30 years.\nTe trend of the gold price is diferent from other minerals [1], which is impacted by various factors, including\ndemand and supply, infation, and political issues, among others. In the fnancial crisis of 2008, most commodities and equities dropped about 40%, while the gold price remained at a high point and increased about 6% [2]. With the continuous adjustment of international patterns in recent years, gold is facing a more complex market environment [3], and its price has been subject to severe fuctuations. Figure 1 shows the movement of the gold price for 21 years from 2000 to 2021. Obviously, the price of gold fuctuates up and down, showing a high degree of nonlinearity and uncertainty. Terefore, an accurate gold price forecast is generally considered to be challenging [4, 5].\nTe main purpose of this research is to contribute to the accurate prediction of gold price andmovement. To this end, we adopt the decomposition-reconstruction-forecast-mergence scheme to perform the international gold price forecast, and propose the hybrid CEEMDAD-GWO-SVR\nHindawi Complexity Volume 2022, Article ID 1511479, 12 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1511479\nmodel. Our experiments demonstrate that this scheme and the hybrid model can signifcantly improve the forecasting performance.Te rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, a series of recent works on gold price forecasting are presented, in Section 3, the CEEMDAN method, the GWO algorithm, and the SVR model are recalled for completeness, and the main steps of the hybrid CEEMDADGWO-SVR model are introduced, in Section 4, the experimental results are presented and forecasting accuracies are compared across diferent models, and in Section 5,the conclusions are discussed."

            "text": "2.1. Forecasting Models. Research on gold price forecasting was performed for decades, and numerous methods have been proposed. Te commonly used methods mainly include multiple regression, time-series analysis, neural network methods, and hybridization or combination models.\nTe multiple regression model makes prediction of gold prices with multiple infuencing factors. Te time-series methods forecast the future gold price based on the past time series, including ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average), the ARCH (auto-regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) class models, and the GARCH (Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) class models among others. For example, Wang and Xia [6] analyzed the marginal and joint impact of economic variables on the gold price, and provided a short-term forecast of the gold price by multiple regression, achieving a satisfactory result. Yang [7] used the ARIMA model, and the results showed that the model can refect the true gold price trend to a certain extent. However, the above two methods have certain limitations: the explanatory variables of the multiple regression are difcult to choose in empirical research, the time-series methods have too many parameters to be estimated, and the optimal lag order is hard to choose. In practice, these two methods may fail to characterize the nonlinear and complex behavior of the gold price time series and decrease the forecasting accuracy.\nTe neural network methods are well suited to address nonlinear and nonstationary problem, and have been widely applied in time-series forecast. Parisi et al. [8] analyzed recursive and rolling neural network models to forecast one-\nstep-ahead sign variations in gold price, and they found that the rolling ward networks perform well in forecasting gold price sign variation. Zhang and Ci [9] proposed a deep belief network (DBN) model for gold price forecast, and the empirical results showed that the proposed DBN model outperforms the BP (back propagation) neural network model, genetic algorithm optimization for BP model (GABP), and the ARIMA model. However, the neural network models have transparency problem and it is difcult to understand the economic implications and impact mechanisms [10].\nIn recent years, research on gold price forecast has focused on two types of hybrid models and combined models, such as (1) the hybridization or combination of diferent models and (2) the hybridization or combination of models with metaheuristic algorithms or advanced intelligent approaches. Since not every model is suitable for hybridization or combination with others, the second type of hybridization has more applications than the frst one. Most importantly, the hybridization of machine learning approaches achieved many successes and provided more useful fndings about the gold price forecast. Weng et al. [11] proposed a novel online extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) model based on genetic algorithm (GA) and regularization to forecast gold price. Te proposed hybrid model solves the singularity problem of OS-ELM model and outperforms the ARIMA, BP, ELM, and OS-ELM models. Alameer et al. [12] presented a hybrid model for accurately forecasting long-term monthly gold price fuctuations. Te model uses whale optimization algorithm (WOA) as a trainer to learn the multilayer perceptron neural network (NN), and their empirical results indicate the superiority of hybrid WOA-NN model over the classic NN, particle swarm optimization for NN (PSO-NN), genetic algorithm for NN (GA-NN), and ARIMA models.\nOwing to its outstanding forecasting performance and interpretability, the support vector regression (SVR) model, especially as part of a hybrid model, has been extensively used in landslide displacement prediction [13\u201315], daily trafc peak fow management [16, 17], fnancial investment [18, 19], air quality prediction [20, 21], and gold price forecast [22, 23] as well. Compared with other machine learning methodologies, SVR shows rapid convergence [24] and efciently solves multidimensional function estimation problems [25], but the selection of the SVR penalty parameter and the kernel function parameter has an important infuence on its own performance [26]. Especially, SVR would have a large forecasting error in dealing with nonlinear high-frequency time series. Results in [26] showed that the hybrid models of SVR and metaheuristic algorithms can signifcantly improve the performance of the single SVR model.\nMetaheuristic algorithms are widely used by researchers for their remarkable ability to solve optimization problems. Since the commencement of the classical metaheuristics, namely, genetic [27], simulated annealing [28], tabu search [29], and particle swarm optimization [30] in the early 1970s to late 1990s, a new generation of metaheuristics has grown exponentially. In the past three years,\nnearly 20 metaheuristics has been proposed, including Monarch butterfy optimization [31], butterfy optimization algorithm [32], shufed shepherd optimization algorithm [33], and water strider algorithm [34]. Currently, there are more than 200 metaheuristic techniques in the literature and several surveys [35\u201337] provided comprehensive overviews on them. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) [38] is one of metaheuristic algorithms, which was proposed by Mirjalili in 2014. It is a swarm intelligent algorithm that mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. It has the advantages of fast convergence speed and strong search ability and can simultaneously optimize the parameters and weights of the involved kernels [39]. Recent studies [38, 40, 41] have demonstrated that GWO provides competitive results compared to some well-known metaheuristics. Terefore, this paper hybridizes SVR with GWO algorithm (i.e., PSOSVR) to forecast the nonlinear high-frequency part of the gold price time series and the subsequent experimental results verify the satisfactory learning precision and generalization ability with PSO-SVR.\n2.2. Data Decomposition. Studies [42\u201345] have shown that data decomposition before forecasting can efectively reduce the nonstationary characteristics of the time series, and it can improve the forecasting performance signifcantly. Current decomposition algorithms include empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [42], ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) [43], complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) [44], and variational mode decomposition (VMD) [45]. EMD is an adaptive decomposition method for nonlinear and nonstationary processes. Tis method can decompose a complicated dataset into a fnite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). However, EMD may encounter the mode-mixing problem caused by intermittent signals. EEMD efectively resolves this problem through an ensemble of the signal plus the white Gaussian noise. However, the added white Gaussian noise also creates some of the following new problems: the reconstructed signal includes residual noise and diferent realizations of signal plus noise may produce diferent number of IMFs [44]. To overcome these problems, CEEMDAN was proposed. It performs the EEMD over white Gaussian noise added at each stage of the decomposition and makes the decomposition complete. VMD is an entirely nonrecursive variational mode decomposition model, and the experimental results in the study [45] showed that VMD is more robust to sampling and noise than EMD and EEMD. However, the infuence parameters of VMD need to be set in advance [46\u201348]. In summary, CEEMDAN not only provides a better spectral separation of the IMFs than EMD and EEMD but also overcomes the parameter selection limitation of VMD. In addition, CEEMDAN reduces the computational cost due to its fewer sifting iterations. Considering the importance of data decomposition and the ease of implementation of the CEEMDAN method, this paper uses CEEMDAN to preprocess the data before forecasting.\n2.3. Main Contributions. In this study, we frst adopt CEEMDAN to conduct the data preprocessing process and then use GWO-SVR model to forecast the price of gold. Te proposed model, named CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR, shows better forecasting ability and performance than the state-ofthe-art benchmark models in the numerical experiments. All in all, a list of abbreviations and variables has been added in Table 1 in the appendix. Te principal contributions of this paper are as follows:\n(1) Although numerous methods have been proposed to forecast the gold price, especially the hybrid or combined models were performed for decades, there are few studies based on \u201cdecomposing frst and then merging.\u201d Tis paper adopts a decomposition-reconstruction-forecast-mergence scheme to forecast the international gold price, using the CEEMDANmethod to decompose the original data into several IMFs and the residual and then using T-test to reconstruct them into three subsequences, namely, high-frequency subsequence (IMFH), low-frequency subsequence (IMFL), and the residual (Res), which are, respectively, forecasted by SVR model and fnally the three forecasting results are combined to the fnal result.\n(2) Considering the diferent characteristics of the three subsequences and the large error of SVR when dealing with nonlinear high-frequency time series, diferent SVR models are used here. Specifcally, for IMFL and Res, this paper uses SVR with a linear kernel function to forecast the price of gold, and for IMFH, the GWO algorithm and the SVR model with the Gaussian kernel function are hybridized to generate the GWO-SVR, which overcomes the problem of subjective selection of parameters to improve the accuracy of forecast.\n(3) A comparison demonstrates that the CEEMDAN method can efectively capture efective information from the original gold price data, and the proposed CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model provides signifcant improvements over the benchmark models."

Four types of grey wolves, including \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03c9, are employed for simulating the social dominant hierarchy. \u03b1 wolves are the leaders and the decision makers in the pack. \u03b2 wolves are the second group in the hierarchy that help \u03b1wolves in decisionmaking and establish a discipline for the pack. \u03b4 wolves obey \u03b1 and \u03b2wolves, but dominate\u03c9wolves.Tey play the roles of scouts, sentinels, elders, hunters, and caretakers. \u03c9 wolves, the lowest in hierarchy, always have to obey all the other types of wolves.TeGWO algorithmmathematically models this social hierarchy and hunting process to collect randomly preferred solutions. Specifcally, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03c9 are considered as the fttest, the second preferred, the third preferred, and the rest solutions, respectively. Te GWO algorithm contains the following three steps: tracking, encircling, and attacking the prey.\nIn the encircling, grey wolves encircle prey during the hunt, and the mathematical formulation is given by\nX \u2192 (t + 1) \ufffd X \u2192 p(t) \u2212 A \u2192 . C \u2192 .X \u2192 p(t) \u2212 X \u2192 (t)  , (9)\nwhere t is the number of the current iteration, X \u2192 and X \u2192\np are\nthe positions of a grey wolf and the prey, respectively, A \u2192 \ufffd 2 a\u2192. r\u21921 \u2212 a \u2192 and C \u2192 \ufffd 2 r\u21922 are coefcient vectors, components of a\u2192 are linearly decreased from 2 to 0, and r\u21921 and r \u2192\n2 are random vectors in [0, 1]. In hunting, it is supposed that the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4 have better knowledge about the potential location of prey.Terefore, the current frst three best solutions are saved, and the other search agents (including the \u03c9) update their positions according to the position of the best search agent. Te formulas are given by equations (10)\u2013(13):\nX \u2192 1 \ufffd X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2212 A \u2192 1. C \u2192 1.X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2212 X \u2192 , (10)\nX \u2192 2 \ufffd X \u2192 \u03b2 \u2212 A \u2192 2. C \u2192 2.X \u2192 \u03b2 \u2212 X \u2192 , (11)\nX \u2192 3 \ufffd X \u2192 \u03b4 \u2212 A \u2192 3. C \u2192 3.X \u2192 \u03b4 \u2212 X \u2192 , (12)\nX \u2192 (t + 1) \ufffd X \u2192 1 + X \u2192 2 + X \u2192 3 \n3 .\n(13)\nTe grey wolf agents diverge in search of the prey and converge for attacking the prey, which can be mathematical modelled by the value of |A \u2192 |. Te grey wolf agents tend to diverge from the prey when |A \u2192\n|> 1 and converge towards the prey when |A \u2192 |< 1. Finally, the GWO algorithm is terminated by minimizing of the ftness function, which would be discussed in Section 3.4.\n3.3. Support Vector Regression (SVR). SVR is a supervised machine learning algorithm. Based on structural risk minimization, SVR can solve nonlinear problems with high dimensionality and small samples. For a set of training data with N observations (x1, y1), (x2, y2), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (xN, yN) , where xi \u2208 Rn are input vectors, yi \u2208 R are output vectors, and the SVR function can be described as the following linear regression function:\nf(x) \ufffd w T\u03a6(x) + b, (14)\nwhere \u03a6(x) is the feature mapping function and the parameters w and b are the weight and bias, respectively. Based on the structural risk minimization, w and b can be calculated as follows:\nMin : 1 2 \u2016w\u2016 2 + C \nN i\ufffd1 \u03bei + \u03be \u2217 i ,\ns.t.\nyi \u2212 w T\u03a6(x) + b \u2264 \u03b5 + \u03be\u2217i ,\nw T\u03a6(x) + b \u2212 yi \u2264 \u03b5 + \u03be \u2217 i ,\n\u03bei, \u03be \u2217 i \u2265 0,\n\u23a7\u23aa \u23aa \u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa \u23aa \u23aa\u23a9\n(15)\nwhere C> 0 is a cost function, \u03bei and \u03be \u2217 i are slack variables, and \u03b5 is an insensitive loss function. By introducing the\nLagrange multipliers \u03b1i and \u03b1\u2217i , the SVR function is expressed as\nf(x) \ufffd  N\ni\ufffd1 \u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1\n\u2217 i( k x, xi(  + b, (16)\nwhere k(x, xi) \ufffd \u03a6(x).\u03a6(xi) is the kernel function, which is the inner product of the feature mapping function.\nSVR would have a large forecasting error when dealing with nonlinear high-frequency time series. Terefore, unlike the linear kernel function used in forecasting the low-frequency time series, the Gaussian kernel, k(x, xi) \ufffd exp(\u2212cx \u2212 x2i ), is used to forecast the high-frequency time series, owing to its advanced mapping capability and stable forecasting performance. Meanwhile, the selection of the SVR penalty parameter C and the kernel function parameter c has an important infuence on its forecasting accuracy [26]. Tus, this paper tunes these SVR parameters using the GWO algorithm.\n3.4. Te Hybrid CEEMDAD-GWO-SVR Model. Te details of the hybrid CEEMDAD-GWO-SVR model are as follows, and the fowchart is presented in Figure 2. It should be noted that the \u201cdecomposition-reconstruction-forecast-mergence\u201d scheme is also shown in Figure 2.\nStep 1. We conduct CEEMDAN to decompose the original gold price data into several relatively simple IMFs and the residual by using equations (1)\u2013(8). Tis step corresponds to the \u201cdecomposition\u201d of the scheme. Step 2. We reconstruct the IMFs and the residual into three subsequences, namely, IMFH, IMFL, and Res. Specifcally, since the high-frequency IMFs are afected by some short-term random factors, they can be assumed to fuctuate around the zero mean. Terefore, each IMF is reconstructed into high-frequency subsequence (IMFH) and low-frequency subsequence (IMFL) by T-test with zero mean. Te residual is classifed as the third subsequence, i.e., Res. Tis step corresponds to the \u201creconstruction\u201d of the scheme. Step 3. Forecasting IMFH by GWO-SVR and forecasting IMFL and Res by SVR.Te optimal GWO-SVRmodel is determined by minimizing the ftness function. In this paper, the mean square error, given by equation (17), is used to calculate the forecasting accuracy. Tis step is decisive for the prediction performance of the proposed model, corresponding to the \u201cforecast\u201d of the scheme.\nMSE \ufffd 1 n \nN\ni\ufffd1 yi \u2212 yi( \n2 . (17)\nStep 4.

In the CEEMDAN, the parameters of ensemble size I and the signal-to-noise ratio \u03b50 are set as 500 and 0.2, respectively, and the maximal number of iterations is 2,000, as proposed in [44]. Decomposition results is shown in Figure 4. Te gold price is decomposed into 13 sequences with 12 IMFs and one residual. Te frequency of sequences is ranked from high to low. Te high-frequency IMFs fuctuate relatively randomly but basically around zero mean, which can be regarded as the interference of short-term random factors (e.g., psychological factors, speculative factors, and shortterm policies). Te low-frequency IMFs have roughly similar trend to that of the original gold price data, refecting the infuence of important factors such as market policies and macroeconomics. Te residual shows the overall upward trend, determining the long-term trend of gold price.\nMeanwhile, Pearson correlation coefcient, Kendall rank correlation coefcient, and the variance contribution rate (VCR) are selected to measure the relationship between each sequence and the original gold price data, as depicted in Table 3. From the two correlation coefcients, the highfrequency IMFs have a low association with the original gold price data, while the low-frequency IMFs and the residual have a high correlation with the original. Te similar pattern is observed for VCR and the residual covers 66.6% of all variance, indicating that it has the greatest infuence on the original data and refects the internal trajectory of the gold price data. To sum up, the trend of gold price is mainly described by the residual. Te low-frequency IMFs have a great infuence on gold price in a certain period, while the high-frequency IMFs only have a small infuence in a short period.\n4.1.2. Data Reconstruction. Te high-frequency IMFs have a small infuence on gold price in a short period, so they can be combined into one sequence to improve the efciency of modeling, but the problem is how to determine which sequences are high-frequency IMFs. Since the high-frequency IMFs are afected by some short-term random factors, they can be assumed to fuctuate around zero mean. Terefore, IMFs can be reconstructed by T test with zero mean for each IMF. Te results are shown in Table 3. Te p values of IMF1\u223cIMF9 are greater than 0.01."

Considering the low forecasting accuracy of SVR when dealing with nonlinear high-frequency time series, IMFH is forecasted by GWO-SVR to improve the parameter selection, and IMFL and Res forecasts are conducted by SVR.\nIn GWO algorithm, the optimization range is set at (0.001 and 200), and the population size and the maximum number of iterations are set to 20 and 50, respectively. For IMFH, the optimal penalty parameter C and the kernel function parameter c of SVR are \u2212132.7510 and \u22121.8545, selected by GWO. All calculations are done on the Ryzen R74800u CPU, with 16.0 GB DDR4 3200Mhz RAM, and windows 11 system.\nFigure 6 shows the forecasting results of the three subsequences and the original gold price data. It can be observed that the blue lines (forecasting results) are very close to the red lines (the reconstructed subsequences), which indicate that the proposed CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model achieves a relatively good forecasting result. Table 5 presents the measures of the forecasting accuracy. IMFL and Res have relatively small errors and high directional accuracy, achieving good forecasting performance. IMFH has lower accuracy than the other two, and it also reduces the forecasting accuracy of the original gold price data. Tis is because IMFH is afected by random factors, which increases the difculty of forecasting.\nTable 3: Correlation coefcient, VCR, and T test results for each IMF and the residual.\nIMFs/residual Pearson correlation Kendall rank correlation Variance contribution rate (%) T test t statistic p value IMF1 0.0129 0.0131 0.0144 \u22120.3107 0.7561 IMF2 0.0188 0.0146 0.0020 \u22120.8614 0.3891 IMF3 0.0121 0.0088 0.0222 0.1387 0.8897 IMF4 0.0129 0.0050 0.0279 \u22120.1974 0.8435 IMF5 0.0232 0.0172 0.0370 0.2000 0.8415 IMF6 0.0430 0.0312 0.0634 \u22121.0189 0.3083 IMF7 0.0370 0.0205 0.0874 \u22120.2824 0.7776 IMF8 0.0475 0.0401 0.1458 \u22121.3309 0.1833 IMF9 0.0766 0.0409 0.2976 0.0982 0.9218 IMF10 0.1067 0.0466 0.3195 \u22121.9183 0.0551 IMF11 0.3727 0.1391 2.4837 2.5979 0.0094 IMF12 0.6444 0.3454 6.6239 \u221210.4565 0.0001 Residual 0.9210 0.7399 68.1219 190.1437 0.0001\nTable 4: Reconstructed results of the original gold price data.\nSubsequences Sequences/residual Pearson correlation Kendall rank correlation Variance contributionrate (%)\nIMFH IMF1, IMF2, IMF3, IMF4, IMF5,IMF6, IMF7, IMF8, IMF9 0.0933 0.0537 0.9831 IMFL IMF10, IMF11, IMF12 0.5969 0.2680 14.9269 Res Residual 0.9210 0.7399 68.1219\nTable 6 presents the accuracy measures of the forecasting results of the proposed CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model, SVR-based models, and non-SVR-based models. Among them, the SVR-based models include CEEMDAN-SVR, GWO-SVR, and SVR, and the non-SVR-based models include ARIMA, GARCH, ANN, CART, and BPNN (back propagation neural network). Obviously, the proposed CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model is superior to the alternatives. For the SVR-based models, the CEEMDAN-SVR, CEEMDAN-PSO-SVR, and CEEMDAN-GA-SVR models can certainly improve the performance of SVR. While the hybrid CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model achieves the best forecasting result, which shows that the proposed model can critically capture efective information from the original data, and it also demonstrates the superiority of the decomposition-reconstruction-forecast-mergence scheme. Figure 7 shows the convergence plots of GWO, which refected that the objective can be minimized by the algorithm before the maximum number of iterations.\n4.2.3. Out-of-Sample Forecast (September 6, 2021\u2013October 21, 2022). Te above results prove that the CEEMDANGWO-SVR model outperforms the benchmark models for in-sample forecast. In order to further test the proposed model for out-of-sample forecasts, this paper estimates the gold price for the next 295 consecutive days (September 6, 2021\u2013October 2021). Parameters of the CEEMDAN-GWOSVR model here are set in the same way as above.\nOut-of-sample forecasting accuracy indexes comparison are respectively shown in Table 7. Te superiority of the proposed CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model can also be demonstrated. Among the three SVR-based models, the CEEMDAN-SVR model obtains the best performance, and at the same time, it also has superior forecast performance than the non-SVR-based models. Tis shows that the CEEMDAN method could improve the forecasting performance. Moreover, when CEEMDAN-SVR and GWO are hybridized, the forecasting accuracy of gold price is improved further, which shows the superiority of the CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model proposed in this paper. It should be noted that in short-term forecasts, although the CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model has relatively lower directional accuracy, it still has smaller forecasting errors (MAPE and RMSE) than alternatives. Terefore, the proposed CEEMDAN-GWO-SVRmodel can be considered as the best model."

In this scheme, a useful gold price forecasting model is proposed by combining the CEEMDAN method with GWO-SVR. Te experimental results verify the validity of the CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model for gold price forecast. Te following conclusions are drawn:\n(1) Due to the complex pattern of the gold price, data preprocessing in the early stage of forecasting is necessary. Te CEEMDAN method adds white Gaussian noise at each stage of the decomposition and sufciently reduces the noise of the original data. Also, experimental results show that the CEEMDAN method can improves the forecasting performance of SVR.\n(2) Although the CEEMDAN-SVR model can certainly improve the performance of SVR, the forecasting accuracy can be further improved by hybridizing CEEMDAN-SVR and GWO. Tis is because GWO optimizes the selection of SVR parameters for highfrequency time series decomposed by CEEMDAN, thus ultimately improving the forecasting performance.\n(3) Te CEEMDAN-GWO-SVR model signifcantly outperforms the other six benchmark models, which also demonstrates the superiority of the decomposition-reconstruction-forecast-mergence scheme.\nHowever, this paper still has certain limitations. Tis paper only uses time series to forecast gold prices. Although the proposed model has achieved good forecasting results, the research on the main infuencing factors of gold price is still an important research issue.\nFurther research can be carried out from the following aspects in the future. Te GWO algorithm has certain problems in population diversity and the balance between the exploitation and exploration [49]. Terefore, the algorithm could be improved to further improve the prediction performance of the SVR model. Moreover, except GWO, fnding a suitable approach to hybridize more recent metaheuristic algorithms with SVR is also an important research issue."
