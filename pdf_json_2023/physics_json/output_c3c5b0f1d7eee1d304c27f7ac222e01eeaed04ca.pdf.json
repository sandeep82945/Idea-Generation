            "text": "Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite crystals based on metal halides have received increasing attention owing to their interesting optoelectronic, electrical, and magnetic properties.1\u20135 The most common perovskite MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3, X = I, Br, or Cl) based thin-lm photovoltaic devices are used as solar cells.6\u201314 However, MAPbX3-based photovoltaics are highly unstable under ambient conditions, especially in the presence of moisture, and are highly toxic owing to Pb bioaccumulation. Recently, researchers have suggested substituting Pb with other low-toxicity or eco-friendly metals to develop Pb-free photovoltaic devices. Free-Pb [NH3(CH2)nNH3] BX4 (n = 1, 2, 3., B = Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, or Cd) and [CnH2n+1NH3]2BX4 are organic\u2013inorganic hybrids that have recently attracted considerable attention.15\u201327 In addition, [NH2(CH3)2]2BX4 and NH2(CH3)2BX3 are MA2BX4- and MABX3-type complexes, where MA+ (= NH2(CH3)2) is a univalent cation.28\u201334 Here, the organic group of the organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material determines the optical properties and structural exibility\nEngineering, Jeonju University, Jeonju\nUniversity, Jeonju 55069, Korea.

Hence, these organic\u2013 inorganic materials constitute an important area of research in the eld of materials science.35,36\nX-ray studies on dimethylammonium trichlorocadmium crystals, NH2(CH3)2CdCl3, revealed their monoclinic structure with a P21/c space group and the lattice parameters a = 8.7377 \u00c5, b = 13.2709 \u00c5, c = 6.6910 \u00c5, b = 98.371\u00b0, and Z = 4 at room temperature.37 The structural unit is formed by the organic [NH2(CH3)2] + and the inorganic [CdCl6] \u2212 moieties. The innite chains consist of face-sharing CdCl6 octahedra, resulting in a 1D perovskite structure of the MABX3 family, where MA = NH2(CH3)2, B = Cd, and X = Cl. The six doubly bridging chloride ions link the adjacent Cd centers via Cd\u2013Cl bonds.\nMoreover, Kalthoum et al.37 investigated the application of NH2(CH3)2CdCl3, which has a large dielectric constant, in eldeffect transistors. They also reported the optical properties of NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 for solar cell applications.38 And, the effects for Zn2+ and Cu2+ doping of NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 for white-light emission and green solar cell applications were investigated by Jellai et al.39\nThe minimum of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spinlattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1r) depends on the frequency u1 rather than uo. Therefore, the minimum T1r is observed at a lower temperature than the spin\u2013lattice relaxation time in the laboratory frame (T1). T1r provides information on motion in the kHz region, and T1 provides information on rapid motion in the order of tens or hundreds of MHz.40\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26015\u201326022 | 26015\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Therefore, we grew a NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 single crystal via an aqueous solution method and analyzed its structure by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The phase transition temperature (TC) of this crystal was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to determine the thermodynamic properties of the material. The structural environments of 1H, 13C, 14N, and 113Cd in [NH2(CH3)2] cation and CdCl6 anion were analyzed based on the chemical shis observed in magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and static NMR spectra. Moreover, we determined the T1r, which represents the energy transfer around the 1H and 13C atoms of the cation, and activation energies (Ea). These physicochemical properties can provide important insights into the mechanisms of compound for potential applications in solar cell."

The data were collected and integrated using SMART APEX3 (Bruker, 2016) and SAINT (Bruker, 2016). The absorption was corrected using the multiscan method implemented in SADABS. This structure was analyzed by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL soware.41 All hydrogen atoms are represented by geometric positions. In addition, the PXRD patterns of the NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 were obtained at various temperatures with a Mo-Ka target.42\nDSC measurements (DSC 25, USA) were acquired in the range of 200\u2013573 K at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121 and 10 \u00b0 C min\u22121 under N2 gas, respectively.\nTGA (SDT 0650-0439, USA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed in the range of 300\u2013873 K at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min\u22121 under N2 gas.\nThe 1H MAS and 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS NMR spectra of NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 crystals were recorded at the Larmor frequencies of 400.13 and 100.61 MHz using a solid-state 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (AVANCE III+, Bruker, Germany) at the\n26016 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26015\u201326022\nKBSI Seoul Western Center. The samples in the cylindrical zirconia rotors were spun at a rate of 10 kHz for the MAS NMR measurements to minimize the spinning sideband. Adamantane and tetramethylsilane (TMS) were selected as the internal standards for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. 1D NMR spectrum for 1H and 13C was performed in the delay time of 1.5\u2013 15 s. The 1H T1r values were measured using p/2\u2013s spin-lock pulse for a duration of s, and the p/2 pulse width was 4 ms. And, the 13C T1r values were measured by varying the duration of a 13C spin-locking pulse applied aer the CP preparation period. The 13C T1r values were obtained using CP-s acquisition. Static 14N NMR spectra of the NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 crystal were recorded using the one-pulse method with a Larmor frequency of 28.90 MHz, where NH4NO3 was the internal standard. Static 113Cd NMR spectra were recorded at a Larmor frequency of 88.75 MHz, where CdCl2O8$6H2O was the internal standard. The NMR experiment above 430 K due to the limitations of the NMR instrument was not possible. The temperature was maintained nearly constant within the error range of \u00b10.5 \u00b0C, even when the rate of N2 gas ow and the heater current were adjusted."

The PXRD patterns obtained at 300, 350, and 400 K (blue color) of phase III differ slightly from that recorded at 465 K (red color) of phase II; this difference is associated with TC2 (= 461 K). Furthermore, the PXRD pattern recorded at 465 K of phase II differs from those recorded above 480 K (olive color) of phase I, indicating a clear change in TC1 (= 470 K). These results are consistent with those of the DSC experiments. Additional, the theoretical XRD pattern based on the cif le at 300 K is shown in Fig. 3, which agrees well with the experimental pattern. The peaks observed in this diffractogram are indexed with Mercury program.\nTherefore, the DSC, PXRD, and polarizing microscopy experiments suggest that the phase transition temperatures were TC2 = 461 K and TC1 = 470 K, whereas the decomposition temperature was Td = 549 K."

Finally, at temperatures above 380 K, a single spectrum was observed, and the line width became very narrow. Hence, the environments around 13C in CH3 vary considerably depending on the temperature. 13C NMR chemical shis were observed at 39.84 and 37.97 ppm at 300 K, and the line width was narrower (1.54 ppm) than that (32 ppm) in the 1H NMR of NH2 and CH3, indicating that the molecular motion of 13C located at the end of the [NH2(CH3)2] cation is very free."

The 14N NMR spectrum was less sensitive than 1H, but has a larger chemical shi range. The magnetic eld direction relative to the single-crystal direction was measured in an arbitrary direction. The NMR spectrum due to the spin number of 14N (I = 1)44 was predicted by the two resonance lines owing to the quadrupole interaction. The Larmor frequency for 14N NMR spectrum was extremely low as 28.90 MHz, which made it difficult to obtain a signal. Moreover, distinguishing the signals was difficult owing to the low peak intensities and wide line widths. Four 14N NMR signals were observed, which were divided into two sets: N(1) and N(2). The chemical shi of N(1) slightly increased with increasing temperature, whereas that of N(2) decreased and then slightly increased. At 300 K, the line width was extremely broad (\u223c64 ppm) and indicated the presence of two sets of N sites. The continuous changes in the N(1) and N(2) chemical shis with increasing temperature indicated a change in the coordination geometry of the local environment of 14N atom. SCXRD results did not indicate different N sites; thus, these two sets of 14N\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nNMR signals suggest a twin structure due to the property of ferroelastic materials.\nThe 113Cd signal was distributed over a wide chemical shi range and exhibited good intensity owing to its relatively high natural abundance; therefore, it was not difficult to record. From the chemical shis of static 113Cd NMR, the structural environment around 113Cd in CdCl6 was determined based on the temperature change. As the number of spins in 113Cd (I = 1 2),\n44 only one resonance signal was expected. At 300 K, the 113Cd chemical shi was 215.26 ppm as shown in Fig. 7, and the 113Cd chemical shis changed with temperature, suggesting that the 113Cd environment in CdCl6 changed with temperature. The line widths of the 113Cd NMR spectra are shown in detail in Fig. 7. At 300 K, the line width was \u223c39 ppm, which is wider than 1H line widths, and hardly changed within the error range depending on the temperature.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26015\u201326022 | 26019\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

            "text": "The 1H and 13C T1r values of NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 crystals were collected using a spin-lock pulse and subsequent FID. The intensity changes in the measured magnetization are calculated using the following equation:45,46\nS(t)/S(0) = exp(\u2012t/T1r) (1)\nwhere S(t) is the intensity of the resonance line at delay time t and S(0) is the intensity of the resonance line at delay time t= 0. The experiment was repeated several times with different t values, and the T1r values were obtained from the slopes of the resulting intensities vs. the t values in eqn (1). The T1r values for 1H and 13C NMR of NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 as a function of 1000/ temperature are shown in Fig. 8 and 9, respectively. The 1H NMR T1r values increased slightly with increasing temperature but decreased rapidly at temperatures above 220 K with increasing temperature and subsequently increased rapidly. The minimum 1H T1r value of 0.9 ms was exhibited at 300 K, and the pattern of 1H T1r values shown in Fig. 8 suggests that molecular motion ts the Bloembergen\u2013Purcell\u2013Pound (BPP) theory. The experimental T1r value is related to the correlation time, sC, according to BPP theory, and the T1r value for molecular motion is expressed by eqn (2) as shown below:40\n\u00f0T1r\u00de 1 \u00bc R\u00bd4J1\u00f0u1\u00de \u00fe J2\u00f0uC uH\u00de \u00fe 3J3\u00f0uC\u00de \u00fe 6J4\u00f0uC \u00fe uH\u00de \u00fe 6J5\u00f0uH\u00de J1 \u00bc sC 1\u00fe u12sC2 ; J2 \u00bc sC .h 1\u00fe \u00f0uC uH\u00de2sC2 i ; J3 \u00bc sC 1\u00fe uC2sC2 J4 \u00bc sC .h 1\u00fe \u00f0uC \u00fe uH\u00de2sC2 i ; J5 \u00bc sC 1\u00fe uH2sC2\n(2)\nwhere R (= m0\u0127gHgC/pr3)2 is a constant; u1 is the spin-lock eld; and uH and uC are the Larmor frequencies for proton and carbon, respectively. The minimum T1r value is satised when u1sC = 1, and the constant R value (= 350 \u00d7 10\n5 for 1H; 133 \u00d7 105 and 48 \u00d7 105 for 13C) can be calculated by using the sC obtained from u1sC= 1. Using R and u1 values as well as the uH, uC, and T1r values obtained from the experiment, we calculated sC values of molecular motion as a function of temperature. The local eld uctuation is described by the thermal motion of the protons, which is caused by thermal energy. The correlation time sC is represented by the Arrhenius dependence of the activation energy as shown below:45\nsC = sC(0)exp(\u2012Ea/kBT) (3)\nwhere sC(0), Ea, kB, and T are the pre-correlation time, activation energy, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. The magnitude of Ea depends on molecular dynamics. The plot of sC on a logarithmic scale vs. 1000/T for 1H is shown in Fig. 8. sC was determined to be 44.84 \u00b1 2.26 kJ mol\u22121 from the slope of the blue dotted line.\nOn the other hand, the two 13C T1r values shown in Fig. 9 showed similar trends at all temperatures, and the minimum\n26020 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26015\u201326022\nT1r value of CH3 was observed at 280 K.

            "text": "In this study, an organic\u2013inorganic hybrid NH2(CH3)2CdCl3 crystal was grown and its crystal structure, phase transition temperature, thermal behavior, and structural dynamics were investigated. The structure of this crystal was monoclinic, as evidenced by SCXRD at 200 K and 300 K, and the phase transition temperatures TC of 460 and 470 K were determined using DSC and PXRD. The thermal properties determined by TGA showed that the crystal began decomposing at 540 K and was thermally stable. Although the surrounding environments by the 1H, 13C, 14N, and 113Cd NMR chemical shis varied with increasing temperature, this is independent of the phase transition. It is noteworthy that the 1H and 14N NMR chemical shis bonded to NH2 in the NH2(CH3)2 cation were changed more as the temperature changes, and the change in 113Cd NMR chemical shi indicate changes in the surrounding environment of the six Cl atoms around the Cd in CdCl6. These experimental results suggest that the N\u2013H/Cl hydrogen bonding between the NH2(CH3)2 cation and CdCl6 anion changed with temperature. In addition, T1r values which represent the energy transfer around the 1H and 13C atoms of the cation, varied signicantly with temperature. 1H and 13C T1r values were comparable in the measured temperature range because 1H and 13C connect the same bond in the cation. Moreover, 13C Ea values were smaller than those of\n1H, suggesting that 13C at the end of the cation is free compared to 1H in the cation. The physicochemical properties will help a fundamental understanding of Pb-free organic\u2013inorganic perovskite type solar cell.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
