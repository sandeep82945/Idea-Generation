 Here are 5 potential future research directions after reading this paper on learning-based parametric query optimization:

1. Reduce training data collection cost. The paper mentions the high cost of collecting execution statistics for all candidate plans as a limitation. Future work could explore more efficient data collection methods like active learning or reinforcement learning.

2. Generalize across query templates. The current system trains a separate model for each query template. Research into shared representations or meta-learning approaches could allow knowledge to transfer across templates, reducing the data requirements.

3. Integrate with cardinality estimation. Combining the perturbations approach with learned cardinality models could further improve candidate plan generation.

4. Optimize end-to-end pipeline. The candidate generation, data collection, and modeling phases could likely be jointly optimized or interleaved to maximize overall performance.

5. Apply to broader workloads. Evaluating the approach on more complex queries with larger plan spaces would better demonstrate its scalability. Extending to concurrent/distributed query execution is also an open challenge.
