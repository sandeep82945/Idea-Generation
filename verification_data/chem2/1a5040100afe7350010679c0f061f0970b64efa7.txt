"The data indicates that acute deferiprone treatment on the prefrontal cortex alters phosphorylation of proteins involved in synaptic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic signalling in the 5-HTT KO mouse model of depression. Additionally, there was an effect on proteins involved in cytoskeletal organisation irrespective of genotype. It is likely too simplistic to suggest that one protein or neurotransmitter is involved in the positive effects of a therapeutic in a complex disorder like MDD. Instead, it is probable that a combinatory effect of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter signalling on synaptic plasticity and cytoskeletal protein mechanisms are involved in deferiproneâ€™s antidepressant-like properties. The genotype specific effect of deferiprone on the 5-HTT KO mouse may be driven by the intrinsic synaptic and glutamatergic signalling pathology and could be responsible for the genotype specific antidepressant-like properties of the drug. These results would indicate that deferiprone has actions similar to the fast-acting antidepressant glutamatergic antagonist ketamine."
