1. **Development of a machine learning algorithm to predict glycan structures from MS/MS data.** This algorithm could be used to automate the process of glycan identification, making it even faster and more accurate.
2. **Integration of the GlyKAn AZ app with other software tools for glycan analysis.** This would allow users to take advantage of the strengths of multiple software tools in a single workflow.
3. **Development of a web-based version of the GlyKAn AZ app.** This would make the app more accessible to users who do not have access to MATLAB.
4. **Expansion of the GlyKAn AZ app to include support for other types of glycans, such as O-linked glycans.** This would make the app more versatile and useful for a wider range of applications.
5. **Development of a mobile app version of the GlyKAn AZ app.** This would allow users to perform glycan analysis on the go.
