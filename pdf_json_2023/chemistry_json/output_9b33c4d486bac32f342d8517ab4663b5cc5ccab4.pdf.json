    "abstractText": "Research targeting natural cosmeceuticals is now increasing due to the safety and/or limited side effects of natural products that are highly valued in cosmetology. Within a research program exploring botanical sources for valuable skincare antioxidant components, the current study investigated the phytochemical content and the biological potential of Faucaria tuberculosa. Phytochemical investigation of F. tuberculosa extract resulted in purification and characterization of six phytoconstituents, including a new one. The structure of the new constituent was elucidated as (-) catechin-(2\u21921\u2032,4\u21922\u2032)-phloroglucinol (4). The structural identity of all isolated compounds were confirmed on the basis of extensive physical and spectral (1D, 2D-NMR and HRESIMS) investigations. The ethanolic extract exhibits a rich content of total phenolics (TPC) and total flavonoids (TFC), estimated as 32 \u00b1 0.034 mg GAE/g and 43 \u00b1 0.004 mg RE/g, respectively. In addition, the antioxidant (ABTS and FRAP), antihyaluronidase and antityrosinase activities of all purified phytoconstituents were evaluated. The results noted (-) catechin-(2\u21921\u2032,4\u21922\u2032) phloroglucinol (4) and phloroglucinol (1) for their remarkable antioxidant activity, while isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside (3) and 3,5-dihydroxyphenyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (2) achieved the most potent inhibitory activity against tyrosinase (IC50 22.09 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM and 29.96 \u00b1 0.44 \u03bcM, respectively) and hyaluronidase enzymes (IC50 49.30 \u00b1 1.57 \u03bcM and 62.58 \u00b1 0.92, respectively) that remarkably exceeds the activity of the standard drugs kojic acid (IC50 = 65.21 \u00b1 0.47 \u03bcM) and luteolin, (IC50 = 116.16 \u00b1 1.69 \u03bcM), respectively. A molecular docking study of the two active compounds (3 and 2) highlighted their high potential to bind to the active sites of the two enzymes involved in the study.",

            "text": "Aizoaceae is an important plant family predominant mainly in tropical and subtropical areas, and most of its members are ornamental [1]. It includes approximately 135 genera and 2499 species [2]. Faucaria is one of these genera, with the subfamily Ruschioideae,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6895. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196895 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6895 2 of 17\nknown as Tiger jaws due to its appearance [3]. Faucaria tuberculosa (Rolfe) Schwant (Syn, F. felina subsp. tuberculosa (Rolfe) L.E.Groen, and Mesembryanthemum tuberculosum (Rolfe)) have special appeal due to the marked tubercles on the upper surface of the leaves making them look like rough stone [4,5]. Reviewing the relevant literature, no research discussing the phytochemical or the biological activity of this species exists, so the current study was undertaken to explore this plant species. Skin aging is an undesirable multifaceted process causing unwanted signs, e.g., dryness of the skin, wrinkles, hyper-pigmentation, reduced skin elasticity, and skin cancer. Unwanted side effects and allergic reactions, caused by synthetic drugs, have prompted a search for safe, natural anti-aging products. Aging can be classified as intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic aging might be attributable to genetic or hormonal factors while the extrinsic aging may result from exposure to toxins, chemicals, and UV radiation [6\u20138]. Photo aging is usually accompanied by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Skin alteration is mediated by many factors including oxidative stress. Accordingly, antioxidants, such as polyphenols, could be an effective treatment that reduces oxidative stress and improves skin condition [9]. The aging process is also associated with increasing enzyme activity as tyrosinase and hyaluronidase [7]. Tyrosinase enzymes regulate the process of melanin synthesis, and melanin accumulation leads to several skin ailments, such as wrinkles, brown spots, age spots, etc. [10]. Hyaluronic acid is a substance produced naturally by the body to preserve moisture content in skin tissues as well as in other organs, and hyaluronidase is the enzyme responsible for hyaluronic acid degradation [11]. In vitro studies assessing the antioxidant and antiaging activity of Aizoaceae extracts were previously reported, in which extracts of Mesembryanthemum Nodiflorum, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Mesembryanthemum forsskaolii, Carpobrotus edulis and Mesembryanthemum edule were reported to possess a concentration-dependent free radical scavenging activity against DPPH and hydrogen peroxide radicals, which was comparable with standard ascorbic acid [12]. Additionally, Carpobrotus edulis aqueous leaf extract was reported to increase wound closure, collagen production, and inhibit collagenase and hyaluronidase [13]. In cell culture experiments, CAE increased wound closure and collagen production, which was consistent with its high polyphenol content. Many pure compounds from different chemical classes (e.g., alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids) have been isolated from Aizoaceae plants and were found responsible for their multiple therapeutic activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihepatotoxic, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities [14]. Since F. tuberculosa has not been previously investigated phytochemically and/or biologically, and preliminary studies have shown promising contents of total phenolics and flavonoids, the authors conducted this study with regard to the isolation of secondary metabolites and evaluation of their antioxidant potential, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-hyaluronidase properties. Firstly, an in vitro model was designed to identify the compound(s) with the highest anti-aging activity; secondly, in silico models were applied to the most active anti-aging compound on the two enzymes."

The current findings calculate TPC and TFC as 32 \u00b1 0.034 mg GAE/g and 43 \u00b1 0.004 mg RE/g, respectively. These results indicated an appreciable content of phenolics and flavonoids in this species, which may make it promising in terms of biological activities. It worth mentioning that this is the first study investigating the phytoconstituents contents in genus Faucaria."

In the 13C NMR and HSQC spectra (Figures S9 and S10), the presence of signals at \u03b4C 100.3, 68.08 and 29.5 is attributed to the heterocyclic C-2, C-3, and C-4 of ring C. The aromatic A-, Band D-ring carbons were observed downfield at \u03b4C104.5 (4a), 155.5(5), 98.6(6), 156.2(7), 96.9(8), 158.6(8a), 132.1(9), 115.65(10), 146.7(11), 145.7(12), 115.67(13) and 119.8(14). These spectral data were similar to data for the upper flavanol moiety of the previously reported proanthocyanidin A-2; epicatechin-(2\u03b2\u21927,4\u03b2\u21928)-epicatechin [21]; however, NOE data were recorded to confirm cis or trans configuration of H-3, H-4 and H-14, as indicated below. Proanthocyanidins are oligomers or polymers composed of flavanols units. They are classified into subclasses; among them, the A-type is a subclass characterized by a double linkage between two consecutive flavanol moieties. One of them is a single 4C-8D or 4C-6D bond, while the other is ether-type bond between 2C-O-7D or 2C-O-5D [22,23]. NMR spectral data for compound 4 differ from proanthocyanidin A-2 in the absence of signals of a lower flavonol moiety. As indicated in Table 1, both 1H- and 13C-NMR data showed characteristic resonances for a 1, 2 disubstituted phloroglucinol moiety (\u03b4C108.2, 154.4, 98.1, 154.9, 96.8, 158) and a \u03b2-glucopyranoside moiety (\u03b4C 101.9, 74.6, 77.3, 71.2, 78.2, 62.3). HMBC (Table 1, Figure S11) showed 2JC-H correlation between H-4 and C-4a and 3JC-H correlation between H-4 and, C-2, C-2\u2032, C-3\u2032 confirming the linkage between the flavanol and phloroglucinol moieties. This double-linked skeleton was confirmed by presence of one acetal carbon at \u03b4C 100.3 (C-2) and one quaternary carbon at \u03b4C 108.2 (C-2\u2032) in its 13C NMR spectrum. The identities of the sugar units were elucidated via comparison of their 13C NMR resonances with the literature [17,24]. The anomeric proton exhibited a J value of 7.6 Hz, thus confirming \u03b2-type glycosidic linkage [17,24]. The position of the glucopyranoside moiety was elucidated in the HMBC spectrum, as it displayed a 3JC-H correlation between the anomeric proton of the glucose moiety at \u03b4H 4.97(d, 7.6, H-1\u2032\u2032) to 5\u2032 at \u03b4C 154.9 ppm. Based on their similarity with A-type proanthocyanidins, H-3 and H-4 cis or trans orientation cannot be distinguished based on coupling constants that record very similar values. However, they can be determined via NOE correlation (Figures S12 and S13). H-3 showed a NOE interaction with H-14; a NOE interaction, characteristic of a 3, 4-trans orientation, was not detected between H-3C with H-6D. Accordingly, the interaction between H-3C and H-4C is cis, and independently of the rigid ring conformation, the flavanol moiety will be catechin [23,25]. Accordingly, compound 4 was concluded as (-) catechin-(2\u21921\u2032,4\u21922\u2032)-phloroglucinol (Figures 1 and 2), which was isolated as a natural product herein for the first time.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17\n(d, J = 2.4, H-10), 6.83 (d, J = 2.4, H-13), 7.01 (dd, J = 2, 8.2, H-14).

Several studies have reported that ROS plays a key role in the mechanism of aging [26\u201328]. To evaluate the antioxidant activity of the isolated compounds (1\u20136), we examined their ABTS+ radical scavenging capacity, as well as the total reducing power (FRAP). The antioxidant activity of phenolics is affected by their chemical structures; OH groups represent a key factor regulating the ability of these compounds to scavenge the free radicals hydroxyl [29,30]. As indicated in Table 2, the two compounds catechin-(2\u21921\u2032,4\u21922\u2032)-phloroglucinol (4) and phloroglucinol (1) exhibited strong ABTS radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 4.11 \u00b1 0.32 and 6.44 \u00b1 0.47 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, which seems better that the standard used (ascorbic acid). Additionally, compounds 3, 5 and 2 showed good antioxidant, while 6 was the least active among the tested compounds. Interestingly, the results of the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay were in great accordance with the ABTS radical scavenging assay results, wherein catechin(2\u21921\u2032,4\u21922\u2032)-phloroglucinol and phloroglucinol showed the strongest reducing power, with IC50 values better that ascorbic acid (Table 2). The strong antioxidant activity of catechin-(2\u21921\u2032,4\u21922\u2032)-phloroglucinol may be returned to the linkage between the flavan and phloroglucinol moieties, as well as the hydroxyl groups after the pattern of A-type proanthocyanidin [30]. The strong ABTS radical scavenging activity of phloroglucinol was consistent with the previously reported data [31]. This remarkable antioxidant activity was attributed to the presence of acidic hydrogen [32]. Compound 5 exhibited antioxidant and reducing powers, with an IC50 lower than compound 3. The decrease in the activity of both flavonoids may be related to their glycosylation at C-3 [33].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6895 6 of 17\nTable 2.

Hence, presence of more sugar moieties in phlorin (2) and isorhamnetin glycoside (5) causes a reduction in their antioxidant activity. \u03b2-sitosterol showed weak ABTS activity and no reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). These results matched those in previous reports of this compound [35]."

This is the first report of the isolation of these six constituents from the genus Faucaria. All compounds, except for \u03b2-sitosterol, displayed a remarkable antioxidant activity, as observed using ABTS and FRAP assay methods. Isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside and phlorin were highlighted for their potent inhibitory activity against both tyrosinase and hyaluronidase enzymes using both in vitro and in silico testing. Overall, the obtained results support the applicability of these compounds as pigmentation modulators and means of skin remodelling in the pharmaceutical industry.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28196895/s1, Figure S1: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 (400 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S2: DEPT-Q spectrum of compound 1 (100 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S3: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 (400 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S4: DEPT-Q spectrum of compound 2 (100 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S5: HMBC spectrum of compound 2; Figure S6: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 3 (400 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S7: Negative-mode HR-ESI-MS spectrum of compound 4;\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6895 15 of 17\nFigure S8: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 4 (400 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S9: DEPT-Q spectrum of compound 4 (100 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S10: HSQC spectrum of compound 4; Figure S11: HMBC spectrum of compound 4; Figure S12: NOESY spectrum of compound 4; Figure S13: Expanded NOESY spectrum of compound 4; Figure S14: 1H NMR spectrum of compound 5 (400 MHz, CD3OD); Figure S15: DEPT-Q spectrum of compound 5 (100 MHz, CD3OD).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: H.S.A., H.A., M.A.M., A.I.O. and N.A., Formal analysis: N.A., A.I.O. and H.S.A., investigation H.S.A., M.A.M., H.A. and N.A., resources: E.A., H.W.D., A.S.A. and I.A.N. writing original data: H.S.A., I.A.N., M.A.M., H.W.D., A.S.A. and N.A., writing\u2014review and editing: E.A., H.S.A., M.A.M. and N.A.
