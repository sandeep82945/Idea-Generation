"The current results showed that CR has the effect of improving IC. The integrated analysis revealed three key targets as well as related metabolites and pathways. The targets were further verified by western blotting. This study has provided data and theoretical support for an in-depth study of the mechanism and has laid the foundation for clinical application. The study has also provided a novel paradigm to identify the potential mechanisms of pharmacological effects derived from a natural compound."
