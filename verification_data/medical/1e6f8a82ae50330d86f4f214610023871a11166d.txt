"Finally, conclusions and guidelines for future work are outlined in Section 6."

"A limitation of the present study is that it did not involve predictions for long-term horizons. Although investigating longer prediction horizons is outside the scope of this work, we believe the proposed model ensemble could serve as the basis for designing such a tool. On the other hand, it is quite probable that a different set of input variables, presenting higher correlation with the long-term evolution of the mixed load would be needed in this case."

"Driven by the remarkable performance of the proposed methodology in mixed load forecasting, its application could be extended to other critical sectors of the smart grid, such as forecasting the electricity price and the production from RES, in order to more efficiently schedule conventional sources."
