    "abstractText": "Methods: The tripartite evolutionary game model is proposed in the paper, which composed of local governments, private elderly care institutions and the public. Furthermore, three mechanisms, i.e. dynamic penalty and static subsidy, static penalty and dynamic subsidy, dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy, are designed. Under these different mechanisms, the stability of each subject\u2019s strategy choice is analyzed by using system dynamics simulation.",

The objective of this study is to explore the optimal path for the government to govern the elderly care service market.\nMethods: The tripartite evolutionary game model is proposed in the paper, which composed of local governments, private elderly care institutions and the public. Furthermore, three mechanisms, i.e. dynamic penalty and static subsidy, static penalty and dynamic subsidy, dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy, are designed. Under these different mechanisms, the stability of each subject\u2019s strategy choice is analyzed by using system dynamics simulation.\nResults: The introduction of dynamic mechanisms can compensate for the inability of static mechanisms to bring the system to a steady state. The dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism allows the system to evolve to the desired point of stability. The self-discipline behavior of private elderly care institutions is positively correlated with penalties and reputation gains-losses, negatively correlated with subsidies, and not correlated with supervision rewards. Excessive subsidies will promote the collusion of private elderly institutions.\nConclusion: Only when the local government adopts the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism will private elderly care institutions choose to operate in a fully self-disciplined manner. Reasonable adjustments of penalties, reputation gains-losses and subsidies can not only further optimize the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism, but also help to achieve diversified regulatory objectives of the government. This study would provide a reference for local governments seeking to develop effective regulatory policies for the elderly service market.\nKEYWORDS\nelderly care service, government governance, regulatory mechanism, evolutionary game, system dynamics\n1.

The role of social capital in the elderly service system cannot be\u00a0ignored. In 2013, the Chinese government issued \u201cSeveral Opinions on Accelerating the Development of the Elderly Service Industry,\u201d proposing to improve the market mechanism and support social forces to run elderly institutions (9). In 2016, the Chinese government released \u201cSeveral Opinions on Comprehensively Liberalizing the Elderly Care Service Market and Improving the Quality of Elderly Care Services,\u201d which proposed to further relax the access conditions and optimize the market environment (10). In 2021, the Chinese government released the \u201c14th Five-Year Plan for the Development of National Aging Cause and Elderly Care Service System,\u201d which once again emphasized the need to fully mobilize the participation of social forces (11). However, as the role of social capital in the elderly service system gradually changes from \u201csupplement\u201d to \u201csupport,\u201d the corresponding service quality problems also gradually appear. The late formation of China\u2019s pension service market makes a series of top-level policy design relatively lagging behind, and the basic support for social capital is also insufficient. This makes it difficult to fundamentally improve the service quality of the elderly service market, and the problem of imperfect regulatory mechanisms still exists (12).\nAs is well-known, service quality is the necessary basis for the survival and development of elderly care institutions. The government supervision is an important guarantee for elderly care institutions to improve their service quality level. However, over the years, the high construction investment and low returns of private elderly care institutions have put the private elderly care institutions under greater operational pressure (13). This encourages them to pursue low-quality services that may reduce costs. For example, in 2015, a private elderly care institution in Henan Province cut corners in the construction of firefighting infrastructure to save costs, leading to a major fire (14). In 2020, another private elderly care institution in Sichuan Province did not provide services for the older adult according to the contracted content (15). In 2022, some private elderly care institutions in Shandong Province failed the sampling inspection of food service (16). The speculative operation of private elderly care institutions not only infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of the older adult, but also increased the difficulty of government supervision. On the one hand, due to the particularity of service, the speculative operation of private elderly care institutions is not easy to be\u00a0observed directly. On the other hand, the existing government supervision mechanism is also difficult to fundamentally eliminate the speculative operation of private elderly care institutions. Therefore, it is urgent for the government to establish an effective regulatory mechanism to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the elderly service industry.\nPrevious studies are mainly focused on the supervision of the elderly care service market and the coping strategies of various elderly care service problems. Based on the background of \u201cInternet and community elderly care,\u201d Wang et\u00a0al. (17) constructed a four-party evolutionary game model. The research results showed that the collaborative supervision of government and seniors has a greater impact on the behavior strategy of suppliers and platforms. Krings et\u00a0al. (18) analyzed China\u2019s aging dilemma and aging policies, noted that the Chinese government\u2019s aging policies are similar to those of Western countries and are converge toward home care, informal care, and healthy aging. Hung (19) assessed the gaps in smart home care technology and policy formulation that Chinese policymakers need to\naddress. Lopreite et\u00a0al. (20, 21) studied the relationship between aging and health expenditure, and proposed that government policies should balance economic, social, and health in order to improve the quality of life of older adults in their later years and achieve sustainable economic development. Pf\u00f6rtner et\u00a0al. (22) and Hower et\u00a0al. (23) pointed out that nursing facilities are facing challenges such as rising costs and staff shortages during the COVID-19 epidemic, and timely actions should be\u00a0taken to ensure the provision of long-term care services. Song et\u00a0al. (24) studied the market-based transformation of elderly care services and founded that active government response to public needs and preferences and the establishment of market regulation measures can be\u00a0effective in improving social welfare. Lim (25) concluded that government supervision and education are necessary to strengthen the professionalism of nursing staff through in-depth interviews with 10 nursing staff. The above studies are from the perspective of government, and less consideration is given to other stakeholders in the supply of elderly care services. Furthermore, most of the studies on regulation focus on the supervision objectives with the best results, but lack of consideration of supervision objectives such as improving market robustness and speeding up market stability.\nThe static reward and static punishment mechanism are used to discuss the impact of government penalties and rewards on the market. For example, Li et\u00a0al. (26) developed a game model of the evolution of the governance mechanism of the recycling industry and analyzed the effect of government penalty intensity on the behavioral strategies of recycling firms. Zhu et\u00a0al. (27) introduced the random punishment mechanism into the treatment of kitchen waste. The results verified that the random punishment mechanism is more conducive to the system to reach a stable state. Wang et\u00a0al. (28) designed a penalty linkage mechanism and founded that the penalty linkage mechanism can promote the development of the electronic recycling industry in the initial stage. In addition, the dynamic reward and dynamic punishment mechanism are also established. For example, Sun et\u00a0al. (29) analyzed the impact of pure reward and rewarddominated penalty-supplemented schemes on the behavior choices of game subjects. Based on the background of carbon emission reduction. He\u00a0 et al. (30) proposed an evolutionary game model to study the government\u2019s regulatory strategy on straw biomass energy supply chain, in which that the dynamic penalty strategy is conducive to the sustainable development of biomass energy supply chain. The reward and punishment, as the intervention means often used by the government to regulate the market, have good incentive and restraint effects, but the proposed dynamic reward and dynamic punishment mechanism are mainly based on the government and the private sector. Also, they are lack of discussion on the dynamic reward and dynamic punishment mechanism under the participation of multiple agents, and consideration on the non-linear dynamic reward or punishment mechanism. This is not conducive to the depiction of the reality of the market.\nAs the end consumers of various products and services, the supervision behavior of the public is undoubtedly an important factor affecting the quality of products and services, and also another important topic related to this study. Through analysis, Zhou et\u00a0al. (31) found that the establishment of a supervision mechanism with public participation can control the non-green behavior of enterprises and increase their demand for renewable energy. Feng et\u00a0al. (32) introduced the public monitoring into the railroad transportation safety regulation model, and the results showed that the increase in the proportion of public monitoring was beneficial to improve the proportion of railroad safety production. Liu et\u00a0al. (33) argued that\nFrontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin.org\nthe public\u2019s negative participation in monitoring is not conducive to government monitoring of the green building supply market. Dong et\u00a0al. (34) explored the impact of public supervision on industrial pollution control from the perspective of the government. Yang et\u00a0al. (35) constructed an evolutionary game model consisting of regulators, energy companies and whistleblowers in which each party\u2019s strategy choice is analyzed. Note that, the existing literature on the supervision of pension services are mainly focused on the regulatory role of the government and the older adult, which ignores that the public is an indispensable participant.\nAs is well-known, evolutionary game theory (EGT) (36) is often used to quantify the government\u2019s intervention measures. Some scholars have discussed the relationship among the actors in the senior care service market by building evolutionary game model. For example, Sun et\u00a0al. (37) developed an evolutionary game model to analyze the effect of government subsidies on the cooperation strategies of health care organizations and elderly social care organizations. Zhang and Yao (38) took the government as one of the game subjects to explore the inhibitory effect of government regulation on the speculative behavior of health-care PPP project operators. Yue and Lin (39) constructed a two-party game model to analyze the impact of punishment and operation subsidy on the quality supervision of pension PPP projects. Wang and Cui (40) used the EGT to analyze the different reward and punishment mechanisms between local governments and elderly care institutions, and pointed out that the dynamic reward mechanism is more conducive to the elderly care institutions to adopt self-discipline management behavior. Therefore, EGT is also suitable for the study of elderly care service quality supervision under multi-subject supervision.\nIn summary, the existing literature mainly discusses the government participation in the supervision of the pension service market and the game relationship among the main bodies in the pension service market. There is a lack of in-depth discussion on the differences of different combinations of subsidies and penalties under the public participate in supervision. On the other hand, the literature analyzing the government\u2019s intervention behavior on the service supply behavior of private elderly care institutions mostly focuses on static reward and static penalty mechanism, with little consideration of non-linear dynamic reward and dynamic penalty mechanism. What is more, there is no consideration of the study of the relevant parameters adjustment priorities from the different regulatory objectives of the government.\nTherefore, the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. Firstly, considering the supervision behavior of the public, the dynamic reward and penalty mechanism is proposed, which is more appropriate to the actual situation. Secondly, from the different regulatory objectives of the government, the priorities of the relevant parameters of adjustment are studied to facilitate the government to prescribe the right medicine. Thirdly, a non-linear dynamic subsidy method is proposed, in which there is a parabolic relationship between subsidy and self-discipline management willingness of private elderly care institutions. This can more truly reflect the government\u2019s subsidy behavior. Note that, the nonlinear dynamic subsidy method is similar to literature (41). However, there are differences in the following three aspects. (i) Our paper presents the static penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism which is compared with other mechanisms (for details, see Section 4). (ii) In this paper, the public monitoring behavior is introduced. Furthermore, the impacts of different behavior strategies of private elderly care institutions on the older adult are quantified. (iii)\nThis paper examines the priority of adjustment of relevant parameters from different regulatory objectives of the government. It may provide a decision-making reference for the government\u2019s policy regulation."

Thus, the initial value of e is set to 0.79. The values of g and p are, respectively, set to 0.20 and 0.10 with reference to literature (49). According to the \u201cMeasures for the Management of Operating Subsidies for Elderly Care Institutions in Beijing,\u201d elderly care institutions that meet the star rating standards can receive subsidies ranging from 600, 1,200, and 1,800 yuan per bed per year. In particular, two-star elderly care institutions, which account for nearly 70% of all star-qualified pension institutions, can receive a subsidy of 600 yuan per bed per year. Therefore, taking two-star elderly care institutions as an example, based on a single elderly care institution with 300 beds and a bed utilization rate of 46.71% (50). The total annual subsidy received by all elderly care institutions in Beijing is RMB 38.51 million, i.e., S = 0 385. . The average annual profit of a single elderly care institutions in Beijing is RMB 0.9151 million, so the total annual profit of all elderly care institutions in Beijing is RMB 52984 million. Then, Rh is about 5.298. In general, the speculative profits is higher than self-regulated profits. With reference to the literature (41), set Rl = 6.248. According to the \u201cReport on the Development of Aging in Beijing (2021),\u201d the registered population aged 60 and above in Beijing is 3.883\u00a0million, accounting for 27.5% of the total registered population. Taking the proportion of the older adult in the total population as the probability of social welfare or loss felt by the public, it is easily obtained that \u03b1 = 0 275. . The specific parameters and initial value are shown in Table\u00a04. Under the initial parameters, Lyapunov\u2019s first method is used again to judge the stability of each equilibrium point, and the results are shown in Table\u00a05.

China\u2019s policy stipulates that all elderly care institutions that meet the quality standards can enjoy subsidies. Then the dynamic subsidy function can also be\u00a0designed according to the supply willingness of private elderly care institutions. However, unlike dynamic penalty, local governments are constrained by costs and tend to relax incentives after achieving the desired goals. Therefore, the dynamic subsidy function can be\u00a0designed as S e e e( ) = \u2212 + +2 \u03b8 \u03c9, where \u03b8 and \u03c9 are constants. The system dynamics model under the static penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism is shown in Figure\u00a05.\nAssume that the initial willingness of the three game subjects is (0.79, 0.2, 0.1), and set \u03b8 = 0 8. , \u03c9 = 0 1. , FINAL TIME = 200.

Furthermore, the priority of government policy adjustment in each scenario will also be\u00a0analyzed. The simulation of the main parameters is shown in Figure\u00a010.\nAs can be\u00a0seen in Figure\u00a010, as penalties and reputational gainslosses increase, private elderly care institutions will more actively choose to provide high-quality services. When the subsidies increase, the enthusiasm of private elderly care institutions to supply highquality services will wane. This is because of that, the increased penalties and reputational gains-losses can increase the cost of speculation for private elderly care institutions and deter them from operating speculatively. The increase of subsidies will make the elderly service market which is not fully self-discipline get more subsidies. In this case, private elderly care institutions will collude. Some of them will choose to speculate, and others will continue to maintain selfdiscipline, in order to maximize the total subsidies received by the pension service market. The local governments\u2019 rewards for the public supervision basically has little impact on the strategy choice of private elderly care institutions. That is, under the current public supervision willingness, the role of public supervision is limited.\nFor further study, the main parameters are compared in Table\u00a07.\n1. It can be\u00a0seen from Table\u00a07 that, under different parameter values, the minimum willingness of private elderly care institutions to provide high-quality services is lower than the initial willingness. Compared with subsidies and reputation gains-losses, the increase of penalties makes the minimum value of strategy choice of private elderly care institutions significantly increase. This implies that, increasing penalties can significantly improve the stability of the strategy evolution of private elderly care institutions. Therefore, if local governments are committed to improving market robustness, adjusting the penalties should be\u00a0first considered. 2. It follows from Table\u00a07 that, the speed of private elderly care institutions to reach a stable state is the fastest when the penalties and reputation gains-losses take a larger value, reaching a stable state on the 21st and 38th day, respectively.

The corresponding time difference is 61 days. Therefore, if the local governments are committed to speeding up market stability, adjusting the penalties should be\u00a0first considered. 3. According to the difference between the final strategy choice ratio and the initial strategy choice ratio of private elderly care institutions in Table\u00a07, both subsidies and supervision rewards can cause a large change in the strategy choice of private elderly care institutions when they take different values. When the supervision rewards apply different values, the evolutionary trajectory of private elderly care institutions does not change, and thus will not be\u00a0 considered. When the penalties and reputation gains-losses are small, the change of strategy choice of private elderly care institutions is also small, which are 0.0713 and 0.1631, respectively. Therefore, if local governments are committed to making the policy achieve better results, adjusting subsidies should be\u00a0first considered."

Using\nsystem dynamics theory, the evolutionary trajectories and steady states of the corresponding evolutionary equilibrium points under various mechanisms are then analyzed. The main suggestions are proposed as follows:\nFirstly, the local governments\u2019 policies on penalties and subsidies should be\u00a0dynamically adjusted according to the behavior of private elderly care institutions. Under the static penalty and static subsidy mechanism adopted by the government, the service supply behavior of private elderly care institutions is uncertain. This mechanism will not only increase the financial burden of local governments, but also is not conducive to the healthy development of the elderly service market. Dynamic penalty and static subsidy mechanism, and static penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism can make the strategy choice of private elderly care institutions reach a stable state, but private elderly care institutions still have a certain probability to choose to provide low-quality services. Only when the government adopts the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism, the behavioral evolution of private elderly care institutions can reach the most ideal state. Therefore, the government should pay close attention to the behavior of private elderly care institutions and make dynamic adjustments to the punishment and subsidy policies according to the behavior of private elderly care institutions.\nSecondly, appropriately increase penalties, reduce subsidies, encourage media participation in reporting, and publicize assessment results. When the local governments adopt the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism, the self-discipline behavior of private elderly care institutions is positively correlated with the penalties and reputation gains-losses, and negatively correlated with the subsidies. Specifically, increasing penalties can restrain the speculation of private elderly care institutions, but excessive penalties are not conducive to"

Increasing subsidies may make private elderly care institutions conspire to defraud the government of subsidies, which is not conducive to the improvement of the quality of elderly services. Therefore, penalties should be\u00a0appropriately increased, subsidies should be\u00a0reduced, and the level of reputational gains-losses should be\u00a0 increased through media engagement and publicity.\nFinally, select appropriate parameters to adjust according to the government\u2019s objectives. The government\u2019s regulation of the elderly service market is often based on certain objectives, such as improving market robustness, speeding up market stability, or making the policy achieve better results. If the government\u2019s regulatory goal is to improve market robustness or speed up market stability, the government should first adjust the punitive measures. If the government\u2019s regulatory goal is to make the policy achieve better results, it will be\u00a0an appropriate choice for the government to adjust the subsidies first.\nThe aforementioned statements are significantly different from the conclusions obtained by Ren et\u00a0al. (51). In their paper, increased penalties are more conducive to the evolution of the system to the desired steady state when the government takes strict supervision as a long-term strategy, but they fail to consider that overly harsh regulation may not be\u00a0conducive to the entry of market players. In addition, they neglect the influence of collusive behavior of service providers on subsidy strategy formulation, and thus they argue that subsidies help the system achieve the desired state under the cyclical subsidy mechanism. Also, the punishment and subsidy mechanism they proposed is static, which cannot be\u00a0 dynamically adjusted according to the behavior choice of service providers."

            "text": "Using evolutionary game theory and system dynamics theory, the supervision of local governments on private elderly care institutions is discussed in this paper. The results show that: First of all, when the local governments adopt the static supervision mechanism, the game behaviors of private elderly care institutions, local governments, and the public cannot reach a stable state, while when the local governments adopt the dynamic supervision mechanism, the strategy choices of the three parties\u2019 game subjects will reach a stable state. Secondly, among these dynamic supervision mechanisms, although the dynamic penalty and static subsidy mechanism, as well as the static penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism can make the strategy choice of private elderly care institutions reach a stable state, private elderly care institutions still have a certain probability to choose to provide low-quality services. Only when the local governments adopt the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism, will the private elderly care institutions choose to operate with complete selfdiscipline. Moreover, under the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism, the willingness of self-discipline management of private elderly care institutions is positively related to penalties and reputation gains-losses, negatively related to subsidies, and not related to supervision rewards. Reasonable adjustment of these\nparameters can further optimize the dynamic penalty and dynamic subsidy mechanism. Thirdly, the government can first adjust penalties so that private elderly care institutions have greater stability in their strategic choices and reach stability more quickly. The government can also adjust the subsidies first to make the stability strategy of private elderly care institutions the most ideal.\nAlthough the results of this paper are reasonable and meaningful, there are still some deficiencies in parameters design. In fact, taxation and consumer guidance are also important regulatory tools of government. For future research, therefore, the punishment, subsidy, taxation, and consumption guidance will be\u00a0 comprehensively considered, and the impact of the cross effects of various regulatory tools on the supervision of elderly care services will be\u00a0analyzed."
