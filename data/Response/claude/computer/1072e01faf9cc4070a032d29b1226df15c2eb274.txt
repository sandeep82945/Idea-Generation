 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on Federated Client-side Intellectual Property Protection (FedCIP):

1. Investigate more optimized approaches for watermark embedding that minimize impact on model accuracy. The current approach uses fixed values for parameters like α and β. Research could explore techniques like meta-learning to find optimal values for each model.

2. Explore more sophisticated traitor tracking mechanisms beyond relying on number of leaks. For example, assigning trust scores to clients based on factors like training performance could help identify likely traitors. 

3. Evaluate FedCIP on larger scale federated learning settings with more clients. The current experiments use only 10 clients. Testing on settings with 100s or 1000s of clients can reveal scalability challenges.

4. Extend FedCIP to other federated learning algorithms beyond FedAvg. New aggregation algorithms like FedProx could interact differently with the watermarking approach.

5. Investigate the use of different watermark encoding schemes beyond binary watermarks. Techniques like spread spectrum watermarking may improve robustness against attacks.
