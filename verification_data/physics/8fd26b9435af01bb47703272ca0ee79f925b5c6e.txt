"To summarize, further research is needed to better understand the concentration range of various cations in cardiomyocytes, a topic which is still is largely unknown, which makes it challenging to assess their potential toxic effects."

"Therefore, it is necessary to study whether cardiac troponin C and atrial and ventricular myosin regulatory light chains could be potential targets for these cations."

"Therefore, further investigation is necessary to fully understand the possibility of cations binding by a myosin ATP-binding pocket."

"It is important to consider the possibility that ATPase activity may be influenced not only by cation interactions with the myosin ATP-binding pocket but also by metal binding to the RLC."

"The main question is whether cations could influence myosin and troponin kinetics in real conditions."

"In addition, the affinity of EF-hand-like Ca2+ binding sites or other targets for divalent ions may be significantly altered by amino acid substitutions or post-translational modification."
