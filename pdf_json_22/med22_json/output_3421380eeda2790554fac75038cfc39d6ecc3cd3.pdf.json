Here\nwe have localized these cavities by X-ray crystallography of xenon-derivatized\n\u03b21AR crystals. One of the cavities is in direct contact with the cholesterol binding pocket. Solution NMR shows that addition of the cholesterol analog cholesteryl\nhemisuccinate impedes the formation of the active conformation of detergent-\nsolubilized \u03b21AR by blocking conserved G protein-coupled receptor microswitches, concomitant with an affinity reduction of both isoprenaline and G\nprotein-mimicking nanobody Nb80 for \u03b21AR detected by isothermal titration calorimetry. This wedge-like action explains the function of cholesterol as a\nnegative allosteric modulator of \u03b21AR. The detailed understanding of GPCR regulation by cholesterol via filling of a dry void and the easy scouting for such\nvoids by xenon may provide new routes for the development of allosteric drugs.\n- 3 -"

            "text": "The interiors of experimentally determined protein structures often contain\ncavities, which are not filled by protein atoms. Such cavities may or may not be occupied by water1\u20133, which is often hard to decide due to the difficulties in detecting the highly mobile3 water molecules in protein interiors. Hydrophilic\ncavities are highly likely to be hydrated with water, which makes hydrogen bonds to the protein1,2. Hydrophobic cavities are much less likely to be hydrated, but the\ncomplete absence of water is difficult to prove. Several cases of partially or\ncompletely empty hydrophobic cavities have been unambiguously identified using X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy4\u20137. These observations are so\nfar limited to a few model systems, and it is unclear to what extent such dry voids\nare connected to protein function and structural stability.\nRecent high-pressure NMR analysis has shown that such a functional role exists in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)8. GPCRs are transmembrane\nproteins that regulate many vital functions of the human body, and as such are\nhighly attractive drug targets. They recognize a variety of extracellular stimuli and subsequently trigger intracellular downstream signaling cascades9. GPCR\nfunction is achieved by a high intrinsic flexibility, which allows the interchange between several conformations encoding inactive and active states10\u201318. Notably,\nthe static, crystallographic structures of binary GPCR complexes with agonists\nand antagonists in the absence of a G protein or a G protein mimetic are very similar and do not reflect their functional difference17. In contrast, NMR has\nshown that the binary agonist\u00b7receptor complexes, but not the\nantagonist\u00b7receptor complexes, are in a dynamical equilibrium between a preactive and an active conformation10. The active conformation largely\ncorresponds to the conformation in ternary complexes with G protein or G\nprotein-mimicking nanobodies (Nbs) where transmembrane helices (TM) 5 and 6 have moved outward to accommodate the G protein/Nb19 and the watermediated H-bond bridge between Y5.58 and Y7.53 (YY-lock, superscripts indicate Ballesteros\u2212Weinstein numbering20) is closed10,21. In contrast, the preactive\nconformation of the agonist complex largely resembles the inactive conformation of antagonist complexes with an open YY-lock10. G protein recognition of agonist-\n- 4 -\nreceptor complexes apparently occurs by conformational selection of the active\nconformation.\nThe conformational equilibria of GPCRs are sensitive to many factors, for\nexample point mutations, pressure and the lipid environment. Point mutations,\nintroduced to stabilize the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR) for structural studies, increase the melting temperature in detergent micelles by up to ~30 \u02daC, but shift the equilibria towards an inactive receptor11,22\u201325. In particular, mutations of the highly conserved26,27 Y2275.58 and Y3437.53 residues, increase the melting\ntemperature by 11 \u02daC, but suppress the formation of the active conformation in binary agonist complexes thereby abrogating G-protein binding10,11.\nWe have recently shown that pressure modulates these conformational equilibria in the less thermostabilized \u03b21AR mutant YY-\u03b21AR8, which retains the two tyrosines Y2275.58 and Y3437.53 and is capable of G protein binding. When\nsubjected to pressure (midpoint ~600 bar), YY-\u03b21AR is shifted from a mixture of\npreactive and active conformations to a fully populated active conformation even\nin the absence of a G protein or G protein-mimicking nanobody. This pressure dependence shows that the active conformation has an about 100 \u00c53 smaller\nvolume than the preactive conformation, which must be due to the collapse of\nempty (not water-filled) cavities within the receptor-detergent micelle.\nAn important, extrinsic factor modulating GPCR conformational equilibria are lipids, with cholesterol (CLR) being the most explored28\u201332. CLR is highly\nabundant in human cells and is essential for maintaining cell excitability and homeostasis32\u201340. CLR increases GPCR thermal stability41\u201347 and often acts as an allosteric modulator of GPCR activity48\u201353. The direction of modulation can vary, as CLR e.g. stabilizes the inactive state of CCK1R49 and the active state of BLT2R52. The molecular mechanisms of such effects are not well understood.\nThey may result from direct interactions with receptors, as observed in multiple GPCR crystal structures54\u201361, or more indirectly by a modulation of membrane\nphysical properties such as fluidity and stiffness which could influence the conformational equilibria and spatial organization of the receptor36,62\u201365.\nAs CLR is highly insoluble, commonly its more soluble analog, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) is used in functional and structural studies46,52. CHS\n- 5 -\ninduces similar thermo-stabilizing effects as CLR53 and molecular dynamics\nsimulations show that protonated CHS mimics well many of the membrane modulating properties of CLR66. CLR and CHS are the most prevalent lipids\nresolved in GPCR structures, but often resolution is not high enough to distinguish between the two40,61. Although the well-defined localization of\nCLR/CHS in these structures suggests specific binding, no conserved binding sites have been identified61, even for closely related GPCRs such as the \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs54,67,68. Instead, CLR or CHS appear at multiple sites, usually in shallow grooves between the transmembrane helices or at the receptor surface32,61.\nHydrophobic voids tend to incorporate noble gases5. Here we have detected\nhydrophobic voids in \u03b21AR using crystallography of xenon-derivatized receptor\ncrystals. One of the identified voids is in direct contact with the CHS binding site.\nAn NMR analysis of the effect of CHS binding to an agonist-\u03b21AR complex shows that CHS restricts the receptor dynamics and hinders the formation of the active\nstate. Furthermore, CHS reduces the affinity of the agonist for the apo receptor\nand of the G protein mimicking Nb80 for the agonist-bound receptor. These\nfindings can be rationalized by a careful comparison of \u03b21AR structures, which reveals that CHS bound to the inactive receptor obstructs the path of subtle, but\nessential movements required to activate the canonical microswitch GPCR\nnetwork. Thus, CHS apparently acts like a wedge blocking a void necessary for\n\u03b21AR activation. The observed phenomenon of functional dry voids together with\nthe possibility to easily detect such voids by xenon may introduce a valuable new\nprinciple to search for relevant drug target sites in proteins.\n- 6 -"

            "text": "Xenon reveals empty cavities in agonist-bound \u03b21AR To localize the hydrophobic voids within \u03b21AR, we have obtained crystals of a thermostabilized mutant (TS-\u03b21AR)11 bound to the agonist isoprenaline and\nderivatized these with xenon under low (5\u201310 bar) pressure. Xenon is easily\ndetected and localized using X-ray crystallography due to its anomalous scattering and large number of electrons5,69. As dry xenon immediately destroyed\nthe fragile receptor crystals, the xenon derivatization was carried out in a home-\nbuilt pressurizing device (Figure 1A), where a defined humidity could be set by\nflowing xenon through a wash bottle before reaching the crystal pressure\nchamber. An electronic humidity sensor and a glass window in the crystal\npressure chamber allowed continuous monitoring of humidity and crystal integrity\nunder a microscope. The best results with no observable crystal damage were\nachieved by pressurizing the crystals with xenon for 20 min at 5 bar and 100%\nrelative humidity (4 \u00b0C) using pure water as the washing liquid.\nThe structure of the isoprenaline\u00b7\u03b21AR complex determined from the xenon-\nderivatized crystals (Table S1) is almost identical to the previously solved\nstructure of a similar \u03b21AR construct in complex with the same agonist (PDB 2y03)67 (Figure S1A). Both structures have two receptor molecules in identical\narrangement in the asymmetric unit with an overall C\u03b1 root-mean-square\ndeviation (RMSD) of 0.705 \u00c5 (0.607 \u00c5 excluding loops). However, the large\nanisotropy of the Xe-derivatized crystals prevented localization of the\nisoprenaline and CHS molecules observed in the 2y03 structure. Two xenon\nbinding sites (Xe1, Xe2) were located unambiguously (signal amplitudes >5\u03c3)\nwithin the anomalous scattering Fourier map of each of four different crystals\n(Figures 1B, C and S1B, Table S2). A refinement of the anomalous scattering\ndensity yielded single Xe atom occupancies of 0.15 and 0.18 at sites Xe1 and\nXe2, respectively. Xe1 is positioned towards the intracellular side between TM3\nand TM4, and Xe2 towards the extracellular side between TM2 and TM3. Both\nxenon binding sites constitute crevices, which are formed almost exclusively by\nhydrophobic side chains (Figure S2A, B). A control diffraction on a crystal from\n- 7 -\nthe same crystallization batch without xenon derivatization showed no\nanomalous scattering signal >5\u03c3 (Figure S1B).\nA computational search for cavities in the 2y03 isoprenaline\u00b7\u03b21AR structure, with water and detergent molecules (including CHS) removed, revealed 15 voids\n(Figure 1C), two of which are larger and exposed to water at the extracellular and\nintracellular faces of the receptor. The remaining cavities are smaller and buried\nin the hydrophobic membrane part of the receptor. Two of these overlap with the\nXe1 and Xe2 sites (Figure 1B, C). An analysis of the computed cavities showed\nno significant differences of hydrophobicity between the two cavities harboring\nxenon and the other 11 interior cavities not filled by xenon (Table S3). Thus\nxenon selectively detects a subset of all interior cavities.\nThe smaller of the computed voids (~20 \u00c53) overlapping with the xenon sites\nlargely coincides with the volume of the Xe2 site detected by the xenon anomalous scattering. The larger void (~35 \u00c53) constitutes a hydrophobic groove,\nwhich is partially but not completely filled by the CHS molecule in the 2y03\nstructure (Figure 1C). The detected xenon volume at Xe1 resides in the\nremaining non-filled part of the groove and is in direct contact with the space\noccupied by the CHS molecule. Despite not being deeply inserted between the\nhelices, CHS is stabilized by an extensive set of hydrophobic interactions\ninvolving TM3, TM4, and TM5 (Figure S2C). Notably, the hydrophilic CHS\nsuccinic acid tail is not in direct contact with the receptor, but points towards the\nsolvent thereby leaving the Xe1 part of the hydrophobic groove unoccupied. From\nthis arrangement, it is sterically possible that in the native membrane the sterol\nmoiety of CLR fully occupies the Xe1 pocket.\nCHS obstructs pressure-induced receptor activation To investigate the effect of CHS on the receptor void volumes, we acquired pressure-dependent 1H-15N transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) spectra of the G protein binding-competent 15N-valine-labelled isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR complex10,11 in the presence (Figure 2A) and absence\n(Figure 2B) of CHS. Besides small chemical shift changes and variations in intensity (see below), the valine 1H-15N resonances are very similar at 1 bar with\nand without CHS. However, when the pressure is increased to 2500 bar, the\n- 8 -\nspectra diverge strongly. Without CHS, the previously observed8 pressure-\ninduced change to the active conformation is evident from strong shifts of the V1223.33, V1724.56, V202ECL2, and V3146.59 resonances (Figure 2B) around the\northosteric ligand pocket (see also Figure 3B). In contrast, these active-\nconformation resonances almost disappear with CHS at 2500 bar. In addition,\nmany of the other resonances are broadened and shifted to the center of the NH\nspectral region, which is indicative of local unfolding and an exchange between many conformations (Figure 2A, C). Only few resonances, such as V892.52, V1032.66, and V320ECL3 remain intense, which must be due to either fast\nexchange between local subconformations or the absence of local heterogeneity. Monitoring the receptor stability from the intensity of amide 1HN resonances\nrevealed that the addition of CHS leads to a considerably faster sample decay at\n2500 bar, whereas CHS stabilizes the sample at 1 bar (Figure S3). The\ndisappearance of resonances is due to the formation of large NMR-invisible\naggregates and precipitation. Taken together these observations show that CHS\nblocks the activating motion at 2500 bar, and directs the receptor to unstable,\npresumably partially unfolded conformations that lead to precipitation."

            "text": "The blocking of the isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR active state by CHS is already apparent from a careful comparison of 1H-15N TROSY spectra at 1 bar in the\npresence and absence of CHS (Figure 3A and S4). Moderate chemical shift changes induced by CHS on V1604.44, V1293.40 and other nearby valines (Figure\n3A,B yellow labels) indicate minor effects on the local conformations of \u03b21AR by CHS and show that in solution CHS binds to a location on the receptor that is similar to the CHS binding site in the crystal. As observed previously8,10, the resonances of V1724.56, V202ECL2, and V3146.59 are split without CHS into a major\nform and a minor form corresponding to the preactive and active conformations\nin slow (>5 ms) chemical exchange. Their average intensity ratio corresponds to\nan active population of ~19% (Figure 3C and S4). In the presence of CHS, the\nresonances of the active conformation are no longer visible, indicating that its\npopulation should be smaller than ~13% using the spectral noise as detection\n- 9 -\nlimit. Thus, CHS appears to shift the preactive-active equilibrium towards the\npreactive conformation for isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR at ambient pressure.\nThis CHS-induced equilibrium shift is confirmed by the analysis of a further \u03b21AR mutant, YY-\u03b21AR-V129I, in which the thermostabilizing mutation I1293.40V was reverted to the native isoleucine. In the isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR-V1293.40I complex, the preactive-active conformational equilibrium is strongly shifted\ntowards the active conformation, whereas the conformations of receptor\ncomplexes with antagonists remain unchanged (Grahl et al. in preparation). The effect of the I1293.40V mutation on the preactive-active equilibrium is apparent in the 1H-15N TROSY spectrum of 15N-valine-labeled YY-\u03b21AR-V1293.40I in complex with isoprenaline in the absence of CHS (Figure 3A). This shows strong activeconformation resonances for V1223.33, V1724.56, V202ECL2, and V3146.59 and\nalmost no preactive-conformation resonances. In contrast, in the presence of\nCHS, the active-conformation resonances show reduced intensities but remain\nwell observable, whereas the intensities of the preactive-conformation\nresonances are increased to about the same magnitude. A quantitative analysis\nof the intensities (Figure 3C) indicates a population of the active conformation\nlarger than ~80% without CHS, whereas this population decreases to ~50% in\nthe presence of CHS. Thus, CHS also shifts the preactive-active equilibrium towards the preactive conformation for the YY-\u03b21AR-V1293.40I mutant in complex with isoprenaline.\nIncreasing the CHS concentration from 1 to 2 mM further decreased the population of the active conformation for isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR-V1293.40I to\n~40% (Figure S4) showing that the apparent affinity of the CHS binding site must\nbe in the micro- to millimolar range. In contrast, doubling the concentration of\nisoprenaline from 2 to 4 mM did not significantly change the preactive-active\nequilibrium (Figure S4). This indicates that the orthosteric binding site is fully\noccupied by isoprenaline and argues against the possibility that CHS competes with isoprenaline for the orthosteric site as suggested previously70. The binding\nof low-affinity ligands like CHS may cause broadening of resonances due to\nintermediate time-scale (micro- to millisecond) exchange. However, CHS does\nnot induce large changes in the line shapes and total integrals of the preactive-\n- 10 -\nand active-conformation resonances of V1223.33, V1724.56, V202ECL2, and V3146.59, and it also does not affect the resonance intensities and line shapes of other residues such as V892.52 and V1032.65, which can be used as a reference.\nTherefore, the reduced intensities of the active conformation must be due to a\ntrue population change and not to a bleaching of resonances from intermediate\nexchange. Overall, the effects of CHS both on the pressure-dependent \u03b21AR spectra and on the preactive-active equilibrium at ambient pressure show that\nCHS apparently acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the internal activating motions of\nthe receptor.\nCHS reduces the affinity of both isoprenaline and Nb80 for \u03b21AR To further understand the implications of the CHS interaction with \u03b21AR we performed isothermal titration calorimetry experiments (ITC) with orthosteric and\nallosteric ligands in the absence and presence of CHS (Figure 5). These titrations revealed that CHS reduces the affinity of isoprenaline for apo YY-\u03b21AR-V1293.40I 6.5-fold (KD = 11 \u03bcM vs 1.7 \u03bcM), whereas the affinity of Nb80 for the isoprenaline-\nbound receptor decreases 2.5-fold (KD = 107 nM vs 42 nM). These results clearly show the negative allosteric effects of CHS on the biochemical behavior of both\nthe orthosteric and the effector binding sites and are in complete agreement with\nthe NMR findings of inhibition of the active conformation."

Although CHS was added during the preparation of both complexes67,71, an\nordered CHS molecule is only detected in the binary preactive complex. In the\n\u03b21AR preactive conformation, CHS makes extensive, hydrophobic contacts to residues in TM3, TM4 and TM5 (Figure 4A and S2C). In the active state, the\nintracellular part of TM5 swings out of the helical bundle, but the center and\nextracellular parts move inward and slide by ~2.5 \u00c5 towards the intracellular side (Figure 4A). This would lead to a sterical clash of the I2145.45 and I2185.49 side\n- 11 -\nchains with the aliphatic end of CHS in the preactive structure. Similarly, the\nintracellular part of TM4 in the active structure moves towards the CHS position by 1.5 \u00c5 and would cause a clash of V1604.44 and T1644.48 with the hydrophilic\ntail of CHS. These clashes of CHS with the active \u03b21AR conformation may explain\nthe absence of an ordered CHS molecule in the active structure. Besides such\nrepulsive forces, the inactive conformation seems further stabilized by attractive interactions from CHS to residues E1303.41, I1373.48 and P2195.50, which may\nprevent the inward motion of TM3 and the sliding of TM5 required to reach the\nactive conformation.\nTaken together, CHS apparently blocks the motions of TM3-5, which activate\nthe canonical GPCR microswitch signaling network (Figure 4A,B). In particular, these comprise the inward motion of residues I1293.40 (PIF motif) and R1393.50 (DRY motif) in TM3, which push TM6 outwards via F2996.44 and L2896.34, as well as the downward motion of Y2275.58 in TM5, which enables formation of the conserved YY-lock with Y3437.53 (NPxxY motif) in TM7 that stabilizes the swungout position of TM610.\nThe detected Xe sites are conserved allosteric binding pockets To further understand the CHS/CLR allosteric mechanism in the context of\nother GPCRs, we compared our findings with other receptors, which bind\nsynthetic allosteric modulators at the same Xe1 site (Figure 4C,D). The\ncompound AS408 is a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of \u03b22AR for both G protein activation and arrestin recruitment72. The allosteric inhibition of \u03b22AR by\nAS408 can be explained by the same mechanism as the CHS inhibition of \u03b21AR, that is, AS408 appears to hinder the sliding of TM5 towards the intracellular side\nand to block the TM3 movement. These are necessary for activation. Although\nthe amino acid sequences of \u03b22AR and \u03b21AR are very similar, including the region of this allosteric binding site, the substitution of a single amino acid at position\n3.48 (valine in \u03b22AR and leucine in \u03b21AR) is sufficient to reduce the affinity of AS408 for \u03b21AR tenfold relative to \u03b22AR72. This substitution may also be the\nreason why \u03b22AR does not bind cholesterol at the same site.\nA further comparison with the receptor GPR40 (free fatty acid receptor 1) is\nparticularly interesting, since the binding of the allosteric compound AP8 to the\n- 12 -\nsame site as occupied by CHS in \u03b21AR induces an upregulation of activity. Thus AP8 is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) enhancing the response of partial agonists73. No active structures of GPR40 are available in complexes with a G\nprotein or G protein mimetic. However, TM5 of the preactive GPR40 in complex\nwith the agonist MK-8666 is shifted towards the intracellular side relative to other active GPCR\u2219G protein complexes (\u03b22AR, A2R)73. Binding of the PAM AP8 to the MK-8666\u00b7GPR40 complex then shifts TM5 towards the extracellular side (Figure\n4C), i.e., towards the conformation of the active \u03b22AR and A2R GPCR complexes. Thus, the shift of TM5 from the preactive to the active GPR40\nconformation is opposite to the usual direction. The alignment of the binary MK-\n8666\u00b7GPR40 and ternary MK-8666\u00b7GPR40\u00b7AP8 complexes (Figure 4C) reveals\nthat AP8 would clash with the preactive conformation of TM5, thereby explaining\nits positive modulation of GPR40 activity, in complete agreement with the\nnegative modulation by CHS and AS408 binding to the same site in \u03b21AR and\n\u03b22AR, respectively.\nA further structure, that is, P2Y1R in complex with the inhibiting antithrombotic drug BPTU (PDB 4XNV),74 also has a CHS molecule bound close to the Xe1 site\nin \u03b21AR albeit in a different orientation (Figure 4D). The effect of CHS/CLR on\nP2Y1R has not been characterized in detail, but P2Y1R-mediated calcium release in platelets was reported as insensitive to CLR depletion75. Intriguingly,\nhowever, the antithrombotic drug BPTU binds to a second allosteric pocket on\nthe external P2Y1R interface with the lipid bilayer (Figure 4D), which coincides\nwith the Xe2 site in \u03b21AR. Thus, apparently, albeit detected in a different receptor,\nthe Xe2 site also constitutes a drug binding pocket."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Here we have determined and rationalized in atomic detail the effect of CHS\nonto the \u03b21AR functional equilibria by a combination of crystallography, solution NMR and ITC experiments. As high pressure shifts the preactive-active\nconformational equilibrium of the isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR complex to the active\nconformation, the receptor must compress empty cavities during activation. We\nhave localized two such cavities using X-ray diffraction of Xe-derivatized \u03b21AR\ncrystals. Two xenon atoms fill these hydrophobic cavities with 15\u201318%\n- 13 -\noccupancy. The volume occupied by these xenon atoms (Xe van der Waals volume 42 \u00c53) is not directly related to the volume of their surrounding\nhydrophobic pocket. Thus, a recent study detected one xenon atom with an occupancy of 17% in a hydrophobic pocket of 141 \u00c53 volume, which is very\nsimilar to our results, but also a second xenon atom with an 68% occupancy in a pocket of only 16-\u00c53 volume5. Therefore, the volume of the hydrophobic pockets\nin \u03b21AR is not well defined by the Xe scattering results, but the range of the hydrophobic volume expected for both Xe sites agrees with the ~100 \u00c53 volume\ndifference between the active and the preactive conformations detected by highpressure NMR8. However, further empty cavities may however also exist in \u03b21AR that escaped detection by xenon due to the low resolution of the crystals or low\noccupancy. The two detected Xe sites overlap with two of the 13 interior voids\nderived from a computational analysis of the static \u03b21AR crystal structure. The noble gases xenon and krypton are known to preferentially bind to desolvated, hydrophobic protein cavities through weak van der Waals interactions5,76.\nHowever, no correlation is observed between the hydrophobicity of residues\nlining the voids computed from the static crystal structure and the detected Xe\nbinding. This lack of correlation may be caused by the relatively low resolution of\nthe crystal structure (2.85 \u00c5), but is also very likely to be due to the highly dynamic\nnature of GPCRs, which may lead to interactions that differ from the expectations\nof a static structure. By contrast, the experimental detection of Xe binding clearly\nindicates a relevant interaction.\nIntriguingly, one of the Xe-detected cavities colocalizes with the CHS binding\nsite. Our NMR results show that CHS binds to a similar region of the detergent-\nsolubilized receptor as in the crystal structures. Moreover, CHS shifts the\npreactive-active equilibrium to the preactive conformation and abrogates the\npressure-induced switch of the isoprenaline\u00b7YY-\u03b21AR complex to the active conformation. This can be rationalized by CHS filling the cavity required for\nactivation. In complete agreement with these structural findings, the affinities of\nboth isoprenaline and Nb80 for \u03b21AR are considerably reduced in the presence\nof CHS, since CHS prevents the active conformation, i.e. the increase of contacts\n- 14 -\nto isoprenaline via the sliding motion of TM510 and the accommodation of Nb80\nby the outward movement of TM5 and TM6.\nAtomic details of the inhibitory effect of CHS can be derived from a careful\ncomparison of the preactive isoprenaline\u00b7\u03b21AR structure with bound CHS and the\nactive isoprenaline\u00b7\u03b21AR\u00b7Nb80 structure, which does not contain detectable CHS. In the binary isoprenaline\u00b7\u03b21AR complex, CHS stabilizes the preactive conformation by numerous hydrophobic interactions. However, CHS would clash\nwith \u03b21AR TM4 and TM5 atoms in the active conformation. By this mechanism, CHS obstructs functional motions required for the activation of the canonical\nGPCR microswitch network.\nAs compared to CHS, even stronger inhibitory effects are expected for CLR\ndue to its larger hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic character of the identified\ncombined Xe- and CHS-binding site. This inhibitory function of CLR is\ncorroborated by the enhanced signaling of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in cardiomyocytes depleted of cellular CLR77. Being highly abundant in the cell membrane (34% of the total lipid content in mammalian plasma membranes35,39),\nCLR may be a prime regulator of adrenergic receptors, keeping their basal\nactivity low by stabilizing their preactive conformation. It is also very likely that\nthe activity of many further GPCR is modulated by CLR. For example, CLR was\nrecently shown to act as a positive allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid\nreceptor CB2, since depletion of CLR from the plasma membrane decreases its activity, both in the presence of agonists and in the apo state78. As CLR levels\nvary among different cell types and subcellular compartments, this may introduce\nan additional layer of cell-specific receptor modulation.\nIn many cases, the binding of CLR/CHS seems rather specific, since these\nlipids are detected at specific localizations in crystal structures and also our\ncurrent data show that CHS binds to the same site in solubilized \u03b21AR as in the crystal. However, the identified CLR/CHS binding sites are rather diverse across\ndifferent GPCRs. Therefore, there cannot be a universal mechanism of allosteric\nGPCR regulation by CLR. Nevertheless, our study reveals two general aspects\nof the CLR action on GPCRs: (i) by filling cavities, CLR reduces the total volume\n- 15 -\navailable for functional motions and (ii) CLR ties together hydrophobic parts of\nthe receptor thereby stabilizing a particular conformation.\nSeveral allosteric modulators of other GPCRs bind to the same site as CHS in\n\u03b21AR. Although their binding site is identical, the functional output may vary. For\nexample, such allosteric modulators increase the activity of GPR40 and DRD173,79, but down-modulate \u03b22AR and C5aR172,80. Blocking TM5 sliding appears as the hallmark of their mechanism of action with the position of the\nblocked TM5 relative to the active conformation defining the direction of\nmodulation.\nThe present study adds to the mounting evidence that empty cavities may fulfill\nkey functions in proteins such as the high-affinity binding of hydrophobic ligand moieties5 or directing functional motions8. Apparently, CHS fills a void that must\nbe compressed for \u03b21AR activation. Filling spaces between the transmembrane helices modulates the dynamics and activity of many GPCRs, as demonstrated by the development of a number of positive and negative allosteric modulators72\u2013 74,79\u201382, which occupy such crevices. In contrast to the orthosteric binding sites,\nthe surfaces of allosteric binding sites are often lined by amino acids that are\ndistinctive between GPCR subtypes. This property gives them a high potential\nfor the development of therapeutic drugs targeting specific GPCR subtypes.\nIntriguingly, not only the detected xenon binding site Xe1 in \u03b21AR colocalizes with the binding site of the allosteric modulator CHS/CLR, but also Xe2\ncolocalizes with the antithrombotic drug BPTU in P2Y1R. Therefore, the\ndetection of empty cavities by xenon may provide valuable clues in the search\nfor new drug target sites in GPCRs."

The addition of CHS improves the quality of the crystals, presumably\ndue to the increase of receptor rigidity and stability. In brief, immediately before\nsetting up the crystallization plates, CHS was added to the isoprenaline\u00b7TS-\u03b21AR complex to a final concentration of 0.45 mg/mL (from a 10 mg/mL stock solution\nin 2% Hega-10). The receptor solution was subsequently centrifuged at 130\u2019000\ng through a 0.22-\u03bcm Ultrafree-MC spin filter (Millipore) for 5 min at 4\u02daC in order\nto remove possible aggregates.

For\nthis reason, we built a pressure cell equipped with a wash bottle for humidity\nequilibration as prechamber and a humidity sensor, in which the humidity can be\nadjusted to arbitrary values using suitable aqueous salt solutions in the wash\nbottle. A relative humidity of 100% produced by pure water proved suitable to\nmaintain TS-\u03b21AR crystals stable for long periods without changes in their appearance. After the xenon incubation, the xenon pressure was released and\nthe crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen within seconds. Derivatization\nconditions were varied between 5\u201330 min incubation and 5\u201312 bar xenon\npressure at 4 \u00b0C. The strongest anomalous signal was obtained for crystals\nincubated for 20 minutes at a xenon pressure of 5 bar. Cryoprotectant soaking\nwith PEG 600 before crystal incubation with xenon did not improve crystal quality.\nData collection and structure determination X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer\nInstitute (Villigen, Switzerland), using the PXIII beamline equipped with a\nPILATUS 2MF detector (Dectris, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland). Isoprenaline\u00b7TS-\n\u03b21AR crystals belonged to the space group P21 with the following unit cell parameters a=59.324 \u00c5, b=125.653 \u00c5, c=87.774 \u00c5 and \u03b2=104.76\u00b0. The crystal\nstructure was solved by molecular replacement using the atomic coordinates of\nthe \u03b21AR from PDB entry 2y03 (chain A) as a template, and searching for two \u03b21AR molecules using the program PHASER86 contained in the CCP4i2 (version 1.0.2) package87. In order to maximize the anomalous contribution of the Xe\natoms, diffraction data were recorded at 6.0 keV on four different crystals under\nvarying chi angles. The individual chi-angle data sets were then processed using the autoPROC pipeline88 and merged for each crystal with XSCALE89.\nIdentification of Xe atoms was performed by computing Fourier maps using\n- 29 -\nSHELXC90 and ANODE91. The two xenon binding sites (Xe1 and Xe2) described\nin the manuscript correspond to the strongest anomalous signals detected in all\nfour crystals and present in both chains (A and B) of the asymmetric unit\n(Supplementary Table S2). Individual Xe occupancies were refined using PHENIX.REFINE92 yielding values of 15 and 18% for Xe1 and Xe2, respectively.\nThe anomalous peak heights of the two additional Xe atoms were too low for\nrefinement. This suggest occupancies of 10% or less for these 2 atoms."
