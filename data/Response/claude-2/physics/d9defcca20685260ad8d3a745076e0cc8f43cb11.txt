 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop new electrochemical strategies for catalyzing reactions with disulfides and diselenides as radical reagents. The paper notes electrochemical methods are a promising approach that needs further exploration.

2. Establish migration cyclization strategies using disulfides and diselenides to construct complex polycyclic compounds. The paper suggests this could be valuable for making medicinal and organic materials. 

3. Design more environmentally friendly photocatalysts to replace metals and peroxides for reactions with disulfides and diselenides. Greener catalytic systems are needed.

4. Expand the scope of disulfide and diselenide radical reactions to additional heterocycles and functional groups. There is further potential to synthesize novel sulfur- and selenium-containing compounds. 

5. Optimize reaction conditions like solvent, temperature, light source etc. to improve yields, speed, and selectivity of disulfide and diselenide radical reactions. Fine-tuning could enhance the utility of these methods.
