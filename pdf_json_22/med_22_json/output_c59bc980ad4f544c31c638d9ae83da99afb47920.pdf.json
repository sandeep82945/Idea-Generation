    "abstractText": "Social media has the potential to elucidate a deeper level of understanding of COVID-19\u2019s impacts across wide ranging communities. Recent work leveraged publicly available data from social media platforms to detect emerging symptoms from COVID-19 (Santosh et al., 2020) as well as the pandemic\u2019s impacts on mental health (Biester et al., 2020; Tabak and Purver, 2020; Thukral et al., 2020; Wolohan, 2020). With tightened restrictions in hospital settings, COVID-19 has greatly impacted expecting parents, newborns, and their families (Findeklee and Morinello, 2020; DeYoung and Mangum, 2021; Gutschow and Davis-Floyd, 2021; Altman et al., 2021; Vazquez-Vazquez et al., 2021; Mari\u00f1o-Narvaez et al., 2021). However, no existing work has used natural language processing techniques to analyze impacts of COVID-19 from long-form text written by new parents explicitly describing their birthing experiences. We investigate whether, and if so how, birthing narratives written by new parents on Reddit changed during COVID-19. Our results indicate that the presence of family members significantly decreased and themes related to induced labor significantly increased in the narratives during COVID-19. Our work builds upon recent research that analyze how new parents use Reddit to describe their birthing experiences (Pilkington and Rominov, 2017; Antoniak et al., 2019; Pilkington and Bedford-Dyer, 2021).",

To discover distinct topics across our collection of birthing narratives, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), as implemented in Mallet (McCallum, 2002). In initial experiments, k, the number of topics, ranges from 5 to 50. We choose k = 50 based on Cv coherence (Ro\u0308der et al., 2015). Discovered topics include induced labor, family, breastfeeding, and the first moments between a new parent and child. To determine whether the prevalence of these topics changed during COVID-19, we fit topic-specific Prophet models, an additive regression approach for forecasting time series data (Taylor and Letham, 2018), on the topic\u2019s average monthly prevalence in our corpus prior to March 2020. We then compare the topic\u2019s actual average monthly prevalence in our corpus during COVID-19 with the corresponding model\u2019s forecast. Following Biester et al. (2020), we quantify how often the actual topic\u2019s\n1These nine subreddits are: r/BabyBumps, r/beyondthebump, r/BirthStories, r/daddit, r/predaddit, r/pregnant, r/Mommit, r/NewParents, and r/InfertilityBabies.\n2We noticed that in recent years, new parents post a picture of the baby and then describe the birthing narrative in the first comment. We include these examples in our filtering process.\n3We demarcate March 11th, 2020 as the start of COVID-19, the day the WHO declared a global pandemic.\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n11 74\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n5 A\npr 2\n02 2\nmonthly probabilities fall outside the model\u2019s 95% CI and use one-tailed Z-tests to determine statistical significance.\nQuantifying Personas Presence. Determining the prevalence of types of characters, or personas, in a narrative can illuminate information from an author\u2019s perspective, e.g. who is most the relevant, valued, or supportive character. Following Antoniak et al. (2019), we quantify a persona\u2019s prevalence by counting how often they are mentioned, using a dictionary of terms for each persona.4 We examine the difference in average mentions of each persona before and during COVID-19.5"

            "text": "Figure 1 shows how the forecasted prevalence\u2019s for the family and induction topics significantly differ with the topics\u2019 prevalence during COVID-19. The increase in the induction topic (Figure 1b) may reflect the increased recommendation of planned induction, enabling COVID-19 testing of expecting parents in advance of delivery (Goer, 2020). The decrease in the family topic (Figure 1a) might correlate with hospitals restricting visitors during the pandemic.\nOur experiments quantifying the personas\u2019 presence demonstrate that the healthcare providers were mentioned at similar rates before and during COVID-19, indicating that from the perspective of birthing parents, providers\u2019 roles in birthing narratives remained consistent. We notice a significant drop in the family persona\u2019s presence (22.8% , p < 1\u22127) and significant increase in the partner persona\u2019s presence (5%, p < 0.028) during the pandemic. Figure 2 indicates that these differences were usually most apparent from periods 2 to 8 in the stories, which correlates with the time generally spent in the hospital during birthing narratives (Antoniak et al., 2019). This might suggest that partners supplemented the support missing by families that were unable to visit hospitals before and after delivery."
