    "abstractText": "We study the production of dark matter and dark radiation after reheating in string inflation models where the Calabi-Yau has a fibred structure and the visible sector lives on D3 branes. We show how the interplay between different physical constraints from inflation, reheating, supersymmetry breaking and dark radiation, leads to distinct predictions for the nature of dark matter. In particular, in Fibre Inflation dark matter can only be primordial black holes or an open string QCD axion with an intermediate scale decay constant since WIMPs are always too heavy and ultralight closed string axions cannot behave as fuzzy dark matter due to strong isocurvature bounds. On the other hand, K\u00e4hler moduli inflation can allow for non-thermal WIMP dark matter at the TeV-scale.",

            "text": "Recent advances in string phenomenology in type IIB compactifications have progressed in two complementary directions:\n(i) Constructing specific compactifications that are phenomenologically promising: typically, these constructions incorporate moduli stabilization, have chiral matter, are broadly able to accommodate the gauge groups and matter content of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [1\u20136], and have at least a somewhat welldefined inflationary and reheating sector [7\u20139];\n(ii) Proceeding along statistical lines, by drawing statistical conclusions about the distribution of important phenomenological quantities like the scale of supersymmetry breaking and the axion decay constant, from the ensemble of type IIB flux vacua [10\u2013 17].\nAmongst various classes of models in the first direction, type IIB Large Volume flux compactifications are particularly well-developed. Two main inflationary scenarios emerge in this context: K\u00e4hler moduli inflation (KMI) [18, 19] and Fibre Inflation (FI) [20\u2013 22]. KMI is a small-field model where inflation is driven by a blow-up mode with a non-perturbative scalar potential. The Hubble scale during inflation is relatively low,\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nHI \u223c 5\u00d7 108 GeV, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is unobservable r ' 10\u221210. On the other hand, FI is a large field model characterized by HI ' 5 \u00d7 1013 GeV and r ' 0.007 [23], where the inflaton is a fibration bulk modulus with a perturbative scalar potential. In these constructions the visible sector can live on either D7-branes wrapping 4-cycles in the geometric regime, or D3-branes at singularities. In the first case, the soft terms are around the gravitino mass, M1/2 \u223c m0 \u223c m3/2, while in the second case the visible sector can be sequestered from the sources of supersymmetry breaking in the bulk, resulting in soft terms which can be hierarchically smaller than the gravitino mass [24, 25]. Two limits can arise: a so-called local limit with a split-SUSY spectrum featuringM1/2 m0 m3/2, and an ultralocal limit with a more standard MSSM-like spectrum withM1/2 \u223c m0 m3/2. Reheating via the decay of the modulus with the smallest decay width has already been studied in both KMI and FI for several D-brane configurations which can realize an MSSM-like sector together with additional hidden sectors. In particular, reheating for KMI in the simplest Swiss-cheese LVS models has been studied in [26\u201328] for D3-branes in the ultralocal limit, in [29] for D3-branes in the local limit, and in [30, 31] for D7-branes. On the other hand, reheating for FI with the MSSM on D3-branes has been studied in [32], and in [33] for the D7-brane case. Each of these references analyzed in detail the constraints arising from the requirement to avoid an excessive production of ultra-light bulk axions that behave as dark radiation. Moreover [34\u201337] studied the implications for non-thermal neutralino dark matter for KMI with the MSSM on D3-branes in the ultralocal limit. The constraints on the nature of dark matter for KMI with the visible sector on D7-branes has instead been analyzed in [38] for superheavy WIMPs and in [39] for the QCD axion realized as a closed string mode. The largest production of dark radiation from the decay of the lightest modulus has been found in [32] for FI with the MSSM on D3-branes. This result relies on a particular expression of the moduli-dependence of the Giudice-Masiero contribution to the K\u00e4hler potential which determines an effective decoupling of the lightest modulus from the Higgs degrees of freedom. In this paper we will revisit this result by considering a more general moduli-dependence of the Giudice-Masiero term that allows to considerably reduce the production of dark radiation. In doing so, we shall follow the results of [40] which constrained the form of the K\u00e4hler potential by analogy with explicit toroidal computations. We will then study the associated production of dark matter after reheating in FI. We will find that WIMPs are always overproduced, requiring a mechanism of R-parity breaking to make them unstable. In this case, a very promising dark matter candidate is instead the QCD axion realized as the phase of a charged open string field. The axion decay constant is around fQCD ' 5 \u00d7 1010 GeV, which can avoid isocurvature bounds and lead to dark matter in a rather natural way. We will extend our analysis also to fibred Calabi-Yau compactifications with KMI and the MSSM on D3-branes. The best case scenario to avoid dark radiation overproduction with the minimal tuning of the coefficient of the GiudiceMasiero interaction among the moduli and the Higges, is the ultralocal limit. In this case, we will find that dark matter can be TeV-scale non-thermal neutralinos which are produced from the inflaton decay and then undergo annihilation.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nOur analysis shows how UV correlations among different observables in string compactifications, like inflation, supersymmetry breaking and reheating, is very powerful to obtain clear predictions for the nature of dark matter. Moreover, we will see that avoiding dark radiation overproduction severely constrains the moduli-dependence of the K\u00e4hler metric for matter fields. We will also point out that, contrary to what was claimed in previous studies [27], the moduli decay to open string axions can compete with the decay to bulk axions, and so lead to an additional source of dark radiation. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 and section 3, we provide a brief review of non-thermal dark matter and fibred LVS models, respectively. In section 4, we first derive the moduli couplings to closed and open string axions, as well as with other visible sector fields. We then derive the associated predictions for dark radiation and the reheat temperature. In sections 5.1 and 5.2, we study non-thermal dark matter candidates in KMI and FI, respectively, before presenting our conclusions in section 6."

            "text": "Before focusing on string models, we first briefly review non-thermal dark matter (DM) produced by heavy scalar decay [41, 42]. The lightest modulus, \u03c6, dominates the energy density of the universe from the onset of its oscillations until its decay. The decay then produces a significant amount of entropy, diluting any previously existing DM particles to a negligible abundance. Depending on the reheat temperature of \u03c6, Trh, the DM particles produced by \u03c6 decay may fall into a few different scenarios depending on the DM freeze-out temperature Tf ' mDM/20 [34].\nTrh & Tf. In this case, the DM may equilibrate. Due to the DM-DM annihilations, the DM abundance is simply given by that of the thermal scenario.\nTrh . Tf. Here, we have two sub-cases depending on the efficiency of the DM annihilations. More precisely, defining the critical abundance of the DM, Y cDM, as the attractor of the relevant Boltzmann equation, we have\nY cDM ' H\n\u3008\u03c3annv\u3009s \u2223\u2223\u2223 Trh . (2.1)\nIf the produced DM abundance is larger than the critical abundance, i.e. YDM > Y cDM, some annihilations still occur until the abundance reaches Y cDM, at which point the DM becomes too dilute to annihilate efficiently. We refer to this case as the annihilation scenario. In the annihilation scenario, the final DM abundance can be estimated by\nY cDM ' ( nDM s ) obs \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009f ( Tf Trh ) (2.2)\nwhere \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf ' 3\u00d7 10\u221226 cm3s\u22121 is the value needed in the thermal case [43] to match the observed DM abundance(\nnDM s ) obs ' 5\u00d7 10\u221210 (1 GeV mDM ) . (2.3)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nThe DM abundance in the annihilation scenario is thus enhanced by Tf/Trh in comparison to the thermal case, and can accommodate thermally underproduced DM candidates, such as wino-like and higgsino-like DM. Since Trh . Tf \u223c mDM/20, we must have \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf < \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009f to reproduce the observed DM abundance. If the produced DM abundance is lower than the critical abundance, i.e. YDM < Y cDM, then annihilations cannot occur significantly. We refer to this case as the branching scenario. The late-time DM abundance is given simply by the fraction of the light modulus abundance, Y\u03c6, that decays to DM\nYDM = Y\u03c6 BrDM. (2.4)\nIf the branching ratio to DM is sufficiently low, the branching scenario can accommodate thermally overproduced DM, such as bino-like DM."

To settle notation for the rest of the paper, we briefly review this class of compactifications. The first K\u00e4hler modulus we consider is T1 = \u03c41 + ic1. The scalar \u03c41 parametrizes the dimensionless volume in string units of a K3 or T 4 fibre over a P1 base. The axionic component c1 arises from the reduction of the 10D RR form C4 on the K3 or T 4 divisor. The scalar component of the second modulus T2 = \u03c42 + ic2 controls the volume of the base of the fibration, while c2 is the associated axion. The scalar component of the third modulus T3 = \u03c43 + ic3 parametrizes the size of a blow-up mode required to stabilize the volume at leading order, and c3 is an additional closed string axion. The volume takes the form (for explicit Calabi-Yau models with this volume form see [7, 9, 44])\nV = \u221a\u03c41\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c43/23 . (3.1)\nThe K\u00e4hler potential and the superpotential read\nK = Ktree +K\u03b1\u2032 +Kgs W = W0 +A1e\u2212a1T1 +A2e\u2212a2T2 +A3e\u2212a3T3 , (3.2)\nwhere K has been expressed as a perturbative expansion including \u03b1\u2032 and gs corrections to the tree-level result. The tree-level K\u00e4hler potential is Ktree = \u22122 lnV (setting mP = 1) and it enjoys a well-known no-scale property which makes all K\u00e4hler moduli flat at semiclassical level. At this order of approximation, background 3-form fluxes freeze the complex structure moduli and the dilaton whose VEV sets the string coupling gs which we assume to be in the weak coupling regime, i.e. gs . O(0.1), to trust perturbation theory. The leading order \u03b1\u20323 correction is given by K\u03b1\u2032 = \u2212 \u03be\ng 3/2 s V , where \u03be is the Calabi-Yau Euler number, \u03be \u223c O(1), while for string loop corrections to K, given by Kgs , we refer to [33, 45, 46]. The superpotential contains instead the tree-level flux-generated contribution W0\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\n(which is a tunable constant after complex structure and dilaton stabilization), and nonperturbative corrections for each of the three K\u00e4hler moduli, where the Ai\u2019s are expected to be O(1) constants while ai = 2\u03c0/Ni with Ni \u2208 N. In the large volume limit where the effective field theory is under control, \u03c42 & \u03c41 \u03c43 > 1, the leading order contribution to the potential for the K\u00e4hler moduli arises from K\u03b1\u2032 and the T3-dependent non-perturbative correction to W . This potential fixes \u03c43, c3 and the overall volume V at\n\u3008\u03c43\u3009 ' g\u22121s \u3008V\u3009 'W0 ea3/gs \u3008c3\u3009 = \u03c0/a3. (3.3)\nThe minimum is AdS and breaks supersymmetry spontaneously. There are several known mechanism to uplift it to Minkowski, among which anti-D3 branes [47], T-branes [48], or non-zero F-terms of the complex structure moduli [49]. At subleading order, Kgs (or higher order \u03b1\u2032 corrections [22, 50]), fix the direction orthogonal to the volume mode u \u2261 \u03c41/\u03c42 at [33]\n\u3008u\u3009 = \u03bb g2s , (3.4)\nwhere \u03bb depends on the tunable coefficients of string loop corrections to K. Finally, tiny T1- and T2-dependent non-perturbative effects fix the two ultra-light axions c1 and c2 at \u3008ci\u3009 = \u03c0/ai \u2200i = 1, 2.\nThe gravitino mass takes the form (restoring appropriate powers of mP )\nm23/2 ' \u03ba 2m2P (3.5)\nwhere [51] \u2261W0/V 1 and \u03ba \u2261 gs/(8\u03c0) 1 (3.6)\nand the moduli mass spectrum is given by [26, 30, 52]\nm2\u03c43 ' m 2 c3 ' (ln ) 2m23/2 > m 2 3/2 m2V ' (\ng 3/2 s W0| (ln )3 |\n) m2\u03c43 m 2 \u03c43\nm2u ' ( 1/3g 5/6 s | ln |\nW 1/3 0 \u221a \u03bb\n) m2V < m 2 V\nm2ci ' \u03c43i W0 e\u2212ai\u03c4im23/2 m 2 u \u2200i = 1, 2 (3.7)\nThe visible sector lives on D3-branes at singularities which can give rise to a scenario of sequestered SUSY breaking [24]. The common gaugino masses,M1/2, can then be estimated using the results of [25]\nM1/2 ' 3\u03c9 2 m3/2 V \u03c4 3/2 3 \u223c O ( m3/2 V (lnV)3/2 )\n(3.8)\nwhere \u03c9 is a tunable flux-dependent parameter.

On the other hand, the value of the common slepton and squark mass, denoted as m0, depends on the exact moduli-dependence of the K\u00e4hler metric for matter fields. The socalled \u201clocal limit\u201d is defined as the case where the physical Yukawas are independent of the volume only to leading order in V\u22121, while the \u201cultralocal limit\u201d is defined to be the case where the physical Yukawas are independent of the volume to any order in V\u22121 [25]. Consequently, the local limit leads to a split SUSY scenario, whereas the ultralocal case can give a standard MSSM-like spectrum\nlocal limit : m0 'M1/2 \u221a V M1/2\nultralocal limit : m0 'M1/2.

This K\u00e4hler modulus can decay to visible sector fields on D3-branes at singularities, but also to the two ultra-light closed string axions c1 and c2 which behave as dark radiation.\nThe decay to SUSY scalars is kinematically forbidden in the local limit, whereas it is mass-suppressed in the ultralocal limit. Similarly, the decay to SM fermions, Higgsinos and gauginos is chirality suppressed. Moreover, the decay to SM gauge bosons is loop suppressed since the gauge kinetic function for D3-branes is controlled by the dilaton. The only relevant decay rates are therefore to Higgses via a Giudice-Masiero interaction term in K, and to the closed string axions c1 and c2. We will also argue that, if the QCD axion is realized as the phase of a charged open string field, the lightest modulus decay into this mode should also be taken into account since it is not mass-suppressed.\nAssembling all the results, we then provide constraints on the parameter space coming from observed upper bounds on the effective number of neutrino species Neff ."

            "text": "Open string axions, which arise as the phase of charged matter fields acquiring a nonzero VEV, are more model-dependent than the closed string bulk axions we considered above. In [27], the modulus decay to open string axions was considered and claimed to\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nbe negligible. Here, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case - both within our fibred LVS scenario and the minimal LVS scenario considered in [27]. We begin by considering open string axions within the context of minimal LVS with only one bulk K\u00e4hler modulus corresponding to the volume mode. For matter fields, collectively denoted as C, the relevant term in the K\u00e4hler potential is\nK m2P \u2283 CC Tb + T b\n(4.17)\nwhere Tb is the bulk modulus, corresponding to the choice n1 = 3, n2 = 0 in eq. (4.2). We can then write down the Lagrangian for the canonical moduli after using eq. (4.5)\nL \u2283 mP 2 \u221a 6 \u03c6V ( C C + C C ) . (4.18)\nThe matter field can then be parameterized by C = \u03c1 exp(i \u03b8), where \u03c1 is the radial component which acquires a VEV \u3008\u03c1\u3009 6= 0 via D-term stabilization, while \u03b8 is the phase field taking the role of the axion. Once \u03c1 takes on its VEV, and after going to canonically normalized fields \u03c1\u0303 and \u03b8\u0303, defined as \u03c1 = \u221a \u3008\u03c4b\u3009\u03c1\u0303/mP and \u03b8\u0303 = \u3008\u03c1\u0303\u3009\u03b8, eq. (4.18) gives\nL \u2283 \u2212 1\u221a 6 \u03c6V mP \u2202\u00b5\u03b8\u0303 \u2202 \u00b5\u03b8\u0303. (4.19)\nNotice that the axion decay constant f\u03b8 is set by \u3008\u03c1\u0303\u3009, i.e. f\u03b8 = \u3008\u03c1\u0303\u3009. To put eq. (4.19) in a more illuminating form, we can integrate by parts which gives us\nL \u2283 1 2 \u221a 6mP\n[ 2\u03c6V \u03b8\u0303 \u03b8\u0303 \u2212 \u03b8\u03032 \u03c6V ] . (4.20)\nThe first term leads to a decay width which is mass suppressed, that was considered in [27]. However, the second term leads to a decay width controlled by the mass of the decaying modulus. Thus, the decay width into open string axions in minimal LVS is given by\n\u0393 ( \u03c6V \u2192 \u03b8\u0303\u03b8\u0303 ) = 116\n( 1\n48\u03c0 m3V m2P\n) . (4.21)\nWhile this is not as significant as moduli decays to closed string axions for the production of dark radiation, it slightly increases the tension for minimal LVS models which consider open string axions as the QCD axion. Notice moreover that the modulus decay width into the radial part is instead mass suppressed since it arises from an interaction term of the form\nL \u2283 1\u221a 6 \u03c6V mP \u03c1\u0303 \u03c1\u0303. (4.22)\nThe decay to a bulk axion and an open string axion is also possible. This interaction comes also from expanding eq. (4.17), leading to a Lagrangian of the form\nL \u2283 i3 \u03c6V m2P\n( C \u2202\u00b5C \u2202 \u00b5ab \u2212 C \u2202\u00b5C \u2202\u00b5ab ) . (4.23)\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nWhen \u03c1\u0303 takes on its VEV, this becomes\nL \u2283 23 ( \u3008\u03c1\u0303\u3009 mP ) \u03c6V mP \u2202\u00b5\u03b8\u0303 \u2202 \u00b5ab (4.24)\nand although this term leads to a decay width proportional to \u03930, it is also suppressed by \u3008\u03c1\u0303\u3009/mP 1. Thus, we find the contributions from the \u03c6V \u2192 \u03b8\u0303ab decay to be negligible. We now consider open string axions within fibred LVS. In this scenario, we consider a general K\u00e4hler potential for matter fields of the form\nK m2P \u2283 CC( T1 + T 1 )x1 ( T2 + T 2 )x2 (4.25)\nwhere x1 and x2 are constants which fix the moduli dependence of the matter K\u00e4hler metric. These constants are not entirely arbitrary, but rather primarily fixed by the brane configuration. Given that fibred Calabi-Yau threefolds have a volume (V = \u221a\u03c41\u03c42) which scales as the one of toroidal cases (V = \u221a\u03c41\u03c42\u03c43) in the \u03c43 \u2192 \u03c42 limit, we follow [40] and constrain x1 and x2 by exploiting explicit results in toroidal orientifolds where the K\u00e4hler metric for matter on D3-branes is proportional to \u03c4\u22121i \u2200i = 1, 2, 3. Hence for fibred Calabi-Yaus with matter on D3-branes, this implies two cases:\n\u2022 x1 = 1 and x2 = 0\n\u2022 x1 = 0 and x2 = 1 .\nNotice that both of them reproduce the scaling of eq. (4.17). Keeping for now the general form, we can utilize the field redefinitions from eq. (4.5) and have the following K\u00e4hler potential\nK m2P \u2283 12CC\n( 1\u2212 x1 \u221a 2 n1 \u03c61 mP \u2212 x2 \u221a 2 n2 \u03c62 mP ) (4.26)\nafter expanding the exponentials. The relevant interaction terms in the Lagrangian in terms of the moduli mass eigenbasis turn out to be\nL \u2283 mP 2 \u221a 6\n( C C + C C ) \u03c6V (4.27)\n+ mP 2 \u221a 6\n( x2 \u221a n1 n2 \u2212 x1 \u221a n2 n1 )( C C + C C ) \u03c6u\nwhere we have explicitly used the constraints n1 +n2 = 3 and x1 +x2 = 1. Focusing on the transverse mode, \u03c6u, we can write down the interaction with the open string axion once the radial component acquires a VEV\nL \u2283 1 2 \u221a 6mP\n( x2 \u221a n1 n2 \u2212 x1 \u221a n2 n1 ) [ 2\u03c6u \u03b8\u0303 \u03b8\u0303 \u2212 \u03b8\u03032 \u03c6u ] .\nOnce again, the normalization of the kinetic terms gives \u3008\u03c1\u0303\u3009 = f\u03b8. Specializing to n1 = 1 and n2 = 2, which reproduces the volume form (3.1), the decay to open string axions is\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\ngiven by\n\u0393 ( \u03c6u \u2192 \u03b8\u0303\u03b8\u0303 ) = \u03930/8 for x1 = 1 and x2 = 0\u03930/32 for x1 = 0 and x2 = 1 . (4.28) Thus, we see an enhancement compared to the minimal LVS case if the K\u00e4hler metric depends on \u03c41, and a reduction if the K\u00e4hler metric depends on \u03c42. In this work, we focus on the case where x1 = 0 and x2 = 1, so that additional contributions to dark radiation are minimized."

(4.34)\nFocusing on the transverse mode, \u03c6u, we note that the final term will be dominant - the others will be suppressed by a factor of m2H/m2u. The dominant term is therefore proportional to the coefficient \u03b3 which for n1 = 1 and n2 = 2, reproducing eq. (3.1), reduces to\n\u03b3 = 1\u221a 2 (k2 \u2212 2k1) . (4.35)\nIt is worth stressing that this coefficient vanishes only for k2 = 2k1 which is however never the case for our options since it would be inconsistent with the results of [40]. The fact that \u03b3 6= 0 is crucial to avoid dark radiation overproduction, contrary to the results of [32] which considered k1 = 1/3 and k2 = 2/3. The intuitive reason why k2 = 2k1 would imply no interaction between \u03c6u and the Higgses (at least at leading order) is that \u03c6u is orthogonal to the volume mode and in this case the K\u00e4hler moduli dependence of the Giudice-Masiero term in eq. (4.29) would scale exactly as an inverse power of the overall volume since \u03c4\u2212k11 \u03c4 \u2212k2 2 = V\u22122k1 for k2 = 2k1. Let us close this section by commenting briefly on a recent result. In [39], it was argued that there should be an additional coupling between the Higgs sector and the moduli. This coupling is induced through loop corrections to the Higgs mass term due to the volume dependence of the running from some high scale (e.g. the Kaluza-Klein scale) down to the SUSY breaking scale, and is of the form\nL \u2283 cloop ( mu mV )2 m20 mP \u03c6uh 2 (4.36)\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nwhere h is the SM Higgs field, cloop \u223c 1/(16\u03c02) is a typical loop coefficient and the (mu/mV)2 \u223c V\u22121/3 factor is due to the mixing between \u03c6V and \u03c6u induced by string loop corrections to K [54]. Thus, we would expect the decay width to be proportional to\n\u0393 \u223c c2loop ( m0 mV )4 m3u m2P . (4.37)\nIn the case of D3-branes at singularities, we have seen that scalar masses scale as m0 \u223c M1/2 \u223c mV/ \u221a V in the ultralocal limit, and so we can safely neglect this induced coupling. On the other hand, in the local limit m0 'M1/2 \u221a V ' mV , and so a more careful study is needed. The exact ratio between SUSY scalar masses and the mass of the volume mode has been derived in [29] and takes the form(\nm0 mV\n)4 ' (lnV)2 . (4.38)\nAt first sight this factor might look large but it has to be multiplied by c2loop \u223c 1/(16\u03c02)2 in the prefactor in eq. (4.37). For the values of the volume which we will consider in this paper, V . O(107) (that also keep soft terms above the TeV-scale), one has c2loop (m0/mV)\n4 . O(0.01), showing that this decay channel can be neglected also in the local limit."

(4.40)\nThe decay width into Higgses however depends on the SUSY breaking scale, and so we study the ultralocal and local limits separately.\nUltralocal limit. In the ultralocal limit, as can be seen from eq. (3.9), the soft scalar masses scale as m0 ' M1/2 \u223c mP /V2. This mass scale is lower than the mass of \u03c6u since m0/mu ' V\u22121/3 1, implying that all MSSM Higgs degrees of freedom are accessible in the decay of \u03c6u. Thus, taking the dominant decay term of eq. (4.33), we can approximate the decay width into the Higgs sector as\n\u0393(\u03c6u \u2192 HuHd) = 2\u03b32Z2 48\u03c0 m3u m2P \u2261 cvis \u03930 (4.41)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nFigure 1. The upper plot shows allowed \u2206Neff for the case k1 = k2 = 1/2 in the ultralocal limit. The lower plot shows the corresponding reheat temperature in GeV for the benchmark mass in table 1.\nwhere we defined cvis \u2261 2Z2\u03b32 (4.42)\nas the approximate coefficient of visible sector decays. Thus the branching fraction into hidden sector degrees of freedom takes the form\nfhid ' [ 1 + 2Z2 (k2n1 \u2212 k1n2) 2\nn21 + n22\n]\u22121 . (4.43)\nIn the upper plots of figure 1 and figure 2, we display the produced dark radiation in the (n1, Z) plane for the three different choices of k1 and k2 (where we also take n2 = 3\u2212 n1). Blank regions are in excess of the current 2\u03c3 bound from Planck 2018 data [55]. For n1 = 1, the best case scenario turns out to be k1 = 1 and k2 = 0 which requires Z & 2.5 (while k1 = 0 and k2 = 1 would require Z & 5, and k1 = k2 = 1/2 Z & 10). Again this result can be understood intuitively by recalling that \u03c6u is the mode orthogonal to the volume, corresponding to the ratio of K\u00e4hler moduli u = \u03c41/\u03c42, and rewriting the moduli dependence of the Giudice-Masiero term in eq. (4.29) as a function of V and u. It is then easy to check that the combination of k1 and k2 which gives the largest power of u (u2/3), and so the strongest coupling of \u03c6u to Higgses, is k1 = 1 and k2 = 0.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nFigure 2. The upper plot shows allowed \u2206Neff for the case k1 = 1 and k2 = 0 in the ultralocal limit. The lower plot again shows the corresponding reheat temperature in GeV for the benchmark mass in table 1. This plot also describes the case k1 = 0 and k2 = 1 under the interchange n1 \u2194 n2.\nThe associated reheating temperature becomes Trh ' (40cvis(cvis + chid)\n\u03c02g\u2217(Trh)\n)1/4\u221a \u03930mP\n= (\n80Z2 \u03c02g\u2217(Trh) )1/4 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223k2n2 \u2212 k1n1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231/2\u221a\u03930mP [2Z2(k2n1 \u2212 k1n2)2 + n21 + n22]1/4 . (4.44)\nAs a benchmark example, we take g\u2217(Trh) ' 86.25 and a typical value of the mass of \u03c6u for K\u00e4hler inflation models [18] which we will study in section 5.1 obtainingmu ' 2.5\u00d7107 GeV, as can be seen from table 1. The corresponding reheat temperature Trh in GeV is shown in the lower plots of figure 1 and figure 2 in the (n1, Z) plane. Blank regions again correspond to values which produce dark radiation above the current bounds. As fhid is independent of mu while Trh depends on mu only through \u03930, we expect these plots to qualitatively describe a wide range of moduli masses.\nLocal limit. In the local limit, as can be seen from eq. (3.9), soft scalar masses scale as m0 ' M1/2 \u221a V \u223c mP /V3/2. Contrary to the ultralocal limit, in this case m0 is above the mass of \u03c6u since m0/mu ' V1/6 > 1, implying that some of the Higgs degrees of freedom are kinematically inaccessible for the light modulus \u03c6u. We must therefore consider only the decays into the light degrees of freedom, involving the SM Higgs and the three would-be\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nGoldstone bosons. Following [56], we find the final term of eq. (4.33) becomes\nL ' \u2212 \u03b3Z 2 \u221a 6mP ( |G+|2 \u2212 (h0)2 + (G0)2) \u03c6u (4.45)\nwhere G0 and G+ are the Goldstone bosons. The total decay width into light Higgs degrees of freedom is then given by\n\u0393(\u03c6u \u2192 HuHd) = 1 48\u03c0 5Z2\u03b32 32 m3u m2P \u2261 cvis\u03930 (4.46)\nwhere we defined cvis \u2261\n5Z2\u03b32 32 . (4.47)\nWe see that the reheat temperature and the branching fraction into hidden sector degrees of freedom can then be obtained from the ultralocal limit expressions, with the replacement 2Z2 \u2192 5Z2/32. The minimum value of Z allowed by dark radiation constraints thus increases by a factor of about 3.6 in comparison to the ultralocal limit. With this scaling of Z, figure 1 and figure 2 describe also the local limit. Hence in the local limit the best case scenario, corresponding to k1 = 1 and k2 = 0, requires Z & 9. In terms of tuning needed to avoid dark radiation overproduction, the ultralocal limit seems therefore to be favored. It is important to stress that the requirement to satisfy current observational bounds on \u2206Neff without relying on unnaturally large values of Z, constrains the form of the K\u00e4hler metric for matter fields both at leading order, selecting k1 = 1 and k2 = 0, and at subleading order by focusing on the ultralocal limit which needs a cancellation of the V-dependence of the physical Yukawas at all orders."

In a given string inflation model, V is in general fixed by matching the observed amplitude of density perturbations As.

This is a small-field inflationary model since it predicts a very small tensor-toscalar ratio at CMB horizon scales, r ' 10\u221210. The observed amplitude of CMB scalar fluctuations fixes V \u223c 107 corresponding to a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation, HI ' mV \u223c 5\u00d7108 GeV. Interestingly, in sequestered D3-brane models, this value of V can also correlate with TeV-scale soft terms for a mild tuning of background fluxes. In table 1 we show a benchmark example motivated by the results of [38]. Note that no moduli suffer from the cosmological moduli problem which requires mmoduli & 7.4\u00d7 104 GeV. During inflation, the bulk moduli V and u are displaced from their minima due to inflationary dynamics [57] and are approximately frozen due to Hubble friction. At the end of inflation, as shown in [58], strong preheating effects lead to a violent production of inflaton quanta which eventually decay to either hidden sector gauge bosons on D7-branes wrapping the inflaton 4-cycle [38] or to lighter moduli and axions [39]. Later on, the bulk moduli \u03c6V and \u03c6u come to dominate the energy density of the universe, and their decay dilutes any previous relic. On the other hand, as can be seen from (3.7), the two bulk axions, a1 and a2, are in practice massless for V ' 107, and so cannot behave as fuzzy dark matter. They can however be dark radiation produced from the decay of the lightest modulus \u03c6u which determines the final reheating. The decay width into bulk axions has been derived in eq. (4.14) and for n1 and n2 reduces to\n\u0393(\u03c6u \u2192 aa) = 5 2 \u03930. (5.1)\nUsing the results of section 4.5, we focus on the best case scenario where k1 = 1 and k2 = 0, so that the coupling of \u03c6u to Higgses is maximized to avoid dark radiation overproduction. We now analyse the ultralocal and local limits separately.\nUltralocal limit. The decay width for \u03c6u into Higgses in the ultralocal limit is given by eq. (4.41) which for k1 = 1 and k2 = 0 becomes\n\u0393(\u03c6u \u2192 HuHd) = 4Z2 \u03930 . (5.2)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nThe relative fraction to hidden sector radiation is then given by\nfhid ' ( 1 + 85Z 2 )\u22121\n(5.3)\nwhile the reheat temperature is\nTrh = 2 \u221a 5\nZ2 [ 1 + 85Z2 ] \u03c02g\u2217(Trh) 1/4\u221a\u03930mP . (5.4) Taking g\u2217(Trh) ' 86.25 and Z = 3 (which brings \u2206Neff within current observational bounds), this gives\nTrh = 18.7 GeV\u00d7 (\nmu 2.5\u00d7 107GeV\n)3/2 . (5.5)\nBranching scenario. Assuming the branching scenario occurs if Trh . 70 MeV [34, 35], we see from eq. (5.5) that it would require mu . 6.0\u00d7 105 GeV, corresponding to a volume of order V & 5\u00d7 108 (keeping the other benchmark values of table 1 fixed) that in K\u00e4hler moduli inflation would yield an amplitude of scalar fluctuations below the observed value. Hence the branching scenario is not viable. However, if instead one were to extend the inflationary model to include additional fields responsible to generate the observed value of As in a way compatible with V & 5\u00d7108, the branching scenario might be potentially viable. Here, we assume this to be the case and provide a brief analysis of the branching scenario.\nThe required modulus abundance for Trh . 70 MeV and V & 5\u00d7108 can be estimated as\nY\u03c6u \u2261 3Trh 4mu . 8.7\u00d7 10\u22128 . (5.6)\nSetting the DM abundance equal to the observed value, i.e. taking YDM = 5 \u00d7 10\u221210(1 GeV/mDM), and recalling eq. (2.4) for the prediction of the final DM abundance in the branching scenario, we note that smaller values of mDM require larger values of mu to match the observed DM abundance for a given branching ratio. However, as mDM decreases, the freeze-out temperature Tf decreases, while increasing mu increases the reheat temperature Trh. It is then imperative to check that Trh . Tf, as required to have a non-thermal abundance. In figure 3, we plot contours of the DM branching ratio which reproduce the measured abundance for given modulus and DM masses. The lower bound on mu is set by BBN constraints (Trh & 3 MeV), while the upper bound on mu is set by distinguishing the thermal and non-thermal cases. We adopt BrDM & 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 as a lower bound on the branching ratio to dark matter. Thus we see that the branching scenario in K\u00e4hler moduli inflation with a non-standard mechanism for the generation of the density perturbations is only potentially viable for DM masses between 100 MeV . mDM . 3.3 GeV and 80 TeV . mu . 550 TeV.\nAnnihilation scenario. In the annihilation scenario we expect an enhancement to the DM abundance relative to the thermal case. To analyze this scenario, we fit the upper\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nFigure 3. Constraints on the branching scenario in the ultralocal limit.

(2.2) to match the DM abundance, since the annihilation scenario requires \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009f \u2265 \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf , we have an absolute lower bound on Trh from DM overproduction in the case that the annihilation cross section matches the thermal value. The constraints due to DM overproduction bounds are displayed in figure 4, where the red shaded regions are excluded. We also show potentially excluded regions depending on the annihilation cross section for values 3\u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf (blue region), 10\u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf (green region), and 30\u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf (yellow region). These regions are excluded by DM overproduction if the annihilation cross section is between the thermal value and the given reference value, i.e. excluded if \u3008\u03c3annv\u3009f \u2264 n\u3008\u03c3annv\u3009thf for n \u2208 {3, 10, 30}, but may still be allowed for larger cross sections (so long as they are consistent with upper bounds from data). In the thermal case, the white region may also potentially overproduce DM, depending on the annihilation cross section. Furthermore, if one were to assume some model with multi-component DM, more stringent overproduction constraints may be expected.\nFor our benchmark value, which from eq. (5.5) gives Trh ' 18.7GeV, we see that we can have the annihilation scenario only for mDM & 400GeV, while we are reduced to the thermal scenario if mDM . 400GeV. Furthermore, potential DM overproduction in the annihilation scenario may be slightly improved with some minor adjustments: decreasing \u03bb by a factor of 3 and increasing gs ' 0.15 then increases the reheat temperature by a factor of roughly 3/2, easing the required annihilation cross section to match the observed DM abundance by a factor of roughly 2/3.\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nFigure 4.

In the local limit and in the best case scenario with k1 = 1 and k2 = 0, the decay of \u03c6u into Higgs degrees of freedom is given by eq. (4.46) and looks like\n\u0393(\u03c6u \u2192 HuHd) ' 5 16Z 2 \u03930.

(5.9) Due to the reduction in the visible sector decay width compared to the ultralocal scenario, we find a value of Z & 10 is required in order to avoid dark radiation overproduction. Thus, for Z = 10 and g\u2217(Trh) ' 86.25, the reheating temperature becomes\nTrh = 20.8 GeV\u00d7 (\nmu 2.5\u00d7 107 GeV\n)3/2 .

For the annihilation scenario in the local limit, our analysis for the ultralocal limit also applies. From figure 4, we see that we would expect the annihilation scenario only for mDM & 430GeV, and the thermal scenario for mDM . 430GeV."

            "text": "Fibre inflation models feature a Calabi-Yau volume of the form (3.1) where the role of the inflaton is played by the mode u orthogonal to the overall volume. This is a largefield inflationary model which predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio at the edge of detectability, r ' 0.007. Compared to K\u00e4hler moduli inflation, the Hubble scale during inflation is higher, HI ' mu \u223c 5\u00d7 1013 GeV, and value of the volume needed to match As is smaller, V \u223c 103. In turn, even with sequestering, the scale of SUSY breaking turns out to be relatively high, M1/2 \u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 GeV. Table 2 shows a benchmark example with values motivated from [59] where these parameter choices were shown to reproduce the observed amplitude of the density perturbations. Given that in this case the inflaton is the lightest K\u00e4hler modulus, there is no period of early matter domination and inflationary reheating transitions directly into a radiation dominated universe via the perturbative decay of \u03c6u. The decay width into the two ultralight axions a1 and a2 is again given by eq. (5.1). The decay rates into visible sector\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nfields takes again the form (5.2) and (5.7) for the ultralocal and local limits respectively. However, in this case soft masses are around the intermediate scale, M1/2 \u223c 1010-1011 GeV, and so neutralino DM would be grossly overproduced in both thermal and non-thermal scenarios since naively \u3008\u03c3v\u3009 \u221d m\u22122DM for WIMPs. We need therefore to focus on scenarios with R-parity breaking where neutralinos are unstable. The origin of DM therefore has to be different. Ref. [60] argued that the potential of Fibre inflation is rich enough to be able to generate primordial black holes that can constitute all of DM in an appropriate mass range, with the associated production of detectable secondary gravity waves [61]. Given that this possibility involves a consistent tuning of the underlying parameters, we instead investigate whether DM can be made up of axions produced via the standard misalignment mechanism. These can be either the two ultra-light axions a1 and a2 which for V ' 103 have masses and decay constants in the right ballpark to behave as fuzzy dark matter [62], or the QCD axion realized as the phase of a charged open string field living on the visible sector D3-brane stack [4]. However, strong constraints on the type of axion are imposed due to existing bounds on isocurvature perturbations for cases where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken during inflation so that the axion is effectively massless and undergoes quantum fluctuations of order HI/(2\u03c0). More precisely, when an axion (which can be either the QCD axion or an ultra-light axion) saturates the DM relic abundance for a decay constant fa > HI and an initial misalignment angle \u03b8i, the bound on the inflationary scale from the measured amplitude of isocurvature modes is [63, 64]\nHI . 1.4\u00d7 10\u22125 fa \u03b8i. (5.12)\nFor HI ' 5 \u00d7 1013 GeV, this bound can be translated into a strong bound on fa of the form fa \u03b8i & mP , implying that fa has to be at least of order the Planck scale since \u03b8i \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. As shown in [62], each of the two bulk axions could be fuzzy dark matter with fa1 \u223c fa2 \u223c mP /V2/3 which is definitely below mP for V ' 103. This implies that fuzzy dark matter is not allowed in Fibre inflation. The other possibility is to look at the QCD axion. As shown in section 4.3, the QCD axion can arise from the phase of a matter field living on the D3-brane stack. Its decay constant fQCD is set by the VEV of the associated radial field that is stabilized by an interplay of D- and F-terms. As shown in [4], the value fQCD depends on the level of sequestering of the visible sector from the source of SUSY breaking in the bulk. In particular, focusing on the benchmark mass spectrum of table 2, we have\nlocal limit : fQCD ' m3/2 ' 1015 GeV ultralocal limit : fQCD 'M1/2 ' 5\u00d7 1010 GeV.\nIn the local limit, fQCD is therefore above HI , implying that this case is also ruled out by isocurvature bounds. On the other hand, in the ultralocal limit, fQCD < HI , and so during inflation the axion is heavy given that the spontaneous breaking of the PecceiQuinn symmetry has not occured yet. Thus in this case the system is free from isocurvature bounds, and the decay constant of the open string axion is in the right energy regime to constitute all of dark matter [65].\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 6 8\nThe ultralocal limit seems therefore favored to describe dark matter. In this case eq. (5.3) and eq. (5.4) give again the branching ratio to hidden light degrees of freedom and the reheat temperature, respectively. Taking g\u2217(Trh) = 106.75 and Z = 3 (to avoid dark radiation overproduction), we have a relatively high reheat temperature of order\nTrh ' 4.07\u00d7 1010 GeV\u00d7 (\nmu 4.4\u00d7 1013 GeV\n)3/2 .

            "text": "In this work, we have studied the production of dark matter and dark radiation after reheating in string inflation models with a fibred Calabi-Yau structure and the visible sector on D3-branes. We have imposed several physical constraints, related to the need to match observed quantities, like the amplitude of the density perturbations generated during inflation and the dark matter density, or coming from the requirement to avoid the overproduction of dark radiation and isocurvature modes. The interplay between these different physical quantities is determined by the consistency of the underlying UV model which fixes also the scale of supersymmetry breaking, that determines the WIMP mass scale, and the decay constant of both closed and open string axions. We have seen that this UV correlation is very powerful in constraining the nature of dark matter. In fact, choosing benchmark points preferred by cosmological data for each of our string inflation scenarios, we have found distinct predictions for the nature of dark matter which are compatible with current experimental bounds. In the case of K\u00e4hler moduli inflation, we have found TeV-scale WIMPs which can easily reproduce the observed DM density in both the local and ultralocal limits. The case of Fibre inflation instead predicts open string axions as the DM candidate within the ultralocal limit, where isocurvature constraints exclude the local limit. While we found that an excess of dark radiation is generic in fibred LVS models, we have shown that this can be compatible with the latest Planck measurements without any significant tuning. Let us also point out that Planck bounds on Neff can be relaxed if local measurements of H0 are assumed as a prior, and a small but non-zero amount of dark radiation could also be an intriguing effect to weaken the present H0 tension [66]. Let us finally stress that our analysis involved KMI and FI for fibred Calabi-Yaus with the MSSM on D3-branes. We will instead leave the study of the case where the MSSM is on D7-branes for future work [67]."
