This paper introduces time-based addiction, which refers to excessive engagement in an activity that results in negative outcomes due to the misallocation of time. This type of addiction is often seen in media-related activities such as video games, social media, and television watching. Behavioural design in video games plays a significant role in enabling timebased addiction. Games are designed to be engaging and enjoyable, with features such as rewards, leveling up, and social competition, which is all intended to keep players coming back for more. This article reviews the behavioural design used in video games, and media more broadly, to increase the addictive nature of these experiences. By doing so the article aims to recognise time-based addiction as a problem that in large part stems from irresponsible design practices. 1 conclusion The goal of this paper was to recognise and define time-based addiction as a problem that is still in its early stages. It is evident from the analysis in this article that behavioural design in video games has increased the addictive potential of video games. Further, other forms of media have borrowed from behavioural design in video games in the form of gamification. This on its own points towards an intuition shared by researchers and practitioners - that video game design if used irresponsibly may be a large source of time-based addiction.
