This work studied a two-dimensional (2D) ZnMgFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) for ceftriaxone sodium (CTX) adsorption. This LDH showed a crystallite size of 9.8 nm, a BET surface area of 367.59 m g\u22121, and a micro-sphere-like morphology. The factors investigated in this study were the adsorbent dose, initial concentration, initial pH, and contact time. ZnMgFe LDH showed 99% removal of CTX with a maximum adsorption capacity of 241.75 mg g\u22121 at pH = 5. The Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich model was found to be the most adequate isotherm model. The spent adsorbent (ZnMgFe LDH/CTX) was reused as an electro-oxidation catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells. ZnMgFe LDH/CTX showed almost a 10-fold increase in electrochemical activity for all scan rates compared to bare ZnMgFe LDH in 1 M KOH. As methanol concentration increases, the maximum current density generated by both the ZnMgFe LDH and ZnMgFe LDH/CTX samples increases. Moreover, the maximum current density for ZnMgFe LDH/CTX was 47 mA cm\u22122 at a methanol concentration of 3 M. Both samples possess reasonable stability over a 3600 S time window with no significant deterioration of electrochemical performance. Moreover, the antimicrobial studies showed that ZnMgFe LDH had a significant antifungal (especially Aspergillus, Mucor, and Penicillium species) and antibacterial (with greater action against Gram-positive than negative) impact on several severe infectious diseases, including Aspergillus. This study paves the way for the reuse and valorization of selected adsorbents toward circular economy requirements.",

            "text": "Chemical and biochemical industrial processes have caused the discharge of numerous potential emerging pollutants (PEPs) in wastewater effluents. PEPs are classied as hazardous materials by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.1 Conventional wastewater treatment plants cannot handle the existence of such emerging pollutants in wastewater feed streams.2 Several technologies are under investigation for the treatment of such contaminated wastewater streams including adsorption. Adsorption can be dened as the accumulation of a pollutant (adsorbate) onto the surface of adsorbents for the purpose of separation from a medium.3 Several conventional\nanotechnology, Faculty of Postgraduate iversity, Beni-Suef 62511, Egypt eni-Suef University, 62511, Egypt. E-mail:\na 43511, Suez, Egypt\neterinary Medicine, Beni-Suef University,\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nand nano-adsorbents have been recognized as considerable candidates for the separation of PEPs from wastewater samples. One of the promising 2D nano-adsorbents under investigation is layered double hydroxides (LDHs). LDHs are dened as 2D anionic clay materials, similar in structure to brucite, which possess the chemical formula [M(II)(1 \u2212 x)M(III)x(OH)2]\nx+(An\u2212)x/ n$yH2O. M(II) is a divalent cation such as Mg, Cu, or Co while M(III) is a trivalent cation such as Al, Cr, or Fe, and An\u2212 represents the negative anions such as CO3 \u22122, Cl\u2212, and NO3 \u2212.4 LDHs have attracted much interest as adsorbents due to their adequate specic surface area, low toxicity, high removal capacity, simple recoverability procedures, cost-effective synthesis, and stable physicochemical properties.5\nOn the other hand, nding a promising nano-adsorbent is not enough to achieve a sustainable and cost-effective largescale adsorption process. Achieving circular economy principles requires further investigations to modify, reuse and valorize spent adsorbents that can no longer be regenerated.6,7 Currently, the strategy of reusing spent adsorbents became an important eld of research. Recently, Baskar et al.8 illustrated\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26069\u201326088 | 26069\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 0\n1 Se\npt em\nbe r\n20 23\n.

One strategy to valorize spent adsorbents is reincorporating them into different applications and/or technologies such as catalysis, super-capacitors, (bio)sensors, composite-llers, and additives. One particular application, methanol electro-oxidation, is a promising route to valorize spend adsorbents. Methanol is a promising fuel that can be oxidized in a direct methanol fuel cell to produce carbon dioxide and water as oxidation products.9 At the anode, water and methanol are consumed to produce protons, electrons, and carbon dioxide. The electrons ow in an external circuit and reach the cathode to reduce oxygen. Numerous nanomaterials were investigated as anodematerials that can efficiently catalyze the methanol consumption reaction.10\u201312 Investigating spent adsorbents as methanol fuel cell anodes is a novel eld of research, which can lead to producing cheap and effective anode materials. This can lead to improving the performance and decrease the cost of direct alcohol fuel cells in the future.\nBased on the aforementioned aspects, this study devoted particular attention to the valorization of the waste material aer drug adsorption, the protection of the environment, and energy production in an innovative concept for a multifunctional LDH structure. Few studies, in the open literature, report the reuse of spent LDH aer adsorption. Our research group has contributed to this eld by investigating novel techniques to reuse and/or valorize spent LDH-based nanoadsorbents. Abdel-Hady et al.13 prepared ZnCoFe LDH using a simple co-precipitation-based method. The synthesized ZnCoFe LDH was used as a nano-adsorbent for methylene blue (MB) adsorption. The adsorbent showed a removal percent of 88.6% at pH 7, 100 mg L\u22121 MB concentration, and 0.1 g of LDH. The spent adsorbent was analyzed as a direct methanol electrooxidation (DMEO) catalyst. The study showed a maximum current density of 41.11 mA cm\u22122 at methanol concentration =\nScheme 1 The procedure of reusing ZnMgFe LDH spent adsorbent for\n26070 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26069\u201326088\n3 M and 50 mV s\u22121 scan rate. In another study, Abdel-Hady et al.14 synthesized double substituted NiCo\u2013ZnFe LDH, which was calcined at 200 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C, and 600 \u00b0C. The NiCo\u2013ZnFe LDH adsorbent and the resultant mixed metal oxides (MMO) aer calcination were used for the adsorption of methyl orange (MO). The spent adsorbents (aer MO adsorption) were reused as electro-catalysts for DMEO, the samples showed a maximum current density of 6.46 and 10.1 mA cm\u22122 for the LDH andMMO (calcined at 200 \u00b0C) respectively. Kamal et al.15 prepared CoZnFe LDH for oxytetracycline (OTC) adsorption showing an adsorption capacity of 240.29 mg g\u22121 (100% removal percentage). The spent adsorbent was used for DMEO and showed a maximum current density of approximately 18 mA cm\u22122 in 0.74 M methanol and 60 mV s\u22121 scan rate.\nAdditionally, the incidence of fungal musculoskeletal diseases in animals and humans, particularly those infected by wastewater, makes water disinfection applications crucial. Candida is frequent. Candida albicans is a soil-dwelling human commensal. Aspergillus bone and joint infections have a poor prognosis and neurological complications. Immunosuppression, intravenous drugs, chronic illnesses, and surgery predispose hosts. Polluted air or water pipes might transmit nosocomial diseases. The most frequent pathogen is Aspergillus fumigatus, followed by A. Flavus and A. Niger. Targeted and personalized antifungal treatment is needed.16 Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms cause a minority of bone and joint infections. Before the Hib immunization, Haemophilus inuenza caused septic arthritic joints in pre-schoolers.17 So water sanitation is a critical issue for the prevention of serious infective diseases in both animals and humans.\nThe aim of the current work is to prepare, characterize and investigate multifunctional ZnMgFe LDH as a 2D nanoadsorbent for ceriaxone sodium (CTX) adsorption from simulated wastewater.

Chemical solutions were stock tested in saline. Standard technique broth diluted the stock solution (Difco). Twofold serial dilutions of the broth with 108 CFU mL\u22121 test microorganisms are produced. Each 96-well microtiter plate well received the solution. Microplates were sealed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humid environment for 24 hours to achieve antibacterial activity. The MIC values were the lowest chemical concentrations that did not generate apparent turbidity before incubation. An uninoculated medium was the control in investigations using the test compounds. Each experiment was repeated three times for repeatability. SPSS version 21 generatedmeans and SD values, and P values less than 0.05 were statistically signicant.\n2.6.3 Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC).

The rst horizontal row of plate wells received 100 mL of the tested nanomaterials emulsion. Concentrations ranged from 1000 to 1.9 mg mL\u22121 aer transferring a 100 mL aliquot from the most concentrated well to the next. Each column of the plate received 10 mL of an inoculum suspension comprising various strains. A positive control (medium without fungal strains) and a negative control (medium without materials and fungal strains) were cultivated in cycloheximide (media with the fungi but without nanomaterials). Each well of SDB plates contained 100 mL of SDB with varied nanomaterial concentrations in 2-fold serial dilutions (1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, 7.81, 3.95, and 1.95 mg mL\u22121).

The experiment examined nanomaterials' effects on fungus cell walls in sorbitolcontaining and control mediums. Sorbitol at 0.8 M (5 g L\u22121) was added to peptone water medium (15 g L\u22121).

The increased MIC values in the medium with added sorbitol compared to the regular medium showed that ZnMgFe LDHmay target the fungal cell wall due to its osmotic protective properties. Placebo was cycloheximide. The arithmetic mean of three assays was reported.24\n2.6.6 Minimum fungicidal concentration assay (MFC). To test the MFC, we infected SDA-coated Petri plates with 100 mL aliquots of MIC, MIC 2, and MIC 4 of the nanomaterials, cycloheximide, and the fungal growth negative control. Aer 72 hours at 25 \u00b0C, the MFC was assessed by control organism growth. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was the lowest product concentration that inhibited fungi growth by 50 or 99.9%.25 MIC and MFC values were averaged from triplicate biological activity assays. Both dilution approaches could verify whether the chemical is active, but they cannot indicate whether it would kill or delay the fungus. The MFC test is used for this. Depending on the fungus species, broth dilution test aliquots are subcultured on a rich solid medium and incubated for a set time and temperature. The MFC is the lowest drug concentration where no subculture growth is seen, according to CLSI-standardized publications. MFC may reveal fungicide or fungistatic activity. If the MFC and MIC are the same, the drug is a compound fungicide; if it is greater, it is fungistatic.26\n2.6.7 Disc diffusion assay.Whatman lter paper discs were manufactured and sterilized in 10 screw-capped wide-mouthed containers for standard-size (50 mm diameter) disc diffusion examination of all tested bacteria. The bottles went through a 150 \u00b0C hot air oven. Then, sterile lter paper standard discs were impregnated with a 1000 mg mL\u22121 solution of NaTNT in saline. They were then duplicated on nutrient agar plates with the appropriate test organism. The standard antibacterial test used 108 CFU mL\u22121. Two lter paper discs were infected in 12 cm Petri plates. Gram-positive S. pneumonia, S. aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli, Haemophillus inuenza, and Bacillus subtlis were used as test organisms (ATCC 35021). Gramnegative, Gram-positive, and fungus were treated with doxycycline. For bacteria and fungi, plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours and 25 \u00b0C for 5 days. Twofold serial dilution showed a large derivative growth inhibition zone.\n2.6.8 Agar diffusion method for fungal isolates. The agar diffusion technique is a semi-quantitative assay that applies a sample with a known concentration to a Sabaroud agar surface that has been inoculated with a standard number of fungal cells (Aspergillus avus RCMB 02782, Aspergillus fumigatus RCMB 02564, and Aspergillus niger RCMB 02782), Candidacies (Candida albicans RCMB 05). The sample may be administered by disc diffusion, in which 6 mm sterile lter paper discs are soaked in the sample and applied to the agar surface in the presence of cycloheximide, the standard antifungal. Samples produce a circular concentration gradient in the agar medium aer inoculation. As the fungus grows around the disc, the sample's antifungal effect will limit growth. This inhibitory zone is measured in millimeters and classied as full inhibition, medium inhibition, or no inhibition by certain authors.27,28\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The SEM images of the prepared ZnMgFe LDH nanocomposite show layers, sheets, and microsphere-like structures, which are characteristic of LDH materials. Fig. 1a shows microspheres and cross-linked nanoake structures, which conrm the high porosity of the prepared Zn\u2013Fe\u2013Mg LDH that improves the active site channel for the prepared adsorbate and enhances the adsorption capacity. The ower-like morphology and accumulation of layers presented in Fig. 1b may be due to the precipitation technique for sample preparation. This accumulation provides low crystallinity and higher surface area as it would be illustrated by the BET technique. The interlayers generated from aggregations into the LDH build channels and pits structure which facilitate the intercalation between ZnMgFe LDH and ceriaxone. The particle size distribution was calculated to range between 250 and 430 nm. EDX analysis was conducted to conrm the presence of Zn, Fe, and Mg.

FTIR spectra of ZnMgFe LDH and ZnMgFe LDH/ CTX nanocomposites were provided in Fig. 3b. As observed for Zn\u2013Fe\u2013Mg LDH, the broad bands that appeared at 3418 cm\u22121 and 1635 cm\u22121 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH), which originated from water molecules and the deformation of metal oxides. Additionally, the band that occurred at 1380 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the bending of nitrate groups arising from metal nitrate salt. All bands below 850 cm\u22121 were assigned to the vibration of the metal\u2013oxygen lattice, M\u2013O, M\u2013OH, and M\u2013O\u2013M vibrations. for ZnMgFe LDH/CTX, the main absorption band at 3418 cm\u22121 in ZnMgFe LDH has shied to a higher wavelength of 3480 cm\u22121 indicating promoted hydrogen bonding between ZnMgFe LDH\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Based on frequencies of the FTIR spectra of ZnMgFe LDH and ceriaxone, the strong band appeared around 1739 cm\u22121 due to carboxylic (C]O) in the ceriaxone drug. The band at 1604 cm\u22121, was assigned to (C]N) groups stretching.36 The broad band at 1100 cm\u22121 is due to aromatic (C\u2013H) bending and (M\u2013O) stretching (overlapped).36\nThe thermal stability and phase transition of the ZnMgFe LDH and ZnMgFe LDH/CTXmaterial were investigated utilizing the TGA/DTG technique. Fig. 3c depicts the TGA/DTG curves of ZnMgFe LDH, which indicated three major weight loss steps. Below 125 \u00b0C, the weight loss is ascribed to water removal from the surface and interlayers of the LDH.36 The second stage, which has a temperature ranging between 125\u2013210 \u00b0C, was caused by the dehydration of LDH brucite-like layers.

The total weight loss that occurred at 880 \u00b0C was 41.20%. The mentioned results are consistent with the DTG curve illustrated in Fig. 3c. The DTG curve had three distinct peaks at 125 \u00b0C, 210 \u00b0C, 650 \u00b0C, and 880 \u00b0C. The peak at 125 \u00b0C was associated with water elimination, the peak at 210 \u00b0C with LDH interlayer dehydration, and the peak at 880 \u00b0C with recrystallization and nitrate desorption.37 As shown in Fig. 3d illustrating the TGA/DTA curves for ZnMgFe LDH/CTX, both successive endothermic peaks located at 162 \u00b0C and 270 \u00b0C were attributed to interlayered water and dihydroxylation removal. There were further mass losses around 640 \u00b0C and 819 \u00b0C in the TGA/DTA curves, which were caused by the organic guest combustion of ceriaxone. At 162 \u00b0C, the decomposition started, suggesting it was the interaction of ceriaxone with ZnMgFe LDH through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, and van der Waals force. This explains how the ZnMgFe LDH/CTX nanostructure was enhanced in thermal stability.\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image for ZnMgFe/ LDH aer adsorption is shown in Fig. 3e and f and demonstrates a uniformly rough surface with several pores.

            "text": "3.2.1 Effect of pH and adsorbent dosage. The effect of pH on CTX adsorption is shown in Fig. 4a. CTX has 3 dissociation constants at pK1 = 3, pK2 = 3.2, and pK3 = 4.1,38 therefore increasing pH above pKa leads to negative charge formation on CTX.39. At low pH values, CTX is positively charged and ZnMgFe LDH has a zeta potential of 35 mV (Fig. 4b). The electrostatic repulsion between both CTX and ZnMgFe LDH is the main reason for the low RE% at pH = 3. In the pH range 5\u20137, the charge of ZnMgFe LDH is positive (as shown in Fig. 4b) and CTX becomes negatively charged. Therefore, the electrostatic attraction plays a signicant role in increasing the observable RE%. In addition, the agglomeration of ZnMgFe LDH is of minimum value as represented by the hydrodynamic size values (Fig. 4c). At higher pH values, electrostatic attraction is outweighed by the high agglomeration of ZnMgFe LDH (Fig. 4c) and RE% decreases. Since ZnMgFe LDH has minimum agglomeration at pH = 5 and RE% was insignicantly different in the range pH = 5\u20137, the value of pH = 5 was chosen as the optimum pH for further investigations.\nFig. 4b reects the decrease in the value of the zeta potential of ZnMgFe LDH with a pH increase. This is a common trend for LDH samples where the positive charge of LDH layers decreases with the increase in pH.40\u201342 This can be attributed to the deprotonation reaction of LDH with increasing OH\u2212 ions\notential of ZnMgFe LDH at different pH values, (c) hydrodynamic size of\nthe RE% of CTX on ZnMgFe LDH.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

This reaction can be represented by the following equation for the ZnMgFe LDH sample43,44\nZn2Mg2FeOH + OH \u2212 = Zn2Mg2FeO \u2212 + H2O\nFig. 4d illustrates the effect of the adsorbent dose on the removal efficiency of CTX. The removal efficiency of CTX increased to 59%with a dose of 0.05 g. This may be attributed to the presence of more accessible active sites for adsorption in the ZnMgFe LDH structure. However, the % RE of CTX was reduced upon a further increase in LDH dose. This can be attributed to the aggregation of LDH particles with higher doses.45 Fig. 4c illustrates the hydrodynamic size of ZnMgFe LDH at different pH values. As shown, when pH values are very low (acidic) or very high (alkaline), excessive agglomeration occurs. This may be attributed to the presence of a high concentration of background ions, originating from the added acid or alkali to adjust the pH value, leading to such agglomeration.\n3.2.2 Effect of initial concentration. Various isotherm models (Fig. 5) were investigated to t the experimental data of ZnMgFe LDH as an adsorbent. The models used were Langmuir,46 Freundlich,47 Temkin, Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (D\u2013R),48 Langmuir\u2013Freundlich, Sips,49 Redlich\u2013Peterson,50,51 Toth,52 Fritz\u2013Schlunder, and Baudu53 isotherms. The results show that the Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich model is the most adequate with the highest R2 value of 0.98 as illustrated in Table 2. Using higher parameter isotherms did not correspond to improving the value of R2. Other statistical error functions were computed, and the results are illustrated in Table 3. D\u2013R isotherm is\nFig. 5 Isotherm plots for CTX adsorption onto ZnMgFe LDH (a) two param parameter isotherm models (d) kinetic modeling of CTX adsorption on Z ln(Kd) versus inverted temperature, 1/T (K \u22121).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

D\u2013R model does not include an assumption for the presence of a homogenous surface or constant adsorption potential throughout its derivation.54 D\u2013R model reects that CTX adsorption on the ZnMgFe LDH is a physical adsorption process in nature with multilayer formation.55\n3.2.3 Adsorption kinetics. Fig. 5d shows the adsorption kinetics of CTX where equilibrium was reached below 10 minutes. All models showed a high value of R2 of 0.99 (Table 4). Other statistical error functions were computed, and the results are illustrated in Table 5. The mixed rst and second order showed the least error. This is considered the most suitable model for the kinetics data. This equation is an advanced form of adsorption kinetics modeling compared to both the rst and second orders.57 It is considered a combination of both the rst and second-order equations in one generic model suitable for real-life adsorption studies.57\n3.2.4 Effect of temperature. The effect of adsorption temperature was investigated at the optimum conditions at various temperatures: 25\u201355 \u00b0C. Fig. 5e shows the decrease in removal efficiency of CTX with increasing the temperature of adsorption.

ZnMgFe LDH consists of a layered structure built from the octahedrons of Zn, Mg, and Fe centers surrounded by OH groups as shown in Scheme 2. CTX and ZnMgFe LDH can interact in different mechanisms as illustrated in Scheme 2. One possible mechanism is the interaction between positive cations (Zn, Mg, and Fe) in the octahedral position of the LDH layer and CTX atoms having lone electron pairs. Another interaction mechanism is the hydrogen bonding possibly formed between hydrogen and oxygen on the surface of the LDH layers.61 Aer the monolayer formation of CTX molecules, multilayers may form as indicated by the suitability of D\u2013R model for isotherm data.\nAs illustrated in Table 7, which compares the results of the prepared material to other adsorbents, ZnMgFe showed 99.7% removal efficiency for CTX.

From this viewpoint, the studied ZnMgFe LDH might serve as a viable alternative to conventional antibiotics in reducing bacterial resistance.\nRegarding the fungal broth microdilution test for ZnMgFe LDH, a lot of studies have investigated the interaction of nanomaterials with bacteria, but only a few have investigated their effect on fungi. This might be due to the relative simplicity of bacterial and fungal systems.76 According to this study's antifungal inquiry, ZnMgFe LDH severely impactsMucor strain. Mucor contagious species, like other invasive fungal illnesses, cause immunosuppression (especially delayed and excessive neutropenia, a severe hematological disease with or without stem cell transplantation, and delayed corticosteroids) that predisposes to Mucormycosis.77 Iron overload, poorly managed diabetes mellitus with or without diabetic ketoacidosis, and deferoxamine-containing medications increase risk.78 Aspiratory or rhino-orbito-cerebral fungal spores are the main cause of Mucormycosis. Aer burns, Mucorales spp. infections have grown.79 Infections may occur without risk factors. Insect bites and animal scrapes sometimes allowed spores to enter tissue.80 Mucormycosis of the gastrointestinal system, especially from ingested spores, has also been documented.81 All Mucormycosis invade blood arteries and cause thrombosis and tissue damage. Angio-invasion also explains Mucormycosis infection spread.82 Mucormycosis is distinguished from conspicuous Aspergillosis by its histological abnormalities, quick dynamic character, and extensive tissue rot. Diabetes, press overload, and deferoxamine medication increase Mucormycosis risk. This fungus is dangerous, thus new antifungal medications to treat or prevent severe fungal infections are needed.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 8d and e, the MICs for all of the tested isolates were similar to the MFCs, indicating the fungicidal activity of ZnMgFe LDH. The ZnMgFe LDH was effective against all fungi, especially Mucor, Aspergillus species, and Penicillium strains (166 and 83 mg mL\u22121, respectively). They displayed antifungal activity against other species, including A. avus (250 mg mL\u22121), at greater concentrations. As seen in Fig. 8e, the MFC for ZnMgFe LDH demonstrated outstanding fungicidal activity against Penicillium and Mucor (83 and 166 mg mL\u22121, respectively).\nAn experiment with sorbitol was repeated and analyzed to assess the nanomaterial's antifungal activity (ZnMgFe LDH's antifungal mechanism). To determine the specic method of action of the examined drugs against varied fungal strains, the MIC values were repeated on various sorbitol mediums. A lower effective MIC indicates an impact on the fungal cell wall. Despite higher MIC values, ZnMgFe LDH was more potent against Penicillium, Mucor, and A. fumigatus at 62 and 85 mg mL\u22121.

On SDA plates, inhibitory zones against a variety of fungal strains were evaluated, and Fig. 9c depicts a variety of concentrations. ZnMgFe LDH displayed a good zone of inhibition against Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Candida at 1000, 500, and 250 mg mL\u22121, in contrast to the traditional antifungal for quickly growing fungi (chlorohexidine).

The antifungal activity of ZnMgFe LDH is a consequence of its unique characteristics, such as its small size, large surface area, and uniform dispersion. Eighty percent is the greatest inhibitory percentage against A. fumigatus isolates.\nAntimicrobial resistance is responsible for signicant social and economic losses.

In the growth medium of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), the partial dissolution of various synthetic LDHs M(II)\u2013Al(III) (M = Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mg) was investigated. Several characteristics (crystallinity, M(II) : Al(III) ratio, type of intercalated anion, and nature of M(II) cations) were studied to determine their effect. LDHs which is composed of Zn(II) and Cu(II) exhibited antibacterial action. The antibacterial action of the investigated LDHs was connected rst to the type of the divalent metal and then to the quantity of MII ions released into the culture medium. This impact was recognized more readily in several LDHs whose lowest inhibitory concentration reduced dramatically as greater quantities of connected ions were released from LDH-tested material.86\nRecent studies on the antibacterial activity of pure LDHs such as MgAl-LDH, MgFe-LDH, and ZnAl-LDH have been very limited.87\u201389 In these studies, however, the large doses (316\u2013 14,000 mg mL\u22121) and cumbersome manufacturing techniques (heating >80 \u00b0C or >2 h aging period) of LDHs hinder their antibacterial applicability. To prevent these aws, LDHs might be replaced with antibacterial transition metal ions using a different technique. Due to their effective antibacterial action,90\u201393 multiple ions have been frequently used in the manufacture of inorganic antimicrobial drugs. Among the highvalent cations studied, such as Al or Zn, the toxicity of ions to bacteria was the lowest.94 Thus, Mg, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co assembled in Al-based LDHs (MAl-LDHs, M: Mg, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co) with nano production and a good performance against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n(Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria are urgently required for practical antibacterial application. To our knowledge, little or no prior research has shown the effectiveness of LDH against fungal infections.\nEven though, the real process or connection between metal inorganic framework structures and different illnesses has never been dened, several examples are possible. Consistent with the previous study, the inhibitory antibacterial action of ZnMgFe LDH may be related to the production of reactive oxygen species by its components, such as Zn, Mg, Fe, and Al. It is possible that the antibacterial action of ZnMgFe LDH was caused by the spontaneous generation of free radicals such as ROS, therefore triggering oxidative stress-mediated cell damage. Antibacterial activity in MgZnFeLDH might be due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS).95 In addition, the shape of nanomaterials may affect their antibacterial activity. The release of metal ions, which may inltrate into bacterial cells and alter their amino acid metabolism and enzyme system,96,97 is another potential antibacterial mechanism. Similar to that of bacteria, the antifungal activity of ZnMgFe LDH may be caused by an electrostatic contact between the LDHs and the fungal surface.\nIn addition, it was shown that ZnMgFe LDH permanently altered membrane features (charge, intra and extracellular permeability, and physicochemical properties). As the mechanism underlying the antibacterial effect of ZnMgFe LDH, changes in cell surface hydrophobicity, charge, enhanced PI absorption, and K+ leakage with local membrane rupture or hole formation in Gram-negative and positive bacteria were identied. These results are consistent with previous studies on\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26069\u201326088 | 26085\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 0\n1 Se\npt em\nbe r\n20 23\n.

The antimicrobial activity of LDH is dependent on the interaction between the LDH surface and the bacterial cell wall. The cell walls of both types of bacteria are composed of a layer of lipopolysaccharides linked to lipids by weak covalent bonds. The electrostatic interaction between the positive charges on the LDH surface and the negative charges on the lipopolysaccharides reduces the charge density on the bacterial surface, resulting in a decrease in bacterial cell viability; additionally, the large surface area of LDH contributes to its antimicrobial activity.98,99 The precise methods by which these nanostructures cause harm to bacterial cells are yet unknown; nevertheless, signicant emphasis has been paid to the morphological alterations that occur during in vitro investigations using these nanostructures. Three hypothesized processes are most widely acknowledged and documented in the scientic literature: (1) metal ion uptake (translocation and particle internalization) into cells followed by depletion of intracellular ATP production and disruption of DNA replication,100 (2) generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) from metal nanoparticles and metal ions, with subsequent oxidative damage to the cellular structures, and (3) accumulation and dissolution of metal nanoparticles within bacterial membranes resulting in changes in their permeability (the progressive release of labile ions).101\nHydrophobicity plays a critical role in the attachment of several bacterial species to their substrates, which is an additional element in the antibacterial activity of ZnMgFe LDH.102 There is substantial interaction between bacteria and hydrophobic surfaces, resulting in high cell attachment rates, according to research.59 Bacterial adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces may be a source of severe infections in hospitals.103 Therefore, it is important to develop hyper hydrophilic surfaces that decrease bacterial interaction with the substrate. Super hydrophilic surfaces provide a thin layer of water in a physiological environment, which may limit the formation of bacterial biolms by reducing bacterial adhesion.104 Ji et al.105 discovered that increasing the hydrophilicity of titanium surfaces reduced the adhesion of E. coli. Furthermore, the surface roughness may inuence bacterial adherence. Studies indicate that nanoscale roughness has antiadhesive characteristics. Research on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed this fact. Thus, the surface roughness of LDH may have contributed to their capacity to prevent bacterial adhesion.106 In this study, ZnMgFe LDH showed the greatest antibacterial activity; few investigations have demonstrated that LDHs have antimicrobial action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in addition to their antifungal activity."

ZnMgFe LDH was successfully prepared using a facile co-precipitation technique. ZnMgFe LDH was characterized using SEM, XRD, BET, FTIR, and zeta potential\n26086 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26069\u201326088\nmeasurements. ZnMgFe LDH was shown to be a promising nano-adsorbent for CTX with a removal efficiency reaching 99%. The spent adsorbent ZnMgFe LDH/CTX was reused as an electro-catalyst for methanol fuel cell applications. The spent adsorbent showed a maximum recorded current density value of 47 mA cm\u22122 at a methanol concentration of 3 M. Aer adsorption, the current density reached four to eightfold that of the as-prepared adsorbent. This reects the promising performance of the spent adsorbent for methanol electro-oxidation fuel cell applications. In addition, the antibacterial activity of ZnMgFe LDH against a range of severe illnesses produced by several harmful bacterial and fungal strains was assessed. In light of this, the study suggests that ZnMgFe LDHmight replace conventional antibiotics for bacterial or fungal infections in humans and animals. This research paves the way for the commercialization of effective nanomaterial in various applications, such as adsorption and electrocatalysts in methanol oxidation. The successful reutilization of spent adsorbents facilitates the achievement of circular economy principles and large-scale sustainable wastewater adsorption units.\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization, A.
