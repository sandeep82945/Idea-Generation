    "abstractText": "Significant research has been conducted on the influence of entrepreneurial intention on entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurship practice. Similarly, this study aims to explore how creativity plays a mediating role in the influence of personality traits on entrepreneurial intention. As many as 674 valid questionnaires were collected from college students in China, allowing the relationship between personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intention to be analyzed in detail. The following results are found through a series of explorations. First, neuroticism in personality traits has a significant negative impact on entrepreneurial intention, while conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion have a significant positive impact. Second, neuroticism has a significant negative impact on creativity, while conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion have a significant positive impact. Third, creativity has a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial intention, it has a partial mediating role between neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, and entrepreneurial intention along with a complete mediating role between openness and entrepreneurial intention. The research results further provide a reference value for the improvement and optimization of entrepreneurial practice.",

Similarly, this study aims to explore how creativity plays a mediating role in the influence of personality traits on entrepreneurial intention. As many as 674 valid questionnaires were collected from college students in China, allowing the relationship between personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intention to be analyzed in detail. The following results are found through a series of explorations. First, neuroticism in personality traits has a significant negative impact on entrepreneurial intention, while conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion have a significant positive impact. Second, neuroticism has a significant negative impact on creativity, while conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion have a significant positive impact. Third, creativity has a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial intention, it has a partial mediating role between neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, and entrepreneurial intention along with a complete mediating role between openness and entrepreneurial intention. The research results further provide a reference value for the improvement and optimization of entrepreneurial practice.\nKeywords: entrepreneurial intention, personality traits, creativity, college students, mediation\nINTRODUCTION\nEntrepreneurship has a significant impact on a country or region\u2019s economic, political, and social environment (Montiel and Clark, 2018). Entrepreneurship is a process that goes from idea to practice and from intention to implementation. A significantly positive correlation exists between entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial behavior (Kong et al., 2020). College students are often considered to be the potential targets of entrepreneurship. It is consequently necessary to improve their entrepreneurial intention (Veciana et al., 2005). The term entrepreneurial intention refers to the belief that an individual plans to start a new company in the future (Thompson, 2009), which exerts a significant predictive effect on entrepreneurial behavior (Boubker et al., 2021; Elnadi and Gheith, 2021).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 822206\nAmong the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention, personality traits are a significant one (S\u0327ahin et al., 2019; Ndovela and Chinyamurindi, 2021). Personality traits refer to the unchanging and stable psychological traits that individuals possess (Costa and McCrae, 1992). According to the existing research, the Big-Five Personality is one of the most comprehensive personality classifications available (Singh and DeNoble, 2003). Relevant empirical research has also found that personality traits have a significant impact on entrepreneurial intention (S\u0327ahin et al., 2019; Wu and Wu, 2020; Awwad and Al-Aseer, 2021; Khan et al., 2021). Research on the influence of personality traits on entrepreneurial intention has a great impact on improving university students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention.\nPrevious studies on entrepreneurial intentions have reported a mediating role of creativity (Imran et al., 2018; Danish et al., 2019; Chaubey et al., 2021). Murad et al. (2021) found that creativity significantly and positively impacts entrepreneurial intentions. Hu et al. (2018) found that entrepreneurial alertness exerts a mediating effect on the relationship among creativity, proactive personality, and entrepreneurial intention. Hamidi et al. (2008) suggested that creativity should be included as a predictor variable in empirical research on entrepreneurial intentions. Different personality traits may have different effects on creativity. For example, neuroticism has a significant negative impact on creativity. Influential people with high openness are more creative but exhibit less agreeableness (Karwowski and Lebuda, 2016). Moreover, conscientiousness, extroversion, and agreeableness positively and significantly impact creativity (Mumford, 2011). Openness has a positive and significant impact on creativity (Grohman et al., 2017; Jir\u00e1sek and Sudzina, 2020; Theurer et al., 2020). Creative people can maintain a positive attitude and a high degree of self-confidence when starting a business (Zhao et al., 2005). Some empirical studies have shown that creativity positively and significantly impacts entrepreneurial intentions (Shi et al., 2020; Murad et al., 2021; Tantawy et al., 2021). Personality traits may influence entrepreneurial intentions through creativity. Considering research gaps and practical needs, this research intends to explore the influence of personality traits on entrepreneurial intentions and the mediating role of creativity between personality traits and entrepreneurial preferences.\nIn summary, the present study has two objectives. First, considering that most of the previous research samples were from Western countries (S\u0327ahin et al., 2019; Awwad and AlAseer, 2021; Khan et al., 2021) and the vast differences between Chinese and Western cultures, the current study utilizes Chinese samples for verification. Second, this research explores the influence path of personality traits on entrepreneurial intentions from the perspective of mediation. Therefore, this research uses personality traits as the independent variable, creativity as the mediating variable, and entrepreneurial intention as the dependent variable to explore the influence mechanism between personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intentions. The study not only provides suggestions for improving college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intention but also summarizes the limitations and future directions, providing a solid foundation for future research."

The model highlights that the social background, cultural value, and personal factors can affect cognition, cognition can affect entrepreneurial intention, and cognition can affect entrepreneurial intentions through personal factors (Busenitz and Lau, 1996). The personality traits in this study can be regarded as personal factors. Studies have indicated that cognition is closely related to creativity (Sternberg and Lubart, 1999). Studies have also pointed out that cognition is the process of creativity formation (Runco and Chand, 1995; James et al., 2010). Therefore, creativity can be regarded as cognition. Empirical studies have shown that the personality traits significantly affect cognition (Schaie et al., 2004), and cognition has a positive and significant impact on entrepreneurial intentions (Bian et al., 2021). An empirical study by Liu and Wei (2003) found that the personal factors can significantly affect cognition, and cognition can significantly affect entrepreneurial organization and expansion intentions. Therefore, this study concludes that the personality traits can significantly affect creativity, thus significantly affecting entrepreneurial intentions. In other words, creativity may have an intermediary effect between personality traits and entrepreneurial intentions. The results of this research can extend the application of crosscultural cognitive models of startups and enhance the richness of their theoretical models and provide empirical research support for this theoretical model."

Personality traits are suitable for evaluating suitability for entrepreneurship (Zhao et al., 2010). Wang et al. (2016) proposed that the personality traits significantly impact individuals aiming to become entrepreneurs. Moreover, personality traits significantly impact the cognitive model of entrepreneurial intention (Karabulut, 2016; Fragoso et al., 2020). Different personality traits have different effects on entrepreneurial intentions. For example, neuroticism has a significant negative impact on entrepreneurial intentions, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness, whereas openness has positive and significant effects on entrepreneurial intentions (Israr and Saleem, 2018; Khan et al., 2021). High extroversion, openness, and conscientiousness have a strong impact on entrepreneurial intentions, whereas neuroticism and agreeableness have a weak impact on entrepreneurial intentions (Zhao et al., 2010; Brandstatter, 2011; Liang et al., 2015).

            "text": "Entrepreneurial Intention The evidence cited in this study on the relationship between personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intentions indicates that creativity may be one of the mediating variables between personality traits and entrepreneurial intentions. However, this factor has not received enough attention in the\npast. In previous studies, creativity was used as a mediating variable to explore the mediating role of creativity between the knowledge process and corporate performance (Imran et al., 2018). Creativity plays a mediating role between reform, openness, and the self-efficacy of innovative culture (Danish et al., 2019). Abdulaal and Nordin (2020) found that creativity has a mediating role between knowledge and human resource management. Creativity also plays a significant mediating role between training and organizational innovation (Chaubey et al., 2021). In addition, creativity plays a mediating role between participatory management and teacher job satisfaction (Zavvar et al., 2021). In summary, creativity has played a critical mediating role in past empirical research. Moreover, Fatoki (2010) pointed out that creativity is the key driving force for entrepreneurial intentions and an essential process for the formation of entrepreneurship. Based on the arguments of Hypotheses 1 and 3 and the aforementioned discussion, the present research provides a preliminary understanding of the relationship between personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intention. This research aims to verify that the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intentions may affect the mediating role of creativity. Therefore, this research puts forward the following hypothesis:\nH4: The creativity of college students plays a mediating role between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention."

            "text": "Multiple regression analyses serve to verify the hypothesis. Variance inflation factor (VIF) is used to test for multicollinearity. The results of previous empirical studies suggest that differences in gender, majors, and grades can cause significant differences in personality traits (Russo and Stol, 2020), including creativity (Vedel et al., 2015; Zia and Rouhollahi, 2020; He and Wong, 2021; Said-Metwaly et al., 2021) and entrepreneurial intention (Abba et al., 2021; Dao et al., 2021; Gurel et al., 2021). The t test and ANOVA test yield the following results. There is initially a significant difference between gender in entrepreneurial intention, where boys have higher results than girls. Second, there is a significant difference in entrepreneurial intention in majors where science students score higher than liberal arts. Third, significant differences exist in entrepreneurial intention in grades (F = 49.789, p<0.001), among which a freshman is higher than a sophomore, a junior is higher than a sophomore, a junior is higher than a senior, and a senior is higher than a sophomore. Gender, major, and grade are therefore chosen as control variables in this study.\nThe mediating role of creativity in college students between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention was tested by controlling the influence of gender, major, and grade. As shown in Table 2, in Model 1, neuroticism has a significant negative effect on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = \u20130.143, p < 0.001). Conversely, conscientiousness exerts a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.367, p < 0.001). agreeableness on the other hand has no significant effect on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.054, p > 0.05). Openness generates a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.117, p < 0.01). Extraversion has a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.229, p < 0.001). H1 is consequently established.\nAs presented in Model 2, neuroticism has a significant negative effect on creativity (\u03b2 = \u20130.066, p < 0.05). Conscientiousness has a significant positive effect on creativity (\u03b2 = 0.198, p < 0.001). Further, agreeableness has no significant effect on creativity (\u03b2 = 0.036, p > 0.05). Openness exerts a significant positive effect on creativity (\u03b2 = 0.417, p < 0.001). Extraversion shows a significant positive effect on creativity (\u03b2 = 0.141, p < 0.001). H2 is established as a result.\nThe mediator creativity is added in Model 3. Creativity has a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2 = 0.247, p < 0.001), thus establishing H3. When the \u03b2 value of neuroticism on entrepreneurial intention decreases from \u20130.143 to \u20130.126, it reaches a significant level (\u03b2 = \u2013 0.126, p < 0.001). Therefore, creativity plays a partial mediating role between neuroticism and entrepreneurial intention.

Therefore, creativity plays a partial mediating role between conscientiousness and entrepreneurial intention, and the significant effect of openness on entrepreneurial intention disappears (\u03b2 = 0.014, p > 0.05). Creativity plays a complete mediating role between openness and entrepreneurial intention. The \u03b2 value of extraversion on entrepreneurial intention reaches a significant level when it decreases from 0.229 to 0.194 (\u03b2 = 0.194, p < 0.001). Therefore, creativity plays a partial mediating role between extraversion and entrepreneurial intention. H4 is thus established.\nIn this study, The Sobel test is used in this study to further test the mediation effect (Sobel, 1982), which calculates the unstandardized regression coefficients and standard errors. A value of Z greater than 1.96 represents a significant mediation effect. The results show that Z = 23.317, p < 0.001, indicating that creativity plays a mediating role between personality traits and entrepreneurial intention. In Model 3, VIF is between 1.254\u20135.128, which is lower than the standard value of 10. This result suggests a lack of a serious collinearity problem (HairJr., Anderson et al., 1995), as shown in Table 2."

            "heading": "Theoretical Contributions",
            "text": "First, the results of this study indicated that college students\u2019 neuroticism has a significant negative impact on their entrepreneurial intentions. Besides, conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion have a significant positive impact on entrepreneurial intention, which is similar to the results obtained by Western empirical studies (Murugesan and Jayavelu, 2017; Israr and Saleem, 2018; S\u0327ahin et al., 2019; Kristanto and Pratama, 2020; Liu D. et al., 2021). The following conclusions can therefore be inferred. College students with low neuroticism have relatively fewer negative emotions such as anxiety and depression and are more able to withstand the obstacles brought by entrepreneurship. Furthermore, those with high conscientiousness have high self-demand, self-control, execution along a cautious attitude toward entrepreneurship. Students with high openness show strong curiosity, imagination, and cooperation and have innovative and open thinking about entrepreneurship. They are also talented at accepting suggestions\nfrom others. Students with high extroversion are passionate and fond of social activities, which allows them to make a wide range of entrepreneurial connections. Agreeableness has no significant effect on entrepreneurial intention, which is different from the conclusions of Western studies. Due to the cultural differences between China and the West, Chinese college students with high agreeableness show characteristics such as compassion and willingness to help others, which are not conducive to entrepreneurship.\nFurthermore, the results of this study indicated that college students\u2019 neuroticism has a significant negative impact on their creativity. Additionally, conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion have a significant positive impact on creativity. This is in line with the results of Western empirical studies (Jir\u00e1sek and Sudzina, 2020; Sadana et al., 2021; Sarma and Borooah, 2021). This study concludes that college students with low neuroticism are characterized by compulsive dependence and are more capable of using their creativity (Albert and Runco, 1987). In other words, college students with low neuroticism do not rely on help from others. Active thinking is conducive to divergent thinking and increases creativity. College students with high conscientiousness pay attention to details, do their work thoroughly and pursue achievement with creativity (McCrae, 1987). Agreeableness has nothing to do with creativity (Silvia et al., 2011). Furthermore, the higher the agreeableness, the lower the creativity (King et al., 1996). Conversely, negative qualities such as arrogance and hostility accompany high creativity (Feist, 1999). Being open-minded and curious makes it easier to gain new ideas (Goldberg, 1990). People with openness are characterized by flexible thinking and are willing to accept new ideas (Zhao and Seibert, 2006). Moreover, they are more capable of getting rid of traditional customs and adopting new and unique ways of thinking (Sung and Choi, 2009). People with extraversion are usually enthusiastic and sociable, which contributes to inspiring creativity (Prabhu et al., 2008).\nSecond, the results of this study indicated that the creativity of college students has a significant positive effect on entrepreneurial intentions, which is consistent with the results of Western empirical research (Hu et al., 2018; Entrialgo and Iglesias, 2020). This study concludes that college students with high creativity have novel ideas and innovative abilities. Innovative thinking can effectively develop available resources, while creative ideas make a positive contribution to\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 822206\nentrepreneurial intention (Biraglia and Kadile, 2017; Murad et al., 2021).\nFinally, the study results of the study also suggest that creativity plays a partial mediating role between neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, and entrepreneurial intention, while creativity plays a complete mediating role between openness and entrepreneurial intention. This result is consistent with the conclusions of previous empirical studies (Wang et al., 2018). College students with high creativity thus have divergent thinking and innovative thinking, consequently having more ideas to start new companies (Anjum et al., 2021).\nPractical Implications The research results further provide a reference value for the improvement and optimization of entrepreneurial practice. First, colleges and universities should perform relevant tests to understand personality traits when college students enroll. For college students with neuroticism, teachers can relieve their psychological pressure through psychological counseling. College students with conscientiousness should be encouraged to give lectures in class to strengthen their divergent logical thinking skills. In terms of college student\u2019s openness, teachers can motivate them to participate in the planning of class activities and the design of classroom training. In addition, activities such as scenario simulation and role-playing can train openness thinking and strengthen creativity. For college students with extraversion, they should be encouraged to participate in social activities, class organizations, or clubs. Through the above-mentioned teaching of personality traits in accordance with their aptitude, the entrepreneurship and creativity of college students can be significantly enhanced. Secondly, Colleges\nand universities should therefore create a diversified and open learning environment, conduct lectures that cultivate creativity and promote reading education. Furthermore, teachers should encourage students\u2019 enthusiasm by designing interesting educational interactions, such as group discussions, and affirm their uniqueness by encouraging students. At last, teachers should focus on students\u2019 different neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness to promote entrepreneurial intention and cultivate creativity."

The relationship among personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intention of college students can be deeply explored through qualitative in-depth interviews or a combination of quantitative and qualitative studies. Past research results show that goal orientation theory has been applied to creativity-related research (Huang and Luthans, 2015; Lee and Yang, 2015; Kaspi-Baruch, 2019). Therefore, followup research can apply goal orientation theory as well to explore the relationship among personality traits, creativity, and entrepreneurial intention. This study adopts the Big-Five Personality Traits Scale. A subjective personality has a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurial intention (Hu et al., 2018; Kumar and Shukla, 2019; Li et al., 2020), while a narcissistic personality has a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurship (Al-Ghazali and Afsar, 2021; Liu H. C. et al., 2021).
