            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "The following system of reaction-diffusion-advection equations was recently introduced in [6],\nTt = Txx \u2212 (uT )x + T (1\u2212 T ) ut = \u03bduxx \u2212 uux + \u03c1T (1\u2212 T ). (1.1)\nHere T (t, x) models the temperature of a fluid and u(t, x) represents the velocity of that fluid. The reaction term in the T component introduces growth of the temperature field due to the occurrence of a chemical reaction. The temperature increase also induces growth in the velocity profile with some proportionality constant \u03c1. Both temperature and velocity also are influenced by diffusion and advection. System (1.1) gives rise to traveling front solutions. Motivated by similar systems of coupled fluid and reaction-diffusion equations such as [8, 22] the goal of [6] is to understand how\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n06 72\n4v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nA P]\n1 3\ncoupling between the two variables affects the speed of these fronts. A more detailed description of model (1.1) and its relation to other models of reactive flow can be found in [6].\nThe authors in [6] study traveling fronts for (1.1) with a particular interest in how the speeds of these fronts depend on the parameters \u03c1 and \u03bd. The purpose of this paper is to study fronts in the inviscid problem (\u03bd = 0) and in the limit as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e. When \u03bd = 0 the traveling wave equations for (1.1) as a system of three first order ordinary differential equations. These systems have a conserved quantity which reduces the traveling wave equation to the following planar system, see [6]\ndT dx = \u2212c\u0303T + UT + 1 2\u03c1 U(2c\u0303\u2212 U) dU dx = \u03c1 U \u2212 c\u0303 T (1\u2212 T ). (1.2)\nTraveling fronts of (1.1) correspond to heteroclinic orbits of (1.2) that connect the PDE stable state (1, c\u0303 + \u03c1 \u2212 \u221a c\u03032 + \u03c12) to the PDE unstable state (0, 0). As is typical of fronts propagating into unstable states these fronts exist for a continuum of speeds c\u0303. Of particular interest is the front that is selected by compactly supported initial conditions. This front is often referred to as the critical front and its speed is known as the critical (or selected) spreading speed. Typically the critical front can be classified as being of one of two types: pulled or pushed. Pulled fronts are driven by the instability ahead of the front interface and their spreading speed equals that of compactly supported initial conditions for the equation linearized near the unstable steady state. Pushed fronts are driven by nonlinear effects behind the front interface propagate at (typically, see [17]) faster-than-linear speeds.\nDetermining the front selected by compactly supported initial data is associated to stability properties of the fronts; see [4, 9, 23]. Pulled fronts have essential spectrum that touches the imaginary axis in an optimally chosen exponentially weighted function space while pushed fronts have a zero translational eigenvalue and stable essential spectrum in the weighted space. This translational eigenvalue has a eigenfunction given by the derivative of the front profile and so for this function to be in the weighted space requires strong exponential decay of the front. When considering heteroclinic orbits in (1.2) this will mean that we will seek heteroclinic orbits with the strongest possible decay to the origin. We refer the interested reader to [23] for an in-depth discussion of pushed and pulled fronts and we note recent work on pushed and pulled fronts and the transition between them; see [2, 3].\nThe explicit construction of heteroclinic orbits for nonlinear ordinary differential equations is difficult. Most examples where pushed invasion speeds can be calculated involve scalar equations where explicit solutions can be obtained as in the classical Nagumo\u2019s equation; see [14]. For systems of reaction-diffusion equations the situation is more challenging still \u2013 the most promising avenue is when one or more parameters in the system are asymptotically small (or large). In these situations, singular perturbation theory (see [12, 20]) can be employed to construct solutions and wavespeed estimates are sometimes possible by analyzing a reduced planar system; see for example [15, 17, 18].\nAmong other results, the following estimate of the critical speed in the limit as \u03c1\u2192\u221e was obtained\nin [6].\nTheorem 1.1. [6] System (1.1) with \u03bd = 0 has traveling front solutions connecting the stable state (1, c\u0303 + \u03c1 \u2212 \u221a c\u03032 + \u03c12) to (0, 0) for any c\u0303 \u2265 c\u0303\u2217(\u03c1). These fronts are monotonic and for \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e the critical speed c\u0303\u2217(\u03c1) satisfies\n3\n\u221a 3\n2 \u2264 lim inf \u03c1\u2192\u221e\nc\u0303\u2217(\u03c1)\n\u03c11/3 \u2264 lim sup \u03c1\u2192\u221e\nc\u0303\u2217(\u03c1) \u03c11/3 \u2264 \u221a 3 (1.3)\nNumerical estimates of the critical speed were obtained in [6] using methods from [5] and suggest that the critical speed should scale like the lower bound in (1.3). The purpose of the current research is to refine the estimate in Theorem 1.1 and show that the critical speed does in fact scale\nwith 3 \u221a\n3\u03c1 2 as \u03c1\u2192\u221e.\nTo this end, we make the following changes of coordinates: \u03c1 = 1 \u03b53 , c = c\u0303/\u03b5, W = \u03b5U and X = \u03b5x. Then (1.2) is transformed to the following system of equations with small parameter \u03b5,\ndT dX = \u2212cT +WT + 1 2 W\u03b52(2c\u2212W ) dW dX = 1 W \u2212 c T (1\u2212 T ). (1.4)\nA general framework for proving the existence of traveling waves (i.e. heteroclinic orbits) in singularly perturbed systems is as follows; see for example [20]. One first sets the small parameter to zero and identifies a heteroclinic orbit in this singular limit. In the case of (1.2) this heteroclinic involves the intersection of two one dimensional manifolds. As such, the system is not structurally stable and the heteroclinic is not expected to persist when \u03b5 6= 0. However, if the system has a parameter (c in our case) then one can add the parameter as a variable to increase the dimension of the system and construct two dimensional center-stable and center-unstable manifolds. If these manifolds intersect transversely and depend smoothly on \u03b5 then the transverse intersection will persist for \u03b5 > 0 and the existence of a heteroclinic follows without having to delve into the particular manner in which \u03b5 appears in the equations.\nThe primary complication occurring in (1.4) is that the heteroclinic in the singular limit involves a connection to a non-hyperbolic fixed point. Thus, even the persistence of this fixed point when \u03b5 6= 0 is not apparent and it is not possible to define stable or unstable manifolds of this fixed point without explicitly considering \u03b5 dependent terms. To overcome this issue we will apply geometric desingularization techniques to blow-up the non-hyperbolic fixed point and regain hyperbolicity. We refer the reader to [10, 21] for a description of the method. Related to the problem of front propagation: blow-up has been used to compute correction to wavespeeds due to cutoff in reaction terms; see [11]. We also point to other examples where re-scalings of the dependent variables lead to a lack of hyperbolicity \u2013 see for example [7, 13, 16].\nThe main result of this paper is the following.\nTheorem 1.2. Let \u03bd = 0 in (1.1). Then there exists a \u03c10 > 0 such that for any \u03c1 > \u03c10 there exists a traveling front solution of (1.1) connecting the stable state (1, c\u0303 + \u03c1 \u2212 \u221a c\u03032 + \u03c12) to (0, 0) with speed c\u0303\u2217(\u03c1) such that\n(i) the front is monotone decreasing and has steep exponential decay in the sense that\n|(T \u2217(x), Q\u2217(x))| \u2264 Ce\u2212c\u0303\u2217(\u03c1)x/2 as x\u2192\u221e\n(ii) the speed c\u0303\u2217(\u03c1) satisfies lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e c\u0303\u2217(\u03c1) 3 \u221a \u03c1 = 3 \u221a 3 2\nThe rest of the paper is dedicated to proving this Theorem and is organized as follows. In Section 2 we change coordinates in the traveling wave equation (1.4) and collect some facts about this transformed system. In Section 3 we set \u03b5 = 0 and obtain a candidate traveling front. This front involves a heteroclinic orbit involving a non-hyperbolic fixed point. In Section 4 we apply geometric desingularization techniques to track invariant manifolds near this point. We conclude in Section 5 with the proof of Theorem 1.2."

(2.3)\nThe linearization at (1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) is \u2212(w\u2212(\u03b5)\u2212 c)2 \u2212(w\u2212(\u03b5)\u2212 c)h\u2032(w\u2212(\u03b5)) 1 0  .\nSince the trace is negative and the determinant is negative (note h\u2032(w\u2212(\u03b5)) > 0) we then see that the fixed point (1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) is a saddle with one stable and one unstable eigenvalue. Regrettably, both these eigenvalues are close to zero so that when \u03b5 = 0 the fixed point is no longer hyperbolic and its linearization is nilpotent. We emphasize that this lack of hyperbolicity can be traced to the fact that as \u03b5 \u2192 0 the fixed point at (1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) coalesces with the fixed point at (1, c) yielding a non-hyperbolic fixed point.\nNonetheless, for any 0 < \u03b5 1 the unstable manifold W u(1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) is well defined and can be written as a graph (T, hu(c, \u03b5, T )). Likewise, for c fixed and 0 < \u03b5 1 the origin has a one dimensional strong stable manifold W ss(0, 0) which can also be expressed as a graph (T, hs(c, \u03b5, T )). We then define the mismatch function\n\u03a6(c, \u03b5) = hs\n( c, \u03b5, 1\n2\n) \u2212 hu ( c, \u03b5, 1\n2\n) . (2.4)\nWe will establish the following result.\nTheorem 2.1. We have the following\n\u2022 The function \u03a6(c, \u03b5) is continuously differentiable in both c and \u03b5. \u2022 \u03a6 ( 3 \u221a 3 2 , 0 ) = 0\n\u2022 \u2202c\u03a6 ( 3 \u221a 3 2 , 0 ) 6= 0\nBy an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, Theorem 2.1 will then imply Theorem 1.2.\nRemark 2.2. Theorem 2.1 can also be interpreted as a statement about transversality of manifolds. If we append the trivial equation c\u2032 = 0 to (2.1) then there exist a two-dimensional center-strong stable manifold of the origin and a two dimensional center-unstable manifold for (1, w\u2212(\u03b5)). The condition (ii) in Theorem 2.1 then says that these manifolds intersect and condition (iii) implies that this intersection is transverse. Smooth dependence on \u03b5 then implies that this transverse intersection will persist for \u03b5 6= 0."

To prove Theorem 1.2 we need to show that the unstable manifold of (1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) is o(1) close to the heteroclinic orbit computed in Section 3. To do this we will use geometric desingularization to blow-up and then desingularize the flow near this fixed point.\nTo begin, we first transform the fixed point at (1, c) to the origin using\nW\u0303 = W \u2212 c, T\u0303 = T \u2212 1,\nfrom which we obtain the system of equations (appending an equation for the parameter \u03b5)\nT\u0303 \u2032 = \u2212W\u0303 2(T\u0303 + 1)\u2212 1 2 W\u0303\u03b52(c2 \u2212 W\u0303 2)\nW\u0303 \u2032 = T\u0303 (T\u0303 + 1)\n\u03b5\u2032 = 0. (4.1)\nThe linearization at the origin is nilpotent with Jacobian\nDf(0, 0, 0) =  0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0  . The goal of this section is to blow-up the non-hyperbolic origin in (4.1) to a sphere where \u2013 after desingularizing by a re-scaling of the independent variable \u2013 the flow in a neighborhood of the origin can be analyzed by studying the flow on the sphere. In the simplest case, blow-up techniques involve viewing (4.1) in spherical coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6) where after desingularizing one obtains nontrivial dynamics on the surface of the sphere (\u03c1 = 0). However, use of such coordinates for (4.1) reveals fixed points on the surface of the sphere which remain non-hyperbolic.\nWe therefore employ a quasi-homogeneous blow-up where different scalings are given to different variables; see [1, 10, 19, 21] for examples and a general discussion. The change of variables that we employ is defined as\n\u03c8 : S2 \u00d7 [0,\u221e)\u2192 R3, \u03c8 ( T\u0304 , W\u0304 , \u03b5\u0304, r ) = ( r3T\u0304 , r2W\u0304 , r\u03b5\u0304 ) ,\nwhere (T\u0304 , W\u0304 , \u03b5\u0304) \u2208 S2. We comment on the choice of weights. Since the fixed point w\u2212(\u03b5) depends quadratically on \u03b5 then it is natural that the weight for the W\u0303 component should be squared relative to the weight for \u03b5. The cubic scaling for the T\u0303 component can be determined as follows. Let T\u0303 = r\u03b1T\u0304 . Then the leading order terms on the right hand side of (4.1) scale with r4 for T\u0303 \u2032 equation and r\u03b1 for the W\u0303 \u2032 equation. Thus the scaling of the two equations match only if 4\u2212 \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2212 2 from which \u03b1 = 3 is determined.\nThe variables ( W\u0304 , T\u0304 , \u03b5\u0304 ) \u2208 S2 could be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates; however in practice it is easier to use various coordinate charts in which to view the dynamics. We will employ the following two charts for our analysis\nK\u03b5 : T\u0303 = r 3 1T1, W\u0303 = \u2212r21W1, \u03b5 = r1 KW : T\u0303 = r 3 2T2, W\u0303 = \u2212r22, \u03b5 = r2\u03b52,\nwhere we will assume r1,2 \u2265 0, W1 \u2265 0, T1,2 \u2264 0 and \u03b52 \u2265 0.\nTransition maps between the two charts are\nr2 = r1W 1/2 1 , T2 =\nT1\nW 3/2 1\n, \u03b52 = 1\nW 1/2 1\n(4.2)\nT1 = T2 \u03b532 , W1 = 1 \u03b522 , r1 = r2\u03b52.

(4.9)\nThis system has four fixed points: ( 0,\u00b1 \u221a\n2 3\n) and ( \u00b1 \u221a 2 c2 , 0 ) . Using (4.3) we see that the fixed\npoint (\u221a 2 c2 , 0 ) is equivalent to w\u2212(0) in the original coordinates and ( c2 2 , 0 ) in the chart K\u03b5. We make the following observations. First the \u03b52 = 0 subspace is invariant and the fixed point\n(0,\u2212 \u221a 2/3) is stable with eigenvalues \u22123 \u221a 2/3 and \u221212 \u221a 2/3 (note the 6 : 1 resonance). To analyze the transition map for (4.8) we divide the vector field by the (locally) positive factor 1 2(\u2212T2\u2212 r 3 2T 2 2 ) effectively introducing a new independent variable, \u03c3. We then shift the fixed point\nto the origin S2 = T2 + \u221a 2 3 after which (4.8) takes the form\ndr2 d\u03c3 = r2 d\u03b52 d\u03c3\n= \u2212\u03b52 dS2 d\u03c3 = \u22126S2 + F (r2, \u03b52, S2), (4.10)\nfor some locally smooth nonlinear function F (r2, \u03b52, S2). We now change coordinates. The unstable manifold of (0, 0,\u2212 \u221a\n2/3) is contained in the \u03b52 = 0 subspace and can be expressed as a graph over\nthe r2 axis which we denote by \u03c6(r2). Then the change of coordinates Q2 = S2 \u2212 \u03c6(r2) straightens the unstable manifold to coincide with the r2 axis. As a result (4.10) is transformed to\ndr2 d\u03c3 = r2 d\u03b52 d\u03c3\n= \u2212\u03b52 dQ2 d\u03c3 = \u22126Q2 +Q2G1(r2, Q2) + \u03b52G2(r2, \u03b52, Q2). (4.11)\nHere G1 and G2 are nonlinear functions that represent the nonlinearity after the change of coordinates. The function G1(0, 0) = 0 since it contains only nonlinear terms and G2(0, 0, 0) = 0 since the linear term \u03b52 is absent from (4.11).\nFor \u03ba > 0 define the sections \u03a3in and \u03a3out as\n\u03a3in = {(r2, \u03b52, S2) | \u03b52 = \u03ba}, \u03a3out = {(r2, \u03b52, S2) | r2 = \u03ba}.\nWe study the transition map \u03c0 : \u03a3in \u2192 \u03a3out.\nLemma 4.1. Consider initial conditions in \u03a3in with r2 = \u03b5\u0393(c, \u03b5, \u03ba) and S2 = \u2126(c, \u03b5, \u03ba) for some smooth functions \u0393 and \u2126. Then if \u03ba is sufficiently small it holds that\n\u03c0(\u03b5\u0393(c, \u03b5, \u03ba),\u2126(c, \u03b5, \u03ba)) = (\u03b5\u0393(c, \u03b5), \u03c6(r2) + \u03b5\u039e(c, \u03b5))\nfor some smooth function \u039e(c, \u03b5).\nRemark 4.2. The fixed point in (4.11) is hyperbolic and so we could linearize the system by a near-identity change of coordinates using Hartman-Grobman Theorem. Resonances between the eigenvalues limit the smoothness of the conjugacy mapping and, even still, the mere existence of a near-identity conjugacy is not sufficient to obtain the estimates that we desire.\nProof. Take the integral form of (4.11),\nQ2(\u03c3) = e \u22126\u03c3Q2(0) + \u222b \u03c3 0 e\u22126(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)Q2(\u03c4)G1 (\u03b5\u0393(c, \u03b5)e \u03c4 , Q2(\u03c4)) d\u03c4\n+ \u03ba \u222b \u03c3 0 e\u22126(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212\u03c4G2 ( \u03b5\u0393(c, \u03b5)e\u03c4 , \u03bae\u2212\u03c4 , Q2(\u03c4) ) d\u03c4.

Define \u03a8 : X \u2192 X as the right hand side of (4.12) and let X be the Banach Space\nX = C0([0, \u03c3\u2217],R), ||Q||X = sup 0<\u03c3<\u03c3\u2217 |e\u03c3Q(\u03c3)|.\nThen for any Q \u2208 X we have |e\u03c3\u03a8Q| \u2264 \u2223\u2223e\u22125\u03c3Q(0)\u2223\u2223+ \u222b \u03c3\n0 e\u22125(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)||Q||X |G1(\u03c4)|d\u03c4 (4.13)\n+ \u03ba \u222b \u03c3 0 e\u22125(\u03c3\u2212\u03c4)|G2(\u03c4)|d\u03c4.

We then have\n||\u03a8(Qa \u2212Qb)||X \u2264 C\u03ba||Qa \u2212Qb||X\nand \u03a8 is a contraction for \u03ba sufficiently small.\nNow consider the S2 coordinate of the transition map \u03c0. Since Q2 \u2208 X we have that\n|Q2(\u03c3\u2217)| \u2264 e\u2212\u03c3 \u2217 ||Q2||X\nand thus Q2(\u03c3 \u2217) = \u03b5\u039e(c, \u03b5) for some smooth function \u039e(c, \u03b5). Changing coordinates back to S2 we obtain the result.\n4.3 Tracking W u(1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) between charts\nWe now put together the analysis in the two charts above to track W u(1, w\u2212(\u03b5)). In the re-scaling chart K\u03b5 the equilibrium point (1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) is mapped to (for \u03b5 = 0 ) the fixed point ( 0, c 2\n2\n) . This\nfixed point is hyperbolic of saddle type and has a one-dimensional unstable manifold. The fixed point and its unstable manifold persist for \u03b5 > 0 and sufficiently small. Using the Hamiltonian function in chart K\u03b5 we find that the unstable manifold (when \u03b5 = 0) is expressed as the graph\nT1 = \u2212 \u221a 2\n3 W 31 \u2212\nc2 4 W 21 + 1 24 c6.\nBy smooth dependence on initial conditions and parameters we have that T1 = \u2212 \u221a 2\n3 W 31 \u2212\nc2\n4 W 21 +\n1\n24 c6 + \u03b5\u2206(W1, c, \u03b5),\nfor some function \u2206.\nWhen W1 = 1 \u03ba2 then\nT1 = \u2212 \u221a 2\n3\n1 \u03ba6 \u2212 c\n2\n4\n1\n\u03ba4 +\n1\n24 c6 + \u03b5\u2206\n( 1\n\u03ba2 , c, \u03b5\n) .\nTransforming to chart KW using (4.3) then we have \u03b52 = \u03ba, r2 = \u03b5\u03ba and T2 = \u2212 \u221a 2\n3 \u2212 c\n2\n4 \u03ba2 +\n1\n24 (\u03bac)6 + \u03b5\u03ba3\u2206\n( 1\n\u03ba2 , c, \u03b5\n) .\nThen\nS2 =\n\u221a 2 3 \u2212 \u221a 2 3 \u2212 c 2 4 \u03ba2 + 1 24 (\u03bac)6 + \u03b5\u03ba3\u2206 ( 1 \u03ba2 , c, \u03b5 ) ,\nand we observe that S2 = \u2126(c, \u03b5, \u03ba) with\n\u2126(c, \u03b5, \u03ba) =\n\u221a 1\n6\nc2\n4 \u03ba2 + \u03ba3\u03a0(\u03ba, c, \u03b5),\nfor some smooth function \u03a0.\nNow applying the transition map \u03c0 : \u03a3in \u2192 \u03a3out in Lemma 4.1 we can track W u(1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) to \u03a3out where it has the expansion\nr2 = \u03ba, T2 = \u2212 \u221a 2\n3 + \u03c6(\u03ba) + \u03b5\u039e(c, \u03b5), \u03b52 = \u03b5\u0393(c, \u03b5).\nRemark 4.3. In theory, all of the analysis required in this section could have been conducted solely in chart KW as both the relevant fixed points are visible in that chart. However, identifying the heteroclinic connecting the two fixed points is more straightforward in the re-scaling chart K\u03b5 and so we opt to utilize both charts here."

            "text": "In this section we prove Theorem 1.2 by verifying that the conditions of the Implicit Function Theorem outlined in Theorem 2.1 are satisfied.\nBy the analysis in the previous section we have that the unstable manifold of W u(1, w\u2212(\u03b5)) is well defined and its graph is O(\u03b5) close to (T, gu(c, T )). On the other hand, W ss(0, 0) is well defined and depends smoothly on c and \u03b5 and for any 0 < T < 1 is O(\u03b5) close to (T, gs(c, T )). Thus, recalling the definition of \u03a6(c, \u03b5) in (2.4) we have\n\u03a6(c, \u03b5) = gs\n( c, 1\n2\n) \u2212 gu ( c, 1\n2\n) + \u03b5R(c, \u03b5)\nwhere R(c, \u03b5) is smooth. When \u03b5 = 0 and c\u2217 = 3 \u221a\n3 2 then by the analysis presented in Section 3 we have that \u03a6(c \u2217, 0) = 0\nand furthermore by Lemma 3.1 we have that \u2202c\u03a6(c \u2217, 0) 6= 0.\nThus \u03a6(c, \u03b5) satisfies the three conditions set out in Theorem 2.1 necessary for an application of the Implicit Function Theorem. This gives the existence of a smooth function c\u2217(\u03b5) such that (1.1) with \u03bd = 0 has a traveling front solution with steep exponential decay that propagates with speed c = c\u2217(\u03b5) and for \u03c1 = 1 \u03b53 . Monotonicity of the front was previously established in [6]. The decay estimate in Theorem 1.2\nfollows since the front lies in W ss(0, 0). This decay rate is specified in (2.3) and after twice rescaling the independent variable \u2013 first to divide the right hand side of the differential equation by a factor of c\u2212W and second to re-scale the independent variable from X to x \u2013 then the estimate is obtained."
