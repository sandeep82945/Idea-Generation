    "abstractText": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is characterized by high variability and drug resistance. This has necessitated the development of antivirals with a new chemotype and therapy. We previously identified an artificial peptide with non-native protein sequence, AP3, with the potential to inhibit HIV-1 fusion through targeting hydrophobic grooves on the N-terminal heptad repeat trimer of viral glycoprotein gp41. Here, a small-molecule HIV-1 inhibitor targeting chemokine coreceptor CCR5 on the host cell was integrated into the AP3 peptide, producing a novel dual-target inhibitor with improved activity against multiple HIV-1 strains including those resistant to the currently used anti-HIV-1 drug enfuvirtide. Its superior antiviral potency in comparison with the respective pharmacophoric moieties is in consonance with the dual binding of viral gp41 and host factor CCR5. Therefore, our work provides a potent artificial peptide-based bifunctional HIV-1 entry inhibitor and highlights the multitarget-directed ligands approach in the development of novel therapeutic anti-HIV-1 agents.",

This requires the constant search for novel anti-HIV-1 drugs that affect different stages of the viral life cycle [2]. Up to now, more than 30 antiretroviral drugs have been licensed by the U.S. FDA for clinical use [3]. Among them, HIV-1 entry inhibitors acting on the virus\u2013cell fusion stage combat HIV-1 outside host cells to prevent the integration of the viral genome into the host genome, thus providing an efficient therapeutic or prevention strategy for blocking HIV-1 infection [4\u20136]. Entry of HIV-1 into target cells is mediated by its envelope glycoprotein (Env) surface subunit gp120 and transmembrane subunit gp41 [7,8]. After gp120 binding to the cellular CD4 receptor and coreceptor, either C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), the exposed N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions of gp41 form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) coiled-coil structure that brings viral and host cell membranes into close proximity, thus facilitating their fusion. However, during gp41-mediated HIV-1 infection, the NHR trimers become transiently exposed and\nViruses 2023, 15, 1038. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15051038 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nViruses 2023, 15, 1038 2 of 15\nthus accessible to fusion inhibitory peptides derived from the CHR (Figure 1A) [9\u201311]. T20 (brand name: Fuzeon; generic name: enfuvirtide) is currently the only U.S. FDA-approved HIV-1 fusion inhibitor [12,13]. However, the T20 peptide requires high dosages (90 mg twice a day) due to its relatively low efficacy and short in vivo half-life. Furthermore, T20 easily induces drug resistance that confounds treatment and has led to a growing number of patients for whom T20 is ineffective [11]. In addition, through direct competition to the NHR site, or by sequestering/binding T20 to form T20\u2013antibody complexes, the preexisting antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients could interfere with the natural peptide T20-mediated inhibition of membrane fusion [14]. These drawbacks call for new strategies in the development of next-generation peptide fusion inhibitors that are able to intercept the virus before it invades the target cells.\nViruses 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\nheptad repeat (CHR) regions of gp41 form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) coiled-coil structure that brings viral and host cell membranes into close proximity, thus facilitating their fusion.

These peptides mimic the secondary structural features of CHR motifs within the HIV-1 6-HB and act as antiviral agents that block viral fusion. Over the past decade, our group has developed a series of novel HIV-1 fusion inhibitors based on artificial peptide sequences. For instance, after systematic optimization of the universal heptad repeat sequence-based \u03b1-helical peptide 5HRu, the engineered AP2 showed significantly improved antiviral activity [15\u201318]. Based on the sequence of AP2, a more potent AP3 peptide, which inhibits the infection of divergent HIV-1 isolates including those resistant to T20, was designed by adopting an M-T hook strategy (Figure 1A) [19]. This promising hit prompted us to focus on the optimization of AP3 to develop an artificial \u03b1-helical peptide possessing even higher anti-HIV-1 activity. Very recently, we discovered a multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) strategy for designing bifunctional HIV-1 entry inhibitors able to simultaneously modulate multiple interdependent targets within the highly cooperative stages of HIV-1 entry [20]. A CCR5 antagonist-based HIV-1 entry inhibitor, TAK-220 (Figure 1B), was covalently linked to the carboxy terminus of a CHR-based peptide, C34, widely used as a fusion inhibitor design\nFigure 1.

A CCR5 antagonist-based HIV-1 entry inhibitor, TAK-220 (Figure 1B), was covalently linked to the carboxy terminus of a CHR-based peptide, C34, widely used as a fusion inhibitor design template [21]. Consequently, a dual-target molecule was identified, leading to a potent HIV-1 entry inhibitor with markedly improved antiviral potency when compared to either of the pharmacophores alone. Considering the above findings, we reasoned\nViruses 2023, 15, 1038 3 of 15\nthat the MTDLs concept could be applied to bifunctional artificial \u03b1-helical peptides with improved anti-HIV-1 efficacy. Accordingly, in this study, we utilized a small-molecule CCR5 antagonist to modify a de novo designed HIV-1-neutralizing peptide and observed a significant optimization (Figure 1C). Significantly, the resulting peptide AP3P4E had highly enhanced potency over that of the currently used T20 and could inhibit a variety of HIV-1 isolates. These results suggest that AP3P4E is an ideal candidate for further development in clinical use. Moreover, this multifunctional agent represents a promising advancement in the design of artificial anti-HIV-1 therapeutics."

To achieve the conjugation of small molecule to peptides, we added an Fmoc-Lys(Dde)OH to the C-terminus of each peptide. The C-terminus of the peptide taken from the synthesizer was aminated, providing the free amino group at the N-terminus. Acetylation was achieved using an acetic acid anhydride/DIEA mixture [1:1 (v/v)] (2 \u00d7 15 min). Then, the resin was treated with 2% (v/v) hydrazine hydrate/DMF (5 \u00d7 3 min) to remove the Dde protecting group. For the peptide-small molecule coupling reaction, a DMF solution of three equivalents of small molecules, three equivalents of HBTU, three equivalents of HOBt, and six equivalents of DIEA was added to the resin-bound peptide, and the mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at room temperature. The resin was then washed thoroughly with DMF and DCM in turn.

Potent Antiviral Activity of Artificially Designed Peptides against HIV-1 Strains We first tested the anti-HIV-1 activities of these dual-target ligands in comparison with AP3, TAK-220, and T20. As shown in Table 1, the initial hit compound AP3 inhibited the authentic HIV-1 Bal strain with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 0.75 nM. The CCR5 antagonist TAK-220 had an EC50 value of 23.8 nM. The hybrid molecule AP3W, consisting of TAKW joined to the C-terminus of AP3 without a linker, inhibited virus replication with an EC50 value of 6.33 nM, indicating an 8.4-fold decrease in potency relative to that of the parent AP3 moiety. However, AP3P4W, in which a 4-unit PEG linker is introduced between the peptide sequence and the CCR5 antagonist, could inhibit HIV-1 Bal infection similarly relative to AP3. Moreover, AP3P8W had activity similar to that of AP3P4W. It was found that the potency of inhibitors decreased upon further extension of the spacer length, as shown by the EC50 values of AP3P12W, AP3P16W, and AP3P24W. These results showed that linker length exerted considerable influence on the overall activity of the chimera compounds. On the basis of the structures of AP3P4W and AP3P8W, AP3P4E and AP3P8E were constructed by replacing the TAKW fragment with TAKE. Strikingly, the EC50 value of AP3P4E for inhibiting virus infection was 0.15 nM, which is 26-fold more potent than that of T20. In addition, this chimera exhibited antiviral potency much stronger than either of the pharmacophores alone or the unlinked 1:1 mixture of AP3 and TAK-220. These findings suggest that the covalent linkage of both compounds into one molecule is essential for enhanced activity. To assess cellular safety, we evaluated AP3P4E in a standard Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. It was found that compound AP3P4E showed no cytotoxicity at a concentration of 2000 nM on the CEMx174 5.25M7 cells that were used for the viral inhibition assay in our study (Figure S2). Besides the laboratory-adapted strain HIV-1 Bal, we also tested artificial AP3P4E against a panel of primary HIV-1 isolates with distinct genotypes and phenotypes. As shown in Table 2, it inhibited HIV-1 91US_4 (subtype B, R5) with an EC50 of 3.82 nM compared to 28.2 nM for T20.

            "text": "We first tested the anti-HIV-1 activities of these dual-target ligands in comparison with AP3, TAK-220, and T20. As shown in Table 1, the initial hit compound AP3 inhibited the authentic HIV-1 Bal strain with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 0.75 nM. The CCR5 antagonist TAK-220 had an EC50 value of 23.8 nM. The hybrid molecule AP3W, consisting of TAKW joined to the C-terminus of AP3 without a linker, inhibited virus replication with an EC50 value of 6.33 nM, indicating an 8.4-fold decrease in potency relative to that of the parent AP3 moiety. However, AP3P4W, in which a 4-unit PEG linker is introduced between the peptide sequence and the CCR5 antagonist, could inhibit HIV-1 Bal infection similarly relative to AP3. Moreover, AP3P8W had activity similar to that of AP3P4W. It was found that the potency of inhibitors decreased upon further extension of the spacer length, as shown by the EC50 values of AP3P12W, AP3P16W, and AP3P24W. These results showed that linker length exerted considerable influence on the overall activity of the chimera compounds. On the basis of the structures of AP3P4W and AP3P8W, AP3P4E and AP3P8E were constructed by replacing the TAKW fragment with TAKE. Strikingly, the EC50 value of AP3P4E for inhibiting virus infection was 0.15 nM, which is 26-fold more potent than that of T20. In addition, this chimera exhibited antiviral potency much stronger than either of the pharmacophores alone or the unlinked 1:1 mixture of AP3 and TAK-220. These findings suggest that the covalent linkage of both compounds into one molecule is essential for enhanced activity. To assess cellular safety, we evaluated AP3P4E in a standard Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. It was found that compound AP3P4E showed no cytotoxicity at a concentration of 2000 nM on the CEMx174 5.25M7 cells that were used for the viral inhibition assay in our study (Figure S2). Besides the laboratory-adapted strain HIV-1 Bal, we also tested artificial AP3P4E against a panel of primary HIV-1 isolates with distinct genotypes and phenotypes. As shown in Table 2, it inhibited HIV-1 91US_4 (subtype B, R5) with an EC50 of 3.82 nM compared to 28.2 nM for T20. AP3P4E also blocked infection by HIV-1 J32228M4 (subtype D, R5) with an EC50 of 8.86 nM compared to 59.0 nM for AP3 and 161 nM for TAK-220. Encouragingly, testing on clinical HIV-1 strain 89BZ167 (subtype B, X4) exhibited 3.7- and 15.6-fold improvement by AP3P4E over AP3 and T20, respectively.

The high antiviral activity of this chimeric inhibitor against both R5- and X4-tropic virus strains overcomes the major drawback of the parent CCR5 coreceptor antagonist. Lipid conjugation is a widely used strategy for improving the antiviral activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides. This is mainly achieved through increasing the effective fusion inhibitor concentration at viral entry sites on the target cell membrane surface and overcoming the diffusion-limited association rate for inhibitors with their gp41 target [30\u201334]. By modifying peptide fusion inhibitors with different lipids such as fatty acid and cholesterol, we and others identified a large panel of membrane-anchoring lipopeptides with enhanced antiviral activity. Very recently, we dedicated our efforts to developing a new multitarget design concept to create dual-function inhibitors that can hit both the CCR5 chemokine receptor located on the host cell membrane surface and HIV-1 Env gp41. Different to localizing inhibitors to cell membranes via lipid cargoes, we joined a small-molecule CCR5 antagonist to a fusion-inhibitory peptide, termed C34, by a flexible tether. This resulted in a strong efficacy profile caused by the synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 entry by the two drugs, and the resultant CP12TAK potently inhibited HIV-1 infection. Disappointingly, the poor biophysical properties of C34 (e.g., low aqueous solubility [11]) severely complicate its medicinal use, and, unexpectedly, the C34 peptide-based dual-target inhibitor CP12TAK suffered from adverse water solubility. Nonetheless, the data presented herein show that the addition of a CCR5 antagonist to the C-terminus of the artificial\nViruses 2023, 15, 1038 9 of 15\npeptide AP3 could markedly increase the antiviral activities of inhibitors, validating the general role of the multitarget-directed ligands concept in the design or optimization of new-generation HIV-1 entry inhibitors. Meanwhile, compared to CP12TAK, the much higher aqueous solubility of these multi-functional artificial peptide entry inhibitors make them suitable for further drug development (Table 3).\na The assay was performed in triplicate, and the data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. CEMx174 5.25 M7 cells expressing both CCR5 and CXCR4 on the surface were infected with the HIV-1 BaL strain (subtype B, R5). b For these peptides, the N-termini were acetylated, and the C-termini were amidated. c Molar ratio of AP3/TAK-220 in combination was 1:1.\na All assays were performed in triplicate, and data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. b CEMx 174 5.25 M7 cells expressing both CCR5 and CXCR4 on the surface were used in this study."

            "text": "T20 has a relatively low genetic barrier for the evolution of resistant viruses. The rapid emergence and spread of resistant HIV-1 isolates has caused an increasing number of patients who fail to respond to T20 treatment. One of the primary goals of creating a new generation of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors is to avoid cross-drug resistance with the currently used drug T20. As shown in Table 4, mutations in the NHR region of HIV-1 virus NL4-3 conferred a high level of resistance to T20. In contrast, T20-resistant variants still remained sensitive to this artificially designed peptide inhibitor. For example, the V38A/N42T double mutation resulted in a 941.4-fold resistance for T20, but it did not affect the inhibitory activity of AP3P4E. Similarly, the impact of N42T/N43K and V38E/N42S T20-resistant mutations was also absorbed by the chimeric entry inhibitor. Despite its efficacy against the\nViruses 2023, 15, 1038 10 of 15\nT20-resistant strains, one may question whether this multitargeted compound can induce drug-resistance. Previously, Chong et al. demonstrated that introducing an M-T hook motif into the N-terminus of a peptide HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (i.e., sifuvirtide), could significantly increase its genetic barrier to drug resistance [35]. Consistently, Xue et al. described a membrane-localizing, cholesterol-tagged HIV-1 fusion inhibitory peptide named LP-98, which failed to select resistant viruses either in vitro or in vivo [6]. These results indicate that the development of a bifunctional chimera through the covalent combination of two drugs with different target sites and mechanisms of action may be an effective way to overcome the rapid emergence of resistant virus mutations since co-evolution of both resistance pathways may affect viral fitness.\nV38A/N42T d 1045.0 \u00b1 48.6 (941.4) 1.13 \u00b1 0.13 (1.2) a The assay was performed in triplicate, and the data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation.

            "text": "First, we used a native PAGE (N-PAGE)-based method to evaluate the capacity of the bifunctional entry inhibitor AP3P4E to bind a synthetic peptide derived from the NHR segment of HIV-1 gp41, namely, N36. As shown in Figure 3A, the gp41 NHR target surrogate N36 peptide, artificially designed peptide AP3, and AP3P4E displayed specific bands at different positions in the gel depending on their net positive charges and molecular size. Both AP3 and AP3P4E bound to N36 in equimolar mixtures, as inferred from the appearance of new bands concomitant with the disappearance of AP3 and AP3P4E bands. Subsequently, the CD spectra and thermostability of the AP3P4E/N36 complex were analyzed. Isolated AP3 and AP3P4E exhibited a similar \u03b1-helical structure with a helical content of 86% and 83%, respectively. The N36 peptide was in the \u03b1-helical conformation with 32% helicity. Obviously, the \u03b1-helicity of an equimolar mixture of AP3P4E and N36 (91%) was much higher than that of the sum of the CD signals of these two single peptides (60%) (Figure 3B). The difference between the two spectra indicated that the interaction between AP3P4E and N36 resulted in the enhanced helical structures of the component peptides [36]. This is consistent with the results from the CD mixing experiment of the AP3/N36 pair (Figure 3C). In addition, data from the CD analysis indicated that both the AP3P4E/N36 and AP3/N36 complexes had undergone thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values of 68 \u25e6C (Figure 3D). These results suggest that the new chimeric molecule AP3P4E can function like its parent compound AP3 by binding to the gp41 N-trimer and blocking the formation of fusogenic gp41 6-HB. We previously reported that a 1:1 noncovalent mixture of C34 and TAK-220, which mimicked the molar ratio between the inhibitors in the CP12TAK chimera, showed an EC50 value of 0.58 nM, similar to that of T20 (EC50 = 1.58 nM). In the present study, we discovered that the mixture of AP3/TAK-220 at equimolar concentration also showed comparable activity with T20 (EC50: 8.02 nM vs. 4.02 nM). The AP3P4E could effectively inhibit HIV-1 strain Bal infection with an EC50 value of 0.15 nM, about 53-fold more potent than the 1:1 (mol/mol) noncovalent mixture of AP3/TAK-220, whereas CP12TAK showed about a 19-fold enhanced potency compared with that of the equimolar mixture of C34 with TAK-220. The circular-dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data showed that the AP3 peptide\nViruses 2023, 15, 1038 11 of 15\nformed a typical \u03b1-helical conformation, while C34 adapted a largely random coil structure in solution [20]. Therefore, one possible explanation of the less potency enhancement of the chimeric inhibitor CP12TAK than AP3P4E against the Bal strain is that the transient intramolecular interaction between peptide fusion inhibitor C34 and small-molecule CCR5 inhibitor TAK-220 may shield their target binding sites. In contrast, the rigid rod-like \u03b1-helix of AP3 could facilitate each pharmacophore in AP3P4E to bind to its respective target, thus causing a stronger synergistic anti-HIV-1 effect.\nViruses 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 15\nhelical content of 86% and 83%, respectively.

High Resistance of AP3P4E to Proteolytic Degradation Although the T20 peptide has potent anti-HIV-1 activity, it suffers from susceptibility to enzymatic degradation.

Therefore, it would be highly interesting to know whether the \u03b1-helical peptide AP3P4E is more resistant to proteolytic degradation than T20. To make this determination, degradation experiments were first performed over a time frame of 240 min by incubating AP3P4E or T20 with proteinase K (a broad-spectrum serine proteinase). As shown in Figure 5A, AP3P4E maintained 89.9% of the original amount in the proteinase K after a 4-h incubation.

Moreover, this study provides convincing data for our proposed concept that the MTDLs approach can serve as a viable strategy for designing novel HIV-1 entry inhibitors.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15051038/s1, Figure S1: Schematic representation of the strategy used for preparation of bifunctional molecules; Figure S2: The potential cytotoxicity of peptide AP3P4E; Table S1: HPLC method used for the purification of peptide compounds; Table S2: HPLC method used for the analysis of peptide compounds; MALDI-TOF-MS and analytical HPLC of designed peptides.\nAuthor Contributions: C.W., Y.L., L.L. and S.J. conceived, planned, and supervised the experiments.
