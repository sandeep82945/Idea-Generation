    "abstractText": "Background: Maternal substance use disorder (SUD) represents a risk condition for quality of parenting and child development. The current literature highlights the need to identify interventions that effectively enhance the quality of parenting and to better understand which mechanisms are involved in the process of change. The present study protocol describes a randomized wait\u2010list controlled trial that aims to examine (1) the efficacy of the Video\u2010feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP\u2010SD) in improving the quality of parenting (i.e., sensitive parenting and sensitive discipline) in mothers with SUD, (2) whether the intervention affects parental cognitive mechanisms (i.e., attentional disengagement to infant negative emotions, inhibitory control confronted with children\u2019s affective expression, and parental reflective functioning), and (3) whether changes in these processes act as mechanisms of change, mediating the effect of the VIPP\u2010SD program on quality of parenting. Moreover, the study aims (4) to explore whether the VIPP\u2010SD has an effect on parenting stress and (5) to compare mothers with SUD to low\u2010risk mothers on the outcome measures. Methods: The study will involve 40 mothers with SUD and 20 low\u2010risk mothers of children aged between 14 months and 6 years old. Mothers in the SUD group will be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the interven\u2010 tion (SUD experimental group) and one undergoing treatment as usual (SUD control group). All the mothers will be assessed pre\u2010test and post\u2010test. Quality of parenting will be assessed through observed parenting behaviors, whereas parental cognitive mechanisms will be assessed through neuropsychological tasks and self\u2010report measures. Discussion: The results of the study will reveal whether an intervention that has been proven effective in other at\u2010risk samples is also effective in improving parenting behaviors in the context of SUD. The results will also provide insight into potential cognitive mechanisms involved in the process of change. Trial registration: ISRCTN registry ISRCT N6307 0968. Registered on 25 June 2021.

Several authors point to the importance of implementing interventions that besides focusing on the condition of drug abuse or dependence per se also target parental functioning, given that recovery from the first is not necessarily associated to improvements in the latter [4\u20137]. Moreover, a wide array of studies show the relevance of SUD-related cognitive impairments, as for example deficits in attention, memory, decision-making, and problem solving [8\u201310], to better understand which mechanisms could mediate the effect of interventions [11, 12]. In this regard, much work has been done with respect to adults with SUD (e.g. [13]), but little is known about how such cognitive impairments relate to parenting and parenting interventions in adults with SUD [7].\nThe present study protocol describes a randomized wait-list controlled trial in which we aim to examine the efficacy of the Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD [14];) in improving the quality of parenting in mothers with SUD. Secondly, the study aims to investigate whether the intervention affects parental cognitive mechanisms, improving attentional disengagement to infant negative emotions, inhibitory control in front of children\u2019s affective expression, and maternal reflective functioning. Finally, the study aims to detect whether changes in parental cognitive mechanisms play a role in mediating the effect of the VIPP-SD program on the quality of parenting measured through observed parenting behaviors. To accomplish this, we will compare mothers with SUD receiving the intervention (SUD experimental group) to mothers with SUD undergoing treatment as usual (SUD control group). Secondly, we will compare mothers with SUD to low-risk mothers recruited from the general population, to see whether the intervention reduces expected differences between mothers with SUD and low-risk mothers. In the following paragraphs, rationale, objectives, hypotheses, and methods of the study are presented, followed by a discussion of the possible implications."

Maternal SUD jeopardizes the quality of parenting behaviors, affecting in multiple ways sensitive parenting [15, 17, 20] and parental sensitive discipline [21, 22], two facets of positive parenting associated to\nfavorable developmental outcomes in children [23, 24]. Compared to low-risk populations, mothers with SUD show less optimal sensitivity and responsiveness to children\u2019s emotional signals [25\u201329] and are more inclined to be hostile, directive, and interfering with their activities [30\u201334]. These negative parenting behaviors have been linked to unfavorable outcomes in offspring, as insecure and disorganized attachments [35], and a higher risk to be involved with child protective services [36]. Moreover, mothers with SUD are more inclined to adopt negative disciplinary strategies [37], ranging from the use of harsh discipline [38\u201340] to the adoption of laissez-faire, characterized by withdrawal and lack of limit-setting, and role reversal [41, 42]. These practices tend to be ineffective and are related to several undesired developmental outcomes in children, including internalizing and externalizing problems [43, 44]. Therefore, parenting behaviors constitute one of the main targets of parenting interventions in the condition of SUD [45, 46]. In the present study, we aim to test the efficacy of the VIPP-SD, a shortterm evidence-based parenting intervention based on attachment theory [17, 47] and social learning theory [48, 49], in improving positive parenting strategies in a clinical population of SUD mothers with young children. We will measure sensitive parenting and sensitive discipline using observational scales (the Emotional Availability Scales [50] and a scale for harsh discipline [51]) under various structured conditions (free-play and two compliance tasks), comparing mothers with SUD receiving the intervention to mothers with SUD undergoing treatment as usual (TAU) and to low-risk mothers. According to previous studies, we expect that (1) the quality of observed parenting behaviors in SUD mothers is higher after the intervention compared to the randomized control group receiving TAU and (2) mothers with SUD will, at pretest, show poorer parenting behaviors compared to the low-risk group."

            "text": "Attentional mechanisms: attentional bias to\u00a0child negative emotions Attentional processing of child stimuli provides one of the basic cognitive mechanisms for sensitive parenting. Human adults present a selective bias in the processing of infant faces, which is of potential evolutionary value [52, 53] since it facilitates a detailed screening of facial mimicry and increases the likelihood of appropriate responses [54]. It has been shown that mothers present a preferential attentional bias for child negative emotions, finding it more difficult to disengage their attention from visual stimuli displaying sadness or distress [55, 56]. This process is attenuated in the presence of psychopathology and high parenting stress [53, 57] and has proved to\nbe sensitive to treatment [54]. We hypothesize this same attentional mechanism to be disrupted in mothers with SUD, given the high incidence of parenting stress [58], psychopathology [59, 60], and the overlap between brain reward regions associated to substances and to infantrelated stimuli [61, 62]. This hypothesis is further supported by studies that provide evidence for disruptions in normative attentional processes in the context of substance dependence [63, 64].\nIn the current study, we aim to test whether attentional bias to child face in mothers with SUD, measured with a computerized neuropsychological task, is enhanced through the application of the VIPP-SD. According to previous studies, we expect that (1) attentional bias to child negative emotions in mothers with SUD increases after the intervention compared to the randomized control group receiving TAU and (2) at pre-test, mothers with SUD will show lower attentional bias to child negative emotions compared to the low-risk group.\nInhibitory mechanisms: inhibitory control when\u00a0exposed to\u00a0child emotions Inhibition of parenting negative strategies represents another basic cognitive mechanism of sensitive parenting [65]. At the cognitive level, the inhibition of non-optimal responses relies on inhibitory control, a \u201clower order\u201d component of executive functions responsible for the regulation of attention, thoughts, or behaviors, according to internal and external stimuli [66\u201369]. Chronic drug use is associated with severe frontal and prefrontal cognitive dysfunctions which result in the inability to inhibit dominant behavioral responses activated by craving, which lead to the search and assumption of drugs [70\u2013 72]. Impairments in prefrontal activity are responsible for the onset and maintenance of substance dependence [70\u201375] and have been found in mothers with SUD also when observing infants displaying different emotional expressions [62, 76].\nTraditionally, inhibitory control has been investigated through go/no-go paradigms, which involve the presentation of stimuli, alternating go conditions, where the individual has to respond to the displayed cue, and no-go conditions, where the individual has to inhibit their response [66, 77]. In the current study, we aim to test whether inhibitory control when exposed to child emotions in mothers with SUD, measured through a computerized emotional go/no-go task, improves after the administration of the VIPP-SD. We expect that (1) inhibitory control when exposed to child emotions in mothers with SUD will increase after the administration of the intervention compared to the randomized control group receiving TAU and (2) compared to the low-risk group,\nmothers with SUD at pre-test will show lower inhibitory control when exposed to child emotions."

This mechanism is associated with positive and negative parenting strategies [79, 81, 82] and with children\u2019s use of their mothers as secure base [83]. Mothers with SUD present difficulties in emotion regulation [84] as well as poor reflective functioning abilities, with the risk to develop negative, idealized, or fragile representations of their children and their parental role [46, 85, 86]. Postnatal levels of mentalizing abilities have been identified as predictors of clinical prognosis in the context of substance abuse [87], and reflective functioning represents an important target of parenting interventions within this clinical population [46, 87]. Improvements in reflective functioning in response to parenting interventions have been associated with increases in quality of observed parenting behaviors and with improvements in children\u2019s regulation [7, 85]. For the purposes of the present study, we will examine self-reported maternal reflective functioning pre- and post-intervention. We expect that (1) reflective functioning in mothers with SUD improves after the intervention compared to the randomized control group receiving TAU and (2) mothers with SUD at pre-test present lower reflective functioning abilities with respect to the low-risk group."

            "text": "Given the complexity of the SUD condition, especially in mothers, various domains of adult functioning will be included as control variables in the present study. A brief description and rationale for each one is reported below.\nParenting stress Mothers with SUD are more likely to experience high levels of stress in their caregiving role, much of which is dependent on the condition of substance addiction and related risk factors, such as health conditions and psychosocial difficulties [58, 62, 88, 89]. The reiteration of substance use in time decreases the salience of infant-related stimuli that become less rewarding for mothers and risk to be perceived as a source of additional stress rather than part of a mutually fulfilling system [62, 90]. High levels of parenting stress have been often linked with difficulties in providing high-quality parenting and are associated with hurdles in mother-child interactions, lack of parental warmth, and increases in harsh parenting [91]. For the purpose of this study, we will measure parental stress using the short\nform of the Parenting Stress Index [92] before and after the intervention, expecting a decrease in levels of stress after treatment.\nMaternal psychopathology Individuals with SUD present an increased risk for psychopathology and psychological maladjustment [93, 94], which has been linked to poor executive functioning [95] and to several adverse treatment outcomes, such as increased severity in individual maladjustment and early relapse to substance use [96]. The presence of psychopathological symptoms in mothers with SUD represents an additional risk factor for caregiving practices, exacerbating difficulties experienced during mother-child interactions and increasing the risk to adopt negative parenting strategies [97\u201399]. In the present study, we will control for the potential confounding role of maternal psychopathology when examining the efficacy of the VIPP-SD. Maternal psychopathological symptoms and psychological distress will be measured pre- and post-treatment and considered as a confounder.\nGeneral executive functioning Inhibitory control represents a \u201clower order\u201d component of executive functions and, together with working memory and cognitive flexibility [66, 100, 101], allows for the activity of \u201chigher order\u201d executive functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, and planning [66, 102, 103]. A wide array of research has highlighted that individuals with chronic and heavy substance abuse present with damages to executive functioning, which could act as predisposing, retention, and relapse factors for substance assumption [11\u201313, 104\u2013106]. Moreover, research on parenting found some associations between executive functions and parental practices [68, 69]. In the present study, we will control for the potential confounding role of general executive functioning to investigate the specific impact of VIPP-SD on parental inhibitory control when exposed to child emotions and to ascertain its role as a mechanism of change in parenting behaviors. Mothers\u2019 general executive functioning will be measured pre- and post-treatment and its residual score after taking into account its overlap with inhibitory control will be used as a potential confounder in statistical analyses."

The protocol has proven to be effective in different randomized controlled trials in various populations [108\u2013110], with a recent meta-analytic study reporting a\ncombined effect size of d = 0.47 [21], and its characteristics appear particularly suitable for mothers with SUD.\nSpecifically, the limited number of sessions, the focus on interactive behaviors, and the home-based nature of the protocol are likely to help maintain the mothers\u2019 engagement, limiting the risk of dropouts before the end of treatment [111\u2013113]. The ease of understanding of the contents supports comprehension of the intervention themes, preventing dropout risks linked to deficits in attention and cognitive functioning [11, 13]. The use of the video-feedback technique, the focus on child signals [45], and the provision of information on child development could help mothers to adapt their interaction to the child\u2019s age-appropriate level [114, 115]. These features support the feasibility of applying the intervention to this specific clinical population, offering the possibility to administer it both in the context of outpatient and inpatient conditions."

We will investigate whether the intervention affects the mothers\u2019 performances on (2a) an attentional bias reaction time paradigm aimed at measuring attentional bias to negative emotions and on (2b) a go/ no-go task involving child faces displaying different emotions aimed at measuring inhibitory control in response to child emotions, respectively. Moreover, we will investigate whether the intervention affects (2c) self-perceived reflective functioning. We expect that the intervention modifies the mothers\u2019 performances on the two tasks and self-reported reflective functioning in the SUD experimental group with respect to the SUD control group. 3) Our tertiary aim is to investigate whether changes in parental cognitive mechanisms affect intervention effect on parenting. Specifically, we will investigate whether changes in the mothers\u2019 (3a) attentional bias, (3b) inhibitory control, and (3c) reflective functioning account for changes observed in parenting. Specifically, we expect that improvements in the\nmothers\u2019 performances on the cognitive measures will be associated to improvements in the quality of observed parenting in the SUD experimental group (Fig.\u00a01). 4) Our fourth objective is to explore whether the administration of the intervention has an effect on parenting stress. Specifically, we expect that, after the administration of the VIPP-SD, perceived parenting stress in the SUD experimental group decreases compared to the SUD control group. 5) Our fifth objective is to compare the SUD experimental group and the SUD control group to the lowrisk group with respect to post-test measures."

History of SUD diagnosis is defined as severe substance use, abuse, or dependence, within 2 years preceding enrollment, with respect to one\nor more substances of interest (e.g., alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; tobacco; and other or unknown substances) according to criteria outlined by principal diagnostic manuals [2]. Studies on SUD identified a rate of dropout ranging from 23 to 50% in outpatient treatment [117, 118] and from 17 to 57% in inpatient treatment [119, 120]. In order to prevent attrition bias, and to reach the expected number of participants completing the trial, we will oversample participants in the SUD group by 20%. The low-risk group (n=20) includes mothers recruited from the general population. Mothers in the low-risk group should present the absence of history of SUD diagnosis and absence of history of treatment in residential and outpatient facilities that treat SUD and other psychiatric disturbances. We will screen them using a specific checklist administered at their enrollment. Inclusion criteria for each group foresee that mother and child live together or in close contact (at least 4 times per week) at the time of recruitment and during the various stages of the study. Exclusion criteria concern the presence of diagnosed psychotic disorders in an active phase, organic brain disorders that prevent the execution of the tasks, and child developmental pervasive disorders. Mothers in the SUD group will be contacted through the help of healthcare providers, whereas mothers in the low-risk group will be contacted through family centers, nursery schools, and academic database sources. Potential candidates will be invited to take part in the study and will receive more information and asked informed consent when they agree to participate. Participation in the study is free."

Blocked randomization enhances the chance that treatment groups are equal in size and uniformly distributed according to key outcome-related characteristics [121]. Randomization will be implemented charging three distinct figures of\nFig. 2 Diagram of participants\u2019 flow through the trial\nsequence generation, participant enrollment, and participant allocation [122]. Sequence generation will be carried out by an independent researcher through R [123], with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by gender and child age (younger vs older than 30 months). The researcher performing sequence generation will not be involved in recruitment, intervention administration, data collection, or data coding. To guarantee allocation concealment and to avoid selection bias, an independent researcher not involved in the trial will be charged to the custody of the sequences generated and to the assignment of the participants to each condition.

Power was set at the conventional level of 80%. Regarding the size of the expected treatment, recent meta-analytic work testing the effectiveness of VIPP-SD on sensitive parenting yielded a combined effect size of d = 0.47, indicating that the intervention significantly increases sensitive caregiving [21, 125]. For the purposes of the present study, a statistical power analysis was performed for sample size estimation (repeated measures ANOVA within-between interaction, G*Power 3.1.9.2). For our primary, secondary, and fourth aims, testing the effect of the intervention on parenting and on parental cognitive mechanisms through repeated measures analyses with \u03b1 = .05, a statistical power (1 \u2212 \u03b2) = 0.80, and a medium-sized effect of d = 0.47, a minimum sample size of n = 34 is required. For our third and fifth aims, testing mediating mechanisms, the proposed sample size ensures a power >80% since the power to detect mediating effects is generally larger than it is for main effects [126]. Considering the high risk of attrition in the SUD group, we will adopt oversampling strategies when managing missing data [127] and intention-to-treat analyses [128], in order to preserve statistical power."

The protocol is based on attachment theory [17,\n47] and on social learning theory [48, 49]. The intervention is manualized and delivered in 6 sessions, each one affording themes relevant for sensitive parenting and sensitive discipline. The manual describes the structure, the themes, and the exercises suggested to parents during the different sessions [21]. Each home visiting begins with the videotaping of structured parent-child interactions, which are then reviewed together with the intervener during the following sessions. Between sessions, the intervener prepares comments for each video fragment to-be-seen according to the themes that in each meeting are salient for sensitive parenting and sensitive discipline (see Table\u00a0 1). Themes for sensitive parenting concern the difference between exploration versus attachment behavior, the technique of speaking for the child, and the importance of sensitivity chains and of sharing emotions during parent-child interaction. Themes inherent sensitive discipline concern inductive discipline and distraction, positive reinforcement, sensitive time-outs, and empathy for the child [14, 21]. The first four sessions introduce these relevant topics whereas the two last sessions serve as booster sessions to revise and integrate the themes previously afforded and to reinforce new acquisitions in the parent [21]. The VIPP-SD has been applied to different settings [129\u2013131], including residential facilities [132], and has been successfully adopted with different clinical and at-risk groups [133\u2013135]. Previous meta-analytic work provided evidence for a substantial effect of VIPP-SD in enhancing positive parenting [21]. Treatment will be administered by a group of interveners officially trained and showing fidelity of treatment. Treatment fidelity will be guaranteed through continuous supervisions of the interveners with the fourth author, an official Italian trainer on the method."

A description of the measures adopted for each mechanism is provided in the following sections.\nMeasurement of attentional disengagement Maternal disengagement to infant negative emotions will be measured through an attentional bias reaction time paradigm [57]. During this attentional task, subjects are required to focus on a central go/no-go signal on the computer screen (a green or a red cross). A horizontal and a vertical line are presented as peripheral stimuli at the two extremities of the screen. The red central cross represents no-go trials, where participants are required to press the space bar. The green cross indicates go trials, where the individual is required to localize the position of the horizontal bar and press the appropriate keyboard response (A=left, L=right). During the task, distressed or nondistressed infant faces will appear behind the cross, as\nbackground images, slowing down the disengagement of attention. Each trial will begin with a fixation cross at the center of the screen (750 ms), followed by the stimulus display (240 ms, including the go/no-go signal, the face stimuli, and the two peripheral lines), and finally a blank screen until a response is registered. Participants are instructed to ignore pictures appearing in the task. An index of attentional bias towards distressed infant faces will be calculated, computing the difference between mean reaction times (ms) on distressed and non-distressed infant trials for each individual [55, 57]."

Visual stimuli are selected from the Child Affective Facial Expression set [136], a validated set of 2- to 8-year-old children\u2019s faces. During the emotional go/no-go task, the participants will be randomly presented with a child showing a positive or a negative emotion. Positive emotions represent go trials, where participants are required to press the space bar. Negative emotions indicate no-go trials, where individuals are required to inhibit their behavior, doing nothing. Each trial will begin with a fixation cross at the center of the screen (2000 ms), followed by the stimulus presentation (500 ms), and a blank screen with a fixation point (1500 ms) for response registration. Each of the 60 faces will be shown once, for a total of 60 trials. Reaction times and accuracy of the performance will be recorded and yield a measure of the mothers\u2019 inhibitory control when exposed to children\u2019s affective expressions.\nGiven previous studies reporting correlations between selective attention and inhibition of action in normative [137] and addicted individuals [63, 138], a preliminary correlational analysis will be carried out on performance on the two cognitive tasks. When the two measures are correlated, a composite score will be calculated [139, 140]. When not, performances at the two tasks will be considered as separate variables in statistical analyses.\nMeasurement of maternal reflective functioning Maternal reflective functioning will be assessed using the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire [141], an 18-item self-report measure aimed at investing perceived reflective functioning in parents, intended as curiosity about the child\u2019s mental states, effort/refusal to understand mental states, and how they relate to behavior.\nRetrieved from Juffer et\u00a0al.

Part of the clinical and research expertise in the context of parental SUD has been developed through a long-time partnership with Casa Aurora, Comunit\u00e0 di Venezia scs, a residential facility located in northern Italy that provides treatment to mothers with SUD and other psychiatric disorders. The continuous communication with the staff of the facility and with the patients in treatment guided the setting of the research objectives and the intervention goals, so that they would be relevant for both users and health services. Specifically, in line with professionals\u2019 suggestions, we attempted to design a protocol that could be easy to understand for professionals with different backgrounds (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and professional educators) and flexible enough to be introduced both in residential facilities and outpatient services, considering variation in organizational dynamics. Furthermore, in response to several mothers\u2019 complaints about difficulties in playing and engaging with their children, or in setting age-appropriate limits, we made the choice for the VIPP-SD program (whose goals are in line with the mothers\u2019 requests). In this sense, during the development of the protocol, we attempted to integrate scientific requests with services and users\u2019 perspectives, to ensure that the research would be appropriate for patients\u2019 and facilities\u2019 needs while still being valid and robust from a scientific point of view [158].

Moreover, the current study aims to test whether changes in cognitive mechanisms account for changes in observed quality of parenting. Testing these hypotheses has a significant impact both from a clinical and an empirical point of view.\nClinically, testing an intervention which is brief, standardized, and effective in improving the quality of parenting and of parent-child relationships could provide an important addition to programs that target parents with SUD. This intervention could be adopted in facilities and by healthcare providers parallel to interventions aimed at reducing substance abuse and parental psychopathology. The specific features of the VIPP-SD (e.g., the focus on positive aspects and on the strengths of parent-child relationships) are expected to support the development of early working alliance with health facility and professionals, which has been pointed out as a consistent predictor of engagement and retention in drug treatment [159]. Moreover, the adoption of such an intervention could sensitize healthcare providers and social workers to the importance of promoting sensitive parenting behavior, which is not only focused on instrumental care and satisfaction of basic needs, but also emotionally attuned to the child\u2019s communications.\nFrom an empirical perspective, the present study could provide further knowledge of the mechanisms underlying observable parenting and important insights into the cognitive mechanisms that could mediate the behavioral effect of interventions.\nStrengths of the study are represented by the adoption of a randomized controlled trial design, the collection of behavioral measures (observed parenting behaviors and cognitive tasks), and the use of an evidence-based intervention that has proven effective in previous RCTs in various at-risk samples. Novelty of the study is also the focus on a specific clinical sample, for which the intervention has not been tested yet.\nLimitations of the protocol are linked to the use of selfreport measures for parenting stress, reflective functioning, and psychopathology and to the heterogeneity of the sample (due to the condition of poli-abuse of substances)."
