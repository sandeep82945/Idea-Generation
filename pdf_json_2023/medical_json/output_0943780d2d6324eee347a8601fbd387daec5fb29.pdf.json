    "abstractText": "Lung metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the M2-like phenotype with potent immunosuppressive activity, and play a pro-tumor role in TNBC lung metastasis. Sohlh2 belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family. However, its role in macrophages polarization remains unknown, especially in TNBC progression. Here we demonstrated that Sohlh2 overexpression promoted M2 macrophage polarization. Moreover, high expression of Sohlh2 in M2-like macrophage enhanced TNBC cell growth, migration and lung metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we revealed that Sohlh2 functioned through up-regulating LXR\u03b1, ABCA1, ABCG1 expression and disturbing the lipid homeostasis on the membrane of macrophages. Sohlh2 could directly bind to the promoter of LXR\u03b1 and promote its transcription activity. E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 promoted Sohlh2 ubiquitination and degradation, and suppressed M2 macrophage polarization and TNBC progression. Collectively, our findings suggested that Sohlh2 in macrophage could be a novel therapeutic target for TNBC metastatic treatment.",

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the M2-like phenotype with potent immunosuppressive activity, and play a pro-tumor role in TNBC lung metastasis. Sohlh2 belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family. However, its role in macrophages polarization remains unknown, especially in TNBC progression. Here we demonstrated that Sohlh2 overexpression promoted M2 macrophage polarization. Moreover, high expression of Sohlh2 in M2-like macrophage enhanced TNBC cell growth, migration and lung metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we revealed that Sohlh2 functioned through up-regulating LXR\u03b1, ABCA1, ABCG1 expression and disturbing the lipid homeostasis on the membrane of macrophages. Sohlh2 could directly bind to the promoter of LXR\u03b1 and promote its transcription activity. E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 promoted Sohlh2 ubiquitination and degradation, and suppressed M2 macrophage polarization and TNBC progression. Collectively, our findings suggested that Sohlh2 in macrophage could be a novel therapeutic target for TNBC metastatic treatment.\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:850 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-06383-x"

            "text": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), also known as estrogen receptor-negative (ER-), progesterone receptor-negative (PR-), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, accounts for 15~20% of newly diagnosed breast cancers [1, 2]. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is characterized by its high histological grade, and early distant metastasis. Due to its aggressive clinical features and the lack of effective therapeutic targets, TNBC has a poor prognosis. Although some new methods have been recently tried to treat TNBC, they are not very effective[3, 4]. Thus, addressing novel molecular mechanism driving TNBC progression and metastasis is urgently needed [5, 6]. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can be polarized into two different states, either antitumor M1 macrophages that express inflammatory factor, such as TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and chemokines, such as CXCL10, or protumor M2 macrophages that synthesize and release anti-inflammatory cytokines, immunosuppressive factors, and various cytokines such as IL-10, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA. These factors promote tumor angiogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling, which in turn promote tumor cell migration, invasion and distant metastasis [7\u201310]. Recent studies implicate that macrophage functions are influenced by cellular metabolism, including lipid metabolism[11, 12]. Macrophage cholesterol metabolism is closely associated with TAM\npolarization [13, 14]. The liver X receptor alpha (LXR\u03b1), a key regulator of cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose metabolism, belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and is highly expressed in the liver, intestine, adipose tissue, and macrophages [15\u201317]. Upon ligand activation, LXR\u03b1 forms a heterodimer with the vitamin X receptor (RXR) and regulates the expression of target genes containing LXR response elements [11]. LXR regulates reverse cholesterol transport by controlling the expression of cholesterol transporters and apolipoproteins, such as ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), apoE, and apoC [18\u201320]. Macrophages highly express ABCA1 and ABCG1 to promote intracellular cholesterol efflux and maintain lipid homeostasis at the cell membrane [21, 22]. The deficiency of ABC transporters could hinder membrane cholesterol efflux in macrophages and inhibit tumor progression and metastasis [23, 24]. Sohlh2 belongs to the superfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factors [25]. Preliminary results showed that Sohlh2 was expressed in macrophages, and affected the polarization of macrophages. The underlying mechanism of Sohlh2 in macrophage polarization requires further exploration. Here in this study, we utilized co-culture of macrophages and TNBC cells, macrophage-specific Sohlh2 conditional knock-in mice to identify the important role of Sohlh2 in macrophages polarization and progression of TNBC cells in vivo and in vitro.\nReceived: 28 August 2023 Revised: 1 December 2023 Accepted: 6 December 2023\n1Key Laboratory of The Ministry of Education for Experimental Teratology, Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China. 2Department of Human Anatomy and Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan, Shandong, China. \u2709email: sunjinhao@sdu.edu.cn; haojing@sdu.edu.cn Edited by Professor Anastasis Stephanou\nwww.nature.com/cddis\nOfficial journal of CDDpress\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\nSohlh2 promoted the M2-type polarization of macrophages by regulating macrophage cholesterol efflux via the activation of LXR\u03b1/ABCA1, ABCG1 signaling pathway, and then induced the metastasis of TNBC cells. TRIM21 mediated the ubiquitination modification and degradation of Sohlh2 protein, and suppressed macrophage M2 polarization and TNBC progression. This may be a novel mechanism by which TRIM21 reverses the M2 type polarization of macrophages caused by Sohlh2/LXR\u03b1 signaling pathway and subsequently prevents TNBC progression.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and cell culture Human and mouse triple-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and 4T1.2, human and mouse monocyte cell lines THP-1 and RAW264.7, and HEK 293 T were purchased from the Cell Banks of Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and were cultured in PRMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 100U/ml Penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells were differentiated to a macrophage-like state by incubating with 20 nM PMA (APExbio) overnight, then M0 macrophages were polarized into M1 macrophages using LPS (20 ng/ml) (Sigma, USA) plus IFN\u03b3 (20 ng/mL) (Peprotech, USA), into M2 macrophages using IL-4 (20 ng/ml) (Peprotech, USA) for 48 h. The cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and tested free of mycoplasma."

The mRNA expression levels of M1 macrophage-associated genes, including TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and iNOS were significantly downregulated in Sohlh2 overexpression macrophage (Fig. 1C, D). The mRNA expression levels of M2 macrophage-associated genes, including IL-10, TGF\u03b2, CD163, CD206, Arg1, Fizz1, YM1 were significantly upregulated in Sohlh2 overexpression macrophage (Fig. 1E). Further, We found the secretion of TNF\u03b1 was significantly reduced in Sohlh2 overexpression macrophage treated with LPS plus IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 1F). However, the secretion of IL-10 was increased in Sohlh2 overexpression macrophage treated with IL-4 (Fig. 1G). As shown in Fig. S1, Sohlh2 knockdown in THP-1 and RAW264.7 induced M1 macrophage-associated gene expression and TNF\u03b1 secretion, whereas reduced M2 macrophage-associated gene expression and IL-10 secretion. Taken together, Sohlh2 polarized macrophage to M2 phenotype.\nSohlh2 in M2 macrophage promotes the oncogenic properties of TNBC cells in vitro To evaluate whether macrophage polarization is responsible for promoting the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells, we\nco-cultured macrophages with MDA-MB-231 or 4T1.2 cells using Transwell chambers (Fig. 2A). The CCK8 and EdU assays showed that Sohlh2 overexpression in M2 macrophage enhanced MDA-MB-231 and 4T1.2 cell growth capabilities, while silencing of Sohlh2 inhibited the proliferation of TNBC cells (Fig. 2B, C). Moreover, Sohlh2 overexpression in M2 macrophage caused a notable increase in migrated and invaded MDA-MB-231 or 4T1.2 cells, as expected, compared with the siCon group, the number of migrated and invaded MDA-MB-231 or 4T1.2 cells was significantly decreased when silencing Sohlh2 in M2 macrophage (Fig. 2D, E). We also found Sohlh2 overexpression in M2 macrophage increased the expression of mesenchymal markers, while inhibited the expression of epithelial markers in TNBC cells (Fig. 2F). However, knockdown Sohlh2 had the opposite results (Fig. 2F).These results indicate that Sohlh2 in M2 macrophage promotes the oncogenic properties of TNBC cells.\nSohlh2 in M2 macrophage accelerates TNBC progression in vivo To further assess the effects of Sohlh2 in M2 macrophage on tumor growth and metastasis, 4T1.2 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into female Sohlh2 KI and Con mice (Fig. 3A). The tumor growth of Sohlh2 KI xenografts was markedly promoted as demonstrated by the increased volume (Fig. 3B\u2013D) and weight (Fig. 3E) compared with the Con group. We observed a strong increase of lung metastasis in Sohlh2 KI mice (Fig. 3F, G). IHC assay showed overexpression of Sohlh2 led to significant increase of the Ki67 positive cells in xenografts (Fig. 3H, I). Interestingly, we found that macrophagespecific Sohlh2 KI led to more CD163 positive TAMs in xenografts and less expression of iNOS in macrophages (Fig. 3J, K). Taking together, these findings suggest that Sohlh2 in M2 macrophage accelerates TNBC progression in vivo.\nSohlh2 activates LXR\u03b1/ABCA1, ABCG1 signaling pathway and increases lipid efflux in macrophage Macrophage membrane cholesterol metabolism plays an important role in the progression of tumor. To exploit the effect of Sohlh2 on cholesterol metabolism in M2 macrophage, mass spectrometry was performed to investigate the differential gene expression in BMDMs from Sohlh2 KI and Con mice (Fig. 4A). Top 11 upregulated genes and their interactions in Sohlh2 KI BMDMs were shown in Fig. 4B, in which LXR\u03b1 was the highest upregulated gene(Fig. S2A). qPCR and Western blot results confirmed that Sohlh2 expression in BMDMs was higher in Sohlh2 KI mice compared to Con mice (Figs. S2B, 4C). The results of filipin staining showed overexpression of Sohlh2 decreased cholesterol deposits, while Sohlh2-knockdown increased the cholesterol deposits (Fig. 4D, E). Moreover, we found that Sohlh2 overexpression increases the expression of LXR\u03b1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 in macrophages, while silencing of Sohlh2 inhibited the expression of LXR\u03b1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 (Fig. 4F\u2013H). These results indicate that Sohlh2 plays a critical role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, by activating LXR\u03b1/ABCA1, ABCG1 signaling pathway in macrophages.\nLXR\u03b1 mediates the effects of Sohlh2 on M2 macrophage polarization and oncogenic properties of TNBC cells To further elucidate how Sohlh2 regulated LXR\u03b1 transcription, ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were performed. According to the data of JASPAR (A database of transcription factor binding), LXR\u03b1 promoter carries one predicted Sohlh2 DNA binding site, Sohlh2 overexpression increased the luciferase activity driven by the LucLXR\u03b1 promoter construct, whereas mutating the binding site hardly altered the luciferase activity (Fig. 5A, B). ChIP assay was performed to confirm that Sohlh2 could directly bind to the promoter region of LXR\u03b1 (Fig. 5C). To further investigate whether LXR\u03b1 mediates the effects of Sohlh2 on macrophages, we generated THP-1 Sohlh2 overexpression or knockdown cells stably expressing siLXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b1, respectively. qPCR and Elisa assays showed that knockdown of LXR\u03b1 significantly suppressed M2 macrophage polarization, while overexpression of LXR\u03b1 promoted the expression of genes related to\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:850\nM2 macrophage, compared to the respective controls (Fig. 5D, E). As expected, LXR\u03b1 knockdown in macrophages reversed the growth and invasion abilities enhanced by Sohlh2 (Fig. 5F, K). Similarly, LXR\u03b1 restoration in macrophages rescued TNBC cell growth and invasion abilities reduced by Sohlh2 silencing (Fig. 5F, K). In addition, knockdown of LXR\u03b1 attenuated the upregulation of the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 caused by Sohlh2 overexpression in THP-1 cells (Fig. 5L). Collectively, these data indicated that Sohlh2 promoted M2 macrophage polarization and TNBC progression via LXR\u03b1-dependent manner.\nTRIM21 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of Sohlh2 The process of ubiquitination and degradation of the proteins is involved in protein stability. Immunoblots showed that proteasome\ndegradation of Sohlh2 was blocked by the specific proteasome inhibitor (MG132) treatment (Fig. 6A). Then, we performed mass spectrometry and Co-IP assay to examine the partners of Sohlh2 protein. The results showed that Sohlh2 interacted with ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM21(Fig. 6B\u2013E). The interaction of Sohlh2 and TRIM21 was confirmed by immunofluorescent co-localization analysis (Fig. 6F). Thus, we examined the mRNA and protein stability of Sohlh2 in TRIM21 over-expressing cells and found that TRIM21 significantly reduced the protein levels of Sohlh2, but little affected its mRNA levels (Fig. 6G, H). Moreover, the degradation of Sohlh2 protein was significantly accelerated by TRIM21 in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor (CHX) (Fig. 6I), suggesting that TRIM21 may mediate Sohlh2 protein ubiquitination and degradation. Ubiquitination assays showed that TRIM21 expression increased Sohlh2 ubiquitination levels in the presence of MG132, while knockdown\nFig. 1 Sohlh2 is associated with M2 macrophage polarization.

These data indicate that TRIM21 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Sohlh2.\nTRIM21 suppresses M2 macrophage polarization and oncogenic properties of TNBC cells partly through a Sohlh2dependent manner To investigate whether TRIM21 affect the biological function of Sohlh2 in M2 macrophage, qPCR and Elisa analysis were performed to illuminate that the expression of genes related to M2 macrophage was significantly decreased in TRIM21 and Sohlh2-overexpressing macrophages (Fig. 7A, B). Furthermore, TNBC cell proliferation and invasion properties were\nsignificantly restrained when cocultured with TRIM21 and Sohlh2-overexpressing macrophages (Fig. 7C\u2013H). In addition, the protein levels of LXR\u03b1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 were repressed in TRIM21 and Sohlh2-overexpressing macrophages (Fig. 7I, J). Collectively, these results indicate that TRIM21 suppresses M2 macrophage polarization and growth, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells partly through a Sohlh2-mediated way.\nSohlh2 is correlated with the expression of CD163 and LXR\u03b1 in TNBC-associated macrophages To evaluate the role of Sohlh2 in TAMs of TNBC, the relevance of Sohlh2, CD163 and LXR\u03b1 expression was further investigated in human TNBC tissues. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:850\nFig. 5 LXR\u03b1mediates the effects of Sohlh2 on M2 macrophage polarization and oncogenic properties of TNBC cells.

A positive correlation between CD163, Sohlh2 and LXR\u03b1 was observed in TAMs (Fig. 8A, B). A schematic model showed the role of the TRIM21/Sohlh2/LXR\u03b1 signaling in the regulation of M2 macrophage polarization and progression of\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:850\nTNBC (Fig. 8C). Collectively, these results suggest that the regulation of macrophage M2 polarization and TNBC progression is mediated by TRIM21/Sohlh2/LXR\u03b1 signaling pathway."

            "text": "Tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized to play a critical role in tumor development and metastasis. Within the tumor stroma, a significant entity known as TAMs has captured increased attention in breast cancer treatment [26, 27]. TAMs hold the distinction of being the most abundant immune cells within the TME, serving as key constituents of inflammatory circuits that propel the progression and metastasis of tumors [28, 29]. Recent studies have focused on better understanding and possibly\ntargeting the microenvironment in which tumors develop and metastasis [30, 31]. Notably, lung metastasis stands as a formidable culprit behind the mortality experienced by patients with TNBC [32, 33]. In the present study, we demonstrated that Sohlh2 was highly expressed in M2 macrophages. Importantly, we identified Sohlh2 promoted the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. In an orthotopic xenograft model of TNBC, we revealed a metastasis-promoting function for macrophagespecific Sohlh2 KI mice in vivo, which was mediated in part by convening Sohlh2-dependent M2 polarization of macrophages in the primary tumor. Our findings provided evidence that Sohlh2 in TAMs may serve as a promising therapeutic target for treatment lung metastasis in TNBC.\nFig. 7 TRIM21 suppresses M2 macrophage polarization and oncogenic properties of TNBC cells partly through a Sohlh2-dependent manner. A, B qPCR and Elisa analysis of the expression of M2 macrophage\u2013related markers in Sohlh2-overexpressing THP-1 cells with ectopic TRIM21. C\u2013E The MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with Sohlh2 overexpression THP-1 cells stably expressing TRIM21. The growth ability was measured by EdU assay. F\u2013H Migration and invasion ability of the MDA-MB-231 cells was detected by Transwell assays. I, J Western blot assay showed the expression of LXR\u03b1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 in Sohlh2 overexpression M2 macrophages stably expressing TRIM21. Scale bar indicates 50 \u03bcm. The values indicate the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:850\nIt has been documented that cholesterol metabolism exerts influence on the induction of inflammatory responses in macrophages [11, 34]. In IL-4-stimulated macrophage, an intriguing protein known as FAMIN facilitates a connection between de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), creating an apparent \u201csubstrate cycle\u201d that potentially enhances oxidative metabolic flux to support bioenergetics [11]. The activation of the cholesterol efflux pathway by LXRs is pivotal in safeguarding cells against lipid overload [16, 35, 36]. LXRs serve as cholesterol sensors in macrophages, holding significant importance in maintaining the scavenging function of these cells. Additionally, LXRs regulate macrophage inflammatory responses, repressing the expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 [37, 38]. LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2, members of the nuclear receptor family, play a critical role in regulating cholesterol\nhomeostasis [15, 16]. Comparatively, our findings indicate that Sohlh2 exerts a more substantial regulatory influence on LXR\u03b1 as opposed to LXR\u03b2 (Fig. S2C). Interestingly, we also found deficiency in LXR\u03b1 could reverse the promotion of Sohlh2 on TNBC cell migration and invasion when co-cultured with macrophages. These results suggest a mechanism in which Sohlh2 functions as a factor promoting M2 polarization, increasing TNBC lung metastasis through the upregulation of LXR\u03b1 in macrophages. LXR\u03b1 plays a critical role in regulating the reverse cholesterol transport process through its control over the expression of key cholesterol transporters and apolipoproteins, including ABCA1, ABCG1, apoE, and apoC [11, 19, 39]. Sohlh2 concurrently orchestrated the expression of LXR\u03b1, ABCA1, and ABCG1. Furthermore, this orchestration disrupted the lipid homeostasis on the macrophage membrane. Moreover, ChIP and dual luciferase assays provided\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:850\ncompelling evidence of direct binding between Sohlh2 and the promoter region of LXR\u03b1, thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity. Notably, we identified a specific DNA binding site for Sohlh2, represented by an E box sequence, within the LXR\u03b1 promoter region. Introduction of single-site mutations in this sequence resulted in a substantial reduction in promoter activity compared to the wild-type control. These findings establish LXR\u03b1 as a direct target of Sohlh2, mediating the effects of Sohlh2 on macrophage polarization and lung metastasis. The process of ubiquitination-deubiquitination of proteins is a key contributor in regulating protein localization, stability, activity, and interaction with other proteins [40, 41]. Extensive evidence supports the notion that E3 ligases serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, depending on the substrate function [42\u201345]. While our study did not reveal a significant upregulation of Sohlh2 at the mRNA level upon TRIM21 overexpression, it is plausible that TRIM21 regulates Sohlh2 through post-translational modifications. Intriguingly, TNBC cells overexpressing TRIM21 treated with CHX, were observed a significant acceleration in the degradation of Sohlh2 protein mediated by TRIM21. It was identified that TRIM21 may attenuate the stability of Sohlh2 protein. We found that there was an interaction of Sohlh2 and TRIM21, and overexpression of TRIM21 significantly increased the ubiquitination of Sohlh2. Moreover, TRIM21 overexpression in macrophages suppressed macrophage polarization towards an M2-like phenotype, TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by forced expression of Sohlh2. These findings suggest that TRIM21 functions as a tumor suppressor by attenuating Sohlh2 protein levels, thereby inhibiting M2 macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our study identified Sohlh2 as a specific regulator of M2 macrophage polarization, exerting its effects through the transcriptional regulation of LXR\u03b1. Sohlh2/LXR\u03b1 signaling pathway enhanced lipid efflux from macrophages and disrupted the lipid balance in the cellular membrane, which was involved in macrophage M2 polarization. Sohlh2 overexpression effectively accelerated macrophage-mediated TNBC cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TRIM21 not only elevated the ubiquitination and degradation of Sohlh2, but also altered the impact of Sohlh2 on macrophage polarization. Our work unveils the role of TRIM21/Sohlh2/LXR\u03b1 signaling pathway in regulating macrophage M2 polarization and TNBC progression, suggesting its potential relevance to clinical conditions associated with M2 macrophage polarization."
