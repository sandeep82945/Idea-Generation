Cross-Protection Studies Across Different PPRV Lineages: Given the genetic diversity of PPRV with four different lineages, future research could focus on evaluating the cross-protection efficacy of currently available live-attenuated vaccine strains across these lineages. This would involve vaccinating different breeds of goats and sheep with a single lineage vaccine and then challenging them with viruses from the other lineages to assess the breadth of immune protection.

Long-term Immunity and Booster Vaccination Strategy: Research could investigate the duration of immunity conferred by the live-attenuated vaccines beyond the three-year mark. This could include studying the necessity and timing for booster vaccinations to maintain herd immunity, especially in endemic regions. Such studies could help refine vaccination schedules to ensure long-lasting protection against PPR.

Vaccine Efficacy in Different Breeds and Environmental Conditions: Exploring the efficacy of the live-attenuated PPRV vaccines in various breeds of goats and sheep across different environmental conditions would provide valuable insights into how these factors influence vaccine performance. This could lead to the development of more tailored vaccination strategies that consider the specific needs of different breeds and regions.

Role of Non-structural Proteins in Immune Evasion and Vaccine Development: Since PPRV encodes two non-structural proteins—C and V—that are involved in immune evasion, future studies could focus on understanding the mechanisms by which these proteins modulate host immune responses. This knowledge could be leveraged to develop novel vaccine strategies that mitigate these evasion tactics, potentially leading to more effective vaccines.

Development of Differentiated Vaccines and Diagnostic Tools: To support the global eradication efforts, there is a need for vaccines that can be differentiated from natural infections (DIVA vaccines) alongside compatible diagnostic tools. Research could be aimed at developing and validating DIVA vaccines and corresponding tests that allow for the differentiation between vaccinated animals and those naturally infected with PPRV. This would significantly enhance surveillance and control efforts by allowing for more accurate tracking of vaccination coverage and disease spread.
