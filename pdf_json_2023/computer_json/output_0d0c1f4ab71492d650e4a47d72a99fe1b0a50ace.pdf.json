    "abstractText": "This paper provides novel developments in output-feedback stabilization for linear time-invariant systems within the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework. First, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for output-feedback stabilizability in connection with the LQR framework. Then, we propose a novel iterative Newton\u2019s method for output-feedback LQR design and a computationally efficient modified approach that requires solving only a Lyapunov equation at each iteration step. We show that the proposed modified approach guarantees convergence from a stabilizing state-feedback to a stabilizing output-feedback solution and succeeds in solving high dimensional problems where other, state-of-the-art methods, fail. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

In this case, an output-feedback control law defined as\nu(t) = \u2212Fy(t) (3)\nwould be more beneficial. However, finding an optimal outputfeedback control law in the form (3) which minimizes (1), is still one of the most important open questions in control engineering, despite the availability of many approaches and numerical algorithms, as it is pointed out in survey papers [5], [6]. This is mainly due to the lack of testable necessary and sufficient conditions for output-feedback stabilizability.\nFurthermore, the majority of algorithms for output-feedback LQR design are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) [7]\u2013[14] or bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) [15]\u2013[20]. These algorithms are dependent on the used BMI/LMI solvers and could work well for small/medium-sized problems, but may fail to converge to a solution or become computationally too heavy as the problem size increases [21]. In addition, available iterative numerical algorithms with guaranteed convergence such as [22]\u2013[24], or algorithms using nonlinear programming (NLP) such as [25], [26], as well as the recently introduced ray-shooting method based approaches, e.g. [21], [27], unfortunately require a selection of an initial stabilizing output-feedback gain. However, a direct procedure for finding such a gain is unknown and could be hard to get, as highlighted in [5]. The author in [28] has proposed a state-feedback projection theory to bypass the need of a stabilizing output-feedback gain. However, the introduced iterative controller design problem results in a coupled nonlinear matrix equations, and conditions for the existence and global uniqueness are not introduced nor discussed. Furthermore, the proposed Newton approach ensures only sufficient conditions for output-feedback stabilizability. Finally, authors in [29] proposed an algorithm which iterates a Riccati equation from an initial state-feedback solution, but it applies to a restrictive problem description and its convergence has not been proven.\nIn general, finding stabilizing static output-feedbacks (SOFs) is suspected to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), as it is discussed in [5], [21] and [27]. The problem is known to be NP-hard if structural constraints or bounds are imposed on the entries of the controllers, see e.g. [30], [31]. Furthermore, minimal-norm SOFs with bounded entries, pole-placement and simultaneous stabilization via SOFs are also considered to be NP-hard (see [21], [30] and [32], respectively). Moreover, the authors in [5] from 1997 have reviewed results from computational complexity theory\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

This prediction/prognosis from 20 years afar has been more or less proven since, as described above, after yeas of extensive research in this filed, there are still unsolved problems, especially if we consider large-size problems.\nEven though most of the output-feedback problems are considered to be NP-hard, we have shown in our recent paper [33] that within the LQR framework, it is possible to find SOFs in a reasonable time even for large-scale systems. In this paper, we expand and complete our results from [33]. First we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for outputfeedback stabilizability in connection with the LQR framework. Then, we propose a novel iterative output-feedback LQR design approach for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, using Newton\u2019s method. Afterwards, we show that with a simple modification a new iterative algorithm can be obtained which has a guaranteed convergence to an optimal outputfeedback solution from any stabilizing state-feedback solution. In addition, the proposed modified algorithm requires solving only a Lyapunov equation at each iteration step, which is computationally much more tractable then algorithms in the literature, including approaches based on LMIs, BMIs, NLP and ray-shooting methods. Finally, we propose/review some simple and useful modifications/extensions.\nThe mathematical notation of the paper is as follows. The set of real and complex numbers are denoted by R and C, respectively. Given a matrix C \u2208 Rny\u00d7nx , its pseudoinverse is denoted by C+.

Matrices, if not explicitly stated, are assumed to have compatible dimensions. The real part of a complex number z is denoted by \u211c(z). Finally, for any positive integer nx, the nx \u00d7 nx identity and zero matrices are denoted by Inx , 0nx \u2208 Rnx\u00d7nx , respectively. For matrices, \u2225.\u2225 means any matrix norm, consequently \u2225.\u2225F , and \u2225.\u22252 means the Frobenius and induced 2-norm, respectively."

            "text": "This section formulates the necessary and sufficient conditions for output-feedback stabilizability in the LQR framework, essential for the main results.\nConsidering the system (2) and the output-feedback control law (3), let us first recall some related terminology.\nDefinition 1: A square matrix A \u2208 Rnx\u00d7nx is said to be stable if and only if for every eigenvalue \u03bbi of A, \u211c(\u03bbi) \u2264 0.\nDefinition 2: The pair (A,B) is said to be stabilizable if and only if there exists a real matrix K \u2208 Rnu\u00d7nx such that A\u2212BK is stable.\nDefinition 3: The pair (A,C) is said to be detectable if and only if there exists a real matrix L \u2208 Rnx\u00d7ny such that A\u2212 LC is stable.\nDefinition 4: The system (2) is said to be static outputfeedback stabilizable if and only if there exists a real matrix F \u2208 Rnu\u00d7ny such that A\u2212BFC is stable.\nThen the novel necessary and sufficient stability conditions for output-feedback stabilizability in the LQR framework can be formulated as follows.\nTheorem 1: The system (2) is static output-feedback stabilizable if and only if the pair (A,B) is stabilizable, the pair (A,C) is detectable and there exist real matrices F \u2208 Rnu\u00d7ny and G \u2208 Rnu\u00d7nx such that\nFC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ) = G, (4)\nwhere P \u2208 Rnx\u00d7nx is the real symmetric positive semidefinite solution of\nATP + PA+Q+GTRG\n\u2212 (PB +N)R\u22121(BTP +NT ) = 0, (5)\nfor given Q \u2208 Rnx\u00d7nx , N \u2208 Rnx\u00d7nu and R \u2208 Rnu\u00d7nu matrices satisfying [\nQ, N NT , R\n] \u2265 0, R > 0. (6)\nProof: We will first prove the necessity of Theorem 1. Assume that A\u2212BFC is stable for some F , i.e. the system (2) is output-feedback stabilizable. Then the pair (A,B) is stabilizable since A\u2212BK is stable for K = FC, and consequently the pair (A,C) is detectable, since A\u2212 LC is stable for L = BF . Furthermore, because A\u2212BFC is stable, there exists a unique symmetric positive semi-definite matrix P (see Appendix I for details), such that\n(A\u2212BFC)TP + P (A\u2212BFC) +Q + CTFTRFC \u2212 CTFTNT \u2212NFC = 0.\n(7)\nRearranging (7), one can obtain\nATP + PA+Q\n\u2212 (PB +N)R\u22121(BTP +NT ) + ( FC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ) )T R ( FC\n\u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ) ) = 0.\n(8)\nHence, setting G = FC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ) implies the necessity of Theorem 1.\nNow assume that the pair (A,B) is stabilizable, the pair (A,C) is detectable and there exist real matrices F and G satisfying (4). From equations (4) and (5) it follows that (7) is satisfied. From the second condition it follows that A\u2212 LC is stable for some L. Noting that\n(A\u2212 LC) = ( (A\u2212BFC)\u2212 [L, \u2212B] [ C FC ]) , (9)\nit follows that the pair( A\u2212BFC, [ C FC ]) (10)\nis detectable as well. Since P is symmetric and positive semidefinite, we conclude from (7) that A\u2212BFC is stable, and hence the sufficiency of Theorem 1 is proved as well.\nRemark 1: Similar conditions for output-feedback stabilizability have been obtained in [29, Theorem 1], but for a restricted problem formulation with Q = CTC, R = I and N = 0.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nILKA et al.: NOVEL RESULTS ON OUTPUT-FEEDBACK LQR DESIGN 3\nFrom Theorem 1 follows that if the system (2) is outputfeedback stabilizable, then there exists a state feedback gain K = FC such that A\u2212BK is stable. If C is a square and nonsingular matrix, then we can easily express the outputfeedback gain as F = KC\u22121. However, for most of the output-feedback problems the matrix C is non-square, i.e. non-invertible. Therefore, by expressing the output-feedback gain using a pseudo-inverse as F = KC+, a so called pseudoinverse error appears that can be calculated as\nG = FC \u2212K, (11)\nwhich is identical to (4), since K = R\u22121(BTP +NT ). Hence, from the above and the Theorem 1 it follows that if the system (2) is output-feedback stabilizable, then for given Q, R, and N matrices satisfying (6), there exists a real positive semi-definite matrix P such that (5) is fulfilled for\nG = FC \u2212K = FC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ), (12) F = KC+ = R\u22121(BTP +NT )C+. (13)\nThe next Identity is straightforward and used later to obtain the main results.\nIdentity 1: Suppose that F = R\u22121(BTP +NT )C+ and G = FC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ). Then the following statements are identical\n1) R(P ) = ATP + PA+Q+GTRG \u2212 (PB +N)R\u22121(BTP +NT ),\n(14)\n2) R(P ) = Q\u0303+GTRG+ A\u0303TP + PA\u0303\u2212 PS\u0303P, (15) 3) R(P ) = (A\u2212BFC)TP + P (A\u2212BFC) +Q\n+ CTFTRFC \u2212 CTFTNT \u2212NFC (16)\nwhere A\u0303 = A\u2212BR\u22121NT , Q\u0303 = Q\u2212NR\u22121NT and S\u0303 = BR\u22121BT .\nProof: The identity can be proved by substituting back all the denotations.\nIII. INFINITE HORIZON OUTPUT-FEEDBACK LQR DESIGN\nThe equations (14), (15), and (16) are algebraic Riccati-like equations. In general, Newton\u2019s method and it\u2019s modifications are widely used to solve algebraic Riccati equations [34]\u2013[36]. Inspired by [34] and [35], in this section we first propose a Newton\u2019s method based algorithm to design stabilizing static output-feedback controllers. Then, we show that by a simple modification, a computationally similarly tractable stabilizing output-feedback controller design approach can be obtained, while guaranteeing convergence from any initial state-feedback LQR solution. Finally, after a short sensitivity analysis, we show the relation of these approaches to the infinite horizon output-feedback LQR problem (i.e. to find a control law in the form (3), minimizing the cost function (1), subject to system dynamics (2) and initial state x0)."

Therefore, global convergence and existence of a stabilizing solution remains to be proven. Although, standard local q-quadratic convergence results for Newton\u2019s method apply [41, Theorem 5.2.1], as detailed in [42, Theorem 1]. In particular, if Newton\u2019s method is started sufficiently close to a solvent for which the Fre\u0301chet derivative is non-singular, the iteration converges with a quadratic rate. Kantorovich theorem can also be applied to provide sufficient conditions for existence of a solvent and convergence of Newton\u2019s method to that solvent [41, Theorem 5.3.1].\nRemark 4: Based on standard results for Newton\u2019s method (see [41, Theorem 5.2.1] and [42, Theorem 1]), Algorithm 1 requires an initial guess P1 = PT1 which is close enough to a solvent for which the Fre\u0301chet derivative (i.e. KL) is nonsingular. However, a direct procedure to get such initial guess is out of the topic of this paper, since the results from this subsection are only used as an intermediate step to obtain the main results, the modified Newton\u2019s method.\nIn the next subsection we show that with a simple modification a new iterative algorithm can be obtained which has a guaranteed convergence from any stabilizing state-feedback solution to an output-feedback solution."

The next Proposition shows that if the conditions described in Theorem 1 hold, then with a stabilizing starting guess (P1) the Algorithm 2 cannot fail due to a singular Lyapunov operator.\nProposition 1: Suppose that the conditions in Theorem 1 hold, and the pair (A\u0303, C\u0303q) is detectable, where Q\u0303 = C\u0303Tq C\u0303q is a full-rank factorisation of Q\u0303. If P1 is stabilizing, and Algorithm 2 is applied to (15), then the Lyapunov operator of the Lyapunov equation in step 7 from Algorithm 2 is nonsingular for all j and the sequence of approximate solutions Xj is well defined.\nProof: Suppose that the pair (A\u0303, C\u0303q) is detectable. From step 7 from Algorithm 2 applied to (15) we can get\n(A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303Pj)T (Pj +Xj) + (Pj +Xj)(A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303Pj) = \u2212Q\u0303\u2212GTj RGj \u2212 PjS\u0303Pj \u2264 \u2212Q\u0303, (32)\nsince Q\u0303 and S\u0303 are positive semi-definite, due to Q\u2212NR\u22121NT \u2265 0 and R > 0. From (32) follows that if A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303Pj is stable, then A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303(Pj +Xj) is also stable. Furthermore, Lemma 3 implies that Pj +Xj is positive semi-definite. The Lyapunov operator corresponding to the Lyapunov equation in step 7 from Algorithm 2 is well defined, precisely as\n\u2126\u0303j(Xj) = (A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303Pj)TXj +Xj(A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303Pj), (33)\nfor Xj \u2208 Rnx\u00d7nx and j = 1, 2, . . .. Let us recall the following Lemma.\nLemma 4: Suppose that {Pj}\u221ej=2 is a sequence of symmetric matrices such that {R(Pj)}\u221ej=2 is bounded. If the pair (A\u0303, B) is stabilizable and A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303Pj is stable for each j = 2, . . ., then {Pj}\u221ej=2 is bounded.\nProof: For proof see [35, Lemma 2.3, p. 696]. Remark 5: If R(Pj) \u0338= 0, i.e., if Pj is not a solution of (15), then the Newton step (of Algorithm 2) is a descent direction of \u2225R(Pj +Xj)\u2225F . It follows that we have \u2225R(Pj +Xj)\u2225F \u2264 \u2225R(Pj)\u2225F and \u2225R(Pj +Xj)\u2225F = \u2225R(Pj)\u2225F if and only if R(Pj) = 0. That is, the residual decreases as long as Pj is not a solution of (15).\nRemark 6: It is important to note that P1 \u2265 P2, where P1 is the initial guess, is not true in general. This is one of the drawbacks of Newton\u2019s methods. In [34] and [35] the authors have introduced a step-size control (for state-feedback LQR design), which can efficiently solve the problem of a potentially disastrous first Newton step.\nCollecting the results so far, we have the following convergence result for the modified Newton\u2019s method.\nTheorem 2: Suppose that the pair (A\u0303, B) is stabilizable, the pair (A\u0303, C\u0303q) is detectable, and there exist real matrices F and G such that FC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ) = G. If Algorithm 2 is applied to (15) with a stabilizing starting guess P1 (i.e. A\u0303\u2212BK1 is stable for some Q\u0303 \u2265 0), then P \u2217 = limj\u2192\u221e Pj exists and is the stabilizing solution of the generalized Riccatilike equation (15).\nProof: The proof follows from Theorem 1, Lemma 2, 3, 4, and Proposition 1.\nRemark 7: The assumption that the pair (A\u0303, C\u0303q) is detectable, where Q\u0303 = C\u0303Tq C\u0303q is a full-rank factorisation of Q\u0303, is a requirement even for the standard state-feedback LQR design.\nRemark 8: If C = I then G = 0 and the Algorithm 2 becomes equivalent to [35, Algorithm 1.1] for state-feedback LQR design (or to [34, Algorithm 1], if we require controllability of the pair (A\u0303, B) and observability of the pair (A\u0303, C\u0303q)).\nRemark 9: From Theorem 2 follows that the convergence rate of Algorithm 2 is at least sublinear. We have observed from the examples studied later in Section V that the convergence rate is in fact linear, if A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303P \u2217 has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, although further investigation is needed for a formal proof. If A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303P \u2217 has eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, the convergence behaviour remains an open problem (as it is still an open problem even for standard state-feedback LQR design, see for example [35, Remark 1.1]).\nRemark 10: If system (2) is stabilizable and (A\u0303, C\u0303q) is detectable, then the standard state-feedback LQR solution for (2) for some Q\u0303 \u2265 0 always gives a P1 for which A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303P1 is stable."

First, let us recall the necessary conditions for the solution of the LQR problem with output feedback, i.e. the existence of a control law in the form (3) minimizing (1) subject to (2) with R > 0, Q\u2212NR\u22121NT \u2265 0 and x(0) = x0.\nLemma 5: The necessary conditions for the solution of the LQR problem with output feedback are given by\n0 = ATc P + PAc +Q+ C TFTRFC \u2212 CTFTNT\n\u2212NFC, (37)\n0 = AcY + Y A T c + Xx0 , (38) 0 = RFCPCT \u2212 (BTP +NT )Y CT , (39)\nwith Xx0 = x0xT0 and Ac = A\u2212BFC. Proof: For proof see [48, p. 297-302]. The dependence of Xx0 in (38) in the initial states x0 makes the optimal gain dependent on the initial state through equation (38). In many applications x0 may not be known (which is typical for output-feedback design, as it is pointed out in [48]). It is usual (see for example [49]), to sidestep this problem by replacing\nXx0 \u2261 E{Xx0}, (40)\nwhere E{Xx0} = E{x0xT0 } is the initial autocorrelation of the state. Usually, it is assumed that nothing is known of x0 except that it is uniformly distributed on a surface described by Xx0 . Most of the papers on output-feedback LQR design assume that the initial states are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, i.e. Xx0 = I (e.g. [14], [18], [48], [50]).\nThe next theorem describes how Algorithm 1 and 2 are connected to the initial condition problem described above.\nTheorem 3: The solution of Algorithm 1 and 2 satisfies the necessary conditions described by equations (37)\u2013(39) in Lemma 5 if and only if Y = I and Xx0 = \u2212Ac \u2212ATc .\nProof: From (39) it follows that\nF = R\u22121(BTP +NT )Y CT (CY CT )\u22121. (41)\nBy assuming that Y = I the equation (41) reduces to\nF = R\u22121(BTP +NT )CT (CCT )\u22121\n= R\u22121(BTP +NT )C+, (42)\nwhich is identical to the step 3 in Algorithm 1 and 2. Furthermore, from equation (38) for Y = I it follows that\nXx0 = \u2212Ac \u2212ATc . (43)\nFinally, setting G = FC \u2212R\u22121(BTP +NT ) and by rearranging (37) we can get (14) which is equivalent (see Identity 1) to the step 5 in Algorithm 1 and 2. Hence, the proof is completed.\nRemark 11: The initial state x0 is generally free and so is Y which is a function of Xx0 . Hence, instead of guessing Xx0 = I , we may guess for Y = I , and thus the nonlinearity in Y in (37)\u2013(39) disappears. So, one can get a simple Riccati-like equation (37), which can be solved easily using Algorithm 1 or 2.\nA direct comparison of setting Xx0 = I versus Y = I will be investigated in Section V."

All examples and numerical solutions have been carried out on ASUS ZenBook UX480F (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80 GHz, 16 GB RAM) laptop computer using Matlab 2018b [56]. Furthermore, BMI and iLMI formulations have been carried out by Penlab BMI solver [57] and by Mosek LMI solver [58] using YALMIP R20190425 [59]. Finally, the proposed algorithms (Algorithm 1, 2 and 3) have been implemented in Matlab programming language (see Listing 1, 2 and 3), where for the Algorithm 2 and 3 for the step 7 the built-in Matlab lyap subrutin has been used, and for the Algorithm 1 for the step 7 the equation (27). Furthermore, in order to simplify the code of the Algorithm 2, the Identity 1 has been used and the equation (15) has been replaced with equation (16).\nMatlab implementations and examples are fully provided in Listing 1, 2 and 3.

            "text": "The first set of examples contains 1000 SOF stabilizable examples in 10 groups generated by Matlab\u2019s rss subrutin2. Each group represents 100 examples with different size of system order (see Table I). Hence, we can test the behaviour and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and compare them to other output-feedback algorithms in the LQR framework for increasing number of states.\nThe weighting matrices have been chosen as Q = CTC, R = I and N = 0. The initial Lyapunov matrix for Algorithm 1, 2 and 3 is the optimal Lyapunov matrix from the standard state-feedback LQR design. The stopping criterion and maximal iteration number for Algorithm 1, 2 and 3 have been chosen as \u03f5 = 10\u221212 and maxIteration = 9\u00d7 106. Finally, for Algorithm 3 and for the iLMI and BMI methods, the initial state matrix has been chosen as Xx0 = I , i.e. it has been assumed that the initial states are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere.\nThe effect of increasing the number of states on the running time of one iteration and on the number of iterations of Algorithm 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The effect of increasing the number of states on the rcond(R(P )) and on the number of iterations of Algorithm 1 and 2 is shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the number of iterations and therefore the overall running times of Algorithm 1 and 2 are sensitive to the relative condition number of (14) (rcond(R(P ))). That was to be expected, since it is well known that the Newton\u2019s method based approaches, in general, are sensitive to illconditioning. The effect of increasing the number of states on the average running times and on solved examples of Algorithm 1, 2, 3, and of the iLMI and BMI methods are shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the Algorithm 2 outperformed all the other algorithms and methods since it has solved all the examples in this test set, while the running time was very close or sometimes better then the running time of Algorithm 1. Furthermore, it can be observed that eventhough for the Algorithm 1 we do not have a convergence proof from a state-feedback solution (as for Algorithm 2), it has solved many more examples than the iLMI or the BMI methods. Furthermore, Algorithm 3 for nx \u2265 30 failed to converge to a solution for few examples. It should be noted that for all those examples the rcond(R(P ))> 1010, and even the Algorithm 2 has struggled, since the number of iterations for those examples was higher then 104, while for the rest of the examples in those groups was smaller with almost 1 or 2,\n2The Matlab\u2019s rss subrutin generates a random stable system, therefore all the examples are SOF stabilizable as well (since one can select the outputfeedback gain as zero and the closed-loop system will be stable).\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

This is the reason for that large trajectory of number of iterations of Algorithm 2 in Fig. 2 for nx > 10.\nFinally, Fig. 5 compares how far the actual linear quadratic cost is for some randomly generated initial state conditions (x0 within a unit sphere) for Xx0 = I and for Y = I from the optimal output-feedback cost (minimizing the linear quadratic cost for the given x0). It can be observed that the\ndistribution of distances from the optimal cost for different initial conditions for Y = I , i.e. for Algorithm 2, is comparable with the choice of setting Xx0 = I . Hence, Algorithm 2 is a viable approach for output-feedback LQR design with unknown initial conditions.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "heading": "B. Second set of examples",
            "text": "The second set includes all the continuous-time SOF stabilizable examples from the COMPleib library [55] (Table II), i.e. all the examples expect the 10 reduced order control (ROC) instances, and the 4 examples pointed out in [60], which are not continuous-time stabilizable (REA4, NN3, NN10, and NN12, indicated with the a superscript in Table II). This rich-full library contains benchmark examples from a wide spectrum of real-world applications and academic problems even with nx > 4000. Therefore, we can test the behaviour and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on large-scale stable/unstable plants as well. For better highlighting the benefits of the proposed methods, the iLMI and the BMI formulation have been evaluated on the COMPleib library as well.\nThe weighting matrices for all examples have been chosen as Q = CTC + \u03b1I , R = I and N = 0, where \u03b1 = 10\u22129. The \u03b1I has been introduced to ensure the positive-definiteness of the Q matrix, as most of the examples in the COMPleib library are ill-conditioned causing the CTC to became negative definite due to numerical errors. The initial Lyapunov matrix for the Algorithm 2 is the optimal Lyapunov matrix from the standard state-feedback LQR design. Furthermore, the stopping criterion and maximal iteration number for Algorithm 2 have been chosen as \u03f5 = 10\u221212 and maxIteration = 9\u00d7 106. For the iLMI and BMI methods the Xx0 has been chosen as Xx0 = I , and all other solver related parameters for the Mosek LMI and Penlab BMI solvers have been kept as default.\nThe results summarized in Table II indicate that the proposed approach is superior compared to BMI and iLMI formulations. While the proposed Algorithm 2 has solved 92% (101/110) of the examples, the iLMI formulation 63% (59/110) and the BMI formulation only 17% (19/110). That is, Algorithm 2 solved 71% more examples than iLMI, and 432% more than the BMI method. In addition, even with the built-in Matlab lyap subrutin, which is not well-suited for large-scale problems, we where able to solve examples with order higher then 4000 within minutes. The LAH example, see Table II, well demonstrates that the proposed approach is computationally much more tractable than approaches based on LMIs and/or BMIs. While the Algorithm 2 converged to a solution in 1.23ms, it took 31.20 s for the iLMI formulation, and 8.28 h for the BMI one.\nThe results with Algorithm 2 can be further divided into 4 groups.\n1) Examples which can be solved without any problem with the Algorithm 2 (73%, 80/110 examples). 2) Examples where we had to use the balreal Matlab subrutin to balance the system matrices in order to get convergence to a solution with the Algorithm 2 (19%, 21 examples: AC9, AC14, HE5, JE1, JE2, JE3, TG1, WEC1, WEC2, WEC3, UWV, TF1, CDP, NN5, NN13, NN14, HF2D1, HF2D2, HF2D5, HF2D6, HF2D7, and HF2D8). These examples are also indicated with the b\nsuperscript and with gray color in Table II; 3) Examples where we had to allow large maximal iteration\nnumber (> 109) in order to converge to a solution with the Algorithm 2 (2%, 2 examples: AC9 and CDP). 4) Examples where the Algorithm 2 has failed to converge to a solution (8%, 9 examples: AC10, AC13, AC18, HE1, TF3, NN6, NN7, NN9, and NN17).\nThe COMPleib library well demonstrates that without proper regularization or preconditioning, the proposed algorithms may fail to converge due to numerical issues. The same is true for the iLMI and BMI methods. Table II also indicates that with system balancing (in our case with the built-in Matlab balreal subrutin) we are able to solve 26% more examples with the Algorithm 2 than without any system balancing. This number can be further increased by preconditioning the Lyapunov/Sylvester equation within the Newton\u2019s method similarly as in [36]. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be easily extended with exact line-search, similarly as it is done in [34], [35] to speed up the convergence and to reduce the overall running time even further.\nIn Remark 9 we have discussed that the convergence rate of the Algorithm 2 is at least sublinear. However, we have observed from the examples above that the convergence rate is in fact linear, if A\u0303\u2212 S\u0303P \u2217 has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. Convergence rates of the proposed Algorithm 1 and 2 on different COMPleib plants (AC3, AC4 and DIS2), for initial Lyapunov matrices obtained from standard state-feedback LQR design, are shown in Fig. 6 and 8. Convergence rates of the Algorithm 1 and 2 on the COMPleib plant AC3 for random initial Lyapunov matrices are shown in Fig. 7 and 9. From the figures it can be observed that the convergence rate is quadratic for Algorithm 1 and is linear for Algorithm 2, if the initial Lyapunov matrix is calculated by the standard LQR design, and that it becomes quadratic/linear in the neighbourhood of the solution when the Lyapunov matrix is randomly initialized.\nIn summary, the proposed algorithms, unlike other methods based on linear/bilinear matrix inequalities, NLPs, and rayshooting methods, can solve almost all the SOF examples in the COMPleib library (most of them within milliseconds). Until now it has been achieved only by some multivariate direct search methods applied to SOF stabilization in [60]. However, the author\u2019s attention in that publication was restricted to SOF stabilization only, i.e. no attempt was made to optimize closedloop performance criteria relevant to control engineering. For more comparison, the readers are referred to [61], where the authors have evaluated different controller design approaches\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "This paper provides novel results on static output-feedback controller design for linear time-invariant systems in the LQR framework. Even though most of the output-feedback control problems are considered to be NP-hard, we show that within the LQR framework it is possible to find SOFs in sublinear (linear) time even for large-scale systems. The proposed framework, with novel necessary and sufficient conditions for\noutput-feedback stabilizability, opens the possibility to use well known methods, such as the Newton\u2019s methods, to design SOFs with guaranteed convergence from a stabilizing statefeedback solution to a stabilizing output-feedback solution. Hence, we can get computationally efficient approaches which succeed in solving high dimensional problems where other, state-of-the-art methods fail.\nThe usability, tractability and effectiveness is also verified on more than 1000 numerical examples in addition to all the SOF stabilizable plants from the COMPleib library. The proposed Algorithm 2, unlike other methods based on linear/bilinear matrix inequalities, NLPs, can solve almost all the SOF examples in the COMPleib library (most of them within milliseconds). Along this line, numerical results also indicate that the proposed algorithms suffer from the well known drawbacks of Newton\u2019s methods. Therefore, regularization and proper scaling is needed to improve usability of the proposed approaches for ill-conditioned problems.\nIn terms of future works, the Lyapunov equation can be preconditioned within the Newton\u2019s method similarly as in [36], and the proposed approaches can be easily extended with exact line-search, similarly as it is done in [34], [35].\nAPPENDIX I EXISTENCE OF P \u2265 0\nLemma 6: Let F \u2208 Rnu\u00d7ny be given such that A\u2212BFC is stable.
