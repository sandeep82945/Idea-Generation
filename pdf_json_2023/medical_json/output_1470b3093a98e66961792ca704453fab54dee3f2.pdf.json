See the published version at https://doi.org/10.1007/s10238-023-01074-5.\nPage 3/16\nAbstract\nBackground The eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) decreased gradually. This study aimed to analyze the e cacy and safety of a 14-day combination of vonoprazan and amoxicillin as the rst-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection, and compared them with those of the bismuth quadruple therapy.\nMethods A prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed, involving patients with H. pylori infection in 6 institutions who did not receive any treatment yet. They were randomly assigned into VA-dual group (vonprazan 20mg b.i.d + amoxicillin 750mg q.i.d) or EACP-quadruple group (esomeprazole 20mg + amoxicillin 1000mg + clarithromycin 500mg + colloidal bismuth subcitrate 220mg b.i.d) for 14 days in ratio of 1:1. At least 28 days later, the eradication rate were detected by the 13C-urea breath test (UBT).\nResults A total of 562 patients from February 2022 to September 2022 were enrolled and 316 were randomly. In the ITT analysis, the eradication rates of H. pylori in VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group were 89.9% and 81.0% respectively, p = 0.037. In the PP analysis were 97.9% and 90.8%, p = 0.009. The different eradication rate was 8.9% (95%CI, 1.2\u201316.5%) and 7.2% (95%CI, 1.8\u201312.4%) in ITT and PP analysis, both lower limit of the 95%CI was still higher than the prespeci ed margin. In addition, the incidence of adverse events in VA-dual group was signi cantly lower than that in EACP-quadruple group (19.0% vs. 43.0%, P < 0.001).\nConclusion The e cacy and safety of a 14-day combination therapy of vonoprazan and amoxicillin in eradicating H. pylori are superior to bismuth quadruple therapy, and this combination signi cantly reduces the use of antibiotics.\nIntroduction Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) causes chronic infection in about 50% of the global population[1]. Although the overall prevalence of H. pylori infection has generally declined, the infection and re-infection rates in developing countries stay above 80%[2]. H. pylori infection is closely implicated in gastritis, peptic ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. H. pylori-related diseases can be\nPage 4/16\nsigni cantly prevented or alleviated by eradicating H. pylori[3\u20136]. H. pylori gastritis has been con rmed as an infectious disease. All recent global consensuses recommend an eradication therapy to people with H. pylori infection[4, 7, 8].\nThe rst-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and at least two antibiotics for 7\u201314 days[9]. The eradication rate of H. pylori has persistently decreased from > 90% in 1990 to current < 70%, due to the unconquerable antibiotic resistance[10, 11]. To control H. pylori resistance to antibiotics, the rst-line bismuth quadruple therapy for 10\u201314 days has been recommended by international and domestic guidelines[7, 12, 13]. Although the bismuth quadruple therapy achieves a high eradication rate of H. pylori of up to 80%, its clinical application is limited by severe adverse events, high medical cost and low compliance. The combination of multiple antibiotics may also increase the risk of drug resistance in the future. Seriously, few antibiotics can be used if the rst-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection fails. A modi ed regimen with a high eradication rate and a lor risk of drug resistance is urgently needed.\nCurrently, the resistance rate to amoxicillin is extremely low (3.0%) in most countries[14, 15]. Due to its short half-life, frequent use of amoxicillin achieves a high e cacy[16]. It is usually combined with acidsuppression medications, because of its antibacterial activity decreases sharply upon exposure to gastric acid. The rst-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection consisting of high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin has been validated to have strong e cacy, high compliance and low incidence of adverse events. Moreover, its single use does not enhance the resistance of H. pylori. Sugimoto et al[17] have found that the degree of PPI-induced acid suppression is closely linked with the eradication rate of H. pylori. Maintaining gastric pH > 6 is essential for the eradication of H. pylori. The acid-suppressing effect of PPI mainly depends on an individual\u2019s ability to metabolize PPI, which is largely in uenced by the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19, a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme in the liver. Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, can be immediately protonated in the acidic secretory canaliculus. It non-covalently binds to E2-P conformation of H+/K+-ATPases in a potassiumcompetitive and reversible manner, thus achieving the acid-suppressing effect via preventing the dephosphorylation of H+/K+-ATPases and blocking the H+/K+ exchange. Compared with PPIs, vonoprazan is featured by the strong and long-lasting effect in inhibiting the production of gastric acid, because the metabolism of this drug is less in uenced by genetic polymorphisms[18]. Therefore, we speculated that the eradication rate of vonoprazan fumarate combined with amoxicillin, as the rst-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection, should be higher than that of PPIs combined with amoxicillin. A relevant study in Japan has validated the application of a vonoprazan - based triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori in a Japanese population[19]. In Chinese, H. pylori infection is featured by a higher resistance rate, and the combination may satisfy the requirements in the treatment.\nThe present study aimed to analyze the e cacy and safety of a 14-day combination of vonoprazan with amoxicillin as the rst-line eradication therapy for H. pylori infection, and compared them with those of the bismuth quadruple therapy. Our results are expected to provide reference for developing highly effective and safe regimens for H. pylori eradication.\nPage 5/16\nMethods\nStudy design and allocation A multicenter, prospective, open-label RCT was designed to assess the non-inferiority of the combination of vonoprazan and amoxicillin (VA-dual) to the bismuth quadruple therapy consisting of esomeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and CBS (EACP-quadruple) in eradicating H. pylori infection. This study followed the Declaration of Helsinki and Guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), which was approved by the ethic committees of the six participant institutions, including the Sixth A liated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen Hospital. It was registered in the ClinicalTrials (NCT05196945).\nThe present study recruited 316 consecutive patients with H. pylori infection from February 2022 to September 2022 in six medical institutions in China.\nInclusion criteria: (1) Aged 18\u201370 years (male or female); (2) Diagnosed with positive H. pylori infection by 13C-UBT or pathological examination; (3) Having no history of eradication therapy for H. pylori infection; (4) Eligible to the Chinese National Consensus Report on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection, 2017; (5) Having provided written informed consent.\nExclusion criteria: (1) Allergy to the drugs used in the RCT; (2) Liver, kidney, cardiac or pulmonary insu ciency; (3) History of malignancies; (4) Current use of clopidogrel or warfarin that may in uence the metabolism of CYP2C19; (5) Pregnant or lactating women, or women who were planning to get pregnant; (6) Severe mental illness; (7) History of upper gastrointestinal surgery; (8) Involved in other clinical trial within previous 3 months.\nDropout criteria: (1) Loss to follow-up or voluntary dropout of the RCT; (2) Unintended pregnancy; (3) Intolerable adverse events; (4) Reasons for dropout determined by investigators. Interventions Eligible patients with H. pylori infection were randomly assigned into VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group in a ratio of 1:1. Patients in the former group were given vonoprazan (20 mg b.i.d.) + amoxicillin (750 mg q.i.d.) for 14 days, and the latter were given esomeprazole (20 mg b.i.d.) + amoxicillin (1.0 g b.i.d.) + clarithromycin (0.5 g b.i.d.) + CBS (220 mg b.i.d.) for 14 days. The random numbers were independently generated by a statistician using the SAS software according to the center-strati ed randomization factors, sealed in sealed opaque envelopes, and sent to each institution. Both patients and investigators were blind to the random numbers. Interventions should be immediately terminated in case of severe allergic reactions, and corresponding medical measures were given. Interventions were discontinued if patients asked to drop out. Drugs that might in uence the metabolism of CYP2C19 or drinking during the RCT were prohibited.\nPrimary outcome\nPage 6/16\nThe primary outcome was the eradication rate of H. pylori after a 14-day treatment of VA-dual versus EACP-quadruple regimen, which was assessed by the 13C-UBT at least 28 days after treatment. Acidsuppressing drugs or antibiotics that may in uence 13C-UBT outcomes were prohibited before the test. The eradication rate of H. pylori was determined by ITT and PP analyses. All eligible patients with H. pylori infection were involved in the ITT analysis, and those who were lost to follow-up or not received 13C-UBT were considered as uncured. Patients with H. pylori infection who lost to follow-up or not take 13C-UBT were excluded from the PP analysis. Secondary outcome The secondary outcome was the incidence of adverse events during the eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. After the approval of the Ethic Committee, follow-up visits were performed through telephone or on site. The severity of adverse events was assessed into grade 1\u20134 based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.5.0.10. Procedures Demographic data of eligible patients after recruitment were recorded, including sex, age, height, body weight, smoking history, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. Positive H. pylori was diagnosed by 13C-UBT or pathological examination. Eligible patients were randomly allocated and given corresponding interventions.\nPhysical examination and vital sign assessment were performed after the 14-day eradication therapy. The 13C-UBT was performed using 100 mg UBIT tablets (Guangzhou Huayou Mingkang Photoelectric Technology Co., Ltd) after 28 days of eradication therapy, and a cut-off value of 4% was adopted. Telephone or on-site follow-up visits were performed at 7, 14, 28 and 42 days, respectively. Adverse events and concomitant drugs during the whole procession of RCT were monitored (Fig.\u00a01).\nSample size Through literature review, the eradication rate of PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy for H. pylori infection is 90.0%, and that of bismuth quadruple therapy consisting of esomeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and CBS ranges 85.0\u201395.0%. We assumed that the eradication rate of the 14-day VA-dual or EACPquadruple regimen was 90%, and a non-inferiority study was adopted with a cut-off value of -10% and a 1:1 allocation ratio between the VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group (two-tailed \u03b1 = 0.05, \u03b2 = 0.2, power = 80%). Then, the total sample size should be 284 cases. Considering that 10% of subjects might lost to follow-up, the total sample size should be 316 cases (158 cases in one group). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0. Measurement data were compared by one-way ANOVA or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test between groups. Enumeration data were compared by Chi-square test. Differences in the eradication rate of H. pylori and the corresponding 95%CI were calculated for the\nPage 7/16\nnon-inferiority test. Primary outcomes were assessed by ITT and PP analyses. Two-tailed p < 0.05 was considered as statistically signi cant.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics A total of 562 patients with H. pylori infection were screened within 8 months, and nally 316 eligible ones were randomly assigned into VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group. In the former group, 1 patient did not receive the intervention, 10 were lost to follow-up and 3 dropped out due to their poor compliance lower than 80%. Seventeen patients in the latter group dropped out due to loss to follow-up (n = 11), poor compliance (n = 5) and pregnancy (n = 1) (Fig.\u00a02). Demographic and clinical data between groups were comparable (all P > 0.05, Table\u00a01).\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of included patients\n\u00a0 VA-dual\n(n = 158)\nEACP-quadruple\n(n = 158)\nP\nGender \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nMale 76(48.1%) 71(44.9%) \u00a0\nFemale 82(51.9%) 87(55.1%) 0.652\nAge(years, mean \u00b1 SD) 40.1 \u00b1 12.1 41.9 \u00b1 12.6 0.306\nBMI(kg/m2,mean \u00b1 SD) 21.8 \u00b1 2.5 21.8 \u00b1 2.7 0.861\nCigarette smoking 19(12.0%) 17(10.7%) 0.859\nAlcohol drinking 9(5.7%) 11(6.9%) 0.818\nDiagnosis \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nChronic gastritis 46(29.1%) 53(33.5%) \u00a0\nGastric ulcer 11(7.0%) 9(5.7%) \u00a0\nDuodenal ulcer 11(7.0%) 11(7.0%) \u00a0\nHealth examination 90(56.9%) 85(53.8%) 0.840\nE cacy In the ITT analysis, the eradication rate of H. pylori in VA-dual group was signi cantly higher than that in EACP-quadruple group (89.9% [95%CI, 85.1\u201394.6%] vs. 81.0% [95%CI, 74.8\u201387.2%], P = 0.037).\nPage 8/16\nConsistently in the PP analysis, it was still signi cantly higher in VA-dual group than that in EACPquadruple group (97.9% [95%CI, 95.6\u2013100%] vs. 90.8% [95%CI, 85.9\u201395.6%], P = 0.009) (Fig.\u00a03, Table\u00a02).\nIn the ITT analysis, the different eradication rate (eradication rate in VA-dual group minus that in EACPquadruple group) was 8.9% (95%CI, 1.2\u201316.5%), and the lower limit of the 95%CI was higher than the prespeci ed margin. Similarly in the PP analysis, the different eradication rate was 7.2% (95%CI, 1.8\u2013 12.4%), and the lower limit of the 95%CI was still higher than the prespeci ed margin (Table\u00a02).\n* Different Eradication rate = Eradication rate in VA-dual group \u2013 eradication rate in EACP-quadruple group.\n** The p values were obtained from two- sided comparisons of difference between the VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group. Safety No signi cant difference in the medication compliance (< 80%) was found between VA-dual group and EACP-quadruple group during the RCT (1.9% vs. 3.1%, P > 0.05). The overall incidence of adverse events in VA-dual group was 19.0% (30/158), involving 28 cases of mild (CTCAE Grade 1) and 2 of moderate adverse events (Grade 2). In EACP-quadruple group, the overall incidence of adverse events was 43.0% (68/158), involving 62 cases of mild (CTCAE Grade 1) and 6 of moderate adverse events (Grade 2). The incidence of adverse events was signi cantly lower in VA-dual group than in EACP-quadruple group (P < 0.001, Table\u00a03). No severe adverse events (Grade 3\u20134) in both groups were reported. Main adverse events included oral malodor, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc. All except for skin rash dwindled without interventions. Nine patients with skin rash were cured by oral or topical antiallergic drugs. No patients were hospitalized or withdrawn due to adverse events.\nPage 9/16\nTable 3 Adverse events of eradication therapy for H. pylori infection.\nAdverse event VA-dual group\n(n = 158)\nEACP-quadruple group\n(n = 158)\nP\nOral malodor (n, %) 4 (2.5%) 50 (31.6%) < 0.001\nNausea/Vomiting (n, %) 10 (6.3%) 22 (12.9%) 0.039\nAbdominal pain (n, %) 8 (5.1%) 9 (5.7%) > 0.999\nDiarrhea (n, %) 15 (9.5%) 16 (10.1%) > 0.999\nSkin rash (n, %) 2 (1.3%) 7 (4.4%) 0.173\nHeadache (n, %) 1 (6.3%) 1 (6.3%) > 0.999\nTotal (n, %) 30 (19.0%) 68 (43.0%) < 0.001\nDiscontinued drugs for adverse events (n, %) 0 0 N.A.\nUse of less than 80% of drugs (n, %) 3 (1.9%) 5 (3.1%) 0.723\nN.A., not applicable.\nDiscussion The resistance to antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, is challenging the e cacy of H. pylori eradication therapies, especially in countries with soaring use of antibiotics, like China[20]. The eradication rate of conventional PPI-based triple therapy for H. pylori infection has declined gradually[10, 11]. Growing evidence has validated that bismuth quadruple therapy for 10\u201314 days and high-dose PPI-based dual or triple therapy have remarkably enhanced the eradication rate of H. pylori[12]. However, they are limited by severe adverse events, high medical cost, low compliance, and poor metabolism of PPIs. It is reported that the eradication rate of the rst-line triple therapy is 55\u201372%[21, 22] and that of bismuth quadruple therapy is 80\u201395%[23, 24].\nIn the present study, the H. pylori eradication rates of VA-dual therapy in the ITT and PP analyses were acceptable, reaching 89.9% and 97.9%, respectively. The difference in the eradication rate between VAdual group and EACP-quadruple group was 8.9% (95%CI, 1.2\u201316.5%) in the ITT analysis and 7.2% (95%CI, 1.8\u201312.4%) in the PP analysis. The lower limits of the 95%CI in both analyses were higher than the prespeci ed margin, suggesting that the VA-dual therapy was not inferior, or even superior to the rst-line EACP-quadruple therapy. In addition, patients receiving VA-dual therapy maintained a high compliance, although amoxicillin was taken 4 times per day. The ratio of patients showing a compliance below 80% in VA-dual group was lower than that in EACP-quadruple group (1.9% vs. 3.1%), which may be the attributed to the less types of drugs and little in uence of meals on vonoprazan intake. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst multicenter, prospective RCT proving that a 14-day dual therapy consisting of\nPage 10/16\nvonoprazan (20 mg b.i.d.) + amoxicillin (750 mg q.i.d.) presents high eradication rate (> 90.0%), compliance and safety in eradicating H. pylori.\nIntragastric pH is a potent factor affecting the eradication rate of H. pylori[25]. Multiple clinical trials have validated the acceptable e cacy of vonoprazan-based triple therapy and bismuth quadruple therapy [26, 27]. Our results showed that the eradication rate of VA-dual therapy for H. pylori infection was higher than those of the EACP-quadruple and previously reported PPI-based dual or triple therapy, which may be associated with the stronger acid-suppressing effect of vonoprazan and longer maintenance of intragastric pH > 6. Vonoprazan is a reversible competitive inhibitor of potassium by covalently binding to H+/K+-ATPases[28]. With the gradual dissociation, it continuously inhibits the formation of H+/K+ATPases. Vonoprazan increases the intragastric pH value to 7 within 4 hours[29], showing a stronger and acid-activity-independent acid-suppressing effect than PPIs[18]. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic pro le of vonoprazan is not in uenced by the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19[30].\nAntibiotic resistance is another factor that affects the eradication rate of H. pylori[31]. The resistance rate to clarithromycin in Asian patients with H. pylori infection is on the rise. The high eradication rate of VAdual therapy may be attributed to patients\u2019 low resistance to amoxicillin. In addition, as a time-dependent antibiotic, the e cacy of amoxicillin 4 times per day was superior to the conventional EACP-quadruple therapy twice a day. The regimens of amoxicillin dual therapy vary across regions due to the their resistance rates (38%, 14%, 12%, 8% and 0\u20131% in Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, Americas and Europe and the Western Paci c, respectively)[32]. Amoxicillin is the only antibiotic used in the VA-dual therapy, posing little in uence on subsequent antibiotic resistance. The drug resistance of H. pylori has become a global issue. The WHO Global Priority Pathogens List 2017 put clarithromycinresistant H. pylori into the same grade as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium[33]. In addition to clarithromycin, the resistance rates of metronidazole and levo oxacin have also signi cantly increased. It should be cautious to select the optimal antibiotics used in the H. pylori eradication therapy. Ideally, low-resistant antibiotics are selected according to the results drug susceptibility tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for H. pylori, however, is invasive and requires cell culture in the laboratory, thus cumbering the clinical application and increasing the medical cost. Therefore, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for H. pylori prior to the initial eradication therapy is not recommended in most of global consensuses. In our RCT, the VA-dual therapy using only one antibiotic achieved an eradication rate of 90%, suggesting that VA-dual therapy could serve as the rstline eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. A combination therapy of multiple antibiotics based on the drug susceptibility data can be adopted as a salvage therapy if the VA-dual therapy fails, therefore minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use. The present therapy can prevent the development of extensive drug resistance and reduce the medical cost.\nThe adverse events of H. pylori eradication therapy in previous studies mainly include oral malodor, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and rash, which are consistent with those in our study. Compared with the EACP-quadruple therapy, the tolerance of patients with H. pylori infection to VA-dual therapy was stronger. The adverse events demonstrated a much lower incidence in VA-dual group than in EACP-\nPage 11/16\nquadruple group (19.0% vs. 43.0%), all mild and moderate. No severe adverse events in both groups were reported. Oral malodor was the most frequently reported adverse event in our study, followed by nausea/vomiting, which may be linked with the use of clarithromycin in the EACP-quadruple therapy. Generally speaking, the tolerance to VA-dual therapy was superior to that of the EACP-quadruple therapy.\nSeveral limitations in the present study should be noted. First of all, it was a multicenter RCT that minimized the selection bias. However, we did not use the blind method, because it was an open-label study, which may in uence the e cacy and the incidence of adverse events. Second, we did not analyze the antibiotic resistance and its potential effect on the eradication of H. pylori. Third, only Chinese patients were sampled in the present study, and the metabolism of vonoprazan and resistance to amoxicillin vary across regions. In the future, double-blind studies involving patients with H. pylori infection in different regions are needed to validate our ndings.\nConclusions The 14-day combination therapy of vonoprazan and amoxicillin increased the eradication rate of H. pylori and reduced adverse events. A rst-line eradication therapy based on one single antibiotic is recommended for eradicating H. pylori.\nDeclarations Authors\u2019 Contributions\nX. Peng and M.
