    "abstractText": "The solution enthalpy of 15-crown-5 and 18-crown-6 ethers in the mixture of formamide (F) and water (W) was measured at four temperatures: 293.15 K, 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K. The standard molar enthalpy of solution, \u2206solH, depends on the size of cyclic ethers molecules and the temperature. With increasing temperature, the values of \u2206solH become less negative. The values of the standard partial molar heat capacity Cp,2 of cyclic ethers at 298.15 K have been calculated. The Cp,2 = f (xW) curve shape indicates the hydrophobic hydration process of cyclic ethers in the range of a high-water content in the mixture with formamide. The enthalpic effect of preferential solvation of cyclic ethers was calculated and the effect of temperature on the preferential solvation process was discussed. The process of complex formation between 18C6 molecules and formamide molecules is observed. The cyclic ethers molecules are preferentially solvated by formamide molecules. The mole fraction of formamide in the solvation sphere of cyclic ethers has been calculated.",

The knowledge of the thermodynamics of the solvation process, including preferential solvation (PS) or hydrophobic hydration (HH), plays a very important role in the selection of the solvent for the chemical reaction [4]. In the mixed aqueous\u2013organic or organic\u2013organic solvents it is likely that a preferential solvation process will occur. Moreover, in water-rich mixed aqueous\u2013organic solvents a substance which shows a hydrophobic character, can be hydrophobically hydrated. The preferential solvation process is defined as a difference in the solvent components between the solvation shell and the bulk solvent [5\u20137]. The process of the preferential solvation occurring in the mixed, often multi-component solvents has been deeply investigated by many researchers [8\u201315]. Crown ethers belong to the group of compounds characterized by a hydrophobichydrophilic character. In a pure water they are hydrophobically hydrated [16,17] and in mixed water\u2013organic solvents they may be preferentially solvated by one of the components of the mixture [18]. Cyclic ethers have numerous uses including biology, medicine, or the pharmaceutical industry [19\u201325]. Crown ethers, although the most popular at the end of the 20th century, are still popular among scientists due to their wide application in various fields. This publication is a continuation of our research on the influence of the type of solvent and the temperature on the process of preferential solvation of crown ethers [16,17,26,27]. 15-crown-5 (15C5), 18-crown-6 (18C6) and a formamide-water (F + W) mixture were selected for the investigations.

In the area of high formamide content (xW < 0.1), the small decrease of the standard partial molar heat capacity with the increasing water is observed. It suggests that 18C6 interacts in a specific way with formamide. In the literature [35,36] the crystal structure of the 1:2 complex of 18C6 molecule with formamide molecules is described. There are reports on the formation of complexes of 18C6 in solution with solvents such as: nitromethane, acetonitrile, chloroform or acetone [37].

Therefore, the standard enthalpy of solution can be described by Equation (3). This equation is analogous to the equation underlying the preferential solvation model proposed by Covington et al. [44,45] and later modified by Balk and Somsen [46]. This model used for consideration in relation to cyclic ethers was discussed in detail in our previous publication [16].\n\u2206solHo(F + W) = xw\u2206solHo(W) + xF\u2206solHo(F) + (xnw \u2212 xw)Hb(W) + \u2206H\u2217(F + W) (3)\nwhere: \u2206solHo(F + W), \u2206solHo(W), \u2206solHo(F)\u2014the standard dissolution enthalpy of hydrophobic substance in the mixed solvent, in water and formamide, respectively, xF = (1\u2212 xw)\u2014the molar fraction of formamide in the mixed solvent, Hb(W)\u2014the enthalpic effect of hydrophobic hydration of the solute in pure water, (xnw \u2212 xw)Hb(W)\u2014the factor related to the hydrophobic hydration process in the mixture, \u2206H\u2217(F + W)\u2014the enthalpic effect of interactions in solution different from the hydrophobic hydration of the dissolution substance, n\u2014does not have special meaning.

Calculations of the function value were carried out using the values of parameters n and Hb(W) for 15C5 and 18C6 previously presented by us [17] in the mixture of water and N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF). For this the cage model of hydrophobic hydration proposed by Mastroianni, Pikal, and Lindenbaum [48] and the enthalpy of solution of 15C5 and 18C6 in the mixtures of formamide and water presented in this paper were used. DMF is a solvent almost neutral from the point of view of hydrophobic-hydrophilic character and in the mixture with water can be used as a solvent for the study of enthalpic effect of the hydrophobic hydration [47,48]. Using the cage model, the enthalpy of solution of hydrophobic substance (15C5 and 18C6) in the mixed solvent of DMF and water can be described by Equation (5).\n\u2206solHo(DMF + W) = (1\u2212 xw)\u2206solHo(DMF) + xw\u2206solHo(W) + (xnw \u2212 xw)Hb(W) (5)\nwhere: \u2206solHo(DMF + W), \u2206solHo(DMF), \u2206solHo(W) are the enthalpy of solution of hydrophobic substance (15C5 or 18C6) in the DMF + W mixture, in DMF and water, respectively, xw is the mol fraction of water, Hb(W) is the enthalpic effect of hydrophobic hydration of cyclic ethers in pure water, n does not have special meaning.

As seen in Figure 4, the values of function \u2206H\u2217(F + W) = f (xw) are negative within the whole mixed solvent composition range.

In addition, as shown in Figure 4, this effect decreases with increasing temperature for all investigated cyclic ethers, which is related to the increase in thermal motion of molecules and the weakening of the interactions of dissolved molecules with molecules of the mixed solvent. The analysis of the theory of preferential solvation used by us [44,45,49] can give an answer which water or formamide molecules preferentially solvate the cyclic ethers molecules. In this theory, analysis of the changes in the structure of the solute solvation sphere (S) caused by the change in the mixed solvent composition are presented. In the case when molecules of one of the components of the mixed solvent begin to dominate in the solvation sphere of the solute molecules (S), the changes can be described by a series of equilibria (Equation (6)) characterized by an equilibrium constant Ki:\nS(Wi\u22121Fr+1\u2212i) + W S(WiFr\u2212i) + F where (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r) (6)\nIt is assumed that the changes in Gibbs energy, which accompany the replacement of one F molecule with a W molecule, are the same for all the equilibria. The equilibrium constant of the i process may be expressed as follows:\nKi = K1/r[( r + 1\u2212 i)/i ]\n(7)\nwhere: K\u2014the overall constant of equilibrium of all processes, K = r\n\u03a0 i=1 Ki, r = rW + rF, where\nrw and rF are the number of W and F molecules in the solute (S) solvation shell, respectively.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2169 7 of 14\nThe enthalpic effect of the preferential solvation of the process presented by Equations (6) and (7) is described by Equation (8).\n\u2206PSHE(F + W) = rRT [{\n1\u2212 xW (1\u2212 xW) + K1/r \u00b7 xW\n} \u2212 (1\u2212 xW) ] \u00b7 ln K1/r (8)\nUsing the Equation (8) and the method of non-linear regression the values of parameters r and K1/r were calculated at four temperatures and they are presented in Table 2.\n\u00b1 is the standard deviation. R2 is the regression coefficient.\nAs is seen in Table 2, the r parameter values are higher for 18C6 than those for 15C5. For both crown ethers, r values decrease with increasing temperature similarly to 1,4-dioxane and 12C4 [16]. As seen in Table 2, the values of the parameter K1/r is lower than one within the investigated range of temperature, which means that the molecules of cyclic ether are preferentially solvated by the formamide molecules [46]. Probably the molecules of cyclic ethers interact in a specific way through hydrogen bonding with formamide molecules. Therefore, Equation (4) describing the preferential solvation process by water molecules is correct but in the opposite direction with the equilibrium constant K\u2032 = 1/K. The calculated values of K\u2032 are listed in Table 2. Considering the analogous data for 1,4-dioxane [16] and 12C4 [16], it can be seen that the equilibrium constants of the preferential solvation process increase with the increase of the ring size of the cyclic ethers and decrease with the increase of temperature. The thermodynamic function (Gibbs\u2019 energy, enthalpy and entropy) of transfer molecules of cyclic ethers from W to the mixed solvent F + W in the preferential solvation process can be calculated using the analogous procedure as presented in the paper of Balk and Somsen [46] and Equations (9)\u2013(11).\n\u2206trG(W \u2192 F + W) = \u2212rRTln[K\u22121/rxF + xW ]\n(9)\n\u2206trH(W\u2192 F + W) = rRT [\n1\u2212 xW (1\u2212 xW) + K1/rxW\n] \u00b7 ln K1/r (10)\nT\u2206trS(W\u2192 F + W)(A) = \u2212rWRT ln (\nrW rxW\n) \u2212 rFRT ln ( rF\nr(1\u2212 xW)\n) (11)\nT\u2206trS (W \u2192 F + W) (B) = \u2206trH(W \u2192 F + W)\u2212 \u2206trG(W \u2192 F + W) (12)\nUsing Equation (12) the values of T\u2206trS(W\u2192 F + W)(B) have been calculated. Then the values of the number of water molecules in the solvation sphere, rW, have been calculated using Equation (11) by choosing the rW values so that equality was met: T\u2206trS(W\u2192 F + W)(B) = T\u2206trS(W\u2192 F + W)(A). Next, the values of the number of molecules of formamide in solvation sphere, rF, and the mole fraction of formamide, yF, in the solvation sphere of 1,4-dioxane, 12C4, 15C5 and 18C6 have been calculated.

As is seen in Tables S1\u2013S16, the yF values are temperature independent (within the error) for the individual cyclic ethers and are presented in Table 3 as a mean value of yF at four temperatures. Additionally in Table 3 the mole fraction of water, xW, and formamide, xF, in the mixture W + F and in solvation sphere of cyclic ethers, yF, at T = 298.15 K is presented.\na is the mole fraction of water in the F + W mixture. b is the mole fraction of formamide in the F + W mixture. c is the mole fraction of formamide in the solvation sphere of cyclic ethers in the process of preferential solvation in the F + W mixture.\nThe uncertainty of the mole fraction xW and xF is equal to \u00b11 \u00d7 10\u22123. A graphic illustration of the relationship yF = f (xF) is shown in Figure 5. As seen in\nTable 3 and Figure 5 the mole fractions of formamide in the solvation sphere (yF) are higher than in the mole fraction of formamide in the mixture F + W (xF). Thus, it is clear that cyclic ethers are preferentially solvated by formamide molecules. Moreover, it can be observed that mole fraction of formamide in the solvation sphere decreases with the increasing cyclic ethers ring. In the case of 18C6 this is understandable as it most likely forms complexes with formamide in the solution. Probably the reason for this is the formation of complexes of 18C6 molecules with water [38\u201343] and formamide, which we wrote about in the earlier part of this work. In the case of 12C4 and 15C5, similar but weaker interactions of this type cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately, we have not found such reports in the literature. In the systems previously investigated by us (glymes + DMF + methanol [26], glymes + DMF + propan-1-ol [26] and cyclic ethers + DMF + propan-1-ol [27]) has been observed that glymes molecules are preferentially solvated by DMF molecules in the DMF + propan1-ol mixture [26], and by methanol molecules in the DMF + methanol mixture [26], as well as, the cyclic ethers molecules are preferentially solvated by DMF molecules in the DMF + propan-1-ol mixture. In the studied systems the dependence of mole fraction of the preferentially solvating solvent on the size of the solvated molecule was not observed. The mole fraction of the solvating solvent is constant (within error). We assume that the molecules of glymes and cyclic ethers do not form complexes with molecules of DMF, methanol and propan-1-ol. The shapes of the dissolution enthalpy curves and the lack of literature reports do not indicate such interactions.

The 18C6 molecules most probably form complexes with formamide molecules in the solution of the F + W mixture. The same is true for 12C4 and 15C5, but to a lesser extent. 7. The model of preferential solvation, proposed by Covington et al. and modified by Balk and Somsen can be successfully applied to quantitative analysis of systems in which dissolved molecules do not form complexes with solvent molecules. In the case when the solute molecules form complexes with the solvent molecules and are additionally preferentially solvated by the mixed solvent molecules, this model can be used but only for qualitative analysis.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28052169/s1, Table S1\u2013S4: Total number of water (W) and formamide (F) molecules in the solvation sphere of 1,4-dioxane r = (rW + rF), mole fraction of formamide (F) in the solvation sphere of the solute (yF), entropic factor of the transfer entropy of 1,4-dioxane in the process of preferential solvation at T = 293.15 K, 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K in dependency of the mole fraction of water (xW) or formamide (xF) in the mixture F + W; Table S5\u2013S8: Total number of water (W) and formamide (F) molecules in the solvation sphere of 12C4 r = (rW + rF), mole fraction of formamide (F) in the solvation sphere of the solute (yF), entropic factor of the transfer entropy of 12C4 in the process of preferential solvation at T = 293.15 K, 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K in dependency of the mole fraction of water (xW) or formamide (xF) in the mixture F + W; Table S9\u2013S12: Total number of water (W) and formamide (F) molecules in the solvation sphere of 15C5 r = (rW + rF), mole fraction of formamide (F) in the solvation sphere of the solute (yF), entropic factor of the transfer entropy of 15C5 in the process of preferential solvation at T = 293.15 K, 298.15 K, 303.15 K, 308.15 K in dependency of the mole fraction of water (xW) or formamide (xF) in the mixture F + W.
