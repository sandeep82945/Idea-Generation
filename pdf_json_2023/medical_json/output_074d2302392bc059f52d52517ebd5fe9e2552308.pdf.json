    "abstractText": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are embedded in phospholipids that strongly influence drug-stimulated signaling. Anionic lipids are particularly important for GPCR signaling complex formation, but a mechanism for this role is not understood. Using NMR spectroscopy, we explore the impact of anionic lipids on the function-related conformational equilibria of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in bilayers containing defined mixtures of zwitterionic and anionic phospholipids. Anionic lipids prime the receptor to form complexes with G proteins through a conformational selection process. Without anionic lipids, signaling complex formation proceeds through a less favorable induced fit mechanism. In computational models, anionic lipids mimic interactions between a G protein and positively charged residues in A2AAR at the receptor intracellular surface, stabilizing a pre-activated receptor conformation. Replacing these residues strikingly alters the receptor response to anionic lipids in experiments. High sequence conservation of the same residues among all GPCRs supports a general role for lipid-receptor charge complementarity in signaling.",

Jacobson 5, Edward Lyman2,7 & Matthew T. Eddy 1\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are embedded in phospholipids that strongly influence drug-stimulated signaling. Anionic lipids are particularly important for GPCR signaling complex formation, but a mechanism for this role is not understood. Using NMR spectroscopy, we explore the impact of anionic lipids on the function-related conformational equilibria of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in bilayers containing defined mixtures of zwitterionic and anionic phospholipids. Anionic lipids prime the receptor to form complexes with G proteins through a conformational selection process. Without anionic lipids, signaling complex formation proceeds through a less favorable induced fit mechanism. In computational models, anionic lipids mimic interactions between a G protein and positively charged residues in A2AAR at the receptor intracellular surface, stabilizing a pre-activated receptor conformation. Replacing these residues strikingly alters the receptor response to anionic lipids in experiments. High sequence conservation of the same residues among all GPCRs supports a general role for lipid-receptor charge complementarity in signaling.\nThe essential roles of lipids as key regulators of the structures and functions of membrane proteins are well established1\u20137. For the 826 human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mounting evidence documented in the literature has increasingly highlighted the critical roles of lipids in regulating ligand-induced cellular signaling, both through their bulk physical properties, such as membrane curvature8, and as specific chemical partners acting as orthosteric ligands9,10 or as allosteric modulators11\u201313.\nRecent structural and biophysical studies point to special roles of anionic lipids in regulating GPCR activity. Biochemical data indicated anionic lipids strongly influenced selectivity of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) for different G proteins through lipid-protein charge\ncomplementarity14, and anionic lipids impacted the affinity and efficacy of \u03b22AR ligands\n11. Anionic lipids, including POPS, were found to be critical for activation of the CB2 cannabinoid receptor\n15. Mass spectrometry data supported the role of the anionic phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) stabilizing complexes of human GPCRs with their partner G proteins16. Anionic phospholipids such as PIP2 have also been observed bound to the human serotonin receptor 5-HT1A in cryoelectronmicroscopy structures17, supporting the idea that direct lipidprotein interactions modulate receptor activity.\nKnowledge of GPCR structural plasticity is critical to developing an understanding of signaling mechanisms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is well-suited to experimentally investigate\nReceived: 10 August 2022\nAccepted: 31 January 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Chemistry, College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, University of Florida, 126 Sisler Hall, Gainesville, FL, USA. 2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA. 3Department of Pharmacodynamics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. 4Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. 5Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Instituteof Diabetes andDigestive andKidneyDiseases, National Institutes ofHealth, Bethesda,Maryland 20892,USA. 6Translational DrugDevelopmentCore, Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA. 7Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA. 8These authors contributed equally: Naveen Thakur, Arka P.

We leveraged this capability to investigate the impact of anionic lipids on the structural plasticity of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), a representative class A GPCR and exemplary GPCR for investigating receptor-lipid interactions. Our investigation builds on accumulated data from NMR spectroscopic studies of A2AAR interactions with small molecule ligands\n12,20\u201326, providing a firm foundation for evaluating the impact of anionic lipids. In both mass spectrometry experiments16 and molecular dynamics simulations27, anionic lipids were observed to strongly influence the formation of A2AAR signaling complexes. However, amechanistic basis for these observations has not been determined.\nUsing nanodiscs, we precisely controlled phospholipid composition to investigate the response of A2AAR over a wide range of defined binary lipid mixtures. In 19F-NMR data, we observed the impact of anionic lipids on the conformational equilibria of A2AAR to be of a similar magnitude as bound drugs. Synergy observed between the presence of anionic lipids and efficacy of bound drugs indicated that sensitivity to lipid composition depended on the receptor conformation. In both NMR experiments and computational models, positively charged residues on the A2AAR intracellular surface near regions that interact with partner signaling proteins appeared to facilitate the influence of anionic lipids. Integrating these data with correlative signaling assays and NMR experiments of judiciously selected A2AAR variants provided a mechanistic view on the role of lipids in A2AAR signaling. Key residues identified in these experiments are conserved among not only class A but all receptor classes, indicating this mechanism may be shared across the GPCR superfamily."

            "text": "Molecular recognition of drug compounds by A2AAR investigated across a wide range of phospholipid compositions We expressed human A2AAR containing a single extrinsic cysteine introduced into position 289, A2AAR[A289C] (Supplementary Fig. 1). The extrinsic cysteine, located near the intracellular-facing surface of transmembrane (TM) helix VII, was introduced for 19F-NMR experiments, and this A2AAR variant was previously shown to retain pharmacological activity of the native receptor22,28. Purified A2AAR[A289C] was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs formed with the membrane scaffold protein MSP1D129 containing defined binary mixtures of different molar ratios of zwitterionic phospholipids, POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) or POPE (1- palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), and anionic lipids, POPS (1-palmitoyl- 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine), POPA (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate), POPG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)) or PI(4,5)P2 (1,2- dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-myo-inositol-4',5'-biphosphate)). Analytical characterization of purified lipid nanodiscs containing A2AAR[A289C] showed highly monodispersed and homogenous samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). 31P-NMR in aqueous solutions was used to verify the lipid composition within the nanodisc samples studied in subsequent biophysical and NMR spectroscopy experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2). As the lipid headgroups showed resolved signals with unique chemical shifts, the intensities of the observed 31P signals were used to quantify the relative amounts of each lipid species present. For all samples and for all employed lipids, the relative amounts of each lipid species in the nanodisc samples determined by 31P-NMR closely agreedwith the amounts we intended to incorporate in the nanodiscs (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nTo confirm that A2AAR[A289C] was folded in nanodiscs across the rangeof studied lipid compositions,we recordedfluorescence thermal shift assays for A2AAR[A289C] in complex with the antagonist ZM241385 and the agonist NECA (5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) in\nnanodiscs composed of a wide range of different binary mixtures of zwitterionic and anionic lipids. The assay employed a thiol-reactive dye, N-[4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)phenyl]maleimide (CPM), which reacts with cysteines that become solvent accessible upon thermal denaturation30. As the nanodisc scaffold proteinMSP1D1 contains no cysteines, the assay thus observed a direct response of the thermal unfolding of the receptor. In nanodiscs containingmixtures of different relative amounts of POPC and POPS, we observed thermal unfolding curves consistent with well-folded receptors for both complexes with the antagonist ZM241385 (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and complexes with the agonist NECA (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Interestingly, as the molar fraction of POPS increased, the observed thermal melting temperature of A2AAR[A289C] also increased by ~10 \u00b0C from nanodiscs containing only POPC to nanodiscs containing only POPS (Supplementary Fig. 3a). This overall trend was also observed for A2AAR[A289C] in nanodiscs composed of different ratios of POPE and POPS, and POPC with POPA or POPG (Supplementary Fig. 3b), though the trend was most pronounced for nanodiscs containing mixtures of POPC or POPE mixed with POPS. Further, the increase in melting temperature associated with increasing amounts of anionic lipids was observed for both the complex with an antagonist and the complex with an agonist (Supplementary Fig. 3b). To confirm the fluorescence shift assay reported specifically on the thermal unfolding of the receptor within formed nanodiscs rather than disassembly of the nanodiscs, we recorded variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) data of nanodiscs without receptor (Supplementary Fig. 4). These data showed the thermal unfolding of the nanodiscs containing only lipids was >90 \u00b0C, the upper limit of our instrument, confirming the fluorescence thermal shift data reported specifically on the unfolding of the receptor. These data appear in line with earlier observations from differential scanning calorimetry measurements, which reported nanodiscs containing binarymixtures of lipids remained assembled up to temperatures from 90 \u00b0C to over 105 \u00b0C31.\nThe pharmacological activity of A2AAR[A289C] in lipid nanodiscs containing different binary lipidmixtures wasmeasured in radioligand competition binding assays for both complexes with the antagonist ZM241385 and the agonist NECA. KD values were determined in nanodiscs containing only POPC lipids andmixtures of POPC with one of three different anionic lipids.Measured KD values for the antagonist ZM241385 varied only by a factor of ~2 among the different lipid compositions (Supplementary Fig. 5). Measured KI values for the agonist NECA varied only by a factor of ~3 among different lipid compositions (Supplementary Fig. 5). These relatively small differences indicatedA2AAR[A289C] is pharmacologically active in the range of lipid compositions studied and, the presence of anionic lipids appeared to not impose a significant difference on the pharmacological activity of A2AAR.\nThe conformational ensemble of activated A2AAR strongly depends on the membrane environment To prepare samples for NMR studies, a 19F-NMR reporter group was introduced by reacting the solvent-accessible cysteine at position 289 with 2,2,2-trifluoroethanethiol (TET) using an in-membrane chemical modification approach32, yielding A2AAR[A289C\nTET]. Earlier studies employing both the same stable-isotope labeling methodology and A2AAR variant demonstrated no other cysteines were available for 19F labeling22. The A289C 19F-NMR reporter was highly sensitive to function-related changes in the efficacies of bound drugs, providing \u2018fingerprints\u2019 for the corresponding functional states22.\n19F-NMR spectra of A2AAR[A289C TET] in DDM (n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-DMaltopyranoside)/ CHS (cholesteryl hemisuccinate) mixed micelles with receptor prepared from Pichia pastoris (Fig. 1a) were in overall good agreement with 19F-NMR spectra reported for the same A2AAR variant expressed in insect cells and solubilized with the same detergent22. The present spectrum of an A2AAR[A289C TET] complex\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:794 2\nwith the antagonist ZM241385 contained two signals at \u03b4 \u2248 11.3 ppm (P3) and \u03b4 \u2248 9.5 ppm (P1) with the signal P3 being the dominant signal in the spectrum (Fig. 1a). 19F spectraof theA2AAR[A289C\nTET] complexwith the agonist NECA contained a signal at the chemical shift of P1 and two new signals, P2 and P4, at \u03b4 \u2248 10.7 ppm and \u03b4 \u2248 13.1 ppm, respectively, and no signal intensity at the chemical shift for P3 (Fig. 1a).\nWe prepared samples of A2AAR[A289C TET] in lipid nanodiscs formed with the membrane scaffold protein MSP1D1 containing a mixture of the zwitterionic lipid POPC and anionic lipid POPS at a molar ratio of 70 to 30, respectively. 19F-NMR spectra of A2AAR[A289C\nTET] in nanodiscs with this ratio of lipid species showed the same number of signals with highly similar chemical shifts as observed in 19F-NMR spectra of A2AAR[A289C\nTET] in detergent micelles for both antagonist-bound and agonist-bound receptors (Fig. 1b). Only a small difference was observed for the chemical shift of state P3 for A2AAR in complex with the antagonist ZM241385, \u03b4 \u2248 10.9 ppm in lipid nanodiscs versus \u03b4 \u2248 11.3 ppm in detergent micelles (Fig. 1). Chemical shifts for states P1, P2, and P4 were practically indistinguishable\nbetween A2AAR[A289C TET] in DDM/CHS micelles and the POPC/POPS lipid nanodisc preparation. The highly similar chemical shifts observed for complexes in DDM/CHS mixed micelles and POPC/POPS lipid nanodiscs indicates that the introduced 19F-NMR probe is responsive to changes in receptor conformation rather than changes in the employed membrane mimetic.\nThe highly similar chemical shifts between A2AAR[A289C TET] in DDM/CHS micelles and the POPC/POPS lipid nanodisc preparation allowed us to quantitatively compare relative peak intensities between the two different membrane mimetics to investigate the impact of the membrane environment on the fingerprint of A2AAR functional states. For the complex with the antagonist ZM241385, the relative peak intensities for P1 and P3 were onlymarginally different between A2AAR in detergent and A2AAR in lipid nanodiscs (Fig. 1a). Ratios of peak intensities for apo A2AAR were also highly similar between detergent and lipid nanodisc environments (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, we observed striking differences in the relative intensities of peaks for the A2AAR complex with agonist. State P4, observed only for agonist-\nFig. 1 | NMR-observed conformational states of A2AAR-ligand complexes compared in twodifferentmembranemimetics. aThe 1-dimensional 19F-NMR spectra of A2AAR[A289C TET] reconstituted into DDM/CHSmixedmicelles and in complexes with the antagonist ZM241385 and agonist NECA.

State P1, whichwas the dominant peak observed in DDM/CHS, showed an intensity of nearly a factor of 4 smaller for POPC/POPS nanodiscs (Fig. 1b). The large differences in relative peak intensities were observed only for agonist-bound A2AAR, indicating a synergy between drug efficacy and the surrounding membrane environment. The ratio of populations of individual conformers for agonist-bound A2AAR is highly sensitive to changes in the surrounding membrane environment, but not for antagonist-bound A2AAR, as quantified in Fig. 1c. We also observed different rates of conformational exchange between A2AAR in DDM/CHSmicelles and in lipid nanodiscs in 2-dimensional [19F,19F]-exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) (Supplementary Fig. 7). In the 2D-EXSY spectrum recordedwith agonist-bound A2AAR in POPC/POPS lipid nanodiscs, we did not observe the presence of any crosspeaks. This is in contrast to previously reported EXSY spectra of agonist-bound A2AAR in DDM/CHS micelles that reported exchange crosspeaks between peaks P1 and P222, indicating the rate of exchange for populations P1 and P2must be at least an order of magnitude slower in lipid nanodiscs.\nAgonist-bound A2AAR adopts a predominantly inactive conformation in the absence of anionic lipids To investigate the impact of anionic lipids on the observed conformational ensemble for A2AAR-agonist complexes, we recorded 19F-NMRdata with A2AAR[A289C\nTET] bound to the agonist NECA in lipid nanodiscs containing only the zwitterionic phospholipid POPC (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, we observed a conformational ensemble that more closely resembled the fingerprint of inactive A2AAR even though a saturating amount of agonist was present, showing a dominant peak P3 and minor populations of peaks P1 and P2 (Fig. 2a). Fluorescence thermal shift assays of the A2AAR-agonist complex in POPC showed a wellfolded protein (Supplementary Fig. 3), and radioligand binding experiments showed A2AAR in POPC nanodiscs bound the agonist NECA with a measured dissociation constant that was only a factor of ~2.5 times different from nanodiscs containing POPC and POPS (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, the 19F-NMR data show a conformational ensemble of functional, agonist-bound A2AAR largely in an inactive\nconformation. This indicates that even in the presence of saturating amounts of an activating drug, A2AAR adopts predominantly an inactive conformation in the absence of anionic lipids. 19F-NMR data of the A2AAR[A289C\nTET]-agonist complex in POPC nanodiscs measured at the higher temperature of 300K were highly similar to spectra measured at 280K with only a minor increase in the population of state P4 (Supplementary Fig. 8).\nTo test whether A2AAR in POPC nanodiscs could still form signaling complexes, we added to the same sample the engineered G\u03b1S protein, \u2018mini-G\u03b1S\u2019, a partner protein designed to induce conformational changes in ternary complexes with A2AAR that mimic those of the native G\u03b1S protein\n33,34. Analytical size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the formation of a the A2AAR ternary complex with NECA and mini-G\u03b1S (Supplementary Fig. 9).\n19F-NMR data ofA2AAR[A289C\nTET] in POPCnanodiscs showeda clear response to the addition of mini-G\u03b1S (Fig. 2b). The NMR data appeared qualitatively similar to data measured for agonist-bound A2AAR in nanodiscs containing POPC and POPS, where the population of state P3 was significantly reduced and the populations of states P2 and P4, specific to the agonist complex, increased (Fig. 2b). This data allowed us to unambiguously assign the identity of state P4 to a conformation of activated A2AAR in the ternary complex. However, for the ternary complex, the relative population of state P4 was ~1/3 to 1/4 of the intensity of P4 observed for A2AAR-agonist complex in POPC/POPS nanodiscs. This indicated that while A2AAR could still populate a fully active conformation, the much lower P4 signal intensity indicated that the corresponding population was much lower than that observed for A2AAR-agonist in the presenceof POPS even in the absence of a partner signaling protein (Fig. 1b).\nA2AAR activation depends on lipid headgroup charge rather than chemical scaffold To investigate whether observations in Fig. 2 were specific to POPS or applied more generally to additional anionic lipids, we prepared a series of agonist-bound A2AAR samples in nanodiscs containing binary mixtures of POPC and a second, different anionic lipid. 19F-NMRdata of agonist-boundA2AARwere all qualitatively highly similar for nanodiscs containing POPC mixed with one type of anionic lipid, including with POPS, POPA, POPG, or PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3b). In all mixtures of POPC with anionic lipids, we saw a significant population of the peak P4 corresponding to activated A2AAR (Fig. 3b). To also investigate the possibility that POPC played a special role in the binary mixtures, we recordedNMRdatawith agonist-boundA2AAR in nanodiscs containing POPE mixed with POPS. NMR data with these samples was highly similar to samples prepared with POPC and POPS, showing the presence of activated A2AAR with a population that increased proportionally with increasing amounts of anionic lipids (Supplementary\nFig. 10). These data support that activation of agonist-bound A2AAR could be achieved in the presence of any anionic lipid studied regardless of the phospholipid headgroup chemical structure.We also determined the integrals of each peak from the deconvolutions of all the spectra and tabulated these values as a fraction of the total integrated signal intensities (SupplementaryTable 1). For all spectra shown in Fig. 3b we observed comparable integrated intensities for states, with the state P4 showing the largest fraction in the presence of PIP2 (Supplementary Table 1).We also observed larger linewidths for states P4 and P2 for the A2AAR agonist complex in nanodiscs containing mixtures of POPC and POPA, suggesting the active state exhibits a larger degree of structural plasticity for this lipid composition.\nPositively charged amino acids at the A2AAR intracellular surface of TM VI direct lipid-induced conformational changes Our 19F data showed anionic lipids impacted the conformational ensemble of agonist-bound but not antagonist-bound A2AAR. We therefore hypothesized positively charged residues located near the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:794 4\nintracellular surface that show significant differences in conformation between active and inactive states could play important roles mediating the impact of anionic lipids. We identified 4 positively charged residues predictedby theOrientation of Proteins inMembranes (OPM) database35 to be near the lipid-bilayer boundary: R1995.60, H2306.32, K2336.35 and R2917.56 (superscripts denote the Ballesteros-Weinstein\nnomenclature36) and in different conformations between agonistbound and antagonist-bound A2AAR crystal structures (Fig. 4a). Though our experiments were carried out at neutral pH, H2306.32 has been proposed to be positively charged37 and was thus included in the current study. Positively charged amino acids are frequently found in position 6.32 in other GPCRs (see Discussion).\nWepreparedA2AAR variants by individually replacing eachof these four residues with the polar but neutral amino acid glutamine. Each of the resulting variants was folded and demonstrated closely similar pharmacological activity compared with native A2AAR (Supplementary\nFig. 11). In thermal shift assays, the variants also showed an increase in melting temperature with increasing amounts of anionic lipids, similar to A2AAR[A289C] (Supplementary Fig. 11). For two of the variants, A2AAR[A289C TET,R199Q] and A2AAR[A289C TET,R291Q], 19F-NMR spectra for complexes with the agonist NECA were similar to the data of A2AAR[A298C TET] in both nanodiscs containing POPC or a mixture of 70/30 POPC/POPS (Fig. 4b). For A2AAR[A289C TET,R291Q], state P4 showed a higher relative intensity in nanodiscs containing 70/30 POPC/POPS but the same overall response to the presence of anionic lipids as A2AAR[A289C TET].\nFor the two variants with mutations in helix VI, A2AAR [A289CTET,H230Q] and A2AAR[A289C TET,K233Q], we observed a completely different response to the presence of anionic lipids and in striking contrast to A2AAR[A289C\nTET]. In the absence of anionic lipids, the 19F NMR spectra of these two variants in complex with the agonist NECA resembled the spectra of A2AAR[A289C\nTET] measured in the presence of anionic lipids (Fig. 4). 19F spectra of A2AAR [A289CTET,H230Q] and A2AAR[A289C\nTET,K233Q] in complex with NECA and in nanodiscs containing a mixture of POPC and POPS (70:30) appeared similar to spectra of inactive A2AAR[A298C\nTET] (Fig. 4). Intriguingly the individual mutations in Helix VI appeared to completely reverse the sensitivity of A2AAR to anionic lipids.\nWe tested signaling complex formation with A2AAR [A289CTET,K233Q] with mini G\u03b1S in nanodiscs containing POPC and POPS (70:30). Upon addition of mini-G\u03b1S,\n19F-NMR spectra showed the presence of the state P4 (Supplementary Fig. 12), indicating complex formation can still occur for this variant. Cyclic AMP accumulation assays showed dose-dependent responses to agonists for the four A2AAR variants were similar to wild-type A2AAR (Supplementary\nFig. 13), with A2AAR[A289C TET,R291Q] showing a measurably higher basal level of activity, consistent with the relatively higher signal intensity for peak P4 in 19F-NMR data (Fig. 4). Consideration of the 19F-NMR data and correlative functional experiments together indicates anionic lipids may not be strictly required for A2AAR activation but shift the conformational equilibria toward a fully active conformation even in the absence of a partner G protein.\nAnionic lipids prepare A2AAR to recognize intracellular G proteins To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which anionic lipids modulated A2AAR activation, a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were implemented with several different A2AAR conformations and with different lipid compositions. We first noted H2306.32, K2336.35 and R2917.56 form a triad that coordinates engagement with mini-G\u03b1S through interactions with glutamic acid in the end of the \u03b15 helix of mini-G\u03b1S at position 392 (Fig. 5). The difference between inactive and the fully active G protein-coupled\nFig. 3 | A2AAR conformational response to the presence of anionic lipids with varying chemical scaffolds. a A 1D 19F-NMR spectrum of the antagonistA2AAR[A289C TET] complex in lipid nanodiscs containing a mixture of POPC and POPS lipids. b The 1D 19F NMR spectra of an agonist-A2AAR[A289CTET] complex in lipid nanodiscs containing either only POPC lipids or amixtureof POPC and anionic lipids, as indicated on the right of each spectrum.

For the A2AAR complexwithmini-G\u03b1S, themedian of this distance distribution shifts toward longer distances and the distribution broadens (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). We hypothesized that negatively charged headgroups of anionic phospholipids mimic interactions of E392 in mini-G\u03b1S, preorganizing the intracellular face for engaging with the G protein. To test this, we simulated the fully active receptor but withoutmini-G\u03b1S. Simulations were initialized from the A2AAR ternary complex with the agonist NECA and mini-G\u03b1S (PDB ID 5G53)\n33 and then deleting the mini-G\u03b1S in-silico and allowing lipids to access the G protein-binding interface. Simulations were first performed with the backbone of the protein\nrestrained to keep it close to the fully active receptor. In simulated membranes containing only POPC, the median H2306.32 and R2917.56 distance for agonist-bound A2AAR is similar to that observed for the A2AAR inactive state (Fig. 5)\u2014a surprising result, given that the backbone of the protein is kept close to the fully active state by the restraints. In contrast, in the presence of POPS the median H2306.32 and R2917.56 distance shifts to longer distance, as a PS headgroup intercalates between H2306.32 and R2917.56 (Fig. 5 bottom right panel). If the restraints are then released and the simulation continued, the median H2306.32 and R2917.56 distance shifts to still longer distances (Fig. 5b, blue arrow), mimicking the G\u03b1S protein-bound state.

            "text": "Results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 are intriguing in the context of literature data on the influence of phospholipids on GPCR activity. In earlier spectrophotometric studies of rhodopsin, anionic lipids shifted the equilibrium of intermediate activation states38. In studies of \u03b22AR signaling, anionic lipids impacted the preference of the receptor to interact with G\u03b1i over G\u03b1s through lipid-G protein charge complementarity14. IC50 values for\u03b22AR ligands varied amongdifferent lipid compositions in nanodiscs by a factor of ~3 for antagonists and ~7 for agonists11, though no clear relationshipwas observed between lipid headgroup type and measured IC50 values. In the present work, we observed a variation in KD values of the antagonist ZM241385 and agonist NECA among different lipid compositions by a factor of ~2 and ~3, respectively, also with no obvious correlation between lipid headgroup and determined KD value (Supplementary Fig. 5). Our data are more in line with earlier observations of the neurotensin 1 receptor, which reported similar binding affinities of the agonist neurotensin in nanodiscs containing either POPC ormixtures of POPC and POPG39. As allNMRsamples employed a saturating amountof ligand, the relatively small differences among KD values do not explain the striking differences observed in 19F spectra observedbetweennanodisc preparations containing only zwitterionic lipids versus amixture of zwitterionic and anionic lipids (Fig. 3). Thus, observed differences in our NMR data between different lipid compositions must be due to lipid-dependent changes in the A2AAR conformational equilibria.\nComparing spectra from Figs. 1 and 2, anionic lipids appear to not be strictly required for A2AAR complex formationwithmini-G\u03b1S, rather they shift the conformational equilibria to favor a fully active A2AAR conformer. 19F-NMR data of agonist-bound A2AAR[A289C,K233Q]\nshow this variant can still form signaling complexes even though an active state P4 is not observed in nanodiscs containing anionic lipids. These data are consistent with the cAMP functional data (Supplementary Fig. 13) and support a model whereby anionic lipids control themechanism of A2AAR-G protein recognition (Fig. 6). In the absence of anionic lipids, A2AAR can form signaling complexes through an induced fit mechanism. In the presence of anionic lipids, a fully active receptor conformation is populated, leading to a conformational selection process directing complex formation (Fig. 6). Thus, anionic lipids appear to \u201cprime\u201d A2AAR for complex formation with partner proteins. This priming effect is reminiscent of earlier studies that proposed G proteins could synergistically prime a receptor for coupling with other G protein subtypes40.\nIn earlier 19F-NMR studies22 and in the present study, the presence of state P4 is also observed for agonist-bound A2AAR inmixedmicelles composed of DDM and CHS (Fig. 1). Since the pKA of the carboxylic acid group of CHS is ~5.8, at the pH value of 7 used for samples in the current study we anticipate the vastmajority of CHSmolecules should be negatively charged, consistent with earlier experiments with CHS41. We therefore hypothesize that the negative charge on CHSmaymimic the impact observed on the conformational equilibria of A2AAR by the negative charges for anionic lipids.\nOur data and proposed mechanism provide an opportunity to evaluate experimental results in the context of observations from computational modeling. MD simulations of A2AAR in complex with mini-G\u03b1S indicated PIP2 strengthened interactions within the complex by \u201cbridging\u201dbetween basic residues of A2AAR andmini-G\u03b1S\n27. 19F-NMR spectra of A2AAR in nanodiscs containing 5% PIP2 and in the absenceof partner G protein show the presence of fully active A2AAR (Fig. 3), suggesting PIP2 may also enhance complex formation by populating a fully active receptor conformation prior to complex formation and playmultiple roles in stabilizing the active complex. InMD simulations\nFig. 5 | A2AAR-lipid interactions observed in molecular dynamics simulations.\nDistance distribution between H2306.32 and R2917.56 shifts to farther distance (red arrow, panel \u2018a\u2019) when the receptor switches from the inactive state (panel \u2018a\u2019, black) to the fully active, G protein-coupled state (panel \u2018a\u2019, red). When simulated in the fully active state but without the G-protein and no POPS (and with the backbone restrained to stay close to the fully active state), the H2306.32 to R2917.56 distance distribution (panel \u2018b\u2019, black) is similar to the inactive state, but the shift to longer distances is partially recapitulated (red arrow, panel \u2018b\u2019) when simulated in a membrane containing 85% phosphatidyl serine (panel \u2018b\u2019, red). Upon release of the\nbackbone restraints the 85% PS simulation shifts to longer distances (blue arrow, panel \u2018b\u2019), with a distribution very similar to the fully active, G-protein coupled system. Inspection of the structures representative of the most likely distance for each case reveals that when the H2306.32 to R2917.56 distance is shorter, reflecting an inactive-like state, H2306.32, K2336.35 R2917.56 form a tight cluster (far left panels, top and bottom).When the distance is longer, reflecting an active-like state, this cluster is split, and coordinates a glutamic acid from the\u03b15 helix of theG-protein (top right panel), or a PS headgroup in the absence of G-protein (lower right panel).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:794 7\nof \u03b22AR 38 and A2AAR 37, active conformations of the receptors were proposed to be stabilized by increasing the receptor affinity for agonists and interactionswithmembrane-facing residues in TM6andTM7. In contrast, experimentally we observed only relatively smaller differences in agonist binding among different lipid compositions, and we also propose that penetration of anionic lipids into the G protein binding site is important to stabilizing an active A2AAR conformation (Fig. 5).\nConservation of basic residues in helix VI among class A GPCRs and GPCRs from all classes suggest the present observations may extend to many additional receptors. Using structure-based alignment tools in GPCRdb42,43, we compared sequences of GPCRs among class A and among all classes. In class A receptors, one of these three residues is observed at position 6.32 or 6.35 with frequencies of 75.5% and 59.3%, respectively (Fig. 7 and Table 1). Expanding this search to include 1 position before or after these positions increases the frequency to 88.3% and 64.5%. In the opioid receptor family, position 6.32 is an arginine and has been noted to be critical for the activation of Gi signaling by the mu opioid receptor44. Conservation of a positively charged amino acid is also observed among the 402 non-olfactory GPCRs from all families. Notably, for class F GPCRs, either an arginine or lysine is always found in position 6.32 and mutations to a non-positively charged amino acid destroy G protein signaling45. In class B receptors, position 6.35 is typically a lysine and is noted to be critical for receptor activation46. Our study suggests that lipid-receptor interactions may play a critical role in regulating the drug response and activity of GPCRs across all receptor families."

ZM241385 and NECA binding affinities (KD or KI) were determined using competition binding experiments. Specific binding of A2AAR and A2AAR variants were determined as the difference in binding obtained in the absence and presence of 10 \u00b5M ZM241385. Radioligand experiments were conducted in triplicate and IC50 values determined using a nonlinear, least-square regression analysis (Prism 8; GraphPad Software, Inc.).

For the latter simulation, production simulations were run with the backbone heavy atoms softly restrained to stay close to the fully active state by harmonic restraintswith a 0.5 kJ/mol/\u00c52 spring constant. The T4-lysozyme was removed from the inactive structure and initial coordinates for residues 209-219 were obtained from the structure of a thermostabilized A2AAR variant mutant (PDB: 3PWH)\n54 for which those residues are resolved. The N- and C-termini were capped with the default chemistry in the CHARMM force-field, a primary amine at the N-terminus and a carboxylate at the C-terminus.\nAll simulations were performed with Gromacs 2020.4. Each system was prepared individually for production simulation using the CHARMMGUImembrane builder tools55. The proteinwas embedded in a mixture of POPS and POPC (Supplementary Table 3), solvated with TIP3P water56, neutralized with Na+ ions if needed, and NaCl added to bring the ionic strength to 150mM. Lipids and protein were modeled with the CHARMM36 force field57,58; ligands were modeled with the CHARMMgeneral force field59. Final system sizes were at least 15 nm in each dimension, yielding lipid-to-protein ratios of ~750:1.\nEach system was prepared individually for production simulation through a series of 6 minimization and heating steps: (i) steepest descent to minimize the initial configuration; (ii) 125,000 steps of leapfrog dynamics with a 1 fsec timestep and velocities reassigned every 500 steps; (iii) 125,000 steps of leapfrog dynamics with a 1 fsec timestep, pressure controlled by the Parinello-Rahman barostat60 and velocities reassigned every 500 steps, then a total of 750,000 steps of leapfrog dynamics with a 2 fsec timestep and hydrogen positions constrained by LINCS61, pressure controlled by the Parinello-Rahman barostat, and velocities reassigned every 500 steps. During equilibration, double bonds were restrained in the cis configuration to prevent isomerization; these restraints are gradually reduced during the final three stages of the equilibration protocol. Production simulations (NPT ensemble) were integrated with leapfrog using the ParinelloRahman barostat to control pressure (time constant 5 psec; compressibility 4.5e\u22125 bar\u22121; coupled anisotropically to allow independent fluctuation of the in-plane and normal directions) and temperature controlled using Nose-Hoover62 (time constant 1 psec) at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C. Hydrogens were constrained with LINCS (expansion order 4), a 2 fsec timestep was used, short range electrostatics were computed directly within 1.2 nm, and long-range electrostatics were computed every timestep using particle mesh Ewald63 with a grid spacing of 1 \u00c5 and cubic interpolation. Long range dispersion was smoothly truncated over 10-12 nm using a force-switch cutoff scheme. Residue-residue distances as reported in Fig. 5 were measured between the closest sidechain nitrogen atoms in H2306.32 and R2917.56.\ncAMP accumulation assays Plasmids encoding wild-type or variant human A2A adenosine receptors were transfected into CHO-K1 cells (ATCC product CCL-61) using lipofectamine 2000.

Cellswere then treated with assay buffer containing rolipram (10 \u00b5M) and adenosine deaminase (3 units/ml) for 30min followed by addition of agonist and incubated for 20min. The reaction was terminated upon removal of the supernatant, and addition of 100 \u00b5l Tween-20 (0.3%).
