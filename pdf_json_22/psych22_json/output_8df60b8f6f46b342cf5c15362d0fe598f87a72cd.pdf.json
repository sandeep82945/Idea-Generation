    "abstractText": "The present research focused on bottom-up, proactive employee behaviors and personal resources that can contribute to more engagement and optimal functioning at work. Based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) and Conservation of Resources (COR) theories, we tested direct and interactive relationships between strengths use (SU), daily proactive vitality management (PVM), and daily work engagement (WE). Eighty-seven (N = 87) employees from a multinational company completed self-reported questionnaires at the beginning of the study and throughout five consecutive workdays (N = 358), yielding a multilevel dataset. We have found a significant daily positive relationship between PVM and WE, which showed significant inter-individual variation and was significantly enhanced by SU at the individual level. This study showed that PVM as employee-initiated proactive behavior and SU as a proactive personal resource facilitate engagement independently but yield the strongest results when used together, suggesting an interactive mechanism between bottom-up effects postulated in the JD-R theory.",

Based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) and\nConservation of Resources (COR) theories, we\u00a0 tested direct and interactive\nrelationships between strengths use (SU), daily proactive vitality management\n(PVM), and daily work engagement (WE). Eighty-seven (N = 87) employees\nfrom a multinational company completed self-reported questionnaires at the\nbeginning of the study and throughout five consecutive workdays (N = 358),\nyielding a multilevel dataset. We\u00a0 have found a significant daily positive\nrelationship between PVM and WE, which showed significant inter-individual\nvariation and was significantly enhanced by SU at the individual level. This\nstudy showed that PVM as employee-initiated proactive behavior and SU as a\nproactive personal resource facilitate engagement independently but yield the\nstrongest results when used together, suggesting an interactive mechanism\nbetween bottom-up effects postulated in the JD-R theory.\nKEYWORDS\nproactive vitality management, strength use, work engagement, diary study, JD-R theory\n1. Introduction\nPredicting employee engagement has had tremendous success in the past, mostly driven by the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). Work engagement (WE) entails experiencing the work as an activity that individuals want to \u201cdevote time and effort to\u201d (vigor), perceive as being \u201csignificant and meaningful\u201d (dedication), and carry out \u201cfully concentrated and engrossed in it\u201d (absorption; Bakker, 2014, p.\u00a02). Research guided by the JD-R theory showed that organizations need to enrich the resources employees rely on in order to be\u00a0fully engaged (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). However, technological developments (i.e., virtual work) and changes in the nature of work (i.e., remote work) have raised the issue that employees need to take more responsibility for their work outcomes and progress (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018). This has put the employee center stage, creating a need for research that highlights how employees are active and\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 15 December 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1015397"

PVM is defined as \u201cgoal-oriented behavior aimed at managing physical and mental energy to promote optimal functioning at work\u201d (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018, p.\u00a010). PVM includes self-initiated and goal-oriented behaviors that involve generating energy resources proactively instead of reacting to already depleted energy after periods of work (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018). In this sense, it is a distinct concept from related ones, such as recovery experiences (e.g., relaxing and recovering through leisure activities; Sonnentag and Fritz, 2007) and micro-breaks (e.g., surfing the internet, discussing with colleagues; Fritz et\u00a0al., 2011) which are meant to restore energy and attention that has been already depleted. Recent research has generated enthusiasm toward PVM since initial investigations linked it to higher creativity (Op den Kamp et\u00a0 al., 2020), entrepreneurial performance (Tisu and V\u00eerg\u0103, 2022), and task performance (Bakker, 2017). Based on Bakker et\u00a0al. (2020) work, we\u00a0argue that employees who proactively build energy, inspiration, and motivation at work, consciously managing their own energetic, affective, and cognitive resources during the day, can facilitate their daily WE.\nResearch has also highlighted significant person-level moderators that can shape the efficiency of such proactive energy management strategies (e.g., goal orientation, Bakker et\u00a0al., 2020; self-insight, Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2020). Inspired by this literature, we\u00a0propose that strengths use (SU) could constitute a person-level moderator of the daily relationship between PVM and WE. SU represents employees\u2019 initiative to use their strengths more often to complete work (van Woerkom et\u00a0al., 2016). Strengths are trait-like characteristics (Wood et\u00a0al., 2011), and SU can be\u00a0conceptualized as a personal resource, representing a dispositional or habitual behavior (Kira et\u00a0al., 2010) to use one\u2019s strengths to perform at work. From the perspective of the Conservation of Resources theory (COR; Hobfoll, 2011), SU as a personal resource can help employees create and/or attract other resources into a resource caravan (Chu et\u00a0al., 2022; Ding and Lin, 2020). Empirical work has supported this assertion, showing that SU is connected to higher self-efficacy (Meyers and van Woerkom, 2017), person-job fit (Kooij et\u00a0al., 2017), and positive affect (Meyers and van Woerkom, 2017). SU could represent a possible facilitator of the positive effects of PVM (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018) due to its\u2019 potential to create resourceful conditions for \u201ccan do\u201d (through feelings of efficacy), \u201creason to\u201d (through alignment of the job with ones\u2019 values and skills), and \u201cenergized to\u201d (through positive affect) motivational states that prompt, proactive goal generation and aid self-regulation in striving to achieve those goals (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010). This conceptualization of SU as a personal resource being dispositional and habitual implies stability in the construct, representing a person-level characteristic that varies across employees. PVM, on the other hand, is strongly tied to the responsibilities and workflow of any specific day, making it a variable that we\u00a0 can expect to show significant daily variability within\nemployees (Bakker et\u00a0 al., 2020). Adopting a diary design and building a multilevel model whereby intra-individual variation in PVM represents the first level of analysis (Level 1) and interindividual differences in SU represent the second level (Level 2) of analysis allows us to gauge a complex interaction between more stable and more fluctuating proactive initiatives.\nThe proposed model (Figure\u00a01) has its\u2019 main contribution to the literature by testing interactions between bottom-up effects in the JD-R theory (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). We\u00a0argue that these bottom-up effects most likely do not operate independently from one another but having personal resources that ensure better alignment between the employee and the work, could enhance the efficiency of short-term, concrete behavioral strategies that contribute to maintaining a positive state of mind for work on a daily basis. Both the JD-R theory and the model of proactive motivation (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010) have theorized that the efficiency of proactive initiatives can be\u00a0enhanced or hindered by contextual variables, such as job resources and demands (i.e., job control, leader behavior), or individual-level factors such as goal orientation (Bakker et\u00a0al., 2020) or self-insight (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2020). However, although personal resources could also manifest this effect from a theoretical perspective, there is no empirical work currently in the literature that would directly test this possibility.\nSecond, we\u00a0 highlight the relevance of proximal, hands-on strategies that employees themselves can implement daily to take personal initiative in improving their well-being. This moves forward from existing research which has for a long time focused on proactive actions aimed at changing aspects of the environment or the task (i.e., job crafting, Bakker, 2015) and much less on changing oneself (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010). PVM is focused on the self (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018), which makes it more accessible for employees daily, and less dependent on the work itself than enacting other forms of proactive behavior (i.e., renegotiating task boundaries).\nThird, we\u00a0assessed PVM and WE\u00a0as time-varying constructs using a daily diary method. This approach minimizes retrospective bias by asking participants to refer to states and actions that have just occurred during their day (Bakker, 2014). Empirical evidence showed daily variations not only in WE\u00a0(Sonnentag et\u00a0al., 2010) but also in its\u2019 antecedents, uncovering a dynamic and state-like experience of being engaged as a function of dynamic and statelike antecedents (Bakker, 2014). Bakker et\u00a0al. (2020) were the first to link PVM to WE\u00a0in a weekly design. However, while the authors have raised the issue that PVM is likely fluctuating also on shorter timeframes than a week, the research on this topic is relatively new and scarce. Therefore, this relationship has not yet been established at a day level."

            "text": "One main objective of the present study is to analyze the week-level positive relationship between PVM and WE\u00a0(Bakker\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\net\u00a0al., 2020) at the day level. We\u00a0argue that employees improve their daily engagement when they proactively manage their energetic, volatile, affective, and cognitive resources (Op den Kamp et\u00a0 al., 2018). Individuals can achieve this completely tailored to their personal, idiosyncratic needs and preferences, such as choosing to jog or walk to work to feel more physically energized and awake upon arrival or choosing to get comfortable in the car and play some inspiring or relaxing music to stay mindful and calm for an anticipated rushed workday (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018). These strategies are not restricted to morning activities but can serve employees throughout the day. For example, if an employee has an important presentation in the middle of the day, engaging in PVM to optimize energy for that presentation could mean arranging other tasks earlier to gain a half-hour window to step outside and think through the presentation with a cup of coffee, or meditating before the presentation to get focused and present. The affective, energetic, and cognitive resources (i.e., task focus, optimism, positive affect) that are mobilized through PVM enable the employee to act and achieve objectives during the day (Sonnentag et\u00a0 al., 2010) and feel more vitality and engagement while working (Bakker, 2017). According to JD-R theory, such daily resource gain generated by PVM could significantly increase daily WE\u00a0 (Bakker, 2015; Bakker et\u00a0al., 2020).\nEmpirical support for this assertion comes from related literature highlighting daily antecedents of WE\u00a0in the form of positive affect, re-attachment to work, anticipated task focus (Sonnentag et\u00a0al., 2020), and daily optimism (Tims et\u00a0al., 2011). Bakker et\u00a0al. (2020) empirically demonstrated a direct weekly relationship between PVM and WE. However, engagement is a state that also fluctuates in a shorter time frame of days (Bakker, 2014). PVM could represent a specific behavior through which an\nemployee could achieve this state daily (Bakker and Demerouti, 2018). Based on this literature, we\u00a0anticipate the following:\nH1: Daily PVM is positively related to daily WE."

            "text": "Identifying key strengths is essential, but beyond the possession of certain strengths, the active use of these seems to be\u00a0the key toward the most benefits in terms of reduced stress, more efficient work, increased self-esteem, vitality, and positive affect (Wood et\u00a0al., 2011; van Woerkom et\u00a0al., 2016). From the perspective of COR theory, this renders SU the role of a key personal resource (Ding and Lin, 2020; Chu et\u00a0al., 2022), which can contribute to engagement by generating a resource caravan (Hobfoll, 2011). Research has shown that SU can facilitate engagement by employing personal strengths that match the job, increasing other resources such as person-job fit (Kooij et\u00a0al., 2017), and self-efficacy and optimism (Meyers and van Woerkom, 2017; van Woerkom and Meyers, 2019). These, in turn, attract job resources in the form of developmental opportunities, positive feedback, or autonomy (Stander and Mostert, 2013). Employees\u2019 initial investment of their strengths has the potential to draw a series of other resources that can also be\u00a0 invested further, creating a positive gain cycle (Hobfoll, 2011).\nIn a recent intervention study, Bakker and van Wingerden (2021) found that employees who learned to employ their strengths increased their WE. Following this empirical evidence, as well as other previous studies (van Woerkom et\u00a0 al., 2016; Bakker and van Woerkom, 2018), we\u00a0propose that employees who\nFIGURE\u00a01 A multi-level model of work engagement, proactive vitality management, and strenghts use.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\ngenerally use their strengths to complete their work will report increased daily engagement:\nH2: SU at the individual level is positively related to daily WE.\nFurther, we\u00a0 argue that SU and PVM do not have only independent bottom-up relationships to WE, but rather, there could be\u00a0a constant interaction between them. Within the JD-R theory, general personal dispositions can moderate the daily gain cycle between resources, WE, and proactive crafting behaviors (Bakker, 2015). Hence, individual differences, such as the propensity to engage in SU, might influence whether specific PVM strategies generate the desired effects or not (Bakker et\u00a0al., 2020). Both JD-R and COR theories postulate that personal resources can have a significant role in the motivational gain cycle (Hobfoll, 2011) through their power to attract and gain other resources that maintain engagement. The enrichment of resources generated by SU as a personal resource (Chu et\u00a0al., 2022) forms a resource caravan (Hobfoll, 2011) with the potential to create motivational states that sustain proactive action (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010). Proactively engaging in vitality management can be\u00a0easiest for an individual in activities that satisfy the conditions for proactive behavior to take place (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018). Drawing on the proactivity model of Parker et\u00a0al. (2010), we\u00a0can expect that employees would engage in PVM with greater probability when they believe that they can have success in achieving their goal of getting into an energized state (\u201ccan-do motivation\u201d), have some motivation to engage vigorously in the activity (\u201creason to motivation\u201d), and when positive feelings activate them (\u201cenergized to\u201d). The three states are fundamental in proactive goal generation and selfregulation to strive toward a self-initiated goal (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010) and can be\u00a0 actively created by a personal resource such as SU. Empirical evidence supports this, showing that SU is linked to higher performance and proactivity (Miglianico et\u00a0al., 2020; Tisu et\u00a0al., 2022), as well as higher self-efficacy (van Woerkom et\u00a0al., 2016). This suggests that employees who actively use their strengths build up performance coupled with beliefs in their success in work assignments where strengths have led to success. Other research shows that employees who achieve a better alignment between their strengths and their jobs can increase person-job fit, making the job more congruent with themselves and more personally motivating (Kooij et\u00a0al., 2017). Other studies have provided results on the beneficial effects of SU in terms of positive affect and optimism (Meyers and van Woerkom, 2017).\nWhile our study is the first to test the specific moderating effect of SU, recent research has provided empirical support for person-level moderators of the associations PVM has to wellbeing and performance. Op den Kamp et\u00a0al. (2020) have found that PVM is more strongly related to creativity at the week level in the case of employees with higher self-insight (i.e., being more aware of ones\u2019 states and feelings). In another study, Bakker et\u00a0al. (2020) have shown that employees\u2019 learning goal orientation moderates the weekly association between PVM and WE. Thus, we\u00a0have formulated the following hypothesis:\nH3: SU at the individual level enhances the daily positive relationship between PVM and WE."

Goodness-of-fit was evaluated using the \u03c72 likelihood ratio statistic alongside the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker\u2013Lewis Index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root means square residual (SRMR). Values of 0.90 or higher for CFI and TLI, and 0.08 or lower for RMSEA and SRMR indicate an acceptable model fit to the data (Hu and Bentler, 1999). Models were compared using the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-squared difference (Satorra and Bentler, 2010) and the difference in CFI, with \u0394CFI >0.01, indicating a significant change in model fit (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002).\nTable\u00a01 contains the results of the MCFA. The hypothesized 3-factor model (M1) placed SU at Level 2 (L2) and defined PVM and WE\u00a0as distinct but correlated Level 1 (L1) factors. This model had a good fit to the data [\u03c72(106) = 3131.83, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.92; TLI = 0.9; RMSEA = 0.08; SRMRwithin = 0.07; SRMRbetween = 0.03]. To verify if PVM and WE\u00a0are indeed best conceptualized as within-person factors, we\u00a0 compared this model with a 5-factor model (M2) in which we\u00a0defined latent factors for PVM and WE\u00a0 on both levels. This model faired significantly worse [\u03c72(281) = 3537.15, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.71; TLI = 0.68; RMSEA = 0.09; SRMRwithin = 0.18; SRMRbetween = 0.23; \u0394\u03c72(15) = 86.16, p < 0.001; \u0394CFI = 0.21]. This comparison assured that PVM and WE\u00a0 are better conceptualized and modeled only at L1. To further test the discriminant validity of the L1 measures, we\u00a0also compared the hypothesized model to a 2-factor solution (M3), which merged PVM and WE\u00a0in one\nfactor at L1. M3 also performed significantly worse compared to M1 [\u03c72(106) = 3131.83, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.81; TLI = 0.76; RMSEA = 0.16; SRMRwithin = 0.07; SRMRbetween = 0.03; \u0394\u03c72(3) = 187.58, p < 0.001; \u0394CFI = 0.11].

The simple slope analysis showed that at lower levels of SU (1 SD below the mean), PVM predicted WE\u00a0 positively (\u03b2 = 0.49, SE = 0.09, p < 0.001), but this relationship became significantly stronger (t = 2.9, df = 712, p = 0.003) at higher levels of SU (+1 SD above the mean; \u03b2 = 0.85, SE = 0.08, p < 0.001).

For example, an employee can decide to take the bike to work in the morning, with the proactive goal of arriving in a more energized state for a morning task. Another employee might meditate shortly before starting a difficult task to create a more absorbed state in the activity.\nThe most important findings of the present research reside in the significant cross-level direct (H2) and moderating (H3) effects of SU. These results are aligned with previous cross-sectional and longitudinal research (van Woerkom et\u00a0al., 2016; Bakker and van Woerkom, 2018). Existing studies focusing on the outcomes of SU have shown that relying more on strengths to complete work increases person-job fit (Kooij et\u00a0 al., 2017), boosts personal resources, and positive affect (Meyers and van Woerkom, 2017; van Woerkom and Meyers, 2019), attributing SU the role of a personal resource, which attracts and generates other resources that an individual needs to invest to achieve high levels of wellbeing (Hobfoll, 2011). JD-R theory\u2019s perspective conveys that SU has an essential moderating role in the motivational gain cycle (Bakker, 2015). Aligned with these theoretical frames, the proactivity literature (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010) and previous studies investigating SU as a personal resource (Ding and Lin, 2020; Chu et\u00a0al., 2022), the data confirmed our expectations that PVM would predict the highest engagement in the case of employees who direct their energy and effort toward activities they use their key strengths in. This could be\u00a0 because the resources and states associated with SU facilitate the motivational states necessary for mobilizing and sustaining proactive action (Parker et\u00a0al., 2010). By creating the conditions in which proactive goal generation and\nbehavior thrive, SU seems to be\u00a0an essential person-level catalyst for the benefits of PVM. For example, suppose an employee is highly creative and uses this strength frequently to perform his/ her work over time. In this case, tasks that can imply creativity can be\u00a0 associated with feelings of competence, self-efficacy, and anticipated positive affect. These can prompt and maintain proactive initiatives toward activities that energize the employee (e.g., taking a walk outside to get fresh air) or facilitate a focused state (e.g., meditating, researching other creative works that are connected) whenever the employee anticipates that using his/her creativity in the task will be\u00a0possible and beneficial."

Concretely, we\u00a0found that daily engagement can be\u00a0achieved by employees\u2019 active and proactive generation of positive psychological states and their efforts to make the most of psychological resources. This focus complements top-down approaches that scholars and employers generally take to promote WE\u00a0in organizations (Bakker, 2014; Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018) by highlighting that employees have a proactive influence over their well-being and are not only passive receivers of traditionally researched top-down effects (Bakker and Demerouti, 2018). Moreover, following previous studies proposing that the efficiency of PVM can be\u00a0 moderated by stable person-level and environment-level factors (Bakker et\u00a0al., 2020; Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2020), we\u00a0 showed that personal resources that also imply a propensity toward proactive action (such as SU), could improve\nFIGURE\u00a02 The cross-level interaction between general SU and daily PVM in predicting daily WE.\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nthe daily positive effects of PVM. This means that the bottom-up effects enlisted within the JD-R theory (Bakker, 2017) do not exist and operate only independently. Rather, our theoretical understanding of them can be\u00a0expanded if we\u00a0also consider that short-term, concrete behaviors work in interaction with stable proactive personal resources."

            "text": "In terms of practical insights, this research suggests that creating awareness around such proactive strategies and allowing employees the freedom and opportunity to engage in them could return high levels of daily engagement. Beyond encouraging employees to use their strengths and manage their vitality, organizations also can take action through training interventions facilitating PVM and SU. Organizations that wish to promote such behaviors through training can build on valuable recent findings. The results of a recent intervention study showed that training based on energy management techniques led to increases in PVM (B\u0103l\u0103ceanu and V\u00eerg\u0103, 2022). Helping employees develop PVM strategies and allowing them time and space to implement these consistently across the week could greatly benefit maintaining high energy levels throughout the week. In the after-COVID context, with work from home isolated from the resources that the presence of colleagues and managers offer during the day (van Zoonen and Sivunen, 2021) and different plans of returning to work that heavily relies on remote participation, PVM can become a proper individual strategy for employees who become more personally responsible than ever for staying focused and engaged during the day.\nSimilarly, SU interventions gained scientific terrain in recent years (Miglianico et\u00a0al., 2020). A recent meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of interventions targeting strengths identification, development, and use in organizations shows that such interventions generate moderate increases in well-being, slight increases in proactive personal strategies, and strong growth of personal resources (V\u00eerg\u0103 et\u00a0al., 2022). Our results underline that when employees create opportunities for SU, they not only reap the direct benefits of this strategy but also gain more from their PVM. This suggests that a complementary development of these behavioral strategies could benefit employees the most."

            "heading": "4.3. Strengths, limitations, and future research",
            "text": "A significant strength of our research resides in the diary design, which allows a more naturalistic investigation of the relationships to WE, minimizing the risks of recall bias and capturing short-term reports close to the reality of everyday working life (Sonnentag et\u00a0al., 2010, 2020). Regarding limitations, first, we\u00a0collected self-report data, which raises concerns about common method bias. To minimize this risk, we\u00a0have carefully analyzed and compared the proposed multilevel factor structure to solutions where measurements overlapped in a common latent\nfactor and assured that the proposed model represented the data best. Future research could obtain data from different sources (e.g., supervisors\u2019 ratings) to rule out other sources of common method bias (Podsakoff et\u00a0al., 2003).\nSecond, the sample size at the employee level might limit our conclusions\u2019 robustness regarding the random and cross-level effects. L2 sample sizes greater than 30 tend to have a minimal impact on the accuracy of the fixed effects. However, recommendations for L2 units necessary for computing accurate standard errors of variance components range from 30 units to over 100 (Scherbaum and Ferreter, 2009). We\u00a0 also draw a cautionary note on the generalizability of these findings to the larger working population. Collecting the data within one organization contributes to the internal validity of our research, but it comes at the cost of external validity. Considering this, our findings apply primarily to highly educated white-collar female workers. Using this model in other work contexts could be\u00a0 inadequate because such proactive behaviors could have different boundary conditions and forms of manifestation in other contexts. Thus, knowing that PVM can contribute to daily engagement, it becomes essential that future research uncovers the structural and contextual antecedents and conditions of such behaviors. This could inform managers and HR practitioners about working conditions that impede or facilitate such proactive behaviors beyond the employee\u2019s initiative. For example, Van Scheppingen et\u00a0al. (2015) have found that vitality at work was positively associated with a balanced orientation toward work and social capital at the workplace. Op den Kamp et\u00a0al. (2020) have found that, alongside self-insight, social support at the workplace was a significant moderator of the positive effects of PVM. In the original validation study of the PVM concept (Op den Kamp et\u00a0al., 2018), the authors highlighted that employees enjoying high levels of autonomy and skill variety might have more opportunities to engage in vitality management strategies, which might not be\u00a0accessible in all occupations yet. However, they also pointed out that since these strategies are profoundly personal and can be\u00a0tailored to anyone\u2019s preferences and context, workers across all industries and occupations can benefit from them with some progress in supporting their use. Therefore, replicating our results with a more extensive sample of individual employees and explicitly testing potential differences between industries and occupations could further our knowledge not only about PVM as a concept but also about the contexts which favor its\u2019 manifestation.\nFinally, although the sequence we\u00a0tested in this study from PVM to WE\u00a0 is based on theory and earlier research, other orderings are also plausible. It is also possible for WE\u00a0to further predict PVM, similar to the daily cycles through which WE\u00a0feed back into job crafting behaviors (Tims and Bakker, 2010; Bakker, 2015). Future research investigating gain cycles is an important and necessary development in deepening our current understanding of the dynamics of WE\u00a0and proactivity in organizations (Bakker and Demerouti, 2018). Similarly, our model is aligned with the predominant discussions within the JD-R literature, emphasizing that personal resources can attract and protect other resources (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017).\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nHowever, some authors also stress a bidirectional, interactive relationship between resources and personal resources. For example, Kira et\u00a0 al. (2010) have discussed ways in which collaborative job design (i.e., job characteristics and resources shaped in close collaboration with employees and their needs) can support the development of personal resources. This potential reversed, and bidirectional causation is fundamental in our understanding of the modern world of work. Therefore, it creates exciting new directions for future research on proactivity in the workplace."

            "text": "The current study showed that employees who proactively manage their physical and mental energy and use their key strengths to complete work report the highest daily engagement. Through PVM, employees actively manage their cognitive, emotional, and energetic resources and increase their engagement throughout the workday. Moreover, employees who rely on their key strengths to complete their work feel more engaged and benefit more from PVM. Thus, our results demonstrate that while proactive strategies are beneficial independently, they yield the most gains when combined and used complementary."
