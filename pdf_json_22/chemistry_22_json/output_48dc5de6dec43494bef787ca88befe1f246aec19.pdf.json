    "abstractText": "Optical and photophysical properties of 6-substituted-1,2,4-Triazine fluorescent derivative dye doped in silicate based sol\u2013 gel, homopolymer of methyl methacrylate (PMMA), and copolymer (MMA/diethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (DEGDMA) were investigated. The pores of different hosts and caging of the dye were found to effect on the parameters such as molar absorptivity, cross sections of singlet\u2013singlet electronic absorption and emission spectra, excited state lifetime, quantum yield of fluorescence. The dipole moment of electronic transition, the length of attenuation and oscillator strength of electronic transition from So \u2192 S1 have been calculated. The dye was pumped with different powers using 3rd harmonic Nd: YAG laser of 355 nm and pulse duration 8 ns, with repetition rate 10 Hz. Good photo stability for dye was attained. After 55,000 pumping pulses of (10 mJ/pulse), the photo-stabilities were decreased to 53%, 48%, and 45% of the initial ASE of dye in sol gel, PMMA, and Co-polymer respectively. The dye in sol\u2013gel matrix showed improvement of photo stability compared with those in organic polymeric matrices.",

Some 1,2,4-triazine derivatives have also used as kinase inhibitors [15], and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors [16]. Also fused heterocyclic systems that contain nitrogen were reported to exhibit fluorescent activity [17]. They are also widely applied as LEDs, lasers of semiconductors, probes, and fluorescent sensors. In the development of organic LED (OLED) technologies trends are focused primarily on optimizing existing devices and developing new emission materials [18, 19]. In recent years, the synthesis of new high-performance dyes and the implementation of new ways of incorporating the organic molecules into the solid matrix have resulted in significant advances towards the development of practical tunable solidstate dye lasers, due to their high efficiency and they do not contain volatile and toxic solvents, they are non-flammable, nontoxic, compact in size and mechanically and thermally * Mahmoud E.

The sol\u2013gel method is a method in which\u00a0organic dye molecules are\u00a0incorporated into an inorganic silica host [24]. This\u00a0shows some advantages, e.g. compactness, better manageability and highly porous, transparent in Uv\u2013visible-near IR regions. Its reaction can be controlled easily by chemical methods. It allows introducing permanent organic groups to form inorganic\u2013organic hybrid materials [25] and the process takes place at low temperature [26]. In this respect we recently reported the synthesis of 6-Substituted-1, 2, 4-Triazine mono glucosyl fluorescent derivative dye and investigated their optical, photo physical and solvatochromic properties [27]. In continuation of this work, the present study discuss the spectral behavior and photophysical parameters of 6-substituted-1,2,4triazine mono glucosyl fluorescent derivative dye doped in various solid hosts matrices including sol\u2013gel, PMMA and Co-PMMA. Although\u00a0a lot of dyes are commercially available for laser systems,\u00a0but the previous ones have a pointing of advantages such as larger Stokes shift magnitude (\u0394\u03bb > 100\u00a0nm) which can minimize cross-talk between the excitation source and the fluorescent emission [28]."

There is a minimum overlap between the dye absorption and emission spectra in the three solid matrices.\n(1)kisc = ( 1 \u2212 f ) \u2215 f\n1 3\nThis is important as far as reabsorption of emitted photons is concerned. Figure\u00a01 shows that the absorption maximum peak of dye was 385\u00a0nm and the emission maximum peak was at 520\u00a0nm in sol\u2013gel, respectively. Inset Fig.\u00a01 shows that the emission of the dye of different concentrations in sol\u2013gel at excitation wavelengths 385\u00a0nm. The optimum dye concentration was 7 \u00d7 10\u20135\u00a0M in sol\u2013gel. The dye fluorescence peak intensity increased till 7 \u00d7 10\u20135\u00a0M then decreased with increasing concentrations which might be attributed\nto due molecular aggregations of dye molecules which absorbed the emitted photon.\nFigure\u00a02A,\u00a0B\u00a0shows that the absorption maximum peaks were at 365 and 370\u00a0nm in PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA), respectively.

Inset Fig.\u00a02A, B\u00a0shows that the emission of the dye at different concentrations in in PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA) at excitation wavelength\n365\u00a0nm, and 370\u00a0nm respectively. The dye emission spectra with different concentrations doped in PMMA and (MMA/ DEGDMA) Co-polymer was shown in inset Fig.\u00a02A, B. The dye fluorescence peak intensity increased till 5 \u00d7 10\u20135\u00a0M in case of PMMA and 1 \u00d7 10\u20134 in case of (MMA/DEGDMA) Co-polymer then it decreased with increasing concentrations which might be attributed to molecular aggregations of dye molecules. Also, the optimum dye concentration was 5 \u00d7 10\u20135\u00a0M and 1 \u00d7 10\u20134\u00a0M in PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA) Co-polymer, respectively.\nFrom the Figs.\u00a01 and 2 show that the absorption maximum peaks were 385\u00a0nm, 365\u00a0nm and 370\u00a0nm in sol gel, PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA), respectively, and the emission maximum peaks were 520\u00a0nm, 445\u00a0nm and 450\u00a0nm in sol gel, PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA), respectively. We found that the nature of polymer either homo-polymer or copolymer has no effect on the absorption intensity of the dye, but it has clear effect of its absorption wavelength. This effect may be attributed to the nature of interaction between dye and DEGDMA which contains different active groups. Comparing the dye fluorescence peak wavelengths and intensities in different solid matrices showed that, the fluorescence emission wavelengths are higher red shifted in sol\u2013gel compared to polymer matrices. This behavior indicates a more relaxed excited state due to dye host interaction within excited state lifetime. Some important photo-physical parameters of the dye were calculated and summarized in Table\u00a0 1, which demonstrate their potential for use\u00a0 in advanced optical applications. However, the absorption cross-section (\u03c3a) is the ability of the molecule to absorb a photon of a certain polarization and wavelength. Emission cross-section (\u03c3e) measures the probability of the excited ion in a given cross sectional area to emit a photon. The attenuation length (L) (called absorption length) is the distance into a material when the probability has dropped to1/e that a particle has not been absorbed.\nIt is\u00a0noticed from photophysical parameters of dye in different solid hosts that excited state lifetime (\u03c4f) values in PMMA and in copolymer matrices are lower than those in sol\u2013gel matrix. This indicates a dynamic quenching process\nin which the polymer matrices interact with the excited state dye molecules. This leads to shortening of \u03c4f values in polymer matrices compared with sol\u2013gel. The oscillator strength value in sol\u2013gel matrix is higher than those in polymer matrices. Hence, the effective number of electrons transferred from the ground to excited states in sol\u2013gel is higher than\u00a0that in polymer matrices. Fluorescence quantum yield (\u03d5f) values are lower in polymer and in copolymer matrices compared with those in sol\u2013gel, indicating more interaction between dye molecules and polymer matrices. The carbonyl group in chromophore polymer matrices possesses (n, \u03c0*) electronic states that are characterized by low singlet\u2014triplet splitting energies (\u0394ES,T) leading to triplet state population from singlet excited state, with subsequent fluorescence quenching [34]. It is known that the (T1 \u2192 Tn) transition is a spin- allowed one that can quench fluorescence by photon re-absorption. The lower energy level of (n, \u03c0*) states also allows for exciton trapping [34] adding to factors causing fluorescence quenching. Further confirmation of the role of polymer matrices in fluorescence quenching comes from the higher intersystem crossing rate constants (kisc) values in polymer matrices compared with sol\u2013gel glass."

            "text": "The spontaneous fluorescence intensities and wavelengths of the 6-substituted-1,2,4-triazines mono glucosyl derivative dye in sol gel, PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA) copolymer were varied after pumping with 3rd harmonic Nd:YAG (\u03bb = 355\u00a0nm).

We found that the concentration 3 \u00d7 10\u20134 after pumping the different concentration by 5\u00a0mJ is the highest emission intensity of the dye in PMMA, CoPMMA (MMA/DEGDMA) and sol\u2013gel then pumping these concentration 3 \u00d7 10\u20134 with excitation wavelength 355\u00a0nm by 3rd harmonic Nd:YAG pulsed laser with different\n1 3\ninput pumping powers 5\u00a0mJ, 10\u00a0mJ, 20\u00a0mJ as showed in Fig.\u00a03A\u2212C.\nBy pumping using 355\u00a0nm 3rdrd harmonic Nd: YAG pulsed laser with \u03bbex = 355\u00a0nm excitation wavelength at different powers intensity 5\u00a0mJ, 10\u00a0mJ, and 20\u00a0mJ. The emission intensity of ASE peak wavelength of the dye in sol gel matrix (\u03bbf = 550\u00a0nm) showed a large red shift from that of the dye in PMMA (\u03bbf = 475\u00a0nm) and (MMA/DEGDMA) matrix (\u03bbf = 480\u00a0nm) as in Fig.\u00a03. Figure\u00a03 showed the emission intensity of the dye in solid hosts at different input power at 5, 10 and 20\u00a0mJ. The increasing of the peak intensity of ASE of the dye may be attributed to the increasing of the number of excited molecules (increase the population of S1 state) which yields more emitted photons. These changes in wavelengths may be due to the interaction of the structure of the two different dyes molecules with different solid matrices as shown in Fig.\u00a03.\nThe photostability, as an important photochemical parameter, was studied by the evaluation of the output fluorescence as a function of number of pulses in the same position of the samples as outlined in Fig.\u00a04. This study was carried out for the samples of the dyes which the repetition rate of 355\u00a0nm Nd: YAG laser with 8\u00a0ns pulse duration was kept at (10\u00a0Hz) and the energy was kept constant at (10\u00a0mJ/pulse). The output energy gradually decreased due to the photodegradation progressive and thermo-degradation of the dye\u2019s molecules. This decreasing occurred at a faster rate for the dyes in polymer than in sol gel, and the peak ASE dropped to 53%, 48% and 45% of the initial ASE of the dye in sol\u2013gel, PMMA and (MMA/DEGDMA) Co-PMMA, respectively, by pumping with 355\u00a0nm 3rd harmonic Nd: YAG laser at 10\u00a0mJ with repetition rate of 10\u00a0Hz after 55,000 pulses. Since the mechanism of photodegradation occurs by the interaction molecules of the\ndye in the excited state with other species such as impurities, other dye molecules and singlet oxygen. Through the process of doping dyes into a solid medium, the photochemical pathways including bimolecular reactions can be suppressed by caging or trapping the dye within a solid host [41].\nThe improved photostability of the dyes within solid hosts has been attributed for caging and molecules immobilizing of the dye, minimizing thereby excited-state interaction with other species including molecular oxygen. So, the dye photodegradation in a solid host depends on the dye\u2019s molecule nature, the host composition and structure, the host impurities as well as presence of molecular oxygen. Another possible factor that may explains the reduced rate of degradation in the rigid matrices may be that the dyes molecules are more tightly confined within the pores of the matrix, limiting rotational and translational freedom. A mobile molecule, as in solution, will be more likely to encounter an oxygen molecule and undergo degradation. Less freedom, as defined by the restrictive pores of the matrix, may make the dye molecules less likely to interact with molecular oxygen leading to photodegradation or molecular oxygen fluorescence quenching [41]. The micro-viscosity environment around dye molecules in the solid matrix affects their photodegradation. The net photo deterioration would be slow if the irradiated molecules were swiftly replaced by fresh molecules. As a result, photo degradation in sol\u2013gel samples is negligible, with the longest half-life values. On the other hand, photo degradation occurs at a faster pace in the copolymer samples. This is because dye molecules in polymer samples are surrounded only by polymer matrix with very little solvent around them, whereas dye molecules in sol\u2013gel matrix are rapidly replenished because\n1 3\nsol\u2013gel samples contain ethylene glycol, which may aid in the mobility of the embedded dye molecules, resulting in minimal photodegradation and the longest half-life values."
