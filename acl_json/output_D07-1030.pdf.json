    "abstractText": "This paper proposes a method using the existing Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT) system as a black box to produce synthetic bilingual corpus, which will be used as training data for the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system. We use the existing RBMT system to translate the monolingual corpus into synthetic bilingual corpus. With the synthetic bilingual corpus, we can build an SMT system even if there is no real bilingual corpus. In our experiments using BLEU as a metric, the system achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the best RBMT system that is used to produce the synthetic bilingual corpora. We also interpolate the model trained on a real bilingual corpus and the models trained on the synthetic bilingual corpora. The interpolated model achieves an absolute improvement of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the individual model trained on the real bilingual corpus.",

In this research, we are interested in answering the question of whether the existing RBMT systems could be helpful to the development of an SMT system. To find the answer, let us first consider the following facts:\n\u2022 Existing RBMT systems are usually provided as a black box. To make use of such systems, the most convenient way might be working on the translation results directly.\n\u2022 SMT methods rely on bilingual corpus. As a data driven method, SMT usually needs large bilingual corpus as the training data.\nBased on the above facts, in this paper we propose a method using the existing RBMT system as a black box to produce a synthetic bilingual corpus1, which will be used as the training data for the SMT system.\nFor a given language pair, the monolingual corpus is usually much larger than the real bilingual corpus. We use the existing RBMT system to translate the monolingual corpus into synthetic bilingual corpus. Then, even if there is no real bilingual corpus, we can train an SMT system with the monolingual corpus and the synthetic bilingual corpus. If there exist n available RBMT systems for the desired language pair, we use the n systems to produce n synthetic bilingual corpora, and n translation models are trained with the n corpora respectively. We name such a model the synthetic model. An interpolated translation model is built by linear interpolating the n synthetic models. In our experiments using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as the metric, the interpolated synthetic model achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the best RBMT system that is used to produce the synthetic bilingual corpora. 1 In this paper, to be distinguished from the real bilingual corpus, the bilingual corpus generated by the RBMT system is called a synthetic bilingual corpus.\n287\nMoreover, if a real bilingual corpus is available for the desired language pair, we build another translation model, which is named the standard model. Then we can build an interpolated model by interpolating the standard model and the synthetic models. Experimental results show that the interpolated model achieves an absolute improvement of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the standard model.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we summarize the related work. We then describe our method Using RBMT systems to produce bilingual corpus for SMT in section 3. Section 4 describes the resources used in the experiments. Section 5 presents the experiment result, followed by the discussion in section 6. Finally, we conclude and present the future work in section 7."

            "text": "In the MT field, by far the most dominant paradigm is SMT. SMT has evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al., 1993) into phrase-based approaches (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based approaches (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 2000; Yamada and Knignt, 2001; Chiang, 2005). On the other hand, much important work continues to be carried out in Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) (Carl et al., 2005; Way and Gough, 2005), and many existing commercial systems are rule-based.\nAlthough we are not aware of any previous attempt to use an existing RBMT system as a black box to produce synthetic bilingual training corpus for general purpose SMT systems, there exists a great deal of work on MT hybrids and MultiEngine Machine Translation (MEMT).\nResearch into MT hybrids has increased over the last few years. Some research focused on the hybrid of various corpus-based MT methods, such as SMT and EBMT (Vogel and Ney, 2000; Marcu, 2001; Groves and Way, 2006; Menezes and Quirk, 2005). Others tried to exploit the advantages of both rule-based and corpus-based methods. Habash et al. (2006) built an Arabic-English generationheavy MT system and boosted it with SMT components. METIS-II is a hybrid machine translation system, in which insights from SMT, EBMT, and RBMT are used (Vandeghinste et al., 2006). Seneff et al. (2006) combined an interlingual translation\nframework with phrase-based SMT for spoken language translation in a limited domain. They automatically generated a corpus of EnglishChinese pairs from the same interlingual representation by parsing the English corpus and then paraphrasing each utterance into both English and Chinese.\nFrederking and Nirenburg (1994) produced the first MEMT system by combining outputs from three different MT engines based on their knowledge of the inner workings of the engines. Nomoto (2004) used voted language models to select the best output string at sentence level. Some recent approaches to MEMT used word alignment techniques for comparison between the MT systems (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Zaanen and Somers, 2005; Matusov et al. 2006). All the above MEMT systems operate on MT outputs for complete input sentences. Mellebeek et al. (2006) presented a different approach, using a recursive decomposition algorithm that produces simple chunks as input to the MT engines. A consensus translation is produced by combining the best chunk translation.\nThis paper uses RBMT outputs to improve the performance of SMT systems. Instead of RBMT outputs, other researchers have used SMT outputs to boost translation quality. Callision-Burch and Osborne (2003) used co-training to extend existing parallel corpora, wherein machine translations are selectively added to training corpora with multiple source texts. They also created training data for a language pair without a parallel corpus by using multiple source texts. Ueffing (2006) explored monolingual source-language data to improve an existing machine translation system via selftraining. The source data is translated by a SMT system, and the reliable translations are automatically identified. Both of the methods improved translation quality."

The translation results of the interpolated models are shown in Figure 1.

To train different standard models, we randomly build five corpora of different sizes, which contain 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% sentence pairs of the real bilingual corpus, respectively. As to the synthetic model, we use the same synthetic\nmodel 1 that is described in section 5.1. Then we build five interpolated models by performing linear interpolation between the synthetic model and the five standard models respectively.

Numbers of Phrase Pairs 5.5 Results without Additional Monolingual Corpus cant improvement of about 0.01 BLEU (5.2% relative) as compared with the standard model without using the synthetic corpus. In all the above experiments, we use an additional English monolingual corpus to get more synthetic bilingual corpus. We are also interested in the results without the additional monolingual corpus. In such case, the only English monolingual corpus is the English side of the real bilingual corpus. We use this smaller size of monolingual corpus and the real bilingual corpus to conduct similar experiments as in section 5.2. The translation results are shown in Table 3.\nIn order to further analyze the translation results,\nwe examine the overlap and the difference among\nthe phrase tables. The analytic results are shown in\nTable 4. More phrase pairs are extracted by the\nsynthetic models, about twice by the synthetic\nmodel 1 in particular, than those extracted by the\nstandard model.

Another available way is directly combining these two kinds of corpora to train a translation model, namely corpus merge. In order to compare these two methods, we use RBMT system 1 to translate the 1,087,651 monolingual English sentences to produce synthetic bilingual corpus. Then we train an SMT system with the combination of this synthetic bilingual corpus and the real bilingual corpus. The BLEU score of such system is 0.1887, while that of the model interpolation system is 0.2020.

The newly added phrase pairs from the synthetic models can assist to improve the translation results of the interpolated model. In this section, we will use an example to further discuss the reason behind the improvement of the SMT system by using synthetic bilingual corpus. Table 5 shows an English sentence and its Chinese translations produced by different methods. And Figure 3 shows the phrase pairs used for translation. The results show that imperfect translations of RBMT systems can be also used to boost the performance of an SMT system.\nFurther analysis is shown in Table 6. After adding the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT systems, the interpolated model outperforms the standard models mainly for the following two reasons: (1) some new phrase pairs are added into the interpolated model. 37.6% phrase pairs (1993 out\nof 5306) are newly learned and used for translation. For example, the phrase pair \"after-sale service <-> \u552e\u540e\u670d\u52a1 (shouhoufuwu)\" is added; (2) The probability distribution of the phrase pairs is changed. For example, the probabilities of the two pairs \"a brand name <-> \u54c1\u724c (pinpai)\" and \"and the creation of <-> \u548c \u521b\u9020 (he chuangzao)\" increase. The probabilities of the other two pairs \"brand name <- > \u54c1\u724c (pinpai)\" and \"and the creation of a <-> \u548c \u5efa\u7acb (he jianli)\" decrease. We found that 930 phrase pairs, which are also in the phrase table of the standard model, are used by the interpolated model for translation but not used by the standard model."

With the synthetic bilingual corpus, we could build an SMT system even if there is no real bilingual corpus. In our experiments using BLEU as the metric, such a system achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the best RBMT system that is used to produce the synthetic bilingual corpora. It indicates that using the existing RBMT systems to produce a synthetic bilingual corpus, we can build an SMT system that outperforms the existing RBMT systems.\nWe also interpolated the model trained on a real bilingual corpus and the models trained on the synthetic bilingual corpora, the interpolated model achieves an absolute improvement of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the individual model trained on the real bilingual cor-\npus. It indicates that we can build a better SMT system by leveraging the real and the synthetic bilingual corpus.\nFurther result analysis shows that after adding the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT systems, the interpolated model outperforms the standard models mainly because of two reasons: (1) some new phrase pairs are added to the interpolated model; (2) the probability distribution of the phrase pairs is changed.\nIn the future work, we will investigate the possibility of training a reverse SMT system with the RBMT systems. For example, we will investigate to train Chinese-to-English SMT system based on natural English and RBMT-generated synthetic Chinese."
