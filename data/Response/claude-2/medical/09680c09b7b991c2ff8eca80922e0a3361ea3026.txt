 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the biochemical mechanisms behind humic product-induced drought tolerance in maize. The paper suggests increased lignification and carbohydrate production may play a role, but more research is needed to confirm the mechanisms. 

2. Test whether humic products have similar effects on the biochemistry and drought tolerance of other major crops like wheat, soybean, and rice. This could expand the applicability of using humic products.

3. Conduct field trials across more locations and soil types to determine if the effects on maize biochemistry are consistent. The current study was limited to two fields in Iowa. 

4. Analyze how timing, rate, and application method (soil vs foliar) of the humic product affect the biochemical responses in maize. This could optimize humic product use. 

5. Identify the specific chemical components and structures within the humic product that invoke the beneficial plant responses. This could lead to more effective humic product formulations.
