    "abstractText": "We study the off-shell structure of the two-loop effective action in 6D,N = (1, 1) supersymmetric gauge theories formulated in N = (1, 0) harmonic superspace. The off-shell effective action involving all fields of 6D,N = (1, 1) supermultiplet is constructed by the harmonic superfield background field method, which ensures both manifest gauge covariance and manifest N = (1, 0) supersymmetry. We analyze the off-shell divergences dependent on both gauge and hypermultiplet superfields and argue that the gauge invariance of the divergences is consistent with the non-locality in harmonics. The two-loop contributions to the effective action are given by harmonic supergraphs with the background gauge and hypermultiplet superfields. The procedure is developed to operate with the harmonicdependent superpropagators in the two-loop supergraphs within the superfield dimensional regularization. We explicitly calculate the gauge and the hypermultiplet-mixed divergences as the coefficients of 1 \u03b52 and demonstrate that the corresponding expressions are non-local in harmonics.",

            "text": "Quantum properties of gauge theories in higher dimensions attract a lot of attention for a long time (see, e.g., [1\u201313]). Although these theories are not renormalizable by power-counting since the degree of divergence increases with a number of loops, the direct calculations sometimes demonstrate miraculous cancelations of some divergences. The situation becomes even more interesting in supersymmetric theories due to additional restrictions imposed by supersymmetry. In particular, some arguments were adduced that the maximally extended N = 8 supergravity is finite to all orders [14\u201316]. In this connection, it would be very interesting to study the ultraviolet divergences of supersymmetric gauge theories in the space-times of the dimension D > 4 and reveal possible mechanisms of cancelations of the divergences. One can expect that supersymmetry and, especially, the maximally extended supersymmetry, is capable to improve the ultraviolet behavior in supersymmetric higher dimensional gauge theories. In this paper we concentrate on 6D, N = (1, 1) supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. This theory is in many aspects similar to 4D,N = 4 SYM theory, and so one can expect some similarities in the structure of divergences in both theories. However, they essentially differ in the UV domain. In contrast to N = 4 SYM theory, which is finite to all loops [17\u201321], its 6D counterpart is non-renormalizable by power-counting. Nevertheless, an extended supersymmetry provides the on-shell finiteness of the theory up\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nto two loops [4\u20136, 22]. Recently we have shown that 6D,N = (1, 1) gauge theory is one-loop finite even off shell [23, 24]. The modern methods of computing scattering amplitudes [22] demonstrate that UV divergences in 6D,N = (1, 1) SYM theory should start from the three-loop level in accordance with the equation D = 4 + 6/L valid for L \u2265 2 [25\u201327] (see also [13]), which relates the space-time dimension D to the number of loops L at which divergences appear in the corresponding maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.1\nWhen investigating the quantum properties of supersymmetric theories, it is highly desirable to make use of the formulations and quantization procedure which preserve as many supersymmetries as possible. For example, 4D, N = 1 supersymmetry is manifest if a theory is formulated in N = 1 superspace (see e.g. [29\u201331]). Similarly, 4D, N = 2 supersymmetry can be kept manifest at all stages of calculations within the harmonic superspace approach [32\u201335]. This formalism is very convenient for analyzing the structure of quantum corrections. Say, the finiteness beyond the one-loop approximation [18, 21] can be proved much easier in the harmonic superspace [36, 37]. The similar harmonic 6D superspace [38, 39] can be efficiently used for dealing with quantum 6D, N = (1, 0) supersymmetric theories. If this method is applied to (the maximally extended) 6D, N = (1, 1) SYM theory, then N = (1, 0) supersymmetry is preserved even at the quantum level, while N = (0, 1) supersymmetry is hidden and can in general be broken by quantum corrections.\nIn our previous work [40] we initiated the study of the two-loop divergent contribution to the effective action of 6D, N = (1, 1) SYM theory in the harmonic superfield formalism and calculated the divergent contributions proportional to 1\n\u03b52 in the gauge superfield sector of the model. In the present paper we will analyze the general structure of the two-loop divergent contributions to the effective action in both gauge and hypermultiplet sectors.\nThe UV properties of various 6D, N = (1, 0) and N = (1, 1) theories in 6D harmonic superspace approach were studied in [23, 24, 41\u201349]. The N = (1, 1) SYM theory in this formulation amounts to N = (1, 0) Yang-Mills supermultiplet minimally coupled to the hypermutiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. Note that, in general, N = (1, 0) theories are plagued by quantum anomalies [50\u201353], but N = (1, 1) SYM theory is not anomalous. It was found that 6D, N = (1, 1) theory is off-shell finite in the one-loop approximation in the Feynman gauge [23, 24]. However, the off-shell divergences still reappear in the non-minimal gauges [46] (although they vanish on shell). The two-loop divergences in the hypermultiplet two-point Green functions were shown to vanish off shell [42]. However, the complete two-loop calculation in the harmonic superspace approach has not yet been done. In the present paper we will calculate the leading divergences and demonstrate that this theory in the two-loop approximation is not finite off shell even in the Feynman gauge. However, we will demonstrate that the divergences disappear on shell, as it should be.\nIt is worth noting that although the harmonic superspace provides the manifest N = (1, 0) supersymmetry at the quantum level, in the Feynman supergraphs it produces harmonic-dependent propagators and integrations over harmonics, the number of which increases with the number of loops. For explicit calculations of such integrals, one needs\n1For recent advances of the amplitude techniques see [28] and references therein.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nto develop the special methods which would allow to evaluate the higher-loop harmonic supergraphs, based upon various nontrivial identities for the harmonic distributions. In the present paper we work out the manifestly N = (1, 0) supersymmetric approach to the calculation of the two-loop divergences of the effective action in the theory under consideration. Using this approach we will evaluate the leading divergences proportional to 1 \u03b52 in the mixed gauge-hypermultiplet sector and show that the result exactly matches the one derived earlier in [40]. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we recall the formulation of the six-dimensional N = (1, 1) SYM theory in N = (1, 0) harmonic superspace and discuss details of its superfield quantization. Section 3 is devoted to the power-counting analysis of possible two-loop divergent contributions to the effective action. We show that the possible counterterms, being, of course, local in space-time, can generically be non-local in harmonics. In section 4 we describe the general structure of divergent two-loop harmonic supergraphs, as well as the methods of their evaluations. Section 5 is devoted to applications of the above methods to the explicit calculation of the two-loop divergences in the mixed gauge-hypermultiplet sector. Summary collects the main results and briefly outlines the future directions of the study. Some technical details are passed to the appendices.\n2 The harmonic superspace formulation of 6D, N = (1, 1) supersymmetric gauge theories\nWe start by a brief overview of the N = (1, 0) harmonic superspace formulation of 6D,N = (1, 1) SYM theory. In such a formulation, the theory enjoys a manifest off-shell N = (1, 0) supersymmetry and an additional hidden on-shell N = (1, 0) supersymmetry. Together they form the complete 6D,N = (1, 1) supersymmetry of the classical theory. After quantization, we arrive at a quantum field theory with preserving the manifest N = (1, 0) supersymmetry at all stages of calculations. We recall the basic concepts of the harmonic superspace following notations and conventions of our previous papers [23, 24]. The 6D,N = (1, 0) harmonic superspace is parametrized by the coordinates (z, u) = (xM , \u03b8ai , u\u00b1i), where xM , M = 0, . . . , 5, are 6D Minkowski space-time coordinates, \u03b8ai with a = 1, . . . , 4 , i = 1, 2 , stand for Grassmann variables. The extra bosonic coordinates u\u00b1i , u+iu\u2212i = 1 (called harmonics) parametrize the coset SU(2)/\u03a5(1) of the automorphisms group Sp(1) \u223c SU(2) [38, 39]. The analytic coordinates \u03b6 = (xMA , \u03b8\u00b1a) are defined as\nxMA \u2261 xM + i 2\u03b8 +a(\u03b3M )ab\u03b8\u2212b, \u03b8\u00b1a = u\u00b1k \u03b8 ak, (2.1)\nwhere (\u03b3M )ab are the antisymmetric 6D Weyl \u03b3-matrices, (\u03b3M )ab = \u2212(\u03b3M )ba , (\u03b3\u0303M )ab = 1 2\u03b5 abcd(\u03b3M )cd , with \u03b5abcd being the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor. By definition, the analytic superfields are annihilated by the operator D+a = u+i Dia, where Dia are the spinor covariant derivatives. Also we will need the covariant derivative D\u2212a = u\u2212i Dia and the harmonic derivatives\nD\u00b1\u00b1 = u\u00b1i \u2202 \u2202u\u2213i , D0 = u+i \u2202 \u2202u+i \u2212 u\u2212i \u2202 \u2202u\u2212i . (2.2)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nThe spinor and harmonic derivatives satisfy the algebra\n{D+a ,D\u2212b }= i(\u03b3 M )ab\u2202M , [D++,D\u2212\u2212] =D0, [D\u00b1\u00b1,D\u00b1a ] = 0 , [D\u00b1\u00b1,D\u2213a ] =D\u00b1a .\n(2.3) The integration measures over the full harmonic and analytic superspaces are defined, respectively, as\nd14z \u2261 d6xA (D\u2212)4(D+)4, d\u03b6(\u22124) \u2261 d6xA du (D\u2212)4, (2.4)\nwhere (D\u00b1)4 = \u2212 124\u03b5 abcdD\u00b1a D \u00b1 b D \u00b1 c D \u00b1 d . (2.5) In the harmonic superspace approach the gauge field is a component of the analytic gauge superfield V ++. Also it is necessary to introduce a non-analytic harmonic connection V \u2212\u2212 as a solution of the harmonic zero-curvature condition [34]\nD++V \u2212\u2212 \u2212D\u2212\u2212V ++ + i[V ++, V \u2212\u2212] = 0 . (2.6)\nUsing these superfields, we construct the gauge covariant harmonic derivatives \u2207\u00b1\u00b1 = D\u00b1\u00b1 + iV \u00b1\u00b1. The spinor gauge covariant derivatives can be written as [49]\n\u2207+a = D+a , \u2207\u2212a = D\u2212a + iA\u2212a , \u2207ab = \u2202ab + iAab , (2.7)\nwhere \u2207ab = 12(\u03b3 M )ab\u2207M , \u2207M = \u2202M \u2212 iAM and the superfield connections are defined as\nA\u2212a = iD+a V \u2212\u2212 , Aab = 1 2D + a D + b V \u2212\u2212. (2.8)\nThe covariant derivatives (2.7) satisfy the algebra\n{\u2207+a ,\u2207\u2212b } = 2i\u2207ab , [\u2207 \u00b1 c ,\u2207ab] =\ni 2\u03b5abcdW \u00b1 d, [\u2207M ,\u2207N ] = iFMN , (2.9)\nwhere W a\u00b1 is the superfield strength of the gauge supermultiplet,\nW+a = \u2212 i6\u03b5 abcdD+b D + c D + d V \u2212\u2212, W\u2212a = \u2207\u2212\u2212W+a . (2.10)\nThe classical action of 6D, N = (1, 1) SYM model S0[q+ , V ++] in the harmonic superspace is written as [39] S0 = 1 f2 \u221e\u2211 n=2 (\u2212i)n n tr \u222b d14z du1 . . .dun V ++(z,u1) . . .V ++(z,un) (u+1 u + 2 ) . . .(u + n u + 1 ) \u2212 12f2 tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) q+A\u2207++q+A . (2.11) The SU(2) Pauli-G\u00fcrsey indices are raised and lowered by the rule q+A = ABq+B, 12 = 1. The analytic superfields V ++ and q+A belong to the adjoint representation of the gauge group, i.e,\nV ++ = (V ++)ItI , q+A = (q + A) ItI , [tI , tJ ] = if IJKtK , tr (tItJ) = 12\u03b4 IJ ,\n(2.12)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nwhere tI are generators of the gauge algebra with the structure constants f IJK , and the covariant harmonic derivative is defined as\n\u2207++q+A = D ++q+A + i[V ++, q+A ]. (2.13)\nThe classical equations of motion for the theory (2.11) have the form\nF++ + i2[q +A, q+A ] = 0 , \u2207 ++q+A = 0 , (2.14)\nwhere we have defined the Grassmann-analytic superfield\nF++ = (D+)4V \u2212\u2212 , D++F++ = 0 . (2.15)\nThe action (2.11) is invariant under the manifest N = (1, 0) supersymmetry and an additional hidden N = (0, 1) supersymmetry. The hidden supersymmetry mixes the gauge and hypermultiplet superfields [11],\n\u03b4(0,1)V ++ = +Aq+A , \u03b4(0,1)q + A = \u2212(D +)4( \u2212AV \u2212\u2212) , \u00b1A = aA\u03b8 \u00b1a . (2.16)\nAs a result, the action (2.11) is invariant under 6D, N = (1, 1) supersymmetry.2 It is also invariant under the superfield gauge transformations\n\u03b4V ++ = \u2212\u2207++\u03bb , \u03b4q+A = i[\u03bb, q + A ] , (2.17)\nwith a real analytic superfield \u03bb in the adjoint representation as the transformation parameter. The non-analytic gauge connection V \u2212\u2212 is transformed as\n\u03b4V \u2212\u2212 = \u2212\u2207\u2212\u2212\u03bb . (2.18)\nThe harmonic zero-curvature condition (2.6) is invariant under the gauge transformations (2.17) and (2.18). The gauge transformations of the gauge connections (2.8), of the covariant strengths (2.10) and of the analytic superfield (2.15) can be easily found. In particular, F++ transforms homogeneously, like Q+A, which ensures the covariance of the equations of motion (2.14). For quantizing gauge theories, it is convenient to use the background field method, which allows constructing the manifestly gauge invariant effective action. For 6D, N = (1, 0) SYM theory in the harmonic superspace formulation this method was worked out in refs. [23, 24, 41]. In many aspects it is similar to that for 4D, N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories [35, 54] (see also the review [55]). Following the background field method we split the superfields V ++ and q+A into the sums of the background superfields V ++, Q+A and the quantum ones v++, q + A ,\nV ++ \u2192 V ++ + fv++ , q+A \u2192 Q + A + fq + A . (2.19)\nNext, we expand the effective action in a power series in quantum superfields and obtain a theory of the superfields v++, q+A in the background of the classical superfields V ++, Q + A,\n2Though the second supersymmetry (2.16) is an off-shell symmetry of the action (2.11), its correct closure with itself and with the manifest N = (1, 0) supersymmetry is achieved only on shell.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nwhich are treated as functional arguments of the effective action. According to refs.

Using the bridge, one can define the \u03c4 -representation for a superfield X according to the prescription\nX\u03c4 = e\u2212ibXeib. (2.29)\nAfter performing the shift (2.26), the quadratic part of the action S2 (2.25) splits into few terms, each being bilinear in quantum superfields,\nS2 + Sgf = 1 2tr\n\u222b d\u03b6\n(\u22124) 1 d\u03b6 (\u22124) 2 v ++ 1\n{ _ \u03b4\n(3,1) A (1|2)\u2212 2Q +A 1 G (1,1)(1|2)Q+2A } v++2\n\u2212 12tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) h+A\u2207++h+A . (2.30)\nThen the propagator of the gauge superfield in (2.30) is expressed as\nG (2,2) IJ (1|2) = \u22122( _ 1 \u22121)IJ\u03b4(2,2)A (1|2)\n+ 4( _ 1 \u22121)INfNKL1(Q+A1 )K(Q + 2A) MfML2PG(1,1)(1|2)L1L2( _ 2 \u22121)PJ + . . . ,\n(2.31)\nand that of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts as\nG(0,0)(1|2) = i\u3008b(\u03b61, u1)c(\u03b62, u2)\u3009 = \u2212(u\u22121 u \u2212 2 )G(1,1)(1|2) . (2.32)\nThe Nielsen-Kallosh ghosts matter only in the one-loop approximation and do not appear in the two-loop supergraphs considered in this paper. For calculating the two-loop quantum corrections we will need vertices which are cubic and quartic in quantum superfields. The presence of the non-trivial background hypermultiplet leads to the modification of the interaction vertices compared to ref. [42]. Indeed, the substitution (2.26) obviously modifies the interacting vertices.

This allows us to list all possible two-loop divergent contributions to the effective action. First of all we note that in the framework of the N = (1, 0) supersymmetric background field method the (dimensionally regularized) divergences of the effective action are automatically gauge invariant and N = (1, 0) supersymmetic by construction. Taking into account\n3The number of external gauge lines has no impact on the index \u03c9(G) because the superfield V ++\nis dimensionless. 4In the analysis below we take all superfields in the \u03c4 -representation [34].\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nthe space-time locality of the counterterms together with N = (1, 0) supersymmetry, we conclude that the divergences should be local in the space-time and Grassmann coordinates. However, since the harmonics are dimensionless, the power counting cannot guarantee a locality in harmonics. This means that we could expect the supersymmetric and gauge invariant divergences which contain the harmonic non-localities. We believe that the existence of gauge-invariant functionals that are nonlocal in harmonics is a general property of extended supersymmetric theories formulated in harmonic superspace. An example of such a functional is the initial classical action (2.11). Further we shall consider the consequences of the relation (3.2).\nNQ = 0, \u03c9 = 4.

            "text": "Here we consider the structure of the divergences for the background superfields satisfying the classical equations of motion (2.14). The classical theory (2.11) possesses the hidden on-shell N = (0, 1) supersymmetry (2.16), while the quantum effective action does not preserve such a supersymmetry since the gauge fixing conditions used for the construction of the effective action preserve only the manifest N = (1, 0) supersymmetry. However, for the background superfields satisfying the classical equations of motion, the hidden supersymmetry is restored. Therefore, studying the on-shell divergences amounts in fact to the study of restrictions on the divergences imposed by hidden N = (0, 1) supersymmetry. In general, the off-shell two-loop divergent contributions to the effective action may include all possible terms of the form G(2)i , i = 1, . . . , 5. Let us examine the corresponding on-shell contributions. First we have to note that all the contributions G(2)i should exactly yield one of the expression \u0393(2)i , i = 1, 2, 3, if the equations of motion for the hypermultiplet are satisfied (see appendix A for details). Hence, we can write\n\u0393(2)div = tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) ( c1F ++ _ F++ + c2i F++ _ [Q+A, Q+A] + c3 [Q +A, Q+A] _ [Q+B, Q+B] ) + terms vanishing on e.o.m. for Q+ , (3.14)\nwhich is in the full agreement with our previous analysis in [40]. This expression involves three arbitrary coefficients, each being proportional to 1\n\u03b52 and to the dimensionful coupling constant f2 with dimensionless numerical coefficients. Fixing the coefficients requires the explicit calculations of the quantum corrections.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nThe hidden N = (0, 1) supersymmetry (2.14) additionally restricts the structure of the divergent contribution (3.14) and leads to the absence of two-loop divergences on shell (see e.g. [11, 12, 22] and the references therein). As we pointed out, the hidden N = (0, 1) supersymmetry means that the background superfields solve the classical equations of motion (2.14). In this case there arises a connection between the coefficients ci, i = 1, 2, 3, in (3.14). Omitting the terms proportional to the hypermultiplet equation of motion, we can rewrite the action (3.14) as\n\u0393(2)div = tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) ( c1E ++ _ E++ + (c2 \u2212 c1)iF++ _ [Q+A, Q+A]\n+ (c3 + 14c1)[Q +A, Q+A] _ [Q+B, Q+B]\n) , (3.15)\nwhere E++ = F++ + i2 [Q +A, Q+A] is the left hand side of the gauge multiplet equation of motion (2.14). The requirement that the expression (3.15) vanishes on-shell, E++ = 0, leads to the relation between the coefficients\n2c2 + 4c3 = c1 .

One of the coefficients c2, c3 in (3.14) remains arbitrary. Hence, to check the relation (3.14) which was obtained solely on the ground of the power-counting arguments, it suffices to calculate only one of these coefficients, e.g., c2. The last one will be fixed by eq. (3.16). In what follows, we consider those contributions which include only the term F++Q+AQ+A in the divergent supergraphs and explicitly calculate the coefficient c2."

Then, due to the identity\n(u+1 u + 2 )q(D \u2212\u2212 1 )k\u03b4(2,\u22122)(u1, u2) = 0, q > k , (4.3)\nthe non-zero contribution emerges only for q = k, in particular,\n(u+1 u + 2 )2(D \u2212\u2212 1 )2\u03b4(2,\u22122)(u1, u2) = 2 \u03b4(0,0)(u1, u2) . (4.4)\nHence, we need to collect additional D\u2212\u2212 operators from the d\u2019Alembertian operator in the denominator in the first and second terms of the expression (4.2). For this purpose, we consider the Green function (4.2) in the coincident point z2 \u2192 z1 limit and collect the fourth power of D\u2212a from the inverse _ operator to annihilate the Grassmann \u03b4-function \u03b48(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82), 1 _\n= 1 +W+aD\u2212a + . . . \u223c (W +)4(D\u2212)4 5 . (4.5)\nThis implies that the second term in (4.1) gives only finite contributions, and so the divergent contributions can come only from the first term in eq. (4.1).\n\u0393II diagram. The analytic expression for the two-loop diagram \u0393II (of the \u2018\u0398\u2019 topology) presented in figure 1 is constructed using the cubic gauge superfield vertex (2.34):\n\u0393II = \u2212 f2\n6\n\u222b d14z1 d 14z2 6\u220f a=1 dua f I1J1K1f I2J2K2\n\u00d7 G\n(2,2) I1I2 (z1, u1; z2, u4)G(2,2)J1J2(z1, u2; z2, u5)G (2,2) K1K2\n(z1, u3; z2, u6) (u+1 u + 2 )(u + 2 u + 3 )(u + 3 u + 4 ) (u + 4 u + 5 )(u + 5 u + 6 )(u + 6 u + 1 ) . (4.6)\nWe substitute the explicit expressions for the Green function G(2,2) and integrate by parts with respect to one of the (D+)4 factors. After this it is necessary to calculate the harmonic integrals over u4, u5, u6 using the corresponding delta-functions which come from\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nthe propagators. As a result, we obtain\n\u0393II = \u2212 f2\n6\n\u222b d14z1 d 14z2 3\u220f a=1 dua f I1J1K1f I2J2K2 (u+1 u + 2 )2(u + 2 u + 3 )2(u + 3 u + 1 )2 ( _ \u22121)I1I2\u03b414(z1 \u2212 z2)\n\u00d7 (D+1 )4 ( ( _ \u22121)J1J2(D+2 )4\u03b414(z1 \u2212 z2)( _ \u22121)K1K2(D+2 )4\u03b414(z1 \u2212 z2) ) .\n(4.7)\nAfter integrating over \u03b82 using the Grassmann delta-function we are left with the coincident \u03b82 \u2192 \u03b81 limit in the two remaining delta-functions. As in the previous case, we need to annihilate these Grassmann delta-functions in the coincident \u03b8-point limit, acting on each of them by (D\u00b1)8-factors. There are three explicit (D+)4 factors in the expression (4.7). Therefore, the remaining (D\u2212)4 factor should be taken from the inverse _ operators. However, doing so, we will produce an extra operator (\u22022)\u22124. This implies that the expression for the superdiagram considered can give only finite contribution to the effective action.\n\u0393III and \u0393IV diagrams. As in the previous consideration for the Q+ = 0 case [40], the superdiagrams \u0393III and \u0393IV presented in figure 2 exactly cancel each other due to N = (0, 1) supersymmetry (requiring Q+A to be in the adjoint representation) even for the non-trivial Q+ background.5 Indeed, the sum of these two superdiagrams is given by the expression\n\u0393III + \u0393IV = f2 \u222b d\u03b6 (\u22124) 1 d\u03b6 (\u22124) 2 ( 1 + (u+1 u \u2212 2 )(u \u2212 1 u + 2 ) )\n\u00d7 f I1J1K1f I2J2K2G(2,2)I1I2 (1|2)G (1,1) J1J2 (1|2)G(1,1)K1K2(1|2). (4.8)\nApplying the identity 1 + (u+1 u \u2212 2 )(u \u2212 1 u + 2 ) = (u + 1 u + 2 )(u \u2212 1 u \u2212 2 ) (4.9)\nwe cast the contribution (4.8) in the form\n\u0393III + \u0393IV = f2 \u222b d\u03b6 (\u22124) 1 d\u03b6 (\u22124) 2 (u + 1 u + 2 )(u \u2212 1 u \u2212 2 )\n\u00d7 f I1J1K1f I2J2K2G(2,2)I1I2 (1|2)G (1,1) J1J2 (1|2)G(1,1)K1K2(1|2) = 0 . (4.10)\n\u0393V, \u0393VI and \u0393VII diagrams. Now, let us consider the additional superdiagrams \u0393V, \u0393VI and \u0393VII in figure 3. These diagrams are the modification of the divergent diagram \u0393III in figure 2, where the local cubic vertex (2.33) is replaced by the non-local shifted vertices (2.37) and (2.38). The diagrams \u0393III and \u0393IV are divergent but cancel each other due to N = (0, 1) supersymmetry, see eq. (4.10). Hence, the additional diagrams in figure 3, which appear after the non-local change of variables (2.26), diverge. Since the substitution (2.26) involves only the quantum hypermultiplet and does not act on the ghost superfields, the additional diagrams \u0393V \u2212 \u0393VII cannot be canceled. We have to emphasize that we collected only divergent contributions in the mixed gauge-hypermultiplet sector, such as F++Q+AQ+A. The non-local vertices (2.37) and (2.38) include the background hypermultiplet Q+A, which is depicted by the bold dots in figure 3\n5See ref. [56], where a similar situation was also observed in 4D, N = 4 SYM theory.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nfor diagrams \u0393V \u2212 \u0393VII. However, the diagram \u0393VI contains at least four background hypermultiplets and so is beyond our consideration. The remaining diagrams \u0393V and \u0393VII include the terms of interest, as implied by the power momentum counting and contribute to the F++Q+AQ+A part of the effective action."

In this section we consider the calculation of the 1/\u03b52 divergences coming from these diagrams in some detail.\nDivergent part of \u0393I diagram. The analytic expression for the superdiagram \u0393I presented in figure 1 is constructed similarly to the case Q+ = 0 considered in [40]. The new peculiarity is that the vector supermultiplet propagator (2.28) now includes a non-trivial Q+ dependence,\n\u0393I, div = \u22122f2 tr(tItJ tKtL) \u222b d14z \u222b 4\u220f\na=1 dua\nG (2,2) IJ (z, u1; z, u2)G (2,2) KL (z, u3; z, u4)\n(u+1 u + 2 )(u + 2 u + 3 )(u + 3 u + 4 )(u + 4 u + 1 )\n. (5.1)\nTo calculate the divergent contribution to the effective action, we substitute the expression (2.31) for the vector multiplet Green function into the numerator in (5.1). Then, using the identity [ 1\n_ 2 1\n, 1\n(u+1 u + 2 )\n] = 1_\n1\n( (u\u22121 u+2 ) (u+1 u + 2 )2 F++ ) 1 _\n2 1\n+ 1 _\n2 1\n( (u\u22121 u+2 ) (u+1 u + 2 )2 F++ ) 1 _ 1\n(5.2)\nand omitting terms that give finite contributions the expression\n1 (u+1 u + 2 ) G (2,2) IJ (1|2) = 1 (u+1 u + 2 )\n( \u2212 2_\n1 \u03b4\n(2,2) A (1|2) + 4 _\n2 1\nQ+A1 G (1,1)(1|2)Q+2A + . . . ) IJ (5.3)\ncan be calculated in the limit of coincident points. For this purpose we note that in the leading order in 1/\u03b5, where \u03b5 \u2261 6 \u2212 D \u2192 0, in the expression considered one can make the replacement\n1 3 \u03b46(x\u2212 x\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223 x\u2032=x \u2192 i(4\u03c0)3\u03b5 (5.4)\nwhich is valid in the minimal subtraction scheme. Thus, we obtain\n1 (u+1 u + 2 ) G(2,2)(z1, u1|z2, u2) \u2223\u2223\u2223 z2\u2192z1 = 2i(4\u03c0)3 1 \u03b5 ( F++1,\u03c4 (u \u2212 1 u + 2 )(u + 1 u + 2 )2(D \u2212\u2212 1 )2\u03b4(2,\u22122)(u1, u2)\n+ 2Q+A1,\u03c4 Q + 2A,\u03c4\n) + finite contributions , \u03b5\u2192 0 ,\n(5.5)\nwhere \u03c4 -representation was introduced in eq. (2.29).\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nTo reproduce the result of [40], one can put Q+ = 0 in eq. (5.5) and substitute it to eq. (5.1). Then we obtain\n\u0393FFI,div = f2(C2)2 8(2\u03c0)6\u03b52 tr \u222b d14z du1du2 F ++ 1,\u03c4 F ++ 2,\u03c4 1 (u+1 u + 2 )2 . (5.6)\nUsing the identity F++1,\u03c4 =\n1 2D ++ 1 D \u2212\u2212 1 F ++ 1,\u03c4 ,\nand integrating by parts with respect to the derivative D++1 , this expression can be rewritten as\ntr \u222b d14z du1du2 F ++ 1,\u03c4 F ++ 2,\u03c4\n1 (u+1 u + 2 )2 = \u221212tr \u222b d14z du1du2D \u2212\u2212 1 F ++ 1,\u03c4 F ++ 2,\u03c4 D \u2212\u2212 1 \u03b4 2,\u22122(u1, u2)\n= 12tr \u222b d14z du (D\u2212\u2212)2F++\u03c4 F++\u03c4 = tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) duF++ _ F++. (5.7)\nThus, the leading (1/\u03b52) divergent part of the two-loop diagram \u0393I depicted in figure 1 depending only on the background gauge superfield has the form\n\u0393FFI,div = f2(C2)2 8(2\u03c0)6\u03b52 tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) duF++ _ F++, (5.8)\nand determines the constant c1 in eq. (3.17). In the general Q+ 6= 0 case, we substitute the whole expression (5.5) into eq. (5.1) and obtain the leading (1/\u03b52) divergent contribution coming from this diagram in the form\n\u0393FQQI, div = \u2212 if2(C2)2 8(2\u03c0)6 \u03b52 tr \u222b d14z du1du2du3\n(u+1 u + 2 )(u + 3 u + 1 ) F++1,\u03c4 [Q +A 2,\u03c4 , Q + 3A,\u03c4 ] . (5.9)\nThe expression (5.9) generalizes the result obtained earlier in [40] for the case Q+ = 0.\nDivergent part of \u0393V diagram. The analytic expression for the diagram \u0393V reads\n\u0393V = if2f I1J1K1f I2J2K2fL1M1N1fL2M2N2 \u222b 4\u220f\na=1 d\u03b6(\u22124)a (Q+A2 )N1(Q + 4A) N2 (5.10)\n\u00d7G(1,1)I1L1(1|2)G (1,1) I2L2 (3|4)G(2,2)J1J2(1|3)G (2,2) M1M2 (2|4)G(1,1)K1K2(1|3) .\nTo single out the divergent contribution in (5.10), we should first substitute the explicit expressions for the Green functions. In the case of the non-trivial hypermultiplet background, the gauge superfield propagator G(2,2) is given by the expression (2.31) involving additional contributions with the hypermultiplet Green function. These terms contain one more d\u2019Alembert operator in the denominator and produce finite contributions to the effective action. Thus, we should consider only the first term in the expression (2.31), which corresponds to the standard propagator for the gauge superfield v++. Then, we integrate over \u03b63 and \u03b64 using the analytic delta-functions \u03b4(2,2)A (1|3) and \u03b4 (2,2) A (2|4) coming from the gauge superfield propagators. After making these steps, we find the following result for the leading divergences\n\u0393FQQV,div = 4if 2f I1J1K1f I2J2K2fL1M1N1fL2M2N2\n\u222b d\u03b6\n(\u22124) 1 d\u03b6 (\u22124) 2 (Q +A 2 )N1(Q + 2A) N2 (5.11)\n\u00d7( _ 1 \u22121)J1J2G(1,1)K1K2(1|2) \u2223\u2223\u2223 2=1 ( _ 2 \u22121)M1M2G(1,1)I1L1(1|2)G (1,1) I2L2 (1|2) .\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nNext, we substitute the hypermultiplet Green function (2.28), restore the full superspace measure using (D+)4 factors from ( G\n(1,1) (1|2) )I2L2 , and integrate with the Grassmann deltafunction \u03b48(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82) coming from this Green function. Taking the coincident points limit and using the identity (D+1 )4(D + 2 )4\u03b48(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82) \u2223\u2223 \u03b82=\u03b81 = (u + 1 u + 2 )4, we obtain\n\u0393FQQV, div = 8if 2f I1JK1f I2JK2f I1MN1f I2MN2 \u222b d14z1d 6x2du1du2 (Q+A2,\u03c4 )N1(Q + 2A,\u03c4 )N2\n(u+1 u + 2 )2\n\u00d7 fK1K3K2(F++1,\u03c4 )K3 1 31\n\u03b46(x1 \u2212 x2) \u2223\u2223 x2=x1 1 2 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x2) 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x2) .\n(5.12)\nAfter calculating the (Euclidean) momentum integrals with the help of the identity\u222b dDk\n(2\u03c0)D dDl (2\u03c0)D 1 k6l4(k + l)2 \u2192 1 (4\u03c0)6 \u00b7 1 2\u03b52 +O (1 \u03b5 ) (5.13)\nthe result for the leading divergences can be written as\n\u0393FQQV, div = 2if2(C2)2 (4\u03c0)6\u03b52 tr \u222b d14z du1du2\n(u+1 u + 2 )2\nF++1,\u03c4 [Q +A 2,\u03c4 , Q + 2A,\u03c4 ] , (5.14)\nwhere we have also used the relation fABCfBKLfCLN = \u221212C2f AKN .\nDivergent part of \u0393VII diagram. The analytic expression for the diagram \u0393VII depicted on figure 3 has the form \u0393VII =\u2212f2f I1J1K1f I2J2K2fL1M1N1fL2M2N2 \u222b d14z1\n3\u220f a=1 dua 6\u220f b=4 d\u03b6 (\u22124) b (Q+A5 )N1(Q + 6A)N2 (u+1 u + 2 )(u + 2 u + 3 )(u + 3 u + 1 )\n\u00d7G(2,2)I1J2 (1|4)G (2,2) J1M1 (2|5)G(2,2)K1M2(3|6)G (1,1) I2L1 (4|5)G(1,1)K2L2(4|6) . (5.15)\nWe are interested in its divergent part of the form F++[Q+A, Q+A]. The expression (5.15) already contains the second power of the background hypermultiplet. Hence, we take only the first term from the gauge superfield propagator (2.31). Then we take off the (D+)4 factors from each Green function G(2,2) to restore the full superspace measures over z4, z5 and z6. We also integrate over the Grassmann variables \u03b84, \u03b85 and \u03b86 and the corresponding harmonic variables u4, u5 and u6 using the \u03b4-functions coming from the Green functions G(2,2). Then, taking the hypermultiplet Green function G(1,1) in the limit of coincident \u03b8\u2019s, we obtain\n\u0393FQQVII, div = 8f 2f I1J1K1f I1I2K2fL1J1N1fL2K1N2 \u222b d14z1d 6x4d 6x5d 6x6 du1du2du3\n(u+2 u + 3 )\n\u00d7 (Q+A)N1(x5, \u03b81, u2)(Q+A) N2(x6, \u03b81, u3) \u00d7 1 (u+1 u + 2 ) 1 _ I2L1 (u+1 u + 2 )\u03b46(x4 \u2212 x5) 1 (u+1 u + 3 ) 1 _ K2L2 (u+1 u + 3 )(x4 \u2212 x6) \u00d7 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x4) 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x5) 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x6) .

In particular, using the identity[ 1 _ , (u+1 u + 2 ) ] = \u2212i(u\u22121 u + 2 ) 1 _ F++ 1 _ , (5.17)\nwe obtain for the divergent contribution\n\u0393FQQVII, div = 8f 2f I1J1K1f I1I2K2fL1J1N1fL2K1N2 \u222b d14z1d 6x4d 6x5d 6x6 du1du2du3\n(u+2 u + 3 )\n\u00d7 (Q+A)N1(x5, \u03b81, u2)(Q+A) N2(x6, \u03b81, u3) (F++)N3(x4, \u03b81, u1) \u00d7 ((u\u22121 u+2 )\n(u+1 u + 2 ) \u03b4K2L2f I2N3L1 1 24 \u03b46(x4 \u2212 x5) 1 4 \u03b46(x4 \u2212 x6)\n+ (u \u2212 1 u + 3 )\n(u+1 u + 3 ) \u03b4I2L1fK2N3L2 1 24 \u03b46(x4 \u2212 x6) 1 4\n\u03b46(x4 \u2212 x5) )\n\u00d7 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x4) 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x5) 1 1 \u03b46(x1 \u2212 x6) . (5.18)\nThen we replace the space-time variables x5 by x6 and the harmonic ones u2 by u3 in the second term inside the bracket.

            "text": "In the present paper we have developed a manifestly covariant and N = (1, 0) supersymmetric method for studying the effective action of the six-dimensional N = (1, 1) SYM theory formulated in N = (1, 0) harmonic superspace. In such an approach the classical action (2.11) is that of N = (1, 0) SYM theory minimally interacting with the hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. The corresponding classical action is invariant under N = (1, 0) supersymmetry and also possesses a hidden on-shell N = (0, 1) supersymmetry. Hence, the action (2.11) really describes the six-dimensional N = (1, 1) SYM theory. In the previous papers [23, 55] we have shown that in the minimal gauge (a supersymmetric version of the Feynman gauge) this theory is finite off shell in the one-loop approximation. The two-loop 1\n\u03b52 divergent contribution in the gauge-multiplet sector has been calculated in ref. [40]. In the present paper we have analyzed the general structure of the two-loop divergences in the theory under consideration and shown that, generically, the corresponding counterterms, being space-time local, can be non-local in harmonics. Extending the result of ref. [40], we have performed the explicit calculation of the leading two-loop divergences in the mixed gauge multiplet-hypermultiplet sector. Note that the calculation of the divergences containing the background hypermultiplet has required considerable efforts with the use of a large arsenal of various harmonic identities. Throughout the paper we performed the calculation within the background field method in the harmonic superspace for arbitrary background superfields V ++ and Q+A. Due to the presence of the non-trivial hypermultiplet background the kinetic term for quantum superfields contains the mixed term that is removed by the non-local shift (2.26) of the quantum hypermultiplet. This leads to the appearance of new cubic vertices (2.37)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nand (2.38) and to the new two-loop diagrams presented in figure 3, some of which contribute to the divergent part of the effective action. Also, the two-loop divergences come from the supergraph \u0393I considered earlier in [40] under the choice Q+ = 0. In this paper we carried out a direct calculation of the two-loop 1\n\u03b52 divergences and showed that the final result, with contributions from both the gauge multiplet and hypermultiplet, exactly coincides with the one obtained in ref. [40], where the dependence on the hypermultiplet was restored through an indirect analysis.\nIt is worth noting that, in addition to the leading 1 \u03b52 divergences, one can also expect\nthe two-loop subleading 1\u03b5 divergences. If the background hypermultiplet is switched off, the expressions for them are proportional to F++ and so naturally vanishes on shell due to the equations of motion for the vector multiplet. However, the calculation of the 1\u03b5 divergences is much more technically involved as compared to the 1\n\u03b52 terms (especially in the presence of the background hypermultiplet) and the further work is needed to study the structure of the background-dependent harmonic supergraphs. It would be very interesting (and instructive from the point of view of the harmonic supergraph technique) to derive the total set of the 1\u03b5 divergences by a direct calculation. We are going to study all the relevant aspects in the forthcoming works. However, we wish here to emphasize that all calculations can be carried out using the same techniques. For illustration, in appendix B we show how the harmonic technique works for calculating the two-loop 1 divergences of the supergraph presented in figure 3. As we saw, the one- and two-loop divergences in the theory under consideration are proportional to classical equations of motion. This implies the one- and two-loop on-shell finiteness of the theory under consideration. One can expect that, starting from the threeloop approximation, the structure of divergences will change and the results will not be proportional to the standard classical equations of motion. At present, the off-shell structure of the three- and higher-loop divergences of the effective action is unknown.6 We plan to address this problem in the future papers."

This does not contradict the non-renormalization theorem which asserts only the locality of the divergent part of effective action in the Grassmann and space-time coordinates. Moreover, all the contributions just mentioned can be related to local expressions such as (3.5), (3.10). Here we are going to demonstrate this.\n6The existence of the proper dimension single-trace operators with the manifest off-shell N = (1, 0) supersymmetry and hidden on-shell N = (0, 1) supersymmetry was shown in [11] (see also [12]).

            "text": "divergences: an example\nIn this appendix we illustrate how the two-loop 1\u03b5 divergences can in principle be calculated in the framework of the harmonic supergraph techniques. As an example, the consideration will be carried out for the supergraph presented in figure 3. It is known that the theory under consideration does not have one-loop divergences off shell at least in the Fermi-Feynman gauge [43], hence no sub-divergences in the two-loop supergraphs can appear. For this reason, the divergent contributions proportional to 1\u03b5 can come out only as the cross terms, with the divergent contributions multiplied by the finite ones. However, all such contributions also vanish on shell. To demonstrate this, we consider, for simplicity, the trivial hypermultiplet background Q+ = 0. In this case all additional diagrams with \u201cnon-local\u201d vertices in figure 3, including the diagram \u0393V which contains the divergent contribution, immediately vanish. Consequently, all possible divergent contributions can come only from the diagram \u0393I. Let us denote g(1,1)(z;u1, u2) the finite contribution of the vector multiplet Green function divided by (u+1 u + 2 ) (5.5) in the z2 \u2192 z1 limit,\nG(2,2)(z1, u1|z2, u2) (u+1 u + 2 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 z2\u2192z1 = a \u03b5 F++1 (u \u2212 1 u + 2 )2\u03b4(1,\u22121)(u1, u2)+g(1,1)(z;u1, u2|V ++) , \u03b5\u2192 0 . (B.1) Here, a = \u2212 4i(4\u03c0)3 . The function g\n(1,1)(z;u1, u2|V ++) is an analytic superfield depending on the background vector multiplet V ++. By definition, this function is a gauge invariant polynomial of gauge superfield strength, such that it is local in the z space and can be non-local with respect to harmonic variables. It contains all the information about the structure of the finite part of the gauge superfield Green function G(2,2)(z1, u1; z2, u2) in the z2 \u2192 z1 coincident limit. The explicit form of this function does not matter and will not be discussed in what follows. As we discussed earlier, the divergent contribution of the diagram \u0393I arises from the expression (we omitted the gauge group indices and relevant coefficients)\n\u0393(2)div[V ++] = f2\n\u222b d14z 4\u220f a=1 ua G(2,2)(z, u1; z, u2)G(2,2)(z, u3; z, u4) (u+1 u + 2 )(u + 2 u + 3 )(u + 3 u + 4 )(u + 4 u + 1 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 div . (B.2)\nSubstituting (B.1) in the last expression and integrating with the harmonic delta-functions, we obtain\n\u0393(2)div[V ++] = \u2212a\n2f2 \u03b52 tr \u222b d\u03b6(\u22124) F++ _ F++\n+ 2af 2 \u03b5 tr \u222b d14z du1du2du3\n(u+1 u + 2 )(u + 1 u + 3 ) F++1,\u03c4 g (1,1)(z;u2, u3|V ++) . (B.3)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 9\nThe first term in (B.3) was obtained earlier in [40] by explicit calculation of the effective action, and it corresponds to the highest-order pole in \u03b5. The second term corresponds to the 1\u03b5 divergent contribution. We see that such a contribution also vanishes when the background gauge superfield satisfies the classical equation of motion, F++ = 0, in agreement with the hidden N = (0, 1) supersymmetry. Thus we see that the harmonic supergraph technique successfully works for calculating both 1\n\u03b52 and 1 \u03b5 divergences.\nOpen Access.
