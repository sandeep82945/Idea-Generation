"Our results showed that the metabolites in beauty tea were affected by different puncturing degrees of tea green leafhopper. A low puncturing degree of fresh tea leaves is more conducive to improving the quality of beauty tea. The degree of leafhopper puncturing affects the isomaltulose, 12-O-Î2-D-glucopyranosyloxyjasmonic acid, achimilic acid, theaflavic acid, ellagic acid, procyanidin A2, EC-(4β→8)-EGC 3-O-gallate, EC 3-O-gallate(4β→6)-EGC 3-O-gallate, EGC-(4β→8)-EC 3-O-gallate, neotheaflavin 3-gallate, L-theanine, linalool 3,6-oxide primeveroside, and linalool oxide D 3-[apiosyl-(1→6)-glucoside] levels, thus forming the different taste outlines of beauty tea. In addition, the dihydrolinalool and cis-linalool oxide levels may be mainly affected by the degree of leafhopper puncturing, thus forming the different aroma profile of beauty tea."
