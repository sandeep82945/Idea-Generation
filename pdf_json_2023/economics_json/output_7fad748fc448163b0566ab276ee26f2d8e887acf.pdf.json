    "abstractText": "The growth and uptake of e-government in developing economies is still affected by the interoperability challenge, which can be perceived as an orchestration of several issues that imply the existence of gaps in methods used for e-government planning and implementation. To a great extent, various counterparts in developed economies have succeeded in addressing the methodrelated gaps by developing e-government enterprise architectures, as blueprints for guiding e-government initiatives in a holistic and manageable way. However, existing e-government enterprise architectures are country-specific to appropriately serve their intended purpose, while enterprise architecture frameworks or methods are generic to accommodate several enterprise contexts. The latter do not directly accommodate the unique peculiarities of e-government efforts. Thus, a detailed method is lacking that can be adapted by developing economies to develop e-government enterprise architectures that fit their contexts. To address the gap, this article presents research that adopted a Design Science approach to develop an e-Government Enterprise Architecture Framework (EGEAF), as an explicit method for guiding the design of egovernment enterprise architectures in a developing economy. EGEAF was designed by extending the Architecture Development Method of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF ADM) to address requirements for developing interoperable e-government solutions in a developing economy. EGEAF was evaluated using two scenarios in the Ugandan context, and findings indicate that it is feasible; its design is understandable to enable its adoption and extension to accommodate requirements for developing interoperable e-government solutions in other developing economies.",

To a great extent, various counterparts in developed economies have succeeded in addressing the methodrelated gaps by developing e-government enterprise architectures, as blueprints for guiding e-government initiatives in a holistic and manageable way. However, existing e-government enterprise architectures are country-specific to appropriately serve their intended purpose, while enterprise architecture frameworks or methods are generic to accommodate several enterprise contexts. The latter do not directly accommodate the unique peculiarities of e-government efforts. Thus, a detailed method is lacking that can be adapted by developing economies to develop e-government enterprise architectures that fit their contexts. To address the gap, this article presents research that adopted a Design Science approach to develop an e-Government Enterprise Architecture Framework (EGEAF), as an explicit method for guiding the design of egovernment enterprise architectures in a developing economy. EGEAF was designed by extending the Architecture Development Method of The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF ADM) to address requirements for developing interoperable e-government solutions in a developing economy. EGEAF was evaluated using two scenarios in the Ugandan context, and findings indicate that it is feasible; its design is understandable to enable its adoption and extension to accommodate requirements for developing interoperable e-government solutions in other developing economies.

            "text": "E-government development is measured by several e-government maturity models (e.g., [1]\u2013[6]). A comparative assessment of existing e-government maturity models also exists [7]\u2013[9]. Such models provide a phased approach to developing e-government solutions and measuring progress towards attaining a citizen-centric and responsive government [10]\u2013[12]. Despite the existence of several e-government maturity models, developing economies are still in the low or middle indices of e-government development while most of the developed economies are in the (very) high indices [13], [14]. Literature (e.g., [10], [15]\u2013[18]) reveals that steady growth of e-government initiatives in developing economies is hindered by an orchestration of several situational issues. These include: weak technology or digital infrastructure with unreliable internet connectivity, digital divide, financial/economic constraints, cultural-socio-behavioral constraints, unreliable political climate, handicapping policies or legal frameworks, donor-reliant programmes, lack of unified standards for public services and their corresponding electronic services, fragmented egovernment solutions, and fragmented regulatory practices [13], [14], [19], [20]. Such challenges contribute to 35% total failure rate and 50% as partial failure rate of e-government implementations in developing countries [21], [22]. An analytical reflection on these issues reveals two critical gaps that are prevalent in developing economies. One, is the frequent mismatch between the baseline and target perspectives of e-government [23], [24], which causes an unrealistically large design-to-reality gap and a higher risk of e-government failure [9], [22]. Two, is the lack of holistic and systemic approaches to guide e-government implementations [25]\u2013[29] in a coherent way. For instance, the success of information technology investments in Africa is still affected by the lack of adequate skills in designing, implementing, and maintaining technology infrastructure, in a way that can enable services to accelerate growth in various sectors [30].\nThus, developing countries or countries with low indices of e-government development need to prioritize adoption of practices towards: a whole-of-government approach to e-government implementation; establishment of unified technical and legal standards for e-government solutions; enhancing competition on quality of service among public entities; effective coordination of egovernment investments within and across public entities; and full interoperability within and across public entities [13], [31], [32]. Since the practice towards full e-government interoperability seems to be the underlying pre-requisite that can facilitate the realization of other recommended practices, this article concentrates on exploring its realization in a developing economy.\nHowever, prior to assessing and devising means of realizing full e-government interoperability, it is vital to specify the scope of interoperability in the context of this research. ISO/IEC indicate that two or more systems are considered interoperable if they can \u201cexchange information and mutually use the information that has been exchanged\u201d [33]. This is achieved if: (a) the participating systems understand the type and size of data to be exchanged (technical interoperability), the formats of the exchanged information (syntactic interoperability), and the exchanged date and interpret in the same way (sematic interoperability); (b) the data exchange complies with the contextual, legal, organizational, and policy frameworks (policy interoperability); and (c) all stakeholders mutually understand the subsequent actions on the data after the exchange (organizational interoperability) [33]\u2013[35]. In the context of e-government, the seamless transfer of data within and across public entities requires a country to prioritize the achievement of data and systems interoperability [32]. However, basing on the above definitions, organizational interoperability facilitates the realization of data and systems interoperability. This implies that achieving full e-government interoperability involves considering interoperability within all domains of a public entity and across public entities. The domains include: the business/process domain, data/information domain, application systems domain, and technology infrastructure domain [36], [37]. This shows the scope and complexity of the full e-government interoperability need.\nIn a bid to manage the wide scope and complexity of aspects in e-government interoperability, two courses of action have been undertaken by different countries: a) Developing e-government\nmaster plans and standards for Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as well as policy guidelines that are based on e-government models and frameworks, to enable harmonized implementation of e-government [38]\u2013[40]; and b) Adopting an enterprise architecture approach to e-government implementations [41]\u2013[48]. Details of these two courses of action are discussed in Section 3, while their major drawbacks are highlighted in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 depicts the gap analysis and motivation for this research. Figure 1 was derived by synthesizing insights from existing work on e-government interoperability [25], [34], [49]\u2013[52] and e-government enterprise architectures [45], [53]\u2013[58]. Existing e-government models and frameworks in developing economies [59]\u2013[71] mainly provide success factors and emphasize some aspects of the desired e-government end product. They hardly offer a detailed procedure towards a holistic and controlled approach to e-government implementations. As a result, various disjointed e-government applications still exist [72], [73]. Although the issue of disjointed egovernment solutions is also reported in developed economies [74]\u2013[76], it is prevalent in developing economies.\nOn the other hand, the use of e-government enterprise architectures has yielded interoperable egovernment solutions to a large extent in economies that have adopted them [45], [53]\u2013[56], [77]. In general, enterprise architectures help organizations to achieve several goals such as: streamlining and managing technical complexity in digital transformations; integration of application systems; reduction in operational costs; effective support for business-IT alignment; support for the design and implementation of business and IT strategies; support for interoperability [78]\u2013[80]. Although enterprise architecture concerns several goals, the motivation to consider it as potential solution in this study is its support for interoperability. This is mainly due to two reasons. First, interoperability can be perceived as an enabling factor or goal, because its prioritization and realization helps to indirectly achieve the other goals or benefits of enterprise architecture. Second, since the e-government challenge in this study is full interoperability, the motivation for adopting enterprise architecture into e-government is its support for realizing interoperability in countries that have prioritized it.\nUnfortunately, e-government enterprise architectures that are developed and used to streamline e-government in developed countries are country-specific, and designed to suit specific contexts. Solutions in developed countries cannot just be transferred to developing countries without\nassessing mismatches in contexts [24]. Thus, e-government enterprise architectures for developed countries cannot just be transferred and implemented or used to guide e-government implementations in developing economies without a comprehensive adaptation. Developing countries or low income countries are characterized by: inadequate and unreliable technological or infrastructure landscapes; significantly low average incomes; high poverty levels; significantly high inequalities in income distribution; low level of physical capital and human capital development; inadequate investments and very low productivity levels; inability to fully utilize natural resources; high level of unemployment and under-utilized human resources; low levels of education and inadequately skilled labor force; inability to leverage or adopt production technologies for advancing industrialization; inadequate and unreliable health care systems; and limited access to quality and diverse education systems [81]\u2013[83]. Thus, the variations in the economic, technical, socio-cultural, and regulatory contexts of developed and developing economics cannot permit the trivial adoption of an e-government enterprise architecture for a developed economy. This implies that a developing economy that needs to adopt an enterprise architecture approach to e-government implementation can either re-design the domain architectures of an existing e-government enterprise architecture, or develop its own e-government enterprise architecture. Yet, existing enterprise architecture development frameworks (or methods for developing enterprise architectures) are generic and hardly provide specific guidelines tailored to address e-government concerns in the developing economies. There is a need for an egovernment enterprise architecture framework, that is specifically tailored to provide a thinking pattern that helps to address e-government challenges in developing economies [84], [85]. As indicated in Figure 1, this can be achieved by adapting an existing enterprise architecture framework with respect to e-government concerns in a developing economy like Uganda, so as to initiate a research effort that is envisioned to yield an e-Government Enterprise Architecture Framework for Developing Economies (EGEAF).\nEGEAF can be perceived as a method for supporting the development of e-government enterprise architectures, which are blueprints for implementing coherent and interoperable egovernment solutions. Thus, this article answers the question: How can the design of e-government enterprise architectures be methodologically supported? In other words, what should constitute EGEAF, or how should EGEAF be structured? In terms of scope, although this concept can be applied in a developed economy, this article first instantiates it in Uganda as a case of a developing economy. This is because the details associated with the \u2018methodological support\u2019 tend to vary with respect to a country\u2019s e-government maturity level and ability to deliver its contextual egovernment demands. Section 2 presents the research approach used, Section 3 gives an overview of related work, Section 4 presents the design of EGEAF, Section 5 highlights evaluation findings, and Section 6 concludes the article."

Systematic literature reviews require researchers to use and specify \u2018reproducible\u2019 steps for methodically searching all existing articles or studies on particular phenomena of interest, evaluating them, summarizing, and condensing their findings to yield new results [87]. In this research, the purpose of the review was to identify reported gaps in existing approaches for e-government development, but not to synthesize content of these approaches. Thus, the review herein did not require use of a systematic review approach, but rather a narrative review and snowball review approach. Unsystematic narrative reviews focus on describing and assessing findings in articles on a given subject so as to give general observations in the subject of interest, without prioritizing the reproducibility of the search and assessment process of the articles [87]. A snowball review approach involves using the bibliography of an article on a given subject to find other articles on the subject that were cited in that article or other articles that cite the article in question [88]. Thus, unsystematic narrative review and snowball review approaches were mutually used. Table 1 classifies existing approaches for e-government development into categories A to F, and highlights the gap in each category.\nTable 1 indicates that several developing countries have undertaken efforts in categories A to E, but their e-government landscapes still suffer disintegration and duplication. Other economies (e.g., those in category F in Table 1) have overcome disintegration, to a great extent, by developing e-Government Enterprise Architectures. Enterprise architecture is a significant pillar for egovernment success [103] and most countries with mature e-government programmes have an effective enterprise architecture programme [101], [105]. Enterprise architecture standardizes and aligns e-government initiatives by providing standard principles and guidelines for project planning, technical development, and operations [106]. Enterprise architecture enhances egovernment coherence by specifying policies, standards, design decisions, and constraints that\nyield an e-government landscape that holistically links business and technology services [101], [103].\nTo effectively utilize resources, it is vital to first create realistic baseline and target architectures that show the structure and dynamics of an enterprise, with respect to the overall e-government objective [47]. However, the adoption of enterprise architecture in e-government is not a trivial effort, which justifies the limited efforts towards developing country-specific e-government enterprise architectures [55]. The last row of Table 1 highlights that it is not feasible to simply adopt and implement existing e-government enterprise architectures for developed economies, because of differences in historical, geographical, economic, demographic, and political contexts. Differences also exist in working cultures, skill sets, access to technology and infrastructure setup across countries. Such differences make it difficult to simply implement existing e-government enterprise architectures or frameworks, without tailoring them to specific issues in developing economies and contexts. This underlines the importance of a common method that government agencies can follow to develop their own e-government enterprise architectures [53]. Such a method can be achieved by adapting existing enterprise architecture frameworks to suit contextual factors and e-government demands of developing countries."

An enterprise architecture framework specifies the process for developing properly scoped and detailed blueprints of business-IT alignment, and deliverables of such a process [37], [80]. Examples include: The Open Group Architecture Framework [36], [37]. Zachman [107] Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework [108], and Integrated Architecture Framework [109] among others.\nWhile other frameworks being less elaborated regarding the architecting procedure, TOGAF includes an Architecture Development Method (ADM) that details generalized guidelines for developing architectures, that can be instantiated and implemented in various enterprise contexts [36]. Hence the adoption of TOGAF in this research. Prior to applying TOGAF ADM, it is vital to review the extent to which its components suit a specific enterprise, and to customize it to derive an enterprise-specific architecture framework [36]. However, instantiating or adapting the ADM to provide a detailed procedure for realizing interoperable e-government implementations is not an obvious endeavor. Since TOGAF ADM comprises at least 10 phases or broad thematic areas, it was not possible to adapt all these phases to accommodate e-government aspects at once in this research. Thus, to make the scope of the adaptation manageable, this research adapted the first two (out of the 10) phases of TOGAF ADM \u2013 the preliminary phase and architecture vision phase. The adaptation was done by underpinning TOGAF ADM guidelines with e-government aspects in Uganda, so as to derive an e-Government Enterprise Architecture Framework (EGEAF). EGEAF specifies guidelines for creating an e-government enterprise architecture, as a blueprint of the baseline and target e-government solutions and their corresponding synergies or interoperability instances."

            "text": "To design EGEAF, there was need to first investigate requirements for e-government interoperability and then orchestrate possible solutions into a synthesis that can support their implementation in a mutual and holistic way. Accordingly, as reported in our earlier work [84], requirements were investigated by conducting an exploratory survey among ICT managers or focal persons in Ugandan public entities. The survey mainly investigated challenges hindering the realization of e-government interoperability and e-government implementations in general; and possible solutions to the hindrances. The list of strategic requirements is summarized in Table 2 (columns 1 and 2), and a detailed account of how they were derived is given in Nakakawa and Namagembe [84]. In Table 2, requirements are coded as Rx (R1.1 to R3.5) to represent three\nclusters of strategic needs associated with e-government implementations, i.e.: regulation and governance aspects (R1.1 to R1.7), policy aspects (R2.1 to R2.4), and socio-cultural or contextual aspects (R3.1 to R3.5). To address the requirements, column 3 of Table 2 summarizes \u2018design tasks\u2019 that had to be executed to build EGEAF, to ensure that its structural composition enables it to fulfill its intended purpose. These design tasks are perceived and treated as \u2018design decisions\u2019 made to address specific requirements, because they yield outputs in form of \u2018components or modules\u2019 that are synthesized to constitute EGEAF. The design tasks are coded as Dx (D1.1 to D3.5), so that they can be easily traced back to the requirements they address.\nIn Table 2, design decision D3.2 (in the grey-shaded row) is the pivotal design decision or task that serves as a hinge for all other design decisions or tasks. This implies that achieving requirement R3.2 (through realizing D3.2) is a prerequisite for logically addressing all other requirements in column 2, since D3.2 yields a schema for synthesizing all other design decisions in column 3 in a coherent way. To achieve D3.2, the procedure shown in Figure 3 was used. Figure 3 shows that there was a need to:\na) First specify the structural composition of a government enterprise, such that its features are used to guide the adaptation of TOGAF ADM. b) Adapt the two initial phases of TOGAF ADM, so as to derive key steps for creating an enterprise architecture vision for the government enterprise. To manage complexity, the scope\nof adaptation was limited to the first two phases of the ADM (preliminary and architecture vision phases). This provides a basis for adapting other ADM phases, whereby insights from adapting the first two phases will inform the adaptation of other phases of the ADM in future work. c) Extend or underpin steps in the adapted 11-Step model for creating and e-government architecture vision, with specific components that address requirements or aspects of e-\ngovernment interoperability in either a developing or developed economy. As indicated at the bottom of Figure 3, aspects for developed economies are beyond the scope of this article. Thus, the adapted 11-Step model was extended with components derived from executing design decisions D1.1 to D3.1 and D3.3 to D3.5 in Table 2.\nTable 2 continued\nCode Rx Requirements for egovernment interoperability\n[84]\nDesign Decision taken in building EGEAF to ensure that it addresses each requirement Code\nDx\nR1.6 Establish an advocacy\nprogramme for approved ICT standards and e-government regulations to increase their awareness among top managers of public entities\nGuide the acquisition of management support for egovernment regulation by providing insights into the kind of information that can be used to create awareness (on ICT standards and best practices) among managers of public entities D1.6\nR1.7 Develop an governance structure\nfor overseeing e-government & business-ICT investments in public entities\nGuide the definition of governance mechanisms for egovernment architecture effort by adapting TOGAF ADM guidelines on establishing an architecture governance framework D1.7\nR2.1 Develop a collaboration\nframework with universities to build human resource capacity for e-government implementations\nGuide the standardization of efforts on human resource capacity building for e-government by providing insights into aspects for stakeholder deliberation\nD2.1\nR2.2 Develop an e-government\nstrategic management and sustainability framework for aligning e-government priorities of public entities and their development partners\nGuide formulation of strategic drivers for e-government by adapting a project management perspective on defining the enterprise vision, mission, & strategic objectives\nD.2.2.1\nGuide the creation of a catalog on strategies for sustaining donor-driven e-government projects by guiding on how to synthesize & adopt existing success factors for donors/beneficiaries of e-government D.2.2.2\nR2.3 Develop a risk and mitigation\nmanagement framework for egovernment\nGuide the creation of a catalog of e-government risks and mitigations by providing insights into aspects for stakeholder deliberation D2.3\nR2.4 Establish a Public Private\nPartnerships (PPPs) programme for the shared development of egovernment infrastructure\nGuide the creation of a catalog on success factors for establishing PPPs for e-government infrastructure by providing insights into aspects for stakeholder deliberation\nD2.4\nR3.1 Develop guidelines for adopting\nexisting e-government interoperability standards and principles\nGuide the formulation of criteria/guidelines for choosing e-government interoperability standards by providing insights into how to adapt existing e-government interoperability frameworks\nD3.1\nR3.2 Adapt an enterprise architecture\nframework or approach to guide planning and implementation of coherent e-government solutions\nAdapt the phases of TOGAF ADM (preliminary phase and architecture vision phase) by underpinning/extending their steps and guidelines with e-government aspects associated with addressing requirements in column 2 D3.2\nR3.3 Develop a public participatory\napproach for e- enhancing stakeholder participation in planning, implementing, and evaluating e-government efforts\nGuide the formulation of a taxonomy on e-government stakeholder groups & involvement strategies & techniques by adapting: the project management guide on identifying & prioritizing key stakeholders; forms of egovernment; & group support techniques D3.3\nR3.4 Specify technologies that can be\nadopted to enable interoperability among existing heterogeneous e-government solutions\nGuide the formulation of criteria for evaluating and selecting appropriate middleware systems for enabling the integration of heterogeneous data sources by providing insights into aspects for stakeholder deliberation D3.4\nR3.5 Develop an approach for\nmonitoring and evaluating egovernment efforts\nGuide the formulation of criteria & measures for monitoring & evaluating e-government by providing insights into aspects for deliberation\nD3.5\nScoping the design, applicability, and adaptation contexts of EGEAF: the EGEAF concept can be adopted in both developing and developed economies. However, this article first contextualizes it to the context of Uganda, as an instance of a developing economy. This is because e-government aspects or activities that underlie steps in the two adapted phases of the TOGAF ADM were derived from strategic requirements that should be fulfilled to address challenges\nhindering e-government interoperability in developing economies like Uganda (step 3A in Figure 3). This specifies a situational dimension in EGEAF\u2019s design, whereby e-government activities that underlie adapted steps in TOGAF ADM are expected to differ when adapting EGEAF to support e-government advancement in a developed economy. Although some e-government aspects are similar and cut across developed and developing economies, there are some that contextually apply to only developing economies. Sections 4.1 to 4.3 discuss details and outputs of the three stages in Figure 3."

On the other hand, a governmental organization is a complex venture comprising traditional and interconnected sectors [101] that are made up of several agencies mandated to deliver specific public services. Thus, an enterprise in the context of e-government refers to a government agency or institution, or collection of government agencies or institutions in a specific sector or in all sectors of a country. This definition points to three levels of complexity in the government enterprise \u2013 Agency or Institution, Sector, and National levels as depicted in Figure 4. Various countries comprise at least 3 levels of government complexity, which are named differently depending on their governance needs [110]. Although the setting considered herein is one comprising three main levels of the government enterprise, the concept can be adapted to accommodate other levels of government.\nIn Figure 4, national level comprises the entity mandated to regulate all e-government implementations in a country, such as the Ministry of ICT in Uganda\u2019s context. Sector level comprises specific sectors or ministries responsible for delivering specific categories of services such as education services (Ministry of Education) and health services (Ministry of Health). Institution or agency level comprises departments and units that offer specific services in a particular sector or ministry. Institutions or agencies directly interact with other institutions,\nbusinesses, or citizens to provide Government to Government (G2G) services, Government to Business (G2B) services, or Government to Citizen (G2C) services. These services need to be supported by e-government implementations, where those managed at institution or agency level are regulated at sector level and those managed at sector level are regulated by the national level. These three levels are crucial when determining which guidelines of TOGAF ADM are relevant for creating an architecture vision of the government enterprise. This is elaborated in Section 4.2."

This involved adopting insights from other techniques or approaches (as indicated in Table 2 and Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.11). However, details of how the adoption of other techniques is done are beyond the scope of this article. Executing design decisions D1.1 to D3.1 and D3.3 to D3.5 yielded \u2018e-government development activities\u2019 coded A1.1 to A3.5 (for traceability), and D3.2 was decomposed into D3.2.1 to D3.2.3 (as indicated in Table 3). The egovernment development activities are perceived as components or modules that elaborate steps V1 to V11, and are to be executed by target users of EGEAF. Thus, Table 3 shows which design decisions are aligned with steps V1 to V11, and the resultant e-government development activities.\nTo derive a coherent design of EGEAF, steps V1 to V11 and e-government development activities A1.1 to A3.5 (as aligned in Table 3) were synthesized or orchestrated into a holistic view depicted in Figure 6.\nFigure 6 shows EGEAF as a process (based on TOGAF ADM) for guiding the development of e-government enterprise architectures \u2013 blueprints for informing and ensuring the development of interoperable e-government solutions. EGEAF has the following two core views:\na) Method View \u2013 the left side is the procedure for creating an e-government enterprise architecture vision. It is derived by integrating the adapted steps of TOGAF ADM (V1 to V11)\nin pane 1 of Figure 6 with design decisions D1.1 to D3.1 and D3.3 to D3.5, so as to obtain egovernment development activities A1.1 to A3.5 (in pane 2 of Figure 6). The unshaded height pane of Figure 6 presents the question log of EGEAF \u2013 a set of questions that need to be answered when executing each e-government development activity, to ensure that stakeholder deliberations yield desired outputs and products. Regarding the situational applicability of EGEAF, e-government activities in pane 2 are tailored to strategic constraints and requirements of e-government in Uganda as an instance of a developing economy. Also, the set of questions in the question log is tailored to strategic issues or requirements in a developing economy (that appear in Table 2). Thus, applying EGEAF in a developed economy requires one to adapt activities in pane 2 and questions in the question log, so that they accommodate strategic constraints or requirements of e-government in a developed economy. The method view is elaborated in Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.11. b) Product View \u2013 the right side shows products expected from executing EGEAF steps and activities in the method view. The synthesis of V1 to V11 and A1.1 to A3.5 yields four\nproducts coded P1 to P4 as indicated in Figure 6. The products are defined with respect to the\nstructural composition of the government enterprise. Thus, the top right of Figure 6 shows that EGEAF products comprise three levels of granularity \u2013 Institution or agency, Sector, and National levels. The three levels depict a hierarchical reasoning pattern that needs to be adopted to achieve interoperability in implementing e-government solutions. This implies the need to instantiate each EGEAF step and activity at these three levels. The product view is elaborated in Section 4.4.\nSections 4.3.1 to 4.3.11 discuss the following: motivation of each step in EGEAF; corresponding e-government development activities; a set of questions (discretely presented using text boxes) that guide execution of each activity, by providing stakeholders with a semi-structured thinking pattern for brainstorming and deliberating; and expected outputs and products."

The government enterprise involves various types of specializations that are cascaded in at least three levels of complexity (as depicted in Figure 4). Thus, stakeholders at the three levels need to agree on the strategic direction of e-government (mission, vision, goals, objectives, and strategies) at each level. To achieve this, activities A2.2.1 and A2.2.2 were defined to elaborate step V1 in EGEAF (Figure 6). This yields a shared framework for strategic management of e-government, which enables entities at a given level and their partners to mutually specify strategic drivers, actions, and sustainability mechanisms of e-government initiatives. Basing on strategic planning insights in [79], [111]\u2013[113], A2.2.1 prompts stakeholders to deliberate towards defining clear agency/institution level strategic drivers for e-government, that are aligned with sector and national level drivers for e-government. This alignment informs the design of coherent views of the e-government architecture at agency/institution, sector, and national levels.

However, most donor funded e-government projects are implemented without conducting comprehensive needs analysis with respect to context, and thus collapse when donor funding ends [21], [115]. To prevent this, activity A2.2.2 prompts stakeholders at agency or institution/ sector/ national levels of the government enterprise to create a catalogue of possible sustainability strategies that can be adopted to give assurance of long-term support for donor-driven e-government efforts. With such a catalogue, stakeholders can choose suitable sustainability strategies that can be adopted and contextualized or amended to specific settings at institution/ sector/ national levels.

In the context of the government enterprise, frameworks that can inform or can be affected by the development of the e-government enterprise architecture include operating models of units that constitute the e-government enterprise, e-government interoperability frameworks, and legal frameworks. Thus, activities A1.4 and A3.1 in step V4 of EGEAF (Figure 6) focus on prompting stakeholders to adopt these frameworks and explore or demonstrate the extent to which they directly and indirectly relate with the e-government enterprise architecture effort. Output from these activities is used to refine or complete outputs of steps V1 to V3 in the preceding sections. Activity A1.4 focuses on adapting existing frameworks to define guidelines for streamlining or standardizing information management (including sharing, re-use, and archival) in the government enterprise. This yields a framework for data and information management across e-government implementations. The text box coded V4:A1.4 provides guiding questions for this task.\n[V4:A1.4].

Interoperability is the ability of systems and devices to exchange data and interpret the shared data [34]. e-Government interoperability is the ability of two or more digital solutions (that support government operations) to interconnect\nand exchange data in a seamless way [54], [124]. Thus, e-government interoperability frameworks define minimum standards and principles or policies that government entities must adhere to when developing their digital solutions, so as to enable seamless information flow across all entities that constitute the public sector [54]. Interoperability of electronic systems is defined in 3 levels: technical level \u2013 specifying the type and size of data to be exchanged; semantic level \u2013 ensuring that data to be exchanged is interpreted by all actors in the same way; organizational interoperability \u2013 ensuring that expected actions on the exchanged data are mutually understood by all actors [34]. These insights are adopted to formulate questions (in the text box coded V4:A3.1) for guiding stakeholder deliberations on key contextual inputs and constraints for realizing interoperability across all levels of the government enterprise. Activity A3.1 yields a catalogue of e-government interoperability frameworks/standards, criteria for guiding the selection of their components to address particular types of interoperability needs, and measures of enforcing adherence to interoperability principles or guidelines in public entities.\n[V4:A3.1].

Since the government enterprise has a complex structure of at least 3 levels/tiers, it is imperative to specify the scope of the e-government architecture at each level with respect to resources and context of specific entities. To achieve this, step V5 in EGEAF (Figure 6) is enriched with activity A3.2.1 (which was initiated in Table 3). A3.2.1 involves specifying key aspects that shape the scope dimensions of e-government architecture development across all levels of the government enterprise. This is because the extent of e-government growth or maturity of each entity at any level is planned depending on the specific laws and unique concerns associated with exercising the mandate of that entity. Thus, the synthesis of V5 and A3.2.1 yields the scope specification for e-government implementations at institution, sector, and national levels.

This implies that products P1 to P4 are expected or obtained at 3 levels,\nas indicated in the following text box.\n\u2022 Institution/Agency Level Products (KP) = {KP1, KP2, KP3, KP4} \u2022 Sector Level Products (SP) = {SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4} \u2022 National Level Products (NP) = {NP1, NP2, NP3, NP4}\nWhere:\n\u2022 {KP1, SP1, NP1} = outputs of activities A1.1 to A1.7 executed in steps V3, V4, V7, V8, V9 \u2022 {KP2, SP2, NP2} = outputs of activities A2.1 to A2.4 executed in steps V1, V8, V9 \u2022 {KP3, SP3, NP3} = outputs of activities A3.1, A3.3 to A3.5 executed in steps V2, V4, V8 \u2022 {KP4, SP4, NP4} = outputs of activities A3.2.1 to A3.2.3 executed in steps V5, V6, V9\nTherefore, the full set of EGEAF Products {P1, P2, P3, P4} = {KP1-4 + SP1-4+ NP1-4}\n\u2022 Second, products from each level are aligned with products of other levels to ensure coherency. Specifically, institution level products are aligned with sector level products, and\nsector level products are aligned with national level products. Thus, the full product set of EGEAF (that is illustrated in Figure 6) is a consolidation of institution, sector, and national level products as indicated in the text box above."

            "text": "Evaluation of an artifact involves assessing its ability to address the requirements and purpose that motivated its development [138]. The \u2018ability\u2019 is often interpreted in terms of attributes such as functionality, completeness, understandability, consistency, accuracy, traceability, performance, reliability, feasibility, and usability [138]\u2013[140]. Design Science artifacts can be evaluated using analytical, experimental, observational, or descriptive methods [86]. Depending on available resources and the purpose of an artifact, these methods can all be used to gradually improve the quality of an artifact. The purpose of EGEAF is to guide the development of an e-government enterprise architecture, that serves as a coherent blueprint for supporting the planning and implementation of interoperable e-government solutions in developing economies. Thus, prior to using other evaluation methods, it was vital to first evaluate EGEAF using analytical evaluation methods. Analytical evaluation is achieved through: (a) static analysis \u2013 assessing static attributes of the structure of an artifact such as understandability and complexity; and (b) dynamic analysis \u2013 assessing dynamic attributes of an artifact in use such as response time and performance [86]. Given the limited resources of the study, it was cost effective to first use static analysis to evaluate the design and feasibility of EGEAF. This section presents findings on the static attributes of EGEAF. Static analysis of EGEAF was done using two iterations that were conducted in Uganda. The first iteration involved using a field demo (as elaborated in Section 5.1). The second iteration involved using a group structured walkthrough (as elaborated in Section 5.2). Findings from these iterations are discussed in Section 5.3."

In this study, the field demo was first chosen to ensure that the relevance of specific steps and activities of EGEAF is assessed. Achieving this required that EGEAF steps and activities are executed in a setting with a limited scope, and the corresponding outputs generated. Thus, the field demo was setup as follows:\n\u2022 Aim of demo: to determine whether EGEAF can be followed to guide the design of an egovernment enterprise architecture (as a blueprint for enabling planning and implementation\nof interoperable e-government solutions) in an agency/institution level entity in Uganda.\n\u2022 Type of entity considered: An institution level public entity, that is mandate to manage the planning and delivery of quality services in one of Uganda\u2019s urban cities. In the city\u2019s area of\njurisdiction, the entity oversees the delivery of services such as physical planning, construction, public health, environment preservation, waste management, education, social welfare, youth and community development, and revenue collection for city maintenance.\n\u2022 Key participant(s) involved and context: The tasks involved in the validation required the validator to have a general understanding of two concepts \u2013 enterprise architecture and e-\ngovernment interoperability. At the time the validation was done in the entity indicated above, only one person (i.e., Project Manager or Task Leader of Business Process Reengineering, who also served as the enterprise architect of the entity) understood the concept of enterprise architecture and would comfortably participate in the validation sessions of EGEAF.\n\u2022 Duration and agenda of the validation sessions: Four (4) discrete sessions were conducted in a period of three months. The 1st and 2nd sessions involved walkthrough discussions of\nEGEAF design and its question log (that is discretely presented using the various text boxes in Section 4.3.1 to 4.3.11). The 3rd session involved using output from the first two sessions to design the e-government architecture vision of one of the core programmes of the entity indicated above. The programme\u2019s architecture vision was then discussed in the 4th session.\n\u2022 Inputs: EGEAF model (in Figure 6), EGEAF question log (see text boxes discretely presented in Section 4.3.1 to 4.3.11), and a design evaluation instrument. The evaluation instrument\ncomprised questions that prompted for the validator\u2019s opinion on the design and feasibility of EGEAF.\n\u2022 Output: e-government architecture vision of one of the core programmes of the entity indicated above; and feedback on EGEAF design and feasibility (presented in Table 4)."

            "text": "A field demo could only be conducted in one enterprise setting at a given time, and it requires a lot of time to be conducted to completion. Thus, the second iteration sought a cost effective way that could be used to obtain feedback on the design and understandability of EGEAF from target users in different organization settings. This implied that a sample of target users had to be engaged to evaluate EGEAF design by not executing its steps and activities, but by assessing its structural composition or design orchestration. Thus, a group walkthrough was considered to be the most appropriate form of static analysis and validation in iteration 2. Walkthroughs are used to engage experts in a specific field to analytically assess an artifact by chronologically reviewing its design, so as to identify possible usage problems, errors, omissions, violations, inconsistences, and vagueness [142], [143]. Accordingly, procedures recommended by Sharp et al [142] and Jody [143] were adapted to derive the setup of the group walkthrough that was used as follows:\n\u2022 Aim of the group walkthrough validation: to further determine whether the design and purpose of EGEAF was understandable to target users from different enterprise settings.\n\u2022 Key participant(s) involved: Six (6) ICT professionals working in public entities in Uganda. Three participants worked in public entities at institution level of the government enterprise,\nand three worked in entities at sector level. The kind of work that they did involve tasks that are associated with the planning, implementing, and maintaining software and hardware solutions for e-government realization in their respective entities. Participants had a general understanding of the concepts of enterprise architecture and e-government interoperability.\n\u2022 Agenda/context, supporting tools, and duration: Two discrete sessions were conducted. Session 1 involved walkthrough discussions of EGEAF design, its question log, and expected\noutputs and products. This was a virtual session supported by Zoom. Thereafter, participants were given two weeks to independently review EGEAF design documents. Session 2 involved eliciting feedback from participants on the design of EGEAF. Session 2 was also virtual session supported by both Zoom and MeetingWizard. Zoom was used to enable dialog between participants; and MeetingWizard was used as the Group Support System, to enable systematic elicitation and consolidation of views from participants.\n\u2022 Inputs: EGEAF model (in Figure 6), the question log (in text boxes that are discretely presented in Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.11), and a design evaluation tool that was used in iteration\n1 to prompt validators to comment on the design of EGEAF.\n\u2022 Output: Feedback on the design and composition of EGEAF (presented in Table 4)."

            "heading": "5.3. Discussion of Validation Findings",
            "text": "Validation findings point to three issues that are elaborated below:\nFirst, background knowledge that target users need to have prior to using EGEAF. From the design of EGEAF, it was observed that target users of EGEAF need to have basic understanding of: a) issues hindering e-government growth in developing economies; and b) enterprise architecture. This guided the selection of participants in the two iterations. Validation findings justify our choice of only engaging validators who had some background understanding of e-\ngovernment and enterprise architecture. In various public entities in developing economies like Uganda, most personnel have a good understanding of e-government, but limited understanding of enterprise architecture. Thus, further validation of EGEAF will ensure that training of participants or target users on basic concepts of enterprise architecture, is prioritized as one of the initial activities in the evaluation protocol of EGEAF. Unfortunately, this would increase the time for using or evaluating the artifact in a given setting.\nSecond, qualitative feedback on the design and understandability of EGEAF. Given the aim of validation in both iterations, it was considered appropriate to first elicit qualitative views from validators, so as to obtain specific insights on how to improve the design of EGEAF. As indicated in Table 4, issues were highlighted on the question log, outputs, products, and missing aspects in the EGEAF design. The revised design of EGEAF (that is presented in Section 4) has addressed the issue on specifying the relationship between the outputs and products of EGEAF. The issues on missing aspects and templates will be addressed in future versions of EGEAF design. The issue on too many questions in the question log could hardly be addressed, because the questions help stakeholders to deliberate on the critical issues on architecture-driven e-government development. However, the proposed addition of templates for capturing and assessing responses to the questions could reduce the number of questions.\nThird, the need for templates that elaborate how responses to questions should be recorded and synthesized. Efforts are ongoing to address this need in future versions of EGEAF design. The templates will also address the issue on how specific outputs of EGEAF activities are consolidated into a specific product. The templates will also show how a team of EGEAF users in an enterprise can collaboratively manage the various questions that stakeholders need to deliberate when creating an e-government architecture."

            "heading": "6 Conclusion and Ongoing Work",
            "text": "Our earlier research efforts yielded a taxonomy of requirements for achieving e-government interoperability in developing economies. This article extends that effort by adopting a Design Science approach to derive a framework of fundamental elements to address the requirements of realizing e-government interoperability. To derive the framework, the elements are synthesized and orchestrated by adapting steps in two phases of TOGAF ADM \u2013 preliminary phase and architecture vision phase. The synthesis and orchestration yielded a TOGAF based 11-Step model for creating an e-government enterprise architecture, that was blended with e-government activities or guidelines that exist in literature. This whole process yielded what can be perceived as an initial version of an E-Government Enterprise Architecture Framework (EGEAF) for Uganda as an instance of a developing economy, which is the key output of this article.\nEGEAF comprises two views \u2013 method view and product view. The method view provides a detailed procedure for creating an e-government enterprise architecture, that accommodates egovernment needs at institution, sector, national levels of a government enterprise in a developing economy. The method view shows steps and activities to be executed, a comprehensive question log to guide the execution of activities and expected outputs. The product view shows specific outputs that are synthesized into e-government products at institution, sector, and national levels of the e-government enterprise. EGEAF was evaluated using two iterations. The first iteration involved a field demo that was conducted in a public entity in Uganda, and the second iteration involved a group walkthrough with ICT professionals who worked in public entities in Uganda. Validation findings indicate that EGEAF is feasible and its design is understandable to a large extent, and highlighted considerations that had to be made to improve the design of EGEAF. Some recommendations have been addressed in the current version of EGEAF that is presented herein, while others are to be addressed in future work as indicated below.\nOngoing and future work. First, ongoing work on EGEAF entails developing visual templates that can be used along with the question log of EGEAF to guide stakeholder deliberations and document findings. The templates will also serve as an additional user guide for operationalizing\nEGEAF elements at institution, sector and national levels of the government enterprise. Second, plans are underway to instantiate EGEAF in real settings (with unrestricted scope) of egovernment implementation efforts at institution, sector, and national levels. This will provide more insights into ways of further improving the design and usability of EGEAF. Third, the scope and level of detail in EGEAF will be extended using an incremental approach, by adapting other phases of TOGAF ADM (besides the preliminary and architecture vision phase which have been considered in this article). Fourth, EGEAF will be extended to guide architecture-driven egovernment implementations in other developing economies and in developed economies. However, these extensions require one to first derive taxonomies of issues affecting full growth of e-government in other developing economies and in developed economies. These issues will then be used as a basis to define e-government activities that are relevant for architecture-driven egovernment in other developing economies and in a developed economy."
