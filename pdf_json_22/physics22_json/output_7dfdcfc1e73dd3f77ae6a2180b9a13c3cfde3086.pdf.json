    "abstractText": "Effective scaffolds for bone-tissue-engineering are those that combine adequate mechanical and chemical performance with osseointegrative, angiogenetic and anti-bacterial modes of bioactivity. To address these requirements via a combined approach, we additively manufactured square strut scaffolds by robocasting precipitation-derived strontium/copper co-substituted diopside. Microstructure, mechanical performance, bioactivity, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity were examined. The results show that the presence of strontium and copper in the diopside lattice reduces the grain size and increases the density of the ceramics. The compressive strength, hardness, and fracture toughness of the diopside showed improvement, attributed to a finer microstructure and improved sintering. Scaffolds had excellent compressive strength with a high porosity (68-72%), which is attributed to the structure of the stacked-square-struts. All materials showed good in vitro bioactivity and favorable proliferation of osteogenic sarcoma cells, while strontium/copper co-doped materials exhibited the strongest antiEscherichia coli activity. We show that across multiple indicators this system offers pathways towards high-performance bone substitutes.",

To address these requirements via a combined approach, we additively manufactured square strut scaffolds by robocasting precipitation-derived strontium/copper co-substituted diopside. Microstructure, mechanical performance, bioactivity, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity were examined. The results show that the presence of strontium and copper in the diopside lattice reduces the grain size and increases the density of the ceramics. The compressive strength, hardness, and fracture toughness of the diopside showed improvement, attributed to a finer microstructure and improved sintering. Scaffolds had excellent compressive strength with a high porosity (68-72%), which is attributed to the structure of the stacked-square-struts. All materials showed good in vitro bioactivity and favorable proliferation of osteogenic sarcoma cells, while strontium/copper co-doped materials exhibited the strongest antiEscherichia coli activity. We show that across multiple indicators this system offers pathways towards high-performance bone substitutes.\nKeywords: Bone-Tissue-Engineering; Diopside; Bioceramics; Bioactive materials;\nAntibacterial activity\nDOI: 10.1016/j.bioadv.2022.213230"

            "text": "The field of bone-tissue-engineering has undergone significant development in the past two decades. New understandings of tissue regeneration and bioactive materials have paved the way for the application of implantable ceramic scaffolds into which bone-tissue may grow. Such tissue engineering can facilitate the treatment of large, hitherto untreatable bone defects arising from tumors, trauma and congenital defects. Polycrystalline silicate ceramics have been emerging in recent years as attractive biomaterials [1]. Although the solubility of bioceramics is generally lower than that of bioglasses, the diverse functionality that has been achieved in these materials, alongside their generally favorable mechanical properties motivates their use as bone-tissueengineering materials [2, 3]. When considering the fracture toughness of bioceramics, diopside stands out from other ceramics with values in the range of 2.8 \u2013 4 MPa m 1/2 [4-6]. Our recent study on copper modified diopside was in agreement with this range of fracture toughness and showed some further toughening as the result of copper inclusion, possibly as the result of enhanced sintering behavior, which is typical of cationsubstituted compounds [7]. Numerous studies have shown that copper ions and their release from bioceramics accelerate vascularization, bone tissue regeneration and hinder various types of bacterial infection [8-11]. However, the amount of copper included in bioceramics should not exceed a certain limit, otherwise, it will disrupt the intracellular balance and produce cytotoxicity. We have recently reported that copper substitution for magnesium in well-sintered diopside was cytocompatible up to 1 at.% relative to magnesium [7].\nIn numerous ceramic structures, strontium has been shown to readily substitute at calcium sites, unsurprisingly as strontium lies directly below calcium on the\nperiodic table [12-14]. Substitutional strontium doping has been successfully explored in diverse systems as an avenue towards improving osseointegration, vascularisation, biodegradation, and fracture toughness of bioceramics [15, 16]. In bone tissue engineering, of particular value is the intrinsic tendency of bioavailable strontium to stimulate bone regeneration and osteogenetic differentiation, proposed to be mediated by the modulation of the Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, while hindering bone resorption through the inhibition of osteoclast activity [17, 18]. Reportedly, these modes of bioactivity may be further enhanced through a synergy of strontium and silicon in bioceramics [19]. Confirming these mechanisms, the inclusion of strontium in biomaterials of various forms has shown promising results towards the treatment of osteoporosis in a raft of in vitro and in vivo studies [20, 21].\nCo-substitution, where multiple different cations are substituted at nonequivalent sites in a ceramic lattice, poses an effective strategy towards the extraction of increased levels of multi-mode bioactive performance in a given crystalline bioceramic phase, while avoiding potentially problematic effects that may arise from an excessively high level of a single dopant, such as cytotoxicity for the case of copper. By inducing lattice distortion and fluxing effects, co-substitution is a logical approach to achieving simultaneous improvements to biodegradability and sinterability of crystalline bioceramics. The rationale of the present study is therefore to implement the co-substitution of copper and strontium at the M1 (magnesium) and M2 (calcium) octahedral sites respectively in the clinopyroxene structure of diopside, with a view towards achieving a tough material with high bioactive performance. The similarity in ionic size of calcium/strontium and magnesium/copper is conducive to this substitution scheme and indeed in akermanite, full substitution of strontium at calcium sites and copper at magnesium sites is known to be possible [22].\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) technology allows the fabrication of scaffolds with tailored geometries and is increasingly being used in clinical treatments [23]. Robocasting is an AM technology based on the direct extrusion of slurry that allows the fabrication of ceramic green bodies in diverse and complex forms, which circumvents the limitations of conventional scaffold production techniques to accommodate complicated bone defects [24, 25]. Traditionally, a nozzle with a circular outlet is used to print scaffolds in woodpile structures or similar geometries, which leads to stress concentration and is not conducive to manufacturing a high-strength scaffold, whereas a nozzle with a square outlet can overcome this drawback. In this work, considering the mechanical strength and biocompatibility of polycrystalline diopside and inspired by the opportunities afforded by the inclusion of strontium and copper in bioceramics, we fabricated square strut diopside scaffolds co-doped with strontium and copper using a robocasting approach, and evaluated the mechanical properties, antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of the scaffolds. The results presented here show how this design rationale may facilitate multifunctional bioceramics for bone-tissueengineering."

Tetraethyl orthosilicate ((C2H5O)4Si, TEOS, VWR Chemicals) was subsequently added to the solution to achieve the atomic ratio of Ca: Mg: Si= 1: 1: 2, and\nthe resulting solution was stirred for 2 h. Precipitation of the silicate was achieved by the addition of 25 wt.% aqueous ammonia (Merck) into the solution and the resulting suspension was stirred overnight. The precipitated product was centrifuged, washed, dried overnight at 90\u00b0C, and calcined at 900\u00b0C for 2 h. Similar steps were taken to synthesize strontium substituted diopside powders by replacing the stoichiometric amount of CaCl2 with 2 at.% of strontium chloride (SrCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) to produce Ca0.98Sr0.02MgSi2O6 (named Sr-DIO). To achieve co-doped diopside, SrCl2 and copper chloride (CuCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were added at an atomic ratio of Ca: Sr: Mg: Cu: Si = 0.98: 0.02: 0.99: 0.01: 2, giving the composition of Ca0.98Sr0.02Mg0.99Cu0.01Si2O6 (named Sr/Cu-DIO).

The functional groups of the sintered powders were examined using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Bruker Equinox 55, Germany) in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. By employing monochromatic\nAl K Alpha at 1 \u03bcA and 2 kV during X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an Escalab 250250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), the chemical state and elemental\ncomposition of the samples were investigated. The calibrated C1s for the XPS spectra is 284.8 eV. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to confirm the quantities of strontium and copper in Sr-DIO and Sr/Cu-DIO samples in an ICP Ultima2 (Horiba, Japan). To achieve this, samples were digested in an autoclave at\n220\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh with the addition of H2SO4, H3PO4, and HF in an aqueous solution. The microstructure of the sintered scaffolds was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, LEO Gemini 1530, Germany) with acceleration voltage varying from 3 to 10 kV. An LS 13320 laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA) was used to analyze the particle size in an ultrasonically dispersed aqueous solution. The apparent density and apparent porosity of the scaffolds were estimated using the Archimedes method based on the following equations [27]:\nApparent density \uff1d Wd\nWw\u2212Ws (1)\nApparent porosity (%) \uff1d Ww\u2212Wd\nWw\u2212Ws \u00d7 100 (2)\nwhere Ww represents the weight of the scaffold with water, Wd is the dry weight of the scaffold, and Ws represents the wet weight of the scaffolds suspended in water. Six replicates of the measurements were performed.\nThe Vickers hardness (HV) and fracture toughness (KIC) values of the scaffolds were measured on polished surfaces using a microhardness indenter (Zwick, 3212001/00, Germany) in accordance with\nISO 21618 standard, by applying a 5\u202fkg load\nwith a dwell time of 15\u202fs. Values of HV and KIC were calculated as:\nHV = 0.001854 F\n(2a)2 (3)\nKIC = 0.000978 ( E\nHV )\n0.4 ( F\nc1.5 ) (4)\nWhere F is the applied force (N), a is the mean half-length diagonal value (mm), E is Young's modulus, which was evaluated by a TriboIndenter (Hysitron TI950, Bruker Corporation, USA) equipped with a standard\nBerkovich diamond indenter tip, c is the mean half crack length (mm). Ten indentations for each group were used to obtain the average values along with their standard deviations.\nThe compressive strengths of bulk materials and scaffolds were determined on the basis of sintered pellets with 8 mm diameter and additively manufactured squareand round-strut scaffolds (5\u00d75\u00d710 mm3). Compression of specimens was conducted between flat platens at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min using a mechanical testing machine equipped with a 10 kN load cell (Zwick/Roell, Germany). Measurements were conducted in eight replicates.\n2.5. In vitro bioactivity evaluation\nTo assess the osseointegrative bioactivity of the scaffolds, the scaffolds were immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37\u00b0C for 28 days, as proposed by Kokubo et al. [28]. During the soaking period, the SBF solution was refreshed every 3 days. After 28 days of soaking, the scaffolds were dried at 60\u00b0C for 24 h and evaluated by SEM (Zeiss DSM 982 Gemini, Germany) and XRD.\n2.6. In vitro cell studies\nThe influence of Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds on cell behavior was studied using human osteogenic sarcoma cells (Saos-2 cells, Charit\u00e9, Department of Periodontology, Oral medicine and Oral surgery). The Saos-2 cells were cultured in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2). For cell culture, a complete medium was used and replaced every other day. Specifically, Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM, High Glucose, Biowest) with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-Glutamine was used for Saos-2 cells. Scaffold extracts were prepared by immersing 2 g scaffold in 10 mL serum-free medium and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The supernatant was then collected and subsequently sterilized through a filter (Millipore, 0.22 mm), followed by supplementation of 10% FBS.\nCell viability assay\n2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide sodium salt (XTT sodium salt, Alfa Aesar) was used to assess cell viability after exposure to scaffold extracts, as described by Wu et al. [29]. Briefly, after seeding the cells in 96-well culture plates, the supernatant in the\nexperimental well was changed for 100 \u03bcL scaffold extract, and XTT solution with phenazine methosulfate (PMS, AppliChem, Germany) was added to each experimental well after 1, 3, and 7 days of incubation. After 4 h of incubation, the absorbance of the supernatant at 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader (Tecan Austria GmbH). As a control, fresh medium was tested under the same conditions. And fresh medium with XTT solution was set as background. The test was conducted in six replicates.\nTo assess cell viability on the scaffolds, Saos-2 cells were stained using a live/dead staining kit (L3224, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, after seeding cells on the scaffold for 48 h, the scaffolds were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS),\nfollowed by the addition of 2 \u03bcM ethidium\nhomodimer-1 and 2 \u03bcM calcein AM to the experimental wells and incubation in an incubator for 15 min. Fluorescence microscope (Observer Z1, Zeiss) was then used to observe fluorescence in three repetitions. Green fluorescence represents living cells, while red fluorescence indicates dead cells.\nImmunofluorescence staining\nSaos-2 cells were seeded onto the scaffolds and cultured for 48 h prior to immunofluorescence staining of Actin. Concisely, the scaffolds were fixed with Histofix Eco solution (ROTI\u00ae Histofix ECO Plus, Roth) for 15 min and washed with PBS for two times. The samples were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and washed with PBS twice, as well as blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the filamentous actin (F-actin) was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen\u2122, 1:400)\nfor 2 h, followed by nuclear labelling with\n4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, 1 mg/mL) for 30 min. After each staining, the scaffolds were rinsed with PBS so as to reduce the imaging background. Finally, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope and the cell spreading area on the scaffolds was measured using the Image J software."

            "text": "Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of sintered scaffolds. It can be observed that DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds\nconsist of single-phase diopside (PDF#721497), with no discernible presence of other crystalline phases. In order to show the effect of strontium and copper substitution on the diopside lattice, the enlarged patterns of the sharpest peak between 29.5\u00b0\u201330.1\u00b0 are displayed in Fig. 2b. In comparison to the DIO material, diffraction peaks from Sr-DIO and Sr/Cu-DIO samples are shifted to slightly\nlower 2\u03b8 values indicating lattice expansion, which is due to the larger ionic radius of Sr2+ (1.26 \u00c5, CN=8) relative to Ca2+ (1.12 \u00c5, CN=8), and the ionic radius values are taken from R. D. Shannon [30]. Due to the similar radii of Cu2+ (0.73 \u00c5, CN=6) and Mg2+ (0.72 \u00c5, CN=6) in octahedral coordination, the substitution of copper at magnesium sites is not anticipated to cause considerable lattice distortion at low doping levels as confirmed\nThe FTIR spectra of the sintered samples are shown in Fig. 2c to confirm the XRD analysis and verify the insertion of strontium and copper into the structure. In DIO, the peaks at 462 and 502\u202fcm\u22121 were attributed to the bending vibrations of O-MgO. The bending vibration of O-Si-O was\nresponsible for the peaks at 635 and 674\u202fcm\u22121. Additionally, two other peaks at 866 and 918\u202fcm\u22121 corresponded to the stretching mode of Si-O. The symmetric stretching of SiO was also attributed to the peaks at around 962 and 1065\u202fcm\u22121. The vibrations of the functional groups of the diopside are in good\nagreement with all of the measured FTIR peaks [31], consistent with the XRD analysis. The other major parts of the Si-O vibrations are not shifted, except for the peak shift of the Si-O stretching mode to 858 cm\u22121 for the Sr/Cu-DIO sample, and the peak shift of the symmetric stretching of Si-O to 1062\u202f cm\u22121 and 1060 cm\u22121 for the Sr-DIO and Sr/CuDIO samples, respectively. The observed\nchange in wavenumbers of the Si-O group is due to the fact that Sr2+ has a larger ionic radius than Ca2+ and therefore partially reduces the symmetry of the Si-O bond when calcium is partially substituted by strontium in the diopside lattice, leading to a change in vibrational frequency [32]. For Sr/Cu-DIO, due to the partial replacement of magnesium by copper, the O-Mg-O displayed a decreased intensity[33]. These observations\nare consistent with the presence of strontium or strontium/copper in the diopside structure.\nThe surface elemental composition as well as the chemical state of the sample were evaluated by XPS. Fig. 3a shows typical XPS survey scans of DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/CuDIO, all of which contained the expected components of diopside, Ca, Mg, Si, and O. In Fig. 3b, the characteristic peak of Sr 3d was detected in both Sr-DIO and Sr/Cu-DIO samples, and the Sr 3d spectrum was deconvoluted into two double peaks, 3d3/2 at 133.1 eV and 3d5/2 at 134.8 eV, indicating the presence of Sr2+. Interestingly, strontium doping slightly increases the binding energy of Ca 2p from 346.7 eV for DIO to 347.5 eV (2Sr-DIO) and 347.4 eV (2Sr/Cu-DIO), respectively, due to the entry of strontium into the diopside lattice and the substitution of calcium sites, which is consistent with previous studies [34, 35]. In addition, the Cu 2p energy spectrum was detected in 2Sr/CuDIO, as shown in Fig. 3c, with two main peaks at 951.4 eV and 931.5 eV, corresponding to Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2,\nrespectively. The characteristic satellite peak of Cu2+ is located at 941.8 eV [36]. The Cu 2p spectrum is fitted to only one Gauss-Lorentz peak, indicating that the copper in the 2Sr/Cu-DIO sample is mainly in the form of Cu2+ [37]. To confirm this observation, elemental analysis was performed by ICPOES. Results indicated a strontium content in the Sr-DIO sample of 1.67 at.%, while the strontium content in the Sr/Cu-DIO sample is 1.66 at.%, and the copper content is 0.62 at.%, with theoretical values of 2 at.% and 1 at.%, respectively. The ICP-OES results show that strontium and copper are successfully incorporated into diopside, and while the experimental values are smaller than the theoretical values, this is likely caused by incomplete solubility of silicates during the test, a known problem for such materials.\nFig. 4a-c presents SEM micrographs of DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds. The morphology of diopside was not significantly changed by the substitution of strontium and\ncopper, and the sintered scaffolds showed uniform microstructure with irregularly shaped grains. In comparison with unmodified diopside, a slight decrease in grain size was observed in the Sr-DIO and Sr/Cu-DIO materials on the basis of SEM images, which is consistent with the laser diffraction particle size analyzer result in Fig. 4d, while the high median size measured by particle size analyzer is most likely due to particle agglomeration during measurement [38]. The SEM results\nindicate that the strontium and copper substitution into the diopside structure limits the grain growth that occurs during sintering. Indeed, such ion substitution is known to inhibit grain growth by pinning grain boundaries in ceramic materials, thereby improving mechanical strength [39-41]. Furthermore, the sintered Sr/Cu-DIO exhibited a denser structure, an expected result of the greater fluxing which occurs through the co-substitution of different ions.\nSr/Cu-DIO; (d) Particle size distribution of sintered powders (n = 3)."

The results show that the porosity of DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds are 72.2 \u00b1 1.6, 71.1 \u00b1 1.1, and 68.4 \u00b1 1.8%, respectively, all of which would be adequate to induce effective cell ingrowth within the scaffold. As seen in microstructural analysis by SEM (Fig. 4), the substitution of strontium or the co-substitution of strontium and copper both increased the apparent density of the materials, a result of the aforementioned fluxing effect that cation substitution tends to have. The intrinsic mechanical properties of biomaterials play an important role in their processing and in vivo performance. The improved mechanical strength arising from the co-addition of strontium and copper ions can be related to their improved intrinsic fracture toughness, with a value of 3.23 \u00b1 0.31\u202fMPa\u202fm1/2 being attained. As will be discussed, grain boundaries have a significant influence on crack resistance, therefore the rise in HV and\nKIC values of Sr/Cu-DIO may be related to its dense structure and small grain size [44]. For the square strut woodpile structure scaffolds produced here, as shown in Fig. 5, the compressive strength improved with strontium and copper substitution, with values for DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds being 43.42 \u00b1 4.36, 45.34 \u00b1 5.65, and 49.75 \u00b1 5.48 MPa, respectively, while the compressive strength of the round strut Sr/Cu-DIO scaffold is significantly lower. The extrinsic, structure-driven strength of bone scaffolds can be engineered through the design of fabrication processes. The use of square struts in the scaffolds produced here reduces the stress concentration that generally occurs in the more common robocasting of round strut profiles and allowed the attainment of higher levels of compressive strength [45]. In addition, in order to characterize the effect of strontium and copper inclusion on the compressive strength of bulk diopside materials, compressive tests were conducted on pellets, with results confirming the significant increase in strength by strontium doping or strontium/copper codoping (Fig. 5).\n3.3. In vitro bioactivity\nThe osseointegrative bioactivity of DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds was assessed by their ability to form precipitated apatite layers during immersion in SBF. Fig. 6 shows the SEM micrographs of the scaffolds after 28 days of immersion in SBF. Compared to the morphology before soaking (Fig. 4), the surfaces of the DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO\nscaffolds were significantly altered, exhibiting extensive coverage by flake-like apatite precipitates, characteristic of bioactive ceramics. Further XRD measurements of the immersed scaffold showed peaks at 21.7\u00b0, 22.7\u00b0, 26.2\u00b0, and 31.8\u00b0, which are attributed to the (2 0 0), (1 1 1), (0 0 2), and (2 1 1) planes of hydroxyapatite (PDF#74-0565), confirming this and indicating high levels of bioactivity of the scaffolds."

As indicated by the images shown in Fig. 8a-c, Saos-2 cells adhered well to Sr-DIO and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds, and the ratio of live/dead cells on the scaffolds shown in Fig. 8d is consistent with the results of the cell\nviability test. In addition, the morphology of Saos-2 cells on DIO, Sr-DIO, and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds was examined by immunofluorescence staining. The fluorescence micrographs clearly showed that the cytoskeletal structure of Saos-2 cells spread well on the scaffold after 48 h of culture (Fig. 8e-g). It can be seen that F-actin was observed in all scaffolds, indicating that the incorporation of strontium or strontium/copper into the diopside scaffold had no negative effect on the adhesion of Saos2 cells. Further quantitative analysis showed that the spreading area of Saos-2 cells was greater for Sr-DIO and Sr/Cu-DIO scaffolds compared to the one for DIO scaffold, with Sr-DIO being the most significant (Fig. 8h). This finding suggests that Sr-DIO and Sr/CuDIO scaffolds have good in vitro biocompatibility, indicating their high level of appropriateness as bone scaffolds, enabling the in-growth of newly formed bone and blood vessels.\nDIO scaffold surface for 48 h.

The antibacterial inhibition rate of DIO was around 42%, as indicated in Fig. 9a. Compared to DIO, the Sr-DIO scaffold showed stronger antibacterial activity, with\nthe highest antibacterial activity observed on Sr/Cu-DIO scaffold. This result is further supported by Fig. 9b, which displays the results of antibacterial activity evaluated by the agar diffusion method and the quantitative results of the inhibition zone are presented in Fig. 9c. This also indicates that the native antibacterial activity of DIO was significantly enhanced by the inclusion of strontium and copper."

            "text": "Of the various bioactive silicates, those containing magnesium often draw attention due to their good mechanical properties, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. In this study, we investigated the fabrication and functionality of 3D printed bioceramic scaffolds based on strontium and copper doped diopside. Strontium and copper are readily incorporated into the single-phase diopside structure, substituting for calcium at the M2 site and for magnesium at the M1 site of the pyroxene structure. The microstructure of substituted and cosubstituted materials was moderately altered with these having a higher density, fewer voids, and smaller grains. Strontium/copper co-doped samples clearly showed greater densification than the single-site doped material, an expected consequence of the fluxing effect of mixed cation occupancy. Fracture toughness and Vickers hardness followed the same trend as densification in the\nstudied materials, with the co-doped materials showing a moderate improvement to unmodified diopside. Based on commonly observed trends in the fracture of polycrystalline ceramics, it can be postulated that enhanced sintering and finer microstructure are what contributed here to the higher fracture toughness in these materials, which followed the same trend as density and microstructure fineness [14, 46- 48].\nThe fracture toughness values measured in materials fabricated here are consistent with previous reports showing a relatively high fracture toughness for diopside ceramics [4-7]. For co-substituted materials here, fracture toughness in terms of KIC was improved and reached approximately 3.23 MPa\u00b7m1/2. These values are among the highest reported for a non-fibre-reinforced bioactive ceramic, and compare favorably even to some of the toughest bioglass ceramics [49, 50]. For bioactive ceramics, higher values of KIC enable the fabrication of higher surface area\nstructures that are conducive to accelerated resorption and osseointegration while maintaining the necessary application-specific mechanical performance. In this study, scaffolds were produced by robocasting of a woodpile structure with square crosssectional member profiles as opposed to the more common round profile struts used in such AM methods. The production of scaffolds having square profile members results in lower stress concentration at strut intersections and further contributes to a higher level of compressive strength in such scaffolds compared with scaffolds produced with round-profile members (Fig. 5). A biological scaffold material's porosity threshold is around 60%, below which it does not offer enough space for cell growth [51]. In this work, scaffolds with porosity greater than 68% showed higher compressive strength and hardness than cancellous bone [42].\nAn essential requirement for materials in bone-tissue engineering scaffolds is the ability to form a bioactive apatite layer on the surface, which facilitates binding to growing tissue, and effective bone regeneration. This is known as osseointegrative bioactivity. In this work, after 28 days of immersion in SBF, hydroxyapatite layers were clearly observed on the surface of all scaffolds, indicating the ability of scaffolds from these materials to maintain a strong interface with growing human bones and effectuate the healing. For osteoconductive and angiogenic bioactivity, cell adhesion and growth are important characteristics, with cell viability being mainly influenced by the ionic dissociation products of the biomaterial. Certain concentrations of strontium and copper doping have been shown to be beneficial for osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration in vivo and in vitro [21, 52, 53]. Yin et al. produced borate-based glass scaffolds doped with different concentrations of strontium, confirming that the presence of strontium suppressed the rapid release of borate, significantly improving cell proliferation and reducing cytotoxicity [54]. Zhao et al. developed a strontium-doped calcium\nphosphate bioceramic that promotes local bone regeneration and osseointegration, which is a safe bone substitute for the treatment of bone defects [34]. In this work, 2 at.% strontium-doped diopside clearly enhanced cell viability and proliferation, which is consistent with observations in previous studies of strontium-doped bioceramics. However, when strontium and copper were co-doped into diopside (Sr/CuDIO), the cell viability was lower than that of Sr-DIO. This may be due to the distorted lattice which allows a more rapid release of copper ions into the medium, thus increasing solubility. In our previous study, 1 at.% copper doped diopside was demonstrated to have enhanced cell viability [7], and magnesium, calcium, silicon and strontium ions have been shown to be beneficial elements for bone regeneration [16, 55]. However, above a certain level, the high concentration of ionic dissociation products leads to high pH values, which can be detrimental to cells [14]. Nevertheless, the cell viability of the Sr/Cu-DIO scaffold is better than that of pure diopside and cells exposed to this material spread over a larger area, demonstrating that the co-doping of strontium and copper had a favorable effect on the biocompatibility of diopside.\nA further important mode of bioactivity in materials used for bone repair is antibacterial activity, which serves to inhibit infection in the region of the bone defect. Choudhary et al. showed that diopside nanopowder had a native inhibitory effect on gram-positive and negative bacteria due to the release of calcium and magnesium ions from the diopside which increased the pH in the bacterial medium, thereby inhibiting the growth of bacteria [56]. Recent studies have shown that strontium inhibits the growth of E. coli, and the inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported [57-59]. In our work, we can postulate that the 2 at.% strontium doping (Sr-DIO) improved the inhibition of E. coli by DIO through the enhanced release of alkaline earth ions from the pyroxene lattice (calcium,\nmagnesium, and strontium) resulting in an increase in pH, making the surrounding environment unsuitable for bacterial growth. The further addition of copper in cosubstituted materials (Sr/Cu-DIO) significantly increased the antibacterial activity of Sr-DIO, which is somewhat expected as copper is known to produce reactive oxygen species that disrupt the membrane structure of E. coli, resulting in an antibacterial effect [60].\nBiocompatibility and antibacterial activity are two conflicting aspects of bioactive ceramics and balancing these is a complex challenge in tissue engineering. Here, the Sr/Cu-DIO square strut scaffold we have prepared exhibits improved mechanical properties over the unmodified DIO scaffold and a good balance between biocompatibility and antibacterial properties. Based on these results, it can be seen that the Sr/Cu-DIO system offers promising scope towards tailoring modes of bioactivity in bone tissue engineering scaffolds and the ability to produce this material in the form of architected scaffolds offers further scope for the engineering of high-performance implants."

The results show that strontium and copper were readily incorporated in the diopside lattice, producing a decreased grain size and a more densified microstructure. Intrinsic mechanical properties of Vickers hardness and fracture toughness were improved in these materials\nby this substitution, exceeding the values of cancellous bone. Scaffolds produced with square cross-sectional strut profiles combine high porosity (68 - 71%), and compressive strengths, as the result of reduced stress concentration. Materials exhibited good apatite-forming ability, with cation substitution enhancing adhesion and proliferation of Saos-2 cells as well as antibacterial activity against E. coli. This study demonstrates how co-substitution and structural design can be implemented to customize and enhance the performance of bioactive diopside bone-tissue engineering scaffolds achieving unprecedented combinations of mechanical and multi-mode bioactive performance. The selection of strontium and copper has been validated here as an effective approach, and further cosubstitutions, where multiple cations substitute at each of the two octahedral diopside sites may offer yet further avenues for materials design to explore in this system.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest."
