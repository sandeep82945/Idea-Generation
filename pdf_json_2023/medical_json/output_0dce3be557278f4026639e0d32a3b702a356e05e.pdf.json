Twenty mid-lactation Jersey cows were used in the study. Of these 20 cows, 12 were used for ruminal sampling, 16 for enteric CH4 measurements, and all for spot urine collection.

Ruminal fluid samples obtained via stomach tubing were used for DNA extraction. Enteric CH4 production was measured using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Diets had no effect on ruminal microbiota diversity. Similarly, the relative abundance of ruminal archaea genera was not affected by diets. In contrast, GFX decreased or increased linearly the relative abundance of Firmicutes (P < 0.01) and Bacteroidetes (P < 0.01), respectively. The relative abundance of the ruminal bacteria Ruminococcus (P < 0.01) and Clostridium (P < 0.01) decreased linearly, and that of Prevotella (P < 0.01) and Pseudobutyrivibrio (P < 0.01) increased linearly with feeding GFX. A tendency for a linear reduction (P = 0.055) in enteric CH4 production (from 304 to 256 g/d) was observed in cows fed increasing amounts of GFX. However, neither CH4 yield nor CH4 intensity was affected by treatments. Diets had no effect on the urinary excretion of uric acid, allantoin, and total PD. Overall, feeding GFX decreased linearly the relative abundance of the ruminal bacterial genera Ruminococcus and Clostridium and enteric CH4 production, but no change was seen for CH4 yield and CH4 intensity, or urinary excretion of total PD, suggesting no detrimental effect of GFX on microbial protein synthesis in the rumen.",

            "text": "We reported in our companion paper (Resende et al., 2015) that the milk proportions of total n-3 fatty acids and \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) increased linearly in dairy cows fed diets containing incremental amounts (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%; dry matter [DM] basis) of ground flaxseed (GFX; Linum usitatissimum). It is also important to note that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in oilseeds such as GFX are toxic to ruminal methanogens and protozoa (Patra, 2013), which can decrease enteric methane (CH4) production in lactating dairy cows. Martin et al. (2016) observed linear reductions in CH4 production, CH4 yield, and CH4 intensity in dairy cows fed hay- or corn silage-based diets supplemented with increasing levels of extruded flaxseed (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%; DM basis). However, there is limited research investigating the effects of GFX on ruminal microbiota diversity and taxa and enteric CH4 emissions in lactating dairy cows fed high-forage diets. Schroeder et al. (2014) showed that the in situ DM degradability of GFX, rolled flaxseed, and whole flaxseed averaged 11.3%, 4.5%, and 0.57% per hour,\nrespectively. These results suggest that the processing method used and form of flaxseed fed likely have different effects on ruminal fermentation processes including methanogenesis, thus requiring further research with GFX.\nHuang et al. (2021) observed that dairy cows fed GFX (6.38%; DM basis) had the lowest and greatest relative abundance of ruminal bacterial belonging to the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, respectively, compared with the control and whole flaxseed diets. They further reported that feeding GFX decreased the ruminal molar proportion of acetate, and increased that of propionate and butyrate, thus in line with shifts detected for Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Deusch et al. (2017) demonstrated that Firmicutes species are primarily responsible for enzymes involved in butyrate and formic acid production, while Bacteroidetes are mostly associated with enzymes related to propionate and acetate synthesis in the rumen. Therefore, changes in ruminal microbiota and fermentation profile in cows fed GFX (Deusch et al.; 2017; Huang et al., 2021) suggest that methanogenesis may be also affected. For instance, CH4 production decreased\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.

In our companion paper (Resende et al., 2015), whereas DM intake (DMI) decreased linearly in cows fed GFX, the ruminal molar proportion of propionate increased linearly, with these responses commonly associated with a reduction in enteric CH4 production. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, 2021), 27% of all CH4 emissions in the country originate primarily from cattle enteric fermentation, and are behind only to natural gas and petroleum systems\u00a0 that together contribute 30% of the total. In addition to being a potent greenhouse gas, up to 10% of the dietary gross energy intake can be lost through enteric CH4 production in lactating dairy cows (Niu et al., 2018). Therefore, strategies to mitigate ruminal methanogenesis, particularly in high-forage diets, are needed to reduce the environmental impact of dairy systems while improving energy use efficiency in lactating dairy cows.\nWe hypothesized that enteric CH4 production would be reduced linearly in response to incremental amounts of GFX due to the toxic effects of GFX-PUFA on the growth of methanogens and cellulolytic bacteria. This will be inferred by changes in the relative abundance of ruminal microbiota taxa and the urinary excretion of purine derivatives (PD), which is commonly used as a proxy for microbial growth in the rumen that can be negatively affected by PUFA supply from GFX. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of increasing levels of GFX on diversity and relative abundance of ruminal microbiota taxa, enteric CH4 emissions, and urinary excretion of PD in lactating dairy cows."

Samples were then filtered through 4\u00a0 layers of cheesecloth into volumetric flasks to a final volume of 250 mL and preserved on dry ice until transported to the laboratory. Next, aliquots of 0.6 mL of ruminal fluid from each day were pooled per cow into 2-mL cryovials (1.8 mL total) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until shipped in dry ice to MR DNA Laboratory (Shallowater, TX) for DNA extraction and MiSeq sequencing as reported in detail by Silva et al. (2022). In brief, microbial DNA (prokaryotes) was extracted from ruminal fluid samples using the PowerSoil DNA isolation method (kit #12888\u2013100; MO BIO Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and quantified via spectrophotometry (2000 UV-VIS, NanoDrop spectrophotometer; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA). Amplification of the V4 variable region of 16S rRNA genes was carried out with the primer pairs 515F (5\u02b9- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (5\u02b9-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT) as reported previously (Caporaso et al., 2012). The HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix DNA polymerase kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used for PCR amplifications following conditions and elongation steps shown in Silva et al. (2022). Purified PCR products were utilized to prepare a sequencing library following the Illumina TruSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) protocol, with sequencing analysis performed on a MiSeq (Illumina Inc.) following the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines.\nThe 250-bp paired-end raw Illumina reads from ruminal fluid microbiota were initially evaluated using FastQC (v.0.11.4; Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK). Next, reads were processed to remove Illumina adapters and trimmed to remove low-quality reads (Phred \u226430) using Trimmomatic v.0.33 (Bolger et al., 2014), with high-quality paired-end reads merged using the PEAR software (Zhang et al., 2014). All postprocessed reads were submitted to the QIIME2 package for microbiota genetic quantitative analysis (Bolyen et al., 2019). Amplicon errors from the high-quality reads were initially corrected using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016) followed by the QIIME2 \u201cdemux\u201d function to remove chimeras and duplicated sequences, and to demultiplex the reads based on representative sequences. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were defined by clustering at 3% divergence (97% similarity). Final OTU were taxonomically classified using BLASTn against a curated database (DeSantis et al., 2006). Bacterial and archaeal genera were considered for statistical analysis when relative abundance was greater than 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively. Diversity of ruminal microbiota (prokaryotes) in response to diets was evaluated using the \u03b1-diversity indices OTU, Shannon, and Faith. The \u03b2-diversity principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed using the Bray\u2013Curtis method for unweighted (qualitative) UniFrac distances for each treatment as detailed in Silva et al.

Permeation tubes were weighed for 6 wk to determine SF6 permeation rate, which averaged 1.47 \u00b1 0.12 mg/d. Polyvinyl chloride canisters (10.2 cm diameter, 17.8 cm length, and 1 L volume) fitted with caps attached to ball shutoff valves connected to the sampling apparatus were fixed to the back of the cows using back-mounted harnesses. Canisters were removed twice daily before each milking (0600 h and 1500 h) and replaced (~1 h after milking) with new flushed and evacuated canisters. Two canisters were placed near the feed bunk and bedding area to account for background gas concentrations in the calculations of gaseous emissions. Gaseous samples were collected via syringes, with gases injected into pre-evacuated 10-mL vials with septa and stored until analysis using a Shimadzu GC-8A (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detection and electron capture detection for CH4 and SF6, respectively. A data filter with CH4 production ranging from 79 to 729 g/d based on individual cow data (Niu et al., 2018) was applied to our data set to discard extreme and impossible (i.e., negative emissions) CH4 values. Calculations of enteric CH4 production were done as described by Johnson et al. (1994)."

After collection, 8 mL of urine was acidified with 400 \u00b5L of 6 N HCl per time point and pooled over 5 d to generate 1 sample per cow for each period. Urinary samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in 50-mL centrifuge tubes until analyzed for total N, creatinine, allantoin, and uric acid. Concentration of total N in urine was assessed by micro-Kjeldahl analysis (Dairy One Forage Testing Laboratory, Ithaca, NY). Creatinine concentration was measured colorimetrically using a commercially available kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) with a chromate microplate reader set at a wavelength of 492 nm (Awareness Technology Inc., Westport,\nCT). Allantoin concentration was determined as reported by Chen et al. (1992), and that of uric acid using the Stanbio Uric Acid LiquiColor kit (procedure #1045; Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX). Urinary allantoin and uric acid concentrations were read at wavelengths of 522 and 520 nm, respectively, on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA). Urinary volume was estimated based on the concentration of creatinine assuming a constant creatinine excretion rate of 0.212 mmol/kg of BW (Chizzotti et al., 2008). Urinary excretion of total N, allantoin, uric acid, and total PD (allantoin + uric acid) was calculated by multiplying the concentration of each of these metabolites by the urinary volume."

These results suggest that diets did not affect the overall composition of ruminal microbiota because community grouping by clusters was not evident. In contrast, Huang et al. (2021) observed a clear separation between diets in the PCoA1 axis, with most control and GFX cows distributed in the negative and positive score values, respectively. However, they were not able to separate control and GFX groups based on values of the PCoA2 axis. Discrepancy in PCoA when comparing Huang et al. (2021) and our study is not straightforward to explain but it may be related to the difference in the forage sources used in the basal diets (corn silage and alfalfa hay vs. mixed-mostly grass baleage and hay) and animal breed (Holstein vs. Jersey). Islam et al. (2021) reported, based on PCoA, the formation of 2 distinct cluster groups suggesting that the overall composition of the ruminal microbiota was different between Holstein and Jersey steers fed the same TMR.\nThe relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased linearly (P < 0.01), whereas that of Bacteroidetes increased linearly (P < 0.01) with feeding incremental amounts of GFX (Figure 2). A cubic effect (P < 0.01) was observed for the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (Figure 2). However, cubic response is difficult to explain biologically. In contrast, diets did not affect the relative abundance of SR1, Tenericutes, Spirochaetes, and Verrucomicrobia (Figure 2). Previous research showed that PUFA, particularly ALA is toxic to ruminal cellulolytic bacteria (Maia et al., 2007), suggesting that the linear reduction in Firmicutes observed herein may have been associated with ALA toxicity to fibrolytic bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcus) belonging to this phylum. The linear increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in cows fed GFX is in line with that found for Prevotella (Figure 3), as the Prevotella genus belongs to the\nBacteroidetes phylum. It is important to note that Prevotella has been implicated in biohydrogenation of PUFA (Huws et al., 2011) and metabolism of flaxseed lignans (Schogor et al., 2014; Brito and Zang, 2019) as discussed in detail below.\nWe observed linear reductions (P < 0.01) in the relative abundance of the ruminal bacteria genera Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Clostridiaceae_02d06_group, Oscillospira, Anaerostipes, and Blautia, as well as a quadratic decrease (P < 0.01) in that of the Paraprevotellaceae_CF231_group in cows fed incremental amounts of GFX (Figure 3).

It is well documented that bacterial species belonging to the Ruminococcus genus are primarily cellulolytic (Sijpesteijn, 1951; Terry et al., 2019), with the Clostridium and Blautia genera also involved in fiber degradation in the rumen (Terry et al., 2019). We observed in our companion paper a linear decrease in the ruminal molar proportion of acetate and linear reduction tendencies for the apparent total-tract digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber with feeding GFX (Resende et al., 2015), thus in line with the decreased relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Blautia. Yang et al. (2009) demonstrated that compared with cows fed the control diet, those supplemented with soybean oil or flaxseed oil, both at 4% of the diet DM, had decreased counts (cfu/mL) of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa, and reduced amount (ng) of DNA copies of Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefasciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Maia et al. (2007) showed that ALA was toxic to ruminal cellulolytic bacteria, which may be associated with the linear reduction in the relative abundance of fibrolytic bacteria in cows offered GFX as discussed above.\nIncreased relative abundance of ruminal Anaerovibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Selenomonas with feeding increasing dietary levels of GFX (Figure 3) is possibly associated with lipolytic or biohydrogenation activities of bacteria belonging to these 3 genera (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2010; Huws et al., 2015). In fact, Huws et al. (2015) showed that the relative abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio was greater\nFigure 2.

Resende et al. (2015) reported that the milk proportions of total trans-18:1 FA and total CLA increased linearly in response to GFX, indicating that enhanced supply of ALA led to the accumulation of ruminal biohydrogenation intermediates in milk fat.\nWe also observed that the relative abundance of ruminal Prevotella increased linearly in cows fed diets supplemented with incremental amounts of GFX (Figure 3). The Prevotella genus is composed of bacterial species that utilize a variety of nutrients such as protein, starch, pectin, and hemicellulose (Russell, 2002). In our companion paper (Resende et al., 2015), we observed that the dietary concentration of starch decreased from 190 to 115 g/kg of DM and that of total FA increased from 24.9 to 48.1 g/kg of DM by replacing corn meal and soybean meal with GFX, suggesting that elevated supply of ALA may have been associated with the linear increase in the relative abundance of ruminal Prevotella. In support, Li et al. (2015) reported greater relative abundance of Prevotella in steers fed flaxseed oil than those in the control diet. Further, flaxseed is the richest source of lignans, which are primarily found in the outer fibrous layers of flaxseed (Brito and Zang, 2019). Previous in vitro work using pure cultures of ruminal bacteria revealed that Prevotella actively metabolized secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, the most abundant lignan in flaxseed (Schogor et al., 2014).\nThere was no effect of GFX on the relative abundance of the ruminal archaea genera (Figure 4). The most abundant ruminal archaea genus was Methanobrevibacter followed by Methanosphaera, Vadin_CA11_group, and Methanosarcina. Petri et al. (2018) reported no differences in the relative abundance of ruminal Methanobrevibacter in crossbred steers fed an extruded flaxseed-based supplement. They also observed that Methanobrevibacter was\nFigure 3.

Supplementation with PUFA has been associated with inhibitory effects on the metabolic activity and numbers of ruminal methanogens (Patra, 2013), which can ultimately affect their relative abundance in the rumen.

            "text": "Enteric CH4 production tended to decrease linearly (P = 0.055) with feeding incremental amounts of GFX (Table 1). However, diets did not affect CH4 yield and CH4 intensity. Resende et al. (2015) reported that DMI decreased linearly in cows fed increasing dietary levels of GFX, thus in line with the current response in CH4 production. It is well established the positive linear relationship between DMI and enteric CH4 production in lactating dairy cows (Niu et al., 2018). Resende et al. (2015) observed that the ruminal molar proportion of propionate increased linearly, further supporting the reduction in CH4 production documented herein as the chemical reactions leading to propionate production in the rumen use metabolic hydrogen, thus limiting substrates for methanogenesis (Henderson, 1980). Soder et al. (2012) showed linear reductions in both CH4 production and molar proportion of propionate in continuous culture fermentors dosed with varying levels (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of the diet DM) of GFX thereby in agreement with the present results .\nWe observed a 16% reduction (P = 0.055) in enteric CH4 production comparing the control diet (0% GFX) with that containing 15% GFX. However, this reduction in enteric CH4 production was accompanied by linear decreases in DMI and yields of milk, milk fat, and milk true protein (Resende et al., 2015). Although our results indicate that GFX has moderate enteric CH4 mitigation potential (Beauchemin et al., 2020), its negative effects on milk yield and composition are concerning and may limit its use on commercial dairy farms, particularly because producers in the United States do not receive premiums for shipping milk with high concentration of n-3 fatty acids.\nUrinary Purine Derivatives Excretion Urinary excretion of uric acid, allantoin, and total PD was not affected by diets (Table 2), suggesting that GFX had no impact on microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. Isenberg et al. (2019) reported no differences in the urinary excretion of uric acid, allantoin, and total PD in grazing Jersey cows supplemented (10% of the diet DM) or not with GFX.\nFurthermore, research done by Soder et al. (2012) in continuous culture fermentors dosed with increasing levels of GFX revealed no change in microbial protein synthesis measured using total purines as the bacterial marker. Even though the urinary excretion of total PD was similar across diets (Table 2), the apparent total-tract digestibilities of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber all tended to decrease linearly in response to increasing dietary levels of GFX (Resende et al., 2015), thus implying that PUFA released in the rumen possibly affected the growth of fibrolytic microorganisms as discussed earlier. Soder et al. (2012) also reported linear decreases in nutrient digestibility (organic matter and neutral detergent fiber) without a change in the flow of microbial N in continuous culture fermentors dosed with GFX. Collectively , it can be inferred from these results that the lack of GFX effect on microbial protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro may be associated with the growth of certain ruminal microbiota populations compensating for the reduction of other groups resulting in no net gain in microbial mass in the rumen.\nIn summary, our hypothesis that enteric CH4 production would be reduced linearly in response to incremental amounts of GFX due to the toxic effect of GFX-PUFA on growth of methanogens and cellulolytic bacteria was partially confirmed. Enteric CH4 production tended to decrease linearly with feeding GFX, but no change was observed in the relative abundance of ruminal archaea genera even though the function of methanogens was not assessed herein. However, linear decreases in the relative abundance of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria genera such as Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Blautia may have contributed to the tendency seen for the linear decrease in enteric CH4 production in dairy cows fed increasing dietary levels of GFX. Despite a 16% reduction in enteric CH4 production with feeding the greatest amount of GFX (i.e., 15% inclusion in the diet DM), yields of milk, milk fat, and milk true protein also decreased by 6.1%, 5.1%, and 9.6%, respectively, as reported in our companion paper (Resende et al., 2015). Therefore, it can be concluded that the tradeoff between the beneficial effect of GFX on mitigating enteric CH4 production and its negative effect on yields of milk fat and protein limits the use of GFX in dairy production systems in which producers are paid based on the amount of fat and protein they shipped out of the farm and not on n-3 fatty acid profile or carbon credits ."
