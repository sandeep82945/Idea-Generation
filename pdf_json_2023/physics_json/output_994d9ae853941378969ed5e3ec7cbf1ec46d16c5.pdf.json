Two distinct rhombohedral (R3) polymorphs and one cubic (I213) polymorph were identified with increasing pH, corresponding to the T6, T3R3 f and T2 conformations of insulin, respectively. The structure of the cubic T2 polymorph was determined via multi-profile stereochemically restrained Rietveld refinement at 2.7 A\u030a resolution. This constitutes the first cubic insulin structure to be determined from crystals grown in the presence of zinc ions, although no zinc binding was observed. The differences of the polycrystalline variant from other cubic insulin structures, as well as the nature of the pH-driven phase transitions, are discussed in detail.\n1. Introduction\nThe story of the structural characterization of insulin has been tightly coupled with the development of macromolecular crystallography since the late 1920s (Vijayan, 2002). After a century of crystallographic research, insulin has proven to be one of the most polymorphic proteins, exhibiting a variety of molecular conformations, crystal forms and metal- and ligandbinding abilities.\nAt its core, insulin is a small protein comprising 51 amino acids in two polypeptide chains: A and B. Depending on the physicochemical environment, the N-terminal region of chain B can be found in a helical (R), intermediate (Rf) or extended (T) conformation, although only the extended conformation is observed for monomeric insulin in solution. The helical and intermediate conformations, which exhibit higher physicochemical stability (Rahuel-Clermont et al., 1997), are only observed in hexameric assemblies of insulin coordinated by divalent cations, physiologically zinc. The resulting hexamers can adopt one of the following combinations of conformations: T6, T3R f 3 or R6 (Kaarsholm et al., 1989). Although the T6 conformation is predominantly observed in solution, the T3R f 3 state can be stabilized in the presence of halides, pseudohalides or organic carboxylates, while the further addition of phenol derivatives can stabilize the R6 conformation (Dunn, 2005; Whittingham et al., 1995).\nTwo highly similar crystal forms or polymorphs of rhombohedral insulin have been observed to date for the T6\nISSN 2059-7983\nPublished under a CC BY 4.0 licence\n(Adams et al., 1969) and T3R f 3 (Bentley et al., 1976) molecular conformations, respectively, while insulin hexamers complexed with phenolic ligands in the R6 conformation have been observed in a variety of crystal polymorphs, as briefly summarized by Spiliopoulou, Valmas et al. (2020). In the absence of zinc cations and in the millimolar concentration range insulin monomers cannot form hexamers and instead crystallize as dimers, predominately with cubic symmetry. This cubic polymorph was first identified by Abel et al. (1927), while the zinc-free nature of these crystals was only recognized after 31 years (Schlichtkrull, 1958) and the first porcine cubic insulin structure was solved a further 20 years later (Dodson et al., 1978).\nOwing to its high solvent content [ 65%(v/v)], the cubic polymorph has served as an ideal system to explore pHdependent conformational changes (Gursky, Badger et al., 1992), monovalent metal-binding sites (Gursky, Li et al., 1992) and the protonation states of several structurally crucial amino acids (Diao, 2003; Ishikawa, Chatake, Morimoto et al., 2008; Ishikawa, Chatake, Ohnishi et al., 2008). More recently, the cubic polymorph of the human insulin (HI) variant was reported as a byproduct of co-crystallization efforts with polysialic acid (Timofeev et al., 2010), while multiple mutants and engineered constructs in a cubic setting are now available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\nOur interest in the cubic insulin polymorph was a result of our crystallization studies of HI\u2013ligand complexes in the\nsearch for stable and densely packed polymorphs that could serve as more potent microcrystalline antidiabetic formulations (Spiliopoulou, Valmas et al., 2020; Karavassili et al., 2017). Using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), we exploit the observation of novel crystalline polymorphs of insulin as a first strong indication of ligand binding. Thus, in our efforts to ascertain which polymorphs are suggestive of ligand binding, we pursued the crystallization of HI via our established protocol but in the absence of any ligands. During these experiments we observed the cubic HI polymorph and, motivated by the impressive quality of the collected XRPD data and the lack of a wild-type human cubic insulin structure in the PDB at the time, we set forth to determine its structure to explore the potential differences between cubic insulins from different species."

            "text": "2.3.1. Sample preparation. Prior to XRPD data collection, the polycrystalline protein slurries were transferred to borosilicate glass capillaries of 1 mm diameter and 0.1 mm thickness. Each capillary was first filled with mother liquor, i.e. the supernatant crystallization solution, and an amount of polycrystalline slurry was then transferred using a pipette or a syringe. The capillaries were then centrifuged to enhance crystal packing and topped up with more slurry if needed. A sample volume with a height of 1 cm is required per capillary, but preferably much more, depending on sample availability. Excess mother liquor was removed with a syringe and the capillaries were cut and sealed with silicone vacuum grease to prevent dehydration. Each sample was mounted onto the goniometer head of the diffractometer and rotated during data collection to ensure better powder averaging.\n2.3.2. Data collection. High-resolution XRPD data were collected on the ID22 beamline (Fitch, 2004; Dejoie et al., 2018) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France in Debye\u2013Scherrer mode at room temperature employing a nine-channel LaBr3 scintillator detector equipped with nine Si(111) crystal analyzers, during two separate experiments [series 1, = 1.29974 (1) A\u030a; series 2, = 1.299995 (3) A\u030a]. Each capillary was measured at multiple adjacent positions along the capillary axis to minimize\nradiation-damage effects, collecting two successive scans per position. The detector was translated at 25 min 1 and each sample position was exposed to the beam for 2 min per scan. All first and second scans from all capillary positions were then merged separately. Only the merged first scans were used for further analysis since radiation damage was observed in subsequent scans. Each detector channel was also individually inspected for signs of radiation damage, such as peak shifts or loss of diffraction intensity, and was excluded from merging if necessary.\nAdditional XRPD data were collected on an in-house X\u2019Pert Pro diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical) in Debye\u2013 Scherrer geometry with Cu K radiation [ = 1.540585 (3) A\u030a; Ho\u0308lzer et al., 1997] at room temperature employing a PIXcel 1D detector. Each sample was repeatedly measured at a single capillary position for 24 scans per sample. The detector was translated at 1 min 1 and the sample was exposed for 30 min per scan. The individual scans were inspected for signs of radiation damage and were then averaged to enhance the data statistics. No noticeable radiation damage was observed even after 12 h of data collection, due to the significantly lower beam brilliance.\n2.3.3. Data processing. For each crystallization series, the XRPD patterns were grouped manually via surface plots or semi-automatically via principal component analysis using HighScore Plus (Degen et al., 2014). Representative patterns from each cluster were then indexed using DICVOL04 (Boultif & Loue\u0308r, 2004).\nPawley refinement (Pawley, 1981) was performed for each data set in HighScore Plus to extract peak intensities and accurately characterize the lattice dimensions and peak shape parameters. The peak profile was modeled using a pseudoVoigt function (Thompson et al., 1987) with full-width at halfmaximum (FWHM) and asymmetry type following the Caglioti\u2013Paoletti\u2013Ricci (Caglioti et al., 1958) and Finger\u2013Cox\u2013 Jephcoat (Finger et al., 1994) models, respectively."

            "text": "Six data sets were selected for structure refinement of the, at the time, unknown human variant of the cubic insulin polymorph.\n2.4.1. Data-set selection. Candidate data sets were initially subjected to multi-profile Pawley refinement in PRODD (Wright & Forsyth, 2000; Wright, 2004). In this process, intensities are extracted via a single refinement in which each diffraction profile is calculated as a sum of overlapping reflections, the intensities of which are variables in a leastsquares procedure. All data sets are fitted using the same integrated intensities for each pattern but with different unitcell parameters. This preliminary analysis verifies the isomorphism of the data sets employed for structure refinement by assessing the quality of the fit and the discrepancies in refinement statistics (for example Rwp, 2) across all data sets, while enabling the extraction of a more precise intensity set with higher effective completeness (Basso et al., 2005; Margiolaki et al., 2007; Margiolaki & Wright, 2008; Besnard et\n376 Dimitris P. Triandafillidis et al. T2 polycrystalline cubic human insulin Acta Cryst. (2023). D79, 374\u2013386\nal., 2007; Wright et al., 2007; Margiolaki, 2019). A single set of intensities is extracted via this process.\nFollowing preliminary analysis, a total of six data sets were selected for structure refinement: five synchrotron data sets and one laboratory data set (Supplementary Table S1). Reflections with a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio [I/ (I) > 2] could be observed up to a d-spacing resolution of 2.7 A\u030a.\n2.4.2. Rietveld refinement. In order to initiate structure refinement, we employed PDB entry 9ins (Gursky, Li et al., 1992), corresponding to porcine cubic insulin, as a starting model. The model was initially stripped of solvent molecules and alternative conformations. In addition, ThrB30 was substituted with an alanine, which is physiologically found in HI. Owing to the absence of any clear indications of structural heterogeneity upon pH variation, a six-histogram, stereochemically restrained Rietveld refinement (Rietveld, 1969) was performed using GSAS (Larson & Von Dreele, 2004) to extract an average structural model of the cubic human insulin polymorph (Margiolaki, 2019; Margiolaki & Wright, 2008; Spiliopoulou, Triandafillidis et al., 2020). This procedure has previously been applied to sperm whale metmyoglobin (Von Dreele, 1999), hen and turkey egg-white lysozyme (Von Dreele, 2001, 2005, 2007; Basso et al., 2005; Margiolaki et al., 2005), human and bovine insulin (Von et al., 2000; Margiolaki et al., 2013), human ponsin domain SH3.2 (Margiolaki et al., 2007) and a pharmaceutical peptide, octreotide (Spiliopoulou, Karavassili et al., 2021; Fili et al., 2019).\nA single set of unit-cell parameters was extracted from the first data set alone, while lattice differences with subsequent data sets were modeled via refinable hydroelastic strain terms of the reciprocal metric tensor elements (Larson & Von Dreele, 2004). The same peak profile used for Pawley refinement was also used for Rietveld refinement. Peak shape parameters, background coefficients, zero-shift, unit-cell and lattice-strain terms were first optimized in a multi-profile Le Bail refinement (Le Bail et al., 1988) in GSAS and then further refined during Rietveld refinement.\nThe solvent-content contribution to the diffracted intensities was accounted for using the exponential scaling model (Moews & Kretsinger, 1975; Weichenberger et al., 2015), which is a direct application of Babinet\u2019s principle to the calculated structure factors. Although more sophisticated masking methods are typically employed in macromolecular crystallography, this approach has proven to be accurate enough for the medium resolution of macromolecular XRPD data (Von Dreele, 1999, 2005; Margiolaki et al., 2005, 2013).\nIn order to reduce the number of refinable parameters and to increase the robustness of the refinement process, protein atoms were described using the flexible rigid-body (FRB) approach (Margiolaki et al., 2013; Von Dreele, 2019; Spiliopoulou, Karavassili et al., 2021; Fili et al., 2019). Here, each residue is considered as a rigid body with its origin fixed at the location of the C atom and its orientation described via a quaternion, thus requiring a total of only six refinable parameters. The side chain and backbone carbonyl of the residue are considered to be flexible components; thus, additional refinable torsion angles are introduced for these. Bond lengths\nand angles are kept fixed at typical values. This approach requires 66% fewer refinable parameters than a free-atom refinement. In addition, the isotropic temperature factors used for refinement were constrained across all protein and solvent atoms, respectively.\nAfter most non-atomic model parameters (for example histogram scale factors, solvent coefficients, profile parameters etc.) reached reasonable values, total OMIT maps (Bhat, 1988; Bhat & Cohen, 1984) were generated using SFCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999) to evaluate the fit of the structure to the electron density. OMIT maps are typically the preferred type of map for macromolecular powder diffraction, due to the inherent model bias in the observed structure factors extracted via the Rietveld method (Toby, 2019; Spiliopoulou, Triandafillidis et al., 2020). However, due to the low effective completeness of the multi-data-set refinement (Supplementary Fig. S1) resulting from the exactly overlapping peaks of the cubic crystal system, standard 2Fo Fc maps were also employed to aid the model-building process.\nUsing OMIT and 2Fo Fc maps, water molecules were gradually added to the structure in Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004; Emsley et al., 2010). The model was periodically subjected to stereochemical checks using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2018) to highlight incorrectly built regions of the structure. The final model reached a total Rwp = 6.94% and\n2 = 2.06 and was deposited in the PDB under accession code 7qac."

The unit-cell parameter a was determined to be 78.86015 (7) A\u030a. Overall, 18 158 reflections were extracted from the six XRPD patterns and 1951 restraints were imposed on the structural model. A total of 63 water molecules were identified in 2Fo Fc and OMIT maps and an overall reasonable model fit to the electron density was observed (Fig. 5c).

The asymmetric unit contains a single insulin molecule, which forms a dimer with a symmetry-related molecule. The I213 polymorph exhibits the largest observed solvent content [ 65%(v/v)] of all insulin polymorphs, followed by the hexameric C2221 polymorph (PDB entry 2om1; Norrman &\nActa Cryst. (2023).

Contacts between insulin dimers extend in all three directions along the twofold screw axes, forming solvent channels parallel to each crystallographic axis, but also parallel to the threefold diagonal axis.\nThe insulin dimers in the I213 unit cell are mostly stabilized via an antiparallel -sheet consisting of the two C-terminal regions of chain B of each monomer. This dimer interface involves residues AsnA21, GlyB8, SerB9, ValB12, TyrB16, GluB21 and GlyB23\u2013LysB29. The hydrogen-bonding network formed between these residues is highly conserved in all cubic insulin structures, as well as in the hexameric assemblies.

            "text": "Typically, in macromolecular powder diffraction multiple data sets are employed for structure refinement to exploit the variation in unit-cell parameters which results in anisotropic\npeak shifts and allows partial deconvolution of overlapping peaks. Such variation in unit-cell parameters can be a result of thermal variation (Brunelli et al., 2003; Shankland et al., 1997), controlled radiation damage (Besnard et al., 2007; Margiolaki et al., 2013) or variation in crystallization conditions (for example pH; Basso et al., 2005, 2010; Margiolaki et al., 2007), as was the case in the present study. However, the cubic crystal system exhibits exact peak overlap, and therefore any lattice variation results in an isotropic peak shift without any deconvolution of overlapping peaks. This makes it a remarkably challenging case for structure refinement, especially for such a complex molecule.\nIn this study, we performed combined synchrotron and laboratory refinement of a protein structure. Due to the lower photon flux of laboratory instruments samples can be irradiated for more than 24 h, resulting in excellent counting statistics even in the highest resolution shells. On the other hand, the unparalleled angular resolution of synchrotron diffractometers is crucial for deconvolution of the heavily overlapping peaks in protein samples, especially in the early stages of indexing and structure solution. In the absence of a single instrument with excellent angular resolution, which mitigates radiation-related sample degradation, this\n380 Dimitris P. Triandafillidis et al.

In contrast to our initial concerns, the refinement process proved to be robust and relatively rapid, overcoming the expected difficulties of powder crystallography in such high symmetries."

            "heading": "4.1. pH-driven conformational transitions",
            "text": "A variety of solution studies have demonstrated that insulin hexamers exist in an equilibrium between the T6, T3R f 3 and R6 states (Renscheidt et al., 1984; Wollmer et al., 1987; Thomas & Wollmer, 1989; Roy et al., 1989; Brader et al., 1991; Gross & Dunn, 1992; Choi et al., 1993). Although T6 is the predominant state, the equilibrium can be shifted towards the T3R f 3 state by the addition of anions and towards the R6 state by the addition of phenol derivatives. In this study, we have observed two phase transitions that are entirely pH-driven.\nAlthough the crystallization solution contains thiocyanate ion, a strongly chaotropic anion that is capable of stabilizing the B1\u2013B8 helix in the R state (Whittingham et al., 1995), the T6 conformation of insulin is observed at pH < 6.77, while a further increase in the pH seems to favor the T3R f 3 state. More interestingly, at pH > 7.35 zinc-free cubic crystals of dimers are observed. Importantly, in contrast to all other cubic insulin structures available in the literature, in this study the cubic crystals were grown in the presence of zinc.\nAs the pH increases from 5.5 to 8.5, insulin acquires a progressively more negative overall charge (pI 5.3) and thus increasingly stronger electrostatic repulsions develop between the insulin molecules. The effective charge of insulin is considerably affected by the ionic strength of the solution, as well as the oligomerization state, which alters the microenvironment of certain residues. We hypothesize that at the 2.1 Zn2+:insulin hexamer ratio used in this study the overall repulsions between insulin dimers at higher pH overcome the attractive forces of the zinc ions that coordinate with three HisB10 to form hexamers, thus favoring the formation of dimeric cubic crystals. We speculate that an increase in the zinc content would shift the equilibrium towards the hexameric state, and thus that the R3T3R3 polymorph would be the predominant form even at pH > 7.35, but further experiments are required to test this hypothesis. By a similar\nActa Cryst. (2023). D79, 374\u2013386 Dimitris P. Triandafillidis et al. T2 polycrystalline cubic human insulin 381\nargument, an increase in thiocyanate content would be expected to induce the R3T6! R3T3R3 transition at lower pH (Fig. 6).\nA potential pH-sensitive candidate residue driving these phase transitions is GluB13. In the hexameric assembly, six GluB13 residues are closely located to each other at the center of the hexamer. Given a pKa of 4.3, the six glutamate residues are likely to be mostly deprotonated and negatively charged at physiological pH; thus, the strongly attractive interaction between zinc ions and three HisB10 residues is necessary for the formation of hexamers. It has previously been shown that the binding of calcium ions in the central hexamer cavity counteracts most of the repulsive GluB13 interactions and further stabilizes the hexameric Zn-insulin assembly (Storm & Dunn, 1985).\nAt pH 6.0 the six GluB13 residues form a well defined hydrogen-bond network in the T6 state (PDB entry 1mso; Smith et al., 2003), while in the T3R f 3 and R6 states the GluB13 side chains are less well ordered and are typically found in multiple conformations, suggesting a role contributing to the T ! R transition (Fig. 7b). In fact, mutation of GluB13 to Gln yields T3R f 3 hexamers at pH 7.0 even in the absence of zinc or other helix-stabilizing anions, further supporting this hypothesis (Bentley et al., 1992).\nProgressively increasing electrostatic repulsions between GluB13 with increasing pH have also been observed crystallographically in titration studies of cubic insulin crystals (Diao, 2003). At pH < 5.8 the two symmetry-related GluB13 residues in the insulin dimer are hydrogen-bonded (proximal conformation, 2.8 A\u030a distance; PDB entry 1b17). At pH 6.0\u20136.98 a\n382 Dimitris P.

D79, 374\u2013386\nsecond, distant conformation is observed with a progressively increasing occupancy, while at pH 9.0 only the second conformation is present, in which the two GluB13 side-chain carboxylates are located 7.2 A\u030a apart (distant conformation; PDB entry 1b2g; Fig. 7a). Neutron diffraction studies on the cubic polymorph have confirmed that GluB13 is deprotonated at pD 9.0 (pH \u2019 8.6; PDB entry 2zpp; Ishikawa, Chatake, Morimoto et al., 2008). In this study (final pH 7.70\u20138.70) the two GluB13 residues in the cubic polymorph are found in the distant conformation (Fig. 7d), which is consistent with the repulsion hypothesis.\nTaken together, the previous work discussed above and the data from this study suggest that pH-dependent deprotonations are the driving force of the hexamer-to-dimer oligomerization transition and the related shift in crystal form (from rhombohedral to cubic) at pH 7.35."

            "text": "Although found in an extended conformation, the Nterminal region of chain B of the cubic polymorph does not adopt the same conformation as in the hexameric T state. While the T conformation is mostly preserved up to HisB5, a sharp double bend is observed at GlnB4 and AsnB3 which tethers PheB1 closer to the insulin core, residing in a hydrophobic cavity comprised of LeuA16, ValB2, AlaB14, LeuB17 and ValB18. In particular, the distance between PheB1 C\"1 and AlaB14 C contracts from 11.2 A\u030a in the hexagonal T6 state (PDB entry 1mso) to only 4.5 A\u030a in the cubic polymorph (PDB entry 3i40).\nIn the case of the polycrystalline cubic insulin structure reported here (PDB entry 7qac) only a single bend is observed at AsnB3, resulting in a semi-extended conformation of chain B (Table 3). Rather than retracting towards the -helix of chain B, PheB1 is instead anchored to a hydrophobic interface formed by two symmetry-related PheB1 residues along the crystallographic threefold symmetry axis and a symmetryrelated GlnB4. This results in a 7 A\u030a translocation of PheB1 C with respect to the single-crystal cubic structure (PDB entry 3i40). Although the N-terminal fold of chain B is quite conserved among various cubic insulin structures, human or otherwise, this alternate conformation of the polycrystalline structure could be a result of the translocation of the II helix of chain A, which transposes LeuA16 about 2 A\u030a further back, leading to an increase in the size of the hydrophobic cavity and potentially allowing ValB2 and PheB1 to untether from it (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nApart from the distinct T, Rf and R states, the N-terminal region of chain B is capable of folding into a variety of extended, T-like states. Following the previously established nomenclature, the N-terminus can adopt an open, i.e. O, state, in which residues B1\u2013B4 are detached from the rest of the molecule (PDB entry 1b9e; Yao et al., 1999), or an intermediate, i.e. I, state, in which residues B1 and B2 are positioned further away from the molecule than in the O state [PDB entries 2ws0 (Jira\u0301c\u030cek et al., 2010) and 4cy7 (Kosinova\u0301 et al., 2014)]. The fold observed in the cubic structures has previously been referred to as a compact intermediate state, i.e. the Ic state (Kosinova\u0301 et al., 2014). The polycrystalline cubic structure determined here retains the AsnB3 bend of the\nActa Cryst. (2023). D79, 374\u2013386 Dimitris P. Triandafillidis et al. T2 polycrystalline cubic human insulin 383\nIc fold; however, since residues B1\u2013B2 extend away rather than towards the hydrophobic AlaB14 core, we describe it as a compact open state (i.e. the Oc state). In all these T-like states HisB5 acts as a hinge between the highly flexible B1\u2013B4 residues and the rigid B6\u2013B8 residues (Fig. 8a).\nIt is therefore evident that although only the T state is observed in solution for the insulin monomer, a wide range of T-like states can be stabilized in a crystal setting (as dimers or hexamers). Our molecular-dynamics simulations on these crystalline structures revealed significant variation in their flexibility. Specifically, the N-terminal region of chain B is highly rigid in the polycrystalline cubic structure compared with the more mobile Ic state of other cubic insulin structures. The detached B1\u2013B4 conformation of the T and O states results in higher flexibility of the N-terminus. While the Ic, O and T states exhibit a mostly invariant mobility after CysB7, the polycrystalline Oc state is again more rigid. No significant variation was observed in the flexibility of chain A. Monitoring the LeuB15\u2013PheB24, ValB12\u2013TyrB26 and GlyB8\u2013 ProB28 C -atom distances throughout the simulation (Papaioannou et al., 2015) provided further evidence that the C-terminus of chain B retains the inactive closed conformation (Supplementary Table S4), which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with the -helix of chain B. An open conformation of the C-terminus is required for insulin to bind to its receptor (Lawrence, 2021)."

With increasing pH HI forms T6 and T3R f 3 hexamers, while at pH > 7.35 only T2 dimers were observed in a cubic crystal symmetry.\nThe angular and d-spacing resolution of the collected XRPD data motivated us to refine the structure of the cubic polymorph by employing a multi-profile and stereochemically restrained Rietveld refinement. The flexible rigid-body description of amino acids in GSAS proved to be essential for a robust refinement at 2.7 A\u030a resolution, while we employed synchrotron and laboratory diffraction data in a combined refinement to benefit from the strengths of each instrumentation setup. Despite our concerns due to the high symmetry of the crystals, refinement proved to be feasible.\nThe polycrystalline cubic insulin structure exhibits some notable differences from other single-crystal structures of the same polymorph, especially in the conformation of the N-terminal region of chain B. We hypothesize that a translocation in LeuA16 increases the size of the hydrophobic cavity which typically houses PheB1, allowing it to adopt a new conformation, termed the Oc state. Our molecular-dynamics simulations suggested that this Oc state is less flexible than the typical Ic state of the cubic polymorph and other T-like states, implying that this is a more rigid conformation of human insulin.\nThe observed phase transitions are entirely pH-driven. Strikingly, we observed a transition to a zinc-free cubic insulin\nstate despite the presence of zinc in solution. We argue that these transitions are a result of the increase in electrostatic repulsion between neighboring GluB13 residues as a result of pH variation. Further investigations of these pH-driven phase transitions, in terms of varying zinc-to-insulin and thiocyanateto-insulin ratios, are required to test our hypotheses, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments to yield higher resolution structural models."
