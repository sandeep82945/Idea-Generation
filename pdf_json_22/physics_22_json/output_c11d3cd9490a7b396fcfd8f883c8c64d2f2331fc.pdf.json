We do this by applying Dixon\u2019s formalism at quadrupolar order to a nearly spherical body whose shape oscillates between a prolate and an oblate spheroid. The late-time chaotic behavior is then verified by applying Melnikov\u2019s method.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA realistic description of the dynamics of extended bodies is fundamental to the understanding of several physical phenomena. For instance, in Newtonian gravity, an extended body controlling its internal structure can actively modify its orbit [1\u20134], as well as stabilize it [5]. The qualitative long-term behavior of a system can also be deeply affected as finite-size corrections are taken into account. It was recently shown that this may even trigger the onset of chaos in an otherwise integrable dynamics of a test particle [6]. It is to be expected that this fact is all the more pronounced in relativistic physics, partly due to its intrinsic nonlinear nature.\nIn this paper, we explore how extended-body effects in general relativity may affect the late-time dynamics of a body by producing chaotic motion, even in situations where this would not be expected in Newtonian mechanics. We do this by applying Dixon\u2019s formalism [7\u2013 9] at the quadrupolar order to analyze the motion of a spinless extended body in the Schwarzschild background, wherein all the point-particle trajectories (its geodesics) are known and regular. Our key finding is that periodic perturbations to the internal structure of a spinless and nearly spherical body can generate chaos in an otherwise regular translational motion. Bodies of this kind may be seen as prototypes of spacecrafts or as toy models for astronomical objects, such as pulsating stars and artificial satellites with internal motion.\nThis work is organized as follows. Section II reviews some aspects of Dixon\u2019s formalism. Section III studies the dynamics of extended bodies up to quadrupolar order and prepares the ground for Sec. IV, wherein we apply Melnikov\u2019s method to show the onset of chaos on the motion of an extended body with small periodic deviations from spherical symmetry. We pay special attention to the case when the body is a nearly spherical ellipsoid whose\n\u2217 mosna@unicamp.br \u2020 fariafis@ifi.unicamp.br \u2021 ronaldo.vieira@ufabc.edu.br\nshape oscillates between a prolate and a oblate spheroid.

            "text": "Dixon\u2019s formalism is a covariant framework to deal with extended bodies on curved spacetimes. It was proposed by W. G. Dixon in a series of articles [7\u20139] in the seventies; a modern review can also be found at Ref. [10]. It provides both a conceptually satisfying and a powerful calculation tool to deal with the problem of extended bodies in general relativity by developing a set of covariant equations of motion for their linear momentum p\u00b5 and spin tensor S\n\u00b5\u03bd . This is done by means of a (very carefully chosen) multipolar expansion of the body\u2019s energy-momentum tensor.\nConsider an extended body described by the energymomentum tensor T\u03b1\u03b2 in a spacetime M with metric g\u03b1\u03b2 . We assume that this is a test body, i.e., that the backreaction of T\u03b1\u03b2 on the metric ofM is negligible. Its equations of motion are then given by\n\u2207\u03b2T\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. (1)\nIn Dixon\u2019s formalism, the energy-momentum tensor T\u03b1\u03b2 is expressed in terms of a set of multipole moments associated with it. The four partial differential equations in (1) are then shown to be equivalent to a set ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for these multipoles. Crucial to this method is a very careful choice of a spacetime foliation near the body by spacelike three-surfaces \u03a3s along its center-of-mass worldline, z\n\u00b5(s). The latter is implicitly defined by the condition\nS\u00b5\u03bd(s)p\u03bd(s) = 0, (2)\nwhere s is an evolution (timelike) parameter. Each \u03a3s is given by the three-surface that is orthogonal to p\u00b5(s) at z\u00b5(s) and is generated by all the spacelike geodesics emanating orthogonally to p\u00b5(s) from z\u00b5(s).\nWith these particular choices (for the center of mass and foliation) associated with the body, Eq. (1) determines ODEs for the evolution of the monopole (p\u00b5) and\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n04 34\n1v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n9 J\nul 2\n02 2\n2 dipole (S\u00b5\u03bd) moments, while leaving all the remaining (quadrupole, octupole, etc) moments arbitrary. The latter can be freely chosen as reflecting internal details of the body, such as its constitutive laws or inner mechanisms. This leads to a remarkable simplification of the problem.\nThe new equations of motion are then given by ten ODEs for the evolution of the momentum p\u00b5(s) and spin S\u00b5\u03bd(s) of the body:\nDp\u00b5\nds = \u22121 2 R\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2v \u03bdS\u03b1\u03b2 + F\u00b5, (3a)\nDS\u00b5\u03bd\nds = 2p[\u00b5v\u03bd] +N\u00b5\u03bd , (3b)\nwhere R\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the Riemann tensor of g\u03b1\u03b2 and v \u00b5 = dz\u00b5/ds is tangent to the center-of-mass worldline. The terms F\u00b5 and N\u00b5\u03bd can be seen as the force and torque with respect to the center of mass, respectively, that act on the body, and may be obtained from Eq. (1) in terms of the multipole expansion discussed above. Their expressions up to quadrupole order are given by\nF\u00b5 = \u22121 6 J\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u2207\u00b5R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4, (4a)\nN\u00b5\u03bd = 4\n3 J\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3[\u00b5R \u03bd] \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 , (4b)\nwhere J\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is the quadrupole moment of the body [7, 8]. This tensor conveys all the information about the internal structure of the body in Eqs. (4) and thus, as long as the usual energy conditions are satisfied, it may be prescribed at will [in the sense that any prescription is always consistent with Eq. (1)]. Moreover, the quadrupole tensor may be chosen so that it has the same algebraic properties as the Riemann tensor,\nJ\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = J [\u03b1\u03b2]\u03b3\u03b4 = J\u03b1\u03b2[\u03b3\u03b4], J [\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3]\u03b4 = 0. (5)\nSymmetries of the spacetime give rise to conserved quantities constructed from the monopole and dipole moments. More precisely, one can show that each Killing vector field \u03be on M gives rise to the quantity\nP\u03be = p\u00b5\u03be \u00b5 +\n1 2 S\u00b5\u03bd\u2207\u00b5\u03be\u03bd (6)\nthat is conserved by the time evolution generated by Eqs. (3). This conservation law holds exactly (i.e., regardless of the quadrupole approximation) and at every perturbation order [11].\nThe evolution parameter s is so far arbitrary. Let u\u00b5 be the unit vector in the direction of p\u00b5, so that p\u00b5 = mu\u00b5 with p\u00b5p \u00b5 = \u2212m2. The mass m may vary with time when the body is extended; also, u\u00b5 6= v\u00b5 in general. Usual choices for the evolution parameter s are the time \u03c4\u0303 as measured by an observer momentarily at rest with respect to p\u00b5, so that v\u00b5u\n\u00b5 = \u22121 [5], and the proper time \u03c4 along the center-of-mass trajectory [12], so that v\u00b5v \u00b5 = \u22121. From now on we choose to take s = \u03c4 .\nWe are concerned here with the motion of an extended body in a Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, with metric\nds2 = \u2212f(r)dt2 + f(r)\u22121dr2 + r2(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62), (7)\nwhere f(r) = 1 \u2212 2M/r and M is the mass of the black hole. Since this spacetime is static and spherically symmetric, it possesses four independent Killing vectors, which give rise to four conserved quantities according to Eq. (6).\nIt will also be useful in what follows to define the tetrad {et\u0302, er\u0302, e\u03b8\u0302, e\u03c6\u0302} constructed from the coordinate basis {\u2202\u00b5} as et\u0302 = 1\u221a f(r) \u2202t, er\u0302 = \u221a f(r)\u2202r, e\u03b8\u0302 = 1 r \u2202\u03b8, e\u03c6\u0302 = 1 r sin \u03b8 \u2202\u03c6.\n(8)"

            "text": "BODY IN THE SCHWARZSCHILD SPACETIME\nIt is a well-established fact that spinning particles in Schwarzschild spacetime may have chaotic behavior if their initial spin is not aligned with the equatorial plane, see for instance Ref. [13]. Here we are interested in another kind of phenomenon and, to emphasize this, we study only spinless bodies in what follows.\nWe consider an extended test body which controls its shape in such a way that it is always axisymmetric and has reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. This is implemented by choosing an appropriate prescription for the quadrupole moment of the body, J\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4(\u03c4), as discussed below. Assume that the body starts with S\u00b5\u03bd = 0. Then it will remain spinless at all times by symmetry. As a result, Eq. (3a) simplifies to\nDp\u00b5 d\u03c4 = F\u00b5, (9)\nfor \u00b5 = t, r and \u03c6 (three equations), since the motion is restricted to a plane (chosen as the equatorial plane \u03b8 = \u03c0/2). Equation (3b) is identically satisfied with S\u00b5\u03bd \u2261 0 by symmetry (this, of course, can always be checked later).1\nWe note that Eq. (9) is linear in t\u0307(\u03c4), r\u0307(\u03c4) and \u03c6\u0307(\u03c4) and so can be easily rewritten in the form\nt\u0307(\u03c4) = h1(r, pr, p\u0307r, \u03c4), (10a)\nr\u0307(\u03c4) = h2(r, pr, p\u0307r, \u03c4), (10b)\n\u03c6\u0307(\u03c4) = h3(r, pr, p\u0307r, \u03c4), (10c)\n1 This does not mean that the body is torque free, as observed in [5]. In fact, the \u201celectric part\u201d N0i of the torque still contributes to the hidden momentum of the body.\n3 where the dot represents d/d\u03c4 . These equations depend explicitly on \u03c4 only via the quadrupole tensor J\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4(\u03c4). Note that pt and p\u03c6 are constants of motion due to Eq.

It is in this frame that the expression of the quadrupole moment has axial and reflection symmetry.\nFollowing Dixon, we take this moving frame by choosing e\u03040 as the unit vector in the direction of p (i.e. e\u03040 = u) and {e\u03041, e\u03042, e\u03043} a nonrotating orthonormal triad in the rest space of e\u03040. The choice of e\u03040 in the direction of p instead of v is due to the fact that it is p that defines the surfaces of integration \u03a3\u03c4 of the multipoles (v and u may be thought of as the kinematical an dynamical velocities, respectively) . Also, by \u201cnonrotating\u201d we mean that the vectors e\u0304a are M-transported along the centerof-mass curve [7], so that they are four-vectors A\u00b5 which satisfy the equation of motion2\nDA\u03ba d\u03c4 \u2212 ( u\u03ba Du\u03bb d\u03c4 \u2212 Du \u03ba d\u03c4 u\u03bb ) A\u03bb = 0.\nIf the worldline is restricted to lie on the equatorial plane of Schwarzschild spacetime, one may take from start e\u03040 = u, e\u03043 = \u2212e\u03b8\u0302, so that only e\u03041 and e\u03042 need to be determined. The assumption that the body is axisymmetric and has reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane then implies that only six independent components of the quadrupole tensor may be\n2 Physically speaking, an arbitrary body subjected to a zero torque (N\u00b5\u03bd = 0) would have its spacelike spin vector S\u00b5 = 1 2 \u221a \u2212g \u00b5\u03bd\u03b3\u03b4u\u03bdS\u03b3\u03b4 satisfying the M-transport equation. In this\nway, an M-transported {e\u0304a} provides a physical standard of (absence of) rotation.\nnonzero in this (M-transported) frame: J\u03040101 = J\u03040202, J\u03040303, J\u03042323 = J\u03041313, and J\u03041212 (terms like J\u03040123 would be allowed by rotation symmetry but not by the reflection symmetry).\nFrom a more practical point of view, it is easier to construct another moving frame {ea} along the centerof-mass worldline z\u00b5(\u03c4), one that is not M-transported but also satisfies e0 = u and e3 = \u2212e\u03b8\u0302. Any frame of this kind can only differ from {e\u0304a} by a rotation in the plane of e\u03041 and e\u03042, so that e\u03041 = cos(\u03b2)e1 + sin(\u03b2)e2, e\u03042 = \u2212 sin(\u03b2)e1 + cos(\u03b2)e2, with \u03b2 = \u03b2(\u03c4). It immediately follows that, also with respect to the basis {ea}, the only nonzero independent components of the quadrupole tensor (Jabcd) are again J0101 = J0202, J0303, J2323 = J1313, and J1212, and that they are the same as those relative to {e\u0304a}, i.e., Jabcd = J\u0304abcd. A frame of this kind which is well suited for doing calculations is constructed in the Appendix, which provides a practical way of obtaining the equations of motion by going to {ea} first and then returning to the coordinate basis.\nAs we also show in the Appendix, the components J\u0304abcd of the quadrupole moment enter the equations of motion only via the combination\nq := J\u03040101 \u2212 J\u03040303 \u2212 J\u03042323 + J\u03041212. (12)\nThe components J0i0i and Jijij , i = 1, 2, 3, are, respectively, the mass and stress quadrupole moments of the body [11]. In this way, q measures the imbalance of the mass or stress components of T\u00b5\u03bd between the z direction and the xy directions of the axisymmetric body under consideration. One might think of the body, then, as a prolate (oblate) ellipsoid when q < 0 (q > 0).3 For a spherically symmetric body we obviously have q = 0 (this is also the case for a point particle, for which all the Jabcd are zero). This implies that a spinless, spherically symmetric test body follows geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime, just as in the point-particle limit."

Consider a two-dimensional system subjected to a time periodic perturbation, for which the equations of motion can be written in the form\nx\u0307 = f(x) + \u03bb(x, \u03c4), (20)\nwhere x = (r, pr), f = (f1(r, pr), f2(r, pr)), \u03bb = (\u03bb1(r, pr, \u03c4), \u03bb2(r, pr, \u03c4)), a dot represents differentiation with respect to \u03c4 , and 1. Assume that f and \u03bb are smooth and bounded and that \u03bb is periodic in \u03c4 . Also assume that the unperturbed system ( = 0) is Hamiltonian (therefore integrable) and that (r, pr) are canonical variables. Then\n\u2202f1 \u2202r + \u2202f2 \u2202pr = 0. (21)\nNow suppose that the unperturbed system has an unstable equilibrium point P0 and an associated homoclinic orbit in phase space. Since the system is integrable, the system\u2019s phase portrait will present continuous curves in the (r, pr) space.\nAlso, consider that the perturbation is Hamiltonian. Then we can construct a two-dimensional stroboscopic Poincare\u0301 map by plotting in the (r, pr) plane, for each orbit, the events tn = 2n\u03c0/\u2126 associated with a fixed numerical value of the Hamiltonian (so that the map is\nsymplectic). For sufficiently small , the fixed point in the map is displaced but still exists. The homoclinic orbit generally splits into a stable and an unstable manifold of the fixed point according to the map; if they present transverse intersections in the (r, pr) plane, then the integrability of the system is broken [14, 15].\nOne way to search for these homoclinic intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds is by means of Melnikov\u2019s integral, which gives us the first-order term in the transverse distance (with respect to the \u03c4 = \u03c40 point of the unperturbed homoclinic orbit), in phase space, between these two sets. A complete derivation of Melnikov\u2019s integral can be found in Ref. [16]. For our purpose, it is important to know that since Eq. (21) holds, Melnikov\u2019s integral is given by [15]\nM(\u03c40) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e (f1\u03bb2 \u2212 f2\u03bb1)(r(\u03c4), pr(\u03c4), \u03c4 + \u03c40) d\u03c4, (22)\nin which (r(\u03c4), pr(\u03c4)) is evaluated along the unperturbed homoclinic orbit. Therefore if M(\u03c40) has isolated zeros then the unstable and stable manifolds of the perturbed fixed point cross transversely, generating a homoclinic tangle in phase space [14].\nIn our case, f1 and f2 are given by Eqs. (A4a) and (A4c), and \u03bb1 = q(\u03c4) g1, \u03bb2 = q(\u03c4) g2, with q(\u03c4) given by Eq. (19) and g1, g2 given by Eqs. (A4b) and (A4d). Here, q0 plays the role of the small perturbation parameter in Eq. (20). Then the system is Hamiltonian [Eqs. (14) are satisfied] and Melnikov\u2019s method can be applied to the system, whose unperturbed homoclinic orbit is given by Eq. (18). After a lengthy calculation, the Melnikov integral (22) can be written as\nM(\u03c40) = 2 cos (\u2126\u03c40)K(\u2126), (23)\nwhere\nK(\u2126) = \u222b rm run k(r) sin [\u2126 \u03c4(r)]dr, (24)\nwith\nk(r) = 2M\n( \u22123Mr2 + 5Mr2un + r2run ) r6 (run \u2212 3M) . (25)\nIf \u2126 is such that K(\u2126) 6= 0, the Melnikov integral will have only isolated simple roots, which will be located at \u2126\u03c40 = (n \u2212 1/2)\u03c0, with n integer. The behavior of K as a function of \u2126 for two different values of run can be seen in Fig. 2, which shows that K(\u2126) = 0 solely at a discrete set of values of \u2126. This implies the existence of a homoclinic tangle for arbitrarily small values of the perturbation q0. We note that both the amplitude and the number of oscillations increase as run decreases, i.e., as the unperturbed unstable circular orbit gets closer to the black hole.\nThe behavior of K can also be illustrated by its K = 0 contour plot in the (run,\u2126) plane, Fig. 3. This shows the\n6 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 -0.02 -0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25\n-0.010 -0.005 0.000\n0.005\n0.010\nFIG. 2.

For Hamiltonian systems with bounded unperturbed energy level sets, homoclinic chaos is guaranteed once homoclinic intersections are detected [14\u201316]. In our case, on the other hand, the Hamiltonian system can be seen as a system with an escape (or exit, see Ref. [17]), the escape being the infall of the body into the black hole. Therefore the system exhibits transient chaos [18, 19], since trajectories will either be regular and bounded or will eventually fall into the black hole (except from sets of measure zero, which do not fall into the black hole, as for instance those with initial conditions lying at the homoclinic tangle associated with the unstable fixed point [18\u201320]).\nIt is implicit in our assumptions about the controllability of the body\u2019s internal distribution that, no matter how strong the tidal forces acting on it are, the internal mechanisms will be able to balance them and maintain the prescribed oscillations. Also, higher order multipole terms were neglected in our analysis. These considerations would have to be taken into account in a more realistic treatment of the problem."

            "text": "It has been recently shown that periodic oscillations in the mass distribution of a nonrelativistic test body may generate homoclinic chaos in its otherwise integrable translational dynamics [6]. Here we took advantage of the homoclinic orbit associated with an unstable circular orbit in Schwarzschild spacetime to show that a similar effect appears in general relativity (notice that such orbits have no analog in the corresponding nonrelativistic Kepler\u2019s problem).\nSpecifically, we considered a spinless axisymmetric spheroid aligned with the equatorial plane of the spacetime and allowed it to change its shape periodically between oblate and prolate configurations. We then showed that this breaks the system\u2019s integrability via homoclinic crossings of the stable and unstable manifolds associated with the unstable circular orbit. These crossings are identified via Melnikov\u2019s method and give rise to transient chaos in the system. All of this was done at quadrupolar order using Dixon\u2019s formalism for extended bodies in general relativity.\nIt is interesting to note that several authors studied homoclinic chaos for test-particle motion on blackhole spacetimes in the past decades (see, for instance, Refs. [21, 22]). Our approach is conceptually different from theirs as they consider point particles subjected to a spacetime with an externally perturbed metric. In the present work, the spacetime is the pure, unperturbed Schwarzschild spacetime, and the perturbation to testparticle motion comes from the finite-size structure of the test body.\nWe therefore believe that the present approach opens new windows to the study of the dynamics of extended\n7 bodies in standard spacetimes of general relativity. The present model is applicable to any object with timevarying internal structure, once the quadrupole approximation for the body is valid. Although the perturbation assumed in this work is sinusoidal, any time-dependent quadrupole perturbation q(\u03c4) is encompassed by the formalism. This is the case, for instance, of the long-term behavior of astronomical bodies with varying internal structure, such as the orbital motion of variable stars with nonradial pulsating patterns and satellite motion with prescribed (time-dependent) shape-changing variations.\nRegarding the orbital motion of pulsating stars, although the typical period of revolution of a star in the Milky Way is of the order of 100 Myr, this period becomes very short near a supermassive black hole as the object approaches the light ring, r = 3M . Therefore it is possible, in principle, to have imprints of the chaotic nature of the orbital motion of such bodies in the time series of the brightness variability of these stars."

If J\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 (J\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4) is given as if the evolution parameter s was chosen as \u03c4 (\u03c4\u0303), we have that J(\u03c4) = d\u03c4\u0303\nd\u03c4 J\u0303(\u03c4\u0303). The factor in front of J\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is anyway\nunimportant if one is interested in working up to octupole order, since in that case d\u03c4\u0303\nd\u03c4 J\u0303 = v\u00b5u\u00b5J\u0303 may be simply replaced by\nJ\u0303 [23].\n8 where E = \u2212pt and L = p\u03c6. Noticed that none of these expressions have t or \u03c6 on their right-hand side, as anticipated in the main text. They do depend on \u03c4 though, via q = q(\u03c4). Finally, following the procedure of the main text we obtain, up to quadrupole order, the dynamical system (13) with\nf1 = (r \u2212 2M)3/2pr\u221a\nE2r3 \u2212 (r \u2212 2M) (L2 + r(r \u2212 2M)p2r) , (A4a)\ng1 =\u2212 4L2M(r \u2212 2M)3pr\n(r(r \u2212 2M) (L2 + r(r \u2212 2M)p2r)\u2212 E2r4) 2 , (A4b)\nf2 = (r \u2212 2M)2\n( L2 \u2212Mrp2r ) \u2212 E2Mr3\nr2(r \u2212 2M)3/2 \u221a E2r3 \u2212 (r \u2212 2M) (L2 + r(r \u2212 2M)p2r) , (A4c)\ng2 = 2M\n( 2L4(r \u2212 2M)2 + L2r ( (r \u2212 2M)2(3r \u2212 4M)p2r + E2r2(8M \u2212 3r) ) \u2212 ( r(r \u2212 2M)2p2r \u2212 E2r3 ) 2 )\nr4 ((r \u2212 2M) (L2 + r(r \u2212 2M)p2r)\u2212 E2r3) 2 .
