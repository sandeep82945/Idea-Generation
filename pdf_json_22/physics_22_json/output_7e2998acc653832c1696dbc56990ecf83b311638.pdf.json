    "abstractText": "These notes contain essentially a rewriting of several properties of two well-known quantities, the so-called theta symbol (or triangular symbol), which is rational, and the 6j symbol, which is usually irrational, in terms of two related integer-valued functions called gon and tet. Existence of these related integer-valued avatars, sharing most essential properties with their more popular partners, although a known fact, is often overlooked. The properties of gon and tet are easier to obtain, or to formulate, than those of the corresponding theta and 6j symbols, both in the classical and quantum situations. Their evaluation is also simpler (the paper displays a number of explicit formulae and evaluation procedures that may speed up some computer programs). These two integer-valued functions are unusual, in that their properties do not appear to be often discussed in the literature, but their features reflect those of related real-valued functions discussed in many places. Some of the properties that we shall discuss seem however to be new, in particular several relations between the function gon and the inverse Hilbert matrices.",

            "text": "This set of notes started as a a pedagogical exercise, or as a self-directed learning activity. The purpose was to present the notions underlying the definitions and properties of several well-known functions of mathematics and theoretical physics, namely the so-called triangular (or trihedral, or theta) symbols and 6j symbols, in very simple terms.\nThese functions are used by several communities working in often quite distinct fields, for instance elementary quantum physics, chemistry, spin networks and spin foams, particle physics, quantum gravity, topological field theory, geometry of 3-manifolds, representation theory of semisimple Lie groups, weak Hopf algebras, category theory, and even quantum computing, to mention just a few. Quite often the various definitions of these functions, and the writing of their properties, appears as rather involved, in the sense that they require some familiarity with specific scientific domains. The terminology itself is not fully standardized because several objects bearing the same name often differ by normalization prescriptions or have a meaning that has not be stable along the years.\nThe main observation is the following: there exists a variant of the theta symbols (triangular symbols) that makes them integer-valued, and there is also a variant of the 6j symbols that makes them integer-valued. The integrality of these two variants comes from the fact that they can be written as multinomial coefficients (or sums of multinomials). The \u201cusual\u201d theta and 6j symbols are related to their respective integer-valued variants by normalization coefficients that have an elementary geometrical interpretation. This fact is certainly known by experts (or aficionados) but it is often overlooked, and the absence of such a description in the literature \u2014with some rare exceptions, like [12]\u2014 is quite surprising.\nWe therefore decided to write a kind of compendium of formulae involving these integer-valued avatars of the theta and 6j symbols. The paper does not contains many proofs because most formulae displayed in the following pages come from well-documented properties of the theta and 6j symbols but they are usually simpler and look more natural when written in terms of their integer-valued variants. We also decided to give a name to these two integer-valued functions: in order to avoid the notation tri (or \u03b8) for the variant of the triangular function, we decided to call it gon (also because it can be generalized to polygons), and to call tet the integer-valued variant of the 6j-symbol. As already mentioned, most formulae to be found in the next pages are nothing but a re-writing of known relations, however we shall discover a few others along the way; in particular we shall discover unexpected relations with the coefficients of inverse Hilbert matrices (see sec. 2.1.9). A double triangle identity discussed in sec. 2.1.5 does not seem to be much discussed in other places either.\nIt turns out that the q-number generalization of the two integer-valued functions gon and tet is very simple to obtain, and we shall describe them as well (the \u201cclassical\u201d 6j symbols are used in elementary quantum physics, but their quantum analog are not !). The first part of this paper is devoted to the definition and study of the \u201cclassical\u201d functions gon and tet whereas the second part (more sketchy) is devoted to their \u201cquantum\u201d counterpart. Several comments are gathered in the last section (Miscellaneous) where the reader will in particular find a very brief summary of the spin network formalism \u2014that we shall not use in the main body of the text, but which is related to our previous discussions.\nThere is a huge literature on the mathematics of the triangular and 6j symbols, most of the corresponding results are rather old and now belong to the folklore. Selecting references is not an easy task, some being more appropriate than others for readers with a specific background; we shall nevertheless mention here a few classical textbooks. General or historical ones belong to the physics literature, we can mention [15], [24]. The mathematically oriented reader having particular applications in mind will find useful informations in [7], [17], [19], [31]. One can also look at the appropriate sections of Wikipedia. Finally we included a short appendix that briefly recalls\nthe historical motivation behind the definitions of various families of coefficients (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, 3j symbols, 6j symbols) and where we display a few relations that are standard, but not every reader is expected to be familiar with the subject. We shall sometimes refer to this appendix for notational purposes and when we need to make contact between the functions gon or tet discussed in the main body of the text and more traditional quantities."

            "text": "Let pa, b, cq be a triplet of non-negative integers. We first assume that this triplet is triangular, meaning that it obeys triangular inequalities: the numbers a, b, c are such that a ` b \u00b4 c \u011b 0, b` c\u00b4 a \u011b 0 and c` a\u00b4 b \u011b 0. These integers can therefore serve as the side lengths of an integer triangle (possibly degenerate, either because one edge is zero or because one of the triangular inequalities is an equality). We also assume that the perimeter a ` b ` c is even. A triplet of non-negative integers a, b, c obeying the above two constraints is called admissible.\nNotice that a` b\u00b4 c \u201c pa` b` cq \u00b4 2c is a difference of two even integers; hence a` b\u00b4 c is an even integer, and this is true as well for b` c\u00b4 a and c` a\u00b4 b. One can therefore introduce three new non-negative integers m,n, p as follows:\nm \u201c 1 2 pc` a\u00b4 bq, n \u201c 1 2 pa` b\u00b4 cq, p \u201c 1 2 pb` c\u00b4 aq.\nThen a \u201c m` n, b \u201c n` p, c \u201c p`m. The semiperimeter \u03c3 of the triangle pa, b, cq reads\n\u03c3 \u201c pa` b` cq{2 \u201c m` n` p,\nand we have m \u201c \u03c3 \u00b4 b, n \u201c \u03c3 \u00b4 c, p \u201c \u03c3 \u00b4 a. Notice that pa, b, cq admissible implies m \u011b 0, n \u011b 0, p \u011b 0, but this does not imply that pm,n, pq should be triangular: m,n, p can be arbitrary non-negative integers. It is clear from the above that there is a one to one correspondance between the triplets pa, b, cq and the triplets pm,n, pq. We find convenient to refer to the first as external variables, and to the next as internal variables; the external variables label edges of triangles, whereas the internal variables should be thought as labels for the segments displayed on fig. 1.\nIt is sometimes useful \u2014 and anyway traditional in physics \u2014 to introduce the spin variables j1 \u201c a{2, j2 \u201c b{2, j3 \u201c c{2. One hasm \u201c j3`j1\u00b4j2, n \u201c j1`j2\u00b4j3, p \u201c j2`j3\u00b4j1. These so-called spin variables j1, j2, j3 are either integers or half-integers. Notice that m` n` p \u201c j1 ` j2 ` j3.\nOne can interpret also a, b, and c (twice the spin variables) as the components of the highest weights defining three irreducible representations (irreps) of SUp2q in the basis of fundamental weights \u2014 since SUp2q has only one fundamental weight this basis has only one element. We shall usually denote the irreducible representations themselves by their highest weight. The dimension of the irrep with highest weight component equal to x \u201c 2j is dimpxq \u201c x ` 1 \u201c 2j ` 1. In this interpretation, a triplet of representations pa, b, cq is admissible if c (for instance) enters the decomposition of the tensor product a b b as a sum of irreducible representations, equivalently, if abbbc contains the trivial representation, i.e., if and only if c P t|a\u00b4b|, |a\u00b4b|`2, . . . , a`b\u00b42, a`bu. As it will appear many times, we give a name to the previous set: for non-negative integers u, v, we call\n\u00e2\nru, vs \u201c t|u\u00b4 v|, |u\u00b4 v| ` 2, . . . , u` v \u00b4 2, u` vu (1)\n2.1.2 The elementary gon function (triangular function)\nFor an admissible triplet pa, b, cq, the function gonpa, b, cq is defined in terms of the variables m,n, p, introduced previously, as a particular multinomial coefficient:\nDefinition 1.\ngonpa, b, cq \u201c Multinomialpm,n, p, 1q \u201c pm` n` p` 1q! m!n!p!\n(2)\nExplicitly,\ngonpa, b, cq \u201c ` 1 2pa` b` cq ` 1 \u02d8 ! `\n1 2pa` b\u00b4 cq\n\u02d8 ! ` 1 2pa\u00b4 b` cq \u02d8 ! ` 1 2p\u00b4a` b` cq \u02d8\n! (3)\nSince Multinomialpm,n, p, 1q, also written Mpm,n, p, 1q for short, is a multinomial coefficient, the value of gonpa, b, cq for an admissible triplet is automatically an integer. By construction, the function gon is symmetric in its three arguments. Using the semi-perimeter variable \u03c3 introduced previously and the fact that Mpm,n, p, 1q \u201c p\u03c3 ` 1qMpm,n, pq we can also write gon as follows:\ngonpa, b, cq \u201c p\u03c3 ` 1qMp\u03c3 \u00b4 a, \u03c3 \u00b4 b, \u03c3 \u00b4 cq (4)\nwhere Mp\u03c3 \u00b4 a, \u03c3 \u00b4 b, \u03c3 \u00b4 cq is the multinomial coefficient \u03c3!p\u03c3\u00b4aq!p\u03c3\u00b4bq!p\u03c3\u00b4cq! . The reader familiar with the theory of spin networks will have recognized that the function gon is, up to sign, equal to one of the avatars (one of the evaluations) of the so called theta graph, usually denoted C. One should however be cautious because there are several evaluations prescriptions for the evaluation of spin networks, differing by normalization factors. We shall give a brief account of this theory in sec. 4.1 (see also 2.1.7) and compare the different prescription types. Among them, one may be called the \u201cinteger evaluation prescription\u201d, precisely because the evaluation gives an integer. In particular the evaluation of the C graph with edges a, b, c, using this particular prescription, is denoted CZpa, b, cq and it is enough, for the moment, to mention that\nCZpa, b, cq \u201c p\u00b41q\u03c3 gonpa, b, cq.\nWe extend the definition of the function gonpa, b, cq by declaring that it vanishes if its three arguments do not build an admissible triplet of non-negative integers (this is also what is done for C in the theory of spin networks). Another possibility, given three arbitrary real positive numbers a, b, c, could be to introduce the same variables m,n, p as before but use Gamma functions rather than factorials in the definition (2) of gon; even more generally one could think of using the multivariate Euler Beta function B with three arguments, Bpm,n, pq \u201c \u0393pmq\u0393pnq\u0393ppq{\u0393pm`n`pq, and consider the function defined as 1{pp\u03c3 ` 2qB p\u03c3 \u00b4 a` 1, \u03c3 \u00b4 b` 1, \u03c3 \u00b4 c` 1qq. However, we shall not explore such possibilities here.\nIn section (2.1.6) we shall generalize the notion of admissibility and extend the definition of the gon function in such a way that it admits an arbitrary number of compatible arguments."

If a, b, c are thought as labels for highest weights of SUp2q irreps, we know that the concept of admissibility can be interpreted as coming from the requirement that c appears in the decomposition of a b b as a sum of irreps. Replacing SUp2q by SUpNq, N \u011b 2, leads to analogous considerations but for the fact that multiplicities appearing in the decompositions of the tensor products of irreps can be larger than 1; this difficulty triggered the invention of several types of pictographs (BerensteinZelevinsky diagrams [3], Ocneanu O-blades [25], Knutson-Tao honeycombs [20]) that are such that the number of distinct pictographs, for a given admissible triplet of highest weights pa, b, cq, is precisely equal to the associated multiplicity. This is not the right place to give the definitions and properties of these combinatorial tools but we want to mention that the admissible triangles considered previously can be understood as particular cases of such pictographs when the chosen Lie group is SUp2q. For illustration, we display a generic SUp2q O-blade in fig. 1; notice that pa, b, cq indeed labels its external edges and pm,n, pq its internal ones. For SUpNq O-blades with N \u0105 2, the number of internal edges is larger than the number of components of the three chosen highest weights, but for N \u201c 2, they are equal.\nIn the SUp2q case the above picture also provides a combinatorical interpretation for the function gonpa, b, cq. Let us replace a single internal edge labelled n by n parallel strands, or wires, (with an analogous replacement for m and p), this leads to a picture where we have distributed \u03c3 \u201c m ` n ` p distinct wires wj among three directions A,B,C, with m objects along the first direction, n objects along the second, and p objects along the third. The number of such partitions is the multinomial coefficient Mpm,n, pq and each choice can be specified by an anagram of the\nword Apm timesqBpn timesqCpp timesq or by a triple Aps1q, Bps2q, Cps3q where the si are increasing sequences of integers of lengths m,n, p building a set partition of t1, 2, . . . , \u03c3u, for instance Ap2q, Bp1, 4q, Cp3, 5, 6q. The extra factor pm`n` p` 1q leading from Mpm,n, pq to Mpm,n, p, 1q, i.e. to gonpa, b, cq comes from a marking of the wires (or the choice of an orientation) with the constraint that, for each partition, if the wire wj is marked, all wires wj with i \u0103 j should be marked as well. Parallel wires can be interpreted as tensor products of copies of the fundamental representation of SUp2q giving rise, after appropriate symmetrization, to arbitrary irreducible ones; such graphical interpretations are among the foundational building blocks of topological quantum field theory (TQFT) and recoupling theory, see also our short discussion of Hom-spaces and intertwiners in 4.3, but here is not the right place to discuss those topics further.\n2.1.5 A topological identity of the gon function: the double triangle identity\nThe following proposition will not come as a surprise for people working in recoupling theory but we could not find a reference where it is explicitly stated. The proof of this duality property is obtained after performing elementary changes of variables in the finite sums involved in eq. 6 or 7, below, and by using the definition of gonpa, b, cq as a multinomial, but one has to consider many cases that depend upon the relative values of a, b, c, d, and of their pair-wise sums or differences. The proof, that is left to the reader, is therefore elementary but rather lengthly and cumbersome.\nConsider a quadrilateral pa, b, c, dq, it can be thought as the union of two triangles pa, b, sq and pc, d, sq glued along the diagonal u, or as the union of two triangles pa, d, tq and pb, c, tq glued along the other diagonal t (fig. 2). We have:\nProposition 1.\n\u00ff sPS gonpa, b, sq 1 s` 1 gonpc, d, sq \u201c \u00ff tPT gonpa, d, tq 1 t` 1 gonpb, c, tq (6)\nIn the first sum, s runs over the set S of integers such that both pa, b, sq and pc, d, sq are admissible triplets; in second sum, t runs over the set T of integers making admissible both pa, d, tq and pb, c, tq. The above sums are also equal to\n\u00ff uPU gonpa, c, uq 1 u` 1 gonpb, d, uq (7)\nwhere u runs over the set U of integers making admissible both pa, c, uq and pb, d, uq. Quadrilateral function: the left or right hand side of eq. 6, or the expression 7, defines the number gonpa, b, c, dq which is an integer for each quadruplet. About integrality: We already know that gonpa, b, cq is divisible by pc` 1q, therefore each term of the sums (6) or (7) is also an integer, and, consequently, their sum gonpa, b, c, dq as well.\nTo illustrate the above proposition let us take pa, b, c, dq \u201c p3, 4, 6, 11q, therefore S \u201c t5, 7u, T \u201c t8, 10u, U \u201c t7, 9u; the sum over S reads 388080`2522520, the sum over T reads 1108800`1801800, the sum over U reads 748440` 2162160, and the three sums are indeed equal.\nIn terms of SUp2q representation theory, using integers labelling (highest weights of) irreducible representations, S denotes the intersection of the set of irreps that appear in the decomposition into irreps of the tensor products ab b and cbd, T denotes the intersection of the set of irreps that appear in ab d and bb c, and U denotes the intersection of the set of irreps that appear in ab c and bb d. Using the notation (1) we have explicitly S \u201c \u00c2 ra, bs X \u00c2 rc, ds, T \u201c \u00c2 ra, ds X \u00c2\nrb, cs, and U \u201c \u00c2 ra, cs X \u00c2\nrb, ds. A quadruplet of non-negative integers (labelling irreps) is called admissible when the tensor product ab bb cb d contains the trivial representation \u2014we shall say more about this notion in sec. 2.1.6. If the quadruplet is not admissible, gonpa, b, c, dq vanishes.\nIntuitively, one either couples the irreps a and b to give the possible s\u2019s that, themselves, couple to the irreps c and d, or one first couples a and d, to give the possible t\u2019s that couple to b and c. This \u201ccoupling\u201d can be interpreted in terms of composition of equivariant homomorphism (intertwiners) which are briefly discussed in section 4.3. Using particle physicists parlance, one can say that gonpa, b, c, dq is invariant upon interchange of the s, t, and u channels (the symbols s, t, u refer to the Mandelstam variables introduced in the 50\u2019s to study duality properties in particle diffusion processes [22]).\nA combinatorial interpretation of the above quadrilateral function can also be given, along the same lines as the ones discussed for gonpa, b, cq itself in sec. 2.1.4, by drawing a square with either one diagonal or the other, by replacing edges and the chosen diagonal by wires relating the four corners, and interpreting each contribution to the above sums as a counting of the possible distributions of wire labels (obeying a marking constraint similar to the one discussed in 2.1.4) among five directions: the four sides of the quadrilateral and the chosen diagonal.\nSome readers will have noticed that, up to a possible replacement of gon by the theta net of sec. 2.1.7, a single contribution to the above sums, like the term gonpa, b, sq gonps, c, dq{ps ` 1q, is ubiquitous in recoupling theory and in the theory of spin networks where it appears as a normalization coefficient for one of the \u201cdouble triangles\u201d that make a tetrahedron (see sec. 2.2.1).\n2.1.6 Definition of the function gon for arbitrary admissible polygons and multisets\nIt is convenient in the present discussion to consider multisets (in a multiset, order does not matter and repetitions are allowed). We denote multisets either by square brackets or by braces, like sets, while adding an index to elements to denote their multiplicity (which can be absent it is equal to 1), for instance r2, 2, 2, 3, 3s \u201c t23, 32u. Consider now a multiset rais of non-negative integers such that \u0159 ai is even and 2 maxpaiq \u010f \u0159\nai. Such a multiset will be called admissible. We define recursively the function gon on arbitrary admissible multisets as follows:\nDefinition 2. Let rais be an admissible multiset and u, v, two non-negative integers such that the multiset rai, u, vs obtained by adjoining u and v to rais is also admissible. Then we set\ngonpai, u, vq \u201c \u00ff\nx\ngonpai, xq 1\npx` 1q gonpx, u, vq, (8)\nwhere x belongs to the intersection of the sets \u00c2 ru, vs and tm,m ` 2,m ` 4,m ` 6 . . . ,maxpaiqu, where m \u201c maxp2 maxpaiq \u00b4 \u0159\nai, 0q. This formula defining gon on the admissible multiset rai, u, vs assumes that rais possesses at least two elements; the base case of the recursion is known from the already defined function gon on admissible triplets. One could remove the admissibility requirement from the above definition, indeed the value of gon on a non admissible multiset would automatically vanish because of the appearance of non admissible triplets on the right hand side of eq. 8. For this definition to make sense for a given admissible multiset, i.e. for the obtained function to be a symmetric function of\nits arguments, one has to show that the result is independent of the method used to recursively construct this multiset in terms of smaller ones; the proof (left to the reader) comes from the double triangle identity and from the symmetry property of the elementary gon function.\nFrom a group theoretical point of view, the condition of admissibility for a multiset rais can be interpreted, or defined, from the requirement that the tensor product bai of the SUp2q irreps defined by the ai\u2019s (thought of as highest weights) should contain the trivial representation. The two sets whose intersection has to be taken to select the x\u2019s that enter eq. 8 have the following interpretation: the first set is the set of highest weights of those irreps of SUp2q that appear in the decomposition of ub v into irreducible components; the second is the set of (distinct) highest weights that appear in the decomposition of bai into irreps, equivalently it is the underlying set of the multiset \u00c2\nrais; it can be determined iteratively by using associativity of the representation ring. The obtained list of highest weights builds a multiset \u00c2\nrais with usually non-trivial multiplicities since, for a product involving more than two irreps, the multiplicities can be bigger than 1 but in the recursive definition (8) one does not take multiplicities into account. The factor px ` 1q in the denominator can be interpreted as the dimension of the representation labelled by the highest weight x.\nThe definition of gon given in eq. 8 has a natural geometrical interpretation that can also be used as a definition. Consider an arbitrary polygon with (non-negative) integer sides, we define the function gon on this polygon as follows. By inserting diagonals, the polygon can be triangulated in many ways. Choose some triangulation and label the diagonals c in such a way that c belongs to the set \u00c2\nra, bs for each of the triangles ta, b, cu that countain c (at most 2); this defines a labelling of the triangulation. For a given labelling, take the product of the triangular gon functions over all the 2-simplices of the triangulation, divided by a product of factors px ` 1q where the x\u2019s are the lengths of the diagonals (1-simplices) entering the chosen triangulation; the last step is to sum this product over all possible labellings of the chosen triangulation. The duality property of the elementary gon function, interpreted geometrically as in fig. 2, ensures that the obtained result is independent of the chosen triangulation. The polygon is called non-admissible if the obtained value is equal to 0 (this can be traced back to the occurence of non-admissible triangles in the triangulation). The obtained gon function is symmetric as a function of the edges of the polygon (proof: use this symmetry for the known elementary gon function defined on triangles).\nA pentagonal example. Consider the multiset r11, 3, 4, 1, 5s. It is indeed admissible and the value of gon can be obtained by introducing two diagonals like in fig 3 and summing over the three triangles. Using br1, 4s \u201c t3, 5u, br3, 5s \u201c t2, 4, 6, 8u, br5, 11s \u201c t6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16u, one finds gonp11, 3, 4, 1, 5q \u201c gonp6,5,11q gonp6,3,3q gonp3,4,1qp6`1qp3`1q ` gonp1,4,5q p5`1q p gonp3,5,8q gonp8,11,5q p8`1q ` gonp3,5,6q gonp6,11,5q p6`1q q \u201c 18295200. One could instead use eq. 8, first calculating gon on the quadrilateral of fig 4 (left) and completing the picture by adding one single triangle with two possible values (4 and 6) for the diagonal, indeed \u00c2 r5, 1s \u201c t4, 6u and \u00c2\nr4, 11, 3s \u201c t41, 62, 83, 104, 124, 143, 162, 181u. The same value of gon would be obtained as gonp11,3,4,4q gonp4,1,5qp4`1q ` gonp11,3,4,6q gonp6,1,5q p6`1q . We could also choose another diagonal, like in fig 4 (right), and calculate gonp3,4,1,6q gonp6,5,11qp6`1q ` gonp3,4,1,8q gonp8,5,11q\np8`1q since the possible values of this diagonal are 6 and 8, indeed, \u00c2 r11, 5s \u201c t6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16u and \u00c2\nr3, 4, 1s \u201c t01, 22, 42, 62, 81u. The displayed polygons may be misleading since most triangles of this triangulation are degenerate \u2013 the figures are not metrically correct. One should also remember that gon is symmetric, the order of arguments (sides of the n-gon) is therefore irrelevant."

The value gonpn, n, n, nq is equal to the trace of the inverse of the pn`1q-th order Hilbert matrix.\nExample :\nHp3q\u00b41 \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02dd 9 \u00b436 30 \u00b436 192 \u00b4180 30 \u00b4180 180\n\u02db \u201a, tr pHp3q\u00b41q \u201c 381, gonp2, 2, 2, 2q \u201c 381.\nEntries of the inverse of the Hilbert matrix can be expressed in closed form using binomial coefficients (see for instance [16]), summing over diagonal elements leads to eq. 13, hence the result. Another way to prove this result is to rely on the OEIS data basis since one of the expressions of tr pHpn ` 1q\u00b41q for the generic term of the sequence A189766 of [26], written in terms of an hypergeometric function, coincides with (12) when a \u201c b. Admittedly, a more conceptual proof should be looked after.\nWe now define the shifted Hilbert matrix of order n, and shift s P N, as the n\u02c6n matrix Hpn, sq with matrix elements Hpn, sqpi, jq \u201c 1{pi` j \u00b4 1` sq. For instance\nHp5, 3q \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02da \u02da \u02da \u02dd\n1 4 1 5 1 6\n1 7\n1 8\n1 5 1 6 1 7\n1 8\n1 9\n1 6 1 7 1 8\n1 9 1 10\n1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 1 11 1 8 1 9 1 10 1 11 1 12\n\u02db\n\u2039 \u2039 \u2039 \u2039 \u201a\nOne has Hpn, 0q \u201c Hpnq. One may consider Hpn, sq as a n \u02c6 n submatrix of the infinite Hilbert matrix, with the diagonal element 1{ps` 1q as its upper left corner.\nNotice that Hp5, 3q\u00b41 \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02da \u02da \u02dd 19600 \u00b4141120 352800 \u00b4369600 138600 \u00b4141120 1058400 \u00b42721600 2910600 \u00b41108800 352800 \u00b42721600 7144200 \u00b47761600 2993760 \u00b4369600 2910600 \u00b47761600 8537760 \u00b43326400 138600 \u00b41108800 2993760 \u00b43326400 1306800 \u02db \u2039 \u2039 \u2039 \u201a\nSumming over all entries of the diagonal of the inverse of the shifted Hilbert matrix (they can again be deduced from [16]) leads to eq. 11. Summing over appropriate rows (see below) leads to a multinomial coefficient that one recognizes as the value of gonpa, b, cq. In this way one obtains the next two propositions:\nProposition 3. For all non-negative integers a, b, one has\ngonpa, b, a, bq \u201c tr pHpminpa, bq ` 1, |a\u00b4 b|q\u00b41q\nExample: gonp4, 7, 4, 7q \u201c trpHp5, 3q\u00b41q \u201c 18066760.\nThe value gonpa, b, cq itself can be obtained from the inverse of a shifted Hilbert matrix by summing the matrix elements of an appropriate row:\nProposition 4. Without loss of generality, let us assume that the admissible triplet pa, b, cq is such that a \u010f b \u010f c, then one has\ngonpa, b, cq \u201c \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00ffHpa` 1, b\u00b4 aq\u00b41rrpc` a\u00b4 bq{2` 1ss\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nwhere M rrjss denotes the row j of a matrix M , and \u0159 M rrjss the sum over the corresponding matrix elements. Warning: we know that gon is symmetric in its arguments, but the right hand side of the previous equality is not, hence the importance of ordering the arguments a, b, c as indicated.\nExample: gonp4, 7, 9q \u201c 9240, to be compared with \u0159\nHp5, 3q\u00b41rr4ss \u201c \u0159 t\u00b4369600, 2910600,\u00b47761600, 8537760,\u00b43326400u \u201c \u00b49240.\n2.1.10 Other properties of the function gon\nFrom the function gon to special Clebsch-Gordan and Wigner 3j symbols. The relation expressing Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in terms of 3j symbols (and conversely) is recalled in the appendix, eq. 59. We write it here using in-line Mathematica notations.\nClebschGordanptj1,m1u, tj2,m2u, tj,muq \u201c a 2j ` 1p\u00b41qj1\u00b4j2`mThreeJSymbolptj1,m1u, tj2,m2u, tj,\u00b4muq (14)\nThe arguments j1, j2, and j, in this formula, are spin variables (half-integers). Remember that the arguments of the gon functions, called a, b, c, . . . in the previous sections, are twice the spin variables. The spin j is allowed to take values from |j1 \u00b4 j2| to j1 ` j2 and the (half-integer) arguments mi run from \u00b4ji to `ji, one has also m \u201c m1 ` m2, otherwise the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient vanishes. If both j1 and j2 are integers (the so-called orbital case), j has to be an integer as well, and choosing arguments m1 \u201c m2 \u201c m \u201c 0 is allowed; one can therefore consider the particular values\nClebschGordanptj1, 0u, tj2, 0u, tj, 0uq \u201c a 2j ` 1 p\u00b41qj1\u00b4j2 ThreeJSymbolptj1, 0u, tj2, 0u, tj, 0uq (15)\nAn explicit expression for (15) was obtained long ago, see formula 3.194 of the book [5], vol VIII, the authors attribute this expression to Racah \u2014 notice that they call \u201cWigner coefficients\u201d what everybody nowadays would call \u201cClebsch-Gordan coefficients\u201d. Using eqs. (5), one can then rewrite their expression in terms of the gon function and therefore express the above particular Clebsch-Gordan coefficients as follows:\nClebschGordanptj1, 0u, tj2, 0u, tj, 0uq \u201c cos \u00b4 pj1 ` j2 \u00b4 jq \u03c0\n2\n\u00af\na 2j ` 1 1` 1 2 pj ` j1 ` j2q ` 1 \u02d8 gonpj1, j2, jq a\ngonp2j1, 2j2, 2jq (16)\nNotice that the cos term in (16) is either 0, or a sign (\u02d81), and that these special Clebsch-Gordan coefficients vanish if pj1, j2, jq is not an admissible triple, in particular if j1 ` j2 ` j is odd. From a computational point of view, their evaluation in Mathematica using the function gon (as defined in section 2.1.2) is about ten times faster than the one using the built-in ClebschGordan function.\nNotice that since we know how to write the gon function (with three arguments) in terms of sums of coefficients of an inverse and shifted Hilbert matrix, one can also relate the special Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (15) to Hilbert matrices by using the formulae of section 2.1.9.\nAn expression of gon using a Dyson - MacDonald identity. This identity states that the Laurent polynomial \u015b\n1\u010fi\u2030j\u010fkp1\u00b4ti{tjqsi has constant term equal to the multinomial coefficient Mps1, s2, . . . , skq. It was first conjectured by Dyson [10] and later proved by Wilson [39], Gunson [14], Good [13] (the conjecture was then generalized by MacDonald [21], with a general proof given by Cherednik [8]).\nWith m,n, p defined in terms of a, b, c as in 2.1.1, one can use this identity with k \u201c 4 to express the function gonpa, b, cq, written as the multinomial coefficient with four parts Mpm,n, p, 1q, as the constant term of a Laurent polynomial; one can also set t1 \u201c uvw t4, t2 \u201c vw t4, t3 \u201c w t4 and trade the four variables ti for the three variables u, v, w. Therefore we have:\nProposition 5. : gonpa, b, cq can be obtained as the constant term of (17) or (18) \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 w\n\u02d9 p1\u00b4uqm \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 u\n\u02d9n p1\u00b4vqn \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 v\n\u02d9p p1\u00b4wqp \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 vw\n\u02d9 p1\u00b4uvqmp1\u00b4vwqn \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 uv\n\u02d9p \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 uvw\n\u02d9\np1\u00b4uvwqm\n(17) One could also write gonpa, b, cq as pm ` n ` p ` 1q times the multinomial coefficient with three parts Mpm,n, pq and use the Dyson-MacDonald identity with k \u201c 3 to write the latter as the constant term of another multivariate Laurent polynomial. One can then set t1 \u201c uv t3, t2 \u201c v t3 and trade the three variables ti for the two variables u, v. With that choice, gonpa, b, cq is recovered as the constant term of\npm` n` p` 1q \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 u\n\u02d9n \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 v\n\u02d9p \u02c6\n1\u00b4 1 uv\n\u02d9p\np1\u00b4 uqmp1\u00b4 vqnp1\u00b4 uvqm (18)\nAdmittedly these expressions are a bit heavy and more complicated than the explicit result itself; one hope was to use them to obtain similar expressions for the multivariable generalizations of gon, but this is not known to the author.\nAsymptotics of gon. Using the Stirling formula for the factorial leads to the following\nProposition 6. : When k goes to infinity, we have\ngonpka, kb, kcq \u201ek\u00d18 \u03c32\n2\u03c0A\n\u02c6\n\u03c3\u03c3\nmmnnpp\n\u02d9k\n(19)\nwhere A \u201c ?\u03c3mnp is the area (Heron formula), \u03c3 is the semi-perimeter of the triangle pa, b, cq, and m,n, p are the usual variables m \u201c \u03c3 \u00b4 b, n \u201c \u03c3 \u00b4 c, p \u201c \u03c3 \u00b4 a.

            "text": "Consider ppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq, a pair of triplets of non-negative integers. We shall say that this defines an admissible tetrahedron T if the following constraints are obeyed: the first triplet pa, b, cq is an admissible triple, as defined in section 2.1.1, and the triplets pb, d, fq, pa, e, fq, pc, d, eq are also admissible. Warning: the triplet pd, e, fq that appears as the second argument of T is usually not admissible. We shall often write this tetrahedron as\nT \u201c ` a b c d e f \u02d8 .\nSuch a pair of triplets (the first being admissible) can be displayed as a tetrahedron T , as follows: the components of the first argument, i.e., the triplet pa, b, cq, refer to edges defining one of the triangular faces of T , and the components of the second argument pd, e, fq, in this order, denote respectively the edges of T that are skew (i.e., opposite) with respect to a, b, c, see fig. 5. Obviously, the same tetrahedron can be obtained by choosing, as a first argument, any of its four triangular faces, and as a second argument, the triplet of edges that are skew with respect to the three edges of the chosen face. The above notation for a tetrahedron being not unique we think of T as an equivalence class of such pairs of triplets under the action of the tetrahedral group.\nThe triangular conditions on faces ensure that the four faces of T can indeed be realized as actual euclidean triangles. Warning: these conditions are not sufficient to imply that an admissible tetrahedron, in the above sense, can be realized as an euclidean tetrahedron of R3, indeed, the Cayley-Menger determinant defined by the edges may not be positive. Notice also that our \u201cedges\u201d\nmay vanish (degenerated cases). For all these reasons one should maybe write \u201cpossibly degenerated admissible integer-sided non-congruent facial sextuples\u201d rather than \u201cadmissible tetrahedra\u201d but we shall nevertheless stick to the shorter terminology.\nRemoving one column in the symbol ` a b c d e f \u02d8 of T (there are three possibilities) gives a labelling\nfor the three closed skew quadrilaterals, for instance ` a b d e \u02d8 refers to the quadrilateral pa, b, d, eq. This gives rise to the so-called recoupling coefficients, see sec. 2.2.10.\n2.2.2 The integer valued tet function (the tetrahedral function, also denoted ,Z)\nWe shall first define a function tet on the set of admissible tetrahedra T (if the argument is not admissible, the value of tet is set to 0).\nFor the four triangular faces of T we introduce the semi-perimeter variables\n\u03c3p1q \u201c 1 2 pa` b` cq;\u03c3p2q \u201c 1 2 pb` d` fq;\u03c3p3q \u201c 1 2 pa` e` fq;\u03c3p4q \u201c 1 2 pc` d` eq. (20)\nFor the three closed (and skew) quadrilaterals defined from the edges of T we also introduce the semi-perimeter variables\n\u03c4p1q \u201c 1 2 pa` b` d` eq; \u03c4p2q \u201c 1 2 pa` f ` d` cq; \u03c4p3q \u201c 1 2 pe` f ` b` cq. (21)\nMoreover we set\nm\u03c3 \u201c maxp\u03c3p1q, \u03c3p2q, \u03c3p3q, \u03c3p4qq; m\u03c4 \u201c minp\u03c4p1q, \u03c4p2q, \u03c4p3qq.\nThen we define:\nDefinition 3.\ntetpT q \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02dd\nm\u03c4 \u00ff\ns\u201cm\u03c3\np\u00b41qsps` 1q! \u00b4\n\u015b4 i\u201c1ps\u00b4 \u03c3piqq!\n\u00af\u00b4\n\u015b3 u\u201c1p\u03c4puq \u00b4 sq!\n\u00af\n\u02db\n\u201a (22)\nThe above expression, taken here as a definition of tet, is simply related to the known value of the so-called tetrahedral net; this will be discussed in the next subsection. From the definition of the four \u03c3piq variables (triangles) and of the three \u03c4puq variables (quadrilaterals), one finds \u0159\ni \u03c3piq \u201c \u0159 u \u03c4puq \u201c a` b` c` d` e` f , therefore \u0159 ips\u00b4 \u03c3piqq ` \u0159 jp\u03c4pjq \u00b4 sq ` 1 \u201c s` 1.

Since we can rewrite this expression as a sum of multinomials, it is clear that tet is integer-valued.\nExamples: tetpp8, 20, 24q, p15, 13, 17qq \u201c 332385335268386400, tetpp14, 41, 33qp50, 23, 21qq \u201c \u00b4671777611858249170324639542553600.\nIt is instructive to express the function tet in terms of the internal triangular variables (i.e., the m,n, p of section sec. 2.1.1) rather than in terms of the external triangular variables (i.e., the a, b, c of sec. 2.1.1, aka highest weights of SUp2q irreps). Calling 1, 2, 3, 4 the four faces of the tetrahedron T , and mi, ni, pi the internal triangular variables of the face i, we see that the semi-perimeter \u03c3piq of the face i is the perimeter of the triangle pmi, ni, piq since \u03c3piq \u201c mi`ni` pi, and that the \u03c4puq are the perimeters of the squares:\n\u03c4p1q \u201cn1 ` n2 ` n3 ` n4 \u03c4p2q \u201cm1 `m2 `m3 `m4 \u03c4p3q \u201c p1 ` p2 ` p3 ` p4\n(24)\nThe internal variables associated to the four triangles and the three squares contributing to the evaluation of tet can be seen in fig. 6 (to be contrasted with the external variables displayed in fig. 5).\n2.2.3 The TET function (also denoted ,K)\nIn the Temperley-Lieb recoupling theory, in topological field theory, or in the theory of spin networks, one introduces the following TET function, also called tetrahedral net or tetrahedral network [17], chapter 8, or tetrahedron coefficient [23]; it can also be denoted ,K (see sec. 4.1). Warning: TET is denoted Tet in [17], it should not to be confused with the symbol tet used in the present paper. Consider again a tetrahedron T written for instance as ppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq. With the same variables \u03c3piq, \u03c4pjq, m\u03c3, m\u03c4 , as in sec. 2.2.2, one defines:\nTETpT q \u201c J E \u02c6\n\u00a8\n\u02dd\nm\u03c4 \u00ff\ns\u201cm\u03c3\np\u00b41qsps` 1q! \u00b4\n\u015b4 i\u201c1ps\u00b4 \u03c3piqq!\n\u00af\u00b4\n\u015b3 j\u201c1p\u03c4pjq \u00b4 sq!\n\u00af\n\u02db\n\u201a (25)\nwhere\nJ \u201c i\u201c4,j\u201c3 \u017a\ni\u201c1,j\u201c1 p\u03c4pjq \u00b4 \u03c3pjqq! and E \u201c a!b!c!d!e!f !\nIn [17] or [23] the expression (25) results from a calculation that we do not need to comment or repeat because in the present paper we take this expression as a definition of TETpT q.\nObviously TETpT q, given by 25, differs from tetpT q, given by 22, by a T -dependent prefactor; dropping the argument T we have:\nTET \u201c J{E \u02c6 tet (26)\nBecause of this prefactor J{E the function TET is usually rational-valued but not integer-valued. For the first tetrahedron example considered in 2.2.2 we find TETpp8, 20, 24q, p15, 13, 17qq \u201c 47753192176448 .\n2.2.4 From the function tet to 6j symbols (also denoted ,U)\nOne potentially confusing issue is that, apart from the possible replacement of spin variables j by highest weight variables 2j, the quantities that are called \u201c6j symbols\u201d in many articles of the mathematical literature (in particular in those fields related to Temperley-Lieb recoupling theory or in the theory of invariants of 3-manifolds), and also in several papers discussing topological quantum field theory or spin networks, differ from the original Wigner\u2019s 6j symbols used in most physics textbooks, in [19], or in the computation program Mathematica. The two kinds of symbols sometimes appear in the same reference: both are for instance discussed in [7] where the first are simply called \u201c6j symbols\u201d and denoted with curly braces, whereas the last are called \u201cnormalized 6j symbols\u201d and denoted with square brackets; these notational conventions are not universal either since, in many textbooks (and in the present paper, see the appendix), the curly braces denote \u201c6j symbols\u201d that coincide with the normalized ones of [7]. We also adopt the in-line notation SixJSymbol for these (normalized) symbols, like in eq. 28 but the reader should remember that the arguments of the latter are spin variables, i.e., half-integers, in order to agree with what is done in quantum mechanics or in Mathematica. In order to ease the comparison with papers using un-normalized 6j symbols, like [7], [17] or [23], we introduce in eq. 27 the notation SixJSymbolUN to denote the latter. The relation between the function TET and the 6j symbols of SUp2q is known: eq. 27, below, can be found for instance in [17] and [23], and both eqs. 27 and 28 appear in [7].

From the general definition of hypergeometric functions pFq it was then observed (see the thesis [37], pp 29-30, and [38]) that the expression found by Racah could be written in terms of the hypergeometric function 4F3. Formulating this last result in terms of the integer-valued functions tet, see the formula 31 below, is a simple matter of redefinition (using the relation 30) and of change of variables.\nGeneral case.

It was originally proven [4, 11] by considering the coupling of four orbital momenta, and derived in [5], vol 9, pp 22-30, as a consequence of associativity of one of the two products that the authors define on a particular family of tensor operators. The identity written below for the integer-valued tet function is a rewriting of the Biedenharn-Elliott identity, using eq. 30. Let us consider the triangular bipyramid B obtained by gluing two tetrahedra ppb, h, kq, pg, a, eqq and ppc, d, hq, pg, e, fqq along the common base pe, g, hq. We want to associate a number hedpBq (actually an integer) to such bipyramids.\nA first possibility is to define a new function hed1 as follows:\nhed1pa, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, kq \u201c tetppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq tetppa, b, cq, pg, h, kqq\np\u00b41qpa`b`cq{2 gonpa, b, cq (34)\nIntuitively, the factor p\u00b41qpa`b`cq{2 gonpa` b` cq in the denominator comes from the fact that the two tetrahedra share the same triangular base.\nOne can however obtain the same triangular bipyramid by introducing a diagonal x, from \u201ctop\u201d to \u201cbottom\u201d, and gluing three tetrahedra ppc, e, dq, px, g, hqq, ppb, d, fq, px, k, gqq and ppa, e, fq, px, k, hqq. This is illustrated in fig. 7. Another natural definition for a function hed would therefore be as follows:\nhed2pa, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, kq \u201c \u00ff\nxPbrd,gsXbrf,ksXbrh,es\ntetppc, e, dq, px, g, hqq tetppb, d, fq, px, k, gqq tetppa, e, fq, px, k, hqq p\u00b41qxpx` 1q p\u00b41qpx`d`gq{2 gonpx, d, gq p\u00b41qpx`f`kq{2 gonpx, f, kq p\u00b41qpx`e`hq{2 gonpx, e, hq\n(35)\nThe three tetrahedra appearing in hed2 share three triangles giving the factor that appear in the denominator. The summation is performed over the common edge pxq, giving a factor p\u00b41qxpx`1q in the numerator; this factor can be thought of as coming from the fact that the edge pxq is a degenerated triangle, so that its inserted contribution is p\u00b41qppx`0`xq{2qgonpx, 0, xq \u201c p\u00b41qxpx`1q.\nProposition 10. One has: hed1pa, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, kq \u201c hed2pa, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, kq. This value depends neither on the order chosen for enumerating the triangular faces of B nor on the order of the edges describing these faces. One can therefore define a function hedpBq on bipyramids, either by eq. 34 or by eq. 35.\nExample. Consider the bipyramid B defined by pa, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, kq \u201c p28, 26, 6, 23, 19, 31, 39, 33, 17q From eq 34 one finds hedpBq \u201c 1395161475725373449470726604935680000. The same value is obtained from eq 35, with x running in the set \u00c2\nr23, 39s X \u00c2 r31, 17s X \u00c2 r33, 19s \u201c t16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48u.\nRemarks. As already mentioned, the identity (35) for double-tetrahedra is nothing else than the Biedenharn-Elliott identity in a new guise, since the latter is usually written in terms of 6j symbols which, unlike tet, are not usually integer valued. It is tempting to try to use this \u201ctopological identity\u201d (thought of as a 2-3 Pachner move, see [27]), to obtain an integer valued function function that would coincide with tet on integer tetrahedra, with hed on integer bipyramids, and that could be generalized to arbitrary polyhedra with admissible integer sides ( this is why the function defined by (34) or (35) was called hed, as a mnemonic shortening of polyhedron.). However, trying to develop such a 3-dimensional analog of what we did when we extended the triangle function gon to arbitrary admissible polygons does not work because, as we shall see below (sec. 2.2.8), when performing a barycentric subdivision, one needs to introduce an extra factor (a division by \u03b42 in a 1-4 Pachner move) that is not fully determined by the values attributed to the sides of the chosen polyhedron. We shall say nothing in these notes about the Turaev-Viro method (that was developed in the quantum framework) which leads to invariants of 3-manifolds, see [34].\nIn spite of the fact that the Biedenharn-Elliott identity plays an important role in the theory of spin networks, one should mention that the function hed introduced above is not associated with such a network (see sec. 4.1), indeed, the 1-skeleton of the bipyramid is not a 3-valent graph, some vertices being 4-valent \u2014by way of contrast, all Wigner 3nj symbols are associated with (particular) 3-valent graphs."

Choose some point in R3 (not a vertex of T ); in order to obtain a geometrical interpretation of the construction we may think of that point as belonging to the inside of the tetrahedron T , it therefore defines a subdivision of the latter into a union of four tetrahedra, each one sharing three vertices of T and the chosen extra vertex. One therefore constructs the four tetrahedra: T1 \u201c ` a b c \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u02d8 , T2 \u201c ` A B c \u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b4 \u02d8 , T3 \u201c ` C A b \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b4 \u02d8 , T4 \u201c ` a B C \u03b4 \u03b3 \u03b2 \u02d8\n, see fig 8.

Given an admissible tetrahedron T there is an infinite number of possible barycentric subdivisions defined by a quadruple p\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4q, however, if one internal edge (for instance \u03b4) is fixed to some integer value, there is only a finite set of triplets p\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3q for which the above six triangular conditions will be obeyed. The cardinality of this set of triplets depends of course on the given tetrahedra T ; it increases with the value of the chosen \u03b4 and stabilizes when \u03b4 reaches some value \u03b4max.

            "text": "In this subsection we consider a cube (actually a parallelepiped) decorated with a family of compatible non-negative integers, to which we attach a quantity, that we call cube, using some kind of statistical sum involving the integer-valued functions gon and tet previously discussed. This quantity does not seem to be related with standard constructions (in particular it is not an integer variant of the cube function that one knows how to define in the theory of spin networks); as a matter of fact this subsection is not very much related to the other topics discussed in these set of notes, and we could (maybe should) have removed it from the manuscript. It remains, however, that we find cube interesting, and we hope that some reader will find a way to incorporate this quantity naturally in a general framework, or find some use for it.\nConsider a cube in R3. Its standard triangulation yields six 3-simplices (six congruent birectangular tetrahedra); however one can find a triangulation containing only five 3-simplices: slice off four corners (not edge-related), this makes four congruent three-right-angled tetrahedra, and what is left inside is a regular tetrahedron, see fig. 9. As it is well known, 5 is the minimal number of\nsimplices in a triangulation of a 3-cube. Looking at fig. 9 we see that the following simplices (tetrahedra) are formed: r0, 1, 2, 4s, r1, 2, 3, 7s, r2, 4, 6, 7s, r1, 4, 5, 7s, and r1, 2, 4, 7s. With the previous labels to denote vertices we use pairs of labels to denote the edges (and a natural ordering to avoid double counting). In terms of edges we have the following sub-tetrahedra: pp01, 12, 20qp24, 04, 14qq, pp24, 46, 62q, p67, 27, 47qq, pp14, 45, 51q, p57, 17, 47qq, pp12, 23, 31q, p37, 17, 27qq, pp12, 24, 41q, p47, 17, 27qq. Only the last one is regular, the others are rectangular. There are four shared faces that build the regular tetrahedron, with six common edges, 12, 14, 17, 24, 27, 47, and four common points: 1, 2, 4, 7. The 12 given cube edges are 01, 13, 32, 20 45, 57, 76, 64 04, 15, 26, 37. The new edges appearing in the triangulation are 6 diagonals (the edges of the regular tetrahedron), namely: 14, 17, 27, 24, 12, 47.\nAn interesting cube function could be defined as follows. We suppose given 12 non-negative integers for the edges of the cube, actually a parallelepiped. We first determine all the sets of four rectangular tetrahedra defining a possible dissection by imposing admissibility conditions on the tetrahedra. The number of such sets is finite. For each such possibility we take the product of the functions tet for the five tetrahedra of the dissection, we then divide by the gon functions associated with the four common faces (triangles) of the fifth tetrahedron, and multiply the obtained result by the contribution pxij ` 1q of the six new edges. Finally we sum over these possibilities, each of them corresponding to the six new edges that appear in the dissection (the diagonals of the faces of the cube). Examples. Assuming that all 12 edges are equal to n, we call cubepnq the result. One finds cubep0q \u201c 1, cubep1q \u201c \u00b463488 (a sum over 15 possibilities), cubep2q \u201c `5580307647 (a sum over 127 possibilities), cubep3q \u201c \u00b4297180797599744 (a sum over 648 possibilities). One may of course consider parallelepipeds with unequal edges. For instance one can choose the edges x01 \u201c 2, x13 \u201c 1, x23 \u201c 2, x02 \u201c 1, x45 \u201c 2, x57 \u201c 1, x67 \u201c 2, x46 \u201c 1, x04 \u201c 1, x15 \u201c 1, x26 \u201c 1, x37 \u201c 1, and obtain 1994112 as the value for the corresponding \u201ccube\u201d function .\nThe above \u201ccube function\u201d is not a priori related to the cube function that one can define as a spin network (evaluation of the latter makes sense, see sec. 4.1, since the 1-skeleton of the 3- dimensional cube is indeed a trivalent graph). For a cube with all edges equal to n, the latter, and its asymptotics, were considered by Don Zagier (appendix of [12]). Its values for the first values of n are: 1, 6144, 505197000, 77414400000000, . . .\n2.2.10 Other properties of the function tet\nRegge symmetry of the function tet. Let us consider the four semi-perimeters of the non-planar quadrilaterals defined by a tetrahedron (see fig. 5): p12 \u201c pa` b` d` eq{2, p23 \u201c pb` c` e` fq{2,\np31 \u201c pa` c` d` fq{2.\nProposition 12. For each choice of such a quadrilateral, the tet function is invariant when its arguments, that are also edges entering the chosen quadrilateral, are simultaneously shifted as follows by the corresponding semi-perimeter:\ntetppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq \u201c tetppp12 \u00b4 a, p12 \u00b4 b, cq, pp12 \u00b4 d, p12 \u00b4 e, fqq tetppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq \u201c tetppa, p23 \u00b4 b, p23 \u00b4 cq, pd, p23 \u00b4 e, p23 \u00b4 fqq tetppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq \u201c tetppp31 \u00b4 a, b, p31 \u00b4 cq, pp31 \u00b4 d, e, p31 \u00b4 fqq\n(38)\nProof: Using the relation between the function tet and the 6j symbols (see eq. 30), one obtains the above property from the fact that the latter are known to be invariant under the same transformation (Regge symmetry). For a modern treatment of these symmetries, see [6].\nAsymptotics of the function tet. Expanding on the work of Wigner [35], an asymptotic formula relating the value of the 6j-symbol, when the dimensions of the representations are large, to the volume of an Euclidean tetrahedron whose edge lengths are these dimensions, was conjectured in [29] (Ponzano-Regge formula). The proof, together with an interpretation in terms of geometric quantization, was obtained in [31], see also [32]. This formula assumes that all the arguments are large but it is also interesting to study what happens when one or more arguments stay constant whereas the others increase. One may picture the various asymptotic regimes in terms of vertices or in terms of edges of an associated tetrahedron, and the various asymptotic regimes may be called r1, 1, 1, 1s (all the edges are large), r1, 1, 2s (one edge stay small), r2, 2s (two edges stay small) and r1, 3s (three edges stay small). The r1, 3s case was explicitly considered in one section of [29], where the formula below, eq. 39, was proved (this expression had already been mentioned in [1]). Sketch of the proof: express the 6j symbols as a sum of products of four 3j symbols (as before), write the 3j\u2019s in terms of factorials, and use the Stirling formula to study the chosen asymptotic regime. For given compatible arguments a, b, c, d, e, f , the asymptotic equivalent, when r goes to infinity, of a r-shifted and rescaled 6j symbol can be written in terms of a Wigner 3j symbol as follows:\na p2rq SixJSymbolppa, b, cq, pd`r, e`r, f`rqq \u201er\u00d18 p\u00b41qpa`b`c`2pd`e`fqqThreeJSymbolppa, e\u00b4fq, pb, f\u00b4dq, pc, d\u00b4eqq. (39)\nThe interested reader can obtain an expression giving an asymptotic equivalent for the tet function in terms of one 3j symbol (or of one Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and several appropriate gon factors from eq. 39 by expressing the 6j symbol in terms of the tet function using eq. 30.\nRecoupling coefficients, Racah coefficients, cells, and orthogonality. Let T be an admissible tetrahedra labelled with integers a, b, c, d, e, f (twice the spin variables), as in fig. 5. Choose a pair of opposite edges, the two other pairs of opposite edges building a closed (and skew) quadrilateral. Obviously there are three possible choices. For instance we may choose the pair carrying the labels pb, eq, the corresponding quadrilateral being pa, c, d, fq; also denoted ` a c d f \u02d8\n: This quadrilateral is obtained by removing one column in the symbol specifying the tetrahedron T , the position of this column in the symbol is actually not relevant: it may be the second column if we denote T by `\na b c d e f\n\u02d8\nbut it will be for instance the third column if we denote the same tetrahedron by `\na c b d f e\n\u02d8\n. For the choice pb, eq, a quantity of interest is\nUbe \u201c p\u00b41qpa`c`d`fq{2 a pb` 1qpe` 1q SixJSymbolpT q. (40)\nIt is proportional to the 6j symbol but the removed column gives an extra square root, and the left-over quadrilateral gives a sign. The choice of another pair of opposite edges in T leads to similar coefficients Ube, Uad, Ucf . From now on, for definiteness, we choose the edge pb, eq. This\nnumber is called a recoupling coefficient [40], or a unitary Racah coefficient (see [5], vol 1, p 111, or [15], p 314). The Racah coefficient itself is Wbe \u201c p\u00b41qpa`c`d`fq{2 SixJSymbolpT q, it differs from Ube by a square root and from the associated 6j symbol by a possible sign. Another notation used in the literature for the same Racah coefficient, using spin variables and displaying the six arguments, is W pa{2, c{2, f{2, d{2; b{2, e{2q but the order of arguments is not unique because of the tetrahedral symmetries of T . Racah coefficients were defined in [30], see also the discussion in [5], vol 1, p 101, or in [40]. We only mention them here in order to avoid confusion with similar quantities, indeed it is not uncommon to see the name of Racah associated with distinct families of objects (the 6j\u2019s, the un-normalized version of the 6j\u2019s, the recoupling coefficients, or the Racah coefficients themselves).\nIn terms of the two integer-valued functions gon and tet, the recoupling coefficients read as follows (using eqs. 40 and 30):\nUbe \u201c p\u00b41qpa`c`d`fq{2\na\npb` 1qpe` 1q tetrpa, b, cq, pd, e, fqs a\ngonpa, b, cq gonpa, e, fq gonpb, d, fq gonpc, d, eq (41)\nProposition 13. For given non-negative integers a, c, d, f , consider the matrix U with matrix elements Ube as in 41, where pb, eq belongs to the set of pairs of non-negative integers for which the tetrahedron T \u201c ppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq is admissible. Then we have the following proposition: The matrix U is orthogonal i.e. U.UT \u201c UT .U \u201c 1. This is nothing but a rewriting of the orthogonality property for the recoupling coefficients, which itself can be traced back to a similar property (discussed in many places) for the associated 6j symbols.\nRemark: The quantities U may also be called \u201ccells\u201d because they describe the pairing defining a bigebra structure (actually a weak Hopf algebra) on the vector space B of double triangles; this is a particular case of a much more general construction (\u201cOcneanu cells\u201d). In a nutshell, one considers formally the graded vector space generated by admissible triplets pa, b, cq pictured as triangles (the grading is defined by b, which is displayed horizontally), and its corresponding graded endomorphism algebra B. A particular basis of the latter is conveniently described in terms of \u201chorizontal double triangles\u201d: an horizontal double triangle of type b is a pair of two triangles sharing the same edge b, displayed horizontally. Dually we have also \u201cvertical double triangles\u201d (spanning the dual of B) where the common edges are displayed vertically. The numbers U define a non trivial pairing: they are used to define a coalgebra structure on B. The obtained bigebra is infinite dimensional since the grading b ranges over N. The theory has been developed in the quantum case ( when q is a root of unity, B is finite dimensional); a brief account is given in [9], which also contains a study of several explicit examples. In the classical case, the existence and properties of the two algebra structures was discussed in [5], vol 2, using another language and notations. In the present notes we are mostly interested in the arithmetic properties of the integer-valued functions gon and tet, so this is not the right place to discuss the above in more details.\nExpressing the function tet in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Since the integer valued function tet differs by normalization factors only from the 6j symbol, see eq. 30, and since the latter can be written as a multiple sum over a product of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (or of 3j symbols), see the Appendix (sec. 4.4), it is clear that one can also express tet as a sum involving products of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This is left as an exercise."

In the present section we shall only give the corresponding definitions, state the analogous properties, and, only in a few cases, provide sketch of proofs.\n3.1 q-numbers and q-factorials\nIf n is a real number, in particular if it is a positive integer, and q is complex, there are two variants of q-numbers that we recall below.\nrnsq \u201c qn \u00b4 q\u00b4n q \u00b4 q\u00b41 and rrnssq \u201c 1\u00b4 qn 1\u00b4 q (42)\nHere we only use the first convention, and sometimes ommit the surrounding square bracket, setting nq \u201c rnsq.

Warning: the pre-defined function QFactorialrs, qs of Mathematica, which is displayed in this program (using the so called\u201ctraditional form\u201d) as rssq!, coincides with our rrsss!q. We shall only use the first notion of q-factorial (i.e., our rssq!) in the following.\n3.2 The quantum gonq function\n3.2.1 q-admissible triplets\nq-admissibility. If q is a root of unity with q \u201c exppi\u03c0{\u03baq, with \u03ba an integer larger or equal to 2, so that q\u03ba \u201c \u00b41, we do not only assume that the triplet pa, b, cq is admissible in the classical sense, i.e., triangular and a` b` c even, but we also assume that a` b` c \u010f 2\u03ba\u00b4 4. It is standard to call \u201clevel\u201d the integer ` \u201c \u03ba\u00b4 2.\n3.2.2 The elementary quantum gonq function (triangular function)\nThe quantum q-triangle function (i.e., the gonq function with three arguments) is defined as follows:\nDefinition 5.\ngonqpa, b, cq \u201c \u201c 1 2pa` b` cq ` 1 \u2030 !q \u201c\n1 2pa` b\u00b4 cq\n\u2030 !q \u201c 1 2pa\u00b4 b` cq \u2030 !q \u201c 1 2p\u00b4a` b` cq \u2030 !q (43)\nWhen q is a root of unity we assume that pa, b, cq is q-admissible, otherwise we set gonqpa, b, cq \u201c 0. Example: gonqp3, 7, 8q \u201c 7q 8q 9q 10q\n12q 2q , whose classical limit (i.e., q \u00d1 1) is gonp3, 7, 8q \u201c 2520, explicitly reads:\n\u00b4 q12 ` q8 ` q4 ` 1 \u00af \u00b4 q12 ` q10 ` q8 ` q6 ` q4 ` q2 ` 1 \u00af \u00b4 q16 ` q14 ` q12 ` q10 ` q8 ` q6 ` q4 ` q2 ` 1 \u00af \u00b4 q18 ` q16 ` q14 ` q12 ` q10 ` q8 ` q6 ` q4 ` q2 ` 1 \u00af\nq29\n3.2.3 Duality property: a topological identity of the gonq function.\nProposition 14. Like in the classical case we have the duality property: \u00ff\nsPS gonqpa, b, sq\n1\nrs` 1sq gonqpc, d, sq \u201c\n\u00ff tPT gonqpa, d, tq\n1\nrt` 1sq gonqpb, c, tq (44)\nwhere S (resp. T ) denote the set of integers s (resp. t) making q-admissible both triplets pa, b, sq and pc, d, sq (resp. both pa, d, tq and pb, c, tq). The above sums are also equal to \u0159\nuPU gonqpa, c, uq 1 ru`1sq gonqpb, d, uq where u runs over the set U of integers making q-admissible both pa, c, uq and pb, d, uq. Any one of these three sums defines the same q-quadrilateral function gonqpa, b, c, dq.\nAs in the classical case, the identity 44 comes from an isomorphism between the vector spaces of intertwiners HomSUp2qqpVabVb, VcbVdq or HomSUp2qqpVabVd, VbbVcq and HomSUp2qqpVabVbb Vc b Vd,Cq. The word \u201cduality\u201d comes from the Frobenius duality (or reciprocity) briefly recalled in our discussion in 4.3. We are not aware of any published purely q-deformed combinatorial proof of this identity.\n3.2.4 Extension of the function gonq to arbitrary q-admissible multisets\nLike in the classical case, the above topological property allows one to extend the definition of gonq to arbitrary q-admissible multisets, by choosing some triangulation of any polygon whose edges are elements of this multiset. One takes the product of the triangular gonq functions over all the 2-simplices of the triangulation, divided by a product of factors rx ` 1sq where the x\u2019s are the lengths of the diagonals (1-simplices) entering the chosen triangulation. Property (44) ensures that the result is independent of the choices. In the root of unity case, q-admissibility can be re-phrased in terms of representation theory of the quantum group SUqp2q by imposing that the product of the simple objects defined by the arguments (in the associated appropriate monoidal category) contain the trivial representation.\nThe above leads to the recursive definition:\nDefinition 6.\ngonqpx1, x2, . . . , xn, u, vq \u201c \u00ff\nx\ngonqpx1, x2, . . . , xn, xq 1\nrx` 1sq gonqpx, u, vq (45)\nwhere the sums runs over elements x of the intersection of the underlying sets associated with the multisets brx1, x2, . . . , xns and bru, vs. As before the notation \u00c2\nrais refers to the multiset of highest weights that appear in the direct sum decomposition (irreps) of the chosen tensor products. In the root of unity case, the determination of \u00c2\nrais is quite subtle because some of the multiplicities can be smaller than in the classical case if the chosen level is not chosen big enough, and some of the highest weight classically present in the decomposition can even disappear. We shall not discuss that issue further in the present paper since it is discussed at length in articles devoted to the study of quantum groups or of conformal field theory. As in the classical case, the symmetry property of gonq comes from the previous double triangle identity 44 and from the symmetry property of the elementary gonq function.\nExample: We look at the pentagonal example defined by the set t11, 3, 4, 1, 5u that we already considered in the classical case. If q is a root of unity we assume that we choose a level big enough in order not to worry with the possible disappearance of some representations.

After multiplication by q raised to some appropriate power (70 in the above example) we obtain a polynomial in q. It is actually monic symmetric unimodal in the variable q2.\n3.2.5 The CK,q function\nThe q-analog of the classical theta net whose definition was recalled in section 2.1.7 is discussed in many places, see for instance [17] , [7]. Its expression is given by the quantum analog of eq. 9, the factorials being replaced by q-factorials:\nCK,qpa, b, cq \u201c p\u00b41qm`n`p rm` n` p` 1s!q rms!qrns!qrps!q rm` ns!qrm` ps!qrn` ps!q\n(46)\nIts relation with the elementary gonq function is given by the q-analog of eq. 10.\n3.2.6 The function gonq and quantum Hilbert matrices\nThe q-Hilbert matrix Hq of order n is defined as the n \u02c6 n matrix Hqpnq with matrix elements Hqpnqpi, jq \u201c 1{ri` j \u00b4 1sq.\nFor instance Hqp3q \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02dd\n1 r1sq 1 r2sq 1 r3sq\n1 r2sq 1 r3sq 1 r4sq\n1 r3sq 1 r4sq 1 r5sq\n\u02db\n\u2039 \u201a \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02da \u02dd\n1 q q2`1\nq2\nq4`q2`1 q\nq2`1 q2 q4`q2`1 q3\nq6`q4`q2`1 q2\nq4`q2`1 q3 q6`q4`q2`1 q4 q8`q6`q4`q2`1\n\u02db\n\u2039 \u2039 \u201a .\nSeveral formulae have been obtained in the literature for the entries of the inverse Hilbert matrix, classical (see for instance [16]), or quantum (see [2]). The corresponding trace, calculated for instance using eq. 33 of [2], gives the same result as gonqpn, n, n, nq calculated from eq. 44.\nProposition 15. The value gonqpn, n, n, nq is equal to the trace of the inverse of the pn ` 1q-th order quantum Hilbert matrix.\nExample:\nHqp3q\u00b41 \u201c\n\u00a8\n\u02da \u02da \u02da \u02da \u02dd\npq4`q2`1q2 q4\n\u00b4pq 2`1qpq4`1qpq4`q2`1q2 q7 pq4`1qpq4`q2`1qpq8`q6`q4`q2`1q q8\n\u00b4pq 2`1qpq4`1qpq4`q2`1q2 q7 pq2`1q4pq4`1q2pq4`q2`1q q10 \u00b4pq 2`1qpq4`1qpq4`q2`1q2pq8`q6`q4`q2`1q q11\npq4`1qpq4`q2`1qpq8`q6`q4`q2`1q q8 \u00b4pq 2`1qpq4`1qpq4`q2`1q2pq8`q6`q4`q2`1q q11 pq4`1q2pq4`q2`1q2pq8`q6`q4`q2`1q q12\n\u02db\n\u2039 \u2039 \u2039 \u2039 \u201a\nTrpHqp3q\u00b41q \u201c gonqp2, 2, 2, 2q \u201c q 24`4q22`13q20`27q18`47q16`63q14`71q12`63q10`47q8`27q6`13q4`4q2`1 q12 with classical limit gonp2, 2, 2, 2q \u201c TrpHp3q\u00b41q \u201c 381.

Without taking this precaution in the sum, the following identity would fail for small levels. Like in the classical case, one has the following analog of the quantum Biedenharn-Elliott identity:\nhed1,q \u201c hed2,q . (47)\n3.3.4 The quantum TETq function (also called ,K,q)\nThis function is formally defined by the same expressions as in the classical case (see eq. 25), with simple modifications: factorials should be replaced by q-factorials and the four triangles should be q-admissible.

            "text": "Quantities called triangular functions (or theta symbols), and 6j symbols, show up in many branches of physics or mathematics where they are usually defined as CK , and as ,U (or SixJSymbol). Existence of their integer-valued partners gon and tet is usually not even mentioned but it remains that the definition of these two functions fits naturally in the theory of spin networks. We give below a very short summary of the evaluation procedures in this theory in order to ease the comparison between functions and concepts defined there and the two functions gon and tet \u2014 we write \u201cprocedures\u201d with a plural because very often in the literature, only one procedure is mentioned (they are rare exceptions, for instance [12]).\nClassical spin networks. Let \u0393 be a tri-valent graph and a coloring \u03b3 of its edges by natural numbers (0 is allowed). \u0393 is assumed to be admissible: at each vertex of \u0393 the triplet of integers should be admissible (in particular their sum is even). There are closed graphs (no external lines) and open graphs. A spin network is defined by a pair p\u0393, \u03b3q, for instance (C, \u03b3) or (,, \u03b3).\nWarning: Starting from the spin network defined by the labelled (i.e., colored) theta graph (C, \u03b3) where admissibility is imposed on the three edges meeting at each vertex, one obtains by duality an admissible triangle, like in section 2.1.1, where admissibility is defined around a triangular face. The tetrahedron is a self-dual figure, but duality permutes the notions of admissibility: the tetrahedron spin-network defined by the tri-valent graph (,, \u03b3) is, by definition, admissible (as a spin network), but the tetrahedron obtained from the labels defined by \u03b3 (see fig. 10) is usually not admissible in the sense of section 2.2.1, however its dual, obtained by permuting the two triplets in the notation ppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq, is. Any spin network (\u0393, \u03b3) can be evaluated. The meaning of the obtained number depends on the theory (physical or mathematical) in which spin networks are used: in the original Penrose theory [28], which was a simple model for a quantum space, it was used to calculate the probabilities of various spin values; in various theories of quantum gravity this number is interpreted as an amplitude for a quantum state of space-time itself; other interpretations arise in knot theory, or in the geometry of 3-manifolds. An evaluation procedure is defined for each colored connected tri-valent graph by the following set of rules :\n\u2022 A value is set for the loop graph: see below.\n\u2022 A value is set for the theta graph C: see below.\n\u2022 A value is set for the tetrahedron graph ,: see below.\n\u2022 Three rules (called recoupling rules) allow one to simplify the evaluation of \u0393 on the coloring \u03b3 by replacing a given graph by a sum of products (or ratios) of numbers, which involves only evaluations of the loop graph, the theta graph, the tetrahedron graph, and, if the original graph was open, a family of left over graphs which are 3-valent trees or straight lines. As we do not need these rules in the present paper, we refer the reader to the literature on the subject, for instance [12].\nThere are several possible evaluation procedures (at least four kinds). We call them Integer evaluation \u0393Zp\u03b3q, Penrose evaluation \u0393P p\u03b3q, Kauffman evaluation \u0393Kp\u03b3q, and Unitary evaluation \u0393U p\u03b3q. They differ by normalization prescriptions (see below).\nFor a given coloring \u03b3 of a tri-valent graph \u0393 we call v1, v2, v3 the values of the three edges emanating from the vertex v of \u0393. Call V p\u0393q the set of vertices, Ep\u0393q the set of edges, and \u03b3peq the coloring of the edge e. Define \u03c3v \u201c v1`v2`v32 and \u0398v \u201c p\u00b41q \u03c3v p\u03c3v ` 1qMp\u03c3v \u00b4 v1, \u03c3v \u00b4 v2, \u03c3v \u00b4 v3q\nwhere M denotes the multinomial coefficient.

N p\u0393q \u201c \u03a0vPV p\u0393q a |\u0398v|. (52)\nFor all evaluation procedures, the evaluation of the loop graph on the integer n is p\u00b41qnpn`1q. For a spin network (\u0393, \u03b3) with integer evaluation \u0393Zp\u03b3q, one defines the other evaluation procedures as follows:\n\u0393P p\u03b3q \u201c J p\u0393q \u02c6 \u0393Zp\u03b3q, \u0393Kp\u03b3q \u201c J p\u0393q Ep\u0393q \u02c6 \u0393Zp\u03b3q, \u0393U p\u03b3q \u201c 1 N p\u0393q \u02c6 \u0393Zp\u03b3q. (53)\nIt is therefore enough to specify the integer evaluations \u0393Zp\u03b3q where \u0393 is either the theta graph C (dual to the triangle with edges pv1, v2, v3q), or the tetrahedron graph ,, with coloring dual to the admissible tetrahedron T with labels ppa, b, cq, pd, e, fqq.

            "text": "A linear map between two representation spaces that commutes with the group action is, by definition, an equivariant linear map between these two representations; it is also called an intertwiner. In other words, an intertwiner is a homomorphism of representation spaces. Let a and b denote two finite dimensional unitary irreducible representations of some compact group. Their tensor product a b b is a (usually not irreducible) representation, its decomposition into irreducible representations reads ab b \u201c \u00c0\ni ci where each of the ci appearing in this direct sum is an irreducible subrepresentation of ab b. There may be repetitions of the ci that occur in that direct sum (multiplicity). If the chosen group is the Lie group SUp2q, the multiplicity is always equal to 1, this is a particular feature of SUp2q. In terms of highest weights of irreps, the fact that c should be such that |a\u00b4 b| \u010f c \u010f |a` b| (the law of \u201ccoupling of spins\u201d) makes the triplet pa, b, cq admissible and translates as a usual triangle inequality. In terms of representations spaces, the inclusions of these irreducible subrepresentations are intertwiners maps; the adjoint \u03b3 of such an inclusion \u03b3\u2039 is a surjective map, so we also have surjective intertwiners from Va b Vb to Vci . The composition \u03b3\u03b3\u2039 is the identity on Vci whereas the composition \u03b3\n\u2039\u03b3 is a projector defined in the vector space VabVb. An intertwiner from ab b to c has a pictorial description as a triangle, with edges labelled by the irreducible representations a, b and c. These edges are a priori oriented, however Frobenius reciprocity tells us that one can replace a homomorphism to a representation by a homomorphism\nfrom its conjugate representation. In the case of SUp2q, an irreducible representation is equivalent to its conjugate so one may forget about orientation of the edges of the triangle a, b, c and picture intertwiners as triangles with unoriented edges. The above discussion is of course standard. The triangle pa, b, cq is a convenient visualization of the space of intertwiners HomSUp2qpVabVbbVc,Cq, which is 1-dimensional. Intuitively, one can think of this admissible triangle as describing a particular kind of \u201crelation\u201d between three irreducible representations of SUp2q and one can also think of an admissible tetrahedron as describing \u201crelations between relations\u201d, where the four faces of the tetrahedron refer to four compatible intertwiners.\n4.4 From SUp2q to SUpNq, or to G.\nThe SUp2q group (classical or quantum) underlies the various constructions or considerations described previously. For instance, from the very beginning, the edges of the triangles, or of the tetrahedra, are labelled by non-negative integers referring to highest weights of irreducible representations of SUp2q. If one replaces the latter by another simple (or semi-simple) Lie group G, of higher rank, one can of course look for possible generalizations and it is clear that such generalizations should \u201cexist\u201d. The function gonpa, b, cq, classical or quantum, can be seen as a generalization from the 1-simplex to the 2-simplex of the function giving the dimension of an SUp2q irreducible representation (the function dimpaq \u201c a` 1 P N), and the tet function, classical or quantum, as a generalization of the latter to the 3-simplex. The dimension function dim is explicitly known for all irreps of simple Lie groups G, but things get tricky already at the level of the triangle function gon when G is not SUp2q. Indeed, apart from the fact that one can no longer, in general, identify a representation with its conjugate, the spaces of intertwiners HomGpVa b Vb b Vc,Cq, equivalently HomGpVa b Vb, Vcq, are no longer 1-dimensional: multiplicities appear \u2014they are given by the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients in the SUpNq case. In other words, triangles spaces (Homspaces) are not fully specified by a compatible choices of three irreducible representations. From a combinatorial point of view, if G \u201c SUpNq and if the space of intertwiners (for given a, b, c) is of dimension s, one can draw s distinct pictographs (one can use honeycombs, or, equivalently, O-blades or Berenstein-Zelevinsky diagrams), with three external sides labelled by the same triplet pa, b, cq of irreps but differing by their \u201cinner\u201d contents. In the G \u201c SUp2q case one can trade the three \u201cexternal edge variables\u201d pa, b, cq for three \u201cinternal edge variables pm,n, pq as we did in the first section. In the rank 2 case, taking G \u201c SUp3q, there are 2 \u02c6 3 \u201c 6 numerical external edge variables (the components of the three highest weights a, b, c that one can attach to three copies of an A2 Dynkin diagram) but the intertwiners themselves are labelled by 8 non-negative \u2014and non-independent\u2014 integer parameters; using a syzygie relation one can get rid of one non-negative parameter and stay with 7 independent (but not all necessarily positive) parameters. In this SUp3q case the argument of the gon function (or of the CK function in another normalization) cannot be specified by the triplet of irreps pa, b, cq alone, because this argument should also specify the choice of a pictograph (a honeycomb for instance) whose description usually requires one more parameter. Even in the relatively simple situation of SUp3q the gon function is not known explicitly in full generality although several people have worked out explicit expressions for it, using one or another normalization (G. Kuperberg and his student D. Kim (2003), see [18], A. Ocneanu and his student L. Suciu (1997), see [33]), but this was done only for particular families of irreps a, b, c. In the SUp4q case (where one needs 3\u02c63`3 \u201c 12 independent parameters, so 3 more than the components of the three given highest weights), and more generally for SUpNq, N \u0105 3, or for other simple Lie groups, we are not aware of any general explicit result for the triangle function. As for the tetrahedral function (we remind the reader that for G \u201c SUp2q, and in the unitary normalization, it is the usual 6j symbol), the four faces of the tetrahedron should be labelled by appropriate compatible honeycombs fully specifying the triangle spaces under consideration, but even for SUp3q, and apart from very few special cases (low dimension of irreps and no multiplicity) worked out by physicists at the time of the eightfold way, we are not aware of any published general result.\nAppendix: About Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, 3j and 6j symbols\nThe name \u201cClebsch-Gordan coefficients\u201d comes from two 19-th century German mathematicians, A. Clebsch and P. Gordan, who worked on problems of invariant theory. These numbers, in physics, arise in the quantum treatment of angular momentum: the coupling of two spins. In a more general setting, let Vj be the vector space of an irreducible and unitary representation (irreps) of some compact Lie group, the tensor product of two irreps can be decomposed as a sum of irreducible components. An intertwiner being chosen (an equivariant morphism mapping Vj1 b Vj2 to some chosen VJ , see the discussion on Hom-spaces in section 4.3), one can evaluate this morphism on the tensor product of two vectors m1 P Vj1 , m2 P Vj2 and take the inner product of its image with vectors M P VJ , one obtains a number. We now assume that the group is SUp2q. In that case, and for three chosen irreps Vj1 , Vj2 , VJ , such an intertwiner is unique up to a scaling factor (no multiplicity); moreover the labels ji, or J can be chosen as half-integers (spin variables). For vectors mj , or M , belonging to an appropriate normalized basis in the representation spaces, the numbers obtained as before are called Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and denoted ClebschGordanrj1,m1, j2,m2, J,M s or xj1, j2; m1, m2|J, My. Their properties are described in many textbooks, review articles, and encyclopedias. Equivalently one can think of the evaluation as being defined on the vector space Vj1 b Vj2 b VJ , this leads to coefficients called Wigner 3j symbols that are traditionally written using round braces, as below, and look more symmetrical than the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients; the relation between both is as follows:\nxj1, j2; m1, m2|J, My \u201c ? 2J ` 1p\u00b41qj1\u00b4j2`M \u02dc\nj1 j2 J m1 m2 \u00b4M\n\u00b8\n(59)\nThe signifiance of Clebsh-Gordan coefficients in quantum mechanics became clear after the work of Wigner (1927, in German), see the bibliography in [5]; properties and applications of these coefficients, and of 3j symbols, were then studied in many articles and textbooks (among classical textbooks one should certainly mention [35] and [24]).\nThe 6j symbols were introduced by E.P. Wigner in 1940 in his study of the coupling of three angular momenta (spins); this work was published much later ([36], 1965), but the usefulness of these symbols was immediately recognized and their properties discussed in articles and textbooks (again we can mention [24], 1962). It was also observed that the Wigner 6j symbols were simply related to another family of coefficients, the Racah coefficients, that had been defined, differently, by Racah [30], in 1942 (see below). The Wigner 6j symbols are often defined as a sum over a product of four 3j symbols (or four Clebsch-Gordan coefficients), see eq. 60. A standard notation for 6j\u2019s uses curly braces, as on the left hand side of equation 60.\nThe Racah coefficients, introduced in 1942, [30], were defined as a formally infinite sum but for given arguments, only finitely many terms of this sum are nonzero. We do not use this formula in this paper but the interested reader is referred for instance to [40] and references therein. As already mentioned, it was shown long ago that the coefficients defined by the Racah formula are equal (up to a possible sign) to the Wigner 6j symbols.\nWarnings: \u201a Another family of coefficients, the so-called recoupling coefficients, which are sometimes called unitary Racah symbols, frequently appear in the literature, see the discussion after eq. 40. \u201a Still another variant of the 6j symbols, also called by the same name, and sometimes also denoted by curly braces, but differing from the Wigner 6j\u2019s by normalization factors, can often be found, mostly in the mathematical literature. In the few places where both kinds of symbols are used simultaneously, the authors usually call \u201cnormalized 6j symbols\u201d the Wigner ones, i.e. those that are given by eqs. 28 or 60, although, for other people (and for us), the latter are just\u201c6j symbols\u201d. This is a confusing issue which is discussed at the beginning of section 2.2.4.\nAlthough we do not use in this paper the formula expressing Wigner 6j symbols in terms of 3j symbols, we display it below, for the convenience of the reader.\n#\nj1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6\n+ \u201c jk \u00ff\nmk\u201c\u00b4jk k\u201c1,...6\np\u00b41q \u01596 k\u201c1pjk\u00b4mkq\n\u02dc\nj1 j2 j3 \u00b4m1 \u00b4m2 \u00b4m3\n\u00b8\u02dc\nj4 j2 j6 m4 m2 \u00b4m6\n\u00b8\u02dc\nj1 j5 j6 m1 \u00b4m5 m6\n\u00b8\u02dc\nj4 j5 j3 \u00b4m4 m5 m3\n\u00b8\n(60)\nBecause of Kronecker constraints coming from the 3j symbol, m3 \u201c \u00b4pm1`m2q, m6 \u201c pm2`m4q, m5 \u201c m1 `m2 `m4, the previous sum can be written as a sum over three indices only: #\nj1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6\n+ \u201c j1 \u00ff\nm1\u201c\u00b4j1\nj2 \u00ff\nm2\u201c\u00b4j2\nj4 \u00ff\nm4\u201c\u00b4j4\np\u00b41qj1`j2`j3`j4`j5`j6\u00b4m1\u00b42m2\u00b43m4\n\u02dc\nj1 j2 j3 \u00b4m1 \u00b4m2 m1 `m2\n\u00b8\u02dc\nj4 j2 j6 m4 m2 \u00b4m2 \u00b4m4\n\u00b8\u02dc\nj1 j5 j6 m1 \u00b4m1 \u00b4m2 \u00b4m4 m2 `m4\n\u00b8\u02dc\nj4 j5 j3 \u00b4m4 m1 `m2 `m4 \u00b4m1 \u00b4m2\n\u00b8\n(601)\nEquivalently, in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients,\n#\nj1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6\n+ \u201c j1 \u00ff\nm1\u201c\u00b4j1\nj2 \u00ff\nm2\u201c\u00b4j2\nj4 \u00ff\nm4\u201c\u00b4j4\np\u00b41qj1\u00b4j2`j3`j4\u00b4j5`j6\u00b4m1\u00b4m4\np2j3 ` 1qp2j6 ` 1q xj1, j2; \u00b4m1, \u00b4m2 | j3, \u00b4m1 \u00b4m2y\nxj4, j2; m4, m2 | j6, m2 `m4yxj1, j5; m1, \u00b4m1 \u00b4m2 \u00b4m4 | j6, \u00b4m2 \u00b4m4yxj4, j5; \u00b4m4, m1 `m2 `m4 | j3, m1 `m2y\n(602)\nIn order to save space, and also because it is used in the program Mathematica, the display notation for 6j\u2019s using curly braces is often replaced, in the main body of the present article, by the in-line SixJSymbol notation, defined as follows:\nSixJSymbolppj1, j2, j3q, pj4, j5, j6qq \u201c #\nj1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6\n+\n(61)"
