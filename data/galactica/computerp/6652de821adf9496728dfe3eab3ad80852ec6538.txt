conclusion In this paper, a tennis training action analysis model based on GCN is proposed to enhance the HAR accuracy of tennis moves and assist players in effective training. The paper first establishes limb vectors in three-dimensional spatial coordinates and extracts the technical action characteristics of tennis errors based on the distance between the five skeletal joints of the human body. Secondly, the temporal frames of the data are segmented to extract attention, thereby improving the model's ability to capture specific attributes. Additionally, an attention mechanism is developed to incorporate position information into the attention graph, enhancing the model's generalization capability. Experimental results on multiple action datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher HAR accuracy and better recognition results compared to existing approaches. One limitation of this paper is the absence of a coordinated attention structure to capture cross-channel information.
