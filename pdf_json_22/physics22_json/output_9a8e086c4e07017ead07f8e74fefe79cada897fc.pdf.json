The analysis of the cloud structure is performed using the delta-variance spectrum technique. The calculated spectra display a self-similar regime on small scales as well as the presence of a prominent bump on larger scales and whose physical size, Lhub, falls in the range of \u22487000\u201360 000 au. These scales correspond to the sizes of the most compact clumps within the protocluster forming clouds. A significant correlation is found between Lhub and the surface density of the free\u2013free emission estimated from the integrated flux of the H41\u03b1 recombination line ( free\u2013free H41\u03b1 ) as well as a significant anticorrelation between Lhub and the ratio of the 1.3\u20133 mm continuum emission fluxes ( Scloud 1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) . Smaller values of ( Scloud 1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) and larger values of free\u2013free H41\u03b1 correspond to more advanced evolutionary stages of the protocluster forming clumps. Hence, our results suggest that the sizes of the densest regions in the clouds are directly linked to their evolutionary stage and to their star formation activity with more evolved clouds having larger protocluster forming clumps. This is an indication that gravity plays a vital role in regulating the size, mass growth, and star formation activity of these clumps with ongoing gas accretion.",

As massive stars evolve quickly towards the ain sequence, their strong radiation fields and stellar winds further mpact the cloud structure and dynamical state (Gritschneder et al. Gritschneder et al. 2009; Tremblin et al. 2012; Dale et al. 2014; arlsten & Hartigan 2018; Rebolledo et al. 2020; Geen et al. 2021; ayak et al. 2021; Tiwari et al. 2021) In terms of global structure, massive star-forming regions are often bserved to have a hub-filament system architecture (e.g. Elia et al. 018; Dib et al. 2020; Dewangan 2022; Zhou et al. 2022) with ost, if not all protostars residing in the hub substructure (Kumar t al. 2020). In analysing the global morphology of massive starorming regions and particularly of the hub-filament systems, it is ustomary, and often very useful, to decompose the entire structure nto a hub and a series of individual filaments in order to study oth their individual and statistical properties (Kumar et al. 2020). A omplementary approach in which the structure of the star-forming egion as a whole is quantified can help shed light on how the total mission is distributed across different physical scales. In this work, e perform such an analysis on 15 massive star-forming regions in he Milky Way using the 1.3 mm continuum emission maps from he ALMA-IMF project.

The data is presented in Section 2 and he calculation of the -variance is briefly summarized in Section 3. he results and conclusions are presented in Sections 4 and 5, espectively. DATA e used data from the ALMA-IMF1 project which is a large program f the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA; Motte et al. 2022; insburg et al. 2022). The sample consists of 15 massive star-forming egions located at distances between \u22482 and 5.5 kpc and that are in ifferent evolutionary stages. Out of the 15 protocluster regions, six re categorized as being Young (Y), five as Intermediate (I), and our as Evolved (E). This classification in terms of evolutionary tage is based on two criteria which are the 1.3\u20133 mm flux ratio and he free\u2013free emission at the H41\u03b1 frequency of the recombination ine. The adoption of these criteria is based on the assumption that s massive star-forming regions evolve, they will host, statistically, n increasing number of H II regions. As these H II regions expand, heir free\u2013free emission increases. Furthermore, for evolved clouds, he free\u2013free emission dominates at 3 mm, whereas emission at the .3 mm emission is dominated by thermal dust emission. This leads o ratios of the 1.3\u20133 mm emission that decrease as clouds evolve. otte et al. measured the ratio of the 1.3 and 3 mm using the surface rea of the 1.3 mm emission for each cloud ( Scloud1.3mm/S cloud 3mm ) and they lso made an estimate of the surface density of the free\u2013free emission free\u2212freeH41\u03b1 ) . Table 1 lists the values of ( Scloud1.3mm/S cloud 3mm ) and free\u2212freeH41\u03b1 easured by Motte et al. (2022). For each protocluster, the current data products available from\nLMA-IMF are two versions of a 1.3 mm and a 3 mm continuum aps which were obtained using the 12 m array configuration of LMA (Ginsburg et al. 2022). The first version (bsens) is more\nensitive, but is affected by emission lines present in each selected andwidth. The second type of maps (cleanest) are built using the ine-free channels. In this work, we will focus the analysis on the leanest 1.3 mm maps (the image.tt0.pbcor versions). For these maps,\nNRAS 524, 1625\u20131633 (2023)\nhttps://www.almaimf.com/data.html 2\nhe spatial resolution varies from region to region and is in the range f 1350\u20132690 au (see table 5 in Motte et al. 2022). In terms of the umber of pixels, the size in pixels of the ALMA-IMF 1.3 mm maps aries from 882 \u00d7 882 pixels up to 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels, with the ajority of maps having more than 1000 pixels in each direction. The .3 mm maps of two regions from the entire ALMA-IMF sample are isplayed in Fig. 1, namely those of the young region W43-MM1 nd the evolved region G333.60.\nA NA LY SIS: THE -VARI ANCE SPECTRUM\ne quantified the structure of the 1.3 mm maps using the -variance pectrum technique. The method was introduced in Stu\u0308tzki et al. 1998) and Zielinsky & Stu\u0308tzki J. (1999), and is a generalization of he Allan variance (Allan 1966). In this work, we used an improved mplementation of the method presented in Ossenkopf, Krips & tu\u0308tzki (2008a).2 For a 2D field A(x, y), the -variance on a scale L s defined as being the variance of the convolution of A with a filter unction L, such that 2 (L) = 1\n2\u03c0 \u3008(A \u2217 L)2\u3009x,y , (1)\nhere x and y represent the distances on both axes separating the point nder consideration from any other point. For the filter function, ssenkopf, Krips & Stu\u0308tzki (2008a) use a Mexican hat function hich we also adopt here. This is defined as\nL (r) = 4 \u03c0L2 e r2 (L/2)2 \u2212 4 \u03c0L2(v2 \u2212 1)\n[ e r2 (vL/2)2 \u2212 e r2 (L/2)2 ] , (2)\nhere the two terms on the right side of equation (2) represent he core and the annulus of the Mexican hat function, respectively, nd v is the ratio of their diameters (we used a value of v = 1.5) here r = \u221a x2 + y2. For a faster and more efficient computation f equation (1) the calculation is performed as a multiplication in ourier space (Ossenkopf, Krips & Stu\u0308tzki 2008a), and thus, the -variance is given by\n2 (L) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u201c P |\u0304L|2 dkxdky, (3)\nhere P is the power spectrum of A, and \u0304L is the Fourier transform f the filter function. If \u03b2 is the exponent of the power spectrum P(k)\u221dk\u2212\u03b2 , where k = 2\u03c0 /L is the wave number), then a relation xists between the slope of the -variance and \u03b2 (Stu\u0308tzki et al. 998). This is given by\n2 (L) \u221d L\u03b1 \u221d L\u03b2\u22122. (4) The slope of the -variance can be measured from the range f spatial scales over which it displays a self-similar behaviour. It an be related to the value of \u03b2. Characteristic scales are scales at hich there are breaks of the self-similarity and that appear in the -variance plots as break points or inflexion points. The error bars f the -variance are computed from the counting error determined y the finite number of statistically independent measurements in a ltered map and the variance of the variances, that is, the fourth oment of the filtered map. The -variance has been used to nalyse the structure of observed molecular clouds (Bensch, Stu\u0308tzki Ossenkopf 2001; Sun et al. 2006; Ossenkopf, Krips & Stu\u0308tzki 008b; Russeil et al. 2013; Elia et al. 2014; Dib et al. 2020; Schneider t al. 2022) as well the structure of the H I gas in nearby galaxies\nhttps://hera.ph1.uni-koeln.de/\u223cossk/Myself/deltavariance.html\nFigure 1.

In the lower left corner of each figure, the spatial scale corresponding to the value of Lhub is displayed.

However, their counterparts in ATLASGAL follow a mass\u2013size relationship (Csengeri et al. 2017), and one can reasonably expect that a similar law exists for the 1.3 mm maps as seen in the ALMA observations.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1625/7207408 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nElmegreen, Kim & Staveley-Smith 2001; Dib et al. 2021). In olecular clouds, a variety of features can be observed in the - ariance spectrum (Russeil et al. 2013; Elia et al. 2014; Dib et al. 020; Schneider et al. 2022). Low surface-density clouds which are ot forming stars display a self-similar regime which can be described y a single power law while at the other extreme, massive clouds that re intensely forming stars display bumps in their spectra which are ssociated with the existence of characteristic scales of the order f \u22480.8\u20131 pc (Dib et al. 2020). Dib et al. (2020) interpreted this cale as representing the typical size of hubs in hub-filament systems bserved at the resolution of the Herschel satellite. R ESULTS ig. 2 displays the -variance spectra of the 15 regions of the LMA-IMF sample. All spectra are normalized by their mean value. he spectra are split into three sub-groups which represent the rotocluster clouds classified as young, intermediate, and evolved ollowing the classification by Motte et al. (2022). The aim of this egregation is to verify whether the clouds\u2019 evolutionary stage has ny connection to their internal structure. The first noticeable effect s that the spectra of all regions deviate from a single power law hat is observed in low star-forming regions (Dib et al. 2020; Yahia t al. 2021; Schneider et al. 2022). Instead, the -variance spectra f the ALMA-IMF regions resemble those calculated for massive tar-forming regions found at smaller distances and that have been btained using data from the Herschel satellite such as NGC 6334 Russeil et al. 2013), M17 (Schneider et al. 2022), and Cygnus X Dib et al. 2020). The spectra are characterized by the presence of bump on scales that range from several 103 au to several 104 au. ib et al. (2020) presented an extensive suite of tests that shows how he presence of overdense regions on top of a self-similar regime n 2D images leads to the formation of a bump in the -variance pectrum (see figures 6\u20139 in their paper), a result that corroborates imilar findings presented in Elia et al. (2014) and in particular in gure 3 of their paper. Thus, the bumps observed in the -variance pectra of the ALMA-IMF fields are associated with the presence f overdense structures that constitute the central hub(s) of the starorming clouds and such features are not observed in less massive egions, especially those that do not show signs of ongoing star ormation such as the Polaris flare region (Dib et al. 2020). Fig. 2 lso shows that in regions that are classified as intermediate and volved, the peaks of the spectra are present at larger physical scales hat those found in the less evolved, young regions (see Fig. 1 for xamples, and also Table 1 for the Lhub values of the entire sample). arger values of Lhub in evolved regions are a clear indication that assive star-forming regions such as those mapped in the ALMAMF project continue to accrete gas from their surroundings leading hem to become larger and more massive,3 and in turn, this induces tars to form at a higher rate. We now explore the connection between features in the -variance pectrum and the evolutionary criteria ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) and free\u2013freeH41\u03b1 . or each region, we extracted two sets of information from the - ariance spectra. The first one is the slope of the spectra in the elf-similar regime that precedes the bump on the left-hand side f the spectra. As shown in Dib et al. (2020), the self-similar egime in the clouds could be perturbed by the presence of a ump and at the smallest scales, it can be affected by the effects f beam smearing which can extend beyond the actual beam size y a factor of \u22482. We adopted a conservative approach and fit the patial ranges of the spectra that display a clear self-similar regime, voiding perturbed scales at both ends. The ranges over which a ower law is fit to the self-similar regimes are listed in Table 1 long with the derived values of the exponent \u03b1. Fig. 3 displays he values of \u03b1 plotted against the ratio ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3mm ) (left-hand anel) and free\u2013free (right-hand panel).

The vertical arrow in each panel marks the position of the peak in the spectrum. Also shown in each spectrum are the spatial scales corresponding to angular resolutions of 5 arcsec (full brown line), 8 arcsec (full red line), and 12 arcsec (full yellow line). These values bracket the value of the maximum recoverable scale (MRS) which is suspected to fall in this range.\ni r b a s i c t t w 1\n1 r\ne s T w t a A t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1625/7207408 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nncluded as its spectrum does not show the presence of a self-similar egime on spatial scales below the peak. There is no correlation etween \u03b1 and ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) (Spearman \u03c1 coefficient of 0.16) nd between \u03b1 and free\u2013freeH\u03b141 (Spearman \u03c1 coefficient of 0.10). The ignificance of the deviation from zero of these two coefficients s 0.56 and 0.73, respectively, which confirms the absence of any orrelation between \u03b1 and the star formation indicators. We have ested the robustness of this result by varying the ranges over which he power law fit for the self-similar regimes is performed. This as done by shifting the lower and upper bound of the range by 000 au to larger scales, individually or simultaneously. Within the\nNRAS 524, 1625\u20131633 (2023)\n\u03c3 uncertainties, the resulting exponents of the different power laws emain identical.\nIn principle, the position of the peak, Lhub, can be estimated by ye. However, we derived a more accurate estimate of its value with a imple quadratic interpolation using several points around the peak. he values of Lhub are reported in Table 1 and are marked in Fig. 2 ith a downward pointing arrow. There is no correlation between he measured values of Lhub and the distances of the regions that re reported in Motte et al. (2022).

The determined value of Lhub can be compared o the value of the MRS for each field of the ALMA-IMF sample n order to assess whether the measurement of Lhub corresponds to eal dense structures found in the clouds. We refer the reader to the riginal paper by Ginsburg et al. (2022) for a detailed discussion n what could affect the value of the MRS for those regions. The ssessment of Ginsburg et al. (2022) is that the MRS varies from eld-to-field and is difficult to quantify. Judging by the visibility overage of the interferometer in the 12 m configuration, the MRS or these fields are likely to be somewhere between 5 and 12 arcsec. n Fig. 2, we position an MRS of 5 arcsec, 8 arcsec, and 12 arcsec on he -variance spectra in order to assess in how many fields is Lhub arger than any of these assumed MRS values. A visual inspection f Fig. 2 shows that adopting a conservative value of 5 arcsec for the RS for all fields implies that 4\u20135 regions have their corresponding alues of Lhub larger than this value of the MRS. These are G353.41, 43-MM3, G012.080, G333.60, and marginally G337.92. For the ther regions, the values of Lhub are well below 5 arcsec, up to a actor of \u22485 smaller. For an MRS of 8 arcsec, the number of fields or which this is the case is reduced to three (W43-MM3, G012.80, nd G333.60), and for an MRS of 12 arcsec, only two regions have heir values of Lhub coincide with the value of the MRS (G01280 and 333.60). While interferometric observations cause a partial loss of the\nignal on scales larger than the MRS, and the effects of this imming increase with spatial scales that are increasingly larger, his loss of emission on the largest scales does not imply that such arge structures cannot be detected in the -variance spectrum. or dimmed structures to be detected, some conditions have to be ulfilled. The first one is that the large structure should be coherent nough to be recognized as a single structure, even if it contains dense ubstructures (i.e. cores) within it. The second condition is that such arge structures should be sufficiently massive and dense in order o have a relevant contribution for star formation within the cloud. he potential non-detection of large and coherent structures that re already too dim before being filtered out by the interferometer o not impact the correlation between the size of overdense starorming regions and the star formation rate (SFR) indicators. On the ther hand, such large structures that could be filtered out by the nterferometer cannot be as dense as the star-forming clumps such as hose seen in the ALMA-IMF field. The reasoning behind this is that uch large clumps (larger than those currently observed) would host\nlarge number of dense cores with a well-structured geometry and hey should be easily detected. In some of the most evolved regions, his would also imply an increased signature of stellar feedback. n the ALMA-IMF fields, both dense cores and feedback effects re solely observed inside or in close proximity of the presently etected massive clumps. This leaves the possibility of moderately ense clumps that, once dimmed, could potentially appear smaller as nly their denser inner regions are detected above the noise level. In ppendix A, we explore this possibility using simple idealized tests nd show that the entire size of moderately overdense clumps can still e detected in the -variance spectrum even when the clumps are immed by a factor of 75 per cent. This is not a hard limit and the real alue is likely to depend on both the local and global background with espect to the peak densities of the clumps, their size, and density rofiles. For the ALMA-IMF sample, combining images obtained ith the 12 m array with others obtained with the 7 m array can help ecover the entire signal up to larger scales. However, and while bservations do exist with the 7 m array for the ALMA-IMF regions, ombining them with the 12 m array observations has proved to be roblematic for most regions (Ginsburg et al. 2022). An example here the image combination is successful (G328.25, B3 band) is isplayed in fig. H.10 of their paper. In this case, more substructure an be observed in the combined image than in the 12 m image. et, it is evident that the extended large scale substructure is of low ntensity and would not result in any peak the -variance spectrum. urthermore, the size of the overdense clump in G328.25 is also irtually unchanged in the combined image. In Appendix B, we onfirm this conclusion by comparing the -variance spectrum of oth maps. Fig. 4 displays the value of Lhub plotted against the ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm\n) atio (left-hand panel) and free\u2013freeH\u03b141 (right-hand panel). A strong nticorrelation is clearly observed between the ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) ratio nd Lhub (Spearman \u03c1 coefficient of \u22120.62 with a significance for the eviation from zero of 0.012) and a strong correlation is observed etween the latter and free\u2013freeH\u03b141 (Spearman \u03c1 coefficient of 0.53 and significance of deviation from zero of 0.03). In calculating the orrelation coefficient, we have again excluded the G328.25 region s its measured value of Lhub is very close to the resolution limit.\nIf the structures within each cloud were the consequence of comression by turbulent motions that are solely cascading from larger cales, one would expect the values of \u03b1 to be nearly identical among he ALMA-IMF clouds and be independent of the evolutionary stage.\nMNRAS 524, 1625\u20131633 (2023)\nM\nT w t d a & p a s e X l i t a o e L L t\n5\nW c t t b i o t f c( a t f l s e w t a h a c ( t b\nA\nI p a h\nD\nT r\nR\nA B\nB\nB B B B B\nC C\nC\nC\nC\nD D D D D D D\nD\nD D D D D\nE E E F F G\nG G G\nH I K K\nL L L L L\nM M N N O O R R\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/524/2/1625/7207408 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nhis would be particularly the case for the less evolved clouds hich are not affected by stellar feedback emanating from within\nhe dense clumps or from their direct vicinity. Compressive motions ue to feedback can alter the properties of turbulence in some clouds nd alter the clouds structure on small scales (Federrath, Klessen\nSchmidt 2008; Luisi et al. 2021; Bonne et al. 2022). Gravity, articularly around the central regions of the clouds, is likely to be major player in both generating infall-induced turbulence and in haping the clouds\u2019 structure (Dib et al. 2007; Ballesteros-Paredes t al. 2011; Va\u0301zquez-Semadeni, Gonza\u0301lez-Samaniego & Col\u0131\u0301n 2017; u & Lazarian 2020). Thus, the large scatter in the values of \u03b1 is ikely an indication that the self-similar structures that are observed n the 1.3 mm emission maps of most regions are not the result of urbulence cascading from larger scales alone and that it may contain significant contribution from infall motions due to the self-gravity f the clouds as well as from feedback processes in some of the volved clouds. The existence of a significant correlation between hub and ( Scloud1.3 /S cloud 3mm ) and of a significant anticorrelation between\nhub and free\u2212free H\u03b141 also points to a significant role for gravity in driving\nhe growth of the protocluster clump with continued gas accretion.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne calculated the -variance spectra of all 15 protocluster forming louds in the ALMA-IMF survey. The shapes of the spectra resemble hose found earlier for closer massive star-forming regions and all of hem display a perturbed self-similar regime on small scales followed y a prominent bump at larger scales. This feature in the spectra is ndicative of the presence of overdense structures which are the sites f ongoing and future massive star and cluster formation. The sizes of hose regions, Lhub, is correlated with the surface density of the H41\u03b1 ree\u2013free emission and anticorrelated with the ratio of the 1.3\u20133 mm ontinuum emission fluxes ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) . Since smaller values of Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) and larger values of free\u2013freeH41\u03b1 correspond to more dvanced evolutionary stages of the protocluster forming clumps, his indicates that the size of the densest regions in protocluster orming clouds is a direct indicator of its evolutionary stage, with arger clumps being associated with a more advanced evolutionary tage. We do not find any correlation between the value of the xponent of the power law that characterize the self-similar regime ith either free\u2013freeH41\u03b1 or ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) . These results indicate that urbulent motions which would set a self-similar regime in the clouds re not only those inherited by a cascade from larger scales, but ave a significant contribution from gravity-driven turbulence, with potential contribution from feedback effects in the most evolved louds. The correlation between Lhub and evolutionary indicators here the ( Scloud1.3 mm/S cloud 3 mm ) ratio and free\u2013freeH41\u03b1 ) is a clear indication that he densest regions of the clouds are dominated by gravity which must e playing a major role in regulating their size and mass growth.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nthank the referees for useful feedback that helped improve this aper.

As a background, we assume a 1000 \u00d7 1000 pixels fractal rownian motion (fBm) with an exponent of \u03b2 = 2.4 similar to the ne used in Dib et al. (2020). The -variance spectrum of this fBm s a power law with an exponent of \u03b1 = 0.4. In the first instance, e consider a single overdense clump overlayed on top of the same Bm (panel a in Fig. A1). The clump is modelled as a 2D Gaussian ith a density contrast between the peak and the mean value of the ackground of \u03b4c,1 = 12. The standard deviation of the Gaussian in ach direction is \u03c3 1 = 3.3 pixels. The map is scale free, and this lump could be thought of as being representative of some of the ense clumps that are presently detected in the ALMA-IMF fields ith a size of a few arcsec. The -variance spectrum of this map is alculated and displayed in the lower right-hand panel of Fig. A1. he spectrum is divided by that of the fBm in order to clearly identify he signature of the clump. The -variance clearly displays a peak at scale of \u224810 pixels which is \u22483\u03c3 1. We remind that the amplitude f the bump scales as A\u03b42c where A is the surface area of the clump r collective surface if several clumps are present (see Dib et al. 020). As such, a clump that is two times brighter will create a more rominent bump for a given size than a clump that is two times larger t the same level of brightness.\nWe would like to test the situation when a second, larger clump r structure exists in the map alongside the first one. Translating in erms of the ALMA-IMF images, and as explained in Section 4, the econd clump cannot be denser or as dense as the first clump that are resently detected. This is because such a bright large clump would ave been selected as the primary target of the observations (and not he smaller clump), and secondly and most importantly, the existence f such a large bright clump implies the observations of many dense ores that are spatially correlated on a spatial area that is much larger han what is presently observed since dense cores cannot be filtered ut by the interferometric observations. In contrast, large dim clouds ith a contrast that is a few per cent or a few tens of percent above the lobal background (i.e. \u03b4c,2 < 2) are not extremely interesting, even\nhough they are likely to be present in all maps (see Appendix B). lbeit these dim large clumps are likely to be filtered out in the 12 m onfiguration observations, their detection, or lack of it, is unlikely o affect the position of the peak since they do not create substantial ariance on the map on their physical scale.\nThe remaining possibility is the existence of large structures of ntermediate brightness (\u03b4c > 2 but smaller than \u03b4c,1). By varying the urface area of the second clump and its \u03b4c, we consider a second lump that will have a bump in the -variance spectra that is lower han the first clump. However, this case, although likely close to eality (see Appendix B) the -variance of the Cygnus-North region n Dib et al. (2020) is not informative since we are assuming already hat the peak corresponds to the size of the first clump. Instead, we onsider a \u2018problematic\u2019 case in which the amplitude of the second lump is larger than that of the first one by carefully selecting its urface and value of \u03b4c,2 and ask the question whether this second lump can still be detected as a second bump in the -variance pectrum even when its amplitude is reduced and falls below that of he first clump. We consider a second clump with a density contrast of c,2 = 4 between its peak value and the mean value of the background. he second clump is also modelled as a 2D Gaussian with a standard eviation of \u03c3 2 = 30 pixels in both directions (panel b in Fig. A1). he -variance spectrum corresponding to this situation is displayed n the lower right-hand panel of Fig. A1. The -variance spectrum learly displays two separate peaks that correspond to the smaller lump as well as the less dense larger clump. The peaks correspond o the full size of the clumps. We now attenuate the emission of he larger clump by 25, 50, and 75 per cent from its original value panels c, d, and e, respectively). For simplicity, large scale structures ound in the underlying fBm are not dimmed as these are already f lower intensity than both clumps. The corresponding -variance or these cases are again displayed in the lower right-hand panel f Fig. A1. With an increased dimming of the large clump, the mplitude of the corresponding bump it generates in the -variance pectrum is reduced. However, it can still be measured accurately ven when the amplitude of the 2D Gaussian is reduced by 75 per ent from its original value. In this case, the 75 per cent threshold orresponds to a peak emission of the 2D Gaussian of the large clump hat is equal to one time the average density of the background. elow this value, the second peak corresponding to the large clump s blurred with the background. This is however not a hard limit, and he threshold could be either lower or higher, depending on a number actors such as the size of the clump, its density profile, and the mission levels of the local background. The idealized test presented ere shows that while interferometric observations may decrease the mplitude of clumps or structures of intermediate brightness, their etection and the measurement of their size is still possible, even hen being partially filtered out. In the -variance spectra of the ifferent ALMA-IMF regions, it is not obvious at all that we can ee any secondary peak apart from that associated with the main lump. This implies that the largest structures that exist in the maps re already dim (\u03b4c < 2 or less) as is exemplified by the case of he G328.25 region for which a merged image from the 12 and 7 m onfiguration exists and in which flux is recovered for spatial scales hat are larger than those of the 12 m map alone, and as is observed n the Herschel satellite images in which no flux is lost at large scales e.g. Kumar et al. 2020).\nMNRAS 524, 1625\u20131633 (2023)\nMNRAS 524, 1625\u20131633 (2023)\nFigure A1. 2D Gaussian structures injected on top of an fBm image with \u03b2 = 2.4.

They also discuss how the combination f the 12 and 7 m images increases the noise levels. They succeeded n deriving such a map only for one region and one band, namely the mm band of G328.25 (fig.

The comparison of the two spectra onfirms what is observed in the combined image, namely that there re some larger structures present in the map. These structures are of ntermediate size (i.e. a few times larger than the central clump), and f low mean emission. This translates in the -variance spectrum into ore variance at around these scales, resulting in a wider spectrum han that corresponding to the 12 m case. However, what can also e observed is that the position of the peak is roughly the same in oth cases and it only shifts by about 50 per cent to larger values, amely from around \u22481000\u20131500 au. What is also important to note s that since the noise levels are higher in the combined image, this eads to a -variance spectrum with larger error bars. In the absence f combined images for the other regions, it is difficult to ascertain hether variations in the positions of the peak in the -variance pectrum will be of the same order in other regions.
