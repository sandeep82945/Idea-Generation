The abietane diterpenoids ferruginol (1), tanshinone IIA (3), and carnosol (4) are wellknown for their interesting pharmacological properties, including antitumor, similar to other natural and semisynthetic abietanes. In this study, a pair of semisynthetic C18-functionalized analogues of 3 and 4 were prepared from the commercially available (+)-dehydroabietylamine or readily obtained methyl dehydroabietate. Semisynthetic ferruginol (1) and some selected analogues, together with the synthesized analogues, were tested in vitro for the inhibition of proliferation in four breast cancer cell lines, SUM149, MDA-MB231, T47D, and MCF07. As a result, several tested abietane analogues decreased cell proliferation and enhanced cell death, with IC50 in the range 1.3–18.7 μM. This work demonstrates the antitumor activities of two tested compounds, making these molecules interesting for the development of new anticancer agents. 1. conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated that readily accessible tanshinone and carnosol analogues are endowed with relevant anti-breast cancer properties, especially in the TNBC models. They are accessed in short synthetic sequences at 30–50% overall yield from either the easily available methyl dehydroabietate or the commercial (+)-dehydroabietylamine. Methyl dehydroabietate is obtained from commercial chiral (–)-abietic acid via methylation and aromatization [14].
