    "abstractText": "Amputation is an irreversible, last-line treatment indicated for a multitude of medical problems. Delaying amputation in favor of limb-sparing treatment may lead to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. This systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on how ML is being applied to predict amputation as an outcome. OVID Embase, OVID Medline, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore were searched from inception to March 5, 2023. 1376 studies were screened; 15 articles were included. In the diabetic population, models ranged from sub-optimal to excellent performance (AUC: 0.6\u20130.94). In trauma patients, models had strong to excellent performance (AUC: 0.88\u20130.95). In patients who received amputation secondary to other etiologies (e.g.: burns and peripheral vascular disease), models had similar performance (AUC: 0.81\u20131.0). Many studies were found to have a high PROBAST risk of bias, most often due to small sample sizes. In conclusion, multiple machine learning models have been successfully developed that have the potential to be superior to traditional modeling techniques and prospective clinical judgment in predicting amputation. Further research is needed to overcome the limitations of current studies and to bring applicability to a clinical setting.",

Delaying amputation in favor of limb-sparing treatment may lead to increased risk of morbidity and mortality [2]. On the other hand, due to the life-altering course of amputation, patients can experience a variety of complications, such as various psychological morbidities [3], phantom limb pain [4], and changes to patient self-esteem [3], following amputation [3, 5]. Patient quality of life is often severely decreased due to unique challenges related to mobility, social isolation, reduced energy, pain, sleep and emotional disturbance [6]. Given the substantial burden that can follow amputation, it is important for patients and providers to be aware of the likelihood of this outcome as early as possible to accept this inevitability, and to prevent undue morbidity and\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293684 November 7, 2023 1 / 12\na1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Yao PF, Diao YD, McMullen EP, Manka M, Murphy J, Lin C (2023) Predicting amputation using machine learning: A systematic review.

Determining the likelihood of amputation can help patients understand the importance of prophylactic changes that may help the patient avoid amputation.\nDespite existing tools such as the Mangled Extremity Severity Score, accurately predicting\namputation as an outcome is still a troublesome dilemma in many cases [8]. Correctly identifying the need for amputation throughout a patient\u2019s disease course can improve outcomes, such as fewer postoperative complications (e.g.: decreased length of stay in hospital, fewer local ipsilateral limb complications while in hospital and fewer instances of unplanned revisions) [9]. Earlier identification of the need for amputation would also allow for a longer period of time to implement preoperative rehabilitation programs which could further improve postoperative outcomes [10]. There is also evidence to suggest that earlier identification can lead to a larger number of patients using prosthetics, and fewer ipsilateral leg complications that can worsen prosthetic use as well as worsen rehabilitation outcomes [11, 12]. Lastly, earlier prediction of amputation can aid multidisciplinary teams in providing emotional and psychological support well before the patient may receive surgery, thereby improving patient perception of the treatment decision [13]. Early prediction of amputation would ultimately allow patients to feel more involved with their decision-making process, which, in a systematic review, was found to lead to a better patient treatment experience [14].\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is defined as a \u201cmachine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments\u201d [15]. These objectives are accomplished through having the AI \u201clearn\u201d, from datasets, the relationships that exists within the data. For instance, AI could review a dataset containing patient factors (e.g.: genetics, environment, patient vitals) and clinical outcomes, learn the relationships that exist, and use this information to predict future outcome in similar patients [16]. In a medical context, AI has been touted to be used in conjunction with electronic medical records (EMR) to help make medical predictions [17\u201319]. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses prediction models and algorithms to analyze and draw inferences from patterns of data to learn or adapt. Machine learning is currently being used in a variety of ways ancillary to amputation, most of which have focused on patient outcomes after amputation [20\u201322]. There remains a gap in the literature about how ML has been applied to patient populations that may require amputation. This systematic review synthesized the literature to assess the status of ML with respect to prediction of amputation as an outcome."

Only five of the included studies [27, 28, 32, 33, 35] could be classified as low risk of bias according to the PROBAST Risk of Bias assessment tool. Within these studies, a history of amputation, age, and diabetic complications such as peripheral vascular disease or kidney complications were features that appeared useful in more than one of the models for prediction of amputation. One study [27] was rated as having an unclear risk of outcome due to the use of basket error rate as the sole performance metric as well as having unclear methodology in derivation and validation of their model."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Amputation is a life-altering, but often necessary procedure resulting from consequences associated with conditions such as diabetes or limb trauma. Proper early identification of the need to amputate can help mitigate negative outcomes associated with amputation [2], and provide patients with the appropriate time to prepare for the potential physical and emotional or psychological complications that can follow the intervention [2, 3, 5, 6]. Earlier work has used AI and ML to make medical predictions, including predicting outcomes following amputation. Researchers have also been attempting to create ML models to predict factors associated with the outcome of amputation. It is difficult to understand the potential use of ML in predicting amputation as an outcome, as there has been no published review of these studies until now. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the available literature using ML to predict amputation. Results demonstrated the potential for ML to predict amputation as an outcome across multiple different target populations. Most of the studies in this review were able to produce predictive models with good performance, with some demonstrating improved sensitivity and specificity compared to non-ML prediction models or clinical decision-making tools. In addition, Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Jime\u0301nez et al. showed comparability to clinical decision-making in a prospective setting, a requirement for the future implementation of ML in medicine [34]. Collectively, the results of this review showcase the viability of ML modeling in creating predictions for amputation. These models could be used to accurately forecast the clinical course of a patient and inform clinicians on personalized treatment plans including interventional or prophylactic changes.\nDespite the promising nature of the results, there are several limitations that should be\nconsidered. The first of these arises from the review process itself. Only full-text, peer-reviewed articles published in English were included in this study. This likely resulted in an overrepresentation of research from primarily English-speaking countries. Furthermore, there are limitations to the studies themselves. The results demonstrate heterogeneity between the features that were important to predict amputation. This could be due to the variance in the data fields between the datasets, the discrepancies between each modeling technique, the intrinsic reliability of the models themselves, or any combination of these factors. Many of the datasets that were used for derivation were pre-existing databases, therefore restricting the variables that could be collected and analyzed between models. In addition, many of the studies discussed the database fields\u2019 restrictions, arguing that the granularity within variables such as surgery outcomes and the severity of disease or injuries can be limiting in many of the datasets [31, 33, 35]. The inconsistency between database variable recording can therefore alter the impact these features could have between models or if they were to feature in a model at all. Taken together, these variations limit the confidence that can be placed in any trends or correlations that may be observed in important features across models and studies. Furthermore, despite the independent models demonstrating positive numbers, one cannot synthesize a summative conclusion from their amalgamation. The non-uniformity in outcomes such as the window of consideration for the outcomes limits the ability to compare [30, 31]. In addition, the applicability to the study population was variable across studies, with some studies deriving their models from a cohort sharing a specific trait that would limit generalizability to the other patient populations [28, 32, 33], and others limited by having no external validation [27, 28, 32, 34]. Lastly, a large number of the studies had a high risk of bias owing to small sample sizes [25, 26, 30, 31, 40, 41], therefore resulting in the need for further validation both internally and externally.\nGiven the current work done with ML and amputations, the results show the potential for\nML to be clinically impactful. Although some authors provided online tools produced from their models [30, 37], the overall reliable application of the current models studied is limited.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293684 November 7, 2023 8 / 12\nIncreasing the breadth of data collected and standardizing the outcome measures would help to mitigate the heterogeneity seen across variables considered between models. Ultimately, despite the evidence that these models can be developed to accurately predict outcomes, for these models to build credibility, more studies that have a low risk of bias must be produced. These then need to be taken into clinical settings to study the validity and utility of these models or tools in each cohort. Lastly, future research that investigates the outcomes of change in management in cohorts applying ML based risk stratification should be pursued. The results of interventions such as increased surveillance and education in patients who are classified as higher risk for amputation should be clarified to understand the true extent of the impact that predicting amputation early will have.\nIn conclusion, this systematic review shows that multiple ML models with various target\npopulations have been successfully derived that have the potential to be superior to traditional modeling techniques and comparable to prospective clinical judgment. Despite existing clinical decision-making tools, being able to accurately predict amputation as an outcome is a clinical question that has yet to be conclusively answered. There is notable interest in the applications of AI in this area, a body of research growing particularly in the last decade. Despite the promise, there are several limitations stalling the growth of these modeling technologies in a clinical context including heterogeneity between database variables and therefore model features, and bias or lack of applicability in the derivation and validation of the models themselves. Although clinical decision making tools based on these models are starting to be created, future research is needed that includes more robust databases designed to validate ML models against external cohorts in order to confidently apply this technology in clinical settings."
