    "abstractText": "Background Viral acute respiratory illnesses (viral ARIs) contribute significantly to human morbidity and mortality worldwide, but their successful treatment requires timely diagnosis of viral etiology, which is complicated by overlap in clinical presentation with the non\u2010viral ARIs. Multiple pandemics in the twenty\u2010first century to date have further highlighted the unmet need for effective monitoring of clinically relevant emerging viruses. Recent studies have iden\u2010 tified conserved host response to viral infections in the blood. Methods We hypothesize that a similarly conserved host response in nasal samples can be utilized for diagnosis and to rule out viral infection in symptomatic patients when current diagnostic tests are negative. Using a multi\u2010 cohort analysis framework, we analyzed 1555 nasal samples across 10 independent cohorts dividing them into train\u2010 ing and validation. Results Using six of the datasets for training, we identified 119 genes that are consistently differentially expressed in viral ARI patients (N = 236) compared to healthy controls (N = 146) and further down\u2010selected 33 genes for classifier development. The resulting locked logistic regression\u2010based classifier using the 33\u2010mRNAs had AUC of 0.94 and 0.89 in the six training and four validation datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we found that although trained on healthy controls only, in the four validation datasets, the 33\u2010mRNA classifier distinguished viral ARI from both healthy or non\u2010 viral ARI samples with > 80% specificity and sensitivity, irrespective of age, viral type, and viral load. Single\u2010cell RNA\u2010sequencing data showed that the 33\u2010mRNA signature is dominated by macrophages and neutrophils in nasal",

Using a multi\u2011 cohort analysis framework, we analyzed 1555 nasal samples across 10 independent cohorts dividing them into train\u2011 ing and validation.\nResults Using six of the datasets for training, we identified 119 genes that are consistently differentially expressed in viral ARI patients (N = 236) compared to healthy controls (N = 146) and further down\u2011selected 33 genes for classifier development. The resulting locked logistic regression\u2011based classifier using the 33\u2011mRNAs had AUC of 0.94 and 0.89 in the six training and four validation datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we found that although trained on healthy controls only, in the four validation datasets, the 33\u2011mRNA classifier distinguished viral ARI from both healthy or non\u2011 viral ARI samples with > 80% specificity and sensitivity, irrespective of age, viral type, and viral load. Single\u2011cell RNA\u2011sequencing data showed that the 33\u2011mRNA signature is dominated by macrophages and neutrophils in nasal samples.\nConclusion This proof\u2011of\u2011concept signature has potential to be adapted as a clinical point\u2011of\u2011care test (\u2018RespVerity\u2019) to improve the diagnosis of viral ARIs.\n\u2020Rushika Pandya and Yudong D.

            "text": "Acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) significantly contribute to human mortality. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, ARIs caused more than 2 million deaths annually and were the sixth major cause of mortality for all ages [1, 2]. Viral infections are a common cause of ARIs and require different treatment than non-viral ARIs. Typically, nasal samples of ARI patients are routinely screened for a predetermined set of common viruses [3, 4]. However, the sensitivity of nasal swab-based diagnostic tests varies widely as has been demonstrated repeatedly for multiple viruses including influenza [5] and SARS-CoV-2 [6\u20139], which allow ruling in, but not ruling out viral infections. Furthermore, the multiple pandemics of the twenty-first century, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have demonstrated that the current practice of using a predetermined set of viruses severely limits our ability to detect clinically relevant emerging pathogens in a timely manner [5]. Although metagenomic sequencing can identify novel viruses in pooled human samples [8\u2013 11], identification of a pathogen in human meta-samples does not directly translate into a health risk. There is an unmet need for novel diagnostics that can enable ruling out viral infection with higher confidence and identify patients with emerging viral infections of clinical relevance.\nRecent studies have repeatedly highlighted the utility of host response-based diagnostics in addressing these challenges, and multiple host response-based tests are in late development [12\u201315]. Importantly, the host response to viral infection in peripheral blood is conserved and can distinguish it from other inflammatory conditions. For example, we have demonstrated that host response-based gene signature in peripheral blood, identified using known respiratory viral infections [16], is also conserved in emerging viruses, including SARSCoV-2, chikungunya, and Ebola, and is associated with the severity of viral infections [17]. Similarly, Mick et\u00a0al. described a conserved host response to viral infection in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs that is distinct from patients with other ARIs [18]. A recent pathogen surveillance and detection study demonstrated that in symptomatic patients, who tested negative for a panel of respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR but had higher levels of cytokines in nasal samples, host response in nasopharyngeal swab identified clinically relevant infection in 75% of samples, of which > 35% of patients had acute viral infection [19]. These results suggest that similar to blood-based host response diagnostics, conserved host response to viral infections in nasal samples can also be utilized for diagnosis and to rule in or rule out viral infection in symptomatic patients when targeted pathogen-diagnostic tests are negative. Nasal samples also have\ncertain advantages over blood samples. First, nasal samples are easy to obtain and routinely obtained in clinical practice. Second, measuring host response in the respiratory tract could enable earlier detection of viral infection.\nSeveral studies have profiled host response in nasal samples to identify gene sets for diagnosis of viral infection. However, none have been shown to generalize to broad populations [20\u201325]. One of the important factors limiting the translation to clinical practice is the lack of heterogeneity within cohorts from which these genes were identified, which do not generalize to the real-world patient population. Using a multi-cohort analysis framework [26, 27], we have repeatedly demonstrated that leveraging biological, technical, and clinical heterogeneity across diverse cohorts can identify robust host response changes in patients with infections that can be translated to clinical tests [14, 28]. For instance, we have successfully applied multi-cohort analysis to develop a clinically useful blood-based classifier that reliably distinguishes between viral and bacterial infections [29\u201331].\nWe hypothesized that multi-cohort analysis of whole transcriptome profiles from nasal samples of patients with or without viral infection can identify a robust nasal host response gene expression signature broadly conserved across populations that could be translated to clinical use. We applied multi-cohort analysis to transcriptome profiles of 1555 nasal samples available across 10 public datasets. We identify a conserved host response gene signature that distinguishes viral ARI samples from either healthy controls or non-viral ARIs with high accuracy. We found that the host response is robust to demographic and clinical variables such as age, virus type, or viral load and believe that these results provide a solid foundation for diagnostic test development."

The voom method (limma R package) was then used to transform counts into normalized log2CPM. Two studies, GSE188678 and GSE156063, were published by the same authors.

Forward search often results in a small set of several genes that retains the performance of the entire set. However, one of the pitfalls of any forward search is the dependence on starting point and potential overfitting to the particular set of training datasets. Therefore, here, we explored a modified forward search where we use multiple starting points\u2014specifically we chose 12 genes (top 10%) with maximum absolute pooled effect size in training sets and used each one of those in a separate forward search run.

In short, HC samples from each platform undergo ComBat co-normalization without covariates. The co-normalized discovery data, comprising 6 training datasets a total of 382 samples, was used for training the LOGR model using IML. The training procedure comprised 1000 hyperparameter searches based on machine learning best practices. Furthermore, we used the 33 mRNAs post co-normalization to train the model.

These 10 datasets enrolled infants, children, and adults with viral ARI or non-viral ARI across 5 countries (Table\u00a0 1, Methods). Patients with non-viral ARI included those with bacterial pneumonia and non-infectious pulmonary conditions. Collectively, these datasets represented a broad spectrum of biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity representative of the real-world patient population.\nWe chose 6 out of the 10 datasets as \u201cdiscovery\u201d datasets. The discovery datasets comprised 382 samples (236 viral ARI and 146 HCs). The remaining 4 datasets comprised 1173 samples (857 viral ARI, 251 non-viral ARI, and 65 HCs) were used for \u201cvalidation\u201d (Table\u00a0 1). Our choice for using 6 datasets for discovery was based on three reasons. First, we have previously demonstrated that using 4\u20135 datasets comprising approximately 250\u2013 300 samples provides sufficient statistical power to detect differential expression even with higher between-dataset heterogeneity [26]. We had > 80% statistical power for detecting absolute effect size (ES) > 0.55 at a p-value of 0.05 even with high between-dataset heterogeneity (Additional file\u00a0 1: Figure S1) [47]. Second, this division into discovery and validation datasets allowed us to use a larger number of samples with more clinical heterogeneity for validation while maintaining sufficient statistical power for discovery. Third, these 6 datasets represented broad biological (virus types and strains, age, sex), clinical (patient populations from 5 countries, severity), and technical heterogeneity (gene expression profiling platforms) to ensure the discovery of a robust gene signature (Table\u00a0 1). However, the discovery datasets did not include any samples from patients with non-viral ARI. All datasets that included non-viral ARI patients were used as validation to ensure a more heterogeneous control population in the validation datasets. Using a higher number of samples with more clinical heterogeneity (i.e., patients with non-viral ARI) for validation provides strong evidence that our signature is not overfitted and is robust to the unseen clinical heterogeneity of the realworld patient population.\n119\u00a0genes are consistently differentially expressed in\u00a0viral"

While we note that many sub-combinations of the differentially expressed genes could be optimized for diagnosis, we have previously described a greedy forward search [15] to iteratively (\u201cMethods\u201d) identify a smaller number of genes that can be translated into a point-of-care test. Our greedy forward search identified a 33-mRNA signature (24 over-expressed, 9 underexpressed) that was consistently differentially expressed\nin patients with viral ARI from HCs in the discovery datasets and from HCs and patients with non-viral ARI in validation datasets (\u201cMethods\u201d; Table\u00a0 S1 and Additional file\u00a01: Figure S2).\nMyeloid cells are the\u00a0primary source of\u00a0the\u00a033\u2011mRNA signature We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles of 43,814 cells from nasal samples of 78 individuals (55 viral infections, 23 HCs) reported in two independent cohorts (SCP1289 [48] and GSE176269 [44]) to identify the cell types that express the 33 genes. Specifically, GSE176269 profiled 18,913 cells from nasal wash samples from 20 individuals (6 SARS-COV-2, 8 influenza A, and 6 HCs). The other dataset, SCP1289, profiled 24,901 cells from nasopharyngeal samples from 58 individuals (35 SARS-CoV-2 patients, 6 respiratory failure patients, and 17 HCs). Because of the differences in sample types (nasopharyngeal vs nasal wash), we did not integrate both studies into a single dataset.\nVisualization using UMAP showed that the largest variation was by cell type (Fig.\u00a02A) followed by the infection status (Fig.\u00a0 2B) and severity (Fig.\u00a0 2C). We defined the 33-mRNA signature score of a cell as the difference between the geometric mean of 24 over-expressed genes and that of 9 under-expressed genes. Macrophages and\nneutrophils had the highest scores (Fig.\u00a02D) and pseudobulk analysis (\u201cMethods\u201d) showed that the 33-mRNA scores were significantly higher in macrophages from patients with viral ARI (Fig.\u00a0 2E), but not in the other cell types. These results are in line with the conserved host response to viral infection in blood [17] and provide further evidence that myeloid cells are also the primary source of the conserved host response at the site of infection. Importantly, we found that proportions of macrophages increased with the severity of viral ARI (Fig.\u00a02F), but there was no association between the 33-mRNA score at the single-cell level and the severity of viral ARI (Fig.\u00a0 2G), further suggesting that increased 33-mRNA score is due to the change in the proportion of macrophages in the respiratory tract.\nThe 33\u2011mRNA score distinguishes patients with\u00a0viral ARI from\u00a0those with\u00a0non\u2011viral ARI and\u00a0healthy controls Similar to the 33-mRNA score for a single cell, we defined a sample-level 33-mRNA score as the difference between the geometric mean of the overexpressed genes and that of the under-expressed genes in all cells attributed to a particular sample. As expected, samplelevel 33-mRNA scores for patients with viral ARI were\nsignificantly higher than those for HCs in the discovery datasets for pediatric and adult patients (p < 3e \u2212 04; Fig.\u00a0 3A). More importantly, three validation datasets included patients with non-viral ARI. In these datasets, the 33-mRNA scores for patients with viral ARI were significantly higher than those for HCs and patients with non-viral ARI (p < 3e \u2212 14; Fig.\u00a03A\u2013B), although samples from non-viral ARI patients were not used to identify the 33-mRNA signature. In one study, GSE163151, where both healthy and non-viral ARI samples were present, 33-mRNA scores did not differ between the two control groups (Fig.\u00a0 3B). These results further underscore the generalizability and specificity of the 33-mRNA to distinguish patients with viral ARI from HCs or patients with non-viral ARI.\nThe 33\u2011mRNA score is\u00a0not\u00a0confounded by\u00a0age or\u00a0viral type and\u00a0is\u00a0correlated with\u00a0viral load Multiple studies have described differences in immune response in children and adults [35, 49]. Therefore, we investigated whether age has any impact on the 33-mRNA signature. As expected, the 33-mRNA score was significantly higher in children and adults with viral ARI compared to healthy controls in the\ndiscovery datasets. However, there was no difference in the 33-mRNA scores between children and adults with viral ARI (Fig.\u00a03A). Furthermore, linear regression model using viral ARI, age, and sex as independent variables found that only infection status was significantly associated with the 33-mRNA score (p < 2e \u2212 16), whereas age and sex were not associated with 33-mRNA scores (p > 0.11). We also examined the effects of sex and age by study and found no significant correlation between 33-mRNA score and either sex (Additional file\u00a0 1: Figure S3) or age (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S4) in any of the 8 studies where age and sex information was available. However, we note that > 85% of the samples in the discovery datasets were from infants and children, whereas the validation datasets were comprised exclusively of adults (Table\u00a0 1). Hence, although our results strongly suggest that our multi-cohort analysis identified the host response to viral infections in the nasal mucosa that is conserved across different age groups, it should be further validated in pediatric cohorts.\nNext, we investigated whether the 33-mRNA signature is impacted by the type or load of viral infection. GSE163151 included samples from multiple viral infections whereas GSE152075 and GSE188678\nincluded samples with a range of viral loads. We did not observe a significant effect of the type of virus on the 33-mRNA score across all 8 types of viruses contained in GSE163151 (Fig.\u00a0 3B). Notably, the 33-mRNA score was significantly higher in patients with a high viral load than those with a low viral load in GSE152075 (p = 3e \u2212 04) and GSE188678 (p = 0.017) (Fig.\u00a0 3C\u2013D). These results suggest that 33-mRNA is not affected by a type of virus and correlated with viral load in the respiratory tract. Together, our analysis strongly suggests that 33-mRNA is likely to be generalizable in clinical settings regardless of the viral type and loads.\nThe locked 33\u2011mRNA logistic regression\u2011based classifier generalizes to\u00a0new datasets with\u00a0high accuracy Clinical translation of a diagnostic signature requires a locked classification model that can be applied to new datasets without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. The generalizability of the 33-mRNA signature across datasets despite the presence of biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity strongly suggests that it is a reasonable candidate for creating such a classifier. We used our previously described Inflammatix Machine Learning (IML) platform [31] to develop a logistic regression\n(LOGR)-based classifier using the discovery datasets, which classified patients with viral ARI from HCs with summary AUROC of 0.94 (range: 0.85\u20131.00; Fig.\u00a0 4A). Next, we applied this LOGR classifier \u201cas is\u201d (i.e., locked without any modifications) to the four validation datasets previously unseen to the model. We note that the validation datasets were not co-normalized with the discovery datasets or with each other. The locked 33-mRNA LOGR classifier had a summary AUROC of 0.89 (range: 0.84\u2013 0.97) in the four validation datasets (Fig.\u00a04B). At the optimal Youden threshold, the locked LOGR classifier had 82.87% sensitivity and 82.4% specificity for the diagnosis of viral ARI in the validation datasets. Taken together, these results highlight the robustness and generalizability of the 33-mRNA signature for future diagnostic development."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first multi-cohort analysis of host response in nasal swab samples across viral ARIs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential for clinical development of a host response gene expression signature that identifies viral ARIs in real-world clinical settings. To this end, we applied a multicohort analysis approach to 1555 samples from 10 publicly available datasets, dividing them into discovery and validation groups. We identified a 33-mRNA signature in nasal samples that distinguished viral ARI with AUC > 0.9 in both discovery\nand validation datasets. We showed that the 33-mRNA signature generalizes to multiple viruses and is robust to biological heterogeneity such as viral type or load in the real-world patient population.\nA diagnostic test for viral ARIs must be robust to clinical heterogeneity. Specifically, it should be able to differentiate patients with viral ARIs from those who present with similar symptoms but have non-viral ARIs to generalize to real-world settings where viral types and loads are highly variable. Using a large number of samples (427 viral ARI, 251 non-viral ARI) across three independent validation cohorts, we showed that although we identified the 33 mRNAs using HCs, the model also distinguished patients with viral ARI from those with non-viral ARI with > 80% sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, one of the validation datasets, GSE156063, included non-viral ARI samples from patients with bacterial pneumonia as well as non-infectious lung and airway conditions but did not provide patient-level information. In GSE156063, the 33-mRNA score had an AUROC of 0.84, which further demonstrates its robustness to clinical heterogeneity in diagnosing viral ARIs. In addition, three datasets (GSE163151, GSE152075, and GSE188678) provided information about virus type and viral load. The 33-mRNA model had high accuracy for diagnosis regardless of virus type (AUC = 0.92) and viral load (AUCs = 0.97 and 0.84).\nAccurate and timely determination of broad sources of infection in ARI patients would expedite proper care, minimize unnecessary use of antibiotics, and ultimately save lives. It would also provide a path forward for monitoring clinically relevant emerging viruses. Such a test, in conjunction with negative results from viral screening panels and clinical presentation, would identify the samples that are likely to harbor unidentified viruses posing a health risk and thus warranting further interrogation. In fact, given the recent technological advances, it would be possible to integrate the 33-mRNA signature with viral screening panels as a single diagnostic test. Such integration would also allow confidently ruling out viral infection in patients who tested negative for a panel of respiratory viruses and do not show the presence of host response to viral infections.\nCytokine-mediated response and inflammation play a significant role in defense against a viral infection [50, 51]. For example, Yu et\u00a0al. have noted a strong type I interferon response in the nasal transcriptome of patients with viral ARI [22]. Studies by Landry et\u00a0al. and Cheemarla et\u00a0al. also demonstrated upregulation of interferon induced cytokines in nasopharyngeal samples of patients with viral infection, both at mRNA and protein levels. Consistent with previous studies, our pathways enrichment analysis of the 119 genes highlights defense response to viruses, regulation of innate immunity, and response to type I interferon [19, 25]. The most upregulated genes in our metanalysis, such as ISG15, various IFI genes, and RSAD2 (Table S1) are also all known interferon-induced genes. Consistently, many of the selected 33 mRNAs are also interferoninduced. Examination of scRNA-seq studies provides further evidence that the 33-mRNA signature reflects changes in both myeloid cell expression and composition, particularly an increase in macrophage fractions as well as cellular changes in both macrophage and neutrophil expression. Indeed, CD163, a monocyte and macrophage-specific gene, is also part of the 33-mRNA signature. Collectively, these results are in line with previous studies that conserved host response to viral infection is dominated by myeloid cells [17].\nPrevious studies have suggested that epithelial cells make a major contribution to the early host response to viral infection [22, 48]. For example, Ziegler et\u00a0 al. described a very strong epithelial cell response, with myeloid cells playing a relatively larger role in very severe COVID. However, our 33-mRNA signature is preferentially expressed in myeloid cells. This discrepancy raises the question of whether the 33-mRNA signature might be biased against the epithelial cell response, and if so, would this cause it to lose sensitivity for early infections and/or infections\nof mild-moderate severity. We note that the 33-mRNA signature was derived from datasets that included the entire gamut of cells present in the nasal wash and swab samples, including epithelial cells. Because the multicohort analysis framework, MetaIntegrator, used in our analysis prioritizes consistency of expression despite the biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity across datasets, it is very likely that the 33-mRNA signature emerged due to the robustness of host response in myeloid cells, whereas the sampling biases across cohorts may have affected the robustness of expression from epithelial cells. This is an important consideration for clinical translation as we would like to minimize variability due to sampling bias at pointof-care. If there was consistent expression in epithelial cells across all datasets, our framework would have prioritized it. In other words, our discovery process is unlikely to be intrinsically biased against selecting the genes expressed in epithelial cells.\nOur study has a few limitations. First, COCONUT co-normalization of training datasets required to build the regression model may have obfuscated some biological signals. However, our validation datasets were not co-normalized, which in turn demonstrated that the effects of acute viral infection on the host immune response are robustly detectable across cohorts. Second, we validated the 33-mRNA signature in retrospective cohorts that used only microbiologically confirmed patients in a case\u2013control design. The performance characteristics of the 33-mRNA signature will differ in patient cohorts that rely on non-microbiological adjudication methods, which are known to suffer from high inter-rater variations, leading to a variable standard. The 33-mRNA signature should be validated in additional prospective cohorts from other populations and where the microbiological diagnosis is not available. In such a study, RNAseq could be used to validate viral presence and load in an unbiased manner. Third, critical considerations for clinical use are the temporal and clinical resolution of the test. None of the studies included in our analysis profiled patients longitudinally, provided time since symptom onset, or documented severity. Given the widespread acceptance of home nasal swab tests, there is high likelihood that patients will present at different time since symptom onset, this data should be included in future studies. Hence, future studies would need to include individuals with different, documented levels of infection severity as well as different times since symptom onsets to assess diagnostic performance of the signature. Fourth, our validation cohorts, which included patients with non-viral ARI, did not provide sample-level information. Therefore,\nwe could not further explore accuracy of our classifier in distinguishing viral ARI from specific non-viral ARIs. Fifth, although we found no differences in the 33-mRNA scores between adult and pediatric patients with viral ARI in the discovery datasets, all validation datasets, which also included all non-viral ARI samples, only included adult patients. Hence, further validation in pediatric cohorts is required to assess generalizability of the classifier across the entire age spectrum, and in pediatric patients with non-viral ARI. Future studies would focus on testing our signature and the classifier in pediatric patients and in elderly patients to assess the impact of aging. Sixth, none of the studies included in our analysis provided information on comorbidities. Hence, we could not assess how our 33-mRNA signature would perform in patients with comorbidities, especially immune system-related disorders. Future studies validating our 33-mRNA signatures should focus on addressing this limitation.\nDespite these limitations, we have successfully utilized multicohort analyses of heterogeneous data to repeatedly identify robust host response signatures that diagnose the presence of an infection [15], differentiate bacterial vs viral infection [29, 52], predict severity of infection [17, 53\u201356], and in some cases identify the infecting pathogen [14, 16] in blood samples. We and others have validated these signatures in independent prospective cohorts [57, 58]. Combined with machine learning-based classifiers, we have moved several of these signatures to clinical development and demonstrated their accuracy in multiple prospective cohorts [30, 31, 56, 59, 60]. Our longterm goal is to extend the similar capability to nasal swab samples, and the current work is the first step in that process that demonstrates the feasibility of our approach."

            "text": "Our study of host response profiles in the nasal samples of viral ARI patients identified a robust 33-mRNA signature diagnostic of viral ARI that is primarily driven by myeloid cells and conserved across different age groups. This signature forms a foundation for the development of \u2018RespVerity\u2019\u2014a diagnostic test that will identify viral ARIs using nasal swab samples. Furthermore, such a test could integrate pathogen detection as well as host response on a single diagnostic platform using nasal swab samples. This test will allow rapid confirmation of viral infection when a pathogen cannot be identified and thereby reduce the misuse of antibiotics and facilitate pathogen surveillance.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13073\u2011 023\u2011 01216\u20110.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Figure S1: Power analysis.
