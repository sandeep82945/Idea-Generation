    "abstractText": "This paper evaluates the feasibility of using wind power for power supply to coastal communities isolated from the main supply grid. The case study is Stewart Island, where the cost of electricity provided by a central diesel power station is higher than the grid network in New Zealand. The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) conducted by MetOcean Solutions Limited (MSL) is used to find Foveaux as an optimized site for generating wind power. Global Wind Atlas is used to plot the wind rose of current wind patterns in New Zealand. In the next step, wind speed data from each site are imported from the NASA database to WRPLOT view software and Homer Pro to find wind frequency distribution and output power in the area. The maximum annual power can be seen in WSW (32,299 kW hours/year), SW (20,111 kW hours/year) and W (15,622 kW hour/year) directions, respectively.",

Introduction\nThe World Energy Outlook 2019 clarifies the effect of recent decisions on energy systems in the future. If no policy actions are taken, then the current trend of energy demand is anticipated to increase by 1.30% per year until 2040, leading to an increase in emissions [1]. Nowadays, with the increasing global energy demand and global climate change, two essential solutions have been considered to tackle this issue: (i) reducing the cost of energy and (ii) finding new sources of energy that are environment friendly [2]. With the negative climate impact of fossil fuel power generation and the requirement of global policy to shift toward a green mix of energy production, investment in renewable energy is an opportunity in developing countries. However, a poor economy associated with limited income, funds availability and regulations governing project funding and development are key factors that challenge investors in the energy sector [3]. The New Zealand government has set the country\u2019s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 and 80% by 2050 [4]. Between 1990 and 2019, Green House Gas (GHG) emissions increased from 41,114 kilo tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kt CO2-e) to 82,318 kt CO2-e [5]. The New Zealand Government ratified the 2015 Paris Accord on 4 October 2016 and, as a result, Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) became a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). NDC target is to reduce GHG emissions to 30% below the 2005 level (83.7 Mt CO2-e) by 2030 (58.6 Mt) and net zero by 2050 [6,7]. However, this is a net target. Therefore, if 88.9 Mt GHGs are emitted in 2030, 30.3 Mt GHG removal is required. This target will be met through reducing current pollutants in international clean strategy markets [8]. In New Zealand, the government aims for 90% of electricity production to be from renewable sources by 2025 [9] and 100% by 2035 [10]. Currently, 11,349 km of transmission lines distribute electricity from remote areas, where generators are located, all over New Zealand. New Zealand consumes about 38,800 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity per\nSensors 2022, 22, 8428. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22218428 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 8428 2 of 15\nyear. In 2017, renewable sources (hydro, geothermal, wind and solar) supplied 59%, 17%, 5% and 0.2% of the country\u2019s electricity needs, respectively, and thermal sources (coal, diesel and gas) supplied the other 18.8% [10]. The conversion of the kinetic energy of wind into electricity via wind turbines represents wind energy. It is one of the fastest-growing renewables, as wind turbines are being installed worldwide [11]. Wind power systems are a cost-effective technology for harnessing renewable energy and have expanded annually at a dramatic rate of 25\u201335% globally over the last decade [12,13]. Historically, wind directions are determined from eolian sandstones [14]. In modern wind turbines, control mechanisms and operation of yaw systems maximise wind power extraction from different wind directions [15]. Accurate predictions on the wind power to be produced by the turbines are required for the grid operators from very short time scales to a few days ahead, in order to strike the balance between power supply and demand. Uncertainties and frequent fluctuations in wind speed and direction may create problems for customers who are in need of electricity supply. Further, the temporal, geographical and climatic factors, such as the particular time of the day, terrain, humidity and temperature, also affect the wind power generation that depends on generator hours of wind turbines, speed and direction of the wind, air density and position of the turbines. If the wind speed in different directions could be precisely forecast, it could bring about multiple benefits in adjusting control systems, maintenance scheduling, reducing economic and technical risks and profit maximization of the power trade. Due to the importance attached to the wind speed among all numerical weather prediction data, the objective of this research was focused on studying the variation in wind power generated by different directions. This is essential to predicate in order to maximise power generation from wind. Therefore, this paper presents a novel research study based on the climate model to forecast its wind power generation in different wind patterns. In this sense, this study provides an insight into an optimized off-shore site near Stewart Island to propose wind power as an alternative source for their demand. To do this, Global Wind Atlas [16] is used to plot the wind rose in current wind patterns. In the next step, wind speed data from the Foveaux site are imported from the NASA database [17] to WRPLOT view software [18] and Homer Pro [19] to find wind frequency distribution and output power in each site.\nFrom a technical point of view, the contributions of the paper are as follows:\n1. Explore the use of wind energy for off-grid design; 2. Explore climate model for precise forecast of wind generation; 3. Explore the use of optimization software and climate models at the same time to increase power generation; 4. Define a method that could be used to optimize wind generation using climate models.\nHomer Pro and WRPLOT view software are used for the integration of energy sources and analysing the resource potential. The HOMER Pro\u00ae microgrid software is used to optimize the off-grid and on-grid designs in both engineering and economic aspects for residential, commercial and community purposes [19]. The WRPLOT view software is used to provide the available classes of turbine speeds for a given location [18]. The paper is organized as follows: after the Section 1, Section 2 presents the status of wind energy, Section 3 presents the methods used to evaluate the wind directions and the models used, Section 4 presents the Results and, finally, the Discussion and Conclusions are given in Section 5. What is novel about the project described in this section is that it investigates the technical feasibility of wind generation directional wise. The results will enable us to propose the directions with maximum power generation."

It is estimated that on-shore and off-shore wind power will generate more than a third of the total electricity needed in the medium term, becoming the primary generation source by 2050 [22]. In 2015, only 5% of New Zealand\u2019s electricity generation was supplied from wind [23], which is expected to be 20% of NZ generation by 2035 [24]. Compared with on-shore wind energy resources, off-shore wind fields have many advantages, such as persistent wind, faster-flowing speed, higher uniformity and longer available time per year, flat sea surface and low turbulence intensity, which promotes the vigorous development of the off-shore wind power industry [25,26].

Wind farm capacity can be built, as it is essentially the most cost-effective form of electricity generation, being predictable and dependable and the costs of fuel are known (wind is free) [35]. A Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) report issued on June 2020 describes the desired wind generation growth stack on a decadal basis between 2020 and 2060, as tabulated in Table 1.\nSensors 2022, 22, 8428 4 of 15\nIt shows that 2500 MW of new wind generation is required between 2020 and 2030, 1500 MW between 2030 and 2040, 2000 MW between 2040 and 2050 and 2000 MW between 2050 and 2060. To put this in context, there is currently only 690 MW of wind generation in NZ and most of this total has taken the previous 20 years to develop and construct [37]. Most existing wind generation is located in Waikato, Manawatu, Wellington and Southland. Future growth areas include Northland, west coast Waikato, South Taranaki, Hawkes Bay, Canterbury, Otago and Southland [38].\n3. Materials and Methods\nNIWA recording sites summarize every hourly measurement, illustrating patterns of turbulence and calm in different places in New Zealand. According to it, wind patterns of New Zealand are (a) Christchurch: gentle winds from most directions, (b) Bluff: strong westerlies, moderate easterlies and southerlies, (c) Dunedin: wind from most directions, except the north-east and south, (d) Greymouth: strong south-westerlies and easterlies, (e) Blenheim: moderate westerlies and north westerlies, (f) Auckland: dominated by westerlies, south westerlies and north easterlies, (g) Awakino: strong westerlies and moderate south-easterlies, (h) Gisborne: a calm year of mostly gentle winds, (i) Wellington: strong northerlies and southerlies and (j) Akitio: wind from all directions, with especially strong north-westerlies [39]. Stewart Island is selected as an off-grid site to evaluate the maximum possibility of wind power generation as an alternative to the current diesel station. Then, to find Foveaux as an optimized site for wind power generation, NIWA and MetOcean models were used. Global Wind Atlas [16] and WRPLOT view software [18] were used to identify wind rose and distribution of wind speeds in different ranges. Next, to find accurate wind power in different directions, data from SIESA [40] were analysed according to cut-in speed of selected turbines. All steps for identifying the maximum wind power generation from Stewart Island will be explained with details in the next sub-sections, which are:\n\u2022 Selecting a suitable site for the case study. \u2022 Obtaining environmental data for the energy resources or wind speeds. \u2022 Turbine selection.\n3.1. Site Selection\nStewart Island is selected as a case study to evaluate wind power generation for power supply. The island is a remote coastal community isolated from a national supply grid (Figure 2). The cost of electricity is much higher than on the grid-connected mainland because power is supplied to just 408 customers from a small diesel power station located centrally in the island\u2019s main settlement Oban by the Stewart Island Electrical Supply Authority (SIESA). Its retail charge is 62 c/kWh, of which 23 c/kWh is the direct cost of operating five diesel generators. Local residents believe that reducing the consumption of diesel and having a renewable source of electricity generation are two of the island\u2019s highest priorities. Therefore, replacing diesel as a renewable energy source is a top priority for residents [40].\nSensors 2022, 22, 8428 5 of 15Sensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15\nFigure 2.

Obtaining Environmental Data Tidal current data were obtained from a simulation model, which MetOcean Solutions Limited (MSL) conducted on an NZ-wide grid with a 0.06\u00b0 resolution (5.6 \u00d7 6.6 km). The simulation nested high-resolution domains over Foveaux Strait (0.004\u00b0; 340 \u00d7 450 m), shown in Figure 3. The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) was used to hindcast the tidal current in a vertically integrated two-dimensional mode with boundaries provided by the global TPX07.1 solution. According to the MetOcean atmospheric model, the tidal currents in four areas, (i) Cape Regina (in the north), (ii) Cook Strait (between two Islands), (iii) Foveaux Strait (in the north of Stewart Island) and (iv) south of Stewart Island, are more than 1 m/second. Cape Reinga and the south of Stewart Island were not considered further, since both areas are significant distances from existing electricity infrastructure and potential markets, both of which would considerably increase the cost of potential projects in these areas [41]. Therefore, two areas are suitable (i) Cook Strait in the south of the northern island and (ii) the Foveaux Strait in the south of the southern island in Stewart Island.\nFigure 2.

Discussion and Conclusions This paper investigated climate models for predicting generated wind power in different wind patterns for Stewart Island to maximise power generation in a remote off-grid coastal community and avoid the detrimental effects of off-grid diesel generation on the environment. Stewart Island was selected as a case study because it is typical of isolated coastal communities in New Zealand, which depend on small locally operated diesel power stations or single-household petrol generators. Based on the selection of turbine and Foveaux as facility sites and by including the resource data of the wind speed, the design provides the capacity of wind energy from different directions. It is generated from a wind model commissioned by Stewart Island Electricity Supply (SIESA). Applying control mechanisms and the operation of yaw systems maximise wind power extraction from different wind directions. To do this, NIWA and MetOcean models were used to find Foveaux as an optimised site north of Stewart Island. Then, Global Wind Atlas was used to plot wind rose of current wind patterns in Foveaux. It indicates that the dominant direction for Foveaux is west. WRPLOT view software was used to plot wind frequency distribution downloaded from NASA Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy database at the Foveaux site. Using the XANT M-21 wind turbine provides electricity for 90.5% of the year for Oban. An industry-recognised simulation software package, Homer Pro, was used to import wind speeds from the NASA Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy database at the Foveaux site. The results, as presented and discussed in Section 3, enable several conclusions:  There is enough wind to generate electricity for 90% of the year at the Foveaux site. How-\never, this site is on the other side of Foveaux Strait, 40 km away from Stewart Island\u00b4s community at Oban.\n DC electricity from the off-shore Foveaux site can be integrated with AC electricity from the existing on-shore diesel generators at Oban. The design solution is to feed power through a DC marine cable to a DC-AC converter at the Stewart Island shore, then through an AC land cable to a system controller at Oban\u00b4s diesel generator station.  The design can be optimised in a way that enables Stewart Island\u00b4s power to be supplied partly from renewable sources. Simulation of various climate models shows several directions, which look promising. The maximum wind power can be generated in WSW and SW directions.\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\nPo w\ner o\nut pu\nt ( kW\nho ur\ns/ ye\nar )\nFigure 15.

Simulation of various climate models shows several directions, which look promising. The maximum wind power can be generated in WSW and SW directions. n The investigation is worth implementing because it could supply Stewart Island\u00b4s power demand from a renewable source, reducing the detrimental effects of using diesel fuel on the environment. n It is unknown whether the design can be constructed at an affordable cost because the Homer Pro financial analysis module does not include construction or installation. Further, this research just focused on climate models. n A cost\u2013benefit analysis is needed to determine whether the supply authority can recover all construction, installation, operating and maintenance/replacement costs from a lower charge to the community than its present retail charge.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.M.N., J.K. and L.B.; methodology, N.M.N., J.K. and L.B.; software, N.M.N.; validation, N.M.N., J.K. and L.B.; formal analysis, N.M.N.; investigation, N.M.N.; resources, N.M.N. and J.K.; data curation, N.M.N.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.M.N. and J.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, N.M.N. and J.K.; visualisation, N.M.N.; supervision, J.K.; project administration, N.M.N.
