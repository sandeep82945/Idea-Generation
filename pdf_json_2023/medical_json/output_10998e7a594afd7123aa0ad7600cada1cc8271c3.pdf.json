    "abstractText": "Background An increasing number of studies in Western countries have shown that healthy eating patterns have a protective effect against cognitive decline and dementia, however, information about this relationship among nonwestern populations with different cultural environments is scarce. The present study investigated the association between dietary patterns (DPs) and cognitive function in the Iranian elderly. Methods In this case\u2013control study, the data of 290 elderly people in two groups of case and control (Mean age in case: 74.2 \u00b1 8.6, in control: 67.3 \u00b1 7.3 year) were analyzed. Two DPs of healthy and unhealthy were extracted from a 142-item dish-based food frequency questionnaire, and patterns driven by principal components analysis (PCA) of 25 food groups. Multivariate binary logistic regression calculated the odds ratio (OR) of cognitive impairment with adjustment for potential confounding factors. Results A healthy DP, characterized by high consumption of fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts, was related to a decrease in the odds of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Iranian elderly people. Also, moderate adherence to an unhealthy food pattern was associated with an increase in the probability of the disease; however, the association was not statistically significant. Conclusion In this elderly population, a healthy eating pattern was associated with reducing the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Further prospective studies are recommended.",

Delays in addressing the health needs and quality of life among this population will lead to irreparable complications. Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are among the common diseases of this period of life which affect not only the life of the patients but also the life of the patient\u2019s family members [2]. Dementia is a progressive chronic neurodegenerative disease and the most common type of dementia is one caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More than half of elderlies with dementia are suffering from this type of disease [3]. *Correspondence: Maryam Amini maramin2002@yahoo.com; mamini@sbmu.ac.ir 1 Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ziaeian Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran 2 Geriatric Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran 3 Neurology Division, CNS Department, Western University, London, ON, Canada 4 Department of Nutrition Research, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute and Faculty of Nutrition Sciences and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran 5 Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\nAccording to a report by the World Alzheimer\u2019s Organization in 2020, 55 million people in the world were estimated to live with dementia, and every 3\u00a0s a new case of dementia occurs. Thus, it is predicted that by 2050, the number of sufferers will reach 139 million [4]\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is a global concern that imposes a great financial burden on the patient and the medical care system of the communities [5]. Hence, in addition to pharmaceutical and non-pharmacological treatments, researchers pay special attention to ways to prevent or slow down the progress of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease at the beginning [6].\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common type of dementia in the elderly, is caused by the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain [7]. Beta-amyloid protein is deposited inside and between neurons and by causing inflammation and oxidative stress reaction, it causes neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, reduction of synaptic flexibility, and impaired nerve function [8\u201310]\nThis process in the brain is related to the activation of the immune system [11]. This disease causes impairment in recent or short-term memory and reduced learning and by the progression of the disease finally, the patients lose understanding and attention toward themselves.\nAge and genetic predisposition have been known as unmodifiable and physical inactivity, blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and smoking as modifiable risk factors for dementia.\nThe relationship between lifestyle and nutrition with dementia is well understood and it is documented that their modification at the beginning of the disease may delay or prevent dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [12]. However, the etiology of most types of dementia has not been completely known.\nDietary intake, in terms of its potential to prevent disease development, has been widely discussed. Although some epidemiological studies have reported that consumption of certain types of foods such as fish and vegetables may be preventive against dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the results are still mixed.\nStudies related to the effect of food on health have been conducted by two different approaches in which either the effect of the nutrients are investigated alone or the total food intake as a pattern is considered. In the first approach, the interactions of nutrients with each other are ignored, whereas from another point of view, all the interactions between nutrients are examined and DPs are identified [13\u201315].\nRecent studies on the relationship between diet and dementia among the elderly have shifted from the role of nutrients or foods alone to the role of DPs which reflect the complexity of diet and eating behaviors.\nSo far, various studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between DPs with the occurrence of dementia worldwide [16, 17], and several studies have acknowledged the protective and positive effect of the Mediterranean diet on dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s [18, 19]. However, no research has revealed any relationship between other DPs and dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s. The present case\u2013control study aimed to investigate the relationship between Iranian dietary patterns and occurrences of Alzheimer\u2019s among the elderly."

In case the content of the nutrients in a food item was essentially different from other food items, or in case the consumption of that food item indicated a special eating habit, a separate food group was assigned to that(e.g., tea and coffee, salt, and mayonnaise). Due to memory impairment, patients with Alzheimer\u2019s hardly recall the components of mixed foods they consumed. Since the ingredients of the mixed foods were embedded in the FFQ we used, the patients did not need to remember the frequency and amount of each component [23]."

Epidemiological and animal research also supports the protective effect of fruits and vegetables against cognitive disorders and dementia. The brain is highly susceptible to oxidative damage, and fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants [28]. In addition, according to animal studies, antioxidants prevent nerve damage and improve cognitive function [29].\nVitamin C is a strong water-soluble antioxidant that prevents the oxidative process by donating its electrons [30]. A study on mice models showed that the antioxidant vitamins in green leafy vegetables could be beneficial for cognitive health. It was also found that folate found in some fruits and vegetables is associated with cognitive function and dementia [31]. Folate deficiency can increase homocysteine levels, which have had direct neurological effects in animal studies [32, 33]. Therefore, the beneficial effect of antioxidants from the diet may be more important for older people whose antioxidant requirements are higher. There is accumulating evidence that indicates increased consumption of nuts, whole grains, milk, and dairy products, especially low-fat milk and low-fat dairy products, is associated with better cognitive performance and a reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [34, 35].\nThe healthy DP in the current study included high amounts of nuts which confirms this scientific fact. Furthermore, vitamin E which is abundant in nuts and fortified cereals has been shown to improve lifespan and mitochondrial and neurological function in aged mice [36].\nThe favorable effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of marine origin, including Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on cognitive decline or dementia, have been well established in several epidemiological studies [17, 37]. The effect can be attributed to the role of fatty acids in maintaining\nValues < 0.20 were excluded. Bartlett\u2019s Test of Sphericity < 0.001.

In addition, the protective effect of PUFA can be related to the antiinflammatory and vascular protection effects exerted by these fatty acids [38].\nAlso, increasing evidence on the role of several B vitamins, in particular, there is folate, vitamins B6 and B12, which are required for proper DNA methylation and to prevent the accumulation of homocysteine, which potentially causes neurotoxic effects [37].\nVery recent studies in Western countries have shown that dietary patterns rich in red meat and processed meat are associated with poor cognitive performance and faster cognitive decline [39, 40]. These findings are consistent with the results of the present study in which an unhealthy DP characterized by high consumption of red meat and saturated fat increased the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in moderate consumers.\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, there has been no similar study in Iran to have such a large sample size of patients with dementia. On the other hand, as mentioned earlier, for the first time in this study a 142-item dishbased FFQ was used to measure the food intake of the patients with dementia. Because of cognitive disorders among these patients, they poorly remember the ingredients of mixed foods and the consumption frequency of each ingredient. This tool, therefore, could collect data much easier, faster, and more accurately compared to item-based FFQs.\nOur study had several limitations. It was a case\u2013control study and we cannot rule out the possibility that the dietary habits of the participants may have changed with the onset of dementia symptoms as a result of various factors namely changes in the social environment, changes in smell, taste, physical activity, and drugs affecting weight. Therefore, the causal relationship between nutrition and cognitive performance cannot be determined in the present study and the results should be interpreted with caution. In this regard, prospective data are recommended for further clarification.\nSerum levels of folate and vitamins were not investigated in our study. Meanwhile, the association of Alzheimer\u2019s disease with some nutritional factors was not significant in this study. The reasons can be the simultaneous conduction of the project with the COVID-19 epidemic, lockdown, and people\u2019s reluctance to participate in the intervention, followed the smaller sample size and the possibility of Alzheimer\u2019s disease overlapping with other types of dementia in the participants.\nDue to the mixed results obtained from related studies, there is a need for extensive interventions with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up period to investigate\nthe effect of different diets on Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the elderly in Iran."
