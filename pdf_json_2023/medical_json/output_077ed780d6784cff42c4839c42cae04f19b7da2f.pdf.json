            "text": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disease, usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, that occurs with an estimated incidence of 1 in ~7,500 individuals (Hannah et al., 2022). The disease primarily affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts, where the lack of efficient mucociliary clearance (MCC) results in recurrent and chronic infections. Bronchiectasis, otitis media, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are common features of the disease (Knowles et al., 2016). Although advancements in sequencing technology have continued to identify the genetic causes of PCD, with over 50 different causal genes now confirmed, there has been little progress on the development of specific treatments to alleviate or eliminate the symptoms of the disease (Zariwala et al., 2015).\nCRS is a common and debilitating disease symptom among individuals with PCD (Davis et al., 2015; Shapiro et al., 2016). Due to the lack of effective MCC, mucus accumulates in the sinuses and nasal passages, resulting in a significant decrease in the quality of life (Lucas et al., 2015) (Dell et al., 2016). In addition, mucus serves as a nidus for infection and may act as a reservoir of pathogens that lead to lower airway infections. Surprisingly, there are no currently approved mucolytic agents that have been demonstrated to effectively clear excess mucus from the nasal cavity. The only approved mucolytic agent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), thins mucus by reducing disulfide bonds which polymerize mucin macromolecules (Pedre et al., 2021). However, the activity and absorption profile of NAC make it largely ineffective on the airway epithelium. Additionally, NAC has a noxious \u201crotten egg\u201d odor that induces bronchospasms (Dano, 1971; Crouch et al., 2007). As an alternative to NAC, investigators have recently explored the effectiveness of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in models of muco-obstructive airway disease (Ehre et al., 2018; Morgan et al., 2021). We hypothesize that novel mucolytics may have therapeutic benefits in CRS. To test this hypothesis, we first explored the use of CT imaging to quantify the extent of mucus accumulation in an inducible mouse model of PCD that develops severe CRS (Ostrowski et al., 2010). We then performed a pilot study to examine the ability of nasal lavage with TCEP to improve mucus clearance from the nasal cavity."

The animals were aged for a minimum of six additional weeks after tamoxifen treatment to allow for the cessation of MCC and the development of rhinosinusitis and were usually studied at 4\u20136 months of age (Ostrowski et al., 2010). The animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. All studies used littermates of both sexes and were\nperformed under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina."

Thresholding (\u22121024 to 0) was used to create a mask including the airspace in the nasal cavity. The image was manually cropped at the tip of the nasal cavity and the beginning of the nasopharynx to isolate the nasal cavity. Additionally, isolated air-filled spaces were manually added to the airspace in the main nasal cavity. The Mimics software generated a 3Dmodel, and the volume of the nasal airspace was measured. Volumes before treatment were subtracted from the volumes after treatment to determine the increase in airspace, representing the removal of mucus."

As previously reported, deletion of the ciliary protein Dnaic1 in a mouse model of PCD results in a loss of MCC and the subsequent accumulation of mucus and neutrophils in the sinonasal cavity (Ostrowski et al., 2010). However, postmortem histologic examination of the nasal cavity is limited to a single time point per animal. To evaluate the utility of CT scans to assess murine mucosal inflammation and mucus accumulations, we obtained CT scans of the nasal cavity from control and PCD\nmice and then prepared routine histological sections from the same animals. Examination of multiple sections from multiple animals demonstrated that the AB-PAS staining of mucus accumulation was visually concordant with the murine CT scans (Figure 1). Furthermore, CT scanning allowed the construction of a 3Dmodel and quantification of the airspace of the entire nasal cavity (Figure 2), compared to the 2D limitation of traditional histology sections.\nWe therefore used CT imaging to further examine the pathogenesis of CRS in this model. A group of PCD animals was imaged by CT over several months, and the change in nasal airspace was monitored by constructing 3D models. Although the PCD animals routinely showed evidence of accumulated mucus, the airspace of the sinonasal cavity increased over time in the PCD animals compared to the controls (p = 0.0415; Figure 3A). This expansion was due to degeneration of the turbinates and enlargement of the sinuses (Figure 3B).\nTo begin investigating the effectiveness of reducing agents for the treatment of CRS, several pilot studies were performed. PCD mice were imaged by CT to obtain a baseline measure of nasal airspace and then treated by intranasal lavage with 10 mM TCEP. Several treatment protocols were tested (e.g., 1\u20133 doses daily; 1\u20135 days). Following treatment, a repeat CT scan was obtained, and the change in nasal airspace was measured. Some of the treated animals showed large areas of mucus clearing, as indicated by the increase in nasal airspace (Supplementary Figure S2).\nTo further examine the effectiveness of reducing agents for the acute treatment of CRS, we used a protocol similar to what individuals might utilize in a home or clinical setting. Groups of PCD mice were imaged by CT to obtain a baseline measure of nasal airspace. The following day, the animals were treated three times by intranasal lavage with 10 mMTCEP or saline (20 \u03bcl; 90 min between treatments) and again imaged by CT. The change in nasal airspace was determined by an investigator blinded to the animals\u2019 treatment. As an additional control, some animals (sham) underwent a mock treatment (anesthesia only). Not surprisingly, the sham-treated animals showed no significant change in nasal airspace (Figure 4A; p = 0.1609; n = 14). In contrast, both TCEP- and saline-treated animals showed a highly significant increase in nasal airspace (Figures 4B, C; p < 0.0001; n = 29).

            "text": "CRS causes substantial morbidity, impairs quality of life, and may seed the lower respiratory tract in individuals with PCD (Lucas et al., 2015; Dell et al., 2016). In this genetic cause of CRS, mucus accumulation is the inciting factor for disease pathogenesis, and the development of therapies to reduce or remove mucus would likely improve patient outcomes. At present, the only approved mucolytic agent, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has not been proven effective at improving mucus clearance. Thus, the testing and further development of improved mucolytic agents is needed.\nTo study the pathogenesis and treatment of PCD, we have previously developed an inducible murine model of PCD. This model avoids situs abnormalities and hydrocephalus that frequently occur in traditional knock-out models of PCD, including the knock-out model of Dnaic1 (Supplementary Figure S1), and allows for the study of adult animals (Ostrowski et al., 2010). Inducing the deletion of the ciliary protein Dnaic1 in postnatal mice results in a loss of MCC and mucus accumulation in the nasal cavity. Thus, this animal model may be useful for the testing of mucolytic agents.\nHerein, we present data demonstrating that the accumulation of mucus and the subsequent remodeling of the nasal cavity can be visualized and quantified by CT scans (Figure 1). Not surprisingly, comparing the images obtained by CT with the routine histological staining of nasal sections demonstrated good visual concordance, indicating that quantifying the volume of nasal airspace could be used as an inverse measure of mucus accumulation. Interestingly, we observed an increase in nasal airspace over time as a consequence of disease progression, due to remodeling of the nasal cavity (Figure 3). The mechanisms responsible for this remodeling are unknown and will require further investigation.\nFIGURE 3 Changes in nasal airspacemeasured by CT imaging over time. (A) Groups of PCD (n = four males and three females) and littermate control mice (n= twomales and two females) were repeatedly imaged by CT at monthly intervals beginning at ~7 weeks of age. Although PCD mice demonstrate mucus accumulation in the nasal cavity over this time, the nasal airspace increases compared to the control (p = 0.0415). (B) Representative images of a mouse with mucus accumulation (left; arrows indicate mucus accumulation in the ethmoturbinate region, and asterisk indicates the mucus-occluded sinus cavity) compared to a mouse with severe remodeling/ degeneration resulting in an increase in nasal airspace, even though accumulated mucus is still present (arrows).\nFIGURE 4 Saline and TCEP lavage improve nasal airspace in a murine model of PCD compared to sham treatment. Groups of PCD mice were treated three times by nasal lavage, and the change in nasal airspace was measured. (A) At baseline, mice in the sham group had amean airspace of 37.8 mm3 (95% C.I. 34.7\u201340.8 mm3) and 38.8 mm3 after sham treatment (95% C.I. 35.6\u201342.0 mm3) with no significant difference (p = 0.1609). (B) Saline treatment increased nasal airspace from 37.0 mm3 (95%C.I. 34.6\u201339.3 mm3) to 41.1 mm3 (95% C.I. 38.6\u201343.7mm3; p < 0.0001). (C) Treatment with TCEP increased nasal airspace from 36.4 mm3 (95% C.I. 33.9\u201338.9 mm3) to 41.4 mm3 (95% C.I. 38.7\u201344.0 mm3; p < 0.0001). (D) TCEP treatment showed a greater increase in nasal airspace than saline or sham.\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org04\nWe then explored the use of this model to test the effect of a mucolytic agent on mucus clearance. Nasal lavage with saline is commonly used by individuals suffering from CRS due to PCD or other causes. Nasal lavage is proposed to clear mucus and debris and provide symptomatic relief. In these studies, saline alone reduced the mucus burden and significantly increased nasal airspace compared to sham-treated controls (p = 0.0084). These results confirm the beneficial effects of lavage and provide clear evidence that the murine model of PCDwill be useful to investigatemucolytic treatments of CRS. Inclusion of a mucolytic agent (TCEP) in the lavage resulted in a greater improvement in nasal airspace compared to animals treated with saline alone (5.0 vs. 4.2 mm3). Although not statistically significant, treatment with the mucolytic agent showed a clear trend toward more efficient mucus removal (Figure 3D), potentially by reducing the disulfide cross-links in the mucin molecules. Similarly, Ehre et al. (2018) demonstrated a decrease in lung mucus burden in a mouse model of obstructive lung disease, and Morgan et al. (2021) demonstrated a decrease in mucus burden in an allergic mouse model following treatment with a reducing agent. Taken together, these studies suggest that mucolytic agents may be useful in the treatment of CRS caused by PCD or other diseases.\nIn summary, our studies demonstrate the usefulness of the murine model and CT imaging for studies of CRS in PCD. Furthermore, our results suggest that additional studies of mucolytic agents, exploring different treatment regimens and/or improved mucolytic agents, are warranted."
