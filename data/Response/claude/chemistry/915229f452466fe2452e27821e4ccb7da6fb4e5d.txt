 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the catalytic activity of the new Mo5 clusters for organic synthesis or hydrogen evolution reactions. The paper mentions this as a promising application area for chalcogenide Mo clusters in general.

2. Explore modifications of the ligand environment to tune the properties of the Mo5 clusters. The paper notes that organic ligands like azoles can be used to manipulate the properties of chalcogenide clusters. 

3. Study the magnetic properties and spin interactions in more detail, especially at lower temperatures where antiferromagnetic ordering was suggested. Magnetic measurements below 80K may reveal more insights.

4. Isolate and characterize the hypothetical neutral 16 VEC form of the cluster that was proposed based on electrochemistry. This may require using different synthetic conditions or ligands.

5. Extend the chemistry to synthesize and investigate clusters with different nuclearities, such as Mo4, Mo6, or Mo9 cores using similar chalcogenide and organic mixed-ligand environments. This could reveal how properties change with cluster size.
