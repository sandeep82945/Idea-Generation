1. **Investigate the effect of protein flexibility on adsorption behavior:** 
The current study assumes that proteins are rigid bodies. However, in reality, proteins are flexible and can undergo conformational changes upon adsorption. Future research could investigate how protein flexibility affects the adsorption process and the resulting protein-polymer complex structure.


2. **Study the role of protein-protein interactions in adsorption:** 
The current study does not consider protein-protein interactions. However, in many cases, proteins can interact with each other, which can affect their adsorption behavior. Future research could investigate the role of protein-protein interactions in adsorption and how they can be used to control the assembly of protein-polymer complexes.


3. **Explore the effect of different polymer architectures on adsorption:** 
The current study focuses on planar polymer brushes. However, other polymer architectures, such as spherical brushes, stars, and dendrimers, can also be used to create protein-polymer complexes. Future research could investigate how different polymer architectures affect the adsorption process and the resulting protein-polymer complex structure.


4. **Investigate the effect of environmental conditions on adsorption:** 
The current study is conducted under idealized conditions. However, in many practical applications, protein-polymer complexes are exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Future research could investigate how environmental conditions affect the adsorption process and the stability of the resulting protein-polymer complex.


5. **Develop experimental techniques to validate the model predictions:** 
The current study is based on computer simulations. However, experimental validation is needed to confirm the model predictions. Future research could develop experimental techniques to measure the adsorption behavior of proteins on polymer surfaces and compare the results with the model predictions.
