    "abstractText": "Purpose Lisdexamfetamine (LDX), which is used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, is composed of l-lysine attached to dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine). In this article, we report a forensic autopsy case in which prescription drugs were unknown at autopsy. While amphetamine was detected, methamphetamine could not be detected by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) in any of samples collected. Thus, we aimed to quantify LDX concentrations in autopsy samples and to prove that the amphetamine detected in this case was due to metabolized LDX. Methods Femoral vein blood, cardiac whole blood, urine, and gastric content samples were taken at autopsy for toxicological analysis. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using LC\u2013MS/MS. In addition, optical isomer separation for the amphetamine detected was conducted. The stability of LDX in whole blood and urine was also examined at three different temperatures. Results The concentrations of LDX were < 4.00, 30.9, and 4.42 ng/mL in whole blood, urine, and gastric content samples, respectively. The concentrations of amphetamine were 329, 510, 2970, and 915 ng/mL in femoral vein blood, heart whole blood, urine, and gastric contents, respectively. The amphetamine detected in this case was identified to be only d-amphetamine by optical isomer separation. The d-amphetamine detected was considered to be derived from LDX. Stability experiments revealed that LDX in whole blood decreased at ambient temperature. Conclusions The results in the present case report may be useful in interpreting whether or not the amphetamine detected in a cadaver is a metabolite of LDX.",

Typical acute effects after amphetamine use include enhanced attention and alertness, increased psychomotor performance, and loss of appetite [3]. Excessive amphetamine use can cause serious intoxication and death, predominantly by acute cardiac or cardiopulmonary failure, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, or hyperthermia [4\u20136]. Amphetamine is still one of the most frequently abused drugs worldwide [7] and is frequently detected in forensic toxicological cases [8]. On the other hand, amphetamine is * Suguru Torimitsu torimitsu@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp 1 Department of\u00a0Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of\u00a0Medicine, The University of\u00a0Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo,, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo\u00a0113-0033, Japan 2 Department of\u00a0Legal Medicine, Graduate School of\u00a0Medicine, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-Ku,, Chiba-Shi, Chiba\u00a0260-8670, Japan 3 Department of\u00a0Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of\u00a0Biomedical and\u00a0Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 1-2-3, Minami-Ku, Hiroshima\u00a0734-8553, Japan\n1 3\nused for the treatment of medical conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy [9]. In 2007, lisdexamfetamine (LDX) (Vyvanse\u00ae) (Fig.\u00a01) was approved for ADHD medication in the United States. LDX was also approved in Japan in 2019. LDX is composed of the amino acid l-lysine attached to dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) [10]. After oral ingestion, LDX is hydrolyzed primarily in the red blood cells to produce d-amphetamine [10, 11]. Therefore, when LDX is taken internally, amphetamine is predominantly detected in blood and urine.\nIn Japan, although methamphetamine is commonly abused as a recreational drug [12], abuse of amphetamine is considerably rare. Therefore, amphetamine is rarely detected alone in drug screening and is usually detected with precursor methamphetamine. In this report, we describe a forensic autopsy case in which prescription drugs were unknown at the stage of autopsy; although amphetamine was detected in qualitative screening analysis using liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS), methamphetamine was not found. Based on the later information from the police, the possibility of LDX administration arose for accounting for the appearance of amphetamine only."

Half an hour later, an explosion sound was heard near his house, and a police officer discovered a fire in his room. Firefighters found him lying in a supine position with cardiopulmonary arrest inside the front door. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was not performed. Three 4-L cans of white gasoline were found on the balcony, and oily components were detected in two of the cans. The site of ignition was determined to be inside his room. Although the police ruled it suicidal, the possibility of arson by another person was not excluded. Before the autopsy, the police did not investigate the hospital where he had been under medical treatment.\nAn autopsy was performed about 41\u00a0h after the death was confirmed. His length and weight were approximately 165\u00a0cm and 57.2\u00a0kg, respectively. External examinations demonstrated that most of the skin was brownish to blackish\nbrown with scattered charring. Erythema was present on the posterior lower half of the right lower extremity. On the chest and the anterior surface of the upper limbs, there were skin lacerations exposing subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and some bones. Conjunctival petechiae were not found. Internal examinations showed a small amount of black soot in the upper trachea and reddening in the trachea and bronchial mucosa. Femoral vein blood, cardiac whole blood, urine, and gastric content samples were collected for drug examination."

Chromatographic separation was achieved using an XB-C18 column (100 \u00d7 2.1\u00a0mm, particle size 2.6\u00a0\u00b5m; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) maintained at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of 10\u00a0mM of ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in water (A), and 10\u00a0mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in methanol (B). The flow rate was maintained at 0.4\u00a0mL/min. The gradient program was as follows: 5\u201395% B from 0 to 6\u00a0min, and 95% B until 7.5\u00a0min. At 7.6\u00a0min, the concentration of B was returned to 5% and maintained until 10\u00a0min. The MS was operated in the positive mode with an electrospray ionization interface. Ionization source conditions were as follows: nebulizer gas flow rate, 1.5\u00a0L/min; drying gas flow rate, 10\u00a0L/min; desolvation line temperature, 250\u00a0\u00b0C; and heat block temperature, 400\u00a0\u00b0C.

Calibration curves (four calibration points) for SAM (see Table\u00a0S2) were generated by repeating each point of calibrators 5 times and 5 quantitative values were obtained. The intraday repeatability of LDX was evaluated using the coefficient of variation (%CV) of the quantitative values in SAM. On the other hand, selectivity, linearity (R2), accuracy (%bias), and precision (%CV) were evaluated in MMCM for amphetamine in whole blood and urine, and for bromazepam, venlafaxine, and O-desmethylvenlafaxine in whole blood. Selectivity in MMCM was confirmed by demonstrating no signal interfering with the analytes and ISs in six different lots of human blank whole blood or urine. Intraday (n = 5) and interday (n = 15, 3\u00a0days repetition of intraday) accuracies and precisions in MMCM were determined by measuring quality\n1 3\ncontrol (QC) samples at the low and high points of their calibration curves. The limits of detection (LODs) of LDX in whole blood and for amphetamine in whole blood and urine were estimated by determining lower concentrations of QC sample that could be detected with S/N > 3. The QC samples for the LOD were prepared using three different lots of blank blood and urine. The LODs of LDX in urine and gastric contents were calculated using the equation in SAM proposed by Hasegawa et\u00a0al.

Nine microliters of 100,000\u00a0ng/mL LDX acetonitrile solution was placed into centrifuge tubes and the solvent (acetonitrile) was evaporated using a nitrogen stream. Eighteen milliliters of blank whole blood or urine was added to the tubes and mixed well, after which the samples were analyzed (0\u00a0h). Aliquots of the whole blood and urine were transferred into cryogenic vials and stored at ambient temperature (approximately 25\u00a0\u00b0C), 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and \u2212 20\u00a0\u00b0C.

            "text": "In Japan, more than 73% of illegal drug abuse is attributed to methamphetamine [18]; methamphetamine is usually\ndetected together with amphetamine. However, in the present case, only amphetamine was detected. Forty days after the autopsy, the police conducted a hospital investigation and found that the deceased had been prescribed Vyvanse\u00ae, which uncovered the possibility that he had been taking LDX. Then, LDX was detected in urine and gastric contents, which were kept frozen in a freezer. Although the concentrations of LDX in whole blood were below the LOD, those in the urine and gastric content samples could be quantified (Table\u00a01), showing that LDX could be detected even in postmortem samples. Linearities for LDX, amphetamine, bromazepam, venlafaxine, and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were considered good because the R2 values were greater than 0.99 for all calibration curves (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, both precisions and repeatabilities in the present case were less than 15% (Tables S3\u2013S5), which met the U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance criteria [19]. Thus, the present method using LC\u2013MS/MS may be suitable for\n1 3\naccurate quantification of these compounds. Because the elimination half-life of LDX in living humans is generally less than 1\u00a0h [20], the near-total elimination of LDX from the blood before death of the present victim could be reasonably assumed. Furthermore, the in\u00a0vitro stability study indicated that hydrolysis of LDX in whole blood could have also possibly occurred even after death at ambient temperature (Fig.\u00a04). Similarly, S\u00f8rensen et\u00a0al. [21] reported that when fluoride-untreated blood samples with LDX were stored at 20\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, less than half of the initial concentration was recovered. These results indicate that blood samples should be collected to be frozen as soon as possible at autopsy to ensure the detectability of LDX upon its analyses. However, the in\u00a0vitro stability study revealed that LDX in urine was not hydrolyzed within 7\u00a0days even at ambient temperature (Fig.\u00a05). These results suggest that urine samples may be most useful for detecting LDX during the postmortem period.\nAmphetamine is a molecule with a chiral center and generally exists as a racemate with two isomers, d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine [9]. On the other hand, no residual\nimpurities of l-amphetamine exist in the LDX formulation [9], and no racemization occurs during metabolism [22, 23]. In this case, LDX and d-amphetamine were detected, whereas methamphetamine and l-amphetamine were not detected (Figs.\u00a02, 3). Therefore, the amphetamine in the present case was likely produced from the hydrolysis of LDX. In other words, the toxicological analysis appropriately indicated that no illicit drugs had been used. Furthermore, selegiline, which is used for reducing symptoms in early-stage Parkinson\u2019s disease, is metabolized to desmethylselegiline, l-methamphetamine, and l-amphetamine [24]. Thus, optical isomer separation testing is necessary to determine whether amphetamine detected is a medical or illicit drug.\nThe LODs of methamphetamine and amphetamine for DRIVEN-FLOW\u00ae M8-Z are 500 and 85,000\u00a0ng/mL, respectively. Although there are many different types of immunoassay kits, a simple test using a urine sample may miss the presence of amphetamine because of its low sensitivity for amphetamine. Therefore, a drug toxicology screening test using analytical instruments should be routinely performed at autopsy.\nSymptoms reported after LDX exposure are similar to those of amphetamine toxicity such as increased blood pressure, tachycardia, agitation, and vomiting [25]. Clinical manifestations of stimulant toxicity include effects on the nervous and cardiac systems, and secondary complications such as effects on the kidney, lung, and digestive systems [26]. Krishnan and Montcrief [27] reported that rats died after oral administration of high doses of LDX. Although successful resuscitation after LDX overdose has been reported [28, 29], deaths from LDX intoxication will take place in the future. In the present case, none of the drugs in femoral vein blood did not reach fatal concentrations [30]; the cause of death was obviously thermal burns by fire."

The concentrations of LDX were 30.9 and 4.42\u00a0 ng/mL in urine and gastric content samples, respectively. In the whole blood samples, LDX could not be detected. The amphetamine isomer detected in the samples of this case was identified to be only d-amphetamine derived from metabolism of LDX by optical isomer separation testing. The results in the present case may be useful in interpreting whether or not the amphetamine detected in cadavers is a metabolite of LDX. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate LDX and d-amphetamine from samples in an autopsy case.\n1 3\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11419- 022- 00654-6."
