    "abstractText": "Introduction: Smoking is one of key risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and carotid artery disease (CAD). Despite attempts being made to make the society aware of the consequences of passive and active smoking, as well as worldwide and nationwide epidemiologic research reflecting the scale of the problem, there are still a lot of smokers. Aim: The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between the degree of addiction and the level of motivation for ceasing smoking in the case of patients before vascular surgery. Furthermore, to point out factors that have a significant impact on the level of nicotine dependence and motivation for ceasing smoking. Methods: The survey included patients qualified for vascular surgeries. The patients were active smokers: 69.3% men and 30.7% women. The survey was conducted in the form of a questionnaire based on standard research tools: the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), the Test of Motivation for Ceasing Smoking by Nina Schneider, and the original questionnaire aimed at collecting social and demographic data. Results: Most patients showed a high or moderate degree of nicotine dependence: 46.5% and 40.6%, respectively. An average nicotine dependence ratio based on the Fagerstr\u00f6m test was 6.23 \u00b1 2.39. An average motivation for the ceasing smoking ratio was 4.88 \u00b1 2.76. Only 34.7% of the patients had a high motivation for ceasing smoking. Over half of the patients (61.4%) attempted to cease smoking in the past. Conclusions: Most patients undergoing vascular surgeries showed a high or moderate degree of nicotine dependence and low motivation to quit smoking. The greater the addiction to nicotine, the lower the motivation to quit smoking. Social and demographic factors do not affect the degree of nicotine addiction and the motivation to quit smoking. Years of smoking had an impact on the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

It has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that 4.9 million people die per year because of smoking, and the death toll is expected to rise to 8 million by 2030 [2]. In Poland, smoking remains one of major reasons for premature deaths. The results of the nationwide research on attitudes to smoking indicate that in 2019 almost 8 million people regularly smoked tobacco in Poland, i.e., 21% of the population of Poland [3,4]. Nicotine, which is the main ingredient\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10393. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191610393 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10393 2 of 13\nof cigarettes, has both prothrombotic and atherosclerotic effects and increases the risk of atherosclerosis [5], as well as vascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), carotid artery disease (CAD) [5\u20137]. Ceasing smoking brings about benefits to all smokers, whatever their age and the number of cigarettes they smoke. This is a key element of the strategy of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [8,9]. Nicotine dependence is connected with stimulating the systems of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Stimulating \u03b14\u03b22 receptors increases the release of dopamine. This results in the feeling of pleasure, better mood, the reduction in fear and anxiety, as well as the stimulation of the organism, and even the improvement of memory [10]. Inhaling nicotine from a tobacco product also contributes to the release of noradrenaline (\u201cactivity hormone\u201d). When a cigarette is smoked, the concentration of nicotine or noradrenaline in the blood naturally decreases after some time. Then, the smoker feels a nicotine withdrawal symptom, which is unpleasant for the organism. To improve their condition, patients feel a strong need to smoke another cigarette [11]. Patients of surgery wards usually do not smoke during their hospitalisation due to the non-smoking restrictions, but they come back to the addiction the moment they leave the hospital. Treating nicotine dependence is a challenge to medical professionals and patients."

            "text": "The concept of prerehabilitation was created to improve the quality of the perioperative care. The individual elements are implemented at the very beginning of treatment, and their purpose is to improve the general condition of the organism. In accordance with the definition, the prerehabilitation focuses on:\n\u2022 Taking care of the proper nutrition of the organism; \u2022 Improving the general function of the organism through physical activity; \u2022 Providing psychological support; \u2022 Eliminating harmful addictions: smoking and abuse of alcohol [12].\nSmoking is a recognised perioperative risk factor applicable to 25% of patients of surgery wards [12,13]. Smoking before surgery has a toxic impact on the function of lungs, the heart, and the immunological system, as well as wound treatment, and it generates the risk of infection in the operated place. That is why the smokers are also less capable of meeting surgical requirements [13]. Many studies confirm that ceasing smoking should be an intrinsic element of preparation to any surgery. Physiological benefits appear within several minutes from the last cigarette [13,14]. To reduce postoperative complications, the patient must cease smoking 4\u20136 weeks before the surgery [14]."

The motivation is considered low if the test result is below 7 points and high if the score equals or is greater than 7 points [18,19].\n2.3.3. Original Questionnaire\nThe questionnaire let us collect social and demographic data, such as sex, age, education level, place of residence, marital status, professional activeness. Further questions included the history of smoking: the initiation of nicotine addiction, the time of smoking, the number of cigarettes, attempts of ceasing smoking.

            "text": "In Poland, there are limited data concerning smoking by patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), and carotid artery disease (CAD), which would involve the level of nicotine dependence and motivation for ceasing smoking. Therefore, the authors designed a pilot survey, which allows for the assessment of that problem. The researchers proved that smoking is strictly correlated with the development of vascular diseases, including peripheral arterial disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), and carotid artery disease (CAD) [5,6,20]. In addition, smoking contributes to the progression of vascular diseases [19]. Based on the existing guidelines, all patients to undergo vascular surgeries are recommended to cease smoking [20]. The results of the survey confirm a 40% relative reduction in the risk of all compli ations if the patient cease smokin before the surgery [21].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10393 10 of 13\nThe analysis of the authors\u2019 survey confirmed that 33.9% of the patients were active smokers before the surgery. Over 70% of them declared that they were willing to cease smoking after the vascular surgery, usually within one week of the end of their hospitalisation. The survey performed by Assadian et al. also confirmed that a significant percentage of patients to undergo vascular surgeries are smokers. In addition, half of them still smoked in the hospital, where smoking is forbidden by law [22]. The survey performed by Sztuczka et al. indicated that in the group of PAD patients who were originally qualified for the survey, 91.4% of the respondents declared themselves to be addicted smokers. The results of the survey confirmed that the level of motivation for ceasing smoking was not dependent on the clinical progress of the disease. This means that the smokers who were to undergo a bypass surgery, due to the 3rd or 4th degree ischaemia of lower limbs, are less inclined to look for professional help and cease smoking [18]. The survey conducted in the Canadian centre confirmed that 33.5% of the respondents were smokers during the perioperative period. After the yearly observation of the patients who smoked before the surgery, 41.6% ceased smoking and 58.4% did not do that [23]. The analysis of the survey hereunder did not confirm the impact of social and demographic factors, such as sex, age, education level, on the level of nicotine dependence and motivation for ceasing smoking. The survey conducted by the Canadian centre confirmed that male patients smoked before the surgery more frequently. The sex was also statistically related with the higher ratios of ceasing smoking among women [23]. Ponczek et al. confirmed the impact of social and demographic factors on the level of motivation for ceasing smoking. The authors of that survey conclude that the higher education level, the greater readiness to cease smoking. In addition, that survey confirmed that the degree of nicotine dependence among the respondents with vocational education was greater [24]. The survey conducted by Smeds et al. indicated that 22% of the patients were active smokers before the vascular surgery. The smokers that smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day were less nicotine dependent (p = 0.0001) and more inclined to consider ceasing smoking [25]. The survey hereunder also confirmed that the greater the number of cigarettes smoked a day, the higher the level of nicotine dependence and the lower the motivation for ceasing smoking. In the survey conducted by Walewska et al., it was also confirmed that nicotine dependence increases together with the growth of stress, as a result of which the patient smokes a cigarette and the level of motivation for ceasing smoking decreases [26]. The surveys prove that nicotine is the major\u2014however, not the only\u2014reason for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [27\u201330] and there seems to be a genetic predisposition, which increases the risk in the case of certain patients [31]. COPD develops in the case of 10\u201320% of smokers [32\u201334]. In our surveys, the respondents with a greater number of years of smoking were confirmed to be diagnosed with COPD much more often. To obtain better results, a special attention should be paid to motivating the patient adequately to attempt to cease smoking and refrain from smoking as long as possible. It must be noted that motivation is a dynamic process and can be strengthened or maintained potentially in the case of each patient [22,35]. Our own data indicate that a significant number of patients keep on smoking despite their diagnosis. As ceasing smoking is desirable, all patients should be encouraged to do it [2,36]."

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. The overall sample size was small, so the results of the study cannot be generalized. Additionally, the level of addiction and the motivation to quit smoking may be influenced by other factors that we did not take into account. We believe that the next test should take into account factors, such as financial considerations, free time, stress, and having loved ones who smoke. In another test, the competence of vascular surgeons and vascular nurses in the area of counseling and smoking cessation treatment should be assessed. This will enable the\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 10393 11 of 13\ndevelopment of training programs for doctors and nurses in the effective implementation of the diagnostic protocol and the treatment of nicotine addiction. Despite the limitations, the results of these studies show the magnitude of the problem of nicotine addiction in patients with vascular diseases and can be used to design and implement smoking cessation programs."

The greater the addiction to nicotine, the lower the motivation to quit smoking. Social and demographic factors do not affect the degree of nicotine addiction and the motivation to quit smoking.

            "text": "Based on the surveys and information coming from other researchers, special attention should be paid to the need of implementing comprehensive intervention and prevention measures in the case of patients qualified for vascular surgeries in order to enable the addicted smokers to cease smoking as fast as possible. The smoking cessation programme combined with intensive consultancy and a nicotine substitute therapy should be offered to all patients during the period they are prepared to a surgery. The traditional approaches focused on the postoperative period to rehabilitate and change the patient\u2019s lifestyle. However, the latest evidence proves that the preoperative period is the best time to intervene. Hospitalised patients should have their smoking status identified and recorded systematically and obtain specific help in order to attempt to cease smoking. Smoking in the past and at present should be measured by the use of questionnaires. The purpose of such an approach is to enable the patients to cease smoking before the surgery.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.P.; methodology, R.P. and W.M.-D.; software R.P.; formal analysis, R.P.; resources, R.P.; data curation, R.P. and P.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.P., W.M.-D. and P.J. writing\u2014review and editing, R.P. and W.M.-D.; visualization, R.P., W.M.-D. and R.S\u0301. supervision, R.S\u0301.; project administration, R.P.
