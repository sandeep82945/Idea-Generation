            "text": "Global warming has been a major growing issue in recent decades and will remain so in the coming years. CO2 emissions into the atmosphere have reached excessive levels within the current context. A few years ago, reports announced a concentration of 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere,[1] mainly due to industrial and anthropogenic processes and the use of fossil sources to produce electricity and fuels. A solution is needed to reduce the amount of CO2 released in order to avert the environmental, ecological and societal consequences of heightened CO2 levels. There are different ways to reutilise CO2: microalgae, hydrogen\nproduction to convert captured CO2, [2] photocatalytic[2\u20134] and photoelectrocatalytic[4,5] reduction of CO2 and, finally, the electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR), which is one of the most promising pathways to reduce the amount of CO2 while also producing chemicals and products with added value (Scheme 1). Indeed, the CO2RR is a crucial method to fix the carbon present in the CO2 in the form of fuels and feedstocks to achieve negative overall carbon emission. The CO2 reduction pathways which produce C1, C2 and C3 products have complex mechanisms due to the stability of the CO2 molecule. Energy is needed to carry out the reaction, and the use of a catalyst is required because of the inertness of the substrate resulting in high energy barriers.[6] Indeed, the one-electron reduction is not favourable and requires a sizeable kinetic overvoltage. The overpotential required can be limited with proton-assisted reactions, as shown in Equations (1)\u2013(6).[6] All the potentials are given versus the NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) under standard conditions.\nCO2 \u00fe 2H \u00fe \u00fe 2e !

Homogeneous catalysts take part in the reaction in the same phase as the reactants, while in heterogeneous catalysis the phases are different. There also exist so-called hybrid systems, in which a molecular catalyst is fixed on a conductive support. In this case, the catalyst is heterogeneous in nature and the products obtained and the efficiency of the process strongly depend on the choice of support. This Review summarises and comments on the state-of-the-art reports in the literature for the CO2RR using molecular complexes as the active sites heterogenised on a variety of supports, highlighting the influence and importance of the support and the local medium on CO2RR efficiency. Indeed, heterogeneous catalysts are generally preferable from an industrial point of view because of the simplicity in the design of the reactor and the ease in further separation and handling of the\n[*] Dr. D.

Heterogenisation via immobilisation of molecular complexes in and on the electrode for the CO2RR could lead to an efficient and scalable system, reducing the applied overpotential needed, increasing the current density and boosting the selectivity for a specific CO2RR product(s). Currently, this strategy presents a significant challenge as well as also opportunities to explore new concepts, technologies, industries and research. Supported and immobilised highly active and selective molecular catalysts represent an excellent trade-off strategy. The most recent advances (Table 1) will be described and analysed, focusing on the different supports and their role in the CO2RR efficiency. [8,9]"

High current efficiencies of up to 98 % were reached, corresponding to only low turnover frequencies (TOFs), the value conventionally used to measure the instantaneous efficiency of a catalyst as the number of turnovers per unit of time and active site,[12] of between 2 and 9 per hour at room temperature.[13] Again, using nickel as the metal and focussing on cyclam complexes, Kubiak and co-workers studied a highly efficient system for the production of CO employing an unsubstituted Ni(cyclam) complex, showing the possibility for attenuation of the activity through methyl substituents on the amine groups of the cyclam ring. Iron-based molecular complexes are often used to catalyse CO2RR, especially iron(0) porphyrins (tetraphenylporphyrin, TPP) can work as suitable catalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO.\n[14] In addition to these non-noble metals, a more expensive metal such as rhenium, typically with a bipyridine ligand, can also be used to produce CO and, in some instances and under particular conditions, formate with high efficiency and selectivity.[15\u201317] Conversely, formate is obtained with high selectivity and efficiency by employing molecular catalysts containing rhodium (Rh)[18, 19] or iridium (Ir).[20, 21]"

            "text": "In order to advance the application of molecular catalysts, systems are needed that can be upscaled and implemented in industrial reactors.[22,23] For this reason, scientific research is moving toward the development of solid hybrid systems. In this section we will pay particular attention to the immobilisation of active molecular species on support materials and their influence on the CO2RR. Several support materials are used such as carbon-based supports, titania-based supports, and polymer-ion gels. Moreover, multiple strategies of immobilisation can be exploited to tune the properties of the heterogeneous system. The method of immobilisation also influences the performance and efficiency of the system. Different strategies are described in the literature, such as grafting via covalent bonding,[24\u201326] immobilisation via weak interactions and physical adsorption,[27\u201329] and integration of the molecular complexes into the porous support structure.[17,30\u201332] Each strategy has its own merits and drawbacks. The easiest immobilisation method employs physical adsorption through noncovalent interactions such as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking or electrostatic interactions. The main advantage of this approach is the ease and the rapidness of the technique. Indeed, no significant additional synthetic steps are needed.[33\u201336] High amounts of molecular complexes can be loaded to achieve a high mass activity and/or area activity of the material amplifying the advantage of a high turnover frequency. However, such noncovalent interactions are well known to be comparatively weak, and the active sites may accordingly easily leach out and detach from the support after being exposed to solvents and/or a harsh environment.[33] A more rigorous strategy for immobilisation is to form a covalent bond or bonds between the molecular complex and the support. This scenario often consists of an initial functionalisation of either the support or the ligand, leading to a lengthier and more complex preparation process. Several functional moieties can be utilised to graft complexes, such as diazonium,[37] phosphonic acid,[38] and thiol groups.[39] This kind of grafting is more durable and robust than the noncovalent grafting, but on the other hand, more than one layer of catalyst is often attached unintentionally, leading to insulation and mass transfer issues.[40] Another strategy described here employs direct immobilisation of molecular complexes inside covalent organic frameworks (COFs) or metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs).[41] These organic/inorganic frameworks can be exploited as supports in two ways:\nScheme 1.

The porosity of the 3D structures also allows high loadings of active sites, a key benefit of this approach.[42] The same considerations as for the chemical bonding immobilisation strategies also apply. In this case, the synthesis and insertion of the modified linker within the framework might be a complicated procedure. There also exist strategies whereby catalysts can avoid any interaction with the support: for example, catalysts can be trapped in a polymer matrix in gel form.[43] In all these strategies, the support employed plays a fundamental role in the global activity of the catalyst, since it is always present in a heterogeneous system.[44] There are different properties which have significant impact: porosity (which can improve the mass transfer), the degree of the hierarchy of the porosity, and the conductivity (which improves the transfer of electrons). Several supports have already been studied and described in the literature to tune these properties and improve the system\u2019s efficiency. Carbon materials in all their possible forms are the most commonly used supports, mainly on account of their conductivity. Among these, carbon nanotubes[35,44\u201347] are the most commonly used, followed by carbon cloth,[34, 48, 49] graphene,[50\u201353] and carbon materials derived from sacrificial MOF skeletons.[17,54] Widely used inorganic materials include titania supports,[38, 55, 56] where their porosity is exploited to improve mass transfer. The most relevant supports described in this article are summarised in Figure 1."

Their high electrical conductivity makes them one of the first choices as a support for heterogeneous catalysts for the CO2RR. Different features and parameters of the carbon support need to be considered to enhance the catalytic activity. Firstly, the aforementioned electrical conductivity is needed to improve the total charge passing through the system. Secondly, the high surface area and the porosity serve to avoid mass transfer problems caused by the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes and tend to typically enable immobilisation of a higher number of active sites. Finally, hydrophobicity[54] has a crucial role in trapping the gas and increasing the concentration of CO2 in the vicinity of the electrode.[60] The chemical structure and the morphology of the carbon support significantly impact the catalytic performance (Figure 2).[61] Recently, the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has achieved widespread popularity.

Although their main drawback is their inherent catalytic activity for the undesirable proton reduction reaction,[27,46] they are widely employed because of their aforementioned properties. Several catalysts have been tested for CO2 electroreduction, and the molecular catalysts heterogenised using CNTs showed improved performances in all cases. The influence of CNTs acting as the support for the catalyst in enhancing the activity and selectivity for the CO2RR has been attributed to: 1) the presence of surface functional groups such as OH, NH, and -pyridine, which can affect the surrounding electron densities;[62, 63] 2) the influence of the curvature of the CNTs in favouring different products at different overpotentials by altering the interactions between catalysts and CNTs;[44, 64] and 3) the microporosity of the CNTs influencing the mass transport and the concentration of CO2 present at the surface and in contact with the catalyst, thereby impacting the catalytic activity.[65]\nStarting with the importance of the chemical modification of the support, Zhu et al.,[67] covalently grafted a cobalt porphyrin (CoPP) on CNTs. The CNTs were previously functionalised to contain hydroxyl groups which made up 3.06 % of their total weight. A theoretical monolayer of CoPP was added to the CNTs and detected via inductively coupled plasma (ICP), which indicated a loading of 10 wt% of CoPP. The successful linkage of the molecular complexes with the CNTs was proved by spectroscopic analysis. The hybrid electrode, denoted CoPP@CNT, was tested for the CO2RR. The sample was stable at all potentials investigated, reaching up to 90% faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO and around 6 mA cm 2 at 0.65 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in aqueous media. When compared with the CoPP molecular complexes immobilised on CNTs without OH groups, this result shows a significant improvement in terms of current density, thus proving the importance of the hydroxyl functionalisation in enabling the covalent grafting. The OH functionalisation dramatically enhances the loading of the immobilised molecular complex and avoids agglomeration on the surface, which is likely to limit the mass transport and negatively influence overall efficiency.[67] The same research group also investigated a\ndifferent mode of functionalisation on the CNT support.[63] A pyridine moiety was appended to the surface of the CNT (py-CNT), exploiting the reduction reaction of diazonium species. The N atoms on the pyridine were detected by Raman spectroscopy and XPS measurements (Figure 3a,b). This time, the support was then loaded with a certain amount of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) by axial coordination through a bond between the Co centre in CoPc and the nitrogen atom in the py-CNT. Comparing the bare CoPc, the CoPC@CNTs, and the CoPc@py-CNTs, the latter showed the highest current density: 10 mAcm 2 at 0.73 V vs. RHE, corresponding to a FE for CO of more than 90 %. Hu et al. chose to immobilise cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) on carbon nanotubes. [34] This work demonstrated the potential of the heterogenisation process to enable working in aqueous media, as well as the importance of the support structure in influencing the reaction mechanism and the activity of the catalyst itself. The current reached was 3.2 mAcm 2 with a good CO FE of around 80 % throughout a 4 h bulk electrolysis experiment, at an applied potential of 1.35 V vs. SCE. CoTPP, after immobilisation, can activate CO2 and produce CO at low applied overpotentials. Under homogeneous conditions in DMF, two electrons are needed to activate and reduce CO2 with [Co\n0TPP]2 , but this requires high applied overpotentials that lead to deactivation. In this case, the immobilisation plays a fundamental role in the formation of the active species with high activity for CO production.[34] As previously mentioned, the curvature of the CNTs is a crucial feature. Recent work by Marianov et al.[68] highlights the importance of a mechanismdriven design of heterogeneous catalysts. The study focused on cobalt porphyrin electrografted onto a carbon cloth to obtain a stable system. The authors indicate the critical importance of focusing on the materials used for the support which must provide efficient delivery of electrons to the catalyst without compromising its stability. In this way, the\nFigure 3. a) Raman spectrum of py-CNT and pristine CNT and b) Co 2p spectra of free-standing CoPc, CoPc-CNT, and CoPc-py-CNT. c) Tafel plots for CoPc-CNT and CoPc-py-CNT at a CoPc loading of 5 nmolcm 2 and d) proposed mechanism for CO2 electroreduction to CO over a catalyst consisting of immobilised CoPc on CNT.

The system is likely to agglomerate and reduce the amount of available active catalyst.\nUsing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the Co(TPP)/CNTs system was studied. [35] MWCNTs and SWCNTs were used, with diameters of 60/130 \u00c5 and 12/15 \u00c5, respectively, and distinct surface areas. Although MWCNTs are logically assumed to be an inferior support, since their surface area is less than that of SWCNTs, similar current densities are obtained from both supports, and higher FEs and higher TOFs are, in fact, obtained for the Co(TPP)/MWCNTs system when the same amount of catalyst is loaded. Thus, the authors claim that the aggregation of catalysts on the surface is probably more favourable on the SWCNTs. This difference in reactivity between the systems based on the two different supports has been attributed to the lower curvatures of the MWCNT samples. This is because the porphyrin ring of Co(TPP) enables dimerization of the molecule, which facilitates intraspecies \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions as well as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions to the support. This kind of dimerisation may therefore provoke competition between the Co(TPP)/CNTs interactions and the Co(TPP) Co(TPP) intermolecular interactions.[64] Interestingly, the current density increases further when a more cathodic potential is applied for the CoPc@py@CNTs than for the CoPc@CNTs. A mechanism for the reaction was also proposed based on the calculated Tafel plots (Figure 3c). The Tafel slope of the CoPc@py@CNTs is around 60 mV dec 1 less than for the nonfunctionalised system, with transport limitation issues occurring. Both systems have the same rate-determining step (RDS), which is shown to be the binding of CO2 (Figure 3d). Nevertheless, coordination between Co and N is likely to be stronger than the van der Waals (vdW) interactions between CoPC molecules themselves. Concerning these molecules, the coordination to the metal centre increases the charge density of the system, increasing the nucleophilicity of the metal centre, allowing it to more strongly bind CO2, which is the rate-determining step (RDS), and this, therefore, promotes the CO2RR.\n[63] It has been further shown by Zhang et al. that the form of the carbon support drastically influences the catalytic activity and the selectivity.[45] They used CoPc as the catalyst loaded on reduced graphene oxide (RGO), carbon black (CB), and finally on CNTs. Lower current densities were found for the RGO and CB systems when the same amount of catalyst was loaded. Moreover, the FE toward CO with the CNTs was 10 % higher than with the other supports. Finally, experiments testing the stability of the system were also performed, showing that the RGO and CB systems have lower catalytic stability than CNTs.[45] Thus, it was clear that an enhanced catalytic performance could be achieved by using CNTs. In this study, the CNTs were of a higher graphitic degree than the other two supports employed. The higher graphitic degree is likely\nto favour the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with the catalyst and facilitate the electron transfer.[69]\nA similar approach was followed by Karapinar et al.[29] where a polymer of Cu phthalocyanine (CuPolyPC) was coated on CNTs and carbon nanofiber (CNF). While CuPolyPC@CNT reached around 85% FE for CO and a current density of 7.5 mAcm 2 at 0.7 V vs. RHE, CuPolyPC@CNF generated mostly H2 with a lower current density. This difference was attributed to the higher surface area, the higher electrical conductivity of CNTs, and a better interface of the Cu active sites attached to the CNTs. Wang et al. [35] prepared a supported catalyst bearing a cobalt quaterpyridine (qpy) at the surface of MWCNTs. An ink was readily prepared by adding [Co(qpy)]2+ to the MWCNTs suspension. The ink was then drop-cast onto different carbon supports. The concentration of the active complex on the electrode was quantified electrochemically, showing a lower quantity of the active species than the catalyst loaded directly. The lower active concentration is likely provoked by the high amount of catalyst loaded into the porous framework, thus leading to saturation and agglomeration. The electrode produces CO with a FE close to 100 % at an applied potential of 0.53 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M NaHCO3, reaching the best current density of 11.9 mAcm 2 for 8.5 nmol cm 2 of loading. The supported system competes well with the best molecular catalysts assayed in water for the CO2RR.\n[35] It therefore successfully exploits the advantages of the adsorption of [Co(qpy)]2+ on the surface of the carbon support, such as stability and activity in aqueous media. In work from the same research group, an iron-based molecular complex was immobilised on the surface of the CNTs, exploiting a pyrene moiety to anchor it to the carbon support via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions. This approach enabled the use of the complex in aqueous media for the CO2RR to CO with 96 % FE, thanks to the heterogenisation of the catalyst.[70] In another system, Reddu et al.[71] studied a disubstituted quaterpyridine-based cobalt complex stacked onto MWCNTs. The hybrid system was shown to be stable over 20 hours with production of only CO and 6.7 mAcm 2 current density at a potential of 0.65 V vs. RHE. This outstanding performance is explained by the author as coming from a contribution of the MWCNTs used as a support lending stability to the system as a whole, while appended COOH groups may improve the stability of the intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activity at low overpotential.[71] These last four works highlight the versatility of the strategy, being efficient with different catalysts. Nickel cyclam is another well-known molecular catalyst, active for the CO2RR. However, it often necessitates the employment of a Hg electrode. Pugliese et al.[27] developed a novel nickel cyclam molecular complex with an appended pyrene moiety to immobilise the active site on CNTs and investigated its efficiency for the CO2RR without involving any mercury electrodes. The molecular complex was shown to be very selective for CO, with around 96 % FE in DMF/H2O media, but, as shown previously, only a low current was obtained with a glassy carbon electrode. Once immobilised through noncovalent interactions on the surface of the MWCNTs, the system retains its selectivity\nAngewandte ChemieReviews\nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2022, 61, e202206399 (8 of 18) \u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1002/anie.202206399 by T echnical U niversity E indhoven, W iley O nline L ibrary on [11/10/2022].

This remarkable result highlights the stable and efficient interaction of the complex with the MWCNTs, which causes the active conformation of the complex to be favoured. The large surface area and the organisation of the MWCNT support structure enhance the properties of the electroactive sites. The same type of molecular complex was studied by Forget et al.[72] where nickel cyclam was covalently attached to a gold and a glassy carbon electrode through C- and N-functionalisation of the molecular complex. Interestingly the C-functionalised complex shows improved electrocatalytic properties in water, particularly in terms of overpotential, when compared to the above-mentioned study.\nThe use of more porous supports with enhanced structuration may, in this case, improve the system even further.[27] A study of the influence of different substrates was also carried out by Birdja et al.[73] In this case, an indium(III) protoporphyrin (InPP), selective for formic acid production, was heterogenised on different substrates to investigate their influence. Moreover, the surface of the supports was also modified by electrochemical and plasma methods. Basal-plane pyrolytic graphite (PG), glassy carbon (GC), and boron-doped diamond (BDD) supports were used with and without pretreatment. The heterogenisation process was done by drop-casting the solution of the molecular complex on the surface of the substrate, and the molecular complex was adsorbed through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions, and was kept constant in all the systems. After controlledpotential electrolysis, the PG substrate was shown to have the most efficient FE for HCOOH and current density, reaching almost 100 % of FE and 17 mAcm 2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE. The current density was normalised against the indium content. Indeed, the substrates have different abilities to heterogenise the molecular complex. It was shown that PG could host a higher amount of InPP and have a higher saturation limit than the other substrates. Interestingly, a higher amount of H2 was detected using InPP-GC than with InPP-PG. In addition, a higher amount of CO2 was consumed by the PG system. This feature is attributed to the more efficient mass transfer thanks to the higher porosity of PG compared to that of GC or BDD. The GC substrate shows the lowest performance, likely because of its poor gas permeability and its poor crystallinity. Also, the low efficiency of GC for CO2RR is attributed to its higher activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than PG and BDD. The study proves the influence of the substrate\u2019s morphology, porosity, crystallinity, and HER activity on CO2RR efficiency.\nThe introduction of dopants into the carbon substrate was also investigated by Wang et al.[74] In this work, graphitic sulfoxide and carboxyl dopants of graphene are likely to improve the molecular complex\u2019s binding affinity through axial coordination, which enhances the CO2RR of the active site. A cobalt-based naphthalocyanine was used (NapCo), which already has a strong capability for \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking with the carbon matrix. Moreover, the coordination with the dopants boosts the immobilisation of the catalyst as well as\nthe CO2RR itself. The sulfoxide dopants also promote the electron transfer between the substrate and the active sites when compared to carboxyl dopants. The system shows 97 % FE for CO at 0.8 V vs. RHE for the NapCo immobilised on the sulfoxide-doped graphene in aqueous media. The TOF was increased by a factor of 3 compared to the carboxyl dopant.\nIn addition to doping and functionalisation of the carbon matrix, Liang et al.[75] studied the influence of defects in the graphene substrate. Cobalt phthalocyanine was used again as a molecular complex and immobilised on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). First, the rGO was mixed with dicyandiamide and then a N-removal strategy allowed the introduction of defects. After the treatments, the graphene structure was not modified, as seen in SEM and TEM images; however, significant differences were nonetheless highlighted between the bare rGO and the treated one (DrGO). Raman spectroscopy showed an increased disorder in the DrGO, along with a higher amount of amorphous carbon. EPR spectroscopy further confirmed the presence of broken bonds, localised on the defects. The two rGOs were impregnated with a solution of the molecular complex in order to carry out the immobilisation. Interestingly, UV/ Vis spectroscopy showed a more significant redshift of the Q bands for the DrGO, which is caused by a more substantial charge transfer between the matrix and CoPc, resulting in better \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions. XPS highlighted the higher electronic communication between active sites and substrate on the DrGO. Electrochemical characterisation of DrGOCoPC showed the highest current density, 30 mAcm 2, at 0.8 V vs. RHE with 90% FE for CO in aqueous media. The DrGO leads to better efficiency and activity than the rGO and is an outstanding system compared to other heterogeneous systems employing Co or other metal active sites. Since a bare DrGO leads to poor selectivity toward CO2 reduction products, the enhancement in activity of DrGO-CoPC is attributed to the superior electron communication, which is likely to favour the kinetics of the CO2 reduction process. Indeed, the CVs show that the Co2+ /Co+ wave, which is one critical step in the CO2 reduction catalytic cycle at the Co centre, is positively shifted when CoPC is immobilised on DrGO, suggesting that the process is accelerated. This process acceleration leads to an improved electrochemical CO2RR performance. Once more, the evident influence of the substrate in the overall activity and efficiency of the hybrid system is highlighted.\nAs introduced previously, mass transfer is important for maintaining the CO2 concentration on the surface of the catalyst, particularly in water, where the solubility of CO2 is low compared to that in other media such as organic solvents and ionic liquids.[76] The microporosity of the support has been proven to be crucial in improving the mass transfer.[77] Guo et al. studied a nickel molecular catalyst immobilised within various different substrates to understand the key phenomena through experiments and theoretical calculations. Indeed, it has been shown that the CO2 physical adsorption capacity and current density increase as the micropore volume is increased. The theoretical calculations demonstrate that the CO2 adsorption step is the\nAngewandte ChemieReviews\nAngew. Chem. Int.

This example highlights the impact of the porous structure on the catalytic activity while the electronic and chemical structures are controlled. Balamurugan et al.[50] used a Cu-based molecular complex immobilised in a graphitised mesoporous carbon (GMC) in this context. The driving force of the immobilisation was the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between the support and the complex, which were demonstrated by a decrease of the typical UV/Vis adsorption band of the Cu complex solution with and without the GMC. The copper molecular complex is known to enhance the formation of C2 products when it is dimerised. To investigate the influence of the support, the dimeric complex was immobilised on MWCNTs, graphene oxide, and GMC, and the catalytic activity in each case was studied. In CO2saturated media, LSVs show a higher current density and a clearer catalytic wave with GMC as the support. The hybrid CuGMC system shows the highest FE for C2 products, namely 42% for ethylene at 1.278 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KCl. The graphene oxide and MWCNTs systems exhibited lower selectivity for C2 products and higher methane production, with a decreased total selectivity for CO2 reduction products, in fact favouring the HER. Thus, the porosity influences and improves the C C coupling during CO2RR. Indeed, the authors put forward that the local pH could be higher inside the pores and therefore favour the production of C2 products, which has already been demonstrated for nanoporous copper[78] and proven by theoretical calculation. It was found that increasing the rotation speed during electrochemical studies (using a rotation-ring disk electrode) leads to a decrease in C2 and methane production by instead favouring CO and H2 production.\nAnother example where the selectivity and efficiency for CO2RR were improved by the support is shown by Grammatico et al.[17] In their work, the well-known complex [Re(bpy)(CO)3(Cl)], commonly abbreviated as Re(bpy), was immobilised into the pores of a novel conductive porous electrode. Interestingly, due to the hierarchical porosity, the molecular complex was successfully fixed within the pores of the carbon material as is directly without any synthetic modification, which often leads to practical issues and modification of the electronic properties of the complex. The carbon materials were synthesised using a ZIF-8 MOF as a carbon template, which had been crystallised around PS spheres and possessed a hierarchical porosity on scales ranging from micro-/meso- to macropores, thereby conferring a high surface area. The successful loading of the Re complex was proven by several techniques, giving a large value for the area density of electroactive species of 20 nmol cm 2, in line with previous results in a similar system.[28] The system showed high selectivity toward CO2 reduction products in a water/ionic liquid electrolyte. In the LSV in the CO2-saturated system, a catalytic wave was detected with an onset potential of 1.55 V vs. Fc/Fc+ which was not present under N2 atmosphere. Interestingly the selectivity could be tuned by changing the applied potential. Indeed, around 80 % FE for CO was obtained with an applied potential of 1.75 V vs. Fc/Fc+, while with the more\ncathodic potential of 2.05 V vs. Fc/Fc+ almost 80 % FE for HCOOH was obtained. Current densities span from 2 to 11 mA cm 2 across the potentials investigated. The formate production was not anticipated, because Re(bpy) is typically selective for CO in organic solvents; furthermore, when Re(bpy) was solubilised in the water/ionic liquid media and a CPE experiment was run, H2 was the main product detected. This demonstrates clearly the impact of the solid support on the activity and selectivity of the system. The activity is most likely boosted by the hydrophobic local environment of the pores where CO2 is taken up, increasing its local concentration. Moreover, mass transfer is less hindered, due to the high porosity. More recently, Yang et al.[79] developed a MOF-derived Cu@Cu2O by using the same strategy. First, the Cu-BTC catalyst was obtained and afterwards a high-temperature treatment was carried out to obtain the final Cu@Cu2O nitrogen-doped carbon. The asprepared carbon particles with their porosity are likely to inhibit the aggregation of the catalyst and thus enhance the CO2 adsorption, thereby lowering the CO2RR energetic barrier. Moreover, a higher amount of mesopores is seen at high calcination temperature when compared to the CuBTC. However, the surface area decreases after the calcination process due to the destruction of the Cu-BTC structure. The Cu@Cu2O samples after calcination were tested for CO2 electroreduction and showed outstanding selectivity for MeOH (FE of 45%) at 0.7 V vs. RHE. Methanol formation is likely due to the moderate CO* binding energy and the strong adsorption strength for H*, promoting alcohol production. The stability of the catalyst is noteworthy: the selectivity is maintained over 10 hours CPE, with only slightly decreasing current. This enhanced stability is attributed to the protection of the active species Cu+/Cu0 by the Cu-BTC carbon shell.[79]"

            "text": "MOFs and COFs are often used as porous supports to heterogenise molecular complexes. Indeed, in contrast to carbon-based materials, MOFs and COFs both provide highly ordered porous networks that are likely to enhance permeation of the electrolyte. Although electron transport is the limiting factor in using MOFs and COFs, the ability of thin films of MOFs and COFs to facilitate charge transfer has recently been reported (Figure 4).\nThus, having an organic framework with redox-active molecular complexes as linkers confers several advantages: high surface area and tuneable porosity of the support, hierarchical porosity to enhance mass transfer properties, easy elemental and physical characterisation both pre- and post-catalysis, easier avoidance of aggregation and deactivation processes, and high loadings of electroactive species.[82\u201384] This cursory overview will not cover all of the literature on this branch of CO2RR research, but the most influential papers will be discussed (Figure 4). Since the earliest reports[85\u201387] of employing MOFs for CO2RR photocatalysis by Wang et al.[88] in 2011, incorporating Ir, Re, and Ru complexes into a UiO-67 framework, and then for\nAngewandte ChemieReviews\nAngew.

[89] in 2012, incorporating copper directly within the structure of the Cu3(BTC)2 framework, a lot of progress has occurred over the past decade towards incorporating well-established molecular CO2RR catalysts based on earth-abundant first-row transition metals into MOF supports. In 2015, Hod et al.[82] incorporated the well-known Fe porphyrin into a MOF and the system was then studied in the form of a thin-film immobilised on an electrode. The chosen non-metalated porphyrin, MOF-525, has good porosity and outstanding chemical stability for electrochemical studies. MOF-525 was metalated by post-synthesis modification, reaching an amount of catalyst on the surface three orders of magnitude higher than the previously reported heterogenised molecular complex.[82] Cyclic voltammetry analysis of Fe_MOF-525 shows an increase in current density in CO2-saturated solution compared to that under a N2 atmosphere. The hybrid system reaches a current density of 2.3 mAcm 2 in acetonitrile, achieving 54 % FE for CO at 1.3 V vs. NHE. The overall efficiency was boosted by adding a weak acid, as was previously reported for homogeneous systems. Indeed, in this case the current density was increased to 5.9 mAcm 2 with an associated sevenfold increase in CO production at the same potential after 3.2 hours of bulk electrolysis. The addition of acid also reinforces the electrode\u2019s stability. The authors then compared the homogeneous complex with the hybrid system, pointing out a limitation of the Fe_MOF-525 in terms of charge diffusion rather than in terms of the molecular-scale kinetics of the CO2RR. Indeed, the hybrid electrode shows a 16-times lower TOF than that of the homogeneous system, but with still two-thirds of the current density, signifying the concentration and immobilisation of the molecular complex on the surface. This work was one of the first attempts to immobilise a molecular complex within a porous MOF structure. Although the system suffers from\nlimited charge diffusion, it does serve to open the way towards introducing active sites directly as linkers within MOF structures.\nIn 2018, Wang et al.[81] prepared a series of metalloporphyrins integrated into a MOF structure with a polyoxometalate. Among all the metals studied (cobalt, iron, nickel, and zinc), the cobalt-based porphyrin within the MOF shows the lowest required overpotential for catalysis by LSV in a CO2-saturated atmosphere. Thus, the CoPMOF system represented the major focus of the study. A FE of 98.7 % for CO production was achieved for an applied potential of 0.8 V vs. RHE in aqueous media, the highest so far among reported MOFs. A current density of around 17 mA cm 2 was obtained, with good stability over 36 hours of electrolysis. The fact that Co-PMOF shows the lowest overpotential requirement is taken to indicate favourable kinetics, which may be attributed to more efficient charge transfer and a higher active surface area. The excellent performances for the CO2RR are likely to be influenced by the higher efficiencies of the Co-PMOF for both proton and electron transfer compared to Co-MOF. Indeed, the polyoxometalate is an excellent electron storage system which acts to facilitate the charge transfer. DFT calculations confirm that on bare polyoxometalate (POM) and Co-MOF, the RDS for CO2RR is the formation of adsorbed intermediates with high free energies. The required (free) energy is decreased when the POM and the Co-MOF are assembled. Thus, these effects are likely due to the efficient synergistic electronic effect of the POM and the central Co active site. The electronic communication of the POM and the porphyrin within the support MOF structure allows for oriented transport of electrons within the channel, with the result that the MOF is conductive for the transfer of multiple electrons to undergo electrochemical reactions.\nLikewise, intensive research on the application of COFs as supports for noble-metal-free molecular CO2RR catalysts has been ongoing in recent years, including that by Yaghi\u2019s group, one of the groups which pioneered reticular chemistry.[90] Yao et al.[91] pondered combining and testing the CO2 storage properties of a COF system with the CO2 electroreduction features of a Co-based molecular complex embedded within the COF structure. A phthalocyanine boronate COF was prepared, and cobalt was employed in the metal active site for the CO2RR. First, the CO2 storage properties were tested by evaluating the capability of the material to adsorb certain amounts of CO2. A trend was identified which indicated the preferable adsorption of CO2 onto the walls of the pores at lower concentrations. At higher concentrations, CO2 was also found in the centre of the catalytic system. It was deduced that the size of the pores in the COF plays a key role: indeed, a smaller pore size COF is more suitable at normal (1 atm) CO2 pressure, whereas at higher pressure, CO2 will be distributed uniformly within the pores. Based on this preliminary study, the authors chose a Co-Pc-PBBA (1,4-phenylenebisboronic acid) COF as the electrode for the CO2 reduction because of its smaller pore size. Based on the calculations, the onset potential for CO2 reduction of Co-Pc-PBBA is only 0.30 V, lower than that of the bare Co-porphyrin (0.46 V); this is\nAngewandte ChemieReviews\nAngew. Chem. Int.

The synergy between the storage and reduction features allows this material to realise competitive performances, achieving a 97.7-times higher local concentration of CO2 present around the active sites than in conventional aqueous systems. The high local concentration of CO2 decreases the barriers to the electroreduction reaction, resulting in a lower overpotential requirement and enhanced productivity thanks to the porous, crystalline framework containing the heterogenised molecular complex. Lin et al.[92] demonstrated that incorporating a catalytic cobalt-based porphyrin into COFs with copper units is likely to be responsible for enhancing the activity and selectivity for CO of the system. COF-366-Co was synthesised with Co-porphyrin active sites, which corresponded to 4% of the total cobalt porphyrin present in the whole system. For this system, the current density was found to increase drastically under a CO2 atmosphere in comparison with the bare carbon electrode, with catalytic onset potential of 0.42 V vs. RHE in neutral aqueous medium. 90% FE for CO was detected at 0.67 V vs. RHE for a current density of 80 mA per milligram of cobalt. Moreover, an improvement is observed in the selectivity for CO compared with the molecular system. Long-term stability experiments were carried out over 24 hours, showing good stability and significant production of CO over the course of the experiment. This results in substantial improvements in the TOF and TON when normalised to the quantity of molecular cobalt porphyrin. Interestingly, the COF retained its crystalline structure and morphology with no agglomerated Co nanoparticles detected. Hence, the system could be recovered and reused up to five times by the authors. The influence of the framework\u2019s porosity was further investigated by the replacement of the BDA (1,4- benzenedicarboxaldehyde) linker with a BPDA (biphenyl 4,4\u2019-dicarboxaldehyde), which increased the framework\u2019s porosity. In fact, the number of electroactive sites detected doubled after this change, probably because the new framework\u2019s sites are more accessible electrochemically and chemically. Once the porosity was tuned and the catalytic activity improved, Lin et al. then aimed to further improve the proportion of active sites, the quantity of which is thought to be limited by the poor electrochemical contact between the COF and the electrode. Thus, the morphology of the COF was modified by growing highly oriented thin films on the electrode. The COF thin-film was characterised by a higher conductivity, higher currents, and a higher diffusion coefficient of the system overall compared to the previous study. Also, the electrocatalytic efficiency was improved under the same conditions: a sevenfold increase in TOF and a higher current density with 86 % FE for CO were observed. Additionally, the catalytic mechanism of the Co porphyrin was found to be altered by its immobilisation within the COF structure. This study therefore shows a proof of concept of an efficient hybrid system realised by mixing the features of both molecular complexes and heterogeneous systems in order to promote and control the reduction of CO2, particularly in aqueous media and using sustainable electrical energy sources.[92] From these studies it has been elucidated that when molecular complexes are loaded on COFs, the mobility of charge carriers becomes another key point. Much effort has been invested already on optimising the organic ligands employed in order to tune the activity and selectivity when molecular complexes are incorporated. However, it is important to consider the possibility of adjusting the functionalisation of the COF\u2019s organic structural linkers in order to optimise them for CO2 electroreduction while not modifying the electronic structure close to the active sites. Diercks et al.[58] proposed a series of COFs with different electron-withdrawing groups in the support, which should alter the reactivity of the central active sites. In this case, again, a Co-based porphyrin was chosen as the molecular complex. The COF was orientally grown on a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite surface so that it would have good contact with the substrate and many accessible Co active sites. Previous studies have shown that the mechanism of CO2 reduction with Co-porphyrin proceeds through an initial reduction of CoII to CoI;[93] therefore, the authors decided to functionalise the COF\u2019s linker species with electron-withdrawing groups to facilitate reduction of the Co centres. CO2 sorption tests were carried out to exclude the possibility of electrochemical methods causing an increased storage of CO2. In addition, XAS analysis proved the influence of the linker functionalisation on the electronic structure of the metal centre. CPE of the COF-Co with various functionalisation was carried out at 0.67 V vs. RHE, and a trend was found with XAS and CV experiments. The electron-withdrawing moieties improve the catalytic behaviour of the systems, and the current density from CO formation increases from 45 mAmg 1 for COF-366-Co with no functionalisation on the BDA (2,5- dimethoxyterepthaldehyde) to 65 mAmg 1 for COF-366-FCo, where one hydrogen atom is replaced with a fluorine atom. However, when all hydrogens are replaced with fluorine, an inverted trend is seen, likely due to the high hydrophobicity of the perfluorinated system, which precludes electrolyte permeation.[93] To conclude, this study represents another example of a molecular complex immobilised within a porous, crystalline structure that can be engineered further at the molecular level. This molecular engineering allows the authors to manipulate the electronic structure of the overall system without directly modifying the electronic of the metal centre, which often leads to decreased activity. This last example shows the importance of engineering defects into polymeric organic networks (PONs), such as MOFs and COFs, to develop catalytic materials for the CO2RR. Phthalic anhydride was used as a co-monomer for the defect-containing polymeric cobalt phthalocyanine (D-P-CoPC), as it generates defects on the backbone structure. UV/Vis studies and EXAFS show the different behaviours of the defect-containing and the defectfree COF in terms of promoting the surface binding of CO2 molecules and controlling the electronic character of the Co within the framework. Higher current densities were noted in the LSVs at 0.8 V vs. RHE for the defect-containing COF. The FE for CO at 0.61 V vs. RHE was increased by a factor of 2, up to 97 % when comparing the defect-\nAngewandte ChemieReviews\nAngew. Chem. Int.

The presence of defects could then be tuned by changing the amount of phthalic anhydride to demonstrate their influence on the CO2RR. Indeed, a higher number of defects leads to higher CO current density and an extended stable lifetime, attributed to the tuning of the electronic character of the Co phthalocyanine framework and the stronger surface binding of CO2.\n[80] As a final note on COFs, another recent article from 2021 by Zhang et al.[94] focusing on photocatalytic CO2 reduction uncovers the possibility of post-synthetic metalation into COF systems to construct the molecular catalyst active sites, similar to that previously discussed for MOFs. This is achieved by clever design of the COF, selection of the metal and of its complementary bis-chelate ligand. Although the systems investigated by Zhang et al. were neither designed for nor investigated under electrocatalytic conditions, such advances in methodology for the incorporation of molecular catalysts within COFs represent exciting progress in the field, hopefully enabling advantages similar to those seen by Hod et al.[82] for their MOF-based system."

            "text": "Along with carbon-based materials, titanium dioxide has been widely used in the last two decades as a support for electrochemical applications and the CO2RR owing to 1) its stability for electrocatalysis and 2) its electronic conductivity. Unlike carbon, titanium dioxide has more substantial synergistic effects when employed for the CO2RR with metals. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is mainly used in the form of powder, nanoparticles, or different nanostructures, such as nanotubes (Figure 5).[97]\nDFT studies have confirmed the presence of active sites for the adsorption and activation of CO2 at the interface between the titanium oxide and the metal active sites. The structure of the oxide support opens new pathways for the reduction of CO2. Regardless of the products formed (metal-dependent), the intermediates are expected to bind through the oxygen, thanks to the high affinity of titanium.[98] Moreover, the crystallinity of the titania has also been proven to be a crucial factor.[57] Gu et al. prepared different titanium nanoparticles by a sol\u2013gel method and calcined them at different temperatures to enhance their crystallinity. The different nanoparticles were then deposited on FTO glasses and a solution of a cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTTP) was dropcast onto them. Indeed, the titanium oxide calcined at 200 and 400 \u00b0C shows anatase as the crystalline phase, whereas samples calcined at 800 \u00b0C presents a pure rutile structure and intermediate temperature calcination gives a mixed crystalline phase. The samples were studied under cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. An increase of current density at 1.35 V vs. SHE was noted after purging with CO2. A characteristic peak of the CoTPP complex proves the presence of the active site and the poor activity of the bare TiO2. However, the CoTPP added to the TiO2 obtained after calcination at 800 \u00b0C shows the lowest current density. Based on these observations, the authors suggest that when the CoTPP loading is kept constant, the variation in the electrocatalytic performances is related to the support and its calcination treatment. The two high calcination temperatures seem to affect the efficiency of the system negatively. The lower efficiency of the system calcined at a higher temperature was caused by the lower surface coverage of active sites. The CoTPP dropcast on the titania calcined at 200 \u00b0C reaches a coverage five times larger than that dropcast on the titania treated at 800 \u00b0C. The faradaic efficiency for CO, turnover number, and current density follow the same trend from 200 to 800 \u00b0C. Likewise, the support is shown to be more active in its anatase crystalline phase for photocatalytic activity. However, although\nFigure 5. a) The effect of the TiO2 support for the immobilisation of the molecular catalyst cobalt porphyrin on CO2 electroreduction.

For this reason, the effect of carbon was investigated by synthesising both carbon-doped and carbon-free titania. The study reports the increase in conductivity and, therefore, current density for the system where carbon was present. Although titania was shown not to be a factor in influencing the CO2 reduction mechanism, it does affect the conductivity of the system when the anatase phase and carbonaceous species are present. It also increases the effect of diffusion, as shown in the Tafel plot slopes. Hence, the fastest electron transfer and the best performances are achieved with carbon-doped titania systems.[95] In addition to the crystalline phase, analogous to the carbon-based materials, the titania morphology and structure are fundamentally important in determining its properties. Indeed, Gu et al.[96] compared titania nanotubes (TNT) and Ti foil as supports for the immobilisation of a cobalt porphyrin (CoTPP). The amount of electroactive species present on the TNT is almost double that present in a carbon cloth drop-cast with CoTPP with the same initial amount. For the material with the Ti foil support, the CoTPP peak was not seen. Thus, the high specific surface area of the titania nanotubes proved to have good properties for hosting the molecular complex. Furthermore, the catalytic properties were also studied: CoTPP@TNT produced a high amount of CO with around 40 % FE for CO at 1.10 V vs. SHE, corresponding to a relatively low overpotential. Moreover, the TNTs improve the cost and mechanical properties of the electrode, when compared to carbon nanotubes, by virtue of being a simple solid metal sheet. Within this context, already in 2016, Rosser et al.[55] immobilised a Mn-based molecular complex on a mesoporous titania support by drop-casting. The system was tested for electrocatalytic solar-driven CO2 reduction and showed an increased current density in CO2-saturated media. This represented a FE of around 70 % for CO at 1.7 V vs. Fc/Fc+ with the lowest overpotential for a molecular complex in non-aqueous solvent reported at that time. Interestingly, the HER was suppressed by loading more Mn complex, suggesting that the HER results from TiO2 itself. It has been shown that molecular Mn complex dimers are likely to enhance the activity for CO2RR. UV/ Vis and ATR-FTIR show the presence of catalytically active Mn Mn dimers, which react with the CO2. The immobilisation of the Mn complex on the mesoporous TiO2 leads to a high local concentration of Mn on the surface under cathodic potential. The mesoporous titania thus gives a suitable environment for the complex to dimerise when a reductive potential is applied. The same group recently followed up on this research topic by immobilising a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), again on mesoporous metal oxide electrodes.[99] The same phosphonic functionalisation strategy was used to anchor the functionalised molecular complex (CoPcP) on the metal oxide. More specifically, mesoporous indium tin oxide (meso-ITO) and mesoporous titanium oxide (meso-TiO2) were used to heterogenise the CoPcP by soaking the electrode in a solution of the complex. CPE was carried out using mesoTiO2/CoPcP, yielding a\nmaximum FE for CO of 85% with 1.3 mAcm 2 at 1.08 V vs. SHE in 0.5 M KHCO3. These studies highlight the feasibility of cost-effective TiO2 as a possible support to immobilise active sites and achieve efficient CO2 electroreduction in aqueous solutions."

            "text": "Polymer-based supports have been recently employed for the CO2RR to enhance the electrodes\u2019 scalability, processability, and mechanical properties. In addition to this, the possibility of incorporating functional groups onto the polymeric chain paves the way for multiple novel studies. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been described as promising materials for the adsorption of CO2. In these media, the solubility of CO2 is markedly increased. Moreover, ILs have been highlighted for their ability to activate CO2. [17,100] In 2016, McNicholas et al.[59] developed a cross-linked polymer network able to capture and reduce CO2. The ion-gel was made out of a PS-PEO-PS triblock brush polymer where 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and [Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl] (bpy=2,2\u2019-bipyridine) were encapsulated. A catalytic wave reveals the presence of CO2 in the cyclic voltammetry analysis with a 450 mV shift towards more positive potential. Although the current density in the ion-gel is shown to be lower than that in ILs due to the slower diffusion, the material shows a lower overpotential requirement for the CO2RR. This is probably due to the enhancement of the solubility of CO2 in IIs. A few years later the same research group[43] prepared a polymer ion-gel from acrylamide using a radical polymerisation method alongside silicone rubber. Imidazolium moieties were added here, too, to improve CO2 solubility and activation. The same catalyst was used, but this time the system was cast on a carbon cloth substrate to enhance the current density and so that the reaction could be carried out in aqueous media (Figure 6). The FE reached up to 90% for CO in a 0.1 KOH+0.1 K2CO3 electrolyte, at the same potential as in organic solvent (i.e. 0.68 V vs. RHE), with a current density between 1 and 2 mAcm 2.

            "heading": "4. Summary and Outlook",
            "text": "To summarise, we have described five different types of supports as the major ones widely used for the heterogenisation of molecular catalysts through immobilisation strategies present in the literature. Among these, the carbon-based supports (in their multiple forms), the titania supports, and the MOF/COF supports are the predominant systems in the literature, representing 90 % of the described supports for the immobilisation of molecular complexes. Therefore, we shall focus the discussion about those supports which are likely to be the most promising. Figure 7 shows an overview of the selectivity efficiency for the main product versus the current density obtained and the potential applied. Analysing the graphs carefully, we can identify the following trends:\n1) The systems reaching the highest FE are located in the range of potential applied between 0.5 and 1.4 V vs. RHE, which is relatively less negative compared to all the ranges investigated. For the titania systems, a higher applied potential is needed for the CO2RR, namely one more negative than 1.1 V vs. RHE due to the conductive band potential. However, even with higher potential, only one case reaches FE comparable to that of the best carbon-based electrodes. This result highlights the superiority at present of carbon-based materials over titania-based ones. The MOF/COF-based electrodes show FE higher than 90 % at relatively low potentials between 0.6 and 0.8 V vs. RHE in most of the cases analysed. This outcome therefore also highlights the advantage of such systems in having high dispersion of the active sites throughout the support framework. 2) In terms of current density in all the systems considered where an H-cell setup is employed, current densities between 2 and 30 mAcm 2 are achieved for most carbon-based materials, reaching FEs higher than 65 %. Titania-based materials have a current density limited to a maximum value of 1.3 mAcm 2, likely due to the lower electrical conductivity. Concerning MOFs/COFs, two out of three samples analysed reach current densities of above 7 mAcm 2, with FE approaching unity. 3) Regarding the carbon materials-based supports, the most promising material in terms of a minimised overpotential requirement and a maximised FE is a system where a Co-based molecular complex is immobilised on\nFigure 7.

In terms of current density in the H-shaped cell, there is also an excellent material that reaches 30 mAcm 2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE in which a Co phthalocyanine is immobilised on defect-rich graphene oxide.[75]\nConcerning the stability of these heterogenized molecular catalysts, it is reported that these support materials are very stable under reducing potentials.[101,102] Considering the amount of these materials normally employed for electrochemical studies, the prolonged activity studies would reveal a decrease in the detected products or a slight reduction of the catalytic performances as the catalyst would leach out of the electrode material.\nThe points listed above and the performances of all the systems lead us to feature and commend the carbon-based materials for employment as efficient materials and supports for the immobilisation of active catalytic sites to perform the CO2RR. Reaching high selectivity at low overpotentials and relatively high current density when a scalable electrochemical device is employed are the chief advantages. Further implementation of these systems in flow cells and more advanced systems will undoubtedly lead to improvements in the current densities. In addition, the novelty of using molecular complexes within the framework structures of MOFs and COFs is a promising direction for future studies. In all the examples listed above we highlight the support\u2019s influence on different key aspects for the CO2RR, such the ease of loading molecular catalysts and their optimum loadings, activities, and selectivities. More studies are needed to improve those systems, mainly focusing on their electrical conductivity and morphology, boosting overall efficiency. Thus, the choice of the support and the intelligent engineering thereof pose critical questions that have to be addressed carefully in order to develop impressive and scalable heterogeneous catalysts for the reduction of CO2. For this reason, additional revolutionary, in-depth experimental and computational studies to rationally design and understand the best supports for the heterogenisation of active sites are clearly called for, in order to develop new systems for CO2RR catalysis with augmented performances and thereby attain the higher efficiencies necessary for industrial and ecological relevancy."
