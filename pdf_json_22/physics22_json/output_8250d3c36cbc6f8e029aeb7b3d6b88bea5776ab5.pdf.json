    "abstractText": "We report the fabrication and optoelectronic characterization of field-effect transistors (FETs) based on few-layer ReSe2. The devices show n-type conduction due to the Cr contacts that form low Schottky barriers with the ReSe2 nanosheet. We show that the optoelectronic performance of these FETs is strongly affected by air pressure, and it undergoes a dramatic increase in conductivity when the pressure is lowered below the atmospheric one. Surface-adsorbed oxygen and water molecules are very effective in doping ReSe2; hence, FETs based on this two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor can be used as an effective air pressure gauge. Finally, we report negative photoconductivity in the ReSe2 channel that we attribute to a back-gate-dependent trapping of the photo-excited charges.",

            "text": "Rhenium diselenide (ReSe2) is a member of the layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which has attracted a lot of attention due to the extremely anisotropic electrical, optical and mechanical properties stemming from the strong in-plane anisotropy consequence of its reduced crystal symmetry [1\u20134]. Contrary to other hexagonal TMDs, the room temperature thermodynamically stable 1T phase for ReSe2 has a distorted triclinic symmetry, which endows the material with anisotropic responses in many properties [5\u20137]. Monolayer ReSe2 has an indirect bandgap of 1.34 eV [8\u201310], reducing to 0.98 eV [6] for bulk ReSe2, with a weak layer dependency. In general, an increase in the layer thickness causes a reduction in band-gap energy and the loss of electric properties of thick ReSe2 [11]. ReSe2 has been employed in various electronic and optoelectronic functional devices in order to study its electrical and optical properties. Yang et al. reported that the mobility of ReSe2 nanosheets increases when the number of layers decreases and highlighted that the properties of ReSe2 can be tuned by the number of layers and gas molecule gating, making ReSe2 a promising material for future functional device applications [11]. Optically biaxial and highly anisotropic Mo-doped ReSe2 (Mo:ReSe2) was used to investigate the effects of physisorption of gas molecules on few-layer nanosheet-based photodetectors, reporting different sensitivity to the surrounding environment, prompt photoswitching, and high photoresponsivity [12]. The anisotropic nature of ReSe2 was revealed by Raman spectroscopy under linearly polarized excitations in a study by Zhang et al., who fabricated top-gate ReSe2 fieldeffect transistors (FETs), with a high on/off current ratio and a well-developed current saturation in the current\u2013voltage characteristics at room temperature [7]. They synthesized\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1886. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12111886 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1886 2 of 11\nReSe2 directly onto hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates to improve the electron and hole mobility and demonstrated that the ReSe2-based photodetectors exhibit polarizationsensitive photoresponsivity due to the intrinsic linear dichroism, originating from high in-plane optical anisotropy, thus, identifying ReSe2 as a highly anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) material for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. Similarly, a near-infrared ReSe2 photodetector featuring high photoresponsivity and a short photoresponse time, in the order of 10 ms, was demonstrated by Kim and coworkers, achieving high photo and temporal responses simultaneously by applying a p-doping technique based on hydrochloric acid to a selected ReSe2 region [13]. Ambipolar FETs were obtained from multi-layer ReSe2, mechanically exfoliated onto a SiO2 layer by Pradhan et al., who demonstrated that it is possible to utilize the ambipolarity to fabricate logical elements or digital synthesizers [10]. Similarly, ambipolar all-2D ReSe2 FET with a h-BN gate dielectric and graphene contacts were investigated by Lee and coworkers, who used the ambipolar transfer characteristics, attributed to the tunable Fermi level of the graphene contact, to demonstrate an inverter in a logic circuit [14]. Corbet et al. proposed a method to improve the contact resistance in few-layer ReSe2 FETs, by up to three orders of magnitude, using ultra-high-vacuum annealing [15]. A low contact resistance was also obtained in single-layer ReSe2, encapsulated in h-BN using scandium/gold contacts, and this enabled Khan and coworkers [16] to measure a large field-effect charge carrier mobility and responsivity. Xing et al. addressed the challenge of the controlled synthesis of high-quality ultrathin ReSe2, developing an approach for synthesizing 2D ReSe2 flakes with a thickness down to monolayer by chemical vapor transport, through carefully tuning the growth kinetics [17]. The FETs fabricated with such flakes showed n-type semiconducting behavior with mobility of a few cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, comparable to the values measured using mechanically exfoliated flakes. Polarization-resolved ReSe2 photodetectors were recently studied by Tian and Liu, who reported a van der Waals heterojunction ReSe2/WSe2-based photodetector, with high responsivity and detectivity at room temperature. Remarkably, they demonstrated that the photoresponse of their devices is a function of the polarized angle of the incident light, indicating the effective polarized light detection [18]. Pressure is commonly used to understand the interlayer interaction in layered materials. High-hydrostatic pressures of several kbar were applied to ReSe2 (and ReS2) exfoliated flakes and the effect on their optical properties was investigated, finding that the energies of the two main excitonic transitions decrease in energy with increasing pressure [19]. The negative pressure coefficients were attributed to the destabilization of the pz orbital with increasing pressure, demonstrating that ReSe2 does not exhibit a strong electronic decoupling and, hence, the optoelectronic properties of few-layered ReSe2 could be drastically different from the bulk form. Conversely, the effect of low pressure on ReSe2 has been rarely investigated in the literature. In the present study, we fabricate back-gate FETs with a few-layer ReSe2 channel and study the electric transport from room pressure down to 10\u22125 mbar. We find that air pressure has a dramatic effect on the channel conductivity, which increases by more than two orders of magnitude when the pressure decreases. We explain such behavior in terms of the desorption of oxygen and water molecules from the ReSe2 surface in high vacuum. Importantly, we observe that the effect of air pressure is reversible, highlighting that back-gate ReSe2 FETs can be exploited as effective pressure gauges. Moreover, we report a reduction of the channel conductivity when the device is illuminated, i.e., a negative photoconducticity, that has not been reported before for ReSe2. The dependence of the negative photoconductivity on the gate voltage suggests that photo-excited free charge carriers are attracted towards the gate and captured at the interface, with the dielectric layer contributing to the observed loss of conductivity.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1886 3 of 11"

The back-gate voltage was applied through the sample holder of the probe station which was in direct electrical contact to the Ag-pasted n-Si substrate. The measurements were performed by the sourcemeasurement units of a semiconductor characterization system Keithley 4200 SCS (Tek-\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1886 4 of 11\ntronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), with current and voltage sensitivity better than 1 pA and 2 \u00b5V, respectively. For the transistor characterization, the source was grounded while the drain (Vds) and gate (Vgs) voltages were either swept or stepped while the drain (Id) and gate (Ig) currents were monitored. The measured gate leakage current was always < 10 pA, confirming the integrity of the SiO2 gate dielectric. The electric measurements were performed at controlled air pressure, from room pressure to 10\u22125 mbar. Under the combined action of a rotatory and a turbomolecular pump connected in series to a probe station and a valve system, it was possible to control the pressure stepwise. The pressure was monitored through the pressure gauge TPG261 (Pfeiffer, Asslar, Deutschland). The photoresponse of the device was investigated using an array of 144 white LEDs with a spectrum ranging from 400 to 750 nm and peaks at 450 nm and 540 nm, a color temperature of 6000 K, and with 1 mW/cm2 intensity."

We limited the drain bias to 3 V and gate voltage range to \u00b1 30 V to prevent damage to the device and, in particular, to the SiO2 gate dielectric. The Id \u2212Vds curves (Figure 2a) show that the drain current is modulated by the gate voltage Vgs and stays below 10 pA for negative Vgs but increases abruptly for positive Vgs. This behavior is typical of a n-type transistor [21,22]. Furthermore, for all gate voltages, the Id \u2212Vds curves are asymmetric, with slightly higher current at positive Vds, pointing to the formation of low Schottky barriers at the ReSe2/Cr/Au contacts [23\u201326]. The presence of a Schottky barrier is confirmed also by the limited current that reaches the maximum of 20 nA at Vds = 3 V. The Id \u2212Vgs transfer curves of Figure 2b, shown on both the linear and logarithmic scale, confirm the n-type behavior of the transistor, with off-state at Vgs < 20 V and on-state for Vgs > 20 V. The curve on the logarithmic scale shows an on/off current ratio higher than two orders of magnitude and a modest subthreshold swing SS ' 2.8 V/decade, typical of back-gate 2D transistors with limited gate efficiency and high interface defect density [27\u201330]. The smooth rise of Id at negative Vgs indicates the appearance of a holetype conduction. The carrier type can be controlled via the metal contacts. Dominant n-type behavior is obtained in ReSe2 transistors with low-work-function metal contacts, such as Al or Ti, whose Fermi level aligns above the conduction band minimum of ReSe2 [7,14,31]. As the conduction band minimum of ReSe2 is around of 4.5 eV and the valence band maximum is around 5.6 eV [31], the Fermi levels of Cr and Au that have work functions of 4.5 and 5.1 eV, respectively, align within the ReSe2 bandgap and can favor ambipolar conduction. The transfer curve on the linear scale is used to estimate the field-effect mobility, \u00b5FE, in the on-state of the transistor for Vgs > 20 V. The mobility, evaluated as \u00b5FE = L W 1 CoxVds dIds dVgs (here Cox = 1.15\u00d7 10\u22128 F cm\u22122 is the gate dielectric capacitance per unit area), results \u00b5FE ' 0.03 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 slightly lower than the \u00b5FE \u223c 0.1\u2212 10 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, typically measured in few-layer ReSe2 FETs [5,7,10,11]. We also note that an increase in layer thickness causes a loss of electric properties in ReSe2 and, in particular, that few-layer ReSe2 exhibits lower mobility of two orders of magnitude or more than single-layer ReSe2 [11]. Furthermore, the presence of a Schottky barrier at the contacts [32,33], as well as intrinsic defects in the material and impurities located at the interface with the SiO2 layer or adsorbates on top of the channel from air exposure during the fabrication and the measurement process [10,34,35], acting as scattering or trapping centers, can contribute to decrease the mobility.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1886 5 of 11\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 11 typically measured in few-layer ReSe2 FETs [5,7,10,11].

Pressure Behavior To investigate the effect of air pressure on the ReSe2 channel conductivity, we performed an electric transport measurement, lowering the atmospheric pressure down to 10\u22125 mbar. The measurements were performed after keeping the device at the given pressure for several hours to achieve a steady state. Figure 3a shows the output characteristics at three different pressures (room pressure, 3 mbar and 8 \u00d7 10 mbar) for increasing gate voltages, ranging from 0 V to 30 V, with steps of 10 V. It can be observed that the channel current increases at lower pressure while the hysteresis decreases, and the asymmetric behavior is unchanged. The reduced hysteresis indicates that surface adsorbates play an important role.\nThe same trend with increased current and reduced hysteresis at low pressure is displayed also by the transfer characteristics in Figure 3b. The low pressure, in particular, causes a dramatic change in the transfer characteristics with the transistor that does not turn off over the applied Vgs range. The lowering pressure causes a left shift in the transfer\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1886 7 of 11\ncharacteristics, corresponding to a reduction in the threshold voltage Vth, pointing to an increased n-type doping density. Such behavior can be explained as desorption of adsorbates from the ReSe2 surface. Adsorbed oxygen and water molecules, being electronegative, subtract electrons to the channel, thus, decreasing the conductivity (otherwise stated, oxygen and water counter-dope the n-type channel with holes). Their desorption has the two-fold beneficial effect of increasing the n-type doping and the mobility (see following), resulting in increased conductivity. Figure 3c,d, which display the transfer characteristics for lowering and raising pressures, respectively, demonstrate that the transformation of the transfer curves is gradual and reversible. While the plot in Figure 3c shows the dynamic evolution of the transfer curves during the pressure change, the plot in Figure 3d monitors the time evolution of the transfer curves after a sudden change from 8\u00d7 10\u22125 mbar to room pressure, showing that the recovery of the pristine state is a slow process, requiring a few hours. The reversible change of current with pressure demonstrates that the device can be used as an air pressure gauge. Figure 4a,b detail the behavior of the mobility \u00b5FE and of the current in the on state (Ion) as a function of pressure. The mobility was evaluated using both the forward (Vgs sweep from \u221230 V to 30 V) and reverse (Vgs sweep from 30 V to \u221230 V) branches of transfer characteristics. Both forward \u00b5FE and Ion decrease for increasing pressure, following a power law, as demonstrated by the linear log\u2013log plots in the respective insets. Conversely, the threshold voltage Vth increases up to 10\u22121 mbar, above which it reaches a plateau (Figure 4c), demonstrating that the desorption of the adsorbates becomes effective at a pressure below 10\u22121 mbar. Finally, Figure 4d shows that the hysteresis width (here defined as the difference between the Vgs corresponding to the current Id = 1 nA in the reverse and forward sweep) is also increased by the rising pressure. The contribution of adsorbates to hysteresis in 2D-material-based transistors has been widely studied and demonstrated [34,40,41]. The easier the charge transfer between the channel and the adsorbates, the wider the hysteresis [38]."
