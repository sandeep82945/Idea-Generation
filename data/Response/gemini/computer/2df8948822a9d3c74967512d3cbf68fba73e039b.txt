1. **Investigate the use of different distance metrics:** The paper focuses on the shortest-path distance metric, but other distance metrics, such as the average distance or the harmonic mean distance, could also be explored. Different distance metrics may be more appropriate for different applications.


2. **Extend the method to handle more complex graph updates:** The paper considers edge insertions and deletions, but other types of updates, such as vertex insertions and deletions, or changes to edge weights, could also be considered. Extending the method to handle these more complex updates would make it more versatile and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.


3. **Explore the use of different pruning strategies:** The paper uses a simple pruning strategy based on the distance bound of boundary vertices. More sophisticated pruning strategies could be developed to further reduce the number of vertices that need to be repaired, potentially improving the efficiency of the method.


4. **Investigate the use of different parallelization techniques:** The paper uses a simple parallelization strategy based on anchor parallelism. Other parallelization techniques, such as task parallelism or data parallelism, could also be explored to further improve the scalability of the method.


5. **Apply the method to other applications:** The paper focuses on the application of the method to distance queries, but it could also be applied to other applications, such as routing or network optimization. Exploring the use of the method in these other applications could lead to new insights and improvements.
