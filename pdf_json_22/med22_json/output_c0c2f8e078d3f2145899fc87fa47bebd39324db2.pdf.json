Gray literature was collected through Google Scholar.\nAdditional studies were obtained by contacting authors and searching reference lists\nof candidate papers. The patient population included individuals with CF. Studies\ninvolving patients who underwent lung transplantation were excluded. The outcome\nwas the prediction or diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbations from metabolites directly\nmeasured from biological samples. Search results were downloaded and imported\ninto Covidence and duplicates were removed automatically. Any remaining duplicates\nwere manually tagged and excluded. Two independent reviewers screened each\nabstract for eligibility and repeated this process for full texts. Risk of bias was\nconducted using QUADAS-2 by two independent reviewers. A third author resolved any\nremaining conflicts.\nResults: A combined 3974 relevant abstracts were identified and 115 full texts\nwere assessed for eligibility. The final 25 studies underwent data extraction for study\ndesign, patient demographics, studiedmetabolites, concentration values, and diagnostic\naccuracy values. Included studies differed considerably in methodologies, sample\nspecimen types (exhaled breath condensate [EBC], sputum, saliva, plasma, urine), and\ndisease states. We identified 19 unique metabolites that were measured by two or more\nstudies of which 2 have the potential to predict PEx (EBC 4-hydroxycyclohexylcarboxylic\nacid [4-HCHC] and lactic acid) and 6 to diagnose PEx (EBC 4-HCHC and lactic acid,\nsputum lactic acid and nitrate, and plasma arginine and methionine).\nConclusion and Relevance: This systematic review has identified promising\nmetabolites for further study in CF. Certain metabolites may provide clinical potential\nin predicting or diagnosing PEx, but further validation studies are required. With better\ntools to aid in the earlier identification of PEx, clinicians can implement preventative\nmeasures to mitigate airway damage.\nSystematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/\nKeywords: metabolomics, biomarkers, systematic review, respirology, cystic fibrosis"

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common inherited life-shortening conditions that causes chronic progressive lung disease. The disease course is characterized by episodes of acute or subacute clinical worsening referred to as pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) due to increased airway infection and inflammation. PEx symptoms typically include increased productive cough and systemic symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss (1). The clinical presentation with PEx can be subtle, especially early in its course, resulting in missed opportunities to intervene with antibiotics to preserve lung function. By using biomarkers to predict imminent exacerbation risk or facilitate earlier diagnosis, patient outcomes can be improved.\nWithin the \u201c-omics\u201d field, most of the focus has been on examining sputum and blood proteomic and transcriptomic inflammatory markers in CF patients to diagnose PEx (2, 3). However, metabolomic studies are also emerging and involve a range of biospecimens. While most studies have focused on differences in metabolites between CF and nonCF subjects, several studies have also focused on PEx. The present systematic review has synthesized data from the available literature to determine if there are promising metabolites across the various biospecimens to be evaluated further as clinical biomarkers in the prediction and diagnosis of PEx."

The investigated test of interest was the analysis of metabolites as a predictive or diagnostic biomarker. A comparator test was not applicable for this review. The outcome was the prediction or diagnosis of a PEx based on various research criteria, such as Fuchs, Rosenfeld, or physician decision to begin antibiotic treatment (5, 6).\nStudies that collected biospecimens for the purpose of analyzing metabolites were included in this review. We broadly included studies that used metabolites to predict or diagnose PEx in CF patients. Studies that only examined metabolite changes throughout PEx treatment were excluded. Furthermore, studies were excluded if they solely focused on laboratory samples (e.g., in vitro studies). Studies were also excluded if they used genomic, proteomic, or microbiome approaches without addressing metabolites. A detailed summary of study characteristics is presented in Table 1."

            "heading": "Heterogeneity and Bias in Study Designs",
            "text": "Despite some metabolites being evaluated in two or more studies, heterogeneity in study designs posed a challenge in synthesizing the results. While some studies used paired samples from individual patients during different disease states (i.e., stable vs. PEx), other studies used independent groups of healthy or CF patients to serve as stable controls. Use of independent groups is more vulnerable to confounding by factors other than disease state that might be driving the group differences in metabolite profiles.\nOther considerations must also be made when studying the volatile nature of metabolites. One concern is the lack of a fasting protocol in most studies. The associated vitamins, minerals and macronutrients contained in food can impact the accuracy of test samples, especially when these same metabolites were the primary analyte of interest (36). The inconsistency across studies may impact the concentration of metabolites. Another consideration is the timeframe between sample collection and treatment. Antibiotics are routinely used for PEx treatment and may impact the metabolome during the initial treatment period. Thus, studies should ensure that samples are taken prior to any intervention and with uniform fasting protocols.\nAnother aspect to be considered is the reporting of blinding during index and reference testing. While it may be difficult to\nblind research coordinators collecting samples from CF or nonCF patients, those who process and analyze the samples should be blinded to the patient\u2019s disease state. One randomized pilot study did blind researchers during sample anaylsis (7).\nFurthermore, existing studies have been conducted using a wide variety of sample sources and analytical methods to identify and quantify the metabolites. While there are advantages in collecting samples such as urine and blood due to ease of collection across most age groups and translation into clinical practice (37), sensitivity and specificity are potential concerns when monitoring lung disease status as detected metabolites could arise from other organs. Due to the wide array of metabolites and dynamic range of concentrations, no single analytical tool is capable of measuring all metabolites which is reflected in the diversity of platforms examined. As such, several of the included studies used two or more complementary analytical platforms. The most widely used analytical approaches were LC- and GC-MS, as well as ultra-performance LC (UPLC) and high-performance LC (HPLC), the latter separation techniques sometimes used in combination with MS to improve sensitivity and analyte resolution (38, 39). An advantage of LC-MS is that it does not require chemical pre-processing and can detect a broad range of metabolites which makes it ideal for untargeted discovery analysis.While GC-MS ismore quantitative with excellent separation reproducibility and lower running costs than LC-MS, it is limited to the measurement of thermally stable and volatile compounds (40). Sample preparation and metabolite extraction differences across these platforms can pose a challenge in making comparisons across studies (41). As such, future studies must continue to explore the differences and similarities in metabolites across the various biological compartments and factor in the analytical platform used."

            "heading": "Synthesis of Metabolite Results",
            "text": "Metabolites from the nitric oxide pathway have been the most extensively studied to date. Based on available data, it remains unclear if exhaled NO is lower during PEx compared to stable state as the studies performed to date have been relatively small and the findings have been inconsistent (17, 19). Metabolites of NO, including nitrate and nitrite, do not appear to be consistently higher or lower during PEx when sampled from saliva, plasma or urine but nitrates were lower in sputum in two studies but the differences were not statistically significant when compared to stable CF subjects (12, 16). Arginine, an amino acid that acts as a substrate to form NO, was not significantly higher in sputum during PEx (16) but another study demonstrated its potential to predict PEx when elevated in EBC (31). Contrary to the increase in airway sampling, plasma arginine was lower in CF PEx compared to healthy controls (13) but was not significantly lower than stable CF samples (16).\nCarboxylic acids and derivatives have also been investigated in the context of PEx. EBC pyroglutamic acid levels were higher in pre-PEx compared to stable CF samples demonstrating the potential to predict PEx (30, 31). Plasma methionine levels were lower in PEx compared to stable CF samples and has the potential to diagnose PEx (7, 13). Plasma histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, pyroglutamic acid, and tryptophan levels were found to be lower\nFrontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 896439\nand glutamic acid levels higher in CF PEx compared to healthy control samples but levels were not compared to stable CF (7, 13). This may reflect intrinsic differences between CF and healthy controls as opposed to differences related to PEx specifically as malnutrition in CF can lead to changes in the plasma amino acid profile compared to healthy subjects (42).\nWithin the organonitrogen compound class, sputum putrescine shows promise as being a diagnostic biomarker of PEx as levels were found to be higher in PEx compared to both healthy control and stable CF samples in two separate studies although the comparisons were not statistically significant due to the small sample sizes of the studies (15, 26). The potential role of ornithine-derived putrescine in PEx is unclear but it may play a role in smooth muscle regulation and antiinflammatory processes (43). Within the organooxygen class, 4-hydroxycyclohexylcarboxylic acid (4-HCHC) from EBC was higher in PEx compared to stable CF samples. In terms of its potential role in CF pathophysiology, 4-HCHC is a rare organic acid involved in gut microbial and mammalian metabolism and its appearance in EBC is suggestive of gut-lung crosstalk with increased inflammation in both compartments (44).\nLactic acid, or lactate, has demonstrated both predictive and diagnostic potential in our review. When analyzed predictively, two studies from the same research group have found EBC lactic acid to be higher during pre-PEx compared to stable CF samples. Diagnostically, EBC and sputum lactic acid levels were higher in PEx compared to stable CF samples (26, 31). Lactic acid is a fermentation metabolite that might originate from anaerobic bacteria within the hypoxic airway environment. Anaerobic bacteria have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PEx (45)."

Firstly, studies with statistically significant findings are more likely to be published which poses concern for publication bias similar to most systematic reviews. Furthermore, most conference abstracts were excluded during full-text review due to a lack of patient details, data presentation, and inability to assess risk of bias. Secondly, due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and objectives, we were unable to synthesize the results in a formal meta-analysis. Thus, we were limited to providing a tabulated summary of the studied metabolites and their respective directionality of change and the statistical significance of the change."

            "text": "With the evolving landscape of metabolomic research in CF, future studies must consider better standardization in study design, timing and method of metabolite collection and analysis, and reporting. Future studies that aim to test the diagnostic or predictive value of metabolite biomarkers in PEx should also ensure that data is collected during clearly defined disease states. The distinction between stable CF, pre-PEx, PEx, and pre-treatment and post-treatment states can be challenging but should be clearly outlined in future study designs. As well, consistency in fasting protocols across all sample types may be warranted.\nMoreover, based on this review\u2019s search results, there were only two studies from the same research group that examined metabolites to help predict PEx (30, 31). This result highlights the need for more studies to consider prediction alongside diagnosis when characterizing biomarkers. While predicting PEx is understandably a more challenging clinical setting to apply biomarkers, this is the setting that will provide the most clinical utility as demonstrating differences in metabolites in settings in which there is a clear difference in clinical presentation (stable vs. PEx) is less useful but a reasonable starting point. Furthermore, comparison of metabolite levels to healthy control samples is less useful as differences may reflect differences between CF disease vs. healthy as opposed to disease activity related to PEx whereby a comparison to stable CF samples is much more relevant. Furthermore, metabolomic biomarkers for disease monitoring must also be re-evaluated in the context of CFTR modulator use as promising biomarkers, such as FeNO, can be influenced by CFTR modulators (46).\nLastly, it is important to consider how these studies can be translated into clinical practice in the long-term. For any promising metabolites to be used, they must undergo rigorous testing and validation as mandated by the Institute of Medicine to determine its appropriateness in clinical practice (47). Within this systematic review, we were unable to identify any metabolomic biomarkers that have undergone this process."
