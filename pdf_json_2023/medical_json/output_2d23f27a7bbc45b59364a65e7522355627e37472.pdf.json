VHA has been implementing its Whole Health (WH) initiative since 2018, a proactive practice empowering patients to take charge of their health and well-being. A key facilitator of the WH initiative is the WH coach who partners with Veterans to achieve their health-related goals. A gap exists in the literature regarding the understanding of WH coaches\u2019 use of telehealth to engage rural-residing Veterans. COVID-19 unexpectedly interrupted in-person VHA delivery of care, including WH coaching which primarily relied on in-person delivery and focused less on telehealth. During the pandemic, WH coaches had to adapt and integrate different modalities to engage their Veteran patients. We\u00a0examined WH coaches\u2019 approaches to extending coaching to rural Veterans via technology, emphasizing the advantages of telehealth, existing gaps in telehealth delivery, and opportunities for telehealth as a coaching modality.\nMethods: This project was implemented as part of a larger mixed methods evaluation regarding WH coaching for rural Veterans; this manuscript presents the findings from the qualitative data from the larger study. The qualitative dataset is comprised of data collected using three different qualitative methods: four focus groups (n = 11; 3\u20134 participants per group), in-depth individual interviews (n = 9), and open-ended responses from a national web-based survey (n = 140). Focus group, in-depth interview, and open-ended survey data were collected sequentially and separately analyzed following each wave of data collection. Findings from the three analyses were then collaboratively merged, compared, reorganized, and refined by the evaluation team to create final themes.\nResults: Three final themes that emerged from the merged data were: (1) Advantages of Telehealth; (2) Telehealth Gaps for Rural Veterans, and (3) Strategies for Bridging Telehealth Gaps. Themes explicate telehealth advantages, gaps, and opportunities for rural Veteran WH coaching.\nConclusion: Findings highlight that video telehealth alone is not sufficient for meeting the needs of rural Veterans. Digital technologies hold promise for equalizing health access gaps; however, both human factors and broadband infrastructure constraints continue to require WH coaches to use a mix of"

            "text": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is one of the largest providers of telehealth in the United\u00a0 States (1). Their practices, initiatives, and health care innovations cut across other healthcare systems (2) and impact more than nine million enrolled Veterans (3). The VHA has increased equitable access to care for Veterans using telehealth, supplementing many face-to-face visits (4, 5). During COVID-19, VHA\u2019s virtual delivery of healthcare grew exponentially, with some providers and patients having limited telehealth experience now participating in it. We\u00a0are now witnessing the result of this expansion: a \u201cnew normal\u201d wherein telehealth and remote modalities are being utilized to ensure continuous and accessible care for VHA enrolled Veterans (6, 7).\nThis virtual shift is especially important for rural Veterans as this population does not always have the same access to health care as their urban counterparts, despite more rural Veterans being enrolled in VHA healthcare (8, 9). Use of technology (e.g., web-based programs and video-delivered therapies) can help rural Veterans overcome barriers to accessing in-person care, such as long travel distances, closures of rural clinics, provider shortages, and long wait times (5, 10\u201313). However, virtual care delivery also comes with its own challenges, especially given the lack of access to broadband internet in rural communities (1, 12, 14, 15).\nSince 2018, the VHA has been transforming its approach to care through the Whole Health (WH) initiative (16); a system-wide initiative that is being shepherded by the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT). WH is a proactive, integrative health approach empowering patients to take charge of their health through patient-centric decision-making rather than focusing primarily on treating disease (16\u201318). A key component of the WH initiative is the WH coach who assists Veterans in realizing their personalized health and wellbeing goals based on the Veteran\u2019s desires, aspirations, and purpose (16, 19). In doing so, they bridge the gap between medical recommendations and Veterans\u2019 abilities and inclinations to implement these recommendations. WH coaches collaborate closely with clinical teams, help Veterans with desired behavior changes, and facilitate engagement in relevant WH courses (e.g., \u201cIntro to Whole Health\u201d and \u201cTaking Charge of My Life and Health\u201d) (20). Many WH coaches work with rural Veterans, a hardto-reach population facing unique barriers and constraints regarding healthcare access (8, 21\u201323).\nStudies have demonstrated the integral role health coaching plays in patients achieving behavioral changes (24\u201327), and data show promising results for mental health, diabetes, heart disease, and general improvement of health and health-related quality of life (16,\n20, 28\u201330). Prior to COVID-19, most WH coaching was conducted face-to-face with little integration of video telehealth coaching. However, virtual delivery of health coaching programs has been shown to be\u00a0an effective approach and widespread supplement to in-person coaching, especially to increase access to care and resolve access barriers for people in rural areas (31).\nWhile there is a growing body of literature focusing on health coaching and its virtual delivery (31, 32), a gap exists regarding our understanding of WH coaches\u2019 use of telehealth to engage rural Veterans, and how different modalities are being used by WH coaches to meet the needs of these Veterans. The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly interrupted in-person delivery of care across VHA, including WH coaching which primarily relied on in-person delivery and focused much less on telehealth. During this transition, WH coaches had to adapt and integrate different modalities to engage with their Veteran patients. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to examine WH coaches\u2019 experiences with extending coaching to rural Veterans via technology, with an emphasis on explicating advantages of telehealth, existing gaps in telehealth delivery, and opportunities for telehealth as a coaching modality."

Each successive stage built on the previous, with the FGs providing a collective overview of how coaches perceived their ability to connect to rural Veterans at-a-distance, followed by in-depth interviews which permitted more in-depth exploration of how coaches were reaching rural Veterans, and finally the web-based survey, which allowed us to capture broader trends on barriers and facilitators to reaching rural Veterans with WH coaching.\nFrontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin.org"

The survey was used to explicate broader trends on barriers and facilitators to reaching rural Veterans with WH coaching, to check the breadth of our understanding of the topics generated from the FG discussions and interviews, and to understand the generalizability of these issues. Our survey was administered to a representative sample of VHA WH coaches nationwide via the WH coaching COP distribution list.\nWe obtained survey approval from VHA\u2019s Organizational Assessment Committee in December 2020. Approval for survey dissemination was obtained in January 2021 from the American Federation of Government Employees union. Once finalized, the survey was disseminated via the COP distribution list. The survey allowed for individuals that did not meet eligibility criteria to exit\nbefore completion. Survey data were securely housed in the VA REDCap system (33, 34). Participation was voluntary and expected completion time was 20\u201325 min.\nFor the analysis reported here, we\u00a0only included responses to the open-ended portion of the survey (comprising 13 open-ended questions from the larger 45-question survey). Open-ended survey data were initially analyzed using thematic analysis by three independent coders. Codes were developed both deductively from survey questions and inductively from survey data. The focus of this initial analysis included examination of differences in WH coaching between rural and urban Veterans, identification of specific strategies used to engage rural Veterans in WH, and preliminary conceptualization of alignment with our understandings from FGs and interviews."

            "text": "Lastly, participants reiterated that there is a need for both virtual and face-to-face programs at VHA going forward, with in-person persisting as a relevant coaching modality. Participants explained that\nin-person interactions with rural Veterans was an important aspect of the WH coaching process. It allowed them to provide information about what WH entails, have authentic conversations, and address Veterans\u2019 questions or concerns. While telehealth helped to extend coaching options, some participants reported that for some Veterans, the motivation for engaging in WH offerings was the direct interactions it provided:\nThere\u2019s a few [Veterans], there\u2019s people that need in person. They need to see you. They need that\u2026I can\u2019t wait to get back to in person [after COVID-19], and hearing the stories in person, like I\u00a0said, \u2018cause you\u00a0see the body language, you\u00a0see the facial expressions\u2026 when part of the story is hard for them. (Interview #8)\nSeveral participants also mentioned that engaging with rural Veterans in-person was a great way to initially reach them with WH coaching. It was also a strategy for facilitating familiarity, authenticity, and trust and opened the door to the possibility of future telehealth coaching sessions:\nIn-person meetings\u2014allows a human connection which paves the way for virtual meetings. (Survey ID #56)\nFurther, while video telehealth has been rewarding in permitting more rural Veterans to be\u00a0 seen, still some Veterans continued to prefer in-person visits. One participant expressed that coaching could take place across different modalities and had a place within the coaching repertoire, but in-person coaching was still preferred by some Veterans:\nI have to say the switch to video has been just as rewarding\u2026I feel that it\u2019s even more rewarding because I\u2019m seeing more patients from all over\u2026while still having the face-to-face feel [via video]\u2026/\u2026[but] as a health coach,\u2026you could definitely have in-clinic days, you\u00a0could have out-of-office days working remotely, and there are some [Veterans] that you\u00a0have to see face-to-face, that have pushed off coaching because they don\u2019t wanna live in a virtual world\u2026but there is a time and place for every modality in coaching.

            "text": "Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of WH coaching efforts via telehealth increased in an unprecedented way. Telehealth, in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, became a critical WH practice for engaging rural Veterans in WH care. Findings from this evaluation reveal that video-enabled telehealth became more mainstream in coaches\u2019 delivery of WH. Still, almost all coaches in this evaluation reported an array of challenges while utilizing telehealth to engage with rural Veterans. To overcome these challenges and bridge telehealth gaps, WH coaches have integrated multiple modalities into their coaching practice; for example, using in-person, video telehealth, and non-internet reliant options, such as telephone, DVDs, and mail outs. Moreover, rather than employing a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, our findings suggest that coaches should apply a pragmatic and blended approach of various modalities based on the Veterans\u2019\nFrontiers in Public Health 10 frontiersin.org\ncontexts, needs, and preferences, which exemplifies a patient-driven approach to care (16, 19, 37, 38).\nResearch has noted that using telehealth modalities to remotely deliver clinical and rehabilitation services to rural Veterans has many advantages over in-person delivery (11\u201313, 38, 39). We\u00a0confirm and expand upon these findings by demonstrating that virtual coaching with rural Veterans helped to overcome geographic and access barriers due to lack of travel and reduced distance to care, and provided flexibility to both coaches and patients (38, 40). Additionally, an increased online capacity made it easier, and more efficient, for coaches to deliver group sessions to more Veterans at one time and to provide opportunities to attend different types of integrative therapies from home (i.e., yoga, Tai Chi, other integrative therapies). These advantages align with the ethical principles of autonomy, distributive justice, and beneficence for the ethical practice of telehealth (38, 41).\nHowever, all coaches in this study reported several existing gaps within the telehealth infrastructure at VHA and in the rural community. For example, the lack of reliable internet access and broadband internet in rural areas has caused frustration among coaches and hesitancy to participate via telehealth among rural Veterans. Challenges among some Veterans, especially older Veterans (1, 9), to adeptly use telehealth technology and devices such as an iPad or a computer adds to the frustration of both parties. Participants reported that these frustrations have led to varying degrees of receptivity toward telehealth services by some of their rural Veterans. Several other studies on the rapid transition of healthcare delivery during the pandemic era also reported similar patient- and systemlevel challenges that have impacted the success of service delivery via telehealth (38, 42, 43).\nAs digital forms of telehealth continue to be\u00a0rolled out, ensuring equitable access to technology is not only a necessity but also ethically important. Establishing reliable broadband infrastructure for rural and other underserved populations must be\u00a0addressed so as to not exacerbate the already existing digital divide (44) and health disparities among rural vs. urban and older vs. younger Veterans (4, 37, 38, 45). There are many opportunities to bridge these gaps. For example, the VHA should continue to focus on ensuring that a variety of modalities for healthcare delivery are available to improve access to coaching. Additionally, the VHA should continue to expand and streamline efforts to equip eligible rural Veterans with VHA-issued devices that have Wi-Fi capabilities (4, 14, 46).\nAs supported by Keenan et\u00a0al., some of the experienced telehealth gaps were attributed to the rapidity of the transition to telehealth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (38). Continued implementation of designated telehealth teams with the purpose of providing training and support to both coaches and Veterans would improve the Veteran\u2019s access to, and satisfaction with, the remote care (38, 45). With strong infrastructural support within VHA for these recommended changes, WH coaching can continue to be\u00a0an initiative well suited for telehealth delivery. Future studies are warranted to examine the impact of increased telehealth delivery and how to approach equitable access to telehealth in a way that does not favor one group over another (38, 41, 45).\nAmid higher tech advancements and implementation, it is important to also acknowledge the advantages of lower tech modalities for WH coaching (37). Telephone health coaching was highlighted as a preferred approach for WH delivery by many participants due to its\nconvenience, suitability, and easy availability among rural Veterans. This aligns with health coaching research in other fields that has found telephone coaching is valued by patients and coaches and overcomes the need to travel for those residing in rural areas (39, 47, 48). Telephone coaching has also been shown to be\u00a0cost-effective due to low costs associated with its delivery (39, 47). However, phone appointments can sometimes receive less workload credit than video telehealth or in-person care. Therefore, it is critical to advocate that telephone coaching remains a billable form of contact so that more coaches are willing to utilize this option with those Veterans who prefer this modality over others (37) or who may have to rely on phone-based telehealth services due to undependable or inconsistent video connectivity.\nFurther, absence of optimal telehealth infrastructure as reported by many of our coaching participants makes it critical to preserve the value of in-person and telephone engagement (38). Findings from our study support a blended model of WH coaching where the initial contact and enrollment is done via face-to-face engagement followed by telephone or video telehealth coaching, working with the patient to develop the best blend of modalities to achieve their health goals. This is in line with other reports that have found health coaching to result in favorable outcomes when using a combination of modalities (37\u201339, 43).\nTo enhance WH use, there is a need for more infrastructural support for coaches to incorporate multiple approaches into their WH delivery. The VHA has pioneered initiatives to address the digital divide experienced in rural areas (44) and develop infrastructure for optimum delivery of health services among rural Veterans (14). As this continues, it will be\u00a0important for researchers to examine which initiatives are most successful and sustainable for meeting the needs of rural Veterans, considering the ethical implications of telehealth practice. Moreover, while telehealth continues to be\u00a0regarded as a key solution for meeting the needs of hard-to-reach, geographically dispersed areas, future studies are needed to critically assess the ethical and pragmatic implications telehealth delivery might have on the Veterans\u2019 experience of WH (49)."

To ensure continuity of care for telehealth, it is important to adopt feedback from other groups regarding quality of telehealth utilization so that we\u00a0can continue developing a strong telehealth infrastructure in VHA. Future studies could incorporate Veterans\u2019 perspectives and non-coaches, such as clinicians who are increasingly incorporating aspects of WH coaching into their work at the VHA. Given the complexity of the WH program and the variety of stakeholders that are involved, a broader examination of this topic with all stakeholders is required to get a complete picture of the challenges and barriers to virtual WH coaching."

However, we\u00a0emphasize the fact that despite current challenges, telehealth is indeed now a viable option to provide WH coaching and other health care services to rural Veteran population and shows promise for reducing rural Veterans\u2019 health access gaps and improving continuity of care. Of importance is engaging in shared decision-making about what type of modality fits each Veteran based on their living context and individual capabilities. We\u00a0would also emphasize the importance of adopting an approach that is ethical and aimed to reduce and not augment the existing digital divide and health disparity among Veterans."
