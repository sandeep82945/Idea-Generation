Overall, the experimental data reinforce the notion of a nontopological mechanism for extrusion of DNA.\nHigher order genome organization is largely dictated by structural maintenance of chromosome complexes (SMC) complexes1\u20133. SMC complexes including condensin, cohesin, and Smc5/6 in eukaryotes, share a ringlike architecture consisting of multiple subunits were two coiled-coil SMC arms and a intrinsically disordered kleisin constitute a large (~ 35\u00a0nm) ring. Additional subunits attach to the kleisin and ATPase heads of the SMC subunits, rendering different functions to the different SMC complexes. SMC proteins organize the chromosome by DNA loop extrusion, as demonstrated by single-molecule in\u00a0vitro experiments4\u20136. However, the mechanistic understanding of the coordinated movement of SMC subunits that underlie loop extrusion is still in its infancy.\nThe topology of DNA involved during loop extrusion has been a major point of discussion in recent years1,7\u20139. Three possibilities have been proposed: (i) topological binding, where the SMC ring opens to encircle the DNA, (ii) pseudotopological loading, where a small nascent loop enters the SMC ring without opening, and where loop extrusion continues pseudotopologically by further extruding this inserted loop through the ring, (iii) nontopological loading where the DNA does not enter the ring to extrude loop but instead binds at the outer interfaces of the SMC ring.\nRecently, we showed that condensin and cohesin can bypass very large (even 200\u00a0nm) DNA-bound proteins and particles while extruding DNA loops10. Upon encounter of such a DNA-bound particle by the loop-extruding SMC complex, the particle transfers into the extruded DNA loop in the majority of cases. We even observed such passage of large particles by single-chain cohesins where all interfaces of the SMC subunits and the kleisin were covalently linked5. The passage of roadblocks bigger than the ring size of cohesin, even when the ring cannot open, clearly indicated that the extruded DNA does not enter the ring topologically or pseudotopologically. Instead, these experiments pointed to a nontopological mechanism for loop extrusion.\nOPEN\n1Department of Bionanoscience, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. 2Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna Biocenter (VBC), Vienna, Austria. 3Present address: Max-Planck Institute of Biophysics, Frankfurt Am Main, Germany. 4These authors contributed equally: Roman Barth and Biswajit Pradhan. *email: c.dekker@tudelft.nl\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8100 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35359-2\nAfter these data appeared on bioRxiv in July 202110, two new pseudotopological models were proposed by Shaltiel et\u00a0al.

            "text": "Description of the pseudotopological models. According to the pseudotopological models proposed by Shaltiel et\u00a0al.11 and Nomidis et\u00a0al.12, SMC complexes entrap DNA pseudo-topologically, i.e. the two DNA strands that form the base of a loop pass through the ring structure formed by the SMC and kleisin subunits of these complexes. In view of the clear observation of the passage of roadblocks bigger than the SMC ring size into extruded loops in our experiments, the authors of these papers attempted to explain our observations within the context of their models. In other words, they provided an alternative interpretation of our data reported in Ref.10. The authors of the papers argued that their model was not necessarily inconsistent with our observation that large roadblocks are able to enter extruded loops, even though these roadblocks are larger than the ring size of SMC complexes. If they are correct, it would question our conclusion that the data point to a nontopological mechanism for DNA loop extrusion by SMCs. Below, we evaluate this alternative explanation in the light of our experimental observations.\nFirst, let us summarize the alternative model that Shaltiel et\u00a0al. and Nomidis et\u00a0al. proposed11,12. We focus on the model of Shaltiel et\u00a0al. who most explicitly pointed out the dynamics involved in the roadblock passage, according to their model, but the same considerations apply to the model by Nomidis et\u00a0al. Without explicitly commenting on the detailed SMC conformational changes involved in these models (which also differ between these models), we describe how these authors pursue to explain the passage of roadblocks bigger than the ring size of SMCs. Figure\u00a01a illustrates the model for roadblock passage by Shaltiel et\u00a0al. Briefly, the model for loop extrusion involves the trapping of DNA in three chambers (I, IA, and II) in yeast condensin, where extrusion is proposed to proceed through a concerted action called hold-and-feed mechanism. DNA binding to Ycg1 and the associated kleisin region act as a \u201csafety belt\u201d. DNA loading into chambers I and II initiates extrusion of DNA. Two pseudo-topologically entrapped DNA loops are thus formed; one between chambers I and II, and the second one threaded between the SMC coiled coils. Upon ATP hydrolysis, these two pseudo-topological loops merge into one loop (loop-1), and the SMC starts extrusion of the next segment of DNA. Note that the figure illustrates only tiny loops, whereas in our experiments the encounter of a large roadblock with a DNA-extruding SMC is observed when the loop has been already significantly extended. Specifically, this means that the loops sketched in most panels of the figures will in practice be a very large loop of many kbp of DNA in our experiments.\nFor comparison, Fig.\u00a01b depicts a potential nontopological model which is consistent with the crosslinking data by Shaltiel et\u00a0al. while it also allows roadblock passage8. The basic mechanism is analogous to the pseudotopological model of Shaltiel et\u00a0al. in the sense that a small DNA loop is temporarily reeled through the Smc lumen, triggered by binding of DNA on the engaged ATP heads. The N-terminal kleisin however can latch out which allows traversal of a DNA-bound protein through chamber I. Disengaging the ATP heads allows the roadblock to merge with the large, previously extruded, loop. Sealing of chamber I resets the loop extrusion cycle.\nRather than commenting on the plausibility of the various steps in these models, we here make predictions of what should be observed when a roadblock particle is encountered in the case that the pseudotopological model would hold. Subsequently we turn to the experimental observations and evaluate whether or not these predictions are confirmed by the observations.\nPredictions by the pseudotopological models. Specifically, the alternative models make the following predictions for the roadblock experiments:\nPrediction 1: Appearance of two loops in side-flow visualization. and Prediction 2: Roadblocks will reside near the stem of the loop upon encounter. When condensin encounters a large roadblock, the model predicts the existence of two loops (Fig.\u00a02a), not one, since the roadblock\u2014with its size that cannot pass the ring structure\u2014obstructs the merging of the two preformed loops described above. Next to the already formed extruded loop, a new second loop is therefore formed, where the latter loop has the roadblock particle attached.\nOne could assume (as Shaltiel et\u00a0al. appear to do without further consideration) that the preformed loop-1 might slip into loop-2, to again form 1 joint loop. This however is not the case, as can be seen from considering the force balance (Fig.\u00a03a): If side-flow is applied, several forces in action can be distinguished:\n(i) A drag force on the particle Froadblockdrag = 6\u03c0\u03b7Rv , where the viscosity is \u03b7 = 1mPas for a water-based buffer, R is the particle radius, and v the buffer flow speed. We experimentally measured the flow speed in side-flow experiments from occasionally observed beads that were not attached to DNA and were flowing through the field of view. We measured a flow speed of 79 \u00b1 26\u00a0\u00b5m/s (n = 3 independent experiments). The observed forces for different particle sizes are shown in Fig.\u00a03b,c and the values are below\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8100 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35359-2\n0.15\u00a0pN for the largest 200\u00a0nm particles, and smaller for smaller roadblocks, down to 0.02 pN for a 30\u00a0nm particle.\n(ii) Drag force on loop-1 ( Floop\u22121drag ). This can be estimated by calculating the tension on a flow-stretched DNA, as described by Pederson et\u00a0al.13 (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Practically in our experiments, by the time that a roadblock encounters condensin, the size of loop-1 is observed to typically exceed 10 kilobases, which is associated with a drag force of value more than 0.27\u00a0pN (Fig.\u00a03c).\nFigure\u00a01.

(a) The steps through the proposed DNA loop extrusion cycle are commented in more detail in steps 1\u20136 within the figure. Adapted from Ref.11. (b) Potential nontopological model which is closely analogous to the pseudotopological model, but with a slight variation in the DNA-SMC topology which allows particle bypass.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8100 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35359-2\n(iii) Drag force on loop-2 ( Floop\u22122drag ). As loop-2 is a very small nascent loop (~ 100\u00a0bp), the force acting on it is initially negligible, but it may become more significant as the loop continues to grow. The method to calculate the drag force acting on loop-2 is then analogous to loop-1.\nIt follows that upon encounter the drag force on loop-2 is nihil, while the drag force on loop-1 dominates and is larger than the drag force on the particle. As a result, the pre-encounter-formed loop-1 remains stable, while the particle remains localized close to condensin.\nAs loop extrusion proceeds, loop-2 grows and is slowly stretched alongside loop-1. Because of limitations in optical resolution, it is challenging to mutually distinguish the two loops spatially. However, the intensity of the two loops can be easily distinguished from that of a single loop by drawing intensity profiles across the loop during side-flow.

In summary, the pseudotopological model predicts the observation of two loops that should be observed in a double intensity of that of the pre-encounter-formed loop-1 (prediction 1). The nontopological model instead predicts that the roadblock can be passed by SMC complexes, and accordingly only one loop forms (Fig.\u00a01b).\nFurthermore, the pseudotopological model predicts that the roadblock, resides at the stem of the loop after encounter (prediction 2), while the second loop keeps growing. It is of interest to note two features connected to this prediction: First, the effects of spontaneous Brownian motion can be estimated to be small. F = \u2212\u03d2v + \u03b4F(t) \u2248 1fN ; where \u03d2 = 6\u03c0\u03b7R , \u03b7 is dynamic viscosity, R the radius of the particle, and the typical velocity of a 10\u00a0nm particle is conservatively estimated at its upper bound, which is ~ 1\u00a0\u03bcm/s for an active motor14. The fluctuating force is on average zero, \ufffd\u03b4F(t)\ufffd = 0 , but the autocorrelation function can be given as \ufffd\u03b4F(t)\u03b4F(t + \u03c4)\ufffd2\u03d2kT\u03b4(\u03c4) , which leads to \ufffd\u03b4F(t)2\ufffd2\u03d2kT \u2248 (1fN)2 . The Brownian forces to move the particle away from the SMC are thus very low, in the order of a few fN, so an appreciable spontaneous drifting away of the particle is very unlikely. Second, on long time scales, when the second loop would grow to a size comparable to the first loop (~ 10 kbp), the drag force on the particle plus that on loop-2 may exceed the drag force on loop-1, which may initiate a slipping process. However, this would occur only rarely in our assay due to the finite total length of the DNA which limits the overall growth of the loop. Indeed, the typical loop size of loop at the moment\nUpon buffer flow, a drag force acts on loop 1, loop 2, as well as on the roadblock.

In contrast, only one loop is predicted to appear in the nontopological model (Fig.\u00a01b), and the roadblock is expected to move away from the stem of the loop as the loop continues to grow.\nPrediction 3: Loop size will increase while the mean squared displacement may stay constant after roadblock encounter\nWhat happens when the loop extruding SMC encounters a roadblock on DNA? We note that the hold-andfeed model is not considering that loop extrusion will be blocked in this case, but rather that the roadblock ends up in a second loop. In the absence of side flow, upon encounter with the roadblock (as explained in the previous point), loop-2 with the roadblock particle grows through extrusion of DNA, but the particle stays close to the SMC due to the higher drag force on loop 1 than on the particle. This makes a specific prediction for the observation of simultaneously a continued growth of the loop size without, however, any significant increase in the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the particle, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04A. The nontopological model instead predicts that the roadblock is in the single extruded loop which enlarges further upon extrusion after roadblock passage (see previous point). Hence, as the loop grows, the MSD of the particle is expected to grow.\nExperimental tests of the predictions made above. Our previous study10 presented an abundant set of experimental observations of encounters of a loop-extruding SMC complex and a DNA-bound roadblock. Here, we test whether or not the above predictions of the pseudotopological model are confirmed by the experimental observations. For the latter, we refer to the published data10, but we here also present additional new data that were all acquired with the same methodology and under the same conditions as in Ref.10.\nTest of prediction 1. To test whether or not the extruded DNA forms one or two loops when a roadblock is encountered, we measured intensity profiles of DNA at different stages of loop extrusion after a roadblock encounter, see Fig.\u00a05. The intensity of a single loop (Fig.\u00a05a,b) was deduced from the intensity profile on the DNA\n20 40 60 80 time (s)\n0.02\n0.06\n0.10\nM SD\n(\u00b5 m\n\u00b2)\n0\n4\n8\n12\nD N\nA (k\nb)\nMSD particle\nLoop Size\n20 40 60 80 time (s)\n0.01\n0.03\n0.05\n0.07\nM SD\n(\u00b5 m\n\u00b2)\n0\n5\n10\n15\nD N\nA (k\nb)\nMSD particle\nLoop Size\nLoop Size\nb c\n0 10 20 time (s)\n0\n10\n20\nLo op\nS iz\ne ro\nllin g\nm ea\nn (k\nb)\nLoop size at Constant MSD\nd\nRoadblock at loop base.

The intensity of a single loop (i.e. I_2x) and the predicted putative double loop (I_4x) is shown in the lines in Fig.\u00a05c. We observe that the maximum intensity of the DNA equals the value of the intensity I_2x of a single loop while it never comes close to the predicted doubled loop intensity I_4x at any stage during loop extrusion at and after the encounter. From these side-flow visualizations, we thus did not obtain any indication of a doubled loop intensity (e.g. Figure\u00a05a\u2013g)\u2014in contrast to the prediction of the pseudotopological model. Our data are therefore not supporting the key predictions made by the pseudotopological model, but instead support the nontopological model.\nTest of prediction 2. The hold-and-feed model predicts that roadblocks will reside near the stem of the loop. This is, however, not observed. Instead, soon after the encounter, the roadblock is observed to be located within the extruded loop and separated from condensin or cohesin, see main figures from Pradhan et. al.10 and Fig.\u00a05a,f,h,i.\nWe can illustrate this in more detail by an example given in Fig.\u00a06. Here, the loop contained 24\u00a0kb of DNA before encounter of the roadblock. Upon encounter, the loop-extrusion speed did not abruptly change but loop extrusion continued monotonously at an approximately constant rate until the loop disrupted when it reached its final size of 30\u00a0kb. For this example, Shaltiel et\u00a0al. predict the appearance of a second loop (loop-2) of 6\u00a0kb. However, no increased intensity is observed close to the stem of the loop, see Fig.\u00a06b\u2013e. The pseudotopological model of further predicts that the roadblock initially resides at the stem of the loop until the cumulative drag force on loop-2 and roadblock exceeds the drag force on loop-1. Note that the drag force on the 24\u00a0kb-long loop-1 is very large, ~ 0.65 pN (Fig.\u00a03d), while the drag forces on the fully extruded loop-2 remain low at ~ 0.16 pN and the drag force on the particle is estimated at ~ 0.03 pN (Fig.\u00a03b\u2013d). Hence, one does not expect any slippage of loop-1 into loop-2. The roadblock should therefore, according to the pseudotopological model, reside at the loop base while the loop continues to grow. However, the roadblock was experimentally observed to clearly travel continuously (and not suddenly as predicted for a potential slipping event) along one arm of the extruded loop (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013h). Quantitatively, after the encounter, the extruded loop enlarged from 1.6\u00a0\u00b5m to 2.1\u00a0\u00b5m under sideflow conditions (due to its increase from 24 to 30\u00a0kb). Each arm of the extruded loop in the final state thus contains 15\u00a0kb (half of the entire loop). For continuous loop extrusion into one loop, one would thus expect the particle to have moved to a distance of 6\u00a0kb/15\u00a0kb \u00b7 2.1\u00a0\u00b5m = 0.84\u00a0\u00b5m from the loop stem, which indeed is in excellent agreement with measurements of the ~ 0.9\u00a0\u00b5m distance between roadblock and loop stem (Fig.\u00a06h). Yet another measure is to consider whether or not the particle moved into the loop with a speed comparable to the loop-extrusion speed. This would be expected in our scenario of continuous loop extrusion where the particle smoothly moves into the extruded loop, whereas the pseudotopological model would predict the particle to stall at the loop stem and then suddenly speed up in a slippage event. Experimentally, we observed that the particle moved over a distance of ~ 0.9\u00a0\u00b5m in 13\u00a0s, i.e. with a speed of ~ 0.07\u00a0\u00b5m/s. This fits well with the loop-extrusion speed which for this example is ~ 0.08\u00a0\u00b5m/s (since it is ~ 0.5\u00a0kb/s (Fig.\u00a06i) and the 6\u00a0kb is extruded into 0.9\u00a0\u00b5m along one arm of the loop). We thus observe that the loop-extrusion speed is the same as the velocity with which the roadblock moves away from loop base.\nThe data thus are in full accordance with continuous extrusion of the DNA and the particle into one loop, as predicted by the nontopological model, while the data are not in accordance with the pseudotopological model.\nTest of prediction 3. How do the size of the extruded DNA loop and the MSD of the particle correlate? We previously reported (Figs.\u00a01, 2, 3 and 4 of Ref.10) that we observed a strong correlation between an increase in loop size and an increase in MSD after the encounter with the roadblock. Here, we focus more in detail on stalling and passing events, where the MSD remained constant, and we searched for data that were compatible with prediction 3. In the model prediction, the loop size can grow while the MSD of the particle may stay constant (Fig.\u00a04a). Note also that here we discuss experiments without an applied side flow. Figure\u00a04b shows an example of what we called a stalling event where the MSD (black) remained constant for more than 10\u00a0s. Clearly, the corresponding loop sizes during the period when the MSD was constant (e.g. between 30 and 60\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04b and above 30\u00a0s in Fig.\u00a04c) was also found to be constant. This is the typical behavior. We examined all our stalling events (N = 15), and we found that none of the events showed a concomitant increase in loop size (see Fig.\u00a04d for additional examples). The observation that the loop size never increased while the MSD remained constant is not consistent with one of the key predictions made by the pseudotopological while it meets the expectation of the nontopological model."

            "text": "We conclude that the predictions of the pseudotopological models by Shaltiel et\u00a0al. and Nomidis et\u00a0al. are not consistent with our experimental observations. Instead, our experimental data are fully consistent with a nontopological model of loop extrusion.\nWhile the loop extrusion mechanism remains unresolved and currently a matter of strong debate, a nontopological model for condensin and cohesin can be envisioned, as outlined by Oldenkamp and Rowland8. The high structural similarity between condensin and cohesin (similar length of the SMC arms and the kleisin, presence of both HEAT-A and HEAT-B) suggests that the underlying loop extrusion mechanism is highly analogous. It is unclear if SMC5/6, which has been observed to dimerize for loop extrusion in\u00a0vitro15 and whose kleisin is almost half shorter than for condensin (402 amino acids for yeast Nse4 versus 754 amino acids for yeast Brn1), also uses a similar mechanism. The available crosslink data by Shaltiel et\u00a0al. for yeast condensin allow both a pseudotopological and a nontopological DNA entrapment. In the nontopological version, the HEAT-A-bound N-terminal fragment of the kleisin could flip open, alleviating particle bypass through the HEAT-A compartment. Upon ATP hydrolysis, the ATP heads disengage16, allowing roadblocks to pass through the ATP heads, see Fig.\u00a01b (more details of this model in Dekker, Haering, Peters, Rowland, submitted).\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8100 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35359-2\nNo Loop Pre Encounter Pre Encounter Encounter Encounter Passed\nh\nNo Loop Pre Encounter Pre Encounter Encounter Encounter Passed\nNo Loop Pre Encounter Pre Encounter Encounter Encounter Passed\na\nf\n\u221220 0 20 40 pixels\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nIn te\nns ity\n(a .u\n.)\nNo Loop\n\u221220 0 20 40 pixels\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nIn te\nns ity\n(a .u\n.)\nPre Encounter\n\u221220 0 20 pixels\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nIn te\nns ity\n(a .u\n.)\nEncounter\n\u221240 \u221220 0 20 40 pixels\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nIn te\nns ity\n(a .u\n.)\nPassedg\nI_1x\nI_2x I_2x I_2x\nb c d e\n\u221220 0 20 40 60 pixels\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nIn te\nns ity\n(a .u\n.)

Small (~ 10\u00a0nm diameter) roadblocks such as nucleosomes can be passed by SMC complexes directly, as distances of up to tens of nm between the ATPase heads have been observed in AFM images of condensin and cohesin16,17. Roadblocks of any size which bind to DNA asymmetrically on one side (like the dCas9-nanoparticle constructs used in this study) can pass as long as their DNA-binding linker is long enough. However, this scenario could differ for a symmetric protein complex that fully wraps around DNA, like for example the MCM hexamer (a part of the eukaryotic replication machinery). Roadblock passage experiments with such DNA-enclosing roadblocks would be of interest to test this prediction."

The drag force on a spherical particle is computed according to Stokes\u2019 law Fdrag = 6\u03c0\u03b7Rv , where \u03b7 = 1mPas for a water-based buffer, R is the particle radius, and v the buffer flow speed. The drag force on the extruded DNA loop is estimated based on Ref.13. Pedersen et\u00a0al. compute the parallel and perpendicular drag coefficient per unit length on a cylinder of radius 1\u00a0nm and obtain values in the range 2 \u2013 7 \u00b7 10\u22123 pN s \u00b5m\u22122 numerically and from fits to experimental data. Since the majority of the DNA loop is aligned with the buffer flow in our experiments, we consider the lower bound of these estimates, i.e. \u03b3 = 1 \u00b7 10\u22123 pN s \u00b5m\u22122 per unit length. The drag force on the extruded DNA loop is computed as Floopdrag = \u03b3 vLc where Lc is the contour length of a strand of DNA of number of basepairs N, i.e. Lc = \u03b1N \u00b7 0.34 nm , where 0.34\u00a0nm is the distance between basepairs, and \u03b1 is a factor which accounts for a slight DNA stretching when using intercalating dyes18 like Sytox Orange as in Ref.10.\nMeasurement of DNA intensity profiles in side flow images. Image frames were marked as \u201cNo Loop\u201d when loop was not yet initiated; \u201cPre Encounter\u201d when a loop was growing but the roadblock had not yet encountered (colocalized) with the stem of the loop; \u201cEncounter\u201d when the roadblock and stem of the loop colocalized; and \u201cPassed\u201d when \u201croadblock\u201d was observed inside the loop. Contour lines were manually drawn on the DNA and intensity profiles were obtained using imageJ19. Line profiles from each group were plotted together in Python.\nQuantification of loop length, size, distance to roadblock, and loop extrusion rate in side flow experiments. Intensities inside and outside the loop were extracted by manually drawing rectangular boxes with width of 11 pixels. DNA loop size was calculated as 48.5\u00a0kb \u00b7\u00a0 (Iloop/Itotal). The roadblock-loop distance was calculated by manually drawing a line between the roadblock and the stem of the loop and converting the length of the line from pixels to \u00b5m with pixel size of 0.108\u00a0\u00b5m/pixel. Similarly, loop length was calculated by drawing a line from the stem of the loop to the end of the loop and image frames with loops in the optical focus were chosen for length calculations."
