 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore other lattice structures besides FCC for the tether points, such as body-centered cubic (BCC) or hexagonal close packed (HCP), to see how the phase space geometry and non-analytic region are affected.

2. Investigate the dynamics of the phase transitions between fluid and solid phases by analyzing trajectories through the non-analytic region. This could provide insight into nucleation and growth processes. 

3. Extend the model to soft or attractive particle interactions instead of hard spheres to determine how the phase space topology changes near fluid-solid transitions.

4. Examine the effects of polydispersity and size/mass distributions of particles on the non-analytic region and phase space disconnectivity.

5. Apply the geometric phase space interpretation to other systems such as water models to gain insights into the source of their anomalous thermodynamic behavior. The collision rates could be related to hydrogen bonding network topology.
