Hopmann *b and Brandon Q. Mercadoa\nThe insertion of CO2 into metal alkyl bonds is a crucial elementary step in transition metal-catalyzed processes for CO2 utilization. Here, we synthesize pincer-supported palladium complexes of the type (tBuPBP)Pd(alkyl) (tBuPBP = B(NCH2P tBu2)2C6H4 \u2212; alkyl = CH2CH3, CH2CH2CH3, CH2C6H5, and CH2-4OMe-C6H4) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5) and compare the rates of CO2 insertion into the palladium alkyl bonds to form metal carboxylate complexes. Although, the rate constant for CO2 insertion into ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3) is more than double the rate constant we previously measured for insertion into the palladium methyl complex (tBuPBP)Pd(CH3), insertion into ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) occurs approximately one order of magnitude slower than (tBuPBP)Pd(CH3). CO2 insertion into the benzyl complexes ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2C6H5) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2-4-OMe-C6H4) is significantly slower than any of the n-alkyl complexes, and CO2 does not insert into the palladium phenyl bond of ( tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5). While ( tBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3) and ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) are resistant to b-hydride elimination, we were unable to synthesize complexes with n-butyl, iso-propyl, and tert-butyl ligands due to b-hydride elimination and\nan unusual reductive coupling, which involves the formation of new C\u2013B bonds. This reductive process also occurred for (tBuPBP)Pd(CH2C6H5) at elevated temperature and a related process involving the formation of a new H\u2013B bond prevented the isolation of (tBuPBP)PdH. DFT calculations provide insight\ninto the relative rates of CO2 insertion and indicate that steric factors are critical. Overall, this work is one of the first comparative studies of the rates of CO2 insertion into different metal alkyl bonds and provides fundamental information that may be important for the development of new catalysts for CO2 utilization."

However, at this stage there is limited experimental information on the pathways for CO2 insertion into metal alkyl bonds, as most studies have primarily involved isolated examples with a single metal complex,5\u201314 and thus, it is unclear how changing the nature of the alkyl group or ancillary ligand impacts the reaction. Further, kinetic studies are relatively rare,6,8a,b,9d,11c,13g,14b which means that computational results cannot be benchmarked against experimental data.\nPrevious kinetic studies exploring CO2 insertion into welldened metal alkyl complexes have almost exclusively focused on metal methyl species.6,8a,b,9d,11c,13g,14b This is because of the stability of metal methyl complexes, which in contrast to longer chain alkyl containing complexes, such as metal ethyl complexes, do not undergo b-hydride elimination. A major limitation in studying CO2 insertion into metal methyl bonds, and in particular the types of Group 10 metal alkyl complexes that are relevant to catalysis, is the paucity of systems that are stable and react under mild reaction conditions. Most systems require high temperatures and do not give quantitative yields of products, which prevents kinetic studies. We recently described the insertion of CO2 into palladium and nickel methyl complexes supported by RPBP (RPBP = B(NCH2PR2)2C6H4\n\u2212; R = Cy or tBu) pincer ligands (Fig. 1a).13g The strong trans-inuence of the boryl donor in the pincer ligand destabilizes the methyl group and as a consequence these complexes insert CO2 at room temperature, which enabled us to perform detailed kinetic studies on CO2 insertion into a metal methyl bond.\nWe hypothesized that the RPBP framework may stabilize palladium complexes with other alkyl ligands, as pincer ligands are known to inhibit b-hydride elimination from square planar palladium(II) complexes.15 Further, given that the RPBP ligand can facilitate CO2 insertion reactions under mild conditions,13g we postulated that the synthesis of a family of RPBP supported palladium alkyl complexes would enable us to perform a rare experimental comparison of the rates of CO2 insertion as the alkyl ligand is varied. In this work, we describe the synthesis of a series of tBuPBP supported palladium complexes with ethyl, npropyl, benzyl, and phenyl ligands. Although (tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH3) (1-Et), ( tBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3) (1- nPr), (tBuPBP)\nFig. 1 (a) Previous example of CO2 insertion into RPBP supported pall palladium complexes studied in this work, which reveal fundamental in enable a comparison between the rates of CO2 insertion as a function o\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

A similar reductive process to form a new H\u2013B bond occurs in the putative hydride complex (tBuPBP)PdH. The stability of 1-Et, 1-nPr, 1-Bn, and 1-OMeBn allowed us to determine the rates of CO2 insertion into the palladium alkyl bonds. The rate constant for CO2 insertion into 1-Et is over double the rate constant previously measured for CO2 insertion into (\ntBuPBP)Pd(CH3) (1-Me),13g while insertion into 1-nPr occurs at approximately one-tenth the rate of 1-Me. This is a remarkable difference given the relatively minor changes in the alkyl ligand. The insertion of CO2 into the benzyl complexes, 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn, is signicantly slower than any of n-alkyl complexes and CO2 does not insert into the palladium phenyl bond of the related complex (tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5) (1-Ph). DFT calculations enabled the rationalization of the relative rates of CO2 insertion and suggest that steric factors are the predominant reason for the differences in the rates of insertion between 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr. Overall, the fundamental insight on CO2 insertion provided in this work will likely assist in the development of improved and new catalysts for CO2 utilization."

Recrystallization from pentane generated crystals of 1-Et and 1-nPr suitable for X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2a and b).

Although, crystallographically characterized examples of palladium ethyl complexes are rare,15,17,20 the Pd\u2013C bond distance in 1-Et is longer than those typically reported (Pd(1)\u2013C(1) is 2.226(6) \u00c5 in 1-Et) and is most comparable to a PSiP-supported palladium ethyl complex, which also contains a strong trans-inuence donor (silyl) opposite the palladium.15 In 1-nPr the Pd(1)\u2013C(1) is 2.209(2) \u00c5, which is within error of the Pd\u2013C bond distance in 1-Et.

Analysis of the literature reveals that this is a general trend for Group 10 alkyl complexes.21 Overall, the geometrical parameters around palladium are similar in 1-Me,13g 1-Et, and 1-nPr, with the exception that the Pd\u2013C bond distance in 1-Me is slightly shorter than in 1-Et or 1-nPr (Pd(1)\u2013C(1) is 2.185(4) \u00c5 in 1-Me), which is qualitatively consistent with DFT calculations (vide infra). This suggests that as expected the change frommethyl to ethyl to n-propyl has little impact on the geometry around palladium.\nThe reaction of 1-Cl with (CH2C6H5)MgCl or (4-OMeCH2C6H4)MgCl resulted in the isolation of 1-Bn or 1-\nOMeBn, which are rare examples of pincer supported benzyl complexes,22 in yields of 45% or 55%, respectively (eqn (2)). In both cases, it is important to remove the MgCl2 by-product from the Grignard reagent or the benzyl complexes slowly convert back to 1-Cl in solution. In fact, the relatively low yields of 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn are in part due to the successive recrystallizations that are required to ensure MgCl2 impurities are not present.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The solid-state structures indicate that the geometry around palladium is distorted square planar and the geometrical parameters associated with the binding of the tBuPBP ligand in 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn are analogous to those in 1- Et and 1-nPr. The long Pd\u2013B bond distances (2.032(4) \u00c5 in 1-Bn and 2.025(3) \u00c5 in 1-OMeBn) are consistent with the high transinuence of the benzyl ligand. The benzyl ligand binds in an h1fashion with Pd\u2013C bond distances of 2.260(3) \u00c5 in 1-Bn and 2.249(3) \u00c5 in 1-OMeBn, which are longer than almost all other palladium complexes that feature an h1-benzyl ligand.22 Further, the carbon atom bound to palladium (C(1)) is signicantly distorted from tetrahedral, with Pd(1)\u2013C(1)\u2013C(2) angles of 127.7(2)\u00b0 and 123.44(18)\u00b0 observed for 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn, respectively. Although this deviation from tetrahedral is typical for Group 10 benzyl complexes,21a,c,23 these are some of the largest angles reported perhaps due to the steric congestion around the palladium.\n1-Bn is stable when le in C6D6 at room temperature, but complete decomposition is observed when it is heated for 3 days at 65 \u00b0C, with the major product being a new dimeric complex, (tBuPBBnP)2Pd2 (2-Bn, Bn = benzyl) (Fig. 4a). Based on NMR spectroscopy we propose that 1-OMeBn decomposes via a similar pathway (see ESI\u2020). 2-Bn was characterized by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 4b). In 2-Bn, two new C\u2013B bonds have formed presumably due to a reductive coupling reaction between the benzyl ligands and the boron atom of the tBuPBP ligands. This causes a reduction in the palladium center from palladium(II) in 1-Bn to palladium(0) in 2-Bn. The boron atom of the pincer ligand no longer coordinates to the palladium center and the two phosphorus donors of the new bidentate tBuPBBnP ligands do not coordinate to the same palladium center but instead coordinate to two different palladium atoms.

Consistent with the reduction in oxidation state, the geometry around the palladium centers in 2-Bn are distorted linear. We have previously observed a similar decomposition pathway for (tBuPBP)Ni(CH3), which results in the formation of a nickel(0) dinitrogen complex,13g but this is the rst time the reductive decomposition pathway has been observed for palladium. We hypothesize that reductive coupling occurs more readily in 1-Bn compared to 1-Et or 1-Me (where it is not observed to any signicant extent spectroscopically) because there is greater steric congestion in the case of the palladium benzyl complex. This is also in agreement with the observation of reductive coupling in the case of (tBuPBP)Ni(CH3) but not 1-Me, as the smaller nickel center presumably results in a more congested metal center.13g Our results suggest that C\u2013B bond formation is potentially a general decomposition pathway for RPBP supported complexes, rather than a curiosity that is only relevant to a single complex.\nAlthough the reaction between 1-Cl and EtLi results in clean formation of 1-Et, the corresponding reactions between 1-Cl and nBuLi, iPrLi, and tBuMgCl did not result in the generation of isolable palladium alkyl complexes and instead various decomposition products are observed (Table 1).24,25 In the case of tBuMgCl, the initial metathesis reaction is slow and even aer three days at room temperature some 1-Cl is still present, along with three new peaks in the 31P NMR spectra. Although we do not observe (tBuPBP)Pd(tBu) (1-tBu) directly, the peaks observed are consistent with the formation and decomposition of (tBuPBP)PdH (1-H) (vide infra and see ESI\u2020). 1-H presumably forms via b-hydride elimination from 1-tBu and in agreement with this proposal iso-butene is observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

At this time, one major peak is observed in the 31P NMR spectrum at 15.6 ppm, which based on its downeld chemical shi is unlikely to be (tBuPBP)Pd(iPr) (1-iPr). Typically, palladium(II) complexes containing a tBuPBP ligand have chemical shis between 60\u2013120 ppm, whereas the chemical shi of the free tBuPBHP ligand is 17.0 ppm.26 There is also no evidence for the generation of products associated with bhydride elimination from 1-iPr, as no signals corresponding to (tBuPBP)PdH (1-H) (or related decomposition products, vide infra) are observed in the 1H or 31P NMR spectra, and there are no resonances associated with propene in the 1H NMR spectrum. Instead, we propose that the major species in the 31P NMR spectrum is the organic compound tBuPBiPrP, which was conrmed by mass spectrometry (see ESI\u2020). We propose that tBuPBiPrP forms from the rapid reductive decomposition of 1-iPr, which is generated but not observed in the reaction. The reductive process that 1-iPr is postulated to undergo is akin to what we observed in the decomposition of 1-Bn (vide supra) in that a new C\u2013B bond is formed. However, in the case of 1-iPr, we only see the free organic product tBuPBiPrP and there is no evidence that tBuPBiPrP coordinates to palladium to form a dimer analogous to 2-Bn. Instead, palladium black\n8168 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8164\u20138179\nprecipitates out of solution. At this stage, it is unclear why tBuPBiPrP does not coordinate to palladium in a similar fashion to tBuPBBnP, and it is possible although unlikely that tBuPBiPrP is formed through a pathway that does not even involve the formation of 1-iPr.\nThe reaction between 1-Cl and nBuLi proceeds in an analogous fashion to the reaction between 1-Cl and iPrLi and ultimately gives palladium black and tBuPBnBuP. However, the proposed intermediate alkyl complex, (tBuPBP)Pd(nBu) (1-nBu), is more stable and at \u221235 \u00b0C the reaction mixture contained primarily 1-nBu (\u223c97%), with only a small amount of the organic decomposition product tBuPBnBuP (\u223c3%) (see ESI\u2020). Heating the sample to room temperature resulted in an increase in the amount of decomposition product and it was not possible to isolate 1-nBu. In contrast, as described above, it is possible to cleanly isolate 1-nPr from the reaction between 1-Cl and nPrMgCl and decomposition of 1-nPr only occurs at 60 \u00b0C (eqn (2)). In this case, propene is observed in the 1H NMR spectra along with products consistent with the formation and decomposition of 1-H (vide infra), suggesting that decomposition primarily occurs via b-hydride elimination. Similar decomposition via b-hydride elimination is observed at 65 \u00b0C for 1-Et, with ethylene observed as a by-product. We also examined the stability of previously reported 1-Me13g and demonstrated that at 65 \u00b0C it undergoes very slow C\u2013B reductive coupling to form (tBuPBMeP)2Pd2 (2-Me) (see ESI\u2020).

Interestingly, the least and most sterically bulky complexes decompose via b-hydride elimination, while those with intermediate steric properties decompose through reductive coupling. 1-Me is an exception as it lacks any b-hydrogens and therefore despite its small size decomposes via reductive coupling.\nTo verify our hypothesis that the rapid decomposition of 1-tBu results in the formation of the palladium hydride complex 1-H, we attempted to independently prepare 1-H. Reaction of 1- Cl with 1 equivalent of LiHBEt3 in C6D6 generated two major products in an approximately 55 : 45 ratio by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). We propose that one of these is 1-H because the 31P NMR chemical shi (115 ppm, 55%) is very close to the shi for the corresponding (tBuPBP)PtH complex (114.5 ppm).27 The other resonance in the 31P NMR spectra is observed at 96.4 ppm, but even though it is present in both the decomposition of 1-tBu, 1-Et, and 1-nPr, as well as the attempted direct synthesis of 1-H, we are unsure of the identity of the complex giving rise to this signal. Further, although the complex giving rise to the signal at 96.4 ppm is relatively stable over 12 hours, the complex giving rise to the signal at 115 ppm decomposes at room temperature in C6D6 to give a dimeric palladium(0) complex, 2-H, in which the hydride has reductively coupled with the boron atom of the tBuPBP ligand to give a new H\u2013B bond (Fig. 5). This is an analogous process to the decomposition of 1-Bn, except an H\u2013B bond is formed instead of a C\u2013B bond. 2-H was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n(Fig. 5b) and contains two distorted linear palladium(0) centers. The phosphorous atoms of the pincer ligands have rearranged so they bind to two different palladium centers rather than a single palladium center. In this case, it is presumably not steric factors that drive the decomposition of the palladium hydride but the formation of a strong H\u2013B bond. Given the large number of stable pincer-supported palladium hydrides,28 we hypothesize that 1-H is unstable because of the trans-inuence of the boryl ligand, which signicantly destabilizes the hydride relative to other species which have weaker trans-inuence ligands opposite the hydride.\nTo compare the reactivity of tBuPBP supported palladium alkyl complexes with a tBuPBP supported palladium aryl species, we prepared (tBuPBP)Pd(C6H5) (1-Ph) (eqn (2)). Although, the synthesis of 1-Ph followed the same route as the palladium alkyl species described above,29 the reaction of 1-Cl with PhMgBr was signicantly slower than the corresponding reactions with alkyl lithium or Grignard reagents. Specically, the reaction with PhMgBr took two days to reach completion at room temperature, whereas the reactions with alkyl lithium or Grignard reagents were typically complete in less than one hour at room temperature (except for tBuMgCl). This is likely related to the lower nucleophilicity of aryl Grignard reagents compared with alkyl Grignard reagents. Aer recrystallization to remove Mg salt impurities, we were able to isolate 1-Ph in 66% yield. 1-Ph was characterized by X-ray crystallography (see ESI\u2020). The Pd\u2013C bond distance in is 2.162(3) \u00c5, which is signicantly shorter than the Pd\u2013C bond length in all of our palladium alkyl complexes.

We performed kinetics experiments under pseudorst order conditions with an excess of CO2 and measured both the disappearance of 1-Et and the appearance of 3-Et (Fig. 8a). The reaction is rst order in both 1-Et and [CO2], so the overall rate law is k1[(\ntBuPBP)Pd(CH2CH3)][CO2] (Fig. 8b and ESI\u2020). We were able to obtain values of k1 at different temperatures by dividing the kobs values obtained from a plot of ln([(\ntBuPBP) Pd(CH2CH3)]) versus time by the concentration of CO2 (Table 2 and ESI\u2020). The most striking feature of our k1 values is that at 40 \u00b0C, the rate constant for CO2 insertion into 1-Et is more than double the rate constant for insertion into 1-Me that we measured previously.13g In the only other comparative study of the rates of CO2 insertion into metal methyl and ethyl species, Darensbourg and co-workers observed that CO2 insertion into [RW(CO)5]\n\u2212 (R = CH3 or CH2CH3) is 1.5 times faster for methyl than for ethyl, the opposite trend to our system.8b At this stage, given the paucity of other comparative studies on the rates of CO2 insertion into different metal alkyls, it is unclear if either result is an outlier or the nature of the underlying factors that cause the variation in trends.\nUsing the values of k1 at different temperatures we determined the activation parameters for CO2 insertion into 1-Et through Eyring analysis. The enthalpy of activation, DH\u2021, is 11.3 \u00b1 1.1 kcal mol\u22121, the entropy of activation, DS\u2021, is \u221229.0 \u00b1 2.9 cal mol\u22121 K\u22121, and DG\u2021298 is 20.0 \u00b1 2.0 kcal mol\n\u22121 (see ESI\u2020). All of these values are within error to those previously measured for 1-Me,13g suggesting that the reactions proceed via similar pathways. The enthalpy for CO2 insertion into 1-Et is lower than that observed for insertion into palladium methyl complexes with pincer ligands that contain a lower trans-inuence donor in the central position. For example, DH\u2021 for CO2 insertion into (tBuPCP)Pd(CH3) ( tBuPCP = 2,6-C6H3(CH2P tBu2)2) is 17.4 \u00b1 1.7 kcal mol\u22121.14b This is consistent with the tBuPBP ligand destabilizing 1-Et by weakening the Pd\u2013C bond of the palladium\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nethyl ligand. The negative entropy of activation is similar to those observed in other systems for CO2 insertion13g,14b and is in agreement with a rate-limiting transition state in which two molecules are combining to form one compound in the transition state.\nThe reaction of 1-nPr with 1 atm of CO2 in C6D6 at room temperature also cleanly generated the palladium carboxylate complex (tBuPBP)Pd{OC(O)CH2CH2CH3} (3-\nnPr) (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, CO2 insertion into 1-\nnPr is signicantly slower than the corresponding insertion reactions with 1-Me and 1-Et. In the case of 1-nPr, the reaction required 3 days to reach completion at room temperature.31 This slow rate of insertion precluded the measurement of a rate constant using our NMR method, but based on the reaction half-life of approximately 11 hours we estimate that insertion into 1-nPr occurs approximately one order of magnitude slower than the rate of insertion into 1-Me. Further, we were unable to heat the reaction of 1-nPr with CO2 to sufficiently speed up the reaction, as this resulted in decomposition of 1-nPr. Overall, our results show that the simple change in alkyl group from 1-Me to 1-Et to 1-iPr results in\nH2CH3) (1-Et) at 30 \u00b0C in C6D6 with 1 atm of CO2 showing (a) the H3} (3-Et) as a function of time and (b) the ln of the concentration of\nChem.

This is potentially important in catalysis as it implies the rate of CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes (and potentially other metal alkyl complexes) will be heavily substrate dependent.\nThe reactions of the benzyl complexes 1-Bn and 1-OMeBnwith 1 atm of CO2 at room temperature formed the carboxylate complexes (tBuPBP)Pd{OC(O)CH2C6H5} (3-Bn) and (\ntBuPBP)Pd {OC(O)CH2-4-OMe-C6H4} (3-\nOMeBn), respectively (Fig. 6). These reactions were signicantly slower than the corresponding insertion reactions with 1-Me, 1-Et, or even 1-nPr. For example, in C6D6 at room temperature the reactions took approximately 5 days to reach completion. The slower rate of insertion into palladium benzyl complexes compared with palladium n-alkyl complexes is unsurprising as the benzylic carbon bound to palladium is expected to be a worse nucleophile due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the aromatic group, which makes it less energetically favorable to attack electrophilic CO2. In order to measure the kinetics of insertion into 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn we needed to increase the rate of the reaction. Unfortunately, it is not possible to raise the temperature to promote CO2 insertion into 1-Bn in C6D6 as this leads to decomposition to form the palladium(0) complex, 2-Bn, as well as the CO2 inserted product. However, we have previously demonstrated that the rates of CO2 insertion reactions can be increased by performing the reaction in solvents with a higher Dimroth\u2013 Reichardt ET(30) parameter,13g,32 which is an empirical measure of the polarity of a solvent.33,34 When CO2 insertion reactions were performed in pyridine-d5, the reactions with 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn were complete in approximately 5 hours at room temperature, with no evidence for the formation of palladium(0) complexes. This again highlights the dramatic effect of solvent on CO2 insertion reactions.13g,32,35 At 30 \u00b0C, the rate constants for CO2 insertion into 1-Bn and 1-\nOMeBn in pyridined5 were 0.0048 \u00b1 0.0005 and 0.0043 \u00b1 0.0004 M\n\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. The fact that these values are the same within error indicates that the substitution on the phenyl ring surprisingly does not signicantly affect the nucleophilicity of the carbon bound to palladium and means that in the catalytic carboxylation of benzylic substrates36 the electronic effect of the substituents on the rate of CO2 insertion is likely minimal. Unfortunately, we are unable to measure the rate constants for CO2 insertion into 1-Me or 1-Et in pyridine-d5 because the reaction occurs too fast to obtain an accurate rate constant using NMR spectroscopy. However, we estimate a minimum rate constant of 0.2 M\u22121 s\u22121, which is signicantly faster than for the benzyl compounds.\nIn contrast to our results with palladium alkyl complexes, no reaction was observed when 1-Ph was treated with 1 atm of CO2, even aer prolonged heating at elevated temperature. Although at this stage it is unclear whether kinetic or thermodynamic factors are responsible for the lack of reactivity, our result is consistent with observations for other pincer supported Group 10 phenyl complexes, which also do not react with CO2.13b,e Hence, although the PBP ligand promotes CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl complexes, it does not facilitate insertion reactions into palladium aryl complexes.\n8172 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8164\u20138179\nComputational studies of CO2 insertion into palladium alkyl and aryl complexes\nWe performed DFT calculations (PBE0-D3BJ, IEFPCM) to further understand the mechanism of CO2 insertion into 1-Me, 1-Et, 1-nPr, 1-Bn, and 1-OMeBn. Previously, we have demonstrated that CO2 insertion into 1-Me follows an SE2 (or outersphere) pathway (Fig. 9a),13g in which the rst and rate-limiting step is nucleophilic attack of the carbon atom of the palladium methyl on the electrophilic carbon atom of CO2 to form the C\u2013C bond. Notably, there is no interaction between CO2 and the palladium center at the transition state. The second step in CO2 insertion into 1-Me via an SE2 pathway has a signicantly lower barrier and involves the rearrangement of an carboxylatepalladium ion pair, bound through a C\u2013H s-bond, to the neutral Pd\u2013O containing product.13g An alternative pathway involving 1,2-insertion (innersphere, Fig. 9b) in which both the Pd\u2013O and C\u2013C bonds are formed at the same transition state was calculated to be energetically unfavorable for 1-Me.\nHere, we calculated that for CO2 insertion into 1-Et, the barrier for the rst step in the SE2 pathway is 17.7 kcal mol\n\u22121 at 298 K (Fig. 10, Table 3).37 This is in good agreement with the experimentally determined barrier of 20.0\u00b1 2.0 kcal mol\u22121 (vide supra). The barrier for the innersphere 1,2-insertion pathway is calculated to be 26.0 kcal mol\u22121, unambiguously indicating that the SE2 pathway is preferred. A surprising feature of 1-Et is that it does not undergo facile b-hydride elimination. We calculated that the barrier for b-hydride elimination is relatively high (32.3 kcal mol\u22121), consistent with the stability of the complex towards b-hydride elimination. b-Hydride elimination is presumably disfavored because of the rigidity of the pincer ligand, which makes it energetically difficult for the complex to distort to form the syn co-planar arrangement of the palladium, Ca, Cb, and H required for b-hydride elimination.\nDFT calculations predict that the barriers for CO2 insertion into 1-Me and 1-nPr are 19.4 kcal mol\u22121 and 21.8 kcal mol\u22121(Table 3), respectively, which means that the calculations are in line with the experimental trends in rate (1- Et > 1-Me > 1-nPr).38 The rate-determining transition states for CO2 insertion into 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-\nnPr are analogous (the rst step in the SE2 mechanism), so the differences in rate are not related to a change in mechanism. Instead, we propose that the difference in rates is due primarily to steric factors, which affect the relative stability of both the reactant complexes and the transition states. 1-Et and 1-nPr are likely slightly destabilized relative to 1-Me because of steric interactions between the ethyl or propyl ligand and the tert-butyl substituents of the tBuPBP ligand. This is reected by the increased thermodynamic favorability of CO2 insertion into 1-Et and 1-\nnPr compared to 1- Me (DG\u00b0 = \u221227.5 and \u221226.2 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, versus \u221222.9 kcal mol\u22121). Presumably, in the carboxylate complexes, the steric pressure is relieved because of the absence of hydrogens on the oxygen bound to palladium.\nThe steric properties of 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr were quantitatively evaluated by calculating the percent buried volume (% VBur) of these complexes based on their crystal structures using the Salerno molecular buried volume program (SambVca 2.1)\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Our proposal is that 1-Et is sufficiently sterically crowded to destabilize the\nFig. 10 Relative free energies of CO2 insertion into 1-Et via an SE2 (outers b-hydride elimination.

Finally, the trajectory of electrophilic attack of CO2 is quite different for 1-Me compared to 1-Et and 1-nPr. In 1-Me the CO2 is nearly orthogonal to the palladium methyl bond, whereas in 1-Et and 1-nPr is it essentially co-planar (Fig. 12). In 1-Et and 1-Pr this geometry leads to close contacts between three C\u2013H bonds and the incipient carboxylate group, which may help stabilize the emerging charge on the carboxylate group. We were unable to locate a similar TS geometry for insertion into 1-Me, and in the calculated TS there are only interactions between two C\u2013H bonds and the incipient carboxylate group. In the case of 1-Pr, destabilization due to steric strain is likely a larger force than stabilization due to an extra non-covalent interaction and therefore the overall barrier is higher.\nTo further probe the role of steric factors on the rates of CO2 insertion, we performed calculations on the smaller model complexes (RPBP)Pd(alkyl) (R=Me or iPr; alkyl= CH3, CH2CH3, or CH2CH2CH3). Interestingly, in the case of\nMePBP, DFT predicts that the preferred CO2 insertion pathway changes from\nFig. 11 Topographic steric maps of (a) 1-Me, (b) 1-Et, and (c) 1-nPr as vi\n8174 | Chem.

We propose that complexes with a smaller steric prole are more likely to react via a 1,2-insertion pathway compared with complexes that are more congested, because in this case it is easier for CO2 to interact with the metal center. Further, in the case of MePBP supported complexes, the calculated rates of insertion are the same for the methyl, ethyl, and npropyl species, suggesting that the nature of the alkyl group is less important for systems that react through a 1,2-insertion pathway. This is unsurprising, as in the 1,2-insertion pathway the metal center is directly involved, which likely lessens the impact of the alkyl group. For the iPrPBP supported palladium complexes, 1,2-insertion is preferred for (iPrPBP)Pd(CH3), whereas the SE2 pathway is preferred for the ethyl and propyl complexes, with the later showing higher barriers than (iPrPBP) Pd(CH3). The barrier for insertion into (\niPrPBP)Pd(CH2CH3) is lower than for (iPrPBP)Pd(CH2CH2CH3), indicating that there is a steric effect with the iPrPBP pincer ligand. The computed results with the smaller ancillary ligands suggest that the observation that CO2 insertion is faster for 1-Et than for 1-Me or 1-nPr is unlikely to be general to all systems. The tBuPBP ligand creates a sufficiently crowded environment where a minor change in the sterics results in non-intuitive changes in rate, whereas for other supporting ligands this will not be the case, as evidenced by our calculated results with iPrPBP and MePBP.\nWe next investigated the barriers for CO2 insertion into the palladium benzyl complexes 1-Bn, 1-OMeBn, as well as the hypothetical complex (tBuPBP)Pd(CH2-4-CF3-C6H4) (1-\nCF3Bn) (Table 3). The calculated barrier for CO2 insertion into 1-Bn (20.3 kcal mol\u22121) is higher than for 1-Me and 1-Et, in agreement with our experimental observations. In contrast, we computationally predict that insertion into 1-nPr is more challenging than insertion into 1-Bn, which contradicts our experimental results, but likely reects some computational error. When calculations were performed with other functionals (see ESI\u2020), there were cases where the barrier for insertion into 1-Bn was higher than for 1-nPr, indicating that different DFT functionals provide slighty different TS structures. The lowest energy pathway for insertion into 1-Bn involves an SE2 mechanism and the geometric parameters at the transition state for insertion are similar to those observed for 1-Me, 1-Et, and 1-nPr.

This is unexpected as it suggests that the impact of the para-substituent on the nucleophilicity of the benzylic carbon is negligible even though this substituent should impact the energy of the p*-orbital which stabilizes or destabilizes the carbon. Nevertheless, our calculations are in agreement with the experimental rate constants of 1-Bn and 1-OMeBn being within error (vide supra).\nIn contrast to the facile insertion of CO2 into palladium alkyl complexes supported by tBuPBP ligands, we did not observe CO2 insertion into 1-Ph. To understand this reactivity, we calculated the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters associated with CO2 insertion into 1-Ph. Although the reaction is considerably thermodynamically downhill (by \u221219.2 kcal mol\u22121), the kinetic barrier is 34.6 kcal mol\u22121, which explains why no reaction is observed experimentally. Consistent with our previous results for CO2 insertion into palladium\u2013C(sp\n2) bonds,40 the transition state is classied as innersphere, with a Pd\u2013CCO2 interaction of 3.03 \u00c5.

In this case, the activation energy associated with an innersphere transition state is 46.3 kcal mol\u22121, indicating that inuence of the tBuPBP ligand is signicant. However, in order for CO2 insertion to become kinetically viable experimentally, a different approach needs to be adopted than introducing a stronger trans-inuence ligand opposite the phenyl ligand, as the tBuPBP ligand is one of the strongest trans-inuence ligands available and it does not lower the activation energy for CO2 insertion enough for the reaction to proceed under mild conditions."

In contrast, tBuPBP supported palladium complexes with n-butyl, iso-propyl, and tert-butyl ligands were either unstable or could not be observed. The rates of decomposition of the alkyl complexes are related to the steric bulk of the alkyl ligand with a putative tert-butyl complex decomposing faster than the ethyl species. The palladium alkyl complexes decompose via two different routes. The least and most sterically bulky complexes containing ethyl or tert-butyl ligands decompose via b-hydride elimination. In contrast, complexes containing n-butyl and iso-propyl ligands are stable towards bhydride elimination and along with benzyl complexes decompose via an uncommon reductive coupling reaction, which involves the formation of a new C\u2013B bond and either welldened palladium(0) dimers or palladium black. Attempts to synthesize a tBuPBP supported palladium hydride were unsuccessful because a similar reductive coupling occurred to generate a dimeric palladium(0) complex with two new H\u2013B bonds. The observation of decomposition via reductive coupling across a series of complexes conrms that this is a general reaction for RPBP supported complexes.\ntBuPBP ligated palladium complexes with ethyl, n-propyl, and benzyl ligands all cleanly insert CO2 to form the corresponding carboxylate complexes, allowing for a rare study of the rates of CO2 insertion across an analogous series of metal alkyl complexes. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the rate of CO2 insertion into 1-Et is more than double the rate for insertion into 1-Me, which in turn is ten times faster than the rate of insertion into 1-nPr. CO2 insertion into\ntBuPBP supported palladium benzyl complexes is much slower than insertion into n-alkyl complexes, likely because the carbon atom of the benzyl group is less nucleophilic. DFT calculations indicate that insertion reactions into 1-Me, 1-Et, 1-nPr, and 1-Bn proceed via an outersphere SE2 pathway and steric factors are responsible for the observed differences in rate between the n-alkyl complexes. They also suggest that the counterintuitive trends in the rates of CO2 insertion observed in the present work will not occur for all metal alkyl systems but are related to the specic steric factors present in this group of complexes.

Overall, our results highlight how the rates of CO2 vary across an analogous series of palladium alkyl and aryl complexes and DFT calculations provide explanations for the observed trends. This information will be valuable for the development of catalytic reactions that involve CO2 insertion into metal alkyl bonds as an elementary step."
