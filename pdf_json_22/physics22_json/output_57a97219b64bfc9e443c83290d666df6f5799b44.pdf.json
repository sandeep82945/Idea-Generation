            "text": "In the last decade properties of quantum entanglement in field theory have attracted much scrutiny. The many motivations for this interest include, among others, the study of topological phases of matter, holographic duality, and quantum computing. This paper applies to a new theory a recently invented tool that characterizes field theoretic entanglement: modular parallel transport [1]. The idea of modular parallel transport is that varying the entanglement of a field theory subregion posits a transport problem, which is familiar from the study of Berry phases [2]. Whereas Berry studied varying dynamical Hamiltonians, modular parallel transport is concerned with varying modular or entanglement Hamiltonians. Whereas Berry\u2019s transport fixes the ambiguous U(1) phase of a quantum state, modular parallel transport fixes a larger ambiguity valued in the commutant of the modular Hamiltonian. Modular parallel transport can be studied both for variations of the state on one local region, and for varying\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nthe region itself while working in one fixed global state. The latter instance \u2014 which is also the subject of the present paper \u2014 plays a significant role in holographic duality: its holonomies encapsulate intuitive features of the bulk geometry, including lengths of curves [3] and integral transforms of bulk curvature [1]. This paper studies modular parallel transport in a non-holographic setting. We consider varying a multi-interval region drawn from the global vacuum of the 1+1-dimensional free fermion theory. This instance of modular parallel transport is interesting for several reasons. First, explicitly computable examples of modular parallel transport are few and far between because knowing the exact modular Hamiltonian \u2014 a notoriously difficult problem \u2014 is a prerequisite. The free fermion is one of the few quantum field theories for which vacuum modular Hamiltonians are known for arbitrary, disjoint regions [4, 5]. Second, modular parallel transport is best understood in holographic theories, whose entanglement simplifies at leading order in a small parameter conventionally denoted 1/N . (In 1+1 dimensions, that parameter can be identified with 1/c, where c is the central charge.) Leading order expressions in 1/N denote bulk geometric quantities, including areas of surfaces and diffeomorphisms that perturb them. On the other hand, recent work has given evidence that 1/N corrections are essential for understanding several key problems of gravity, including the black hole information paradox [6]. This motivates exploring modular parallel transport beyond leading order in 1/N . The free fermion is far from holographic settings, but it has the advantage of being computable exactly, not in an approximation or expansion. To help the reader digest our results, we highlight two qualitative questions to bear in mind. The first is about the degree of non-locality in modular parallel transport. In holographic duality, modular parallel transport is dual to bulk diffeomorphisms, which map one Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) [7] surface to another and act everywhere orthogonally to the initial surface [1]. Therefore, at leading order in 1/N , modular parallel transport of disjoint regions must decouple into a collection of smaller, independent modular transport problems \u2014 one per connected component of the bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface. When we include 1/N corrections, this decoupling disappears because at this order the modular Hamiltonian is sensitive to the entanglement of bulk fields; the generators of modular parallel transport then become non-local. We have no prior data on such non-local effects in modular parallel transport. The free fermion is the first \u2014 albeit imperfect \u2014 laboratory in which to inspect them. Note that this problem requires the study of modular parallel transport of disjoint regions, which almost uniquely singles out the free fermion. The second pertinent question concerns the half-sided modular inclusion [8, 9]. It is a technical condition, which associates the embedding of a smaller algebra of observables within a larger one to a special form of quantum entanglement. In 1+1-dimensional quantum field theory, for algebras of observables in causal diamonds that differ by a null deformation at one endpoint, this condition is obeyed by the entanglement of the global vacuum state. That fact, as well as its generalization to higher-dimensional conformal field theories, plays an important role in holographic duality: it explains the emergent Poincar\u00e9 symmetry of the bulk geometry [10\u201312]. For our purposes, it is important that modular inclusion \u2014 when it applies \u2014 simplifies the computation of modular parallel transport into the form given in equation (4.29). In this paper, we first compute modular parallel\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\ntransport without the benefit of modular inclusion. After finding (4.29), we verify that modular inclusion does in fact apply to multi-interval regions of the free fermion. In the Discussion, we contrast these results with the 1+1-dimensional free boson theory, in which modular parallel transport is not determined by modular inclusion. The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews modular parallel transport and related concepts, as well as the multi-interval modular Hamiltonian in the 1+1- dimensional free fermion. Section 3 covers preliminaries for the calculation: it computes commutators of frequently encountered terms, and constructs modes of definite modular energy. Section 4 contains the main result: it computes the two-interval modular parallel transport generators in equations (4.26)\u2013(4.27) and in (4.29). We also make some novel observations about the modular parallel transport of single intervals, which is universal for all 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories in the vacuum. Section 5 examines the limiting behavior of the modular parallel transport generators as two constituent intervals shrink or get far apart. In contrast to exact single-interval answers and to holographic intuitions, we find that non-local terms remain important in all non-trivial limits. Section 6 computes the curvature two-form of the two-interval modular parallel transport. The body of the paper focuses for clarity on the modular transport of double intervals, but the case of multiple intervals behaves similarly and is captured exactly by equation (7.1). We situate our calculations in a broader context \u2014 including the multi-interval generalization \u2014 in section 7."

Take a fixed global state |\u03a8\u3009 \u2208 HCFT and, for each R(\u03bb), compute the two-sided modular Hamiltonian Hmod(\u03bb). If the reduced density operators \u03c1R(\u03bb) = TrR(\u03bb)c |\u03a8\u3009\u3008\u03a8| (as well as \u03c1R(\u03bb)c) are well-defined then the two-sided modular Hamiltonian is\nHmod(\u03bb) = Hmod, one-sidedR(\u03bb) \u2297 1R(\u03bb)c \u2212 1R(\u03bb) \u2297H mod, one-sided R(\u03bb)c , (2.1)\nwhere \u03c1R(\u03bb) = exp(\u2212Hmod, one-sidedR(\u03bb) ) and likewise for \u03c1R(\u03bb)c . In general, however, the onesided objects are not well-defined operators and we must work with the two-sided Hmod(\u03bb), which always exists. In what follows we omit the epithet \u2018two-sided\u2019 to avoid cluttering the text. The one-parameter family of modular Hamiltonians Hmod(\u03bb) naturally define a transport problem, which can be described as follows. If the Hamiltonians can be diagonalized then we write them in the form\nHmod(\u03bb) = U \u2020(\u03bb)D(\u03bb)U(\u03bb), (2.2)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nwhere D(\u03bb) is a diagonal matrix of modular energies. Differentiating with respect to \u03bb gives:\n\u2202\u03bbH mod = [ \u2202\u03bbU \u2020U,Hmod ] + U \u2020\u2202\u03bbDU (2.3)\nThe second term commutes with the modular Hamiltonian; following [1, 15] we call such operators zero modes. It then makes sense to look for operators V (\u03bb), which satisfy:\n\u2202\u03bbH mod(\u03bb) = [ V (\u03bb), Hmod(\u03bb) ] + zero modes (2.4)\nOne way to describe V is as a Heisenberg-picture \u2018Hamiltonian,\u2019 which transports observables from one region to another in the family R(\u03bb). Certainly \u2202\u03bbU \u2020U is one such V , but so is every operator of the form (\u2202\u03bbU \u2020U+ zero modes). In other words, equation (2.4) \u2014 as a condition for an unknown V (\u03bb) \u2014 has an ambiguity parameterized by zero modes of Hmod(\u03bb). Modular parallel transport fixes this ambiguity and selects a unique solution by the condition:[\nV,Hmod ] = (1\u2212 P0)\u2202\u03bbHmod (2.5)\nP0[V ] = 0 (2.6)\nHere P0[V ] is a projector onto zero-modes of Hmod, which we assume exists; see [1] for its explicit definition. In the setup (2.2), the solution of (2.5)\u2013(2.6) is:\nV = (1\u2212 P0)[\u2202\u03bbU \u2020U ] (2.7)\nIf the Hmods in (2.5)\u2013(2.6) were dynamical Hamiltonians over a finite-dimensional Hilbert space then these equations would describe the non-Abelian generalization [16] of the Berry phase [2]. Indeed, the zero modes by which candidate solutions V (\u03bb) differ from one another are directly analogous to phases of ground states, which the system visits due to a slowly changing dynamical Hamiltonian. For this reason, the holonomies of modular parallel transport have been called modular Berry phases. In holographic duality, modular Hamiltonians H(\u03bb) are known to generate an orthogonal boost symmetry [17] in the neighborhood of an extremal surface called Ryu-Takayanagi surface [7]. Therefore, equation (2.5) can be understood in the bulk as a surface-changing diffeomorphism. The modular parallel condition (2.6) identifies a unique such diffeomorphism, which has no longitudinal (surface-preserving) and no local little-group (orthogonal boost) component [1]. In this way, modular parallel transport gives a boundary handle on bulk diffeomorphisms in holographic duality. Part of the exercise in this paper is to see how the free fermion \u2014 which is not a holographic theory \u2014 differs from holographic theories in its modular parallel transport."

            "text": "We now specialize to the free fermion theory in 1 + 1-dimensional flat space. The theory decomposes into two decoupled chiral sectors, which can be described using coordinates z = x \u2212 t and z\u0304 = x + t. For simplicity we focus on the left-moving sector, in which the (chiral component of) the fermion satisfies the anti-commutation relation\n{\u03c8(z), \u03c8\u2020(w)} = \u03b4(z \u2212 w) (2.8)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nWe are interested in the vacuum modular Hamiltonian for a two-interval region I1\u222aI2 = (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) in z-space. It was found in [4, 5] to take the following form:\nHmod = 2\u03c0i \u222b dz ( hT (z)T (z) + hC(z)\u03c8\u2020(z)\u03c8(z\u0303) ) (2.9)\nT (z) = 12 ( \u2202\u03c8\u2020(z)\u03c8(z)\u2212 \u03c8\u2020(z)\u2202\u03c8(z) ) (2.10)\nhT (z) = ( \u2202z log [ \u2212(z \u2212 a1)(z \u2212 a2)(z \u2212 b1)(z \u2212 b2) ])\u22121 (2.11) hC(z) = \u2202z z\u0304\nz \u2212 z\u0304 hT (z) (2.12)\nEquation (2.10) and all operators in this paper are normal-ordered. Modular Hamiltonian (2.9) involves a function z\u0303(z), which is:\nz\u0303(z) = a1a2(z \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2)\u2212 b1b2(z \u2212 a1 \u2212 a2)(a1 + a2 \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2)z \u2212 a1a2 + b1b2 (2.13)\nIt is a map, which exchanges intervals I1 and I2 point-wise. It is straightforward to confirm that z\u0303(a1) = a2 and z\u0303(b1) = b2 and, more generally, that z\u0303(z\u0303(z)) = z. The new feature of this modular Hamiltonian is that, in addition to the local stress tensor T (z), it involves the non-local current \u03c8\u2020(z)\u03c8(z\u0303). We will probe this non-locality using modular parallel transport. Loosely speaking, we may think of this non-locality as a small N precursor of something that is familiar from holographic duality: that disjoint intervals can have a connected entanglement wedge. The free fermion is, of course, not holographic, so the connection between these facts is rather crude. Nevertheless, we will find this point of view useful in section 6, when we discuss the curvature of modular parallel transport. The modular Hamiltonian for n > 2 intervals was also found in [4, 5]. Its schematic structure is the same as (2.9).\nMulti-local symmetry. One fact, which enables an explicit computation of Hamiltonian (2.9), is that the algebra of observables of the chiral fermion on n > 1 intervals has a vacuum-preserving isomorphism with the observable algebra of n species of fermion on a single interval [13, 14]. In other words, the fermions on distinct intervals act like replicas of one another in all correlation functions. References [13, 14] refer to this fact as a multi-local symmetry and we adopt the same terminology. It is easiest to take the fiducial interval hosting the n species of fermions to be I = (0,\u221e). We will call the isomorphism in question \u03b2n:\n\u03b2n : A\u2297n(I) 7\u2192 A(I1 \u222a I2 \u222a . . . In) (2.14)\nExplicit calculations in this paper will involve \u03b22, which we denote simply \u03b2 to avoid clutter. The existence of \u03b2 is a special, delicate property of the fermion. Isomorphisms like (2.14) can sometimes be found for other theories, but vacuum-preserving isomorphisms are rare [18, 19]. One benefit of isomorphism (2.14) is that it allows us to intertwine modular flows:\n\u03c3tA(I1\u222aI2) = \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03c3 t A\u22972(I) \u25e6 \u03b2 \u22121 (2.15)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nHere \u03c3tA(\u00b7) defines the flow exp(itHmod)(\u00b7) exp(\u2212itHmod) in algebra A generated by the vacuum modular Hamiltonian. Note that the vacuum-preserving property of \u03b2 is essential to make sense of (2.15). The intertwining relation makes it manageable to compute modular flow in algebra A(I1 \u222a I2) explicitly. That is because \u03c3tA\u22972(I) is a simple boost, as is known from the famous Bisognano-Wichman theorem [20]. To compute \u03c3tA(I1\u222aI2) explicitly we need to know \u03b2. The geometric space, which supports the domain of \u03b2 (where I = (0,\u221e) lives) will be coordinatized by X. The first aspect of \u03b2 is a geometric map\nX(z) = \u2212(z \u2212 a1)(z \u2212 a2)(z \u2212 b1)(z \u2212 b2) , (2.16)\nwhich is two-to-one. It sends both I1 = (a1, b1) and I2 = (a2, b2) to I = (0,\u221e). It has two inverses z1 and z2, which send I back to I1 (respectively I2):\nz1,2(X) = a1 + a2 + (b1 + b2)X \u2213\n\u221a (a1 + a2 + b1X + b2X)2 \u2212 4(X + 1)(b1b2X + a1a2)\n2(X + 1) (2.17)\nThe pairing in equation (2.13) is the pairing of z1 and z2, that is z1(X(z2)) = z\u0303(z2). X-space is inhabited by two species of fermion, \u03a81(X) and \u03a82(X). We use capital \u03a8i(X) to distinguish the two fermions in I from the one fermion \u03c8(z) in algebra A(I1\u222aI2). The anti-commutation relations in X-space are:{\n\u03a8i(X),\u03a8\u2020j(Y ) } = \u03b4ij \u03b4(X \u2212 Y ) (2.18)\nThe action of the X-space modular flow is:\n\u03c3tA\u22972(I)(\u03a8i(X)) = e\u2212\u03c0t \u03a8i(Xe\u22122\u03c0t) (2.19)\nWe are now ready to exhibit \u03b2 explicitly:\n\u03b2 [\u03a8i(X)] = \u2211 j=1,2 Uij(X) \u221a \u2202Xzj(X)\u03c8(zj(X)) (2.20)\nThe matrix Uij is a gauge transformation U(X) = exp( \u03b8(X)) \u2208 O(2), where = ij is the anti-symmetric tensor and the gauge parameter reads:\n\u03b8(X) = \u222b X dX\u0303 \u221a \u2202Xz1(X\u0303) \u2202Xz2(X\u0303) z1(X\u0303)\u2212 z2(X\u0303)\n(2.21)\nThis isomorphism maps (2.9) to:\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6Hmod(z) = \u222b dXX ( T11(X) + T22(X) ) (2.22)\nHere T11 and T22 are the local stress tensors of \u03a81(X) and \u03a82(X), which have the same functional form as equation (2.10). Operator (2.22) generates boosts in X-space.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nThe gauge transformation (2.21), which is part of \u03b2, can be understood geometrically. A simple push-forward of the boost action of \u03c3tA\u22972(I) to z-space is singular when dX/dz = 0. This happens at z = z\u00b1, which equal:\nz\u00b1 = b1b2 \u2212 a1a2 \u00b1 i\n\u221a \u2212\u03be\nb1 + b2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 a2 (2.23)\nwhere \u03be = \u2212(b1 \u2212 a1)(b1 \u2212 a2)(b2 \u2212 a1)(b2 \u2212 a2) > 0 (2.24)\nGauge transformation (2.21) resolves this singularity by inducing non-trivial monodromies\n\u03a81(e2\u03c0iX\u00b1) = \u00b1\u03a82(X\u00b1) and \u03a82(e2\u03c0iX\u00b1) = \u2213\u03a81(X\u00b1), (2.25)\naround the points X\u00b1 = X(z\u00b1). For more details, see [21].\nModular parallel transport for multiple intervals in the free fermion \u2014 a guess. Equation (2.15) resembles the structure considered in equation (2.2). In particular, D appears in the same way as the X-space modular Hamiltonian (2.22) whereas the isomorphism \u03b2 roughly plays the role of U \u2020(\u03bb). We remind the reader that \u03b2 depends on \u03bb = (a1, b1, a2, b2) through the definition of X(z) and \u03b8(X). When the context requires it, we will emphasize this dependence by writing \u03b2\u03bb. This parallel suggests that the modular parallel transport operator in the free fermion might be simply:\nV = (1\u2212 P0) [ \u2202\u03bb\u03b2\u03b2 \u22121Hmod ]\n(2.26)\nThe validity of this guess is not automatic, however, because (2.7) and (2.26) are not exact analogues. Unlike the U(\u03bb) in (2.7), \u03b2\u03bb does not constitute a legal operator in any theory. Instead, it is a map from operators in one Hilbert space to operators in another:\n\u03b2\u22121 [\u03c8(zi)] = \u2211 j (U\u22121)ij(X) \u221a \u2202ziX(z) \u03a8j(X) \u2223\u2223 X=X(zi)\n(2.27)\nEven the expression d\u03bb \u2202\u03bb\u03b2 must be interpreted with care. We will take it to mean the difference between images under \u03b2\u03bb+d\u03bb and \u03b2\u03bb for infinitesimal d\u03bb. Note that this derivative is complicated: \u03bb-dependence is everywhere, including the SO(2) rotation Uij , the conformal factor \u221a \u2202ziX and the X-position of the fermion. Second, the X(z) in equation (2.16) is not unique. If we rescale X by a function of interval endpoints then X\u0303 = f(ai, bi)X has all the same properties as the original X. Such a rescaling would define a new, equally valid isomorphism \u03b2, which could potentially change (2.26). We will see in section 4.1 that artefacts of such redefinitions of \u03b2 are killed off by the projector in (2.26)."

We can use zero modes to construct so-called scrambling modes G\u00b1. They are eigenmodes of the superoperator [Hmod, . . .], whose eigenvalues saturate the modular chaos bound [11].

To get a G\u2212-type scrambling mode in our calculation, multiply the integrand in a zero mode by X. For a G+-type scrambling mode, use X\u22121 instead. This rule of thumb works because \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6Hmod = 2\u03c0iL0 in X-space, so scrambling modes must be operators of conformal weight \u00b11.

What is interesting, however, is that there exists a global choice of \u03b2\u22121 \u2014 given in equation (4.3) \u2014 for which (\u2202\u03bb\u03b2)\u03b2\u22121Hmod(1\u2212int) is already zero mode-free.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nWe will find that analogous statements continue to hold for multiple intervals:\n\u2022 Modular parallel transport is given by (1\u2212P 0)[(\u2202\u03bb\u03b2)\u03b2\u22121Hmod], where \u03b2\u22121 maps the one fermion on multiple intervals to multiple fermions on a single interval in X-space.\n\u2022 When we take the standard uniformized coordinate X = \u2212 \u220f i (z\u2212ai)\u220f\ni (z\u2212bi) then modular parallel transport is given simply by (\u2202\u03bb\u03b2)\u03b2\u22121Hmod, without the need for zero mode subtraction.\n\u2022 The generator of modular parallel transport, which shifts only left (respectively right) endpoints of intervals, is a scrambling mode with eigenvalue \u22122\u03c0i (respectively +2\u03c0i); see equation (4.5).\n4.2 Two-interval modular parallel transport in X-space\nWe map the two-interval modular Hamiltonian to X-space using \u03b2\u22121, which was defined in equation (2.20). After this transformation, the modular Hamiltonian becomes:\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6Hmod = 2\u03c0i \u222b dXX ( T1(X) + T2(X) ) (4.8)\nConsider an operator of interest in X-space:\nO = \u222b dX \u2211 ij ( Aij(X)Tij(X) +Bij(X)\u03a8\u2020i (X)\u03a8j(X) ) (4.9)\nIts commutator with the X-transformed modular Hamiltonian is:[ O, \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6Hmod ] = 2\u03c0i \u222b dX \u2211 ij [( XA\u2032ij(X)\u2212Aij(X) ) Tij(X) +XB\u2032ij(X)\u03a8 \u2020 i (X)\u03a8j(X) ] (4.10) A nice feature of this equation is that the smearing functions do not mix. (This is in contrast to z-space, where no such decoupling happens.) Therefore, setting the commutator [O, \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6Hmod] equal to the variation of \u03b2\u22121Hmod involves eight independent differential equations, which do not couple to one another.\nTo simplify subsequent formulas, we introduce a shorthand notation:\n\u03c4a1 = (b1 \u2212 a2)(b2 \u2212 a2) (b1 \u2212 a1)(b2 \u2212 a1)\nand \u03c4b1 = (b2 \u2212 a1)(b2 \u2212 a2) (b1 \u2212 a1)(b1 \u2212 a2)\n(4.11)\nThe subscript indicates the repeated quantity in the denominator, so it is consistent notation to set \u03c4a2 = \u03c4\u22121a1 and \u03c4b2 = \u03c4 \u22121 b1\n. Using these expressions, the a1-variation of the modular Hamiltonian for the two-interval region (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) is:\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 \u2202a1Hmod (4.12)\n= 2\u03c0i b2 \u2212 b1\n\u222b dX [ \u2212 b2 \u2212 a2 b2 \u2212 a1 T11(X) + b1 \u2212 a2 b1 \u2212 a1 T22(X) + \u221a \u2212\u03c4a1 ( T12(X) + T21(X) )] Comparing with equation (3.15), we see that (4.12) is already a G\u2212-type scrambling\nmode and, in particular, that it contains no zero modes. Therefore, to let O generate\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nmodular parallel transport, we set (4.12) equal to (4.10). This leads to the following differential equations for Aij :\nXA\u203211(X)\u2212A11(X) = \u2212 b2 \u2212 a2\n(b2 \u2212 b1)(b2 \u2212 a1) (4.13)\nXA\u203222(X)\u2212A22(X) = b1 \u2212 a2\n(b2 \u2212 b1)(b1 \u2212 a1) (4.14)\nXA\u203212(X)\u2212A12(X) = \u221a\u2212\u03c4a1 b2 \u2212 b1 = XA\u203221(X)\u2212A21(X) (4.15)\nWe also have B\u2032ij = 0. Even before solving these explicitly, we note that constants of integration enter the solutions in the form Aij(X) = A(0)ij (X) + aijX and Bij(X) = bij . The freedom to set the constants of integration aij and bij is the freedom of adding zero modes to operator O. Modular parallel transport calls for a zero mode-free solution, which corresponds to some particular choice of the integration constants. For Bij , the zero modefree choice is clearly Bij(X) = bij = 0.\nOne solution of (4.13)\u2013(4.15) is simply:\nO = \u2212 12\u03c0i \u03b2 \u22121 \u25e6 \u2202a1Hmod (4.16)\nWe already noted that the right hand side is zero mode-free. Therefore, this O is the generator of modular parallel transport. For a general deformation of (a1, b1)\u222a (a2, b2), we find:\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 V (2-int)\u03bb = 1\n2\u03c0i \u03b2 \u22121 \u25e6 [ \u2212\u2202a1 \u2202\u03bb \u2202a1H mod + \u2202b1 \u2202\u03bb \u2202b1H mod \u2212 \u2202a2 \u2202\u03bb \u2202a2H mod + \u2202b2 \u2202\u03bb \u2202b2H mod ]\n(4.17) Shifting left endpoints is generated by G\u2212-type scrambling modes whereas shifting right endpoints is generated by G+-type scrambling modes. This is the third and final point, which was highlighted in section 4.1. For completeness, we write down explicitly the operators, which generate modular parallel transport for an arbitrary variation of two intervals (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2). We list the explicit X-space smearing functions in the order {A11, A12, A21, A22}:\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Va1 \u2283 { \u2212 b2 \u2212 a2(b2 \u2212 b1)(b2 \u2212 a1) , \u221a\u2212\u03c4a1 b2 \u2212 b1 , \u221a\u2212\u03c4a1 b2 \u2212 b1 ,\u2212 b1 \u2212 a2(b1 \u2212 b2)(b1 \u2212 a1) } (4.18)\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Vb1 \u2283 { 0, 0, 0, (b1 \u2212 b2)X 2\n(b1 \u2212 a1)(b1 \u2212 a2)\n} (4.19)\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Va2 \u2283 { \u2212 b2 \u2212 a1(b2 \u2212 a2)(b2 \u2212 b1) , \u221a\u2212\u03c4a2 b1 \u2212 b2 , \u221a\u2212\u03c4a2 b1 \u2212 b2 ,\u2212 b1 \u2212 a1(b1 \u2212 b2)(b1 \u2212 a2) } (4.20)\n\u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Vb2 \u2283 {\n(b2 \u2212 b1)X2 (b2 \u2212 a1)(b2 \u2212 a2)\n, 0, 0, 0 }\n(4.21)\nThe three zeroes in \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Vb1 and \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Vb2 make it seem like left and right endpoints are on an entirely different footing. If true, this would be embarrassing because deforming (a1, b1)\u222a (a2, b2) should be equivalent to deforming their complement on the X-axis, which\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nis also conformally equivalent to two intervals. Left endpoints of (a1, b1)\u222a (a2, b2) are right endpoints for the complement, and vice versa. We will see that this asymmetry is an artifact of working in X-space. In equation (2.16), interchanging left and right endpoints corresponds to X \u2192 \u2212X\u22121. When working with Y = \u22121/X, the arrays {A11, A12, A21, A22} take the analogous but distinct form, with the three zeros appearing in \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Va1 and \u03b2\u22121 \u25e6 Va2 instead. Both variations, however, take on a symmetric form when we work directly in z-space. We show this explicitly below.\n4.3 Two-interval modular parallel transport in z-space\nHere we inspect the variation of the modular Hamiltonian directly in z-space:\n\u2202\u03bbH mod = 2\u03c0i \u222b dz\u2202\u03bb [ hT (z;\u03bb)T (z) + \u2202\u03bbhC(z;\u03bb)\u03c8\u2020(z)\u03c8(z\u0303) + hC(z;\u03bb) \u2202z\u0303\n\u2202\u03bb \u03c8\u2020(z)\u2202\u0303\u03c8(z\u0303) ] (4.22)\nTo write the answer explicitly, we set up a few shorthands:\n\u2206(z) = (b1 + b2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 a2)z2 + 2(a1a2 \u2212 b1b2)z + (a1 + a2)b1b2 \u2212 (b1 + b2)a1a2 = (b1 + b2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 a2)(z \u2212 z+)(z \u2212 z\u2212) > 0 (4.23)\n\u03b3(z) = (b1 + b2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 a2)z + a1a2 \u2212 b1b2 (4.24) \u03a0a(z) = (a1 \u2212 z)(a2 \u2212 z) and \u03a0b(z) = (b1 \u2212 z)(b2 \u2212 z) (4.25)\nQuantity \u2206(z) vanishes when dX(z)/dz = 0, which happens at z\u00b1; see equation (2.23). Using this notation, as well as the \u03be defined in (2.24), varying a single endpoint gives:\n\u2202aiH mod = (4.26)\n= 2\u03c0i \u222b dz\n\u03a02b(z) \u22062(z) \u2212 \u03a02a(z)(ai\u2212z)2T (z)\u2212 \u03be\u03a0a(z)\u03a0b(ai)\u03b3(z) T\u0303 (z)+ \u03be(\u2206(z)\u22122\u03a0b(ai) \u03a0a(z)(ai\u2212z)) 2\u03a0b(ai)\u03b32(z) \u03c8\u2020(z)\u03c8(z\u0303)  \u2202biH mod = (4.27)\n= 2\u03c0i \u222b dz\n\u03a02a(z) \u22062(z)  \u03a02b(z) (bi\u2212z)2 T (z)\u2212 \u03be\u03a0b(z)\u03a0a(bi)\u03b3(z) T\u0303 (z)+ \u03be(\u2206(z)+2\u03a0a(bi) \u03a0b(z)(bi\u2212z)) 2\u03a0a(bi)\u03b32(z) \u03c8\u2020(z)\u03c8(z\u0303)  Substituting these expressions in [. . . , Hmod] shows that they are modular scrambling modes:[ \u2212 12\u03c0i\u2202aiH mod, Hmod ] = \u2202aiHmod and [ + 12\u03c0i\u2202biH mod, Hmod ] = \u2202biHmod (4.28)\nBy the same token, expressions (4.26)\u2013(4.27) also serve as generators of modular parallel transport, up to factors of \u00b1(2\u03c0i)\u22121. In summary, modular parallel transport in a general direction in kinematic space is given by:\nV (2-int) \u03bb = 1 2\u03c0i [ \u2212\u2202a1 \u2202\u03bb \u2202a1H mod + \u2202b1 \u2202\u03bb \u2202b1H mod \u2212 \u2202a2 \u2202\u03bb \u2202a2H mod + \u2202b2 \u2202\u03bb \u2202b2H mod ]\n(4.29)\nThese calculations confirm the conclusion, which we reached in X-space in equation (4.17). A straightforward calculation verifies that expression (4.29) equals (\u2202\u03bb\u03b2)\u03b2\u22121Hmod. This confirms the guess of equation (2.26) and the other points highlighted in section 4.1.\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7"

            "heading": "4.4 Relation to modular inclusion",
            "text": "Formula (4.29) is simple whereas explicit expressions like (4.26)\u2013(4.27) are quite involved. There must be a reason for the simplicity of the final answer, when it is expressed in terms of partial derivatives of Hmod. That reason is that the algebras of observables in regions (a1, b1 \u2212 db1) \u222a (a2, b2) and (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) form a half-sided modular inclusion [8, 9]. Consider two algebras of observables B \u2282 A, which act on the same Hilbert space H. Take a state |0\u3009 \u2208 H, which is (i) cyclic and (ii) separating in both A and B. These conditions mean that: (i) states of the form a|0\u3009, taken over a \u2208 B (the smaller of the two algebras), span the whole Hilbert space; and (ii) that a|0\u3009 is only zero if a = 0. Consider the modular flow\n\u03c3tA(\u00b7) = eitH mod A (\u00b7) e\u2212itHmodA , (4.30)\nwhere HmodA is the modular Hamiltonian in state |0\u3009 computed in the larger algebra A. If the subalgebra B is closed under this flow for all positive times, that is if\n\u03c3tA(B) \u2282 B \u2200 t \u2265 0, (4.31)\nthen B \u2282 A are said to form a half-sided modular inclusion [8, 9]. Whenever it occurs, the half-sided modular inclusion is a delicate circumstance: (4.31) concerns evolving B with the modular operator of the larger algebra A, which generically spills out of B into A. For our purposes, it is crucial that modular inclusion implies the following commutator relation between the modular Hamiltonians [10]:\n[HmodA \u2212HmodB , HmodB ] = 2\u03c0i(HmodA \u2212HmodB ) (4.32)\nApplied to planar and spherical regions in vacuum states of holographic conformal field theories, this relation explains the emergence of Poincar\u00e9 symmetry in the bulk AdS geometry [1, 10\u201312]. By essentially the same reasoning, it also explains formula (4.29).\nLet A be the algebra of observables on the double interval region (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) and B that on (a1, b1 \u2212 db1) \u222a (a2, b2). In that case, HmodA \u2212HmodB = \u2202b1Hmoddb1. We are working in the left-moving coordinate z = x \u2212 t so this setup satisfies B \u2282 A. If modular inclusion can be established for these algebras then equation (4.32) will become[ 1\n2\u03c0i \u2202b1H mod, Hmod\n] = \u2202b1Hmod (4.33)\nand (2\u03c0i)\u22121\u2202b1Hmod is the solution of the modular parallel transport problem (2.5)\u2013(2.6). In particular, as an eigen-operator of [. . . , Hmod], (2\u03c0i)\u22121\u2202b1Hmod is already zero mode-free.\nVerifying modular inclusion. Consider a fermion \u03c8(z) from the smaller region, that is (a1, b1\u2212 db1)\u222a (a2, b2). To establish modular inclusion, it suffices to show that the fermion remains there under modular flow (4.30) of the bigger region, for positive t. Here we use the fact that the isomorphism \u03b2 intertwines modular flows in z-space and X-space [14].\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nFigure 1. Equation (4.34), represented graphically.\nBy equation (2.15), \u03c3tA sends \u03c8(z) to: \u03c8(z) \u03b2\u22121(a1,b1)\u222a(a2,b2)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 #1\u03a81(X(z)) + #2\u03a82(X(z)) \u03c3t A\u22972(I)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 #\u20321\u03a81(e\u22122\u03c0tX(z)) + #\u20322\u03a82(e\u22122\u03c0tX(z)) (4.34) \u03b2(a1,b1)\u222a(a2,b2)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 #\u2032\u20321 \u03c8(z1(e\u22122\u03c0tX(z))) + #\u2032\u20322 \u03c8(z2(e\u22122\u03c0tX(z))) The steps are represented graphically in figure 1. Here X is defined for the bigger region (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) \u2014 precisely as in equation (2.16). The successive steps use equations (2.27), (2.19), and (2.20). We suppressed detailed coefficients, writing them schematically as #s.\nThe two inverses z1,2(X) \u2014 see equation (2.17) \u2014 map X \u2208 (0,\u221e) to z1(X) \u2208 (a1, b1) and z2(X) \u2208 (a2, b2), respectively. Therefore, the only thing to check is that\nz \u2208 (a1, b1 \u2212 db1) =\u21d2 z1(e\u22122\u03c0tX(z)) \u2208 (a1, b1 \u2212 db1) \u2200t \u2265 0 (4.35)\nThis follows because z1(X(z)) = z in this range and z1(X) is a monotonic function of X.\nOther terms. The above analysis referred to variations of double interval regions in one specific lightcone direction: b1, i.e. the left-moving coordinate of the right endpoint of the first interval. For b2 \u2014 the left-moving coordinate of the right endpoint of the second interval \u2014 the argument is identical. We now turn to variations in left endpoints, taking a2 for a start. Let A be the algebra of observables on the complement of (a1, b1)\u222a (a2, b2), and B be the algebra on the complement of (a1, b1)\u222a (a2\u2212da2, b2). By equation (2.1), working with complements sends Hmod \u2192 \u2212Hmod. If modular inclusion holds for B \u2282 A, we will therefore have:[\n\u2212 12\u03c0i \u2202a2H mod, Hmod\n] = \u2202a2Hmod (4.36)\nAs before, this means that \u2212(2\u03c0i)\u22121\u2202a2Hmod solves the modular parallel transport problem for variations in a2.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nTo verify modular inclusion for the complementary regions, we again inspect the modular flow. It follows structure (4.34) except now X gets dressed by a factor e2\u03c0t instead of e\u22122\u03c0t. Assume that the endpoints are properly ordered (a2 < b1) and that the inverses z1,2 are correctly indexed. (This means that z2(X(z)) = z for z \u2208 (b1, a2); the alternative would be z = z1(X(z)).) For the half-sided modular inclusion, we now need:\nz \u2208 (b1, a2 \u2212 da2) =\u21d2 z2(e2\u03c0tX(z)) \u2208 (b1, a2 \u2212 da2) \u2200t \u2265 0 (4.37)\nIn this range X(z) < 0 so the conclusion again follows from z2(X(z)) = z and from monotonicity of z2(X) in X. The argument for variations in a1 is the same except that it uses the other inverse z1(X). That inverse sends X \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0) to z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, a1) \u222a (b2,+\u221e) so it is not strictly speaking monotonous. This introduces some tediousness in the last step but does not affect the final conclusion. Finally, we briefly comment on the right-moving sector. There, the signs \u00b1(2\u03c0i) are reversed because boosts transformX \u2192 e\u22122\u03c0tX but X\u0304 \u2192 e2\u03c0tX\u0304. As a result, we find a halfsided modular inclusion for variations in the right-moving coordinates of left endpoints: a\u03041 and a\u03042. For variations in b\u03041 and b\u03042, we have a modular inclusion for complementary regions. The overall pattern in the right-movers is opposite to the left-movers, as is mandated by time reversal symmetry."

            "text": "In this section we consider a few special limits of our results. We present illustrative plots of the smearing functions for the local and non-local stress tensor term as well as the non-local current. Before doing so, we need a few preliminary comments. Deforming the two-interval region (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) is equivalent to deforming its complement (\u2212\u221e, a1) \u222a (b1, a2) \u222a (b2,\u221e). Because we are working in the vacuum of a conformal field theory, the latter is also conformally equivalent to a two-interval region. This appears to suggest that our results should be symmetric under the exchange of left endpoints a1 and a2 with right endpoints b1 and b2. As we shall see, this tentative conclusion is basically correct but subtle. This is best seen with reference to formula (4.26). The smearing functions of the nonlocal terms feature in their denominators the quantity \u03b3(z), which was defined in (4.24). When \u03b3(z) = 0, these smearing functions diverge. The divergence appears at\nz\u2217 = a1a2 \u2212 b1b2\na1 + a2 \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2 , (5.1)\nwhich is invariant when we swap the a\u2019s with the b\u2019s. Assuming the endpoint values are distinct and properly ordered (a1 < b1 < a2 < b2), we have z\u2217 \u2208 (b1, a2). This is easy to understand: the point z = z\u2217 is paired with infinity under the map (2.13): z\u0303(z\u2217) = \u221e. Because conformal transformations shift infinity around, the singularity in (4.29) has no invariant meaning. Consequently, comparing different instances of modular parallel transport requires special care. In particular, we should not expect the plots of smearing\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nfunctions to appear symmetric between (a1, b1) \u222a (a2, b2) and its complement. To account for this subtlety, each limit considered below will be implemented in two ways: with respect to I1 = (a1, b1) and with respect to the \u2018middle\u2019 interval (b1, a2), which contains z\u2217. In all plots, we display the generator Va1 and use blue, orange, green, red to represent successive stages in which a limit is approached."

As explained above, we have two ways to do that: (i) shrink one of I1 = (a1, b1) or I2 = (a2, b2) (say, b2 \u2192 a2), or (ii) shrink the interval between them (b1 \u2192 a2). For the first case, we will take I1 = (a1, b1) = (\u22121, 0) and consider a few shrinking choices of the second interval: starting with I2 = (a2, b2) = (10, 11), then letting b2 = 10.1, 10.01, 10.001. For the second case, we take a set-up symmetric about z = 0: we fix a1 = \u22125 and b2 = 5, then let \u2212b1 = a2 = 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001. In order to highlight features which are not determined by conformal kinematics, we arranged for these data points to have the same conformal cross-ratios\n\u03c7 = (a2 \u2212 a1)(b2 \u2212 b1)(a2 \u2212 b1)(b2 \u2212 a1) (5.2)\nThey take values 1+10\u22122, 1+10\u22123, 1+10\u22124 and 1+10\u22125 and the shrinking limit is \u03c7\u2192 1.\nLocal stress tensor. The smearing function for the local stress tensor does not have \u03b3(z) in its denominator. Therefore, it is divergence-free and we can safely plot it on the whole real line; see figure 2. Cases (i) and (ii) behave in the same way in that the smearing function approaches the single-interval answer: (a1, b1) in case (i) and (a1, b2) in case (ii). The convergence holds everywhere except the point z = a2 to which one interval shrinks, where the smearing function vanishes. The convergence is therefore point-wise, not uniform, which means that modular parallel transport \u2018remembers\u2019 about the second interval even when the latter shrinks to a point.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nAlgebraically, we can see this by noting that the T (z) smearing function for moving a1 must vanish at the remaining three interval endpoints: b1, a2, and b2. (In the one-interval case, the smearing function in V (1\u2212int)a vanishes at b and the smearing function in V (1\u2212int)b vanishes at a.) The vanishing at z = a2 is a feature, which distinguishes the two-interval answer (4.29) from the single-interval answer (4.2) even when the second interval vanishes. More geometrically, shifting a in the single interval case is generated by a dilation about z = b. But in the two-interval case, the T (z) smearing function for moving a1 is not quadratic, so it does not generate a global conformal transformation.\nNon-local stress tensor. The smearing functions for cases (i) and (ii) are shown in figure 3. They share several common features:\n\u2022 They vanish at all interval endpoints, including the endpoint a1, which is being shifted by Va1 . The zeroes at left endpoints z = a1, a2 are first order whereas the zeroes at right endpoints z = b1, b2 are second order.\n\u2022 The smearing function has local maxima inside I1 = (a1, b1) and I2 = (a2, b2).\n\u2022 The smearing function diverges at z\u2217 \u2208 (b1, a2).\n\u2022 Away from the divergence, the smearing function approaches zero point-wise in the shrinking limit.\nOne thing that distinguishes cases (i) and (ii) is the behavior of the peaks in intervals I1 and I2. The peak magnitudes of the smearing function tend to zero in case (i) (shrinking interval I2), but when the middle interval (b1, a2) shrinks (case (ii)) the peaks remain finite. The point-wise convergence to zero obtains because the peak locations approach the shrunk interval at z = a2. Same as in the smearing function for the local stress tensor, the presence of the singularity distinguishes the transport of the double-interval from the single interval case even if one of the constituent intervals shrinks to zero size. The fermions of the two intervals always remain coupled.\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nNon-local fermion current. The smearing functions are shown in figure 4.

            "heading": "5.3 Comparison with holography",
            "text": "One motivation for studying these special examples in the free fermion is a comparison with holographic theories. There, in the limit of large central charge, modular parallel transport can be holographically interpreted as a bulk diffeomorphism, which maps the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces to one another [1]. While modular parallel transport in the free fermion theory has no such interpretation, it is useful as a computable, small central charge counterpoint to holographic examples. In holography, two-interval regions can be categorized into two classes: the connected phase and the disconnected phase. This refers to whether their entanglement wedges in the bulk are connected or disconnected. The transition, which happens when (a2 \u2212 b2)(a1\u2212 b1) = (a2\u2212 b1)(a1\u2212 b2), is sharp at infinite N but smoothed out by enhanced 1/N corrections [22]. Away from the transition point, modular parallel transport in holographic theories decouples, from the bulk point of view, into two separate single-interval problems. This is because the relevant Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces are pairs of distant geodesics, each of which is independently deformed under bulk modular transport. Of course, the modular parallel transport of double intervals in the free fermion theory does not decompose in this way. On the other hand, the modular parallel transport of single intervals is the same in all 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories, holographic or otherwise, because it is fixed by conformal symmetry. For this reason, we have been interested in limits in which modular parallel transport of double intervals might reduce to that of single intervals. The extent to which this does not happen is a signature of the non-holographic character of the free fermion.\nIn the end, we found the following:\n\u2022 The only limit in which the modular parallel transport of double intervals reduces to that of a single interval is when two neighboring intervals \u2014 say, I2 and the middle interval (b1, a2) \u2014 are simultaneously shrunk to zero size. This is a trivial case, in the sense that it literally reduces the problem to one interval and a complement.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\n\u2022 In all other cases, modular parallel transport of I1 \u222a I2 is qualitatively distinct from the modular parallel transport of I1 alone. For example, when one interval is shrunk non-local terms continue to couple the vestigial point-like interval to its partner.\n\u2022 If we focus on the local stress tensor term alone, we see that it does approach the single-interval form, albeit with subtleties. When intervals I1,2 are taken far apart, it approaches both single-interval answers (for I1 and for I1 \u222a (b1, a2) \u222a I2), but at different scales."

            "heading": "6 Curvature",
            "text": "This section computes the curvature of the connection, which defines modular parallel transport. As usual, the curvature two-form is given by the commutator of two parallel transport generators understood as operator-valued one-forms:\nK\u03bb\u03c3d\u03bbd\u03c3 = [V\u03bbd\u03bb, V\u03c3d\u03c3] (6.1)\nIn equation (4.29), we found that in the free fermion theory modular transport in the direction of shifting a single endpoint is given by \u00b1\u2202Hmod. Therefore, if we take \u03bb and \u03c3 in equation (6.1) to denote z-space locations of interval endpoints, we will find:\nK\u03bb\u03c3 = P 0[\u00b1\u22022\u03bb\u03c3Hmod] (where \u03bb, \u03c3 denote interval endpoint locations) (6.2)\nHere P 0 is the projector onto zero-modes of Hmod. To explain the projector, we remind the reader that the gauge symmetry which underlies modular parallel transport comprises zero modes of Hmod. The curvature of a gauge bundle is of course valued in its gauge group.\nThe commutator in equation (6.2) is straightfoward to compute directly in z-space, but the result takes a rather messy form, which is difficult to interpret. The calculations are simpler to conduct and present in X-space. A priori, six different commutators need to be computed. However, the zero mode projector in (6.2) sets Ka1a2 = Kb1b2 = 0. This is because Va1 and Va2 (respectively Vb1 , Vb2) are both scrambling modes of modular frequency \u22122\u03c0i (resp. +2\u03c0i), so their commutator is a modular mode of frequency \u22124\u03c0i (resp. +4\u03c0i). The projector in (6.2) annihilates it.\nWe are left with four non-vanishing components of the curvature two-form.

The appearance of Q(1)22 in terms involving b1 and of Q (1) 11 in terms involving b2 may seem counterintuitive. This apparent asymmetry between left and right endpoints is an artefact of working in the X coordinate, which itself treats the ai\u2019s and bj \u2019s differently. We have verified that the relevant expressions in z-space favor neither left nor right endpoints.\nComparison with other setups. Note how answers (6.4)\u2013(6.7) differ from the curvature of the modular parallel transport of a single interval, which is shared with holographic theories. There, the only zero modes present in the curvature are the modular Hamiltonian itself and the bulk translational mode, which is responsible for computing lengths of curves in the differential entropy formula [3, 23]. In the present case, the answer crucially involves non-local zero modes Q(\u00b7)12 and Q (\u00b7) 21 , which couple fermions in distinct intervals. Among them, we encounter a qualitatively novel zero mode Q(2)21 , which is neither stress tensor-like nor a current. It is also useful to contrast (6.4)\u2013(6.7) with the holographic computation. At leading order in 1/N , modular parallel transport describes deformations of RT surfaces. For twointerval regions in holographic CFT2s, those surfaces can be in one of two phases: (i) one geodesic connecting a1 with b1 and another connecting a2 with b2, or (ii) the other way around \u2014 a1 with b2 and a2 with b1. Deformations of distinct geodesics commute, so non-vanishing curvature (at leading order in 1/N) arises only for pairs that are connected by a geodesic in the given phase. The values of those non-vanishing curvature components are the same as in the single-interval case \u2014 because they describe the same deformations of a single geodesic. The single-geodesic curvatures were computed in [1]. Borrowing those results, we find in phase (i) of a holographic CFT2:\n[Va1 , Vb1 ] \u223c \u2212 2 (a1 \u2212 b1)2 \u222b dz (b1 \u2212 z)(z \u2212 a1) b1 \u2212 a1 T (z)\n[Va1 , Vb2 ] \u223c 0 \u223c [Va2 , Vb1 ] (6.8) [Va2 , Vb2 ] \u223c \u2212 2 (a2 \u2212 b2)2 \u222b dz (b2 \u2212 z)(z \u2212 a2) b2 \u2212 a2 T (z)\nSymbols \u223c remind us that this result is subject to 1/N corrections. Expressions (6.8) are of course given in z-space because there is no X-space for a holographic CFT2. Despite that, we may think of them as loosely analogous to terms Q(1)11\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nand Q(2)22 in result (6.4)\u2013(6.7). It is interesting to observe that terms, which in holographic theories populate two out of four curvature components, are distributed evenly among all four curvature components in the free fermion theory. This comparison can be interpreted as an imperfect toy model of 1/N corrections in holographic modular parallel transport."

            "text": "We computed modular parallel transport in settings, which are novel in two aspects. To begin, ours is the first example of modular parallel transport of a disjoint region. It is also the first time where modular parallel transport is computable but not determined by holographic considerations.1 The two novelties are interrelated: in holographic theories parallel transport of disjoint regions boils down to parallel-transporting their individual components; we were interested in the extent to which this holographic simplification fails in the free fermion. We found that non-local terms in modular parallel transport couple distinct components of a region for as long as it or its complement remain disconnected. The only limit in which modular parallel transport of two intervals I1\u222aI2 reduces to a local form is one where not only does I2 shrink to zero length, but also the interval between I1 and I2 shrinks to zero \u2014 that is, when the problem literally boils down to the transport of a single interval. In particular, when I2 was shrunk to zero size but maintained a finite distance from I1, terms coupling the now point-like I2 to I1 continued to be important. In summary, the modular parallel transport of multiple intervals in the 1+1-dimensional free fermion theory is non-local whenever the kinematics allow it.\nA broader perspective. We would like to situate this finding in a broader context. In refs. [24, 25], the free fermion in 1+1 dimensions was found to be the unique conformal field theory whose mutual information in the vacuum is extensive I(A : BC) = I(A : B) + I(A : C). This implies that, at the level of von Neumann entropies, the quantum entanglement in the 1+1-d free fermion vacuum is indistinguishable from that of a collection of EPR pairs [26]. Ref. [25] also gives an explicit formula for the mutual information of two arbitrary regions I(A : B) in terms of conserved currents; this formula can consequently be interpreted as a density of entangled pairs. It would be interesting to understand the form of modular parallel transport in this language. Perhaps formulas (4.26)\u2013(4.27) can be viewed as densities of entangled partners, which enter or leave a CFT region undergoing a deformation. Our method of calculation exploited the mapping between two intervals in the theory of one fermion and the half-line in a theory of two fermions. This mapping was key for computing the modular Hamiltonian, which was the starting point of our analysis. After that, the crisp form of modular parallel transport found in (4.29) was a consequence of the half-sided modular inclusion [8, 9]. The relation between these facts and the extensivity of mutual information is not obvious. We hope to illuminate the link between these concepts in future work.\n1The modular parallel transport of single intervals in all 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories is universal. Therefore, it is computable in non-holographic theories, but it takes a form which exactly mirrors that found in holographic theories.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 4 7\nMultiple intervals. We have not attempted to compute explicit z-space or X-space expressions of modular parallel transport generators or curvature two-form for (n > 2)- interval regions. They are unilluminating. Instead, we note that the obvious generalization of formula (4.29) applies:\nV (n-int) \u03bb = 1 2\u03c0i n\u2211 i=1 [ \u2212\u2202ai \u2202\u03bb \u2202aiH mod + \u2202bi \u2202\u03bb \u2202biH mod ]\n(7.1)\nThis is because the relevant isomorphisms \u03b2n (see equation (2.14)) again imply that regions differing by \u00b1dai or \u00b1dbi form half-sided modular inclusions. The non-localities, which we discussed in sections 5 and 6, will be qualitatively similar, that is bipartite. The ultimate reason for this appears to be the bipartite-like nature of the quantum entanglement in the free fermion vacuum [24].\nComparison with the free boson. Another theory, for which vacuum modular Hamiltonians of multiple intervals are known, is the free boson in 1+1 dimensions [5]. Can we compute modular parallel transport there? This would be a difficult task.\nA schematic form of the two-interval modular Hamiltonian is: Hmod = \u222b I1\u222aI2 dz \u222b I1\u222aI2 dwN(z, w) \u2202\u03c6\u2020(z) \u2202\u03c6(w) (7.2)\nNote that the coupling is not bipartite: the current \u2202\u03c6\u2020(z) couples to currents all over both intervals. This non-locality is much more severe than in the free fermion. One way to understand it is that it reflects a GHZ-like character of quantum entanglement [24] in the free boson theory. Indeed, References [24, 27] found that the entropy of a region R in the 1+1-d massive free boson develops a term, which is independent of the number of connected components of R \u2014 a hallmark of GHZ-like entanglement. This term diverges in the massless limit. The greater degree of non-locality in (7.2) appears to preclude the possibility of a modular inclusion. Without it, the only option for computing modular parallel transport is a direct calculation: (i) pick out zero modes from \u2202Hmod, (ii) solve equation (2.5), then (iii) pick out zero modes again from the solution as demanded by (2.6). The complicated nature of Hamiltonian (7.2) makes every step of this calculation quite intractable. The free fermion appears to be the unique theory, in which modular parallel transport of a disjoint region can be computed and understood."
