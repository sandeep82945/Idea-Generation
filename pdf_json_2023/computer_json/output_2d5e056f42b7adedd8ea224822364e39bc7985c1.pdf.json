Breast and lung cancers are the two tumors with the highest incidence rates. Te study shows that early detection and early diagnosis are important prognostic factors for breast and lung cancers. Due to the great advantages of artifcial intelligence in feature extraction, the combination of infrared analysis technology may have great potential in clinical applications.

We use k-fold cross-validation to determine the training set of 301 cases and the test set of 50 cases. Trough diferential spectrum analysis, we found that the intervals of 1318.59\u20131401.03 cm\u22121, 1492.15\u20131583.27 cm\u22121, and 1597.25\u20131721.64 cm\u22121 have signifcant diferences, which may refect the absorption of key chemical bonds in protein molecules. We use a total of 24 models such as decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and K-nearest neighbor to train, identify, and distinguish spectra. Te results show that under the same conditions, the prediction model trained based on fne KNN has the best performance and can perform 100% prediction on the test set samples. Tis also shows that our model has important potential for auxiliary diagnosis of serum breast cancer and lung cancer. Tis method may help to further achieve comprehensive screening of associated cancers in underserved areas, thereby reducing the cancer burden through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care of cancer patients."

Cancer is currently the leading cause of death in the country and an important barrier to extending the average life expectancy in the country.Worldwide, there are an estimated 19.3million new\nHindawi International Journal of Intelligent Systems Volume 2023, Article ID 4533108, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/4533108\ncancer cases and nearly 10 million cancer deaths, based on GLOBOCAN 2020 cancer incidence and mortality estimates compiled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Overall, the burden of cancer incidence and mortality is rapidly increasingworldwide. Scholars predict that by 2040, there will be an estimated 28.4 million new cancer cases worldwide, an increase of 47% from 19.3 million in 2020 [2].\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Breast cancer is a disease in which breast epithelial cells proliferate uncontrollably under the action of various carcinogenic factors. Breast cancer accounts for 11.7% of new cases, and its burden has been rising over the past few decades. Now, breast cancer has replaced lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide [3]. Breast cancer accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases in women, is by far the most common cancer in women in 2020, and its burden is increasing in many parts of the world [4]. Te number of newly diagnosed breast cancers is expected to grow by more than 40% by 2040, to about 3 million cases per year. At the same time, the number of breast cancer deaths will increase from 685,000 in 2020 to 1 million in 2040, an increase of more than 50% [5]. Lung cancer, which used to rank frst today, still poses a serious burden to global health. Lung cancer is a malignant tumor originating from the bronchial mucosa or glands of the lung, accounting for 11.4% of new cases. Lung cancer is now the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2020. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men after prostate cancer and has the highest morbidity and mortality [6, 7].\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of diagnosed breast cancer patients (7.8 million) is much higher than the number of breast cancer deaths (685,000) [2]. Tese data are smaller than that of other types of cancer, suggesting that breast cancer outcomes can be improved. Te key lies in the accurate and timely detection of diseases. Lung cancer, on the other hand, is mostly found incidentally during radiology tests performed in the presence of other symptoms. Te disease usually occurs at an advanced stage when it is detected. Te treatment of lung cancer is mainly to fnd and remove the tumor through surgery, supplemented by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Scholars estimate that the fve-year survival rate of lung cancer is 70% in the clinical stage [8]. In general, breast cancer and lung cancer are the two tumor types with the largest global health burden. Timely detection and treatment are of great signifcance for alleviating the status quo of these two diseases. However, most diagnoses of such diseases rely on radiological examination, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tissue biopsy. (Tese methods are considered the gold standard) [9]. Tere is an inevitable problem: due to the constraints of cost and expertise, these technologies are not available in rural and remote areas for the detection of these cancers. Terefore, alternative or auxiliary diagnostic techniques that are quick to detect, easy to operate, low cost, and conducive to universal screening must have important clinical needs.\nTere are issues related to slow reporting of results and delays in patient care due to existing medical workfows. As a result, patient treatment and prognosis are afected, which will bring potential fnancial burden to medical institutions.\nIn developed countries, the number of people over the age of 65 is expected to increase by 71% by 2050, and the aging population and increasing burden of chronic diseases require higher diagnostic capabilities to diagnose and stratify patients [10]. Tis will increase the pressure and burden on the existing medical platform. Te development of novel, low cost, and rapid diagnostic platforms is the key to breaking through the current dilemma of diagnosis and treatment. Te development of novel, low cost, and rapid diagnostic platforms is the key to breaking through the current dilemma of diagnosis and treatment. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) has been used for a long time to characterize compounds, but its suitability in analyzing biological materials with highly complex chemical compositions is debatable. Nevertheless, the latest advancements in infrared spectroscopy have signifcantly improved its ability to analyze various types of biological specimens. As a result, more and more research is exploring the use of IR spectroscopy in the screening and diagnosis of various diseases [11\u201313]. In recent two years, Atiqah et al. developed a fast, noninvasive detection method for early diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) by analyzing blood serum samples from 15 OA patients and 10 healthy volunteers with no clinical symptoms of the disease. With support from chemical quantifcation methods, discriminant analysis was used to distinguish between the OA and healthy groups, yielding an overall classifcation accuracy of 74.47% [14]. As research progresses, the detection limit of infrared spectroscopy has also been increased, with some small molecular metabolic components such as amino acids being detectable by infrared spectroscopy. Tulya et al. improved the detection limit of low molecular weight amino acids by using glycine as a model analyte combined with mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared spectroscopy data, with a linear regression coefcient of determination R2 reaching 0.997. Tis study successfully expanded the application limits of infrared spectroscopy technology [15].Te potential of using biological specimen analysis as a diagnostic tool for cancer has been recognized for a long time [16]. Ma et al. used infrared spectroscopy to collect serum sample data from patients with cervical cancer, CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, and uterine fbroids and compared various deep learningmodels. Te results showed that PSO\u2013CNN was the best and the discrimination accuracy for the fve sample types could reach 87.2% [17]. Wang et al. collected SERS data from 729 patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in their serum and established an artifcial intelligence-assisted diagnostic model based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Te accuracy of prostate cancer was 85.14\u00b1 0.39%. After adjusting the model based on patient age and prostate-specifc antigen (PSA), the accuracy of the multimodal CNN could reach 88.55\u00b1 0.66% [18]. In recent research, Alexandra et al. investigated the application of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy on serum and used machine learning algorithms to diferentiate between cancer (n= 92) and healthy controls (n= 88), with a sensitivity of 100% and specifcity of 100%. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 [19]. Tere has been a recent trend in the use\nof serum infrared spectroscopy in clinical research, with artifcial intelligence algorithms gradually replacing traditional, simpler chemical quantifcation methods to achieve better performing recognition models. Te sensitivity of IR spectroscopy to chemical changes during the transition from normal to pathological states or during treatment can lead to the identifcation of novel biological markers associated with disease. As a result, IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool with enormous potential for clinical applications, extending beyond cancer screening, diagnosis, and prognosis to continuous monitoring of treatment responses and disease progression or regression in personalized medicine [20].\nIR is the ability of molecules to selectively absorb infrared rays of certain wavelengths.Te result of detecting the absorption of infrared rays is the infrared absorption spectrum of the corresponding substance. Te main principle is that in organic molecules, the atoms that make up chemical bonds or functional groups are in a state of constant vibration, and its vibration frequency is equivalent to that of infrared light. When a beam of infrared light with a continuous wavelength passes through a substance, and the vibration frequency or rotation frequency of a certain group in the substance molecule is the same as the frequency of the infrared light, the molecule absorbs energy and transitions from the original ground state vibration (rotation) kinetic energy level to energy higher vibration (rotation) kinetic energy level. Molecules undergo vibration and rotational energy level transitions after absorbing infrared radiation, and the light at this wavelength is absorbed by the substance [21]. Te infrared spectrum is obtained by recording the absorption of infrared light by the molecule with an instrument. Based on the above principles, various materials or biological samples can be identifed through the unique energy states of specifc functional groups. For the detection of vibrational energy states, infrared light can be used, such as near-infrared or mid-infrared light. Since the midinfrared light can resonate with the fundamental frequency vibration, stronger spectral absorption intensity and more identifcation features can be obtained. Mid-infrared radiation is usually defned as electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 2.5\u201325 \u03bcm or a frequency of 400\u20134000 cm\u22121 (the unit is the wave number, and the product of the constant speed of light is the frequency, the unit is Hz) [22]. Fat, amino acid, protein, sugar, heme, enzyme, hormone, etc. are all organic compounds in living organisms. Te key covalent bonds of these compounds are N-H, O-H, C-H, CC, C-O, C-N, C\u2261C, C\u2261N, C\ufffdC, C\ufffdO, C\ufffdN. Te typical infrared absorption of chemical bonds is located at 600\u20134000 cm\u22121, and both fall in the mid-infrared range. Based on the above analysis, the application of mid-infrared spectroscopy to the analysis of clinical biological samples may have important potential.\nTe essence of the infrared spectrum of a substance is that when infrared light with a continuous wavelength passes through a substance, the molecular components of the substance absorb infrared radiation under certain conditions. Te spectrogram obtained by recording the absorption of infrared light by a molecule with an instrument is the infrared spectrum of the corresponding\nsubstance. Te analysis of infrared spectroscopy has traditionally relied on the analysis of professional chemometric software. With the rise of infrared spectroscopy in the medical feld, the clinical situation is more complicated, such as the diferences between biological samples, and the specifc course of the disease of individual patients is also diferent [23]. Tese problems make infrared-related research still need to solve many problems, such as infrared data processing requires stronger computing power, and also need to be \u201csmart\u201d to realize our data processing needs. Tis has caused the traditional chemometrics software to be difcult to meet our needs. Te essence of each piece of infrared spectral data is a collection of thousands of wave points. Each wave point is a set of data (wavenumber + absorbance). In other words, each infrared spectrum is a data set consisting of thousands of data. Artifcial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science aimed at creating computer systems that can think, learn, reason, and make decisions independently. Te goal is to simulate various aspects of human intelligence, enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human thought, intellect, knowledge, or skills. AI is a broad feld that encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, image recognition, and intelligent robots, among others [24]. Machine learning, a subfeld of AI, focuses on allowing computers to automatically generate models through the study of large amounts of data, in order to recognize and predict patterns in the data [25]. Tis aligns with our requirements for analyzing infrared spectroscopy data, and the application of machine learning to the analysis and processing of such complex data may yield satisfactory results [24]. We have previously used similar approaches to solve some clinical problems and obtained satisfactory results [26]. Tis study builds and develops new methods for assisting in the diagnosis of breast and lung cancers based on decision trees, discriminant analysis, Bayesian classifcation, support vector machines, and K-nearest neighbors in machine learning. It aims to quickly identify and distinguish breast and lung cancers in the population."

Tey come from 98 cases of breast cancer patients diagnosed by clinicians admitted to the Afliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University. Te age of the patients ranged from 24 to 81 years old, with an average age of (50.86\u00b112.04) years old. Among these patients, there were 93 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, 1 case of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with intraductal carcinoma, 1 case of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with ductal carcinoma in situ, 1 case of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with eczema-like carcinoma, and 1 case of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with eczema-like carcinoma. Two cases of sex cordstromal tumors concurrently with fbroadenomas were observed. Another part of the samples came from 95 patients diagnosed with lung cancer who were diagnosed by clinicians in the Afliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University. Te age\nof the patients ranged from 31 to 83years old, with an average age of (57.18\u00b19.81) years old including 51 cases of adenocarcinoma (ACC), 28 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 7 cases of large cell carcinoma (LCC), and 9 cases of small cell lung cancer. In addition, 158 serum samples were collected from healthy people in the Afliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University in June 2021, aged 26\u201374years, with an average age of (47.75\u00b110.49) years. Tis study was approved by the Human ResearchEthicsCommittee of theAfliatedHospital ofGuizhou Medical University.\n2.2. InstrumentandSoftware. Tis study utilized theTermo Scientifc Nicolet iS5 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with accompanying iD1 smart transmission accessory and iD5 attenuated total refectance accessory (Termo Fisher Scientifc, Waltham, MA, USA). Software analysis was conducted using the TQ Analyst 9 and OMNIC 8.2 (Termo Fisher Scientifc, Waltham, MA, USA), as well as MATLAB2019 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).\n2.3. Sample Collection and Processing. Te blood is collected by the clinical nurse, and the fast serum tube is selected for temporary storage and transferred to the laboratory at 4\u00b0 cold chain. After confrming that there is no hemolysis, after confrming the receipt, let it stand at room temperature for 30minutes. Centrifuge at 3500 r/min for 5minutes to separate the serum and store at \u221280\u00b0.\n2.4.WorkFlowEstablishmentandSerumSpectrumCollection. Open Omnic software (Omnic 8.2, Termo Nicolet Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) creates a new workfow and sets experimental parameters. Te number of scans set in \u201cNumber of scans\u201d is 16. In the \u201cResolution\u201d option, ensure that the resolution of the collected spectra is 4 cm\u22121. In the \u201cData Format\u201d option, confrm that Absorbance is the data format of the spectrum. Te data interval is 0.482. Te range of scanning wavenumber is 4000\u223c400 cm\u22121.Te detector is DTGS/KBr, and the beam splitter is KBr. We remove the samples in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer. Considering that room temperature and relative humidity may afect serum status, we controlled the room temperature at 24\u00b0C and 44%humidity.We equilibrated the samples for 2hours in this environment. Ten, turn on the instrument (Termo Scientifc Nicolet iS5, USA) to preheat for 0.5h. Prior to testing, we cleaned the instrument sample pool and performed air zeroing.We then injected 5\u03bcL of the sample into the sample pool using a sampling gun. To eliminate the infuence of background substances such as water, a solvent blank was independently prepared [27]. Spectra were collected according to the set parameters, and spectral data within the range of 550\u22121800 cm\u22121 were retained for subsequent analysis. Te background spectrum was collected as shown in Figure S1-A, and the collected sample spectrum (S1-B) was subtracted from the background spectrum to obtain the fnal sample spectrum, as shown in Figure S1-C. To efectively avoid errors caused by instrument instability, each spectrum was normalized uniformly, as shown in Figure S1-D."

            "text": "2.6.1. Classifcation of Training and Test Sets. Te key to the study is the normal division of the dataset. Te classifcation in this study follows the following principles: the training set should be mutually exclusive with the test set as much as possible, and the distribution of training and test data should be consistent. Combined with the characteristics of the sample data itself, we choose k-fold cross validation, and the specifc steps are as follows:\nStep 1: Divide the data set into training set and test set completely randomly. Set aside the test set as validation data for the trained model. Step 2: Randomly divide the training set into K mutually exclusive subsets of similar size. Step 3: Each time use 1 of the k copies as the verifcation set, and all the others as the training set. Step 4: After k training and validation, we get k diferent models. Step 5: Evaluate the efects of k models, select the hyperparameters with the best efect, and take the average of k verifcation results as an index to measure the accuracy of the model. Step 6: Use the optimal hyperparameters, and then use all k data sets as the training set to retrain the model, and output the fnal model.\n2.6.2. Decision Tree. Te decision tree regards a spectrum with n wave points as a point in n-dimensional space. Te process of classifcation is to fnd a hyperplane in n-dimensional space or higher dimensional space and divide these spectra. Decision trees are supervised learning. Based on the known classifcation results, a prediction model is obtained by learning the training set samples, performing feature selection, generating a decision tree, and pruning the decision tree. Tis decision tree is able to give the correct classifcation for new spectral data. Decision trees are a common machine learning algorithm.\n2.6.3. Discriminatory Analysis. Discriminant analysis is used to fnd which category is most similar to the unknown category spectrum among the known categories. Te analysis process is to establish a discriminant function by estimating the change of the number of each wave point in the analysis area with a batch of spectral samples that have been\nclearly classifed, so as to minimize the misjudgment of the spectrum. On this basis, a given new spectral sample is discriminated.\n2.6.4. Bayesian Classifcation. Bayesian classifcation is a statistical classifcation method. Its formula is P (Ai|B)\ufffd P (Ai)\u2217P (B|Ai)/nj\ufffd1P(Aj)P(B/Aj), where P (Ai|B) is the posterior probability distribution, and P (Ai) is the prior probability distribution. Te prediction process is based on the frst training to build a classifer on the spectral data. Predict the probability that a spectrum belongs to a certain class by solving the posterior probability distribution.\n2.6.5. Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a class of supervised learning. Te basic idea of learning is to solve the separating hyperplane that can correctly divide the training data set and maximize the geometric interval. Based on this, binary classifcation is performed on the data. Its learning strategy is to maximize the interval between diferent categories of spectra, which can be formalized as an optimization algorithm for solving convex quadratic programming.\n2.6.6. k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Te idea of KNN is that in the feature space, if most of the k-nearest samples near a sample belong to a certain category, the sample also belongs to this category. Te implementation process is that in a training spectral data set, input unknown spectral data, and fnd the K samples closest to the spectrum in the training data set. Most of these K samples belong to a certain class, and the input instance is classifed into this class.\n2.7. Metrics for Evaluation. After the quantitative model is established, its performance needs to be evaluated. Te main inspection indicators are accuracy, errorrate, macro precision (macro-P), macro recall (macro-R), harmonic mean (F1), and predictive recall (R). Te main calculation formula is as follows:\nP \u2212 Accuracy(%) \ufffd \nn i\ufffd1TPi\n n i\ufffd1TPi + FPi\n,\nP \u2212 Errorrate(%) \ufffd \nn i\ufffd1FPi\n n i\ufffd1TPi + FPi\n\u00d7 100,\nmacro \u2212 P \ufffd 1 n \u2217 \nn\ni\ufffd1\nTPi\nTPi + FPi ,\nRi \ufffd TPi\nTPi + FNi ,\nmacro \u2212 R \ufffd 1 n \u2217 \nn\ni\ufffd1 Ri,\nF1 \ufffd 2 \u00d7 macro \u2212 P \u00d7 macro \u2212 R macro \u2212 P + macro \u2212 R .\n(1)\nNote: TPi (True Positive): the true classifcation i is correctly predicted as classifcation i; FPi (False Positive): the wrong prediction of other true classifcations is classifcation i; FNi (False Negative): the true classifcation i is incorrectly predicted as other Classifcation.

            "text": "3.1. Sample Conditions and Basic Characteristics of MidInfrared Spectra. All collected samples were assayed by mid-infrared spectroscopy as described in Materials Method 4. A total of 351 spectral samples were analyzed for this analysis. According to the sample source, the samples were divided into normal control group, breast cancer group, and lung cancer group. We randomly split the collected spectra into a training set (301) and a test set (50). Please refer to Table 1 for details such as grouping situation and gender ratio. Tere was no gender diference between the training set and the prediction set (X2 \ufffd 0.567, P \ufffd 0.451, P> 0.05). Tere was no age diference between the training set and the prediction set (t\ufffd 0.91, P \ufffd 0.927, P> 0.05). Trough statistical analysis, the results of random grouping can be used in subsequent experiments. Te quality of a model depends on objective evaluation criteria. Existing standards are basically applicable to a single assessment, which leads to the randomness of the assessment. We need to increase the number of training times to solve the contingency problem. Training a model repeatedly on the same dataset does not solve this problem. Terefore, the preferred method is to divide the data set diferently, train multiple models, and evaluate comprehensively. Te common division methods are as follows: holdout cross validation, leave one out cross validation, and k-fold cross validation. Holdout cross validation is to statically divide the data set into training set, verifcation set, and test set. Te model corresponding to the test set may have a large gap compared with the trained model, the fdelity is low, and there is no better solution.Tis method is suitable for a large number of samples (ten thousand, million). Leave one out cross validation is to divide the training set one by one. Each validation set has only one sample, and m times of training and prediction are required. Tis will increase the complexity of training and increase the computational cost. Tis method is generally used when the data set is scarce. Static holdout cross validation is sensitive to data division. k-fold cross validation is a dynamic validation method [28]. Tis method is not affected by the random sample division method, and the trained model is very similar to the overall data set model, which is an ideal division scheme for small data sets. In summary, combined with the characteristics of the sample data itself, we choose k-fold cross validation (K\ufffd 5). Te specifc process is shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 is the original mid-infrared spectrum of the collected samples. Te overall spectrum is uniform and consistent, which can better refect the physical and chemical properties of serum. Each\nspectrum consists of 2595 wave points; that is, each spectrum has 2595 features.\n3.2.Diference SpectralAnalysis. Based on the collected midinfrared spectra, the training set spectra were divided into 131 normal control spectra, 85 breast cancer spectra, and 85 lung cancer spectra according to the sample source. Convert the fnal IR spectra to 2595 wave point data using themethod described in Materials Methods 5. In order to eliminate the\ninherent errors in instrument measurement and analyze the spectra better, we frst normalized each spectrum to obtain three sets of new data. After that, we calculated the average value of the 2595 wave point data that constitute the spectrum in the same group one by one. Finally, we reconstructed the obtained average result into an average spectrum, and the result is shown in Figure 3(a). In organic components, when the vibration frequency or rotation frequency of atoms constituting chemical bonds or functional groups is the same as that of infrared light, molecules\nTable 1: Sample information and its grouping situation.\nNumber Male/female Normal group (N) Breast cancer (B) Lung cancer (L) Age (Mean\u00b1 SD) CV Training dataset 301 146/205 131 85 85 51.19\u00b1 11.51 0.22 Test dataset 50 18/32 27 13 10 51.04\u00b1 10.95 0.21\nRandomly divide the dataset\nTraining dataset\nRandomly divide the data into k parts\nThe remainingk-1 parts as training dataset\n1 parts as validation dataset\nAfter k training get k models\nEvaluate K models to get the optimal parameters\nUse the entire training set to train and output the final model under the optimal parameters\nTest dataset to do the final evaluation of the model"

Based on the above principles, theoretically specifc functional groups or biochemical components have corresponding absorption in the frequency range of specifc infrared light (S2).We subtracted the mean spectra of each group pairwise to obtain their absolute values and reconstructed them into three diference spectra. Tey are normal control-breast cancer (\u2223N-B\u2223), normal control-lung cancer (\u2223N-L\u2223), and breast cancer-lung cancer (\u2223B-L\u2223), and the diference spectrum is shown in Figure 3(b). Te spectral intervals with large diferences between diferent average spectra are marked, and the detailed results are shown in Table 2. Te spectral diferences between breast cancer and normal population were mainly concentrated in the ranges of 1492.15\u20131583.27 cm\u22121 and 1597.25\u20131721.64 cm\u22121. Tis region is mainly the spectral region of C\ufffdC, C\ufffdO, C\ufffdN, N-H, and O-H absorptions. Tis result may be related to the absorption of the amide structure of the protein with the \u03b1-helical structure. It refects the diference in protein content and its secondary structure, which is consistent with the fndings of Zelig and Yang [29, 30]. Te spectral diference between lung cancer and normal people not only refects the amide I region (1398.62\u20131543.74 cm\u22121) [31\u201333] corresponding to protein absorption but also refects the phosphate group region of RNA and DNA (1172.99\u20131319.55 cm\u22121). Spectral diferences between breast and lung cancers were also signifcant in the range 1318.59\u20131515.77 cm\u22121, a region containing the absorption of key structures of lipids and phospholipids [30, 34]. In general, the spectra of the diferent populations are signifcantly diferent or can be efectively distinguished. Tis suggests that spectroscopy has the potential for important clinical applications. From a clinical perspective,\nmodern clinical practice requires a simple, fast, and accurate auxiliary diagnostic method. Te sample drying process is cumbersome and does not meet the practical needs of clinical practice. Related research reports in the past year have also shown that satisfactory results can be obtained from serum samples [15, 17\u201319]. It should be noted that although biochemical components require relatively high concentrations to prevent their biochemical characteristics from being masked, this study\u2019s results show that the differences between spectra are mainly concentrated in the wavenumber range (1700 cm\u22121\u223c1500 cm\u22121) that refects key protein structures. Tis means that distinguishing diferent categories based on spectra may still depend on diferences in protein abundance. Tis result also coincides with the marked diferences in protein content between cancer patients and the normal population in clinical practice. At the same time, this is consistent with similar studies in the same category [29, 30, 32, 33]. Tis further demonstrates the important clinical application potential of spectroscopy.\n3.3. Model Results and Partial Model Performance Verifcation. On the basis of diferential spectrum analysis, diferent classifcation models are used for training in combination with the characteristics of diferent groups of spectra. For the complex spectral data composed of 2595 wave points, it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Tis study uses the commonly used PCA dimensionality reduction. Since the feature score after dimensionality reduction is determined by the principal component score after dimensionality reduction, this will directly afect the model training efect. Terefore, the determination of the principal components is an important\nparameter for model establishment. In our research, we mainly use models including decision trees, discriminant analysis, SVM, kNN, and related subalgorithms, a total of 24 models. Diferent algorithm models and diferent principal component numbers are selected, and the accuracy results of the training model are shown in Figure 4. Output part of the model and use the test set that did not participate in the model training to make predictions. Tis was used to check the performance of the trained model, and the relevant results are shown in Table 3. When further analyzing the results, an overall improvement in the training performance of the model was observed with the increase of principal components. However, the accuracy of fne Gaussian SMV and linear discriminant increases frst and then gradually decreases, which means that there is a limit to model optimization, and model performance will not increase infnitely with the increase of principal components. Second, the higher the model accuracy, usually the better the model performance. However, we believe that models trained by cross validation may not be able to completely avoid overftting. Terefore, in order to more objectively evaluate the performance of the trained model, a set of data from the same source but not involved in training is needed as a test set for further verifcation.Te results show that boosted tree has the worst training efect among the 24 algorithms, and the test set is all identifed as \u201cN,\u201d which means that not all algorithms can adapt to such spectral data, so it is necessary to choose an appropriate algorithm to obtain performance relatively best model. It should be noted that due to the reduction of the spectral range, some information is lost, and the performance of the model is afected to a certain extent. Although it was found during the training process that the accuracy of the model increases with the increase of principal components, pursuing only the improvement of accuracy inevitably requires more principal components, resulting in an increase in computation and complexity of the model. Terefore, we believe that before making a decision, these issues need to be considered comprehensively to balance the model\u2019s predictive performance, accuracy, computational complexity, and other parameters. Te experimental results (Table 3) show that the training model and prediction model of quadratic discriminant, cubic SMV, and fne KNN have achieved relatively good results. In the case of similar accuracy, we consider the computational cost and efciency of the model and believe that the fne KNN model with a principal component of 3 is superior to other algorithms. In other similar studies, researchers included approximately 29\u201374 patient samples, with accuracy rates ranging from 72% to 95.7% [29, 31, 34, 35]. In fact, for machine learning, sample size is a key factor afecting the\nquality of model training. After we increased the training set and test set, it also refected a relatively good efect. In the future, we plan to further expand the sample size to correct the model and lay a preliminary experimental foundation for further clinical applications in the future.\n3.4. Preferred Model. Comprehensive analysis of the fne KNN model based on 3 principal components has relatively the best performance. Trough the prediction of the test set, P-Accuracy is 98.00%, and Macro-P, Macro-R and MacroF1 are 98.80%, 97.43%, and 98.06%, respectively. PCA dimensionality reduction is performed on the data, and the data are distributed in three-dimensional space. It can be seen that the spectral data points of diferent categories show a discrete trend, and the spectral data points of the same category show a trend of aggregation, as shown in Figure 5(a). Te spectral data points are shown in the 2D plane that was correctly classifed during training. Te results show that each spectral data is correctly classifed, and the training efect is good. Te results are shown in Figure 5(b). Export the trained model for prediction on the test set. Te predicted spectral results of each group were almost always correctly classifed. Te results show that the model is not overftting, and the results are shown in Figure 5(c). We usually use the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) to measure the method\u2019s ability to identify diseases. Te area under the ROC curve (AUC) is between 0.5 and 1. In the case of AUC> 0.5, the closer the AUC is to 1, the better the diagnostic efect. AUC has lower accuracy when it is 0.5\u20130.7. AUC has a certain accuracy when it is 0.7\u20130.9. Te accuracy is higher when the AUC is above 0.9. In this study, AUC\ufffd 0.98, indicating that the model has excellent accuracy, and the results are shown in Figure 5(d). Te KNN method is a simple but efective classifcation method that classifes examples based on the intuitive premise and similar data points in close proximity in the feature space [36]. In this study, the fne KNN performed very well in the spectral discrimination of related diseases, which has important potential for clinical application. Cancer patients are usually tested with x-rays. Additional evaluation with ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging is usually required for high-risk patients with suspicious radiographic fndings [37]. Tis requires medical institutions to provide corresponding equipment and relevant imaging specialists. Equipment costs and personnel costs are unafordable in some areas. Alternatives such as thermography, transillumination, and positron emission tomography have not been shown to be more sensitive or specifc than radiography. Terefore, the mid-\ninfrared spectroscopy with simple operation, rapid detection, no damage to the sample, and no reagent addition is a promising alternative. Mid-infrared spectrometers, on the other hand, can produce unique spectral \u201cfngerprints\u201d by detecting the absorption of infrared light by organic compounds at energies (wavenumbers) that correspond to the properties of the bonds between their atoms. In fact, water in serum accounts for about 90%, and the solvation of water\nand the change of cluster structure have a great infuence on the structure of solute, and the two infuences each other. Terefore, the essence of this spectral \u201cfngerprint\u201d is the infrared spectrum of solvent water that contains a large amount of information about the solute in the solution, which is also the theoretical basis of aquaphotomics [38\u201340]. So we think that by measuring serum spectra, it is theoretically possible to identify biochemical diferences in\npatient samples that are associated with disease. On this basis, combining the spectral \u201cfngerprint\u201d with the fne KNN model may be able to assist clinical screening of high-risk breast and lung cancer patients in the general population at a lower cost and higher sensitivity in the future."

            "text": "Te burden of cancer in the global society is increasing. Breast cancer and lung cancer are the top two cancers worldwide. New cases account for the majority of cancer patients worldwide. At present, breast cancer and lung cancer are the two tumors with the largest health burden in the world. Early diagnosis is an important prognostic factor. Timely detection, diferentiation, and treatment are of great signifcance for alleviating the status quo of these two diseases. Infrared spectroscopy is generally considered a simple,\nreagent-free, inexpensive, noninvasive, and nondestructive technique. Terefore, it has been widely used in pharmaceutical, food, environmental, and forensic industries. In fact, infrared technology has begun to show great potential in clinical application.\nTis study established a simple, noninvasive rapid screening method for the auxiliary diagnosis of breast cancer and lung cancer. First, in a pilot experiment, we developed the model using TQ Analyst 9 (Termo Fisher Scientifc, Waltham, MA, USA) using the traditional method. Te preexperimental results show that the model established directly with the original spectral data as a variable is not efective and cannot meet the research needs. To do this, we convert the spectrum into a matrix of numbers. We train the spectral data based on diferent algorithms and output the corresponding prediction models. At the same time, combined with the characteristics of the data itself, k-fold cross validation and random algorithm are used to divide the\ntraining set and test set to solve the problems of chance and overftting. From the diference spectrum results, there are signifcant diferences in the mid-infrared spectra between diferent types of sera. Tese diferences may mainly refect protein abundance expression. Tis has an important prompting efect for the subsequent exploration of cancer classifcation. We compare decision trees, discriminant analysis, SVM, kNN and other 24 models, and fne KNN, which is superior to other models in terms of training model accuracy, calculation cost, and prediction accuracy, trains the data, and outputs the predictionmodel. In summary, this study established a rapid screening method for the auxiliary diagnosis of breast cancer and lung cancer based on serum mid-infrared spectroscopy. Under the same conditions, the fne KNN model is superior to the classifcation algorithm model. In addition, compared with traditional cancer detectionmethods, this nondestructive rapid detectionmethod has obvious advantages, or it can realize rapid screening of serum breast cancer and lung cancer. Tis may provide new ideas for the development of new detection methods in the medical feld. It also allows us to see the important potential of identifying many diferent cancers simultaneously from a single serum. Tis is also the direction of our later eforts, but it requires more clinically diagnosed samples of diferent categories to train the model."
