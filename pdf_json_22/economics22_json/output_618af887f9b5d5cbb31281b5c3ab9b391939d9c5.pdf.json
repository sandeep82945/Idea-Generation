            "text": "-- Evidence from Polluting Industries Firms in China 15 Abstract: In recent years, under the background of vigorously promoting environmental governance, 16 the implementation effect of the central environmental protection inspection is an issue of great concern to 17 the government and the public. This paper systematically investigates the impact of central environmental 18 protection inspection on the risk of stock price crash using a sample of listed firms in polluting industries. 19 The results show that compared with non-supervised areas, central environmental protection inspection can 20 reduce the polluting industries firms\u2019 stock price crash risk by reducing stock price bubbles. After a series 21 of robustness tests, the results still held. The above transmission mechanism is more effective in the samples 22 of private enterprises, low information transparency and disclosure quality enterprises, non-national 23 civilized urban areas and high promotion incentive areas. Furthermore, this paper found that there were 24 differences in the effects of central environmental protection inspection in different batches. Among the 25 effects of central environmental protection inspection in different batches, the effect of environmental 26 regulation in the second, third and fourth batches was better, and the effect of central environmental 27 protection inspection in different batches gradually deepened. Finally, by analyzing the environmental 28 governance of the central environmental protection inspection, it is found that the central environmental 29 protection inspection has significant short-term and long-term control effect in air pollution governance, 30 and it is still necessary to strengthen the law enforcement in water pollution governance. 31 Key Words: CEPI; stock price crash risk; polluting industry; China; stock price bubble; list firms 32\nI. Introduction 33 China\u2019s rapid economic development has also brought about many environmental problems, such as 34 water, soil and air pollution. The increasingly prominent ecological and environmental problems have 35 attracted the attention of the central government, which has gradually formulated corresponding 36 environmental governance acts. on April 24, 2014, the eighth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 37 12th National People\u2019s Congress amended the Environmental Protection Law of the People\u2019s Republic of 38 China, which clearly established environmental protection as a basic state policy. The implementation effect 39 of environmental policies has been a key concern of the relevant authorities, but due to the strength of local 40 government environmental enforcement and the low cost of environmental violations by enterprises, the 41 implementation effect of environmental policies has not been satisfactory. 42 Compared with previous environmental policies, the Central Environmental Protection Inspector 43 (CEPI) has made the results of the inspectors an important basis for the assessment and appointment of 44 leading cadres, increased the assessment of local governments\u2019 environmental performance, enhanced local 45 governments\u2019 enforcement efforts, and improved the problems of poor policy implementation and difficult 46 accountability of local governments in the process of environmental governance. Scholars have studied the 47 implementation effect of CEPI in terms of environmental quality improvement (Wu and Hu, 2019; Jia and 48 Chen, 2019; He and Geng, 2020; Zhang et al., 2018), corporate stock value (Tian et al., 2019), and capital 49 market response (Zeng et al., 2021), respectively. Then, in a market environment where China\u2019s 50 environmental regulatory system is not yet perfect, whether CEPI can have a good effect on environmental 51\ninformation disclosure, reduce the hoarding of negative corporate information and reduce the risk of 52 corporate stock price crash risk. Whether there are differences in the effects of CEPI between batches. The 53 answers to the above two questions help us further assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the 54 CEPI policy. 55 The existing literature examining the causes of stock price crash risk focuses on both internal corporate 56 governance factors (Hutton et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2014) and external environmental factors (Hong and 57 Stein, 2003; Callen and Fang, 2015), and concludes that information opacity from the cover-up of negative 58 news is an important cause of crash risk. Few scholars have analyzed the formation of stock price crash 59 risk from the perspective of environmental information disclosure. Our study is a strong addition to the 60 relevant literature. 61 We find that CEPI reduce the risk of stock price collapse for firms in polluting industries in the 62 inspector areas compared to non-inspector areas. We also find that the effect of CEPI on firms\u2019 stock price 63 crash risk compared to non-environmental inspector regions is mainly found in the sample of private firms 64 and those with lower information transparency, and in the sample of non-national civilized cities and 65 regions with weaker incentives for officials\u2019 promotion. Further analysis finds that CEPI reduce the risk of 66 stock price crash for firms in polluting industries by reducing stock price bubbles. Finally, the action of the 67 batches of CEPI, mainly the second, third and fourth batches, reduces the stock price crash risk of polluting 68 industry firms in the region compared to non-environmental inspector regions. 69 Compared with the existing literature, the contribution of our study is mainly in the following three 70\naspects: first, we analyze the environmental information disclosure effect of the CEPI from the perspective 71 of stock price crash risk. With the increased importance of environmental pollution control in China's 72 capital market, has the increase in the intensity of government environmental regulations effectively 73 enhanced the effect of environmental information disclosure? We provide empirical evidence for the above 74 question from the perspective of stock price collapse risk. Second, we enrich the research related to 75 mandatory environmental information disclosure. The existing literature has focused on firms' 76 environmental disclosure effects through environmental reports (Gray et al., 2001), annual and independent 77 reports (Guthrie et al., 2008), social responsibility reports (Lu and Abeysekera, 2014), press conferences 78 and corporate meetings (Zeghal and Ahmed, 1990), etc. We instead focus on the disclosure effects of CEPI. 79 This expands the studies related to mandatory environmental information disclosure. Third, we assess the 80 environmental governance effects of CEPI, and provide policy recommendations for the subsequent 81 promotion of CEPI. 82"

            "text": "In July 2015, the Environmental Protection Inspection Program (Pilot) was introduced and the Chinese 85 central government established an environmental protection inspection mechanism. The first round of 86 CEPI was then carried out in batches (pilot, first batch, second batch, third batch and fourth batch) in 31 87 provinces, cities and regions across the country. Unlike previous environmental policies, the CEPI have the 88 characteristic of monitoring both \u201centerprises\u201d and \u201clocal governments\u201d. This means that the CEPI are no 89\nlonger looking for a short-lived \u201cpolitical blue sky\u201d, but rather sustainable development. CEPI provide 90 feedback to local governments on environmental pollution through mass monitoring, such as calls and 91 letters. They then urge the local governments to rectify the situation by a deadline and make the local 92 governments disclose the rectification plans and implementation status to the society. It can be said that the 93 CEPI are a major innovation in China\u2019s environmental regulatory system. 94 The CEPI inspected 31 provinces, cities and regions from January 4, 2016 to September 15, 95 2017.From January 4, 2016 to February 4, 2016, a pilot CEPI was launched in Hebei Province. Since then, 96 the environmental protection inspectors have taken 21 months to achieve full coverage of the country\u2019s 31 97 provinces, cities and regions, with each batch geared toward the eastern, central and western regions. Each 98 batch lasts about a month and involves 7 or 8 provinces, cities and regions. The whole inspection process 99 is divided into three stages, each stage lasts about 10 days. In the first stage the inspection team talks with 100 the provincial party committees, provincial governments and leaders of relevant departments and receives 101 complaints from the public. The second stage investigates and verifies environmental problems by 102 checking official documents and investigating pollution on the ground, and comes up with a list of 103 environmental problems. The third stage speaks about the list of problems transferred to the local 104 government, requiring it to rectify and feedback by a deadline. Pilot areas and four batches of environmental 105 protection inspectors received a total of 99,783 cases reported by the public, shut down and rectified 82,081 106 enterprises, interviewed 17,601 relevant personnel, 17,707 people were held accountable, detained 1,543 107 people, and fined 1.306 billion yuan. Among them, the fines are not less than 100 million yuan in the 108\nfollowing regions: Shandong Province, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province and 109 Guangdong Province. The region with the most fines is Zhejiang Province. 110 2. Literature review and hypothesis formulation 111 Existing research on CEPI is divided into four main parts. The first is to study the emission reduction 112 effect of CEPI. In the theoretical model, Chong and Sun (2020) explored the emission reduction strategies 113 of CEPI based on an evolutionary game theory model. In the empirical analysis, many scholars found that 114 CEPI can improve environmental quality (Wu and Hu, 2019; Jia and Chen, 2019; He and Geng, 2020) and 115 reduce pollutant emissions (Zhang et al., 2018). While Wu and Hu (2019) argue that the emission reduction 116 effect of CEPI is not sustainable in the short term, Jia and Chen (2019) argue that this effect will not 117 gradually diminish after regulation. Second, study the capital market response to the CEPI. Scholars have 118 analyzed the effect of CEPI in terms of corporate stock value (Tian et al., 2019) and capital market response 119 (Zeng et al., 2021), respectively. With the exception of Zhang et al. (2021), there is little literature examining 120 the effect of CEPI' policies on the risk of stock price crash. 121 The existing literature analyzes the causes of stock price crash risk mainly at the firm level and at the 122 management level, such as the shareholding of large shareholders (Boubaker et al., 2014), management 123 and board ownership, board size and director independence (Andreou et al., 2016), board diversity in terms 124 of gender, age, tenure and education (Jebran et al., 2020) and management overconfidence (Kim et al., 125 2016). From the available studies, it seems that information opacity is an important reason for the formation 126 of stock price crash risk. 127\nIn recent years, scholars have begun to focus on the impact of information disclosure on stock price 128 crash risk. Hutton et al. (2009) found that the lower the information transparency of financial statements, 129 the higher the risk of corporate stock price crash. DeFond et al. (2015), on the other hand, found that 130 changes in the financial reporting environment after the implementation of mandatory IFRS can reduces 131 the stock price crash risk by increasing corporate financial information disclosure. 132 The most relevant literature to this paper is Zhang et al. (2021), which examines the impact of CEPI 133 on the stock price crash risk and analyzes the potential mechanism from a corporate governance perspective, 134 and we differ from Zhang et al. (2021) in three ways. The first is the difference in data structure. Zhang et 135 al. (2021) use firm-year level panel data. The time span between batches of CEPI is known from the policy 136 compendium section to be less than one year. Using yearly data may not clearly identify the implementation 137 effects of each batch of CEPI. Therefore, we use firm-quarter level panel data for regression analysis. The 138 second is the mechanism of the impact of the CEPI. We analyze the potential mechanisms by which CEPI 139 affect the firm\u2019s stock price crash risk from the stock price bubble perspective. The third is the 140 environmental governance effect of the CEPI. We systematically analyze the short-run and long-run 141 environmental governance effects of the CEPI. 142 In summary, although the existing literature has analyzed the implementation effects of CEPI from 143 multiple levels, it has not systematically analyzed the information disclosure effects of CEPI. Although the 144 causes of stock price crash risk have been analyzed from the perspective of various types of information 145 disclosure, there is little literature on the impact of environmental information disclosure on stock price 146\ncrash risk. In the studies related to environmental information disclosure, the way of corporate 147 environmental information disclosure is mainly described qualitatively. Environmental information 148 disclosure methods include corporate annual reports, environmental reports and social responsibility 149 reports (Gray et al., 2001; Guthrie et al., 2008; Lu and Abeysekera, 2014). For enterprises, the above-150 mentioned environmental information disclosure methods are still somewhat autonomous and selective. 151 The CEPI provides a good external environment for testing the effectiveness of mandatory environmental 152 information disclosure. 153 We believe that CEPI will affect stock price crash risk in two ways. On the one hand, repeated and 154 continuous inspectors can help reduce information asymmetry between the central government and local 155 governments, and the random nature of inspectors can help eliminate local governments' sheltering 156 behavior towards local polluters, increase the likelihood of environmental violations being exposed, and 157 reduce the accumulation of negative information about firms, which in turn reduces the risk of firm stock 158 price crashes. On the other hand, in terms of public participation to improve air pollution governance 159 research, public participation can enhance environmental performance and environmental governance by 160 enhancing the effectiveness of regulators\u2019 resource allocation (Dong et al., 2011) and the efficiency of 161 government decision-making (North et al., 2014) (Wu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). The public participation 162 feature of the CEPI is very obvious, as the CEPI collect and verify public complaint information online and 163 make the inspector feedback results public, which significantly enhances public participation in 164 environmental governance. This feature of the CEPI will further increase the disclosure of negative 165\ncorporate information, which in turn reduce the stock price crash risk. Since environmental violations 166 mainly occur in the polluting industry sample, our study population is selected as polluting industry firms. 167 Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis: 168 Hypothesis: CEPI reduce the firms\u2019 stock price crash risk in polluting industries. 169\nIII. Sample selection and study design 170 1. Measuring the stock price crash risk 171 Referring to Chen et al. (2001) and Hutton et al. (2009), we use NCSKEW and DUVOL to measure 172 the firms\u2019 stock price crash risk. The specific calculations are as follows: 173 First, calculate the daily return at the firm level \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 = ln(1 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61) 174 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc0 + \ud835\udefc1\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a.\ud835\udc61\u22122 + \ud835\udefc2\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a.\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udefc3\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a.\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefc4\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a.\ud835\udc61+1 + \ud835\udefc5\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a.\ud835\udc61+2 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 (1) 175 Second, calculate \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a: 176 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 = \u2212[\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1)32 \u2211 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc613 ]/[(\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1)(\ud835\udc5b \u2212 2)(\u2211 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc612 )32] (2) 177 Where, n is the number of trading days in a quarter. A larger NCSKEW indicates a higher stock price 178 crash risk. 179 Finally, calculate \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f: 180 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61 = log{[(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d \u2212 1) \u2211 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc612\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b ]/[(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) \u2211 \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc612\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d ]] (3) 181 Where, \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b) A is the number of trading days when the daily return of the stock is above 182 (below) the mean of the current quarter\u2019s return. The sample is divided into a rising stock price group (\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d) 183 and a falling stock price group (\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b) based on whether the stock\u2019s daily return is above the average return 184\nof the current quarter. A larger value of \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3f indicates a higher stock price crash risk. 185 2. Research Design 186 For the selection of the study interval, we made the following adjustments. First, the CEPI first started 187 on January 4, 2016 and ended on September 15, 2017. Although the environmental protection inspector 188 look-back operation started in early 2018, each region started the inspector look-back only one year after 189 the CEPI. Therefore, the inspector look-back policy will basically have no impact on our results. 190 Accordingly, we selected a cut-off date of the end of 2019. Second, although the earliest CEPI began on 191 January 4, 2016, the CEPI team was already stationed in Hebei Province at the end of 2015. We therefore 192 set the start of the control group sample in 2014. Accordingly, we use the data of listed companies in 193 polluting industry firms from 2014-2019 and apply the multi-period DID method to test the impact of the 194 CEPI on the stock price crash risk of polluting industry firms: 195 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 (4) 196 Which, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 denotes the risk of stock price crash for firm i in region p and period t. \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 denotes 197 a policy dummy variable that takes the value of 1 when an area is launched as an inspector for the quarter 198 and thereafter, and 0 for the others. The definition of polluting enterprises is based on the \u201cList of Listed 199 Enterprises for Environmental Verification Industry Classification and Management\u201d published by the 200 Ministry of Environmental Protection on June 24, 2008. 201 Following Chen et al. (2001) and Kim et al. (2011), We further control for lagged one-period indicators 202 (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121) that may affect the firms\u2019 stock price crash risk, includes: Lev, Size, Roe, Sigma, Ret, Turnover, 203\nTop10 and lag NCSKEW. 204 Also, since district characteristics may affect whether the district is inspected or not. Therefore, to 205 control for the endogeneity problem caused by omitting district characteristics, we control for a one-period 206 lag of the district-level characteristic variables (\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 ), includes: regional economic development 207 indicators LnGDP and regional population indicators LnPop. We further control for firm fixed effects and 208 time fixed effects. 209 3. Descriptive Statistics 210 We select data on listed companies in China\u2019s polluting industry firms from the first quarter of 2014 211 to the fourth quarter of 2019 to examine the impact of CEPI on the stock price crash risk of polluting 212 industry firms. Among them, firm-level indicators are from the CSMAR database and regional-level data 213 are from the EPS database. We screen the initial sample as follows: (1) in estimating the stock price crash 214 risk indicators, exclude samples with less than 30 trading days per quarter; (2) exclude samples of financial 215 industry enterprises; (3) exclude \u201cST\u201d and \u201c*ST\u201d enterprises. The continuous variables were subjected to 216 a 1% tailing process. 217 Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1, where the mean values of NCSKEW and DUVOL are -218 0.4214 and -0.3268, respectively, and the median values are -0.4898 and -0.3805, respectively. This 219 indicates that the stock price crash risk is at a low level. The mean value of the gearing ratio is 0.4073, with 220 a minimum value of 0.0589 and a maximum value of 0.8788. This indicates that the leverage ratio of listed 221 companies varies widely and is at a low level. 222\nTable 1 Descriptive Statistics 223\nVariables N Mean Median SD Min Max NCSKEW 31846 -0.4214 -0.4898 0.9500 -2.6828 2.2270 DUVOL 31846 -0.3268 -0.3805 0.7707 -2.0490 1.7317\nLev 30235 0.4073 0.3981 0.1960 0.0589 0.8788 Size 30235 22.1822 21.9939 1.3043 19.9712 26.1102 Roe 30192 0.0401 0.0313 0.0605 -0.2179 0.2349\nSigma 31846 0.0289 0.0259 0.0131 0.0098 0.0757 Turnover 31279 -3.1219 -1.8133 42.7826 -166.7972 161.0072\nRet 31846 0.0008 0.0001 0.0043 -0.0081 0.0184 Top10 31816 59.7651 60.8200 14.7003 24.9800 91.4400\nLnGDP 31846 21.7595 28.3886 8.9001 9.4091 29.8250 LnPop 31846 8.6152 8.6856 0.6106 6.5338 9.3366 224 IV. Empirical Results and Analysis 225 1. Analysis of basic results 226 We use a multi-period DID approach to test the impact of CEPI on the firms\u2019 stock price crash in 227 polluting industries, and the regression results are shown in Table 2. Controlling for time fixed effects and 228 firm fixed effects, the coefficients of DT are significantly negative after gradually adding firm- and region-229 level control variables. It indicates that the CEPI reduce the firms\u2019 stock price crash in polluting industries 230 in the inspector areas compared to non-inspector areas. The results in columns (5)-(6) show that after the 231 CEPI, the firms\u2019 stock price crash in the inspector areas is reduced by 0.0538 (NCSKEW) and 0.0454 232 (DUVOL) compared to the non-inspector areas, which is equivalent to 12.77% and 13.89% of the mean 233 values of stock price crash risk indicators NCSKEW and DUVOL. 234\nNote: t-values in parentheses, ***, **, * indicate significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% significant levels, respectively. 236 A prerequisite for the unbiased results of the difference in difference estimation is that the parallel 237\ntrend hypothesis is satisfied between the control and experimental groups, i.e., the control and control 238 groups share a common trend of change prior to the event. To test whether the baseline regression satisfies 239 the common trend test, we include the interaction term between the dummy variable and the policy variable 240 at each time point in the regression. And if the coefficient of the interaction term before the inspector is not 241 significant, it indicates that the parallel trend holds. The regression model as follows: 242 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc + \u2211 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udf0f12\ud835\udf0f=\u22126 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 (5) 243 Which, \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47 is a dummy variable, takes 1 if province p has an environmental inspector at time t-\u03c4, and 244 0 otherwise. \u03b20 is the effect of the environmental protection inspector in the current period, \u03b2-1 to \u03b2-6 is the 245 effect of the environmental inspector before 1-6 periods, \u03b21 to \u03b212 is the effect of the environmental 246 protection inspector after 1-12 periods, and \u03b21 to \u03b212 is the dynamic effect of the inspector over time. If the 247 coefficients of \u03b2-1 to \u03b2-6 are close to 0 and the coefficients of \u03b21 to \u03b212 are different from 0, it indicates that 248 the parallel trend test hypothesis is valid. The results of the parallel trend test in Figure 1 show that the 249 coefficients of \u03b2-2 to \u03b2-6 are not statistically significantly different from 0, and the coefficients of \u03b21 to \u03b212 250 are negative and statistically significantly smaller than 0. The parallel trend hypothesis is valid. 251\nindustries: steel, coal, cement, shipbuilding, electrolytic aluminum, and glass, and we adopt the CITIC 266 Securities industry classification criteria to exclude these six-industry enterprise sample. 267 The regression results of the above robustness test are shown in Table 3. Columns (1)-(2) are the 268 regression results excluding the sample of corporate address changes. Columns (3)-(4) are the results of the 269 regressions excluding the de-capacity samples. The coefficient of DT is significantly negative, which is 270 consistent with the regression results in the main results. 271\n(2) Exclusion of spillover effects. 273 The CEPI divide the treatment and control groups based on geographical boundaries. Due to policy 274 externalities, spillover effects may occur between treatment and control groups. That is, CEPI may affect 275 the neighboring control group provinces, which violates the independence between treatment and control 276 groups. Accordingly, we refer to Clarke (2017) to test the policy effects of CEPI after excluding spillover 277 effects. The Spillover-Robust DID method is constructed, and the model is set as follows: 278 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udefc + \ud835\udf111\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf112\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 (6) 279 Where, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d,\ud835\udc61 denotes the nearest neighbor treatment group effect. If region p has CEPI in quarter 280 t, its neighboring regions are set to 1 in quarter t and thereafter, and the rest are set to 0. The remaining 281 variables are defined in the same way as in equation (4). Since CEPI is a one-time inspector mechanism, 282\nthere is no spillover effect for any of the regions that have been inspected, so none of the inspected regions 283 are set as adjacent regions. The test results of the spillover effect of the CEPI are shown in Table 4, the DT 284 coefficient is significantly negative and the Close coefficient is not significant, indicating that there is no 285 spillover effect of the CEPI on neighboring areas. 286\n288 (3) Substitution of stock price crash risk indicators. 289 We use NCSKEW and DUVOL as explanatory variables in the main text. To avoid estimation bias 290 introduced by the selection of the explanatory variables. We refer to Callen and Fang (2015) and use 291 whether stock returns are downward or upward (Crash) to measure stock price crash risk. The regression 292 results are shown in column (1) of Table 5, and after replacing the indicators, the regression results are still 293 consistent with the main results. 294 (4) Placebo test. 295 To test the randomness of the timing of the implementation of the CEPI, we conduct a placebo test for 296 the time of the occurrence of the policy antecedently. If the coefficient of DT remains significantly negative 297 in the results for one period ahead and two periods ahead, indicates that there are non-CEPI factors driving 298 the change in stock price crash risk, not just the effect of the CEPI. The placebo test results are shown in 299\ncolumns (2)-(5) of Table 5, the coefficient of DT is not significant, ruling out any interference in our results 300 from some of the non-CEPI factors or potentially unpredictable factors. 301\n303 3. Heterogeneity test 304 (1) Corporate heterogeneity test. 305 Compared with state-owned enterprises, private enterprises have fewer agency problems among 306 themselves, and managers\u2019 interests are relatively consistent with those of the company. Therefore, when 307 negative information appears in a company, managers will also hide negative information out of personal 308 interest. Negative environmental information disclosure can reduce managers\u2019 opportunistic behavior, 309 reduce negative information hiding, and thus reduce the risk of stock price crash. Accordingly, we 310 empirically analyze whether the dampening effect of CEPI on stock price crash risk is more significant 311 among private firms. The regression results of the firm heterogeneity test are shown in Table 6. The 312 coefficient of DT is significantly negative in the private enterprise sample in columns (1)-(4) and 313 insignificant in the state-owned enterprise sample. This indicates that the CEPI reduce the stock price crash 314 risk by increasing the disclosure of negative environmental information of private firms in the inspected 315 areas compared to non-environmental inspector areas, and this effect is not significant in the SOE sample, 316 reflecting to some extent the sheltering of SOEs by the local government. 317\nIn addition to this, to further test the differences between groups. We used Bootstrap method to 318 calculate empirical p-values for the differences between groups in the sample by firm nature. A random 319 sample of 300 times was set. The results of the test are shown in Table 6, and the coefficients between 320 groups show significant differences. 321\nEmpirical p-values 0.007 0.017 323 (2) Information transparency and disclosure quality heterogeneity test. 324 Kim and Zhang (2014) show that the lower the transparency of the firm, the stronger the manager\u2019s 325 incentive to hide bad news. Based on this logic, for firms with low transparency of financial information 326 and poor quality of information disclosure, the more managers hide bad news, the higher stock price crash 327 risk of the firm. The CEPI have increased the disclosure of negative environmental information of firms in 328 the inspected areas by increasing environmental supervision. For firms with low transparency, CEPI can 329 disclose more environmental information. The theoretical effect of CEPI on stock price crash risk reduction 330 is more effective in the sample with lower information transparency and poorer disclosure quality. 331 Based on the above analysis, we empirically test the mechanism of the role of information 332 transparency and information disclosure quality in the stock price crash risk by CEPI. First, we refer to 333 Hutton et al. (2009), which uses the sum of the absolute values of firms\u2019 surplus management in the 334\nprevious three years to measure the information transparency of firms, and a larger value indicates a lower 335 information transparency of firms. We divide the 2014 corporate information transparency indicators into 336 a lower corporate transparency sample and a higher transparency sample based on the median of the 2014 337 corporate information transparency indicators. Second, we further examine the results of heterogeneity in 338 the quality of corporate information disclosure. We use the Shenzhen Stock Exchange\u2019s rating of 339 information disclosure quality of listed companies to measure the quality of corporate information 340 disclosure, and its assessment results are divided into four levels: excellent, good, qualified and unqualified. 341 If the assessment result in 2014 is excellent or good, it is classified as a higher disclosure quality sample 342 and takes the value of 1. If the assessment result in 2014 is qualified or unqualified, it is classified as a lower 343 disclosure quality sample and takes the value of 0. 344 The regression results of the sub-firm transparency heterogeneity test are shown in columns (1)-(4) of 345\nTable 7. The coefficient of DT is significantly negative in the low-transparency sample and insignificant in 346 the high-transparency sample. It indicates that the CEPI mainly reduce the firms' stock price crash risk in 347 low-transparency polluting industries in the region compared to non-inspector regions. The regression 348 results of the heterogeneity test of information disclosure quality are shown in columns (5)-(8) of Table 7, 349 where the coefficient of DT is significantly negative in the low disclosure quality sample and insignificant 350 in the high disclosure quality sample. It indicates that the higher information asymmetry, the more 351 significant inhibitory effect of the CEPI on the stock price crash risk. To further test the differences between 352 groups, we calculated empirical p-values for the differences between sub-sample groups using the 353\nBootstrap method, setting a random sample of 300 times. The results of the test are shown in Table 7, where 354 the between-group coefficients of the core explanatory variables all show significant differences. 355\n357 (3) Officials\u2019 promotion incentives heterogeneity test. 358 Although the central government in China maintains its political authority in environmental planning, 359 the most basic implementation decisions and responsibilities have been assigned to local governments, and 360 an environmental decentralization mechanism exists (Zheng, 2007). Previous studies have shown that the 361 official promotion of local officials is linked to the level of regional economic development (Li and Zhou, 362 2005; Yao and Zhang, 2015), but the goals of the central and local governments in environmental protection 363 are often inconsistent. Local governments have weak incentives to strengthen local enforcement efforts 364 (Van Rooij, 2006) and sometimes provide false environmental data in response to central government 365 environmental assessment requirements (Tian et al., 2020). Unlike previous environmental policies, CEPI 366 are able to monitor local governments by mobilizing the public and include the results in the assessment 367 and appointment of government officials. Thus, CEPI have the characteristic of monitoring local 368 governments. Zhang et al. (2018) show that direct central regulation can reduce information asymmetry 369 between central and local governments. Xie and Yong (2020) also show that under the deterrent effect of 370 CEPI, political connections are no longer an effective way for polluters to circumvent strict environmental 371\nregulation. We therefore expect the mitigating effect of CEPI on stock price crash risk to be more 372 pronounced under higher official promotion incentives. 373 Accordingly, we test the heterogeneous effect of officials\u2019 promotion incentives in the CEPI. We use 374 the following method to define promotion incentive indicators. First, define Remaining Political Age (RPA) 375 as the difference between an official\u2019s age at the time of taking office and the legal retirement age. The 376 retirement age is set to be, 65 for men and 60 for women. Secondly, the future political promotion space of 377 the officials is defined as the distance between the political level (LE) of their current position and the 378 highest official level. Finally, Politics Promotion (PP) was calculated with PP=RPA/(5-LE). After that, 379 according to the median of official promotion incentive index in 2014 divided them into a larger sample of 380 official promotion incentive and a smaller sample, the results of official promotion heterogeneity test are 381 shown in Table 8, the coefficients of DT for high official promotion incentive samples in columns (1)-(4) 382 are basically significant negative, and the coefficients of DT for low official promotion incentive samples 383 are not significant, indicating that the higher the official promotion incentive, the more significant effect of 384 CEPI. 385 To further test the differences between groups, we calculated the empirical p-values of the differences 386 between sub-sample groups using the Bootstrap method, setting a random sample of 300 times, and the test 387 results are shown in Table 8, where the coefficients of the core explanatory variables (DT) show significant 388 differences between groups. 389\n(-2.7718) (0.1128) (-3.0612) (-0.1532)\nAll Controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Time and Firm-FE Yes Yes Yes Yes\nN 12,602 13,965 12,602 13,965 Adjusted R2 0.1340 0.1295 0.1659 0.1568\nEmpirical p-values 0.000 0.000 391 4. Mechanism Analysis 392 We refer to Dass et al. (2008) to test whether CEPI reduce the stock price crash risk by reducing stock 393 price bubbles. First, we use the price-to-book ratio (PB) and price-to-sales ratio (PS) to indicate the size of 394 the stock price bubble of listed companies. The larger the value of PB/PS, the larger the stock price bubble. 395 Second, the sample is sorted by PB/PS from smallest to largest and divided equally into four groups, and 396 the fourth group of stocks is defined as bubble stocks. The dummy variables PBDummy and PSDummy are 397 defined, and the bubble stocks take the value of 1, the rest take the value of 0. The regression results are 398 shown in Table 9, and the coefficient of DT is significantly negative, indicating that the CEPI reduces the 399 corporate stock price bubble. 400\n402 V. Further Analysis 403 1. The batches of CEPI effect test 404 Considering that the CEPI are environmental policies that gradually expand in scope in batches, the 405 environmental protection inspectors of the previous batch may have certain warning and learning effects 406 on the next batch. Theoretically, CEPI should deepen continuously in each batch. Accordingly, we test the 407 stock price crash risk effect of CEPI in batches, and the results of the batch wise regressions are shown in 408\nTable 10. The results in columns (5)-(6) show that the coefficients of DT*Batch 2, DT*Batch 3 and 409\nDT*Batch 4 are significantly negative, and the coefficients of DT*Pilot and DT*Batch 1 are not significant, 410 indicating that among the batches of environmental protection inspectors, the effect of pilot areas and the 411 first batch of CEPI is poorer, and the second, third and fourth batches of CEPI have more significant effects. 412 Moreover, by comparing the coefficients of DT for each batch in columns (5) and (6), it is found that the 413 effect of CEPI is increasing from the pilot batch to the third batch as the policy of CEPI continues to 414 progress, as shown by the regression coefficients of -0.0418>-0.0499>-0.0572>-0.0574 in column (5) and 415 - 0.0199>-0.0274>-0.0502>-0.0562, where the inspection effect of the fourth batch of CEPI is slightly 416 lower than that of the second and third batches. 417\n419 2. The environmental governance effect of CEPI 420 The objectives of CEPI include restraining the environmental violations of non-compliant enterprises 421 and increasing their environmental governance investment. Accordingly, we examine the impact of CEPI 422 on long-term corporate governance investment and short-term emission reductions at the firm level. We 423 examine the regional environmental governance effects of CEPI at the regional level. 424 We test the governance effects of CEPI at the enterprise level. First, we test the impact of CEPI on the 425 long-term governance investment of enterprises. We test the impact of CEPI on corporate emissions costs 426\nby collecting and collating data on corporate emissions costs from disclosure reports of listed companies, 427 and using the logged corporate emissions cost indicator Pay. We test the impact of CEPI on corporate water 428 and air pollution treatment expenditures by using corporate air treatment input and water treatment input 429 data from the CSMAR database. Among them, the indicators of corporate pollution control inputs are 430 obtained from CSMAR\u2019s environmental research database of listed companies, and the logged water 431 pollution input costs Water_Pay and logged air pollution input costs Gas_Pay indicators are used as 432 corporate pollution control input indicators. The regression results in columns (1)-(3) of Table 11 show that 433 CEPI significantly increase the expenditure of corporate emission fees and increase corporate air pollution 434 treatment inputs, but not water pollution treatment inputs. Second, we test the impact of CEPI on firms\u2019 435 short-term emission reduction. In particular, information on wastewater (Water) and exhaust gas (SO2 and 436 COD) emissions are obtained from the CSMAR database. The regression results in columns (4)-(6) of 437\nTable 11 show that the CEPI significantly reduce SO2 and COD polluting gas emissions of enterprises in 438 polluting industries, and do not reduce wastewater emissions. Third, we examine the impact of CEPI on 439 firms\u2019 green patent applications. Among them, green patent application data are obtained from the CNRDS 440 database, including green invention patent application (GreenInv) and green utility model patent 441 application (GreenNew) data. The regression results in columns (7)-(8) of Table 11 show that CEPI 442 significantly increase the number of green invention patent and green utility model patent applications and 443 enhance the R&D level of enterprises in polluting industries. 444 The regression results in Table 11 show that there is heterogeneity in the environmental governance 445 effects of the CEPI. For water pollution control, the effect of CEPI on the long-term treatment investment 446 and short-term emission reduction of enterprises is not significant. For air pollution treatment, the effect of 447 CEPI on long-term treatment investment and short-term emission reduction by enterprises is significant. It 448 shows that CEPI in the treatment of air pollution does play a certain governance effect, there are certain 449 defects in the treatment of water pollution. Therefore, the government should further deepen the supervision 450 intensity of CEPI in water pollution management. 451\n(2.0194) (-0.6351) (1.4592) (0.2096) (-2.0901) (-2.1767) (3.1986) (2.6800)\nAll Controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Time and Firm-FE Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nN 26,567 27,129 27,129 26,567 26,567 26,567 26,567 26,567 Adjusted R2 0.8200 0.3079 0.3786 0.4087 0.4874 0.4451 0.8803 0.8042\n453 We examined the effectiveness of CEPI\u2019 governance at the regional level. We collected emission data 454 such as industrial wastewater emissions, industrial SO2 emissions, and industrial soot emissions, as well as 455 patent data such as the number of patent applications, the number of patents granted, and the number of 456 invention patents granted, for each region by compiling the China City Statistical Yearbook. After that, we 457 use the logarithmic regional emission indicators Ind_Water/ Ind_SO2/ Ind_Dust, and the indicators 458 Inv_App/ Inv_Aut/ Inv_Ant of patent applications (total number of invention patents and utility model 459 patents, number of invention patents and utility model patents) to test the impact of CEPI on regional 460 pollutant emissions. The results in columns (1)-(3) in Table 12 demonstrate that CEPI significantly reduce 461 regional wastewater and exhaust emissions. The results in columns (4)-(6) show that CEPI significantly 462 increase the number of patent applications and grants in the region. The results show that the environmental 463 treatment effect of CEPI in the region is significant. 464\n466 VI. Conclusions 467 China's rapid economic development has also brought about many ecological and environmental 468 problems, and the enforcement effects of existing environmental policies still need further evaluation. In 469\nthis paper, we use the environmental policy of CEPI as a quasi-natural experiment and combine data from 470 listed companies in polluting industries. From the perspective of environmental information disclosure, we 471 use difference in difference estimation to examine whether CEPI mitigate firms\u2019 stock price crash risk by 472 reducing the hoarding of negative information. 473 This paper finds that CEPI reduce the firms\u2019 stock price crash risk in polluting industries in the region 474 compared to non-inspector regions. The disclosure effect of CEPI is mainly found in the sample of private 475 firms, firms with lower information transparency and disclosure quality, and firms in non-national civilized 476 cities and regions with stronger incentives for officials to be promoted. This may be due to the fact that 477 CEPI enhance the disclosure of negative environmental information in such samples, which inhibits the 478 hoarding of negative information and thus reduces the stock price crash risk. CEPI mainly reduce the firms\u2019 479 stock price crash risk in polluting industries by reducing the stock price bubble. Among the batches of CEPI, 480 the second, third and fourth batches had better information disclosure effects, and the effect of each batch 481 of inspectors gradually deepened. CEPI differ in the effectiveness of water pollution and air pollution 482 treatment. CEPI increased the long-term treatment investment and short-term emission reduction effect of 483 polluting industry enterprises in air pollution treatment, and the effect of inspectors in water pollution 484 treatment was not significant. 485 This paper examines the enforcement effectiveness of CEPI from the perspective of environmental 486 information disclosure, using CEPI as a quasi-natural experiment. It not only helps to clarify the 487 effectiveness of environmental governance after the enactment of environmental policies, but also extends 488\nthe research on CEPI. It also deepens the regulators\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the linkages between 489 the central government, local governments, and local enterprises. And thus, has important practical 490 implications for the promulgation and implementation of environmental policies. 491 492 Ethics approval 493 Not applicable. 494 Consent to participate 495 Not applicable. 496 Consent to Publish 497 Not applicable. 498 Authors Contributions 499 Mengyao Wen designed the experimental protocol, carried out the experiments, wrote the manuscript, 500 revised the manuscript, read and approved the manuscript. 501 Funding 502 Not applicable. 503 Competing Interests 504 The authors declare no competing interests. 505 Availability of data and materials 506 Not applicable. 507\nReferences 508 Andreou, P.
