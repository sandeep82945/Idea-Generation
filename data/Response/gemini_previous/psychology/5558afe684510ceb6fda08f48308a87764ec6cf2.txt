1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2).** This could be done by synthesizing a series of analogs of 1 and 2 with different functional groups and substitutions and testing their cytotoxic activity against A549 and L. major cells. This information could be used to design more potent and selective analogs of 1 and 2.
2. **Explore the mechanism of action of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2).** This could be done by investigating the cellular and biochemical effects of 1 and 2 on A549 and L. major cells. For example, one could study the effects of 1 and 2 on cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and gene expression. This information could provide valuable mechanistic data on the mode of action of 1 and 2.
3. **Evaluate the potential of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) as lead structures for the development of new anticancer and antiparasitic agents.** This could be done by testing the activity of 1 and 2 against a panel of cancer cell lines and protozoan parasites. One could also study the efficacy of 1 and 2 in animal models of cancer and parasitic infection. This information would help to determine the potential of 1 and 2 as lead structures for the development of new drugs.
4. **Investigate the potential of 6-O-caffeyl scopolin (3) as a lead structure for the development of new anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents.** This could be done by testing the activity of 3 against a panel of inflammatory and oxidative stress models. One could also study the efficacy of 3 in animal models of inflammation and oxidative stress. This information would help to determine the potential of 3 as a lead structure for the development of new drugs.
5. **Explore the potential of the known isolated (4-21) as lead structures for the development of new drugs.** This could be done by testing the activity of 4-21 against a panel of cancer cell lines, protozoan parasites, inflammatory and oxidative stress models. One could also study the efficacy of 4-21 in animal models of cancer, parasitic infection, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This information would help to determine the potential of 4-21 as lead structures for the development of new drugs.
