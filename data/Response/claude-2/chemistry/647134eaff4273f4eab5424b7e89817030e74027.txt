 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Apply the Bind&Bite method to modify other proteins besides HIV-1 envelope, to demonstrate broad applicability. Proteins like antibodies, enzymes, or signaling proteins would be interesting targets.

2. Optimize the reaction conditions (pH, temperature, etc) to increase the yield and kinetics of the isopeptide bond formation between the coiled-coil peptides. This could make the method faster and more efficient. 

3. Explore the use of different amino acid reactive sites besides squaramide to broaden the types of chemical modifications that can be attached using this method. Groups like azides, alkynes, tetrazines could enable bioorthogonal click chemistries.

4. Develop orthogonal Bind&Bite systems with additional pairs of mutually selective coiled-coil peptides. This would allow site-specific dual labeling of proteins or simultaneous labeling of multiple proteins.

5. Investigate performing the Bind&Bite reaction intracellularly, by optimizing the stability and reactivity of the reactive amino acid site. This could enable protein labeling applications inside living cells.
