1. **Investigate the long-term effectiveness of virtual PIECES in addressing responsive behaviors among older adults in LTC.** This could involve conducting a longitudinal study to track the outcomes of older adults who received virtual PIECES compared to those who received usual care. Researchers could examine changes in responsive behaviors, quality of life, and other relevant outcomes over time.


2. **Explore the impact of virtual PIECES on the well-being of family/care partners of older adults in LTC.** This could involve conducting qualitative interviews or surveys with family/care partners to understand their experiences with virtual PIECES and how it has affected their well-being. Researchers could explore themes such as perceived burden, satisfaction with care, and sense of involvement in care.


3. **Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of virtual PIECES compared to usual care for older adults in LTC.** This could involve conducting a cost-benefit analysis to compare the costs of implementing virtual PIECES with the benefits it provides, such as reduced hospitalizations, improved quality of life, and decreased caregiver burden.


4. **Examine the feasibility and acceptability of virtual PIECES in different LTC settings.** This could involve conducting studies in LTC homes with different sizes, locations, and resident populations. Researchers could explore factors that influence the feasibility and acceptability of virtual PIECES, such as staff training, technological infrastructure, and family/care partner engagement.


5. **Develop and evaluate interventions to improve the use of technology for family engagement in LTC.** This could involve developing and testing educational programs, resources, or tools to help LTC staff and family/care partners learn how to use technology to communicate and collaborate with each other. Researchers could evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing family engagement and improving the quality of care for older adults in LTC.
