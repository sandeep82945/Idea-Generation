Introduction\nIn recent years, multicomponent crystals containing a chiral pharmaceutical agent and coformers have provided new opportunities for tuning the physicochemical properties of crystalline materials (Jiang et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2019) and for chiral resolution in pharmaceuticals (Guillot et al., 2020). Chiral compounds generally crystallize into three forms: racemic compounds, conglomerates and solid solutions. More than 95% of chiral compounds crystallize as racemic compounds, roughly 5% exist as conglomerates, and rarely (less than 1%) crystallize as solid solutions (Harfouche et al., 2019; Rekis, 2020). Only 25 structures of chiral solid solutions have been reported to date (Rekis et al., 2018). Despite their rare formation in chiral compounds, solid solutions appear to be prevalent in multicomponent crystals, in which the chiral\ndiscrimination or enantioselectivity may be altered byPublished under a CC BY 4.0 licence\ncoformer selection (Scowen et al., 2020; Bia\u0142on\u0301ska & Ciunik, 2013). Few attempts employed this strategy to intentionally design structures that avoid enantioselectivity in the solid state (Fris\u030cc\u030cic\u0301 et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2010; Czapik et al., 2019; Diniz et al., 2019). However, the modulation role of the coformer on chiral discrimination or enantioselectivity in multicomponent crystals remains elusive.\nMany efforts have been devoted to establishing the relationship between mixed crystals and molecular conformations (Brandel et al., 2013; Scowen et al., 2020). From a structural point of view, two types of solid solutions have been suggested in the literature (Chion et al., 1978). Type I chiral solid solution describes the case where two enantiomers are arbitrarily distributed in the crystal [type I and type II solid solutions suggested by Chion et al. (1978); see below Scheme 1(a)]. These structures appear to be disordered, with both enantiomers superimposed in asymmetric units; moreover, their occupancy corresponds to the composition of the enantiomers. In a type II chiral solid solution, the crystal structure of the racemic composition is completely ordered. Solid solutions are formed due to the substitution of minor enantiomers by excess enantiomers of essentially the same structure in the nonracemic component.\nHowever, the molecular positions in some solid solutions (Rekis et al., 2018; Vogt et al., 2010; Heidi Lopez De Diego et al., 2011; Esteves De Castro et al., 2007) of racemic composition are somewhat enantioselective in the formation of racemic components, which are neither completely disordered like in type I, nor completely ordered like in type II. A revised classification criterion [type 1 and type 2 solid solutions; see Scheme 1(b)] was proposed by Rekis et al. (2018). The molecular structural features of type 1 solid solutions, e.g. thiocamphor (Vogt et al., 2010; Heidi Lopez De Diego et al., 2011) and pyrrolidone derivatives (Esteves De Castro et al., 2007), were further elucidated based on type I. There is a statistical mirror plane intersecting the molecule [Scheme 1(b)] which thus generates the opposite enantiomer within the same molecular site. The single enantiomeric crystal of such solid solutions has an asymmetric unit molecule number Z0 = 1, whereas the crystal structure with racemic components has an asymmetric unit molecule number Z0 = 0.5. However, in type 2 solid solutions (Esteves De Castro et al., 2007, Rekis et al.; 2018; Baert et al., 1978; Kroon et al., 1976; Rekis & d\u2019Agostino et al., 2017; Rekis & Be rzin\u0327s\u030c et al., 2018), the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit of a single enantiomer crystal is often even, and molecular conformational adjustment allows a reasonable pseudo-inversion center between two or an even number of molecular conformations in the asymmetric unit. This enantiopure structure mimics a centrosymmetric one by adjusting the molecular conformations so a reasonable pseudo-centrosymmetry might be attained between RI and RII. When some amount of the opposite enantiomer S is introduced, it can adopt conformation I and occupy the former RII sites in the crystal structure. Thus, locally there is genuine centrosymmetry between RI and SI present.\nDMY is the main flavanol compound isolated from a traditional Chinese medicine ampelopsis grossedentata, which shows hepatoprotective, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive effects (Liu et al., 2019). DMY has two chiral centers and thus has four potential enantiomers (Lin et al., 2019). Note that Rac-DMY crystallizes as a racemic compound containing R,R-DMY and S,S-DMY in the asymmetric unit (Xu et al., 2007), nonetheless, homochiral R,RDMY showed higher anti-inflammatory activity than RacDMY (Wang et al., 2016). In this work, we used DMY as a chiral model substance to examine the role of the molecular structure of the coformer on chiral discrimination in multicomponent crystals from the perspectives of crystal structure, thermodynamics and intermolecular interactions. Two cocrystal coformers, caffeine (CAF) and theophylline (THE), were selected with a subtle difference in molecular structure. The crystal structures of R,R-DMY\u2013THE, Rac-DMY\u2013THE, R,R-DMY\u2013CAF and Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal solvates are, to our knowledge, reported for the first time, revealing the two types of solid solutions constituting chiral cocrystals that display several orders of magnitude mixing performance of two enantiomers within the crystals. The distinct enantioselectivity difference in the two chiral cocrystal systems can be attributed to the hydrogen-bonding donor\u2013acceptor capacity of the coformers."

The hydrogen atom at each chiral carbon position is located on the same side of the coplane of\nthe A and C rings. The structural characteristics produce a total of four potential enantiomers in which S,S-DMY and R,R-DMY are the dominant enantiomers in solution and crystallize to be Rac-DMY dihydrate from aqueous solution (Wang et al., 2016).\nThe suspension crystallization of Rac-DMY or R,R-DMY with CAF powders in acetonitrile results in the formation of a new phase. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the PXRD pattern of RacDMY\u2013CAF displays several characteristic peaks located at 6.5, 7.4, 7.8, 12.3, 13.0 and 13.7 , differing from that of DMY or CAF crystals. Further, the experimental PXRD pattern matches well with the calculated one derived from the solved crystal structure (Fig. S1 in supporting information). These results corroborate the formation of the Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal. Besides, the characteristic peaks of the R,R-DMY\u2013 CAF phase are identical to those of Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystals, indicating the formation of either a conglomerate of enantiomorph cocrystals or a chiral solid solution.\nIn contrast to CAF, the structure of THE coformer only lacks a methyl group on the five-membered ring, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This structural nuance was previously used to probe the chiral discrimination in cocrystal formation (Fris\u030cc\u030cic\u0301 et al., 2006). Here, we observed that R,R-DMY\u2013THE and RacDMY\u2013THE exhibit identical PXRD patterns that are different from the DMY or THE samples [Fig. 2(b)], suggesting the formation of a new crystalline phase. PXRD patterns of these samples are identical to the calculated ones simulated from the solved crystal structure (Fig. S2), corroborating the formation of R,R-DMY\u2013THE and Rac-DMY\u2013 THE cocrystals."

Enantioselectivity of chiral dihydromyricetin 167\nto differentiate conglomerates or solid solutions of enantiomorph cocrystals. Single crystals of sufficient size and mass were grown from acetonitrile solution to perform SCXRD analysis. Owing to the presence of compositional disorder of the racemic component (i.e. solid solution), Ga K radiation was employed to collect crystallographic data of Rac-DMY\u2013 CAF and R,R-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystals. The high density of disorder/defects in the crystal structure may result from the wrong sites occupied by enantiomers in the structure, generating high R1 values (Table 1).\nThe Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n. The asymmetric unit is composed of equimolar amounts of DMY, CAF and acetonitrile, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The analyses of the anisotropic shift ellipsoid and the differential electron density map confirm the inclusion of a disordering coformer in the crystal structure and the proportion of disorder confirmed is 0.43\u20130.57. We thus conclude that Rac-DMY\u2013CAF does not belong to the typical racemic compound crystallizing system.\nAs shown in Fig. 4(a), two types of intermolecular hydrogen bonds are observed in the crystal structure: an O\u2014H O\u2014H hydrogen bond is formed between hydroxyl groups of DMY molecules, and an O\u2014H O C hydrogen bond is formed between the hydroxyl group of the DMY molecule and the carbonyl group of the CAF molecule. DMY and CAF form long zigzag chains that constitute alternating layers perpendicular to the b axis [Fig. 4(b)]. In each layer, the hydroxyl group on the DMY chiral C center passes through the O\u2014\nH O C hydrogen bond (2.635, 1.90, : 144.8) with the carbonyl group of CAF (green arrow), and the hydroxyl group of DMY resorcinol connects with another carbonyl group of CAF via an O\u2014H O C hydrogen bond (2.652, 2.29, :\n168 Jie Sun et al. Enantioselectivity of chiral dihydromyricetin IUCrJ (2023). 10, 164\u2013176\n\u2020 Z0 is often defined as the number of formula units in the crystallographic unit cell divided by the number of independent general positions, but in this work Z0 = 1 represents only one set of THE, DMY and acetonitrile molecules in the asymmetric unit. The total number of chemical entities in the asymmetric unit has been referred to as Z00 by van Eijck & Kroon (2000).\n106.0). In the perpendicular direction (orange arrow), the hydroxyl group of DMY resorcinol links to the adjacent catechol of DMY via an O\u2014H H\u2014O hydrogen bond (2.769, 2.15, : 133.0). These layers were stacked by an O\u2014H N hydrogen bond (2.716,1.90, : 164.1) to form a 3D network with acetonitrile molecules included in the channel. Detailed data on hydrogen bonding interactions are shown in Table S2. The single crystal of the Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal obtained through the slow volatilization of the solvent contains a disordering coformer with a proportion of 0.57. However, the crystal structure is largely (but not completely) an ordered arrangement in terms of enantiomer layout.\nIn previous studies, it was suggested that the functional groups near the chiral center do not participate in hydrogen bonding interactions in the crystal structure of the solid solution forming system, to assure the replacement of the conformation of the enantiomer (Rekis & d\u2019Agostino et al., 2017; Rekis et al., 2017). But in this case, we observed the direct formation of hydrogen bonding interactions of the hydroxyl group or ophthalmic triol group of DMY at the chiral carbon center with adjacent molecules. Interestingly, this packing arrangement will not be altered when enantiomer replacement occurs within the crystal structure, leading to the formation of Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal solid solution.\nThe R,R-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the asymmetric unit of R,R-DMY\u2013CAF contains two sets of equimolar DMY, CAF and acetonitrile molecules. The anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) do not show any disorder in the R,RDMY\u2013CAF crystal structure. In general, the rigidity and\nstable stacking of molecules limit the possibility of molecular disorder encountered in solid solutions. The packing arrangments of the R,R-DMY\u2013CAF and Rac-DMY\u2013CAF cocrystals are almost identical, which explains their similar PXRD patterns [Fig. 2(a)].\nThe determination of the space group P21 in the crystal structure of R,R-DMY\u2013CAF rather than P21/n is based on R1 and Rint values. Electron statistical analysis suggests the presence of centrosymmetric space groups which can be explained by the pseudosymmetry of the crystal structure, illustrated in Fig. 5. The true centrosymmetry of the racemic composition can be achieved by the pairs SI\u2013RI or SII\u2013RII. For enantiomerically pure samples, two groups of molecules with homochirality can adjust the conformation to form a centrosymmetric pair, so that the formation of a quasicentrosymmetric structure is also able to host the opposite enantiomer when the scalar composition phase was considered. The requirement for a solid solution is that the two (or another even number of) enantiomeric molecules in the asymmetric unit mirror are approximately mirror images of each other. The crystal structure of the DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal meets all structural prerequisites to be the type 2 solid solution; moreover, the crystal structure of R,R-DMY\u2013CAF is similar to that of Rac-DMY\u2013CAF (see Fig. 3). The structural origin of such type of solid solution formation could be presumably due to non-racemic mixtures forming quasicentrosymmetric structures, in which the number of missing enantiomers is compensated by the adoption of enriched enantiomers in a conformation similar to that of the minority enantiomer. This phenomenon can be referred to as shape\nIUCrJ (2023). 10, 164\u2013176 Jie Sun et al. Enantioselectivity of chiral dihydromyricetin 169\nmimicry (Fayzullin et al., 2017). Thus, the enantiomerically pure and racemic structures are isomeric, and continuous changes in their enantiomeric composition may form identical isomeric stacks. For conformationally flexible molecules, the stability of the crystal structure usually depends on a subtle compromise between the intermolecular interaction energy and the stacking efficiency. Overall, the DMY\u2013CAF cocrystal system conforms to the crystallographically pseudo-centrosymmetric mixed-phase structure of typical type 2 solid solutions as classified by Rekis & Be rzin\u0327s\u030c (2018). 3.2.2. Rac-DMY\u2013THE and R,R-DMY\u2013THE cocrystals. The SCXRD data of R,R-DMY\u2013THE were collected using Mo K radiation, and the conformation of R,R-DMY was determined by chiral HPLC as its chiral conformation remains stable during the formation of cocrystals (Wang et al., 2016). The R,R-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal system with the space group P212121, and the crystallographic data are shown in Table 2. The asymmetric unit of the cocrystal consists of THE, R,R-DMY and acetonitrile in the molar ratio 1:1:1, and there is no disorder in the crystal structure.\nIn the crystal structure, R,R-DMY interacts with two THE molecules by forming O\u2014H N and O\u2014H O hydrogen bonds, where one THE molecule interacts with R,R-DMY via O\u2014H N (2.764, 1.95, : 162.7), and the other THE also forms hydrogen bonds with the second R,R-DMY via O\u2014 H O (2.720, 2.00, : 142.6) and N\u2014H O (2.738, 1.97, : 145.3), forming channels in the crystal structure to accommodate the acetonitrile guest molecule [Fig. 6(a)]. The adjacent R,R-DMY molecules interact with each other by forming O\u2014H O hydrogen bonds (2.7203, 1.9, : 156.1; 2.834, 2.27, : 125.1) between pyrogallol rings along the a direction and between the pyrogallol ring (B ring) and resorcinol ring (A ring) along the c direction [Fig. 6(b)], which results in a 3D host network [Fig. 6(c)]. The acetonitrile guest molecule is included within the host network through weak C\u2014H N hydrogen bonding interactions. Detailed hydrogen bonding interaction data are shown in Table S3. Unlike the structure of the R,R-DMY\u2013CAF co-crystal, the asymmetric unit of the R,R-DMY\u2013THE co-crystal has only one set of THE, R,RDMY and acetonitrile molecules and does not form another set of conformational molecules to mimic the conformations\n170 Jie Sun et al.

Therefore, it does not conform to the typical crystallographic pseudo-centrosymmetric mixed-phase structural features of type 2 solid solutions.\nSingle crystals of the Rac-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal were obtained by slow volatilization from a 1:1 solution of the racemic composition of DMY and THE in acetonitrile. Single crystals of suitable size and relatively good quality were\nselected, and crystallographic data were collected using a Cu target to receive information on reliable chiral conformations. Single-crystal structure determination shows that both enantiomers crystallized in the orthorhombic Sohncke space group P212121. The asymmetric units contain equimolar amounts of THE, DMY and acetonitrile (Fig. 7). Crystal packing analysis reveals the identical molecular conformation and packing arrangements between Rac-DMY\u2013THE-1 (or Rac-DMY\u2013 THE-2) (Table 2) and R,R-DMY\u2013THE cocrystals. This likely indicates that the Rac-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal is a conglomerate, but the analyses of anisotropic shift ellipsoids and differential electron density maps show the presence of disordered molecules. To demonstrate the lack of enantioselectivity in the solid state, the structure of the third scalar crystal (ScalemicDMY\u2013THE-3) was also determined, unveiling the disordered nature of scalemic crystals. The Flack values of Rac-DMY\u2013 THE-1 and Rac-DMY\u2013THE-2 cocrystals are equal to 0.49(0.04) and 0.54(0.03), respectively, which, given plausible uncertainties, indicate that single crystals grown in saturated solutions of racemization are racemic twins, with domains of opposite absolute structure, statistically mosaic in the same crystal. The ratio of two absolute structured crystal domains can be determined by the Flack value. The disorder percentages in Rac-DMY\u2013THE-1 and Rac-DMY\u2013THE-2 cocrystals are 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. In each case (as long as the phases are assumed to be thermodynamically equilibrated), the exact degree of disorder should be related to the conformational entropy, which is determined by several isoenergetic local structure models. Disorder in crystal structures of other types of molecules has been explained and is thought to be controlled by Boltzmann statistics (Rekis, 2019). The degree of disorder and the conformational ratio or molecular positional enantioselectivity should be directly related to the energetic aspects of the intermolecular interactions (Zhang et al., 2017; Vogt et al., 2010b). The Flack value for ScalemicDMY\u2013THE-3 is 0.4 with an R1 value of 3.55%, but the uncertainty of 0.3 is too large. The lattice parameters and molecular volumes of the cocrystals are shown in Table 2. There is no significant enantiomeric composition-dependent variation in the cell parameters, unit-cell volume and crystal density. The cell parameters (i.e. a, b and c) of the racemic samples are slightly increased compared with the enantiomerically pure crystals, which implies a slight expansion of the cell volume because of the disorder, although the experimental temperature may increase the cell parameters. We thus concluded that either the racemic or the enantiomerically pure sample of the DMY\u2013THE cocrystal can form a uniformly stacked crystal structure without crystallization into a true conglomerate. Furthermore, the Rac-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal does not belong to the type 1 solid solution, which requires the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit of the racemate crystal to be half that of a single enantiomer crystal (Rekis & Be rzin\u0327s\u030c, 2018)."

            "text": "Racemic twins that crystallize in the Sohncke space group are a different type of conglomerate in which each crystal\nIUCrJ (2023). 10, 164\u2013176 Jie Sun et al. Enantioselectivity of chiral dihydromyricetin 171\ncontains two enantiomers in separate structural domains, each containing only one of the two enantiomers. There are several reports of epitaxially grown conglomerates that can display racemic composition (Kaptein et al., 2008; Davey et al., 2014; Spix et al., 2014). In solid solution, although the two enantiomers are present in equal numbers, they are randomly distributed in the structure (irregular enantiomeric arrangement) and have no longevity. Solid solutions can crystallize in non-Sohncke or Sohncke space groups. Because of different scales of enantiomeric distribution, we explored the thermodynamic characteristics of racemic twinned crystals of the RacDMY\u2013THE cocrystal in this section.\n3.3.1. Pseudo-binary melt phase diagram of Rac-DMY\u2013 THE cocrystals. A series of DMY\u2013THE cocrystals composed\nof different chiral DMY enantiomers were prepared for DSC analysis. As shown in Fig. 8(a), there is no weight loss observed in cocrystal samples until about 180 C. This is further confirmed by temperature-variant hot-stage microscopy presented in Figs. S3\u2013S4 of the supporting information. The observed endothermic peak around 140\u2013150 C can be attributed to the melting of cocrystal samples. The onset temperature is considered to be the melting point of the samples, and the measured data are given in Table S1 of the supporting information. We found that each cocrystal mixture, regardless of enantiomeric composition, has only one broad endothermic peak, indicative of chiral solid solutions. Further, the melting point decreases monotonically with the increase of S,S-DMY in the cocrystal with the maximum at 150.29 C for\n172 Jie Sun et al. Enantioselectivity of chiral dihydromyricetin IUCrJ (2023). 10, 164\u2013176\nthe 96.32%ee DMY\u2013THE cocrystal mixtures and the minimum at 141.31 C for the 0.84%ee DMY\u2013THE sample. These measured melting point data can be used to construct a Pseudo-binary melt phase diagram [Fig. 8(b)]. The Rac-DMY\u2013 THE cocrystal is a continuous solid solution exhibiting the lowest melting point at the racemic composition.\n3.3.2. Pseudo-ternary solution phase diagram of RacDMY\u2013THE cocrystals. Solution ternary phase diagrams are useful for distinguishing the crystalline form of a chiral compound and can provide the most basic and reliable data for chiral resolution (Srisanga & Horst, 2010). The solubility data of a series of DMY\u2013THE cocrystal mixtures composed of different enantiomeric compositions in acetonitrile were measured at 25, 35 and 40 C. Solid\u2013liquid phase equilibrium experiments were performed, and the concentration of the clear supernatant was measured with an interval of 24 h by chiral HPLC to determine the solubility of the DMY\u2013THE cocrystal mixtures of different enantiomeric compositions. The solid phase was subjected to PXRD analysis to rule out any phase transformation throughout the experiments. We found that the pseudo-ternary phase diagram reaches an equilibrium state after 120 h. Fig. 9 shows the established pseudo-ternary phase diagram, and the colored lines represent the solid\u2013liquid equilibrium lines at different temperatures. The solubility of DMY\u2013THE cocrystals increases with the rise in temperature and the decreases of R,R-DMY enantiomer in the solid phase. The solubility curves conform to the shape of a type of continuous solid solution, which is consistent with the results of the pseudo-binary melt phase diagram that displays a downward-concave shape. When the enantiomer system crystallized as a conglomerate or lamellar conglomerates (van Enckevort, 2010; Zlokazov & Pivnitsky, 2020), the solubility of the crystal mixtures composed of equimolar enantiomers should be twice the solubility of the single enantiomer crystal, conforming to the \u2018Meyerhoffer\u2019 double solubility rule (Izumi & Blackmond, 2009). The colored hollow squares represent\nthe eutectic point when the solubility of the racemic co-crystal is twice the solubility of an enantiomeric co-crystal. However, a closer look at the lowest point of the curve shows that the measured solubility of the DMY\u2013THE cocrystals composed of equimolar enantiomers is much smaller than the expected value of the double solubility curve. An epitaxial lamellar conglomerate or multilayered conglomerate displaying single enantiomeric crystals crystallized in a chiral space group but in different chiral compositions, even with no enantiomeric excess, has been reported in the literature and is similar to our case. By combining the determined binary melt phase diagram and the ternary solution phase diagram, the chiral DMY\u2013THE cocrystal system is considered to be a type of continuous solid solution.\n3.3.3. Selective dissolution of enantiomers. We further employed selective dissolution experiments to understand the mixing scale of enantiomeric cocrystals in a solid solution of DMY\u2013THE, which is not suggested on the whole crystal scale nor on the molecular scale. The selective dissolution experiments were previously used in epitaxially grown conglomerate-forming systems to probe the distribution of enantiomeric domains in the crystal (Kaptein et al., 2008; van Eupen et al., 2008). When the Rac-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal was placed in a saturated enantiomerically pure solution, we observed the enantioselective dissolution of crystal fragments under an optical microscope (Fig. 10), which suggests the presence of enantiomeric crystal domains. The Rac-DMY\u2013 THE cocrystal is composed of many R,R and S,S enantiomeric domains but displays near-racemic domains. Moreover, a small flake was peeled off the crystal of the racemate by the needle and measured by chiral HPLC which shows an enantiomeric excess value of about 79.8% (Fig. S7) and thus confirms the spatial heterogeneity of enantiomer domains in the solid solution of the Rac-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal.\n3.3.4. Observation of racemic twins. The careful examination of the crystal morphology of the Rac-DMY\u2013THE\nIUCrJ (2023). 10, 164\u2013176 Jie Sun et al. Enantioselectivity of chiral dihydromyricetin 173\ncocrystal reveals the presence of a twinning boundary that separates the crystal into several domains (Fig. 11). These domains are ordered and stacked parallel to the identical crystallographic orientation. The facet indexing results clarify the mutually epitaxial twin boundary that appears on the {010} and {001} sets. The width of the twins is roughly 5\u201320 mm, which is comparable to the coherent spot size of the utilized single-crystal X-ray beam in this study ( 10 mm). The mixing behavior of enantiomer domains within the crystal is likely on the micrometre-scale, neither as a molecular disorder in the\nmolecular-scale mixing nor as an even large macroscopic crystal-scale mixing resemble that in the epitaxial conglomerate system.\nThe twin structure forms on the basal growing {010} and {001} surface, along the a axis, indicating a weaker interaction between the two enantiomers in the b and c directions. Fig. 6 suggests the rapid growth of DMY along the a axis is facilitated by strong hydrogen bonding interactions between ophenylene triols groups of the DMY molecule. The possible binding mode of the two enantiomeric molecules in RacDMY\u2013THE cocrystals was illustrated in Fig. 11(c), with the twin boundaries highlighted. In both enantiomerically pure and racemic crystal structures of DMY\u2013THE cocrystals, the THE and DMY molecules are linked by O\u2014H N and O\u2014 H O hydrogen bonds along the b direction; in the c direction, the resorcinol groups R,R-DMY and S,S-DMY are joined together via an O\u2014H O hydrogen bond [dark-blue dashed line in Fig. 11(d)]. These hydrogen bonding interactions may be key factors in the early stages of nucleation and growth of enantiomorph cocrystals that lead to the formation of twin boundaries. However, note that the micrometre-scale mixing of enantiomer domains formed by epitaxial crystallization on Rac-DMY\u2013THE cocrystals impedes the use of conventional chiral resolution methods, e.g. preferential crystallization."

In contrast, there is only one set of molecular conformations in the asymmetric unit for the Rac-DMY\u2013THE or R,R-DMY\u2013THE cocrystal solid solution system, and the composition of the racemates is achieved by mixing crystal domains of differing chirality."
