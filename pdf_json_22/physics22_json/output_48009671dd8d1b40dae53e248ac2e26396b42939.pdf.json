    "abstractText": "We analyse a model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups \u2013 people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.",

For some recent surveys of the literature, see e.g. [37, 7, 35]. Models of opinion dynamics can be classified along two dimensions: according to the opinion space, which is the set of possible opinions each agent in the model can hold, and by whether time is discrete or continuous. In the early days of the field, the 1980s and 90s, most models had discrete opinion spaces. Binary opinion spaces, with only two choices, have received particular attention, with [39] being an important article about such a model. One of the main contributions to binary opinion dynamics is the Galam model first introduced in [17]. Later on, continuous opinion spaces were introduced such as the so called bounded confidence models (e.g. [12]), the Friedkin-Johnsen model [15, 16], and the Hegselmann-Krause model [26]. These continuous models are similar to earlier models of opinion dynamics developed by social psychologists and mathematicians starting in the 1950s [3, 1, 13] that predate the entire field of sociophysics. The two traditions remained disconnected\n\u2217IIMAS-UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico, gabor.toth@iimas.unam.mx\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n13 60\n1v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. so\ncph\n] 2\n4 N\nov 2\nfor decades due to a lack of exchange between the different disciplines. More recently, an increasing number of mathematicians have been joining the field [31, 2, 5], adding to the multidisciplinary nature of the field.\nThe basic framework to study the dynamics of binary opinions consists of two alternatives A and B and a large population of N individuals, each of whom prefers one of the alternatives to the other. There is an initial proportion of the overall population p0 \u2208 [0, 1] in favour of A. The mathematical model can be interpreted in two different ways:\n1. As a model of voting in a hierarchy. The overall population of N individuals is arranged as a hierarchy \u2013 mathematically, a homogeneous rooted tree with branching factor r \u2208 N. Each group (which is a set of sibling leaves in the tree) within the bottom level is comprised of r individuals who vote for one of the options by the majority rule. This decision is carried to the next level of the hierarchy, where r representatives form a group that in turn votes on A versus B. Their decision is passed to the next level, etc. With this setup, the number of voters on the bottom level of a hierarchy with n \u2208 N levels and group size r is rn. This voting model was first introduced in [17].\n2. As a model of opinion dynamics. The overall population of N individuals meets in groups of fixed size r. A discussion takes place in each local group and the majority opinion is adopted by all members of the group. Next, the groups are broken up and the individuals randomly form new groups of size r to resume discussion. This is repeated n times. When studying the dynamics of the model, the number of discussion rounds n plays the same role as the number of levels in the hierarchy in the voting model.\nThe initial proportion p0 in favour of A is updated after the first round of discussions to p1 \u2208 [0, 1], the proportion of the population in favour of A after the first round has taken place and the local majority has been adopted in each group. If the local discussion groups are of even size, we flip a coin to decide which alternative is adopted in case of a tie. After a large number n of discussions, the proportion pn tends to a limit in [0, 1]. The limit depends on the initial proportion p0: if p0 < 1/2, then pn tends to 0, i.e. a unanimous majority in favour of B. Similarly, if p0 > 1/2, then pn tends to a unanimous majority favouring A. In case of an initial tie p0 = 1/2, the tie remains for all time with neither alternative winning out.\nThese very simple dynamics of the basic model change if we assume some type of contrarianism on the part of the individuals. In the opinion dynamics interpretation of the model, each individual of the local group of r individuals decides independently whether to go along with the local majority prevailing in the group. In the hierarchical voting interpretation, the representative presiding the group decides whether to accept the majority vote or to go against it and report the contrary opinion to the next level. The impact of contrarians was first studied in [18, 19]. There is also a version of \u2018global\u2019 contrarianism [6], which takes into account the global rather than the local group majority. Other authors have also studied the phenomenon of contrarianism, e.g. [40, 4, 24, 32, 25].\nA number of problems have been studied over the course of the last decades using the general setup of the basic model with suitable modifications. The models can be employed by plugging an initial proportion into the model and calculating the limit of pn as n goes to infinity. Versions of this model have been used in an attempt to predict election results, such as the French rejection of the European constitution in 2005 [33], the Brexit vote [22], Trump\u2019s election for president in 2016 [21], as well as the U.S. presidential election in 2020 [23].\nIn [42], a local flip model was introduced with flips against the majority where the likelihood of the flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. This model allows us to study scenarios where individuals are guided by the opinions of the others in their local groups \u2013 albeit not necessarily in a positive sense. It could be the case that small majorities are not particularly persuasive: individuals may not accept such close\noutcomes as sufficiently authoritative. Or it could be that particularly large, close to unanimous, majorities are distasteful to some individuals and induce resistance to the majority decision. These two scenarios were called the \u2018vertical\u2019 and \u2018horizontal frame\u2019, respectively, in [42]. These are aspects which could not be explored using previous models of binary opinion dynamics, and they shed some new light on several social phenomena triggered by one or a few individuals acting against larger local majorities.\nLet r \u2208 N be the size of the local discussion groups. Given a current proportion p \u2208 [0, 1] of the overall population favouring alternative A, the proportion in favour after the next round of discussions is given by the update function. The general update function of the local flip model is\nRr,a (p) = r\u2211 i= r+12 ( r i )[ (1\u2212 ai) pi (1\u2212 p)r\u2212i + aipr\u2212i (1\u2212 p)i ] . (1)\nThe vector a = ( a r+1\n2 , . . . , ar\n) contains all the flip parameters of the model. The parameter ai gives the\nprobability that the majority is not adopted given that the majority is of size i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r }\n. When i voters are in favour of A, and we encode each of these votes as a +1 and each vote for B as a \u22121, the sum of all votes, called the voting margin, is S = i\u2212 (r \u2212 i) = 2i\u2212 r. The model is symmetric in that a flip against the local majority is equally likely no matter the alternative the majority favours. Thus, the flip parameters are chosen in such a way that they only depend on the absolute voting margin |S| = |2i\u2212 r| but not the sign of S. This symmetry implies that the point p = 1/2, which signifies a tie between the two alternatives, is a universal fixed point in the dynamics of the model. The local flip model is the most general model of binary opinion dynamics with random deviations from the majority that is symmetric with respect to the two alternatives.\nTo make the local flip model more accessible than the mere statement of the general update function accomplishes, we describe the simplest case where the local discussion groups are of size 3. Then the model has only two flip parameters: a2 is the probability that a flip against the group majority takes place conditional on there being a 2-1 majority, and a3 is the probability of a flip if there is a unanimous majority. Table 1 describes the process by which the opinions of the members of a local discussion group are updated after discussion ends. This table was included in [42] as Table 5. The information is read as follows: in the first two rows of the table, we have a unanimous configuration of opinions in favour of A in the local discussion group. The probability that a randomly selected local discussion group of size 3 has the configuration AAA, given that there is a proportion p of the overall population in favour of A, is p3. In the basic model, the majority would be adopted. However, in the local flip model, there is a probability that this unanimous majority is not adopted given by a3 \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, we obtain a probability of a group vote in favour of A given by (1\u2212 a3) p3 and a probability of going for B given by the complementary a3p3. The updated overall proportion of individuals in favour of A, R3,a (p), is obtained by summing the probabilities in the rows where A is adopted.\nThe aforementioned basic model and the contrarian model introduced in [18, 19] are both special cases of the local flip model. The basic model corresponds to the assumption a = 0, meaning there are no flips against the majority under any circumstances. The contrarian model features flat flip probabilities a = (a, . . . , a) for some a \u2208 [0, 1]. Both of these models, being special cases of the local flip model, share the universal fixed point p = 1/2. The basic model also has the fixed points 0 and 1. These features lead to the convergence to unanimous majorities in the basic model described above.\nInstead of assuming some fixed vector of flip parameters a as in [42] and analysing the properties of the model under that assumption, we investigate in this article how likely some of the features of the model are\nwhen the parameters are randomly selected. Therefore, in this article, a is a random vector that follows some probability distribution. As a consequence, features of the model, such as the stability parameter\n\u03bbr (a) := R \u2032 r,a (1/2) =\n1\n2r\u22121 r\u2211 i= r+12 ( r i ) (2i\u2212 r) (1\u2212 2ai) (2)\nof the universal fixed point 1/2, will also be random variables. Other features, such as the presence of unanimous attractors will be events of the probability space on which a is defined. Hence, it makes sense to ask ourselves the question of how likely these events are, or how likely it is that the universal fixed point 1/2 is stable.\nThere are two possible interpretations of random flip parameters:\n1. Different issues to be discussed induce tendencies to adopt the majority opinion or to resist it. In some cases, there may be a strong tendency to align with the majority, and the flip parameters will be close to 0. Other issues may trigger strong resistance against the majority opinion, e.g. if the members of the majority are perceived to be very arrogant or intolerant of divergent opinions. We consider that for each possible issue there is some realisation of the flip parameters a that affects the dynamics of the model. Thus, if we study the local flip model with random flip parameters, we gain a big picture understanding of how discussions take place and opinions are shaped averaged over a large number of possible discussion topics.\n2. We can also consider the mathematical question of what the \u2018typical model\u2019 looks like. We know that the model exhibits a variety of features, such as different numbers of fixed points with differing stability properties, depending on the flip parameters, but how likely are these different properties to occur? It may turn out that some features \u2013 although possible for special values of the flip parameters \u2013 are exceedingly unlikely to occur under random flip parameters. In that case, these features are more of\ntheoretical than practical interest. To make this distinction is especially important given the great generality of the local flip model, which leads to an \u2018anything goes\u2019 situation.\nThis article is organised in four sections and an appendix. After this introduction, Section 2 analyses features of the local flip model with random flip parameters when the local discussion groups are small. This setting allows us to assume a specific distribution of the flip parameters and calculate the probability that the model has certain characteristics explicitly. Afterwards, in Section 3, we analyse properties of the local flip model with random flip parameters when the discussion groups are large. Section 4 presents the conclusions we have reached. Finally, the Appendix contains the proofs of the theorems presented in the article."

            "text": "We first look at the model with local discussion groups of size r = 3. See Table 1 and Section 4.1 of [42] for an analysis of this model. This model features two flip parameters: we have a2 which is the flip parameter when there is a 2-1 majority in favour of one of the alternatives; equivalently, the absolute voting margin |S| is equal to 1. The other flip parameter, a3, describes the probability of disregarding a unanimous 3-0 majority. We will use the notation a2 = a and a3 = b as in [42] and assume a uniform distribution, i.e. the random vector (a, b) is uniformly distributed on the set [0, 1] 2 , which we write as (a, b) \u223c U [0, 1]2.\nIn order to determine the behaviour of the model for different values of the flip parameters a and b, the stability of the universal fixed point 1/2 is calculated. There are four different regions in the parameter space of this model [0, 1] 2\nwith differing stability properties: in the region L given by the inequality b < 1/3 \u2212 a, 1/2 is unstable and the dynamics are monotonically away from 1/2. The stable region M1 with monotonic dynamics is given by the inequalities 1/3 \u2212 a < b < 1 \u2212 a. The other stable region M2 with alternating dynamics is delimited by the inequalities 1 \u2212 a < b < 5/3 \u2212 a. Finally, there is an unstable region H with alternating dynamics which lies above b = 5/3\u2212 a. A graphical representation of these results can be found in Figure 1, which first appeared in [42] as Figure 1.\nHaving identified these regions, we can calculate the probability that the fixed point 1/2 is stable or unstable: P {1/2 is stable} = 8/9, P {1/2 is unstable} = 1/9. Under the uniform distribution U [0, 1]2, these probabilities are simply the areas of the respective regions in the parameter space [0, 1] 2 .\n1For any x \u2208 R, the Dirac distribution or point mass at x is defined as \u03b4xA := {\n1, if x \u2208 A 0, if x /\u2208 A for all subsets A of R.\nThe other aspect analysed in [42] was the number of fixed points. There are three regions: the region in which every value p \u2208 [0, 1] is a fixed point consists of a single point, F\u221e := {(1/3, 0)}. The region F1 with only a single fixed point which is 1/2 is given by the inequalities 1/3\u2212a \u2264 b and b > 0. The region with three different fixed points is the complement F3 := [0, 1]\n2 \\ (F\u221e \u222a F1), i.e. the corner region around the origin and the a-axis excluding the point: (1/3, 0).\nThus, the probabilities of the number of fixed points taking the values 1, 3, and \u221e are, respectively, P {there is 1 fixed point} = 17/18, P {there are 3 fixed points} = 1/18, and P {there are infinitely many fixed points} = 0. As shown in the appendix A.2 of [42], for any group size r the unanimous majority points 0 and 1 are fixed points if and only if ar = 0. Furthermore, in case 0 and 1 are fixed points, they are stable if and only if ar\u22121 \u2264 1/r. The event of having unanimous attractors for group size r = 3, i.e. the points 0 and 1 being fixed points and attractive, has probability 0: P {unanimous attractors} \u2264 P {ar = 0} = 0."

Each of these models has some constraint on the possible values of the flip parameters. Similarly to the discussion group size r = 3, we can conduct an analysis of the model\u2019s behaviour. See Section 4.2 of [42] for the precise results, which, due to length constraints on this article, we choose to omit. We present a graphical representation of the version of the model with c = 0, i.e. there are no flips against unanimous majorities, in Figure 2. This diagram first appeared as Figure 7 in [42].\nThe probabilities of a number of properties of four versions of local flip models analysed in Section 4.2 of [42] can be found in Table 2. These are exact figures with no rounding applied. Due to the uniform distribution we have assumed for the flip parameters, the probabilities presented in Table 2 are the areas of the corresponding regions in the parameter space of the respective version of the model. E.g., for the model with (a, b) \u223c U [0, 1]2 , c = 0 presented in the last column in Table 2, the probabilities can be calculated directly from the diagrams in Figure 2.\nAs we see, under uniform distribution of the flip parameters, there generally is a small number of fixed points. Specifically, the probability that a full complement of r fixed points exists is small for both r = 3 and r = 5, with the one exception of the distribution (a, b) \u223c U [0, 1]2 , c = 0. This exception is reached by setting the flip parameter for unanimous majorities to the only value that allows for unanimous attractors. This is thus not a typical result. In line with the generally small number of fixed points, the unanimous majorities are rarely attractive fixed points. This is thus a stable result even under randomly selected flip parameters which clearly distinguishes the local flip model from the basic Galam model of opinion dynamics, which features unanimous attractors for any local discussion group size.\nAs for the universal fixed point 1/2, we observe mostly stable fixed points. However, there are some exceptions when the right set of constraints is imposed on the flip parameters. For r = 3 and unrestricted flip parameters, we have a high probability of a stable fixed point 1/2. Similarly, for r = 5 and (a, b) \u223c U [0, 1]2 , c = 0, we have a stable fixed point. On the other hand, if we set both b and c equal to 0, i.e. we only allow flips when the majority is paper thin, an unstable fixed point 1/2 is more likely than a stable one.\nWe could try using a different distribution for the flip parameters to illustrate that these conclusions depend on the particular distribution chosen. Due to the somewhat arbitrary nature of such an undertaking, we choose instead to investigate the case of large update group sizes, which allows more robust conclusions which do not require assuming specific distributions to obtain results."

This probability is given by\nP {0, 1 stable and 0, 1 fixed} = P {ar\u22121 \u2264 1/r and ar = 0} .\nWe consider two cases which represent the extremes among the possible distributions of a:\n1. ai are stochastically independent.

Then\nP {0, 1 stable and 0, 1 fixed} = P {a = 0} .\nWe conclude that unanimous attractors, which is a feature of the basic model of opinion dynamics with no local flips, is relatively unlikely to occur in both of these extreme scenarios. To find a stochastic model for the flip parameters which makes unanimous attractors more likely, we would have to look for some joint distribution that lies somewhere in between the two extremes, tailoring it specifically to achieve the desired outcome.\n3.2 Stability of the Fixed Point p = 1/2\nIn Figure 3, we see the update function (1) of the basic model, i.e. when a = 0. The stability parameter \u03bbr (0) of the universal fixed point defined in (2) is the slope of each curve at p = 1/2. The diagram illustrates that as the size of the local discussion group increases, so does \u03bbr (0). It was proved in [20] (see p. 27), that\nas r goes to infinity, \u03bbr (0) behaves asymptotically like the expression \u221a 2r \u03c0 . So the fixed point 1/2 becomes more and more unstable, with the dynamics being monotonic for any value of r, meaning that if the initial proportion p0 of the overall population in favour of A starts close by 1/2 \u2013 but not exactly at a tie \u2013 then for large local discussion groups, the dynamics tend away from a tie to a unanimous majority in favour of the initially favoured alternative, and convergence is faster the larger r is.\nWe start our investigation of the stability of the fixed point 1/2 by considering the two cases treated in the section about unanimous attractors: independent flip parameters and flat flip parameters. Afterwards, we investigate what happens in between these two extremes using a model of ferromagnetism that features different degrees of correlation between binary random variables."

To avoid dealing with the trivial case that there is no randomness in the model, which is the case if the variance Vai of each flip parameter is 0, we exclude this possibility by assuming Vai > 0 for the rest of the article.\nThe key property of the flip parameters is their expectation Eai. As the flip parameters are bounded [0, 1]- valued random variables, this expectation always exists. If for each i the expectation is different than 1/2, then the sign of E\u03bbr (a) is given by the sign of 1 \u2212 2Eai. However, this in of itself is of limited usefulness. The entire distribution of the stability parameter matters. Let us start with V\u03bbr (a), the variance of \u03bbr (a). Its typical magnitude will turn out to be smaller than r. This implies that the stability parameter under the present assumptions scales more slowly as r goes to infinity compared to the deterministic basic model. We have the following limit theorem from which the previous claim follows. In the statement of the limit theorems in this article, the symbol d\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nr\u2192\u221e stands for convergence in distribution as r goes to infinity.

The fixed point 1/2 is therefore \u2018on average stable\u2019. However, this does not imply that a stable fixed point is typical behaviour for this model under these assumptions. A better description of the typical behaviour is given by its variance, which is of order \u0398 ( \u221a r). The formal result is the following limit theorem. Below and\nin the rest of this article, N ( \u00b5, \u03c32 ) stands for the normal distribution with expectation \u00b5 \u2208 R and variance \u03c32 \u2265 0. The special case \u03c3 = 0 can be identified with \u03b4\u00b5.\nTheorem 2. Let (ai)i\u2208N be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with support in [0, 1] and Eai = 1/2 for each i \u2208 N. We define the constants\nbri := ( r i ) 2i\u2212 r 2r\u22121\nfor all r and all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } and the sequence sr := \u221a\u2211r i= r+12 b2ri. Asymptotically, sr is of order \u0398 ( r1/4 ) . The sequence of random variables (\u03bbr (a)) defined in (2) and normalised by sr converges in distribution to a centred normal distribution. Specifically,\n\u03bbr (a)\nsr\nd\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e N (0, 4Va1) .\nAlso, V\u03bbr (a) = \u0398 ( \u221a r).\n2Let (an)n\u2208N and (bn)n\u2208N be sequences in the real numbers. Then we will write\nan = o (bn) if lim n\u2192\u221e\nan bn = 0,\nan = \u0398 (bn) if lim inf n\u2192\u221e \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223anbn \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 > 0 and lim sup n\u2192\u221e \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223anbn \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 <\u221e,\nan \u2248 bn if lim n\u2192\u221e\nan bn = 1.\nInformally, an = o (bn) means an is \u2018asymptotically smaller\u2019 than bn, and an = \u0398 (bn) means an and bn are \u2018asymptotically of the same order\u2019. an \u2248 bn is a stronger condition than being of the same order. It means we can asymptotically substitute bn for an.\nWe can summarise our findings regarding independent flip parameters as follows:\n1. If for each i Eai 6= 1/2, then we have a bias towards either going along with the majority or rejecting it. The high flip probability regime, given by Eai > 1/2, leads to a negative stability parameter. This means there are alternating dynamics of the majorities around the fixed point 1/2, repeatedly switching between a majority in favour of alternative A and a majority in favour of B. If Eai < 1/2 for each i, then the dynamics around the fixed point 1/2 are monotonic. The typical magnitude of the stability parameter scales with r and is of order \u0398 ( \u221a r). This is the same magnitude as in the basic model\nwith all flip parameters equal to 0, but keep in mind that in the basic model, the sign of the stability parameter is always positive, whereas here the sign is determined by Eai. Informally, we can say that the typical realisation of the stability parameter can be expressed as\n\u03bbr (a) = \u221a 2r \u03c0 (1\u2212 2Ea1)\u00b1\u0398 ( r1/4 ) .\n2. If Eai = 1/2 for each i, the stability parameter is a centred random variable with equal probabilities of being positive or negative. Its fluctuations are described by a normal distribution whose variance is proportional to the variance of each flip parameter, and their magnitude is of order \u0398 ( \u221a r).\nInformally, the typical magnitude of the stability parameter is given by the expression \u03bbr (a) = \u00b1\u0398 ( r1/4 ) .\nIn both cases, the fixed point 1/2 becomes unstable as the discussion groups grow large, meaning there is a tendency towards majorities in favour of one of the alternatives, albeit the dynamics can be alternating which implies there is no convergence of the distribution of opinions towards a limit. Therefore, independent and identically distributed flip parameters do not give rise to a tendency towards ties in the dynamics of the model. Under independence of the flip parameters, we would have to relax the identical distribution assumption and tailor the distributions of the ai to obtain a stable fixed point 1/2 and thus a tendency towards ties."

The latter we understand as the situation where the typical sum \u2211r i= r+12 ai is of order r, or \u2018macroscopic\u2019, whereas in the former case that same sum would be o (r) with high probability.\nTo obtain varying degrees of positive correlation between the flip parameters, we employ the Curie-Weiss model (CWM) of ferromagnetism, as it allows us to observe three different regimes of correlations while also being amenable to analytic solutions at least asymptotically. The CWM describes a set of elementary magnets (or \u2018spins\u2019) that tend to align with each other. The two possible states for each magnet are encoded in the random variables as the values \u22121 and +1. The CWM was first applied to the study of problems in the social sciences in [8]. Since then, there have been several articles using the CWM to explore some social or economic phenomenon (see e.g. [29, 11, 36, 34, 41, 30]).\nLet n \u2208 N be the number of random variables ( X\n(n) 1 , . . . , X (n) n\n) . The CWM is defined by the so called\n\u2018canonical ensemble\u2019, the probability of each configuration x \u2208 {\u22121, 1}n:\nP ( X\n(n) 1 = x1, . . . , X (n) n = xn\n) = Z\u22121 exp  \u03b2 2n ( n\u2211 i=1 xi )2 , (3) where \u03b2 \u2265 0 is the inverse temperature parameter and Z is a normalisation constant. \u03b2 regulates the interaction strength between the random variables. For positive \u03b2, the configurations with the highest probability are (1, . . . , 1) and (\u22121, . . . ,\u22121). On a technical note, contrary to the case of independent random variables where we can assume that there is a single infinite sequence of independent random variables, of which we are free to take the first n variables, there is no such infinite sequence of Curie-Weiss random variables. Instead, we have a separate model with n variables for each n \u2208 N. In order to emphasize this difference, we included the superindex (n) in the notation.\nThe CWM has three regimes of distinct behaviour:\n1. For \u03b2 < 1, the interaction between the X (n) i is weak.\n2. \u03b2 = 1 is a critical point with its own distinct behaviour.\n3. For \u03b2 > 1, the interaction is strong.\nEach of these descriptions can be made precise in terms of the limiting distribution of the so called magnetisation \u2211n i=1X (n) i /n as n goes to infinity. We note that for \u03b2 = 0 the variables X (n) i are independent. Thus, we have a special case of our assumptions in Section 3.2.1.\nNow re-index the random variables X (n) i such that the index i runs from r+1 2 to r instead of 1 to n. We will write X (r) i for each r and each i. As 1\u2212 2ai takes values in the interval [\u22121, 1], we can identify 1\u2212 2ai with X (r) i and obtain a stochastic model of the flip parameters with\n\u03bbr (a) = 1\n2r\u22121 r\u2211 i= r+12 ( r i ) (2i\u2212 r)X(r)i .\nHowever, due to the binary nature of the random variables X (r) i we only get the two levels of flip probabilities X (r) i = 1 = 1 \u2212 2ai, which is equivalent to ai = 0, and X (r) i = \u22121, which is equivalent to ai = 1. This allor-nothing setup is somewhat extreme. It only considers the possibilities of either respecting the majority when ai = 0 or flipping with probability 1. Hence, we introduce a scale s \u2208 (0, 1), which is constant, and we identify 1\u2212 2ai with sXi, thus obtaining two possible levels of flip probabilities 1\u2212s2 and 1+s 2 . So there is\nthe possibility of a low flip probability and a high flip probability, both of which lie in (0, 1). The stability parameter is therefore\n\u03bbr (a) = s\n2r\u22121 r\u2211 i= r+12 ( r i ) (2i\u2212 r)X(r)i .\nNote that Eai = 1/2 holds for all i, and hence E\u03bbr (a) = 0. The results for this setup are as follows:\n1. For \u03b2 = 0, the model behaves just as outlined in Section 3.2.1. The stability parameter \u03bbr (a) normalised by a term of order r1/4 tends to a normal distribution.\nFor 0 < \u03b2 < 1, there is positive correlation between the flip parameters ai = 1\u2212sX(r)i\n2 . However, this correlation is relatively weak, and the stability parameter behaves as for independent flip parameters.\n2. If \u03b2 = 1, then there is stronger correlation between the flip parameters than for \u03b2 < 1. However, this increase in correlation is not reflected in the typical magnitude of \u03bbr (a). We once again find a typical magnitude of order \u0398 ( r1/4 ) with equal probabilities of \u03bbr (a) being positive or negative. It is only the\nmultiplicative constant in the term \u0398 ( r1/4 ) which differs. See Theorem 3 for more details.\n3. For \u03b2 > 1, the correlation between the ai is stronger than for \u03b2 = 1. Now we see this reflected in the typical magnitude of \u03bbr (a) which is of order \u0398 ( \u221a r). Thus, we conclude that the strong correlation\nbetween the flip parameters induces the same order of instability of the fixed point as we observe in the basic model. However, due to the expectation of each flip parameter being 1/2, we once again have equal probabilities of observing monotonic dynamics around 1/2 or alternating dynamics.\nAs we see, using the CWM for the flip parameters, we cover the cases of \u03bbr (a) being typically of order \u0398 ( r1/4 ) similarly to the case of independent flip parameters and \u03bbr (a) being typically of order \u0398 ( \u221a r) which is the same magnitude as in the basic model. The stronger the correlation between the flip parameters, the more unstable the fixed point 1/2 becomes. This means for strongly correlated flip parameters, there is a pronounced tendency to a large majority in favour of one of the alternatives, or else there is oscillating behaviour that alternates between majorities in favour of each of the alternatives in turn. For weak correlation, signified by \u03b2 \u2264 1, we obtain an unstable fixed point 1/2, where the magnitude scales more slowly than for the strong correlation regime \u03b2 > 1. Note that similarly to the case of independent flip parameters with Eai = 1/2, the CWM also yields a random sign of \u03bbr (a) with each sign having probability 1/2. Formally, we have the following limit theorem:\nTheorem 3. Let for each r, ( X\n(r) i ) r+1 2 \u2264i\u2264r be {\u22121, 1}-valued random variables with joint distribution given\nby (3), s \u2208 (0, 1), and let ai := 1\u2212sX(r)i 2 for each i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } . We define the constants\nbri := s ( r i ) 2i\u2212 r 2r\u22121\nfor all r and all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } and the sequence sr := \u221a\u2211r i= r+12 b2ri. Asymptotically, sr is of order\n\u0398 ( r1/4 ) . We have the following limiting distributions:\n1. If \u03b2 < 1, then \u03bbr (a)\nsr\nd\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e N (0, 1) . (4)\n2. If \u03b2 = 1, then \u03bbr(a)sr converges in distribution to a symmetric non-normal distribution.\n3. If \u03b2 > 1, then \u03bbr (a)\u221a\nr d\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e\n1 2 (\u03b4\u2212m + \u03b4m) ,\nwhere m > 0 is a constant independent of r and strictly increasing in \u03b2.\nInformally, if \u03b2 \u2264 1, the typical stability parameter value is \u03bbr (a) = \u00b1\u0398 ( r1/4 ) . For \u03b2 > 1, the typical value is \u03bbr (a) = \u00b1m \u221a r \u00b1\u0398 ( r1/4 ) .\nThe limiting distributions of (a suitably normalised) \u03bbr (a) broadly follow the same pattern as for the magnetisation\nSr := r\u2211 i= r+12 X (r) i .\nThere are, however, some interesting differences:\n1. The limiting distribution of the normalised magnetisation \u221a\n2 rSr when \u03b2 < 1 is also normal, but the\nvariance depends on the parameter \u03b2 (see Sections IV.4 and V.9 of [14] for a detailed analysis of the CWM): \u221a\n2 r Sr d\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e\nN ( 0, 1\n1\u2212 \u03b2\n) . (5)\nThe variance is 1 for \u03b2 = 0, i.e. when the X (r) i are independent, and then it increases as \u03b2 grows, diverging to infinity as \u03b2 approaches 1 from below. This is not the case for \u03bbr(a)sr , which converges in distribution to a standard normal, independently of the value of \u03b2 < 1. Note that sr does not depend on \u03b2.\n2. The normalisation required in each regime of the model in order to obtain convergence in distribution is different. For the stability parameter \u03bbr (a), we normalise by sr = \u0398 ( r1/4 ) in both the regimes\n\u03b2 < 1 and \u03b2 = 1, while \u03b2 > 1 requires normalisation by \u221a r. The magnetisation Sr, on the other hand, requires normalisation by \u221a r 2 , ( r 2 )3/4 , and r2 , respectively, in each regime. This difference is crucial since it directly affects the typical magnitude of the stability parameter which is different than that of the magnetisation.\nFor independent flip parameters, we analysed the case that Eai = 1/2, which makes \u03bbr (a) a centred random variable, and the case Eai 6= 1/2. We can do the same for flip parameters with a joint Curie-Weiss distribution. The first case was treated above. If we allow an external magnetic field in the model, the random variables X (r) i no longer have expectation 0, and thus the flip parameters ai will have expectation different than 1/2. The joint distribution is given by\nP ( X\n(n) 1 = x1, . . . , X (n) n = xn\n) = Z\u22121 exp  \u03b2 2n ( n\u2211 i=1 xi )2 + h n\u2211 i=1 xi  , (6) for each configuration x \u2208 {\u22121, 1}n. Above, the parameter h \u2208 R gives the strength of the external magnetic field. We once again re-index the variables such that for each r the index i of X\n(r) i runs from r+1 2 to r. In\nthe context of the flip parameters ai = 1\u2212sX(r)i\n2 , a positive h implies a bias towards lower flip probabilities, whereas a negative h means there is a bias towards higher flip probabilities. Hence, we can regard h as a parameter that regulates how contrarian the people are. Under the presence of such a bias, the stability parameter will be of order \u0398 ( \u221a r), regardless what the value of the parameter \u03b2 \u2265 0 is. The sign of \u03bbr (a) will be the same as that of h. Thus, for h > 0 which is low contrarianism, we obtain a model which is qualitatively similar to the basic model, featuring an unstable fixed point 1/2 with monotonic dynamics. A value h < 0 which indicates high contrarianism, on the other hand, yields an unstable fixed point with alternating dynamics. The magnitude of the stability parameter will be \u0398 ( \u221a r) for all h 6= 0 and all \u03b2 \u2265 0.\nThe formal result is the following theorem: Theorem 4. Let for each r, ( X\n(r) i ) r+1 2 \u2264i\u2264r be {\u22121, 1}-valued random variables with joint distribution given\nby (6), h 6= 0, s \u2208 (0, 1), and let ai := 1\u2212sX(r)i 2 for each i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } . Let bri and sr be defined as in\nTheorem 3 for all r and all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } . Then we have for all \u03b2 \u2265 0\n\u03bbr (a)\u2212 x (\u03b2, h) \u2211r i= r+12 bri\nsr\nd\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e N (0, 1) . (7)\nAbove, x (\u03b2, h) is a constant independent of r that has the same sign as h. |x (\u03b2, h)| is increasing in \u03b2.\nThe proofs of this theorem and all previous ones can be found in the Appendix. Informally, for h 6= 0, the typical value of the stability parameter is \u03bbr (a) = x (\u03b2, h) \u221a 2r \u03c0 \u00b1\u0398 ( r1/4 ) .\nContrary to the absence of an external magnetic field, the CWM behaves in a qualitatively similar fashion for all values of \u03b2 \u2265 0 when there is an external magnetic field h 6= 0. This is similar to the behaviour of the magnetisation Sr. A central limit theorem similar to the statement (5) holds for any value \u03b2 \u2265 0 provided that h 6= 0. (7) is a central limit theorem that holds for all values of \u03b2 and h 6= 0. However, just as without the external magnetic field, the stability parameter and the magnetisation have different typical magnitudes: the typical magnitude of \u03bbr (a) is of order \u0398 ( \u221a r), whereas the typical magnitude of Sr is of order \u0398 (r) under the assumption of an external magnetic field.\nEven the strong correlation regime of the CWM does not give a stable fixed point 1/2 with positive probability. One reason for this is that there are no realisations of the vector of flip parameters a where each entry is equal to 1/2. Also, the typical realisations of a feature a sizeable majority of entries ai pointing in the same direction. In conclusion, strong correlation on its own is not necessarily enough to reproduce the result we saw in Section 3.2.2 of a stable fixed point under perfect positive correlation of the flip parameters and a positive probability of all of them being equal to 1/2."

            "text": "We investigated the behaviour of the local flip model when the flip parameters, which are ordinarily fixed constants, are randomly selected. First we studied the case of small local discussion groups such as real-life friend or work groups in Section 2. Under independent uniformly distributed flip parameters, we found that\n\u2022 The number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model is generally small (meaning smaller than the possible maximum of r fixed points). Thus, the dynamics of the model are fairly simple, with large\nbasins of attraction to the few attractors that mark the limits public discourse tends towards as time passes.\n\u2022 Unless we exclude the possibility of flips against unanimous majorities, the local flip model typically does not present unanimous attractors. This is a major difference compared to the basic model. As unanimous majorities are extremely rare in real life, this is a point in favour of the local flip model.\n\u2022 The universal fixed point 1/2 is mostly stable. There is a tendency towards ties in most discussions.\nThen, in Section 3, we studied large discussion groups. Unanimous majorities are very unlikely to occur for both large and small discussion groups. On the other hand, we found that the picture differs considerably between small and large groups as far as the stability of the fixed point 1/2 is concerned. Whereas the former feature mostly stable fixed points at 1/2, the latter do not. In fact, we found that the larger the local discussion groups, generally, the more unstable the fixed point 1/2 becomes. The many degrees of freedom inherent in large discussion groups do not lead to the coexistence of stable and unstable fixed point at 1/2. Contrary to the basic model, the sign of the stability parameter, which determines whether the dynamics close to a tie are monotonic or alternating, can be positive or negative. We showed that for unbiased flip parameters, i.e. flip parameters with expectation 1/2, monotonic and alternating dynamics around a tie are equally likely. If the flip parameters are biased, then the sign of the bias determines the sign of the stability parameter and thus whether we only see monotonic or alternating dynamics but never both with positive probability. If the flip parameters are biased towards accepting the majority, then the local flip model behaves similarly to the basic model with monotonic dynamics. These findings are stable across a range of degrees of dependency of the flip parameters, all the way from independence to strong correlation in the low temperature regime of the CWM. Thus, the picture the local flip model with random flip parameters paints is that for small discussion groups there is a tendency towards ties, whereas for large discussion groups there is a tendency to move away from ties. We either see convergence to a majority in favour of one of the alternatives, or we observe perpetual swings from majorities in favour of one alternative to majorities for the other one."

In order to show Theorem 1 for this\ntriangular array of random variables (Yri)r\u2208N,i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r}, we need to verify four statements:\nCondition 5. 1. (Yri)r\u2208N,i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r} is a null array, i.e. for each r the random variables Yri are independent and limr\u2192\u221e supi E (|Yri| \u2227 1) = 0.\n2. \u2211r i= r+12 P {|Yri| > \u03b5} \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e 0, \u03b5 > 0.\n3. \u2211r i= r+12 E ( Yri1{|Yri|\u22641} ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e\nb \u2208 R, where for any measurable set A 1A refers to the indicator function of A.\n4. \u2211r i= r+12 V ( Yri1{|Yri|\u22641} ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e c \u2265 0.\nOnce the four conditions are verified, we have obtained convergence in distribution of \u2211r i= r+12\nYri to N (b, c). This includes the degenerate normal distribution N (b, 0) = \u03b4b as a special case. In order to show the first statement, we need to determine the asymptotic order of each Yri. That means we need to evaluate each bri asymptotically. We will next present and prove several statements regarding these coefficients before proceeding to the proof of the four statements in Condition 5. Since we will later also need powers bkri for all k \u2208 N, we will take care of this in the following lemma:\nLemma 6. Let r, k \u2208 N and i = r+12 + \u03b7r \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } . We distinguish four classes of \u03b7r:\n1. If \u03b7r = o ( \u221a r), then bkri = \u0398 ( \u03b7kr rk/2 ) .\n2.

The proof of this lemma uses the local limit theorem for the binomial distribution by de MoivreLaplace:\nTheorem 7. Let Pn be the binomial distribution with n \u2208 N {0, 1}-valued variables and parameter 1/2 and let \u03c6 be the Lebesgue density function of the standard normal distribution.

The theorem states that the scaled point probabilities \u221a n\n2 Pn {i} of the binomial distribution are well approximated for large values of n by the corresponding values of the density function of the standard normal distribution.

The statements for general k \u2208 N follow from the observation that the set A in (9) is bounded, and the function x 7\u2192 xk restricted to any bounded subset of the reals is uniformly continuous.\nLemma 6 states that the only coefficients bri which do not decay as r goes to infinity are those for which i\u2212 r+12 is of order \u221a r, in which case bri converges to some positive constant. Therefore, if we are looking for\nthe maximum of bri for a fixed r over all i, we only need to look at those i which are of order \u221a r, provided r is large enough.\nLemma 8. Let k \u2208 N. For large enough r, the maximum of { bkri | i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r }} is located at i \u2248 r+12 + \u221a r 2 and the value of the corresponding bkri is asymptotically given by\n0 <\n( 2 \u221a\n2\u221a e\u03c0\n)k < 1.\nAlso, for all r large enough, the set of coefficients bkri for all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r }\nis bounded above by some constant strictly smaller than 1.\nProof. Let k \u2208 N. Let h > 0 and i = r+12 + bh \u221a rc. The brackets b\u00b7c denote the floor function which rounds down the expression on the inside to the nearest integer. Then by Lemma 6,\nbkri \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e\n( 32\n\u03c0\n)k/2 exp ( \u22122kh2 ) hk.\nWe identify the value of the constant h which maximises the limit on the right hand side above. This expression can be understood as a function f : (0,\u221e)\u2192 R of h. Calculating the first derivative, we obtain\nf \u2032(h) = exp ( \u22122kh2 ) k ( \u22124hk+1 + hk\u22121 ) .\nEquating the first derivative to 0, we identify the critical point h0 = 1/2. We calculate the second derivative f \u2032\u2032(h) = exp ( \u22122kh2 ) k ( \u22124khk ( \u22124h2 + 1 ) + hk\u22122 ( \u22124 (k + 1)h2 + k \u2212 1 )) .\nThe value of the second derivative at the critical point h0 is negative, hence h0 is indeed the unique global maximum of f on (0,\u221e). By substituting h0 into f , we obtain the asymptotic maximum of bkri. It is easily calculated that\nf (h0) =\n( 2 \u221a\n2\u221a e\u03c0\n)k ,\nand this values lies in (0, 1). As for any h > 0 and i = r+12 + bh \u221a rc the coefficients converge uniformly over all values of h to f(h), we can choose r0 \u2208 N large enough that for all r \u2265 r0 and all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } we have\n0 < bkri < 1 and sup r\u2265r0 sup i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r} bkri < 1.\nSo starting at r0, all coefficients b k ri are uniformly bounded away from 1.\nWe next determine the asymptotic order of the sums \u2211r i= r+12 bkri. Lemma 9. Let k \u2208 N. Then we have r\u2211\ni= r+12\nbkri = \u0398 (\u221a r ) .\nThe lemma states that for all k \u2208 N the asymptotic order of the sum \u2211r i= r+12 bkri is the same, namely \u0398 ( \u221a r). This has important implications for the remaining proofs.\nProof. We first show an asymptotic upper bound for \u2211r i= r+12 bkri. Lemma 8 says that, for all r large enough, all summands bri are smaller than 1. Hence, b k ri \u2264 bri for all i. Therefore, we have the upper bound\nr\u2211 i= r+12 bkri \u2264 r\u2211 i= r+12 bri \u2248 \u221a 2r \u03c0 = \u0398 (\u221a r ) ,\nusing the asymptotic expression for \u2211r i= r+12 bri from p. 27 of [20].\nNext, we show a lower bound for \u2211r i= r+12 bkri. By Statement 2 of Lemma 6, we have for any constants\n0 < c < C <\u221e, r large enough, and i \u2208 B := { i \u2208 N | r+12 + c \u221a r < i < r+12 + C \u221a r }\nbkri \u2265 1\n2 min\n{( 32\n\u03c0\n)k/2 exp ( \u22122kh2 ) hk \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 h \u2208 [c, C] } =: \u03c4.\nThen \u03c4 > 0 holds. We note that the cardinality of index set B is at least b(C \u2212 c) \u221a rc, so a lower bound for the sum \u2211r i= r+12 bkri is given by\n\u03c4 \u230a (C \u2212 c) \u221a r \u230b = \u0398 (\u221a r ) .\nStatement 1\nAfter these preparatory lemmas which we will also use for later proofs, we are ready to show Statement 1 concerning the (Yri)r\u2208N,i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r} being a null array. By Lemma 8, there is a constant K > 0 such that\n|Yri| = bri |1\u2212 2ai|\u221a r \u2264 K\u221a r (10)\nholds for all r and all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } . Therefore, we have\nE (|Yri| \u2227 1) = E ( bri |1\u2212 2ai|\u221a r \u2227 1 ) \u2264 K\u221a r \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e 0\nuniformly over all r \u2208 N, i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } . This proves Statement 1 in Condition 5.\nStatement 2\nLet \u03b5 > 0. By (10), we have for all r > K2/\u03b52\n|Yri| < \u03b5 for all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r }\n. Therefore, r\u2211\ni= r+12\nP {|Yri| > \u03b5} = 0\nfor all r > K2/\u03b52. This proves Statement 2 in Condition 5.\nStatement 3\nBy (10), for all r \u2265 K2,\nr\u2211 i= r+12 E ( Yri1{|Yri|\u22641} ) = r\u2211 i= r+12 E (Yri) = 1\u221a r r\u2211 i= r+12 briE (1\u2212 2ai)\n= E (1\u2212 2a1) 1\u221a r r\u2211 i= r+12 bri \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e\n\u221a 2\n\u03c0 (1\u2212 2Ea1) =: b \u2208 R.\nStatement 4\nWe again employ (10) to calculate that for all r \u2265 K2\nr\u2211 i= r+12 V ( Yri1{|Yri|\u22641} ) = r\u2211 i= r+12 VYri = r\u2211 i= r+12 ( EY 2ri \u2212 (EYri) 2 )\n\u2248 1 r r\u2211 i= r+12 b2ri ( E (1\u2212 2ai)2 \u2212 (1\u2212 2Eai)2 )\n= 1\nr r\u2211 i= r+12 b2ri ( 4Ea2i \u2212 4 (Eai) 2 )\n= 4Va1 r r\u2211 i= r+12 b2ri \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e 0. (11)\nIn the last step, we used Lemma 9, by which \u2211r i= r+12 b2ri = \u0398 ( \u221a r). In virtue of the verification of Condition 5, we have thus shown the limit theorem\n\u03bbr (a)\u221a r d\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e N\n(\u221a 2\n\u03c0 s (1\u2212 2Ea1) , 0\n) = \u03b4\u221a 2\n\u03c0 (1\u22122Ea1) .\nThe last statement in Theorem 1, V\u03bbr (a) = \u0398 ( \u221a r), follows from our calculation (11), Lemma 9, and\nV\u03bbr (a) = r r\u2211\ni= r+12\nVYri = 4Va1 r\u2211\ni= r+12\nb2ri = \u0398 (\u221a r ) .\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 1."

            "text": "Theorems 3 and 4 are limit theorems for sums of triangular arrays of dependent random variables. Therefore, we cannot employ the classic central limit theorem by Feller-Le\u0301vy. Instead, we will use the method of moments. Let (Yni)n\u2208N,i\u2208{1,...,n} be a triangular array of random variables. The method of moments consists of showing the convergence of moments\nE ( n\u2211 i=1 Yni )k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 n\u2192\u221e mk \u2208 R\nfor each k \u2208 N. Provided the constants mk satisfy appropriate upper bounds, e.g.\nmk \u2264 ACkk!, k \u2208 N, (15)\nfor fixed constants A,C \u2208 R, the convergence of the moments implies convergence in distribution of the sequence ( \u2211n i=1 Yni)n\u2208N to a limiting distribution \u00b5 with moments of all orders k given by the limits mk above. Moreover, the limiting distribution \u00b5 is uniquely determined by its moments mk. Consult e.g. Example 4\non p. 205 of [?] for a proof of these statements. We note that all limiting distributions demonstrated in this article satisfy the condition (15), so the method of moments is applicable. Let \u03b2 \u2264 1. We define (Yri)r\u2208N,i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r} by Yri := bri(1\u22122ai) sr = briXrisr for all r \u2208 N and all i \u2208 { r+1 2 , . . . , r } .\nTo calculate the limits of the moments E (\u2211r\ni= r+12 Yri\n)k , we have to evaluate asymptotically sums of the\ntype r\u2211\ni1,...,ik= r+1 2\nEYri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Yrik .\nTherefore, we will need to know the asymptotic behaviour of correlations such as\nEYri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Yrik = bri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 brik\nskr EXri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xrik .\nWe thus start the proof of Theorem 3 by presenting asymptotic expressions for correlations of the type above in the CWM. These facts are well known and presented here for the convenience of the reader. The CurieWeiss random variables ( Xr r+12 , . . . , Xrr ) are exchangeable. It follows that for any set of indices {i1, . . . , ik} with cardinality k we have EXri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xrik = EXr r+12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xr r+12 +k, i.e. the correlation EXri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xrik depends only on the number of different random variables included and not their specific identities. We are thus free to look only at the first k random variables. The value of these correlations depends on the regime of the model, and we have the following proposition. Below (k \u2212 1)!! stands for (k \u2212 1) (k \u2212 3) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 1, and we set \u03b2\u0304 := \u03b21\u2212\u03b2 for all \u03b2 < 1.\nProposition 10. Let k \u2208 N.

If we have an index vector I = (i1, . . . , ik), where all indices belong to {1, . . . , k} (possibly including repeated indices), there is a profile r = (r1, . . . , rk) \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k}k which registers the number of indices in I according to their multiplicity: rj stands for the number of indices in I that occur exactly j times for j \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. Let \u03a0k be the set of all profiles of length k. All profiles r \u2208 \u03a0k satisfy the identity \u2211k j=1 jrj = k. Also, the number of profiles is finite. A simple upper\nbound on \u2223\u2223\u03a0k\u2223\u2223 is given by (k + 1)k.\nWe will need to know how many index vectors there are for each profile. The following lemma provides the answer:\nLemma 11. Let k \u2208 N and r \u2208 \u03a0k. The number of index vectors (i1, . . . , ik) with entries in {1, . . . , k} and profile r is given by\nk!\nr1! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rk! 1!r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k!rk .\nProof. Let k \u2208 N and r \u2208 \u03a0k. We construct an index vector I = (i1, . . . , ik) with entries in {1, . . . , k} and profile r in two steps:\n1. We first partition the set {1, . . . , k} into k sets Aj , indexed by j = 1, . . . , k, with cardinality |Aj | = jrj in accordance with the profile r. Each set Aj indicates the positions ` \u2208 {1, . . . , k} such that the index i` occurs exactly j times in I. There are(\nk! r1! (2r2)! . . . (krk)!\n) (16)\nways to partition {1, . . . , k} as described.\n2. We join the selected the positions ` \u2208 Aj such that the i` have the same value, i.e. we have to form partitions of Aj into subsets of j elements each for all j = 1, . . . , k. Let the elements of Aj be arranged in ascending order. We form the first set of the partition of Aj , which contains the smallest element of Aj , by selecting j \u2212 1 from all remaining jrj \u2212 1 elements of Aj . There are\n(jrj \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (j (rj \u2212 1) + 1) (j \u2212 1)!\nways to make this selection. Once the first n \u2208 {1, . . . , rj \u2212 1} of the subsets of Aj have been selected in this fashion, we generate subset n + 1 by choosing the smallest of the elements not yet assigned to any of the previous subsets and choosing j \u2212 1 from all remaining j (rj \u2212 n)\u2212 1 elements of Aj . There are\n(j (rj \u2212 n)\u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (j (rj \u2212 n\u2212 1) + 1) (j \u2212 1)!\nways to make this selection. Thus, we have defined the algorithm to determine the partition of Aj into subsets of cardinality j. We observe that there are\n(jrj \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (j (rj \u2212 1) + 1) (j \u2212 1)! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (j \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 (j \u2212 1)! = (jrj)! jrjrj ! (j \u2212 1)!rj = (jrj)! rj ! j!rj (17)\nsuch partitions.\nWe multiply (16) and (17) for each j and obtain\nk! r1! (2r2)! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (krk)! r1!

Then raise the first r1 of them to the power 1, the next r2 to the power 2, etc. Take the product of all these powers and take their expectation. This expectation is what we will refer to as EX (r). Due to the exchangeability of the Curie-Weiss random variables, the identity of the selected Xri in this definition is inconsequential.\nUsing Lemma 11, we can express Mk as\nMk = 1\nskr r\u2211 i1,...,ik= r+1 2 bri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 brikEXri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xrik\n\u2248 1 skr \u2211 r\u2208\u03a0k\nk!\nr1! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rk! 1!r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k!rk  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bkri rk EX (r) . (18) Each summand in (18) is indexed by a profile r \u2208 \u03a0k. Thus there are only finitely many of them (as noted above, at most(k + 1) k , which is independent of r), and each summand depends on r. Most of these summands do not contribute to the moment Mk in the sense that the corresponding summand goes to 0 as r \u2192\u221e. Our first task is to determine which of the summands contribute and discard the others. Secondly, we calculate the limit of the contributing summands and show they converge to the moment of order k of the claimed limiting distribution.\nLet \u03b2 < 1. The limit given in Theorem 3 is standard normal, and we have to show that Mk converges to the moment of order k of a standard normal distribution. The moments of the standard normal are given by{\n(k \u2212 1)!!, k even, 0, k odd.\nFirst we note that due to the symmetric nature of the Curie-Weiss distribution defined in (3), all odd moments Mk are 0. Let k be even. Employing Proposition 10 and noting that for all i \u2208\n{ r+1 2 , . . . , r } and all j \u2208 N0\nXjri =\n{ 1 if j is even,\nXri otherwise,\nthe correlation EX (r) can be expressed for each profile r \u2208 \u03a0k as\n(o\u2212 1)!!\u03b2\u0304o/2 ( 2\nr\n)o/2 ,\nwhere o stands for the sum of rj over all odd j. By (18), we have\nMk \u2248 1\nskr \u2211 r\u2208\u03a0k\nk!\nr1! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rk! 1!r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k!rk  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bkri rk (o\u2212 1)!!\u03b2\u0304o/2(2 r )o/2 .\nWe inspect the factors in each summand which depend on r. These are:\n1\nskr  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bkri rk (1 r )o/2 = \u0398 ( 1 rk/4 ) \u0398 ( r 1 2 \u2211k j=1 rj ) 1 ro/2 .\nAbove we used the definition of sr and the asymptotic expression provided by Lemma 9. The powers of r are\n\u2212 k 4 + 1 2 k\u2211 j=1 rj \u2212 o 2 = \u2212k 4 + 1 2 k/2\u2211 j=1 r2j . (19)\nThe summand converges (to a positive constant or to 0) if and only if (19) is smaller or equal to 0. Since we have\nk = k\u2211 j=1 jrj \u2265 2 k\u2211 j=1 r2j ,\nall summands in Mk converge. Moreover, as (19) being smaller or equal to 0 is equivalent to the last inequality presented, (19) equals 0 if and only if 2r2 = k. Hence, the only summand in (18) which contributes is the one corresponding to the profile (0, k/2, 0, . . . , 0). For all other profiles, (19) is negative, and thus the summand converges to 0. We have thus shown\nMk \u2248 1\nskr\nk!\n(k/2)! 2!k/2  r\u2211 i= r+12 b2ri k/2\n= k!\n(k/2)! 2!k/2 = (k \u2212 1)!!.\nThis proves the moments Mk converge to the moments of the standard normal distribution and concludes the proof of the statement for \u03b2 < 1 in Theorem 3.\nNow let \u03b2 = 1. We analyse the moments Mk given in (18). Odd moments are 0, so let k be even. According to Proposition 10, the correlations EX (r) can be expressed as\nco\n( 2\nr\n)o/4 ,\nwhere o again stands for the sum of rj over all odd j. We inspect the factors in each summand in (18) which depend on r. These are:\n1\nskr  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bkri rk (1 r )o/4 = \u0398 ( 1 rk/4 ) \u0398 ( r 1 2 \u2211k j=1 rj ) 1 ro/4 .\nThe powers of r are\n\u2212 k 4 + 1 2 k\u2211 j=1 rj \u2212 o 4 = \u2212k 4 + 1 2 k/2\u2211 j=1 r2j + 1 4 o. (20)\nThe above expression is smaller or equal to 0 if and only if\nk = k\u2211 j=1 jrj \u2265 o+ 2 k/2\u2211 j=1 r2j .\nSince this equality holds for all profiles, none of the summands diverges. The contributing summands are those for which equality holds in the inequality above. The profiles for which equality holds are{( 2j, k2 \u2212 j, 0, . . . , 0 ) \u2223\u2223 j = 0, . . . , k2}, i.e. each index occurs either once or twice. Therefore,\nMk \u2248 1\nskr k/2\u2211 j=1\nk! (2j)! ( k 2 \u2212 j ) ! 2!k/2\u2212j  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri 2j r\u2211 i= r+12 b2ri k/2\u2212j c2j (2 r )j/2 .\nSo we have convergence of the moments to fixed limits and as a consequence also convergence in distribution. The moments given above are not those of a normal distribution, which can be verified by calculating M2 and M4 and noting that limr\u2192\u221eM4 6= 3 (limr\u2192\u221eM2)2, whereas the moments of any centred normal distribution satisfy this equality. Finally, we treat the case \u03b2 > 1. Since the normalisation of \u03bbr (a) is now \u221a r, the triangular array (Yri)r\u2208N,i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r} is defined by Yri := bri(1\u22122ai)\u221a r = briXri\u221a r and the moments Mk by\nMk := E ( n\u2211 i=1 Yni )k = 1 rk/2 r\u2211 i1,...,ik= r+1 2 bri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 brik EXri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xrik\n\u2248 1 rk/2 \u2211 r\u2208\u03a0k\nk!\nr1! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rk! 1!r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 k!rk  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bkri rk EX (r) . By Proposition 10, the correlations EX (r) converge to\nx (\u03b2) o\nin the limit r \u2192\u221e, where o again stands for the sum of rj over all odd j. The odd moments Mk are 0. For the even moments, each summand of Mk has the following factors which depend on r:\n1\nrk/2  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bkri rk = 1 rk/2 \u0398 ( r 1 2 \u2211k j=1 rj ) .\nThus, the powers of r in each summand are\n\u2212k 2 + 1 2 k\u2211 j=1 rj .\nThis expression is non-positive for all profiles, so none of the summands diverges. The inequality holds with equality for the profile (k, 0, . . . , 0), and it is strict for all other profiles. Hence, the moment Mk is\nasymptotically equal to\nMk \u2248 1\nrk/2  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri k x (\u03b2)k \u2248 1 rk/2 ( 2r \u03c0 )k/2 x (\u03b2) k = (( 2 \u03c0 )1/2 x (\u03b2) )k =: mk.\nSince all odd moments are 0 and all even moments are mk, we conclude that \u03bbr(a)\u221a r converges in distribution to 12 (\u03b4\u2212m + \u03b4m)."

            "text": "Contrary to the CWM defined in (3), the model with an external magnetic field defined in (6) features flip parameters with expectations different than 1/2, analogous to the case of independent flip parameters treated in Theorem 1. The CWM with an external magnetic field shows a different behaviour and we cannot employ Proposition 10 for the correlations.\nInstead of the equation tanh\u03b2x = x, we have to analyse the more general equation\ntanh (\u03b2 (x+ h)) = x. (21)\nFor any value of \u03b2 \u2265 0, h 6= 0, there is a solution x (\u03b2, h) of (21) with the same sign as h. (We remark that if \u03b2 > 1 and |h| is small enough, then there are one or two solutions of the opposite signs as well. These are of no consequence for our analysis. See Sections IV.4 and V.9 of [14] for a detailed analysis of this model.) We have the following limit result for the correlations:\nProposition 12. Let \u03b2 \u2265 0, h 6= 0, and x (\u03b2, h) the solution of (21) defined above. Then we have for all k \u2208 N\nEXr r+12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xr r+12 +k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192r\u2192\u221e x (\u03b2, h) k .\nAs this proposition suggests, contrary to the model without an external magnetic field treated previously, we do not have distinct behaviour in the form of three different regimes as a function of \u03b2. We define the triangular array (Yri)r\u2208N,i\u2208{ r+12 ,...,r} by Yri := bri(1\u22122ai\u2212x(\u03b2,h)) sr = bri(Xri\u2212x(\u03b2,h))sr and the moments Mk for all k \u2208 N by\nMk := E  r\u2211 i= r+12 Yri k = 1 skr k\u2211 j=0 ( k j ) (\u22121)k\u2212j x (\u03b2, h)k\u2212j E\u03bbr (a)j .\nThe last factor in each summand above, E\u03bbr (a)j , can be expanded as we did in the proof of Theorem 3:\nE\u03bbr (a)j = r\u2211\ni1,...,ij= r+1 2\nbri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 brijEXri1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xrij\n\u2248 \u2211 r\u2208\u03a0j\nj!\nr1! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rj ! 1!r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 j!rj  r\u2211 i= r+12 bri r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  r\u2211 i= r+12 bjri rj EX (r) .\nAs a consequence of Proposition 12, the correlations EX (r) for all r \u2208 \u03a0j converge to\nEX (r) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 r\u2192\u221e x (\u03b2, h) o ,\nwhere o is the sum of the r` over all odd natural numbers ` in the range [1, j]. Thus, Mk is a double sum over j = 0, . . . , k and r \u2208 \u03a0j . The remainder of the proof consists of determining the factors which depend on r in each summand,\n\u0398\n( 1\nsr\n) \u0398 ( r 1 2 \u2211j `=1 r` ) ,\nanalysing which of the summands contribute asymptotically to Mk, calculating their sum, and showing that it converges to the corresponding moment of order k of a centred normal distribution. Since this procedure is very similar to the three cases we have already treated in such fashion in the proof of Theorem 3, we will omit this part and conclude here."
