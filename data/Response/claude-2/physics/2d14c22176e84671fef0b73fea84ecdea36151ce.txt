 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the use of novel natural crosslinking agents from plant or microbial sources that have not been extensively studied yet. This could lead to the discovery of new biocompatible crosslinkers. 

2. Optimize the reaction conditions (pH, temperature, etc.) for existing natural crosslinkers to improve the degree of crosslinking and enhance the properties of the resulting hydrogels.

3. Develop methods to reduce the cost and increase the availability of promising natural crosslinkers like genipin which currently have very high costs limiting widespread use. 

4. Conduct comparative cytotoxicity studies between synthetic crosslinkers and natural crosslinkers using different cell lines. This could provide more insight into their relative safety.

5. Explore combinations of natural and synthetic crosslinkers to develop hydrogels that balance biocompatibility with optimal mechanical and degradation properties for specific applications. The synergistic effects of mixed crosslinker systems could be investigated.
