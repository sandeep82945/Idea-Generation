    "abstractText": "Electrospun porous nanofibers have large specific surface areas and abundant active centers, which can effectively improve the properties of nanofibers. In the field of photocatalysis, electrospun porous nanofibers can increase the contact area of loaded photocatalytic particles with light, shorten the electron transfer path, and improve photocatalytic activity. In this paper, the main pore\u2212forming mechanisms of electrospun porous nanofiber are summarized as breath figures, phase separation (vapor\u2212induced phase separation, non\u2212solvent\u2212induced phase separation, and thermally induced phase separation) and post\u2212processing (selective removal). Then, the application of electrospun porous nanofiber loading photocatalytic particles in the degradation of pollutants (such as organic, inorganic, and bacteria) in water is introduced, and its future development prospected. Although porous structures are beneficial in improving the photocatalytic performance of nanofibers, they reduce their mechanical properties. Therefore, strategies for improving the mechanical properties of electrospun porous nanofibers are also briefly discussed.",

            "text": "As a \u201ctop\u2212down\u201d membrane preparation technology, electrospinning technology can produce continuous fibers with diameters ranging from microns to nanometers [1]. It also has the advantages of easy operation, low cost, high efficiency, high flexibility, a large number of fiber membranes within a short time, easy control of the fiber diameter and orientation, and easy control of the fiber microstructure [2\u20134] (porous [5], nano\u2212protrusions [6], folds [7], branches [8], hollow [9], core\u2212sheath [10], ribbons [11], and beads\u2212on\u2212the\u2212string [12]). Nanofibers prepared by electrospinning usually have good biocompatibility and degradability and can carry drugs into the human body. Nanofibers have small size effect, good fiber homogeneity, large specific surface area and interfiber porosity. Electrospinning [13\u201316] has been continuously upgraded and optimized with in\u2212depth study of their working processes. These include coaxial electrospinning [17,18], side\u2212by\u2212side electrospinning [19,20], tri\u2212axial electrospinning [21,22], tri\u2212fluid side\u2212by\u2212side electrospinning [23], and other multiple\u2212fluid electrospinning [24] that have been developed, providing a strong guarantee for the preparation of complex structured nanofibers. The process and technical principle of electrospinning is driven by the propelling pump while the spinning solution is extruded from the spinneret of the syringe. When no external electric field force is applied, a spherical droplet is formed under the action of surface tension and gravity. When an electric field force is applied, the droplet is connected to a high\u2212voltage power source, and its surface is instantly covered by the same charge. The repulsive force and surface tension between these charges cancel each other out, and the droplet becomes unstable. If the repulsive force is strong enough to overcome the surface tension, the droplet will become conical (Taylor cone) and jet down from the\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14193990 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 2 of 25\nspinneret. As the diameter of the jet continues to decrease until it bends, the solvent in the polymer jet evaporates rapidly in a short period of time, and finally solidifies into fibers with diameters ranging from nanometers to micrometers. The structure and morphology of the prepared fibers are affected by three sets of parameters: (1) system parameters (such as solution viscosity, polymer molecular weight, polymer solution concentration, electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, and surface tension); (2) process parameters (such as the magnitude of the applied voltage, the distance from the tip of the spinneret to the collection device, the flow rate of the spinning precursor solution); and (3) Environmental parameters (such as ambient temperature and humidity). These parameters will have a certain impact on the final morphology of the fiber. For example, increasing the voltage within a certain range will increase the charge density on the jet surface and increase the repulsive force, thus forming fibers with smaller diameters. However, if the voltage is too high, the formation of the Taylor cone will be hindered, resulting in the inability to spin normally. If the voltage and polymer solution concentration are too low, this may result in the production of some beads, which do not form continuous fibers of uniform diameter. If the voltage and polymer concentration are too high, the spinning process will be difficult, and the selection of appropriate experimental parameters can electrospin continuous, smooth, and uniform nanofibers. The porous structure is beneficial to the increase of the specific surface area of fibers, increase of ion transport channels, shortening ion transport paths, and enrichment of the active sites on the fiber surface and the internal space [25\u201327]. This results in electrospun porous nanofibers with a wide range of application prospects in the fields of photocatalysis [28], sensors [29], capacitors [30], drug delivery [31], and filtration [32].

It is a cleaning technology that continuously and efficiently degrades pollutants without causing secondary pollution. The principle of this technology is to use light to excite the photocatalyst. When light with energy greater than or equal to the energy gap is irradiated onto the photocatalytic particle, the electrons in its valence band (VB) are excited to jump to the conduction band (CB) [34], leading to the formation of corresponding holes in the VB, and electron\u2013hole pairs are then easy to form due to the strong mutual attraction between\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 3 of 25\nelectrons and holes. At this time, the two are separated from each other by the secondary excitation of light and diffused to the surface of the particles, producing a strong redox reaction with the pollutants [35]. The holes in the VB are good oxidants, and the electrons in the CB are good reducing agents. They generally react with H2O and O2 to generate highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals (OH) and superoxide anions (O2\u2212), which can directly oxidize organic matter into inorganic small molecules such as CO2 and H2O, without producing intermediate products, which is relatively clean and fast. During photocatalysis, the photocatalyst itself does not participate in the reaction but can accelerate the chemical reaction rate by promoting the separation of electron\u2013hole pairs under the excitation of photons, thus improving the photocatalytic efficiency [36]. However, in the photocatalytic process, the loss of photocatalytic particles during use can lead to poor reusability. At this time, combining photocatalytic technology with the electrostatic spinning of porous fibers can not only improve photocatalytic efficiency but also avoid losses and improve reusability [37,38]. In this paper, we summarize the electrospinning mechanism for the preparation of porous nanofiber membranes, its application in photocatalysis, and the relationship between porous structure and the properties of nanofibers."

Solvents with high volatility can volatilize within a very short electrospinning time and form a porous structure [53]. Selective removal of solvents by post\u2212treatment can also leave pores on the surface and inside [54,55]. The results show that the pore\u2212forming mechanisms of electrospun porous nanofibers mainly include breath figures (BFs) [56\u201358], vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) [59,60], non\u2212solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) [61,62], thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) [63,64], and selective removal (SR) [65,66]."

            "text": "This pore\u2212forming mechanism is generally applicable to highly volatile solvents (DCM, CHL) and high environmental humidity. As shown in Figure 2, due to the rapid volatilization of the solvent during the electrospinning process, the heat on the surface of the fiber is taken away, significantly reducing the surface temperature. Then, the water vapor becomes extremely small droplets attached to the fiber when cooled, occupying space on the fiber surface. Finally, the complete evaporation of the solvent and the water vapor leaves circular pores on the fiber surface [67\u201369]. Relative humidity is an important factor in the pore\u2212forming mechanism of BFs. When in high ambient humidity, the pore size range of this circular pore is generally 20\u2212200 nm, and the porosity is more than 90%. However, as the ambient humidity decreases, the pore size becomes smaller and the porosity decreases. When the ambient humidity is low enough, the porous structure cannot be formed through this mechanism [47,56,70]. The circular holes are mainly formed in the later stage of the electrospinning process. Otherwise, these holes will be pulled into elliptical holes due to the electrostatic force. This phenomenon usually occurs when highly volatile solvents and hydrophobic polymers (polystyrene PS [71,72], polymethylmethacrylate PMMA [73], polylactic acid PLA [74,75]) are combined. If hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO), are selected, then the surface will display folds rather than holes. For example, Megelski et al. [68] used CHL as a solvent and prepared hydrophobic PS and PMMA fibers with a certain porosity on the surface; consequently, the surface of the prepared hydrophilic PEO fibers displayed folds instead of pores. This phenomenon may be attributed to the rapid evaporation of the highly evaporative solvent during the spinning process and the condensation of the water vapor on the fiber surface to form droplets.

The BFs pore\u2212forming mechanism is simple and convenient, using a highly evaporative solvent to form pores in one step during the spinning process, but such pores only exist on the surface of the fiber, limiting the application.\n2.2. Vapor Induced Phase Separation (VIPS) Unlike BFs, which require a highly evaporative solvent and poor water miscibility, VIPS requires a solvent with low evaporation and good water miscibility. As shown in Figure 3, when the polymer jet is stretched at high speed in a high\u2212voltage electrostatic field, the water molecules in the air can easily penetrate the fiber and quickly mix with the solvent, acting as a non\u2212solvent for the polymer, and resulting in the phase separation between the polymer and the solvent within a short time to form solvent\u2212rich zones and polymer\u2212rich zones. Finally, the polymer enrichment gradually solidifies into the fiber skeleton, while the solvent\u2212rich region leaves pores inside the fiber due to solvent volatilization [47,69,76]. The pore formation of the BFs occurs after the polymer jet is stretched, so the shape of the pores is round and easy to distinguish. While the pores formed by VIPS are generally elliptical, the water molecules in the air mix quickly with the solvent. After the stretching of the electric field and complete volatilization, elliptical pores will be formed on the surface and inside of the fiber. The pore size of these elliptical pores is generally in the range of 50\u2212300 nm, and the porosity can reach 92% [56,77,78].\nFigure 2.

The phase separation caused by the increase in polymer concentration during evaporative cooling and jet drying is a key step in the formation of pores in composite nanofiber sheaths, and if the evaporative drying process of the solvent is slow, then the phase separation process will decelerate, which will reduce the pore distribution density. In coaxial electrospinning, the core and sheath liquid flow rates are different, which affects the pore distribution density. For example, the core feed rate is high, slowing the evaporation of the solution jet and the polymer drying and reducing the pore density.

DCM is a good solvent, whereas DMF is a poor solvent with a very high molecular weight, and the evaporation rate of DCM is much higher than that of DMF during the electrospinning process.

At the freezing temperature of \u22123.6 \u25e6C, the moisture in the air is deposited and frozen on the collector plate, and the interaction of the residual solvent with the moisture in the environment may cause the formation of polygonal concave surfaces on the fiber surface. However, the electrospinning process is extremely short, and not all of the solvent interacts with the moisture in the environment before freeze\u2212drying, creating pores and polygonal craters on the fiber surface. Thus, the porous fiber membranes prepared by TIPS require harsh conditions and are unsuitable for industrial mass production."

A certain amount of diluent was added to the electrospinning precursor and electrospun under a high temperature coil at 300 \u00b0C. The fibers were cooled, leading to phase separation. Finally, the diluent was extracted and removed, and pores appeared on the surface of and inside the fibers. The porous structure was also prepared by electrospinning and the TIPS of polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF, confirming the universal applicability of TIPS. Li et al. [89] prepared polycaprolactone (PCL) porous fibers by using a collector at \u22123.6 \u00b0C. The pores were mainly divided into two types, namely, a circular pore and a shallow polygonal concave surface on the fiber surface. The diameter distribution of the fibers with two different structures is similar, and the average diameters of the pores and the concave surfaces are similar because as the jet reaches the frozen collector, the solvent is freeze\u2212dried before it is completely volatilized and removed after producing pores. At the freezing temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C, the moisture in the air is deposited and frozen on the collector plate, and the interaction of the residual solvent with the moisture in the environment may cause the formation of polygonal concave surfaces on the fiber surface. However, the electrospinning process is extremely short, and not all of the solvent interacts with the moisture in the environment before freeze\u2212drying, creating pores and polygonal craters on the fiber surface. Thus, the porous fiber membranes prepared by TIPS require harsh conditions and are unsuitable for industrial mass production.\n2.5. Selective Removal (SR) Unlike the above pore induction mechanisms, SR is a two\u2212step process requiring post\u2212tr atment, as shown in Figure 6. The first step the electrospinning of the fiber, and the second step is removin the sacrificial component, which requires careful control of the conditions under which the sacrificial phase (in the SR pore\u2212forming mechanism, a certain polymer needs to be removed to prepare a porous structure. For example, Xu uses PAN and PEG as spinning polymers, as well as a sacrificial phase\u2212PEG, thereby preparing porous PAN nanofibers [91]) is removed to maintain the integrity of the fiber backbone [92,93]. Most of the sacrificial components can be removed from the fiber by appropriate extraction or heat treatment, but a small amount of the sacrificial phase may remain in the polymer matrix and affect the performance of the fiber. The pore morphology of porous nanofibers prepared by SR pore\u2212forming mechanism is not uniform, the pore size is generally 5\u221230 nm, and the porosity is more than 85% [65,94].\nPVP and PEO are commonly used polymer materials and can be used as sacrificial components, which are removed by post\u2212treatment (deionized water rinsing or high temperature extraction). We can control the proportion and distribution of pores by changing the sacrificial component content, but when the content exceeds 50%, the fibers removed will no longer be stable, so we must select the right proportion of polymer when preparing the precursor solution. For example, Yan et al. [95] used PAN and PVP as precursor materials for electrospinning, obtained porous carbon nanofibers by heat treatment to remove PVP, and in situ immobilized FeCo2S4 and MXene, which has high electrical conductivity and is a good capacitive material. MXene, which was first reported by Gogotsi\u2019s team in 2011, has ultra\u2212high electrical conductivity, a hydrophilic surface, and high chemical\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 9 of 25\nand mechanical stability [96,97]. Porous carbon nanofibers provide continuous channels for the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions, a shortened transport path, and accelerated ion transport. The porous structure and surface modification endow the prepared carbon nanofibers with excellent electrical conductivity, remarkable ion transport capacity, and excellent electrochemical dynamic properties. The PVP content affects the pore capacity, size, and distribution density and the corresponding diameter, fracture strain, and other properties of the fibers after heat treatment. Methaapanon et al. [98] prepared nanofibers with a core layer PAN/sheath layer ZnO\u2212PVP by electrospinning, and the removal of PVP by high temperature treatment resulted in a porous structure and increased the specific surface area and the crystallinity of ZnO, which led to the enhanced activity of the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB). Ning et al. [99] prepared Ag nanoparticle\u2212coated PEO\u2212polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers and removed the PEO using pure water to obtain porous PVDF nanofibers, and the specific surface area, the pore volume, and the pore size increased first and then decreased with the increase of the PEO molecular weight, which is related to the ratio of the PEO to PVDF content, which increased with the PEO content. These Ag\u2212coated porous PVDF nanofibers have a good photocatalytic degradation activity for methyl orange (MO). Porous structures can be obtained by the selective removal of the sacrificial phase in the post\u2212treatment process, but the requirements for the components of the sacrificial phase and the post\u2212treatment are strict."

            "text": "Photocatalysis is a simple and efficient technology for photocatalysts to remove pollutants by stimulating its oxidation\u2212reduction ability through light. The common photocatalytic particles include CdS [100,101], SnO2 [102,103], AgCl [104], and ZnO [105\u2013107]. Single particles have limited applications due to their own light absorption, the compounding of electron\u2212hole pairs, and lack of specific surface area. Researchers have formed co\u2212catalytic composite systems by compounding two or more photocatalytic materials to compensate for their shortcomings and improve photocatalytic efficiency [108,109]. This system can be divided into type I heterojunctions, type II heterojunctions, type III heterojunctions, Z\u2212scheme heterojunctions, and S\u2212scheme heterojunctions [110\u2013115]. The Z\u2212scheme heterojunction is a compound of electrons from a semiconductor with a low CB and the holes from a semiconductor with a high VB, so that the electrons remain in the semiconductor with a high CB and the holes in the semiconductor with a low VB, promoting the spatial separation of electron\u2212hole pairs [116]. In the S\u2212scheme heterojunction, the CB of a semiconductor with a large negative CB position and the VB of a semiconductor with a large positive VB position retain photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively. Meanwhile, the meaningless photogenerated electrons and holes will be recombined. Therefore, the charge transfer path in this system is a macroscopic \u201cstep,\u201d which makes the heterojunction highly redox capable [117]. The type I, II, and III heterojunctions are different from the Z\u2212scheme and S\u2212scheme heterojunctions in that they all belong to the electron leap to CB of another semiconductor and the hole leap to VB of another semiconductor, rather than the electron\u2212hole complex. For instance, in the type II heterojunction formed by ZnO\u2212In2O3, electrons leap from the VB side of ZnO to the VB side of In2O3, and holes leap from the CB side of In2O3 to the CB side of ZnO, inhibiting the complexation of photogenerated electron\u2212hole pairs [118]. Photocatalytic particles are inevitably lost during the catalytic process, which affects the catalytic performance in the cycle, and sufficient photocatalyst must be added to ensure the catalytic performance, thus increasing the cost. By loading photocatalytic particles onto nanofiber membranes through electrospinning, the loss of catalysts during recycling can be greatly avoided, saving costs and increasing the recycling capacity. Table 1 shows the composition, heterojunction types, and photocatalytic efficiency of several common photocatalytic particle\u2212laden nanofiber membranes.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 10 of 25"

            "heading": "3.1. Organic Pollutants",
            "text": "Organic pollutants are natural organic substances in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and other biodegradable synthetic organic substances as constituent pollutants. Organic pollutants widely exist in water, air, and soil, and only a few can spontaneously degrade. However, the degradation rate of organic pollutants is very slow. This is because they generally have macromolecular chains or benzene rings, which inhibit the growth of organisms and are resistant to light, chemical and biodegradation, so they are difficult to spontaneously degrade in nature. The photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants is a green and clean technology, which has great application prospects.\n3.1.1. Organic Dyes\nThe organic dye compounds in general industrial wastewater are not only very stable under normal conditions but also highly toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic to any organisms. Therefore, these toxic organic dyes must be effectively removed from industrial wastewater to prevent them from harming the ecosystem [129]. Porous fiber membranes loaded with photocatalytic particles were prepared by electrospinning for organic dye removal, which can effectively solve the hazards of organic dyes. The molecular formula of MB is C16H18ClN3S, and its solubility in water is very large. This is because it contains benzene ring, cyano group and methyl group, its structure is relatively stable, and it contains sulfur ions, which can inhibit the growth of bacteria, and its spontaneous degradation is extremely slow [130,131]. MB not only causes changes in water quality, but also causes irreversible damage when it accumulates too much in living organisms. Wu et al. [132] prepared a porous fiber membrane with pan as the skeleton and loaded it with TiO2 nanoparticles by electrospinning. TiO2, as a common photocatalytic material, has been widely used because of its advantages of low cost, good stability, and low toxicity [133,134]. TiO2 has the highest photocatalytic activity. By adding water\u2212soluble polymer PVP and backbone polymer PAN to the electrospinning precursor and removing PVP by washing the fiber membrane with deionized water, a nano\u2212PAN fiber membrane with high porosity on the surface can be obtained, exposing more TiO2 to the fiber surface, which not only increases the accessibility of TiO2 to light and generates more electrons and holes but also increases the contact between the TiO2 and the MB and the reaction active sites, thus improving the photocatalytic efficiency. The prepared pore size of 5\u201340 nm was analyzed by BJH. The pore size not only increased the adsorption of organic dyes but also immobilized the TiO2 particles to a great extent and prevented the shedding of catalysts in the photocatalytic process. The successful preparation of this porous fiber membrane loaded with photocatalytic particles provides a new direction for the design and development of a promising environmental application with adsorption\u2212photocatalysis. The molecular formula of RhB is C28H31ClN2O3. It has more benzene rings, carboxyl\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 11 of 25\ngroups and methyl groups than MB, which means that its structure is very stable and will not degrade spontaneously. Long\u2212term exposure will bring huge harm to human health [135,136]. Gu et al. [119] prepared mesoporous ferroelectric Bi6Fe2Ti3O18 (BFTO) nanofibers with diameters of 100\u2013150 nm by electrostatic spinning and post\u2212treatment calcination. BFTO has a certain absorption intensity in visible light due to its lamellar structure with a proper band gap (2.5 eV). To improve the photocatalytic performance of BFTO, it was uniformly dispersed onto the fiber membrane by combining BFTO with electrostatic spinning. Through the subsequent calcination, many pores appeared on the fiber surface to increase the contact area of the BFTO with the pollutants. Au nanoparticles were also loaded onto the mesoporous BFTO fiber membrane by a simple photodeposition method because the plasma effect on the surface of Au nanoparticles improves the absorption of visible light by the BFTO nanofibers, and Schottky defects are generated at the Au and BFTO interface to promote the separation of electron\u2013hole pairs, thus significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency. To further investigate the effect of the iron polarization of BFTO nanofibers, a series of corona polarization experiments were conducted, and the structures proved that the photocatalytic efficiency of RhB was significantly improved after corona polarization. Therefore, porous Au/BFTO nanofiber membranes subjected to corona polarization have a wide range of application prospects for future industrial wastewater treatment. As shown in Figure 7, Tu et al. [137] selected a PCL with strong mechanical properties as the carrier and prepared PCL/TiO2 porous fiber membranes by electrospinning. Although TiO2 possesses the advantages of low price and good stability, it has poor reusability and may cause secondary pollution. Therefore, porous PCL fiber membranes with a large specific surface area were loaded with TiO2 to enhance the capacity and dispersion of TiO2 and achieve photocatalytic efficiency.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 26\nnanoparticles by electrospinning.

Phenolic Pollutants\nPhenolic compounds are also an important class of wastewater pollutants produced by the chemical, paint, pesticide, biotechnology, and textile industries that can invade the human body through the digestive tract, the respiratory tract, and the skin and bind to proteins in the cellular protoplasm to cause cell inactivation. Nitrophenol is an important organic pollutant with an anti\u2212degradation ability, carcinogenic substances, and mutagenic agents. The molecular formula of nitrophenol is C6H5NO3, and it has functional groups with stable structures such as benzene ring, nitro group, and hydroxyl group, so it is difficult to degrade spontaneously [138,139]. Once nitrophenol enters the human body, it is difficult to degrade and eliminate, making it very harmful to humans and a threaten to all aquatic organisms. As shown in Figure 8, Pradhan et al.

By removing the polymers through calcination, nanofibers with mesoporous structures can be constructed, thus increasing the specific surface area of the photocatalyst and the reactive sites, while mesopores shorten the electron transport path and increase the reactivity.

Given its non\u2212biode radability, excessive toxicity, and carcinogenicity, whic can cause liver damage and lung canc r, the effec ive removal of Cr(VI) from water bodies or the reduction of Cr(VI) to the less toxic Cr(III) has attracted great attention [155]. As sh wn in Figure 12, Lu et al. [156] prepared nanofibers with a porous surface by adding hydrophilic PVP to the electrospun polymer precursor and then synthetically grew \u03b2\u2212hydroxy iron oxide modified metal organic skeleton MIL\u2212100(Fe) (\u03b2\u2212FeOOH@MIL\u2212100(Fe)) photocatalysts in situ on its surface, which resulted in ultra\u2212high MIL\u2212100(Fe) loading through coordination and through good MB and Cr(VI) photocatalytic degradation due to the good dispersion of \u03b2\u2212FeOOH nanorods.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 16 of 25Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 26\nporous materials play an important role in antibacterial [158].

The existence of\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3990 18 of 25\ncore\u2212sheath structure effectively improves the mechanical properties of the nanofibers. Meanwhile, the porous structure of the sheath can increase the contact area and adsorption sites, thus ensuring the adsorption properties of nanofibers. You et al. [165] prepared core\u2212sheath nanofibers with a porous TiO2 skeleton by a combination of self\u2212assembly and electrospinning. The core layer of the porous TiO2 skeleton and sheath layer can significantly improve the mechanical properties of porous nanofiber films. Changing the distribution of pores can also be used to improve the mechanical properties of nanofibers. Some nanofibers with special structures, such as beads\u2212on\u2212the\u2212string nanofibers or Janus nanofibers, also have good mechanical properties. For example, Wang et al. [166] prepared porous bead\u2212on\u2212string poly(lactic acid) fibrous membranes, in which the pores were mainly distributed in beads, for air filtration. Wang et al. [167] prepared electrospun nanofibers with a Janus structure, with pores mainly distributed on one side of the nanofibers. This method can minimize the loss of mechanical properties while ensuring the existence of the porous structure. Similarly, many multiple\u2212chamber nanofibers, which are produced using multiple\u2212fluid electrospinning and have been reviewed in some articles [168\u2013172], can be similarly explored for achieving a general fine mechanical performance with the support from one of the chambers. The mechanical properties of electrospun nanofibers can also be improved by coating the cast film on the electrospun nanofiber film. For example, Liu et al. [173] combined electrospinning with cast membranes, and made comprehensive use of different fiber films, which not only improved the overall mechanical properties, but also enabled the drug to be released slowly and stably through porous structure in the second release stage, so as to achieve biphasic controlled release."

            "text": "In recent years, electrospinning has become a common method of preparing nanofibers with various structures due to its advantages of simple operation and controllability, and nanofibers with various structures can be prepared by changing the number of polymer fluids, the type of electrospinning head, and the working parameters. This paper reviews the formation mechanism of porous fiber membranes prepared by electrospinning: BF, VIPS, NIPS, TIPS, SR. The porous structure can increase the specific surface area of nanofibers and the area in contact with the light source while shortening the electron transport path and increasing the reaction activity, thus showing a wide range of application prospects in photocatalysis. From the perspective of the environment and the economy, loading photocatalytic particles on porous nanofibers can not only effectively remove organic pollutants, heavy metal ions, and harmful bacteria in water and reduce water pollution but also greatly avoid the loss of photocatalysts in recycling and save costs. To improve the application prospects of porous nanofibers loaded with photocatalysts in the catalytic degradation of pollutants in water, the following aspects should be emphasized: (1) more effective methods are needed to construct regular pore structures; (2) the presence of many porous structures on fibers will inevitably have an impact on the mechanical properties of fibers and affect the recyclability of fibers, and the study of a highly effective method for increasing the mechanical properties of fibers will widen the range of applications; and (3) the effective and stable large\u2212scale preparation of porous nanofibers loaded with photocatalysts is also a major challenge in industrial applications at present. With the in\u2212depth research on photocatalysts and electrostatic spinning, these difficulties can be overcome in the near future in order to solve various environmental problems and achieve a sustainable environment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.C., Y.Y. and D.-G.Y.; funding acquisition, Y.Y.; project administration, Y.Y.; writing\u2014original draft, X.C.; W.C. and P.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.Y. and D.-G.Y.
