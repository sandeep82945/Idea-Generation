I., Yogyakarta, 55281, Indonesia, Email trimurtia@ugm.ac.id\nObjective: The cost of treating chronic kidney disease requires large funds. Chronic kidney disease financing ranks 2nd in BPJS as the highest financing. All cost components in the treatment of chronic kidney disease are considered high, so adjustments and efficiency are needed. This study aims to perform a cost analysis in chronic kidney patients. In this article, we will discuss the cost components in treatment and see whether there are differences in the cost of treatment in each hospital. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design with a hospital perspective and was conducted in 6 hospitals selected based on class in different regions: Sardjito Central General Hospital (class A), Yogyakarta Regional General Hospital (class B) and PKU Muhammadiyah Hospital (private class) represent hospitals in regional 1. Meanwhile, Makassar Central General Hospital (class A), Labuang Hospital Baji (class B) and Faisal Islamic Hospital (private class) represent hospitals in regional 3. The study lasted for 14 months from October 2019-December 2020. The total sample involved in this study was 582 samples. The cost components analyzed include hemodialysis costs, serious procedures and operations, services, radiology, laboratories, blood transfusions, drugs, medical devices, hospitalization and supplies. Results: Chronic kidney patient profile data, calculations and cost components are presented descriptively. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to see whether there were differences in costs between hospitals in each region. The results showed that the total cost of treating chronic kidney disease was higher in class A hospitals compared to class B and private class hospitals. Conclusion: The highest cost component is the cost of hemodialysis, followed by severe procedures and services. The highest total cost of hemodialysis reached Rp. Rp.840,132,546, heavy action Rp. 423,156,000 and services Rp. 792,155,000. The results of statistical tests showed that there were differences in the cost of treating chronic kidney disease in hospitals in regional 1 and regional 3 (p < 0.05).

            "text": "Chronic kidney disease is one of the most expensive diseases in Indonesia. The high cost is due to the increasing number of chronic kidney patients from year to year. The community must understand that these high costs can burden the state, in this case, the BPJS as the agency in charge of administering health insurance for people in Indonesia. This disease is developing bad impact and generally cannot recover. Treatment for chronic kidney disease guaranteed by BPJS Health costs trillions of rupiah. In this case, treatment is related to dialysis (hemodialysis) in patients with kidney failure. BPJS Health data in 2017 recorded 3,657,691 dialysis procedures with a total cost of IDR 3.1 trillion. This funding is high in the category of non-communicable disease treatment. Data from the Ministry of Health in 2015 showed that at least until 2015 there were an addition of 2000 new cases per year for chronic kidney patients who were in the final stage and more than 10% of chronic kidney patients underwent hemodialysis. Hemodialysis for chronic kidney patients is routinely done because it is one of the symptomatic therapies. The survival rate of chronic kidney patients increases by undergoing hemodialysis\nClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research 2023:15 621\u2013629 621 \u00a9 2023 Sunariyanti et al.

Several cost analysis studies write that the cost of treating chronic kidney disease in hospitals is high due to the high cost of hemodialysis. More than 1.5 trillion was spent by BPJS in 2014, where chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis cost components ranks 2nd as the largest cost.3 In addition to the cost of hemodialysis, the high cost of treating chronic kidney disease also comes from other components such as the cost of medicines, services and hospitalization costs.4 The cost of the treatment will increase if the patient has a history of disease and comorbidities.5 The high cost of chronic kidney care has an impact on hospitals. The negative difference between total real costs and INA-CBGs rates in hospitals often occurs so that losses are unavoidable. The difference in rates in each hospital class and region also affects this. In this article, the author will discuss the analysis of the cost of chronic kidney care in hospitals, and see the cost components."

This research has received approval from the health research ethical commission at the Jogjakarta city regional general hospital with no.38/KEP/RSUD/VIII/2019. The study used a hospital perspective with a cross-sectional design. Researchers used secondary data. The data was obtained from the collection of patient medical records and data on the cost of treating chronic kidney patients who were hospitalized at several selected hospitals in the period October 2019-December 2020. The total sample involved in this study was 582 samples. The study sample was hospitalized patients in 6 hospitals from different classes and regions who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study was conducted in class A, B and private hospitals. Regional 1 was represented by Sardjito Central General Hospital Yogyakarta (class A), Yogyakarta Regional General Hospital (class B) and PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital (private class). Meanwhile, regional 3 is represented by the Makassar Central General Hospital (class A), Labuang Baji Hospital (class B), Faisal General Hospital (class Private). Sampling was carried out by purposive sampling from patient medical record data and medical cost data for chronic kidney patients receiving treatment. Characteristic data include patient age, gender, class of care, length of stay (LOS), history of comorbid and comorbid diseases, severity. Cost data in the form of costs for severe actions/ operations, visits, services, radiology, laboratories, transfusions, drugs, medical devices, hospitalization, supplies and hemodialysis. Descriptive data analysis is used to describe the profile of chronic kidney patients, components of hospital care costs, total costs and average hospital treatment in regions 1 and 3. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to see whether there was a difference in the total cost of chronic kidney care in each different region."

The treatment class chosen varies from treatment class II to III. Chronic kidney patients have a severity that varies from severity I to III. Chronic kidney disease patients have mild to severe comorbidities with a mean length of stay (LOS) >5 days. Characteristics of chronic kidney disease patients in regional hospitals 1 and 3 are shown in Table 1.\nCost Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease in Class A Hospitals in Regions 1 and 3 Cost analysis was carried out at regional 1 and 3 class A hospitals. The selected hospital will describe the cost components and the difference in total costs between the two hospitals. Patients at the Sardjito Central General Hospital and Makassar Central General Hospital were the samples for hospitals in regional 1 and 3. The results showed that the total cost of treating chronic kidney disease in a class A hospital was quite high. Based on the results of the analysis of the results of the total cost components accumulated in class A hospitals, the total cost of treating chronic kidney disease reaches Rp. 1,259,723,990 with an average of Rp. 14,150,552. The total cost is\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CEOR.S388547 DovePress ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research 2023:15 622\nSunariyanti et al Dovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nDovepress Sunariyanti et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nlower when compared to chronic kidney care in class A hospitals in regional III. The total cost reached Rp. 3,198,367,914 with an average of Rp. 36,889,400. These results provide a significant value of 0.000 which indicates there is a difference in the total cost of treating chronic kidney disease in class A hospitals in regions 1 and III. The results showed that the total cost of chronic kidney care in class A hospitals was quite high. The total cost in each region shows a varying value. Class A hospitals in regional 1 showed that the cost of hemodialysis, severe surgery/operation and laboratory costs were the 3 highest cost components. The total cost of hemodialysis in a class A hospital reached Rp. 246,589,540, with an average of Rp. 2,542,160 \u00b1 Rp. 2,067,865 per patient/year. This value is the highest cost component in a class A hospital in regional 1. The same thing happened in a class A hospital in regional 3. The cost of hemodialysis is the highest cost component with a total cost of Rp. 840,132,546 average cost Rp. 8,661,160\u00b1Rp. 6,653,226 per patient/year. The results of statistical tests showed that there was a difference in the cost of hemodialysis for class A hospitals in regional 1 and regional 3 (p = 0.000). The total difference in average costs incurred between hospitals in regional 1 and 3 reached Rp. 6,119,000. The high cost of hemodialysis in hospitals is because class A hospitals are referral hospitals for other regions,6 where chronic kidney patients undergoing treatment have been in a high level of severity so that they require hemodialysis with a more frequent frequency and sometimes require surgery/severe action to improve the patient\u2019s health. The results of this study are in line with research7 where the cost of hemodialysis in a class A hospital provides a fairly high total cost, it is influenced by the frequency of patients doing hemodialysis. The results of the Azalea 2016 study suggest that chronic kidney patients with a frequency of >3 times per inpatient perform hemodialysis, the total costs incurred are higher than patients with hemodialysis frequency <3 times per inpatient (p = 0.000). Overall, the cost components that show high costs in class A hospitals are the costs of hemodialysis, laboratory, services and severe/surgery procedures and have a significant difference between class A hospitals in both regions 1 and 3. The difference in the cost of chronic kidney disease therapy in Class A hospitals in regions 1 and 3 is shown in Table 2.\nCost Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease in Class B Hospitals in Regions 1 and 3 The cost analysis of chronic kidney disease in a class B hospital was carried out at the Yogyakarta Regional General Hospital for regional 1 and the Labuang Baji Hospital in Makassar for regional 3. From the results obtained, the cost analysis in class B hospitals was quite varied. In contrast to the results in a class A hospital, in this study hemodialysis was not the highest cost component in a class B hospital. In several studies, the cost analysis of chronic kidney disease conducted in a class B hospital showed that the cost of hemodialysis was still the cost component that caused the highest cost. As in research of Tandah8 and Roggeri,9 it was stated that class B hospitals often experience losses and negative differences due to the high cost of hemodialysis in these hospitals. For hospitals in regional 1, the highest cost components are supplies, services and heavy treatment/ operations. As for regional 3, the highest cost components are services, medicines and hospitalization costs. From the results of statistical tests, it can be seen that there is a difference between the total cost of services in regional 1 and regional 3 class B hospitals (p = 0.008). The resulting difference for the total cost of class B hospital services in regions 1 and 3 reached Rp. 24,276,025, a fairly high figure for the difference in rates in the two regions. It can be seen in Table 3 that the average cost of services at a class B hospital in regional 3 is higher than the average cost at a regional 1 hospital. The results of this study indicate that the regional location of the hospital affects the cost of a disease. The second highest cost component in a class B hospital is the cost of supplies, followed by the cost of hospitalization and medicines. The results of this study are in line with several similar studies.10 In his research, it was stated that pharmaceutical supplies in class B hospitals were components that cost quite a lot.

The three cost components showed significant statistical test results (p < 0.05). Overall, the results of the study show that the total cost of treating chronic kidney disease in a class B hospital reaches Rp. 548,497,638 with an average of Rp. 7,660,898. The total cost is lower when compared to chronic kidney care in class A hospitals. The total cost of chronic kidney care in regional III class B hospitals is IDR 541,461,530 with an average of IDR 11,491,446. These results provide a significant value of 0.000. This shows that there is a significant difference in the total cost of class B hospitals in region 1 and region 3. This shows that there is a significant difference in the total cost of class B hospitals in regional 1 and regional 3. The difference in the cost of chronic kidney disease therapy in class B hospitals in regions 1 and 3 is shown in Table 3.\nCost Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease in Private Class Hospitals in Regions 1 and 3 The cost of treating chronic kidney patients in private class hospitals in both regions shows varying costs. The total cost of treating chronic kidney disease in private hospitals is quite high. The results showed that the total cost of treatment in private class hospitals in region 3 was much higher than the private class hospitals in region 1. This was due to the difference in rates in the two regions. From the results, the total cost component accumulated in regional III private hospitals reached Rp. 2,158,646,616 with an average of Rp.23,516,473 The total cost is quite high when compared to chronic kidney care in class A and B hospitals. These results provide a significant value of 0.000 which indicates there is a difference in the total cost of chronic kidney care in private hospitals in the region 1 and 3. Hemodialysis, laboratory costs and inpatient costs are the highest cost components in regional private class hospitals 1. Laboratory costs are high due to variations between one patient and another, especially for patients with comorbidities and various comorbidities.14 For regional 3, services, hospitalization and serious treatment are the highest cost components. The highest total cost in the two regions is the cost of services at regional 3 hospitals with a total value of Rp.792,155,000. This value is much different from the total cost for services at regional 1 hospital which is only Rp.19,540,220 (p = 0.000). This shows that there is a considerable difference between the cost of services at regional 1 and 3 private hospitals. The service rates at regional 3 private hospitals may be due to the different tariff bases in the two regions. This significant difference also occurs in other cost components such as the cost of visits, medicines, medical devices and hospitalization. Several previous studies have written that often the total cost in private class hospitals is higher than government-owned hospitals. Private class hospitals are said to have a different tariff range from government-owned hospitals. Tabrani\u2019s 2016 research suggests that there is no difference between government-owned and private hospitals in setting rates. There is no difference in operating costs incurred by class A, B or private hospitals for chronic kidney disease. The difference is often the investment costs where private hospitals do not get the same funding as government-owned hospitals. Privately owned hospitals fund themselves in terms of hospital operations.15 The high cost of treatment in private class hospitals and the differences in each region should be an evaluation material for the government and the hospital to set rates according to the actual unit cost calculation.16 The hospital was asked to be even better in managing funds and making adjustments in accordance with a clinical pathway that was based. The difference in the cost of therapy for chronic kidney disease in the private class in regions 1 and 3 is shown in Table 4."

            "text": "Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the total cost of chronic kidney disease in class A hospitals is higher than class B and private hospitals. The highest component of treatment costs was in a class A hospital. Hemodialysis, severe surgery and services were the components with the highest cost compared to other cost components. The highest total cost of hemodialysis reached Rp.840,132,546, severe treatment Rp. 423,156,000 and services Rp. 792,155,000. The results of statistical tests for the three components showed significant results. It can be concluded that there are differences in the total cost of chronic kidney care for the three components in regions 1 and 3 (p < 0.05).\nClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research 2023:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/CEOR.S388547 DovePress\n627\nDovepress Sunariyanti et al\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nTable 4 Differences in the Cost of Chronic Kidney Disease Therapy for Private Class Hospitals in Regions 1 and 3\nCost Component Regional I Regional III p\nn Total Cost (Rp) Average (Rp) SD % n Total Cost (Rp) Average (Rp) SD %\nHeavy action and surgery 45 Rp 18.489.300 Rp 190.611 Rp 615.294 3.5% 41 Rp 241.868.300 Rp 2.493.488 Rp 4.162.617 11.2% 0.053\nVisit 94 Rp 35.847.500 Rp 369.562 Rp 239.251 6.8% 96 Rp 92.880.000 Rp 957.526 Rp 708.584 4.3% 0.000\nServices 97 Rp 19.540.220 Rp 201.446 Rp 197.282 3.7% 97 Rp 792.155.000 Rp 8.166.546 Rp 6.812.752 36.7% 0.000\nRadiology 71 Rp 14.692.200 Rp 151.466 Rp 149.590 2.8% 52 Rp 15.785.000 Rp 162.732 Rp 267.835 0.7% 0.631\nLaboratory 97 Rp 88.960.660 Rp 917.120 Rp 628.253 16.9% 96 Rp 75.617.000 Rp 779.557 Rp 586.667 3.5% 0.118\nTransfusion 44 Rp 44.898.000 Rp 462.866 Rp 783.494 8.5% 48 Rp 37.825.000 Rp 389.948 Rp 470.741 1.8% 0.390\nDrugs 97 Rp 46.663.662 Rp 481.069 Rp 392.810 8.9% 97 Rp 143.769.804 Rp 1.482.163 Rp 1.168.151 6.7% 0.000\nMedical Equipment 96 Rp 21.433.822 Rp 220.967 Rp 342.842 4.1% 93 Rp 105.267.499 Rp 1.085.232 Rp 1.030.157 4.9% 0.000\nInpatient 96 Rp 70.908.600 Rp 731.016 Rp 541.043 13.4% 97 Rp 422.541.250 Rp 4.356.095 Rp 3.501.095 19.6% 0.000\nSupplies 95 Rp 32.515.742 Rp 335.214 Rp 386.494 6.2% 94 Rp 32.924.314 Rp 342.962 Rp 271.113 1.5% 0.170\nHemodialysis 88 Rp 133.292.400 Rp 1.514.686 Rp 758.772 25.3% 60 Rp 198.013.450 Rp 3.300.224 Rp 2.123.026 9.2% 0.000\nAverage total cost 97 Rp 527.242.105 Rp 5.576.024 Rp 5.035.126 100% 97 Rp 2.158.646.616 Rp 23.516.473 Rp 21.102.737 100% 0.000\nAbbreviations: Regional I, RS PKU Muhammadiyah; Regional III, Rumah Sakit Islam Faisal.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/C EO R .S388547 D ovePress\nC linicoEconom ics and O utcom es Research 2023:15 628\nSunariyanti et al D ovepress\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"
