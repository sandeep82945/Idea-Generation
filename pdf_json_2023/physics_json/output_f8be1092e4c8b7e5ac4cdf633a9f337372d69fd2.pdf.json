    "abstractText": "Tungsten oxide has received considerable attention as photo-anode in photo-assisted water splitting due to its considerable advantages such as significant light absorption in the visible region, good catalytic properties, and stability in acidic and oxidative conditions. The present paper is a first step in a detailed study of the mechanism of porous WO3 growth via anodic oxidation. In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) during oxidation of W illuminated with UV and visible light are employed to study the ionic and electronic processes in slightly acidic sulfate-fluoride electrolytes and a range of potentials 4\u201310 V. The respective responses are discussed in terms of the influence of fluoride addition on ionic and electronic process rates. A kinetic model is proposed and parameterized via regression of experimental data to the EIS and IMPS transfer functions.",

Introduction\nTungsten oxide (WO3) has received considerable attention as photo-anode in photoelectrochemical water splitting due to its considerable advantages, such as significant light absorption in the visible region, good catalytic properties, and stability in acidic and oxidative conditions [1\u20136]. A low cost, relatively simple route of fabricating nanoporous tungsten oxide is based on anodization and was first described by Mukherjee et al. [7]. In addition to the promise of nanoporous WO3 for greatly enhancing electro- and photocatalytic properties, the electrochemical process has the advantage of being easily reproducible and under precise control. A range of papers has been dedicated to the tuning of synthesis conditions in order to maximize the light absorption and photo-catalytic properties of the obtained nanoporous layers [8\u201316]. However, all these studies have remained largely empirical, and the exact mechanism of pore nucleation and growth is still under debate. More than a decade ago, a systematic study of the initial stages of anodic oxidation of valve metals such as W, Ti, and Mo was started in our group, aiming at the development and parameterization of a deterministic model of the process [17\u201322]. The proposed model was successfully validated by quantitative comparison to electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) data and key parameter values pertinent to oxide growth, restructuring, and dissolution were estimated. The present paper aims at characterizing the ionic and electronic processes during oxidation of W in sulfate-fluoride electrolytes under illumination using a combination of in-situ electrochemical (voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS) and photo-electrochemical (energy spectroscopy of modulated photocurrent and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, IMPS) methods backed up with chemical information on the obtained oxides from ex-situ XPS. In that context, it is noteworthy to mention\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28217387 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387 2 of 16\nthat even if IMPS was extensively used for ex-situ characterization of tungsten oxides by other authors [23\u201331], only two papers employ the method in-situ during anodization, and the response is discussed only qualitatively [32,33]. A new version of the kinetic model describing oxide growth and dissolution is parameterized by regression of experimental data to the respective EIS and IMPS transfer functions, and conclusions are drawn concerning the usefulness of the proposed approach in building a complete model of the pore initiation process.\n2.

The regions of active dissolution (0\u20130.6 V), passivation (0.6\u20131.0 V), and passivity (1.0\u20138.0 V) are clearly observed. In the passivity region, the current density is quasiindependent on potential, indicating chemical dissolution of the oxide as the rate-controlling step. The current density at constant potential increases quasi-linearly with fluoride concentration (a slope of 1.06 is observed for all potentials, Figure 1b). The concentration of W(VI) in the solution after 1 h of polarization in the range of potentials 4\u201310 V, estimated by ICP-OES, is almost independent of potential and increases with fluoride concentration in the electrolyte, i.e., fluoride accelerates chemical dissolution of the oxide (Figure 1c). pH measurements of solutions before and after anodic oxidation indicate the formation of tungstic acid as a stable soluble product, in agreement with theoretical pH calculations (Figure 1d). It is worth mentioning that calculations with fluoro-tungstic acid were not possible due to the lack of reliable thermodynamic data.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387 2 of 16\nelectrochemical (energy spectroscopy of modulated photocurrent and intensity modulated\nphotocurrent spectroscopy, IMPS) methods backed up with chemical information on the ob-\ntained oxides from ex-situ XPS.

Three time constants are observed in the spec-\ntra, in analogy to previous measurements [17,18]. According to the qualitative interpreta-\ntion proposed in those works, the high-frequency time constant is related to charge trans-\nfer and migration of current carriers in the oxide, the pseudo-inductive loop at medium\nfrequencies corresponds to point defect interaction enhancing ionic migration, and the\nlow-frequency time constant corresponds to the passivation reaction (its resistance is negative\nat potentials lower than 4 V, i.e., in the passivation region [17,18], the negative t ndency being\nobserved also in the present work with 0.05 mol dm\u22123 NH4F).

Surface Composition of the Oxides\nThe surface chemical composition of the oxides formed in the present conditions was\ncharacterized with XPS. Due to the fact that the detailed spectra in the interval 4\u201310 V are\nqualitatively similar, only data for a potential of 4.0 V are shown for the sake of brevity in\nFigure 7 (W4f and O1s spectra) and Figure 8 (N1s and S2p spectra).\nW4f spectra indicate the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxide containing mainly\nW(VI) and some amount of W(V). Peaks of W(0) are also observed at 4.0 V, except for the\nfilms formed in sulfate, which indicates that the oxide thickness is smaller than the free\npath of photoelectrons through the oxide (of the order of 4 nm).\nO1s spectra confirm the formation of defective WO3 with an O-W ratio of 2.6\u20132.8,\nwith some degree of hydration at the surface. S2p spectra are consistent with a certain\namount of adsorbed sulfate (ca. 8\u201310%), whereas N1s spectra indicate both NH4+ and NH3,\nthe former predominating (ca. 14\u201315%). Conversely to what was found in anodic oxides\non Ti formed in fluoride-containing solutions [20,21], the concentration of fluoride at the\nsurface of anodic oxides of W was close to the detection limit.\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n1K 1001010.1\n0.011K 100\n101 0.1\n0.01\n10k\n1k 100\n101 0.1\n0.01\n1K 100\n101 0.1\n0.01 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0\nIm ( F\n) / m\nA c\nm -2\nRe(F) / mA cm-2\n0.0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n1K 100101 0.1 0.01\n10K\nK100101\n0.1 0.01\n10K\n1K 100\n101\n0.1 0.01\n10K\n1K 100\n101\n0.1 0.01 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0\nIm ( F\n) / m\nA c\nm -2\nRe(F) / mA cm-2\n0.01\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n1K 10010 1 0.10.03\n11K 1K10010 1 0.1 0.02\n10K 1K100 0 1 0.1 0.03\n10K\n1K10010\n1\n0.1\n4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0\n-I m\n( F\n) / m\nA c\nm -2\nRe(F) / mA cm-2\n0.05\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n1K\n10010 1\n0.1\n0.01 1K10011\n0.1\n0.01\n10K\n1K 100101\n0.1\n0.0110K\n1K1 0101\n0.1\n0.01\n4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0\nIm ( F\n) / m\nA c\nm -2\nRe(F) / mA cm-2\n0.025\nFigure 5.

Surface Composition of the Oxides\nThe surface chemical composition of the oxides formed in the present conditions was\ncharacterized with XPS. Due to the fact that the detailed spectra in the interval 4\u201310 V are\nqualitatively similar, only data for a potential of 4.0 V are shown for the sake of brevity in\nFigure 7 (W4f and O1s spectra) and Figure 8 (N1s and S2p spectra).\nW4f spectra indicate the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxide containing mainly\nW(VI) and some amount of W(V). Peaks of W(0) are also observed at 4.0 V, except for the\nfilms formed in sulfate, which indicates that the oxide thickness is smaller than the free\npath of photoelectrons through the oxide (of the order of 4 nm).\nO1s spectra confirm the formation of defective WO3 with an O-W ratio of 2.6\u20132.8,\nwith some degree of hydration at the surface. S2p spectra are consistent with a certain\namount of adsorbed sulfate (ca. 8\u201310%), whereas N1s spectra indicate both NH4+ and NH3,\nthe former predominating (ca. 14\u201315%).

Discussion 3.1. A Model for Film Growth and Tungsten Dissolution\nThe main assumption of the proposed model, based on the experimental results obtained is that non-stoichiometric WO3, containing significant amounts of W(V) in the cation sublattice is formed on W, whereas an appreciable concentration of oxygen vacancies is present in the anion sublattice. The formation of the oxide proceeds at the metal/film interface with oxidation of the metal and generation of oxygen vacancies [22]:\nWm kO \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 [WO3](3V\u2022\u2022O ) + 6e\u2212m (1)\nThe oxygen vacancies are transported through the barrier film via high-field migration and are consumed at the film/solution interface by incorporation of an oxygen ion at this interface:\n[WO3](3V\u2022\u2022O ) + 3H2O k2O \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192WO3 + 6H+aq (2)\nDissolution of the barrier film occurs at its interface with the solution, ensuring a constant barrier film thickness at a given potential in steady state:\nWO3 + 6H++yF\u2212 kd \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192WO3Fy y\u2212 ,aq + 3H2O (3)\nFurther, at the barrier film/solution interface, W(V) either undergoes oxidative dissolution to soluble W(VI) or transforms into a W(VI) intermediate that dissolves isovalently. Cation vacancies are generated by both reaction sequences:\nWV\u2032w +yF \u2212 aq + 3H2O k2 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192WO3Fy y\u2212 ,aq+e\u2032+ VW6 \u2032 + 6H+ (4)\nWV\u2032W k31 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192W(VI)ad+e\u2032+ VW 6\u2032 (5)\nW(VI)ad + yF \u2212 aq + 3H2O k32 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192WO3Fy y\u2212 ,aq + 6H+ (6)\nAll the reactions at the film/solution interface leading to the formation of soluble W ions proceed with the participation of anions, whereas the reaction of formation of WO3 involves water as a source for oxygen. Thus, the surface is divided into dissolution and growth regions, which can lead to its local perturbation and nanopore initiation. However, it is assumed that in the present conditions, the growth/dissolution reaction is predominating, ensuring the homogeneity of the steady-state thickness at a given potential. In addition, recombination of cation and oxygen vacancies re-creates the perfect lattice via the inverse Schottky reaction [17\u201322]:\n3V\u2022\u2022O +VW 6\u2032 krec\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192null (7)\nThe material balance for cation vacancies at the barrier layer/electrolyte interface can be written in terms of the variation of the excess negative surface charge (qn) with time:\ndqn dt\n= IM,F/S \u2212 IM \u2212 IOSqn = IOS (\nIM,F/S \u2212 IM IOS\n\u2212 qn ) , S = 1\nF\u03b2O (8)\n\u03b2O being the surface concentration of oxygen vacancies, IM/,F/S, IM and IO-the instantaneous currents of cations at that interface, cations and anions in the bulk oxide. The charge balance for cations at the film/solution interface is expressed by the following equation:\nIM 6F = JM = k2\u03b35 + k32\u03b36\u2217 (9)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387 10 of 16\n\u03b35 and \u03b36* being the surface fractions occupied by W(V) and W(VI)ad. The material balances read as:\n\u03b2d\u03b35 dt = IM 6F \u2212 k2\u03b35 \u2212 k31\u03b35, \u03b2d\u03b36\u2217 dt = k31\u03b35 \u2212 k32\u03b36\u2217 (10)\n\u03b2 being the surface concentration of cation positions. Accordingly, the steady-state current is given by the expression [22]:\nI = I0 + IM = 6F k322(k2 + k31) 2 + k2d(k31 + k32) 2\n(k31 + k32)[k32(k2 + k31) + kd(k31 + k32)]\nk2 = k02 exp(b2E), k31 = k 0 31 exp(b31E), b2 = \u03b12\u03b1F RT , b31 = \u03b131\u03b1F RT\n(11)\nThe steady-state value of a particular variable x is marked x, as customary. The impedance of ion migration in the oxide is a parallel combination of the impedances due to oxygen and cation transport via vacancy mechanism. The faradic impedance due to migration of anion vacancies is derived as [22]:\nZO, f\u22121 = 4FaI0 RT (\nLE=0 + (1\u2212\u03b1) \u2192 E\nE )[(1\u2212 \u03b1) + I0S\u03b1 j\u03c9 + I0S ] (12)\nIn this equation,\u03c9 is the angular frequency, a is the half-jump distance, \u03b1 is the part of the applied potential consumed at the film/solution interface, and LE=0 is the steady-state thickness at a potential of 0 V, F, R, and T having their usual meanings.\nIn turn, the following equation is obtained for the total impedance due to anion transport:\nZO = ZO, f + 1\nj\u03c9C0 , C0 =\n( IO + IM ) (1\u2212 \u03b1) IO \u2192 E Vm 4F\n(13)\nwhere C0 is a pseudo-capacitance due to modulation of thickness by the ac signal, and Vm is the molar volume of the oxide (taken as equal to that of WO3, i.e., 32.3 cm3 mol\u22121). The impedance of transport of cation vacancies is written in complete analogy to (12) as:\nZM, f\u22121 = 4FaIM RT (\nLE=0 + (1\u2212\u03b1) \u2192 E\nE )[(1\u2212 \u03b1) + I0S\u03b1 j\u03c9 + I0S ] (14)\nFurther, the impedance due to the dissolution of cations at the barrier layer/solution interface is derived from (9) and (10) written for a small-amplitude sine-wave perturbation around a steady state:\nZM,F/S = 16Fb2k2\u03b35 1 + b31k31(k2\u2212k31)( 1+j ( \u03c9\u03b2k2b2\nb2k32k2+b31k 2 31\n))( b2k2k32+b31k 2 31+k31k2(b2\u2212b31)\n) \n\u03b35 = k322(k2+k31)\n(k31+k32)[k32(k2+k31) + kd(k31+k32)]\n(15)\nThe total impedance is then expressed as follows:\nZ = Rel + [ 1 Ze + 1 ZO + 1 ZM, f + ZM,F/S ]\u22121 (16)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387 11 of 16\nwhere Rel the uncompensated electrolyte resistance and Ze is the impedance of electronic properties of the oxide. This impedance was derived on the basis of steady-state profiles of predominant point defects [20] in the following form:\nZe = a\nj\u03c9\u03b5\u03b50 ln\n1 + j\u03c9 RTk2OF2DekO \u03b5\u03b50 exp\n[ LE=0+\n(1\u2212\u03b1) \u2192 E E\na ] 1 + j\u03c9 RTk2OF2DekO \u03b5\u03b50\n(17)\nIn the last equation, De is the diffusion coefficient of electronic current carriers, \u03b5 is the dielectric constant of the oxide, and \u03b50 is the dielectric permittivity of free space. Fits to Equations (12)\u2013(17) are shown in Figures 2\u20135 with solid lines and illustrate the ability of the model to account for the magnitude and the frequency distribution of the impedance spectra in all studied conditions. The main kinetic parameters are presented in Figure 9a,b as a function of fluoride concentration, whereas the parameters not influenced by fluoride are collected in Table 1. The reaction orders of the individual steps are marked in the figure and indicate the important influence of fluoride on the process rates in agreement with experiment. The increase of the field strength in the oxide with fluoride concentration is in line with the larger oxide growth rates due to higher layer dissolution rates in the presence of fluoride. Further, the importance of the part of the potential consumed as drop at the film/solution interface (\u03b1) is higher in the presence of fluoride, which once more indicates the intensification of dissolution processes at that interface.\nolecules 2023, 28, 7387 11 of 16\n0 2\n02\n20 02\n(1 )\n1 exp\nln\n1\nE O\ne O\ne O\ne O\nL E RTk Ej F D k a\na Z\nRTkj j D k\n\n \n  \n    \n      \n\n\n(17)\nl st equation, De is the diffusion coefficient of electronic current carriers, \u03b5 is\nth dielectric constan of the oxide, and \u03b50 is th diele tric permi ivity of free space.\nin a l studied conditions.

While not all the kinetic parameters (q1, q3, and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387 13 of 16\nq4) can be unequivocally determined from the present data, it can be speculated from the modeling results that the following sequence of reactions takes place:\nh\u03bd\u2192 h\u2022 + e\u2032\nWVW \u2032 + h\u2022 q1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192WVIW WVIW + W VI W q4 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u21922W6+aq WVIW + e \u2032 q3 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192WVW\u2032\n(21)\nThe presence of an adsorbed intermediate acting as a surface state is confirmed by the values of the Css, which are several times higher than those of the Helmholtz capacitance CH (the latter preserves values of 25\u201330 \u00b5F cm\u22122 regardless of the conditions). In general, it can be concluded that IMPS measurements represent an important contribution to the elucidation of the mechanism of anodic oxidation of tungsten and merit wider utilization in the future.\n4. Materials and Methods Anodic oxidation was performed in electrolytes containing 1 mol dm\u22123 (NH4)2SO4 + 0, 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5 mol dm\u22123 NH4F at 22\u00b1 1 \u25e6C in naturally aerated conditions. The electrolytes were prepared from p.a. chemicals and type 2 de-ionized water. Working electrodes were cut from W sheets (99.99%, Goodfellow, Cambdrige, UK). Their pretreatment consisted of degreasing, chemical polishing for 60 s in 0.1 mol dm\u22123 KOH, and drying. A PTFE cell featuring a fused silica optical window (Edmund Optics, York, UK, transmittance 200\u20131000 nm) was employed for all the measurements. The 3-electrode cell featured a Pt sheet (99.9%, Goodfellow, UK) counter electrode and 3M KCl/AgCl/Ag reference electrode (LL-type, Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland, E = 0.2 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Electrochemical measurements (linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry at constant potential, and EIS) were performed using a CompactStat 10800 (Ivium Technologies, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a frequency response analysis module. Impedance spectra were measured in potentiostatic mode after a steady state current was reached, typically in a frequency range 5 mHz\u201322 kHz at an ac amplitude of 15 mV (rms). Linearity was verified by measuring spectra at selected potentials with amplitudes 5\u201320 mV, whereas causality was ensured by a Kramers\u2013Kronig test embedded in the measurement software. Points that did not pass the test (usually at both frequency ends) were rejected. Energy spectra of modulated photocurrent were registered by a 100 W Xe lamp (Newport 66909, Crewe, UK), a grating monochromator (Newport 77250, UK) and a 418 chopper (Bentham, Lancaster, UK) as a modulated light source (typically at 12 Hz) in the interval of light wavelengths 300\u2013700 nm. Photocurrents were detected by a 5210EC lock-in analyzer (Signal Recovery, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) controlled by in-house designed routine on a LabView platform and coupled to a PAR 263A potentiostat (Ametek, Berwyn, PA, USA) driven by Power Suite 2.40 software. The intensity of incident light was measured with a power meter (Gamma Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA) to transform photocurrent into intensity-to-photocurrent conversion efficiency. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was performed using a CompactStat 10800 coupled to a Modulight photo-diode array source (Ivium Technologies, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with peak wavelengths 365 and 395 nm at an incident light power of 17 mW cm\u22122, driven by IviumSoft 4.98 software. The ac amplitude of the light intensity was set at 10% of the dc value at the corresponding wavelength. Frequency range was from 5 mHz to 22 kHz. Non-linear least squares fitting of EIS and IMPS data to selected transfer functions by Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm was performed using in-house elaborated routine on an Originlab platform. Chemical composition of the oxide films at the surface was assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Escalab II spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 radiation (1486.6 eV) at a base pressure of 10\u22127 Pa. Detailed spectra of C1s, N1s, O1s,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7387 14 of 16\nF1s, S2p, and W4f were obtained at a band pass energy of 20 eV, and binding energies were calibrated vs. the C1s peak at 285.0 eV. To estimate chemical composition, spectra were fitted to Gaussian\u2013Lorentzian peak functions after Shirley background subtraction using XPSPeak 4.1 software. The concentration of soluble tungsten generated during oxidation was measured with an ICP-OES apparatus (Prodigy, Teledyne Leeman Labs, Mason, OH, USA).\n5. Conclusions\nIn the present paper, the multi-method characterization and deterministic modeling of the anodic oxidation of tungsten in sulfate-fluoride electrolytes are described. The following conclusions concerning the correspondence between experimental characterization and modeling can be drawn:\n\u2022 Electrochemical data (current vs. potential curves and impedance spectra in a wide range of potentials and fluoride concentrations) give the possibility to estimate the rate constants at the oxide/electrolyte interface and the transport parameters through the oxide layer. Reaction orders vs. fluoride indicate the active participation of the anion in the oxidation and dissolution processes. \u2022 The validity of the obtained estimates is in accordance with surface composition data obtained by XPS. Conversely to what is observed with titanium, the concentration of fluoride at the surface is rather low, i.e., it can be regarded as a catalytic species. \u2022 Electronic carrier dynamics during film growth and dissolution is assessed using IMPS measurements in a wide range of potentials. A qualitative relationship between phenomenological parameters obtained from a generalized interpretation of the IMPS response and the sequence of charge transfer reactions at the interface is tentatively proposed. \u2022 Further extension of this type of measurements is needed in order to quantify the relation between photo-induced charge transfer/recombination of electronic carriers, on one hand, and generation, transport, and consumption of ionic point defects, on the other.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.B. and I.B.; methodology, M.B.; validation, I.B. and V.K.; formal analysis, Y.P. and I.B.; investigation, Y.P. and V.K.; resources, M.B.; data curation, Y.P. and V.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.P. and I.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.B.; visualization, I.B.
