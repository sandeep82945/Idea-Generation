However, the evidence for this association in preschool children\nis limited. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms that explain the relationship\nbetween preschool children\u2019s negative affect and social skills remain less\nunderstood. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to examine the\nmoderating role of the teacher\u2013child relationship in the associations between\nnegative affect and social skills of Chinese preschoolers. A sample of 198\npreschool children (Mage = 58.64 \u00b1 3.83 months, 53% boys), recruited from 13 classes in two public kindergartens in Shanghai, China, participated\nin this 1-year longitudinal study. The mothers reported children\u2019s negative\naffect, while the teachers reported children\u2019s social skills and the teacher\u2013\nchild relationship. Results of a series of moderating effect analyses showed\nthat (1) T1 negative affect could significantly negatively predict T2 social\nskills (cooperation, self-control, and assertion), and (2) the associations\nbetween negative affect and social skills were moderated by the teacher\u2013child\nrelationship (including teacher\u2013child closeness and conflict). Specifically, a\nhigh level of teacher\u2013child closeness buffered the prediction of negative\naffect on social skills, while a high level of teacher\u2013child conflict aggravated\nthe said prediction. The findings highlight the importance of the teacher\u2013child\nrelationship in the development of children\u2019s social skills during preschool age\nwhen they have a high level of negative affect. This has important implications\nfor the development of interventions to improve teacher\u2013child relationships\nand children\u2019s social skills.\nKEYWORDS\nnegative affect, social skills, teacher-child relationship, preschool children, China\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Social skills refer to a complex set of skills and behaviors that empower an individual to interact appropriately with others and avoid unaccepted responses (Aksoy and Baran, 2010). Preschool children\u2019s social skills can be measured by assessing their cooperation, self-control, and assertion (Gresham et al., 2011; Maleki et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2022). Cooperation refers to children interacting with others in an organized way, such as helping others, forming friendships, and following social rules. Self-control is defined as children expressing emotions or other social behaviors appropriately in various social situations. Assertion refers to initiating behaviors such as children introducing themselves and seeking information from others.\nPreschool children transition from home to kindergarten and social skills are necessary to better adapt to social life, which largely determines their future social adjustment (Zhu Y. T. et al., 2021). A high level of social skills during preschool age can help children internalize social rules, acquire positive social behaviors, and interact with peers effectively (Hosokawa and Katsura, 2017; Hukkelberg et al., 2019). However, deficits in social skills may lead to a series of adaptation problems, such as problem behaviors, loneliness, depression, and even violence (Ziv, 2013; Davis and Qi, 2020; Kamper-DeMarco et al., 2020; Garc\u00eda-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2022). According to the direct linear effects model of children\u2019s development, temperament can directly affect children\u2019s social and emotional development. Some extreme temperaments, such as negative affect and extroversion, can result in poor social adaptation in children (Sanson et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2014). Thus, it is crucial to explore the influence of the negative affect component of temperament on children\u2019s social skills and determine the key protective and risk factors.\nNegative affect and social skills\nTemperament refers to constitutionally based individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation, and it is a core feature that affects personality, emotion, and social behaviors (Rothbart, 2011; Eivers et al., 2012). Among all the aspects of temperament, reactivity refers to the behavioral intensity and frequency of response to stimuli (De Pauw and Mervielde, 2010). It includes two response systems: negative affect and positive affect (Rothbart and Bates, 2006). Negative affect is characterized by irritability, depression, high intensity of negative reactions, and difficulty in appeasement (e.g., anger, fear, frustration, distress owing to one\u2019s limitations, and sadness; Putnam et al., 2008). Children with high levels of negative affect are often accompanied by emotional instability and other adjustment problems, which will directly affect their social interactions, leading to increased behavioral problems, and social maladjustment (Peterson et al., 2018). Negative affect is\nclosely related to children\u2019s poor social adjustment (Taylor et al., 2014; Barone et al., 2019; Acar et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2021). Studies of infants and young children have shown that children with higher levels of anger and frustration in early life tend to exhibit more impulsive and aggressive behaviors and develop poor social relationships and social skills (Jones et al., 2002). Children\u2019s temperament is also closely related to certain subsocial skills. For example, negative affect among infants and toddlers can predict their poor self-regulation (Raikes et al., 2007; Putnam et al., 2008). Qian et al. (2020) investigated twochild families and found that emotionality, activity, reactivity, social inhibition, and concentration among first-born children were significantly correlated with cooperation.\nMost of the abovementioned studies have focused on infants and adolescents, and few studies have addressed the relationship between negative affect and social skills in preschool children. Given that preschool years are a critical stage for the development of children\u2019s social interactions and social skills (Kutnick et al., 2007; Maleki et al., 2019), it is meaningful to explore the influence of negative affect on preschool children\u2019s social skills to promote social interactions. In this study, we explored the influence of preschool children\u2019s negative affect on their social skills. Based on the previous studies, we hypothesized that preschool children\u2019s negative affect would be negatively associated with all three indices (cooperation, self-control, and assertion) of their social skills."

            "text": "Although ample evidence has shown that many children with a high level of negative affect experience a host of social and emotional difficulties, it is also important to stress that not all children with a high level of negative affect will experience problems with social interactions. Several theoretical models have shown that some environmental and individual protective factors can guard against these problems, while certain risk factors can promote them.\nAccording to the developmental systems theory, the development of children\u2019s social skills is influenced by internal (e.g., temperament) and external (e.g., family and school) environmental factors, with children\u2019s internal characteristics dynamically interacting with the external environment for their development (Myers and Pianta, 2008). Since preschool children spend considerable time at daycare, teachers become the primary people at this stage. The attachment theory also stresses that preschool teachers play a crucial role in children\u2019s development during preschool age (Pianta, 1999).\nThe teacher\u2013child relationship quality refers to the affective nature of children\u2019s interactions with their teachers and can be typically divided into two aspects: teacher\u2013child closeness and teacher\u2013child conflict (Baardstu et al., 2022).\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nTeacher\u2013child closeness is characterized by warm and open communication between teachers and children, which can help children establish a sense of security and belonging, and acts as a protective factor in their development (O\u2019Connor et al., 2011; Verschueren and Koomen, 2012). In contrast, teacher\u2013child conflict is manifested by tense, negative, and hostile communication in the teacher\u2013child relationship, which increases the risk of children\u2019s social maladjustment (Buyse et al., 2011; Coplan et al., 2020). Tensions in the teacher\u2013 child relationship also reduce the frequency and quality of teacher\u2013child interactions, thus reducing the opportunities for children to acquire social skills. Some empirical studies have shown that the teacher\u2013child relationship in early childhood years plays an important role in children\u2019s social and emotional competence (Wu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020; Paes et al., 2021; Baardstu et al., 2022). For example, Liu et al. (2020) used a cross-lagged analysis and found that toddlers\u2019 teacher\u2013 child relationship had a direct effect on their social skills. Baardstu et al. (2022) found that a close teacher\u2013child relationship among 5-year-old children predicted their social competence at 8 years.\nThere may also be an interaction effect between children\u2019s temperament and the teacher\u2013child relationship on their social skills. That is, the influence of children\u2019s negative affect on their development may be protected by a positive, or intensified by a negative teacher\u2013child relationship. Although few studies have confirmed this conclusion, certain theoretical models or similar studies have suggested that there may be an interaction between the two variables. According to the differential susceptibility model, individuals have different sensitivities to the external environment. Individuals with a susceptible temperament (e.g., negative affect) are more sensitive to both adverse and favorable environments, as compared to their counterparts. Preschool children with a high level of negative affect may perform better in a favorable environment and worse in an adverse environment as compared to typically developing children (Belsky, 1997; Belsky et al., 2007). From this perspective, a conflicted teacher\u2013child relationship is a risk factor that can hinder the development of social skills among children with a high level of negative affect. A close teacher\u2013child relationship may play a moderating role between children\u2019s negative affect and social skills, which can buffer the negative influence of negative affect on children\u2019s social skills. Some empirical studies have revealed similar conclusions. For example, a study of 7-year-old children in Turkey found that highly conflicted student\u2013teacher relationships had a moderating effect on the association between shyness and aggressive behavior. For children with low levels of shyness, the higher level of teacher\u2013child conflict, the more aggressive behaviors they experienced. For children with high levels of shyness, the teacher\u2013child closeness alleviated the maladjustment caused by the shy temperament (Acar et al., 2018). Baardstu et al. (2022) also found that teacher\u2013child\ncloseness had a buffering influence on shy preschool children\u2019s social adjustment difficulties. A study of primary school children found that student\u2013teacher relationships could buffer the negative influence of difficult temperament on their peer interactions (e.g., aggression behaviors and peer victimization; Rudasill et al., 2013). Therefore, it was hypothesized that teacher\u2013child relationships (closeness and conflict) have a moderating effect on the relationship between negative affect and preschool children\u2019s social skills."

However, most prior studies focused on children\u2019s negative affect on their problem behaviors (Crawford et al., 2011; Affrunti and Woodruff-Borden, 2016; Davies et al., 2021), or other aspects of their temperament (e.g., effort control, inhibition) on their social adjustment (Klein et al., 2018; Zhu J. et al., 2021).

Against this background, this study aimed to examine the associations between children\u2019s negative affect, social skills, and teacher\u2013child relationships, and the interactions between these variables. Specifically, the following hypotheses and moderating model (Figure 1) were proposed: children\u2019s negative affect will negatively predict their social skills (Hypothesis 1), teacher\u2013 child closeness will alleviate the negative prediction of children\u2019s negative affect on their social skills (Hypothesis 2), and teacher\u2013 child conflict will intensify the negative prediction of children\u2019s negative affect on their social skills (Hypothesis 3)."

            "text": "Although previous studies have demonstrated the associations between different components of children\u2019s temperament and social-emotional development, as well as provided meaningful information about the two variables in different contexts (Davies et al., 2021; Zhu J. et al., 2021), the effect of negative affect on children\u2019s social skills has been less explored, and the possible moderating effect of teacher\u2013child relationships remains unexplored. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to examine the associations between preschool children\u2019s negative affect and social skills, and the moderating effect of the teacher\u2013child relationship. The results showed that teacher\u2013child closeness and conflict played moderating roles in the relationship between children\u2019s negative affect and the three indices of social skills (cooperation, self-control, and assertion). The results revealed the underlying mechanisms of preschool children\u2019s negative affect on their social skills.\nThe relationships between preschool children\u2019s negative affect and social skills\nAfter controlling for T1 social skills and gender, preschoolers\u2019 negative affect significantly and negatively predicted cooperation, self-control, and assertion after 1 year, which is consistent with a previous study about infants (Jones et al., 2002). The results are also consistent with the direct linear effects model of child development (Sanson et al., 2004); that is,\nsome extreme temperaments can lead to adverse developmental outcomes in children. Children with a high level of negative affect are often characterized by irritability, poor ability to resist setbacks, easy frustration, and lack of comfort. Therefore, they also tend to show more problem behaviors than their counterparts (Taylor et al., 2014), which is not conducive to the development of positive social relationships and hinders their opportunities to learn social skills. Particularly, in preschool age, most children gradually adapt to their new social life and learn how to develop positive peer relationships. A high frequency of peer interactions provides them with more opportunities to practice social skills (Wang et al., 2020). However, a high level of negative affect hinders children\u2019s social interactions. For example, Zhu et al. (2019) found that shy infants showed more negative emotions such as anxiety and depression, and these children generally had lower levels of social skills than did their counterparts. A study of preschool children with social avoidance also found that children who frequently avoided social interaction also showed poor social adaptation (Zhu J. et al., 2021).\nHigh negative affect among children may also influence the parent\u2013child relationship and lead to negative parenting behaviors (Stone et al., 2016), which further aggravates children\u2019s lack of social skills. For example, studies have shown that infants with high negative emotions and low effort control will lead mothers to experience high parenting pressure in parent\u2013child interactions, perhaps even making it dysfunctional, which will affect the development of children\u2019s social skills (Mash and Johnston, 1990; McBride et al., 2002).\nFinally, high negative affect influences not only children\u2019s social relationships but also their cognition of the social environment, thus resulting in the avoidance of social interactions. For example, children with a high level of fear usually attribute their emotions to unpredictable factors beyond their control (Lerner and Keltner, 2001). Therefore, when they face unfamiliar environments, they are often less adaptable. They also shy away from social interactions owing to their fear of peer rejection. However, negative emotions such as depression and irritability affect their cognition with respect to social relationships. They believe that their parents do not love them and restrict their actions, and they tend to form avoidant attachment relationships, thus limiting the development of social skills."

Preschool teachers are a key part of kindergarteners\u2019 lives, and a positive teacher\u2013child relationship provides a secure base for children with a high level of negative affect to freely explore their surroundings and interact with others, which is crucial for the development of their social skills (Wu et al., 2018; Baardstu et al., 2022). However, the goodness-of-fit theory emphasizes that only the best match\nbetween the external environment and children\u2019s temperament can promote improved development (Thomas and Chess, 1977). Similarly, a good match between temperament and teacher\u2013 child relationship is crucial to promoting the development of children\u2019s social skills. Therefore, a close teacher\u2013child relationship could effectively compensate for a high level of negative affect.

            "text": "Several limitations exist in this study. First, the data were all self-reported by mothers and teachers, and there was a lack of data from children. In the future, researchers should also collect preschool children\u2019s opinions of teacher\u2013 child relationships and social skills through interviews with the children. Second, according to the theoretical framework, family environmental factors may also have an interaction effect on children\u2019s temperament, while our study only paid attention to the teacher\u2013child relationships. Future studies should include family environment factors to examine the interaction between children\u2019s temperament and those factors on their social and emotional competence. Third, the data were collected in Shanghai, the largest city in China; thus, the generalizability of the findings is limited.\nDespite these limitations, the findings have important theoretical and practical implications. First, the results elucidate the links between negative affect and social skills and the role of the teacher\u2013child relationship. The results demonstrated and expanded relevant theory models, such as the attachment theory, the developmental systems theory, and the differential susceptibility model, which help clarify the interaction effect of temperament and external environment on children\u2019s social and emotional development. Second, depending on the context, teacher\u2013child relationships had a protective or an aggravating\neffect on the development of social skills among children with a high level of negative affect. Therefore, a harmonious and close teacher\u2013child relationship can help children to learn more social skills through positive teacher\u2013child interactions. Teachers should pay more attention to children with a high level of negative affect and improve the quality of their interactions with these children. In addition, schools can implement intervention programs aimed at improving the quality of teacher\u2013child relationships, to help preschool teachers better interact with children and form positive teacher\u2013child relationships. For example, Driscoll and Pianta (2010) developed an intervention program named \u201cBanking Time,\u201d which aimed to change the teacher\u2013child interaction model (e.g., observe children\u2019s behaviors, recognize children\u2019s emotions, and describe children\u2019s behaviors and emotions). This could improve teacher\u2013child relationship quality, foster children\u2019s social skills, and reduce problem behaviors in the classroom (Driscoll and Pianta, 2010; LoCasale-Crouch et al., 2018)."

            "text": "This study revealed an association between preschool children\u2019s negative affect and social skills (cooperation, selfcontrol, and assertion). A higher level of negative affect may lead to a lower level of social skills. The teacher\u2013 child relationship moderated the association between negative affect and children\u2019s social skills, with closeness buffering the prediction of negative affect on children\u2019s social skills, while conflict intensifying the prediction of negative affect on children\u2019s social skills.\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org"
