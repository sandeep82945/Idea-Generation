    "abstractText": "We propose a method to engineer repulsive long-range interactions between ultracold ground-state molecules using optical fields, thus preventing short-range collisional losses. It maps the microwave coupling recently used for collisional shielding onto a two-photon transition and takes advantage of optical control techniques. In contrast to one-photon optical shielding [Xie et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 153202 (2020)], this scheme avoids heating of the molecular gas due to photon scattering. The proposed protocol, exemplified for Na K, should be applicable to a large class of polar diatomic molecules.",

In contrast to one-photon optical shielding [Xie et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 153202 (2020)], this scheme avoids heating of the molecular gas due to photon scattering.

INTRODUCTION\nThe full understanding and modeling of few-body systems remains a long-standing challenge in several areas of science, like, for instance, in quantum physics. The possibility to create and manipulate dilute gases at ultracold temperatures, composed of particles with kinetic energies E = kBT 1 mK, opened novel opportunities in this respect. The growing availability of quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules (i.e., possessing a permanent electric dipole moment in their own frame) in several labs revealed a very peculiar situation in the context of few-body physics: At ultracold energies, two such molecules in their absolute ground level (i.e., in the lowest rovibrational and hyperfine level of their electronic ground state) collide with a universal collisional rate, even if they have no inelastic or reactive energetically allowed channels, so they leave the molecular trap with a short characteristic time. Such a four-body system, which may look rather simple at first glance, is not yet fully characterized. It is currently interpreted as a \u201csticky\u201d four-body complex [1,2], with a huge density of states, for which various statistical models have been developed [3\u20135]. However, the experimental observations reported up to now regarding the molecular loss rates [6\u20139] cannot yet be consistently reproduced by these models [10\u201313].\nInstead of attempting to fully describe this four-body system, with the aim of identifying the exact cause of the universal loss rate, one can design protocols where molecules\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nwould simply not reach short distances in the course of their collision. Several options have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated, based on the modification of the long-range interaction (LRI) between molecules using static electric fields [14\u201318] or microwave (mw) fields [19\u201323] to shield their collisions. In a previous paper [24], we proposed an alternative way to engineer LRIs using a laser with a frequency blue-detuned from the one of a suitable molecular rovibronic transition. Such a one-photon optical shielding (1-OS), inspired from previous works on cold atoms [25,26], results in the laser-induced coupling of the attractive collisional entrance channel to a repulsive one, thus preventing the molecules from reaching short distances and from creating a sticky complex. One limitation of the 1-OS could be the heating of the molecular quantum gas due to the continuous scattering of off-resonant photons of the 1-OS laser.\nIn this paper, we propose a two-photon optical shielding (2-OS) scheme, aiming at overcoming the above limitation, while mapping the case of the mw shielding (Fig. 1). As described below, such a scheme combines the best features of the 1-OS (no restriction for the field polarization, convenient laser power, tunability, geometrical versatility, broad compatibility) and mw shielding (no spontaneous emission or photon scattering). The scheme relies on coupling three molecular states |g1\u3009, |q\u3009, and |g2\u3009 of the collisional complex, with R-dependent energies [i.e., the longrange potential energy curves (PECs) of Fig. 1(a)] via a two-photon transition from |g1\u3009 to |g2\u3009 occurring preferentially at the intermolecular distance R = RC [Fig. 1(b)]. In the dressed state picture [Fig. 2(a)], this maps the mw shielding scheme [20,21] onto an effective optical coupling of the states |g\u03031\u3009 and |g\u03032\u3009 (i.e., the dressed states).\n2643-1564/2023/5(3)/033074(9) 033074-1 Published by the American Physical Society"

By convention, we define red detuning as (R), \u03b4(R) > 0. The R dependence of the detunings originates from the R-dependent dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) between the molecules, determining their long-range PECs. Additionally, as R varies, the state composition also varies as shown later in Appendix 3, which results in an R dependency of the Rabi frequency. In the following, we thus define 1= 1(R \u2192 \u221e), 2= 2(R \u2192 \u221e), = (R \u2192 \u221e) and \u03b4=\u03b4(R \u2192 \u221e)."

(7)\nThis scheme is equivalent to the mw shielding (Fig. 2), with an important difference: The initial and final states have the same total parity, so the channels relevant for 2-OS will be different from those of the mw shielding. Nonetheless, the same requirement still holds: Identifying a channel with a repulsive PEC which could be coupled to the entrance channel via a two-photon transition. Moreover, it is worth noting that there is no intrinsic limitation on the magnitude of eff , which could be taken arbitrarily large, as long as it does not reach another energy level.\nIf we now set \u03b4(R) = 0 at a given distance, the Raman resonance is achieved so one of the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian in Eq.

Two options can be considered:\n(i) \u03b4 = 0 for R \u2192 \u221e: The individual molecules are then protected against photon scattering, so the ultracold molecular\nsample in the trap will not be heated while applying the 2-OS scheme [Fig. 2(a)].\n(ii) \u03b4(RC ) = 0: The molecular pair is less protected against photon scattering while the 2-OS is indeed active at the crossing point between the PECs of the two dressed channels.\nAt ultracold temperatures, the molecules spend most of their time at very large distances. As argued in Ref. [24], the shielding dynamics proceeds with a characteristic time shorter than the radiative lifetime of a suitable |q\u3009 state. Therefore, option (i) is preferable in most experimental realizations. We thus assume \u03b4 = 0, while the variation of the detunings (R), \u03b4(R), and eff (R) for the realistic case described below are detailed in Appendix 2. To ensure a crossing between |g\u03031\u3009 and |g\u03032\u3009 and that the population distribution of the dark state at R \u2192 \u221e is predominantly in |g1\u3009, which is the case for 2 > 1, we chose > 0 and eff < 0."

In general, the experiments are performed in the presence of an external magnetic field imposed by the location of a Feshbach resonance used to create the groundstate molecules. According to the Supplemental Material of Ref. [20], the magnetic field above which the hyperfine structure could be neglected is generally small enough for most alkali-metal diatomic species, opening the possibility to choose a suitable Feshbach resonance. We formulate the 2-OS by relying on the lowest excited electronic state of 23Na 39K (the b3 0 state, noted b afterward), as in Ref. [24]: The bottom of the b PEC lies below all PECs dissociating to the first excited dissociation limit Na(3s)+K(4p), so the two-photon transition could be implemented with a detuning from the lowest vibrational level vb = 0. The b state is weakly coupled to the excited A1 + state via spin-orbit interaction (referred to as the A/b system afterward), yielding a pair of electronic states with = 0+ symmetry, being the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the 23Na 39K molecular axis. The transition X \u2194 (A/b) is thus dipole-allowed through the A component of the lowest 0+ state of the A/b system, resulting in a transition electric dipole moment (TEDM) of 0.0456 a.u.

We use the same parameters as those reported in Ref.

We include in our calculations for two ground-state molecules colliding with jX and j\u2032X even partial waves up to = 8 to describe states with ji, jk = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, with total angular momentum up to J = 0, 1, 2.

We note in Fig. 4 the quasi-degeneracy of the two limits X ( jX = 1) + b ( jb = 0) and X ( jX = 0) + b ( jb = 1) resulting from the almost equal rotational constant of the vX = 0 and vb = 0 levels. This induces a strong mixing between the states correlated to these asymptotes. This pattern is actually present in all heteronuclear alkali-metal diatomic molecules [24]. Note that the lowest dissociation limit jX = 0 + jb = 0 is not appropriate for our 2-OS scheme as it possesses only a J = 0, 2 manifold of states and thus would not be coupled by light to the entrance channel."

[20,21] based on the mw transition jX = 0 \u2192 jX = 1, and observed experimentally with 23Na 40K molecules with mw = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 8 MHz and mw = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 11 MHz [19].

            "text": "The working principle of 2-OS and its mapping onto MWS is best explained by the cleanest coupling of the (weakly dipole-allowed) X -b transition: The b state is the lowest electronic state accessible via a dipole-allowed transition, leading to the most isolated, or closest to the idealized three-level scheme. Considering the weak TEDM of the quasiforbidden one-photon transition vX = 0 \u2192 vb(0+ ) = 0, the range of 1 and 2 values varying with (with \u03b4 = 0) displayed in Fig. 6 leads to quite large laser intensities. However, as the Raman condition \u03b4 = 0 is fulfilled at infinity (i.e., for\nindividual molecules), one can significantly reduce the value of without hampering the efficiency of the 2-OS scheme. Moreover, as the proposed scheme can be generalized to any intermediate state |q\u0303\u3009, excited electronic states with large TEDM can be readily used, allowing for moderate laser intensities I1 and I2. For example, coupling via the A1 + state in 23Na 39K yields the desired eff/(2\u03c0 ) \u223c 10 MHz with an estimated I2 ( I1) on the order of 104 W/cm2 for 1/ 2 \u223c 10\u22122, and a loss probability due to off-resonant scattering below 10\u22126 per collision. Note that the two-photon coupling scheme allows using a common laser source in combination with frequency modulation for driving both optical transitions. Thus, the optical phase noise is the common mode and the overall phase stability is determined by the purity of the mw modulation source. Therefore, we expect that the proposed scheme could be successfully implemented in a forthcoming experiment, helped by full dynamical calculations extending those of Ref. [24] to the 2-OS case.\nIn summary, we have proposed a scheme for shielding of inelastic and reactive short-range collisions based on twophoton transitions. It allows taking advantage of optically driven transitions including insensitivity to polarization and flexibility in the choice of electronic states, while suppressing undesired off-resonant photon scattering which was present in the previously proposed 1-OS. Our method is applicable to a broad range of bialkali molecules, with expected efficiencies comparable to the previously demonstrated mw shielding scheme. Our results may be of importance in experiments where collisional losses, in general, pose a major limitation to the achievable lifetimes and densities of ultracold molecular gases.\n033074-6"
