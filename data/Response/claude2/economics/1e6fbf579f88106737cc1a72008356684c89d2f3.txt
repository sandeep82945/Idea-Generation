 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Conduct interviews or surveys with tourism stakeholders in the EU countries studied to get their perspectives on integrating tourism into bioeconomy strategies. This could provide more in-depth qualitative data to complement the document analysis. 

2. Expand the analysis to include all EU member states to determine if the patterns hold for the entire EU. This could lead to more generalized conclusions about tourism's role in EU bioeconomy strategies.

3. Perform a similar analysis looking at bioeconomy strategies and tourism's role in countries outside the EU across different regions. This could reveal different approaches and priorities for linking tourism and bioeconomy. 

4. Develop case studies of destinations that have successfully implemented bioeconomy-based tourism to identify best practices and key success factors. This could help provide a roadmap for other locations. 

5. Research consumer demand and preferences for bioeconomy-based tourism offerings compared to conventional tourism. This could help determine market viability and guide product development.
