    "abstractText": "Bacteriophages participate in soil life by influencing bacterial community structure and function, biogeochemical cycling and horizontal gene transfer. Despite their great abundance, diversity, and importance in microbial processes, they remain little explored in environmental studies. The influence of abiotic factors on the persistence of bacteriophages is now recognized; however, it has been mainly studied under experimental conditions. This study aimed to determine whether the abiotic factors well-known to influence bacteriophage persistence also control the natural distribution of the known DNA bacteriophage populations. To this end, soil from eight study sites including forests and grasslands located in the Attert River basin (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) were sampled, covering different soil and land cover characteristics. Shotgun metagenomics, reference-based bioinformatics and statistical analyses allowed characterising the diversity of known DNA bacteriophage and bacterial communities. After combining soil properties with the identified DNA bacteriophage populations, our in-situ study highlighted the influence of pH and calcium cations on the diversity of the known fraction of the soil DNA bacteriophages. More interestingly, significant relationships were established between bacteriophage and bacterial populations. This study provides new insights into the importance of abiotic and biotic factors in the distribution of DNA bacteriophages and the natural ecology of terrestrial bacteriophages.",

            "text": "Soil is a complex compartment where biodiversity and interactions between microbes, animals and plants contribute to its life and optimal functioning. Generally, plants provide organic matter as well as nutrients to soil (e.g., nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous) and are responsible for its structure through the development of the rhizosphere [1,2]. Soil-dwelling animals help to degrade and mix organic matter throughout the soil and participate in the recycling of nutrients from dead biomass [3,4]. Microbes, including fungi, archaea and bacteria, play a key role in organic matter decomposition, element cycling and nutrient availability to plants [5\u20137]. This microbial activity, particularly due to the quantity, diversity and functional roles of prokaryotes, is considered central to soil processes [8\u201310]. Viruses are also biological entities fully part of soil biodiversity with essential but relatively unexplored functions [11]. Since the beginning of research on viral diversity in soils in the 1970s [11,12], knowledge of soil viruses has been expanded well, especially for bacteriophages (bacteriainfecting viruses), whose abundance can reach up to 1010 particles per gram of soil [13,14].\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1458. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10071458 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1458 2 of 21\nBacteriophages are ubiquitous in the environment and can be found in agricultural soils, forest soils (approximately 109 bacteriophages per gram of dry soil), wetlands, or even cold deserts (approximately 103 bacteriophages per gram of dry soil) [13]. Bacteriophages seem to be more abundant in wetlands than in forests due to high soil water content, but less abundant in agricultural soils than in forests where the soil temperature is lower [13]. In fact, many abiotic factors may be involved in the distribution, abundance and diversity of bacteriophages in soils. However, most of them have only been explored to investigate their effect on bacteriophage persistence. Temperature is recognised as an important, if not the main, factor in viral inactivation [15]. The ideal temperature range to prevent viral inactivation is considered to be 4 to 10 \u25e6C, where bacteriophages are generally stable at pH values between 5 and 9, but can be degraded under strongly alkaline (pH > 11) or acidic (pH < 2) conditions [16\u201318]. These extreme pH conditions can inactivate virus particles through the denaturation of their proteins or nucleic acids [18\u201321]. In addition, soil texture, especially clay type, alters the detection of bacteriophage as it strongly influences adsorption and retention phenomena in the soil. Indeed, clay soils present a very dense structure with a low permeability and a large specific surface area, which is auspicious for higher adsorption\u2013desorption reactions with bacteriophages [22]. In addition, due to hydrophobicity interactions and the presence of electrical charges, bacteriophages tend to adsorb more onto clay surfaces than onto sandy or silty soil particles [23]. This process also helps to protect bacteriophages from other inactivating factors [11,24]. However, knowledge of the influence of these abiotic factors on bacteriophage persistence has been mainly gained under experimental conditions using bacteriophage models (e.g., \u03a6X174, MS2), which may not be transferable when studying environmental samples [19,21,25,26]. Indeed, the natural bacteriophage diversity and the impact of such abiotic factors remain largely underexplored in terrestrial compared to aquatic environments [27\u201329]. Regarding the studies exploring the diversity of bacteriophages on in situ terrestrial ecosystems, virus-like particles (VLPs) or viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) have dominantly been studied [30\u201333]. While the former does not allow the identification of viruses, the latter is rather a proxy for viral species. Therefore, the use of metagenomics in determining the taxonomical classification of viruses and their respective diversity would not only allow completing the knowledge about the influence of abiotic factors on the bacteriophage species communities but also explore the relationship with the bacterial communities. Coevolution between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts is widely recognised, with reciprocal influences [11,34]. Bacteriophages are unable to self-replicate and therefore must infect one or more bacterial hosts to replicate and spread. As agents of bacterial mortality, bacteriophages are likely to have a significant influence on bacterial community dynamics, structure and function, as well as biogeochemical cycling, horizontal gene transfer processes and the pre-decomposition of the organic matter [35,36]. However, viral-mediated mortality induces interest at the expense of understanding the influence of bacteria on bacteriophage occurrence in soils [37\u201339]. With the advent of viral metagenomics, databases increasingly include new viral sequences, which participate in the rapid expansion of our understanding of the virosphere. Based on the viruses already identified, the influence of selected abiotic factors (i.e., soil properties, vegetation and land use) on the distribution of the known DNA bacteriophages can be assessed in different types of soil. Therefore, in this study, we used a combination of approaches and methods (i.e., physicochemical analysis, metagenomics, reference-based bioinformatics, direct counting and statistics) to obtain an original picture of the natural viral and bacterial diversities and their ecological interactions with soil properties in terrestrial environments of Luxembourg. The aim of the study was to determine whether the abiotic factors well known to influence bacteriophage persistence also control the natural distribution of the known DNA bacteriophage populations in the studied soil samples, and to analyse the role of bacterial populations in this phenomenon. Two main hypotheses were tested: (i) abiotic factors (i.e., pH, cations) well known to affect bacteriophage survival also\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1458 3 of 21\nhave an impact on their diversity and distribution in terrestrial environments, and (ii) the bacterial community present in the soil influences the relationship between bacteriophages and soil properties."

Regarding the ecological diversity, both \u03b1 and \u03b2-diversities of bacteria and DNA bacteriophages were studied. The \u03b1-diversity is the average number of distinct species groups at a local scale, considering the richness of a population [62]. As popular \u03b1-diversity indexes, the Shannon index (H) and the species richness (S) were calculated for each site, using the R package \u2018vegan\u2019 [63]. Then, the evenness (E), which defines the distribution of the abundance of the species in a community, was calculated as follows [64,65]:\nE = H\nlog(S)\nThe \u03b2-diversity is all changes in the species composition of a population between several habitats in a region. This diversity considers both the richness and evenness of populations [66]. Using Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarities, a multivariate method, the RDA (redundancy analysis), was performed to compare the different sites as a function of the bacteriophage populations at the genus level, through the analysis of their variation from one another. To build the RDA, a selection of the 10 most abundant genera was first performed, as rare genera might generate noise in the analysis). Then, abiotic factors (i.e., sand, clay, silt content, soil pH, magnesium concentration, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and Ca2+ concentration) were selected by removing the variables for which strong correlations (>r = 0.80) were found to avoid co-variations, using the function \u2018pairs\u2019.

Indeed, Regtenbusch and Weierbach showed higher abundance for the genera Trebonia, Edaphobacter and Mycobacterium, for which the relative abundances were lower in the other soils. Regarding the other genera, with the exception of Streptomyces and Bradyrhizobium, all of them showed high abundance for all sites except for Regtenbusch and Weierbach. Finally, Streptomyces and Bradyrhizobium, were detected in every soil with the highest abundance reported for the latter. The differences in bacterial community composition between the sites were studied through a PERMANOVA test, performed on the bacteria genera abundance. As noticed for the DNA bacteriophages, the vegetation (i.e., forest and grasslands) did not significantly impact the bacteria distribution (p-value = 0.121, \u03b1 = 0.05). In addition, soil pH and calcium concentration also displayed significant effect on the bacterial compositions between the sites (p-value = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively, \u03b1 = 0.05). Contrary to the observations on the DNA bacteriophages, magnesium concentration played a significant role on the bacterial composition (p-value = 0.027, \u03b1 = 0.05). As for the DNA bacteriophage investigation, RDA was carried out to analyse the variations of bacterial genera depending on the same selected soil properties of the sites (Figure 6). The RDA was built over the two first dimensions, covering together 93.77% of the fitted variation. Among all the abiotic factors, soil pH was the sole explanatory variable that had a significant weight on the construction of the RDA (p-value = 0.01, \u03b1 = 0.05). On one hand, the axis RDA1 was significantly correlated at 92.16% with soil pH (p-value < 0.01, \u03b1 = 0.05) and at 79.21% with calcium (p-value < 0.01, \u03b1 = 0.05). On the other hand, the RDA2 was not significantly correlated with any of the tested soil properties. Weierbach and Retgenbusch were found apart from all the other sites, and both related to only Edaphobacter and Mycobacterium. As DNA bacteriophages and bacteria are known for being exclusively linked to one another, the covariation of these two communities was analysed using a symmetric CoCA. This ordination method was built over the two first dimensions that covered 67.4% of the total covariation (Figure 7).

Discussion In our study, a viral concentration of approximately 109 to 1010 VLPs per gram of dry soil was found, which is consistent with previous works [14,68,69]. Although VLP counts are not always considered to be a good representative of virus concentrations, the counts performed here were carried out in the same manner as previously on freshwater sediments using the FACSCalibur FCM table. This method was previously validated and provided similar VLP counts to those obtained by EFM [70]. A good correlation was found, highlighting the high sensitivity of the device and thus, allowing obtaining unambiguous signatures for VLPs by discriminating noise from VLPs (virus-like particles) to PLPs (prokaryote-like particles). It is noteworthy, however, that flow cytometry analysis does not allow identifying viruses or discriminating bacteriophages from the rest of the VLPS [71]. To draw a complete picture of the viral community, a taxonomic identification of the known DNA bacteriophage populations was complementarily performed through shotgun metagenomics and reference-based bioinformatics. The taxonomy was assigned using the nr database released in April 2022; however, it is noteworthy that the viral taxonomy built by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is nowadays updated according to the genetic similarities between bacteriophages, including reclassification of the families observed in the current study, such as Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae. Our study showed Caudovirales as the most frequently identified order in all sites, while Siphoviridae, Podoviridae and Myoviridae were found as the most abundant families observed within the identified DNA bacteriophages, which is consistent with most of the literature that studied viral soil diversity [13,26,29]. However, the high proportion of these three families is rather the reflection of the taxonomy made available on the databases up to now, where most of the bacteriophage species are classified into these families [72]. For this reason, it is important to consider low taxonomic levels in diversity studies. In the current study, the viral genera obtained from the libraries did not display specific patterns\nFigure 7.

However, the high proportion of these three families is rather the reflection of the taxonomy made available on the databases up to now, where most of the bacteriophage species are classified into these families [72]. For this reason, it is important to consider low taxonomic levels in diversity studies. In the current study, the viral genera obtained from the libraries did not display specific patterns related to the ecosystems (i.e., forests vs. grasslands). The three selected forest sites presented different vegetal covers (i.e., beech, spruce and oak) with diverse types of soil textures. The forest sites might not be sufficiently similar to constitute a common pattern in DNA bacteriophage diversity. However, several patterns in the known DNA bacteriophage distribution are distinguishable by considering the specific soil parameters. The soil pH as well as the calcium concentration significantly drove the ecological distribution of the known DNA bacteriophage communities among the different studied soils. More interestingly, the distribution of both DNA bacteriophage and bacterial communities in diverse types of soil were found to be strongly linked to one another and their distributions were explained by the same abiotic factors, i.e., soil pH and calcium concentration. Additionally, a complementary effect of magnesium concentration solely on the bacterial distribution was detected. The differences in microbial diversity were highlighted especially for the soils of Weierbach and Retgenbusch. Indeed, these two sites did not only display an acidic pH (around 4) with low calcium availability (<5 meq per 100 g of soil), but also low abundance and diversity of the known microbial populations at the genus level. While studying the known DNA bacteriophage populations, these same three soils were represented by the significant presence of one specific DNA bacteriophage genus. Indeed, Saphexavirus, Borockvirus and Lessievirus were highly abundant in the soil of Mollbach, Retgenbusch and Weierbach, respectively, compared to the other studied soils. Some studies reported a dominance of small ssDNA viruses rather than dsDNA-tailed bacteriophages in the soils [73\u201375]. In the present study, ssDNA bacteriophages (Microviridae and Inoviridae) were also detected, but in low frequency in comparison to dsDNA bacteriophages. Most ssDNA bacteriophages detected from environmental metagenomes belonged to the Microviridae family, for which all members infect a narrow range of hosts [76]. However, most ssDNA bacteriophages remain scarcely characterised within the taxonomy as Inoviridae represents 11% and Microviridae 2% of the ICTV database [77], reflecting a potential bias in the determination of their abundance in the soil samples. Calcium is an important component participating in soil life. It plays a role in the soil structure, firstly as a binding agent in the aggregation of soil particles, secondly as a macronutrient in plant nutrition and thirdly as a factor facilitating soil permeability [78]. Then, calcium has a biological role in promoting an optimal environment to enhance soil microorganism activities [79]. Finally, calcium is highly related to soil pH. Indeed, soils with low pH generally display low calcium availability. As high concentrations of hydrogen ions\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1458 16 of 21\ndisplace calcium concentration from binding sites, it results in the leaching of \u201cfree\u201d calcium, particularly in the more porous soils [80,81]. Such soils, such as the ones of Weierbach and Retgenbusch, i.e., low pH and calcium concentration, did display a low microbial diversity among the bacterial and DNA bacteriophage populations characterised in this study. On the contrary, Pall 1, Pall 2 and Daerent with much higher calcium concentrations (between 10 and 20 meq per 100 g of soil) and an ideal range of soil pH (between 6 and 7) showed higher microbial diversity. In laboratory experiments, divalent cations (such as calcium and magnesium) were found to interact with bacteriophage MS2 by increasing its attachment to the surface of river natural organic matter [82]. In soil, adsorption onto surface particles is the most important process implied in the bacteriophages-soil interactions [11]. This interaction is highly dependent upon the type of cations found in the environment. Calcium cation (positively charged) is highly involved in the adsorption of clay\u2013humus complex (CHC), negatively charged on its surface, through electrostatic forces [83,84]. Bacteriophages can then adsorb onto the CHC by the presence of the cations on the surface. Indeed, bacteriophages are charged on their surface; however, this charge is highly dependent on pH. At neutral pH (7), most bacteriophages are negatively charged and can interact with the available cations [85]. Reducing the pH will induce some bacteriophage surfaces to turn into positive charges, according to their isoelectric point (pI). Once positive, bacteriophages can compete with cations to bind with the clay charges of the CHC. Indeed, bacteriophages tend to be more retained in soils rich in clay. The latter has a lower specific surface, due to large particles and a greater ion-exchange capacity, which highly adsorb bacteriophages [86]. Therefore, the combination between calcium cation and pH can play a role in the bacteriophage dynamic in soils. However, not only did these factors show a significant effect on the DNA bacteriophage distribution, but they also did on the bacterial distribution. Additionally, our results showed a strong positive correlation between both bacterial and DNA bacteriophages distribution among the sites, suggesting a strong interaction. Therefore, soil pH seems like the most significant factor in leading the known DNA bacteriophage distributions, directly or/and indirectly through the shaping of bacterial communities. Calcium cation availability might rather play a role in the dynamic of DNA bacteriophages, through their adsorption with the soil particles. The advances in metagenomics and bioinformatics have enabled deeper investigations for the identification of viruses [87,88]; however, some technical issues remain in the analysis of soil viruses [89]. As viruses tend to adsorb on soil particles, virus elution and concentration steps are often required before performing metagenomics. Nevertheless, this step generally ends in low recovery efficiencies [90,91], as noticed in our results during the optimisation of the elution and concentration protocol. Indeed, even though the viral recovery was satisfactory to conduct a viral quantification using flow cytometry, it resulted in low DNA yield after nucleic acid extraction. Therefore, it affected the good quality of viral sequences obtained after conducting the shotgun metagenomics, leading us to carry out the DNA extraction directly from the soil samples. As the analysis is solely relying on virus-affiliated reads that can be obtained from total DNA metagenomes, few viral contigs were obtained with N50 comprising between 200 and 300 per library. This can limit the interpretation of relationships between viruses and other microbes within the same samples. Much remains to be understood about the diversity, dynamics and roles of bacteriophages in soils and metagenomics approaches have only recently enabled increasing our knowledge, particularly under in situ conditions. In laboratory experiments, some physicochemical properties, especially pH and ion strength, influenced bacteriophage inactivation [92,93]. Our results seemed to show the effect of these similar factors on bacteriophage diversity in soils; however, it is noteworthy that the study was focused on the known fraction of the microbial populations in the diverse selected soils. The OTU-based approach is less dependent on reference databases but works by clustering sequences according to similarity thresholds (often set at a sequence similarity level above 97%) [94\u201396]. This approach does not identify the taxonomic species but is rather a proxy for them and\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 1458 17 of 21\nhas shown to be phylogenetically incoherent [94\u201396]. Therefore, further analyses using complementary molecular and bioinformatics methods, including untargeted approaches, could be applied to obtain a more complete picture of bacteriophage dynamics. Additionally, the investigation of the influence of certain abiotic factors on bacteriophage diversity based on what has already been characterised could open perspectives for the use of these species as, for instance, biotechnologies or in the development of new culture models for laboratory experiments."

            "text": "In this study, the natural diversity and distribution of DNA bacteriophage populations in soils were explored as well as their relationship with the soil-dwelling bacterial populations. Through the complementary use of metagenomics, reference-based bioinformatics and multidimensional analyses, we identified the known fraction of DNA bacteriophage communities in forest and grassland soils and deciphered the influence of some soil properties and microbial communities on the DNA bacteriophage occurrence. Both soil pH and calcium content were observed to influence the distribution of DNA bacteriophage and bacterial populations. A strong positive correlation between DNA bacteriophage and bacterial communities was confirmed, suggesting in addition to soil pH and calcium content, bacteria are also involved. Therefore, our results add to the growing body of evidence that bacteriophages are likely to play key roles in soil ecology.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms10071458/s1, Figure S1: Bar charts of the relative abundance (in %) of bacterial phylum (selected genera with an abundance above 100 occurrences) from the known fraction of all studied sites; Figure S2: Per base sequence quality from FastQC for read forward 1 (A) and read reverse 2 (B) of the sequencing ot the Weierbach soil; Table S1: Percentages of relative abundances identified for each taxonomic domain; Table S2: Shannon diversity index (H), evenness (E) and species richness (S) of bacteria populations in the soil of the studied sites; Table S3: Recovery of bacteriophage \u03a6X174 comparing three methods for mechanical viral detachment from the Weierbach soil; Table S4: Recovery of bacteriophage \u03a6X174 from the Weierbach soil comparing six different eluent solutions; Table S5: Recovery of bacteriophage \u03a6X174 from the Weierbach soil after concentration step, comparing Amicon with two different cut-off points (i.e., 30 kDa and 50 kDa); Table S6: Recovery of bacteriophage \u03a6X174 at each step of the elution and concentration protocol for each study site; Table S7: Summary of each step from the DNase treatment to the library preparation from viral concentrates and soil sample of the Weierbach site.
