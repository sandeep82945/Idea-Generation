 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the administrator's welfare maximization problem. The paper shows the problem is NP-hard, but leaves open whether a PTAS exists. Designing a PTAS using techniques like dynamic programming could be an interesting direction. 

2. Extend the model to consider heterogeneous fines or penalties for different locations/users. The current model has a uniform fine k, but allowing for location-specific fines could lead to new algorithm design and analysis challenges.

3. Incorporate budget constraints for the administrator and study the impact on optimal resource allocation strategies. The administrator may have a limited budget to recruit security resources or impose fines. Adding budget constraints could reveal new tradeoffs.

4. Consider online or robust versions of the problems where location types are revealed sequentially over time. This could model changing fraud patterns and require new online algorithms for resource allocation.

5. Empirically validate the model and algorithms on real-world data sets. The numerical experiments provide interesting insights, but validating the techniques on real data about locations, fraud levels, etc. could be an impactful direction.
