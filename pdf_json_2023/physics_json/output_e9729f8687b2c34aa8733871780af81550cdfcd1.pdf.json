    "abstractText": "One major problem with the overuse of antibiotics is that the microorganisms acquire resistance; thus the dose must be increased unsustainably. To overcome this problem, researchers from around the world are actively investigating new types of antimicrobials. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects; moreover, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) considers ZnO as GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Many essential oils have antimicrobial activity and their components do not generate resistance over time. One of the drawbacks is the high volatility of some components, which diminishes the antimicrobial action as they are eliminated. The combination of ZnO NPs and essential oils can synergistically produce a stronger antimicrobial effect, and some of the volatile compounds can be retained on the nanoparticles\u2019 surface, ensuring a better-lasting antimicrobial effect. The samples were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and thermal analysis (TG-DSC) coupled with analysis of evolved gases using FTIR. The ZnO NPs, with a size of ~35 nm, exhibited a loading between 1.44% and 15.62%\u2014the lower values were specific for limonene-containing oils (e.g., orange, grapefruit, bergamot, or limette), while high values were obtained from cinnamon, minzol, thyme, citronella, and lavender oils\u2014highlighting differences among non-polar terpenes and alcohol or aldehyde derivatives. The antibacterial assay indicated the existence of a synergic action among components and a high dependency on the percentage of loaded oil. Loaded nanoparticles offer immense potential for the development of materials with specific applications, such as wound dressings or food packaging. These nanoparticles can be utilized in scenarios where burst delivery is desired or when prolonged antibacterial activity is sought.",

To overcome this problem, new types of antimicrobials are being researched worldwide, from innovative synthetic organic compounds [2] to metallic and oxide nanoparticles [3], natural antimicrobials like plant extracts or essential oils [4], and synthetic peptides that can be designed to have antibacterial properties similar to antibiotics [5].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15102470 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 2 of 25\nZinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects, but at the same time U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) considers ZnO as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) [6]. The scientific literature is rich with numerous reports highlighting the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles against model pathogens, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains. These nanoparticles have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable ability to inhibit the growth and proliferation of bacteria [7\u20139]. The antifungal activity is researched and reported much less, and usually in food-related applications. At the same time, the debate about the exact mechanism involved in the antimicrobial activity is still ongoing. The ZnO with its strong photocatalytic activity is expected to generate considerable levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light irradiation [10], which are the main toxic species for microorganisms. However, ZnO NPs also exhibit antimicrobial activity under dark conditions, which supports alternative killing pathways. The most-often-mentioned ones are the mechanical damage to the cellular membrane and the internalization of NPs followed by the release of Zn2+ ions. All these factors promote ZnO NPs as an alternative microbicide agent in various domains, like food packaging, topical ointments, water treatment, and others [11\u201313]. Natural plant extracts and essential oils are also a major research topic, due to their multiple health benefits, which include antioxidant, antimutagenic, antiproliferative, or antimicrobial activities [14,15]; some of them\u2014like citronella (lemongrass) essential oil\u2014are classified as non-toxic biopesticides in the USA [16] while having a strong antifungal activity [17]. The antimicrobial activity of each essential oil derives from one or two main components. Additionally, minor components can also exhibit useful activities, and by synergism, the essential oil is usually more potent than the main components. The orange essential oil is composed mainly of D-limonene which is listed as GRAS by the FDA, but it is also considered a biopesticide and bug-repellant [18,19]. The antiseptic properties of thyme essential oil are generated by the main component, thymol [20]. The thyme essential oil was used as an antiparasitic or to treat minor wounds from ancient times due to its strong antimicrobial properties [21,22]. Lavender [23,24], grapefruit [25,26], bergamot [27,28], cinnamon [29,30], and rosemary [31,32] essential oils have strong antimicrobial activity and therefore are good candidates for innovative antibacterial and antifungal therapies and materials. Nevertheless, the essential oils must be loaded or encapsulated in a matrix, be it organic or inorganic, to ensure a longer release profile, and a sustained antimicrobial activity [33,34]. The nanoparticles can be loaded with various antimicrobials by multiple techniques\u2014 some being solvent-free and others involving a solvent. The solvent-free methods can be physical mixing, co-milling, melt method, or microwave irradiation. Moreover, solventmediated loading can be carried out using adsorption, incipient wetness impregnation, solvent evaporation, supercritical and liquid CO2 technology, one-pot drug loading and synthesis, chaperone assistance, etc. [35\u201340]. By combining the ZnO NPs with essential oils, the synergic activities result in either a stronger antimicrobial or a decrease in the amounts needed to combat microorganisms. Such loaded nanoparticles can be further used in topical ointments or other antimicrobial applications like food packaging [9]. By using essential oils loaded on ZnO NPs, some physical characteristics can also be improved, including retaining the volatile components into the mixture for a longer time, and slow release of compounds (due to interactions with nanoparticles surface) that can improve the availability of the essential oil components over time, providing a long-lasting antimicrobial activity. In this study, we obtained polyhedral shape ZnO NPs with a diameter of ~35 nm, which were loaded with a series of the following essential oils: citronella, orange, thyme, lavender, grapefruit, bergamot, cinnamon, rosemary, minzol, and limette. Since these essential oils are provided as liquids, we chose a solvent-mediated loading mixed procedure, namely impregnation, followed by excess solvent evaporation. The ZnO NPs loaded with essential oils were characterized with thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission elec-\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 3 of 25\ntron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and fluorescence spectroscopy (PL). The essential oil-loaded ZnO NPs were tested against a series of model pathogen bacterial strains\u2014Gram-negative Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19114)\u2014which are one of the common causes of food poisoning [41\u201345]. The presence of both ZnO NPs and essential oils leads to an increase in antibacterial activity, indicating a synergic action."

The 1-butanol was obtained from Sigma (Redox Lab Supplies Com SRL, Bucharest, Romania). The nutrient growth medium used was TSA (Tryptone Soya Agar) type, produced by Oxoid Ltd. (Cheshire, UK). Essential oils of citronella, orange, thyme, lavender, grapefruit, bergamot, cinnamon, rosemary, minzol, and limette were obtained from Carl-Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), with major components being listed in Section 3.3.2.\nAll substances were used without further purification. ZnO synthesis was performed as presented in [10]. Briefly, 5 g of zinc acetate dihydrate\nwas poured in 50 mL of 1-butanol. The solution was refluxed for 24 h under continuous stirring. The flask was allowed to rest for 24 h at 25 \u25e6C. The precipitate was separated by decantation and subjected to repeated centrifugation. Between centrifugation, the powder was washed with absolute ethanol\u2014the process being repeated thrice. Finally, the obtained white powder was dried in an electrical oven at 80 \u25e6C. An amount of 0.1 g of the obtained ZnO nanopowder was loaded with each essential oil (30 \u00b5L essential oil mixed with 100 \u00b5L ethanol). The mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min and then evaporated at 40 \u25e6C in an electrical oven. The ZnO NPs loaded with essential oils were further used for microbiological assay. The sample labels are presented in Table 1.\nInformation about the crystallinity of the obtained ZnO nanopowder was obtained with a PANalytical Empyrean equipment (from Malvern PANalytical, Bruno, The Netherlands) using the equation \u03bbCuK\u03b1 = 1.54184 \u00c5. The X-ray diffractograms (XRDs) were recorded in the 2\u03b8 range 10\u201370\u25e6, with a step of 0.02\u25e6 and a time per step of 0.1 s. A Tecnai G2F30 S-TWIN high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) from FEI (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was used to record the micrographs of the ZnO NPs. The surface morphology and microstructure of ZnO nanopowder were investigated with a scanning electron microscope, QUANTA INSPECT F50 (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 4 of 25\nUltraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) reflectance spectrum was recorded with a V560 spectrophotometer from JASCO (Easton, PA, USA), using a 60 mm integrating sphere (ISV-469), between 200 and 900 nm. An LS55 fluorimeter from Perkin Elmer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), was used to record the fluorescence spectrum. The 320 nm radiation from the Xe lamp was used as an excitation wavelength. The emission spectrum was recorded between 350 and 700 nm, employing a 350 nm cut-off filter, with a scan speed of 200 nm min\u22121. Thermogravimetry\u2013differential scanning calorimetry was performed with a STA 449C F3 equipment, from Netzsch (Selb, Germany) coupled with a Tensor 27 FTIR from Bruker (Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with an internal thermostatic gas cell. A typical sample, weighing ~10 mg, was placed in an alumina crucible and was heated up at a rate of 10 \u25e6C\u00b7min\u22121, up to 900 \u25e6C, in air. A Nicolet iS50R spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) device was used to record the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, in attenuated total reflection (ATR). For every spectrum, an average of 32 scans was performed, from 400 to 4000 cm\u22121, with a resolution of 4 cm\u22121. To study in-vitro antibacterial activity, pure cultures of four reference bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were used. These pathogenic bacteria (Table 2) naturally contaminate food products obtained under improper manufacturing conditions, producing food poisoning and infections. The nutrient growth medium used was TSA (Tripton Soy Agar), produced by Oxoid (Cheshire, UK).\nQuantification of the working inoculum was carried out using the Plate Count technique, which involved the enumeration of the cells that determine the formation of colonies by cultivation on the nutrient culture medium. The qualitative screening of the sensitivity of different pathogenic bacteria to the samples of interest was performed with disk diffusion techniques on agar, adapted according to the standard issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Wayne, PA, USA). In order to determine the antimicrobial activity of ZnO NPs, an adapted diffusion assay that follows the CLSI 2020 guidelines was employed. All antimicrobial experiments were performed in triplicates."

Protected textiles or sunscreen cosmetics contain ZnO due to this strong absorption band in the UV domain [11].\nZnO is a direct band-gap semiconductor, with a wide band-gap of ~3.37 eV between the conduction and the valence bands. Therefore, a relatively large absorption band located in the ultraviolet domain is typical for the UV-Vis spectrum. The electron jump from the valence band to the conduction band generates this absorption peak, and its numerical value can be used to calculate the band-gap value of ZnO [50]. Some literature reports wrongly assign this band to a surface plasmon resonance, which does not exist in semiconductors like ZnO [51]. The band-gap value was determined using a Tauc plot (inset of Figure 4a) by applying the Kubelka\u2013Munk function F(R) = (1 \u2212 R)2/2R\u2014where R is the sample diffuse reflectance\u2014and graphical extrapolation to [F(R)\u00b7h\u03bd]2 = 0 [52]. The obtained value, 3.246 eV, was smaller than the theoretical value, indicating that the presence of additional electronic levels inside the band gap was most probably induced by the existence of various crystal defects [53].

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy\nThe FTIR spectrum displayed two characteristic zones for the ZnO NPs. The very strong absorption band around ~420\u2013450 cm\u22121 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of the Zn\u2013O bond [8,58], while the weak peaks from ~610/680 cm\u22121 were assigned to Zn\u2013OH bending vibrations [58,59] (Figure S1a). As previously reported in the literature, the band in the domain 400\u2013500 cm\u22121 becomes very strong for the single phases of wurtzite, surpassing all other vibrations. Furthermore, the peaks corresponding to the bending of Zn\u2013OH bonds remain at low intensity in the interval of 600\u2013700 cm\u22121 [58]. Additionally, the peaks between 800 and 1100 cm\u22121 could be assigned to the \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 stretches of carbonate [60], indicating the existence of minute impurities on the surface of nanoparticles generated by the acetate precursor [55]. Finally, the peak at 873 cm\u22121 could also be assigned to the Zn2+ presence in tetrahedral coordination [61,62]. The loading process of ZnO NPs with essential oils was monitored with the help of FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S1b). Specific peaks for the essential oils components were identified in Table 3. Citronellal (32.2%), geraniol (19.6%), geranylacetate (15.1%), citronellol (6.4%), and citronellylacetate (5.5%) were predominant in citronella essential oil, while the main ingredients of thyme essential oil were thymol (47.9%), \u03b3-terpinene (31.3%) and p-cymene (8.5%). D-limonene was dominant in orange (94.9%), grapefruit (93.2%), and limette (42.5%) essential oils, with linalool (3%), \u03b2-myrcene (2.5%), or \u03b3-terpinene (15.4%) and \u03b1/\u03b2-pinene (15.7%) as minor components in these oils. Limonene (59%) was also the major component of bergamot essential oil, along linalyl acetate (17.1%), linalool (9.5%), and \u03b2-pinene (5%). Lavender essential oil contained an important amount of linalool (44.2%), linalyl acetate (30%), and terpinen-4-ol (11%). Whilst, the main component of cinnamon essential oil was (E)-cinnamaldehyde (72%) mixed with smaller quantities of linalool (7%), \u03b2-caryophyllene (6.5%), eucalyptol (5.5%), and eugenol (4.5%). A more equilibrated composition was found in rosemary essential oil\u2014containing borneol (23.7%), \u03b1-pinene (9.9%), \u03b1-caryophyllene (8.1%), ledol (6.5%), eucalyptol (4.9%), camphor (4.9%), and \u03b3-terpinene (4.5%)\u2014and minzol essential oil that comprised menthol (45.4%), menthone (16.1%), menthofuran (8.9%), cis-carane (8.7%), 1,8-cineole (4.5%), and neo-menthol (4.2%). The FTIR spectra showed mostly the typical signals of the terpene and associated functional groups. The peaks from 3340 to 3430 cm\u22121 were assigned to the \u2013OH stretching vibration from the alcohol, phenol, and carboxylic moieties. The peaks around 3000 cm\u22121 were from C\u2013H stretching vibrations. Those from 3000 to 3030 cm\u22121 indicated the presence of unsaturated carbons Csp2\u2013H like in thymol or \u03b3-terpinene. Peaks in the region of 2800\u20133000 cm\u22121 were assigned to the methyl and methylene C\u2013H symmetric and asymmetric vibrations and originated from all organic compounds (Figure 5a,b). A distinct peak also was observed at ~1706/1743 cm\u22121, which could be attributed to the acetate or aldo (C=O) stretching vibration. These groups were present in geranylacetate/ citronellylacetate and citronellal, active ingredients of the citronella oil. The peaks from 1620 to 1680 cm\u22121 were originating from C=C bonds, isolated or conjugated like in linalool or cinnamaldehyde from cinnamon essential oil. The signal of C=C\u2013C stretching was responsible for the maximum from 1570 to 1585 cm\u22121 [63,64] (Figure S1c,d, Table 4). C\u2013H symmetrical and asymmetrical bending was the cause for the strong signal in the range of 1417\u20131450 cm\u22121. Finally, the \u2013C\u2013O\u2013 stretching and \u2013C\u2013OH deformation vibration of alcohols generated the signals from 1021\u20131121 cm\u22121, including menthol in minzol essential oil or linalool and eugenol from cinnamon essential oil [65].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 9 of 25Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 26\n(a) (b)\nFigure 5.

The elimination of residual organics took place after 225 \u00b0C when a mass loss of 1.28% was recorded together with a sharp and strong exothermic effect at 333.6 \u00b0C on the DSC curve. For this sample, the residual mass was 86.06%.\nFigure 13. The TG-DSC curves, for the ZnO_Ros sample, FTIR 3D diagram of the evolved gases, and its 2D projection in the wavenumber/temperature plan.\nTo conclude, the limonene had a low affinity for ZnO NPs and a high volatility leading to a low loading of samples with essential oils containing limonene, such as orange or grapefruit\u2014both with under 2% load. The limonene represents around half of the mass of the bergamot or limette essential oil; therefore, the overall loading was higher due to the remaining compounds like linalyl acetate and linalool or \u03b3-terpinene and \u03b1/\u03b2-pinene, respectively. The rosemary oil also exhibited a low loading capacity of only 2.77% due to the high content of non-polar hydrocarbons and low content of bulky alcohols. For the citronella essential oil, a mediu loading capacity of 5% was found as compounds like citronellal, geraniol or geranylacetate are more polar due to functional oxygenbased moieties, and therefore exhibited a higher affinity towards ZnO NPs. The high-affinity phenols and alcohols for ZnO NPs led to high loading of essential oils that contain such compounds as major components: thymol in thyme oil, linalool in lavender oil, and menthol in minzol oil. The presence of additional menthone in minzol oil led to a higher load of 12.60%. However, the highest load, 15.62%, was obtained from cinnamon oil due to the presence of (E)-cinnamaldehyde in a high quantity (72%) with the additional presence of linalool and eugenol.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 18 of 25 Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 26\nFigure 14. The TG-DSC curves, for the ZnO_Mint sample, FTIR 3D diagram of the evolved gases and its 2D projection in the wavenumber/temperature plan.\nAs limette essential oil contains limonene and has a low affinity for the NPs, the estimated load was only 3.10%, based on the residual mass of 95.41%. The recorded mass loss at the temperature up to 225 \u00b0C was 2.72%, with an additional 1.64% up to 500 \u00b0C (Figure 15). In the first step, volatile organics were desorbed from the ZnO NP surfaces, as indicated by the endothermic effect from 111.7 \u00b0C, while in the second step, residual organic compounds were oxidized as indicated by the exothermic effect from 336.1 \u00b0C.

The TG-DSC curves, for the ZnO_Mint sample, FTIR 3D diagram of the evolved gases and its 2D projection in the wavenumber/temperature plan.\nThe essential oil used to load ZnO NPs represents ~20% of each sample mass. However, none of the essential oils reached the theoretical value\u2014the maximum load achieved being 15.62%. These results confirmed that some of the essential oil components (especially the non-polar ones) did not interact strongly enough with the ZnO NP surface to be retained."

The TG-DSC curves, for the ZnO_Lime sample, FTIR 3D diagram of the evolved gases, and its 2D projection in the wavenumber/temperature plan.\nThe results employing the diffusion method are shown in Table 6. The evaluation consisted of assessing the size of the zones of inhibition induced by ZnO NPs loaded with\nessential oils, and areas where microbial growth was absent. The tests were performed\nin triplicates and the results were reported as the average diameter. These are directly proporti nal to the sensitivity of the germ used; the more active the substance in the structure of the tested sample, the wider the zone of inhibition of microbial development. The results were read after 24 h of incubation at 37 \u25e6C. ZnO NPs showed a moderate inhibitory effect on the tested bacteria, but the inhibitory activity was more pronounced in combination with the essential oils, thus demonstrating their synergistic effect. The synergistic activity between ZnO NPs and the studied essential oils was most visible, especially for citronella, thyme, and cinnamon essential oils against all the bacterial strains. The antibacterial activity of ZnO was very evident in the case of S. typhimurium, followed by E. coli and L. monocytogenes, demonstrating that ZnO has significant antibacterial potential.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 20 of 25\n* The diameter of the paper disc is included; mean value of three replicates \u00b1 standard deviation; a, b, c, d different small letters indicate statistically significant differences between samples on same column (p < 0.05).\nAll combinations of ZnO with essential oils showed antimicrobial activity on the test microorganism strains by direct contact with the environment. Samples proved less active against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative ones (S.aureus being the most resistant strain), but the differences in sensitivity were not distinct. The inhibitory effect of ZnO on S. aureus was relatively weak (8.7 mm of inhibition diameter), but seven samples loaded with essential oils presented a significant increase in the inhibition zone. For S. aureus strain, only the ZnO NPs loaded with orange, grapefruit, and limette essential oils presented a negligible increase in the diameter of the inhibition zone\u2014these being also the samples with the smallest EO load. For all the other samples, the presence of essential oils along ZnO NPs led to increases in inhibition zones, including samples containing bergamot and rosemary essential oils, which exhibited only 7\u20139 mm diameter of inhibition zones as stand-alone substances; this was likely because the essential oils were sensitizing the bacterial cell to become less resistant to ZnO NPs (Figure 16). The mechanism could be related to the presence of essential oils, which changed the concentration of adenosine triphosphate and/or hyperpolarization of the cell wall, leading to a decrease in the cytoplasmic pH [79], which in turn made it easier for the ZnO NPs to damage the membrane, and zinc ions to bind the proteins and enzymes, disrupting vital processes inside the cell [80]. The combined synergistic antibacterial activity of ZnO and essential oils was demonstrated in this study against both Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria. Overall, the ZnO NP samples loaded with thyme, citronella, and cinnamon oils were the most effective, showing significant areas of inhibition of bacterial growth. We have previously reported strong antimicrobial activity of chitosan or alginate-based films with ZnO and citronella essential oil [13,67]. The literature also reported some antibacterial nanocomposites with thyme essential oil used in specific applications [81,82]. In addition, some packaging films containing ZnO and cinnamon essential oils have been reported lately [83,84]. The antimicrobial activity of ZnO NPs loaded with bergamot [85], orange [86], grapefruit, limette, or minzol essential oils is not well studied. Nevertheless, some studies\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2470 21 of 25\ndirectly used limonene instead of oils to obtain antimicrobial packaging [87]. Similarly, there are some reports on ZnO loaded directly with menthol for wound dressing applications [88].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 22 of 26\nFigure 16.

The loaded nanoparticles can be further used with a polymer matrix to obtain innovative composite materials with specific applications like wound dressing or food packaging [33,89\u201391], tailoring them for prolonged release of the loaded essential oils or for rapid, burst desorption.\n4. Conclusions The obtained ZnO NPs presented good antibacterial activity on all four bacterial strains (better on Gram-negative than on Gram-positive bacteria), supporting further use in medical applications. In this study, we loaded ZnO NPs with ten different essential oils, and the antibacterial activity of the samples was determined. Due to composition and high volatility, some essential oils exhibited low loading capacity, especially those containing nonsubstituted terpenes like limonene (e.g., 1.44% estimated load for orange essential oil). At the same time, the essential oils containing alcohol, aldehyde, and ketone derivatives presented a higher loading capacity (e.g., 15.62% for cinnamon essential oil). Synergic antibacterial activity between ZnO NPs and essential oils was observed for most of the samples, related to the effective load on the surface of ZnO NPs. Therefore, samples with a higher content of strong antibacterial oils like thyme, cinnamon, or citronella essential oils present a higher potential for antibacterial applications (diameter of inhibition zone higher than 15 mm) like wound dressing or food packaging.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Figure S1: The FTIR spectra for the ZnO NPs (a) and ZnO NPs loaded with essential oils (b); detail of the 1000-1800 cm-1 zone (c) and (d); Figure S2.
