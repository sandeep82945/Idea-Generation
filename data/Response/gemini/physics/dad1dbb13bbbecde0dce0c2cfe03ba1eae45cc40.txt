1. **Investigate the use of liquid jets with different geometries, such as sheets or droplets, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in XES and WAXS experiments.** This could be done by comparing the performance of different jet geometries under various experimental conditions, such as different sample concentrations, flow rates, and laser pulse energies.


2. **Develop new methods for synchronizing the laser and X-ray pulses in pumpâ€“probe experiments.** This could be done by using a variety of techniques, such as optical cavities, feedback loops, or active synchronization methods.


3. **Explore the use of different X-ray detectors for XES and WAXS experiments.** This could include the development of new detector technologies with improved energy resolution, sensitivity, and count rate capabilities.


4. **Investigate the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze XES and WAXS data.** This could be done to develop new methods for extracting information from the data, such as identifying and classifying different chemical species or determining the structure of molecules.


5. **Develop new experimental techniques for studying ultrafast processes in liquid samples.** This could include the use of time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray emission spectroscopy, or X-ray scattering techniques.
