 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on machine learning for breast cancer drug design:

1. Explore using different machine learning models besides MobileNetV3 as the backbone for building the quantitative and qualitative prediction models. The paper used MobileNetV3 due to its efficiency and performance, but trying other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures could potentially improve accuracy further.

2. Incorporate additional molecular descriptors and chemical properties into the feature set beyond the 224 used in this study. Expanding the feature representation could allow the models to capture more relevant information to improve prediction.

3. Evaluate the applicability of the proposed workflow on other disease targets and drug discovery problems beyond just breast cancer. The general framework could be validated on datasets for targets like lung cancer, diabetes, etc. 

4. Optimize the genetic algorithm and parameters used for solving the clinical property optimization problem. There may be room to improve the solver through tweaking population size, crossover rates, etc. to get better optimized compounds.

5. Develop a pipeline to actually synthesize and experimentally validate top predicted compounds from the models. Moving from computational prediction to lab validation would be important to demonstrate real-world efficacy of the proposed approach.
