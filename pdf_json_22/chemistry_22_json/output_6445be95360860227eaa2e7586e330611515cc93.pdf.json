However, the current knowledge of the molecular mechanism of selenite reduction remains limited. In this study, a selenite-resistant bacterium was isolated and identified as Proteus sp. YS02. Strain YS02 reduced 93.2% of 5.0 mM selenite to selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) within 24 h, and the produced SeNPs were spherical and localized intracellularly or extracellularly, with an average dimension of 140 \u00b1 43 nm. The morphology and composition of the isolated and purified SeNPs were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids on the surface of the isolated SeNPs. Furthermore, the SeNPs showed excellent antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive and Gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to elucidate the selenite reduction mechanism and biosynthesis of SeNPs. It is revealed that 197 genes were significantly upregulated, and 276 genes were significantly downregulated under selenite treatment. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that genes associated with ABC transporters, sulfur metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and pyruvate dehydrogenase were significantly enhanced, indicating selenite is reduced by sulfite reductase with PPP and pyruvate dehydrogenase supplying reducing equivalents and energy. This work suggests numerous genes are involved in the response to selenite stress, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of selenite bioreduction with the formation of SeNPs.\nKeywords: Proteus sp.

            "text": "Selenium (Se) is a metalloid that plays a vital role in maintaining human health (Chen et\u00a0 al., 2021). It can replace sulfur in cysteine and be\u00a0 co-translationally incorporated as selenocysteine (SeCys) in selenoproteins involved in biological processes, including detoxification, anti-inflammation, antioxidant defense, and thyroid functioning. A trace amount of selenium is important for human health. Selenium deficiency in humans has been associated with cardiovascular disease, thyroid dysfunction, and immune system dysfunction (Pedrero et\u00a0 al., 2006). Selenium supplementation can protect animals and ameliorate the toxic effects of heavy metals (Ge et\u00a0 al., 2021), improve the clinical symptoms of heart failure (Al-Mubarak et\u00a0 al., 2021), stimulate the immune response toward cancer cells (Yazdi et\u00a0al., 2012), and alleviate oxidative stress-induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury (Song et\u00a0 al., 2017a). However, selenium is also known as a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d element\u2014it is essential to human and animal health in trace amounts but is toxic in excess (Nancharaiah and Lens, 2015b). Moreover, the toxicity of selenium is not merely defined by its concentration but is also dependent on its speciation. In nature, selenium exists in different forms, including selenite (SeO32\u2212), selenate (SeO42\u2212), selenide (Se2\u2212), and as an elementary substance (Se0). Among these, selenite is the most toxic form for aquatic life and humans because of its high mobility in aqueous environments and high bioavailability. However, elemental selenium is biologically inert and generally thought to be\u00a0 non-toxic (Song et\u00a0 al., 2017a). Furthermore, compared with selenium, nanosized elemental selenium particles possess much higher bioactivity and biosafety properties, including improved antioxidant, anticancer functions, and antibacterial activity. Therefore, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) may be\u00a0 a more valuable selenium-adding form and therapeutic agent for human health and are attracting increasing attention.\nMicroorganisms are crucial in the global biogeochemical cycle of selenium on the Earth\u2019s surface. Microbial transformation of selenite and selenate can occur both aerobically or anaerobically. More importantly, selenite/selenate transformation is often accompanied by the formation of SeNPs existing either inside the cytoplasm, within the periplasm, or extracellularly (Ojeda et\u00a0 al., 2020). Se0 particles formed by Se-oxyanion reducing microorganisms, including Azospirillum thiophilum (Tugarova et\u00a0al., 2018), Azospirillum brasilense (Kamnev et\u00a0al., 2017, 2021), yeast (Kieliszek et\u00a0al., 2015, 2016; Jim\u00e9nez-Lamana et\u00a0 al., 2018), Enterobacter cloacae Z0206 (Song et\u00a0 al., 2017a), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SeITE02 (Lampis et\u00a0 al., 2017), Bacillus sp. Y3 (Yasir et\u00a0 al., 2020), Comamonas testosteroni S44 (Tan et\u00a0 al., 2018), etc., have been reported. So far, it has been found that bacterial Se(IV) reduction may occur through enzymatic or nonenzymatic mechanisms (Tugarova and Kamnev, 2017). Specifically, the non-enzymatic reduction of selenite is mediated by biogenic glutathione, iron siderophores, and sulfide (Nancharaiah and Lens, 2015a). For enzyme-dependent reduction, reductases encompassing sulfite reductase (Huang et\u00a0 al., 2021), glutathione reductase (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2019),\nthioredoxin reductase (Hunter, 2014), SerT (Tan et\u00a0 al., 2018), flavoprotein CsrF (Xia et\u00a0 al., 2018), and fumarate reductase (Song et\u00a0 al., 2017b) have been reported to be\u00a0 potentially involved in Se(IV) reduction in various bacterial species, suggesting the reduction of selenite occurs through diverse mechanisms. However, the current knowledge of the molecular mechanism of microbial selenite reduction is still limited. For example, it is largely unknown how bacterial cells respond to selenite stress and what molecular mechanism is utilized by microorganisms to reduce selenite. Therefore, the comprehensive studies of the mechanism of selenite reduction at the genome level by applying comparative transcriptomics analysis, microarray analysis, and proteomic analysis are urgently needed.\nIn the present study, the bacterial strain YS02 exhibiting an efficient selenite transformation ability was isolated from soil. Selenite reduction assay showed that strain YS02 can transform 93.2% of 5.0 mM selenite to SeNPs within 24 h, serving as an eco-friendly cell factory for the biogenesis of SeNPs. However, the exact molecular mechanism of selenite reduction by this strain is not clear. Therefore, the transcriptome response of YS02 cells exposed to sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) was investigated intensively using comparative transcriptomics analysis to clarify the possible mechanism of selenite reduction and biogenesis of SeNPs by the isolate YS02. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of the SeNPs against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, was also investigated to explore the potential of the SeNPs as key assets in the future of healthcare."

            "text": "Microbial and enzymic activities in soil play a critical role in the global selenium cycle; thus, Se-rich sediments or soils are an ideal source for isolating selenite-reducing bacteria (El-Ramady et\u00a0 al., 2015; Eswayah et\u00a0 al., 2016). In this study, 15 bacterial strains were isolated from seleniferous soil. Of these, isolate 02 (YS02) showed the best growth performance on YEP plates containing 10 mM Na2SeO3. BLAST search results indicated that the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain YS02 exhibited 99% sequence similarity to that of Proteus mirabilis ATCC 29906(T). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis also showed that\nstrain YS02 belongs to the genus Proteus, with the highest similarity to P. mirabilis (Figure\u00a0 1). Therefore, the strain YS02 was identified as Proteus sp. YS02. Proteus spp. are widely distributed in the environment, including animal guts, soils, and water. They possess the ability to tolerate or utilize polluting compounds (e.g., heavy metals and antibiotics) and promote plant growth. Moreover, several members of the genus Proteus, such as P. mirabilis YC801 (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2018a) or P. hauseri QW4 (Khalilian et\u00a0 al., 2015), have been reported to reduce selenite/selenate to Se0 and biosynthesize SeNPs, allowing for the possibility of exploring these microorganisms in selenium bioremediation and synthesis of SeNPs. Therefore, the isolate YS02 was selected for subsequent study.\nSynthesis of SeNPs by Proteus sp. YS02 and Their Characterization After cultivation of Proteus sp. YS02\u00a0 in selenite-containing YEP culture medium, SeO32\u2212 reduction and Se0 formation were observed within 6 h indicated by the formation of a reddish coloration in the culture medium that is a typical characteristic of microbially produced Se0 (Figure\u00a0 2A). Furthermore, it is interesting that the SeO32\u2212 reduction and Se0 biogenesis were in accordance with the strain growth kinetics; only 2.9% of the initial SeO32\u2212 were reduced within 6 h, while most of the remaining selenite (>73%) was depleted during the exponential growth phase (between 9 and 15 h), and then nearly exhausted after 24 h of incubation (Figure\u00a02B). Selenite reduction being tightly related to the bacterial growth phase has been reported for other bacteria, including Alcaligenes faecalis Se03 (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2018b), S. maltophilia SeITE02 (Lampis et\u00a0al., 2017), and Lysinibacillus sp. (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2019), suggesting that reducing compounds and/or cellular reductases (whose secretion and consumption are inextricably associated with the growth state of the microbes; Wang et\u00a0 al., 2018b) catalyze selenite reduction. Moreover, the depletion of SeO32\u2212 was accompanied by the production of Se0\u2014after 24 h of cultivation, about 93.2% of the initial selenite were transformed to Se0 (Figure\u00a0 2B). In contrast, no visible color change or Se0 production was noted in control flasks that contained merely strain YS02 (see Figure\u00a0 2A, right-hand flask) or selenite (data not shown), suggesting the active participation of bacterial isolate YS02\u00a0 in selenite biotransformation and Se0 production.\nAs many bacteria link the bioreduction of selenite to Se0 with the production of SeNPs, we\u00a0 investigated whether Proteus sp. YS02 has the capacity to transform selenite to SeNPs. As shown in Figure\u00a0 3, TEM analysis clearly revealed electron-dense nanoparticles (Se0 nanoparticles) both inside and outside of the cells. However, the Se0 nanoparticles could be\u00a0 observed mainly in the extracellular space (Figure\u00a0 3C). Meanwhile, the formation of nanoparticles was not detected in cultures grown in the absence of selenite (Figure\u00a0 3A). Interestingly, some extracellular nanoparticles appeared to be\u00a0 associated with empty ghost cells (cell walls appearing damaged; indicated by red arrows in Figure\u00a0 3C), suggesting that this extracellular location is probably the consequence of cell lysis.

Moreover, SEM analyses (Figures 4A,B) also confirmed the presence of extracellular Se0 nanoparticles (Figure\u00a0 4B, white arrows). The micrographs showed an accumulation of electron-dense particles attached to the outer side of the external cell, while these particles were not observed in the cells grown on YEP without the selenite (see Figure\u00a0 4A).

As shown in Figure\u00a05, the purified SeNPs appear as spherical nanoparticles of varied sizes. The EDX spectra also clearly confirmed the presence of selenium\u2014the spherical nanoparticles exhibit Se-specific absorption peaks at 1.37, 11.22, and 12.49 keV. Moreover, DLS analysis of purified SeNPs revealed an average dimension of 140 \u00b1 43 nm, similar to those found in Azoarcus sp. CIB (174 \u00b1 36 nm; Fern\u00e1ndez-Llamosas et\u00a0al., 2016) and in V. natriegens (136 \u00b1 31 nm; Fern\u00e1ndez-Llamosas et\u00a0al., 2017). More, the produced SeNPs revealed a negative zeta-potential (\u221234.2 mV), suggesting the colloidal stability of SeNPs in the water phase. In order to investigate the possible existence of bioorganic capping layers that could contribute to the synthesis and stability of SeNPs, FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the isolated and purified SeNPs was performed (Figure\u00a06). This technique is highly sensitive to the presence of biomaterials covering the SeNPs surface and has been widely used for their characterization (see, e.g., Kamnev et\u00a0 al. (2017, 2021), Tugarova et\u00a0 al. (2018) and references cited therein). The FTIR spectrum in Figure\u00a0 6 shows a number of absorption bands typically observed for biogenic SeNPs of microbial origin. The main important bands include: a very strong broad non-symmetric envelope around 3,600\u20133,200 cm\u22121 (featuring stretching vibrations of H-bonded O\u2013H and N\u2013H moieties); a series of bands at ~3,000\u20132,800 cm\u22121 (various characteristic stretching vibrations of C\u2013H bonds in alkanoic groups); weak but typical bands at 1,741 cm\u22121 (stretching vibrations of the C=O group in ester moieties), 1,451 cm\u22121 (bending vibrations of \u2013CH3/\u2013CH2\u2013 groups) and 1,389 cm\u22121 (symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic \u2013COO\u2212 groups in amino acid side chains and/or carboxylated polysaccharides); a characteristic pair of bands between 1,637 and 1,537 cm\u22121 (the amide I\u00a0 and II bands of proteins, respectively); a series of overlapping bands at ~1,200\u2013950 cm\u22121 featuring\nFIGURE\u00a03 | TEM analysis of Proteus sp.

As was mentioned above, these biomacromolecular components are often found in surface capping layers of SeNPs produced by various microorganisms. Note that carboxylic groups (featured by the weak band at 1,389 cm\u22121 ascribed to their symmetric stretching vibrations; the accompanying antisymmetric vibrations of variable location at higher wavenumbers are known to be\u00a0 often masked by stronger amide I/amide II bands; Kamnev et\u00a0 al., 2017, 2021; Tugarova et\u00a0al., 2018) are responsible for the negative zeta potentials typically found for such SeNPs in aqueous suspensions (Tugarova and Kamnev, 2017). Finally, traces of water (which can form strong H-bonds with polar biomolecular groups and thus might be\u00a0 not fully removed by freeze-drying; see \u201cSeNPs Preparation and Characterization\u201d) could contribute to the increased stretching O\u2013H region (3,600\u20133,200 cm\u22121) as well as indirectly to the amide I\u00a0region by its bending (scissoring) H\u2013O\u2013H vibrations which are observed at ~1,640\u20131,650 cm\u22121 (Kamnev et\u00a0 al., 2021).\nFIGURE\u00a05 | SEM\u2013EDX analysis of purified SeNPs produced by Proteus sp.

To evaluate potential biomedical utilizations of the SeNPs produced by YS02, their antibacterial activity against different specific strains including both Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) and Gram-positive (B. subtilis and S. epidermidis) bacteria was evaluated by the plate antibacterial test.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 7, SeNPs at a specific concentration could effectively inhibit the microbial growth. Furthermore, it is interesting that the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) was more influenced by the SeNPs compared to that of the Gram-positive bacteria as indicated by corresponding inhibition zones. Application of antibiotic (Kanamycin) provided the highest growth inhibition zones with sizes of 18.4 mm and 22.9 mm for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. However, the SeNPs also showed significant antibacterial effect with inhibition zone sizes between 13.5 and 12.5 mm for E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. For the Gram-positive bacteria, smaller inhibition zones were observed after the application of SeNPs: the sizes of inhibition zones were 11.9 mm for B. subtilis and 9.8 mm for S. epidermidis. Similarly, it was also found that the growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa was most influenced by PVA/Chitosan/SeNPs nanocomposite while the effect on B. subtilis was the lowest (Menazea et\u00a0 al., 2020). These results could be\u00a0attributed to the distinct differences in the cell wall structure/cell surface between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria\u2014the former have a stronger molecular network in the cell wall, which could present more difficulties for selenite ions to penetrate the cell than in Gram-negative bacteria (Truong et\u00a0 al., 2021). It has recently been reported that the bactericidal activity of SeNPs can be\u00a0 explained in terms of changing the membrane potential, depleting ATP, promoting ROS production, and disrupting the membrane (Huang et\u00a0al., 2020).\nOverall, the findings reported in the present study indicate that the SeNPs produced by YS02 have a strong bactericidal effect on the pathogenic bacteria and have a potential to be\u00a0used as a substitute for antibiotics in clinical applications. However, further research is needed to address the precise mechanism of the antibacterial action of the SeNPs.\nOverview of Proteus sp. YS02 Transcriptomic Profile Although selenite reduction mechanisms and SeNPs synthesis have been studied in several bacterial species, they have not been completely clarified (Tugarova and Kamnev, 2017; Tugarova et\u00a0 al., 2020). The global transcriptome of the Proteus sp. YS02 cells was analyzed by RNA-seq technology to clarify the molecular mechanism of selenite reduction and production of SeNPs. Overall, six libraries (CK-1, CK-2, CK-3, Se-1, Se-2, and Se-3) were generated and sequenced using a DNBSEQ-T7 sequencer, and about 255 million pair-end clean reads (2 \u00d7 150 bp long) were obtained. The number and quality scores of the aligned reads are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and were sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the assembly and coverage."

Following comparison with CK (control sample without Se treatment), a total of 473 DEGs were found to have been expressed during Se treatment, among which 197 genes were significantly upregulated, and 276 genes were significantly downregulated (Figure\u00a08). Based on GO functional analyses, these DEGs could be\u00a0 classified into three main GO categories, including molecular functions (MF), biological processes (BP), and cellular components (CC).

            "text": "Since selenium is one of the chalcogen elements, it is proposed that reductases in sulfur metabolic pathways may catalyze the reduction of Se(IV; Tan et\u00a0 al., 2018; Huang et\u00a0 al., 2021). In this study, the expressions of genes responsible for sulfate assimilation metabolism were significantly upregulated in the presence of selenite. The ABC transporter complex CysAWTP is composed\nof two CysA ATP-binding proteins, two transmembrane proteins (CysT and CysW), and a CysP solute-binding protein. It has been reported to be\u00a0 responsible for sulfate/thiosulfate import in many microbes (Han and Lee, 2006). It is interesting that selenite treatment upregulated expression of cysA, cysW, cysU, and CysP (the fold changes were 2.50, 2.79, 2.64, and 2.58 log2(FC) while comparing Se vs. CK, respectively), suggesting the sulfate transport system permease is responsible for the transmembrane transport of selenite in Proteus sp. YS02. The uptake and transport of selenite in E. coli have also been reported to be\u00a0 controlled by the sulfate transport complex ABC encoded by the cysAWTP operon (Tugarova and Kamnev, 2017). Furthermore, the gene expressions of cysN (encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 1), cysD (encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 2), cysH (encoding phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase), cysJ [encoding sulfite reductase (NADPH) flavoprotein alphacomponent], and cysI [encoding sulfite reductase (NADPH) hemoprotein beta-component], were all significantly upregulated (2.27, 2.65, 3.62, 3.59, and 3.69-fold, respectively). Sulfite reductase (cysJI in this case) was reported to catalyze the reduction of selenite/selenate to Se0 with NAD(P)H serving as an electron donor in bacterial isolates Providencia rettgeri HF16 (Huang et\u00a0al., 2021) and C. testosteroni S44 (Tan et\u00a0 al., 2018). Similarly, in this study, the CysJ and CysI expression was significantly upregulated in the presence of selenite, suggesting that selenite is more likely to be\u00a0 transformed via a sulfite reductase-mediated metabolic pathway in YS02.\nThe PPP is one of the major sources of reducing power (NADPH) and metabolic intermediates that are required for biosynthetic processes (Kruger and von Schaewen, 2003; Wushensky et\u00a0 al., 2018). It is interesting that genes involved in the PPP pathway, such as zwf (encoding glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase), deoC (encoding deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase), tktA (encoding transketolase), and deoB (encoding phosphopentomutase), were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, the expression of aceE (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component) and pdhC (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 component) were also upregulated in the presence of selenite. The pyruvate dehydrogenase system catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate with the production of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), NADH, and CO2 (Karsten et\u00a0 al., 2002). Taken together, the significant enhancement of the PPP genes and pyruvate dehydrogenase under selenite treatment confirmed their involvement in selenite biotransformation by supplying reducing equivalents and enhancing energy metabolism.\nAdditionally, the reduction and detoxification of selenite ions by microbes may be\u00a0accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species that can damage cell membranes or DNA (Tetteh et\u00a0 al., 2014; Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2018). It is noteworthy that the expression of several genes encoding enzymes classified as oxidoreductases and transferases, such as nrd (encoding ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase), hcp (encoding hydroxylamine reductase), cysG (encoding uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase), ndh (encoding NADH dehydrogenase), and hisG (encoding ATP phosphoribosyltransferase) were also upregulated, indicating that these enzymes may be\u00a0 associated with oxidative stress defense and maintenance of redox homeostasis FIGURE\u00a08 | The volcano plots of genes for Proteus sp.

However, the expression of several expected antioxidant protein-encoding genes, such as gsh (encoding glutathione synthetase), gor (encoding glutathione reductase), gorA (encoding glutathione-disulfide reductase), sodB (encoding superoxide dismutase), trxA (encoding thioredoxin), and trxB (encoding thioredoxin reductase), showed no significant change under selenite treatment. This was similar to the findings of Song et\u00a0 al. (2017b), who showed that selenite treatment caused a 2.42-fold increase in fumarate reductase abundance but had no effect on the expression of gsh, gor, or trxB."
