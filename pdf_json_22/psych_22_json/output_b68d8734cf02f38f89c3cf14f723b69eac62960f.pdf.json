    "abstractText": "Background: Social Anxiety disorder (SAD) is common worldwide. However, data from Saudi Arabia is deficient. This study aims to determine the prevalence of SAD across Saudi medical students and its associations with sociodemo\u2010 graphic factors and their academic performance. Methods: The main outcome was presence/absence of SAD and the secondary outcome was its level of severity. These were assessed from the Social Phobia Inventory. Associated factors included sociodemographic variables, as well as educational characteristics of students. Descriptive statistics were reported as counts and percentages, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of 5896 Saudi medical students who participated in the study, the prevalence of SAD was almost 51%. While 8.21% and 4.21% had reported severe and very severe SAD, respectively. Older age students were at lower risk of developing SAD (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89 \u2013 0.96). In contrast, females (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01 \u2013 1.26), students enrolled in private colleges and colleges implementing non\u2010problem\u2010based learning (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09 \u2013 1.52 and OR = 1.29. 95% CI = 1.15 \u2013 1.46 respectively) were at higher risk. A significant elevated risk of SAD was found among students who had previously failed, and had a low GPA. Conclusion: SAD is prevalent among the sampled population, and different associated factors were identified. Current results could raise the awareness of faculty members and healthcare providers towards early detection and management of these cases.",

Associated factors included sociodemographic variables, as well as educational characteristics of students.

While 8.21% and 4.21% had reported severe and very severe SAD, respectively. Older age students were at lower risk of developing SAD (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.89 \u2013 0.96). In contrast, females (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01 \u2013 1.26), students enrolled in private colleges and colleges implementing non\u2011problem\u2011based learning (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09 \u2013 1.52 and OR = 1.29. 95% CI = 1.15 \u2013 1.46 respectively) were at higher risk. A significant elevated risk of SAD was found among students who had previously failed, and had a low GPA.\nConclusion: SAD is prevalent among the sampled population, and different associated factors were identified. Current results could raise the awareness of faculty members and healthcare providers towards early detection and management of these cases.\nKeywords: Social phobia, Social anxiety disorder, Prevalence, Medical students, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The most common reported presentation of SAD was fear of speech-making [2]. SAD can occur in any public place where a person feels observed and\n*Correspondence: wmaljohani@iau.edu.sa\n1 Department of Family and Community Medicine, College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, P.O.

Individuals will develop different cognitive and somatic anxiety symptoms characterized by autonomic stimulation, such as blushing, tremors, increased sweating, and tachycardia [4].\nIt is one of the most predominant anxiety disorders among adolescents and younger aged groups, impairing their functioning capabilities if left untreated [5]. In addition, its high prevalence would make it the third most common mental disorder after depression and alcohol abuse [6].\nThe lifetime prevalence of SAD has been reported in various studies, ranging between 3\u201313% [1]. The prevalence of SAD among university students has been assessed in multiple studies. In Jordan, Ghana, Nigeria, Brazil and Sweden Universities, the prevalence was around 9\u201316.1% [5, 7\u201310]. A higher prevalence of SAD has been found among university students in Ethiopia and India (26%, 31.1%) respectively [11, 12]. Moreover, it was associated with female gender, low educational attainment, positive personal or family history of mental disorders, psychiatric medication use, and lack of social support [2, 13]. Studies have shown that SAD has led to low self-esteem and impaired body image, consequently negatively impacting on students\u2019 academic performance [14, 15].\nFurthermore, SAD is considered a significant risk factor for developing major depressive disorders and alcohol abuse disorder [16].\nAlthough various studies worldwide have assessed the prevalence and impact of SAD among different populations, Saudi Arabia\u2019s data is scarce. After a thorough literature search, few data regarding SAD among medical students in small cities in Saudi Arabia have been obtained. Medical students are more exposed to academic challenges, including the lengthiest education and training period, the stress of multiple written and clinical examinations, oral presentations, interaction with patients and their families, and exposure to serious life and death issues. Consequently, medical students particularly require intact physical and mental well-being, strong personality structures, and a willingness to attain professional and communication skills to deal with academic challenges [17]. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of SAD among medical students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and determine its association with students\u2019 sociodemographic factors and academic performance."

            "text": "The present study demonstrated that about half of the examined medical students in Saudi Arabia screened positive for SAD. Moreover, 8.21% and 4.21% of students had severe and very severe SAD symptoms, respectively. Other studies worldwide have also investigated the prevalence of SAD in undergraduate universities and medical students. Nevertheless, comparing our findings with these studies is difficult because of variations in the methodologies, study tools used, participants\u2019 backgrounds, social factors, and cultures. In agreement with the findings from the current study, Al-Hazmi et\u00a0al., conducted a study among 504 medical students from Taibah university, Saudi Arabia, using the SPIN questionnaire and reported that 13.5% of the participating medical students had severe to very severe SAD [21]. Findings from the present study were higher than Desalegn et\u00a0al.\u2019s study which demonstrated that 31.2% (95% CI 27.3 to 35.6%) of undergraduate health science students in Ethiopia had SAD symptoms [24]. A study among 525 medical students in Germany revealed that 12.2% reported SAD symptoms [25]. In Iran, Afshari surveyed 400 medical sciences students using the SPIN tool and demonstrated that 41.5% and 13.2% of students had moderate and high SAD, respectively [26].\nFurthermore, the findings of this study showed that SAD is less common among older aged students, which is consistent with Al-Hazmi et\u00a0 al. findings [21]. The decreased prevalence in older students may be attributed to their exposure to the clinical settings, as senior students tend to interact more with patients and are\nmore experienced in interviewing skills. For instance, Alotaibi et\u00a0al., found that older aged groups and higherlevel students showed a higher score on the positive attitude scale towards learning communication skills [27]. Moreover, Davis et\u00a0al.\u2019s study showed that the final-year students had better communication skills than first-year students, indicating that they have a better vision and understanding of the importance of communication skills [28]. An expected and true finding of the current study is that social anxiety rates are higher among females compared to males. This finding is relevant to the (DSM-5) statement, which revealed that the prevalence of SAD is higher in females, and this difference is more pronounced among adolescents [4]. A similar finding was obtained by Xu et\u00a0 al.\u2019s data survey from the National Epidemiologic Sample on Alcohol and Related Conditions among the United States adult population where"

            "text": "the lifetime prevalence of SAD was higher in females than in males (5.7% and 4.2% respectively) [29]. Additionally, studies among the Canadian and European populations have shown similar results [30\u201334]. This outcome is contrary to Elhadad et\u00a0al.\u2019s study on only 380 medical students in Abha, Saudi Arabia, which found that SAD rates were higher among males. However, the Elhadad study population was obtained from a single institution and a relatively small sample size, hence, their results are less generalizable [35]. A possible explanation of why females are at higher risk of developing SAD can be best understood from a \u201cvulnerabilitystress perspective\u201d. Exposure to variable psychosocial stressors and an increased biological and psychological vulnerability towards anxiety in females may explain the sex differences in anxiety disorders [36]. Interestingly, the current study found higher SAD rates among divorced, widowed, and singles than married ones. This finding supports the result of the systematic review conducted by Toe et\u00a0 al., which found that SAD was consistently associated with social isolation, such as being unmarried or living alone. Whether social isolation causes social anxiety or vice versa is still unclear [37].\nMoreover, this study demonstrates that students who were enrolled in institutions implementing traditional teaching methods had an increased risk of having phobia compared to the students in PBL institutions, which indicates the effect of different learning styles on students\u2019\nmental well-being [38]. Furthermore, it draws attention to the nature of PBL, which revolves around the idea that a problem is of crucial importance in learning. It focuses on community problems, scientific problems, and real-life scenarios, motivating trainees and boosting their confidence. PBL promotes a deep learning approach rather than a superficial one by making trainees interact with information in a multilevel fashion. The absence of a teacher role in PBL increases the sense of responsibility towards self-learning and promotes personal development [39]. In other words, PBL is student-centered and encourages communication and teamwork through multiple tools of assessments, including presentations, small group discussions, seminars, assignments, and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations. The repeated exposure to social interactions and public speaking through PBL may increase students\u2019 confidence in social and clinical settings [40].\nMany studies have reported high levels of stress and psychological comorbidities among Saudi medical students [41]. However, studies examining the differences between governmental and private medical schools in Saudi Arabia are limited. Moreover, we propose that the differences in teaching and learning approaches could explain finding a lower risk of SAD among governmental college students than those in private colleges.

In addition, private medical school students were more likely to adopt a strategic rather than a deep learning approach [42], which suggests that the difference in SAD levels between governmental and private medical college students may be explained by the differences in learning methods.\nSAD was found to be associated with impairment in education and work productivity [43, 44]. A large cohort, population-based study in Sweden showed an inverse association between SAD and academic performance at different levels [43]. In line with this finding, the current study revealed that a lower GPA was linked to a higher risk of SAD; hence it was more frequently reported among students with a previous failure in medical school. Furthermore, previous Saudi studies have also reported a similar inverse relationship [21, 35]. This may be explained by the fact that medical school environments are highly competitive; students are working hard to achieve higher grades and GPA to look for opportunities in the postgraduate residency programs and jobs. These stressors make medical students vulnerable to mental health problems [45]. Moreover, the presence of students with low GPA or previous failure with their high achieving colleagues could be another burden on them. It might lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, being inactive in the group work, and consequently having social anxiety symptoms more frequently than their peers.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first Saudi study investigating SAD among a large sample of medical students from all regions in the kingdom. However, some limitations exist. Firstly, the sample only included medical students and did not represent the general Saudi population. Secondly, since the design of the study was cross-sectional, temporality and causality between factors could not be assured. Additionally, despite of the high response rate the possibility of response bias could not be eliminated. Finally, the SPIN tool utilized in the study is a screening tool, and the highrisk cases need a further diagnostic step by a clinical interview."

            "text": "The current study found that SAD was highly prevalent among the investigated medical students in Saudi Arabia. Older students had lower odds of SAD. On the other hand, being female, studying in private colleges or with non-problem-based learning methods, and having a history of a previous failure in the medical school or a lower GPA were identified as factors that had higher odds of SAD. These findings emphasize the positive role of the\nuniversity faculty members, counselors, and mentors in supporting these students and encouraging them to participate in curricular and extracurricular activities. In addition, evaluation of the educational environment and the types of the teaching curriculum in Saudi Medical schools is necessary to optimize students learning experience and maintain their psychological wellbeing. Along with enhancing the primary care providers and mental health care experts to accomplish their role of early detection and management of these cases.\nAbbreviations SAD: Social Anxiety Disorder; DSM\u20115: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; KSA: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; GPA: Grade Point Average; PBL: Problem\u2011Based Learning; ASSIST: Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the efforts of medical students who participated in the data collection.
