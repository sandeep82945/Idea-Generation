Impact of Early Diagnosis and Treatment on Economic Burden: Investigate how early diagnosis and treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) affect healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs over time. This research could explore whether earlier intervention can reduce the economic burden by preventing disease progression and the severity of flares, potentially leading to lower hospitalization rates, emergency room visits, and inpatient stays.

Comparative Effectiveness of Treatment Regimens: Conduct a comparative effectiveness study of different treatment regimens for LN to identify the most cost-effective approaches. This study would assess the economic and clinical outcomes of various treatment strategies, including newer biologic therapies, conventional immunosuppressants, and corticosteroid-sparing approaches, to determine which treatments provide the best balance between efficacy, side effects, and cost.

Patient Quality of Life and Economic Burden: Examine the relationship between the quality of life of patients with LN and the economic burden of the disease. This research could assess how improvements in clinical management and patient support services impact both patient-reported outcomes (such as quality of life and disease activity) and economic outcomes, including direct and indirect healthcare costs.

Predictive Models for Healthcare Resource Utilization and Costs: Develop predictive models using machine learning or statistical analysis to identify factors that contribute to higher HCRU and costs in patients with LN. These models could help healthcare providers and insurers identify high-risk patients early and implement targeted interventions to manage costs and improve patient outcomes.

Long-term Economic Impact of LN on Patients and Healthcare Systems: Conduct a longitudinal study to assess the long-term economic impact of LN on patients and the healthcare system. This study would track patients over an extended period to capture the full spectrum of direct and indirect costs associated with LN, including the impact of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease development, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease's economic burden over time.
