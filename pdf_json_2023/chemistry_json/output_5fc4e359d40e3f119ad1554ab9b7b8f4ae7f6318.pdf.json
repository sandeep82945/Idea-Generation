    "abstractText": "Recent successes in developing small-molecule degraders that act through the ubiquitin system have spurred efforts to extend this technology to other mechanisms, including the autophagosomal-lysosomal pathway. Therefore, reports of autophagosome tethering compounds (ATTECs) have received considerable attention from the drug development community. ATTECs are based on the target recruitment to LC3/GABARAP, a family of membrane-bound proteins that tether autophagy receptors to the autophagosome. In order to validate the existing ligands, we rigorously tested target engagement of reported ATTEC ligands and handles. Surprisingly, using various biophysical methods, most available ligands did not interact with their designated target LC3. Intrigued by the idea of developing ATTECs, we evaluated the druggability of LC3/GABARAP by in silico docking and large scale crystallographic fragment screening. The data revealed that most fragments bound to the HP2, but not the HP1 pocket of the LC3interacting region (LIR) docking site, suggesting favorable druggability of this binding pocket. Here, we present diverse comprehensively validated ligands for future ATTEC development.",

B) Dihydronovobiocin bound to LC3A with an enlarged panel of the binding interface by interactions towards K49 and L53 and binding to the HP2 via hydrophobic interactions (pdb: 6TBE). C) Chemical structures of compounds, published to bind to LC3/GABARAPs with exemplary structures shown with all structures depicted in SI Figure S1.\nTargeted protein degradation (TPD) has received great deal of attention based on the potential of chemical\ndegraders to become a new modality in drug development.1 Two major strategies are currently used:\nmolecular glues (glues) and PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras).2 Glues bind to an E3 ligase and\nrecruit a protein of interest (POI) with their solvent exposed moieties. This chemically induced proximity\nof the POI and the E3 ligase results in ubiquitination of the POI and subsequently in its proteasomal\ndegradation. PROTACs trigger selective degradation by a similar mechanism but they are chimeric\nmolecules using two distinct ligands, one binding to an E3 ligase and one to the POI, connected by an\nappropriate linker moiety.3 PROTACs and glues have hugely expand the druggable target space as they can\nbind anywhere to a POI and not only to a specific binding site relevant to disease development.\nAdditionally, their properties of acting catalytically and often degrading the POI highly selectively bears a\npromise that these new drug modalities could be effective at very low compound concentrations reducing\ndrug toxicity.4 Spawned by the potential of selective degraders in drug development, new pathways have\nbeen explored to extend the toolbox that can be utilized for the design of these molecules. Among them\nare LYTACs5 (LYsosome\u2010TArgeting Chimeras) for the degradation of membrane proteins as well as ATTECs6\n(AuTophagosome TEthering Compound) which hijack the autophagy/lysosomal pathway for selective\ndegradation of POIs. Excitingly, these ubiquitin independent systems would also allow degradation of large\norganelles, pathogens and protein complexes.\nMacro-autophagy (Autophagy hereafter) is a fundamental cellular process regulating degradation and\nrecycling of cellular components,7, 8 also allowing the removal of bulky cytosolic cargo, such as large protein\ncomplexes, lipid droplets, portions of and whole organelles, and even bacteria that invaded the\ncytoplasm.9, 10 Cargo degradation is achieved by enclosure into a double-membrane vesicle\n(autophagosome) followed by autophagosome trafficking to the lysosome for degradation. Autophagy is\nan evolutionarily conserved complex process orchestrated by ~40 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins, which\ninclude, among others, the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifiers (Atg8 in yeast) LC3A, LC3B, LC3C,\nGABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2 proteins (LC3/GABARAP hereafter).11 LC3/GABARAP recruit\ncargo-receptor-complexes by a short sequence motif called the LIR (LC3-Interacting Region), mediating\nautophagosomal recruitment and degradation by interaction with the LDS (LIR docking site) (Figure 1, left\nplot).12-14 In addition to the LDS, LC3/GABARAPs possess an additional interaction site located at the\nopposite face of the LDS (Figure 1A, right plot), reminiscent of a hydrophobic binding patch present in\nubiquitin. Accordingly, this site binds to several ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM) and was therefore\nnamed UIM docking site (UDS).15 Similar to the E3 ligase dependent TPD, small molecules binding to LDS\nand the UDS probably interferes with cargo recruitment to LC3/GABARAP proteins and could be developed\ninto small molecule degraders by recruitment of targets to the autophagosome.16 However, discovery of\npotent LC3/GABARAP ligands has remained challenging, possibly due to the conformational plasticity of\nLC3/GABARAP resulting in at least partial occlusion of the LDS.17 First, LC3A/B targeting reversible ligands\nsuch as the antibiotic Novobiocin18, covalent lysine targeting ligands19 as well as a number of low molecular\nweight fragments (overviewed in Figure 1C) have been described binding to the LDS,20 but no highly potent\nligands or ligands for the four remaining LC3/GABARAPs have been described. Interestingly, in 2019, first\nATTECs have been reported suggesting that the autophagy degradation pathway can be exploited for the\ndesign of selective degrader small molecules.6 In this study, the authors presented a mechanism, where\nsmall molecules mediated the autophagosomal degradation of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) by\nLC3A/LC3B recruitment. Subsequently, the identified compounds (10O5/compound 4 and\n8F20/compound 3) have been used as LC3 ligands for ATTEC design, targeting diverse proteins including\nthe bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4)21 and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT),22\nsuggesting a broad utility of these ligands for degrader design. However, as ATTEC development is still in\nits infancy, no tool compounds such as autophagy pathway inhibitors are available that could serve as\ncontrols for the proposed degradation mechanism. In addition, we realized that thorough biophysical\ncharacterization, evaluation, cellular target engagement or cell-based controls for the developed ATTEC\nligands was largely lacking. Given our interest in the development of new degrader molecules and the\nautophagy pathways, we rigorously evaluated current LC3 ligands (SI Figure S1) by biophysical binding\nassays in vitro as well as in cell lysates. Surprisingly, we failed to detect any interaction for some of the\npublished LC3 ligands using an array of assay systems suggesting that these ligands potentially act through\nalternative mechanisms. Intrigued by the concept of hijacking the autophagosomal pathway through\ntarget recruitment to LC3/GABARAP, we broadly evaluated the druggability of the LDS and UDS by in silico\nscreening of an in-house compound library followed by biophysical validation as well as by high throughput\ncrystallographic fragment screening. The campaigns revealed good druggability of the HP2 site within the\nLDS, a shallow binding pocket interacting with hydrophobic residues in the LIR motif. Additionally, poor\naccessibility of the HP1 site interacting with aromatic residues in LIR motifs and initial ligands targeting for\nUDS binding site were found, which natural binding partner still remain understudied. Our data not only\nprove druggability of all LC3/GABARAPs, but also present a strategy for the development and evaluation\nof LDS and UDS ligands as starting points for future ATTEC development."

Residual plots: compounds 1-3 induce insignificant CSP values at molar ratio 1:2, compound 4 induces small CSP around LC3B residues forming HP2 (right plot and insert).\nTo assess target engagement of reported LC3 ligands, we carried out diverse biophysical binding assays,\nincluding fluorescence polarization (FP), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR). We compiled a comprehensive set of ligands reported in recent literature for this\ncomparative interaction study, including all ligands used for ATTEC design (AN1 (1), AN2 (2), 8F20 (3) and\n10O5 (4))6, covalent ligands that target the amine of K49 within the LDS (compounds 5-7)19 and four\nanalogs of ligands and fragments that have been published to disrupt the p62-LC3 interaction (compounds\n8-11).23 Additionally, we included Novobiocin (12) and Dihydronovobiocin (13), which we reported\npreviously as a ligands of LC3A and LC3B.18 We also included five LIR peptides spanning a wide affinity\nrange as positive controls. A full list of selected LC3 ligands has been compiled in supplementary SI figure\nS1 and representative ligands as well as the targeted ligand pockets are shown in Figure 1.\nInitially, we used temperature shift assays as a binding assay to evaluate small molecule interaction with\nthe LC3/GABARAP family. However, recorded temperature shifts were relatively small, including data\nmeasured for control peptides and we therefore deemed this assay as not suitable for the detection of\nLC3/GABARAP ligands (SI Figure S2 A). Next, we established an FP assay utilizing the p62-LIR peptide linked\nto a Cy5 fluorophore as a tracer molecule. Dose dependent titrations using all LC3/GABARAPs yielded\nassays with good signal to noise ratio and it resulted in measured KD values for the tracer between 3 and\n17 M across the human Atg8 family. Thus, this tracer allowed establishment of a displacement assay\nsuitable for screening and binding affinity determination of ligands in the low micromolar KD range (SI\nFigure S2 B). We evaluated the established set of ligands (1-13) against all LC3/GABARAPs with a\nrepresentative data set for LC3B shown in Figure 2 A and all data in SI Figures S2 C and D. Consistent with\ndata published previously, compound 12 (Novobiocin) bound to LC3A and LC3B with highest affinity KI\nvalues of 17.4 and 48.4 M, respectively (Figure 2B). Next, we focused on the ligands used widely for\nATTEC development (1-4). The dose dependent titrations against LC3/GABARAP family members are\nshown in Figure 2 C. Surprisingly, no detectable binding to the published targets LC3A and LC3B was\nobserved for all four ATTEC handles up to a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. However, weak interaction was\ndetected for 10O5 (4) binding to GABARAPL2 but not to its designated target LC3B. Due to the bright color\nof compounds 1 and 4 and the discrepancy to literature data, we validated these results further by direct\nbinding assays using 2D NMR titration experiments with 15N labelled LC3B protein (Figures 2D and 2E, left\nplots). This technique does not rely on the competition of a tracer peptide and enables the detection of\nallosteric LC3 binders. In agreement with our FP data, binding of Novobiocin (12) caused large chemical\nshifts perturbations (CSP) within the LIR binding pocket (Figures 2D and 2E). However, none of the\ncompounds 1-4 resulted in significant CSP even at higher compound concentrations in agreement with our\nFP binding data. Analysis of the small CSP HN resonances in the backbone, induced by 4 revealed that they\nare predominantly within HP2 with high estimated KD values of \u2265 200 \u00b5M for LC3B (SI Figure S3).\nWe therefore performed further optimized biophysical analyses, using these methods for LC3A interaction\nwith 1-4. To measure compound interaction via MST, we chose cysteine labelling in order to avoid lysine\nlabeling due to the presence of these residues in the binding sites. After successfully setting up the assay,\nwe were not able to reproduce the published binding data where lysine labeling was used in combination\nwith high protein concentrations of 500 nM (typical range: 5-50 nM) (SI Figure S4 A).6 Next, ITC was used\nas fluorescence-independent method for binding verification. Here, in agreement with earlier\nexperiments, Novobiocin (12) revealed binding with a KD (6.7 \u00b5M for LC3A), while titrations with AN2 (2)\nand 8F20 (3) did not yield significant binding heats. Additionally, we also investigated binding of AN1 (1)\nand 10O5 (4) as well as compound (8) by ITC but these ligands induced protein precipitation, rendering ITC\nKD determination impossible (SI Figure S4 B). To reproduce direct binding through FP as reported, we\nsynthesized 8F20 (17)- and 10O5 (16)-based dye-linked tracer molecules utilizing the same linker\nattachment point as for ATTEC development (SI Figure S4 C).22 Using the reported experimental setup for\nestablishing an FP assay, we successfully reproduced the tracer-LC3 interaction. However, we were unable\nto obtain displacement data using the parent compound, a standard control in FP assays. The only\nexperimental difference in our FP assay setup was the addition of 0.05 % Tween-20, which is routinely\nused24 to suppress unspecific binding of proteins. Under these conditions, we did not detect any binding,\nindicating unspecific tracer-LC3A interaction, whereas without Tween-20 some (unspecific) binding was\nobserved (SI Figure S4 D).\nEven though we did not observe any binding of compounds 1-4 to LC3 proteins, we were able to measure\nweak interaction of 10O5 (4) with GABARAP family members (Figure 2C). These data motivated us to\nfurther investigate interaction to GABARAPL2 by 2D NMR, which confirmed interaction in the HP2\nfingerprint area depicted in Figures 3A and 3B (full analysis is shown in SI Figure S5). Indeed, we confirmed\nweak GABARAPL2-10O5 (4) interaction by NMR titration experiments with estimated KD values in the 15-\n30 \u00b5M KD region. Due to the weak interaction with this Atg8 family member, it is not likely that the\nobserved degradation of mHTT was mediated by binding of 10O5 (4) to GABARAPL2.6 However, due to the\nuse of cell lysate and therefore a lack of cellular and membrane environment contribution factors, we\ncannot absolutely exclude proteome-wide interactions using this method.\nCovalent ligands 5-7 only showed weak interaction with LC3/GABARAPs in our FP assay and due to the\nirreversible nature of this interaction, binding of these ligands might be strongly time dependent. We\ntherefore evaluated the ligands 5-7 by ESI mass spectrometry for all LC3/GABARAPs. In agreement with\npublished data,19 we detected a mass shift corresponding to the compounds bound to LC3B (Figure 3C).\nThe mass shift corresponded to a single modification, supporting the literature data, suggesting that\ncompounds of this class selectively form a covalent bond to LC3 proteins to K49.19 However, treatment of\neither of the six proteins with compounds 5-7 revealed no selectivity within the human Atg8 family\nmembers, raising the possibility of further off-targets within the proteome, based on the reactivity of these\ncompounds (SI Figure S6). To investigate covalent interactions of compounds 1 and 4 with LC3/GABARAP\nas recently reported for 1 with the E3 ligase DCAF1125, we also studied the interaction of compound 1 and\n4 with GABARAPL2 using ESI mass spectrometry, where no covalent modification was detected in vitro\n(data not shown).\nSince compounds 1-4 were reported to trigger significant target degradation in cellular assays6, 22, 26, 27, we\nwere interested in possible mechanisms causing these intriguing effects. In order to identify possible\ntargets of these small molecules, we used an amine-linker adduct of the small molecules while using the\nsame attachment point for linkers as in recently published ATTECs (Figure 3 D). For proteome-wide\nscreening, we modified 10O5 (4) with a PEG-based linker and 8F20 (3) that both can be immobilized on\nsepharose beads to generate an affinity matrix for target pulldown, resulting in compounds 18 and 19. As\nexpected, dose-dependent competition assays showed that the KIF11 inhibitor 8F20/Ispinesib (3)\nselectively bound to KIF11 in HEK293T lysates (EC50 of 290 nM). No additional targets were detected for\n19 confirming excellent selectivity of this inhibitor for KIF11 (Figure 3 D). Interestingly, GABARAPL2 was\nnot significantly enriched in pull downs using 18 (up to 30 \u00b5M), suggesting that the interaction with this\nAtg8 homolog might be too weak to interact in cell lysates, confirming our hypothesis that the weak\ninteraction detected by NMR was not sufficient to support a role as ATTEC based degrader. As additional\ncellular on target validation, we used the 3 and 4-based tracer molecules 16 and 17 to measure cellular\nLC3A and LC3B target engagement using the NanoBRET technology, which again did not confirm binding\nof the 8F20 and 10O5 analogs to LC3A and LC3B in agreement with our assay data on recombinant proteins\n(SI Figures S7 A-C). To further study the cellular effects of the 4 ATTEC ligands (1-4), we monitored cellular\ngrowth in a live cell imaging system. Using RPE1 and U2OS cells, cell growth was monitored in live cells\nover a time course of 72 h after treatment with the respective compounds. Apart from 3, no compound\ncaused growth inhibition at concentrations < 10 \u00b5M, while compound 3 clearly suppressed cellular growth\n(SI Figures S7 D and E) without effecting cell viability at concentrations up to 30 \u00b5M (SI Figure S7 F). Since\nwe have identified KIF11 as the only proteome-wide high affinity target and given the established role of\nthis kinesin in cell division, KIF11 inhibition by 3 might trap cells in mitosis preventing cell division.28\nTherefore, we analyzed the images taken during the live cell growth assay and found an increased number\nof rounded cells, indicating cells in a mitotic defect, consistent with the G2/M arrest as a result of 8F20 (3)\ntreatment and in agreement with the literature (SI Figure S8).28\nLC3A.

C) FP assay results using compounds 21 (upper panel) and 20 (lower panel) for selectivity screening within the human Atg8-family proteins. Data were measured in technical triplicates with error bars expressing the SD (n=3). D) Interaction between LC3B and compound 21 investigated by NMR. Representative areas of LC3B [15N,1H] BEST-TROSY spectra around the K51 and V58 backbone HN resonances are shown in overlay with free LC3B (magenta), and in stepwise increase of 21 molar ratios up to 1:4. Arrows show directions of large CSP for the resonances which are in the intermediate exchange mode. E) CSP values, induced by compounds 21 at molar ratio 1:2, are plotted against LC3B residue numbers. The light green dashed line indicates the standard deviations (SD) over all residues, the orange dashed line indicates double SD values. The blue bars are for LC3B residues which undergo strong intermediate exchange mode (significant decrease of the resonances intensity upon titration with 21). Top right structure represents 3D mapping of CSP values on LC3B structure (pdb: 1UGM), indicating the HP2 as a most relevant interaction site. Residues with small (CSP < SD), intermediate (SD < CSP < 2xSD) or strong (2xSD < CSP) CSP values are marked in grey, light green and orange, respectively. LC3B residues which undergo strong intermediate exchange mode are marked blue. More details on this titration and titration of 21 to the GABARAP protein are depicted in SI Figure S9.\nIntrigued by the proposed mechanism of action of ATTECs and the possible advantages over PROTACs (e.g.\nno complex ubiquitin transfer mechanism or higher hurdle for cells ATTEC resistance), we carried out\nscreens for the identification of novel LC3/GABARAP binders, using two independent approaches. In the\nfirst approach, we initiated a virtual screening campaign by using a library of >7500 diverse in-house\ncompounds. All the docking poses of in silico hits were individually inspected and we collected 281\ncompounds for experimental validation using the developed FP assay and all LC3/GABARAPs.\nExperimentally confirmed hits were studied using similarity search, which ultimately led to two novel\nLC3/GABARAP ligands (Figures 4 A and B). Interestingly, both ligands harbored two carboxylic acid moieties\nand initial SAR insights using 26 ligands of this compound class (SI Tables 1-3) revealed the importance of\nboth carboxylic acids for binding. The first hit, LY223982 (20), has been developed targeting the leukotriene\nB4 receptor29 and showed selective binding to LC3 family members (Figures 4 B and C). Interestingly,\nTH15230 (21) displayed a KD of 2 \u00b5M for LC3A in ITC titrations and interacted with all LC3/GABARAPs in FP\nassays (Figure 4 B and C). Therefore, TH152 represents the most potent reversible pan-LC3/GABARAP\nligand reported so far.\nTo validate pan-Atg8 binding activity, we characterized the interaction of TH152 with 15N labelled LC3B\nand GABARAP protein by NMR titrations (as exemplary depicted in Figure 4 D-F for LC3B with full NMR\ndata analysis shown in SI Figure S9). The NMR results directly indicate that LC3B and GABARAP interact\nwith TH152 over LDS, confirming molecular modelling of these interactions. However, due to the presence\nof two carboxylic acid groups the identified ligands might be characterized by poor cell penetration and\nmight therefore require optimization for ATTEC development.\nAs a second hit finding approach, we conducted a large-scale fragment screening campaign using X-ray\ncrystallography by soaking a total of 1006 LC3B crystals with a diverse fragment library. This led to the\ncollection of over 800 high quality diffraction datasets, which identified a total of 21 diverse hits in the\nbinding cavities on LC3B after refinement of the structures (Figure 5A). This set significantly complements\nearlier fragment and hit finding campaigns using NMR and DEL (DNA encoded library) screening.20 Our\nscreen confirmed that HP2 is the most druggable binding site on LC3/GABARAP proteins surface,\naccommodating 10 from 21 identified fragments (Figure 5B). Fragments such as x0145 (HP1) and x0626\n(S2) offer the possibility for fragment linking. Previously reported data20 displays three fragments bound\nto HP2 with one fragment bound twice as depicted in Figure 5C. Interestingly, all of the previously\npublished fragments also harbor a carboxylic acid group. Comparison with hit rates of similar protein\ninteraction domains such as E3 ligases suggest that the HP2 pocket can accommodate a diversity of ligands,\nindicating a good druggability of this site. Based on our success with the very limited in silico study and the\nfragment screening campaign, we concluded that design and development of potent LC3/GABARAP\nligands for ATTECs should be feasible. Making this rich pool of hit matter available together with the\nestablished assay platform will allow robust validation of LC3/GABARAP ligands which may be developed\nto either selectively target one human Atg8 family member or to design pan-Atg8 ligands."

            "text": "In this study we validated published LC3/GABARAP ligands that could serve as starting points for the\ndevelopment of more potent ligands as well as ATTECs. To our surprise, none of the ligands used for the\ndevelopment of ATTECs interacted with LC3/GABARAP, suggesting that reported degraders did not\nfunction as LC3/GABARAP modulators causing degradation by the autophagy/lysosomal pathway. The\nhypothesis using LC3/GABARAP as receptors for degrader development is quite new. As a result, few tools\nare available that could be utilized demonstrating that observed degradation events indeed are associated\nwith autophagy. In the ubiquitin based degrader field, pathway association of PROTACs is usually\naccomplished using a) inactive E3 ligands such as the inactive stereoisomer of VHL or N-methylated\nthalidomide derivatives.31 These tools account also for possible effect caused by POI ligand that is often a\npharmacological highly active small molecule; b) proteasomal inhibitors that rescue proteasome\ndependent degradation events; c) inhibitors of E3 ligase activating enzymes such as neddylation inhibitors\nfor cullin dependent E3 ligases32 and finally a proteome wide analysis demonstrating degrader selectivity.\nHowever, for ATTECs, pathway activators such as mTOR inhibitors or small molecules such as Bafilomycin\ncould be used. We strongly believe that for new ligands common community guidelines for chemical probe\ndevelopments should be applied. These quality standard would comprise direct on-target engagement\nassays and for stronger ligands also for cell based assay systems, appropriate controls comprising inactive\ncontrol molecules, drug resistant mutants or knock out cell lines.33-36 Recently also first standards for\ncovalent inhibitors and degrader molecules have been defined.37\nOur druggability analysis, in silico and fragment screening revealed that LC3/GABARAP are druggable and\nfirst low M ligands that were confirmed in our assays have been reported. In our comprehensive\nfragment screening study, diverse ligands binding to the HP2 site emerged, but also HP1 and initial ligands\nfor the UIM site were identified. It is our hope that fragment growing and linking efforts will result in more\npotent LC3/GABARAP ligands that could be used for the development of efficient ATTECTs in the future."

E. coli Rosetta cells were cultured in Terrific Broth (TB) at 37 \u00b0C until an OD600 of 1.0 was reached. The culture was then cooled to 18 \u00b0C and allowed to reach an OD600 of 2.5. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the protein was allowed to express overnight. Cells were harvested (Beckman centrifuge, via centrifugation at 6000 g at 4\u00b0C) and lysed by sonication (SONICS vibra cell, 5 s on-, 10 s off cycle using a total of 30 minutes) in the presence of DNase I (Roche, Basel, CH) and cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, CH), and recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA-affinity chromatography in Purification buffer (30 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; pH 7.5 (HEPES), 500 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 30 mM Imidazole) and elution was carried out using Purification buffer including additional 300 mM Imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight into gel filtration buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP) while the expression tag was cleaved using 1 mg tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. The cleaved protein was passed through a HiLoad\u00ae 26/600 Superdex\u00ae 75 pg (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column and the resulting pure protein was stored in gel filtration buffer, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further experiments.\nProtein purification for X-ray crystallography: Human LC3B (1-120) was cloned into the pNIC28-Bsa4 vector using restriction sites Lic5 and Lic3 to add a TEV-cleavable N-terminal His-tag. The construct was then transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) competent cells and expressed in TB medium by overnight induction with 0.2 mM IPTG (OD600=2.5). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 @ 4\u00b0C, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10 mM Imidazole, and 5% Glycerol), and lysed by sonication on ice. The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 21000 g for 40 min. The fraction was with 4 ml Ni-NTA beads (pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer) for batch binding on ice for 1 hour. The beads were washed with buffer B (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 @ 4\u00b0C, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 30 mM Imidazole, and 5% Glycerol) and eluted with buffer C (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 @ 4\u00b0C, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 300 mM Imidazole, and 5% Glycerol). Protein in the eluted fraction was treated with TEV protease overnight while dialyzing against (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 @ 4\u00b0C, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% Glycerol) to cleave the His-tag. The dialyzed mixture was passed through 4 ml Ni-NTA beads, flowthrough was collected, concentrated, and injected into GE Superdex 75 16/600 Prep grade column pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 @ 4\u00b0C, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% Glycerol). The peak was collected and concentrated to 22.5 mg/ml.\nIsothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC): ITC experiments were performed using a NanoITC instrument (TA Instruments, New Castle, USA) at 25 \u00b0C in gel filtration buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4 pH = 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP). 25 \u00b5M inhibitor dissolved in gel filtration buffer was titrated into purified LC3/GABARAPs at a concentration of 500 \u00b5M in the reaction cell. For this protocol, the chamber was preequilibrated with the protein, and the test compounds were titrated in while continuously measuring the rate of exothermic heat evolution. The heat of binding was integrated, corrected, and fitted to an independent single-binding site model based on the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, from which thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H and T\u0394S), equilibrium association and dissociation constants (KA and KD, respectively), and stoichiometry (n) were calculated. Data were displayed using GraphPad Prism 9.3.\nDifferential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assay: Differences in the melting temperature (\u0394Tm) data were measured as described in Schwalm et al.39 Purified proteins were buffered in DSF buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) and were assayed in a 384-well plate (Thermo, #BC3384) with a final protein concentration of 20 \u03bcM in 10 \u03bcL final assay volume. Inhibitors were added in excess to a final concentration of 40 \u03bcM, using an ECHO 550 acoustic dispenser (Labcyte). As a fluorescent probe, SYPRO-Orange (Molecular Probes) was used at 5x final concentration. Filters for excitation and emission were set to 465 nm and 590 nm, respectively. The temperature was increased from 25 \u00b0C with 3 \u00b0C/min to a final temperature of 99 \u00b0C, while scanning, using the QuantStudio5 (Applied Biosystems). Data was analyzed using Boltzmann-equation in the Protein Thermal Shift software (Applied Biosystems). Samples were measured in technical triplicates.\nAffinity determination using spectral shift mode on Dianthus\nProtein Labeling Kit RED-maleimide 2nd Generation (cat# MO-L014; NanoTemper Technologies GmbH) was used for covalent labeling of LC3A cystine residues. Labelling was carried out following the manufacturer protocol, using a 3:1 ratio dye:protein. Labeled LC3A with degree of labeling of 0.7 (as determined by UV-VIS absorbance spectroscopy) was purified in 30 mM HEPES, 100mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.5. For spectral shift assays, a 16-point affinity measurement was performed in duplicates using the Dianthus (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Germany) instrument. Assays were performed in 10 mM Na2HPO4/KH2PO4, 0.05% Tween-20, 5 % DMSO, pH 7.4 with a maximum ligand concentration of of 500 \u00b5M. All compounds dissolved DMSO were first pre-diluted to 1 mM in assay buffer followed by a 16-fold 1:1 dilution series of each compound in a Dianthus 384 micro plate. Measurements were\nperformed in spectral shift mode with an LED excitation power of 100%. Data were analyzed using the DI.Screening Analysis Software (v.2.0.4) (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Germany) and quality criteria values including, \u0394 Ratio, Signal-to-Noise-Ratio, Saturation and Kd values were determined.\nFluorescence polarization assay (FP assay): For the complementation assay, the fluorescently labeled p62 LIR probe (SDNSSGGDDDWTHLSSK-Cy5) was diluted to (30 nM) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM TCEP and 0.05% TWEEN20) in a black 384-well flat bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One, #784076) and purified LC3/GABARAPs were titrated in a concentration range from 55 \u00b5M to 600 pM. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, fluorescence polarization was measured with polarized excitation wavelength of 590 nm and filtered emission wavelength of 675 nm, respectively, using a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech). Resulting data was plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.3 software and analyzed using a nonlinear fit to calculate the probe IC50. For competition assays, 30 nM probe was added to assay buffer containing 4 \u00b5M LC3/GABARAPs. Compounds were titrated from 20 \u00b5M to 20 nM using an ECHO 550 acoustic dispenser (Labcyte) incubated for 1 h at room temperature and subsequent read out as described above. Data was plotted in GraphPad Prism 9.3 and analyzed using a nonlinear fit (equation: Y=100/(1+10^(X-LogIC50)) for IC50 determination. KI calculation was performed using the NikolovskaColeska formula.40\nCovalent compound screening: For screening of covalent compounds, 46 compounds were tested against all LC3/GABARAPs, purified as described above. For LC-MS experiments, 50 \u00b5M of protein was used together with 100 \u00b5M of compound. The reaction was incubated for 90 min at room temperature and stopped by a 1:30 dilution in H2O with 0.1 % formic acid. Samples were measured, using an Agilent 6230 TOF LC/MS. Data was evaluated using the BioConfirm B.08.00 software.\nNanoBRET cellular target engagement assay: The assay was performed as described previously.41 In brief: Constructs contained the cDNA of full-length LC3A and LC3B cloned in frame with an N-terminal NanoLucfusion. Plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells using FuGENE HD (Promega, E2312) and proteins were allowed to express for 20 h. 10O5 and 8F20-based tracers were titrated to the protein as depicted in SI Figure 4 D. For competition experiments, 1 \u00b5M of the tracers was pipetted into white 384-well plates (Greiner 781 207) using an Echo 550 acoustic dispenser (Labcyte) containing LC3A/LC3B expressing transfected cells at a density of 2.5x105 cells/mL in Opti-MEM without phenol red (Life Technologies). The system was allowed to equilibrate for 2 hours at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 prior to BRET measurements. To measure BRET, NanoBRET NanoGlo Substrate + Extracellular NanoLuc Inhibitor (Promega, N2540) was added as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, and filtered luminescence was measured on a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech) equipped with a luminescence filter pair (450 nm BP filter (donor) and 610 nm LP filter (acceptor)). Competitive displacement data were then plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.3 software using a normalized 3-parameter curve fit with the following equation: Y=100/(1+10^(X-LogIC50)).\nPreparation of Affinity Matrix 10O5 and 8F20 (5). Compounds 18 and 19 (1 \u00b5M) were linked to DMSOwashed NHS-activated (~20 \u00b5M/mL beads) sepharose beads (1 mL) and triethylamine (20 \u00b5L) in DMSO (2 mL) on an end-over-end shaker overnight at RT in the dark. Aminoethanol (50 \u00b5L) was then added to inactivate the remaining NHS-activated carboxylic acid groups. After 16 hours the beads were washed with 10 mL DMSO and 30 mL EtOH to yield an affinity matrix of 10O5 and 8F20, respectively which were stored at 4 \u00b0C in EtOH. Successful immobilization was controlled by LC-MS and Kaiser-test.42\nPreparation of cell lysates for affinity pulldown assays. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (PAN Biotech). All media were supplemented in with 10% FBS (PAN Biotech) and cells were internally tested for Mycoplasma contamination. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.8% Igepal, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5%\nglycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT and supplemented with protease inhibitors (SigmaFast, Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (prepared in-house according to Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1, 2 and 3 from Sigma-Aldrich)). The protein amount of cell lysates was determined by Bradford assay and adjusted to a concentration of 5 mg/mL.42\nCompetition pulldown assays. For the selectivity profiling of free Compound 18 and 19, lysates from HEK293 cells were adjusted to 5 mg/mL protein concentration (0.4% Igepal). Then, 0.5 mL lysate was preincubated with 10 doses of the compounds (DMSO vehicle, 3 nM, 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, 1000 nM, 3000 nM, 10000 nM, 30000 nM) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in an end-over-end shaker, followed by incubation with 18 \u00b5L the Affinity Matrix 10O5 and 8F20 for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C in an end-over-end shaker. 42\nThe beads were washed (1x 1 mL of lysis buffer without inhibitors and only 0.4% Igepal, 2x 2mL of lysis buffer without inhibitors and only 0.2% Igepal) and captured proteins were denatured with 8 M urea buffer, alkylated with 55 mM chloroacetamide and digested with Trypsin according to standard procedures. Resulting peptides were desalted on a C18 filter plate (Sep-Pak\u00ae tC18 \u00b5Elution Plate, Waters), vacuum dried and stored at -20 \u00b0C until LC-MS/MS measurement.\nLC-MSMS measurement of (competition) pulldown assays. Peptides were analyzed via LC-MS/MS on a Dionex Ultimate3000 nano HPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer, operated via the Thermo Scientific Xcalibur software. Peptides were loaded on a trap column (100 \u03bcm x 2 cm, packed in house with Reprosil-Gold C18 ODS-3 5 \u03bcm resin, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch) and washed with 5 \u03bcL/min solvent A (0.1 % formic acid in HPLC grade water) for 10 min. Peptides were then separated on an analytical column (75 \u03bcm x 40 cm, packed in house with Reprosil-Gold C18 3 \u03bcm resin, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch) using a 50 min gradient ranging from 4-32 % solvent B (0.1 % formic acid, 5 % DMSO in acetonitirile) in solvent A (0.1 % formic acid, 5 % DMSO in HPLC grade water) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent mode, automatically switching between MS1 and MS2 spectra. MS1 spectra were acquired over a mass-to-charge (m/z) range of 360-1300 m/z at a resolution of 60,000 (at m/z 200) in the Orbitrap using a maximum injection time 50 ms and an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 4e5. Up to 12 peptide precursors were isolated (isolation width of 1.2 Th, maximum injection time of 75 ms, AGC value of 2e5), fragmented by HCD using 25 % 30% normalized collision energy (NCE) and analyzed in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 15,000. The dynamic exclusion duration of fragmented precursor ions was set to 30 s.42\nCompetition pulldown assay protein identification and quantification. Protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant (v 1.6.1.0)43 by searching the LC-MS/MS data against all canonical protein sequences as annotated in the Swissprot reference database (v03.12.15, 20193 entries, downloaded 22.03.2016) using the embedded search engine Andromeda. Carbamidomethylated cysteine was set as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation as variable modifications. Trypsin/P was specified as the proteolytic enzyme and up to two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Precursor tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance to 20 ppm. The minimum length of amino acids was set to seven and all data were adjusted to 1% PSM and 1% protein FDR. Labelfree quantification43 and match between runs was enabled (except for search of experiment corresponding to Fig S1d).42\nCompetition pulldown assay data analysis. Relative residual binding of proteins to the affinity matrix was calculated based on the protein intensity ratio relative to the DMSO control for every single inhibitor concentration. EC50 values were derived from a four-parameter log-logistic regression using an internal R script that utilizes the \u2018drc\u2019 package in R. Targets of the inhibitors were annotated manually. A protein was\nconsidered a target or interactor of a target if the resulting binding curve showed a sigmoidal curve shape with a dose dependent decrease of binding to the beads. Additionally, the number of unique peptides and MSMS counts per condition were taken into account.\nCell growth assay: Cell confluence (phase) from RPE1 or U2OS cell lines were monitored over time with the IncuCyte S3 (Sartiorius, Germany) in 384-well plates in 50 ul DMEM media, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) 1% penicillin/Streptomycin and incubated 24h before treatment. Experiment was performed as described in Cano-Franco et al.44 50\u03bcl of media containing either 2x final concentration of indicated compounds in or control compounds (final conc.: 0.1% DMSO, 250 nM Torin1, 200ng/mL Bafilomycin) were added and images were taken every two hours over 72 hours. Cell confluence is represented as % of covered area by cells. Each data point represents the averaged ratio or confluence obtained from three individual wells of the plate.\nVirtual screening: Our compound library of ~7500 compounds were virtually screened against LC3A and GABARAP (PDB: 6TBE, 4XC2) utilizing SeeSAR (BioSolveIT) and in-house software based upon AutoDockGPU.38 Resulting poses were sorted by estimated affinity (SeeSAR) and free energy (Autodock)38 results and filtered by molecular mass with a 750 Da cut-off. 271 compounds were subjected to in-vitro hit validation.\nSimilarity search: Validated hits were included in a Tanimoto-based similarity search via the SpaceLight chemical space exploration tool within the infiniSee suite (BioSolveIT). After removal of already validated hits, 104 additional similars were subjected to in vitro analysis.\nNMR experiments: Prior to measurements, LC3B, GABARAP and GABARAPL2 proteins were equilibrated with buffer containing 25mM HEPES pH=7.0, 100mM NaCl, 5% D2O and 0.15 mM DSS as internal reference. All NMR experiments were performed at a sample temperature of 25 \u00b0C on cryogenic probes equipped Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 600, 900, and 950 MHz. All NMR spectra were analyzed with the Sparky 3.114 software (University of California, San Francisco, USA). For NMR titration experiments, selected compounds were titrated to 75 \u03bcM 15N\u2010labeled LC3B, to 50 \u03bcM 13C,15Nlabelled GABARAP and to 25 \u03bcM 13C,15N-labelled GABARAPL2 proteins (in standard 5 mm tube, total sample volume 600 \u03bcL) to molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 (protein:compounds). To achieve reliable calculation of KD values, more titration points were performed for 10O5 and TH152 (up to molar ratio 1:8, proportional to the compounds or complexes solubility). 2D 1H\u201015N correlation spectra ([1H,15N] HSQC for novobiocin, [15N,1H] BEST-TROSY for other compounds) were recorded at each titration point. CSP values, \u0394\u03b4, were calculated for each individual backbone amide group using the formula \u0394\u03b4 = [((0.2\u0394\u03b4N)2 + (\u0394\u03b4HN)2)/2]1/2 according to the recent guidelines.45\nCrystallization: Initial crystallization hits were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion in SwissCi 3-drops\nplates using a series of commercially available coarse screens. Best hits were obtained in JCSG+ (Hampton\nResearch, USA). Several rounds of optimization were done to meet the conditions required for XChem data\ncollection (high resolution and reproducibility). The test crystals diffracted consistently around 2 \u00c5 and as\nhigh as 1.36 \u00c5. The selected crystallization condition for further work consisted of 36% PEG 8000 and 0.1\nM sodium acetate pH 4.7. For the fragment screening at XChem, the crystals were grown on-site using\nsitting drop vapor diffusion and the selected condition.\nFragment Screening and Structure Solution: A total of 808 fragments from the DSI poised library46 (stocks\ndissolved in DMSO) were transferred to the LC3B crystallization drops using an ECHO liquid handler (20%\nfinal DMSO concentration) and soaked for 3 hours before harvesting. Data were collected at the Diamond\nlight source beamline I04-1. A total of 827 datasets were collected (including apo crystals), most of which\ndiffracted to about 2 \u00c5. Data processing was performed using the automated XChem Explorer pipeline.47 Fragment hits were identified using the PanDDA algorithm48, followed by visual inspection. Refinement was performed using REFMAC.49\nReferences:\n(1) Bekes, M.; Langley, D. R.; Crews, C. M. PROTAC targeted protein degraders: the past is prologue. Nat Rev Drug Discov 2022, 21 (3), 181-200.
