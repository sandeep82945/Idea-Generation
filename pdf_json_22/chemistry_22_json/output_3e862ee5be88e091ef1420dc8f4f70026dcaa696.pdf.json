    "abstractText": "Ligustici Rhizoma et Radix (LReR) is the dried rhizomes and roots of Ligusticum sinese Oliv. (LS) or Ligusticum jeholense Nakai et Kitag. (LJ). However, in the market, LS and LJ are frequently confused with each other. Since the volatile oils are both the main active components and quality control indicators of LReR, a strategy combining gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chemical pattern recognition (CPR) was used to compare the volatile components of LJ and LS. Total ion chromatography (TIC) revealed that phthalides (i.e., neocnidilide) and phenylpropanoids (i.e., myristicin) could be thought of as the most critical components in the volatile oils of LJ and LS, respectively. In addition, the chemical components of the volatile oils in LJ and LS were successfully distinguished by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, two quality markers, including myristicin and neocnidilide, with a very high discriminative value for the classification of LJ and LS, were found by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The relative contents of myristicin and neocnidilide were 10.86 \u00b1 6.18% and 26.43 \u00b1 19.63% for LJ, and 47.43 \u00b1 12.66% and 2.87 \u00b1 2.31% for LS. In conclusion, this research has developed an effective approach to discriminating LJ and LS based on volatile oils by combining GC-MS with chemical pattern recognition analysis.",

Currently, in clinical TCM, more than one hundred Chinese patent medicines use LReR as a primary raw material [2]. Two species are used as LReR, including the dried rhizomes and roots of Ligusticum sinese Oliv. (LS) or Ligusticum jeholense Nakai et Kitag. (LJ) (Figure 1) [3]. Notably, compared to LJ, LS is generally considered to have a better quality [4], and both are frequently confused with each other in the herbal market. Moreover, modern pharmacological studies showed that LS\u2019s anti-inflammatory [2] and vasodilator effects [5] were more potent than LJ\u2019s. Hence, the differences in biological activities between the two during clinical applications should be noted. In fact, as both are derived from the roots and rhizomes of the Ligusticum Umbelliferae family, their outer morphological and internal microstructure features are incredibly similar and difficult to distinguish. Therefore, it is essential to identify the differences between those two species and to discover valuable markers for species identification.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5325. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27165325 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5325 2 of 10\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 10\nessential to identify the differences between those two species and to discover valuable\nmarkers for species identification.\n(A) (B)\nFigure 1.

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled\nwith chemometrics [10] and accD-ycf4 fragments [11] was proven to efficiently discrimi-\nnate between LJ and LS. However, the former cannot provide enough discriminative in-\nformation, such as chemical markers. The latter has a higher demand on DNA.

The result shows that neocnidilide and myristicin are the most dominant volatile\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5325 5 of 10\noil compounds in the LJ and LS, respectively. Neocnidilide possesses antimelanogenesis [19], anti-inflammatory [20], sedative [21], and xanthine oxidase inhibitory [22] activities. Myristicin has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, antioxidant, insecticide, and larvicide effects [23]. It is generally believed that LReR is mainly used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities [11,24]. Hence, the better quality of LS over LJ may be related to the high amounts of myristicin. Moreover, other phthalides, such as senkyunolide A, Z-butylidenephthalide, Z-ligustilide, and E-ligustilide, were also present in relatively high amounts, although their amounts differed between LJ and LS. Several studies show that phthalides exhibit diverse biological activities, such as cardiovascular protection [15,25], anti-inflammatory [15,26], analgesic [15], antioxidant, antitumor [26], neuroprotective [26,27], nephroprotective [28], and insecticidal [29] activities. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the difference in pharmacological activities [2,5] and quality [4] between LJ and LS has also been linked to those ingredients, and further research is required."

The GC-MS fingerprint for the two species of LReR shows some similarities and still some differences. Specifically, the main components and the major types of components in the volatile oils were different. LJ presented the highest average relative contents of neocnidilide (2.27\u201357.60%) and phthalides (34.62\u201370.28%), while LS had the highest average relative contents of myristicin (13.25\u201362.28%) and phenylpropanoids (13.70\u201363.70%). The other six components, including \u03b2-phellandrene, elemicin, 3-butylisobenzofuran-1(3H)one, Z-butylidenephthalide, senkyunolide A, and Z-ligustilide, can also be employed as potential distinguishing components by using the unpaired t-test. Moreover, the chemical pattern recognition analysis, such as HCA and PCA based on the GC-MS, revealed significant differences in the volatile composition between LJ and LS. The samples were grouped by species. Additionally, two markers, including myristicin and neocnidilide, with high discriminative values for the classification of LJ and LS were found in OPLS-DA. In summary, GC-MS fingerprints coupled with chemical pattern recognition analysis could be considered an effective approach for discriminating between LJ and LS.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27165325/s1, Table S1: Relative contents of characteristic components of Ligustici Rhizoma et Radix (LReR) from the two species.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.Z., H.A. and L.C.; methodology, S.L., H.A. and F.Z.; software, S.L. and Y.H.; validation, L.C., Y.H. and F.Z.; resources, S.L.; data curation, S.L.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, S.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.H.; visualization, S.L. and Y.H.; supervision, L.C.; project administration, H.A.; funding acquisition, S.L. and H.A.
