1. **Investigate the factor structure of DASS-21 in different cultural contexts:** The study focused on the Turkish population, and the results may not generalize to other cultures. Future research could examine the factor structure of DASS-21 in diverse cultural contexts to determine if the bifactor ESEM model holds across different populations.


2. **Explore the relationship between the general factor and specific factors of DASS-21:** The study found a strong general factor underlying the responses to DASS-21 items, but the specific factors were not as well-defined. Future research could investigate the relationship between the general factor and specific factors in more detail, examining how they contribute to overall mental health outcomes.


3. **Examine the measurement invariance of DASS-21 across different groups:** The study found that DASS-21 exhibited measurement invariance across genders, but it did not examine other demographic groups. Future research could investigate the measurement invariance of DASS-21 across different groups, such as age groups, ethnic groups, or clinical populations, to determine if the scale is equally valid for all individuals.


4. **Investigate the psychometric properties of DASS-21 in clinical populations:** The study was conducted with a non-clinical sample, and the results may not generalize to individuals with mental health disorders. Future research could examine the psychometric properties of DASS-21 in clinical populations to determine its validity and reliability in diagnosing and monitoring mental health conditions.


5. **Develop a shorter version of DASS-21 using bifactor ESEM:** The bifactor ESEM model suggests that a shorter version of DASS-21 could be developed that retains the strong general factor while eliminating items that do not contribute to the specific factors. Future research could develop and validate a shorter version of DASS-21 using bifactor ESEM, which could be more efficient and less burdensome for respondents.
