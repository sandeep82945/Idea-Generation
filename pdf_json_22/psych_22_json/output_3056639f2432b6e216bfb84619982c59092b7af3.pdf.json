Notably, the incidence of depression in women peaks in the years around menopause. Menopause is a long process that generally begins in a person\u2019s mid-40s and can continue for more than a decade. Depression caused by menopause can be more severe than that experienced by preand post-menopausal women (or by men of any age). Not coincidentally, suicide rates for women also are highest in the 45\u201364 age group. Remarkably, these sad and shocking statistics have not created serious concern in society at large. There are several reasons for the lack of attention. One is that menopausal depression is not universally recognized as a specific condition. There is no entry for it in any of the standard diagnostic manuals. Many women and their health-care workers continue to underestimate just how much menopausal depression impairs the quality of life. A popular myth is that this malady is mild and short-lived. This is not true. Moreover, inattention to menopausal depression reflects the systemic sexism that pervades biomedical research, which manifests as a lack of funding into research and services for women\u2019s health more generally. An analysis published in 2021 concluded that the US National Institutes of Health provides \u201ca disproportionate share of its resources to diseases that affect primarily men, at the expense of those that affect primarily women\u201d. Finally, we can point to the nature of life as experienced by many women in their mid-40s to early 50s \u2014 a stage that can also be marked by particular challenges in careers, intimate relationships, raising adolescent children and physical health. However, the statistics that show increased, severe depression in this age group strongly suggest that there is another significant \u2018tipping point\u2019 at work. There is one obvious biological change for women, as well as some trans men and non-binary people, in this age cohort: the changing levels of hormones in the brain. During menopause, oestrogen levels in particular fluctuate, destabilizing levels of serotonin and dopamine and thus affecting mood. Swings in other hormones, such as progesterone and testosterone, can have similar effects throughout menopause. Unfortunately, people with menopausal depression often respond inadequately to standard antidepressants. The good news is that hormone treatments such as oestrogen therapy can be an effective way to treat the condition \u2014 either as an adjunct to antidepressants or as a solo first-line treatment. Yet there remains considerable reluctance to use them; in many cases, a diagnosis of any form of depression still leads to an automatic prescription of an antidepressant. This practice is particularly inexplicable given that the guidelines from both the North American Menopause Society and the International Menopause Society highlight the safety of hormone therapy in women during and up to 10 years after menopause. There was a clear starting point for this automatic jump to antidepressants. In the early 2000s, a study by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause received sensational media attention. In 2002, the investigators suddenly stopped the combined (oestrogen and progestogen) HRT arm of the study because of an increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots. The preliminary data were widely reported, and many people and their physicians became alarmed about the safety issues of HRT. Since then, many of the study\u2019s results have been refuted. Furthermore, new menopause hormone medications are being developed, including synthetic selective oestrogen-receptor modulators, which should improve the safety of hormone therapy. But many health-care professionals do not recognize menopause as the underlying causal factor in women with mid-life depression, and so do not prescribe hormone therapy. As a result, too few women are benefiting from such scientific advances. Improving outcomes for people with menopause-related depression requires some significant changes. Most importantly, psychiatrists and other mental-health practitioners who treat women in their 40s and 50s need to enquire about menopause at the outset of treatment, and be willing to prescribe hormone therapies. In addition, clinicians and health-care students alike need to be better educated about this phase of women\u2019s lives. A big part of clinicians\u2019 reluctance to prescribe HRT for menopausal depression is the lack of knowledge about menopause \u2014 particularly how it affects the brain. To educate the public as well as health-care workers, we need the term menopausal depression to be recognized as a diagnostic entity. And more funding needs to be directed into women\u2019s mental-health care. The treatment of depression in middle-aged women, who are often key senior employees as well as the main carers for both young and older people, needs to be made a higher priority. Providing targeted mental-health care for women who experience menopausal depression ensures a brighter future for all of us.",
