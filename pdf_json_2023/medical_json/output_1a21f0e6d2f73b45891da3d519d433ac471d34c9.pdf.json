    "abstractText": "Male genital schistosomiasis (MGS) is hypothesized to increase seminal shedding of HIV\u20101. This prospective pilot study assessed seminal HIV\u20101 RNA shedding in men on long\u2010term ART with and without a diagnosis of MGS. Study visits occurred at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. MGS was diagnosed by egg positivity on semen microscopy or PCR of seminal sediment. After optimization of the HIV\u2010 RNA assay, we examined 72 paired plasma and semen samples collected from 31 men (15 with and 16 without MGS) over 12 months. HIV\u20101 RNA was detected in 7/72 (9.7%) seminal samples and 25/72 (34.7%) plasma samples. When comparing sample pairs, 5/72 (6.9%) showed HIV\u20101 RNA detection only in the seminal sample. Overall, 3/31 (9.7%) participants, all with MGS, had detectable HIV\u20101 RNA in semen while plasma HIV\u20101 RNA was undetectable (< 22 copies/mL), with seminal levels ranging up to 400 copies/mL. Two participants showing HIV\u20101 RNA in seminal fluid from the MGS\u2010negative group also had concomitant HIV\u20101 RNA detection in plasma. The findings suggest that MGS can be associated with low\u2010level HIV\u20101 RNA shedding despite virologically suppressive ART. Further studies are warranted to confirm these observations and assess its implications. OPEN",

Here, schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by water-borne blood flukes2, afflicts some 180 million people whereas an estimated 6 million are living with HIV-13,4. Although levels of co-infection of schistosomiasis and HIV are not accurately reported, an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition may be assumed in those with underlying schistosomiasis5.\nIndeed, HIV-1 prevalence is often raised in fishing communities where schistosomiasis is prevalent6,7. In endemic areas, there is a higher prevalence of HIV-1 infection in women with female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), and schistosomiasis has been shown to increase the risk of HIV-1 acquisition by a factor of three8\u201310. This association is due to genital mucosal breach, neovascularisation, and increased density of HIV receptive CD4 + cells in women with FGS. Genital schistosomiasis has also been associated with increased seminal levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in men with seminal egg excretion11. However, there are limited data on the relationship between male genital schistosomiasis (MGS) and HIV-1 infection among men. A study in Zimbabwe examined four antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na\u00efve men living with HIV-1 and demonstrated a decline in seminal HIV-1 RNA levels (by a median of 0.6 log10 copies/mL) 10\u00a0weeks after treatment with praziquantel (PZQ), the only available medicine against schistosomiasis12.\nART is highly effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication in both plasma and genital tract, reducing the risk of HIV-1 transmission through both heterosexual and homosexual intercourse. Prospective studies of HIVdiscordant couples where the partner living with HIV was established on virologically suppressive ART (defined as plasma HIV-1 < 200 copies/mL) showed no HIV-1 transmission despite condomless sex13\u201316. Nonetheless, detection of HIV-1 RNA in seminal fluid has been previously reported in men receiving virologically suppressive ART 17,18. One explanation is that HIV-1 RNA suppression occurs more slowly in seminal fluid than in plasma and thus seminal shedding may be relatively common in the early phase after ART initiation19. Furthermore, it has been hypothesised that like sexually transmitted and other genital infections, MGS may promote genital shedding of HIV-1 RNA despite effective ART due to chronic egg-induced inflammation of the genital tract20.\nIn Malawi, within a population of 19.9 million, 990 000 (5%) were estimated to be living with HIV-1 in 202121. Whilst epidemiological data is generally heterogenous across sub-Saharan Africa, in 2015, one study in Malawi\u00a0reported schistosomiasis prevalence of 47.4% in\u00a0communities around its\u00a0lakeshores and other\u00a0environmental water bodies22. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the extent of any putative relationship between MGS and seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding among men living with HIV-1 and receiving long-term ART in Malawi."

Study participants were heterosexual men \u2265 18 years of age living with HIV-1 who attended HIV outpatient services along Lake Malawi between October 2017 and December 2018 (Fig.\u00a01). Mid-morning urine, semen and whole blood in EDTA were to be collected at each planned study visit (0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months). The sampling methodology was reported previously23 and is described in Supplementary Information. Seminal samples were collected in a clear plastic bag following two days of abstinence from sexual activity. In total, 74 participants enrolled, of which 23 did not submit blood or urine samples for schistosomiasis testing. Of the remaining 51, 33 tested negative for schistosomiasis, of whom 16 provided blood, urine, and semen. This cohort of 16 was deemed the \u2018MGS-negative group\u2019. Of the 18 participants that tested positive for schistosomiasis, 15 provided blood, urine, and semen. This cohort of 15 was deemed the \u2018MGS-positive group\u2019. The disposition of the whole study population is shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01. Given the high prevalence of schistosomiasis in the region22, participants received PZQ at all study visits regardless of a diagnosis of MGS.\nLaboratory procedures. Samples were processed within 3\u00a0hours of collection. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 xg for 5 minutes to separate plasma for storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Seminal samples were allowed to liquefy at ambient temperature and examined under microscopy for the presence of Schistosoma eggs, followed by centrifugation at 3000 xg for 5 minutes to separate supernatant seminal fluid and sediments. Seminal fluid was stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Seminal sediment samples were re-dissolved in saline and 2\u20133 drops were placed on a glass slide for microscopy to detect Schistosoma eggs. Leftover seminal sediments were preserved in ethanol and shipped to the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Ziekenhuis (ETZ) Hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands, for Schisto\u2011 soma DNA detection by in-house real-time PCR as previously described23. The parasitological procedure was previously detailed23 and is described in Supplementary Information. Urine samples were tested for Schistosoma circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) using the point-of care parasite CCA test (POC-CCA) (Rapid Medical Diagnostics, South Africa), followed by urine filtration and microscopy for Schistosoma eggs. Cryopreserved seminal fluid and plasma samples were shipped on dry ice to the United\u00a0Kingdom for HIV-1 RNA testing.\nSchistosomiasis diagnosis and definition of MGS. Schistosoma positivity was defined by visual evidence of eggs by microscopy of filtrated urine, semen, or seminal sediment; PCR detection in seminal sediment, urine or stool; or positive POC-CCA test in urine. Male genital schistosomiasis (MGS) was defined as Schistosoma positivity in semen.\nHIV\u20111 RNA testing. HIV-1 RNA was detected in plasma and seminal fluid using the Cepheid Xpert assays25. The assays perform qualitative (HIV-1 Qual assay) and quantitative (HIV-1 Viral Load assay) detection of HIV-1 RNA in plasma26. With 1 mL input, the HIV-1 Qual assay reports qualitative HIV-1 RNA detection with a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 278 copies/mL; the manufacturer describes 25% detection rate at 60 copies/ mL27,28. With 1mL input, the HIV-1 Viral Load assay has a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 40 copies/ mL and a LLOD of 22 copies/mL26. To detect HIV-1 RNA in seminal fluid, the assays were first validated using seminal fluid samples collected from two HIV negative donors and spiked with known amounts of HIV-1 RNA,\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:14154 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40756-8\nas detailed in Supplementary Information. The assay LLOD for seminal fluid ranged from 55 to 220 copies/mL according to the dilution applied. HIV-1 RNA results were reported as either a quantified level or as qualitative targeted detected.\nStatistical analyses. Baseline characteristics were described as categorical and continuous variables and compared using Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon test (continuous variables) or Fisher\u2019s exact test (categorical variables). Analyses was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 27) and GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0.\nEthical considerations. Ethical approval was provided by the National Health Sciences Research Committee (NHSRC) of Malawi (Approval No.: 1805) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Approval No.: 17-018).

Details of parasitology testing are summarised in Table\u00a02. At baseline, 8 participants tested MGS positive by semen microscopy, 4 tested positive only by real-time PCR of seminal sediment, and 20 tested negative by all tests. Among the 20 participants with a negative baseline test, 3 had a positive test during followup (1 by real-time PCR only; 1 by PCR and POC-CCA test and 1 by urine filtration, PCR and POC-CCA test) yielding a total of 15 participants who were classed as MGS positive (A01\u2013A15), whereas 16 were classed as MGS negative (A16\u2013A31). There were no significant differences when comparing the baseline characteristics of the two groups (Table\u00a01). During the study period, 42 paired samples were provided by the MGS positive participants while 30 samples were provided by MGS negative participants.\nHIV\u20111 RNA testing. Plasma. At baseline, 5/30 (16.7%) participants showed quantifiable plasma HIV-1 RNA ( \u2265 40 copies/mL) including 3/14 (21.4%) in the MGS-positive group (A09, A11, A15) and 2/16 (12.5%) in the MGS-negative group (A21, A30) (Table\u00a03). HIV-1 RNA levels ranged from 41 to 56,000 copies/mL During follow-up, 1/5 participants (A09) achieved suppression < 40 copies/mL at 6 months, while continuing to show detectable HIV-1 RNA below the assay LLOQ of 40 copies/mL (estimated 22\u201339 copies/mL); 1/5 (A11) showed persistent viraemia between 816 and 277 copies/mL at 6 and 12 months; and 3/5 had no follow-up samples collected. A further 4 participants showed detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA below the assay LLOQ of 40 copies/mL (estimated 22\u201339 copies/mL) at baseline, including 2/14 (14.3%) in the MGS-positive group (A07, A13) and 2/16 (12.5%) in the MGS-negative group (A16, A23). Among 21 participants with undetectable HIV-1 RNA at baseline, two in the MGS-negative group showed plasma viral load rebound > 40 copies/mL at 1 month (A17; 64 copies/mL) and 3 months (A20; 107,000 copies/mL) respectively, followed by resuppression < 40 copies/mL) but detectable HIV-1 RNA at 12 months (Table\u00a03).\nSeminal fluid. Among participants with baseline samples, 3/30 (10.0%) showed detectable HIV-1 RNA in seminal fluid (Table\u00a03). In the MGS-positive group, 2/14 (14.3%) participants (A03, A04) showed detectable HIV-1 RNA (estimated levels between 55 and 400 copies/mL) in seminal fluid, while plasma HIV-1 RNA was undetectable (< 22 copies/mL). One of the two had no follow-up samples. The other showed undetectable HIV-1 RNA in both plasma and seminal fluid at months 1, 3 and 12. In the MGS-negative group, 1/16 (6.3%) participants (A21) showed seminal HIV-1 RNA levels of 4840 copies/mL, but in this case plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were also high at 26,900 copies/mL. A total of 20 participants had at least one follow-up sample (Table\u00a03). Among these, 2 participants (A05, A20) showed newly detectable HIV-1 RNA in seminal fluid. One participant (A05) in the MGS-positive group had persistent HIV-1 RNA in seminal fluid at months 1, 3 and 6, with levels ranging up to 123 copies/mL, while plasma HIV-1 RNA remained persistently undetectable (< 22 copies/mL). The second participant (A20) was in the MGS-negative group. At 3 months, HIV-1 RNA levels were 528 copies/mL in seminal fluid while plasma HIV-1 RNA had rebounded from undetectable to 107,000 copies/mL. Overall, 7/72 (9.7%)\nTable 1.

            "text": "Across sub-Saharan Africa, evidence of the impact of MGS on HIV-1 shedding in semen is limited despite the significant epidemiological overlap between HIV-1 infection and endemic schistosomiasis29. We sought to assess prospectively over 12 months, the rates and kinetics of seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding in heterosexual men living with HIV-1 and established on first-line NNRTI-based ART in Malawi, stratifying the data according to a diagnosis of MGS. In our pilot study, we observed low-level HIV-1 RNA shedding in seminal fluid of men with MGS despite fully suppressed plasma HIV-1 RNA, whereas in those without an MGS diagnosis seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding was always concomitant with high-level viremia. Our numbers are limited. In total, we observed HIV-1 RNA detection in 5 seminal samples from 3 of 15 participants in the MGS group. Larger studies are needed to confirm these interesting observations.\nUrogenital schistosomiasis is thought to be similar to STIs such as HSV-2 in facilitating HIV-1 transmission; this is due to presence of mucosal lesions and local recruitment of HIV-susceptible cells through egg-induced inflammation3. Collectively, this is expected to increase the risk of HIV acquisition and propagation by increasing viral replication. Whilst data reporting the impact of urogenital schistosomiasis on HIV-1 shedding in semen are scarce, one study showed a decrease in seminal HIV-1 RNA levels following treatment with PZQ during a follow-up period of 10 weeks12.\nVirologically effective ART reduces the risk of transmitting HIV sexually via both heterosexual and homosexual routes14,15,30. One question remains as to the relevance of the reported delay in HIV-1 RNA suppression\nTable 2.

In our study, participants entered the analysis while already established on ART with a median ART duration of 7.5 years (IQR 1.9\u201313.0). In this population established on long-term ART, 5/31 (16.1%) participants had at least one episode of seminal HIV-1 RNA detection over 12\u00a0months of follow-up. Two of the participants were negative for Schistosoma and had concomitant high HIV-1 RNA detection in plasma. Among participants positive for Schistosoma, 3 were established on ART with TDF/3TC/EFV for 8\u201312\u00a0years and had fully suppressed, undetectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma, yet they showed detectable HIV-1 RNA in a total of 5 seminal samples. It is important to highlight that the levels of seminal HIV-1 RNA in these 5 samples were low and never exceeded an estimated 400 copies/mL, despite 4 of the 5 samples coinciding with a positive Schistosoma test. The implications in terms of risk of HIV-1 transmission are uncertain.\nTable 3. HIV-1 RNA testing results (in copies/mL) in plasma and seminal fluid by MGS status.a a With plasma, HIV-1 RNA results were either quantifiable ( \u2265 40 copies/ml), detectable qualitatively (D, estimated level 22\u201339 copies/ml), or undetectable (UD, < 22 copies/ml); with seminal fluid, the lower limit of detection varied according to the sample dilution and is specified by sample as follows (the estimated HIV-1 RNA levels are given in parenthesis): UD1a = HIV-1 RNA undetectable (< 110 copies/ml); UD2b = HIV-1 RNA undetectable (< 55 copies/ml); UD3c = HIV-1 RNA undetectable (< 220 copies/ml); D = HIV-1 RNA detected (viral load in copies/ ml).

The study population was small and participants did not provide samples at all scheduled time points. We had small seminal sample volumes which constrained our ability to use a high input volume in the HIV-1 RNA tests. Due to lack of samples, we did not attempt to perform HIV drug resistance testing when HIV-1 RNA was detected and we did not investigate the concomitant occurrence of clinically unrecognised STIs."

            "text": "Taken together, our study found that 3/15 (20%) men with HIV-1 and MGS who were established on NNRTIbased first-line ART for at least 8 years had detectable HIV-1 RNA in 5 seminal samples while plasma HIV-1 RNA was fully suppressed. Seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding coincided with Schistosoma detection in 4 of the 5 samples. However, HIV-1 RNA was detected in seminal fluid at low levels, raising doubts about significance in terms of risk of transmission, particularly if shedding is sporadic or intermittent. We recommend that future studies should aim to (1) evaluate the definitive role of MGS in enhancing HIV-1 RNA shedding in semen during ART; (2) investigate the infectiousness and drug resistance profile of seminal HIV-1 RNA; and (3) determine how the introduction of dolutegravir-based ART across Africa may impact on the findings especially as reports have started to observe treatment failure across populations31,32."
