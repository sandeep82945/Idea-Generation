    "abstractText": "The lysozyme in the chicken egg white consists of various bioactive amino acids. However, these compounds are inactive when they are in the sequence of parent proteins. They become active only when isolated from these proteins. The aim of this study was to modify lysozyme with proteolytic enzymes under specific conditions of the reaction environment so as to obtain active biopeptides. The physicochemical properties of the resulting preparations were also assessed. Our study showed that the modification of lysozyme with hydrolytic enzymes (pepsin and trypsin) under strictly specified conditions resulted in obtaining biopeptide preparations with new and valuable properties, as compared with native lysozyme. After the enzymatic modification of lysozyme, two structural fractions were distinguished in the composition of the resulting preparations\u2014the monomeric fraction and the peptide fraction. The modified lysozyme exhibited high surface hydrophobicity and high total antibacterial activity despite the decrease in the hydrolytic activity. Modification of lysozyme with hydrolytic enzymes, especially pepsin, resulted in preparations with very good antioxidative properties.",

            "text": "Lysozyme obtained from the protein fraction of a chicken egg consists of 129 amino acids. This protein with antimicrobial properties has a molecular mass of 14.3 kDa [1,2]. Lysozyme hydrolyses the glycosidic bonds between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid in the polysaccharides, forming the cell walls of bacteria. It also hydrolyses the glycosidic bonds in chitin [3]. Due to the antibacterial properties of lysozyme, this enzyme has high application potential in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and veterinary industries. It is an adjuvant applied in the treatment of various bacterial infections, diseases of the skin, eyes, and mouth, as well as in cancer [4\u20136]. However, due to the specific structure of this native enzyme, its antibacterial effect is limited only to Gram-positive bacteria [1,7]. It is Gram-negative bacteria that constitute a significant proportion of both pathogenic microorganisms and the microbes causing food spoilage during storage. Lysozyme can also be effective against these bacteria, but it must be adapted to a form that will be active against them. Research has proved that this effect can be obtained by modifying the enzyme to a dimeric form and/or to a form in which the hydrophobic surface originally closed inside the enzyme molecule will be brought to its surface, and its active centre will be opened [8]. As a result of such modifications, new products are formed\u2014these are bioactive lysozyme derivatives with completely new physicochemical and antibacterial properties and, thus, with a new application potential. Among the known types of lysozyme modifications, the best-known and most frequently used are those that cause oligomerisation and increase the hydrophobic surface [8,9]. Researchers increasingly often make attempts to break down the lysozyme monomer into smaller molecules. [10]. Bioactive peptides can be isolated using enzymatic hydrolysis combined with thermochemical methods [11]. Pepsin is one of the most common enzymes used for enzymatic\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6260. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176260 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nhydrolysis of parent proteins. The pH of the enzymatic hydrolysis environment plays an important role in this process [12\u201314]. Apart from pepsin, another enzyme used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of lysozyme is trypsin, usually in hydrolytic systems together with pepsin and papain [15,16]. The aim of this study was to modify lysozyme with proteolytic enzymes under specific conditions of the reaction environment so as to obtain active biopeptides. The physicochemical properties of the resulting preparations were also assessed."

The modification temperature of 70 \u25e6C resulted in the highest degree of hydrolysis of the lysozyme monomer in the samples, whereas the lowest degree was observed at 40 \u25e6C.

Similarly to pepsin, the amount of peptides formed in the modification conducted with trypsin depended on the process temperature rather than the concentration of this enzyme in the modified samples.

The results of the statistical analysis showed that the efficiency of hydrolysis was determined using the temperature of the process at 70 \u25e6C preparations with the highest antioxidative activity nd the greatest increase in surface hydrophobicity were obtained. At the same time, they were characterised by high hydrolytic activity. The hydrolysis with pepsin at 70 \u25e6C increase the surface hydrophobicity by 34\u201345%, whereas trypsin increased it by only 3\u201311%, as compared with the native enzyme. In contrast to pepsin, trypsin had a much weaker effect on the structural changes of the lysozyme molecule responsible for moving its hydrophobic interior to the surface of the enzyme. On the other hand, the use of trypsin resulted in higher antioxidative activity than the use of pepsin (Table 1). At the same time, the research showed that regardless of the enzyme used in the modification process, the resulting preparations always had stronger antioxidative properties than the native form of the enzyme. The modification processes were not indifferent to the hydrolytic activity of lysozyme. Trypsin had a weaker effect on the lysozyme molecule and resulted in the smallest changes. Regardless of the concentration of trypsin and the temperature of the modification process, despite the slight decrease in the hydrolytic activity, it remained high and was only slightly lower than the activity of the native enzyme (Table 1). On the other hand, similarly to hydrophobic changes, pepsin significantly reduced the hydrolytic activity. The higher the pepsin concentration and the higher the modification temperature, the lower the hydrolytic activity (Table 1). It is noteworthy that this phenomenon was always observed during various lysozyme modifications, especially thermal modifications. The antibacterial properties of the enzyme were usually not reduced. On the contrary, the total antibacterial activity of lysozyme was very often higher than that of the native enzyme, and it was also effective against Gram-negative bacteria [8]. The results of the first stage of the research on the enzymatic modification of lysozyme, as well as the data provided in reference publications, indicated that the acidity of the environment and the duration of hydrolysis significantly affected the enzyme modifica-\ntion [8,17,18]. The research was continued (variant 2) to determine the influence of these factors on the enzymatic modification of lysozyme. In this variant, native lysozyme was modified with pepsin at a concentration of 0.01% and temperature of 70 \u25e6C, i.e., the optimal conditions resulting from variant 1 of the study. The modification was conducted under the changing conditions of environment acidity (pH 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0) and process duration (1, 2, and 3 h). The lysozyme modification process was conducted according to the procedure described in Section 4.1. Like in the first variant of the study, as a result of the modification of lysozyme, its modified forms were obtained. These were preparations containing both a monomer and a peptide fraction. The preparations were analysed. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 2.

Number of test repetitions: n = 5.\nThe analysis of the results showed that the effects of lysozyme modification significantly depended on the conditions of the process. The longer duration of the modification process had a negative influence on its effectiveness (Table 2). As the duration of the modification process increased, the percentage content of peptides decreased regardless of the pH of the environment. One-hour modification of the enzyme in an acidic environment (pH = 2.0) resulted in the highest percentage of peptides, i.e., 67.9%. The lowest percentage\ncantly depended on the conditions of the process. The longer duration of the modification\nprocess had a negative influence on its effectiveness (Table 2). As the duration of the\nmodification process increased, the percentage content of peptides decreased regardless of the pH of the environment. One-hour modification of the enzyme in an acidic environment (pH = 2.0) resulted in the highest percentage of peptides, i.e., 67.9%. The lowest percentage of the peptide fraction, i.e., 21.1%, was obtained after 3 h modification in an\nenvironment with pH = 4.0. As the duration of the modification process increased, the average decrease in the content of the peptide fraction in the samples modified at pH = 2.0 and 3.0 amounted to 17.82% and 17.13%, respectively, whereas in the samples modified at pH= 4.0 it was 51.97%. The study also showed that the acidity of the environment and the duration of the modification process significantly influenced changes in the hydrophobicity of the enzyme. The highest average increase in surface hydrophobicity, i.e., 34.0%, was observed in the sample modified for one hour in an environment with pH = 2.0, whereas the lowest increase, i.e., 10.6%, was found in the sample modified for three hours in an environment with pH = 4.0. As can be seen, the amount of released peptides and their content in a given preparation were of key significance for the increase in surface hydrophobicity. The higher the percentage of peptides there were, the higher the surface hydrophobicity was. The release of the peptides exposed the hydrophobic interior of the lysozyme to its surface. The new modification conditions used in the second variant of the experiment also significantly influenced the values of the other physicochemical parameters, i.e., the hydrolytic and antioxidative activity of the modified lysozyme. The highest antioxidative activity, i.e., 113.4 TE/mgL on average, was observed in the preparations obtained after three-hour modification in an environment with pH = 4.0. The lowest antioxidative activity was measured in the preparations modified for one hour at pH = 4.0. The opposite dependence was observed for the hydrolytic activity. Its highest value was observed under the least drastic conditions of the modification process, i.e., one-hour duration and pH = 4.0 (Table 2). It is necessary to make an extensive microbial analysis in order to fully assess the antibacterial activity of enzyme-modified lysozyme. The results of this analysis will be provided in a separate study. Preliminary tests were conducted in this study to assess the effect of the preparations obtained after the modification of lysosome with pepsin and trypsin on selected types of bacteria. The tests showed that the effect of the modified lysozyme on bacteria depended on the modification method. The samples obtained during the second modification variant (Variant 2) were characterised by better antibacterial activity. Table 3 shows the results of an evaluation of the antibacterial effect of selected pepsin-modified lysozyme preparations containing the highest proportion of the peptide fraction. The incubation of the modified lysozyme with the bacterial strains used in the tests prolonged the lag phase of the bacteria. The lysosome preparations had a better antibacterial effect against the Gram-positive Listeria innocua bacteria. Neither the trypsinmodified lysozyme nor the modified lysozyme preparations obtained in the first variant of the experiment (variant 1) inhibited bacterial growth effectively. However, the results of the preliminary test of the enzymatically modified lysozyme indicated that the spectrum of the antibacterial activity of the enzyme could be extended. An in-depth assessment will be possible only after conducting a full study on the antibacterial activity of the enzyme, which is currently being conducted independently."

            "text": "Lysozyme contained in the chicken egg white is the subject of numerous scientific studies because it has various beneficial properties. Native lysozyme occurs in the form of a monomer. If there are favourable environmental conditions, it becomes dimerised or even oligomerised [8]. The main aim of our study was to achieve the opposite effect, i.e., to obtain shorter amino acid chains in the form of released bioactive lysozyme peptides and to assess the physicochemical properties of the resulting preparations. Appropriate analytical techniques were applied to investigate the range of changes occurring in lysozyme as a result of its thermo-enzymatic modification conducted with pepsin and trypsin in various environmental conditions. Earlier studies showed that bioactive peptides were released as a result of the enzymatic modification of lysozyme with pepsin [14,19]. Our research showed that it is also possible to obtain such preparations by the modification of lysozyme with proteolytic enzymes in a strongly acidic environment. The best hydrolytic effect was observed after the addition of pepsin, whereas trypsin hydrolysed lysozyme to a lesser extent. This effect could be expected, as the data provided in some publications suggested that trypsin worked most effectively in combination with other enzymes, e.g., pepsin or papain. Such hydrolytic systems usually resulted in significant or even complete hydrolysis of lysozyme and the release of its bioactive peptides [15,16]. The analysis of changes in the hydrophobicity of enzymatically modified lysozyme clearly showed that the hydrolysis of the enzyme caused an increase in its surface hydrophobicity, as was the case with other lysozyme modifications [2,8,20]. This means that during such modifications, the internal hydrophobic part of the enzyme is also exposed to its surface [8]. According to Ibrahim\u2019s theory [21,22], conformational changes of the enzyme take place and expose the hydrophobic sites of various amino acids, thereby increasing the hydrophobic surface of the lysozyme. Regardless of the mechanism, each increase in the surface hydrophobicity and a simultaneous decrease in the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme [8] always caused an increase in the total antibacterial activity of lysozyme. A similar effect was expected and observed in our study, as evidenced by the microbial tests. Apart from the destructive effect on Gram-positive bacteria, the preparations obtained after the lysozyme modification also exhibited an antibacterial effect against Gram-negative bacteria. The preparations obtained as a result of the enzymatic modification of lysozyme with pepsin and trypsin were also characterised by a significantly higher antioxidative activity than that of the native enzyme. This effect was also observed by other researchers, who found that biopetides obtained from lysozyme were always characterised by increased antioxidative activity [13,15,23,24]. In our study, the lysozyme modification conditions for the highest antioxidative activity were developed. At the same time, the increase in the antioxidative activity was closely correlated with the applied temperature and the duration of the modification process."

Two types of 3% aqueous lysozyme solutions (pH = 2) containing 0.01% and 0.02% of pepsin and 0.02% and 0.03% of trypsin were prepared for modification. This solution was prepared for modification by adjusting its pH to 2.0 with hydrochloric acid (with the appropriate concentration: 1.0 or 0.5 M). A lysozyme solution without enzymes was used as a reference sample.
