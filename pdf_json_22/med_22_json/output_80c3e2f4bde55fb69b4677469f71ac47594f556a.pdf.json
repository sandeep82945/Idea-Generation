    "abstractText": "Background Dynamic, relational developmental systems-based models of development emphasize that developmentally-nurturant youth-adult relationships elicit in youth perceptions of being known and loved. Although such perceptions are foundations of positive youth development (PYD), such measures do not exist. Objective We sought to create a theoretically-predicated measure of youth perceptions of being known and loved by capitalizing on data sets in two countries (Rwanda and El Salvador) wherein a multi-national study of PYD was being conducted by Compassion International (CI). Method With Rwanda data (n = 1,204, Mage = 11.84, 50% CI-supported), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses enabled refining the measure for robustness and parsimony. Measures of intentional self-regulation, hopeful future expectations, transcendence, and contribution were used for validation of the known and loved measure within the nomological net of constructs proposed in the Lerner and Lerner PYD model. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the use of the model within the El Salvador data set (n = 1,205, Mage = 13.03, 51% CI-supported). Results Robust psychometric properties were established in both national settings. Measurement invariance was found across age, gender, urban\u2013rural location, CI-enrollment status, and nations, and involved both mean differences and correlations among latent factors. Conclusions The results provide evidence for a theory-predicated measure of youth perceptions of being known and loved and that scores for this construct covary within a nomological net specified in the Lerner and Lerner model of PYD. These findings serve international development organizations seeking theory-predicated measures for use in evaluating PYD programs in lowand middle-income countries.",

            "text": "Dynamic, relational developmental systems (RDS)-based models are at the forefront of contemporary theory in developmental science (e.g., Mascolo & Bidell, 2020; Molenaar et\u00a0al., 2014; Nucci, 2019; Overton & Molenaar, 2015). Although several different models of development have been derived from ideas in RDS metatheory (Lerner, 2018a), all models emphasize that the fundamental process of development involves systematic, holistic, integrated, embodied, and mutually-influential relations (termed \u201cdynamic relations) across the life span (Overton, 2015). These relations are most often represented in the literature as individual \u21d4 context relations (e.g., Cantor et\u00a0 al., 2021; Nucci, in press). When individual \u21d4 context relations are mutually beneficial both the individual and the context are maintained and perpetuated across time (e.g., Gottlieb, 1998; Johanson & Edey, 1981; Tobach & Schneirla, 1968).\nIn the life course of humans, these mutually beneficial relations prototypically involve the provisions of developmentally-nurturant coactions with others in the individual\u2019s social world, that is, individual \u21d4 individual relationships (e.g., Bornstein, 2015; Cantor & Osher, 2021; Cantor et\u00a0 al., 2021). Developmentally-nurturant coactions involve relationships that provide safety for a developing individual and, as well, the resources for healthy and positive development in youth (e.g., warm, responsive, affirming, and authoritative parenting; e.g., Bornstein et\u00a0 al., 2022), in ways that promote feelings of well-being, of mattering to care providers, even being loved by them, and that their individuality is known and valued (Cantor et\u00a0 al., 2019). These coactive relationships are foundations in RDS-based models of the life course of health and positive human development (Lerner, 2018b). Examples are the theories of Bronfenbrenner and Morris (2006), regarding individuals\u2019 development within the nested bioecological systems comprising human development; of Fischer and colleagues (e.g., Mascolo & Bidell, 2020; Mascolo & Fischer, 2015) regarding dynamic skills development involved in cognition and holistic learning; and of Raeff (2016, 2020), in the development of complex human cognitive, affective, and cultural systems.\nMoreover, the central role of developmentally-nurturant relationships in promoting health and positive development is not only a foundation of developmental theories associated with human ontogeny but, as well, of all biological life. Examples are models of the processes involved in biological evolution, particularly of hominids and, most importantly, humans (e.g., Jablonka & Lamb, 2005; Johanson & Edey, 1981; Witherington & Lickliter, 2016); comparative behavioral development involving the importance in vertebrates of conspecific social relationships (e.g., Tobach & Schneirla, 1968); and the epigenetic changes involved in social genomics, again particularly among humans (Cole, 2014; Slavich & Cole, 2013). In short, within dynamic, RDS-based theories, developmentally-nurturant relationships\u2014relationships that provide safety and afford a sense of being known as a specific individual that matters and belongs (Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015, 2018a, b)\u2014have fundamental and, it appears, universal significance for biological well-being (health) and, more generally, for thriving (Lerner et\u00a0al., 2018a, b; Masten, 2014).\nThere is a link, then, between developmentally-nurturant relations\u2014relations that enable an individual young person to feel that they are known, that they matter, and in fact that they may even be loved\u2014and thriving, or positive youth development (PYD), within RDS-based models (Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015, 2018a, b). Advancing the further study of the relation between developmentally-nurturant relationships and PYD through contributing to the measurement of this key relation is the main theoretical impetus of the present study.\n1 3\nPast literature associated with RDS-based approaches to understanding the dynamic coactions between an individual and the context that are constitutive of developmental change have often focused on the second decade of life, on adolescence (Bowers et\u00a0 al., 2015; Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015). This focus emerged because of the panoply of biological, psychological, behavioral, and sociocultural changes marking life across this decade and, as well, because of the enhanced role that agency and choice play in an individual youth in setting the direction of development across subsequent decades (e.g., Bowers et\u00a0al., 2015; Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015). The adolescent period has become, then, a sample case assessing the usefulness of RDS-based models to describe, explain, and optimize individuals\u2019 health and positive development, both in the U.S. and internationally (e.g., Damon, 2004; Larson, 2000; Leman et\u00a0al., 2017; Petersen et\u00a0al., 2017).\nPerhaps not surprisingly, therefore, several RDS-based models of PYD have been tested (e.g., Barbarin et\u00a0al., 2020; Damon, 2008; Murry et\u00a0al., 2016; Smith et\u00a0al., 2013; Spencer, 2006). However, as documented in discussions by Petersen et\u00a0al. (2017) and by data presented by Qi et\u00a0 al. (2021), the theoretical conception of PYD formulated by Lerner and Lerner (e.g., Lerner, 2021; Lerner et\u00a0 al., 2015, 2018a, b) has been the predominant one used in the U.S. and around the world by researchers and youth program practitioners.\nThe Lerner and Lerner model (e.g., Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015) specifies that young people will thrive when mutually beneficial youth \u21d4 adult relationships exist. These relationships are instances of developmentally-nurturant ones (Lerner, 2004), and are one of three components of out-of-school-time youth programs that have been demonstrated to promote PYD (Lerner, 2018b). Programs successful in promoting thriving integrate developmentally-nurturant relationships between an adult and a youth with life-skill-building activities within the relationship and also offer opportunities for the youth to enact these skills in valued family, school, and community activities. When these \u201cBig Three\u201d (Lerner, 2004; see also Tirrell et\u00a0al., 2020) attributes are present in a youth-development program, young people will show PYD, marked by \u201cFive Cs,\u201d that is, competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring. When these Cs are developed, a youth is likely to develop a \u201cSixth C,\u201d that is, contribution, to self, family, school, and community. Among youth with high levels of PYD, contribution will transform during the\u00a0middle-to-late portions of the adolescent period into positive civic engagement (Zaff et\u00a0al., 2011); the young person will endeavor to contribute to the institutions of civil society and democracy and work to promote social justice and equity (Lerner, 2004).\nDevelopmentally-nurturant relationships are the resource (or the developmental asset; Benson, 2008) enabling these developments to unfold, and Theokas and Lerner (2006) report that parents and other family members are the major source of this developmental asset. However, the second major source of this developmental asset, both in the U.S. and internationally, is youth development programs, especially those whose theory of change aligns with the above-noted Big Three features of programs, namely youth \u21d4 adult relationships (e.g., Hershberg et\u00a0al., 2015; Tirrell et\u00a0al., 2021a, b).\nThe Lerner and Lerner PYD model is, at this writing, increasingly used globally in research and practice and, in particular, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; e.g., Geldhof et\u00a0al., 2021; Lansford et\u00a0al., 2021; Petersen et\u00a0al., 2017; Tirrell, Dowling, et\u00a0al., 2019). In these settings, youth often face challenges to their health and general well-being or, even more, experience traumatic events because of poverty, racism, and associated inequities in education, food, housing, health resources, and employment opportunities (e.g., Lauxman et\u00a0al., 2021). Both researchers and practitioners delivering youth programs would find it beneficial, for theoretical and applied reasons, respectively, to possess a measure of youth perceptions of having the developmentally-nurturant relationships emphasized in the\n1 3\ndevelopmental science literature and, particularly, in contemporary RDS-based PYD models, such as the Lerner and Lerner model. Unfortunately, at this writing, such a measure does not exist.\nThis omission represents an important theoretical lacuna in the measurement model used to test the structural model proposed by Lerner et\u00a0al. (e.g., 2015). Without evidence that an RDS-based model of PYD involves the presence of youth perceptions of being known and loved, the general developmental process specified in RDS-based conceptions (see Cantor et\u00a0al., 2021) is weakened. Simply, a valid measure of youth perceptions of being known and loved must be part of a research process validating the existence of theoretically-specified covariation among the constructs included in the nomological net involved in the Lerner and Lerner model of PYD."

            "text": "This article reports enactment of a measure-development study undertaken in order to fill the theoretical gap existing because a key measure\u2014of youth feeling known and loved\u2014 has not been included in the nomological net of constructs, that is, the measurement model, used to test the theoretical conception of the thriving process specified within the Lerner and Lerner PYD model (e.g., 2019; Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015) or to evaluate the usefulness of the model when it has been used to promote PYD among youth, particularly youth in LMICs who have developed within a context wherein they have encountered poverty and the above-noted associated inequities. To undertake this work, we embedded measure-development research within an ongoing multi-nation longitudinal study of PYD among youth who participated in the programs provided by Compassion International (CI) and among a matched group of youth not participating in these programs. The CI Study of PYD (e.g., Lerner et\u00a0 al., 2018a, b; Lerner et\u00a0 al., 2021; Tirrell, Dowling, et\u00a0 al., 2019; Tirrell et\u00a0 al., 2019a, b; Tirrell et\u00a0al., 2020; Tirrell et\u00a0al., 2021a, b) is a researcher-practitioner collaboration that was created to generate developmental data about the pathways of PYD traversed by youth living in three of the 25 LMICs (i.e., El Salvador, Rwanda, and Uganda) wherein CI practitioners deliver their programs.\nCI is a youth-serving organization that seeks to enact theory-predicated and evidencebased approaches to its youth development programs (Sim & Peters, 2014; Tirrell et\u00a0al., 2019a, b). CI is a faith-based child-sponsorship and youth development organization that serves more than 2.2 million children and youth living in poverty across 25 LMICs in Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. CI partners with over 8,000 local churches and projects to enact its programs, which seek to promote PYD and thriving by using a holistic,\u00a0strengths-based\u00a0approach to its programs. Because CI is committed to the core belief that \u201call children should be known, loved, and protected\u201d (Compassion International, 2022, p. 1), it believed that it was aligned well with the Lerner and Lerner model and, as such, it created a partnership that used the model to frame its youth programs.\nFinancial realities associated with the costs of conducting cohort-comparative counterfactual longitudinal research precluded conducting the CI Study of PYD within all of the nations served by CI. Accordingly, we present data collected in El Salvador and Rwanda, that is, the two nations served by CI within which we were able to conduct measuredevelopment research prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; this research enabled us to assess whether an invariant index of being known and loved could be devised across different national contexts and, as well, whether, within either nation, scores from the measure being\n1 3\ndeveloped had patterns of covariation that were consistent with the Lerner and Lerner model.\nIn regard to the characteristics of these two countries, Rwanda has the highest population density in Africa (13 million people) and is one of the world\u2019s poorest nations. The World Bank (2022a) reported that poverty has dropped in Rwanda since 2000, but 56.5% of people still lived below the extreme poverty line in 2016 (based on $1.90 per day per capita).1 In turn, El Salvador is the third largest economy in Central America and the most densely populated. According to the World Bank (2022b), 22.3% of people in El Salvador lived below the poverty line in 2019 (down from 39% in 2007) and 1.5% lived below the extreme poverty line in 2019 (based on $1.90 per day per capita).2\nIn addition to issues of poverty, within both El Salvador and Rwanda, crime and violence threaten social development and economic growth and negatively affect the lives of many youth. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest homicide rate in the world and one of the highest homicide rates among adolescents in the world (see Centeno, 2017). According to UNICEF (2017), El Salvador is one of the deadliest places in the world for boys (behind the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq, Venezuela, and Colombia) and for girls (behind the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq, Afghanistan, Honduras, Somalia, and South Sudan). In the nations outside of Latin America, most adolescent deaths are due to armed conflict and war (or collective violence) but, in El Salvador, most deaths are due to homicide (UNICEF, 2017). In Rwanda, almost two in ten adolescent girls experience forced sex, and nearly half of children aged five live with a mother who is a victim of intimate partner violence (UNICEF, 2017). The 1994 genocide also continues to affect the lives of many adolescents. Many of\u00a0 the children and adolescents who survived the 1994 genocide\u2014now raising the next generation\u2014are victims of rape, torture, starvation, mutilation, and emotional abuse, have lost at least one of their family members, and/or have witnessed violence, injury, or killing. The physical and emotional trauma parents suffer lead to negative indirect impacts on the lives of Rwandese youth (see Uwizeye et\u00a0al., 2022) and, as well, studies demonstrate the intergenerational transmission of this trauma (see Kahn & Denov, 2022).\nIn sum, challenging and often traumatic experiences are parts of the lives of youth in both El Salvador and Rwanda. However, on the other hand, contrasting historical and current (at this writing) contextual conditions also frame the lives of youth across these two nations. Accordingly, we believe there is both theoretical value and potential applied significance in interrogating three questions: (1) Can youth perceptions of being known and loved be measured in both nations?; (2) Can the measure be shown to possess at least strong invariance within and across nations?; and (3) Are scores from the measure situated in a nomological net (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) of covariations with other measures in a manner consistent with the Lerner and Lerner model of PYD? Although answers to these questions will of course require cross-validation in other CI countries and, as well, in studies conducted by other researchers and practitioners to test and use, respectively, the Lerner\n1 Since the 1994 genocide, Rwanda has gone through numerous changes and human development indicators started to improve significantly. For instance, from 1994 to 2020, immunization rates for children ages 12-13 months increased from 23% to 91%. In addition, from 2000 to 2020, access to basic drinking water services grew from 45% to 60%; and access to basic sanitation raised from 45% to over 69%. Moreover, the mortality rate dropped from 191 deaths per 1000 live births in 1994 to 30 deaths per 1000 live births in 2020. In 2018, the net primary school enrollment rate in Rwanda was 95% (World Bank, 2022a). 2 There are approximately 6.5 million people living in El Salvador, most of whom live in urban centers. The World Bank (2022a) reports that poverty has decreased in Rwanda since 2000 but, beginning with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty in El Salvador increased by 4.6% from 2019 to 2020.\n1 3\nand Lerner model, we believe the data reported in the present article will provide a useful foundation for this subsequent work."

In addition, in order to assess patterns of covariation within the above-noted nomological net of other constructs related to PYD, four existing measures of constructs were used: intentional self-regulation, hopeful future expectations, transcendence, and contribution (see Lerner, 2018a,\u00a0b; Lerner & Lerner, 2019; Lerner et\u00a0al, 2015, 2018a, b, for full details of the nomological net of constructs involved in the Lerner and Lerner measurement model).\nIn the Lerner and Lerner model, intentional self-regulation (ISR) is defined as the ability to select goals and work toward achieving them despite facing challenges and setbacks (Freund & Baltes, 2002). ISR is regarded as a youth strength that contributes to the development of the Five Cs. Similarly, hopeful future expectations (HFE), defined as possessing the expectation that good things will happen in the future, at least in part because of one\u2019s agency (as indexed by ISR) is also considered a youth strength contributing to PYD (Schmid et\u00a0 al., 2011). In addition, spiritual transcendence, defined as an individual\u2019s connection to a divine or supernatural other beyond the self (King et\u00a0al., 2017), is also regarded as a strength of youth associated with PYD, especially among young people who have experienced disparities and challenging or traumatic experiences in their lives. The model includes the idea that, when these\n1 3\nstrengths are fostered and aligned with a young person\u2019s perception that the context affords being known and loved by caring and supportive adults, then thriving will occur. Such thriving is then expected to covary with positive engagement with and contributions to their settings\u2014that is, youth actively engage with and give back to the context that is supporting them (Lerner, 2004; Lerner et\u00a0al., 2005, 2015; Zaff et\u00a0al., 2010, 2011)."

            "text": "Although prior research has developed measures that are consonant with the conception of either being known or being loved, no extant measure reflected the integration of these two concepts, particularly within the conception of developmentally-nurturant relationships found with RDS-based models of PYD in general or the Lerner and Lerner model more specifically. For example, research regarding feelings of \u201cbeing known\u201d includes employees feeling known by their work project teams (Purvanova, 2013), patients feeling known by their nurses and healthcare workers (Jacobsen et\u00a0al., 2015; Somerville, 2009), and students feeling known by their instructors (Chhuon & Wallace, 2014; Rodriguez-Keyes et\u00a0al., 2013; Wallace et\u00a0al., 2012). In the study of adolescent development, research on \u201cbeing known\u201d has focused on the school context, for instance, being known by teachers and feeling a sense of connectedness and belonging to school (Nakkula, 2008; Stafford-Brizard, 2016; Wallace et\u00a0al., 2012). In turn, in regard to youth being loved, Barrett et\u00a0al. (2019) noted that, despite the importance and role of love in contributing to positive development across the life span, there remained the need for a measure of \u201cfeeling loved;\u201d as such, Barrett et\u00a0al. created a short self-report \u201cfeeling loved\u201d measure that assessed both self-love and feeling loved. The Tirrell et\u00a0al. (2020) measure of the \u201cBig Three\u201d features of effective youth programs included a scale of perceived program safety, as well as an adult mentorship component specific to adults working in youth programs.\nHowever, what was still needed to measure the known-and-loved construct within the theoretical model framing the present work was a non-program-specific measure to assess youth perceptions of being known and loved by adults in their lives. Accordingly, 14 items were generated as part of the CI Study of PYD to assess whether youth felt known (seven items) and loved (seven items) by at least one adult in their lives. In the present study, we present below the process of refining the original known and loved (KL) item pool to a parsimonious and robust, single-factor, five-item scale."

Initial piloting of the survey showed that all youth consistently chose responses in intervals of 5 (e.g., youth would choose a response of 85 or 90, but never 82 or 91), so the survey design was altered to use a sliding scale that moved in increments of 5 to improve ease of use (effectively creating a 21-point scale). All participating youth were given the scales in the same order. Table\u00a01S in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) presents all items for the measures used in the present article.\nFollowing ethical review and approval and obtaining informed consent, we collected data from youth participating in CI-supported programs in Rwanda and El Salvador and from a matched comparison sample of youth from the same communities within which CI youth resided within each nation. Eligibility for CI support was based on multiple criteria, including age, household monthly income relative to number of dependents, lack of other financial child-sponsorship support, proximity to a CI-supported project site, and additional indicators of poverty (e.g., housing quality, access to resources such as water source). Comparison samples of non-CI-supported youth from the same communities as the CI program sites were selected based on meeting CI\u2019s eligibility criteria for sponsorship.\nThe CI national office in each nation selected CI project sites from urban and rural locations from which to collect data (18 sites in Rwanda and 20 in El Salvador). CI staff made these selections based on their judgments of sites that represented the best program outcomes and implementation (e.g., in regard to graduation rates and extra-program activities). CI national staff held three informational meetings for collaborating facilitators at the selected project sites, which included describing the study methodology and answering questions about the survey or broader research program.\nIndependent data collectors were recruited from a local university and/or recruited based on previous experience with children and technology (as the surveys were tabletbased). Data collectors went through three days of training prior to data collection. The first day was dedicated to educating them about CI (e.g., history, mission, impact, child protection policy, and procedure) and informing them about the purpose of the study. They were then introduced to the survey questions and response options and trained on the methodology. On the third day, data collectors piloted the survey with CI-supported project youth. Based on concerns and questions that came up at these training sessions, edits were made and documented in the records of the research team.\nThe local data collection team administered one-on-one interviews by reading the survey questions and entering youth responses into an online survey. The typical survey length was about 30\u201345\u00a0min to complete. Participating sites were given thank-you gifts as determined by the project staff, including gift baskets, shoes, and/or clothing. Data collection took place in Rwanda in May\u2013June 2018, and in El Salvador in June\u2013July 2018.\nPrior to data collection, members of the researcher-practitioner collaboration worked together to draft new items to include in the KL item pool. Through roundtable-type discussions, CI leadership and practitioners elaborated on CI\u2019s belief regarding all youth\n1 3\ndeserving to be known and loved and how those constructs might be manifested in the lives of youth. The results of these discussions were that the researchers worked to create a measure of youth feeling that they were known and loved that was framed by RDS-based metatheory (emphasizing person \u21d4 context relations). In seeking to maximize the chances for strong psychometric properties (see Clifton, 2020), items were iteratively drafted and revised by CI Study of PYD partners. This process resulted in a pool of 14 items (seven each reflecting \u201cknown\u201d and \u201cloved;\u201d see Table\u00a01S in the ESM), generated with the intention of trimming the pool for parsimony and robustness once data were collected and analyzed. Items were then added to the survey and translated as described above."

We then assessed the psychometric properties of the KL measure in El Salvador. Last, we tested for cross-national measurement invariance across Rwanda and El Salvador in an effort to establish cross-national validation of the measurement model.\nAnalyses were conducted using Mplus Version 8 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017). Across all models tested, we used multiple goodness of fit indices as recommended by Brown (2006). Absolute fit was tested by checking for \u03c72 significance (although an oversensitivity of this test is noted due to large sample sizes; see Rutkowski & Svetina, 2017) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), with values closer to 0 indicating better fit (Brown, 2006). Parsimony\u2013corrected fit was assessed by evaluating the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and its confidence interval, with values closer to 0 indicating better model fit (Brown, 2006). The suggested upper bounds, or cut-off values, of acceptable fit for the SRMR and RMSEA are 0.08, and ideally less than 0.05 (Brown & Cudeck, 1993; Hu & Bentler, 1999; Steiger, 1990). Comparative fit, the evaluation of the specified solution in comparison to a null model in which no items are correlated, was tested with the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), with values closer to 1 indicating better model fit (Brown, 2006). The suggested lower bounds, or cutoff values, of acceptable fit for the CFI and TLI are 0.90, and ideally above 0.95 (Bentler, 1990).\nWe used the Rwanda data to test the 14 items pertinent to KL using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). For the EFA, Geomin rotation (Mplus default) was used for a parsimonious factor pattern matrix. A combination of criteria was used to determine the adequate number of factors to retain, including a scree plot (Cattell, 1966), parallel analysis (Horn, 1965), and the above-noted multiple goodness of fit indices as recommended by Brown (2006). Out of necessity for fitting the EFA models, we had to ignore nesting.\nFollowing the results of the EFA, we explored Pearson product-moment correlations among the 14 KL items in the Rwanda data to determine which items to trim for parsimony. Highly correlated items (r > 0.8) were considered empirically redundant and thus further explored regarding content/wording to determine which items to retain.\nThe psychometric properties of the resulting refined scale were then assessed in each data set (Rwanda and El Salvador). Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha and the omega coefficient for model-based reliability. Convergent validity was tested by including measures of youth strengths (ISR, HFE, and transcendence; believed to coact with contextual supports like KL in promoting thriving) and contribution (a theoretically specified outcome of PYD; Lerner et\u00a0 al., 2015) and\n1 3\nassessing their interrelations. Between-group measurement invariance was tested across age (9\u201312 and 13\u201318\u00a0years, given the age distributions in each data set), gender (boys and girls), urban\u2013rural area, and CI-enrollment status, respectively, within each nation using a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) with added constraints, described further below (see Little, 2013).\nFor all models, maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (ESTIMATOR = MLR in Mplus) was used, and nesting within project sites was accommodated using a sandwich estimator (TYPE = COMPLEX in Mplus). We used the criterion suggested by Cheung and Rensvold (2002) and further supported by Kim et\u00a0al. (2017) for establishing invariance if changes in CFI are less than or equal to 0.01 across subsequent models (also due to an oversensitivity of the \u03c72 difference test to small differences in large samples; see Rutkowski & Svetina, 2017).\nBetween-group measurement invariance refers to the comparability of measures across specific groups (i.e., whether measures assess the same latent constructs and demonstrate strong psychometric properties). For between-group measurement invariance, we first tested for configural invariance (that is, equivalence of the measurement model structure) across groups (younger-older, boys-girls, urban\u2013rural, CI-enrollment status, and nation). Next, we tested for metric (weak factorial) invariance (that is, equivalence of the factor loadings within the measurement structure) by equating the factor loadings across groups and allowing the latent variances in one group (older, boys, rural, non-CI-supported, and Rwanda, respectively) to be freely estimated. Then, we tested for scalar (strong factorial) invariance (that is, equivalence of the factor loadings and item intercepts within the measurement structure) by equating the factor loadings and item intercepts across groups and allowing the latent variances and latent means in one group (older, boys, rural, non-CI-supported, and Rwanda, respectively) to be freely estimated (see Little, 1997, 2013). Establishing invariance then enabled us to compare the means of the latent\u00a0constructs and their interrelations across the respective groups.\nIn cross-national research, establishing measurement invariance across national contexts (in different countries with different cultures) enables comparisons to be made in interpreting measurement outcomes (van de Vijver, 2019). Accordingly, we last tested for between-group (cross-national) measurement invariance across Rwanda and El Salvador to provide initial evidence of cross-national validation (see Dimitrova & Wiium, 2021; Kim et\u00a0al., 2017; Rutkowski & Svetina, 2017). Model constraints in the scalar (strong factorial) invariance model revealed whether mean levels of the latent constructs differed between nations; to compare the correlations among the latent constructs between Rwanda and El Salvador, the Wald test of parameter estimates was used (MODEL TEST in Mplus)."

            "text": "For the EFA conducted on the 14 KL items using the Rwanda data, scree plot and parallel analysis eigenvalues suggested a one-factor solution (see Fig.\u00a0 1S in the ESM). Factor loadings were all significant and ranged from 0.763 to 0.918; however, model fit was poor: \u03c72(65) = 849.84, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.100 (90% CI [0.094, 0.106]); CFI = 0.818; TLI = 0.781; SRMR = 0.056. Despite model fit improving with additional factors, cross-loadings among several items and high correlations among latent factors (e.g., r = 0.803 in the two-factor solution) suggested that the one-factor solution might indeed provide the best (conceptual) fit to the data. Accordingly, we next assessed interitem correlations among the 14 items (see Table\u00a0 1S in the ESM) to determine which items to trim to obtain a good-fitting, parsimonious, single-factor solution.\nInter-item correlations and item wording suggested several potential items to remove from the factor solution. For instance, KL Item 7 correlated highly (\u2265 0.8) with KL Items 3, 4, 5, and 6. As such, we retained KL Item 7 and trimmed the other four items from the factor solution. Similarly, retaining KL Item 9 allowed us to trim Items 10 and 11. We also inspected item wording to ensure that the scale was not only empirically parsimonious but also conceptually so. For instance, KL Items 13 and 14 correlated highly (r = 0.832) so we assessed wording to determine which item to retain (in this case, we decided that having an adult \u201cwho will love me no matter what I do\u201d was more representative of the intended construct, than having an adult \u201cwho looks forward to spending time with me\u201d). In addition, KL Items 1, 2, 8, and 12 did not correlate highly with the remaining items; however, we decided to trim Items 1 and 12 due to language deemed less meaningful to or reflective of the intended construct, compared to the retained items. As such, we were left with a five-item solution including KL Items 2, 7, 8, 9, and 14."

Cronbach\u2019s alpha indicated strong internal consistency reliability (\u03b1 = 0.92), as did the omega coefficient (\u03c9 = 0.92). To assess model fit along with convergent validity and measurement invariance, we tested a series of CFAs with the five-item KL factor along with factors of ISR, HFE, transcendence, and contribution (see Fig.\u00a02S in the ESM).\nIn a test of the full Rwanda sample, the measurement model provided excellent fit to the data: \u03c72(367) = 940.482, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.036 (90% CI [0.033, 0.039]); CFI = 0.967; TLI = 0.963; SRMR = 0.028.

The moderate correlations among KL and the youth strengths and outcomes pertinent to CI programs (r = 0.494 with ISR; 0.384 with HFE; 0.594 with transcendence; and 0.413 with contribution), provided initial evidence for convergent validity of the KL measure.\n1 3\nWe then tested the full measurement model for between-group measurement invariance across age, gender, urban\u2013rural area, and CI-enrollment status in Rwanda (see Table\u00a03 for model fit statistics).

To pursue this goal, we capitalized on data sets in two nations (Rwanda and El Salvador) wherein an ongoing multinational study of PYD was being used in the design of youth programs provided by Compassion International (CI).\nThe results of the present research established the psychometric quality of the measure of youth perceptions of being known and loved. Both within and across the data sets from Rwanda and El Salvador our findings supported the reliability and within- and acrossnation invariance of the measure and, as well, demonstrated the presence of theoreticallypredicated covariations between scores from the known and loved measure and scores from other constructs (i.e., intentional self-regulation, hopeful future expectations, transcendence, and contribution) within the nomological net proposed in the Lerner and Lerner PYD model (e.g., Lerner & Lerner, 2019; Lerner et\u00a0al., 2015).\nBeyond the psychometric and validational contributions of the known and loved measure for the PYD model we tested, the results of this research illustrated the usefulness of having a measure of youth perceptions of being known and loved in illuminating variation in the processes involved in thriving, both within and across samples of youth developing within LMICs and, as well, among youth participating or not participating in youth development programs designed to promote PYD. For instance, results of the between-group measurement invariance tests revealed that, in the Rwanda sample, older youth reported significantly higher levels of ISR and contribution than younger youth, and that boys and rural youth reported significantly lower levels of KL than girls and urban youth, respectively. We also found that CI-supported youth in Rwanda reported higher levels of each of the five PYD\u00a0constructs we measured compared to non-CI-supported youth. In turn, in the El Salvador sample, older youth reported significantly lower levels of ISR, HFE, transcendence and contribution compared to younger youth; boys reported significantly lower levels of ISR compared to girls; rural youth reported significantly higher levels of contribution\n1 3\ncompared to urban youth; and CI-supported youth reported significantly lower levels of transcendence compared to non-CI-supported youth.\nBy exploring possible demographic moderators of invariance, these analyses were undertaken in the service of ascertaining the robustness of the cross-national invariance that was found (Duncan et\u00a0al., 2014). Although these robustness analyses were hypothesis searching rather than hypothesis testing (Cattell, 1966), they do provide potentially provocative instances of variation that may be explored in future research in Rwanda and El Salvador, in other nations within which CI has programs, in LMICs within which CI does not work and, perhaps as well, in nations within the minority world. For instance, it might be expected that\u00a0older youth will demonstrate stronger intentional self-regulation skills and higher contribution beyond the self, as was found in the Rwanda sample. In what nations and under what individual \u21d4 context coactions will comparable versus divergent findings be identified and what dynamic processes are involved in such variation? In turn, the finding that older youth were lower on nearly all constructs in El Salvador is puzzling and may suggest either developmental differences or cultural differences in response styles. Future research, both in El Salvador and in other nations would help address this question. In any case, the invariance that was identified through the present research, which underscores the robustness of data supporting cross-national consistency in the measurement model pertinent to being known and loved, enables questions such as the ones we have suggested to be appropriately interrogated.\nSimilarly, future research might build on the findings (1) that youth in Rwanda tended to report significantly lower levels of each of the five constructs within the Lerner and Lerner nomological net of constructs we assessed compared to youth in El Salvador and, as well, (2) that patterns in the correlations among the constructs differed between the Rwanda and El Salvador samples. Perhaps these differences between Rwandese and Salvadoran youth reflect cultural variations in the development of these indicators of positive development, and/or cultural differences in the willingness of youth to assess themselves as having high scores on these constructs. Whether these differences were due to differences in the broader ecological contexts across the two LMICs, or due to contextual or cultural differences in response style (e.g., differences in survey biases such as social desirability bias) remains unknown and requires further exploration. As the CI Study of PYD continues, qualitative research (e.g., involving assessments of the semantic space within these constructs that exist in each nation) could illuminate whether our conjectures here are reasonable.\nNonetheless, establishing measurement invariance and cross-national validation across two LMICs in Africa and Central America is timely and important, perhaps especially given the calls by international development organizations including UNICEF, USAID, and World Bank to better implement, evaluate, and document PYD programs in LMICs with robust and consistent measurement models, for instance, in assessing progress toward the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (see United Nations, 2015; YouthPower Learning, 2017)."

            "text": "Our interpretations of the findings need to be considered with an understanding of the limitations of this research. As we have noted, we were limited by only having one time of testing. With additional times of testing, developmental trajectories might be assessed, including models testing predictive relations among the constructs (e.g., mediation; see\n1 3\nMaxwell & Cole, 2007), as well as more powerful time-series data analysis techniques (e.g., dynamic structural equation modeling, etc.; see McNeish & Hamaker, 2020; Yu et\u00a0al., 2021). Future research might include additional times of testing to ascertain the use of such models and, if sufficient power is present, to use the Bornstein (2017, 2019) specificity principle to assess what features of what programs promote what facets of thriving among what specific youth (e.g., see Rhodes, 2020, and Cantor et\u00a0al., 2021, for discussions of the importance of such specificity analyses in PYD research). Nonetheless, we were able to demonstrate a preliminary assessment of a measurement model assessing person\u21d4context relations in youth programs.\nMeasurement issues also limit our present findings. Our study included only five variables (KL, ISR, HFE, transcendence, and contribution) and therefore unmeasured variables might enable better conceptualization of mediation and moderation effects. Moreover, all of our measures were collected using interviewer-led youth self-reports, which are susceptible to self-report biases (e.g., response-style bias, social desirability bias, or responses biased by stereotype threat). Last, the hypothesized interrelations among the person- and context-related variables might be better assessed by triangulation with additional measures, methods of assessing constructs, and/or sources of information, for instance, parents or program staff.\nSampling and diversity were also limitations in the present study. Two data sets were used\u2014one from Rwanda and one from El Salvador\u2014involving youth enrolled in CIsupported programs and comparison youth who were eligible economically for CI support but were not involved in CI programs. Although comparison youth were selected to meet eligibility criteria for enrollment in CI programs\u2014meaning all participants were living in contexts of poverty\u2014diversity of life experiences and developmental histories were not assessed. Future studies might include youth from more diverse backgrounds including diverse socioeconomic statuses, diverse geographic locations, cultures (including nationalities, languages, ethnicities, religions, identities, etc.), and ages to more thoroughly examine demographic and individual differences and specificity (Bornstein, 2017, 2019) and to generalize results and applications of the measure across broader contexts.\nFurthermore, regarding sampling, and as noted in the Procedure section, project sites were selected for study in the CI Study of PYD to represent the best program outcomes. As such, findings may not be generalizable to less-exemplary sites, or to youth in other communities and nations. This limitation further emphasizes the importance of attending to specificity in future research with different samples across varied demographic groups and contexts (Bornstein, 2017, 2019)."

            "text": "In all RDS-based conceptions of development and, more specifically, of PYD, developmentally-nurturant relationships between specific youth and specific contexts (including specific adults in the social ecology of a young person) are the foundation of both youth thriving and of programs effective in promoting such thriving. Accordingly, both researchers studying, and practitioners delivering programs to promote, PYD conceptualized within RDS-based models of youth thriving will find it beneficial to possess a measure of youth perceptions of the outcome of such relationships, that is, feeling known and loved. This present research provides evidence that an at least first step in developing such a measure\n1 3\nhas been taken and, as well, that there is evidence of the usefulness of such a measure within a widely-used RDS-based model of PYD.\nWe hope that the readers of this article will find that the results of the present research are therefore both timely and important. Indeed, as developmental scientists seeking to describe, explain, and optimize human development, including promoting thriving among diverse youth, taking such intentional and rigorous approaches to developing measures will be contributing essential scholarship that can continue to refine developmental theory and its applications in program evaluation efforts that enhance the success of youth development programs.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10566- 022- 09725-6.\nFunding Funding was provided by Compassion International."
