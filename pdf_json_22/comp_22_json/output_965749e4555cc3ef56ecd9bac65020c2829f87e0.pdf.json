    "abstractText": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been widely used for various clinic applications to reduce the X-ray dose absorbed by patients. However, LDCT is usually degraded by severe noise over the image space. The image quality of LDCT has attracted aroused attentions of scholars. In this study, we propose the bilateral weighted relative total variation (BRTV) used for image restoration to simultaneously maintain edges and further reduce noise, then propose the BRTV-regularized projections onto convex sets (POCS-BRTV) model for LDCT reconstruction. Referring to the spacial closeness and the similarity of gray value between two pixels in a local rectangle, POCS-BRTV can adaptively extract sharp edges and minor details during the iterative reconstruction process. Evaluation indexes and visual effects are used to measure the performances among different algorithms. Experimental results indicate that the proposed POCS-BRTV model can achieve superior image quality than the compared algorithms in terms of the structure and texture preservation.",

            "text": "Computed tomography (CT) is a technique based on X-ray attenuation to reconstruct tomographic images of an object [1]. As one of the greatest scientific and technological achievements at the end of twentieth century, CT have had a revolutionary impact on clinical screening, diagnosis, imageguided surgery, image-guided radiotherapy, and other aspects [2, 3]. However, the widespread use of CT has aroused people\u2019s concern about causing cancer or genetic abnormalities\n[4, 5]. Therefore, strategies were proposed to lower X-ray dose in CT scanning [6], such as reducing tube current or peak voltage, decreasing the number of projections, and improving the hardware of CT system. All of the above methods can reduce the X-ray dose absorbed by patients, while this paper mainly studies low-dose CT acquired by reducing the radiation tube current or tube voltage. CT imaging artifacts brought by these methods are not too serious. However, due to the low signalto-noise ratio of the obtained projection data, images reconstructed by traditional methods are usually severely degraded by noise, which might affect radiologists\u2019 diagnosis [7]. In order to reconstruct high-quality images from low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) projection data, methods including projection domain preprocessing, iterative reconstruction, and post-processing have been proposed.\nOperations on sinogram, called projection preprocessing method, aim to reduce noise in raw data. Projection data could be considered a noisy image. Denoising filters are usually designed according to the noise characteristics or structure information of the sinogram. Compared with other methods, projection preprocessing takes the statistical properties of noise as prior information. In recent years, models like penalized likelihood [8] and sparsity-based sinogram denoising [9] have been proposed to suppress noise\n* Li Zeng drlizeng@cqu.edu.cn\n1 College of\u00a0Mathematics and\u00a0Statistics, Chongqing University, Chongqing\u00a0401331, China\n2 Engineering Research Center of\u00a0Industrial Computed Tomography, Nondestructive Testing of\u00a0the\u00a0Education Ministry of\u00a0China, Chongqing University, Chongqing\u00a0400044, China\n3 Department of\u00a0Radiology, Southwest Hospital of\u00a0AMU, Chongqing,\u00a0Chongqing\u00a0400038, China\n4 College of\u00a0Mathematics and\u00a0Statistics, Chongqing Technology and\u00a0Business University, Chongqing\u00a0400067, China\n1 3\nand avoid edge blurring in sinogram. Liu et\u00a0al. developed a well-designed composite dictionary with discriminative features in sinogram domain [10]. Xie et\u00a0al. made full use of the prior knowledge and statistical properties of LDCT sinogram to formulate the preprocessing as a standard maximum a posteriori estimation [11]. Karimi et\u00a0al. proposed simultaneous sparse representation (SSR) method [12], which is similar to sparse representation-based dictionary learning [13, 14] and non-local means algorithm [15, 16]. Hu et\u00a0al. developed an improved Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) framework for sinogram to enhance the reconstructed image quality [17].\nPost-processing method is not limited by CT supplier. Some outstanding filters and networks have been presented to tackle LDCT restoration, such as BM3D [18, 19], conveying path-based convolutional encoder-decoder network (CPCE) [20], and joint bilateral filter net (JBFnet) [21]. Postprocessing methods can be directly applied to the reconstructed CT images and easily integrated into the current CT workflow. Based on the\u00a0statistical property of CT images, Choi et\u00a0al. proposed a deep learning approach to statistical image restoration for LDCT [22]. Shiri et\u00a0al. applied a residual convolutional neural network to cope with ultralow-dose CT images of COVID-19 patients [23]. Gholizadeh-Ansari et\u00a0al. used dilated convolutions with different dilation rates to capture more contextual information in fewer layers for LDCT [24].\nIterative reconstruction methods can also be used to enhance image quality of LDCT by taking advantages of the measured data information and some prior knowledge. Gao et\u00a0al. proposed a prior-based machine learning model for Bayesian reconstruction of ultralow-dose CT images [25]. He et\u00a0 al. developed a noise suppression-guided image filtering reconstruction (NSGIFR) algorithm [26] for LDCT reconstruction. They introduced guided image filtering (GIF) [27] and block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) [18, 19] to achieve an outstanding performance on noise suppression and texture preservation. As a commonly used regularization method, total variation (TV) [28, 29] uses L1-norm of the image gradient to decrease noise in LDCT image reconstruction. However, TV-based reconstruction results are weak in retaining image structure, at the same time introducing blocking artifacts, which affects the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, Yu et\u00a0al. considered L0-norm-based LDCT image reconstruction model, only calculating the number of image gradients whose amplitude is non-zero while ignoring penalty for the large ones [30]. Recently, relative total variation (RTV) [31] was proposed to extract main structures from complicated texture patterns. Unlike L0-norm and L1-norm, RTV is defined in terms of the differences between the partial derivatives of textures and structures in an image. Window inherent variation (WIV) and window total variation\n(WTV) are, respectively, defined as denominator and numerator of RTV. The main structures in images stand out according to the definition of WIV, which could easily distinguish structures and the textures. For WIV, the partial derivatives of textures and noise in a local window tend to cancel each other out. However, both textures and noise contribute to the value of WTV. As a consequence, the textures and noise can be removed by penalizing RTV. In [32], Gong et\u00a0al. proposed RTV-regularized projections onto convex set (POCS-RTV) reconstruction model. Based on this model, they used L-curve method to set parameters in POCS-RTV, called adaptive POCS-RTV (POCSARTV). This model is able to reduce noise by penalizing RTV term.\nIn this work, we aim to take advantages of prior knowledge in gradient domain to enhance the quality of LDCT. Even though experimental results in [32] show a satisfactory performance on low-intensity CT reconstruction, we observed that POCS-RTV tends to cause fuzzy edges and details in reconstructed results especially for extremely LDCT. We consider this phenomenon is related to the weighting function of RTV, because the weight is only based on distance between pixels, ignoring the importance of image gray-scale values. We draw lessons from the thought of bilateral filtering [33, 34] to propose the bilateral weighted relative total variation (BRTV). Spatial proximity and pixel value similarity are utilized as the weighting function of WIV. Two close and similar pixels make more contributions to the partial derivative in WIV so that a smaller BRTV could be acquired, which could suppress noise while preserve sharp edges and fine details at the same time. Structures, textures, and noise contribute to the value of WTV. Therefore, weights of WTV are set as the original ones in RTV.\nInspired by [33, 34], we first propose BRTV to simultaneously maintain edges and further reduce noise for image restoration, then propose the BRTV-regularized projections onto convex set (POCS-BRTV) model for LDCT reconstruction. Being different from POCS-RTV, the weights of WIV in POCS-BRTV rely on both the closeness to vicinity in the domain and similarity to vicinity in the range, which could better characterize the distance and difference between two pixels. Especially for LDCT, textures and edges are severely degraded by extremely high level noise. It is easy to confuse textures and noise when reconstruction models based on image sparsity in the gradient domain are used to tackle the LDCT images. POCS-BRTV shows outstanding performance on getting sharper edges as well as distinguishing fine details and noise for LDCT reconstruction. The main contributions of this work are threefold. Firstly, we develop an image restoration model, BRTV, based on proximity and similarity between two pixels in a local rectangular. Secondly, BRTV is utilized as the regularization term for LDCT\n1 3\nreconstruction model. Penalizing BRTV term can suppress noise and preserve main structures. Finally, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve POCS-BRTV model.\nThis paper is structurally organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly introduce LDCT imaging model and RTV. In the third section, the proposed algorithm is presented, after which the experimental results of the simulated data are described. The conclusion of this study is given in the final section."

In ideal circumstances, CT projection data is noise-free so that the reconstructed images can be obtained according to the inverse of projection matrix if there is enough computer memory available. As a matter of fact, LDCT cannot be directly reconstructed due to the limitation of the computer memory for problem dimension and the degradation by noise.

Experiments show a satisfactory performance on low-intensity CT reconstruction, while we observed that this model tends to cause fuzzy edges and textures in reconstructed results especially for extremely LDCT.
