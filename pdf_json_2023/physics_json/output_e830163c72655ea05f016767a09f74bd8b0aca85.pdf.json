    "abstractText": "The access to P-stereogenic motifs has always been considered a very challenging and high attractive mission in modern organic synthesis. While several chiral auxiliaries employed by the practical Jug\u00e9-Stephan-like methodology have been developed, new type of readily accessible bifunctional ligands toward P-stereogenic building still remain much desirable. Herein, we present a powerful chiral template, camphor-derived 2,3-diols named CAMDOL, which were designed and synthesized from the commercially cheap camphorquinone in high yields at 50 grams scale with a column-free purification. Diverse P(III)-chiral compounds and their borane forms including phosphinous acids, phosphinites, and phosphines, as well as the corresponding P(V)-chiral compounds including phosphinates, phosphine oxides, phosphinothioates, phosphine sulfides, and secondary phosphine oxides were afforded in high yields and ee values through the optimal 2,3-diphenyl CAMDOL platform. An unusual C3-OP bond cleavage following the first P-OC2 bond breaking was observed during the ring-opening process when quenching by NH4Cl solution, which generates a unique but valuable camphorepoxide scaffold as by-product. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00935-0 OPEN",

P-stereogenic compounds feature many peculiar properties, allowing their use in various fields of applications ranging from medicine discovery, material science, to asymmetric catalysis3\u20135. Various P(III)-stereogenic ligands such as the monodentate and bidentate chiral phosphines have proved to be the cornerstone of countless catalytic reactions5\u20139, while numerous P(V)-stereogenic compounds such as the new-emerging antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics and the COVID-19 pandemic drug Remdesivir display versatile interesting biological properties10,11. Therefore, the development of new asymmetric routes to these molecules is crucial to sustain the fast-growing demands for novel chirality-at-phosphorus scaffolds.\nFor a long time, the asymmetric synthesis of P-chiral compounds has relied heavily on the resolution of racemates until the establishment of the so-called Jug\u00e9-Stephan methodology based on the nucleophilic ring-opening of ephedrine-derived borane oxazaphospholidines in a SN2@P process with organolithium reagents12. However, one of the disadvantages of the practical Jug\u00e9-Stephan methodology is that ephedrine is a key precursor of the psychotic substance methamphetamine and tightly controlled, thus not amenable for scale-up activities. Therefore, the design of readily accessible and universal chiral auxiliaries with programmable connecting and leaving groups for their installation and detachment on P-atom remains highly desirable and utmostly important in the field of P-asymmetry chemistry.\nIndeed, several types of heterobifunctional chiral pools have been developed in the past decades, including the aminoalcohols such as Juge\u2019s ephedrine13, Verdaguer\u2019s aminoindanol14, Andrioletti\u2019s 1,2-aminocyclohexanol15, Framery\u2019s glucosamine16, Kang\u2019s pyrrolidinemethanol17, and Han\u2019s 2-(1-aminoethyl)-4chlorophenol18, and the thiol-alcohols such as Corey\u2019s camphor thiol19 and the latest Baran\u2019s limonene-derived thiol (Fig. 1)20. However most of these chiral pools are still sufferring from lowavailability, high-costage, multi-step synthetic sequences, and scale-up difficulty, and more importantly the effective installation and controllable transformation of the chiral information on the stable P(III) and/or P(V) centers still remain very challenging today.\nOn the other hand, chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) organocatalysts derived from homobifunctional diols such as BINOL, TADDOL, VAPOL, SPANOL, have been utilized extensively over the last thirty years21. However few reliable stereocontrol examples about these diols toward P-stereogenic building have been reported mainly due to that their two hydroxyl groups are actually identical, which makes it too difficult to proceed stereocontrollable transformations. But very recently, synthesis of\nP-chiral compounds via a kind of axis-to-center strategy by transferring the axial chirality of diols to central chirality located at phosphorus came into feasible. Two typical successful cases involving BINOL have been achieved. In 2020, Murai firstly reported the synthesis of P-chiral phosphonothioates and phosphonates by a two-step alcoholysis of binaphthyl phosphonothioates(Fig. 2b)22,23; then in 2021, Feringa reported the synthesis of P-chiral phosphine oxides by Pd-catalyzed arylation of phosphoramidites in presence of Cs2CO3 (Fig. 2a)24. Unfortunately, the above approaches are not enough efficient and compatible such as demanding acid-catalyzed methanolysis to pre-cleavage the unreactive P\u2013N bond, or unsatisfactory stereoselectivity and very limited scope with only few examples. Moreover, the main drawback of the current diol-based strategy is that they are not amenable for the synthesis of structure e-diverse P(III)-chiral compounds and the conversions into the P(V)molecules. Therefore, the development of a new type of diol-type template reagents capable of achieving both introduction and conversion of the P(III)- and/or P(V)-stereogenic centers with robust stereoselectivity remains high valuable in present.\nWhen opting for an inventive chiral pool fulfilled the above requirements, we recently focused on the camphor-related diols which are rarely interested and explored before in organophosphorus synthesis. As one of the nature\u2019s privileged scaffolds readily available in both enantiomeric forms, camphor undergoes a wide variety of chemical transformations, thus enabling the preparation of structurally and functionally diverse products25. However, the vast majority of the camphor-derived catalysts in present are frameworks connected to a chiral functionality such as pyrrolidine, taking the camphor skeleton only as the subsidiary part. But a recent interesting report by Huseyinov26 about the application of organophosphorus acid from camphor 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-diol in Hantzsch reaction inspired us to develop a kind of new chiral pool of camphor-type diols. In theory, the commercially available inexpensive camphorquinone can react with two equivalent organolithiums to afford the corresponding camphor 2,3-diols, thus enough hindrances may be achieved if introducing two bulky endo 2,3-disubstituted groups onto the camphor backbone. To our best knowledge, no such camphor 2,3-diols were full investigated and used by the axis-to-center methodology before. Herein, we present an exceptional camphor 2,3-diols template to realize divergent stereoselective synthesis of phosphinous acid boranes which can be subsequently converted into the various P(III)- and P(V)-chiral compounds via known methods (Fig. 2c)."

We firstly took the (-)-camphorquinone as the starting material to test our idea. As expected, (-)-camphorquinone was found to react smoothly with Grignard reagents or organolithium reagents via an endo-specifically nucleophilic addition, giving the target 2,3-substituted diols including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, dibenzyl, and diphenyl 2,3-diols (Fig. 3).

With the chiral pool of CAMDOL in hand, we then investigated their feasibility in P-stereogenic building. Considering that CAMDOL 1e, possessing the highest steric effect, so we firstly examined the phosphorylation of 1e by POCl3 and phosphitylation of 1e by PCl3. Very surprisingly, no reaction between 1e and POCl3 was observed even after refluxing 12 h in THF, whereas when stirring 1e with PCl3 by 30 min at 0 oC in presence of Et3N, the backbone of 1e was then found completely anchored to P(III)-atom forming a chloro dioxaphospholidine motif 2a as desired. Compared with POCl3, PCl3 is relatively more reactive and less bulky, which may contribute to the above distinguished behaviour when introducing P-atom onto the CAMDOL\u2019s tertiary hydroxyl groups, similar to that of TADDOL\u2019s reactions27.\nThe commercially available MePCl2 and PhPCl2 gave 2b and 2c under the similar conditions. Encouragingly, the directly unavailable P(V) phosphorochloridates and phosphonates could be obtained effectively from the crude P(III)-intermediates by H2O2 oxidation in an one-pot procedure. By this manner, P(V)compounds 3b-c were synthesized from CAMDOL 1e, while the unstable P(III)-compounds 2a-c and P(V)-compound 3a were generally used as crude in the following reactions (Fig. 4).\nNext, we took the P*-synthon 3c to test the ring opening reaction with typical organometallic reagents. To our surprise, the second P\u2013O bond cleavage never took place even with excess of MeLi at refluxing temperature, although the first P-O bond cleavage occurred very quickly. However, when quenching the mixture by saturated NH4Cl solution, a racemic PhMeP(O)OH accompanied with an unanticipated camphor-epoxide were isolated (Fig. 5), which indicates that the reaction probably underwent with an unusual intramolecular cyclization process similar to the Baran\u2019s \u03a0-reagent28. The detaching order of the two P\u2013O bonds will be discussed in the following proposed reaction mechanism.\nIt should be pointed out that the camphor-epoxide would always crystallize out from the concentrated aqueous mixture at the end, and could be recovered in 88% yield. The unique byproduct camphor-epoxide was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and single crystal X-ray analysis. The X-ray spectra demonstrates that a clear hydrogen-bond interaction forms between the epoxide oxygen and C-8 hydrogen in the epoxide scaffold.\nObviously, the above experiment suggests that it\u2019s not accessible to achieve P-chirality since the two oxygen atoms of\nP=O and P\u2013OH in the product are not discriminal. But looking from another perspective, we speculated that diastereoselectivity should be realized if introducing an unequivalent atom, such as borane or sulfur, to replace the oxygen of P=O group. The much more attractive P(III)-BH3 were preferred, as surrogates of airsensitive P(III) compounds, mainly due to their easy handling, purification and transformation29\u201332. More importantly, the P(III) phosphinous acids, products after deprotection of BH3, are able to tautomerise to the P(V) secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) which are high valuable compounds with a huge potential in asymmetric synthesis, catalysis and coordination chemistry33\u201336. The advantages of new-emerging P-chiral SPOs over the most often used phosphine ligands are threefold: air and moisture stability, supramolecular bidentate formation, and bifunctional ligands activity. However, only a few efficient examples are known so far. The most practical approach employed for SPOs was a multi-step procedure starting from the diastereomerically enriched menthyl H-phosphinate precursors, which however normally need twice recrystallization manipulations at low temperature, unfortunately always in very low yields37,38. More general and competitive enantioselective methodology toward SPOs still remain a very challenging topic now.\nInspired by the above idea, we then examined the Jug\u00e9-Stephan type reaction of the camphor-derived P*-phospholidine boranes 4ca-ce prepared conveniently by BH3/SMe2 in high yields. As shown in Table 1, 4ce could be converted into 5aa in 70% ee at room temperature by the smallest Grignard reagent MeMgBr (1 mmol/L) in THF (Table 1, Entry 5), whereas 4ca-cd gave relatively lower enantioselectivities (Table 1, Entries 1\u20134). Better results could be obtained at lower temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C (Table 1, Entries 6\u20138), but leading to prolonged reaction time and declined yield (Table 1, Entry 9). Screening of solvents demonstrated that toluene seemed to be the best choice (Table 1, Entries 10\u201315), giving 5aa in 86% yield and 90% ee (Table 1, Entry 13). Encouragingly, when improving the mixture concentration from 0.067 mmol/L to 0.133 mmol/L by using 2.5 eq. MeMgBr and half toluene solvent, the reaction proceeded with 92% ee (Table 1, Entry 16). Further reducing MeMgBr to 1.5 eq., up to 97% ee was afforded with 86% isolated yield of 5aa (Table 1, Entry 17). Nevertheless, 1.1 eq. MeMgBr would give slightly diminished yield and ee value as well as longer reaction time (Table 1, Entry 18).\nHaving established the optimized conditions (Table 1, Entry 17), the scope of P-chiral phosphinous acid boranes 5a was explored (Fig. 6). A wide array of primary alkyl, cycloalkyl, and alkenyl Grignard reagents were well tolerated in this process, providing the corresponding products 5aa-5ah in 80\u201392% yields and 90\u201397% ee values. But the alkynyl and aryl Grignard reagents only gave products 5ai-5ak with moderate yields and\nphosphonates. X-ray spectra: see Supplementary Data 3.\n4 COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:133 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00935-0 | www.nature.com/commschem\nenantioselectivities. More bulky secondary and tertiary alkyl, as well as ortho-substituted aryl Grignard reagents were all found not applicable in this way, possibly due to the low reactivity of magnesium reagents compared with lithium reagents, which was proved in our following test.\nTo our delight, excellent yields and stereoselectivities were both performed as expected when employing the organolithium reagents in place of organomagnesium reagents (Fig. 7). Both\nbulky secondary and tertiary alkyl lithium proceeded smoothly and gave the wanted products 5ba and 5bb in 97% and 93% ee respectively, which were unavailable by the Grignard reagents. Aryl lithium with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents at different positions were all compatible, affording products 5bc-5bk with 95% to 99% ee values. The condensed and hetero aromatic lithium reagents proceeded almost enantiospecifically, giving the products 5bl, 5bm, 5bn, and 5bo with 99% ee values. The absolute configuration of 5bo was further determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.\nThe reaction between the lest bulky methyl dioxaphospholidine borane 4be and ortho-methoxylphenyl lithium also gained product 5 bp with 97% ee value, but for the less-bulky meta/ para-methoxyl phenyl lithium reagents, lower enantioselectivities of 82% and 65% ee were obtained for products 5bq and 5br. The distinct differences of steric effects between phenyl and methyl groups on the P-center, as well as the steric shielding from different positions (ortho, meta, and para) at the aromatic ring, should contribute mainly to the above enantioselective alterations.\nWith respect to that most of the alkyl/aryl phosphonodichlorides (RPCl2) are not commercially available, we then turned to further explore the universality and practicability of CAMDOL by using 2-chloro 1,3,2-dioxaphospholidine borane 4ae as the starting material. Some bulky groups which are not included in Fig. 7 but potentially emerged in P-asymmetry motifs were selected. As shown in Fig. 8, phosphinous acid boranes compound 5ca with ethyenyl and biphenyl, compound 5cb with cyclohexyl and naphthyl, and compound 5cc with 4-fluorophenyl and 2-ethenylphenyl attached on P-atom were thus obtained in 96%, 97%, and 98% ee values respectively.\nIt is interesting to note that, stereodivergent preparation of both enantiomers of the P-stereogenic molecules (RP)-5bo and (SP)-5bo were easily achieved in very close yields and the same 99% ee values with CAMDOL only by using the (+)- or (-)- camphorquinone enantiomeric forms as the starting materials respectively (Fig. 9).\nAlternatively, according to the Jug\u00e9\u2019s strategy12, the stereoselective formation and flexibility of P-stereogenic centre were also easily afforded simply by switching the sequence of organomagnesium additions, providing either (Sp)-5aa or (Rp)5aa with equally minimal effort (Fig. 10).\nStereoretentive P*-transformations of phosphinic acid boranes. With enantiopure phosphinic acid boranes in hand, our search for their derivation reactions toward synthesis of notable P(III)-chiral ligands commenced. After 10 mmol scale preparation, compound 5bf was firstly converted into PAMP-BH3 via Omethylation39,40 by TMSCH2N2 (firstly attempt by MeI but failed) and then nucleophilic substitution by MeLi. The following deprotection of BH3 by DABCO afforded the well-known P(III)ligand PAMP in 74% total yield without compromising distinct stereochemical integrity (Fig. 11).\nThen, we carried out exploration of the scope toward various kinds of P(III)- and P(V)-chiral compounds. Figure 12 illustrates the scope and sequence of CAMDOL-enabled synthesis of some selected P-chirogenic compounds. The O-methylation of phosphinous acid boranes 5bi and 5bo with TMSCH2N2 gave the corresponding homochiral phosphinite boranes intermediates 6ab in quantitative yields as an excellent starting point for the next preparation of diverse P-chiral molecules. Compounds 6a-b were able to be transformed into phosphinates 7a-b and phosphinothioates 8a-b respectively with 98\u201399% P-chirality retention when treated by DABCO and then m-CPBA, or by DABCO and then elemental sulfur at 50 \u00b0C in THF. Compound 6b could also\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:133 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00935-0 | www.nature.com/commschem 5\nbe converted into phosphine 9b with 96% P-chirality inversion when treated by lithium reagents at \u221230 \u00b0C and then DABCO at 50 \u00b0C in THF. Compound 9b then was transformed into phosphine oxide 10b or phosphine sulfide 11b respectively without any P-chirality loss under the same conditions. All the above reactions gave very high to quantitative yields of the desired products.\nMoreover, the deboronation reaction of phosphinous acid boranes was also examined by the known HBF4-mediated method41 to afford the P-chiral SPOs. Compounds 12a-d were thus successfully synthesized with 95-98% enantioselectivities reserved (Fig. 13). Compared with the conventional cumbersome menthol-based methodology, our CAMDOL-enabled access to SPOs possess several extinct advantages such as higher overall output, better substrates scopes and easier experimental handling, thus can be potentially used as a general protocol for synthesis of diverse SPOs in the further. Plausible reaction mechanism. It\u2019s undoubtable that two pseudohomobifunctional OH groups in CAMDOL are not really sterically identical, especially in the ring-opening process. However, the only difference between them is the C10-methyl group. Therefore, based on the above reaction results observed, the CAMDOL-involved Jug\u00e9-Stephan-like transformation possibly proceeds in the following way. The organomental reagent prefers to attack the frontside C2-hydroxyl P-O bond rather than the backside C3-hydroxyl P-O bond probably due to the C10hydrogen bond chelating with RM to form a kind of stabilized six-membered ring. Under the mild acidic conditions with NH4Cl solution, the C3-OP bond undergoes a heterolytic cleavage leading to the formation of P-chirality retented phosphinous acid product and the stabilized tertiary benzylic carbocation Int_CAM. The following intramolecular SN1 nucleophilic attack of C2-hydroxyl group at C3-carbocation of Int_CAM then leads to the formation of camphor-epoxide (Fig. 14).\nPh P OH\nBH3\n5ba 84%; 97% ee\nPh P OH\nBH3\n5bb 89%; 93% ee\nPh P OH\nBH3\n5bc 93%; 97% ee\nPh P OH\nBH3\n5bd 93%; 98% ee\nO\nPh Ph\nO P\nR BH3 1.
