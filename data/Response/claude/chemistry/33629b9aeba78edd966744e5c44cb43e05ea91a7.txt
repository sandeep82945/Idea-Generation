 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different preparation methods on the photocatalytic activity and stability of g-C3N4. The thermal polymerization method was used in this study, but other methods like solvothermal or microwave synthesis could produce g-C3N4 with different properties.

2. Test the synergistic photocatalytic systems on a wider range of organic pollutants beyond dyes, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, etc. This could reveal new insights into the degradation mechanisms.

3. Explore modifications or composites of g-C3N4 to extend light absorption into the visible range or improve charge separation. Doping with metals or coupling with other semiconductors are possible directions.

4. Evaluate the synergistic systems at pilot or large scales to assess real-world feasibility and process optimization needs before potential commercialization. Factors like catalyst reuse and process economics should be examined.

5. Investigate the effect of solution parameters like pH, temperature, water matrix, etc. on the proposed synergistic systems in more depth. This could lead to understanding the contrasting behaviors between cationic and anionic dyes that was observed.
