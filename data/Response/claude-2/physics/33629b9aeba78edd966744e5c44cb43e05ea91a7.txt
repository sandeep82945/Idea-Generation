 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Investigate the effect of varying the concentration of g-C3N4 on the photocatalytic degradation rate of dyes. The amount of photocatalyst used likely impacts the reaction kinetics.

2. Test the synergistic systems on other types of organic pollutants beyond dyes, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, etc. This could reveal broader applications for the photocatalytic systems.  

3. Modify the structure or composition of g-C3N4, such as by doping it with metals or non-metals, to tune its optical and electronic properties. This could potentially enhance light absorption or charge separation.

4. Evaluate the performance of other oxidants, such as peroxymonosulfate, periodate, etc. in place of H2O2 and Na2S2O8. Other oxidants may interact differently and produce alternate reactive radicals.

5. Conduct mechanistic studies to further elucidate the roles of various reactive oxygen species in degrading the anionic versus cationic dyes. Kinetic and spectroscopic experiments could provide insight into the reaction mechanisms.
