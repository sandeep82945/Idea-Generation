"Currently, FTIR research on the molecular structures of different coal ranks is mainly focused on high-temperature pyrolysis [34,35], but the low-temperature pyrolysis of medium-rank coal is rarely researched [32,36â€“38]. Meanwhile, exploring the evolution of pyrolysis molecular structure can be helpful in optimizing the comprehensive utilization direction of coal, such as dry distillation, gasification, and liquefaction [39,40]."
