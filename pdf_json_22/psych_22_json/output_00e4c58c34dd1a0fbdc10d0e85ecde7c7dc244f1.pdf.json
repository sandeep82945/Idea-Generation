Hence, it is crucial to understand how customers would respond in the event of service failures when the service performance falls below their expectations (Ozuem et\u00a0al., 2021).\nConsumer experience is influenced by a series of complicated psychological and brain responses (Balconi et\u00a0al., 2021). As an inevitable yet influential phenomenon in the service context (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2021), understanding the mechanism through which consumers cope is crucial for the service provider. When service failure occurs, customers experience disconfirmation (Smith et\u00a0 al., 1999; Ho et\u00a0 al., 2020), which triggers an internalizing coping process to mitigate the stress associated with the negative experience (Sengupta et\u00a0al., 2015; Tan et\u00a0al., 2021). The common strategies include avoidance, support-seeking, and forgiveness (Yagil and Luria, 2016; Muhammad and Gul-E-Rana, 2020). Most existing studies focus on avoidance and support-seeking, while customer forgiveness received less attention. Recently Sarofim et al. (2022) investigated how religiosity affects customer forgiveness and found that religiosity corresponded with higher levels of belief-in-fate, leading to lower customer dissatisfaction and higher customer forgiveness. Customer forgiveness is a deliberate and controllable process during which customers reduce their anger and forswear the intention to revenge. While some studies argued that the customer\u2013firm or customer\u2013brand relationship is a crucial antecedent of forgiveness (e.g., Balaji et\u00a0al., 2016; Tan et\u00a0al., 2021), there is no consensus on how such a relationship would affect forgiveness.\nAdditionally, as service competition intensifies, service providers build up switching barriers such as relational benefits or switching costs to maintain customer relationships characterized by customers\u2019 psychological or behavioral dependence (Al-hawari, 2014). The importance of dependence in the B2C customer\u2013firm context has rarely been studied, especially in its linkage with customer forgiveness (Yagil and Luria, 2016; Najafi-Tavani et al., 2020). To address such research gaps, we\u00a0examine how customerperceived dependence affects forgiveness through different causal attributions in the face of service failure, moderated by the longevity of their relationship with the firm.\nOur findings suggest that relationship-value dependence (RVD) is more likely to trigger external attribution that positively leads to forgiveness, whereas switching-cost dependence (SCD) triggers internal attribution that negatively impacts forgiveness. Overall, the effect of dependence on forgiveness is negatively moderated by the length of the relationship and through the mediating mechanism of causal attributions. Specifically, customers with a value-based dependence will act less willing to forgive when facing a longterm relationship, while customers in a cost-restricted dependence relationship will be\u00a0 more tolerant to give forgiveness after a service failure.\nOur study contributes to the service recovery and relationship management literature. First, we\u00a0elucidate the underlying process\nof forgiveness with the presence of the customer\u2013firm dependence relationship. Second, our study promotes the theoretical understanding of dependence by discriminating the relationship-value dependence (RVD) along with switching-cost dependence (SCD). Finally, we\u00a0contribute to the service literature by bridging the research gap between post-transgression reactions and causal attribution processes grounded in relationship contextual factors.\nTheoretical underpinning and literature review\nCustomer forgiveness in service failure\nCustomer forgiveness is often defined as a process to reduce anger, the willingness to foreswear revenge and the enhancement of compassion and generosity to the involved service provider after a service failure. Prior studies have supported its multidimensional structure with cognitive, affective and behavioral components (Tsarenko and Tojib, 2011; Muhammad and Gul-ERana, 2020; Kravchuk, 2021) and mainly focus on trust, satisfaction, word of mouth, and behavioral intention, meanwhile overlooking forgiveness as a positive response to the service provider (Honora et\u00a0al., 2022). A large body of research on forgiveness has examined its configuration and determinants. Finkel et\u00a0 al. (2002) suggest the mental state factors of the forgiving party and the ongoing relationship features in which forgiveness occurs are the two vital elements determining forgiveness. Tendencies of revenge decrease when a greater value is placed on the relationships (Zechmeister et\u00a0al., 2004). The forgiveness process will be\u00a0 influenced by situational or contextual factors, such as contingent factors considered in the causal attribution, characteristics of the relationship between customer and service provider (Tsarenko and Tojib, 2012; Riaz et\u00a0 al., 2016; Muhammad and Gul-E-Rana, 2020; Kravchuk, 2021; Yang and Hu, 2021). For example, customers tend to forgive a service failure due to unforeseen, irresistible factors beyond the service provider\u2019s control (Nikbin et\u00a0al., 2016). They are also likely to forgive a service failure with timely and appropriate remedial measures (Siu et\u00a0al., 2013). In addition, the service provider\u2019s integrity, competence, benevolence and awe can lead to customer forgiveness and repair the trust (Xie and Peng, 2009; Yang and Hu, 2021). However, empirical findings on how relationship characteristics moderate forgiveness in service failure are inconsistent. Some studies suggest that the friendliness of relationships and psychological resilience of customer has a positive association with forgiveness (Yagil and Luria, 2016; Kravchuk, 2021), while others find the results to be\u00a0insignificant or even opposite (Wan et\u00a0al., 2011; Wang and Wu, 2012; Muhammad and Gul-E-Rana, 2020). The conflicting findings reinforce the importance of an integrative conceptual framework in identifying the boundary conditions that govern customers\u2019 forgiveness of service failure.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org"

            "heading": "Attribution theory",
            "text": "Attribution theory is a widely applied social cognition theory to explain customers\u2019 thinking and acting processes in marketing filed (Fu et\u00a0al., 2021). When customers encounter a service failure, they will look for the underlying cause and experience specific emotions, attitudes, or behavior to the service provider. According to the attribution theory, locus, stability, and controllability are the critical constructs of causal attribution (Hess, 2008). In a service failure context, locus refers to whether the cause of failure results from the service provider or customers themselves; stability indicates whether the failure is comparatively enduring or relatively temporary; and controllability is associated with whether the cause of failure is within the firm\u2019s control (Folkes, 1984; Weiner, 2000). Consumers\u2019 causal attribution direction impacts their overall evaluation of the service (Van Raaij and Pruyn, 1998) as well as their reasoning styles (Yoon, 2013). They will consider the attribution of the locus as a primary concern and then attribute stability and controllability accordingly. Thus, in our study, we\u00a0 focus on the attribution of locus and investigate two attribution conditionsinternal and external attributions. External attribution attributes the service failure to be\u00a0at fault of the service provider, while internal attribution attributes the service failure to be\u00a0out of control of the service provider. Different from prior studies that examine external and internal locus between the service provider and customer, we\u00a0 form a dichotomy from the relationship management perspective focusing on the role of the offending party, considering only if the cause is located on the side of the service provider or not.\nExtant literature has shown that different attributions will influence customers\u2019 emotions, evaluations, attitudes and behaviors toward the service firm (Nikbin et\u00a0al., 2016; Fu et\u00a0al., 2021). For instance, customers are more likely to show negative responses, such as anger, dissatisfaction, avoidance, revenge, or switching behaviors, when they perceive the failure to be\u00a0enduring or the firm with the ability to control but failed to do so (Fu et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, they are more likely to forgive when perceiving the cause of service failure as something out of the service provider\u2019s hand (Nikbin et\u00a0al., 2016; Su et\u00a0al., 2020). Literature has also found the causal attribution intentions associated with contextual elements such as failure types, failure severity, previous service experience, customer knowledge, customer expectation, relationship quality, relationship types and so on (Chen and Huang, 2015; Yagil and Luria, 2016; Su et\u00a0al., 2020; Fu et\u00a0al., 2021)."

            "text": "Dependence is key to establishing a long-term relationship (Waheed and Gaur, 2012) and for the relationship to yield desirable outcomes (Sung and Choi, 2010). It emphasizes a customer\u2019s need to maintain a relationship for achieving his or her desired goals (Drigotas and Rusbult, 1992; Scheer et\u00a0al., 2015). In relationship marketing literature, dependence, trust and commitment are the determinant variables for establishing a\nlong-term relationship (Waheed and Gaur, 2012). In the service context, customer trust reflects the belief that customers consider the service provider will not break its promise. Commitment is described as the enduring desire to maintain a valued relationship in order to obtain greater benefits in the future (Waheed and Gaur, 2012). While both trust and commitment reflect a customer\u2019s active intent to build a relationship and the confidence to receive positive outcomes from that relationship, dependence on the other hand emphasizes a customer\u2019s need to retain a relationship with a specific supplier to gain access to particular resources (NajafiTavani et\u00a0 al., 2020). Dependence typically arises from the irreplaceable resource customer cannot abandon or the difficulty in accessing alternate outcomes (Balaji et\u00a0 al., 2016). When customers are relatively dependent on their service providers, they are more likely to use outcome-based criteria to evaluate services, in which rational context trust and commitment may have less impact on their subsequent behaviors (Najafi-Tavani et\u00a0al., 2020).\nRelationship literature asserts that customers and service providers strengthen their existing connections through relationship investment in each service encounters (Balaji et\u00a0al., 2016). Relationship investment not only offers customers additional benefits and value, but also produces barriers or costs for customers\u2019 switching behavior (Al-hawari, 2014; Pick and Eisend, 2014). Based on motivation theory, relationship benefit and switching cost are the two crucial elements for a person-firm relationship, and furthermore drive the positive or negative motivation of customers to establish and maintain their business relationship with the service provider (Scheer et\u00a0al., 2010). Thus, the nature of dependence customers perceived can be\u00a0based on positive motivation due to the inherent benefits or based on negative motivation such as switching costs (Scheer et\u00a0al., 2010; Najafi-Tavani et\u00a0al., 2020). Following Scheer et\u00a0al. (2010), our research adopts their decomposition of the overall customerperceived dependence into two components, namely the relationship-value dependence (RVD) and switching-cost dependence (SCD). The former concerns a customer\u2019s need to maintain a relationship with a service provider due to the unique value or irreplaceable benefits associated with its core offering or operations capability. The latter refers to the need to maintain a relationship due to the dormant costs incurred upon relationship termination. These two dependence components give expressions to the distinguishable sides of a customer\u2019s motivational investment, and they can exist at the same time. Examples of RVD operationalizations include individual customized services, loyalty rewards, preferential treatments like receiving price discounts, faster or additional service, and emotional attachment with the service provider; while examples of SCD operationalizations include pre-investment loss, or anticipated costs of searching, selecting, evaluating, soliciting or transiting to a new alternative (Scheer et\u00a0al., 2010, 2015). In sum, RVD incarnates the positive motivation to continue the present relationship to obtain relational benefits, whereas SCD is associated with the negative motivation to maintain a relationship due to obstructive barriers that would incur at relationship termination.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nIn addition, most dependence studies focus on the organizational-level factors from a B2B perspective, including the degree and symmetry of dependence and their impact on subsequent factors (e.g., performance). However, dependence is also common and important in the B2C context. The formation mechanism of the dependence relationship will significantly affect customers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors toward the service provider, but few researchers pay attention to it. Our paper is among the first attempts that studies the distinctiveness of dependence from B2C customers\u2019 perspective, as well as explores its impacts on customer forgiveness from the attribution perspective when they encounter a service failure."

            "text": "Causal attribution and customer forgiveness\nExtensive studies show that different attributions of service failure will influence customers\u2019 emotions, evaluations, attitudes, and behaviors toward the firms (Nikbin et\u00a0al., 2016; Su et\u00a0al., 2020; Fu et\u00a0al., 2021). Customers are more likely to forgive when they perceive the cause of a service failure to be\u00a0something out of a service provider\u2019s hands (Su et\u00a0al., 2020). When they feel the cause is ambiguous or beyond the service provider\u2019s control, the negative emotions or responses will also be\u00a0mitigated (Choi and Mattila, 2008; Fu et\u00a0al., 2021). Conversely, when customers make the fault attribution toward firm\u2019s factors like employees, service ability, service system, etc., they are more likely to show negative responses, such as anger, dissatisfaction, avoidance, revenge, or switching behaviors (Nikbin et\u00a0al., 2016). Moreover, customers react more negatively when they believe the service firm can prevent the failure but fails to do so (Yagil and Luria, 2016). Therefore, we\u00a0propose:\nH1: External attribution is positively related to customer forgiveness.\nH2: Internal attribution is negatively related to customer forgiveness.\nCustomer-perceived dependence and causal attribution\nRVD and SCD correspond with two distinct types of customer motivational investment. The two types of dependence can be\u00a0simultaneously high and low, or one dominates the other. RVD incarnates positive motivation to continue the present relationship for obtaining relational benefits, whereas SCD is associated with negative motivation to maintain a relationship due to obstructive barriers that would incur at relationship termination (Scheer et\u00a0al., 2015).\nCausal attribution is an important antecedent for customer forgiveness, expectation, and relationship quality (e.g., Chen and Huang, 2015; Su et\u00a0al., 2020). In the customer\u2013firm relationship context, customers with RVD can be\u00a0regarded as owning high expectations due to the irreplaceable unique benefits received in past business encounters (Scheer et\u00a0al., 2010, 2015). The higher the expectations, the more inconsistent the service failure seems to be\u00a0with their previously held beliefs. Consequently, customers will tend to make causal attributions that align with their prior beliefs to resolve the dissonance caused by the service failure experience (Fu et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, we\u00a0posit that RVD and SCD would lead to differential causal attributions to affect customer forgiveness further:\nH3: Relationship-value dependence is positively related to external attribution.\nIn contrast, customers with SCD may not necessarily hold high expectations but aim to avoid implicit costs when they remain in the relationship with the service provider (Scheer et\u00a0al., 2010, 2015). Power imbalance exists in an exchange relation when there is the potential for exploitation. It determines the magnitude of dependence and affects social structures by causing inequalities between the two parties in an exchange relation (Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005; Najafi-Tavani et\u00a0al., 2020). The higher the power imbalance, the higher inequalities in a social relation, and hence the higher ability and responsibility of the \u201csuperior\u201d party. SCD, a dependence relationship resulting from a customer\u2019s passive choice, implies that he\u00a0or she perceives the service provider of power and capability and therefore holds them more responsible for the whole service process (Len et\u00a0al., 2006; Najafi-Tavani et\u00a0al., 2020). Thus, we\u00a0hypothesize:\nH4: Switching-cost dependence is positively related to internal attribution.\nThe moderating role of relationship length\nRelationship length refers to how long the customer had been dealing business with the service provider (Hui et\u00a0al., 2011; Wang et\u00a0al., 2021). Previous studies on relationship length show that new customers differ from those who have long been clients of their company (old customers). For instance, Coulter and Coulter (2002) find that the effect of offer-related service characteristics on trust increases as the relationship continues; however, the effect of \u201cperson-related\u201d service characteristics diminishes over time. Similarly, Kumar et\u00a0al. (2003) argue that relationship length does not always enhance the relationship or emotional attachments customers choose to have with their service providers. Chiao et\u00a0al. (2008) distinguish relationship orientations and suggest that relationship length has a significant moderating role on the impact of satisfaction and trust on customer loyalty. Wang et\u00a0al. (2021)\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nfind that the longer the relationship length is, the higher of optimal customer participation level with customer satisfaction and affective commitment.\nService relationship evolves with service encounters. At the early stages of a service relationship, when customers often have limited information or experience with the service offering and provider, prior relationships have pronounced effects in the attribution process to influence forgiveness. As the relationship ages, customers gain more information and become more knowledgeable about the service offering and the company, increasing the trust and reducing the perceived risk of their relationship with the service provider (Dagger and O\u2019Brien, 2010; Wang et\u00a0al., 2021). Accordingly, we\u00a0propose:\nH5: As the length of the relationship increases, the effect of RVD on external attribution decreases.\nH6: As the length of the relationship increases, the effect of SCD on internal attribution decreases.\nTherefore, we\u00a0 propose the following conceptual model to reveal the underlying mechanism from customer-perceived dependence to forgiveness after service failure occurs, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01."

Study 1 is an experiment with the scenario stimulus method, which is useful to investigate complex concepts (such as customerperceived dependence) that are not easily operationalized in the\nreal world (Eroglu, 1987).

We\u00a0apply the quantitative survey method in study 2, which can help to identify the meanings and the relationships among all variables and develop a validated framework and theoretical contribution (Saunders et\u00a0al., 2009).

In the current study, we\u00a0 investigate the underlying relationship between customerperceived dependence, causal attribution, and customer forgiveness, as well as the moderating effect of relationship longevity. Our results show an indirect effect of the dependence relationship on customer forgiveness through differential attribution paths. Specifically, relationship-value dependence (RVD), rooted in ongoing net benefits, is more likely to trigger external attribution that positively leads to forgiveness. In contrast, switching-cost dependence (SCD) rooted in latent cost is related to internal attribution that negatively impacts forgiveness. Furthermore, the relationship between dependence and causal attribution is negatively moderated by relationship length measured in the duration of how long the customer had been dealing business with the service provider."

            "text": "Our study advances the understanding of consumer forgiveness by elucidating the underlying mechanism of the dependence relationship in the service failure context. Our study answers the calls of Cambra-Fierro et\u00a0 al. (2015) to study the conceptualization of relationships further to advance the understanding of its impact on forgiveness. As dependence becomes more prominent in the B2C service market, it\u2019s worth investigating whether/how customers\u2019 dependence on a service provider would lead to their forgiveness as a positive coping strategy after service failure encounters. By providing empirical grounds in such accounts, we\u00a0set from this new theoretical angle meanwhile elaborate the boundary conditions that govern customer forgiveness.\nThe current study also promotes the theoretical understanding of dependence by shedding light on two different sides of a customer\u2019s motivational investment. The findings would enrich the extant dependence literature by providing empirical evidence beyond dependence extent, symmetry, or directivity. Scheer et\u00a0al. (2015) noted that the inherent ambiguity in general dependence measures has failed to capture a comprehensive understanding of all aspects and sources of dependence. As such, our framework investigates a customer\u2019s RVD and SCD orientation simultaneously, and the findings suggest RVD is related to external attribution, whereas SCD is associated with internal attribution.\nLast, we\u00a0 extend the service literature by bridging the research gap between relationship framed post-transgression reactions and causal attributions. When customers experience unsatisfactory services, they seek to understand why because they sense a need to understand, control, and predict their environment (Weiner, 2000; Ho et\u00a0al., 2020). And how they attribute the fault after a service failure, especially when the root cause is not evident, will largely determine their posttransgression reactions. In service recovery research, one stream focuses on post-transgression negative reactions to\nservice failure outcomes, while the other on else determinant factors such as causal attributions and customer\u2019s prior relationships. There deserves more attention in a holistic study of forgiveness, causal attributions, and customer\u2013firm prior relationships (Sinha and Lu, 2016). To this end, our study attempted to elicit the role of the individual attribution process in mediating the effect of the dependence relationship on customer forgiveness. Our findings also contribute to the attribution literature by exploring the dependence relationship as a new antecedent of the attribution process."

            "text": "The industry-wide digitalization and Covid-19 pandemic bring firms opportunities and challenges. While leveraging technologies to better engage with customers and boost firm performance, companies also face more significant risks of service failures associated with the technology. Our conceptualization of customer-perceived dependence depicts customers\u2019 reaction mechanisms in the event of service failure. Practitioners can develop marketing strategies accordingly by building upon the knowledge of why customers choose to remain in the service business relationship. Moreover, our study has shown that RVD is positively related to forgiveness because customers tend to make external attribution, and SCD is the contrary. Managers can leverage new technology to better understand and segment customers based on their dependence type, taking proactive approaches accordingly in response to a service failure. Last but not the least, as the linkage between dependence and causal attribution is negatively moderated by patronage length, managers can implement service recovery strategies for short-term and long-term relationships with customers."

Firstly, to remain a parsimonious model, we\u00a0 constructed customer-perceived dependence from a broader relational benefits and costs view, without considering social, psychological, or other customizable factors that may also form dependence. Thus, future research can further explore the conceptualization and measurement realization of the customer-perceived dependence construct. Secondly, some literature argues that forgiveness is a continuous process in which consumers\u2019 cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects all play crucial roles. The interactive impact of attribution and any other factors should be\u00a0examined in future studies, such as relational norms, failure severity, perceived fairness, recovery strategies, and customer emotions. Finally, our research finding is limited in scope as it was conducted in the bank industry of the Chinese market. Future research should look into other industry contexts and different cultures or countries.\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org"

As a VIP member, you\u00a0have always enjoyed the card member benefits such as express line checkout, airport VIP lounge, holiday gifts and so on. With Xinyuan bank, you\u00a0have also been assigned a personal wealth management financial advisor, who understands your financial status and goals, and has guided you\u00a0on planning customized financial strategies to achieve your long-term and short-term investment objectives. On the other hand, you\u00a0have had spent a great deal of time and efforts in learning Xinyuan\u2019s financial products, service policies, and even established a good relationship with the financial advisor. Being a VIP customer, you\u00a0have always maintained high value assets and a high volume of transactions. In your opinion, the VIP gold-card membership status of Xinyuan bank is important for your work and life. Once you\u00a0lose it, you\u00a0will have to incur additional time and effort, and even monetary costs in order to get the same service at other banks. For such reasons, you\u00a0would like to remain the VIP gold-card holder membership.\nCondition 2: High RVD and Low SCD\nYou are a VIP gold-card holder of a national commercial bank, which is named Xinyuan bank. As a VIP member, you\u00a0have always enjoyed the card member benefits such as express line checkout, airport VIP lounge, holiday gifts and so on. With Xinyuan bank, you\u00a0have also been assigned a personal wealth management financial advisor, who understands your financial status and goals, and has guided you\u00a0on planning customized financial strategies to achieve your long-term and short-term investment objectives. Being a VIP customer, you\u00a0have been acquainted with Xinyuan\u2019s financial products and service policies, which are similar to that of other banks. In your opinion, Xinyuan\u2019s VIP experience is better than other competitors,\u2019 and is important for your work and life. In order to continue enjoying the card member benefits, you\u00a0would like to remain the VIP gold-card holder membership.\nCondition 3: Low RVD and High SCD\nYou are a VIP gold-card holder of a national commercial bank, which is named Xinyuan bank. Similar to other banks, the VIP cardholder status of Xinyuan bank is not easy to obtain, which requires a certain value of assets and volume of transactions. Being a VIP customer, you\u00a0have had spent a great deal of time and efforts in learning Xinyuan\u2019s financial products, service policies, and even established good relationships with the financial advisor. However, the VIP status at Xinyuan bank did not offer you\u00a0benefits that suit your needs or service significantly better than other banks. It\u2019s still hard to give up the VIP status since you\u00a0may have to incur additional time and effort, and even monetary costs in order to get service at other banks.\nCondition 4: Low RVD and Low SCD\nYou are a VIP gold-card holder of a national commercial bank, which is named Xinyuan bank. As a VIP member, you\u00a0have been acquainted with Xinyuan\u2019s financial products and service policies, which are similar to that of other banks. Being a VIP customer, however, you\u00a0did not receive benefits that suit your needs or service better than that of other banks. In your opinion, even if the VIP status is lost, you\u00a0can also easily get the same services from other banks.\nPart II. Service failure scenarios in both study\nRecently, you\u00a0plan to buy a new financial investment plan. You\u00a0contact your personal financial consultant, hoping to be\u00a0recommended for some suitable financial products. Based on your budget, risk preferences and expected return, you\u00a0are recommended for a variety of financial products. After careful comparison, you\u00a0picked one product and received all purchase information in detail. However, when you\u00a0tried to buy it online before the deadline, you\u00a0were unable to refresh the page to complete the purchase. As the purchase deadline approaches, you\u00a0called the bank customer service to inquire, but the reply is \u201cpart of our website functions have not been restored due to the recent cyber hacking attacks. We\u00a0are trying to fix the problem as we\u00a0speak, please accept our sincere apologies.\u201d Frustrated, you\u00a0end up missing the opportunity to buy the financial products."
