    "abstractText": "Metacognition is often considered a critical component of learning and higher-order cognition; however, does metacognitive accuracy remain constant across all tasks, specifically in tasks that involve physical or procedural components? To investigate the consistency of metacognitive judgments across various task types, participants completed word and number recall tasks, and also completed three simple physical skill tasks (e.g., catching a ball in a cup). Participants made metacognitive judgments about their performance in all tasks. Results indicated that while participants demonstrated traditional levels of relative metacognitive accuracy in more cognitive tasks, participants were significantly more accurate in their judgments for physical skill tasks. In other words, relative accuracy for metacognitive judgments in physical tasks appears to be significantly higher than for cognitive tasks. This represents the first such demonstration of this effect and suggests that characteristics of physical tasks somehow improve participants\u2019 judgments of how well they have learned.",

            "text": "Metacognition, or \u201cthinking about thinking,\u201d describes the ability to accurately reflect on how well we know what we know. This ability to reflect is critical for the learning process, as judgments of learning (JOLs) or performance (JOPs) are thought to serve as a lead for how learners guide their attention towards to-be-learned material (Metcalfe & Finn, 2008; Rhodes, 2019). Naturally, to optimize learning efficiency, learners must be able to differentiate effectively between strategies or efforts that help them learn, and those that do not (Griffin et\u00a0al., 2019; Thiede & Dunlosky, 1999; Winne & Hadwin, 1998). More accurate metacognitive judgments can help learners accomplish this differentiation by enabling them to more effectively identify deficiencies of memory or understanding, and subsequently focus their efforts on this material rather than on content that is already well memorized or understood.\nThe vast majority of research on metacognition has primarily focused on cognitive tasks such as memory or text comprehension. However, metacognition is likely also relevant in a myriad of other contexts, including less-cognitive task domains that are more physical in nature. For example, a gymnast learning a new floor routine must be able to accurately assess their performance across the many facets of their performance and challenge themselves to improve those portions that still need work or are not executed perfectly, especially if they wish to not only win the competition but also minimize the risk for serious injury. This awareness of the quality of physical performance, compared to a referent level, appears to conceptually fit the definition of a JOL, save that the task involves physical execution rather than the recitation of a list of words. In the truest sense, then, there are reasons to expect parallels between this kind of judgment of physical activity, and tasks that are more cognitive in nature. However, an open question is whether metacognitive judgments observed in these less cognitive contexts are exactly consistent with what has already been observed in more traditional examinations of metacognition that rely exclusively on cognitive tasks.\nThere are several reasons to expect consistency across task types. For example, physical motor tasks seem to share a high degree of reliance on prior knowledge, which is also seen in memory tasks like word recall. In Schmidt\u2019s\n* Lena Hildenbrand lhilde3@uic.edu\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychology, University of\u00a0Illinois at\u00a0Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA\n2 School of\u00a0Psychological Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA\n1 3\n(1975) schema theory of motor learning, movements are produced by generalized motor programs (GMPs) that are composed of a set of specific motor commands that are activated by learned schemas and used to evaluate current sensory feedback. Once a movement has been completed, the existing schema is modified based on both the sensory feedback and the actual outcome (i.e., whether the task was completed successfully). The continual adjustment and presence of schemas, and subsequent use of prior knowledge, is largely consistent with performance in nearly all cognitive tasks that have been used to study metacognitive judgments (Dunlosky & Lipko, 2007; Griffin et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009, 2019; Tauber & Dunlosky, 2016).\nHowever, despite this shared role of prior knowledge, it also appears likely that tasks that involve a physical motor component have additional characteristics that distinguish themselves from more purely cognitive tasks. Specifically, the presence and prominence of proprioceptive cues is unique to these types of tasks and might activate knowledge or information not otherwise available to purely cognitive tasks like list learning.\nIndeed, past research has shown bodily cues can augment cognitive processing in many ways (Glenberg, 2010). Much work in embodied cognition has shown that such haptic information can magnify learning and memory in several domains, including STEM areas (Weisberg & Newcombe, 2017). It has been speculated that the physical cues that are generated by embodied interaction with material provide additional and useful means of encoding and retrieving information for later use (Carbonneau et\u00a0al., 2013; Chu & Kita, 2011; Gallagher &\u00a0Lindgren, 2015; Tversky, 2009), which underlies this embodiment effect. Further, there is strong evidence that relevant haptic or proprioceptive cues can also influence metacognitive judgments. In one study, Alban and Kelley (2013) varied participants\u2019 perceptual experiences of weight for a set of to-be-remembered words that had been printed on boxes. They found that changes in the weight of a box were associated with an increase in JOLs for the associated word, even though participants did not actually remember words differently across box weights. In another study, Palser et\u00a0al. (2018) demonstrated what they refer to as the \u201cadamantly wrong effect.\u201d Using a behavioral priming task, when participants were made to physically move to make their decisions faster than they would naturally, participants reported higher confidence in their decisions; particularly those for which they had responded incorrectly. Finally, research has suggested that young children can actually improve their metacognitive judgments in physical tasks like moving a cart or marble (Stipek et\u00a0al., 1984), or even throwing bean-bags or balls (Powel et\u00a0al., 1993; Schneider, 1998) with increased exposure or familiarity, and that more importantly older, more cognitively\ndeveloped, children are better able to use this task information to increase accuracy.\nThus, it seems that judgments of performance in cognitive tasks are not completely immune to the influence of sensory motor information and haptic cueing (e.g., Alban & Kelley, 2013; Palser et\u00a0al., 2018), and that there is likely a measurable bottom-up influence on metacognition from the motor system. However, previous examples examined the impact of the addition of physical cues on performance in cognitive tasks. Would this effect be similar or different for more physical tasks? Given classic results that have found that cue consistency can lead to enhanced performance (e.g., phonological similarity, context-dependent recall, etc.), there is a likelihood that physical cues on more physical tasks might produce a qualitative benefit beyond what has been observed in previous contexts that have incorporated physical cues into cognitive tasks to study metacognition (Alban & Kelley, 2013; Palser et\u00a0al., 2018)."

In a within-subjects experiment, participants completed both cognitive and physical skill tasks, and made judgments of performance for each. It was hypothesized that judgments of physical performance would at least be equal in accuracy to judgments on more cognitive tasks, however, it was also expected that given the presence and consistency of haptic cues in the physical tasks, physical judgments of learning might in fact be more accurate than those derived in tasks that solely contain a cognitive requirement."

Participants were not given any feedback on these practice trials, and the practice trials were not included in metacognitive estimations.\nWord recall In this task, participants were asked to remember a list of 15 words adapted from Sanchez and Naylor (2018). Words were presented in all capitalized letters and all words selected were low in imaginary value. No words were repeated across lists. Participants were given 30 s to study each list. After study and prior to recalling each list, participants were asked to provide a judgment of how many words (out of 15) they would remember. Participants were then asked to recall as many words as possible, in the same order in which they had been originally presented. Participants recalled these words by typing these words into numbered spaces (1\u201315) on a computer.\nNumber recall This task was identical to the word recall task, except that participants were now given lists with 15 numbers each. Numbers ranged from 1 to 99, and no numbers were repeated across the three lists. Participants were allowed to study each list for 30 s, and for each would provide a judgment of how many numbers (out of 15) they thought they would remember prior to the recall attempt.

This familiarization was non-directed, and intended only for participants to gain some experience with the items that would be used later in the experiment (golf putter, tennis racket, and Cup and Ball toy). All physical items used in each physical task were present during each familiarization period. Importantly, during this familiarity period participants were not told the nature of the later experiment, nor that they would have to make judgments of performance. Also, participants were also not given any feedback on their performance in these tasks from the research team, save descriptions of what they were expected to do.\nExamples of the physical tasks are shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nGolf putting In this task, participants were asked to putt a golf ball across a level surface to hit a target. The target consisted of a 5-in. \u00d7 5-in. cardboard cube, placed 5 ft from the participant. Participants estimated how many times out of ten they could hit this target. After estimating, participants then made ten putts to try and hit the target, and the number of hits was recorded.\nTennis task The second physical task required participants to bounce a tennis ball on a racquet repeatedly as many times as possible without dropping it. A standard men\u2019s tennis\n1 3\nracquet and tennis ball were used. Participants were asked to estimate how many times they would drop the ball in a 2-min period while attempting to bounce the ball, after which they then attempted to bounce the ball for 2 min and the number of drops was recorded.\nCup and Ball The third physical task was a Cup and Ball game, which used a wooden toy \u201ccatch-it cone.\u201d This toy consisted of a 1.75-in. ball connected with a string to a cup on an 8-in. handle. Participants would initiate ball movement through a swinging motion and then attempt to catch the ball with the cup. Participants were asked to estimate how many times they could catch the ball in the cup during a 2-min. period. Participants were then given 2 min to attempt to catch the ball as many times as possible, and the number of catches was recorded."

            "text": "While metacognitive accuracy can be measured in different ways, perhaps the most common means of measuring metacognitive accuracy is relative accuracy. Relative accuracy is the intraindividual correlation between a learners\u2019 predicted and actual performance across a set of tasks (Glenberg & Epstein, 1985; Maki & Berry, 1984). It captures how well learners can differentiate between performance outcomes for different tasks. Relative to other measures such as absolute accuracy or confidence bias the advantage of the relative accuracy measure is twofold: (1) it is not dependent on whether learners can accurately map their judgments on a\ngiven measurement scale, and (2) judgment accuracy does not directly depend on actual task performance itself (Griffin et\u00a0al., 2019; Nelson & Narens, 1990; Rhodes, 2019).\nFor the cognitive tasks the relative accuracy measure included both number and word recall trials. It should be noted that when examined separately, relative accuracy for word and number recall were not significantly different from each other t(38) = 0.95, p = .35. When comparing cognitive task relative accuracy to physical task relative accuracy, as can be seen in Fig.\u00a01, relative accuracy was significantly higher for physical tasks (M = 0.56, SD = 0.68; t(38) = 2.48, p = .02, d = .40) than it was for the cognitive tasks (M = 0.25, SD = 0.43). This result is surprising, yet consistent with the expectation that the presence of haptic cues inherent to physical tasks can influence metacognitive accuracy (e.g., Alban & Kelley, 2013; Palser et\u00a0al., 2018). Further, this nearly twofold increase in level of accuracy seems to also reinforce the idea that increasing the consistency between task requirements and the presence of haptic cues is also beneficial Fig.\u00a02."

For physical task judgments, underconfidence was significantly different from zero (t(38) = - 8.34, p < .001, d = 1.43), while for cognitive task judgments it was not (t(38) = -0.91, p = .37).

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The present study was designed to explore whether the patterns of metacognitive accuracy were consistent across cognitive and less cognitive (and more physical) tasks. It was expected that the presence and consistency of haptic cues within the physical tasks would increase metacognitive accuracy. Results directly confirmed these expectations as participants\u2019 relative accuracy was significantly higher for physical task performance judgments than those made for the more cognitive tasks. This suggests that participants more consistently and accurately judged their performance across the physical tasks than for the cognitive tasks. Given that participants\u2019 relative accuracy for the cognitive tasks used here was consistent with normal levels reported in the literature in other cognitive contexts (Dunlosky & Lipko, 2007; Jemstedt et\u00a0al., 2017; Maki, 1998; Thiede et\u00a0al., 2009), this suggests that the presence of haptic cues present in physical tasks are an especially powerful heuristic for making judgments of performance.\nIn addition to relative accuracy, confidence bias was also examined. Participants were found to be underconfident for both physical and cognitive task performance, though for physical tasks this effect was significantly more pronounced.\nThis difference highlights how relative and absolute accuracy measures of metacognition differ (Griffin et\u00a0al., 2019; Rhodes, 2019). For physical tasks it seems that it was generally more difficult for participants to accurately estimate performance on the scales that they were given, likely due to the more open-ended and variable nature of these scales (e.g., \u201cHow many times would you drop the ball in 2 min?\u201d). However, even when these absolute predictions were not accurate in terms of magnitude, participants were significantly more consistent and reliable in their ability to make judgments, enabling participants to be able to better differentiate between their performance on different physical tasks.\nWhile the results of the current study do represent a first step towards understanding the importance of haptic cues on metacognition and do consistently highlight the distinction between cognitive and less cognitive tasks, future work is critical to more clearly appreciate this divide. One possible concern relative to the present study is that at least superficially, the physical tasks used here may seem somewhat more variant in their nature than the cognitive tasks (which both were simple list recall tasks). A natural concern might be that the relative uniqueness of each physical task is helping participants make more accurate predictions across these physical tasks. While possible, we would argue against this concern for a few reasons. First, despite superficial differences, the three physical tasks do share high levels of similarity on multiple levels not limited to but including: (1) require hand-eye coordination, (2) participants are fixed in place while performing (e.g., not moving their feet or bodies around space, aside from their hands), and (3) involve motor planning, amongst others. Thus, one might argue that there are just as many general similarities across these physical\n1 3\ntasks as there are differences. Further, while the cognitive tasks are more similar superficially, research has shown that indeed free recall strategies do in fact change across multiple lists, and this change can in fact predict performance, effectively changing the nature of the task (Unsworth et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, using perceived similarity (based on superficial characteristics) as a criticism is not as clear cut or simple as may seem initially. However, this highlights an interesting and critical point relative to the calculation of relative metacognitive accuracy; how much similarity is acceptable? Too much similarity and relative judgments are difficult to make as instances \u2018blur\u2019 together (Thiede et\u00a0al., 2009; Wiley et\u00a0al., 2005), while too little similarity (e.g., uniqueness) might make these relative judgments easier, and not truly reflect the same type of metacognitive awareness as other levels of similarity. This is a critical point that needs to be addressed within the metacognitive literature, and it is hoped the current study can serve as a primer for such future work. Related to this point as well, it is also unclear whether superficial cues that are likewise related to the uniqueness of a task might help or harm performance estimates. Literature on perceptual fluency, for example, has robustly demonstrated that such superficial cues can impact performance estimates and cognitive processing strategies (e.g., Sanchez & Jaeger, 2015; Song & Schwarz, 2008). Again, the question of degree of perceived or actual similarity and how it affects judgments of learning appears a ripe and much needed area for future research and theoretical clarification.\nBeyond this larger point, another limitation of the current study is the lack of a consistent rating scale across all tasks. However, due to the correlational nature of relative accuracy, the pattern of judgments relative to actual performance should be consistent regardless of the scale on which those judgments were made. Past research has indicated that differences in framing of problems can influence how these judgments were made (Serra & England, 2012), so in future studies this should also be controlled for.\nIt would also be useful to include other task variants that are perhaps less distinctly cognitive (or less so), in an effort to see whether a slightly less cognitive task (and slightly more physical one, e.g., Rubik\u2019s cube or putting together a puzzle) might produce accuracy estimates that lie between the extremes identified here. This would go a long way towards identifying the potential additive effect of haptic cues and cue consistency. Related to this point, it would also be of interest to select a specific class of physical tasks that are more highly similar in their make-up. While the current tasks all leverage eye-hand coordination and require participants to stay in place while performing (e.g., they were not required to move their feet and just used their hands), it is possible that other underlying physical-motor requirements might have impacted the current results. Selecting a class of physical tasks that are well-matched on these requirements\n(whatever those might be), might provide a more robust and accurate estimate of metacognitive judgments in physical contexts and represents a good opportunity to again expand understanding of physical performance.\nFinally, it is also of interest to explore how time or performance pressure might differentially impact these judgments. If it is true that haptic cues are potentially more powerful for judgments of future performance (and likewise related to subsequent performance), it might be that pressuring factors could be especially deleterious in physical tasks. This might also connect these results on metacognitive accuracy to the phenomenon of \u201cchoking,\u201d which has been studied extensively within physical task contexts (e.g., playing baseball, shooting free-throws) (e.g., Beilock & Carr, 2001; Beilock & Gray, 2007; Worthy et\u00a0al., 2009).\nIn conclusion, even in the absence of any manipulation, there is strong evidence that metacognitive judgment accuracy does differ between task domains. In physical contexts, that are inherently less cognitive, relative accuracy was nearly twice that of purely cognitive tasks. While these tasks likely differ in several ways, it is reasonable to expect that this difference is somehow connected to the presence of haptic cues, and the consistency of these cues relative to the actual task context. It is of interest to explore whether or not this is in fact the case, and importantly, whether these cues can be leveraged to develop and provide heuristic aids or strategies that could likewise improve accuracy also in cognitive domains. Further, this could also lead to even more effective strategies for learning of physical tasks, especially when skill acquisition is self-guided and without constant supervision or coaching. Given that research in expertise that has explored such physical task development explicitly identifies the need for such self-practice (Ericsson et\u00a0al., 1993), it is possible that enhancing accuracy of estimates of physical performance would only seek to enhance learning and the attainment of these physical skills.\nAcknowledgements During the completion of this manuscript, the first author was partially supported by a University Fellowship and a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant R305A160008 to Jennifer Wiley at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
