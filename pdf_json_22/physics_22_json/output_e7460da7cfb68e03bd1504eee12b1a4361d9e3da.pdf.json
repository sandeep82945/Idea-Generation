Spin-correlated excitations that couple strongly to optical cavities promise control over collective quantum phenomena such as magnetic phase transitions, but their suitable electronic resonances have yet to be found. Here we report strong light-matter coupling in NiPS3, a van der Waals antiferromagnet with highly correlated electronic degrees of freedom. A previously unobserved class of polaritonic quasiparticles emerges from the strong coupling between its spin-correlated excitons and the photons inside a microcavity. Detailed spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with a microscopic theory provides unique insights into the origin and interactions of these exotic magnetically coupled excitations. Our work introduces van der Waals magnets to the field of strong light-matter physics and provides a path towards the design and control of correlated electron systems via cavity quantum electrodynamics.\nStrong light-matter coupling has recently emerged as an attractive platform to engineer quantum materials. When coherent optical feedback drives material excitations into a strong coupling regime, new hybrid quasiparticles known as polaritons determine the energy scales of the coupled system. Dressing specific collective modes, such as excitons or phonons with tailored optical fields is expected to cause selective modifications of material properties [1, 2]. Pioneering experiments using excitons in semiconductors embedded in optical cavities realized Bose\u2013Einstein-like condensates, demonstrated fundamental phenomena, such as superfluidity, and spawned device concepts like polaritonic interferometers and Hamiltonian simulators [3, 4]. More recently, the prospects of strong light-matter coupling for manipulating collective phenomena like magnetism, superconductivity, and ferroelectricity in correlated materials has garnered much attention [5\u20137].\nAmong different classes of quantum materials, magnetic van der Waals (vdW) crystals provide access to a large variety of electronic and magnetic phases. Their strong electronic correlations, exotic magnetic orders, and potential for pressure-induced superconductivity currently motivates immense research efforts [8]. In addition to magnetic ordering, experiments demonstrated strong internal coupling of phonons and magnons [9]. Such intertwined degrees of freedom make these materials an ideal platform for exploring new aspects of tailored optical control. Particularly the recent discovery of optically active excitons with coupling to the antiferromagnetic order [1, 10, 11, 13] opens an extraordinary opportunity in this endeavor.\nHere we demonstrate strong coupling between an optical microcavity mode and spin-correlated excitons hosted in the vdW magnetic insulator NiPS3. Hybridization results in a previously unobserved class of polaritons with unique signatures of excitons, photons, and spins. These\nnewly formed quasiparticles are utilized as a probe to study the nature and interactions of spin-correlated excitons. We find that long-range excitonic interactions are severely suppressed owing to the tightly bound and highly localized nature of the excitons. By modeling excitonic transitions in strongly correlated insulators, we capture the key experimental signatures and demonstrate that spin-correlated excitons in NiPS3 have an origin that is distinct from that of excitons in conventional band semiconductors.\nWithin the class of vdW magnets, the family of transition metal thiophosphates (MPX3, with M being a transition metal and X a chalcogen) realizes different types of antiferromagnetism, such as N\u00e9el, stripy, and zig-zag phases [14]. NiPS3 is a correlated insulator that hosts zigzag chains of ferromagnetically oriented Ni spins, which align antiferromagnetically inside each layer below the N\u00e9el temperature TN = 155 K (see Fig. 1a) [15].\nOur low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements of NiPS3 crystals exfoliated onto standard SiO2/Si substrates (see Fig. 1b) show a narrow exciton emission peak at 1.476 eV, in agreement with recent studies [10, 11]. Due to their exceptional coherence, these excitons exhibit spectral widths as low as 350 \u00b5eV in highresolution PL experiments [11]. Our theoretical analysis of strongly correlated electronic states in NiPS3 based on an extended Hubbard model (cf. Supplementary Section 1A) reveals excitonic transitions between S p-orbitals with zero net-magnetization and spin-polarized, longrange ordered Ni d -orbitals (cf. red ellipses in Fig. 1a). As a result, these excitons intrinsically couple to the magnetic order of Ni spins. Their highly anisotropic dipole moment predicted by our model (Supplementary Section 1C) is in excellent agreement with the large degree of linearly polarized PL emission (>80%) observed in our experiments (cf. inset of Fig. 1b).\nThe optical absorption spectrum derived from the lin-\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n06 12\n9v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n1 7\nM ay\n2 02\n3\n2 a\nNi P S\nb\nc\n1.46 1.48 1.50 1.52\nPL in\nte ns\nity (a\nrb . u\n.)\nEnergy (eV)\n0\u00b0\n90\u00b0\n\u2272600\u00b5eV\nX1 X2\nX3\nRefl.\nAbs.\nPL\nDoP\u224883%\nA bs\nor pt\nio n\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n-0.1\n0\n+0.1 dR c\nexciton\nFIG. 1. Excitons in the vdW antiferromagnet NiPS3. a Magnetic moments of Ni atoms in the hexagonal honeycomb lattice slightly magnetize surrounding S ligands except those located between two Ni atoms with opposite spin. Excitons with highly anisotropic dipole moment (red ellipses) form between spin-polarized Ni d-orbitals and unmagnetized S p-orbitals. The black dashed rectangle marks the in-plane magnetic unit cell with dimensions 5.8\u00c5\u00d7 10.1\u00c5 [27]. b A NiPS3 flake with 160 nm thickness and lateral width around 50 \u00b5m on top of a SiO2/Si substrate shows narrow PL emission (full-width at half maximum . 600 \u00b5eV) with strong linear polarization reaching 83%. Spectra represent minimum (grey) and maximum (blue) emission. PL intensity versus polarizer angle \u03b8, plotted in the inset, is well described by I(\u03b8) = I0 sin2(\u03b8), where \u03b8 denotes the analyzer angle with respect to the minimum, I0, of the PL intensity. Blue and grey spectra respectively represent 90 deg and 0 deg analyzer angles. c Optical absorption derived from the linear reflectance spectrum reveals three resonances, X1, X2, and X3, below the charge transfer gap.\near reflectance contrast in Fig. 1c shows three distinct resonances close to the excitonic transition observed in PL spectra. The first resonance, X1, coincides with the PL emission at 1.476 eV and is therefore ascribed to the absorption of these spin-correlated excitons [10]. Another absorption peak, X2, at 1.479 eV, as well as a much broader feature, X3, at 1.498 eV, were also reported in ref. [10]. Their line-shape and temperature dependence indicate that, like X1, they are coupled to the longrange magnetic order and may be related to magnon modes [10, 16, 17]. Indeed, photo-excitation of these resonances with ultrashort laser pulses has recently led to the generation of coherent magnon oscillations [13].\nAs the temperature approaches TN , all the excitonic features discussed above vanish (see Fig. S3, S6 and S10). This strong correlation between excitons and antiferromagnetism is also apparent in an external in-plane magnetic field, which simultaneously rotates the magnetic axis and the emitted photon polarization [1]. In its antiferromagnetic state, NiPS3 thus presents an excellent opportunity for exploring strong light-matter coupling with spin-correlated excitons.\nTo realize strong coupling between these exotic quasiparticles and microcavity photons, we transfer NiPS3 crystals onto dielectric bottom mirrors prior to evaporating a 35 nm-thin top silver mirror (see Methods and\nFig. 2a). The thickness of each individual crystal directly determines the overlap with the photon cavity field. About one out of four NiPS3 crystals exhibits a cavity resonance suitable for the observation of strong coupling in our experiments (cf. Fig. S4). Figure 2b displays an optical image of a NiPS3 microcavity flake with lateral dimensions around 15 \u00b5m and a thickness of 170 nm determined by atomic force microscopy.\nFigure 2c shows an angle-resolved optical reflectance contrast map measured at T=4K. The photonic mode has multiple anti-crossing features that are characteristic of polariton formation via strong coupling of cavity photons and excitons. As indicated by the splittings, each absorption resonance (X1, X2, X3) strongly couples to the optical cavity mode. We fitted the new modes using a coupled oscillator model (cf. Supplementary Section 6) and determined Rabi splitting energies ~\u2126 comparable to the values observed in standard band semiconductors [18]. However, the anti-crossing signature of strong coupling vanishes upon approaching TN (cf. Fig. 2d and Fig. S10), indicating a relation between the polaritons and long-range magnetic order.\nFirst, we study the cavity PL emission obtained under non-resonant laser excitation at T=4K. Angle-integrated spectra comprise a main peak at 1.476 eV, a pronounced high-energy shoulder at 1.478 eV and a broad emission\n3 a\nNiPS3\nAg mirror\nDielectric mirror 0\u00b0\n90\u00b0\nPL\n1.46 1.48\nPL in\nte ns\nity (a\nrb . u\n.)\nEnergy (eV)\nDoP \u2248 53%\nc\nb\nd\ne\nf\n4K\n0.5 1.0 Reflectance contrast\n-30 -15 0 15 30\n1.46\n1.48\n1.50\n1.52\nEn er\ngy (e\nV)\nAngle (\u00b0)\nX1\nX2\nX3\n4K\n-30-150\n120K\n\u0127\u03a93\n\u0127\u03a92\n\u0127\u03a91\nFIG. 2.

Blue and grey spectra represent 90 deg and 0 deg analyzer angles, respectively.\nband around 1.46 eV (cf. Fig. 2f). The linear polarization observed in Fig. 2e shows that the antiferromagnetic order of NiPS3 is preserved in our strongly coupled cavity sample. Like in the bare flakes on SiO2/Si, the degree of polarization varies from sample to sample.\nWe gain valuable insight into the nature of the resulting exciton-polaritons from angle-resolved emission maps. Unlike in most exciton-polariton systems [3, 19], the strongest PL signal of our NiPS3 cavity is observed at energies close to the X1 and X2 exciton resonances (see Fig. 3a,b) and only a small fraction of the total polariton emission occurs from the lowest energy states of the polariton dispersion. This behavior indicates the presence of a pronounced polariton relaxation bottleneck towards the bottom of the dispersion at 1.46 eV, and thus weak polariton scattering processes and interactions. Despite\nmatching with phonon energies found in recent Raman studies (\u2206E \u2248 10\u221220 meV) [20], exciton scattering rates are not sufficient to populate these low-energy polariton states during the short polariton lifetime [21].\nEven in the absence of efficient polariton relaxation via phonons, long-range exciton-exciton exchange interactions typically overcome the relaxation bottleneck and facilitate majority population of low-lying polariton states [3]. However, the observed weak polariton relaxation indicates that these interactions are greatly suppressed in NiPS3. As shown in Fig. 3c,d, only the enhanced phonon scattering at elevated temperatures is able to reduce the relaxation bottleneck and thus increases the fraction of PL observed from low-energy polariton states around 1.46 eV.\nWe also perform polariton excitation spectroscopy \u2013 a\n4 a\nX1\nX2\nX3\n1.46\n1.48\n1.50\n1.52\nEn er\ngy (e\nV)\n-30 -15 0 15 30\n1.46\n1.48\nAngle (\u00b0)\n4K\n60K\nc\n1.46 1.48 0\n1\n2\nPL (n\nor m\n., of\nfs et ) Energy (eV) 4K 60K scattering\nb\nd\n0.7 (0.95)\n1.0 PL (arb. u.)\nexciton reservoir\nexc-exc interaction\n\u0127\u03c9ph\nX1\nX2\nFIG. 3.

Red solid lines represent a fit based on Eq. (1) to determine the saturation density.\n5 powerful technique highly susceptible to non-linear optical phenomena [2, 3, 22] \u2013 to further study the interactions of spin-correlated excitons (see Methods). As shown in Fig. 4a, tuning the power density of the incident broadband laser pulses allows us to measure the microcavity dispersion under increasing excitation density. Since the excitonic fraction is dispersive, exciton energies can be obtained from absorption minima in linecuts taken at angles at which the exciton fraction is close to unity (see Fig. S9). Additionally, Rabi splitting energies can be determined from fits to the dispersion in the anti-crossing region.\nDue to repulsive long-range interactions and the Pauli exclusion principle, polaritons formed by delocalized excitons in band semiconductors typically respond to increasing density by shifting towards higher energies [2, 22]. However, for the three exciton resonances plotted in Fig. 4b, no significant shifts are noticeable despite the high polariton densities (nP \u2248 5 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122) reached in our experiment. Very similar behavior has recently been observed for localized moir\u00e9 excitons in 2D vdW heterostructures [2]. In excellent agreement with our microscopic model presented in Fig. 1a and the conclusions drawn from Fig. 3, excitons in NiPS3 are thus characterized by the suppressed long-range interactions of strongly localized excitons.\nDespite the absence of intrinsic dispersive exciton nonlinearities, strong coupling introduces a collective nonlinear response in the electronic dispersion of our NiPS3 microcavity. Saturation of optical absorption modifies the dispersion due to a gradual reduction of Rabi splitting energies \u2126(np) under increasing polariton density np (cf. Fig. 4c-e). While the negatively detuned cavity analyzed in Fig. 4 indicates no noticeable saturation for \u21263, higher total polariton density reached in a near zerodetuned cavity reveals its saturation at high powers (cf. Fig. S12 and S13). The large saturation density (ns) of X1 and X2 exceeding 1013 cm\u22122 indicates that excitons in NiPS3 are strongly localized and tightly bound by attractive Coulomb forces, despite the pronounced electrostatic screening effects inherent to bulk crystals. As expected from our microscopic model presented in Fig. 1a, the average Bohr radius of X1 and X2 excitons in NiPS3 estimated from their optical saturation (aB = (6 \u00b1 1)\u00c5, see Supplementary Section 10) is comparable to the order of the size of the unit cell [27]. This conclusion is also in excellent agreement with recent first-principles calculations [24] and the large effective masses predicted in ref. [25] resulting in Bohr radii well below 1 nm. The apparent inconsistency between the large exciton binding energies (several hundred meV) and the fact that spincorrelated excitons vanish around T = TN highlights the distinct origin of these magnetically coupled excitations in NiPS3 from excitons in conventional band semiconductors. Despite their exceptionally small Bohr radii, the modest Rabi splitting energies observed in our microcavi-\nties further demonstrate the presence of a relatively small exciton oscillator strength in NiPS3 (see Supplementary Section S9). Finally, we emphasize that pronounced electronic correlations in NiPS3 [15] are responsible for the strong exciton localization supported by the results in Figs. 3 and 4.\nIn summary, we demonstrate strong coupling between microcavity photons and spin-correlated excitons in the vdW magnetic insulator NiPS3. Hybridization leads to a new type of quasiparticle which inherits signatures of excitons, photons, and spins. A detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of these polaritons demonstrates the absence of typical long-range exciton-exciton interactions to result from the strong localization of tightly bound excitons. Future studies could explore the potential of spin-correlated polaritons and their coupling to magnons for optical control of the high-speed information processing demonstrated in antiferromagnets [26]. Furthermore, with the ability of spin-correlated excitons to strongly couple to a microcavity photon field emerges the unique opportunity of realizing polariton Bose-Einstein condensates interacting with magnetically ordered spin systems. Finally, our experiments on correlated vdW antiferromagnets represent a first step towards the cavity-induced optical engineering of strongly correlated quantum materials.\nAcknowledgments: We thank Andrew Millis, Alexander Punnoose and Xiaodong Xu for useful discussions.\nWork at CUNY was supported through the NSF QII TAQS 1936276 (V.M.M.) and the Army Research Office MURI grant: W911NF-17-1-0312 (V.M.M. & A.H.M.).
