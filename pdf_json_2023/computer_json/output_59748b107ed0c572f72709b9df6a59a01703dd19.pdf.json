In coastal and harbor areas, a large number of reefs, artificial facilities, fish and other strong scatterers, coupled with the movement of the sea surface, platforms and multipath effects, make the reverberation complex and variable. Consequently, it may cause severe Doppler spread, and the low-speed target is blended with high-level energy clutter. Due to the time-varying clutter, suppressing the Doppler spread clutter in real-time is the key to reverberation suppression.\nTraditional methods of reverberation suppression include array design, waveform design and post-processing algorithm design. Typically, the essence of array design is\nKeywords: Dyna-Q-Max-Action, Reinforcement learning, Reverberation Doppler spread clutter, Cognitive sonar\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

Moreover, the essence of the waveform design method is to increase the product of pulse width bandwidth and improve the matched filter gain [2]. In addition, the post-processing algorithm design contains pre-whitening [3], spatial processing method [4], principal component inverse (PCI) subspace method [5], graphic method to suppress reverberation [6]. Pre-whitening converts reverberation from colored noise into white noise, improves output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with matched filters, improves receiver and increases active sonar detection capability. The PCI subspace method decomposes the echo into reverberation subspace and target echo plus white noise subspace. Since the energy of the reverberation subspace is stronger than the target plus white noise subspace components. Hence, setting a threshold to subtract the stronger components to suppress reverberation. In addition, the graphic approach is to improve the contrast between the reverberation and the target in the active sonar image, thus improving the detection capability. However, the above method unable to adjust the detection waveform according to the time-varying reverberation environments. Furthermore, the above method only adaptively adjusts the receiver side without joint the transmitter side for reverberation suppression, the active sonar computational resource is wasted and the parameter estimation efficiency is reduced.\nIn 2006 Haykin [7] proposed the concept of cognitive radar based on the echo-location system of bats. The cognitive radar consists of three elements: (1) the radar learns from environments; (2) the radar transmitter is interacted with receiver; (3) the radar preserves echo information. The above-mentioned adaptive radar methods make adaptive adjustments to the receiver. In contrast to the adaptive radar, the cognitive radar can adjust the transmit waveform parameters jointly with the \u201ctransmitter-receiver\u201d over a long period of time.\nThe underwater acoustic channel is a severe time-doppler dual spread channel that enlarge the demand for active sonar waveform design freedom. In 2011, L. Xiaohua combined environmental information and target prior knowledge proposed the cognitive sonar, with reference to the cognitive radar. The cognitive sonar adjusts the transmit waveform parameters according to the echo [8]. In 2015, Tim Claussen [9] used Doppler processing and real-time interpolation to adjust the cognitive sonar transmit beamformer. 2016, X. Qing combined bionics and dolphin research [10] increased the freedom of cognitive sonar waveform design and proposed the cognitive sonar waveform (CSW). CSW combines the ambiguity function (AF) and Q function to constrain the waveform parameters, such as pulse width, frequency and the number of pulse trains, in order to suppress reverberation. Conversely, cognitive sonar cannot get optimal waveform rapidly, takes a lot of time does not adapt to a rapid time-varying environment.\nRecently, with increased computer arithmetic and reduced difficulty in acquiring training data, machine learning has shown amazing performance in many areas, such as target recognition, acoustic confrontation, interference suppression, etc. Moreover, the optimal solution to the above problems is the non-deterministic polynomial (NP) hard problem. The sub-optimal method like reinforcement learning (RL) can provide solutions to the NP problem. RL learns by interacting with the environment through rewards and punishments, then continuously adjusting action towards a higher reward. RL is widely used. In the field of Go [11], to acquire decision-making\ncapabilities by learning previous game actions and using them to subsequent actions. As in the field of the game [12], RL can optimize the Super Mario\u2019s actions based on the environment to find the optimal path to the goal quickly. In 2018, Jason E. [13] proposed RL combined with cognitive sonar, which can reduce the time to acquire optimal waveform. In 2022, Jeff Tucker [14] combined RL with cognitive sonar for multi-target detection and tracking, by adjusting the sonar waveform to learn from the environment. The efficiency of target detection and tracking is greatly improved. Cognitive sonar based on RL has important implications and extensive research space.\nRL is a Markov decision process (MDP) consisting of action, reward signal, transfer probability, model of environment, etc. The analogy of cognitive sonar based on RL is waveform, reward signal, transfer probability, echo information, etc.\nThe reward signal is defined by the goal of RL which represent the value of waveform selection. The underwater environment is complex, the fixed waveform cannot adapt to the time-varying environment, hence the waveforms and environment information are trained in RL to obtain the optimal waveform. The choice of the reward function is important, and irrational choice may lead to algorithm failure. In this paper, a target resolution function is proposed, which can directly detect whether the reverberation Doppler spread clutter contains a target. Since a Doppler-sensitive waveform can suppress the reverberation [15]. If the target cannot be detected, the cognitive sonar will change the waveform parameters to suppress the reverberation and distinguish the target, as shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nThe convergence episodes of RL directly influence the real-time update efficiency of the active sonar. Traditional RL algorithms include the Q-Learning algorithm and the state action reward state action (SRASA) algorithm. These are all temporal-difference (TD) single-step update algorithms, which have a slow convergence speed. In order to make full use of existing knowledge, Sutton introduced the planning process in RL and proposed the model-based Dyna RL algorithm [16]. This type of algorithm stores experience knowledge by building a model of the environment and generates simulated experience to train the learning machine offline. Since the action selection of the model samples directly determines the efficiency of the algorithm. The introduction of the planning process gives RL the \u2019cognitive\u2019 ability, getting rid of simple trial-anderror learning and greatly improving the convergence efficiency of the algorithm.\nIn the Dyna framework, the action selection of the planning directly affects the convergence episodes of the algorithm. Sutton initially adopts the random-sample method [16], many iterations of the value function in planning are ineffective for the algorithm. Therefore, the maximum reward action selection strategy\u00a0for Dyna-Q (Dyna-Q-Max-Action) is first proposed in this paper. The convergence episodes of the algorithm are shortened by reducing the probability of invalid random-sample action selection. Thus, this algorithm has fewer convergence episodes than the Dyna-Q algorithm convergence episodes. Cognitive sonar based on RL combines the advantage of RL to solve complex problems with the advantage of cognitive sonar to interact with the environment in real-time. It can solve the problem of difficulty in obtaining optimal waveform for complex environments by active sonar theoretically.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section\u00a02 describes the statistical model of reverberation Doppler spread clutter, and proves the statistical model with the real data from the Qiandao Lake. Furthermore, analysis of the factors of waveform parameters affecting the reverberation Doppler spread clutter. The target resolution function in reverberation Doppler spread clutter is proposed. The Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm is proposed by optimizing the action selection strategy of the Dyna-Q algorithm. Moreover, the principle and algorithm flow of the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm is described in detail. Section\u00a03 discusses numerical simulation results of the Dyna-Q-Max-Action cognitive sonar combing with the reverberation target resolution function. Meanwhile, analysis of the influence of the model training episodes and action selection probability on the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm. Then, conclude a reasonable action selection probability. Conclusions are given in Sect.\u00a04."

            "text": "The establishment of reverberation statistical model is significant for reverberation analysis and simulation. Etter and other researchers mentioned two difficulties in reverberation statistical modeling: the lack of analytical tools for solving complex boundary problems, and the difficulty of measuring and distinguishing too many influencing factors of reverberation [17\u201319]. According to the relationship between the size of the scatterer and the wavelength of the acoustic wave, the reverberation modeling can be divided into the point scattering model and the unitary scattering model. In this paper, a more realistic point scattering model is used for modeling.\nThe point scattering model assumes that scatterers are randomly distributed in the ocean and the reverberation is the superposition of all scatterer backscattered echoes. The point scattering model has a clear physical meaning and can directly assume the statistical properties of the scattered echo amplitude, phase, and Doppler shift. Considering the small amplitude of the multiple scattering, the multiple scattering effect is ignored. Under the assumption of the narrow-band waveform, the reverberation can be described as\n(1)R(t) = N (t)\ni=1 Ais(t \u2212 \u03c4i)ej2\u03c0\u03c6it\nwhere N(t) is the number of scatterers contributing to the reverberation at time t. Ai,\u03c4i and \u03c6i , denote the amplitude, time delay, and Doppler shift of the i-th scatterer echo, respectively. s(t) denotes the waveform. In addition, the statistical distribution of the echo amplitude Ai determines the statistical distribution model of the reverberation envelope. Moreover, the Doppler shift \u03c6i of the echo determines the Doppler shift of the reverberation, representing the severity of the Doppler spread. Each scatterer Ai obeys Gaussian distribution, \u03c4i and \u03c6i are independent of each other. Therefore, satisfying the above conditions is the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel reverberation.\nAccording to reference [20], a reverberation Doppler spread clutter model is established. It is known that the mathematical model probability density function (PDF) of reverberation Doppler spread distribution conforms to the two-side exponential distribution. The two-side exponential distribution is the distribution model with the highest matching according to the real sea test data. The two-side exponential distribution is symmetrically distributed about v = 0 , the parameters of the distribution can be used to characterize the severity of the Doppler spread.\nwhere \u00b5 represents the slope ss of the Doppler spread. A large number of sea test data show that the ss is ranging between 6 and 20 dB/kn. The above equation is also known as the Doppler spreading function. \u00b5 can be solved by the definition of ss\nthen\nC. Zhang proposed a pseudo-random number generation method for reverberation numerical simulation in combination with the two-side exponential distribution model [21], and verified the model with the Qiandao Lake experiment data. Set y to be a uniformly distributed random number in the interval (0, 1), this leads to\nAccording to Eq.\u00a0(5), a random number v obeying the statistical model with the specified Doppler spread can be generated. Using the point scattering model, a scattering model with 10,000 points is established. v is converted into a Doppler shift \u03c6i using the formula \u03c6i = f0 2vc calculated by substituting the reverberation formula Eq.\u00a0(1), where the amplitude obeys a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.

The scatterer Doppler distribution \u03c1(\u03c6) is modeled according to the twoside exponential distribution, and two extreme cases of scatterer Doppler distribution are considered, which are discussed as ss=6 dB/kn, \u00b5=0.69 and ss=20 dB/kn, \u00b5=2.30. The waveform CW pulse width is T=0.23 s, the target is 1.29 m/s, and the signal-toreverberation ratio (SRR) is SRR=4 dB.\nMoreover, it is assumed that the target time information is known, and the target time region is extracted with twice the pulse width before subsequent signal processing.\nFigure\u00a0 3a is modeled with Eq.\u00a0 (5) and shows the relationship between different scatterer Doppler distributions and the reverberation Doppler distribution.

When the CW pulse width T =0.1 s, the target is not easy to distinguish. When the CW pulse width T = 0.3 s, the reverberation Doppler distribution becomes narrower and the waveform Doppler resolution increases, it is obvious that the 0.707 (3 dB) position target is easy to distinguish. Therefore, without considering noise interference, the 0.707 (3 dB) Doppler distribution width of the reverberation can be used to determine whether the target is distinguishable. Thus, the reverberation target resolution function is proposed:\n\u03c6 data is the reverberation Doppler 0.707 (3 dB) width, and \u03c6wave(T ) is waveform Doppler resolution half of the 0.707 (3 dB) width. When the 0.707 (3 dB) reverberation width is equal to two times the waveform Doppler resolution, it represents that the target is distinguishable.\nWith the change of waveform pulse width, the reverberation Doppler distribution is also changing. For the single-peak target, 3 dB position can be directly judged as Fig.\u00a04a, if the 3 dB position consists of a double-peak as Fig.\u00a04b, one of the peaks near 0\u00a0m/s, another peak with 3 dB width can be judged, if the secondary peak width meets Eq.\u00a025, on behalf of the target can be distinguished.\nFrom the above analysis, it can be seen that increasing the waveform pulse width can reduce the reverberation Doppler spread clutter width to distinguish the target. For high-speed moving targets, the Doppler clutter will basically not exist. As the ocean environment changes, the reverberation scatterer Doppler distribution changes in real time, and different waveforms need to be used according to different environments to help target discrimination.

The Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm architecture is shown in Fig.\u00a05 below.\nFigure\u00a0 5 \u2018Real Experience\u2019 to \u2018Value Functions (Q-value)\u2019 represents direct learning based on real experience to improve Q-values and actions. \u2018Real Experience\u2019 to \u2018Model\u2019 to \u2018Simulated Experience\u2019 to \u2018Value Functions (Q-value)\u2019 is a model-based learning process. The model learns from real experience and generates simulated experience. Finally, the simulated experience is used to update the Q-value.\nThe core idea of the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm is the Q-value learning from real experience and planning from simulated experience. Learning and planning are deeply integrated in the sense that they share almost all the same machinery, differing only in the source of their experience. The \u03b5 model action selection strategy can shorten the convergence episodes of the active sonar."

Then compare the number of the Dyna-QMax-Action algorithm convergence episodes for different model training times.\nIn Fig.\u00a06a\u2013d Env=0 refers to the Q-learning algorithm, Env=5 represents the DynaQ-Max-Action algorithm with 5 times of model training, and the x-axis represents the number of training episodes. According to the results of the number of convergence steps, the sum of rewards and the average reward, the step convergence efficiency increases as the number of model training times increases.\nIn Fig.\u00a06a, b, the step of the Q-learning algorithm needs about 30 episodes to converge, while after 5 times of model training the step of the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm only needs about 20 episodes to converge. Even after 90 times of model training, the step of the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm just needs several episodes to converge.\nAccording to the average loss curve in Fig.\u00a06d, the Q-learning algorithm Q-value needs about 400 episodes to converge. While after 5 times of model training, the Dyna-QMax-Action algorithm Q-value needs about 150 episodes to converge, and only about 30 episodes to converge after 90 times of training.\nTherefore, as the number of training times increases, the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm with \u03b5 =1 shortens the number of training episodes and increases the efficiency.\nFigure\u00a06e, f the histograms are plotted based on the Q table and the table of model reward signals after 90 times of model training. Figure\u00a06e indicates the Q-value of different actions in different environments. Figure\u00a06f indicates the model reward of different actions in different model environments. S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 represent five different reverberation Doppler clutter widths, and t01, t015, t02, t03, and t035 represent five waveforms, which corresponding to pulse widths of 100 ms, 150 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, and 350 ms, respectively in Table\u00a01.\n(30)Loss = Sum(Qpredict \u2212Q)/Steps\n(31)Raverage = Sum(R reward )/Steps\nAccording to the histogram, it can be seen that the optimal waveform t03 in different environments of the Q table of the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm has the largest Q-value and can provide the absolute maximum action selection to the environment. The histogram of the model reward shows that only the optimal action and its corresponding optimal environment reward is the largest. Therefore, it makes each model action selection directly select the t03 optimal waveform and speed up the step convergence speed and shorten the Q-value convergence episodes."

It is almost the same as Fig.\u00a06a, b.\nIn addition, according to Figs.\u00a06d and 7d, it can be seen that after 90 times model training, the \u03b5=0.6 curve is flatter compared to the \u03b5 =1 curve after convergence.\nThe histogram results in Fig.\u00a0 7e show that the Q table of \u03b5=0.6 the Dyna-Q-MaxAction algorithm shows a stepwise growth in different environments, and the Q-value tend to the optimal waveform t03.

            "text": "The discrimination of low-speed weak targets in reverberation Doppler spread clutter is a difficult problem in active sonar signal processing. This paper combines the point scattering model and two-side exponential distribution to model the reverberation Doppler spread clutter, and verifies the effectiveness of the model through the real data of the Qiandao Lake. In this paper, a target resolution function is proposed for the reverberation Doppler clutter target resolution problem, which can quickly identify the target in the Doppler spread clutter, and the target resolution function is combined with the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm, which enables the active sonar to adjust the waveform parameters according to different reverberation. Meanwhile, the relationship between the Dyna-Q-Max-Action algorithm and the greediness of action selection and the number of model training times are discussed. Based on the numerical simulation results, it is found that the step convergence efficiency of the Dyna-QMax-Action algorithm combined with the action selection greediness converges more rapidly than the step of the Q-learning algorithm. According to the results, the DynaQ-Max-Action algorithm converges with fewer episodes than the Dyna-Q algorithm converges episodes.
