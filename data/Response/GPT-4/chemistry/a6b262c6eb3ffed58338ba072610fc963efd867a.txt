Biosynthetic Pathway Elucidation and Engineering: Investigate the biosynthetic pathways of lesser-understood Aspergillus-derived polyketides to uncover new mechanisms of polyketide synthesis. Utilizing synthetic biology and metabolic engineering techniques could enable the production of novel or optimized polyketides with enhanced pharmacological properties.

Discovery of Novel Polyketides via Silent Gene Cluster Activation: Many fungal gene clusters responsible for secondary metabolite production remain silent under standard laboratory conditions. Employing techniques such as heterologous expression, epigenetic modification, and the OSMAC (One Strain Many Compounds) approach could activate these silent gene clusters, leading to the discovery of novel polyketides with potential therapeutic uses.

Polyketides as Leads for Drug Development: With a focus on Aspergillus-derived polyketides that have shown promising biological activities, such as immunosuppression, antioxidant, antitumor, and antimicrobial effects, future research could aim at optimizing these compounds for drug development. This includes structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, medicinal chemistry optimizations, and preclinical testing.

Mechanistic Studies of Polyketide-Derived Bioactivities: Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the bioactivities of polyketides. This includes studying the interaction between polyketides and their biological targets, elucidating their pathways of action, and identifying potential off-target effects. Such studies can help in the rational design of more effective and safer polyketide-based drugs.

Ecological and Evolutionary Roles of Polyketides in Aspergillus spp.: Exploring the ecological and evolutionary significance of polyketide production in Aspergillus spp. could provide insights into how these compounds contribute to the fungi's survival, competitiveness, and interactions with the environment. This research could also reveal new bioactive compounds and their potential applications in agriculture, such as natural pesticides or plant growth regulators.
