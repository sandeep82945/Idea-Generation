            "text": "Each component of a contact binary system has its own Roche lobe, with the inner and outer critical surfaces sharing a common envelope. These stars are generally late type F, G, or K type stars. The majority of contact systems are solar-type dwarfs with active stellar populations, as evidenced by their asymmetric light curves and spectral line profiles.\nContact binaries typically have orbital periods of less than one day, and the Zhang & Qian (2020) investigation found that the lower limit of orbital period is 0.15 days. The orbital period is frequently varied over time, due to mass transfer from one component to the other, as well as mass and angular momentum loss from the binary system. Although, according to Latkovic\u0301 et al. (2021) study, systems with orbital periods of more than 0.5 days and temperatures greater than 7000 K probably have radiative envelopes and should not be classified as W UMa-type contact binaries.\nContact binaries are debatable in terms of mass, and the lower limit of mass ratio for these systems is presently under investigation (e.g. Yang & Qian 2015; Arbutina 2007; Li & Zhang 2006). Additionally, since many investigations lack a spectroscopic method, determining the mass ratio is a challenging issue.\nW Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact systems (EW) are classified into two categories, W-type and A-type, based on their properties. The mass ratio in A-subtype systems is often less than 0.5, showing weak or moderate activity. In W-subtype systems the less massive component is hotter and the period changes continuously over time (Binnendijk 1970). In comparison with the W-subtypes, A-subtype systems are earlier spectral types with higher mass and luminosity.\nThe purpose of this study is to present the first light curve analysis of the AH Mic binary system and determine its properties. AH Mic is a binary system from the southern hemisphere with a range of apparent magnitude of V = 12.85 \u2212 13.45 and an orbital period of 0.3243344 days (Watson et al. 2006). In all the available catalogs, this binary system is classified as a EW-type system. This paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 contains information about the multi-color photometric observations from an Australian observatory as well as a data reduction technique. Section 3 explains how to extract our times of minima, collect minima collection times from literature, and compute a new ephemeris. The Phoebe Python code and\n4 the MCMC approach were used to study the light curves of the AH Mic system, and the absolute parameters were obtained in section 4. Section 5 has a summary and conclusion."

            "text": "AH Mic (RA. 21 04 57.8280, Dec. \u221240 33 06.084 (J2000)) was observed for six nights in August and September 2020 with a GSO 14-inch f/8 Ritchey Chretien telescope at the Congarinni Observatory in Australia (152\u25e6 52\u2032 East and 30\u25e6 44\u2032 South). The data was taken using a SBIG STT3200-ME CCD camera (2184\u00d71510 pixels, 6.8 micron square) with 2\u00d72 binning and a CCD temperature of \u221215\u25e6C. These observations were made using the Astrodon Johnson-Cousins BV RI standard filters. The exposure time of these observations for BI filters is 120 seconds and for V R filters is 60 seconds. GSC 7969-723 was selected as a comparison star and GSC 7969-1170 was chosen as a check star with an appropriate apparent magnitude in comparison to AH Mic. The comparison star was found at R.A. 21h 04m 49.91976s (J2000), Dec. \u221240\u25e6 39\u2032 42.8868\u201d (J2000) with a V = 12.831 magnitude, while the check star was located at R.A. 21h 04m 50.96544s (J2000), Dec. \u221240\u25e6 37\u2032 18.0120\u201d (J2000) with a V = 13.285 magnitude, based on the AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey DR9 (APASS9) catalog. Figure 1 shows the observed field-of-view for AH Mic with the comparison and the check stars.\nDuring the observations, a total of 1417 images were acquired. The CCD image processing was done with MaxIm DL software, which included dark, bias, and flat-field corrections (George 2000). The airmass decreases the flux of stars when light passes through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. We estimated the airmass based on observatory coordinates and the position of the star in the sky during the observations (Hiltner 1962). Finally, we used the AstroImageJ (AIJ) software to normalize all of the ground-based data (Collins et al. 2017), and apply airmass1.\n1 This study\u2019s data (after data reduction) is available in four filters as a supplement file."

            "text": "We extracted the nine times of minima in the light curves which four of them are the primary minima. We used models based on the Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to find the times of minima and the MCMC sampling methods to estimate the uncertainty of the values (Poro et al. 2021). The Python code for this extraction is implemented using the PyMC3 package (Salvatier et al. 2016). All times of minimum are expressed in the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time (BJDTDB), and table 1 shows all CCD times of minima with their uncertainties of AH Mic system.\nO-C variations are the differences between observed mid-eclipse times (O) and their calculated values (C) based on a reference ephemeris. An observable trend in O-C is caused by various factors and effects. Due to the small number of minimum times and the short interval of observation (2013\u20132020), only a linear fit can be considered for the AH Mic system. We fitted a line on all times of minima to calculate a new ephemeris based on the MCMC approach using the emcee package in Python (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) as shown in Figure 2.\n6"

We employed the Phoebe along with the emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013), with the MCMC approach for more precision in modeling, output results, and uncertainties. We applied 32 walkers and 1000 iterations to each walker in the MCMC approach. The Phoebe and MCMC approach then searched for the temperature ratio, orbital inclination, and mass ratio. The bolometric albedo\nTHE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM 7\nand gravity-darkening coefficients were assumed to be gh = gc = 0.32 (Lucy 1967) and Ah = Ac = 0.5 (Rucin\u0301ski 1969). The stellar atmosphere was modeled using the Castelli & Kurucz (2004) method, and the limb-darkening coefficients were employed as a free parameter in the Phoebe. Different methods were used to determine the effective temperature for the hotter component as a fixed parameter. (1) The temperature of the Gaia DR22 for AH Mic system is 5381 +(74) \u2212(51) K; (2) The result of the B \u2212 V index obtained from this work\u2019s light curves to be 0.73 \u00b1 0.04 after calibration (H\u00f8g et al. 2000) and as a result we found the effective temperature 5470 +(111) \u2212(119) K according to Flower (1996) study; (3) The effective temperature from the result of Poro et al. (2022) analysis of the relationship between orbital period and the primary (hotter) temperature for contact systems is 5681 +(81) \u2212(80) K. We chose Gaia DR2\u2019s temperature as a fixed parameter for the hotter star. In the continuation, we performed the initial light curve analysis. Then, based on the\n2 https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/\n8 following equations from Kjurkchieva et al. (2018) study, we calculated the temperatures and performed the final photometric light curve solutions:\nT1 = Tm + c\u2206T\nc+ 1 (2)\nT2 = T1 \u2212\u2206T (3)\nwhere \u2206T is the temperature difference between the two stars, and c is l2 divided by l1. The BV RI light curves of the AH Mic system are asymmetric in the maxima. This shows that the O\u2019Connell effect (O\u2019Connell 1951) is present in this system, as MaxII is brighter than MaxI . We employed a stellar spot model during the light curve solution in all used filters, and we found that assuming a cool star-spot model on the hotter component leads to the appropriate solutions for all BV RI light curves (Table 2). Table 3 shows the characteristic properties of the AH Mic light curves, with the difference in maxima in each filter displayed in the first row. Therefore, the B filter had the highest difference between the levels of maximum light and the depths of the minima, while the R filter had the least. This is expected because of the induced changes in the magnetic activity.\nTable 2 shows the results of the light curve analysis, whereas Figure 3 displays the observational and theoretical light curves of our modeling. Figure 4 depicts the 3D view and geometrical structure of the AH Mic binary system.\n4.2. Absolute parameters\nThe Gaia EDR3 parallax method can be used to estimate the absolute parameters when only photometric data is available. Several elements from observational and light curve analysis are used in the computations, despite the fact that the Gaia EDR3 parallax has high accuracy for this estimation. Recent investigations have made some corrections to the Gaia EDR3 parallax (e.g. Lindegren et al. 2021; Ren et al. 2021). The range of these corrections appears to include the value of observational and light curve solution uncertainties (Poro et al. 2022).\nTHE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM 9\n10\nTherefore, in order to properly estimate the absolute parameters of the stars of AH Mic binary system, we used the Gaia EDR3 parallax method. This is a well-known method, which is fully described in the Poro et al. (2022) study.\nTHE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM 11\nTo perform the estimation, we first obtained the absolute magnitude (Mv) of the system using the maximum light of apparent magnitude Vmax = 12.79(5) from our observation, the star\u2019s distance from Gaia EDR3 d(pc) = 470.2(6.5), and the extinction coefficient Av = 0.08 from the Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) study. Then, by using the value of lh/ltot and lc/ltot from the light curve solutions, we obtained the Mv value of each of the component. In addition, the bolometric magnitude Mbol value of each star were obtained using BCh = \u22120.133 and BCc = \u22120.199. Furthermore the luminosity (L) values were estimated and the radius values of each star were obtained using the temperature of the stars from the light curve solutions. The semi-major axis of the system was also determined by utilizing a = R/r(mean) equation. According to Kepler\u2019s third law, the value of Mh + Mc could be estimated using the semi-major axis and the orbital\n12\nperiod of the system. Moreover, the mass of the hotter and the cooler stars were determined using the value of mass ratio.\nTo estimate the uncertainties using mass ratio and temperature from light curve analysis, we used the average value of uncertainties rather than the upper and lower ranges. The results of estimating the absolute parameters for the AH Mic system are shown in Table 4.\nFor comparison, we calculated absolute magnitude of system using the orbital period\u2013luminosity calibra-\ntion of Rucinski (2006):\nMV = (\u22121.5)\u2212 12logP (4)\nThe result of relation 4 shows M (mag.)

The first light\nTHE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM 13\ncurve analysis of the AH Mic system was done in this work, which was performed using the latest version of the Phoebe Python code and the MCMC approach. To estimate the system\u2019s absolute parameters, we used the Gaia EDR3 parallax method, and the rest of the parameters were calculated using the observational parameters and the light curve solutions from this study.\nWe fixed the Gaia EDR3 temperature for the hotter component at first, and obtained the cooler component temperature from light curve solutions. This temperature is from the combination of both stars in the system. So, using Equation 2, we obtained the final temperature values of each star. The temperature difference between the two components is 276 K. According to Allen\u2019s table (Cox 2000), these temperatures indicate that the spectral types of the hotter and cooler components are G5 and G8 respectively.\nThe mass ratio is an important parameter for contact binaries and it is determined through q-search when there is just photometric observations. The mass ratio in this study was determined using a method based on the MCMC approach. The reliable value of mass ratio through photometric light curve analysis is still under many investigations to approach the accuracy of this value using the spectroscopy method. However, investigations have been conducted, one of which is based on the Machine Learning methods using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression model and was carried out by the Poro et al. (2022) study. According to this method, we find the estimated range of mass ratio for AH Mic to be 0.408 to 0.572 with a mean of 0.485, which includes our calculated mass ratio of 0.431 from the light curve solutions. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the q specified in the Poro et al. (2022) study is the ratio of the less massive star mass to the more massive star mass, hence q is never more than unity.\nThe Orbital Angular Momentum (J0) of the AH Mic system was calculated, and its location is displayed on the logJ0\u2212 logM diagram (Figure 5). The value of logJ0 of AH Mic was obtained to be 51.866\u00b10.035. The diagram shows that this system is in a contact binary systems region.\nThe H-R diagram depicted the evolutionary state of the components (Figure 6). The cooler star (which is more massive) has already evolved away from the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS), and the hotter star stays in the main sequence belt and above the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). According to the value of the mass ratio, the fill-out factor, inclination, and location of components on the H-R diagram, AH Mic follows the general pattern of the W-type W UMa systems.\n14\nTHE FIRST STUDY OF AH MIC CONTACT SYSTEM 15"
