            "text": "The adaptive immune response eliminates infected and cancer cells through the recognition of antigenic 11\npeptides displayed by major compatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules1,2. A single transporter, the 12\ntransporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), supplies nearly the entire peptide repertoire for the 13\nmany MHC-I alleles3\u20135. A fundamental unresolved question is how TAP transports peptides with vast se-14\nquence diversity. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined seven structures of hu-15\nman TAP in the presence and absence of peptides with different sequences and lengths. We observe 16\nthat peptides are suspended in the transmembrane cavity of TAP with the peptide N- and C-termini an-17\nchored at two distal binding pockets. The central residues of the peptide are unrestricted, making few 18\ncontacts with TAP. A minimum of eight residues is required to bridge the two binding pockets, aligning with 19\nthe lower length limit for MHC-I binding6,7. Mutations in TAP that disrupt hydrogen bonds with the peptide 20\ntermini nearly abolish MHC-I surface expression, indicating that binding depends on interactions with 21\nmainchain atoms at the two termini. By utilizing two spatially separated binding pockets and concentrating 22\ninteractions at the two ends of the peptide, TAP functions as a molecular caliper, selecting peptides for 23\nlength while permitting sequence diversity. 24\n25\nIntroduction 26\n27\nCytotoxic T cells recognize and eliminate diseased cells upon the detection of foreign peptides displayed 28\nby cell surface MHC-I molecules. The loading of intracellular peptide antigens onto MHC-I molecules oc-29\ncurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involves several key steps1. In the cytosol, proteins are de-30\ngraded into small peptides by the proteasome8,9. A small fraction of these peptides is transported into the 31\nER by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)10\u201313. There, high affinity peptides are se-32\nlectively loaded onto MHC-I by the peptide loading complex and eventually displayed on the surface of 33\nthe cell for immunosurveillance2,14. Peptides derived from endogenous proteins are immunologically silent 34\ndue to self-tolerance. In the context of viral infection or malignant transformation, however, displayed pep-35\ntides derived from foreign or aberrant proteins trigger an immune response that eradicates the diseased 36\ncell. 37\n38\nThe potential sequence space of foreign peptides is vast, due to the combined diversity of viral proteomes 39\nand products of mutational burden in malignant transformation. Display of these peptides thus depends 40\non antigen presentation machinery flexible enough to accommodate broad sequence diversity. The princi-41\nples governing MHC-I presentation are well understood6,15,16. Humans have three classical MHC-I (HLA-42\nA,B,C) genes that are highly polymorphic, resulting in vast genetic diversity within a population. Further-43\nmore, by interacting with the peptide\u2019s backbone and a few anchoring residues, each MHC-I allele can 44\npresent a unique cohort of peptides. In contrast, our understanding of how TAP accommodates vast se-45\nquence diversity remains incomplete. Each of us only possesses one TAP, which exhibits very limited de-46\ngrees of polymorphism17\u201321. One might expect TAP to be promiscuous as this transporter provides pep-47\ntides to the many MHC-I alleles. However, numerous studies showed that TAP does exercise a certain 48\ndegree of substrate preference. TAP most efficiently transports peptides of 8-12 residues in length, a size 49\nsimilar to the peptides MHC-I molecules bind22,23. Although the upper size limit is not clearly established, it 50\nis widely accepted that the lower limit is 8 residues22,24\u201326. Also, like MHC-I, free N- and C- termini of the 51\npeptide are essential for TAP binding. Modification at either terminus reduces peptide recognition sub-52\nstantially27\u201330. Finally, the sequence tolerance of TAP seems to be broad. It appears that only the N-53\nterminal three positions and the C-terminus determine binding affinity26,29,31,32. Previous studies have 54\nshown that the peptide is bound in an extended conformation33 and that specific residues on TAP influ-55\nence substrate binding34\u201339. However, molecular details of the TAP-peptide interaction are necessary to 56\nunderstand the functional properties of TAP. 57\n58\nIn this study, we used cryo-EM to determine a series of structures of human TAP, both in the absence of 59\npeptide and in the presence of peptides with various sequences and lengths. These findings define the 60\nmolecular basis of how TAP selects peptides of the appropriate length with vast sequence diversity for 61\nMHC-I presentation. 62\n63\nResults 64\n65 66 The structures of TAP in the presence and absence of peptide substrates 67 68\nWild-type (WT) human TAP was overexpressed and purified from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells in 69\nthe detergent glycol-diosgenin (GDN) (Extended Fig. 1a) for biochemical and structural studies. TAP is a 70\nheterodimeric, ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter consisting of two polypeptide chains, TAP1 and 71\nTAP2 (Fig. 1a). Each subunit has three structural domains: an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0) 72\nthat interacts with other components of the larger peptide loading complex, a six transmembrane helical 73\ndomain (TMD) that forms the translocation pathway, and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD) that hydro-74\nlyzes ATP (Fig. 1a). The TMD0 domains facilitate MHC-I loading, but are not essential for TAP peptide 75\ntransport activity40,41. The biochemical properties of the recombinant protein were assayed in the pres-76\nence or absence of a 9-mer peptide containing residues RRYQKSTEL. This peptide has been well-char-77\nacterized as a substrate transported via TAP29 and presented on the cell surface by HLA-B2742. Thus, it is 78\ndesignated as the b27 peptide in this work. In the absence of peptide, TAP hydrolyzes ATP at a specific 79\nturnover rate of 2 per min (Fig. 1b,c). The b27 peptide stimulates ATP hydrolysis in a dose-dependent 80\nmanner (Fig. 1b) and, consistent with previous studies27\u201330, stimulation is abolished by blocking either the 81\nfree amino- or the carboxyl-termini (Fig. 1c). 82\nUsing cryo-EM, we determined seven structures of TAP in the absence and presence of peptides ranging 83\nfrom 7 to 14 residues long (Fig. 1d,e, and Extended Fig. 1-3). All structures were determined in the ab-84\nsence of ATP, as previous work showed that ATP reduces the affinity of peptides for TAP43. The highest 85\nquality maps were obtained with 9-mer peptides, followed by the apo, 8-mer, and 14-mer bound struc-86\ntures. Although the flexibility of the TAP1 NBD impacted the overall resolution, the densities for the TMDs 87\nand the bound peptides are well defined, permitting unambiguous assignment of the molecular interac-88\ntions between TAP and the corresponding peptide substrate (Fig. 1e, 2a, and Extended Fig 3). In the 89\npresence of the 7-mer peptide, which is shorter than the preferred minimum length for TAP, the structure 90\nexhibits greater heterogeneity, limiting the resolution to 5.1 \u00c5 (Extended Fig 1c). In all reconstructions, 91\namorphous densities corresponding to the TMD0 domains are visible only at a lower contour, indicating 92\nthat the TMD0 of both TAP subunits are flexible. 93\n94\nGlobally, all the structures exhibit a similar NBD-separated conformation with the peptide-translocation 95\npathway open to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1e). The largest degree of NBD separation is observed in the ab-96\nsence of peptide where the two ATP-binding sites are 53 \u00c5 apart. In the presence of peptides, the two 97\nhalves of TAP move closer towards each other; the most significant change occurs with the 8-mer peptide 98\n(26 \u00c5 narrower), and the least change is associated with the 14-mer peptide (18 \u00c5 narrower). 99\n100\nTwo different configurations of the TMDs are observed among the seven structures (Extended Fig. 4). 101\nFive structures exhibit a typical inward-facing conformation where the translocation pathway is fully 102\nsealed at the ER luminal side (Extended Fig. 4a). However, the structures obtained with the b27 (9-mer) 103\nand b27\" (7-mer) peptides deviate from this configuration (Extended Fig. 4b-c). Instead, they both display 104\na lateral opening that connects the translocation pathway to the membrane. The gap between the TM hel-105\nices is filled with lipid molecules, blocking peptide access to the ER lumen (Extended Fig. 4b,d). The oc-106\ncurrence of this lateral opening does not seem to be correlated with the length or sequence of the bound 107\npeptide. Furthermore, a similar lateral opening was previously observed in the structure of TAP stabilized 108\nby the viral inhibitor ICP4744,45. Whether this opening is an intrinsic step in the peptide transport cycle or 109\nmerely a reflection of structural flexibility in the absence of other members of the peptide loading complex 110\nremains a subject for future investigation. 111\n112 113 The 9-mer peptides bind in extended conformations parallel to the membrane 114 115 116 To understand how TAP recognizes peptide antigens, we first analyzed the structures of TAP in complex 117\nwith three 9-mer peptides (Fig. 2), which are optimal in length for binding22,23. These peptides, IL-118\nKEPVHGV (a2), RRYQKSTEL (b27), and QYDDAVYKL(c4), are natural products of the antigen pro-119\ncessing pathway being presented by the three representative MHC-I alleles, HLA-A246, HLA-B2742, and 120\nHLA-C447, respectively. 121\n122\nThe structures of the a2- and c4-bound TAP are essentially identical, evident by the overall root mean 123\nsquare deviation (rmsd) of 0.8 \u00c5. In contrast, the b27-bound structure exhibits a different TMDs configura-124\ntion as described (Extended Fig. 4). In all structures, the peptides are situated in a central cavity encir-125\ncled by TM 2-6 of both TAP1 and TAP2 (Fig. 2a-b). When viewed from a perspective perpendicular to the 126\nmembrane plane, each peptide stretches roughly 27 \u00c5 across the TM cavity (Fig. 2b). Interactions with 127\nTAP are concentrated at the N- and C- terminal ends, primarily involving main chain atoms of the peptide 128\n(Fig. 2c-f). Side chains at the first three positions and the last position also variably contact TAP, further 129\nenhancing binding in a sequence-dependent manner (Fig 2c-d). The central positions make few contacts, 130\nwhich are exclusively through side chain atoms. 131\n132\nDespite their sequence diversity, the three 9-mer peptides are stabilized in the peptide binding pocket by 133\na common set of interactions involving backbone atoms on separate ends of the peptide (Fig. 2e-f). 134\nThese interactions, including eight hydrogen bonds, a cation-p and two van der Waals\u2019 interactions, ena-135\nble sequence-independent binding. Specifically, at the N-terminal region, the free amino group of each 136\npeptide forms a cation-p interaction with W308 and two hydrogen bonds with E242 and D246 in TAP1 137\n(Fig. 2e-f). The carbonyl oxygen and amide at positions 1 and 3 are coordinated through hydrogen bonds 138\nby TAP1 R312 and Y309, respectively. Furthermore, TAP2 L377 forms van der Waals\u2019 interactions with 139\nthe N-terminus of all three peptides and R373 interacts with the main chain atoms in the a2 and c4 140\npeptides but not with the b27 peptide (Fig. 2c-d). In comparison, binding at the C-terminal end of the pep-141\ntide is dominated by residues from TAP2 (Fig. 2e,f). The terminal carboxyl group of all three peptides are 142\nengaged by TAP2 N269 and R273 via hydrogen bonds, as well as by longer-range electrostatic interac-143\ntions with TAP2 R210. The peptide terminal amide bond is stabilized by van der Waal\u2019s interactions with 144\nTAP2 L266 and hydrogen bonds with TAP2 R273 and TAP1 Y408. The latter residue, Y408, was previ-145\nously identified to interact with the C-terminal end of peptides in mutagenesis studies18,48. 146\n147\nAll backbone-binding residues on TAP1 and TAP2 are highly conserved among different species (Ex-148\ntended Fig. 5). To investigate their functional significance in a cellular context, we analyzed the surface 149\nexpression of MHC-I molecules in cells carrying different TAP variants (Fig. 2g and Extended Fig. 6a-b). 150\nIn TAP-knockout (KO) cells, MHC-I surface presentation is severely impaired, consistent with the essen-151\ntial role of TAP in providing peptide antigens to complete MHC-I folding. While rescue with wild-type TAP 152\n(WT) restores MHC-I surface expression, TAP mutants variably rescue transport depending on the posi-153\ntion mutated. Alanine mutations in the N-terminal binding residues, E242, D246, and R273, resulted in the 154\ngreatest defects in transport with a 50-60% decrease in surface MHC-I level relative to WT. On the other 155\nhand, eliminating the hydrogen bond between TAP1 Y309 and the third amide on the peptide resulted in a 156\nmodest 10% reduction. Mutating R373, which interacts with two out of the three peptides at position 2, 157\nhad no effect. Most strikingly, combining substitutions at the N- and C-terminal ends reduced MHC-I sur-158\nface expression to a level similar to that of the TAP KO cells. Loss of function was not due to reduced ex-159\npression or folding of TAP (Extended Fig. 6c-e). These data indicate that engaging the free amino and 160\ncarboxyl termini are critical for peptide binding to TAP. This principle holds true in the cellular context, 161\nwhere peptides with variable length and diverse sequences are available for MHC-I presentation. 162\n163\nThe N- and C-terminal binding pockets impose sequence preferences 164\n165\nThus far we have shown that TAP binds peptides primarily through interacting with the peptide backbone, 166\nindependent of its sequence. Nevertheless, earlier studies demonstrated that TAP does exhibit 167\npreferences for specific peptide sequences particularly at the N- and C- termini29,31,32,49. Such sequence 168\npreferences arise from the structural and electrostatic properties of the peptide-binding site (Fig. 3) 169\n170\nThe amino group of each peptide inserts into a deep pocket (the N-pocket) lined with charged and polar 171\nresidues from TAP1, including E242, D246, W308, and E301 (Fig. 2d and 3). The strong negatively 172\ncharged surface of the N-pocket and the narrow gate formed by TAP1 E301 and TAP2 R373 explain why 173\nthe free amino terminus of the peptide is important for high-affinity binding, why a positively charged 174\namino acid at the first position is preferable29, and why negatively charged and aromatic residues are dis-175\nfavored26,31 (Fig. 3). 176\n177\nThe C-terminus of the peptide docks into a pocket that differs substantially in size, depth, and electrostatic 178\nsurface potential from the N-pocket (Fig. 3). The C-pocket can be divided into two regions, a positively 179\ncharged surface where the terminal carboxyl group binds and a hydrophobic cleft that interacts with the 180\nside chain of the C-terminal residue. Previous studies have shown that peptides with a hydrophobic C-181\nterminal residue have a higher affinity for TAP in human, mouse, and the rat cimu alleles24,27,28. The rat 182\ncima allele is uniquely capable of transporting peptides with a C-terminal basic residue. This functional 183\npolymorphism can be attributed to a single amino acid difference in the C-pocket, where all residues are 184\nhighly conserved except for TAP2 M218 (Extended Fig. 5). In human TAP, M218 lines the hydrophobic 185\nregion of the C-pocket (Fig. 3, right panels). In the cima allele, this residue is replaced by a glutamate resi-186\ndue, which is positioned to form ionized hydrogen bond interactions with positively charged side chains at 187\nthe peptide C-terminus, thus allowing peptides with C-terminal basic residues to be transported. 188\n189\nA minimum of eight residues are necessary to engage N- and C-pockets concurrently 190\n191\nMany studies have demonstrated that peptides with fewer than eight amino acids are inefficient in com-192\npeting with model peptides or in being translocated into the ER24\u201326. This length threshold coincides with 193\nthat of MHC-I molecules, which cannot bind peptides shorter than eight residues7,50,51. To understand the 194\nmolecular basis of the minimum length requirement, we modified the b27 peptide to generate shorter 195\npeptides and analyzed how they differ from the parent 9-mer (Fig. 4). The 8-mer peptide (b27\u2019) was de-196\nvoid of the central lysine at position 5 and the two 7-mer peptides each lack an additional residue on ei-197\nther side of the lysine. Compared with b27, the 8-mer peptide increased the ATPase activity of TAP to a 198\nslightly greater extent (Fig. 4a). In contrast, neither 7-mer peptides stimulated ATP hydrolysis, suggesting 199\nthat the compromised function of the 7-mer peptides is likely attributable to their shorter length rather than 200\ntheir sequences. 201\n202\nThe structure shows that the 8-mer peptide anchors to TAP at the N- and C-termini through the same in-203\nteractions as b27 (Fig. 4b and Extended Fig. 7). The overall length of the peptide is shortened by 2 \u00c5, 204\nleading to a minor contraction of the translocation pathway (Extended Fig. 7a-b). Intriguingly, the TM heli-205\nces are arranged similarly to those of the a2- and c4-bound structures (Extended Fig. 7a), rather than that 206\nof the b27-bound structure (Extended Fig. 7b). Consequently, the lateral opening seen in the b27 9-mer is 207\nno longer present, and the ER luminal gate is entirely closed (Extended Fig. 7d). 208\n209\nIn the presence of the 7-mer peptide RRYSTEL (b27\u201d), the conformation of TAP was heterogenous. The 210\nfinal reconstruction, determined at 5 \u00c5 resolution, closely resembles that of the b27 9-mer bound confor-211\nmation (Extended Fig. 1c, 7e), with a clearly visible lateral opening filled by lipid molecules (Extended Fig. 212\n7d). Despite the limited resolution, two distinct densities are apparent within the translocation pathway, 213\neach attached to either the N- or C-pockets, respectively (Fig. 4c). The density at the N-pocket is clear 214\nenough to model the first six residues of the peptide (Extended Fig. 7f), and the density at the C-pocket 215\ncan accommodate five residues of the peptide (Extended Fig. 7g). The first three (RRY) and last two resi-216\ndues (EL) of the b27'' 7-mer peptide within the N- and C-terminal binding sites, respectively, bind in the 217\nsame way as the b27 peptide (Fig. 4d). The structures of the remainder of the peptide outside of the ter-218\nminal binding sites diverges. These data suggest that at the concentration of the cryo-EM sample (150 219\n\u00b5M), two 7-mer peptides can bind to TAP at the same time. Alternatively, our reconstruction may repre-220\nsent two structures, one with a peptide attached to the N-pocket and the other with a peptide at the C-221\npocket. In either case, the structural analysis indicates that peptides with less than eight residues cannot 222\nspan the entire translocation pathway to engage both binding pockets, thus explaining their lower affinity 223\nfor TAP and inefficiency in competing with longer peptides. 224\n225\nA longer peptide engages both binding pockets while the central positions are flexible 226\n227\nTAP most efficiently transports peptides 8-12 amino acids in length, but the transport of longer peptides 228\nalso has been reported23,25,27. To understand how TAP interacts with longer peptides, we determined the 229\nstructure of TAP in complex with the 14-mer b35 peptide, LPAVVGLSPGEQEY (Fig. 1e, Fig. 5, Extended 230\nFig. 1e). The b35 peptide contains a proline at position 2, which is supposed to render it a poor substrate 231\nfor TAP52,53. Nevertheless, this peptide is presented on the cell surface by HLA-B35 in a TAP-dependent 232\nmanner, suggesting that it is processed through the canonical antigen processing pathway54. 233\n234\nIn the presence of the 14-mer peptide, the NBDs are separated at a distance intermediate to that of the 235\napo state and 9-mer peptide bound TAP (Fig. 1e). Densities corresponding to the first four and the last 236\nfour residues of the peptide are clearly observed, but largely absent for the middle six residues (Fig. 5a). 237\nAlthough the b35 peptide engages both binding pockets, important local differences exist compared to 238\nhow the 9-mer peptides bind TAP (Fig. 5b-c). Specifically, at the N-terminal end, the presence of proline at 239\nthe second position results in a different backbone conformation that eliminates the hydrogen bonds with 240\nD242, E246 and R312 (Fig. 5b). This structural variation is in line with previous findings that prolines are 241\nnot well-tolerated at position 229,53. Conversely, the C-terminal end of the b35 peptide makes stronger 242\ncontacts with TAP compared to the three 9-mer peptides (Fig. 5c). The carboxyl group is situated within 3 243\n\u00c5 from R210, forming a salt bridge instead of long-range electrostatic interactions. Additionally, instead of 244\na leucine or valine, the last residue in b35 is a tyrosine, which forms a hydrogen bond with TAP2 N262, a 245\nresidue previously shown to affect substrate selectivity38 (Fig. 5c). This example supports the conclusion 246\nfrom earlier studies that detrimental effects from unfavorable residues can be counterbalanced by favora-247\nble residues in other positions26,52. 248\n249\n250\nDiscussion 251\nIn this study, we show that TAP holds each peptide at its two ends, leaving the central positions sus-252\npended in a large transmembrane cavity. Interactions primarily occur through hydrogen bonds with the 253\nbackbone atoms of the peptide, although side chains also play a minor role. By concentrating the interac-254\ntions to the terminal positions and the peptide main-chain atoms, TAP can bind peptides of wide variability 255\nin sequence and size. However, a minimum of eight residues in the fully extended conformation is re-256\nquired to bridge the distance between the two binding pockets. Consequently, the lower limit for peptide 257\nlength is set at eight residues, which aligns with the selection criteria for MHC-I. These principles allow 258\nTAP to function as a molecular caliper, selecting peptides of the appropriate length while accommodating 259\nvast sequence diversity for MHC-I presentation. 260\n261\nThe structural data are consistent with many previous studies. For example, the peptide preferences ob-262\nserved in biochemical studies26,29,31,32 can be explained by the configuration of the binding pockets. The 263\ndistance between the N and C termini of the bound peptide varies in a narrow range between 25-28 \u00c5, 264\ncomparable to the distances determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and double electron\u2013electron 265\nresonance experiments33,55. And finally, many peptide-binding residues, identified through mutagenesis 266\nand crosslinking experiments34\u201339, are either in direct contact or near the bound peptide (Extended Fig. 5). 267\n268\nRecently, the structure of a lysosomal peptide transporter TAPL has been determined in multiple confor-269\nmations48. TAPL exhibits approximately 40% sequence identity with TAP, and has broader substrate se-270\nquence and length preferences56,57. Although the density of the peptide was inadequate to define molecu-271\nlar interactions, the general position of the bound peptide closely resembles those observed in TAP (Ex-272\ntended Fig 8a-c). However, unlike TAP, TAPL is a homodimer lacking two distinct binding pockets that 273\nwould enforce a specific N- to C-terminal orientation. Thus, it is possible that the cryo-EM density ob-274\nserved in TAPL reflects a mixture of two orientations of the bound peptide. 275\n276\nAnother ABC transporter, the Thermus thermophilus multidrug-resistance proteins A and B (TmrAB), has 277\nbeen used in several studies as a model system to understand the molecular mechanism of human 278\nTAP58,59. TmrAB and TAP share approximately 30% sequence identity. Cryo-EM analysis of TmrAB re-279\nvealed density in the transmembrane cavity that was interpreted as the peptide substrate59. Structural su-280\nperposition indicates that this density is proximal to but separate from the peptides bound to TAP (Ex-281\ntended Fig. 8d-f), indicating that TmrAB interacts with its substrate through a mechanism distinct from that 282\nof TAP. 283\n284\nFour of the peptides used in this study have also been co-crystallized with MHC-I42,46,47,54, providing an 285\nopportunity to compare directly their recognition by TAP and MHC-I. Peptides bind to MHC-I in a groove 286\nbetween two a-helices atop a b-sheet. Like TAP, the interactions primarily occur at the two ends of the 287\npeptide, involving main chain atoms of the bound peptide. Also similar to TAP, the binding sites in MHC-I 288\nfor the peptide\u2019s free N- and C-termini are ~25 \u00c5 apart, thereby imposing a minimum size limit of 8 resi-289\ndues for the bound peptide. The major difference from TAP is the involvement of the peptide side chains. 290\nMHC-I makes extensive interactions with the side chains of the bound peptide. Certain positions serve as 291\nanchors by burying their side chains deep inside binding pockets specific for a particular MHC-I allele. 292\nThus, side chain interactions not only contribute to overall affinity but also dictate allele-specific selectivity 293\nin peptide binding60\u201363. In contrast, TAP does not utilize any specific anchoring residues. Favorable side 294\nchain interactions can enhance peptide affinity, but unlike MHC-I, they are not essential for binding. 295\n296\nThe common and unique structural features of TAP and MHC-I correlate with their functional properties. 297\nGiven the challenge of achieving both high affinity and promiscuity simultaneously, TAP has evolved to be 298\npromiscuous, accommodating greater sequence diversity, while the affinities for peptides can vary over a 299\nwide range26,29. In contrast, an individual MHC-I molecule prioritizes affinity to prevent dissociation of the 300\npeptide on the cell surface. The diversity of peptide presentation is addressed through genetic polymor-301\nphism to ensure protection at the population level. Through this delicate balance, TAP provides a com-302\nprehensive peptide reservoir for the numerous MHC-I alleles, while each MHC-I binds a peptide with high 303\naffinity to ensure immune fidelity. Such a coordinated mechanism enables us to anticipate peptide anti-304\ngens from an unpredictable and highly variable pathogenic landscape. 305\n306\n307 Acknowledgments 308\nWe thank Rui Yan and Zhiheng Yu at the HHMI Janelia Cryo-EM Facility and Mark Ebrahim, Johanna 309\nSotiris, and Honkit Ng at the Evelyn Gruss Lipper Cryo-EM Resource Center at Rockefeller University for 310\nassistance in electron microscopy data collection; Svetlana Mazel and Songyan Han at the Flow Cytome-311\ntry Resource Center at Rockefeller University for assistance in flow cytometry data collection; Kyaw Myo 312\nLwin for the TAP KO cells; and members from the Chen and Mackinnon laboratories for helpful discus-313\nsions.

HEK293S GnTI- cells (ATCC) were cultured in Freestyle 293 medium (GIBCO) 481 supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS at 37oC with 8% CO2 and 80% humidity. All cell lines were authenticated 482 by their respective suppliers. Cell lines were tested monthly for mycoplasma contamination by PCR using 483 a Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC) and verified to be negative. 484 485 Protein expression 486 487 Human TAP was expressed in HEK293S GnTI- cells based on a previously described protocol1. DNA 488 encode for TAP1 with a C-terminal PreScission Protease-cleavable GFP tag and for untagged TAP2 were 489 cloned into separate BacMam vectors to generate pEG TAP1-GFP and pEG TAP2, respectively. To co-490 express TAP1 and TAP2, the individual plasmids were combined via SphI and AvrII restriction sites in 491 pEG TAP1-GFP and via SphI and NheI restriction sites in pEG TAP2 to generate pEG TAP1-GFP/TAP2. 492 Bacmid carrying TAP was generated by transforming DH10Bac E. coli cells with the pEG TAP1-493 GFP/TAP2 vector. 494 495 Recombinant baculovirus was generated by transfecting Sf9 cells with bacmid using Cellfectin II 496 (ThermoFisher). Baculoviruses were harvested from Sf9 cell media by filtering through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter 497 and amplified three times before using for cell transduction. Proteins were expressed in HEK293S GnTI- 498 cells infected with 5% (v/v) of baculovirus at a density of 2.5-3.0 x 106 cells/ml. Cells were induced with 10 499 mM sodium butyrate 8-12 hours after infection and cultured at 30oC for another 48 hours. Cells were 500 harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80oC. 501 502 Protein purification 503 504 Cells were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.5 with KOH), 400 mM 505 KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 pepstatin A, 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 leupeptin, 506 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 aprotinin, 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 soy trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl 507 fluoride (PMSF) and 3 \u00b5g ml\u22121 DNase I. Cells were lysed by three passes through a high-pressure 508 homogenizer at 15,000 psi (Emulsiflex-C3; Avestin). Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by one 509 low speed spin at 4000g for 15 min at 4oC. The supernatant was subjected to a second round of 510 ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 4oC in a Type 45Ti rotor (Beckman) to pellet cell 511 membranes. Membranes were resuspended by manual homogenization in a dounce in lysis buffer 512 supplemented with 1% glycol-diosgenin (GDN) (Anatrace) and incubated for 1 hour at 4oC. The insoluble 513 fraction was removed by centrifugation at 75,000g for 30 min at 4oC and the supernatant was applied to 514 NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) conjugated with GFP nanobody pre-515 equilibrated in lysis buffer. After 1 hour, the resin was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer 516 containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.5 with KOH), 400 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01% GDN. 517 To cleave off the GFP tag, PreScission Protease was added to a final concentration of 0.35 mg ml\u22121 and 518 incubated for 12 hours at 4oC. The cleaved protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of wash buffer and 519 collected by passing through a Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (Cytiva) to remove the PreScission 520 Protease. The eluate was then concentrated using a 15 ml Amicon spin concentrator with a 100-kDa 521 molecular weight cutoff membrane (Millipore) and purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using 522 a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer containing 50 523 mM HEPES (pH 6.5 with KOH), 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.004% GDN. Peak fractions were pooled 524 using a 4 ml Amicon spin concentrator with a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane (Millipore) and 525 used immediately for grid preparation or hydrolysis measurements. 526 527 528 529\nCryo-EM grids preparation and data acquisition 530 531 TAP purified from gel filtration was concentrated to ~6 mg ml\u22121 and, where appropriate, incubated with 532 150 \u00b5M of the corresponding peptide on ice for 30 min. Grids were prepared by applying 3.5 \u00b5L of this 533 TAP/peptide mixture onto a glow discharged Quantifoil R0.6/1.0 400 mesh holey carbon Au grid with no 534 wait time. The grids were blotted for 3 sec with a blot force of 20 and plunged frozen into liquid ethane 535 using an FEI Mark IV Vitrobot at 6oC and 100% humidity. 536 537 All cryo-EM data were collected using a 300 kV Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped 538 with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector. All micrographs were collected using SerialEM2 in super-539 resolution mode. Data collection parameters for different samples are summarized in Extended Data 540\nTable 1. 541 542 Image processing 543 544 A similar strategy was employed for cryo-EM data processing for all datasets and a representative 545 flowchart is presented in Extended Fig. 2. Super-resolution image stacks were gain-normalized, binned 546 by 2, and corrected for beam-induced motion using MotionCor23. Contrast transfer functions parameters 547 were estimated using CTFFIND44. Subsequent data processing for all the datasets followed a similar 548 procedure. In general, particles were auto-picked from the motion-corrected micrographs with crYOLO 549 using its general model5, extracted in RELION6, and imported into cryoSPARC7. The picked particles were 550 subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification, and the resulting particles were subjected to ab initio 551 reconstruction with three classes. One class resembled an empty micelle while the other two classes 552 resembled TAP, but with varying continuous density for one of the NBDs. Non-uniform refinement of the 553 best class with the most complete density for the NBDs resulted in a medium-resolution reconstruction of 554 TAP with well-resolved transmembrane helices and NBD2, but with an invisible NBD1. To improve the 555 density of NBD1, all the particles from 2D classification were subjected to iterative rounds of 556 heterogenous refinement using the best reconstruction and a decoy reconstruction with a disordered 557 NBD1 as input models. The resulting particles that gave reconstructions with a complete NBD1 were then 558 subjected to tandem non-uniform refinement followed by local refinement with a protein mask excluding 559 the micelle. These particles were imported into Relion using the csparc2star.py script8 and subjected to 560 Bayesian particle polishing9 and refined again in cryoSPARC. FSC curves were generated in cryoSPARC, 561 and resolutions were reported based on the 0.143 criterion. Masking and B-factor sharpening were 562 determined automatically in cryoSPARC during refinement. 563 564 Model building and refinement 565 566 The sharpened and unsharpened maps from local refinement were used for model building. The initial 567 model was obtained by docking individual domains of the published structure of ICP47-inhibited 568 TAP1/TAP210 into the cryo-EM maps using UCSF ChimeraX11. Models were then manually adjusted using 569 Coot where necessary. The models were then iteratively edited and refined in Coot12, ISOLDE13, and 570 PHENIX14. Regions with poor density were removed such as the TMD0 domains or modeled as 571 polyalanine such as the TAP1 NBD. In the case of the TAP2 NBD, a polyalanine homology model based 572 on the crystal structure of mouse TAP1 NBD was first rigid body fit into the density using ChimeraX, 573 manually inspected, and adjusted where necessary. Then, side chains were manually added and refined 574 in Coot. Residues 632-654 and 660-666 in the TAP2 NBDs were modeled as polyalanine. The quality of 575 the final models were evaluated by MolProbity15. Refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data 576\nTable 1. 577 578 Analysis of cellular TAP levels 579 580 HEK293S GnTI- cells grown in a 6-well plate were infected with 5% P1 baculovirus at 37oC for 36 hours. 581 Cells were harvested by resuspension in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0 with KOH) and 582 150 mM KCl and spun down in 1.5 ml tubes for 5 min at 4,000g at 4oC. The cell pellets were resuspended 583 in 1 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 1% GDN and incubated for 60 min at 4oC. Cell lysates were 584 clarified by centrifugation at 20,000g for 2 x 30 min at 4oC. Supernatants were immediately used for 585\nanalysis by fluorescent size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) or SDS-PAGE. FSEC analyses were 586 performed using a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with SEC buffer. SDS-587 PAGE analyses were performed at 180V for 75 min using precast 4-20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gradient 588 gels (ThermoFisher). In-gel fluorescence was detected using a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). 589 590 ATP hydrolysis measurements 591 592 Steady-state ATP hydrolysis activity was measured using a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-593 coupled assay. Purified TAP was diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5M in freshly prepared reaction 594 buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0 with KOH), 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.004% (w/v) 595 digitonin, 60 \u00b5g ml\u22121 pyruvate kinase (Roche), 32 \u00b5g ml\u22121 lactate dehydrogenase (Roche), 9 mM 596 phosphoenolpyruvate and 150 \u00b5M NADH. Peptide substrates were added to a final concentration of 20 597 \u00b5M unless specified otherwise. 30\u00b5l aliquots were dispensed into Corning 384-well Black/Clear Flat 598 Bottom Polystyrene NBS Microplates, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 3 mM ATP. NADH 599 consumption was measured by monitoring the rate of NADH fluorescence depletion at \u028eex = 340 nm and 600 \u028eem = 445 nm at 28oC using an Infinite M1000 microplate reader (Tecan). Data were converted to ATP 601 turnover with an NADH standard curve. Technical replicates were measured in parallel from the same 602 protein preparation on the same day and biological replicates were measured from different protein 603 preparations from different cells on different days. 604 605 Generation of stable TAP knockout cells 606 607 TAP-knockout clonal cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing16. gRNAs targeting 608 exon1 of human TAP1 and TAP2 were cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 vector. The resulting plasmids were 609 transfected into HEK293S GnTI- cells and selected using 1 \u00b5g ml\u22121 puromycin for 3 days. Puromycin-610 resistant cells were screened for loss of cell surface MHC-I by flow cytometry and sorted into single cells. 611 After expansion, clones were genotyped by Sanger sequencing. 612 613 Flow cytometry analysis of MHC-I cell surface expression 614 615 MHC-I surface expression was analyzed using an allophycocyanin (APC)-coupled antibody W6/32 616 (eBioscience), which recognizes an epitope shared among all HLA-A,B,C alleles. HEK293S GnTI- cells 617 grown in a 96-well plate were infected with 5% P1 baculovirus encoding wild-type TAP1-GFP/TAP2, a 618 variant, or GFP alone at 37oC for 36 hours. Cells were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l FACS blocking buffer 619 (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma)) and 620 centrifuged at 400g for 5 min at 25oC. Cells were resuspended in FACS blocking buffer supplemented 621 with antibody added at 5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 and incubated for 30 min at 4oC in the dark. Subsequently, the cells were 622 washed two times with FACS blocking buffer. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in FACS buffer 623 (PBS supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide and counted using an Attune NxT 624 Flow Cytometer (ThermoFisher). Gating for live cells with moderate levels of the GFP were used to 625 compare MHC-I expression. Data were analyzed using FCS Express (De Novo Software). Technical 626 replicates were measured in parallel from different cells on the same day and biological replicates were 627 measured from different cells on different days. 628 629 Data quantification and statistical analysis 630 631 All the details of the data and statistical analysis can be found in the figure legends and methods. All data 632 values are presented as mean and standard errors. Statistical significance was assessed by a one-way 633 analysis of variance relative to the wild-type using Graphpad Prism 9. 634 635 Figure preparation 636 637 Cryo-EM maps and atomic models depictions were generated using UCSF ChimeraX11. Maps colored by 638 local resolution were generated using cryoSPARC. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using 639 Clustal Omega17. Surface interface analysis was performed using PDBePISA18. Graphs and associated 640\nstatistics were prepared using GraphPad Prism 9. Software used in this project was managed by 641 SBGrid19.
