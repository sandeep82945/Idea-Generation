1. **Investigate the effects of different plasma parameters on the inactivation of Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium meridionale.** This could include varying the power, frequency, and gas flow rate of the plasma jet. This would help to optimize the plasma treatment process and improve its efficacy against these fungi.


2. **Evaluate the effects of plasma treatment on the quality of barley grains.** This could include measuring changes in the nutritional value, germination rate, and malting quality of the grains. This would help to determine the potential impact of plasma treatment on the overall quality of barley grains.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms by which plasma treatment inactivates Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium meridionale.** This could involve studying the effects of plasma treatment on the cell wall, membrane, and DNA of the fungi. This would help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of plasma inactivation and identify potential targets for future antifungal therapies.


4. **Explore the potential of plasma treatment for controlling Fusarium head blight (FHB) in the field.** This could involve applying plasma treatment to barley plants in the field and evaluating its impact on FHB incidence and severity. This would help to determine the feasibility of using plasma treatment as a novel FHB control strategy.


5. **Investigate the potential of plasma treatment for decontaminating barley grains contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins.** This could involve applying plasma treatment to barley grains contaminated with DON and D3G and evaluating its impact on the levels of these mycotoxins. This would help to determine the potential of plasma treatment for reducing the risk of mycotoxin contamination in barley grains.
