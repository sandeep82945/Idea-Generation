Expansion to Other Herbal Species and Geographical Variations: Investigate the application of the developed HPLC and TLC fingerprinting methods to a broader range of medicinal plants, including those not native to Latvia. Additionally, compare the chemical fingerprints of the same species grown in different geographical locations to assess the impact of environmental factors on chemical compositions.

Integration with Advanced Spectroscopic Techniques: Combine chromatographic fingerprinting with advanced spectroscopic techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or Mass Spectrometry (MS) for a more comprehensive analysis of the chemical constituents in medicinal plants. This could enhance the accuracy of identifying compounds and understanding their biological activities.

Longitudinal Study on Stability and Shelf-life of Herbal Extracts: Conduct a longitudinal study to evaluate the stability and shelf-life of herbal extracts over time, using the fingerprinting methods developed. This could provide valuable information for the herbal supplement industry regarding optimal storage conditions and expiration dating.

Exploration of the Synergistic Effects of Mixed Extracts: Further investigate the therapeutic potential and synergistic effects of mixed herbal extracts identified in the study. This could lead to the development of new herbal formulations with enhanced efficacy for health promotion and disease prevention.

Standardization and Quality Control in the Herbal Medicine Supply Chain: Utilize the fingerprinting techniques for standardization and quality control throughout the herbal medicine supply chainâ€”from raw material sourcing to final product formulation. This could include developing a database of fingerprints for authenticated herbal materials to combat adulteration and ensure the quality and safety of herbal products.
