Digital technologies and media have become more and more important and have found their way into nearly all private and work environments. Communication situations have been largely relocated to virtual spaces. One of these scenarios is digital job interviews. Job interviews are usually\u2014also in the non-digital world\u2014perceived as stressful and associated with biological stress responses. We here present and evaluate a newly developed laboratory stressor that is based on a digital job interview-scenario.\nMethods: N = 45 healthy people participated in the study (64.4% female; mean age: 23.2 \u00b1 3.6 years; mean body mass index = 22.8 \u00b1 4.0 kg/m2). Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol were assessed as measures for biological stress responses. Furthermore, perceived stress was rated at the time points of the saliva samplings. The job interviews lasted between 20 and 25min. All materials, including instructions for the experimenter (i.e., the job interviewer) and the data set used for statistical analysis, as well as a multimodal data set, which includes further measures, are publicly available.\nResults: Typical subjective and biological stress-response patterns were found, with peak sAA and perceived stress levels observed immediately after the job interviews and peak cortisol concentrations 5min afterwards. Female participants experienced the scenario as more stressful than male participants. Cortisol peaks were higher for participants who experienced the situation as a threat in comparison to participants who experienced it as a challenge. Associations between the strength of the stress response with further person characteristics and psychological variables such as BMI, age, coping styles, and personality were not found.\nDiscussion: Overall, our method is well-suited to induce biological and perceived stress, mostly independent of person characteristics and psychological variables. The setting is naturalistic and easily implementable in standardized laboratory settings.\nKEYWORDS\ndigital stress, job interview, stress induction, stress test, salivary alpha-amylase, cortisol, threat, challenge\n1. Introduction\nStress is an ubiquitous phenomenon, which is accompanied by the subjective feeling of being stressed as well as a variety of biological stress responses. The biological stress response is complex and involves several stress systems. In acute stress situations, the two most important ones are the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which is a part of the autonomous nervous system and the activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis (Fulford and Harbuz, 2005).\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nSNS responses occur instantaneously, and peak levels can be found during and immediately after stressors. The SNS response is associated with the so-called fight-or-flight response (Selye, 1950). It can be assessed by means of several markers, of which one is the assessment of the enzyme salivary alpha-amylase (Nater and Rohleder, 2009). In contrast, HPA axis responses show a slower time course. Usually, peak cortisol concentrations can be found approximately 20min after the end of typical (e.g., socially evaluative) stressors. Cortisol levels can be easily measured in saliva or blood samples (Vining et al., 1983; Putignano et al., 2001).\nThe overall stress response is complex and strongly depends on the nature of the stressor (so-called specificity hypothesis; Kemeny, 2003). A further crucial factor is person himself/herself and his/her appraisal of the situation (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984, 1987). Stressors perceived as a threat usually lead to strong biological stress responses in contrast to stressors perceived as a challenge (Kemeny, 2003).\nFor conducting research on biological stress responses, standardized laboratory stress tests are needed. Popular ones are the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum et al., 1993), the socially evaluative cold-pressor test (SECPT; Schwabe et al., 2008; Becker et al., 2019), or the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST; Dedovic et al., 2005). However, some of these stressors have the drawback that they are only partially realistic. Moreover, they are personnelintensive, and digital implementation is difficult or not feasible in some cases (e.g., when the task is to put your hand in ice water as in the case of the SECPT). Therefore, new laboratory stressors that are more similar to common field stressors, that simulate naturalistic settings, and that can be implemented in an online setting, are needed. Nevertheless, if a setting is transferred to the virtual space, the question remains open whether stress responses are triggered and therefore evaluation studies are needed.\nDue to increased digitalization, modern stressors are developing. Since the pandemic, which started in 2019, private and working life often takes place virtually. Online meetings and communication tools are widespread. Not only routine work was shifted to the virtual world, but also less frequent situations such as short-term agreements and negotiations. Job interviews, e.g., are usually\u2014also in the analog world\u2014perceived as stressful and can lead to biological stress responses (Budnick et al., 2019). Digitalization of this setting (i.e., job interviews) has the advantage of being cost-efficient, flexible, and standardizable across many applicants. In a pilot study, we have already proved the feasibility of setting-up a realistic and stressful job interview-scenario in the laboratory (Heimerl et al., 2022a).\nIn this study, we aimed to develop a standardized laboratory stressor, which was based on a digital job interview-scenario. We here present the protocol of our setting and an evaluation of our procedure. All materials are freely available for other researchers (see 11). Our objective was 3-fold: First, we developed the setting and provided a detailed description of the materials. Second, we conducted an evaluation study to investigate whether our scenario, indeed, induces stress (of the SNS, the HPA axis, and perceived stress). Third, we tested for potential associations between the strength of the stress responses and person characteristics [e.g., age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and psychological variables such as personality traits and coping styles]."

Prior to the actual experiment (day 1), participants sent their curriculum vitae (CV) to the experimenters and filled out an online survey, which included questions about demographic data, their experience with previous job interviews, and psychological questionnaires (e.g., coping styles and personality traits; 2.3). On the day of the experiment (day 2), participants came to our laboratory. First, the saliva collection procedure was introduced, and the first saliva sample (s0) was taken. After this, participants were equipped with an eye tracker and a finger-clip pulse sensor (Further recordings; 2.3.4). Then, the participants were asked about their dream job, which they would apply for at the job interview, and they were seated in front of a computer.\nThe preparation phase lasted about 15min, and participants were instructed to prepare for the job interview and to take notes if necessary. After the end of the preparation phase, the next saliva sample (s1) was taken. The actual job interview started afterward on the computer screen in front of the participants and lasted about 20\u201325min (see The job interview-scenario for further details on the job interviews; 2.2.2). The interviewer sat in another room and was hidden from the participant until the job interview started. The job interview was conducted via Zoom. Immediately after the job interview, the next saliva sample (s2) was taken. After this, participants were interviewed about their experiences and emotions during the job interview (Interviews preceding the job interviews). Further saliva samples were taken 5 (s3), 20 (s4), and 35 (s5) min after s2. The time course of the general procedure is shown in Figure 1."

If necessary, sphericity violations (determined byMauchly\u2019s test of sphericity; Mauchly, 1940) were corrected by adjusting the degrees of freedom with the procedure by Greenhouse and Geisser (1959). T-tests for dependent samples were used for post hoc pairwise comparisons, if needed. Cohen\u2019s d was used as a measure for effect size.\nFor the investigation of potential sex differences and differences between participants who experienced the situation as a threat vs. as a challenge, further rmANOVAs were calculated for all three variables (sAA, cortisol, and perceived stress) with sex or threat vs. challenge as a between-subjects factor. Similar analyses were conducted for female participants who reported the use of contraceptives and for participants with the same vs. a different sex than the interviewer.\nTo test whether the stress responses were associated with ln(age), ln(BMI), number of previous job interviews, time of day, coping, perceived stress during the last month, personality, trait anxiety or depression, Pearson\u2019s correlations between these variables and the difference between the maximum sAA, cortisol, and perceived stress level and the value at s1 were calculated and tested for significance.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nAn adjusted alpha level of 0.05/3 = 0.017 was used for all analyses because three main outcome variables (sAA, cortisol, and perceived stress) were evaluated."

We decided to use a digital job interview-scenario. A comprehensive procedure was developed, which lasted about 20\u201325min and was individually adopted to the participant, i.e., involving individual questions based on the participant\u2019s dream job and his/her strengths and weaknesses. The job interviews triggered typical subjective and biological stress responses, including an increase in perceived stress and sAA levels which peaked immediately after the interviews, as well as an increase in cortisol levels with maximum levels about 5min later. Sex differences were found for perceived stress, i.e., female participants experienced the scenario as more stressful than male participants. Cortisol levels were higher for participants who experienced the situation as a threat in comparison to participants who experienced it as a challenge."

            "heading": "4.2. Discussion of main findings",
            "text": "Overall, our findings support that digital job interviews were associated with biological and subjective stress responses. The time\npoint of the maximum levels for sAA and perceived stress (i.e., immediately after the job interview) was expected regarding the fast time course of SNS responses. However, peak cortisol levels already occurred 5min later, which was earlier than expected based on our experience with further stressors and which are usually reported (e.g., Becker and Rohleder, 2019). One reason may be that the participants were already stressed in the anticipation of the stressor. The relatively high baseline levels are in favor of this explanation. This is also one important difference between our stress test and typical laboratory stressors that can be found in the literature. Our participants knew in advance that they will take part in a selection interview and had the chance (although this was not introduced) to prepare themselves for the appointment. Furthermore, the interviews which were conducted after the job interviews may have altered the HPA axis response and may be another reason for the untypical cortisol time course.\nSex differences in stress responses have also been reported previously. Usually, stronger HPA axis responses are found formale participants than for female participants (Kudielka et al., 2009). This effect was not significant in our study, but on a descriptive level, cortisol levels pointed in the same direction (i.e., they were higher for male than for female participants). Our finding of higher perceived stress during the interviews for female participants may be affected by social desirability. Social-desirability bias is genderspecific and has been found to be stronger in female participants\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nthan in male participants (Chung and Monroe, 2003; Dalton and Ortegren, 2011).\nIn TSST studies (Kirschbaum et al., 1993), it has been found that stronger responses occur in the presence of an opponent sex experimenter (Goodman et al., 2017). In our study, we found an association in the opposite direction with higher perceived stress levels when the experimenter (i.e., the interviewer) had the same sex as the participant. Again, this finding may be biased by social desirability. Moreover, although our scenario has some similarities with the TSST (which also includes a presentation of the participant in front of a jury, which is a scenario similar to job interviews), there are some differences. The job interview-scenario in our study was more naturalistic and more specifically adjusted to the individual participant than in typical TSST studies or other standardized stress tests.\nOur study also supports the well-known finding that especially threatening rather than challenging stressors lead to strong biological stress responses (Kemeny, 2003). Appraisal processes are associated with coping styles (Folkman, 2020). Associations between stress responses and coping have been reported previously (Bohnen et al., 1991; Janson and Rohleder, 2017), which could not be supported by our data. We conclude that for our scenario, the threat vs. challenge distinction was the more appropriate measure than the distinction between task-oriented, emotion-focused, and avoidance-oriented coping styles.\nMoreover, we tested whether the strength of the stress response is associated with personality traits, but we did not find any association. Recent research has highlighted the importance of the personality traits extraversion and neuroticism in the context of the stress response (Vollrath, 2001). One reason that we could not support this assumption may be that the association has been masked by a third factor such as self-efficacy (Ebstrup et al., 2011), which we did not assess in our study. Further research is needed to fully understand these important relations, and data from several studies should be aggregated (Pruessner et al., 1997)."

            "heading": "4.3. Limitations and future research",
            "text": "One limitation of our study is the mean age of our participants who were young adults in most cases. Data from older participants had to be excluded from analysis based on statistical criteria although we did not make any restrictions on participants\u2019 age during the selection process. However, in future research, our scenario should be evaluated in an older sample. Furthermore, the level of education was overall high, and future research should focus on a broader range of educational levels and occupations. Moreover, all participants were either employees or students and, therefore, the procedure must be evaluated in an unemployed sample. Additionally, further factors, which may be associated with the stress response such as the participants\u2019 cognitive functioning (Grimm et al., 2021) or selfefficacy (Ebstrup et al., 2011), should be assessed in future studies. Despite these limitations, the characteristics of participants who took part in our study is comparable to populations that have been evaluated in typical laboratory studies on acute\nstress responses, in which typical stress tests have been used (Supplementary material 2).\nIn this article, we reported analyses with respect to the most important outcome variables which are usually reported in research on acute stress responses (i.e., sAA as a SNS measure, cortisol as a marker for HPA axis activity, and perceived stress levels as a marker for subjective stress perception). However, as described in the Introduction (1), the acute stress response is complex, and a variety of stress measures is conceivable (see Becker et al., 2022a for an overview). Besides the outcomes, that we reported here, we collected and analyzed further stress measures such as heart rate, movements, and pupil size (Heimerl et al., 2022a), and used standardized interviews to assess participants\u2019 emotions during the job interviews (Heimerl et al., 2023). Therefore, we have already covert a wide range of measures. Merely, it was not possible to collect measures of immune system activity, which reflects a further, much slower reactive, biological stress system. However, especially in the working context, this may be important for employees\u2019 long-term health (Kaltenegger et al., 2021, 2023).\nAnother direction for future research is to investigate whether the same stress response patterns can be found in a similar, but non-digital scenario. Besides the further evaluation of the here proposed method as a digital stress test, the application could be used for further purposes such as being the basis of job interview trainings, which can also be designed as digital applications (Gebhard et al., 2014). Overall, job interview trainings are important because stress during the selection process can negatively impact the outcome (Campion et al., 1997). Our scenario may be well-suited for practicing this important situation. Virtual job interview-trainings can increase performance during the interview, and may therefore increase hiring chances (Smith et al., 2021). A first prototype which is based on our job interviewscenario has already been developed in our group (Heimerl et al., 2022b). In future studies, this system will be further developed and evaluated (e.g., with respect to perceived stress and biological stress responses)."
