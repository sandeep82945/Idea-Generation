Mononuclear and bis(telluride) complexes, namely (PNP)M(Te)2 (M = V; Nb, 3; Ta, 4; PNP\u2212 = N[2-PiPr2-4-methylphenyl]2), are reported herein including structural and spectroscopic data. Whereas the known complex (PNP)V(Te)2 can be readily prepared from the trivalent precursor (PNP)VCl2, two equiv. of tellurolate, and elemental Te partially solubilized with PMe3, complex 3 can also be similarly obtained following the same procedure but with or without a reductant, Na/NaCl. Complex 4 on the other hand is formed from the addition of four equiv. of\ntellurolate to (PNP)TaF4. Having access to a triad of (PNP)M(Te)2 systems for group 5 metals has allowed us to compare them using a combination of theory and spectroscopy including Te-L1 edge XANES data."

Unfortunately, the respective low-valent niobium or tantalum hypothetical bis or trisalkyl complexes are inherently unstable, and in the case of Nb, these ligands readily undergo disproportionation and/or b-hydrogen abstraction/hydrogen elimination reactions10 resulting in the bis(alkylidene) complex, (PNP)Nb(]CHtBu)2.10b Therefore, we decided to explore a systematic approach to delivering the Te atom that would work irrespective of the oxidation state of the metal since the stability of group 5 transition metal halide precursors tend to differ depending on their periodic trends. For instance, VIII chloride (e.g., VCl3(THF)3) is a common starting material, whereas NbCl4(THF)2/NbCl5 and TaCl5 are routinely used for heavier congeners. Inspired by the decomposition of M(TeR)n to [MTe]n from solid state thermolysis,11 we hypothesized that terminal metal bis(telluride) ligands could likewise be assembled via the elimination of telluroethers,11a,b,12 akin to how Arnold and co-workers prepared a Ta]Te mono(telluride) complex using silyltelluroether as the leaving group.12e\nHerein we demonstrate how an easily prepared tellurolate salt [Li(THF)TeCH2SiMe3]x, can be an effective Te-atom transfer reagent not only to VIII, but also to NbIV and TaV halide precursors. Our approach demonstrates that low or high-valent precursors, which are generally more common for the lighter or heavier group 5 metals, respectively, can all be adequate reagents for the assembly of the bis(telluride) motif when using [Li(THF)TeCH2SiMe3]x and if needed, an appropriate oxidant or reductant."

Despite no single-crystal X-ray diffraction (sc-XRD) data for 1, NMR spectroscopic analysis of the isolated product\nScheme 1 Synthesis of tellurolate salts and the solid-state structure of the discrete tellurolate [Li(12-crown-4)2][TeCH2SiMe3] (2) with thermal ellipsoids at the 50% probability level and with H-atoms omitted for clarity.\n12278 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 12277\u201312282\ncorroborates its formation in 81% yield13 as a pale yellow residue (Scheme 1).\nTo obtain solid-state structural information by sc-XRD, we prepared the discrete salt, [Li(12-crown-4)2][TeCH2SiMe3] (2), in 78% yield via the addition of two equiv. of 12-crown-4 to the tellurolate solution at \u221235 \u00b0C (Scheme 1). Although sterically hindered aryl and silyl tellurolates are known,14 structurally characterized alkyl tellurolate is limited to just one example: dimeric [Li(TMEDA)TenBu]2,15 thus making [TeCH2SiMe3] \u2212 a rare example of a one coordinate alkyl tellurolate anion. The Te\u2013C bond distance in 2 (2.196(4) \u00c5) is similar to the dimeric [Li(TMEDA)TenBu]2 (2.191(4) \u00c5).15 A sharp\n125Te{1H} resonance was located for 1 at \u22121790 ppm (Fig. S6\u2020)14c whereas a broad resonance at \u2212569 ppm (Dn1/2 = 282 Hz) was found for 2 (Fig. S14\u2020).16 However, no 7Li\u2013125Te coupling was resolved in 1 (Fig. S7\u2020), which can be attributed to its uxional behavior in solution.16\nHaving the tellurolate 1 in hand, we turned our attention to independently making the bis(telluride) complex (PNP)V(Te)2 using the VIII dichloride precursor, (PNP)VCl2.17 Accessing (PNP) V(Te)2 directly from the dichloride precursor offers two advantages: (1) this circumvents the need to prepare the thermally unstable bisalkyl complex [(PNP)V(CH2\ntBu)2], which is known to not only activate N2,10a but also convert to the transient alkylidene [(PNP)V]CHtBu] that has been shown to intermolecularly activate C\u2013H bonds in C6H6,18 and (2) avoids the cumbersome synthetic route involving the reaction of [(PNP)V(CH2\ntBu)2] with elemental Te under a static vacuum at 90 \u00b0C for four days.7 However, in order to convert VIII to VV, Te (solubilized with a catalytic amount of PMe3) is required as a two-electron oxidant. Treatment of (PNP)VCl2 with two equiv. of 1 in the presence of Te/PMe3 for 16 hours resulted in the gradual formation of (PNP)V(Te)2 which could be isolated from the mixture in 73% yield as a dark green, and highly insoluble material in most common organic solvents.\nUnlike V, Nb poses a challenge since the putative trivalent precursor \u201c(PNP)NbCl2\u201d is unstable.10b As a result we used instead the NbIV precursor (PNP)NbCl310c under similar conditions in combination with tellurolate 1, but in the presence of a reductant. Accordingly, treatment of (PNP)NbCl3 with two equiv. of 1,19 in the presence of Te/PMe3 and one equiv. of Na/\nScheme 2 Synthesis of the bis(tellurides) with the respective metal halide precursor to form complexes (PNP)M(Te)2 (M = V; Nb, 3; Ta, 4).

We found later that complex 3 could also be prepared using instead 3 equiv. of 1, and in the presence of Te/PMe3 in 57% yield (Scheme 2). Additionally, formation of Te(CH2SiMe3)2 20 is conrmed in both reactions by 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S24 and S25\u2020).13\nAnalogous to Arnold's construction of a terminal mono(telluride) ligand onto TaV dihalide,12e one should intuitively conceive the assembly of a bis(telluride) motif using the appropriate TaV tetrahalide precursor. Conveniently, Ozerov and co-workers have reported a TaV starting material, namely (PNP)TaF4.21 Treating (PNP)TaF4 with 4 equiv. of 1 in THF over 16 hours at room temperature resulted in the formation of (PNP)Ta(Te)2 (4) in 68% yield as a red, crystalline material (Scheme 2). Examination of the side-product formed from this reaction via 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy again veried the formation of Te(CH2SiMe3)2 along with other intractable products (Fig. S33 and S34\u2020).13 Interestingly, the loss of Te(CH2SiMe3)2 was not observed in the formation of V. It is noteworthy that in all three cases, the reduction of metal halides (PNP)MXn (M= V, Nb, Ta; X= Cl, F; n= 2, 3, 4) in the presence of Te(0) did not provide species (PNP)M(Te)2, highlighting the utility of 1 as a Te-atom delivery reagent.\nSingle crystals of compounds 3 and 4 were obtained from a THF/pentane mixture at \u221235 \u00b0C as green and red needles respectively, and sc-XRD conrmed the formation of isomorphous ve-coordinate bis(telluride) structures (top, Fig. 2). The M]Te bond lengths in 3 and 4 are similar to the anionic Ti bis(telluride) complex, [(PNP)Ti(Te)2]\n\u2212 (2.5185(6) \u00c5),9 but longer than that of (PNP)V(Te)2 7 owing to the increase in ionic radii of the metal as one descends the group. To date, the only documented example of a terminally bound telluride ligand to Nb and Ta include the mono(telluride) complexes, [(C5Me5) Nb(NAr)(Te)(PMe3)] (Ar = 2,6-C6H3\niPr2; not structurally characterized),22 [((Me3SiNCH2CH2)3N)Ta(Te)] (Ta]Te, 2.568(1) \u00c5),12e and Cp*2Ta\u00f0Te\u00deR (R = H, Ta]Te, 2.588(2) \u00c5),23 reported by Gibson, Arnold, and Parkin respectively. Notably, the Ta]Te bond distance in 4 is shorter than Arnold's and Parkin's highvalent mono(telluride) complexes. The 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopic features for 3 and 4 are indicative of a C2-symmetric complex in solution with one 31P singlet resonance for the symmetrically equivalent phosphorus atoms (V: 142 ppm, 3: 91 ppm and 4: 111 ppm). Markedly, the 125Te{1H} NMR spectrum shows a broad resonance at 3896 ppm for 3 (Dn1/2 = 404 Hz) and 3041 ppm for 4 (Dn1/2 = 370 Hz) whereas the titanium bis(telluride) anion, [(PNP)Ti(Te)2]\n\u2212 (3260 ppm, Dn1/2 = 560 Hz) is in between 3 and 4. All bis(telluride) complexes in this work are air-sensitive, highly colored (V: dark green, Nb: green in solution, Ta: red; bottom, Fig. 2), stable as a solid up to 180 \u00b0C,13 and show a modest increase in solubility down the group. The latter feature is counterintuitive as one would expect the Ta]Te bond in 4 to be more ionic and thus less soluble relative to Nb] Te in 3 and V]Te in (PNP)V(Te)2 based on periodic trends. To probe the electronic features in these complexes, we collected UV-vis absorption spectra in THF at the same concentrations\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n(0.056 mM). In addition to the high energy ligand-to-ligand transitions, the spectra show the expected hypsochromic shi in absorptions down the group: (PNP)V(Te)2 (l = 621 nm, 3 = 2290 M\u22121 cm\u22121); 3 (574 nm, 1860 M\u22121 cm\u22121); 4 (505 nm, 2110 M\u22121 cm\u22121), that can be ascribed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions (middle, Fig. 2, and S36\u2013S39\u2020).\nWe conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to better understand the nature of M]Te bonds in the series. Aer an extensive DFT functional benchmark study (Fig. S40\u2013 S42\u2020), we used the MN15/TZ2P//DZP level of theory24 implemented in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) soware25 package to compute and analyze charge-transfer characters. Fig. 3 illustrates the frontier orbitals of the three complexes and the orbital transitions involved in the excitation. The HOMO\u2013 LUMO gap increases down the group in accord with the periodic trends: 3.652 eV (V), 3.942 eV (Nb) and 4.201 eV (Ta). Two frontier orbital transitions corresponding to the experimentally observed absorptions13 were identied where the T1 transitions involve the pincer-to-metal charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO (M = Nb and Ta) or LUMO+2 (M = V). In contrast, the T2 transitions are mostly localized on the metal center (M = V) or the telluride moiety (M = Nb and Ta) depending on the charge transfer character (Fig. S43\u2020). The table inset in Fig. 3 clearly illustrates that the contribution of T1 follows the expected trend based on the average hole\u2013electron distance, Dr,26 obtained\nChem.

We performed a Hirshfeld charge analysis to probe the bond polarity whereby the Nb center (+0.35e) in 3 (Te: \u22120.19e) is more electron-\nFig. 4 Te-L1 edge XANES data for complexes V (blue), 3 (red), and 4 (green).\nTable 1 Calculated and measured Te L1 peak data\nComplex Measured L1 peak (eV)\nV 4940.3 0.01 3 (Nb) 4941.1 0.02 4 (Ta) 4941.1 0.03 a Calculated as the intensity weighted average position: Epeak = ( P (Eabs \u00d7 I to the peak, and Iabs is the calculated intensity.\n12280 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 12277\u201312282\ndecient relative to Ta (+0.23e) in 4 (Te: \u22120.17e) which results in an increased polarization in the binding of the ligands to the transition metal. This difference supports the increased solubility observed in the Ta complex relative to Nb. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the slight decrease in the positive charge of Ta in 4 can be attributed to relativistic contractions of the p orbitals, making the 5p orbitals of Ta more electronegative compared to the 4p orbitals of Nb.\nLastly, Te L1-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were obtained for compounds V, 3, and 4 (Fig. 4 and Table 1). TDDFT calculations13 of the Te L1-edge XAS spectrum were performed using geometries derived from the respective sc-XRD-derived structures. Good agreement is observed between the experimental Te L1 spectra and the calculated spectra (Fig. S50\u2013 S52\u2020).13 In all three cases, the L1 peak corresponds to a Te 2s/ Te 5p transition with varying M d and ligand-based orbital contributions. In both the calculated andmeasured spectra, the L1 edge peak for V is red-shied relative to 3 and 4 which are measured to be essentially coincident with each other. This likely reects the more contracted V 3d orbitals, compared to Nb and Ta 4d and 5d orbitals respectively. This results in poor M d/Te p overlap and ultimately in greater charge density localized on the Te atoms. This is supported by inspection of the L\u00f6wdin calculated charges: Te is calculated to have an average charge of \u22120.21e in V, whereas Te is calculated to have an average charge of +0.09e and +0.07e in 3 and 4, respectively. However, we found that irrespective of the charge analysis method used (Hirshfeld vs. L\u00f6wdin), the metal center is more electropositive than the Te atom. Inspection of the empty frontier orbitals of V, 3, and 4 (Table S9\u2020) shows that there is more TM d orbital character than Te indicative of overall nucleophilic character on Te and positive character on the metal center.\nRemarkably, little variance in the Te 5p character of the acceptor orbitals is observed across the measured series (24\u2013 27%). This is reected in the fact that no discernible trend can be observed in the measured Te L1 peak area \u2013 all areas are within error of each other (Table 1). The transition metal M d character is observed to decrease down the group (V > Nb > Ta). Concomitantly, the acceptor orbitals appear to have increasing ligand character (Ta > Nb > V). Taken together, we can observe that the bonding of Te to group 5 transition metal centers is substantively similar down the group and that varying the metal identity primarily changes the binding of the transition metal to the PNP scaffold, rather than inducing noteworthy changes to the M]Te bonds.\nMeasured L1 peak area Calculated L1 peak a (eV)\n5.9 0.5 4940.6 6.6 0.5 4940.9 6.0 0.6 4941.0\nabs)/ P (Iabs)), where Eabs is the calculated energy of the state contributing\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In contrast to the protocol of using elemental Te or TePR3 to access bis(telluride) motifs, this work presents the groundwork that a lithium alkyl tellurolate can be used to access the rare bis(telluride) species regardless of the starting metal halide complexes and their oxidation state. By combining spectroscopic and theoretical investigation, we identied the electronic structures of the series of complexes and their excitation proles in the UV-vis region. Outside of the expected periodic trends, Hirshfeld charge analysis indicates increased polarity between Nb]Te bonds relative to Ta]Te, and the TeL1 XAS peak areas are indifferent between these complexes indicating similarity in the bonding between Te and the respective metal center. We are now investigating this strategy for the synthesis of other terminal bis(chalogenides) (e.g. Se and/or S) and of transition metals outside of group 5."

Chem., 2001, 2001, 1411\u20131413. 16 The broad resonance of 2 could be attributed to its rigid structure enforced by the [Li(12-crown-4)2]\n+ in solution relative to 1 which is possibly an oligomer in solution. This causes a slower relaxation time, T2, for 2 and results in a broader peak width. 17 U. J. Kilgore, C. A. Sengelaub, H. Fan, J. Tomaszewski, J. A. Karty, M.-H. Baik and D. J.
