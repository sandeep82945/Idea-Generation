    "abstractText": "Social self-efficacy has been shown to be a key resource for adolescents\u2019 social experiences with peers and a predictor of prosocial behaviour among adolescents. However, differences by gender, age and socioeconomic level have previously been found in social self-efficacy. The objective of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of the subscale of social self-efficacy from the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C) developed by Muris (2001) in a representative sample of Spanish adolescents while considering gender, age and socioeconomic level differences. In general, the results showed good psychometric properties and a one-dimensional structure with high internal consistency, adequate explained variance and evidence of external validity for the subscale. Furthermore, the invariance analysis demonstrated that the social self-efficacy subscale shows no bias when used with populations of adolescents who differ by gender, age and socioeconomic level. The results indicate that the Spanish version of the social self-efficacy subscale of the SEQ-C is an adequate measurement instrument for assessing adolescents\u2019 perception of their own social skills.",

            "text": "A large number of studies have explored the general self-efficacy described by Bandura et al. [1] in adolescents [2\u20134], but only a few have focused on its specific dimensions, such as social self-efficacy [5,6], which can be defined as a young person\u2019s ability to overcome social barriers [5] and develop healthy and supportive relationships [7]. Adolescence is a developmental stage during which young people are faced with many changes and influences from peers. These experiences highlight the need for the acute development of social self-efficacy that encourages the person to cope with adverse experiences with their peers and serves as protection against potential depressive or anxious symptoms [8]. On the other hand, the quality of relationships with friends and of lived experiences shared with them is a mediating factor between victimization and anxiety in young people [9]. High social self-efficacy in young people predicts prosocial behaviours for the benefit of their community [10\u201312] due to adolescents\u2019 confidence in their own social competence [13]. Furthermore, boys and girls who trust in their social efficacy are more likely to build new and strong social relationships with their peers and are less likely to engage in disruptive behaviour [4]. From a gender perspective, some discrepancies have been found in the scores obtained by boys and girls in several studies. According to Coleman [14], 10\u201312-year-old girls show higher levels of social self-efficacy than boys. Gaspar et al. [15] found that after a social skills intervention in Portuguese schools, boys developed greater social skills than girls. This same study showed, from an evolutionary perspective, that as boys and girls grow\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 1150. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10061150 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nolder, they improve their socioemotional skills towards more complex levels, promoting greater social self-efficacy. Similarly, social support greatly enhances social self-efficacy in boys and girls [16]. Cicognani [17] asserted that older adolescents can adopt more effective strategies for finding solutions and resolving conflicts with others. Regarding the socioeconomic level of the family, according to Bradley & Corwyn [18] and McLoyd [19], children from poorer homes face more economic challenges that impede their development and learning because their parents are unable to provide enough funds to support their cognitive stimulation (computers, trips, books, etc.). Along these lines, other studies indicated that potential learning problems in school were derived from the scarcity of resources and led to lower self-efficacy in all its dimensions [20,21]. However, Meilstrup et al. [22] showed that high self-efficacy and high social competence buffer the negative effects of low socioeconomic status on emotional symptoms among schoolchildren. Due to the key role of social self-efficacy in different aspects of the development of adolescents, it is essential to consider measures of social self-efficacy that are supported by adequate evidence of reliability and validity for evaluations and interventions based on positive social interactions. In this regard, Muris [5] developed a questionnaire with the three dimensions of self-efficacy proposed by Bandura [1]\u2014social, academic and emotional\u2014in a sample of 330 young Europeans, which provided satisfactory results in internal consistency to the three subscales. Other researchers found similar results after adapting and assessing the psychometric properties of the instrument in their respective populations [23\u201325]. Among the three subdimensions, social self-efficacy measured by its 8-item version showed good construct validity and internal consistency in a sample of adolescents from the United States of America, with no differences by gender or age [6]. In view of the above, and given the relevance of social self-efficacy in the young population and its correlations with individual and contextual variables, the objective of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of the subscale developed by Muris [5], as Zullig et al. [6] did, in a representative sample of Spanish adolescents while attending to differences in gender, age and socioeconomic level."

Population data were collected under the framework of the project the Opinion Barometer of Childhood and Adolescence (Barometer OPINA) by selecting a representative sample through random multistage sampling stratified by conglomerates. The participants were 5773 adolescents from Spain: 3021 (52.3%) girls and 2752 (47.7%) boys. The age groups were distributed as follows: 1256 (21.8%) 11\u201312 years old, 2377 (41.2%) 13\u201314 years old, 1725 (29.9%) 15\u201316 years old and 415 (7.2%) 17\u201318 years old. The distribution by family socioeconomic level was 18.1% of adolescents with a low level, 45.6% with a medium level and 36.3% with a high level (Table 1). The young people responded to an online and anonymous questionnaire in their schools that respected their beliefs and privacy. Before the study was conducted, approval was granted by the Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica de Andaluc\u00eda (Andalusian Bioethics Committee)."

For this study, in addition to gender and age, the following instruments were included:\n\u2022 Family socioeconomic level was evaluated through the latest version of the 6-item Family Affluence Scale (FAS-III) [27]. These items assess family material affluence through ownership of certain goods such as the number of cars, computers, or bathrooms. This instrument shows high test-retest reliability (r = 0.90) and consistency between child and parent reports (r = 0.80) [27]. In this research, FAS-III was employed as a categorical variable, distributing the subjects into three groups: the highest 20% classified as high-affluence, the lowest 20% as low-affluence, and the middle 60% as medium-affluence, as recommended in the last HBSC report [28]. \u2022 Social self-efficacy is an 8-item subscale from the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C) developed by Muris [5] and inspired by the general scale of self-efficacy of Bandura et al. [1]. The Spanish version was adapted through a translation/backtranslation procedure carried out by two bilingual translators. Examples of items include \u201cHow well can you become friends with other children?\u201d, \u201cHow well can you tell other children that they are doing something that you don\u2019t like?\u201d, \u201cHow well do you succeed in staying friends with other children?\u201d and \u201cHow well do you succeed in preventing quarrels with other children?\u201d. The response options ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very well). Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.85 for the original subscale [5]. For this study, the internal consistency was 0.82. \u2022 Perceived friend support was evaluated through a subscale of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support [29]. The items were \u201cMy friends really try to help me\u201d, \u201cI can count on my friends when things go wrong\u201d, \u201cI have friends with whom I can share my joys and sorrows\u201d and \u201cI can talk about my problems with my friends\u201d. The response options ranged from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). The scale has been translated and adapted to different languages and population groups [30]. Both the original study [29] and studies based on samples of Spanish adolescents [31\u201333] have shown an adequate internal consistency of the perceived friend support subscale. The internal consistency of the subscale in the present study, estimated by Cronbach\u2019s alpha, was \u03b1 = 0.92."

Additionally, ceiling and floor effects were assessed for the total scale score. These effects were considered to be present if more than 15% of participants achieved the lowest or highest possible score, respectively [34,35]. Second, mean comparison analyses were carried out using Student\u2019s t tests for independent samples to assess differences by gender in social self-efficacy and friends\u2019 perceived support. The effect size of the differences was also obtained using Cohen\u2019s d with the following cut-off points: 0 to 0.19 was considered negligible, 0.20 to 0.49 small, 0.50 to 0.79 medium and 0.80 and above high [36]. In addition, ANOVA was performed to compare social self-efficacy and friends\u2019 support scores according to age and family socioeconomic level. Third, internal consistency analyses were performed through Cronbach\u2019s alpha, and the correlations between the score of each of the items and the total score of the scale were analysed for the global and segmented sample by gender, age and family socioeconomic level. Furthermore, evidence of internal validity analysis referring to the structure of the questionnaire was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis using the unweighted least-squares method (ULS). Model fit was evaluated for both the global and segmented samples through different adjustment indices: chi-square (\u03c72), taking into account that it can be affected by sample size [37]; comparative fit index (CFI), with values above\n0.90 considered acceptable; and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardised root mean squared residual (SRMR), considering values near or below 0.08 and 0.05, respectively, as indicators of acceptable model fit. In addition, multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to evaluate configurational and metric invariance for the sample segmented by gender, age and family socioeconomic level, with an increase in CFI greater than 0.01 considered to be a significant change in the model [37]. Finally, to analyse the evidence of external validity referring to the relationship with other variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to describe the association between social self-efficacy and friends\u2019 support in the global and segmented samples. A statistical significance of less than 5% (p < 0.05) was used for all cases. Statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA), and JASP software, version 0.14 (JASP Team, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)."

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the psychometric properties of the social self-efficacy subscale developed by Muris [5] in Spanish adolescents from a gender, evolutive development and socioeconomic perspective. The social self-efficacy of young people enabled them to relate to others in an effective and healthy manner, avoiding conflicts and sharing experiences [38,39]. As a result of this instrument\u2019s evaluation, we will be able to learn about the characteristics of adolescents to promote healthy emotional and social development. In this regard, preliminary results of mean comparisons in social self-efficacy, taking into account various sociodemographic variables, revealed that boys have higher beliefs about their skills to develop healthy social relationships than girls. However, girls scored higher on perceived friend support, confirming the findings of Rueger et al. [40] and Shaheen et al. [41] on the importance of friendship in adolescent development. Regarding the social self-efficacy score, the results support the findings of Coleman [14], indicating\na higher level of self-efficacy in boys from an early age. On the other hand, these results do not support other studies in which girls had greater self-efficacy than boys [6,42] or in those that did not find differences by gender [43,44]. Nonetheless, we must exercise caution when interpreting our results because the intensity of these differences indicates a negligible size effect, implying that statistically significant differences may be due to the large sample size. Regarding age and socioeconomic level, there do not seem to be differences in social self-efficacy and perceived social support provided by friends in any of the groups. The results do not support the findings of Cicognani [17], who reported higher scores in social self-efficacy in older adolescents, nor the works by Bradley & Corwyn [18] and McLoyd [19] on social inequalities in the development and learning of different skills. From a psychometric approach, the subscale showed adequate reliability in our sample, as Muris [5] and Zullig et al. [6] found. Similar results were obtained when the sample was segmented by gender, age and socioeconomic level, showing good indicators of internal consistency for all the cases. Only removing Item 8 (\u201cHow well do you succeed in preventing quarrels with other children?\u201d) increased the reliability, but the increment was negligible. Regarding the evidence for validity, an analysis of the structure of the instrument in the total sample and every subsample revealed that the items showed factor loadings in a range between 0.30 and 0.80 with excellent goodness-of-fit for the model. Although Muris [5] decided to remove Item 8 with a loading of 0.32, this action should be interpreted with caution. It is possible that many adolescents have never experienced a situation that they could consider as a \u201cquarrel\u201d and so answered the question based on their perception and not on their experience. Additionally, the concept could be quite different between individuals who consider verbal confrontations and those who consider physical aggression to be indicators of a quarrel. Therefore, preserving this item could provide some additional information about how competent the respondents perceive themselves to be in such situations and what they consider to be a dispute. Future research should include a more detailed explanation about the concept \u201cquarrel\u201d. In addition, metric measurement invariance was tested for each sociodemographic variable, and under parameter constraint for each subsample, the goodness-of-fit indicators remained excellent, with factor loadings greater than 0.36 in all cases, including Item 8. Furthermore, no decrements greater than 0.01 in CFI were observed [37], which verified the model invariance and indicated that the instrument can be applied to all the groups analysed and their scores compared among them. Finally, the external validity evidence regarding the relationship between social selfefficacy and the perceived social support provided by friends, both in the global sample and segmented by the different sociodemographic variables, showed a positive and moderate association in all groups. It is necessary to highlight that a greater perceived ability to establish healthy social relationships among young people of any age and socioeconomic level is related to the search for emotional and social support from their peers and to the avoidance of stressful experiences such as bullying [45]. This context indicates that social self-efficacy can diminish and buffer situations that reduce their personal satisfaction and help them build relationships that increase their subjective wellbeing [46,47]. In addition, the promotion of adequate self-efficacy and social competence through school initiatives can cushion and improve the negative effects on minors\u2019 mental health caused by socioeconomic inequalities [22]. This study has several limitations that must be acknowledged. One is that all the data obtained were collected through self-administered instruments. In addition, due to the study\u2019s cross-sectional design, it is not possible to establish causal relationships between the variables studied, which would require a longitudinal study that would allow us to verify the directionality and causality of the relationships explored. Finally, the sample can be considered representative of Spanish adolescents, but the 17\u201318-year-old group may be biased because the data were collected in educational institutions, whereas attending school at this educational stage is not mandatory. However, as the main strength of the study, the\nresults showed that the invariance of the instrument with differences in gender, age and socioeconomic level verifies the stability and applicability of this instrument in different contexts. Furthermore, the specificity and brevity of the instrument allow its incorporation into more complex issues or as the subject of interventions in various educational programs. Future research may be able to assess the psychosocial properties of social self-efficacy in a variety of culturally diverse contexts, investigate which other specific subdimensions of general self-efficacy [1] are relevant in adolescent development and examine how to incorporate these findings into educational policies and mental health promotion initiatives for youth."

            "text": "The social self-efficacy subscale from the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C) developed by Muris [5] showed good psychometric properties in a Spanish sample of adolescents. The results showed that the instrument had a one-dimensional structure with high internal consistency and an adequate explained variance. Greater scores in social self-efficacy were related to a higher perceived level of social support from friends. According to previous research, higher social self-efficacy is associated with the development of skills to deal with adversity and to build safe and healthy relationships with peers. Therefore, this study provides new evidence of the external validity of the subscale. Furthermore, the subscale can be used in different populations despite differences in gender, age or socioeconomic level since the factor invariance allows us to compare their scores on the same metric. Additionally, a more detailed description of the concept of \u201cquarrel\u201d in Item 8 should be considered in future studies. The results support that the instrument is a useful tool for developing preventive mental health programs in educational centres and allowing policy-makers to design tailored policies for adolescents.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.S., D.D.-M., S.L. and S.V.; methodology, V.S. and D.D.-M.; formal analysis, V.S.; investigation, V.S., D.D.-M. and S.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.S., D.D.-M., S.L. and S.V.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.S., D.D.-M., S.L. and S.V.; supervision, V.S., D.D.-M., S.L. and S.V.
