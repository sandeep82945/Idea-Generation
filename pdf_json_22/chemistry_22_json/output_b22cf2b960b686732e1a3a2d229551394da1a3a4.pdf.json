Currently, it is a challenging work to identify the metal ion ligandbinding residues accurately by computational approaches. In this study, we proposed an improved method to predict the binding residues of 10 metal ion ligands (Zn, Cu, Fe, Fe, Co, Mn, Ca, Mg, Na, and K). Based on the basic feature parameters of amino acids, and physicochemical and predicted structural information, we added another two features of amino acid correlation information and binding residue propensity factors. With the optimized parameters, we used the GBM algorithm to predict metal ion ligandbinding residues. In the obtained results, the Sn and MCC values were over 10.17% and 0.297, respectively. Besides, the Sn and MCC values of transition metals were higher than 34.46% and 0.564, respectively. In order to test the validity of our model, another method (Random Forest) was also used in comparison. The better results of this work indicated that the proposed method would be a valuable tool to predict metal ion ligand-binding residues.",

For example, the binding of Cu2+ ligand can promote in situ oxidation modification reaction (Cecconi et al., 2002), and the oxygen-promoting compound formed by the combination of Mn2+ ligands and proteins can be used as a catalyst in the process of photosynthesis (Reed and Poyner, 2000). In fact, the mechanism of protein\u2013metal ion ligand binding is that some special protein functions need the precise binding of proteins and ligand-binding residues, while the abnormal binding would lead to many related diseases. For example, abnormal binding residues of Cu2+ ligand can lead to the diseases of Wilson and Menkes (Yuan et al., 1995; Petris et al., 1996). In addition, metal ions have a direct influence on the formation of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases (Barnham and Bush, 2008). Therefore, the study of protein\u2013metal ion ligand-binding residues is helpful to understand the mechanism of protein functions, the treatment of diseases, and the design of molecular drugs.\nEdited by: Yang Gao,\nNankai University, China\nReviewed by: Pu-Feng Du,\nTianjin University, China Prasun Kumar,\nUniversity of Bristol, United Kingdom Jiangning Song,\nMonash University, Australia\n*Correspondence: Xiuzhen Hu\nhxz@imut.edu.cn Zhenxing Feng zxfeng@imut.edu.cn Jing Pang pang_j@imut.edu.cn\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nComputational Genomics, a section of the journal Frontiers in Genetics\nReceived: 12 October 2021 Accepted: 30 November 2021 Published: 04 January 2022\nCitation: Xu S, Hu X, Feng Z, Pang J, Sun K, You X and Wang Z (2022) Recognition of Metal Ion Ligand-Binding Residues by Adding Correlation Features and\nPropensity Factors.

For example, in 2010, Horst and Samudrala (2010) extracted amino acids, local conservatism, and other features of Ca2+ ligand in prediction, and Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC) was up to 0.6. In 2012, Lu et al. (2012) adopted a method of fragment conversion, and the prediction accuracy (ACC) of 6 ligands reached 94.6%. In 2016, Jiang et al. (2016) used the information of increment of diversity, matrix score, and autocross covariance as prediction parameters, the ACC values of the Ca2+ ligand exceeded 75.0%, and the MCC value exceeded 0.50. In 2017, Cao et al. (2017) extracted the component and site-conserved information of amino acids, physicochemical features, and structural information, the ACC values were higher than 74.8%, and the MCC values were higher than 0.5.\nIn terms of algorithms, manymachine learning algorithms were used in the recognition of metal ion ligand-binding residues (Hu et al., 2016a; Hu et al., 2016b; Liu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). For example, in 2016, Hu et al. (2016a) used SVM algorithm and the 9 metal ion ligands; Ionseq obtained good prediction results. In 2019, Wang et al. (2019) applied the SMO algorithm to predict 10 metal ion ligand-binding residues and obtained better prediction results. In 2019, Liu et al. (2019) applied the K-nearest neighbor classifier, and the ACC values of 6metal ion ligands were higher than 80.0%. In 2020, Liu et al. (2020) used Random Forest (RF) algorithm in predicting the 10 kinds of ion binding residues, and the MCC values were higher than 0.55.\nIn the prediction works of metal ion ligands, many researchers found several important feature parameters such as amino acid, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic, and polarization charge at the fragment level. In this study, through the statistical analysis for the correlation of amino acids, we found that there exists a high probability of the occurrence of the adjacent, secondary neighbor, and thirdly neighbor of the binding residues. Therefore, we took the amino acid correlation information of amino acids into consideration when extracting feature parameters. In addition, because the binding of metal ion ligands to specific amino acids residues has a certain tendency, we counted the difference between non-binding residues and binding residues bound by different metal ions. Thus, we further took the binding residue propensity factors as feature parameters. In the datasets of this work, the serious imbalance of the positive and negative sets would result in a high false positive in the prediction results. In this study, we chose the GBM (Gradient Boostling) algorithm, which has a comparative advantage in the above problem. The algorithm can optimize the model by continuously reducing the sample errors and improve the prediction overall accuracy by optimizing the algorithm parameters in the prediction."

In order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the experimental data source, the datasets constructed by our group\n(Cao et al., 2017) were from the semi-manual Biolip database (Yang et al., 2013b), which was measured by experiments with high accuracy. The 10 metal ions in the datasets contain Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+. In the datasets, the arbitrary protein sequence was longer than 50 amino acids. In addition, the resolution and sequence identity thresholds were lower than 3 \u00c5 and 30%, respectively.\nSince the surrounding residues also have an influence on the binding of metal ion ligands, we considered the binding residues and surrounding residues in the datasets. In the work, we used the sliding window method to intercept fragments from the beginning of the protein chains. To ensure that each amino acid can appear in the center of a fragment, we added (L\u22121)/2 pseudo-amino acids to both ends of a protein chain, in which the pseudo-amino acid was represented by X. If the central position of one fragment was a binding residue, then we defined the fragment as a positive sample; otherwise, it was a negative one. The datasets are shown in Table 1. According to the physicochemical properties of ions, we also divided the 10 metal ion ligands into 3 categories: transition-metal ions (Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, andMn2+), alkaline-earthmetal ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+), and alkali-metal ions (Na+ and K+)."

The physicochemical features contain hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic and polarization charge information. According to the hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic of amino acids (P\u00e1nek et al., 2005), we divided the 20 amino acids into 6 categories. Depending on the charged condition of amino acids after the hydrolysis, we divided the 20 amino acids into 3 categories (Taylor, 1986). The detailed classification is presented in Figure 1.\nBy using the ANGLOR software (Wu and Zhang, 2008), we obtained the predicted structural features including secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility from the primary sequence of protein. Here, we divided the secondary structure into three categories: \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet, and coil. In addition, we divided the relative solvent accessibility into two categories: exposed and buried. If the Boolean values of amino acid were larger than 0.25, then the amino acids were defined as \u201cexposed\" ones; otherwise, they were defined as \u201cburied\u201d ones."

In this way, although the spatial distance of these surrounding residues is very close, the sequence distance may be very long. For example, on the BS01 binding site of the protein (3I11A), the binding residues bound with Co2+ ligands were located at 86, 88, 90, and 149 positions in the same sequence, respectively. These binding residues may have long-range correlation (Chen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020).

The ordinate was the D-values between the positive sets and the\nnegative sets. In Figure 4, If the bars were above the x-axis, it represents that the occurrence probability of amino acids pairs of the positive sets was greater. Otherwise, the probability of the negative sets was greater. In Figure 3, the abscissa values of Cu2+ secondary neighbor correlation were 7, 127, 187, and 327; the corresponding AH, HH, LH, and TH pairs of amino acids had a great difference in probability between positive and negative sets. They tended to appear in positive sets; in particular, the HH had a larger difference in probability. In Figure 4, the abscissa values of the Fe3+ thirdly neighbor correlation were 67, 126, 147, 187, 327, and 347 corresponding to EH, HG, IH, LH, TH, and VH. They had great probability differences between the positive and negative sets, and preferred to appear in positive sets. Among them, EH, LH, and TH were more obvious.

However, the features of the binding residues alone were not taken into consideration. In fact, the ligand-specific binding also has a selective preference for different amino acid residues. Therefore, we counted the amino acid residues that the 10 metal ion ligands preferred to bind. For example, Zn2+ and Fe2+ are shown in Figure 5.\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 7938004\nIn Figure 5, among the 20 amino acids, the four amino acids of C, D, E, and H were more likely to be the binding residues. However, for Zn2+ and Fe2+ ligands, the four amino acids were used differently. In comparison, C and H were more easily bound by Zn2+ ligands, while H was more easily bound by Fe2+ ligands. Therefore, we extracted propensity factor of binding residues as feature parameters. The formula of the propensity factor (Chou and Fasman, 1974) was as follows:\nFij pijpj (1)\nThe statistical samples were binding residues and non-binding residues, pij nijNi, pj Nj Nt ; i is 20 amino acids (i 1,2, . . . 20); j is binding residues or non-binding residues (j 1,2); nij represents the number of amino acid i in binding residues or non-binding residues; Ni represents the number of amino acid i in the statistical samples; Nj represents the number of binding or non-binding residues; Nt represents the number of residues in the statistical samples. If Fij is larger than 1, it means that type amino acid i is more inclined to be amino acid j. Taking Mn2+ as an example, the values of propensity factor of amino acids D, E, H, and N were larger than 1, indicating that the 4 amino acids were more likely to become binding residues (Table 3)."

It can fit complex nonlinear relationships with fast calculation speed, strong robustness, and high accuracy. The deviation of the\nmodel will not have a serious impact on the algorithm.

Then, we calculated the results of 7 window lengths (i.e., 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17) on a 5-fold cross-validation test. In the process, we defined the corresponding window lengths as the optimal ones (L) with higher Sn and MCC values. The predicted results of GBM(1) with the optimal window are shown in Table 5.\nIn the results of GBM(1) (Table 5), the predicted results of transition-metal ion ligands were better. The Sn and MCC values of Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe2+ ligands were higher than 29.82% and 0.473, respectively. The Sn and MCC values of Fe\n3+, Co2+, and Mn2+ ligands were higher than 9.6% and 0.249, respectively. The Sn and MCC values of alkali\u2013metal ion ligands were higher than 7.28% and 0.253, respectively.\nIn order to test the validity of the amino acid correlation information and binding residue propensity factor, we removed correlation features or propensity factors from the full feature sets. Taking Cu2+ and Na+ ligands as examples, the results are shown in Table 6.\nIn comparison with (a), for Cu2+ ligand: the Sn and MCC values of (b) were higher, and Sn and MCC values of (c) increased by 10.1% and 0.072, respectively. When parameters of correlation feature and propensity factor were added, the Sn and MCC value were significantly increased by 11.54% and 0.109, respectively. For Na+ ligand: the Sn and MCC values of (b) were significantly improved by 5.32% and 0.112, respectively. The Sn and MCC values of (c) were increased. When correlation feature and\npropensity factor were added, the Sn and MCC values increased by 6.54% and 0.138, respectively.\nOn the addition of feature parameters, different metal ion ligands have different sensitivities. For instance, the Cu2+ ligand was more sensitive to the propensity factor, while the Na+ ligand wasmore sensitive to the correlation feature. Above all, the results of adding two parameters were better than those of adding one alone.\nIn order to further improve the prediction accuracy, we optimized the four parameters (e.g., n.trees, interaction.depth, shrinkage, and n.minobsinnode) in the GBM algorithm. According to the reported literature (Rawi et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2020), the parameter range was set as follows: n.trees in n{100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500}, interaction.depth in d {3,5,7,9}, shrinkage in r{0.01,0.1}, and n.minobsinnode in m {10,20,30,40,50}. The AUROC values were used as the evaluation indicator to obtain the optimal algorithm parameters by the grid search method. Taking Cu2+ and K+ ligands as examples, the optimal parameters of Cu2+ ligand were (5,250,0.1,40), and the AUROC value was 0.985. The optimal parameters of K+ ligand were (9,200,0.1,10), and the AUROC value was 0.963. The ROC curves corresponding to the optimal parameters of Cu2+ and K+ ligands are shown in Figure 7.\nAs can be seen in Figure 6, the AUROC values of Cu2+ and K+ ligands both exceed 0.96. For the convenience of comparison, the results after optimizing the algorithm parameters were also added in Table 6.\nFrom the results of GBM(2) in Table 6, it can be seen that the values of Sn and MCC of transition metal ion ligands were higher than 34.46% and 0.564, respectively. The values of Sn andMCC in the results of alkaline Earth metal ion ligands were higher than 10.17% and 0.297, respectively. The values of Sn and MCC in the results of alkali metal ion ligands were higher than 16.97% and 0.392, respectively. In comparison with the results of GBM(1), the results of GBM(2) were significantly improved, in which the Sn and MCC values of the nine ligands (i.e., Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+,\nFIGURE 8 | The comparison of identification results.

The number of decision trees in the RF was set as 500 (Liaw and Wiener, 2002; Liu et al., 2020). The results of the RF were added in Table 6. Except for the alkali metal ion ligands, the Sn and MCC values of the other ion ligands were higher than 6.94% and 0.214. The predicted results of transition metal ion ligands were better. The Sn and MCC values of Zn\n2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ ligands were higher than 27.25% and 0.420, respectively. The Sn and MCC values of Fe\n2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ ligands were higher than 12.27% and 0.252, respectively. Taken together, with the same parameters by using RF, we also obtained good predicted results. Except for Zn2+, the results of GBM(2) were better than those of RF algorithm. For Cu2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Na+, and K+ ligands, the Sn and MCC values were at least 26.18% and 0.259 higher in the GBM algorithm. For Fe3+ and Mn2+ ligands, the Sn and MCC values were at least 17.5% and 0.214 higher, respectively.\nIn the field of predicting metal ion ligand-binding residues, Hu et al. (2016a) proposed several predicted methods and obtained well-predicted results. At present, the Ionseq is a method with better predicted results on the unbalanced datasets. Thus, we took a comparison with the method of Ionseq in Table 6. It can be seen that the Sn and MCC values of Cu 2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and K+ ligands were better than those of Ionseq. Due to the fact that the number of binding residues was far less than the number of nonbinding residues, it would lead to a high false positive. In order to show the improvement, we took a random protein chain (2 \u00d7 11A) bound by Cu2+ ligand as an example. Based on the above optimal model, we made a prediction for this protein chain. The predicted results obtained are shown in Figure 8.\nBy comparing the second and third rows, we obtained that the prediction results of the optimal model (GBM(2)) were TP 7, TN 509, FP 6, and FN 11. By comparing the second and fourth rows, the prediction results of the prediction model with basic feature parameters were TP 4, TN 514, FP 6, and FN 9. The comparison showed that the prediction results were significantly improved after adding correlation features and propensity factors."
