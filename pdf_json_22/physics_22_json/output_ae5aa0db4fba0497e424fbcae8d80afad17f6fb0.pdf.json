    "abstractText": "We revisit the minimal Nambu-Goldstone(NG)-Higgs supersymmetric (SUSY) SU(5) grand unified model and study its phenomenological implications. The Higgs sector of the model possesses a global SU (6) symmetry, which is spontaneously broken and results in the Higgs doublets of the minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM) as NG chiral superfields. Therefore, the model naturally leads to light Higgs doublets and solves the doublet-triplet splitting problem. Because of the SU(6) symmetry, the couplings of the Higgs sector are tightly restricted, and thus the model is more predictive than the minimal SUSY SU(5). We determine all the grand unified theory parameters via the matching conditions of the gauge coupling constants at the unification scale and calculate proton lifetime, confronting this with current experimental bounds. We discuss that this model is incompatible with the constrained MSSM, whilst it has a large viable parameter space in the high-scale SUSY scenario. The perturbativity condition on the trilinear coupling of the adjoint Higgs field imposes an upper (lower) limit on the wino (gluino) mass, implying a hierarchical mass pattern for these gauginos. Future proton-decay searches can probe a large part of the parameter space, especially if the SUSY-breaking scale is \u2272100 TeV.",

The Higgs sector of the model possesses a global SU (6) symmetry, which is spontaneously broken and results in the Higgs doublets of the minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM) as NG chiral superfields. Therefore, the model naturally leads to light Higgs doublets and solves the doublet-triplet splitting problem. Because of the SU(6) symmetry, the couplings of the Higgs sector are tightly restricted, and thus the model is more predictive than the minimal SUSY SU(5). We determine all the grand unified theory parameters via the matching conditions of the gauge coupling constants at the unification scale and calculate proton lifetime, confronting this with current experimental bounds. We discuss that this model is incompatible with the constrained MSSM, whilst it has a large viable parameter space in the high-scale SUSY scenario. The perturbativity condition on the trilinear coupling of the adjoint Higgs field imposes an upper (lower) limit on the wino (gluino) mass, implying a hierarchical mass pattern for these gauginos.

INTRODUCTION\nUnification of interactions has been one of the main goals of particle physics. The minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) [1,2] offers a desirable framework to this end, where the three Standard Model (SM) gauge couplings are unified with great accuracy [3\u20139]. Nevertheless, the minimal SU(5) GUT is known to have a fatal defect, called the doublet-triplet splitting problem. In SU(5), the Higgs doublets in the minimal SUSY standard model (MSSM) are embedded into 5 and 5\u0304 representations, accompanied with color-triplet components. These color-triplet fields induce proton decay, and to evade the limits imposed by proton-decay searches they must have a GUT-scale mass. On the other hand, the MSSM Higgs doublets need to have a SUSY-scale mass to achieve a successful electroweak-symmetry breaking. This mass splitting is realized with a huge amount of fine-tuning in the minimal SU(5), making this model less appealing.\nAn attractive idea to solve this doublet-triplet splitting problem is that the Higgs boson is a pseudo-NambuGoldstone (pNG) boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry. Such a scenario in the framework of GUTs was first explored in Ref. [10] and discussed later in Refs. [11\u201328]. In the model considered in Ref. [10], the 5 and 5\u0304 Higgs representations, as well as an adjoint Higgs field of SU(5), are embedded into an adjoint representation of an SU(6) global symmetry. The SU(5) GUT gauge group is a subgroup of this SU(6). The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of this adjoint field breaks both the SU(6) global symmetry and the SU(5) GUT gauge symmetry, giving masses to the SU(5) gauge bosons and yielding a pair of massless doublet Higgs fields as NG multiplets. The color-triplet components of the 5 and 5\u0304 representations remain massive, i.e., have a GUT-scale mass. The mass term of the doublet Higgs fields is protected from quantum corrections thanks to the nonrenormalization theorem in SUSY theories, and is generated through the SUSY-breaking effect. As a result, the MSSM Higgs doublets acquire a mass around the SUSYbreaking scale, and hence, the doublet-triplet splitting problem is solved in a natural manner. We refer to this setup as the minimal NG Higgs SUSY SU(5) GUT model. In this work, we revisit this model and study its phenomenological implications in detail. Because of the global SU(6) symmetry in the Higgs sector, the number of free parameters in this model is smaller than that in the *hama@hep-th.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp \u2020shihwen@hep-th.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp \u2021natsumi@hep-th.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

It is found from the perturbativity condition on \u03bb that \u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de\u2273 \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de andMHC \u2272MX are favored. The former inequality restricts the low-energy SUSY mass spectrum since \u03b1a\u00f0QG\u00de depend on the masses of the MSSM SUSY particles through the renormalization group equations (RGEs). In addition, we can predict proton decay rates by determining MHC and MX. To show the significance of these results, we consider two scenarios for the SUSY mass spectrum: the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) and highscale SUSY. It is found that the CMSSM is incompatible with the p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 bound from the Super-Kamiokande experiment [29,30], as the SUSY particles are predicted to lie around O\u00f010\u00de TeV in this case. In the high-scale SUSY scenario, on the other hand, we find a large viable parameter space. We also find that the perturbativity condition on \u03bb leads to an upper (lower) limit on the wino (gluino) mass, implying a hierarchical mass pattern for these gauginos. Future proton decay searches can test a large part of the viable parameter regions, especially if the SUSY-breaking scale is \u2272100 TeV. This paper is organized as follows: InSec. II,we review the minimal NG-Higgs SUSYSU(5)GUTmodel and discuss its symmetry-breaking structure and mass spectrum. In Sec. III, we show how to extract the GUT parameters from the GUTscale matching conditions of the SM gauge coupling constants. We also evaluate the mass parameters for the MSSM Higgs fields induced by the SUSY-breaking effect. Then, we show the results of our analysis for the CMSSM and highscale SUSYin Sec. IV. SectionVis devoted to the conclusion and discussion. We summarize relevant formulas for the RGE analysis and proton decay calculation in Appendixes A and B, respectively."

The symmetry breaking of SU\u00f06\u00de \u2192 SU\u00f04\u00de \u2297 SU\u00f02\u00de \u2297 U\u00f01\u00de yields 35 \u2212 \u00f015\u00fe 3\u00fe 1\u00de \u00bc 16 NG bosons, among which 12 are absorbed by the massive gauge bosons corresponding to the broken\n1We normalize these generators as Tr\u00f0TATB\u00de \u00bc \u03b4AB=2. 2This VEV can be decomposed as follows:\nh\u03a3\u0302i \u00bc 3 5 V\u0302 \u00b7 diag\u00f00; 2; 2; 2;\u22123;\u22123\u00de \u00fe 1 5 V\u0302\n\u00b7 diag\u00f05;\u22121;\u22121;\u22121;\u22121;\u22121\u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nThe first term breaks the SU(5) gauge group. It then follows that\nh\u03a3i \u00bc 3 5 V\u0302 \u00b7 diag\u00f02; 2; 2;\u22123;\u22123\u00de; hSi \u00bc \u2212\nffiffiffiffiffi 12\n5\nr V\u0302: \u00f07\u00de\n035016-2\ngenerators of SU\u00f05\u00de \u2192 SU\u00f03\u00deC \u2297 SU\u00f02\u00deL \u2297 U\u00f01\u00deY . The remaining four NGbosons, togetherwith their SUSYpartner fields, appear as physical NG chiral superfields\u2014they are dubbed as the mixed-type superfields in Ref. [31]. As we see below, these fourmassless chiral superfields can be identified as the MSSM-Higgs superfields. We now calculate the mass spectrum of the component fields,\nH \u00bc 0 BBBBBB@\nH1C H2C H3C H\u00feu H0u\n1 CCCCCCA ; H\u0304 \u00bc 0 BBBBBB@\nH\u0304C1 H\u0304C2 H\u0304C3 H\u2212d \u2212H0d\n1 CCCCCCA ; \u00f08\u00de\n\u03a3 \u00bc \u03a38 \u03a3\u00f03;2\u00de \u03a3\u00f03 ;2\u00de \u03a33 \u00fe 1 2 ffiffiffiffiffi 15 p 213 0 0 \u2212312 \u03a324: \u00f09\u00de\nThe adjoint Higgs fields \u03a38 and \u03a33 have the identical mass\nM\u03a3 \u2261M\u03a38 \u00bc M\u03a33 \u00bc 3 2 \u03bbV\u0302: \u00f010\u00de\nThe components \u03a3\u00f03;2\u00de and \u03a3\u00f03 ;2\u00de are massless NG fields and absorbed by the SU(5) gauge fields to be massive. The component \u03a324 mixes with the SU(5) singlet field S, whose mass eigenvalues are found to be 3\u03bbV\u0302=2 and \u03bbV\u0302=2. The color triplet Higgs fields HC and H\u0304C acquire a mass of\nMHC \u00bc 3 2 \u03bbV\u0302; \u00f011\u00de\nwhich is equal to the adjoint Higgs mass. The MSSMHiggs mass is, on the other hand, computed as\nMH \u00bc 1\n2 M \u2212 \u03bbffiffiffiffiffi 15 p \u2212\nffiffiffiffiffi 12\n5\nr V\u0302\n\u00fe \u03bb 2 3 5 \u00f0\u22123\u00deV\u0302 \u00bc 0; \u00f012\u00de\nverifying the expectation that Hu and Hd are the NG chiral superfields. We see that the doublet-triplet mass splitting is naturally realized in this setup. Finally, the mass of the SU(5) gauge bosons is found to be\nMX \u00bc 3 ffiffiffi 2 p g5V\u0302; \u00f013\u00de\nwith g5 the SU(5) gauge coupling constant. Notice that even though the SU(6) global symmetry is explicitly broken by the gauge interactions and WYukawa, Hu and Hd remain massless in the SUSY limit because of the nonrenormalization property of superpotential; in particular, radiative corrections to the K\u00e4hler potential, which give multiplicative wave-function renormalization factors to the component fields, do not generate a mass for Hu and Hd (see, e.g., Ref. [11]).\nNext, we consider the effect of SUSY breaking. We here assume that the SUSY-breaking effect is mediated to the Higgs sector such that the global SU(6) symmetry is respected. The soft SUSY-breaking terms in the Higgs sector, then, have the form\nLsoft \u00bc \u2212 1\n3 A\u03bb\u03bbTr\u03a3\u03023 \u00fe\n1 2 BMMTr\u03a3\u03022 \u00fe H:c:\n\u2212 2m2\u03a3\u0302Tr\u00f0\u03a3\u0302\u2020\u03a3\u0302\u00de; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere we use the same symbols for the scalar components of the Higgs fields. In terms of the SU(5) representations, these soft terms are expressed as\nLsoft \u00bc \u2212 1\n3 \u03bbA\u03bbTr\u00f0\u03a33\u00de \u00fe\n1 2 \u03bbA\u03bbH\u0304\u03a3H \u2212 1 3 ffiffiffiffiffi 15 p \u03bbA\u03bbS3\n\u2212 1ffiffiffiffiffi 15 p \u03bbA\u03bbSH\u0304H\u00fe 1ffiffiffiffiffi 60 p \u03bbA\u03bbSTr\u00f0\u03a32\u00de\n\u00fe 1 2 BMMTr\u00f0\u03a32\u00de \u00fe 1 2 BMMH\u0304H\u00fe 1 4 BMMS2 \u00feH:c:\n\u2212m2\u03a3\u0302\u00bdjSj2 \u00feH\u2020H\u00fe H\u0304\u2020H\u0304\u00fe 2Tr\u00f0\u03a3\u2020\u03a3\u00de : \u00f015\u00de\nIn the presence of the soft SUSY-breaking terms, the VEVof \u03a3\u0302 shifts from the one in Eq. (5) [32]. The F-term is also induced in h\u03a3\u0302i.

We can, therefore, extract the information on the GUT-scale mass spectrum from the mismatch of the gauge coupling constants at the GUT scale [33\u201335].

In Fig. 1, we show contour plots for these values in the \u00f0\u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de plane. As we see from Fig. 1(a), \u03bb increases as \u00f0\u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de\u00de gets larger, with little dependence on \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de, and becomes nonperturbative for \u00f0\u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de\u00de\u2273 0; the region where \u03bb > ffiffiffiffiffi 4\u03c0 p is represented by the green shade in Fig. 1. We thus conclude that \u00f0\u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de\u00de\u2272 0, i.e., \u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de \u2273 \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de is favored in the present setup, which imposes a nontrivial constraint on the low-energy SUSY spectrum. On the other hand, Fig. 1(b) shows that \u03b15\u00f0QG\u00de remains perturbative over the parameter region shown in this figure. As can be seen from Eq. (25) and Fig. 1(c),MHC=MX is a function of \u00f0\u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de\u00de only, and MHC < MX (MHC > MX) for \u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de > \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de (\u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de < \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de). As discussed above, the perturbativity condition on \u03bb favors \u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de \u2273 \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de, and hence MHC \u2272MX. On the other hand, if \u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de is considerably larger than \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de, then MHC becomes much smaller than MX. In this case, the proton-decay rate induced by the exchange of the colortriplet Higgs multiplet is enhanced, making it difficult to avoid the experimental bound. We, therefore, expect that the proton-decay limit gives a lower limit on \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de\u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de, which further restricts the low-energy SUSY mass spectrum. To see qualitatively the dependence of \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de on the low-energy SUSY spectrum, we use the one-loop RGEs for the gauge coupling constants to obtain analytical expressions for \u03b1a\u00f0QG\u00de (a \u00bc 1, 2, 3).

From the condition \u03b11\u00f0QG\u00de \u00bc \u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de, we obtain the unification scale QG as\nQG \u00bc mZ \u00b7 exp 5\u03c0\n14\n1\n\u03b11\u00f0mZ\u00de \u2212\n1\n\u03b12\u00f0mZ\u00de\n\u00d7\nm25Z\nm20 W\u0303 \u00b7m4 H\u0303 \u00b7mA\n! 1 84Y\ni\nm4\u02dc\u0304ui \u00b7m3\u02dc\u0304ei m7\nQ\u0303i\n1 84 m \u02dc\u0304di mL\u0303i 1 84 :\n\u00f029\u00de By using this, we then have\n1\n\u03b12\u00f0QG\u00de \u2212\n1 \u03b13\u00f0QG\u00de \u00bc \u2212 5 7 1 \u03b11\u00f0mZ\u00de \u00fe 12 7 1 \u03b12\u00f0mZ\u00de \u2212\n1\n\u03b13\u00f0mZ\u00de\n\u00fe 1 28\u03c0 ln\nm32 W\u0303 \u00b7m12 H\u0303 \u00b7m3A\nm19Z \u00b7m 28 g\u0303\n\u00fe 1 28\u03c0 X i ln\nm7 Q\u0303i\nm5\u02dc\u0304ui \u00b7m 2 \u02dc\u0304ei\nm3 L\u0303i m3\u02dc\u0304di : \u00f030\u00de\nNote that Q\u0303i, \u02dc\u0304ui, and \u02dc\u0304ei (L\u0303i and \u02dc\u0304di) come from the same 10i (5\u0304i) multiplet in SU(5). As can be seen in the last terms in Eqs. (29) and (30), these sfermions give no contribution if the masses of the components in the same SU(5) multiplet are equal. We also see from Eq. (29) that the scale QG decreases as mW\u0303 , mH\u0303, and mA increase, with the strongest dependence on the wino mass. On the other hand, Eq. (30) shows that \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de increases as these masses increase, whilst it decreases as the gluino mass increases. As shown in Fig. 1, the perturbativity condition sets an upper limit on \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de; this then leads to upper limits on mW\u0303 , mH\u0303, and mA, and a lower limit on mg\u0303. Notice that the above analysis based on one-loop RGEs is insufficient since the two-loop RGE effect is as large as that of one-loop threshold corrections. We perform a numerical computation to include the two-loop RGE effect in the subsequent section.3"

The relation (35) is, however, violated by radiative corrections due to the presence of the SU(6)-breaking interactions, which results in radiative electroweak-symmetry breaking at low energies [40\u201345]. Depending on the mediation mechanism, it is also possible that the SUSY-breaking effect is transmitted in an SU(6)-violating manner. In this case, the \u03bc and B\u03bc terms may receive additional contributions of O\u00f0MSUSY\u00de and O\u00f0M2SUSY\u00de, respectively, which can violate the relation (35) by O\u00f0M4SUSY\u00de.

            "text": "The CMSSM is specified by five input parameters, m0, m1=2, A0, tan \u03b2, and sgn\u00f0\u03bc\u00de. The soft masses, gaugino masses, and the A-terms are set to be m0, m1=2, and A0, respectively, at the GUT scale. tan \u03b2\u2261 hH0ui=hH0di is the ratio between the MSSM-Higgs VEVs. The electroweaksymmetry breaking conditions determine the magnitude of \u03bc, but its sign is undetermined, so is an input parameter. The soft SUSY-breaking terms at low energies are obtained by solving RGEs, which then determine the SUSY spectrum. Despite the limited number of input parameters, the CMSSM is known to provide desirable SUSY spectra which can explain the observed values of the SM-like Higgs boson mass, mh \u00bc 125.25\u00f017\u00de GeV [47], and the\ndark matter abundance, \u03a9DMh2 \u2243 0.12 [48], without conflicting with the current experimental limits (see e.g., Refs. [49\u201356] for recent studies). To show typical GUT-scale spectra for the CMSSM, we consider the following two sets of parameters taken from the benchmark points presented in Ref. [54]:\n(i) m0 \u00bc 14.1 TeV, m1=2 \u00bc 9.8 TeV, A0 \u00bc \u22123m0, tan \u03b2 \u00bc 5, \u03bc > 0.6\n(ii) m0 \u00bc 27.9 TeV, m1=2 \u00bc 9.5 TeV, A0 \u00bc 0, tan \u03b2 \u00bc 4, \u03bc > 0. We use SOFTSUSY4.1.12 [58,59] to compute the SUSY spectra and the gauge coupling constants at the GUT scale QG, which is defined by the condition g1\u00f0QG\u00de \u00bc g2\u00f0QG\u00de. By using Eqs. (20)\u2013(23), we then find\n\u03b15 \u00bc 0.036; \u03bb \u00bc 8.7; MX \u00bc 4.8 \u00d7 1015 GeV; MHC \u00bc 2.2 \u00d7 1016 GeV; \u00f036\u00de\nfor point (i) and\n\u03b15 \u00bc 0.037; \u03bb \u00bc 2.7; MX \u00bc 7.6 \u00d7 1015 GeV; MHC \u00bc 1.1 \u00d7 1016 GeV; \u00f037\u00de\nfor point (ii). We also show the predictions of these two benchmark points by the blue star and red dot in Fig. 1. In both of these cases, \u03bb is predicted to be quite large; in particular, for case (i), \u03bb is almost nonperturbative, so our analysis based on one-loop threshold corrections may not be valid. These results suggest that the requirement of the perturbativity of the \u03bb coupling gives an important constraint on the SUSY mass spectrum. In any case, as we mentioned at the beginning of this section, the minimal NG-Higgs SUSY SU(5) with the CMSSM is incompatible with the p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 bound from the Super-Kamiokande experiment [29,30] due to relatively light SUSY spectra and the restrictive relation among the GUT-scale particle masses. As shown in Refs. [54,56], in the CMSSM, the observed values of the SM-like Higgsboson mass and the dark matter abundance can be reproduced with an O\u00f010\u00de TeV SUSY-breaking scale. To evade the p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 limit in this case, we need a relatively large color-triplet Higgs mass,MHC \u2273 1017 GeV. In the minimal SUSY SU(5), MHC is related to other GUTparameters as\nMHC \u00bc \u03bbH \u00f0M2XM\u03a3\u00de 1 3\n\u00f0g25\u03bb\u03a3\u00de 1 3\n; \u00f038\u00de\nwhere \u03bb\u03a3 and \u03bbH correspond to the couplings for the first and second terms in Eq. (4), respectively. In the minimal SUSY SU(5), these two couplings can be different,\nwhilst in the minimal NG-Higgs GUT model they are related as\n\u03bb\u03a3 \u00bc 2\u03bbH \u00bc \u03bb: \u00f039\u00de\nThe combination \u00f0M2XM\u03a3\u00de 1 3 can be determined via the GUT-scale threshold corrections [33\u201335,60\u201362] as we have done in Sec. III A. It is found that the dependence of this quantity on low-energy SUSY mass spectra is small, with \u00f0M2XM\u03a3\u00de 1 3 \u2243 1016 GeV (see, for instance, Refs. [60\u201362]). To obtain MHC \u2273 1017 GeV, therefore, we need \u03bb\u03a3 \u226a \u03bbH; however, this is incompatible with the relation (39) in the minimal NG-Higgs GUT model. In other words, for a perturbative value of \u03bb, the color-triplet Higgs mass is \u22721016 GeV in the minimal NG-Higgs GUTmodel, and this is too low to evade the proton-decay limit if SUSY particles lie around O\u00f010\u00de TeV. We thus do not explore the CMSSM in more detail and instead consider a high-scale SUSY scenario in what follows."

            "text": "SUSY models with a SUSY-breaking scale ofO\u00f01\u00de PeV have attracted wide attention [63\u201376] especially after the discovery of the Higgs boson [77,78], since in these models the observed value of its mass can easily be explained by means of large threshold corrections by heavy stops [79\u201383]. In addition, the PeV-scale SUSY scenario has several attractive features from a phenomenological viewpoint; (i) the minimal SUSY SU(5) GUT with lowscale SUSY-breaking suffers from the rapid proton-decay 6The opposite sign of A0 with respect to that adopted in Ref. [54] is due to convention [57].\n035016-7\nproblem [84,85], which can be evaded with PeV-scale sfermions [86\u201389]; (ii) the SUSY flavor=CP problems are alleviated [90\u201394]; (iii) the cosmological gravitino problem [95\u2013112] is highly relaxed. In particular, the feature (i) is desirable for the minimal NG-Higgs GUT, given that the proton lifetime limit is problematic in the case of the CMSSM as we have seen in Sec. IVA. A concrete realization of the high-scale SUSY scenario is provided by the assumption that there is no gauge-singlet SUSY-breaking field in the hidden sector. In this case, the soft masses of SUSY particles are induced via gravity mediation and their size is O\u00f0m3=2\u00de, where m3=2 is the gravitino mass. The gaugino masses are, on the other hand, generated only radiatively and thus suppressed by a loop factor compared with m3=2. A famous mechanism for such quantum effect is anomaly mediation [113,114]. In addition to this, threshold corrections by heavy Higgs fields [115], vectorlike matter fields [116\u2013122], or GUT-scale fields [89] give rise to gaugino masses. The Higgsino mass parameter, \u03bc, is given by Eq. (31) in the current model, and in the absence of the singlet SUSY-breaking field, A\u03bb \u00bc 0 at the classical level, whilst the B-term can beO\u00f0m3=2\u00de because of the Giudice-Masiero mechanism [123,124]\u2014we, therefore, expect \u03bc \u00bc O\u00f0m3=2\u00de. We perform an analysis similar to that in the previous subsection for this type of mass spectrum. In the present case, there is a large mass hierarchy between the gauginos and other SUSY particles. We, therefore, take an effectivetheoretical approach, rather than just using SOFTSUSY, in order to avoid large logarithmic corrections. Between the GUT and electroweak scales, we introduce two threshold mass scales\u2014the gaugino and SUSY scales. Below the gaugino mass scale, Qgaugino, the theory is just the SM, while above the SUSY scale, QSUSY, the theory is the MSSM. Between Qgaugino and QSUSY, the effective theory consists of the SM plus gauginos. We use two-loop RGEs for the gauge coupling constants and one-loop RGEs for the Yukawa couplings,7 which we summarize in Appendix A 3. The values of input parameters and the expressions for matching conditions are given in Sec. A 1 and Sec. A 4, respectively. Figure 2 shows the contour plots of (a) \u03bb, (b) \u03b1\u221215 \u00f0QG\u00de, (c)MHC , and (d)MX in theM2\u2013M3 plane, where we set the masses of sfermions, heavy Higgs bosons, and Higgsinos to be 1 PeV and tan \u03b2 \u00bc 3. M2 and M3 are soft SUSYbreaking wino mass and gluino mass, respectively. As seen from Fig. 2(a), the value of \u03bb can be much larger than unity for a large wino mass and/or a small gluino mass; this behavior can be understood from Fig. 1(a) and Eq. (30). In the green shaded regions in Fig. 2, the coupling \u03bb is\nnonperturbative (\u03bb > ffiffiffiffiffi 4\u03c0 p ). On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 2(b), the SU(5) gauge coupling is predicted to be perturbative over the parameter region shown in this figure. The purple-dotted region is excluded by the ATLAS disappearing track search; mW\u0303 > 660 GeV [125]. The red vertical-dashed line corresponds to the wino mass (mW\u0303 \u2243 2.8 TeV [126,127]) with which the observed dark matter density is reproduced with the thermal relic abundance of the wino dark matter. If mW\u0303 > 2.8 TeV, the wino relic is overabundant and we need some nontrivial cosmological history to dilute it. To satisfy the perturbativity condition for the \u03bb coupling, we need a small wino mass and a relatively large gluino mass, where the color-triplet Higgs mass is predicted to be \u22721016 GeV. With this size of MHC , the proton-lifetime limit can be relevant even in the high-scale SUSY scenario. In Fig. 3, we show contour plots of the proton lifetime of the dominant decay modes \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de and \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de in theM2\u2013M3 plane withMSUSY \u00bc 100 TeV, 300 TeV, and 1 PeV, the common masses of sfermions, heavy Higgs bosons, and higgsino. The phase factors \u03c62 and \u03c63 of the Yukawa couplings, which are defined in Sec. B 1, are set to be 0. The blue and yellow shaded areas are ruled out by the current limits, \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de > 6.6 \u00d7 1033 years [29,30] and \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de > 2.4 \u00d7 1034 years [128], respectively, from Super-Kamiokande experiments. The expected 90% CL limits from the 10-year run of Hyper-Kamiokande [129] are shown as the blue and yellow dotted lines, which are \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de > 3.2 \u00d7 1034 years and \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de > 7.8 \u00d7 1034 years, respectively.8 As in Fig. 2, the purple dotted region is excluded by the ATLAS disappearing track search and the red vertical-dashed line corresponds to the mass of the thermal-wino dark matter. We find that the perturbativity condition on \u03bb and bound from \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de give upper and lower limits on the wino and gluino masses, respectively. On the other hand, the bound from \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de gives restrictions on small wino mass and large gluino mass. Consequently, they together give a belt of allowed parameter space in Fig. 3. The boundary of the belt depends on MSUSY; when MSUSY gets larger, the limit from \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de becomes weaker, while the limits from \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de and the perturbativity condition on \u03bb get stronger. For MSUSY \u00bc 100 TeV, a large part of the region motivated by the wino dark matter scenario, M2 \u2264 2.8 TeV, has already been excluded by these limits,\n7Since the Yukawa couplings enter into the gauge coupling RGEs at the two-loop level, the one-loop RGEs are sufficient for the Yukawa couplings.\n8Let us comment on the sensitivities of other future proton decay experiments [46]. The sensitivity of the JUNO experiment to p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 is estimated to be \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de \u00bc 8.34 \u00d7 1033 years for 10-years running [130], while that of DUNE is \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de \u00bc 1.3 \u00d7 1034 years [131]. A relatively new proposal called THEIA [132,133] envisions a sensitivity of \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de > 3.8 \u00d7 1034 years with 800 kton-yrs data. For p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00, the HyperKamiokande experiment will offer much better sensitivity than those of the other experiments [46,134].\n035016-8\nand most of the allowed region can be probed by the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. In addition, the perturbativity bound on \u03bb gives a lower limit on the gluino mass, M3 \u2273 4 TeV, which is stronger than the current LHC limit [135,136]. For MSUSY \u00bc 1 PeV, on the other hand, a sizable region of the parameter space is still allowed, mainly because the \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de bound is fairly weak in this case. A part of this allowed region can be probed at the Hyper-Kamiokande through the \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de channel. Notice that the gluino mass M3 needs to be smaller than the SUSY-breaking scale by at least an order of magnitude in the present scenario since it is supposed to be generated by radiative corrections. This theoretical requirement imposes a limitM3 \u2272 100 TeV forMSUSY \u00bc 1 PeV.9\nThis entire region can be probed if (far) future experiments can have sensitivities to the lifetime of O\u00f01036\u00de years in both the p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 and p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00 channels. Let us finally comment on the uncertainty in our calculation of proton lifetimes resulting from those of the SM parameters. It turns out that the uncertainty of \u03b13 gives the largest influence on our results. It can induce a factor of 2 difference to \u03bb and an O\u00f01\u00de difference to proton decay widths. The uncertainties resulting from the hadron matrix elements are O\u00f00.1\u00de (cf. Appendix B), and the effects of other parameters\u2019 uncertainties are found to be less than O\u00f010\u22122\u00de, which are subdominant. For example, for the point at M2 \u00bc 1 TeV and M3 \u00bc 50 TeV with MSUSY \u00bc 1 PeV in Fig. 3(e), \u03b13 \u00bc 0.1179 0.0009 gives \u03bb \u00bc 0.86\u00fe0.50\u22120.31 , \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de \u00bc 2.2\u00fe2.2\u22121.1 \u00d7 1036 years, and \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de \u00bc 4.1\u00fe2.7\u22121.7 \u00d7 1035 years. In addition, the complex phases \u03c62 and \u03c63 in the GUT Yukawa coupling, which\np\n, which is ruled out by the perturbativity condition. The purple-dotted region is excluded by the ATLAS\ndisappearing track search [125]. The yellow-shaded area is excluded by the current experimental limit on \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00\u00de from SuperKamiokande [128]. The red vertical-dashed line corresponds to the wino mass with which the observed dark matter density is reproduced with the thermal relic abundance of the wino dark matter.\n9For instance, in the anomaly mediation, jM3j\u2243 3\u03b13MSUSY=\u00f04\u03c0\u00de, and thus jM3j \u223c 30 TeV for MSUSY \u00bc 1 PeV.\n035016-9\n035016-10\nare defined in Eq. (B3) in Appendix B 1, can also change the lifetime of proton decay mode p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304. For the model point \u00f0M2;M3;MSUSY\u00de\u00bc\u00f01TeV;50TeV;1PeV\u00de in Fig. 3(e), the lifetime varies \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de \u00bc \u00f02.18\u20132.32\u00de \u00d7 1036 years for \u03c62;\u03c63 \u00bc 0 \u2212 2\u03c0. For the model point \u00f0M2;M3;MSUSY\u00de\u00bc\u00f02TeV;20TeV;100TeV\u00de in Fig. 3(a), the lifetime varies \u03c4\u00f0p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304\u00de \u00bc \u00f03.1\u20139.2\u00de \u00d7 1034 years for \u03c62;\u03c63 \u00bc 0\u20142\u03c0. As we see, the uncertainty from the GUT-Yukawa phases reduces for larger MSUSY. This is because for large MSUSY \u00bc \u03bc, the Higgsino exchange contribution dominates the wino contribution since \u03bc \u226b M2, and in this case the decay amplitude depends mainly on the overall phase factor ei\u00f0\u03c62\u00fe\u03c63\u00de, making the decay rate almost independent of the GUT phases."

            "text": "In this paper, we have studied the minimal NG-Higgs SUSY SU(5) GUT model, which can naturally lead to light Higgs doublets and solve the doublet-triplet splitting problem. The model is more restrictive than the usual SU(5) models and has sharper predictions. We determine all the GUT parameters by using the matching conditions for the SM gauge coupling constants at the GUT scale. We then find that the perturbativity condition on the coupling \u03bb sets constraints \u03b1\u221212 \u00f0QG\u00de\u2273 \u03b1\u221213 \u00f0QG\u00de and MHC \u2272MX. The former constraint restricts the allowed pattern of the lowenergy SUSY mass spectrum through RGEs; we see that this gives upper limits to the wino massmW\u0303 , Higgsino mass mH\u0303, and heavy Higgs doublet massmA, and a lower limit to the gluino mass mg\u0303. To see the implications of these constraints for the lowenergy SUSY spectrum, we have studied two concrete SUSY scenarios; the CMSSM and high-scale SUSY. For the CMSSM, we have found that the perturbativity condition on \u03bb leads to a limit on the color triplet-Higgs mass, MHC \u2272 1016 GeV, and this is too low to evade the experimental limit on p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304, as the SUSY scale is predicted to be O\u00f010\u00de TeV in this scenario. This problem can be evaded in the high-scale SUSY scenario. We have seen that the present bound on p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 gives a lower (upper) limit on the wino (gluino) mass. On the other hand, the perturbativity condition on \u03bb, as well as the bound on p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00, gives an upper (lower) limit on M2 (M3). As a result, we found an allowed band in theM2\u2013M3 plane for a given value of MSUSY. For MSUSY \u00bc 100 TeV, most of the remaining parameter space can be explored at the Hyper-Kamiokande. For a higher SUSY-breaking scale, the constraints from proton decay searches are relaxed and a considerable part of the parameter space is beyond the reach of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. To cover the whole allowed region in the case of MSUSY \u00bc 1 PeV, for instance, we need sensitivities to the proton lifetimes of O\u00f01036\u00de years for both p \u2192 K\u00fe\u03bd\u0304 and p \u2192 e\u00fe\u03c00.\nThe high-scale SUSY scenario in the minimal NG-Higgs SUSY SU(5) GUT can also be tested at future colliders. As we have seen, a relatively light wino mass is favored in this setup and thus can be a good target for future collider experiments. The HL-LHC is expected to probe the wino mass up to \u2243850 GeV [137]. This reach can be extended significantly at FCC-hh, which is expected to exceed the thermal wino dark matter mass mW\u0303 \u2243 2.8 TeV [138]. The FCC-hh can also probe gluinos with a mass \u227213 TeV [139]. The discovery (or exclusion) of these gauginos offers another way of checking the validity of our model; for instance, if their masses are measured,10 we can predict the proton-decay lifetimes as functions of MSUSY, which can be tested in future proton-decay experiments. Although we have focused on the minimal NG-Higgs SUSY-SU(5) GUT in this paper, the same analysis can also be performed in other nonminimal NG-Higgs GUT scenarios, such as the SU(6) GUT model with an SU\u00f06\u00de \u2297 SU\u00f06\u00de global symmetry [13,15\u201319]. We expect that the presence of a global symmetry again gives nontrivial relations among the GUT parameters and thus makes the model highly predictive. We note in passing that NG-Higgs GUT models may be related to extradimensional GUT models (see e.g., Refs. [141\u2013145] for such examples), as suggested by the AdS=CFT correspondence [146], and therefore we may indirectly explore these extradimensional GUT models by probing NG-Higgs GUT models in future experiments."
