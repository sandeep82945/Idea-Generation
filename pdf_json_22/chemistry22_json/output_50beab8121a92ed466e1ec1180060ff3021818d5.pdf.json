The ability to transport electric charges is widely used in chemical energy storage applications such as rechargeable batteries and capacitors,4\u20136 with device power and energy density depending greatly on the electrolyte's ion diffusion7,8 and viscosity9 properties. To advance the performance of capacitors and batteries, it is therefore crucially important to understand the effect of ionic salt addition on the dynamic structure of water at the microscopic level. However, most of the earlier theoretical10\u201315 and experimental investigations11,15\u201318 of ion-specic properties in aqueous solutions have been limited to self-diffusion properties, static solvation shell structure, e.g. effective coordination numbers (ECNs),14,15 and pair distribution functions (PDFs).

However, these concepts are only qualitative, and there is no clear denition by which one could quantitatively classify specic ions in these terms. In addition, dynamic properties of the water shell structure around ions has only recently been investigated by time-dependent, correlated waterion spectroscopy and simulations.19\u201323\nMolecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational tool to study the properties of aqueous solutions and provide atomic-scale insights that are helpful for electrolyte analysis. In MD trajectories, the position of every atom is recorded at each point in time, and these time sequences can be used to identify the element-specic physical, chemical, and dynamical properties of the aqueous solutions.24 However, most MD simulations carried out on aqueous electrolytes are limited in their applicability by the accuracy of the respective classical force elds.19,23 Certain force elds are incapable of describing the basic features of the liquid and thus fail to reproduce experimentally observed ion-specic correlated motion.25 A serious drawback of most classical MD force elds is the use of xed atomic point charges to evaluate the Coulomb interaction between atoms, and incorporating more realistic, spatially extended charge distributions with associated polarizabilities\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As an alternative, so-called \u201crst principles\u201d MD (FPMD) simulations based on density functional theory (DFT),27 also oen referred to as ab initioMD (AIMD),28 can help to overcome the present difficulties of classical force eld methods with ionic charge distributions. Unfortunately, they are computationally rather expensive,29 making it difficult to obtain trajectories of sufficient simulation time length for relevant model system sizes and complexity.30 In this work, we instead employ the density-functional tightbinding (DFTB) method,31\u201333 which is an approximation to traditional DFT that is 100 to 1000 times faster and provides a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.34 Since DFTB is a quantum chemical method and able to compute nuclear forces during MD simulations by solving Kohn\u2013Sham equations on-the-y, DFTB/MD35 trajectories not only provide structural features but also contain information on the electronic structure such as charge distributions. This makes the method attractive for the simulation of electrolyte systems.34,36\nThe aforementioned pair distribution function (PDF) is an important quantity in the analysis of electrolyte structure. It reports the probability of nding a given particle at a distance R from another particle at R \u00bc 0, independent of time. Thus, the PDF can be helpful to understand relative atomic positions and the distribution of the atoms around a particular atom. The PDF can serve as a proper parameter in the solid system where particles do not change their positions with time. However, this \u201cstatic\u201d PDF does not provide information on the timedependent dynamics of correlations between particles that is reported by the Van Hove correlation function (VHF),37 a timedependent incarnation of the PDF. It has been shown that the time required for an atom to lose or gain one neighbor is directly linked to the liquid ow.38 In uids, particles are in constant motion, making local temporal correlations essential to understand the macroscopic transport behavior such as viscosity. For example, the diffusion of ions in aqueous solutions depends on the solution's viscosity, ultimately inuencing the performance of capacitors and batteries that use aqueous electrolytes.\nThe VHF promises to be a powerful tool in understanding the local and correlated motion of aqueous solution as it relates molecular behavior and the macroscopic transport properties simultaneously as a function of positions (r) and time (t). The decay of the rst peak in VHF displays both ballistic-like motion within the rst solvation shell as well as the correlation between ions. Also, the time decay of the rst peak is linked to the viscosity (h) through Maxwell relaxation time sM.39 Hence, the VHF essentially links local microscopic behavior i.e., elementary excitation or the time to lose or gain one neighbor (sLC), to a macroscopic property, namely (sM).38,39 Moreover, the VHF can be obtained from inelastic neutron or X-ray scattering experiments via a double Fourier transform of the dynamic structure factor S(Q, u), where Q is the momentum transfer and E \u00bc \u0127u is the energy transfer in scattering. Thus, computation of the VHF\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nprovides an opportunity for gaining in-depth molecular-level understanding of element-specic collective motion in an aqueous environment on the picosecond timescale by connecting theoretical simulations with experimental studies. It is non-trivial to resolve element-specic correlation from experiment.22 To understand the element-specic temporal correlation of water with various cations, in this work, we simulated the VHF in an aqueous solution with different concentrations of chloride salts.\nDFTB has already been widely used in the literature to explore properties of pure water,40,41 biomolecular systems,42 as well as aqueous electrolytes.43 To the best of our knowledge however, hydration properties of the aqueous solution of most common salts such as NaCl are yet to be explored with the DFTB approach. Further, the use of non-classical methods in the study of VHF is limited to pure water.44 Investigations of the VHF of aqueous solution frommolecular simulations have thus far been limited to classical MD simulations.19,25 Here, we performed MD simulations at the DFTB level on the aqueous solutions of the chloride salts KCl, NaCl, and MgCl2. Our validation against DFT results shows that DFTB can be used to explore the hydration effect of ions within reasonable agreement with rst principles methods in terms of structure and dynamics predictions. Further, we used DFTB for simulating the Van Hove correlation functions, which show the correlated motion of water molecules and ions. We found that the dynamics of the water hydration shell and the water\u2013cation correlation depends signicantly on the type of salt and their ion concentrations."

In the DCDFTB method, the total system is divided into small, overlapping fragments called subsystems and buffer regions. The subsystem density matrices are computed in parallel using the local DFTB Hamiltonian, and electron population is determined according to the estimated, overall system's Fermi level. Ultimately, the density matrix of the whole system is obtained by summing up the subsystem density matrices. This technique helps to speed up the calculation compared to the standard DFTBmethod. To facilitate the DCmethodology in the DCDFTBMD soware, we selected cubic subsystems with side lengths of 3.0 to 4.0 A\u030a and a buffer radius between 5.8 and 6.0 A\u030a to ensure the reliability of energetics, as well as the numerical stability of the simulations.\nModel systems used in the simulation consist of 1, 2, 3, and 4 ion pairs (cation\u2013anion) with 128 water molecules in a cubic simulation box. The size of the boxes were adjusted to afford the experimental water density under the simulation conditions (0.997 g cm 3). The corresponding salt concentrations are 0.42, 0.83, 1.21 and 1.58 mol kg 1 for NaCl, 0.42, 0.82, 1.19, 1.54, mol kg 1 for KCl, and 0.42, 0.80, 1.16, 1.49 mol kg 1 for MgCl2. MD simulations in the NVT canonical ensemble at 298 Kelvin (K) were performed for each model system for a total length of 1.6 ns using the Nose\u0301\u2013Hoover thermostat and a time integration step of 0.5 fs. The rst 100 ps of the trajectory was used for equilibration, and the remaining 1.5 ns of the run was used for analysis, where MD trajectory snapshots were collected every 10 fs. We note that, based on the simulations with different system sizes (1000, 512, 250 and 128 water molecules) for bulk water, Matsumoto et al.44 found that no signicant system size effects are introduced in the smaller systems, and that 128 water molecules are sufficient to study the VHF and its peak behaviors with time. Also, the typical system size used in the study of aqueous ions with AIMD-based simulations is less than or equal to 128 molecules, with the length of the simulation within a few hundred ps. For example, Galib et al.15 used 95 water moles for 80 ps, and Wang et al.14 used 63 water molecules for 50 ps. DCDFTB scheme used in this study allowed us to achieve 1.6 ns simulations on the system of 128 water molecules with less than 30 K CPU hours.\nHere we briey introduce the technique employed to extract the VHF from the MD trajectory. The VHF, G(r, t) between arbitrary particles, atoms or molecules, is dened as:\nG\u00f0r; t\u00de \u00bc 1 4prNr2 X i;j d r ri\u00f00\u00de rj\u00f0t\u00de (1)\nwhere r is the average number density of particles, N is the number of particles in the system, ri(t) is the position of the ith particle at time t, and d(r) is Dirac's delta function. Hence, the VHF expresses the probability for a particle at the origin r \u00bc 0 at time t \u00bc 0 nding another particle at distance r, at time t. For the element-specic analysis, one can dene a partial VHF Gab(r, t) between atoms of specic chemical element type a and b as:\n25502 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25500\u201325510\nGab\u00f0r; t\u00de \u00bc 1 4pNaNbr2 X iefag X jefbg d r ri\u00f00\u00de rj\u00f0t\u00de (2)\nwhere Na and Nb are the numbers of atoms of species {a} and {b}, respectively.\nIt is worth mentioning that the VHF, G(r, t) in eqn (1) can be decomposed into two quantities: (i) the self-correlation, a measure for particle diffusion, representing the probability of nding a particle i at time t under the assumption that this same particle was at the origin at t \u00bc 0, and (ii) the distinct correlation, representing the probability of nding a particle j that is different from i at time t under the assumption that particle i was at the origin at time t \u00bc 0, i.e. The latter describes collective motions for distinct particle pairs. The distinct correlation at time t \u00bc 0 is identical to the conventional, static PDF, g(r).

In that study, the DC-DFTB3-D3(BJ)/3obmethod was found to reproduce the overall nature of the VHF and decay characteristics of various peaks in very good agreement with experiment.44\nFor the purpose of this work, we rst compared the hydration shell structure of cations obtained from DFTB/MD simulations with the ab initio MD (AIMD) results reported by Wang et al.14 as shown in Fig. 1. We found generally very good agreement between the DFTB/MD and AIMD PDFs for the position of the cation's rst solvation shells, with differences not exceeding 0.2 A\u030a. In the case of the Mg\u2013O PDF, the peak positions are in nearly perfect agreement, and only the intensity of the second peak is somewhat underestimated in DFTB/MD. For both Na+ and K+, the height of the rst peak in the DFTB/MD cation\u2013water PDF is likewise somewhat underestimated, whereas here the intensity of the broader second peak is in excellent agreement between DFTB/MD and AIMD. We believe this level of agreement is acceptable since slight deviations in peak position and the height of the PDF are not expected to limit the understanding of the overall trends in the hydration structure of different cations, their effects on the water structure, or the effect of concentration changes. It is further important to recognize that AIMD performed with various DFT functionals can also lead to different PDF peak positions and intensities.14,52"

We have plotted the Cl\u2013water PDF gCl\u2013O and its running coordination number (nCl\u2013O) in Fig. 2. All cations have very similar nCl\u2013O with the rst peak located z3.1 A\u030a. Only a slight difference is observed when comparing gCl\u2013O of the MgCl2 system at a distance between 5.5\u20136 A\u030a to those of the KCl and NaCl systems. This observed feature in MgCl2 agrees qualitatively with the study performed with Xrays and classical MD simulations of MgCl2 solutions.16 Also, the running coordination number of Cl with O (nCl\u2013O) in the inset in Fig. 2 is identical for all cations, and it lacks any plateau indicating the continuous distribution of water molecules around chloride ion without dened solvation shell. The similar nature of chloride\u2013water PDF and coordination distributions in three cations suggests that the effect of Cl in water structure will be the same, irrespective of the cation. We therefore conclude that the specic trend observed among the cations regarding water structure and dynamics pertains to cationic features.\nTo understand the effect of various cations as well as their concentrations on the static structure of pure water, we have plotted its crucial O\u2013O PDF, gO\u2013O, as well as the O\u2013H PDF, gO\u2013H, in Fig. 3 for all simulated systems. In comparison to gO\u2013H, which seems only affected by salt concentrations in the height of its rst peak at 1.9 A\u030a, the gO\u2013O of the ionic solutions shows a more signicant deviation from pure water. Although the position of the rst peak corresponding to nearest-neighbor O\u2013O correlations at 2.8 A\u030a remains unchanged with the addition of different salts, the intensity of this peak signicantly decreases with an increase in salt concentrations. This decrease is consistent with experimental observations and was explained previously as a result of the conuence of multiple ion\u2013O pair positions whose positions coincide with the water O\u2013O peak.23\nThe greatest overall variation of the O\u2013O PDF as function of salt concentration is observed for K+, with Na+ a close second, and the least variation is visible in that for Mg2+, which is consistent with the order of the respective ionic radii: the ionic radius of K+ is 1.38 A\u030a and that of Na+ is 0.95 A\u030a while it is smallest for the Mg2+ dication with 0.65 A\u030a. Such a trend was previously noted and is consistent with greater solvent exchange reactivity for larger cations.14 In regards to salt concentration changes, we note that deviations of the gO\u2013O from pure water increases with higher number of ion pairs in the solution, and that these deviations tend to \u201csmear out\u201d the pronounced static water structure with increasing salt concentrations.\nThe observations above suggest that the salt ion pairs are partially breaking the hydrogen bond structure of water in their vicinity, with Mg2+ having a less disruptive effect than Na+ and K+. In the following, we analyze in greater detail the solvation structure of different metal (M) cations using the cation\u2013water PDFs, gM\u2013O, and the cation\u2013oxygen coordination number nM. The PDFs shown in Fig. 4 represent the distribution of water oxygen atoms at various distances around the cations. The positions of the rst peak in the PDF provides an average of the shortest cation\u2013oxygen distance, rmax, which are consistent with the ordering of the cationic radii mentioned above.

The Mg\u2013O running coordination number reaches a well-dened plateau at 2.5 A\u030a indicating the rst hydration shell, and the number of water molecules in its rst hydration shell is 6. The nature of the Na+ running coordination curve lies between that of K+ and Mg2+, but the number of water molecules in its rst hydration shell is also 6. The size of the hydration shell around cations is typically a function of their ionic radii, where smaller ions tend to feature a more welldened hydration shell and larger ions are associated with more poorly dened hydration shells.\nFor larger ions such as K+, when there is no clear plateau in the running coordination number, the cation\u2013O coordination number is not sharply dened, which does not allow a clear denition of the number of water molecules participating in the rst hydration shell. For such poorly dened coordination shells, various empirical techniques have been devised to estimate an approximate cation coordination number.14,15,53,54 In our study we have employed the technique proposed by Hoppe55,56 who suggested to estimate an average M\u2013O distance and derive from it the so-called effective coordination number (ECN). The average distance, lav, is dened as:\nlav \u00bc\nP i li exp\n\" 1\nli\nlmin\n6#\nP i exp\n\" 1\nli\nlmin\n6# (3)\nwhere the summation runs over all oxygen neighbors of a particular cation, and lmin is the smallest cation\u2013O distance in the ith cation\u2013oxygen polyhedron. The ECN is dened as:\nECN \u00bc X i exp\n\" 1\nli\nlav\n6# : (4)\nBased on this denition of lav, the ECN derived from it represents the ion coordination, based on the weighted average distance of the central cation to its nearest neighboring O atoms.\nTable 1 shows that the average cation\u2013O distance is largest for K+, decreases for Na+ and becomes smallest in the case of Mg2+, consistent with their cationic radii. In each case the distances, rmax, obtained from the PDFs from the centroid of a tted Gaussian distribution function, are slightly larger than the ones estimated from eqn (3) dening the lav. The deviation\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nbetween rmax and lav is highest for K +, which could be expected based on its more diffuse hydration shell. There is no signicant variation between the cation\u2013O distances with changes in salt concentration, as previously noted for the M\u2013O PDFs. The calculated average distances lav are 2.90 A\u030a for K\u2013O, 2.35 A\u030a for Na\u2013O, and 2.09 A\u030a for Mg\u2013O. We nd good agreement between average distances obtained from our DFTB/MD simulations with previously reported AIMD and experimental results for Na\u2013 O and Mg\u2013O, see Table 1. The K\u2013O distance is slightly (z0.1 A\u030a) overestimated compared to the experimental value, nevertheless it lies within the range reported from a previous AIMD simulation. Among the three cations considered, the ECN is highest for K+, followed by Mg2+ which is close to Na+, Table 2. Although the ECNs do not change much with the salt concentration, we nd that alkali metal ECNs are slightly higher at higher concentration (1.6 mol kg 1) compared to the lower concentration at 0.80 mol kg 1. Only in the case of Mg2+, its ECN remains almost unchangedz5.64 A\u030a within the considered concentration range. Our calculated ECNs at 1.6 mol kg 1 concentration 6.86 for K+, 5.54 for Na+, and 5.64 for Mg2+, are in reasonable agreement with values reported in the literature from AIMD and experiments, see Table 2. In the case of Mg2+, its ECN is slightly underestimated by z0.36 compared to AIMD and experimental values. On the other hand, its running coordination number at the plateau in Fig. 1(c) indicates a hydration number of 6, which exactly matches the literature values, Table 2. This indicates that Hoppe's denition of an ECNmay not give consistent results across ions with different cationic charges.\nIn summary, we nd that DFTB/MD simulations paint a picture consistent with experimental and available AIMD data, where the largest cation under investigation here, K+, features\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

On the other hand, the loss of a pronounced water shell structure in the static PDF with increasing salt concentration, is more visible in the case of the alkali metal ions, and least noticeable for the Mg2+ cation. Nevertheless, our analysis of the effect of salt ions on the static water structure is consistent with that of a structure breaker or chaotrope, in the approximate order K+ > Na+ > Mg2+."

            "text": "Fig. 5 shows the total VHF, G(r, t) of pure water and the aqueous ionic solutions of KCl, NaCl, and MgCl2 salts at a concentration of 1.2 mol kg 1 molality. Notably, a comparison of the water VHF at room temperature between experiment and various simulations on different potentials previously showed that DFTB/MD could reproduce experiment very well. The rst peak of the pure water VHF at t \u00bc 0 is atz2.8 A\u030a and the second peak is at z4.5 A\u030a, consistent with the static PDF of pure water. As time elapses, the rst peak position moves towards higher values of r and the second peak position moves towards lower values of r.44\nAs discussed above for the static PDFs, the addition of ions can signcantly inuence the water VHF and even introduce distinct new spectral features. Unless otherwise noted, we focus on a salt concentration of 1.2 mol kg 1 molality for clarity, and is sufficient to illustrate the important effects of the salt ions on the water VHF. As was the case for the static water\u2013water PDFs for different salt concentrations shown in Fig. 3, the total VHFs depicted in Fig. 5 as a time series in panel (a) and as a heat map in panel (b), likewise feature a signicant intensity decrease in the rst peak corresponding to nearest-neighbor O\u2013O correlations at 2.8 A\u030a. This nding is qualitatively consistent with the classical MD simulations for aqueous sodium salts reported in ref. 22.\nFig. 5 (a) Total VHF of pure water and the aqueous solution of KCl, simulations.

At rst glance it is immediately apparent that the pure water VHF is the spectrum with the most pronounced features, in particular for longer periods of time. This is particularly true for the intensity and long-time decay of the features corresponding to the second and third peaks at z4.3 and 6.5 A\u030a. These peaks can be attributed mainly to the O\u2013O pair correlation with molecules in the second and third self-solvation shell. They are less pronounced for the KCl and NaCl salts, with MgCl2 being somewhat in between the other salts and pure water in terms of these longtime decay features. Second in prominence is a feature that is easily overlooked in the time series plots but clearly visible in the heat maps, namely the delayed decay of the rst peak corresponding to nearest-neighbor O\u2013O correlations at 2.8 A\u030a for all salt solution VHF spectra. At time scales above 0.5 ps, this peak merges with the peak intensity originating from intramolecular self- and distinct pair correlations, and this merger is a characteristic feature for all ionic solutions. We further note in regards to the rst peak that over time it seems to develop a slight shoulder structure at z3.21 A\u030a which corresponds to interactions between water oxygen and the chloride anion. We note that qualitatively similar observations were previously made in experiment and classical MD simulations for Na+ salts with different anions.22 An interesting observation can be made for Mg2+, where this delayed decay of the rst peak is highly prominent, yet the decrease of intensity and long-time decay features for the second and third peaks at z4.3 and 6.5 A\u030a are less pronounced.\nMore information can be extracted from the decay behavior of the rst-neighbor VHF peak,19 which is related to transport properties and viscosity as they are directly linked to the correlated motions between neighboring particles.20,21,25 The height, G(t) and area under the curve A(t) of the rst peak is shown in Fig. 6 for pure water and the three salt solutions at\nNaCl, and MgCl2 with m \u00bc 1.2 mol kg 1, computed from DFTB/MD solid lines, dashed lines, and dashed-dotted lines represent the sum of F, G(r, t) 1; color bar represents the intensity from 0.1 to 0.1.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

R 0 1 and R 00 1 are the local minima on the le and right to R1, respectively. The decaying behavior can be tted by using a two-step relaxation function. To this end, following the approach described in ref. 22,44, we have tted A(t) (t # 0.75 ps) to a compressed exponential function of the form A(t)\u00bc a1e( t/s1)g1+a2e( t/s2)g2, where s1 and s2 represent the relaxation times of the rst-step and second stepdecay. The tting results are listed in Table 3. Unsurprisingly, the values obtained here for pure water are in good agreement with the DFTB/3obw values reported previously.44 It is notable, however, that our results for the aqueous NaCl solution also agrees with the corresponding experimental results previously reported by Shinohara et al.23 The addition of NaCl leads to a decrease in a1 and an increase in a2. Likewise, a1 decreases with the addition of KCl and MgCl2, while a2 decreases for KCl and remains unchanged for MgCl2. s1 remains almost\nTable 3 Fitting results of the first peak area for the first-step decay, A(t), of the VHF\nModel a1 s1 g1 a2 s2 g2\nPure water 0.439 0.154 1.657 0.060 0.440 1.386 KCl 0.295 0.158 1.712 0.105 0.721 7.540 NaCl 0.232 0.139 1.887 0.138 0.626 1.853 MgCl2 0.314 0.158 1.784 0.094 0.994 8.810\nFig. 7 Height of first peak, G1(t) as a function of time: (a) KCl, (b) NaCl a\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nunchanged with the addition of salts, with some decrease associated with s1 for NaCl. This nding indicates that the rst step decay of pair correlation is not signicantly changed with the addition of salts. However, s2 increases signicantly with the addition of salts, indicating that the addition of salts induces a slower second step-decay behavior. KCl and MgCl2 exhibit a similar decay behavior among the three salts, in and order of decay time s2 decays as Na\n+ z K+ < Mg2+. An increase in salt concentration will further increase the decay time of the rst peak height, as shown in Fig. 7.\nSince the concentrations of the aqueous ionic solutions under study are relatively low, most of the features of the total VHF are dominated by O\u2013O correlations. To analyze the ionspecic correlation function in greater detail, we have also computed partial VHFs and their intensity maps for water\u2013ions, shown in Fig. 8. O\u2013Cl partial VHFs, Fig. 8(a) and (b) show that the rst peak located between 3 and 4 A\u030a is similar in all three cations, which is also the case in the static PDF shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, it is worth pointing out that the O\u2013Cl correlation in the rst peak Fig. 8(b) is extended in time compared to O\u2013O peak correlations observed in pure water VHF Fig. 5(b). Our nding of a slow decay of the water\u2013Cl rst peak correlation agrees qualitatively with the experimental study performed on NaCl solutions.23 The second peak between 4 and 6 A\u030a shows some ion-specic features. Namely, (i) in MgCl2, the second peak is more diffuse in space compared to NaCl and KCl. (ii) Time correlation of the second peak is shortest for KCl, followed by NaCl and MgCl2.\nNext, we discuss the feature of water-cation VHFs depicted in Fig. 8(c) and (d). All three cations give rise to their rst peak at the sum of ionic radii with the oxygen, namely, 2.78 A\u030a for K, 2.35 A\u030a for Na, and 2.05 A\u030a for Mg. The decay of the rst O-M peak is remarkably slow, as it remains clearly visible at time t \u00bc 1.5 ps irrespective of the salt type, indicating a strong association between the cation and the water molecules in the rst solvation shell. The second peak, located between 4 and 6 A\u030a, shied towards higher values of r and is short-lived in K+ compared to Na+ and Mg2. The third peak remains only visible for NaCl, which is located at a slightly shorter distance than it appeared in the total VHF of pure water, Fig. 5(d). The partial O\u2013Na VHF indicates that there are long-lived correlations between water and Na+ over long distances, unlike in the case of K+ and Mg2+.\nTo summarize our observations on the effect of ions on the dynamic structure of water, we nd a common picture\nnd (c) MgCl2 at various concentrations.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25500\u201325510 | 25507\nFig. 8 (a) and (b) Cl\u2013O, and (c) and (d) cation\u2013O partial VHFs, Gab and their corresponding heatmap of partial VHFs, Gab 1; color bar on heat maps represents the intensity from 0.1 to 0.1.

The peak intensity and long-time decay of the VHF features corresponding to the second and third peaks at z4.3 and 6.5 A\u030a are generally less pronounced in the salt solutions when compared to pure water. The nearest-neighbor O\u2013O interactions for the salt-containing systems decay slower and merge with intramolecular VHF features in the heatmaps, different from that of pure water. Among the salt solutions, Mg2+ shows the slowest decay of pair correlations, with Na+ and K+ exhibiting similar decay characteristics. Partial VHF analysis indicates that the O\u2013M correlations within the rst solvation shell of the cations decay remarkably slowly, with the decay of the second solvation shell being less pronounced for Mg2+ and Na+.

This opens the possibility to employ the method to fundamentally understand the local correlated motion of water with salt ions through the VHF dynamic pair correlation function, which is not easily accessible to AIMD simulations due to the required simulation system sizes and timescales.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The Mg2+ appears to have the smallest effect on the static PDF of pure water, and we nd the following order of the cations with respect to their ability to disrupt the water network: K+ > Na+ > Mg2+. This is consistent with the fact that pair correlations in the VHFs of the salt solutions are decaying slower than for pure water, irrespective of the type of salt, with Mg2+ showing the slowest correlation decay. Partial VHF analysis indicates that the O\u2013Mcorrelations within the rst solvation shell of the cations decay remarkably slowly, with the decay of the second solvation shell being least pronounced for Mg2+ and Na+. Surprisingly, the sodium cation exhibits the longest-lived correlations with water motions around it, indicating more pronounced long-range effects on water dynamics.\nOur combined quantum chemical simulation of the effect of cations on the static and dynamic structure of water further gives credibility to the thesis that it is difficult to draw a clear line between chaotrope and cosmotrope ions, as all ions are delaying correlation decay in their solutions, with Mg2+ having the least impact on the static water structure but greatest impact on its dynamic correlations.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors have no conicts to disclose."
