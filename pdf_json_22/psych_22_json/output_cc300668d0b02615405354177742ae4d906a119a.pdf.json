The aim of this study was to\nestimate the prevalence of subthreshold depressive episode (SDE) and major depressive\nepisode (MDE) and to examine the association between social and economic factors\nwith SDE and MDE in undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nparticipants were 1,577 college students from a university in the south of Chile (64.6%\nfemales, 22 years old on average). The participants took an online survey in November\n2020 which collected information about social and economic variables, depressive\nsymptoms, and perceived social support. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression\nanalysis were used. The results showed a high prevalence of SDE (14.3%) and MDE\n(32.3%) in the sample. Belonging to a social group and perceiving positive social support\nwere the only variables examined that were associated with SDE. Instead, female sex,\npoorer quintiles, living with other relatives but not parents, economic difficulties due to the\npandemic, being a parent, and perceiving positive social support were associated with\nMDE. Subthreshold and threshold depressive symptoms are frequent in college students,\nand associations with social and economic factors differ according to the level of such\nsymptoms. These results should be considered in the development of tailored preventive\nand early interventions for depression in college students.\nKeywords: depression, subthreshold depression, socioeconomic, college students, social support"

            "text": "Depressive disorders in youth are an important public health concern, ranking fourth among the leading causes of disabilityadjusted life-years in the 10\u201324 age group (1). In college students, depression is one of the most frequent mental health disorders, with a weighted mean prevalence of 30.6%, higher than in the general population (2). Recent data from college students from eight countries showed a lifetime prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) of 21.2% and a 12-month prevalence of 18.5% (3).\nSubthreshold depression is characterized by the presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms, which fall short of the criteria for major depressive disorder (4). There is still no consensus in the literature on the definition of subthreshold depression, for example, regarding the impairment, number, and duration of symptoms (4\u20136). Various concepts have been used to refer to the same phenomenon (e.g., subsyndromal, subclinical, minor, or mild depression) (5, 6). Despite the differences in definition, it has been observed that people with subthreshold depression possess higher chances of developing major depressive disorder (4, 7) as well as other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or disruptive disorders (8) and suicidal ideation (9). In the general population, subthreshold depression has been associated with an increased risk of mortality (10) and has considerable economic costs, approaching those of major depression (11). Although subthreshold depression is less severe than major depression, its high prevalence makes its impact on public health an important concern (10, 12).\nRegarding the social and economic factors associated with depression in the university population, it has been reported that maintaining positive family relationships, having the possibility of sharing problems with others (13), enjoying strong social support (14), and not having problems with friends (15) are negatively associated with depression. In contrast, gender, economic variables, age, and ethnicity show inconsistent results. Some studies report that women show higher levels of depression (15\u201318), while other studies have found no gender differences (13, 19\u201322). Similarly, some studies have found that students from families with a lower income (19, 20), lower socioeconomic status (15), lower parental education (20), housing problems, and larger family size (16) have more depressive symptoms. In contrast, other studies have not found any differences by economic income (13, 15, 22) or parental education (15). Regarding ethnicity, Liu et al. (17) found lower odds of depression in Hispanic, Black, and Asian students, whereas other studies have not found an association between ethnicity and depression (20). Regarding age, studies have reported higher levels of depression in older students (17, 20, 22), while others have observed no differences by age (15, 19, 21). Differences in the measurement of depression could partially explain the above inconsistencies, however, some differences may be related to the level of depressive symptoms, such that some social and economic variables could have a differential impact according to the severity of depression, which may not be captured in previous studies.\nIn this context, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of the population, especially\nadolescents and young people (23). Depression symptoms, anxiety, and sleeping issues have been shown to be the most frequent in university students (24, 25). Specifically for depression, recent meta-analyses indicate a prevalence of 30 to 37% among university students (24, 26\u201328). Also, differences in prevalence have been found in connection with geographical area, financial situation, and living arrangements (24). Inconsistent results have been found regarding the sex/gender variable (27). In addition, themonth of data collection and geographical region were determined to be significant moderators of the prevalence (27). Perceived social support, one of the most frequently studied variables, exhibits an inverse association with depression among students (e.g., (29)). Furthermore, the effects of the pandemic have also been found to increase subthreshold depression in the general population (30) and children (31). To the best of our knowledge, no data are available on subthreshold depression in college students during the pandemic.\nIn this regard, to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of university students, authors have suggested exploring its intensity in connection with social and economic factors in various geographical areas (24). Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of subthreshold depressive episode (SDE) and major depressive episode and to examine the association between social and economic factors with SDE and MDE in undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic."

MDE diagnosis was assigned to students who responded more than half the days (2) and nearly every day (3) in five or more items of the PHQ-9, of which at least one should be item 1 or 2. For both diagnosis criteria, SDE and MDE, item 9 was considered present if the respondent\u2019s answer ranged from several days (1) to nearly every day (3), according to the diagnostic algorithm of the instructional manual of the PHQ-9 (37).\nThe Functional Social Support Questionnaire (Duke-UNC11) (38). This is an 11-item self-report instrument that assesses perceived social support in two dimensions: confidant support (the possibility to discuss and share important matters with a confidant) and affective support (such as emotional support and caring). It has a 5-point ordinal response scale ranging from 1 = as much as I would like to 5 = much less than I would like. In this study, the total score was used, which is obtained by adding up the scores for each item and which ranges from 11 to 55 points. Lower scores indicate poorer perceived social support.

In addition to the instruments mentioned above, a self-report questionnaire was included to collect information on sociodemographic, social, and economic variables. The variables included were sex (0=male, 1= female), age (in years, recoded as 1 = 17\u201319, 2 = 20\u201324, and 3 = 25 or more), indigenous ethnicity (0 = no, 1 = yes), lives with (1 = mother, father, or both, 2 = other family members, 3 = other), parenthood (0 = no, 1 = yes), economic quintile (from I to V), economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic (0 = no, 1 = yes), inadequate study conditions (0= no, 1= yes), and social group membership (e.g., volunteer, religious, sports, political or artistic group, among others) (0 = no, 1 = yes). Economic quintile is the distribution of per capita family income of the population divided into five equal parts. Quintile I is composed of the bottom 20% of the population in terms of income, while quintile V is composed of the top 20% (40)."

Additionally, differences in perceived social support scores according to diagnosis criteria were examined by one-way ANOVA. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine social and economic factors related to SDE and MDE. The dependent variable was the diagnosis criteria for depression: No depression (ND), SDE and MDE, with ND being the reference group. The independent variables were sex, age, indigenous ethnicity, lives with, parenthood, economic quintile, economic difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, inadequate study conditions, social group membership, and perceived social support. All the independent variables examined were entered simultaneously into the regression model in order to observe the effects of each social and economic factor adjusted for the effect of the other independent variables. Relative risk ratios (RRR) were reported for each independent variable in the multinomial logistic model. The analyses were carried out using Stata 16."

First, it was observed that almost half of the students met criteria for either SDE or MDE, with MDE being more frequent. A higher prevalence of MDE was observed particularly in females, students who did not live with their parents, who belonged to the lowest economic quintiles, who reported economic difficulties due to the pandemic, who reported inadequate study conditions, and who did not belong to a social group. In contrast, a higher prevalence of SDE and a lower prevalence of MDE was observed in those belonging to the economic quintile V (highest income group).\nOur data indicate a prevalence of depression during the pandemic similar to that reported in multiple meta-analyses (24, 26\u201328). Globally, it can be asserted that the pandemic has worsened the mental health of university students (27). Nevertheless, it is worth bearing in mind the heterogeneity in depression levels among countries (41). Thus, students in countries such as Turkey have exhibited a major impact (42), unlike those in Sweden, for instance, where rates stayed relatively stable (43). Specifically, in Chile, authors have observed an increase in depressive symptomatology relative to prior research, especially among young population (44). Similar results have been reported for other countries in the region (e.g., (45, 46)). As for subthreshold depression, we found no specific references covering the situation of university students during the pandemic. Nevertheless, a Pre-pandemic study in China reported levels higher than those found in this study (47) but similar to those reported by Chilean adolescents (34).\nSecond, differences were found in how social and economic factors relate to the level of depressive symptoms. Belonging to a social group and perceiving positive social support were the only\nvariables that had a negative association with SDE, controlling for the other social and economic variables. Instead, female sex, poorer quintiles, living with relatives other than parents, and economic difficulties due to the pandemic were positively associated withMDE, while being a parent and perceived positive social support were negatively associated with MDE. These results are partly in line with previous studies, before and during COVID-19, which showed a relation between social and economic factors and depression (14\u201321, 24, 26, 48) but expand onwhat has been reported in the literature by showing differences in the association according to the level of depressive symptoms.\nContrary to expectations, the results showed an inverse gradient in the association between income quintile and MDE. We believe that this result could be an effect of the consequences of the pandemic on family income, since by July 2020, 59.4% of households had seen their income decrease and 30.1% of the respondents had lost their jobs due to the pandemic (49), but public policies to help families economically initially focused on the people with the lowest income, with benefits being subsequently extended to the most vulnerable 80% of the population (i.e., quintiles I to IV) (50).\nSpecifically perceived social support was the only variable related to both SDE and MDE. This variable has been instrumental in reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of university students (29, 48, 51). Also, regarding subthreshold depression, the participants who were affiliated to a social group exhibited less SDE, which is a novel finding. Thus, belonging to a social group can probably enable students to establish social networks with peers, which, in the presence of subclinical depressive symptoms, can enhance their\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 893483\npsychological wellbeing during a pandemic. The fact that social group membership was associated with SDE but not with MDE may suggest that at higher symptom severity group membership alone is not a factor that in itself acts as a buffer for MDE. Thus, the social support resources that students with MDE may be needed as a protective element would be based on the perception of effective social support rather than group membership per se.\nOne of the main limitations of this study is its cross-sectional design, which does not make it possible to establish causal relationships between the variables. Also, the response rate obtained and the fact that the sample is from only one university in southern Chile probably means that the results are not representative of the entire university population at the national or regional level. However, the response rate is within the range of response rates (between 7 and 17%) obtained in previous studies using online surveys with university students (3). Furthermore, in this study, the PHQ-9 was used to classify students into ND, SDE, and MDE groups as in previous studies (34, 35), however, this instrument does not offer sufficient grounds for a diagnosis and does not take into consideration the possible impairment caused by the symptoms, so the categories account for the presence of a set of symptoms that occur at a specific time and do not constitute a clinical diagnosis (37). Considering that we did not use a random sampling and that the prevalence of depression may vary according to the time at which the assessment was taken, population differences and instruments used, comparisons between countries should be made with caution.\nThe results presented confirm that MDE interventions in university settings must consider students\u2019 social and economic characteristics. In addition, they support that MDE and SDE prevention must not only target the most economically vulnerable students. Indeed, it is the wealthiest group that exhibited the most SDE, while the poorest 80% of students (quintiles I-IV) exhibited the most MDE. Also, in this context, offices of students\u2019 affairs must prioritize initiatives that promote social relationships and institutional support networks in settings that go beyond the merely academic. Specifically, our findings suggest that young people\u2019s participation in social groups could operate as a buffer against SDE. SDE exhibited no differences\nin connection with the variables examined, thus, subthreshold symptoms during that period were common to all groups, encouraging to explore other variables that might be found to be linked to subthreshold depression in the future; and also to explore which possible dimensions of perceived social support are related to different levels of depressive symptoms."
