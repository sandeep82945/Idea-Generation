    "abstractText": "This paper aims to investigate and measure Bitcoin and the five largest stablecoin market volatilities by incorporating various range-based volatility estimators to the BEKK\u2013GARCH and Copula\u2013DCC\u2013GARCH models. Specifically, we further measure Bitcoins\u2019 volatility related to five major stablecoins and examine the connectedness between Bitcoin and the stablecoins. Our empirical findings document that the connectedness between Bitcoin and stablecoin market volatility behaviors exhibits the presence of stable interconnection. This study is of particular importance since it is crucial for market participation in the ongoing crypto assets to be informed about both the volatility patterns of major cryptocurrencies and the relative volatility of Bitcoin against the stablecoin markets. Eventually, we find that there is no systematic evidence for the various parity deviations of the stablecoins that are profoundly impacted by Bitcoin volatility. Thus, Bitcoin and the largest stablecoin Tether could stabilize together. However, Bitcoin shall not be generalized to other stablecoins in terms of stability results.",

            "text": "In the past year, USD-pegged stablecoins streaming on public blockchains have been more attractive and seen explosive growth. Moreover, the growing pieces of literature on the price and volatility dynamics of cryptocurrency markets have attracted widespread attention to the fluctuation in Bitcoin as well as stablecoin prices. The crypto assets may also support a more inclusive financial system through the growth of decentralized finance (Defi). Stablecoins play a crucial role in the decentralized financial system in that their value is typically pegged to fiat currencies, (e.g., USD and CNY), or two precious metals, (e.g., gold and silver) and stablecoins, and their growth could fluctuate innovations in the digital asset economy. Stablecoins are designed as an alternative to conventional cryptocurrencies. Regarding more inclusive payment and financial systems, stablecoins have the potential role to fluctuate growth and innovation in payment systems, allowing for faster, cheaper payments. Additionally, the stablecoins are always decentralized and bridge fiat currencies with traditional digital currencies due to their pegging mechanism. Unlike conventional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have value-preserving properties and could hedge risk for other volatile assets during the market crash, such as the stablecoin gain as major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ether) fall after Russia attacks Ukraine. According to Reuters, stablecoins, which are digital tokens pegged to risk-free currencies such as the US dollar, held profits on time during a sell-off in risky assets such as stocks and Bitcoin after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. (https://www.reuters.com/technology/stablecoins-gain-bitcoinether-fall-after-russia-invades-ukraine, accessed on 24 February 2022). According to a Wall Street Journal report (See https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/ russia-ukraine-latest-news/card/ukrainians-buy-dollar-pegged-stablecoin-amid-russian-\nAxioms 2022, 11, 259. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11060259 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nAxioms 2022, 11, 259 2 of 21\nattack-vGCCIQbH4CQx3Tl4V5D1, accessed on 25 February 2022), Ukrainians buy dollarpegged stablecoin amid the Russian invasions. Post the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, particularly, the market demand for pegged-stablecoins for low-volatility crypto asset instruments has rapidly accelerated the development of stablecoins. Sidorenko [1] also points out that the crypto asset market trend is moving towards the direction of converting fund flow to several representative low volatile cryptocurrencies. The decentralized stablecoins are also designed to be the fiat-collateralized digital-tokens maintaining a fiat currency reserve to exchange market or safe-haven assets, see also Wang et al. [2]; Xie et al. [3]. As their name indicates, collateralized stablecoins are introduced to offer price stability against the relatively high volatile cryptocurrencies to hedge the risk of financial market crashes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Thus, two questions naturally arise:\n(1) How can stablecoins stabilize cryptocurrencies? What potential role will stablecoins perform in the violent price fluctuations in conventional cryptocurrencies? (2) How do they play the roles of the gold- or USD-pegged stablecoins as safe-havens, diversifiers, or hedges against conventional cryptocurrencies during the financial crisis?\nTo highlight the development of the Fintech ecosystem, the study makes two major contributions. Firstly, the usage of additional information is linked to closing and additionally low and high prices in its estimation of the BEKK and Copula\u2013DCC GARCH models. These models are commonly used to capture the volatility co-movement across the cryptocurrencies and improve the empirical estimation of the covariance matrix of volatilities. Secondly, the other contribution is to provide fresh, insightful arguments to this increasing attention in research regarding their embedded exchange rate stabilization mechanisms, and then demonstrate conditional correlations and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and the top five stablecoin markets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering literature to investigate the Bitcoin range-based volatility linkages across the five major stablecoin markets and discuss whether the volatility of stablecoins is driven by the volatility jump of Bitcoin. From a practical perspective, this issue is more important because closing prices are widely available with a corresponding daily close, high, and low price for current financial markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and Section 3 introduces the methods and econometric model. Section 4 performs the competing econometric models and analyzes the estimation results, and Section 5 concludes."

            "text": "Broadly speaking, Ito et al. [4] document that stablecoins are designed to be a stabilization mechanism backed by either fiat currencies or precious metals under a fixed exchange rate regime among cryptoassets. To reduce the excessive volatility of cryptocurrencies, an effective mechanism is to peg their value to fiat currencies. Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj [5] observed that parity deviations of the major stablecoin Tether are deeply impacted by Bitcoin volatility. As previous studies empirically investigated, Griffin and Shams [6] reported that the timing of Tether purchases following market downturns lead to Bitcoin\u2019s dramatic price rise. Furthermore, other works of stablecoins have shown their safe haven features, (e.g., Wang et al. [2]) and their price stabilization mechanisms in the light of pegged exchange rate regimes for fiat currencies, (e.g., Lyons et al. [5]). On the contrary, is the stablecoin potentially employed to boost Bitcoin prices? Wei [7] investigated the largest stablecoin, Tether, but he had not found any evidence that Tether\u2019s manipulation led to the 2017 Bitcoin rally. In addition, Kristoufek [8] also found no evidence of stablecoins flourishing at the prices of other cryptocurrencies. Amid the rapid growth of the new digital financial market ecosystem, the priority for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is to preserve ready public access to government-issued, risk-free currency in the digital financial ecosystem. Thus, CBDCs could coexist with stablecoins. Theoretically, Tether\nAxioms 2022, 11, 259 3 of 21\nbased on blockchain is a peer-to-peer payment and transaction cryptocurrency. However, it is the most secure stablecoin with a value pegged to the US dollar. In simple terms, a US Tether token is one US dollar at all times. Similarly, Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj [9] show no systematic evidence that Tether issuances are impacted by the prices of major non-stable cryptocurrencies, (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum). Given the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are developed as the stabilization mechanism to maintain a stable market value as they are pegged to another safe-haven asset (Wang et al. [7]; Xie et al. [3]). Given the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, a few pieces of literature have investigated whether stablecoins are truly diversifiers or stable. Considering the stability of stablecoins, Hoang et al. [10] document that Bitcoin is a likely source of excessively volatile stablecoins and uncover significant evidence that stablecoins are the driver of the excessive volatility of Bitcoin. Moreover, a new strand of study has been examined by Grobys et al. [11], who found strong evidence that stablecoin volatility spills over to Bitcoin. Considering the rapid development of stablecoins in the Fintech system, it is beneficial to expand the frontiers of knowledge of stablecoins. Perhaps surprisingly, most pieces of literature only investigate the stablecoins\u2019 response to sudden shocks in Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility or the interplay between stablecoins and Bitcoin. The current work looks to contribute to the studies by analyzing the interactions between the stabilities of the top five stablecoins. This study suggests that the stabilization mechanism plays an important role in interpreting the volatility connectedness between stablecoins. Accordingly, we attempt to fill this gap and aim to expand the scope of research of Hoang and Baur [10] and Grobys et al. [11] and examine whether there is the existence of volatility spillovers among Bitcoin and stablecoins. To investigate the possibility of volatility transmission, we apply the VAR\u2013BEKK\u2013GARCH and Copula\u2013DCC\u2013GARCH models for the daily rangedbased and GARCH volatility estimation of six major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Tether, USD Coin, Binance, Terra, and Dai. The BEKK model was proposed by Baba et al. (1990) [12] and Engle and Kroner (1995) [13]. In practice, the VAR\u2013BEKK\u2013GARCH model is empirically applied in this work, also named the flexible multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) specifications. Empirically, we also use the VAR Granger causality models to investigate the range-based volatility interactions among Bitcoin and the largest five stablecoins. These models can be used to simultaneously predicate the volatility spillover effect across the major cryptocurrencies under considerable information related to open, high, low, and closing prices in the BEKK\u2013GARCH and Copula\u2013DCC\u2013GARCH estimations (see, e.g., Fiszeder [14]; Tan et al., [15]; Brandt et al. [16]; Li et al. [17]; Fiszeder et al. [18]; Moln\u00e1r [19]; Jacob et al. [20], Todorova et al. [21]). Similarly, the multivariate GARCH methodology provides further interpretations of the innovation shock transmission among two or more markets. The BEKK and DCC\u2013GARCH models are widely used because they are the most popular classes of competing models, and the multivariate GARCH models often capture the volatility dynamics of financial time series (see, e.g., Bauwens et al. [22]; Block et al. [23]; Mensi et al., [24]). Our paper uncovers the interactions of volatilities between the leading Bitcoin and stablecoin markets. Furthermore, our paper contributes to increasing interest in research on emerging Fintech ecosystems."

Bt denotes the standard Brownian motion. By Ito\u2019s lemma, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price after taking the natural logarithm is given by:\ndlnSt = (\u00b5\u2212 1 2 \u03c32)dt + \u03c3dBt (2)\nSeveral alternative variance estimators have been proposed to estimate the parameters under this hypothesis about the distribution of a cryptocurrency price. Assuming Ct, Ot, Ht, Lt represent the log of the closing, opening, highest, and lowest price on date t, respectively. \u03c3\u0302 is the volatility to be estimated. Parkinson [25] develop the first range-based estimator and employed the high and low values to measure the variance which satisfies\n\u03c3\u03022PK = 0.3607(Ht \u2212 Lt) 2 (3)\nwhere the factor 0.3607 is equal to 14ln2 . Afterward, Garman and Klass [26] expanded the Parkinson\u2019s method by incorporating the opening and closing prices into the equation. Rogers and Satchell [27] release this restriction that includes a nonzero drift term and develops an estimator and hence is theoretically more efficient than the range-based estimator (3). Their volatility estimator is shown below\n\u03c3\u03022RS = (Ht \u2212 Ct)(Ht \u2212Ot) + (Lt \u2212 Ct)(Lt \u2212Ot) (4)\nAlternative Range-Based Volatility Measures.

Parkinson found the daily volatility estimator, (i.e., PARK estimator) based on the postulate that the intra-daily prices follow Brownian motion given as Equation (2). This study incorporates the GARCH model of the PARK range to identify shocks via time-varying volatility. In the previous study, the specification is also called GARCH\u2013PARK\u2013R model. Consider the covariance stationary time series {RPK} and PARK estimator is given by:\nRPK = 1\u221a\n4ln2 (Ht \u2212 Lt) (6)\nwhere RPK represents the PARK-range of the crypto asset at time t.

This paper investigates the volatility spillovers among six major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Tether, USD Coin, Binance, Terra, and Dai, which are substituted into the mean equation outlined below. Empirically, the VAR (1)\u2014BEKK\u2013GARCH (1, 1) methodology proposed by Engle and Kroner [13] is applied to examine the volatility linkages among these six variables. The conditional mean of the bivariate VAR (1)-GARCH (1, 1) model can be given as the following specification:{\nRPK,t = \u00b5 + \u03a6RPK,t\u22121 + \u03b5t \u03b5t = H1/2t \u03bet\n(7)\nAxioms 2022, 11, 259 5 of 21\nwhere, RPK,t = (RBPK,t, R S PK,t) \u2032 represents a 2 \u00d7 1 vector for each pair of Bitcoin volatility against stablecoins volatilities (Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD, Terra USD, and Dai). \u03a6 represent a (2 \u00d7 2) matrix of coefficients of the form \u03a6 = (\u03c61 0 0 \u03c62 ), and \u03b5t = (\u03b5Bt , \u03b5 s t) \u2032 is distributed as the vector of the random noises of the conditional mean equations for Bitcoin and stablecoin volatilities, respectively. In addition, H1/2t refers to a symmetric positive definite (2 \u00d7 2) matrix and \u03bet = ( \u03beBt , \u03be s t )\u2032 is the vector of i.i.d. random noises. RPK,t also indicates the estimators based on Equation (3) to measure these variables. For the sake of exposition, the conditional variances of the VAR (1)\u2014BEKK\u2013GARCH (1, 1), and then the covariance matrix can be given by:\nHt = CC \u2032 + A ( \u03b5t\u22121\u03b5t\u22121 \u2032)A\u2032 + BHt\u22121B\u2032 (8)\nwhere Ht denotes the variance-covariance matrix, A, B represent the square coefficient matrices that are diagonalized to ensure covariance stationarity, and C denotes an upper triangular matrix.

Let us postulate that the conditional variance for each price changes, hij,t follows a bivariate GARCH process, and can be expressed as\nhij,t = cij + \u03b1ij \u03b5 2 ij,t\u22121 + \u03b2ij hij,t\u22121 (12)\nwhere \u03b1ij is the short-term persistence, or ARCH effect, of shocks to changes i, \u03b2ij denotes the GARCH effect, and \u03b1ij + \u03b2ij measures the long-term persistence or volatility clustering. The joint Gaussian log-likelihood function for T number of observations is postulated to the conditional distribution of these variables. Consequently, estimating the VAR (1)- BEKK\u2013GARCH (1, 1) model, can be performed by the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) methodology. In general, the Gaussian log-likelihood function for example k = 2 in the bivariate model is given as follows\nlog L = \u22121 2\nT\n\u2211 t=1\n[ klog(2\u03c0) + \u03b5t Ht\u22121\u03b5t \u2032 + ln|Ht| ] (13)\nAxioms 2022, 11, 259 6 of 21"

VAR Granger-Causal Perspective To examine whether Bitcoin inflates the volatility of stablecoins, one can determine whether it shall be the crucial factor driving volatility in stablecoin markets. To enhance the causal perspective, in this study, the VAR Granger causality test is used in order to examine the stochastic interdependences between the volatility movement of Bitcoin and stablecoins. Following Grobys et al. [11], we employ this approach instantly to the rangebased volatilities. Assuming a 6 \u00d7 1 vector \ud835\udc80\ud835\udc61 as \ud835\udc80\ud835\udc61 = (\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc61)\u2032, we use the vector autoregression (VAR) model as follows: \ud835\udc80\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc84 + \ud835\udc681\ud835\udc80\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \u22ef + \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc80\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d + \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc61, (20) where \ud835\udc681, \u2026, \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc5d represent 6 \u00d7 6 parameter matrices, and \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc61 is the residual term distributed as \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc61 \u223c (0, \u03a3\ud835\udc96).

Results of Range-Based Volatility Approaches The six panels of Figure 1 depict the time series of the three measures in the rangebased volatility of BTC and stablecoins. The top panel exhibits the daily realized volatility of BTC. Perhaps not surprisingly, the measure of the stability of BTC exhibits a highly volatile nature. The second panel plots the daily range-based volatility of Tether implying less volatility; the third panel shows relative stability of the daily range-based volatility of USD Coin; the fourth, and fifth panels depict the historical volatility of Binance USD and Terra USD, respectively. The bottom panel also reports the relative stability of the daily range-based volatility of Dai. Specifically, the range-based volatility with the statistics for the Bitcoin variation corresponds with the analogous findings in the realized volatility of Grobys et al. [11]. As evidenced in the first four moments depicted in Table 2, the visual impressions are conducted by the summary statistics for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of cryptocurrencies' volatilities, respectively. Thus, we observe that Bitcoin implies the highest average volatility based on the RS estimator accounting for 3.92%, while the average volatility of stablecoins in the range between 0.36% (PK estimator of USDT) and 1.03% (GK estimator of DAI). Thus, the average volatility of non-stablecoin (BTC) is profoundly larger than the average stablecoin volatilities. This is a crucial stylized empirical fact that we can obtain from each ranged-based volatility series. It also follows that the unconditional distribution of range-based volatility measures (GK, RS estimators) is highly skewed (24.75, 28.40) of stablecoins (USDC), implying evidence of asymmetry. We further suggest that all cryptocurrency volatilities exist widely as heavy-tailed. Indeed, one can measure this statistical phenomenon through the excess kurtosis metric.

The time series evolution of the calculated cryptocurrency volatilities from their range-based estimators in Equations (3)\u2013(5). In summary, an important stylized empirical fact emerges from Table 2 and Figure 1 and infers that there is a heavy-tail phenomenon in all cryptocurrency volatilities, see also Chen, et al. [31]. To estimate the volatility of various crypto assets, we first employ the range-based volatility approaches, and the results are depicted in Table 2. As stablecoins and digital token markets are in the emerging stage and developing economies, the Fintech savvy in this crypto ecosystem may cause information asymmetry in market participation as their transaction strategy. From the empirical evidence of stablecoins, our finding emphasizes properties common to the argument that the volatility dynamics of large-cap stablecoins can be explained to drive the smaller-cap ones. Thus, stablecoin users can lightly convert the various stablecoins into the other cryptocurrency market."

            "text": "The BEKK\u2013GARCH model is used on the stationary series to explore both conditional covariance and conditional correlations. Hence, we apply this approach to study the volatility co-movement between Bitcoin and stablecoins. Table 3 reports parameter estimates for the five scenarios via the BEKK\u2013GARCH (1, 1) model. In this multivariate modeling, \u03c6i i = 1, 2, 3, and 5 are statistically insignificant rejecting any relationship in volatility co-movement among the Bitcoin against various stablecoins, except for BTC versus Terra USD (\u03c64). Turning out to the findings of the spillover effect in Bitcoin and stablecoin markets, the BEKK\u2013GARCH estimation shows the unidirectional spillovers from the Bitcoin market to the Terra USD market. Overall, the evidence demonstrates that the volatility shocks of the Bitcoin market results and the coefficients are insignificant. Thus, it can be reasonably interpreted that volatility shocks in Bitcoin could not have a significant impact on other stablecoins. The result is in line with the finding of Zie\u0328ba et al. [32], who argued insignificant shock and volatility spillovers from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies. However, the findings are different from many papers that concentrate on interconnecting that the most important cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) are manipulated by the stablecoin (Tether), such as Griffin and Shams [6], Hoang and Baur [10] and Grobys [11].

The evidence of various causal relationships is shown in Table 5. Unsurprisingly, there is no directional causality transmission from the BTC market to the five stablecoin markets (Tether, USD Coin, Binance Coin, Terra, and Dai), supporting no volatility spillover from the BTC prices to the stablecoin prices. Unsurprisingly, the Granger causality among the BTC, Tether, USD Coin, Binance Coin, Terra, and Dai markets is less pronounced. There is perhaps mean reversion in equilibrium stablecoin prices under the market correction mechanism even though parity deviations of the major stablecoin are strongly affected by Bitcoin volatility. However, our results suggest that the high volatility of BTC fails to Granger-cause stablecoin price changes at the 5% significance level. In addition, the stablecoin price changes fail to Granger-cause high volatility of BTC at the 10% significance level.

            "text": "In this paper, we investigate the range-based volatility of stablecoins and conduct a new specification of the BEKK model to examine their potential stochastic interconnection with Bitcoin volatility. Our results provide fresh empirical insights and arguments that Bitcoin volatility exhibits relatively well-behaved statistical distributions due to a theoretical variance convergence, (e.g., Grobys et al., 2021 [11]). Although the presence of temporary deviation, the stablecoins\u2019 volatilities are considerably more stable and contemporaneously respond to Bitcoin volatility under the reversion mechanism. In addition, there are no bidirectional Granger causal interactions between lagged Bitcoin volatility and stablecoins\u2019 volatilities. Consequently, we suggest that excessive Bitcoin volatility is not a crucial component that is driving the stablecoins\u2019 volatility. Our study provided evidence for the absence of volatility spillover linkage across the largest cryptocurrency BTC and major stablecoins. Crucially, Bitcoin could coexist and interconnect with stablecoins. In summary, our study sheds light on exploring the volatility movements of Bitcoin and the interrelation with stablecoins\u2019 volatility. Our results infer that Bitcoin volatility exhibits more erratically in the statistical property. Moreover, the volatilities of stablecoins exist with more stability. Bitcoin could co-stabilize with stablecoins. We have also presented an empirical application to the five most heavy transactions in the stablecoins markets, namely Tether, USD Coin, Binance, Terra, and Dai. In this study, we find no evidence to show the destabilizing effects of Bitcoin and stablecoins. Our\nAxioms 2022, 11, 259 20 of 21\nempirical results, using the Granger causality test based on the specification of the VAR model, support the absence of volatility spillovers across the Bitcoin and stablecoin markets. We also infer that parity deviations of the major stablecoin Tether have been slightly affected by Bitcoin volatility. The result is analogous to Wei (2018) [7] who investigated the largest stablecoin Tether and its impact on Bitcoin and documented the impossible price manipulation in Bitcoin. Finally, USD-pegged stablecoins are described as a \u2018crypto finance ecosystem\u2019 specifically decentralized finance (DeFi) that is responsible for fueling demand for stablecoins that has led to rapid growth. Regarding volatility behavior for Bitcoin and the top five stablecoins, low and high prices express crucial information about the volatility movement of crypto assets. From a volatility trading strategies perspective, the study provides policy implications for crypto investors and portfolio managers to hedge the crypto asset\u2019s risk by adding stablecoin. We expect that the findings from this research can be useful to provide strategic insights for crypto investors and portfolio managers to recognize the stablecoins\u2019 precise guiding mechanism in cryptocurrency markets. Empirically, as we report, some stablecoins such as Tether and Terra USD (UST) have lost their peg on two occasions during the global COVID-19 crisis of March 2020. Accordingly, crypto investors may be cautious with stablecoin adoption in their portfolios to diversify the portfolios\u2019 risk from Bitcoin volatility to the greatest possible extent for value protection. As shown in the above results, the major range-based volatility measures provide consistent results; however, the efficiency of these estimators and the role of stablecoins\u2019 safe haven are not discussed in this study and will be left to further work.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.-S.C.; methodology, K.-S.C.; software, K.-S.C.; investigation, K.-S.C.; resources, S.-H.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.-H.C.
