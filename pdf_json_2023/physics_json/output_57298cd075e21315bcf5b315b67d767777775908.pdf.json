Magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-based nanosystems for multiple-purpose applications were developed for these unmet needs. Methods: This study fabricated novel trifunctional MNPs of Fe3O4@PLAPEG for drug release, MRI and magnetic fluid hyperthermia. Result: The MNPs provided a significant loading of curcumin (\u223c11%) with controllable release ability, a high specific absorption rate of 82.2 W/g and significantly increased transverse relaxivity (r2 = 364.75 mM-1 s-1). The in vivo study confirmed that the MNPs enhanced MRI contrast in tumor observation and low-field magnetic fluid hyperthermia could effectively reduce the tumor size in mice bearing sarcoma 180. Conclusion: The nanocarrier has potential for drug release, cancer treatment monitoring and therapy.\nPlain language summary: In this study, the authors designed and fabricated novel magnetic trifunctional nanoparticles of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG. The 8.5 nm Fe3O4 core was covered with the polymeric matrix of PLAPEG to encapsulate an anticancer agent of curcumin at a content of about 11%. Curcumin release from the nanoparticles (NPs) could be controlled by applying a remote alternating magnetic field. The NPs enhanced MRI contrast, which allowed the authors to better distinguish the tumor and surroundings in MR images, which would help monitor treatment. The heat that NPs generated when applied to a field at low intensity could effectively reduce the tumor size in mice bearing sarcoma 180. The nanocarrier, therefore, has potential for cancer treatment monitoring and drug release conjuvant with magnetic hyperthermia therapy.\nFirst draft submitted: 11 May 2022; Accepted for publication: 17 November 2022; Published online:"

In general, these NPs consist of a solid, inorganic core encapsulated by a shell, normally of soft matter, and frequently including functional molecules of a drug or targeting agent [2].\nAmong the core materials, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are leading candidates for biomedical applications, owing to their superparamagnetic properties [7\u201314]. For instance, MNPs can experience a force in an applied gradient magnetic field in bioseparation or drug delivery [15]. When localized in a biological environment, MNPs can create inhomogeneities of the local magnetic field, thus influencing the magnetic relaxation rate of water-containing tissues. That is why they have been intensively investigated and are now used as agents for MRI contrast enhancement in clinical diagnostics [16\u201321]. Probably, one of the most attractive properties of MNPs is the so-called magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), which is based on their capability to adsorb energy from an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to generate heat via their Ne\u0301el and/or Brownian relaxation dissipation [11,22]. When inserted into tumor tissues, MNPs can kill cancer cells by increasing the local temperature, because cancer cells show stronger thermal cytotoxicity than normal cells [23]. Therefore, MNPs have been intensively studied for their use as potential MFH agents in cancer treatment [24\u201326]. Among the MNPs, Fe3O4 MNPs have been the most intensively studied thanks to their suitable magnetic properties, biodegradability, biocompatibility and ability to be functionalized and drug encapsulated [27].\nFunctionalization of MNPs is an important step; with a biocompatible coating layer, not only do the MNPs become stabilized and protected from further oxidation but in many cases this process can also impact the magnetic properties of the core [28\u201331]. Several studies on iron oxides have shown that due to the interaction of the coating material with the NP surface, the magnetization might be decreased or increased depending on the ligands used, as well as the encapsulation procedure [28,30]. Regarding the coating material, beyond silica and carbon, most of the materials that have been studied are various types of polymers [10,14,32\u201336]. Recent studies have shown that using copolymer is very effective for encapsulating MNPs to disperse them in water [32,33,35]. A hydrophobic monomer such as polylactic acid (PLA) can anchor well on iron oxide NPs, whereas a hydrophilic monomer such as PEG can exhibit a good dispersibility in water. To additionally make the magnetic nanocarrier capable of delivering chemical therapy, several molecular drugs, including folic acid, doxorubicin, dopamine and curcumin have been loaded onto MNPs [37\u201342]. Among these drugs, curcumin can exhibit great pharmacological potential, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative and chemosensitizing, cell cycle arrest potential, and can display apoptotic potential against various cancer cells such as colorectal, breast, pancreatic and colon cancers, there-\n1678 Nanomedicine (Lond.) (2022) 17(22) future science group\nFe3O4@PLA-PEG/curcumin: MRI, MFH & drug delivery Research Article\nfore renders it great potential in cancer prevention and therapy. Notably, the IC50 of curcumin in healthy cells is significantly higher than that in cancer cells [43]. It was used in this study as a model for drug delivery and release of nanocarriers.\nThe potential of using an Fe3O4-based nanocarrier as both a drug release and hyperthermia agent has been reported in several works [40,41]. MRI and MFH are important on their own [44\u201347] or are sometimes found in combination [48]. However, few reports have shown experimentally the fabrication of a nanocarrier simultaneously demonstrating the optimal performance of MRI, drug release and MFH. In 2011, although doxorubicin-loaded \u03b3-Fe2O3 NPs were evaluated for their ability in diagnosis and hyperthermia, no in vivo experiment was carried out [49].\nSaturation magnetization (Ms) is well known to be one of the most important factors in all the biomedical applications of MNPs. The magnetic force, F, in manipulation application is defined as linearly proportional to Ms [15]. The relaxation rate (R2) in MRI is approximately proportional to (Ms\u00d7VNPs)2, where VNPs is the volume of the NPs [17,18]. The specific absorption rate (SAR) is dependent on magnetization [50] and magnetic anisotropy [51\u2013 53]. Therefore, Ms should be carefully evaluated for the applications of MRI and MFH. In addition to Ms of the MNPs, the field strength (H) and frequency (f ) of the magnetic field used should also be considered in in vivo MFH experiments. There are some criteria for H\u00d7f product for in vivo MFH. For example, the Atkinson\u2013Brezovich criterion requires the H\u00d7f product to be lower than 5 \u00d7 108 A/(m\u00b7s) [54]. However, according to the Dutz\u2013Hergt criterion, this number could be ten-times larger to obtain safety for in vivo experiments [55]. Most authors used a higher field than the Atkinson\u2013Brezovich criterion, while some reports even used a much higher field than the Dutz\u2013Hergt criterion in their studies [56].\nIn this study, the authors aimed to fabricate functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 NPs using amphiphilic PLA-PEG copolymer as a biodegradable coating material. A thorough chemical and physical characterization, including magnetization, magnetic heating performance and nuclear relaxation rate, was carried out. In addition, in vivo MRI and MFH tumor treatment experiments were carried out to show the effectiveness of the nanocarriers. Utilization of the NPs as the carriers for curcumin, a thermally stable anticancer drug [57] with control release ability, is presented to show the true multifunctional potential of the fabricated biomedical nanocarrier. The novelty of this study arises from the trifunctions of the MNPs and the lower field used in the in vivo MFH-mediated drug-release experiments than those in other studies using Fe3O4-based NPs."

Distilled water was used for all experiments.\nSynthesis & characterization of chemical, structural & basic magnetic properties PLA-PEG copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization reaction between lactic acid and PEG in the presence of catalyst Sn(Oct)2 [58]. PLA-PEG copolymer (molecular weight of 10 kDa) was dissolved in DCM (1 mg/ml) and stirred for 24 h; then H2O was added to form a mixture, which was stirred for another 24 h to disperse PLA-PEG copolymer from DCM to H2O. DCM solvent was then evaporated to obtain a dispersion of PLA-PEG copolymer in H2O (1 mg/ml).\nFe3O4 NPs were synthesized by the coprecipitation method (based on previous work) [59]. Complex Fe3O4@PLAPEG NPs were fabricated from suspensions of readily fabricated Fe3O4 and PLA-PEG NPs through the procedure described in Thong et al. [60]. In brief, 20 ml of Fe3O4 NPs dispersed in water at the concentration of 3 mg/ml was slowly dropped into 20 ml of 0.3 mg/ml PLA-PEG copolymer solution and stirred for 24 h to obtain Fe3O4@PLAPEG NPs (suspension A). The suspension was stored at room temperature (22\u201332\u25e6C) for more than 90 days and no aggregation was observed by eye. To get a more concentrated suspension, suspension A was introduced to a rotary vacuum evaporator. To prepare Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur, 1 ml of 4 mg/ml curcumin dissolved in C2H5OH was slowly dropped into 10 ml of suspension A and stirred for 48 h, and then ethanol was allowed to evaporate to obtain Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur aqueous suspensions.\nCrystal structure was determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique in D8 Advance Bruker equipment.

Detailed characterizations of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur were carried out in a previous work [60]. Herein, the authors present only the crucial properties of the systems. First, XRD patterns of all three samples (Fe3O4, Fe3O4@PLAPEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur) showed six clearly defined diffraction peaks, very similar, independently of the sample, which correspond to the typical (200), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) diffraction peaks of spinel structure (Supplementary Figure 2 in ESI). This suggests that the formation of multicompositional NPs, Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur, does not affect the crystal structure of Fe3O4. This may result in the conservation of magnetic properties of the system, which is discussed in the next section. The average size of the core nanocrystal, dc, estimated from the XRD profile via the Scherrer formula, was \u223c8.5 nm (Supplementary Table 1 in ESI), which is in good agreement with the size obtained by TEM (8.5 \u00b1 2.6 nm) (Figure 1 & Supplementary Figure 3A in ESI). Field emission\u2013scanning electron microscopy images (Supplementary Figure 3B in ESI) show the morphology of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur samples. NPs can be seen as mostly spherical. The Fe3O4 MNPs functionalized by PLA-PEG and PLA-PEG/Cur are fairly uniform in size, with an average diameter, dNPs, of about 10\u201312 nm, which is a few nanometers larger than the size of the bare Fe3O4 MNPs. The hydrodynamic sizes (dh) of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur suspensions measured in water are shown in Supplementary Figure 4 (ESI). Fe3O4 NPs present an average hydrodynamic size of 37 nm, which is larger than the size obtained by TEM measurement. The average hydrodynamic size of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG\nfuture science group www.futuremedicine.com 1681\nResearch Article Thong, Huong, Tu et al.\nrises to 45 nm, while this number of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur NPs is 52 nm. Dynamic light scattering data with narrow size distributions (Supplementary Figure 4 in ESI) and the zeta potential (Supplementary Table 1 in ESI) of the samples with values from -21.2 mV to -40.9 mV show that the samples were well dispersed and stable.\nThe Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur NPs were analyzed by TGA (Figure 1D & E) in order to estimate experimentally the mass contribution of nonmagnetic coating materials (i.e., PLA-PEG and curcumin) in the samples. The first weight-loss step in both diagrams around 100\u25e6C corresponds to the evaporation of water present in the samples. The next weight-loss step at above 300\u25e6C along with the exothermic peak in the differential thermal analysis curve is assigned to the decomposition of the organic components. The mass percentages of the organic components calculated from the initial mass of the precursors (i.e., Fe3O4, PLA-PEG and curcumin) of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur were 9.1% and 25%, respectively. The values determined by TGA were 13.6 and 24.9%, which were quite compatible to the amount of the original ligands. The higher weightloss percentage in Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur compared with Fe3O4@PLA-PEG proves once again the presence of curcumin in Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur. The curcumin content in Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur NPs was then calculated to be \u223c11%. The data also indicate that the mass percentages determined by TGA are in good agreement with those obtained from the initial composition."

The slight decrease in Mc of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur NPs compared with that of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG NPs can result from the oxidation of the core in the process of curcumin loading onto the NPs.\n1682 Nanomedicine (Lond.)

For the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG sample, however, there is an evident change in the evolution of the R2 relaxation rate with increasing concentration, and the linear behavior is apparently lost after 1 mM. This observation suggests that the presence of curcumin in the core of Fe3O4@PLAPEG/Cur may help reduce the attraction between the MNPs and make the curcumin-loaded conjugates better dispersed than the nonloaded ones at high concentrations, which is important for the final biomedical application.\nThe obtained relaxivity values, r1 and r2 (calculated in the linear concentration region), are collected in Table 1."

The temperature versus time curves were recorded for different AMF (Supplementary Figure 6 in ESI). As depicted, the heating rate rapidly increases with increasing field, and the therapeutic window for hyperthermia therapy, 40\u201345\u25e6C, can be easily reached within around 10 min by modifying the amplitude of the AMF during the treatment. To get a better insight into the hyperthermic effect of the MNPs, the authors calculated the heating efficiency or SAR (Supplementary Table 2 in ESI). The obtained SAR values were calculated for the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur samples measured at a frequency of 178 kHz and Fe concentration of 1.63 mg.ml-1. The obtained SAR values follow an H2 dependence (Supplementary Figure 7 in ESI), as expected according to the linear response theory [66]. Although the H\u00d7f values for the experiments were slightly higher than the Atkinson\u2013Brezovich limit [54], many other studies also used fields with higher H\u00d7f values [67\u201369]. The calculation of the intrinsic loss power (ILP), SAR/(f\u00d7H2), gave a value of 11.5 nHm2kg-1 (H = 3600 A/m; f = 178 kHz) for Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur sample, which is appreciably greater than those commercial iron oxidebased NPs reported in the literature (e.g., Resovist presents an ILP of 1.5 nHm2kg-1 [61]). The PLA-PEG and Cur might contribute to improvement of the SAR and ILP value of the NPs. A recent study has reported that SAR and ILP were influenced by size and the structure of iron oxide nanoflowers, which depended on the polyacrylic acid concentration during the synthesis [70].\nEffective release by remote AMF-mediated control The first experimental series for curcumin release efficiency was performed in five samples after applying the same AMF field of 5040 A/m for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min. The release percentages of all analyzed samples are depicted in Figure 3. It is clear that longer exposure time, simultaneously with the higher temperature reached in the solution, resulted in a higher curcumin release. After 20 min under the applied AMF, the curcumin amount loaded in the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur was almost fully released and reached plateau.\nOn the other hand, the passive curcumin release in an incubated bath at 37\u25e6C, as shown in Figure 3, reached a saturation release level of about 80%, only after 24 h. Isothermal AMF release rates for the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur\n1684 Nanomedicine (Lond.) (2022) 17(22) future science group\nFe3O4@PLA-PEG/curcumin: MRI, MFH & drug delivery Research Article\nferrofluid were estimated by varying the field and time for the solution to reach 37\u25e6C and 45\u25e6C. The experimental conditions are described in Table 2.\nThe UV-VIS spectra and calculated curcumin released amounts are depicted in Supplementary Figure 8 (ESI). As shown in Table 2, the stronger the magnetic field, the shorter the time required to reach the temperature, and the curcumin released amount depends on both the temperature and the duration to reach to that temperature. This allows the drug release to be controlled by adjusting the magnetic field strength and/or AMF exposure time.\nFrom the inductive heating curve in Supplementary Figure 9 (ESI) & Table 2, the authors could estimate the initial release rate as equal to 40%/h and 51%/h at T = 37\u25e6C and 45\u25e6C, respectively, which are in agreement with the values of 18%/h and 26%/h observed by Purushotham and Ramanujan [40]. The application of AMF made the release faster and more efficient compared to passive release. The faster rate accompanied by higher percentage release that was observed for the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur nanocarrier as compared with other reports [40,71] might originate from different functionalizing materials and/or drug molecules, namely thermosensitive polymer and doxorubicin [40], PLA and pluronic F127 [72] and alginate [71].\nIn vivo MRI experiments MR images were taken for control mouse A and tumor-bearing mice B, C and D. For mice C and D, 10 and 50 \u03bcl of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG magnetic fluid were directly injected into their tumors. Figure 4A shows the images of the tumor region in the mice right after injection.

As depicted, all tumor positions could be clearly seen at all times and MNPs were observed dispersing in the tumor over time.

For the treated mice with 5-day-old cancer, the tumor volume decreased strongly, so that 50% of them exhibited almost a disappearance of the tumor after three MFH treatments. The effect could be seen right after the first MFH treatment when the tumor surface clearly shrank with the appearance\n1686 Nanomedicine (Lond.)

After treatment time, the eschar fell off by itself and left a scar behind where fur could grow back normally. For the treated mice with 10-day-old cancer, although the tumor did not disappear totally after treatment, its development was seriously inhibited. The growth after 3 treatments of 5-day-old tumor was 600%, which is equivalent to 37\u201338% compared with the tumor growth in the control group (1600%; Figure 6B). For the 10-day-old tumor, the treatment effectiveness was lower but still clearly evident as compared with untreated mice (Figure 6).\nObservation of regrowth of the tumor after the treatment was performed starting at day 1 after the last MFH therapy. The graphs obtained for the two categories of cancer mice are presented in Supplementary Figure 10 (ESI). For the mice with cancer that was 5-day-old, the tumor continued to decrease for 4\u20135 days after the last MFH treatment and remained unchanged for the following 2 days after that. Eight days after the treatment, the tumor seemed to develop but at such a slow rate that at day 14 the tumor was almost of the size observed just after the treatment (Supplementary Figure 10A, ESI). For the mice with 10-day-old cancer, Supplementary Figure 10B (ESI) depicts that 4\u20135 days after the last MFH therapy, the tumor volume slightly decreased, and it started to grow again after the day 5 post-treatment, so that on day 14 it reached 150% growth rate as compared with the size after the last treatment."

            "text": "PLA-PEG is an amphiphilic copolymer in which PEG hydrophilic chains tend to extend outside, while PLA hydrophobic chains arrange inside the micelles. The NPs could be encapsulated via the PEG segment [73] and curcumin is loaded into the NP carrier (Supplementary Figure 1 in ESI). For Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur NPs,\nfuture science group www.futuremedicine.com 1687\nResearch Article Thong, Huong, Tu et al.\ncurcumin molecules might penetrate into the copolymer micelles\u2019 center with PLA hydrophobic segments (as observed in the authors\u2019 previous Cur/PLA-PEG nanosystems [74] and other reports [58,75,76]). The increase in the hydrodynamic size of the Fe3O4 MNPs compared with their size obtained by TEM can be explained by the adsorption of OH- ions and H2O molecules through hydrogen bonding in the aqueous solution onto the surface of the Fe3O4 MNPs. The hydrodynamic size of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG rises due to the water expansion of the hydrophilic PEG component in the outermost shell of the particles. A similar observation has been reported [77,78]. The curcumin present in the core of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur may lead to an increase in the size of the core, and therefore the overall size of NPs when in water (Supplementary Table 1 in ESI).\nThe \u223c10% increase in the net magnetization of the NPs after coating and drug loading shows an important role of surface functionalization of NPs. A similar increase in the net magnetization of the NPs has been reported in the literature for different kinds of coatings [79\u201381] and attributed to an enhancement of the surface magnetic ordering of the MNPs due to the coating [29]. In addition, the obtained McTGA values become closer to the saturation magnetization of bulk Fe3O4 (\u223c92 Am2/kg), which, as explained before, is especially important for biomedical applications. High magnetization could result in good MRI and MFH effects.\nIn the in vitro MRI experiments, the r1,2 values of the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur samples being smaller than those of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG can be explained by the reduction in magnetization upon curcumin encapsulation from 74.7 and 70.4 Am2/kg (Supplementary Figure S5 in ESI), which in turn decrease the transverse relaxivity of the MNPs [3]. It is worth noting that the change in the r2/r1 ratio for the case of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur (Table 1) can be related to the effect of curcumin adsorption on the Fe3O4 NP surface, which resulted in a hydrophobicity change of the whole coating layer [82].\nNotably, r2 values of both Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur samples are significantly higher than those obtained for commercial Resovist, ferumoxytol or other Fe3O4-based systems [8,30,33,83]. The high value of the r2/r1 ratio also indicates that the T2 contrast mechanism is dominant for the investigated nanocarriers. The in vivo MRI results reconfirm that the MNPs enhance the contrast in MRI observation. The authors performed the in vivo MRI experiment in the 5-day-old tumor to determine if the MNPs could help distinguish the tumor from its surroundings at its early stage. From Figure 5B, one can note that the MNPs allow a more accurate assessment of the size, shape and part of the internal structure of the tumor at the early stage of cancer as well as an easier assessment of the presence or absence of a tumor when it appears inside the body. The MRI study on a 5-day-old tumor can also illustrate the MRI contrast enhancement for tumor observation, even at its early stage. In Figure 5A & B, a 10 \u03bcl dose of the NPs shows better differentiation of the rim and the inside area of the tumor than a 50 \u03bcl dose does. Therefore, a 10 \u03bcl dose (1.8 mg Fe/kg body weight) is better for MRI contrast enhancement. Some other studies used higher doses for MRI in vivo experiments (5 mg/kg [36,84]), and Chen et al. used an even higher dose of 30 mg/kg [85].\nAs indicated from the heating curves measured at f = 178 kHz and HAC = 5040 A/m (Supplementary Figure 8 in ESI), the Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur ferrofluids reached the temperature range for cancer hyperthermia treatment after a few hundredths of seconds. That makes them both potential candidates for low-field hyperthermia therapy, combined with heat-activated drug-release chemotherapy. The AMF-mediated drug-release profile clearly indicates that the heat generation of the MNPs activated by AMF serves as a driving force to release curcumin from the hydrophobic core of the system in a much faster and more effective way as compared with passive release. Although this phenomenon has also been reported by other researchers, most of the research involved thermosensitive components in the NPs [40,86\u201388]. The low passive rate achieves nearly zero losses of curcumin at the beginning, and then high active rate release, within a few minutes, allows a remotely controlled targeted delivering.\nThe biodistribution of NPs depends on many factors such as chemical composition, size, shape and surface modifications [89]. In a previous report, by ex vivo MFH experiments and atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis, the authors of the current study found that when intravenously injected into mice, the amounts of Fe3O4@PLAPEG MNPs are distributed in organs in the following order: liver > lung > spleen > tumor > kidney [90]. More important, a dose that is sufficient for hyperthermia of the tumor would overheat the liver. Therefore, in this study, to evaluate the cancer treatment ability of Fe3O4@PLA-PEG MNPs by MFH, the MNPs were directly injected into the mice\u2019s tumors. The product H\u00d7f of the magnetic field used in these in vivo experiments (8.97 \u00d7 108 A/(ms)), although slightly higher than that in the Atkinson\u2013Brezovich criteria (5 \u00d7 108) [10], is lower than that in the Dutz\u2013Hergt criteria (5 \u00d7 109) [55] is also much lower than that of many published Fe3O4-based NPs [56]. Compared with 19 nm cubic Fe3O4 NPs at the higher H\u00d7f = 1.21 \u00d7 109 A/[ms], Fe3O4@PLA-PEG MNPs show a similar effect of tumor growth inhibition [86].\n1688 Nanomedicine (Lond.)

            "text": "We have developed a multifunctional magnetic nanosystem with a core-shell structure consisting of \u223c9 nm Fe3O4 MNPs surrounded by amphiphilic copolymer PLA-PEG coating (Fe3O4@PLA-PEG) that allows us to reduce the coating mass. Besides, the coating layer helps improve the magnetic properties of the nanosystem by increasing the saturation magnetization of the NPs (\u223c10%). The high relaxivity ratio (r2/r1 = 357.6) indicates that Fe3O4@PLA-PEG MNPs can effectively work as T2 contrast agents for MRI. In addition, the high heating efficiency obtained under AMF (SAR = 82.2 W/g at H = 5\u201340 A/m; f = 178 kHz) reveals that Fe3O4@PLA-PEG MNPs are also very promising for magnetic hyperthermia. In addition, these nanocarriers can be loaded with anticancer drug curcumin (Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur) and release the drug under the application of an external AMF in a fast, facile and efficient way (nearly 100% release after 20 min). In vivo studies with mice bearing sarcoma 180 cancer reveal that the mice injected with Fe3O4@PLA-PEG and treated with AMF showed clear tumor growth inhibition lasting several days after the hyperthermia treatment. Finally, in vivo MRI experiments clearly showed an improvement in the contrast in the tumor area for those mice injected with Fe3O4@PLA-PEG MNPs. Therefore, our study indicates that Fe3O4@PLA-PEG/Cur is a promising multifunctional nanosystem, providing both efficient cancer detection (MRI) and treatment (drug delivery and magnetic hyperthermia) capacities."
