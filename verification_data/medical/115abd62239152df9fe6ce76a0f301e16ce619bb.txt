"Given the fact that S. aureus and CNS (both Staphylococci) are the main etiological agents of eye infections, first-treatment with CA has been replaced by fluoroquinolones, as they are highly efficacious against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, particularly Staphylococci. However, it should be noted that the emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones in recent years, might accelerate the comeback of CA." 

"Thus, further studies should be performed to determine whether CA efficacy differs in the various body compartments."

"Nevertheless, the high CA resistance rate in our study requires further investigation and might be attributed to injudicious usage of CA among patients suffering from sepsis."

"Certainly, there is a need for performance of similar studies in developed countries in order to consider the use of CA."

"According to our data, CA susceptibility has been retained, apparently due to its limited usage. Therefore, in the current era with high antibiotic resistance and with no new treatments, reintroduction of CA into standard antibacterial infection management protocols should be considered."
